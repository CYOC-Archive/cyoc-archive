<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny was unloaded into a coral with ease as she trotted out of the crate to join several other horses. It was as the smaller crate was opened that the wranglers had their work cut out for them.<br />
<br />
Prodding and prodding they tried to remove the big buck Mountain type of goat from his lair. As Melody trotted out to meet her new life soon after Georgia waddled out with her mate mounted deep into her hairy rump.<br />
<br />
The men all laughed at the sight and sounds of one big goat humping and grunting with every thrust. The dominated nanny, Georgia feeling the wild passions and still remembering her fun night before with the crewman she was in hope to marry some day.<br />
<br />
A mournful bleating issued from the nanny being mounted. Her groans and moans made most of the wranglers stop and listen as she sounded much like love groans they'd heard from their wives.<br />
<br />
Morning went to noon and then to a hot and sunny afternoon. The wranglers would work about doing their needed work but all the time they could hear that big buck fucking first one and then the other. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile back at the University Frank called the Professor and asked a real question. &quot;I just thought of your wording which must have changed the Blonde to a nanny. I wonder was the Medallion's curse placed on just her or the shipping crate?&quot;<br />
<br />
The Professor sat up straight in his chair and wondered the very thought too!<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't say but the crate will be held for final shipment to the University and when we have it we'll burn it! I think that will work don't you?&quot; asked the Professor back to Frank.<br />
<br />
All seemed right and with that the conversation was done. Yet back at the Airport was a Baggage handler named A.J. and the Illinois State Police. The Airlines report of two missing stewards from the Brazilian flight had the place in an uproar.<br />
<br />
Everyone questioned the Police returned to their office to write a report. It was A.J. that wondered what he'd seen and was too afraid to tell the authorities.<br />
<br />
Clocked out, A.J. proceeded to the impound lot and check on those goats. It was then from the wranglers he heard the difference in the manifest and the total count of animals in the crate. It was as he remembered the dress torn and hung on the latch of the crate which made him wonder all the more of that changing leg, foot and hooves he had witnessed.<br />
<br />
Looking over the fence he watched the big buck sleeping off his exercise and conquests. To the far corner were two nanny goats laying down and seemly muttering face to face at each other. Half thinking to enter their pen he stopped and saw the quarantine sign.<br />
<br />
Then turning he saw the crate and wondered if the torn dress was removed or found at all by the Police. Bending down he unlatched the crate's door and peered inside. The straw covered floor was thick in manure, urine and globs of what he thought was goat semen. <br />
<br />
Grabbing his flashlight he flicked on the light and scanned the deep dark insides of the crate. There mixed with manure was a light blue flight jacket, a torn dress, nylons, shoes, and bits of half chewed jewelry. Carefully he knelt inside the crate and reached for the strewn clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a real clue!&quot; A.J. said as he picked the items from the mired straw floor. Suddenly as fingers touched the mire soaked clothes he felt a cold shiver and a burning sensation. Quick as he could he exited the crate to stand leaning on the coral fence suddenly out of breathe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, this was evidence and the police should be made aware of it!&quot; said A.J. aloud as he reached for a telephone clipped to his belt.<br />
<br />
Fumble, fumble, his fingers seemed stiff and not cooperating. The smell of the mired crate still in his nostrils made him snort out like a horse might. Again a shiver rattled down from head to feet as he felt the dire need to head for the Men's room.<br />
<br />
Running a flat out dead run up the sidewalk he made a beeline for the public restroom by the employee parking lot.<br />
<br />
Bursting in he found to be alone and felt even more like he was about to be sick. Into a toilet stall he busted and lifting his hands to rub the dust from his eyes he pulled down his jeans to sit and relax.<br />
<br />
Thud as his butt hit the porcelain stool. A sigh of relief, as his hand reached down to direct the flow. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT!&quot; yelled A.J. as his hands touched something he'd never felt before. Jumping to his feet he whirled around and grabbing the edge of the stall's wall he looked down as the other hand took hold.<br />
<br />
In bright light he saw all too well the shaggy wool grown from his belly. Wool or hair was bad enough but the sight and feel of one very well matured and sensually attached sheath made it's day view.<br />
<br />
Eyes blinked as the realization of what he saw hit his full thought. A stroke of the free hand found tight muscle and shaggy hair. Reaching down he met the low hanging sack filled with tennis ball sized testicles. A deep breathe and then a sigh of sensual lust rolled out of him.<br />
<br />
Looking down he saw his thighs sprouting thick curly layers of wool as knees hunched and heels became hocks. A kick of one foot sent his pant s sliding under the stall's door and giving full view of elongating feet and cloven growing hooves.<br />
<br />
At those moments A.J. should have felt fear but instead the rush of sensual pleasure surged over him. A deep breathe and then another as he soon was breathing fast while the change roared up his back and chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, I must stop thinking of sensual thrills and oh the wild body!&quot; thought A.J. as he watched with sexual delight his humanity fade.<br />
<br />
Those stiff fingers soon could hold him upright no longer. As he felt his hold on the stall's divider fail he leaned his free hand to the back wall.  The spreading hair growth rushed down his arms as A.J. was intent on seeing the final change of hands to hooves.<br />
<br />
Then it slowed and before he had hooves the change came to a halt. His hands were still hands but covered in short hair and fingernails colored deep brown. Flexing his fingers the agility returned and he began to stroke his hairy body. <br />
<br />
A deep breathe and exhale he roared a bestial snort like it echoed the bathroom walls.  Suddenly the thought of how he must look came to mind. Fingers easily unhooked the door latch and stepping out of the toilet stall he saw his reflection in the sink mirror.<br />
<br />
A well muscled beast from the chest down his shoulders were human as arms and hands. Every part of him was covered in curly brown and dark brown goat's wool. A shaggy chest, back, belly, groin, and thighs, the lower legs covered in dark hide and short hairs. Arms too covered in shaggy hair about the shoulders and ever thinning as it covered forearms, hands, and fingers.<br />
<br />
Then he took grasp to his face and head. A rugged smile spread lips more in tune with grazing than speaking or showing expressions. Small black slits made his nostrils flare with each exhale. A cock of the head as he ogled his eyes now with square yellow pupils and long eyelashes.<br />
<br />
Tipping his forehead down he eyed those two black, ribbed, curving horns as they sprouted the forehead and wrapped his long point goat ears.<br />
<br />
Leaning on the sink's edge he closed his eyes and gave in to a moment of bestial goat like thoughts. Peering over his shoulder A.J. had a sudden passion to return to those two nanny goats and try to fuck them silly.<br />
<br />
Bang went the outside door to the men's room as some pour soul was entering A.J.'s lair. Kicking his clothes into the corner toilet stall A.J. jumped inside and closing the door waited.<br />
<br />
The sounds of someone walking about changed to a man yelling he wished and wanted a good blow job. A.J. listened for several minutes as the man raved on and screamed for sexual release.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll do it if you close your eyes and don't see my face!&quot; exclaimed A.J. from within his stall.<br />
<br />
The man stopped his yelling and said with passioned voice, &quot;Agreed!&quot;<br />
<br />
The flop of trousers to the floor made A.J. peer out to see one of the impound lot wranglers standing half naked and very erect.<br />
<br />
In a silent and quick move A.J. was upon the man's cock and sucked as his tongue wrapped the member tight. As human semen shot out the man's cock he opened his eyes wide and screaming tried to back away from A.J. the very robust male satyr.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you not to look!&quot; said A.J. in a clear sound human voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ah, ah, A.J. is this you?' asked the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is now an may I say I have something special for the likes of you Lyle.&quot; replied A.J.<br />
<br />
Luck was with the two as nobody else was in need of the restroom. As night covered the lots in dark shadows A.J. led Lyle in a firm grip to the holding pens.<br />
<br />
Pointing to the goat crate A.J. said, &quot;Lyle take the ride of your life!&quot; As Lyle bent over and peered into the crate a friendly satyr pushed him in with a cloven hooves.<br />
<br />
Lyle screamed as the goat crate curse worked it's magic on him. A.J. sat laughing as his friend pleaded for release from the crate. &quot;No way just enjoy!&quot; pouted A.J. back.<br />
<br />
Soon A.J. was nosed through the crate slats as he watched in calm wonder as his friend surpassed his satyr change and soon bleated for release from the crate a new formed Big Muscled Mountain Goat from Brazil.</p>
