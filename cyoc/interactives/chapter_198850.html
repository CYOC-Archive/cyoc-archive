<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Something wasn&#39;t right. Jennifer wasn&#39;t sure how she didn&#39;t notice it before but she had been... Had been getting sluttier and sluttier throughout the day. Thankfully, everything seemed to be fine at the moment. Even though she was a bit plain, with her small B cup breasts and her cute but average looks. Her skilled abilities with clothing and makeup made up for it. But even then she wasn&#39;t as pretty as the other girls at the school.<br />
<br />
She really had to thank her excellent charisma for landing the position as head cheerleader. That and her high fitness and talent. But she didn&#39;t think much about it today. She needed to stop what had been happening to her. <br />
<br />
Hoping to slow the changes as much as possible she sheered off her dirty blonde hair so that it barely covered her ears. It was ugly but hopefully, if the curse that she was under had to change more it would buy her more time. She ignored makeup and skipped showering, going to open her closet. Tossing on her most bland bra and her only pair of briefs, it was time for the rest of her &quot;outfit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jennifer put on her loosest jeans, one&#39;s she would usually never think to wear to school, worried about the, admittingly irrational fear of ostracization. In reality, her friends wouldn&#39;t care unless it became her new normal but Jennifer fretted anyway. Over the bra, she threw on an oversized long sleeve white t-shirt with some sports team on it that she had only ever worn lying around alone at her home. And a sweater. <br />
<br />
She had a vague feeling that Kyle, of all people, might have some answers to her plight. As she found an empty spot near the front of the bus she sat down, squinting at the sun. She had forgotten to bring her sunglasses but she would have to survive.<br />
<br />
It was actually a fairly long bus ride, especially with Jennifer trying to keep her eyes out for any changes. She was mostly unmolested by friends or other annoying students that might try to grab her attention until a few stops later.<br />
<br />
Katie stepped on the bus one of the more reclusive female students in her grade. She wasn&#39;t really a nerd nerd. Jennifer thought that she might be sort of into some of those things but it seemed more than she had overstrict parents. She never wore anything boyish. But even then it was extremely conservative. Even in the late spring sun, she wore a conservative blouse and a thin sweater over it and a long skirt that stopped about 3 inches from her ankles and her flats.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my spot.&quot; Katie declared standing in place in front of the seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girls, don&#39;t bicker just sit down.&quot; The mild-mannered, plump bus driver said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh fine.&quot; Katie sat down next to Jennifer before asking her a question. &quot;Why are you sitting here and not with your cronies?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I just needed to mix it up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you decided to sit in my seat?&quot; Jennifer thought a quiet girl like Katie would have been more soft-spoken.<br />
<br />
Raising her hands in defeat Jennifer responded, &quot;Alright, I am sorry. I can move if you wish?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Katie responded before flipping open a book, with the clear intention of ignoring Jennifer. <br />
<br />
Scooching to the right side of the seat to get more room, Jennifer could have sworn she had put on looser jeans that morning. Apparently, she was misremembering. Not that she dwelled on the thought. She was blazing hot and she wasn&#39;t sure if she could keep the hoodie on much longer. <br />
<br />
Brushing sweat off her forehead, causing her bangs to get pushed to the side before they disappeared in her now brown hair she gave up. She knew she needed to keep it on so she could slow down the changes enough so that she could find Kyle but it was too much. She put her arms above her head and struggled out of the snug sweater. Much to the annoyment of her new seat partner Katie.<br />
<br />
With the sweater off and Katie&#39;s eyes returned to her book, Jennifer shoved the sweater into the top of her backpack. She was still warm but it was better. Her chest was the warmest, probably because of the blank short-sleeved grey t-shirt she wore. She really should have put something white on to reflect the heat but she was stuck with the long black tank top with the wide shoulder straps.<br />
<br />
At least them being a tank top should help even if it was black. 2/3 through the trip she double-checked herself. She had the same dark brown hair she had when she woke up. And it remained just above her chin where she had sheered it off. She had no experience with cutting hair and hadn&#39;t treated her hair that morning. But she had to admit it looked really good.<br />
<br />
Putting some light lipstick on her no longer thin lips, she couldn&#39;t find any changes in her face. And her clothes were still the same. Jeans with a few rips in them and the black tank top over her rather plain push-up bra. A push-up bra that held up her large B cups. <br />
<br />
When the bus finally arrived unfortunately it was late and the bell had already rung. Running down the halls Jennifer got confused. She felt like she was supposed to be going to calc one but she was in the art department. Taking a look around she spotted Katie, well Kate she corrected herself.<br />
<br />
She was still dressed in the black blouse, with the top few buttons undone. Not exposing any cleavage but showing some nice skin nonetheless. She was also still wearing the black belted skirt that stopped just above her knees. Exposing the fishnet leggings underneath. Finally rounded out by a pair of conservative 1-inch heels.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing Jen? We have pottery.&quot; In her soft voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry. Thanks, Kate.&quot; Jen replied with her nice voice.<br />
<br />
As Jen followed Kate to class she couldn&#39;t keep her eyes off Kate&#39;s ass. She could have sworn she had been straight but no. For as long as she could remember she had always been Bi. Sliding into what was now their normal seats, after giving the teacher their notes excusing their tardiness. It was time to get to work. <br />
<br />
Even feeling like she had never done this before she was making a wonderful coffee cup. She did shift in her stool a few times as her ass and hips continued to swell until the teacher announced Jen and Kate&#39;s names. She admired the finished product that had cooled after being removed from the kiln. <br />
<br />
It was a tall pole of roughly 4 inches with several key hooks on it. She carefully stowed it in her bag for later before the bell rang. Following her best friend Jen didn&#39;t notice the lingering looks on her body. She didn&#39;t notice that her jeans slowly rose up her legs or the massive rips that now permeated them. Or how through the rips, fishnet stockings ran underneath. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t notice the sway of her hips or how boys and a few girls ogled the moderate amount of cleavage displayed by the low neckline of her black tank top or the now C cups contained within. She was too busy watching Kate&#39;s ass sway back in forth in front of her. Especially the short skirt that was tantalizingly a few inches too long.<br />
<br />
She had to stop ogling as it was time for...</p>
