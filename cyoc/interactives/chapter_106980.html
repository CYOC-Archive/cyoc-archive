<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, Teddy, that should just about do it,&quot; Joe said standing over his naked son.  <br />
<br />
One minute, Teddy had been on his bed, and it had been dark.  Now he was in the garage standing upright, and the way the sun was streaming it, it had to be around noon.  He tried to speak, but couldn&#39;t.  He felt like he was naked, but weirdly his balls and cock were pressed tight against his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there.  Now you should be conscious and able to understand me, while still being trapped in your new body.  I think I may have mentioned the Chronivac to you before, but no matter.  You&#39;ll soon know all you need to know as soon as the upload is complete. I suppose I could skin you to look just like you did before I changed you into a machine, and no one would ever know?  But it&#39;s much more satisfying having you look like just another android from my factory.  You&#39;re just one of a legion of drones now. Heh, heh, and while you are conscious, you cannot communicate your humanity unless I command it.  I am sure you want to say something now.  To berate me?  To plead with me?  Sorry, boy this is the time out I should have given you years ago, you can stew in your own thoughts, while I upload the specs for repairing my automobile. Then your first job will be to fix my car.  When you&#39;re through with that-&quot;<br />
<br />
The phone rings.  It&#39;s your smart phone.  Joe picks it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Teddy&#39;s phone.  He cannot answer at the moment, how can I help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you must be one of his butler dudes,&quot; said the male voice on the other end of the phone.  He can be heard saying to someone else nearby,  &quot;Guess Teddy&#39;s too wasted to talk.  But I&#39;ll make sure we&#39;re still on for the robosex party.&quot;  He cleared his voice and spoke loudly again, unaware that his whispered conversation had been heard by the person on the other end of the call. &quot;Yes, I just want to make sure that Teddy will have that Android for the party at the Williams&#39; place tonight.  He said it was one of those new sleek models.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, a Partybot?  I can assure you that Teddy&#39;s robot will be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Inside your titanium and silicon head you are panicking.  You promised the guys a total sexbot.  If your father has really changed you into a droid, then you can be a sexbot with a simple upload.  All androids are identical, but they can morph and use holo projectors to make their smooth shiny rubber bodies look human.  You are suddenly aware of the pneumatics in your chest which can inflate your chest into boobs, and of the servos that can adjust your hips and height.  Your specs flash in front of you.  You can be anywhere from 5&#39;4&quot; to 6&#39; 10&quot;, male, female, anthropomorphic animals, and your black and silver rubberized latex standard coloring can shift to over 1600 different colors, and even more color combinations.   Wicked Willie Williams would have him as short and slightly buxom and Asian as the parameters would allow. And Marco would want him tall thin African American with a wicked fro.  He was horrified at his friends using him tonight.  His father wouldn&#39;t?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, this is William Williams, is it?  Teddy&#39;s bot will definitely be there, and it will be fully programmed for your evening enjoyment, but I fear Teddy&#39;s face won&#39;t be gracing your party tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Willie turned from the phone and shouted to the others, &quot;Heh,heh, he says, &quot;Teddy&#39;s face won&#39;t be gracing&quot; our party tonight, but the bot will be there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle grinned and thought, &quot;Oh, yeah, Teddy will be there.  I&#39;ll upload his image into the droid, and we&#39;ll have a hoot as naked Teddy serves drinks and gives BJ&#39;s.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joe put down the phone, and went over to the android control console. He typed in several things, and hit execute.<br />
<br />
A huge rush of data streamed into Teddy&#39;s mind.  He zoned out. Suddenly, he was aware again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fix it, bot boy then report to me in my study,&quot; Joe ordered.<br />
<br />
Immediately, Teddy headed over to the wrecked automobile. He was amazed at how strong he was. He didn&#39;t need a jack or anything to raise the car up to look underneath it. He scanned the vehicle with his augmented robotic eyes, and processed the data.  It was fucking cool to have super-strength, and to know precisely how to repair this trashed machine. Maybe being a droid wasn&#39;t so bad.    He went to work.<br />
<br />
When he had finished polishing the totally restored car.  His processors acknowledged that 5.8 hours had elapsed.  Droids really were the solution, he thought with satisfaction, if he had taken the car to the shop, it would have been two weeks minimum to make it like this.  He would have grinned if he could.  A tiny voice in his head said in a dull monotone: &quot;Task complete.  Report to study for further orders.&quot;  <br />
<br />
And while Teddy wanted to stay admiring his work, his feet did otherwise. He spun around and goosestepped up to the main house and down the mirrored corridor to his father&#39;s study.  He stole glances at his reflection as he went by.  Was that really him?  Probably, his father had only stuck him in a virtual reality pod, but this felt more real than that.  He had a bad feeling.  He silently entered the study, and stood at attention.<br />
<br />
His father was at his desk on the phone.  He totally ignored the android that had entered his study, and  continued chatting. <br />
<br />
It took Teddy a few moments to realize that his father was chatting about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dean, I&#39;m hopeful that Theodore can resume his studies next year.  Thank you for being so understanding, about him going to rehab.  No, I don&#39;t think anyone will have contact with him for months. You will have a word with his coach won&#39;t you?  Thanks again.  Yes, I know Theodore will appreciate you holding a spot for him at the college. Goodbye.&quot;  He hung up, and said to himself, &quot;Lord knows, I&#39;ve given that school enough money they should bloody well keep a spot open for Teddy for a decade.  He started reading emails.  Then he looked up remembering something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, Teddy, mistook you for a regular droid.  Didn&#39;t expect you to finish so quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Crap.  You realize he didn&#39;t remember anything.  He just read the completed task email that you automatically had sent him.  You are suddenly aware that a half dozen droids standing at attention in the room, and your father isn&#39;t looking at you, but at the droid next to you that entered after you. He can&#39;t tell which bot you are?  You have a bad feeling.</p>
