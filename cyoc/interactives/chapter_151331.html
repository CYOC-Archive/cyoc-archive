<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah came back to her room, still holding Jeff tightly and headed to a corner of her room where there was a big dollhouse, surrounded by a few dolls and their furniture. Jeff looked at it and was stunned to see the dolls moving. His sister saw him stare at them and said “Yeah, I made a few change at the same time…I didn’t wanted to totally immobilize you, and I couldn’t have you as my only walking doll… So I brought my others Barbies to life to both watch on you and give you company !” Sarah put Jeff down next to the dollhouse. “Enjoy your new girlfriends, they’ll take care of you. I’ll be back soon !” she giggled and left the room, closing it, trapping her dolled brother inside.<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to look at the other Barbies. they were his size and came closer to him, staring at him with they ever lasting smiles. It reminded him of some horror movie. Before he could react, still stunned by what just had happened, they grabbed him and took him to the dollhouse. As he was trying to get free, he heard a voice inside his head :<br />
<br />
“Calm down beauty, we’re just going to dress you ! You can’t run around naked”. <br />
<br />
Jeff was horrified.<br />
<br />
 “How can you speak, I don’t see your lips moving !” He thought. He was immediately shocked by how feminine his new inner voice sounded.<br />
<br />
“It’s because the Goddess gave us the ability to communicate by thinking !” Said another voice.<br />
<br />
“The Goddess ? Which Goddess ?”<br />
<br />
“The one that brought you among us, silly ! The one that gave life to all of us dolls… like she did with you” <br />
<br />
“She’s no Goddess !” Screamed Jeff internally “She’s just a little brat ! And I’m not a doll ! I’m her brother!” <br />
<br />
“What a joker you are !” giggled a few voices “The Goddess doesn’t have a brother, and even if she had, you are neither human or boy.”<br />
<br />
Right before the door, he freed himself from their grasp and looked around for a way out, but couldn’t see any. Two Ken dolls showed up and picked him up, each one by an arm.<br />
<br />
“Please calm down, sweetie, and let the girls take care of you as the Goddess commanded” a male voice said. <br />
<br />
Jeff was brought inside the dollhouse. As they passed in front of a mirror, he finally saw himself : an helpless naked barbie girl, strongly hold by two massive men. He felt weak and understood it was needless to fight back right now.<br />
<br />
Inside the dollhouse, he faced a couple of Barbies, almost identical to him, holding a puffy royal blue gown with white laces and bows. The Ken dolls  hold his arms up as the dress was slipped on him. Jeff was then sited  on a vanity chair where a Barbie started working on his hairs and another one put him white high heels shoes. Once they were done, The Kens leaved, and Jeff could stand up. He was led to the mirror where he saw a Barbie princess staring back at him.<br />
<br />
“By Sarah, you look fabulous.” said one of the Barbie that had dressed him. Jeff stared at his own reflection, and was tempted to ripe the dress apart. He thought back to how helpless he had felt when he was naked and decided to keep it for now… until he found anther one or he could escape.<br />
<br />
	As he was staying here, not knowing what to say or do, surrounded by the two barbies, he heard steps behind him. He turned, feeling his gown spinning around, and saw a group of dolls walking to them. One was wearing a fairy dress with wings and seemed to be the leader. The two who had take care of him curtsied in front of her. <br />
<br />
“Here is the new comer. We prepared her as you asked.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks you both” Told the Fairy Barbie, then she looked at Jeff. “Welcome to our world, darling. I’m Fiona, fairy and priestess of our Goddess Sarah.” <br />
<br />
“Damn it, she’s no goddess, she’s my sister and turned me into a doll” answered Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Be careful of what you say, girl, She’s our Goddess and Maker.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a girl but her big brother.”<br />
<br />
 “Nonsense , She has no brother… and you admitted She made you the way you are now… which is clearly girl to me. Whatever you were before She decided to bless you with another existence as one of us, and you shall respect Her will. What is your name ?”<br />
<br />
“I’m Jeff, Sarah’s brother that she erased from existence apparently. And I will not submit to that brat will”<br />
<br />
“If She does have the ability to bend reality, how can you even deny She’s a Goddess ?”<br />
<br />
“She used my laptop where there is a program able to transform things and people. That how she made me a Barbie doll and gave you life”<br />
<br />
“As you said, She’s one who made you and us the way we are. She’s wiser than us are and made our world a place full of life. It’s enough for us to accept Her as our Goddess… and you’ll submit to whatever project she has for you since you’re her creation as well. You can’t be called Jeff, that’s not a proper name for such a good figure. What is your name ?”<br />
<br />
“MY NAME IS JEFF, DAMN IT ! And I will never accept her as any deity !”<br />
<br />
The Fairy Barbie made a sign and the Ken dolls came back, holding his arms again.<br />
<br />
“You will learn to act properly. And since you don’t want to give us your name, we’ll pick one for you… you’ll be… “ She thought for a second “Lily, the Barbie princess. Take her to her box so our Goddess can see how we served her when she come back”.<br />
<br />
The Kens took Jeff next to the dollhouse where he saw a box like the one in stores, with a transparent front so you can see the doll inside. It was empty… for now. They attached Jeff to a cardboard and placed it into the box. The fairy Barbie came to see him through the screen and wrote something on the side of the box.<br />
<br />
“It’s for your own good, darling. You need to accept who you are”<br />
<br />
Then she left. Alone, Jeff tried to break out but he wasn’t strong enough. He couldn’t do anything but wait. Wait in a box… as a Barbie doll… in a girl’s room.</p>
