<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tuesday was a bit better and stress free for Tad. While there was still a great deal of stress and potential trouble that weres would be facing, particularly if Tom Herald continued his own personal investigation into getting to the truth behind Ulysses&#39; death and the tail seen in his capture, most of the initial heat was already beginning to die down. Tad didn&#39;t know it, but that was likely due to Agent Green&#39;s efforts to get the Seattle Police to believe that the tail was a costume piece and that a random homeless guy claimed to have &quot;found&quot; the tail. That got a lot of the media to buy into the costume story and the initial shock was already dying down, though the fears would probably remain high for awhile, particularly until the murderer of Lionel Ulysses was caught and gave an explanation as to why.<br />
<br />
Tad, however, didn&#39;t bother himself with that for the moment. With things being a bit less stressful, he returned to some of the other issues that he had found himself working with, as they were also there and didn&#39;t just magically stop because of Lionel Ulysses&#39; arrest and later his murder. This related to Amy&#39;s brothers, as he knew from her that her family was nervous that they might transform early, as Amy did. That scenario had to have been a rough one for the Howler family, and Tad really couldn&#39;t say anything scientifically as to why it happened or if there was any way to prevent it. The only thing Tad could contribute was tips based on how his dad had helped him when it came time for his first transformation.<br />
<br />
The subject came up between him and Amy on their way into school, partially because Tad wanted to make sure that Amy was okay, and he&#39;d so far found that his girlfriend was concerned for her brothers, even when they did the things that he supposed younger siblings did to older siblings. The morning talk, however, couldn&#39;t last long as the bus ride didn&#39;t last long enough to get into it too deeply. The fact that Amy also kept her voice at a whisper to make sure that other teens on the bus weren&#39;t listening in on the conversation. After they arrived at school, Tad went through his day, turned in his homework from the previous day and enjoyed things being a bit less stressful than the day before. From there, he went to lunch and smiled when he found Amy in the lunch line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how&#39;s it going?&quot; Tad said to her as he walked up.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s going pretty could,&quot; Amy replied with a smile, &quot;much less stress than yesterday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad nodded, &quot;want to sit together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll see you at an open spot,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;but until then...&quot;<br />
<br />
At this point, Tad looked to see that Amy wasn&#39;t last in the lunch line and that there were students behind her that were eyeing him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll need to go to the back of the line,&quot; Tad chuckled, and then turned to the others, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not cutting.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that he went to the back of the line. He stood there and went through the line, collecting the school lunch, and then making his way to where Amy had sat down. She smiled to him as arrived and sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have been rather quiet so far,&quot; Tad said to her, &quot;at least quiet today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is a good thing,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;the last thing my family needs is to have exposure doubling our problems...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With regard to your brothers?&quot; Tad asked quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Amy nodded, &quot;the thing in Seattle couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time with regard to the issues my family will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do what I can to help, you know that, right?&quot; Tad said to her. He&#39;d never had a real girlfriend before, but there was just something about Amy that made him want to be there for her and help her, protect her, not to mention putting butterflies in his stomach when he did see her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Amy gave a smile, &quot;and what you&#39;ve said on how your dad got you ready... it&#39;s been very helpful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Tad spoke, &quot;and when it comes, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no ME we&#39;re worried about,&quot; Amy told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and that wasn&#39;t what I meant,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;You and I both know that once the dreams and other signs of the approaching first transformation start doesn&#39;t mean that that transformation will happen instantly. It took a week for it to actually manifest with me from when I started having the dreams... and my mom said that with her it took nearly a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And mine was about a week too,&quot; Amy nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;See,&quot; Tad gave a smile, &quot;so even if the preliminaries are happening... it will take some time and that will give your family the time to get things ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll still be there?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If your brothers want someone closer to their age that they trust, of course,&quot; Tad answered, &quot;though, also keep in mind that I&#39;m straight... so if I&#39;m there, it will be to help talk them through their first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy chuckled and flicked at Tad&#39;s nose, &quot;even if you were bi, I wouldn&#39;t share you with my brothers. That would be weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad chuckled in response, feeling good about a less stressful day, &quot;so long as we&#39;re clear on that.&quot;</p>
