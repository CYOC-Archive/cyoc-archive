<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At first, 16 year old Tony and his friends had fun with just the threat of transforming his 14 year old brother Mark.  For the first few days after Mark had made Selkirk, the freshman hazing bully into a 400 pound joke until he apologized to Mark and his friends, Mark was in a constant state of anxiety anytime Tony or his friends were around.  Any of them might be wielding the chronivac that would turn him into a girl, or the size of a mouse or into some kind of sideshow freak as his required payment for using it to teach Selkirk a lesson.<br />
<br />
But Tony and his friends had no intention of throwing away their leverage over Mark.  Tony went to pick Mark up at his ballet class.  Inside the door, he held his backpack as though he had a laptop computer inside.  He could see Mark nervously eyeing him as he practiced a series of leaps and then carrying one girl after another across the floor.  Tony knew that Mark was taught to control a spin by picking some point in the room or off the stage as a reference point and to relocated that object each time around.  At the instructor's command, Mark was spinning rapidly in place and Tony could see that he was Mark's reference point.  As the class was breaking up and kids pairing off with their parents, Mark warily approached Tony. <br />
&quot;Should I keep my nice stretchy tights on so that I'm not immediately naked when you change me into an ass or an ape or something?&quot;<br />
Tony just laughed and pushed Mark toward the changing rooms.<br />
<br />
The next day, Mark was walking home and suddenly noticed Jack following about 50 feet behind him on the sidewalk and staring rather intently at him.  He felt his pulse quicken and he walked faster.  Down the street he glanced again and saw Jack now holding his backpack in front of him as if trying to keep something level.  A laptop?!  Mark started racewalking and then, seeing Jack jogging toward him, Mark broke into a full frantic sprint.  Jack was fast, but model/athlete Mark was even faster.  Only Mark was so unhinged by anxiety that he tripped on a slanted and cracked in half concrete sidewalk square.  He tumbled to the ground and saw Jack running toward him grinning wildly.  Mark tensed, every muscle flexed in terror at the prospect of what Jack would do to him.  Jack pulled an empty pizza box from his bag and pointed it at Mark, sort of jabbing with it over and over.<br />
&quot;Transform, damn you!  Transform!&quot;<br />
Mark nearly pissed his pants and then couldn't help but join a hysterical Jack in his laughter.<br />
<br />
But the next night, anticipation was over.  Tony knew that Mark was starring in the ballet school's performance that evening.  Jack went with Tony.  They slipped in quietly, both wearing hooded sweatshirts and standing way off to the side at the back of the room as the parents and others, mostly girls, were filtering into the seating area in front of the stage.  Soon after, as the seats were nearly filled, Mark appeared in front of the curtain to talk to the ballet instructor.  Gasps and giggles erupted from the girls.  Mark was clad in only his ballet slippers and white tights so revealing they may as well have been painted on him.  Mark didn't have an ounce of fat on him and the skin of his V shaped torso ending in his tiny waist, was flawless.  <br />
<br />
Tony and Jack were surprised at the explicitness of the girls' comments about the shape of Mark's buns and what they would do if they got their hands on him.  One girl in braces who looked barely 10 years old giggled as she promised to cover Mark in chocolate and lick him clean and then take care of his cream filling, too.  Another repeatedly mimed running her hands over Mark's buns in the air in front of her as though she was trying to sculpt Mark's rear out of thin air.  The looks in the eyes of two men at the side of the stage was even more salacious.  But Mark stayed right there, speaking to the instructor with his backside to the adoring audience and pulled on his white and gold velvet top that pulled tight at his little waist.  He was a model turned prince.  He disappeared behind the curtain and the strains of Tchaikovsky wafted through the room as the lights dimmed and the ballet began.<br />
<br />
Actually, it was parts of a couple different ballets that the students danced.  And even some of those were modified to allow for the limited abilities of the girls at the school and to showcase Mark.<br />
<br />
It was most of the way through the program, Mark had just put down a girl he had carried across the stage, drawing hushed ooo's and ahhh's from the crowd at the ability of such a slender boy to perform such an athletic feat.  The familiar electric wave passed through Mark.  He controlled his panic, though and stepped lightly to the back of the stage as he was supposed to.  At a moment of inactivity, he glanced at his reflection in a mirrored wall to one side of the stage.  He could feel something happening inside him but it was hard to tell just what.  His image in the mirror didn't look any different.  The cue in the music came though and Mark leaped forward to begin the big finish to the program.  He finished by lunging forward onto one knee and holding his arms out toward the girl who was dancing the part of the princess as Tchaikovsky reached a rousing crescendo. <br />
<br />
He also finished at 130 pounds, up from his normal 118 pounds.  He hadn't realized exactly what was happening to him at first because his weight didn't change as his metabolic processes were being rewired and his drum tight skin attained a rubbery flexibility to accomodate what was to come.  His last few leaps, Mark felt sluggish and didn't attain his usual height of flight.  As he landed and took his final step, he felt his ass jiggle.  What the hell!?<br />
<br />
He joined the other dancers in a line bowing to the applauding crowd though he felt uncomfortable with his acute awareness of his increasing weight, up to 140 by the time he straightened up from his bow.  As he did, he looked for Tony and saw him in the room under a hooded sweatshirt, next to Jack, laughing.<br />
<br />
Tony and Jack made their way out the door and Mark ran after them, his 150 pounder's ass bouncing behind him and his new love handles jiggling at his sides.  He scrambled into the back seat of Jack's car, getting a big slap on his behind from Jack as he got in.<br />
&quot;How do you like your big, doughy new ass&quot; chuckled Jack.<br />
Mark wa about to reply angrily when another impulse hit him, hit him in a big way.  Hunger.  Hunger and thirst.  Mark pleaded for Jack to stop at the nearby McDonald's and buy him some food.<br />
&quot;Please!  Please!  I'm so hungry.  I could eat a-a whole cow&quot;<br />
&quot;You'll be as big as one, soon&quot; laughed Jack at 160 pound Mark in the rear view mirror.  But he went to McDonald's and ordered three supersized Big Mac Meals.  For Mark.  While Jack and Tony split some fries and had cokes, Mark inhaled 5000 calories of food and still felt famished.  Jack let him and Tony off at their house and marveled at the changes in Mark.  Reed thin and 118 pounds just an hour ago, he was comically pear shaped now, his ass like two beach balls beneath his straining ballet tights as his weight soared past 200 pounds.  <br />
<br />
Mark looked stunned himself as he slapped one burgeoning buttock and watched the wavelike ripple of the impact pass through his suddenly elephantine cheek.  Jack and Tony laughed and then again as Mark suddenly clutched at his chest beneath his bursting prince's top as his flesh suddenly drooped ridiculously, the result of extreme gynecomastia that he'd been programmed to suffer by Jack and Tony.<br />
&quot;Oh shit.  I need the Bro or the Manssiere&quot; Mark whined as his brother and friend laughed.<br />
<br />
Mark waddled into the house and up to his room where he peeled off his now ridiculous tights with great effort.  He couldn't bear to look at his newly obese body.  When he woke up the next morning, he could somehow sense that the process had stopped.  He rolled off the bed with effort and waddled, his thighs rubbing all the way, to the bathroom where Tony had left a scale for him.  Mark hesitantly stepped atop it and when the dial finally calmed down, it read 329 pounds.  He looked at himself in the mirror.  His face was a bit rounder and he had a second chin.  He had a pot belly that obscured his penis from view.  But the big change was his lower body.  Where Mark had previously had a V shaped torso that narrowed to his small waist, his entire body was now an inverted V, a triangle due to his immense thighs and comically large ass.  Tony had left a tape measure in the bathroom and Mark measured himself.  His chest was only a couple inches bigger than before, 36.  But his waist was now 44 and his hips measured an elephantine 87 inches.  Even his ankles and feet looked and felt stuffed with fat to the point of bursting.  He was used to his muscular little ass extending relatively far out back of him, but his new buns had enough space to sublet.  <br />
<br />
Mark tried to take a shower and found that there were large parts of his corpulent new corpus that he couldn't reach.  He also found that the width of the tub was inadequate for his new ass as he pushed the curtain out toward the rest of the bathroom no matter which way he turned.  <br />
<br />
In his room, Mark found a lime green polyester running suit in his new size, 8XL and wore that to school.  School was hell.  Mark could barely fit one of his cheeks into a desk chair and the whole cafeteria exploded in laughter when the plastic backed chair he sat in at lunch collapsed beneath Mark's mass.  Even teachers casually mocked Mark's roly poly body.  <br />
<br />
He tried to talk to Zoe, the girl he had been seeing and found that she was completely disgusted by supersized Mark, decidedly not an energetic, lithe dancer's body.  <br />
<br />
Mark endured 3 days of being morbidly obese and felt morbid about the whole experience.  He was delighted when he felt the electric wave pass through him on his walk home.  He walked right out of his 329 pounder's clothes in his 118 pound model/athlete's body bursting with energy.  He streaked the remaining 100 yards home, laughing all the while.</p>
