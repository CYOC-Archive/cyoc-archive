<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hanna started to feel pain. she was halfway down the block to where her family lived. She looked down and noticed that she was 9 feet tall, and growing. She relished it. Her skin began to turn black and grow scales. Her size growth continued, quickly reaching 20 feet tall. Her feet had turned into enormous claws, along with her hands. A tail had poked out of the remaining clothing she was wearing, and rapidly expanded in length. Hanna continued to walk and saw the houses getting smaller and smaller. Hanna grinned as the ground shook and cracked when she stomped. Her head hurt as a snout pushed out, along with 3 rows of sharpening teeth. She roared and was surprised that she had made it. As she grew, the road shrank. She grew to 40 feet, then 53. Her house was too small to get into! &#39;Oh well, Hanna thought. &#39;I&#39;ll just terrorize as a town. THAT, would be fun.&#39;She continued to grow as she made her way into town. Her tail had grown to 69 feet, then 89, then 99. Sharp spikes grew along her massive tail and back. Her human features were mostly gone, except for standing on two legs. Still growing, she picked up a tiny car. &quot;It looks like a model&quot;, Hanna thought.She saw a person inside, and ate it. It felt good. She stood at a lengthy 123 feet tall. Her feeet had lost it&#39;s 5 toes and grown 3 class, which had grown abnormally large, to 12 feet. Hanna could barely see the puny humans, making it hard to crush them. That wouldn&#39;t matter when she was big enough. She breathed fire on a building, and picked it up and threw it into the distance. Tons of red dots appeared on the small streets. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I was so puny and small once,&quot; thought Hanna. She continued to grow STILL, to 142 feet. Hanna hoped it would never end. She picked up another building and ate it, which tasted metallic. She liked it. She stomped on a small home that was near her. It was flattened. She wasn&#39;t big enough to destroy some building a, but she was getting there. Watching her body rapidly expanding and growing was fun. She knocked down a helicopter with her tail. &quot;So the military is here. How will your guns kill me? I could eat your tanks right now&quot;. And so she did. It was hard to see them at 212 feet tall, but she managed. She stomped a massive paw down on a miniscule tank, causing the tank and the people inside to explore. She picked up another tank and swallowed it right up. A marine jumped off the tank and landed on the ground using a parachute. She absentmindedly swiped her tail and crushed the marine, who was no match for the ever growing Kaiju. Hanna noticed that she had grown a 4th set of spiky teeth. She tested her 43 feet long teeth on a nice long building. Her teeth sank right through, and her unstoppable grip smashed the rest to a pulp. She stood at an absolutely huge 367 feet. She could no longer see the scattered humans as they were too small. She swiped at a plane who had been shooting explosives at her. It fell in one go. Patchetic, humans were to her. She walked, and ultimately stomped, as her size made it impossible to walk. The ground shook and crumbled at her will. She loved and cherished that this might never end. Hanna breifly paused to look at her feet, or now claws. She had shed so much blood that she was beginning to collect blood on her feet. Hanna thought it looked cool. She stood at a nice 400 feet tall, and counting. She was way taller than any other self proclaimed monster.Only SHE was the REAL Kaiju. She stomped around looking for Godzilla, growing and changing the whole time. After about ten minutes, she had destroyed a fith of the city, killed thousands of people and military, and grown to around 490 feet. She had stopped growing, and was temporarily saddened, but then found Godzilla. She was over 100 feet larger, and could easily destroy Godzilla. She kicked him and swiped her massive, long black tail at Godzilla. She then kept her tail on top of him so he could not escape, and stepped on his head, effectively smashing it. She looked at the body, then cut up the body and ate it. It tasted wonderful. She drizzled blood on there teeth. horns, claws, and other areas to show her supremacy. She giggled. &quot;That was too easy&quot;. She replied to no one. Of course, nobody would hear anything but a deafening roar, but it didn&#39;t matter. Suddenly she started hurting again. She started growing again, even faster than before! She grew to 430, then 470, then 578, then 640... Her horns grew rapidly, soaring into the sky. All her claws grew to a lengthy 25 feet, and her tail grew to a length of 456. The spikes on her tail grew to around 230. She was absolutely massive. She was getting so big, she didn&#39;t know what to do. She had an idea. &quot;I&#39;m going to destroy all the other kaijus, and force the humans to worship me as their God. If not, they will be obliberated!&quot;  So she went to find Gigan. She could easily stomped on him and kill him. Pathetic. Hydra was harder, as he could fly. Real fidgety. She ended up eating him alive once she had grabbed and tortured Hydra. It tasted like beef , oddly. She went on her way,killing the puny kaijus who dared to cross her path. Every time she killed a Kaiju, she seemed to grow. Once all the monsters see dead, she stood at a whopping 1737 feet. The last kaiju, Shin Gojiraa, was fun. She easily stepped on him and instantly killed him under her weight. She liked to imagine how she would be worshipped. She paused from destroying a tower labeled &#39;TRUMP&#39;, and looked down at herself. She had an anthro body, but she had lost her breasts and private areas to make room for her ever growing tail, and to open her mouth wider, to be able to crunch on larger buildings. Her feet were similar to a T. Rex&#39;s, but her feet were much more flat, and had 3 does, with massive elongated claws that had the blood thousands on them.Hanna&#39;s torso and tail had the snake-belly that was seen on other monsters. She had spiky black scales all over, and had huge spikes extend down her torso to the end of her tail. She wiggled a toe, accidentally smashing an entire suburb. She had grown againz without noticing, this time to 2869 feet. She expected to find it hard to breathe, but she could breathe fine. She breathed in, and exhaled fire, to her surprise. &quot;So I LITERALLY breathe fire. Nice,&quot; thought Hanna. She looked back down at the world below. She had grown larger than an entire reigion. The humans MUST worship me now, thought Hanna. She bent down as far as a 2869 feet tall Kaiju could, and still towered hundreds of feet above everything. She then began to speak. &quot;Puny humans! As your GOD, I command you bro worship me! OBEY, OR DIE!&quot;</p>
