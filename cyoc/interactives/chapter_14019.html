<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ben thought for a moment his first choice of something he had dreamed of being if he could was to become a bull. The possibility of this happening here and now was making his anxous as hands took to sweating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we thinking or gone to sleep?&quot; asked the Genie guide.<br />
<br />
The rude remark started Ben as then the computer screen jumped to a listing with pictures to one side of bulls, bulls, and more bulls worldwide.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, yes this one please!&quot; yelled Ben as the Genie scrolled the choices along.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Charolais breed, a fine large animal indeed! Now as to your size and thus beginning age how old should you be to start?&quot; asked the Genie as the &quot;C&quot; drives light went to flashing Ben's computer whirled accepting all the data.<br />
<br />
Ben thought for a moment his recalling his Uncle's farm and the calves at play while those grown bulls would saunter about looking and sniffing the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;Napping again?&quot; asked the Genie when Ben did not come back with an answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;One year old, a mature bull able and ready to mate but still not so fattened I can't move about freely!&quot; at last came Ben's reply.<br />
<br />
The Genie snickered and then began to spout a long line of wierd sounding words. It took Ben off guard as he felt the computer program's twist on magic begin to make obvious changes transitioning him from human to bovine. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are on your way Master, be assured that your pleasure is my only concern. As a mature Charolais bull yearling shall the final beginning state of beastly exsistance find you learning those bovine pleasures. As a Charolais shall you grow and mature over the coming weeks, months and three years. Once attained the ripe age of physically a four year old bull the program has inserted a nano virus which will cause your humanity to reform. The only possible residue remaining from your bovine experience might be the retaining of those sexual parts, the ear lobes, and your tail. Now do have fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br />
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br />
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br />
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br />
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br />
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu<br />
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...................<br />

...............................BOINK.................................<br />
&quot;..............THE BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH ...........................!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben stood there his eyes transfixed on the bright blue screen as he knew the computer had just crashed. Plopping down on the chair he began to do a restart of his computer finding his fingers were not helping as they began to stiffen.<br />
<br />
The phone then rang and a poking of the intercom button allowed Ben to talk without picking up the reciever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maawoo !&quot; strained Ben to make words out of his growing and thickening lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there buddy, you sound pretty dull of wit, how's that program working out?&quot; asked John Killingsworth Ben's school chum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaa...an..ou..ah...hap..hooooow !&quot; came the twisted reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;God almighty bud you did something and got the program working but you don't sound to good, I'll be right over !&quot; said John as he hung up before Ben could utter another sound.<br />
<br />
Ben was feeling nausiated his stomach was in fact growing both in size and numbers. His chest and ribs began to expand while shoulders and arms were fast reacting to the computer Genie's magical spell.<br />
<br />
Even as his fingers changed to tan colored cloven hooves he continued to poke at the keyboard buttons.<br />
<br />
The restart took and soon he was on the internet but then his head took to the changes. Acheing horribly Ben held one cloven hoof to his head as the pain was becoming unbearable.<br />
<br />
Lips, grew as nostrils flared merging and making his new muzzel. Ben worked his thicker lips about as preprogramed attitudes began to replace learned human experiances. A large flat but thick tongue kept peeking out of Ben's nervous mouth. The tip curling up and slurping the runny snot from off his wide nostrils.<br />
<br />
Eyeing the screen was also becoming a problem as his head grew so also did his eyes move farther apart. Worse yet was the loss of colors and the his vision chaged from seeing a multi shades of gray to the common sight ability of a bovine bull. Red, blue, and pure white were the only colors he could see. His vision was now set for living within the bovine culture. If the grass were greener on the other side of the fence Ben could not tell. He saw things to be big or small, thin or wide and the movements color coded in thermal like views.<br />
<br />
As thoughts were becoming those of the common Charolais breed of bull Ben shook his large boned head as snot flung side to side.<br />
<br />
The chair suddenly gave up and collapsed sending Ben to the floor. Instead of human understanding the bovine mental posture made him angry. A scrable to rise up and meet his attacker was the basic thought at the moment. <br />
<br />
Now four legs and cloven hooves scrambled him to a standing position but not in any upright manner. He was in fact standing as a bull does much of its life, on all fours!<br />
<br />
The torn reminants of his clothing lay strewn about while the room was under the attack of a young angry bovine.<br />
<br />
The knock at the door stopped Ben in his tracks. He cocked his head podering the sound and then seeing the door open slowly. It was John hearing from outside the turmoil happening he wondered what he'd find inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben?&quot; came the obvious question as John stood in the doorway seeing before him a fine formed yearling Charolais breed bull.<br />
<br />
The computer lay on the floor by now the screen showing the first part of the program Ben had just restarted. The room and its furniture was tossed into disarray. A puddle of urine was in the kitchen still steaming and giving off both a horrid aroma plus steamy vapors. All around the room were turds and heaped flops of soft cow manure making the place stink like some feed lot pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben do you know me it's John, John Killingsworth?&quot; asked John being careful of his changed friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;MAARAOOOO!&quot; bellowed Ben his degraded mind thinking more like a true bovine but still for those first few moments retaining some fond memories of friends and places he liked.<br />
<br />
Standing then calmly there his long white boney tail swaying as if showing his sudden calmness, John walked by the bull. Setting up thre computer back on its stand John typed into it his code and then queried about Ben's ultimate form.<br />
<br />
Flickering screen and then came a red color and the Genie appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie what have you done to Ben?&quot; typed John into the query question space.<br />
<br />
Static crackle came over the side speakers still strewn on the dirty floor. Then from them came the voice of the helpful program Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ben, oh yes Ben the yearling Charolais bull! His choice but without any special directives to retain mind, memories, and or any human reasoning powers. He asked to be a bovine and when asked again chose from the viewing screen the Charolais breed. We, I acted on his choice making him as he no doubt is even now. He will remain as the bull, growing, maturing, and remaining for the next three years till his fourth rebirthday. Is there something wrong or would you care to join him in his pleasure seeking adventure?&quot; asked the Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Muurrrooooo!&quot; came a lowing sound from Ben as what little part of his human mind wanted John to know how he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO THANKS !&quot; typed John into the answer space.<br />
<br />
&quot;You answer is noted but if you wish I can resond to your questions verbally now!&quot; said the program's Genie with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie can you give him back some of his human memory and understanding?&quot; asked John as he looked at the heavy breathing bovine to his left.<br />
<br />
The screen turned all red and then began to run white lines this way and that till the Genie appeared within a small picture box in the middle of the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;We, I have now a mental printout of Ben's memory but it....&quot; said the Genie as he looked down and seemed to be reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;But what?&quot; asked John as the young bull feeling anxous took another hearty dump on the carpeted floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a bit scramble here but if you can get the bull to stand near and face the screen I believe he could regain some of this mess he had as a memory.&quot; came the offer from the Genie.<br />
<br />
John motioned with his left hand for Ben to come up and face the computer screen. <br />
<br />
A dull minded beast was about all that was left governing the movements of the bovine form standing in the room. Standing like a statue Ben did not approach the screen. His eyes were fixed on the screen as ears flopped about showing maybe his inner nervous attitude.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Ben, Ben,!&quot; plagued John to the bull standing there to his left.<br />
<br />
&quot;He must come up to the screen in now two minutes or the information will be lost!&quot; said the Genie with a smile.<br />
<br />
John looked around and then having an idea rushed out of the room to the kitchen. A thud and groan as he slipped in a heep of manure falling to the floor and then getting up he checked for something the bull might like to eat.<br />
<br />
A stalk of celery was worthy as a leader. he returned to the computer and held the stalk before the screen beckoning the young bull to come and take it. <br />
<br />
Ben saw only some odd blue thing but the screen's light seemed to warn him away.<br />
<br />
John turned and put the celery to Ben's nostrils letting the bull smell it and then moven it as Ben came closer to get his food. At the screen the time counter was down to just seconds from leaving Ben as a igronant bull for years to come. <br />
<br />
As the thick lips of the bull took part in eating the celery stalk the screen flashed and memories flooded into the thick boned head of Ben Charolais the bull.</p>
