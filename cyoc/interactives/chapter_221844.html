<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gazing at the handsome farmboy, Jill&#39;s couldn&#39;t help but feel her cheeks flush. &quot;How is he so hot? And respectful!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t help but laugh, Jillian&#39;s outburst being both hilarious and true. Ethan was a boy scout, a rugged, well mannered guy who any girl would be lucky to date. Simply watching him go about his chores made Jillian sigh dreamily. Still, the young couple could sense their work wasn&#39;t complete as they gazed at Ethan&#39;s former wife now grandmother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shes lonely isn&#39;t she,&quot; Jillian asked as she gazed at the old woman. &quot;I don&#39;t know why but, I can sense it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I sense it too,&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;When we rewrote reality we made her a widow. She&#39;s been lonely since her husband passed.&quot; A sad expression now formed on Jillian&#39;s face, her shoulders slumping as she studied the old woman. &quot;Is there anything we can do,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have some ideas,&quot; Jeff smirked. Quickly pulling out his phone he now brought up the Chronovac. Quickly pulling up Susan Cromwell&#39;s stats, Jillian gawked at what Jeff had planned.<br />

Execute? Yes/No<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to turn her into Ethan&#39;s kid sister,&quot; Jillian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems right,&quot; Jeff shrugged. &quot;And they&#39;re close enough in age that they should get along pretty well.&quot; Jillian furrowed her brow, her own feelings of having an older sibling made her wonder of Ethan would be protective of her to an extreme degree. She now wondered if that would also change Ethan. &quot;I guess we could try,&quot; she said softly. &quot;If it turns out poorly we can always change it up later.&quot; Jeff nodded in agreement, hitting the execute button as they now watched Susan&#39;s transformation with earnest.<br />
<br />
Susan&#39;s transformation started simply enough as she retreated through her sixties. The wrinkles in her face smoothing, her white hair slowly regaining some grey. By the time she hit 60 there was no white present in her grey locks. &quot;Wonder why she didn&#39;t color her hair,&quot; Jillian mused. &quot;I know my mom and aunts freak out whenever they see even a stray grey hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah my mom does the same thing,&quot; Jeff added. &quot;I think Mrs. Cromwell didn&#39;t really let that kind of thing bother her.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Susan now retreated through her fifties, Jeff and Jillian watched as her grey hair began to lighten, the grey gaining the lighter blonde hue of her youth. The womans posture now began to improve, Susan straightening her back. The couple watched as the womans skin began to look smoother, the creases in her forehead smoothing, her face drawing taught losing the saggy facial features of an elderly woman. By 50, the couple beheld a very fit woman with slight wrinkles around her mouth and eyes.<br />
<br />
The changes persisted, Susan&#39;s body slimming and regaining its firm form as she traveled back through her 40s. The young couple marveled as Susan&#39;s stomach began to flatten, the estra weight melting away as her breasts slowly began to rise into their previous D cup proportions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow she was in great shape when she was younger,&quot; Jillian stated in awe. Jeff nodded on agreement, the teen wondering if perhaps in her younger days she had helped her former husband with his work.<br />
<br />
Hitting 40 and racing for 30, the teens watched as Susan&#39;s physique continued to improve. Cellulite seemed to evaporate under her clothing, replaced by what the teens assumed was lean muscle. The womans breasts continued to rise, her hair regaining its golden blond luster as her face smoothed completely. By 30, both teens beheld a woman in her physical prime, possessing a fit, firm body, smooth unblemished face, and golden blonde hair that seemed to shimmer in the sun. <br />
<br />
As Susan hit 30 and began to race through her 20s the teens watched as her hazel eyes sparkled with youthful energy. Susan&#39;s hair was long, descending to the middle of her back and possessing more volume than either teen thought possible. A thought now began to filter through Jillian&#39;s mind, the teen wondering how difficult it must be to wash and maintain. Regardless, Susan appeared to take good care of it. &quot;I definitely need to find out what kind of shampoo she uses,&quot; Jillian thought.<br />
<br />
As Susan hit 20 and looked to travel through her teens in reverse, Jillian and Jeff marveled at the beauty before them. Susan was gorgeous, her face flawless with smooth skin and vibrant hair. The young woman&#39;s figure was amazing, firm D cup breasts, slight flare to her hips, and a flat stomach. Both teens noting she was incredible shape.<br />
<br />
As Susan descended through her teens, Jillian and Jeff watched as Susan&#39;s face began to round, her body losing some curve as her breasts slowly eroded under her clothes. When the girl hit 16, Jillian and Jeff beheld a very pretty teenage girl that the pair immediately equated with the stereotypical farmers daughter with a round, cute face, gorgeous long blonde hair and perky C cup breasts<br />
<br />
As the girl continued to dwindle in age, both Jillian and Jeff watched as her curves continued to diminish. Susan went from a fresh faced 15 year old to a coltish 14 year old to a cute 13 year old taking her first steps into womanhood. Inches and cup sizes melted away from the girl her formerly C cup breasts reducing to a pair of perky B cups then borderline B cups. By 13 Susan had shed several inches, standing a hair over five feet tall.<br />
<br />
As the regression slowed, Susan reached her final destination of twelve. The girl standing at barely five feet in height, her curves barely flared with softball sized breasts. Both teens now watched as Susan&#39;s clothing began to change, becoming a plain tshirt with a pair of blue jeans and converse sneakers. Both teens now stunned as Susan&#39;s long blonde hair began to transform into two long braided pigtails that fell over her shoulders. Coming out of her trance the preteen girl now called to her big brother, excitedly asking him questions. <br />
<br />
Reality now began cement itself, Jillian and Jeff now gaining a better picture of Ethan&#39;s spunky, energetic kid sister. &quot;Shes a tomboy,&quot; Jillian smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;And she&#39;s gonna turn heads in a couple of years. Hope Ethan&#39;s ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s be real here,&quot; Jillian smirked. &quot;Suzy can take care of herself. Remember that bully in sixth grade? The one that was bullying the quiet kid?&quot; Jeff now chuckled, the memory filtering into his mind. Suszy was a sweet natured girl, always sunny and treating everyone kindly. What she had no patience for though was bullies. When a shy girl in her class was getting picked on, Suzy had stood up to the girl, giving the bully a black eye and catching a week&#39;s detention. &quot;Good point,&quot; Jeff grinned. &quot;And she&#39;s also very protective of her big brother. Rose is gonna have her hands full.&quot;<br />
<br />
The young couple now began to laugh, each smiling broadly as they pondered what they should do next.</p>
