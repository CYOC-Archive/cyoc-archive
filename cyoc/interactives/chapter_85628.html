<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William Ledbetter was a veteran hunter and conservationist. He prided living off the land and preventing the Deer herds from overpopulating. It was with great pride that he brought his 8 year old son Brandon out for his first deer hunt.<br />
William had set up a plot, including an automatic feeder with corn, and automatic digital camera, and a tree blind that was easily accessible. He had carefully reviewed every Buck and Doe in the woods and was happy to help Brandon learn how to become a great conversationalist just like his Dad. William had carefully placed the most expensive &quot;Deer Rut&quot; he could find at his plot 30 yards ahead of their blind and when he saw the buck approaching, was perplexed to see a 25 point buck in the woods. The most he had previously seen in his camera footage was a 12 pointer. Whispering to his son, he said &quot;Brandon, carefully aim at the buck&#39;s heart and squeeze the trigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brandon&#39;s nerves got to him as he slightly pulled the barrel higher when he pulled the trigger. After a loud bang, William and Brandon saw the Buck was hit on the first shot and it appeared to be in the shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hit it Dad!, exclaimed Brandon loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you did son! Now lets go put him out of his misery so we can process the meat&quot;, said William.<br />
<br />
As they arrived at the deer, they noticed weird behavior. The deer was bleeding profusely from its shoulders, but appeared to have humanoid eyes instead of the dark bestial eyes. The deer carcass began to convulse, tremble, and make strange beeping noises much like the error code from a computer program.<br />
<br />
Brandon, noticing the noises, asked, &quot;Dad, did we kill some type of robotic deer? It sound like it is making the error messages that happen when a computer program is crashing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chronovac version 2 - Program Run Time Error - the subject&#39;s life support has ceased. Autocorr - e- c -t -i bzzippppppppppppppppp&quot; said the Deer carcass.<br />
<br />
With horror, both Dad and son watched as the Deer started to revert. First the form began to change into a Humanoid figure, going from fours to a bipedal creature. Next the hands started to grow digits, lose its brown fur, and turn into human flesh. They watched in horror as the deer continued to turn into what appeared to be an early teenager boy that was now dead.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh MY GOD&quot;, yelled Brandon, as he realized that he had killed a human. &quot;I swear I didn&#39;t mean to kill a human Dad!&quot;<br />
<br />
Watching in horror, William tried to do CPR, doing chest compressions and giving Jeff mouth to mouth to help him breath. &quot;Take off your shirt and press down pressure on this Wound!&quot; William barked to his son.<br />
<br />
As both Father and Son tried to save the now deceased Jeff, another announcement came from Jeff&#39;s Body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Autocorrecting - Change living subject back to previous settings. Duration - until threat has passed&quot;  Jeff&#39;s body started emitting an electrical shock from the wound site, shocking Brandon until it blasted him backwards.<br />
<br />
Brandon started feeling hot. he had a strange urge to shed their clothing, even though he was standing in front of his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, why do I feel so strange? It&#39;s like I&#39;ve been rolling around in grass all day.&quot; Brandon exclaimed as he began to itch all over. Brandon&#39;s dad watched in horror as fur started covering his son&#39;s previous pink skin. <br />
<br />
Brandon felt a strong pressure at his forehead as he began to sprout an impressive 25 pt rack. As he tried to feel his forehead, he noticed his fingers wouldn&#39;t manipulate like they previously did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! I&#39;m starting to grow antlers! What&#39;s happening to me?!Why aren&#39;t my fingers working?&quot;  Brandon yelled. <br />
<br />
William tried to help his son but helplessly watched as Brandon started to gain mass as his chest started to elongate. His son was turning into a Deer, the same animal that he had hunted and harvested for meat and skin for the past 30 years. He didn&#39;t know what to do and watched in awe as his son continued to change from a human boy to a healthy majestic adult buck.<br />
<br />
Brandon, realizing he was changing from human to a deer,  tried to cry out help to his dad. Unfortunately his vocal cords no longer worked like a human&#39;s and he frantically made the same sounds that a buck would make. As the changes finally came to an end, both William and Brandon looked at each other in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still there Brandon?&quot;, said William to his son.<br />
<br />
Snorting and kicking his feet to try to agree, Brandon motioned that he understood what his father had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how you just changed into a deer, or how a deer turned into a boy, but first thing we need to do is figure out what to do with his body and figure out how we will get you back home&quot;, William exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Thinking to himself, he said &quot;I think the announcement said something about a Chronovac. Maybe we can find the manufacturer and then find a solution to changing you back&quot;, said William.<br />
<br />
Both William and the Buck headed back towards their truck.<br />
<br />
William decided he would have to keep both him and his son safe until Deer season was over if he ever wanted to change back to a human. Motioning his son to follow, he went into the woods to what seemed like an excellent hiding spot that no hunter would ever find.</p>
