<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>By CAIN</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oscar was the first to awaken that next morning. He had fallen asleep, as he had always done with his son’s ever larger cock firmly rooted deep inside his ass as his muscular son’s cum slowly dribbled out of his wrecked hole. His son would often spoon him with his massive arms enveloping his small scrawny chest or his tree trunk legs wrapped around his thin stick legs. He felt safe like this, with this giant young muscle stud cuddled up behind him as his well-endowed dick slowly pumped out spurts of cum deep into his waiting hole.  The fact that it was his own son just turned him on all the more until he often shot a load of his own into the sheets without touching his own considerably large (but slightly smaller than his son’s) cock. Often during the night, his big stud of a son would roll over and lay flat on his back, taking up most of their shared bed with his sizable width. Meanwhile Oscar would either remain stationary lying on his side, or would curl up closer to his David’s massive pecs, hoping his son would put one lovingly massive arm around his smaller frame and pull him close. <br />
This morning, however, Oscar found himself lying flat on his back. What was more unusual, he was on the side of the bed closest to the window, instead of on the door side as David deemed was his father’s side, since David liked to sleep next to the open window as hot as he would get with his muscles being so swollen with blood constantly. At first, he thought maybe David got out of bed in the middle of the night and slept elsewhere, but he could sense him lying in bed with him, so somehow they switched sides during the night. <br />
The sun was already up, it being 7:10 that morning according to the clock on the dresser, and Oscar knew that he should get up and get David’s meals for the day ready so he wouldn’t get punished for disobedience. He knew it was wrong, being a slave, especially a sex slave, to his own son – even if his son looked like a junior bodybuilder now. He knew that inside that hunky walking wet dream was a boy only ten years old, even if he no longer acted like the little kid he was. Oscar felt a pang of regret, both for what he had been doing with his own son, as well as that his son missed so much of his childhood. David might enjoy being in charge now, but what happens when he wishes he could have enjoyed middle school, his first kiss with someone his own age, going to prom, picking out a college? Thanks to what that freaky woman did to him, he will rapidly grow until who knows what age – Oh no! What if he ages so fast he dies way too soon? He hoped that wasn’t going to be the case, he still loved his son, very much, and hoped that he could enjoy his life as much as he is able without having to worry about dying of old age in a few years. No, for now, he’d try not to think about it and just accept what is going on with them, and besides, truth be known, they both enjoyed their new relationship. David was everything Oscar could ever want in a man and more, and David really enjoyed how much his father worshiped and served him at all times and in all ways. <br />
Oscar stepped out of bed, quite a bit more loudly than he had planned to do. He didn’t want to wake his son just yet after all, David needed his rest because today he was interviewing to be a trainer manager at the local gym, after being a personal trainer for most of the last year. Oscar had no doubt with his impressive physique and alpha male charisma, that he would easily get the job. Oscar stretched and yawned, damn, his voice was sounding different; he hoped he wasn’t getting sick now. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes, and absent-mindedly scratched an itch on his chest. “What the…” Wide eyed he looked down because he no longer felt the light pelt of fur that normally covered his lean toned chest, instead his pecs were smooth as silk and more importantly, MASSIVE. “Oh shit… oh shit… oh shit… What the hell happened…?” He was panicking, thinking somehow his son would be mad at him that he was now as muscular as him now, not that his father intended this to happen, he just knew it would mean some sort of punishment from his son… But then his mind clouded over and he thought that was a stupid thing to think. Why the fuck would he care what his son or anyone thinks of him? He’s a man dammit, and if David doesn’t like it, he can just fuck right off! “Whoa” Oscar said to himself, “What the hell is wrong with me?” <br />
Oscar shook his head, closed his eyes, and tried to drown out the voice telling him to do things he didn’t normally enjoy – like putting submissive little bitches in their place, forcing them to serve him, and worship his body and cock. No no! Those are the opposite of what he likes, he needs to be dominated and humiliated, not the other way around! <br />
He heard stirring from the bed and turned around, and then he realized the truth. He wasn’t as massive as his son now, he was his son now! Because lying in the bed all this time was his own body, lean, underdeveloped, hairy – and looking so damn fuckable! “What? No! I need to get fucked! Me!” He thought to himself. But try as he might, his now 11 inches of throbbing hard man meat were ready to fuck something, and that exposed bubble ass and pink hole was looking damn good right about now, “and besides, he’s too small to fight me off anyway, right?” No, Oscar forced himself to resist, but it took all of his will power. Only once he made it into the master bathroom, closed, and locked the door behind him was he able to breathe again and relax. When he looked up and opened his eyes, there was David in the mirror (or at least him in David’s much improved body) looking back at him. While looking into his son’s gorgeous blue green eyes, Oscar shot his first load with his son’s massive cock without even touching himself. A half dozen large spurts made their way up from the plum sized balls and shot from where he was leaning against the door to the top of the mirror several feet away, with another half dozen more half that distance, and then several spurts oozing down the thick shaft of his cock getting caught in his bushy pubes. <br />
As Oscar came down from his orgasmic high, he realized two things. First, he needed a shower badly, not just because of the cum in his pubes, but because in this jacked teen body with all the testosterone it produces it smelled pretty damn ripe. Second, he needed to figure out how he was going to deal with David in his body now. Deep down he was still his father, so he was worried how David was going to cope with this new magical change thrust on them by probably that Madame Illusia again. And of course, he was also worried with how he was going to cope with this new change as well – Seeing as it was going to be unlikely he would ever be able to be submissive to David again – Not with this body and not with these thoughts telling me to be an alpha master…</p>
