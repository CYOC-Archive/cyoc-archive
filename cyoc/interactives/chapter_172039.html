<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Spookyville in general was considered a &quot;scary&quot; time for Animalia, there was one event that happened that was considered the scariest thing that ever happened. It was so scary that, if it hadn&#39;t been covered by News agencies, everyone would have thought that it was a Halloween Special for Fun and Fins, since that was where it was first covered.<br />
<br />
The episode began with Susan dragging Tzan out to the airfield to greet the newest visitors, much to Tzan&#39;s annoyance since she didn&#39;t like being woken up at &quot;six-o-stupid-clock in the morning&quot;, as she called it. But when they got to the new airstrip, it was clear that something was wrong with the airplane. It was descending too quickly if it wanted to land on the airstrip safely, or it was attempting to land in the ocean. But unfortunately a rogue wave clipped the wing causing a devastating crash.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the old tower from the military base air strip hadn&#39;t been changed too radically, and so was able to scramble an emergency response rather quickly. All of the aquatic Animalians (minus the sharks, for obvious reasons) began swimming out to rescue any and all survivors, while bird Animalians began coordinating them to where survivors were spotted, and various ships were deployed to rescue injured survivors.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, all of the crew members, and all but three of the passengers managed to escape death or serious injury, but once all the crew members and passengers were accounted for, the shark animalians began searching for the airplane&#39;s black box. Once it was found, quicker than expected due to the shark Animalians&#39; senses (Tzan and Brazen&#39;s senses especially, since they were the ones that found it), everyone was distinctly less sad for the dead bodies.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, the three dead bodies had hijacked what had originally intended to be a short, routine journey between China and Japan. Because of the short distance, the plane had not been completely fueled up. When the three terrorists (with one of them having smuggled a laptop loaded with Semtex, creating a makeshift bomb, to force compliance) hijacked the plane, they didn&#39;t believe the pilot and copilot when they said they didn&#39;t have enough fuel to go to their intended destination. But unfortunately, the pilot and copilot had spoken true and the engines had blown out before they could reach the terrorists&#39; destination. The pilots had attempted to land in the sea not far from Mieni when the rogue wave clipped the wing. But why everyone else survived the crash while the terrorists didn&#39;t was obvious, if a bit surprising.<br />
<br />
As it turned out, one of the passengers, a six-time world champion mixed martial artist in his native Sri Lanka, had excused himself to use the bathroom, but was actually setting himself up to take down all three terrorists. When one of the terrorists, who also happened to be the one who held the &quot;laptop-bomb&quot;, turned his back, the martial artist charged and knocked him down, causing the terrorist to lose hold on the bomb. When the terrorists attempted to come to their companion&#39;s aid, the martial artist took them down before they could fire their guns. Another passenger, who had duct tape in his carry-on, managed to tape their arms, legs, and mouths to keep them from doing any more harm. Ironically enough, it was their taped limbs and mouths that lead to their deaths when the plane crashed in the ocean not far from Mieni.<br />
<br />
As for why the martial artist was on the plane, he said that he was only stopping over in Japan before moving on to Heiya Island to visit (and possibly pick up) his younger sister, whom was one of the girls rescued from the human trafficking ring. He hadn&#39;t expected the plane to be hijacked, but his martial arts training prevented a large number of deaths.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
After the injured were treated (none needing conversion to survive) an official statement was released to the public. While it wasn&#39;t important in America due to the elections, it still was something big. The official who covered the martial artist taking down the three terrorists made sure to state his stance on it quite clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not something we recommend. In this case, it was a good outcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
While the plane crash was an expensive loss, the fact that there was comparably little loss of life was a cause for celebration, and with Halloween close around the corner, it was decided to host a spooky/haunted-themed luau for all the survivors.<br />
<br />
Overall, while this was no &#39;Miracle on the Hudson&#39;, most would claim that this was the best case scenario for something like this.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
While some would have called the whole thing a Halloween-themed, a video taken by a survivor from inside the plane helped debunk it quite quickly. While originally intended for social media, it was handed over to authorities for investigation before being cleared for release later. It showed the three terrorists taking control, the Sri Lankan man taking the terrorists down, then the plane crashing into the water. Miraculously, the iPhone that recorded the video had survived without getting wet or damaged.<br />
<br />
When it finally appeared, viewership of the video skyrocketed and the person who recorded the video became a medium-level internet celebrity though not enough to become an internet influencer, though that wasn&#39;t her intention.</p>
