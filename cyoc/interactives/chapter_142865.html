<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jett stared at Tuck in disbelief; in front of him was no longer a stocky cub, but rather a stocky minotaur. Staring back at him was a human with a bull’s face, ears, and horns. Tuck’s dark black hair had coated his entire body in a short, thick fur that grew slightly thicker around his wrists and ankles. He was still a 440lbs beast of a man, one with hooves, horns, and a tail to boot.<br />
<br />
‘This must be the Chronovac’s doing,’ thought Jett. He looked at the tablet in his hand. The last command sporting a green check mark next to it:<br />
<br />
>> INTERPRETED COMMAND: SPLICE WITH BULL GENETICS<br />
    <br />
<br />
Jett looked over at Pike. The same thing had happened to his other cub, now a stocky brown bull, naked with hefty balls hanging between his legs. The thong he had been wearing was shredded, too much for his new bovine endowment. Behind him, a thin tail swished back and forth idly.<br />
<br />
“Master? Is everything ok? You look startled!” Tuck reached out with a furred hand and put it on Jett’s shoulder, concerned for his master.<br />
<br />
“Y-you guys didn’t notice...what happened to you?” Jett stuttered nervously as the beast grabbed his shoulder. The hand was gentle and familiar, Tuck’s thick fingers exactly yet covered in black fuzz.<br />
<br />
“What happened to us? What do you mean, Master? Nothing’s changed!” said Pike. He tried to remain calm, but was becoming antsy as he saw his Master start to panic. “Oh! The thong! I’m so sorry Master, it ripped as we were walking to Dan’s room! I know it was a gift, I promise I will replace it and take care of the new one even better!”  Pike got on his knees and hung his head, groveling, his bull balls resting on the ground now. <br />
<br />
Jett hesitated for a moment. Were they aware of their changes? “Y’know, I don’t know how to say this....you two are, well...you’re bulls and-”<br />
<br />
Jett was cut off abruptly by Tuck. “Master, of course we’re bulls! You knew this the moment you laid eyes on us and decided to make us your own! I know they say bulls are stupid, but come on now, give us some credit, Master!” Tuck ribbed Pike as he stood up, who was looking more relieved now that Jett was apparently joking around.<br />
<br />
“I...err, yeah! Just making sure you two boys were paying attention! And don’t interrupt me again, Tuck!” Jett scolded the black cow, trying to play off his panic with a command. “It doesn’t look like Dan has anything of value here other than his tablet. I think it’d be fun to mess with his fantasy football team as a prank...maybe I’ll put my own team together and he will be impressed when my new team wins big for him! Come!” Jett motioned with his for his hand to fall in line, and with the bulls in tow, left Dan’s dormitory.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The walk back to Jett’s room was nerve-wracking. He kept an eye out for gawking classmates and panicked stares, but no one mentioned anything about the two bull men following him. Jett had grabbed Pike one of Dan’s many thongs to wear as they walked back to their dorm, which barely contained his massive package. Both bulls kept their eyes lowered and strutted quickly behind their master, hoping not to be ambushed by handsy strangers. Soon, Jett entered his dormitory, the doors held open by his bovine brutes. His heart jumped as he walked into the hallway, a ginger Scottish longhorn bull sitting at the front desk. Jimmy, an offensive guard and part of his football team, was supposed to be there.<br />
<br />
“Captain! Boys! How’s it going dudes? Getting ready for practice later?” Jett froze; he made more than two bulls? How was it possible?<br />
<br />
It suddenly hit him: Jimmy was 560 lbs. and 6’3” of massive ginger meat, very small for an offensive guard, but within the Chronovac’s specifications to make everyone a bull. Everyone on the football team, that is. Jett opened his mouth to speak but was interrupted by his boys, rushing over to the desk to give their pal a high-five.<br />
<br />
“Jimbo! You ready to get taken down later? I’ve been hitting the gym hard this week!” The suddenly boisterous Tuck waddled over to the desk with Pike as they greeted their teammate, flexing a meaty bicep and showing off his bicep until he realized he was wearing just a thong. He blushed and put down his arm. His boys were more comfortable around their teammates who they saw naked in the locker room daily, but still embarrassed at the revealing clothing their master made them wear.<br />
<br />
Jett closed his eyes with a sigh of relief and then put on a confident face. “Boys, door!” He snapped his fingers and the two standing bulls rushed over to the doors, pulling them wide for Jett to enter.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Master!” the stocky bulls yelled, standing at attention next to the doors as they were commanded. Jett was puzzled. Normally his boys were much better at serving him. Had they become more inept when the Chronovac spliced their human DNA with bull’s?<br />
<br />
“Looks like we’ll have to do some conditioning before practice. See ya later, Jimbo.” The bull’s cocks twitched in their skimpy thongs, the thought of behavioral conditioning making them moo in pleasure. Jett raised a hand, waving goodbye to Jimmy and led his boys up to the room they shared.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
“You boys embarrassed me in front of Jimmy! Knees, NOW!” Jett yelled at the two bulls as soon as they were through the door. Their behavior was unacceptable, they never acted like this. Did their personality change when the bull DNA was sliced with their own? Rather than condition them, Jett had another plan in mind for his disobedient cows.<br />
<br />
“You two will strip and stand at attention, legs spread, hands behind your back. You will not speak, you will not move, you will not make a sound, understood?” Jett scowled as the two bulls assumed their designated position. Fully on display, exactly what Jett wanted. Now he could experiment.<br />
<br />
Jett sat down on the couch, facing the young bulls. They stared forward intently, not daring to move a muscle. Tuck was having a difficult time, shaking a bit as he caught his eyes drifting every few seconds. It was as if their attention span shorted drastically as soon as they changed.<br />
<br />
Jett browsed through the tablet, the Chronovac’s UI incredibly familiar and intuitive, yet strangely foreign to him. What was Dan doing with this device? Dan’s short, studly body flashed into Jett’s mind and he sighed, pining for the sexy cub. He would get him yet, but not before Jett could make him jealous!<br />
<br />
Jett brought up both Pike and Tuck’s profiles. In it, all their stats, personal history, thoughts, and dreams were listed. Jett couldn’t stand reading it all, he wasn’t some nerd. He opened a new command window and started typing.<br />
<br />
>> make pike and tuck incredibly embarrassed to be out in skimpy clothes or to be seen naked. I want them aroused by it too.<br />
With a push of the enter button, the tablet immediately spit out a response.<br />
<br />
>> INTERPRETED COMMAND: PERSONALITY AND FETISH ALTERATIONS...SAVED<br />
<br />
The room rippled with energy slightly, but the bulls stayed in place, obeying their master for the time being. Jett wanted to test out his new alteration.<br />
<br />
“Tuck, you have permission to speak when spoken to. I have a question for you...how do you feel about wearing a skimpy thong on the beach?”<br />
<br />
Tuck visibly trembled at the question, thinking of all the laughs and stares he would get for wearing such revealing clothing. The moment he did though, his cock shot straight up, erect, wanting the humiliation. He had always been so conflicted; he wants to please his master by wearing revealing clothing, but he is so self-conscious. It causes him great stress but such good pleasure. A double edged sword.<br />
<br />
The question piqued Pike’s interest too, his own cock hardening and starting to drip. He had always been the more eager bull.<br />
“S-sir! I would love that, Sir!” Tuck stammered in response to Jett’s question. <br />
<br />
“You’re not lying to me, Tuck, are you?” Jett stared Tuck in his eyes, watching them dart away for a second. He was obviously uncomfortable with the thought, but Jett knew it would cause him a mixture of pleasure and pain to dress as a slut on the beach.<br />
<br />
“No Sir! I would never lie to you!” The words almost got caught on the way out of Tuck’s mouth.<br />
<br />
“Good. You may go back to attention. No more talking.” Jett waved his hand and Tuck fell back into attention. It seemed the Chronovac worked its magic flawlessly. Now to make it impossible for the bulls to escape their new fetish.<br />
<br />
>>replace all of pike and tuck’s clothes with the following: Thongs, jocks, bikini briefs, wrestling singlets and crop tops.<br />
<br />
>>INTERPRETED COMMAND: LIFESTYLE ALTERATION...SAVED<br />
<br />
The air shimmered more dramatically, the most intense coming from the bulls’ shared room. No doubt their clothing had all turned into underwear and form-fitting singlets. No more shirts or pants for his boys. They would love, and hate, every second of it!<br />
<br />
Jett stroked his chin. Why stop at how they dress? He could change anything about his bulls, even their bodies. He knew just what to do.<br />
<br />
>>increase pike and tuck’s ball diameter to 17”. Shrink pike’s cock to 10” in length but make it thick and fat. Make tuck’s cock 12”, uncut, with a tiny head. Both are very concerned about their tiny cocks.<br />
<br />
Jett sneered at his screen and submitted his command. <br />
<br />
>>INTERPRETED COMMAND: PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ALTERATIONS...SAVED<br />
<br />
Jett looked up, eagerly awaiting the changes to take effect. The shimmering of shifting realities started again, and Jett watched the sack on both bulls engorge to be obscenely large. Their cocks were also altered, both losing precious length. Pike’s grew big and fat, looking a lot stubbier than it actually was against his gigantic balls. He saw Tuck’s grow a foreskin, causing Jett to shiver in anticipation. He groped his cock through his pants, squirting a jet of pre into his jock.<br />
<br />
After the changes completed, Jett stood up to inspect his work. He walked over, taking a sack in each hand and squeezed. Pitiful moos escaped each bull’s mouth, both yearning for release. These pent up balls ought to be full of seed. He dropped each sack, the jiggling mass drooping low and sending shivers up each boy’s spine.<br />
<br />
“Have I told you boys how much I would love to show you off at the gym?” Each bull shuddered and grew erect at the mere mention of being flaunted in public. The two whimpered and cast their eyes to the ground, afraid to look their sadistic master in the eye.<br />
<br />
“I know you two aren’t fans public display, but I love showing off my two handsome bulls!” Jett turned around and sat back down on the couch, mulling over what changes to his boys he would make next.<br />
<br />
An alarm on his phone went off and Jett looked at the time. 4:00pm...they were late to practice!<br />
<br />
“Alright boys, that will do for now. Slip on your tightest jocks and lets get on that field!” Jett got up and smacked each bull on the ass and headed towards the door, tablet in hand.</p>
