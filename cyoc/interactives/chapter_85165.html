<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jimbo took Dotsy&#39;s hand and then suddenly jumped up and knocked the angel clown down, grab some clothes and ran for the stairs with Dotsy in tow. They raced down the stairs and out the door of the club completely naked, if two naked clowns running out the door was unusual nobody stopped them not even the bouncers. They ran down the street, luckily it was the middle of the night and no one was around, they dove into an alley.<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t want to be a clown forever, right Dotsy?&quot; Jimbo asked looking at Dotsy who seemed scared out of her mind.<br />
&quot;NO&quot; Dotsy looked at Jimbo like he was an idiot for even think such a thing.<br />
Jimbo handed her the clown clothes and began to put his on.<br />
&quot;These will have to do for now, let’s just get out of her and back to the boats&quot;<br />
Dotsy got dressed and looked back around the corner for people chasing them but seeing nobody, which see thought was very odd, thought maybe they were being paranoid or misunderstood. Dotsy grabbed Jimbo&#39;s hand and head the other direction down the alley. They ran through the twisting turning streets not recognizing anything just running. They ran down a street and nearly ran into a clown in her night dress but they skid to a stop like a cartoon characters and took off in another direction. They came out of a street and were back where they started at the club. Gitsy and Maki were outside and waved at them. Jimbo tugged Dotsy of in another direction trying desperately to find their way out of the city. Again they ran through the city trying to take a straight path to anywhere as long as it wasn&#39;t Clown City. They came to a intersection and again were back at the club. This time the clown angel was out front with Gitsy and Maki and they all waved at them. Dotsy pulled Jimbo back and in to a alley.<br />
&quot;Now we know why they weren&#39;t chasing us, there isn&#39;t a way to leave.&quot; Dotsy said breathing hard from all the running.<br />
&quot;No, there has to be a way to leave.&quot;<br />
It was getting earlier in the day and clown were starting to wake up to start their day. Dotsy looked out on to the street and saw more clowns on it. She looked over at Jimbo to ask what they should do and suddenly had a thought.<br />
&quot;Why are we running and hiding? We look like clowns we can just blend in to the crowd and find a way out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good idea&quot; Both of them started to walk down the street calmly trying to act normal, or normal for a clown. Several of the clowns greeted them with &quot;good morning&quot; before one fell in step with them.<br />
&quot;Good morning. Heading to the party work center too?&quot; The clown asked Dotsy and Jimbo who had no idea what he was asking just shook their heads in agreement.<br />
&quot;Yea, All the good parties go first the ones where you can &#39;entertain&#39; the adults as well.&quot; He got a dreamy look on his face as he said this.<br />
&quot;So I always head there and get a good one. You two look pretty hot so you probably do well at those parties. Did you guys want to come over after work and we can &#39;entertain&#39; each other?&quot;<br />
Jimbo and Dotsy looked at each other and thought the same thing; the parties had to be held in people’s homes which mean there was a way out. Also that they were being hit on by another clown and it was turning them on more than they wanted.<br />
With difficulty Jimbo replied &quot;Sorry, we have other plans tonight&quot;<br />
The clown looked sad, or as sad as you could with a permanent smile on your face and they followed him to the party work center.<br />
The came up on a brightly colored building with a large amount of balloons flying outside, a large picture of a birthday a cake outside and a line of clowns going in. They stood in line behind the clown that hit on them and Jimbo couldn&#39;t help but stare at his crotch thinking of that cock going in and out of his ass. He shook his head and tried to think of other things and look over at Dotsy and saw her staring too, he nudged her to snap her out of it. They came up to a booth manned by a clown.<br />
&quot;Hiya, what kinda of party would you like? Adult or Child&quot; the clown asked already reaching for a pile<br />
&quot;umm, children’s party&quot; The clown stopped and looked shocked, Jimbo and Dotsy started to panic.<br />
&quot;Something in San Francisco&quot; Dotsy adds<br />
&quot;Oh, ok most clown this early want the good parties for &#39;entertaining&#39; adults.&quot; she hands Jimbo a card still looking confused. They followed the line of clowns to a turnstile where they were swiping them and the portal behind it would change color before they would walk through it. They came up to their turn and Dotsy swiped the card and the portal turned blue, they held hands and step through. They came out in the back of a shop with a hobo clown behind a counter.<br />
&quot;Hey guys just grab a car and have fun today&quot; the hobo waved them through. As they walked out they saw the bay bridge, they were home. <br />
Dotsy hugged Jimbo &quot;We&#39;re home, let’s get out of here&quot; Jimbo looks around and sees a bunch of clown cars parked out to the side.<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t fit in those&quot; Jimbo points out<br />
&quot;We might, clowns do all the time and we need a ride&quot; Dotsy counters<br />
Jimbo walks over and opens the door and pokes his head in. On the inside it was larger, larger than most SUVs, he looked in the back and it looked like it could fit 20 comfortably. He got out and laughed the sound increasing the tingles through his body causing spikes of pleasure.<br />
&quot;Well, we could fit. Hop in&quot;<br />
Jimbo drive them home, their car gaining a lot of attention on the way with people pointing and laughing. They pulled up in front of their apartment and were about to get out Dotsy stopped them. <br />
&quot;We can&#39;t go in there like this. What do we tell people?&quot; she asks<br />
&quot;Ummm, we can tell them we were learning to be clowns, I guess.&quot;<br />
&quot;Let’s just get in as fast as we can and take a shower to wash all this off&quot;<br />
They quickly exited the car and ran in the build and straight into one of their five year old neighbors.<br />
&quot;CLOWNS!!!!!&quot; he yelled excitedly &quot;Mom, Dad there are clowns here&quot; The parents came out Jimbo and Dotsy knew them and talked to them once a while.<br />
&quot;Hey. Jon, Alexis? I didn&#39;t know you were clowns.&quot; She looked them up and down and got &#39;that&#39; smile on her face. Dotsy felt a itch start in her pussy as her eyes found the mom&#39;s crotch.<br />
&quot;Yea, we decided to learn about being a clown&quot; Jimbo replied<br />
&quot;Great&quot; the Dad, Mr. Johnson, walked out of the apartment and over to Jimbo &quot;Tommy loves clowns and would love you two at his birthday party. You can &#39;entertain&#39; the whole family. We can pay you well.&quot; The dad&#39;s hands found Jimbo&#39;s ass and started to squeeze it. Jimbo felt himself harden and could barely contain himself.<br />
&quot;Yea, sure. We need to get going&quot;<br />
&quot;Ok, Tonight&quot;<br />
&quot;YEAAAAAAAA&quot; Tommy yelled in excitement<br />
They made their way into their apartment, when the door closed Dotsy turned on Jimbo.<br />
&quot;Why did you say yes?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, I could think straight. Lets take a shower and get clean up at least we are home.&quot;<br />
They took a shower together and the sight of their naked clown bodies was to much for them and they had clown sex in the shower and learn two things. One Clown sex in the shower is amazing and two the clown makeup doesn&#39;t wash off no matter how hard they scrubbed.<br />
&quot;What do we do Jimbo? We can&#39;t go out like this. I can&#39;t go to work like this.&quot; Jimbo and Dotsy lived paycheck to paycheck.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. We have to get back to normal.&quot;<br />
&quot;What do we do for money?&quot;<br />
Both of them look at each other and the realization sunk in.<br />
&quot;At least we escaped.&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess we have to go to the party tonight. Just once, to get some money.&quot; Dotsy and Jimbo both got horny just thinking about it.<br />
<br />
The angel clown stood outside their apartment complex holding the card that Jimbo had discarded, she glanced down and read it.<br />
