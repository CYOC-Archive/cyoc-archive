<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Might I interest you in something else?”<br />
<br />
Adrien was sure that there was plenty in this shop that would interest him, but he was already weary of the price he had paid for his first ‘purchase’. He gave back the soulstone and answered, “No, that will be all. Goodbye”<br />
<br />
“Very well, enjoy your purchase,my young friend. We WILL see each other again,” was the last Adrien heard before he closed the door and left the shop. <br />
<br />
It took some time for the teenager to get home. After feeling magic for the first time in his life, it was like his eyes opened to something that they previously just hadn’t seen. The confusing alleys were now easily recognized as not being part of his town and the blond teenager was sure that there was something that was luring people there. Most anyone was walking around with confusion apparent on their face and those who weren’t… well they only made the place seem stranger.<br />
<br />
But once the sun was starting to set, Adrien finally reached a familiar place in his hometown. From there it was not even an hour home and soon he unlocked the door to the house his parents had bought before his mother’s death. He heard someone in the kitchen and expected his father to be there. Once inside he placed the wooden box below his desk.<br />
<br />
A sudden knock on the open door of his room startled him.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m sorry Adrien, I didn’t want to startle you,” said a female voice.<br />
<br />
Adrien turned around and recognized the redheaded woman. Her name was Tina Miller, a woman in her late 30s. His father had befriended her a few months ago. Her face was as pretty as her personality was warm, and she was a bit pudgy. Adrien thought that his dad actually wanted a new relationship, but couldn’t admit it to himself, let alone her. The blond teenager got along quite well with her as well as with her nephew James Miller, who lived with her.<br />
<br />
“Well, first things first: Hi Adrien! I‘m glad you came home already. I thought I’d miss you since you went out with your friends,” Tina continued.<br />
<br />
“Evening, Tina. I didn’t realize that you were visiting,” he answered pushing the box deeper under his desk with his foot.<br />
<br />
She noticed the teenager’s movement and teased, “Bought something your dad wouldn’t approve of?”<br />
<br />
“Kind of, please don’t tell him,” came the answer. Adrien was hoping that being honest would work better than telling an obvious lie.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, you’re old enough to decide for yourself what you do. As long as it isn’t drugs. It’s not drugs, right?” she asked, only half serious.<br />
<br />
“Course not… Can we talk about something else?” he said, hoping that she would get to the point.<br />
<br />
“Aaanyway, what I wanted to tell you was, that your father and I are going to the week long congregation together,” Tina said.<br />
<br />
“Wait, you want to spend an entire week there? Dad’s pretty weird and he is the most normal one of them,” Adrien said before he could stop himself. It was weird that she would volunteer for this. He also wondered why she was telling him.<br />
<br />
“I promised Thomas… I promised your dad that I would give it a shot… plus I won’t stay the entire week. I’ll be back Sunday evening.” She admitted. ”But that’s obviously not why I wanted to talk to you. You know that Jim usually stays with me, but he can’t stay in my apartment this… you know what? It’s a long story. To cut it short, it would really help me if he could stay here with you this weekend.”<br />
<br />
Normally this wouldn’t bother Adrien, James was decent company. He sometimes took Adrien along to parties and vouched for him whenever Adrien’s father was being nosy. This weekend, however, was different. Still, he couldn’t tell her ‘no’ because that would be very strange after he tried to hide the box from her.<br />
<br />
“Why are you asking me? It’s dad’s house not mine,” he tried. Maybe his dad would be against it?<br />
<br />
“I’ve asked Thomas, and he said yes, but it’s not him who is going to spend the weekend here now, is it?” Tina pointed out.<br />
<br />
Adrien tried to look casual and shrugged his shoulders, “It’s fine by me.”<br />
<br />
Before he could say anything else, the redhead stepped inside and hugged him tightly. “You are a treasure Adrien. Thank you so much!”<br />
<br />
After a few more words, she left the teenager alone for the evening. Later his father came by and told him the same thing, only he didn’t make it sound like Adrien had any choice in the matter. More like he should be grateful that his dad’s faith provided him with the opportunity to get closer to ‘Ms Miller’s boy’. On days like this, he thought that his father didn’t deserve a kind woman like Tina.<br />
<br />
And then he was gone. It was Friday evening, Adrien and Jim, as most of his friends and acquaintances called him, were cleaning up the kitchen after having dinner. <br />
<br />
“So, what are your plans for tonight, Jim?” Adrien asked. The now 21 year old Jim was dressed well-enough to go out, but that didn’t mean much with him. He was a bit vain than it came to his appearance. It probably took quite a bit of effort to pull off his fit-but-lean look.<br />
<br />
“I’ll Probably watch something on Netflix. Not really in the mood to go out… what about you?” he answered, dashing Adrien’s hope that he might have the house to himself.</p>
