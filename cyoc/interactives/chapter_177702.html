<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While there was no back-up of his old body, Aidan could memorize it enough to turn his now clothes body back. But that would mean he had to remove his body-parts from Mark, with would give him control back. “Not gonna happen.” Aidan thought, and started to work.<br />
<br />
While Aidan worked, Mark felt hopeless. Aidan had now done to him what he had tried to do to Aidan himself, controlling and torturing him. He hated being helpless, but that he was right now.<br />
<br />
As Aidan reworked his body, he modified it a bit. More muscles and less fat on his stomach. A bigger cock and balls again. It wasn´t as easy as he hoped, but after an hour and a half he was satisfied with his rework. A quick switch to Mark´s profile let him edit a few things. Mark wouldn´t be able to use the chronivac again, and he was to obey any order Aidan gave him. Yes, he would be free again, but with no real control over others.<br />
<br />
Mark was surprised when Aidan started to strip his body. Would he be dumb enough to free Mark? When the last piece, the underwear, dropped, Mark had control again. He started to laugh in relieve, but that was short-lifed. “Mark, rearrange my body on my bed, so everything is where it belongs. Afterwards wait and watch.” Aidan´s voice came from the phone. And to his horror, Mark obeyed. He took the heap of clothes that was Aidan´s actual body and spread it on Aidan´s bed. <br />
<br />
Then he started placing each part. The shoes down, above it the jeans, backpack and belt on top of the zipper of the jeans. The jacket followed, the shirt inside of it, with the undershirt inside of it as well. The watch was placed in the right place for the heart inside the undershirt. From the sleeves down came first the gloves, then the socks, while above the neck opening laid the scarf. Finally, he placed the underwear above the scarf, the phone above that and covered it with the cap.<br />
<br />
When Aidan felt everything in place he called out: “Activate recreation”. It sounded slightly muffled by the cap, but the voice input from the laptop’s micro picked it up, activating the change. Before Mark´s eyes the clothes reformed into a human body somewhat resembling Aidan, if looking more fit and with better gear.<br />
<br />
Aidan opened his eyes and sat up. He moved his body, bending his fingers and wiggling his toes just for the sake off being able to again. Satisfied, he stood up, mustering himself in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Mark just stood there, frozen in place. He wanted to either flee or turn Aidan again, but couldn´t. He watched Aidan mustering himself for a minute or two before he turned to him. “Now Mark, how do I look?” he asked, and Mark responded with: “Better than the old you. What have you done to me?”<br />
<br />
Aidan laughed at him. “I just made sure you wouldn´t control me again. Instead, you are forced to obey my commands. Did you really think I would just free you after getting a body back? You can move freely again.”<br />
<br />
Mark´s eyes widened as he regained control. “What now? Knock Aidan out, try the laptop or flee?” Mark turned and bolted for the laptop. As Aidan watched he stopped, not understanding the program anymore. His confusion must have shown, because Aidan laughed as he came over. “You are unable to use the program. It was a safety decision for me.”<br />
<br />
Mark wanted to punch Aidan, who by now stood just behind him, but his hand slowed millimeters before connecting. Aidan grinned. “No, you are also unable to harm me. But for trying, hmm…. Let´s see. Mark, you will give me a BJ right now and swallow everything.”<br />
<br />
Mark wanted to scream that he wouldn´t do something like that, but his body did so on his own. He dropped to his knees after turning to face Aidan, took his cock and started to suck on it. Aidan moaned in pleasure, grabbing into Mark´s hair. It didn´t take long for him to shot his load down into Mark´s mouth. And Mark, much to his own disgust, swallowed the cum.<br />
<br />
After releasing Mark, Aidan took a step back, mustering Mark who still knelt before him. “You know, even if you were cruel to me, I have a crush on you Mark. So, two ground rules before you can go home. First, you can´t tell anybody about the chronivac or any changes made with it. And second, from now on, you will be my boyfriend.”<br />
<br />
Mark wanted to scream, but for some unknown reason couldn´t. The only thing he did was nodding before standing up. After a minute in silence, just starring at Aidan, who had now turned to the laptop, he asked: “Why can´t I scream at you?”<br />
<br />
Aidan didn´t turn as he answered: “Its included in the not harming me. After all, if you scream too much, it could harm my ears” Aidan laughed a bit. “Now, I thought you wanted to go home?”<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, before realizing a problem. “Ähm… Aidan, I don´t have any clothes I could wear now.” He was too damn calm and nice to Aidan.<br />
<br />
Aidan turned and looked at him grinning. “Oh yeah, I forgot. You placed your old clothes in my balls turned backpack, and we didn´t remove them before I changed back. That means your clothes have changed into my cum, with you have swallowed. And my clothes won´t fit you. I guess you will go home naked then, right? So, now go.” <br />
<br />
Mark turned as red as a tomato, but couldn´t disobey Aidan´s command to go. So, he went out naked. And run, as fast as he could, ignoring any comment made about him. Some part of him thought it was a fitting punishment.</p>
