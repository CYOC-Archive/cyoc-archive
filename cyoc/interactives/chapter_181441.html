<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lyle looked around frantically trying to piece together his options. If only he&#39;d kept the comforter on him he could have used it to clean up his mess. Now all he had at his disposal was the shirt on his back... He didn&#39;t have a choice. He could either go shirtless or be discovered lounging in a pool of his own jiz fountain... <br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Lyle shucked his shirt off over his head, trying his best not to move his pelvis or jiggle his tender bits... While removing the shirt, some of his cream rubbed off onto his face and hair, but using the clean insides of the shirt, he wiped that stuff off right away. He did his best to wipe down every other jiz covered surface in his vicinity and paid special care to get his Mom&#39;s tablet clean, before shoving the nasty cum-rag of a shirt deep into the cushions of the recliner to be dealt with later.<br />
<br />
Lyle took a moment to relax from all the excitement and bask in the remaining afterglow of his earlier release. It was kind of nice feeling the breeze from the fan on his naked upper body... He had always hated being shirtless, but with nobody around he might as well enjoy it. Besides, when his mom got home he&#39;d have to play it off like it was a totally natural thing for him to do, otherwise she might get suspicious and ask for his shirt for laundering. It was in his own best interest to get comfortable being in nothing but boxers for the foreseeable future...<br />
<br />
Lyle was frittering the time away playing mini-games on the tablet when his mom finally returned home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sweetie... Are you still feeling so hot?&quot; His mom said, seeing him sat shirtless in the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhuh.&quot; He replied weakly &quot;But the fan really helps... Thanks mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, honey.&quot; She said, feeling his face and around his bare glistening chest. &quot;You don&#39;t feel warm but you sure are sweating a lot... Better drink up some of these sports drinks I bought you so you don&#39;t get dehydrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyle had to suppress the urge to scrunch his face and grimace at being touched, but his mom seemed oblivious to his discomfort at being exposed...<br />
<br />
&quot;I got the egg whites like you wanted. I guess there was a bit of a rush on them at the store because they were completely out of the generic egg whites and they were already running really low on the name brand... The lady at the checkout counter assumed they must have been on sale, so many people were buying them... I bought four 32oz cartons so that should last a good long while... One whole egg only has about 1oz of white in it so that&#39;s 128 eggs worth... Plus I got some fresh eggs and we can separate the whites from those ourselves if we need a few extras at some point.&quot; She said, seeming pleased with the arrangement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s only enough for a couple meals! Don&#39;t you get it... I&#39;m REALLY hungry... I&#39;m going to need at least two cartons EVERY day.&quot; Lyle replied with irritation looking at the little quarter-gallon cartons. The same visceral feelings of seething anger were welling up inside him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;The store is running out and you didn&#39;t even bother to load up with everything they had?! Who knows when they&#39;ll be back in stock. God Damn it MOM!&quot; Lyle shouted slamming his fist angrily into the arm rest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lyle Allen Winters, what has gotten into you?&quot; His mom replied in shock. &quot;You do NOT speak to me that way. The doctor said you&#39;d be dealing with some elevated hormones but this is totally unacceptable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;UUUGH, It&#39;s not HORMONES! You can&#39;t fucking do anything right, and I&#39;m stuck here in this shitty-ass chair sweating my aching balls off. I haven&#39;t eaten all day and all I wanted was some daily egg white protein and some god damn SALSA!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely hormones...&quot; his mother thought to herself, silently turning and leaving the room without a further word.<br />
<br />
Lyle tried to calm down but it was impossible... Obviously his mom was in the wrong here... What was she thinking? It&#39;s not not like egg whites are even expensive, he hadn&#39;t asked for steak or lobster, just some crappy-ass egg whites!<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before his mom returned with a large salad bowl filled with scrambled egg whites slathered in medium salsa. His mouth was watering at the sight, he was desperate to get some protein in him...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry mom... For earlier I mean...&quot; Lyle said feeling his usual calmness start to return to him at the prospect of getting a good bit of food. &quot;Maybe it is hormones... I don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know honey. You&#39;ve been through a lot.. Get some food in you, it&#39;ll help.&quot; She replied, trying to extend the boy some extra leeway under the circumstances.<br />
<br />
Lyle devoured the eggs quickly with gusto. It was the best thing he&#39;d ever tasted! How long had it been since he&#39;d last eaten? They say hunger is the finest sauce but there&#39;s no reason egg whites should ever be so tasty... His body had CRAVED egg whites and now that he was finally feeding that craving, his body was reacting with elation and deep satisfaction, but as he finished the bowl he knew it wasn&#39;t enough. He needed more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?! I&#39;m still hungry... Uh, was that all the eggs?&quot; Lyle shouted with trepidation, trying not to push his luck with his mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was only half a carton, Lye. It looked like plenty to me...&quot; She replied with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really hungry though.&quot; Lyle continued, feeling rotten for having to harp on the issue... &quot;Can I get a few more bowls?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, honey.&quot; His mom said surrendering to the request. At least he was acting more civilly. <br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Lyle was stuffed and satisfied. He&#39;d polished off 3 more bowls of eggs before finally feeling sated.<br />
<br />
Usually after a big meal like that Lyle would feel tired and just want to vedge, but today he was feeling an increasing restlessness. He had to move! He needed to be active but he couldn&#39;t leave his chair... His legs began to jiggle with anxious energy but his balls hurt so bad he had to try to keep them still... He needed to do something to burn off this energy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Can you get me dad&#39;s squeezy grip exercise spring things from the garage?&quot; Lyle shouted desperately<br />
<br />
His mom came in handing him the grip strength trainers...<br />
<br />
&quot;Sick of vegging out already?&quot; She said with a wry smile.&quot; I thought you&#39;d make it at least to mid July before doing anything fitness related.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love vegging out but it sucks when you&#39;re forced into it... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m feeling really out of sorts... Can I have some free weights too? I wanna do some curls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... Try to take it easy though, you&#39;re still recovering, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lyle spent the next couple hours doing anything he could to exercise from the confines of his chair. He squeezed the crap out of the grip strength trainers until his forearms were bulging and swollen. He worked himself so hard he couldn&#39;t lift his arms any more!<br />
<br />
He was laying back exhausted, stewing in his excessive pool of sweat and raunchy residues when his Dad finally arrived home from work. <br />
<br />
