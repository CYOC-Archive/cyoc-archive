<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Around lunchtime, Martha pulled into a Wendy&#39;s that was on the western edge of town. She was quite pleased with her success at the school in that they had quickly hired her as a substitute. She knew she&#39;d still need to update her certification in order to teach full time, but she was confident she could manage the tests required, even tests that were specific to Moon Lake. Of course she&#39;d have plenty to study and that would require some material from the college, but acquiring that would be up to William at the college. <br />
<br />
The next major mission on her agenda was ultimately to look for clothing that might or at least could shift with her. She didn&#39;t grow too big for her main cloths or even her underwear when she changed, but her underwear was tight on her and even more when she changed. The fact that her clothing couldn&#39;t shift when she changed meant moving her skirt, pants, underwear, or shorts down so she could grow her tail. Her dresses might need to have either a whole put in the back for her tail or a slit that rose up to where her tail would grow out, and many of the dresses she had wouldn&#39;t be suited to either alteration. All of that made getting clothing that would better suit her status as a werecat was important, though lunch came first.<br />
<br />
And that she did look forward to, as she would spend time with the Twists, with brought a smile to her face as she thought about it. She had three sexy and wonderful lovers. Her husband as their marriage was healing, far faster than she expected or hoped for, and as a werefox he was far sexier than he had ever been. Frances and Samantha, fellow werecats who had given her the gift she loved and had bodies similar to her own now, with wide hips and a generous bosom and excellent female lovers, which completed Martha&#39;s needs with regard to her sexuality. Though for the most part, her mind wasn&#39;t dwelling on the plans for the night, as there was much that had gone on in the morning that she hadn&#39;t been there for.<br />
<br />
After her interview, she looked through the museum of the old school building that was next to the School District Central Office. It was interesting in showing how the school functioned with all classes in the same building, complete with the old desks and even models of students. It had also had some plaques and stories on events in the school district, including one in which a bad blizzard hit Moon Lake rapidly and actually trapped the staff and students in the school. The official story was that fur rugs were used to keep the students warm, but her tour guide, an elderly werelioness, had said that it was really the weres who were old enough to have had their first change using the warmth of their furry bodies to warm their normal and younger classmates. The story of the use of rugs was simply to keep Moon Lake&#39;s secret in case someone from outside Moon Lake came to tour the building.<br />
<br />
During the tour, Martha&#39;s cellphone beeped a text alert, which informed her on the change of plans regarding lunch. The choice of a Wendy&#39;s was a bit of a surprise, but Martha figured something had gone on that either changed Samantha&#39;s work schedule or had both of them running behind their original schedule. As Martha parked her vehicle, she was curious as to specific choice, and was greeted by both Samantha and Frances who came out from the restaurant&#39;s entry area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, how&#39;d things go?&quot; Martha asked to Frances first, remembering their phone conversation earlier in the day, &quot;what called you away earlier? Everything okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances and Samantha traded glances for a moment before Samantha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t we get our lunch first and then catch up,&quot; Samantha offered, &quot;Some of the mornings events have got me a bit behind schedule and will need to focus to catch up.&quot;<br />
<br />
This left Martha more curious, but she nodded and went in. They ordered and made their way to a booth near one of the exterior windows. After taking a sip from the pink lemonade that Martha had gotten from the drink fountain, Martha returned to her question.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what went on Frances?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;Someone called your business line when I let you know that William left the car with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That initial call was with a consultation at the hospital,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;not to big with all things that went on this morning. That relates to the trial.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s eyes then turned to Samantha, who had been quietly eating while her wife answered Martha&#39;s question. After swallowing, Samantha spoke to answer the unasked question, as Martha did deserve to know what had happened at the trial.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the trial had its surprises,&quot; Samantha began, &quot;and actually short. The defense attorney actually made a guilty plea and asked that Yvette Smith be examined medically and psychologically examined before sentencing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Plead guilty?&quot; Martha asked with wide surprised eyes, &quot;did she actually...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the lawyer&#39;s plea came as a surprise to both Yvette and the DA,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;she threw a huge temper tantrum and ended up knocking herself out tripping over a chair she&#39;d overturned in the process... which created consequences for her second victim.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha found herself almost worrying immediately. She remembered overhearing the phone call that had reported that Yvette had clawed a second person, a female college student in order to elude police. She had found herself seriously hoping that the girl&#39;s transformation could be completed as quickly as needed and that she would be okay, particularly when it was reported after Yvette&#39;s capture that there wouldn&#39;t be enough time to complete the girl&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is she okay?&quot; Martha asked, concern obvious in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is now,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;as we did get Yvette to complete the girl&#39;s transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it did have its difficulties,&quot; Frances added, &quot;Because the girl was incomplete for so long... her life functions were beginning to fade and served to panic her boyfriend who had become a werefox for her. But thankfully once her transformation was completed, her life signs were strong and healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Martha breathed a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment,&quot; Frances answered, &quot;though she will probably need therapy to heal what wounds being incomplete for so long has done to her psyche.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What would that show?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely nightmares over the attack or having to be with Yvette,&quot; Frances sighed, &quot;perhaps highly defensive behavior with regard to potential rivals for fear they will be like Yvette... even at times talking to herself in trying to settle the mental scars. It&#39;ll heal and those signs will go away... with proper therapy and I asked Samantha to give her my card in case she needs someone to talk to beside her mate and fiancee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Martha spoke, &quot;or at least as good as things will be, all things considered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Samantha nodded, &quot;you may run into her this afternoon... as she made commentary about being built like a stick at times and that she&#39;ll need new clothing that will fit her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kinda in the same boat there,&quot; Martha commented with a chuckle, &quot;new hips and a new bust tend to do that... though Will and I will both need somethings that could shift with us... so we&#39;re not constantly having to pull down our pants to let our tails grow out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frances and Samantha nodded to that. As they nodded, Martha brought up a new question.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you said you&#39;re running behind schedule?&quot; Martha asked, &quot;is something up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The trial and making sure that Yvette completed Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation took a bit longer than expected,&quot; Samantha admitted, &quot;and we have a new family moving in today. I have some work to do to make sure the movers have things in the right house and in the best possible place... and of course being ready to welcome them to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have they arrived yet?&quot; Martha wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;that&#39;ll be later this afternoon... but I have plenty to do before they arrive.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then nodded and nibbled on a few french fries. Her friends had certainly had a busy morning between Yvette&#39;s hearing and Jennifer Harper&#39;s transformation being completed, and thankfully things there seemed to be going well. Hopefully it didn&#39;t tire them out.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how about your morning?&quot; Frances asked, &quot;How did things go at the school? Did they have an opening... or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They don&#39;t have an openning for a teacher right now... which I expected since the school year has just started,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;but one of the elementary school teachers will be moving after this school year because her husband is being transferred from the his present military post... so I could be considered for that spot when it opens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s a good start...&quot; Frances commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;ll need to get my certification updated to do so, but it&#39;s a good start,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and William and I will be working on that in the coming days to get all the study material and of course scheduling the tests.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances both nodded. While neither had experience as teachers, Samantha&#39;s civic duty had its own hoops to jump through and Frances had had plenty more regarding her medical training and specialization in psychology, so it wasn&#39;t as if they were unfamiliar with official requirements.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the meantime,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;they will be more than pleased to have me as a sub until that can be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Here! Here!&quot; Samantha and Frances both cheered and the three werecats toasted their drinks to celebrate.</p>
