<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Haley huffed, setting the trash bags in the dumpster behind the bakery. Another busy day had passed, baked goods were made and sold, yet she remained unsatisfied. Why? Because Lou, the highlight of her day, had yet to show his shaggy self at the bakery.<br />
She wondered if he was alright, if something had happened to him, he was usually rather punctual showing up for the afternoon batches.<br />
She and her boss would give him some of the leftovers to eat, and the dog delighted them with his eager excitement. She had considered adopting him, after all, she was a young woman in her early twenties, single, and financially stable enough to afford taking care of a pet. The only problem was her landlord, and his allergy and aversion to dogs. <br />
Taking off her glasses and wiping them on her apron with a sigh, Haley turned to head back inside to clean up and head home. Mr. Cameron had called in sick, and apologetically asked her to manage things as best as she could alone, promising a bonus on her next paycheck. Just as she opened the door and flipped the &#39;Open&#39; sign to &#39;Closed&#39;,she heard a familiar panting, and smiled.<br />
“There you are, Lou!” she beamed, greeting the shaggy dog, his joy made evident as he hopped around her. “Was beginning to think you were a no-show, boy!”<br />
Haley&#39;s smile fell a bit as she took a good look at him: his fur looked dirtier and wilder than normal, and he looked a tad fluffier and more affectionate than before. Making sure nobody was looking, she held the door open and let him in, something Mr. Cameron would never allow.<br />
“C&#39;mere, you, I have a few treats for you, but first, let&#39;s get some of that grime off.” she smiled. Lou just gave her a dopey grin and tilted his head to the side.<br />
She closed the door and flipped a switch, lowering the automatic roller shutters for more privacy, then led the dog to the bathroom with some sweet bread treats.<br />
Closing the door behind them, Haley set about the task of giving a quick shower, to rinse off some of the grime. Luckily for her, Lou was pretty smart for a stray, so he obediently allowed her to wash him, even though he still whined a bit as she did. Lou somehow understood that she would reward him if he behaved.<br />
<br />
After using a spare towel to help the dog dry up a bit, Haley made a mental note of removing the wet clumps of fur that littered the sink, otherwise her boss might get upset enough to deny her the promised bonus, and led Lou to the counter, taking out a bowl and depositing a buncha baked failures inside, for the dog to eat.<br />
Holding the filled bowl, she turned and set the bowl down, kneeling next to him to watch him eat. Lou dug right in, devouring the meal with gusto, somehow it tasted so much better than the previous day, and, within seconds, he was finished.<br />
“Woah... Lou, you shouldn&#39;t that fast.” Haley said, admonishing him. Yet, he looked at her and at the empty bowl, expectantly. “What, you want seconds, boy? Didn&#39;t get lucky today with the market, huh. Well... alright.” she started, grabbing the bowl and straightening herself up. Taking on a stern expression, Haley held up one finger with her empty hand. “But just one more refill, Lou!”<br />
He gave a soft bark at that, and she smiled, taking the rest of the failed batches and refilling the bowl. When she turned to give him the bowl, she froze. Lou looked bigger.<br />
Before, he was a medium-sized dog, as big as a husky, but now, he looked like he was as big as a rottweiler. Lou tilted his head again, and whined. Blinking her eyes, Haley dismissed this as just a trick of the light, and once again knelt besides the dog, letting him eat. But then she realized, as he ate, he was indeed growing. She held her breath as she saw the dog visibly fatten up and swell with each bite, and slowly backed away from him.<br />
“What the hell is going on...” she muttered, now feeling fearful when Lou became as big as a great dane, and twice as heavy. Having finished his seconds, Lou panted, sat up and burped, satisfied. Haley gasped as he kept changing: Lou&#39;s entire body was reshaping itself, his paws changing into paw-like hands, his hind legs stretching out, he was looking more humanoid by the second. Eventually, Lou noticed something was amiss as he tried to stand on all fours and realized his new proportions were unfit for such a pose. Looking over to the frozen Hailey, something within Lou&#39;s mind clicked, and he straightened himself out.<br />
His thoughts were muddy, incoherent, several questions forming with Lou&#39;s mind, like why is the bakery lady so small? Why am I so dizzy? Why does my body feel strange?<br />
Hayley for her part just hugged the wall as she beheld Lou&#39;s metamorphosis. Was he some kind of alien? Was she dreaming? Was she going to die?<br />
Neither of them expected what came next, however, because Lou wasn&#39;t done changing: his humanoid body became increasingly heavy-set, and Hailey could swear she saw his covered male parts shrink and disappear from sight, just before a heavy gut covered his groin as it swelled. His hips flared out, with thickening thighs giving him a distinct female look, quickly followed by a developing chest, that grew and grew to the point of being several cups bigger than Hailey&#39;s own moderate C cups.<br />
Staggering a bit, Lou leaned on the counter for support, as the last changes hit: his body shot up another foot in height, bringing him to a towering 7&#39;5 feet, and his shoulders widened a bit, with two lumps inflating on either side of her neck. The fleshy lumps quickly developed facial features identical to Lou&#39;s own, eyes opening and blinking with mutual confusion.<br />
This was too much for Hailey. Aware of the danger, she slowly walked towards the exit, hugging the wall the entire time. It was then that she realized, she had lowered the shutters down, effectively trapping herself the beast. If she was lucky, she could raise them enough to slip through before the three-headed thing could register what she was doing, he seemed distracted by his female-like anatomy, even raising his gut to inspect his... oh.<br />
“...that&#39;s a slit...” Hailey muttered, as she watched the creature reach down and gingerly touch the lower lips. They must have been quite sensitive, because all three of her heads gasped and groaned in a very womanly voice.<br />
Just as Hailey neared the switch, the creature remembered the human, and turned her multiple heads to her, giving her sultry looks as she raised her paw-hand slicked with carnal juices, waving.</p>
