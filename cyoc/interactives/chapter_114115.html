<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know what Genie...? I think I want to become a god. C-can you do that?&quot; You ask with a bit of a stammer at the end because the thought kind of made you nervous. You were a Christian after all, believing in one God, Jesus and all that, but at the same time as a mortal man... you couldn&#39;t help but to have your doubts from time to time.<br />
<br />
In your thinking over the years, you knew what you believed through what you&#39;ve personally seen or felt, but the idea of what God was was the thing that you questioned most. You didn&#39;t believe that God was what people claimed God to be, but rather a being of pure living energy that has always existed somehow, but could become anything it wanted at will, which also meant it could manipulate its&#39; own properties to create matter and all manner of thing the being known as &quot;God&quot; could. However, with this power at your hands, you knew you could make it all different. If you could be a god... then you&#39;d be the kind that you thought should exist based on everything you&#39;ve been lead to believe God was and is.<br />
<br />
The genie looked at you questioning your question, but in her own mind as she could see you thinking about the exact question you posed. &quot;As I said before master... I can grant you wishes that would be deemed impossible by most, but why do you want to know if I can make you a god? The answer is, of course, yes. However, what kind of a god would you be if I gave you such power?&quot;<br />
<br />
You heard her words and felt your heartbeat skip a beat from the excitement of the actual possibility... no... definite becoming a god. Maybe even THE god that you thought existed. Though, at the same time, the thought of absolute power over everyone and everything in the known universe was... let&#39;s just say... arousing as you could feel yourself get hard at the thought. You started to think of all the things that you could do, to make, to even make become a reality based on your wildest fantasies. Hell... you knew you could become a good god, but there was something more arousing about becoming an evil one. Hell... even being a furry on top of things... you knew that you could make the community&#39;s fantasies a reality at the next convention you&#39;d go to. The possibilities were endless and everything swirled around in your mind, nearly making you dizzy in the process, but you quickly closed your eyes and breathed slowly so that you could finally answer the genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie... I honestly don&#39;t know what kind of god I&#39;d be, but I only hope I could be a god that the people of this world and every other world needed.&quot; You answered honestly, even though the thoughts of being an evil god were more and more alluring by the moment... as well as arousing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a good answer master. With that kind of power, which is actually far exceeding my own, it is hard to know what you will become in the end. However, knowing that you have the foresight to think in such a way is the way a deity should think. So... do you wish to be a god master? If so, just ask, but be specific in your wish.&quot; The genie replied, seemingly anxious to know your decision. &quot;Oh, but also know this master... if you do wish to become a god, you will spend the power of all three of your wishes combined as it will take a great deal to make this happen and afterward, I&#39;d be of no service or use to you. What would a god need with a genie when a god can make everything happen and more that a genie could without being bound to wishes. Your very thoughts could become reality.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stood there for a moment as evil thoughts started to pop into your mind about what you would do first with such power, grinned then nodded. &quot;Yes genie, I do wish that you would make me a god that had boundless power to do what I want, with what I want, as I see or saw fit!&quot; You said with jovial excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well master... let it be done!&quot; She said as the sound of her voice grew in loudness as her entire body and form began to levitate and radiate a bright light and warmth.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the light grew bigger and brighter, continuing to do so exponentially while swirls of energy whirled around her arms, legs, torso and head in an incredibly beautiful display. Then, just as suddenly, it began to reach out toward you slowly, like tendrils of light reaching to grasp ahold of its target. All you could do was to stand there in shock and awe of what was happening as your wish was being fulfilled feeling an incredible amount of power and energy pouring into you before you were even touched. Before you knew it, however, the white tendrils of energy had completely gone from her body that was slumped over, exhausted and spent from such an immense wish. They were now swirling all around you, as they were her, as you could slowly feel the power being absorbed by your once mortal and increasingly godly being. Then... just as quickly as it all had begun, it had ended and you stood there breathing slightly hard and panting. Even though you knew you were different, even though you felt different, you didn&#39;t know exactly just HOW much different you were now.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... is it done? Have you made me a god genie?&quot; You asked coming down off of what just happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master... I have. You are now a god as you wished. Can you not feel the power in your being, pumping through your very veins, as you stand before me while I recuperate?&quot; She asked as she was also coming down from what she did to and for you as she stood up once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I do... I feel immense power inside of me, but... I just don&#39;t know what to do with it or how to even use it.&quot; You replied in earnest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... well... as far as what you do with it... that&#39;s up to you. How you use it, think of whatever you want and it will be done.&quot; She said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... is that so?&quot; You asked with a smile on your face.</p>
