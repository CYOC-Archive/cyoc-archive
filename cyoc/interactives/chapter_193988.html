<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff pressed the “start” button. He took off his shirt and made his way to Kara’s room, which was soon to be his own. He then laid down in Kara’s bed. He had to pull his legs inward a bit to fit the small frame, but that shouldn’t be a problem for much longer!<br />
<br />
As Jeff fell asleep, he remembered what tomorrow was. It was Christmas! He smiled as he fell asleep. He would wake up with the best gift of all time!<br />
<br />
Jeff woke up to light shining through the window. His body felt a bit strange. He had already noticed that he hadn’t drooled everywhere on his pillow overnight. He also noticed how he didn’t smell of BO, but it was a more pleasant smell.<br />
<br />
Jeff was rather confused at this, and he slowly sat his pillow up. He himself sat up. His mind was still waking up, the same went for his body. He looked around and instantly saw something different. This wasn’t his room!<br />
<br />
That was when Jeff remembered what he had done last night! He still couldn’t quite feel his body completely, but he had hoped it would work.<br />
<br />
Jeff pulled down the sheets and covers, and beheld a brilliant sight. He wasn’t wearing a pair of men’s pajamas, but those of a young girl. Underneath those pajamas, were two legs that looked shorter than his own, but they were his!<br />
<br />
Jeff then looked at his hands, and saw small, soft hands. He flexed his fingers, looking at his new hands. He inspected them, and even noticed that his own fingerprints had changed as well.<br />
<br />
Jeff then reached his hands up to feel his face, which had become softer, and more feminine. He even felt his hair, which had grown out a considerable amount. <br />
<br />
Jeff then got rather excited, and his pants would’ve tented in excitement if he hadn’t lost a certain part. <br />
<br />
Jeff pulled the pajamas down his legs, noticing the pair of panties that rest between him, and his new womanhood. He relished the moment, feeling the panties as they tightly hugged his groin. He didn’t feel any pain from testicles being crushed, or from a penis not having enough room. <br />
<br />
Jeff reached a hand down and rubbed along the area. The smooth skin, and flatness around his groin. It was exciting! He then pulled down the panties.<br />
<br />
Jeff then saw his vulva. A beautiful perfect slit. No genitals awkwardly hanging there. Jeff did feel a bit awkward though. She had never actually seen a vulva before. <br />
<br />
Jeff had always known that this was how girls were born. No penis, but a slit between their legs. That feeling of emptiness that they got to feel everyday. Knowing what it could bring. Girls like Jeff had to grow up without any of the perks of being a boy. <br />
<br />
Jeff reached a hand down to the mound between her legs. She felt two lips of flesh forming her new slit. She reached a finger gently into it, as it went deeper than she expected it to. Jeff smiled as she realized this was the first vulva she had ever seen or touched, and it was hers!<br />
<br />
Jeff mentally felt her new body. She had always just had a bladder as a boy, that was connected to a penis. She had always been able to direct it wherever she wanted to. But now, there was a uterus tucked behind her bladder. Her uterus was also connected to her ovaries, which held her eggs. <br />
<br />
Jeff had no need for testicles anymore, as she had no need to carry around sperm with her. Because of this, having a penis to impregnate women was obsolete, since she would be the one to get pregnant. Due to this, her crotch was flat, and prepared to receive any sperm given to her by a man’s penis.<br />
<br />
Jeff also would never be able to control where she would pee. Her vulva would simply squirt the liquid wherever it wanted. She would always need to sit down to use the restroom, and use toilet paper to clean herself off. If she was outside, she would need to squat wherever she was to minimize what mess she could. <br />
<br />
Jeff thought how girls weren’t born with penises, and had to embrace the fact that they would never have them. Jeff was a girl who would never be able to experience manhood. She would now be responsible for her body and eggs, needing to endure the pain of menstruation every month so that she could one day give birth to a child. <br />
<br />
Jeff realized that the pains of being a woman are what made them powerful over men. Being able to endure the painful birthing process. Not having to worry about destroying a reproductive system. Knowing that she would need to wear and use special products designed for her body. It was beautiful.<br />
<br />
Jeff got out of bed, and walked to the mirror, admiring her body. She felt the chilly air encase her legs and vulva as she walked. She then took off her shirt, and admired the rest of her body. She admired her chest, even though it hadn’t grown out yet, she would eventually have breasts that would be used to feed whatever child would come out of her body. <br />
<br />
Seeing a shirtless girl like this was rather strange, and creepy. However, this was what Jeff had wanted. She had always wanted ti be a girl, and as she rubbed her new vulva, she knew that this was what she always wanted. She even turned to look at her butt, which was much rounder than when she was a boy. <br />
<br />
Jeff even noticed how her waist had grown out to accommodate giving birth. Or how her body had no hair, other than on her head. It was Jeff’s body! Nobody could ever take this away!<br />
<br />
Jeff then remembered that today was Christmas! She grew excited wondering what she would do, with it being her first Christmas as a girl.<br />
<br />
She the remembered that Kara would be waking up soon, in her old disgusting male body. Jeff wanted to go and give Kara the best Christmas gift ever!</p>
