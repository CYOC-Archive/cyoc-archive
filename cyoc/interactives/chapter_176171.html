<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ha, did you forget it reclines?&quot; Timmy asked as he placed the sofa thing back in it&#39;s large playpen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... yup, that&#39;s it...&quot; He mumbled.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Tim leaned back into Shaniqua. Both her breasts were super soft, and he eventually began to close his eyes. <br />
&quot;Eh, a quick nap won&#39;t hurt anyone.&quot; He thought before drifting off quite suddenly.<br />
<br />
Timmy, or rather &quot;Shaniqua&quot; as she thought she was, looked up at Mrs. Johnson in confusion.<br />
&quot;What is up with her today?&quot; She thought, climbing up onto the large couch, unaware of who she really was. &quot;She&#39;s acting much more like-&quot; She continued before being interrupted by the sound of the garage door opening. &quot;Oh, Mr. Johnson.&quot; She quietly greeted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sha- oh, ha, sorry.&quot; He switched to a whisper upon seeing his wife asleep on the sofa chair. Tim placed his suitcase down then took off his suit, having to pull it through the hole where his tail went through. &quot;She&#39;s sleeping in my spot huh?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sir, she just passed out. Frankly it&#39;s been a little weird today.&quot; Shaniqua whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird how? Wasn&#39;t she also supposed to be out with Lynda?&quot; Tim asked, wiping his wet nose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but then she took Rex on a walk, then came back pretty quickly.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a crappy lawnmower in the garage for some reason... you think that&#39;s gotta do with that?&quot; He wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, I didn&#39;t see anything on it.&quot; She shrugged it off before walking back to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tim&quot; looked down at the real chin and sighed.<br />
&quot;Damn. I don&#39;t want to wake her up but I was so excited to let her know I got the promotion.&quot; He thought. Just before walking away, however, something caught his eye. &quot;Hey, is that my watch?&quot; He wondered.<br />
<br />
He reached down, and gently slid it off his wifes&#39; wrist. Luckily, when she had passed out it had loosened up a bit. He put it on and began to look it over. It looked pretty nice, but he didn&#39;t recognize it as one of his. Had Jennifer bought this for him? If she did, then why was she wearing it?<br />
<br />
Rex in Tim&#39;s life began to mindlessly fiddle with it, also wondering why Jennifer was sleeping in his sofa chair.<br />
<br />
In an instant, and unknown to Rex, reality changed again. In an instant, Tim found himself awake. He experienced the feeling of thinking he was falling before jolting awake quickly, and wanted to scream but found he could not.<br />
&quot;Wh-what? What the hell?&quot; He thought, feeling somewhat bloated and confused. <br />
<br />
He glanced to his left and was surprised to see his dog Rex standing on two legs, wearing HIS clothes. What was even more alarming, however, was the WATCH on his wrist.<br />
&quot;Shit, Rex, gimme that!&quot; He tried to scream, but no words came out.<br />
<br />
He looked back down and realized what had happened. He was big, fat, and shaped vaguely like a chair. He was naked, and could barely make out his dick sticking from between the fat roles. His nipples had swollen to act as pillows, and his legs were stuck up together and sticking out straight to act as a recliner would. He was in the life role of the god damned sofa chair.<br />
<br />
Lying on him was Shaniqua, but she was in Jennifer&#39;s life. Her curly dark hair was slightly longer and held back in a ponytail like Jennifer, and he could make out some makeup on her sleeping face. Her large butt and decent breasts also looked quite nice in Jennifer&#39;s leggings and top which had now resized to fir her perfectly. Tim also tried to move to wake her up but to no avail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, does Rex know now?&quot; He thought, suddenly realizing how bad it could be if he was no longer the only one aware. He glanced back and saw Rex looking at Shaniqua, but not in a freaked out way but in a half looking past her way. Tim should&#39;ve been relieved, but seeing that Rex was currently fiddling with the role swapping watch he could not feel any sense of calm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zip zip. (Dada)&quot; The sofa thing in the playpen suddenly called out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey buddy, did Shaniqua take good care of you?&quot; He rhetorically asked while still fiddling with the watch.<br />
<br />
Tim could only watch as in an instant Timmy was now back in his own life, happily bouncing in the playpen. Tim couldn&#39;t spin his head, but assumed that now the sofa chair was in Shaniqua&#39;s life. As Rex went to stop fiddling to pick up &quot;his&quot; son, he stopped as he heard Jennifer in Rex&#39;s life bark out happily.<br />
&quot;Shaniqua, did you lock Rex away?&quot; Rex joked.<br />
<br />
Instead of hearing the zipper make noises once more, Tim suddenly heard his wife Jennifer speak again.<br />
&quot;Sorry Mr. Johnson, he was licking poor Timmy&#39;s face a little too much. You know how excited dogs get.&quot; Jennifer laughed.<br />
<br />
Tim heard the little latch open, and in ran in the sofa, now looking more like someone made a stuffed animal in the shape of a dog out of couch felt. It wagged it&#39;s hassle tail and jumped up at Rex who laughed.<br />
&quot;Easy boy.&quot; Rex chuckled.<br />
<br />
Then Jennifer walked in, which caused Tim to stare a little harder than before. Jennifer was now wearing Shaniqua&#39;s modest little vest, short skirt, and dorky glasses. Her curly red hair was now shaped much more like an afro, and her whole demeanor was much more like that of a casual but nerdy college student. Tim hadn&#39;t expected this to turn him on, but he guessed anything his wife did was hot to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; The real Shaniqua mumbled, being woken up by the zipper-sounding barks of the sofa chair. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; She mumbled, stretching up from Tim. Shaniqua&#39;s ass in Jennifer&#39;s yoga pants pressed against Tim&#39;s thicker thighs and permanently erect dick, and as she pushed back accidentally leant into it which caused Tim&#39;s legs to go back under and his back to shoot back up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops!&quot; Shaniqua gasped. &quot;Ha, I&#39;m awake now. Hey baby, did you get the job?&quot; Shaniqua asked Rex.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did baby.&quot; Rex happily replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least that worked out.&quot; Tim thought as they all celebrated next to him. &quot;The only issue now is how do I get back into my own role so I can actually do that job?&quot; He wondered, ignoring what the others were saying until a certain word from Rex caught his attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, a watch huh?&quot; Shaniqua in Jennifer&#39;s life thought.<br />
<br />
Tim held his breath. He hadn&#39;t considered how the actions he did in someone else life may translate once they were normal again! Would &quot;Jennifer&quot; even remember? Would she have false memories? Was he screwed?<br />
<br />
Shaniqua then said...</p>
