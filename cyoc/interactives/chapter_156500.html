<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassandra woke up with her head pounding. Shit, she had really let herself go down on those fruity coolers. The dynamic between the girls were strained because of her drunken wish. If it got worse, Cassandra would be kicked out of the group, and she would lose academic help from Anna and she would lose her boy magnet, Melody. This was not going to happen if she could help it. OK, first things first, she had to go to Kimberly and apologize. Maybe that would sway Kimberly into not hating her and keep Cassandra in good graces with the others.<br />
<br />
With her plan in mind, she went to the kitchen to make some pancakes, to sweeten her apology. Fifth-teen minutes later with a tray of steaming pancakes, syrup, whipped cream, butter, and orange juice, Cassandra made her way into Kimberly’s room. Kimberly’s gentle breaths were the signal that she was still sleeping.  Her form under the blanket clearly outlined her cock and balls in all their massive glory. <br />
<br />
Well, Cassandra wasn’t going to let her hard work go to waste. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Kimberly, Kim, Kimber, wake up. I gotchu breakfast,” said Cassandra.<br />
<br />
No response from the big dicked girl, only her cock shifted to peak out from under the blanket, as if to question why Cassandra was in the room.<br />
<br />
A ha! The boys Cassandra dated always dreamed about waking up to a blowjob. Cassandra sort of wanted to play with the giant penis anyway since last night. Waking Kimberly with an orgasm and getting to play with the man sausage was killing two birds with one stone. Cassandra stared at the cock with a predatory gaze, and in reaction to her stare it harden as if it picked up her intentions. <br />
<br />
Cassandra threw the blanket off Kimberly’s lower body exposing her ass, balls, and penis. Kimberly was sleeping on her side with her arms around her cock like it was a body pillow.<br />
<br />
“Oh flipping flapjacks, you are still one hung bitch!” Cassandra exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Cassandra ran a finger along the underside of meat monolith, teasing the monster, and making it grow harder. She used both hands to cup one massive testicle squeezing it to find that it was squishy and firm at the same time. The action caused the penis to jerk in Kimberly’s arms and leak precum and pheromones, heating up the air with lust. Looking at the head of the penis there was no way Cassandra could fit her it into her mouth, so no blowjob. But, she did have the pancakes, butter and syrup as substitutes to toy with the cock. <br />
<br />
Taking a cooled down warm pancake, Cassandra buttered it up, then she used it like a cloth rubbing the cock with the pancake.  Oh did the penis love that, with three long rubs it was slippery with butter and with the warm stimulation from the pancake, the sausage jerked wildly. It slipped out from Kimberly’s arms and waved in the air, begging for more. Cassandra answered the cue by pouring syrup over the long meat, and with a new pancake started jerking the thing off. The feeling was weird and erotic to the dick. It was slippery from the butter but sticky from the syrup, both combined created a suction like effect that teased the cock to no ends. It was still inexperienced in the world of sex, so it was on the edge of cumming.  <br />
<br />
Cassandra was using both arms to jerk the cock, but she felt her pussy grow hot and wet. She decided to leave both pancakes on the cock, and started to masturbate with one hand massaging her clit and the other squeezing her nipple. The cock drooled precum in protest with the cum hole winking as clear precum leaked out onto the bed. The weight from the pancakes was enough to keep the cock hard, but it wasn’t enough stimulation to make it cum. So the cock was being edged by Cassandra as she moaned from her own masturbation. Every stiffed yelp of pleasure from Cassandra made the cock throb in want. <br />
<br />
Kimberly was shifting in her sleep now. Apparently constant moans and uncomfortable arousal was enough to rouse her.<br />
<br />
“Ohhh….yeah….oooooohhhh…...yesss…...CUMMING!” Cassandra yelled as her body tensed up and waves of pleasure flowed over her body and mind.<br />
<br />
This finally woke up Kimberly who sat up with a start. The movement caused her giant donger to swing and smack Cassandra’s small breasts staining her pajama blouse in syrup butter, and precum. The cock then slid off her chest to stand erect in open air.<br />
<br />
“What the fudge is going OnnNN?!” Kimberly started to say, but the smack from her cock had finally transferred the feeling to her brain causing her to freeze in agony of pleasure and arousal. The pancakes that were on her dick slid off slowly falling onto the bed with a flop flop. This was the trigger that set off Kimberly’s ruined orgasm.<br />
<br />
Her balls tensed up and in their sack releasing their load. With a glorp, cum spewed from the dong in weak spurts. Weak though they may be, the massive volume of the milk colored cum still covered Cassandra who was in the line of fire. The bed was painted white and Kimberly fell back down enjoying the unexpected orgasm with her eyes crossed.<br />
<br />
As the cumming died down to it’s last few spurts, Kimberly’s mind was back.<br />
<br />
“Cassandra? What are you doing in my room?” Kimberly asked in a tired whisper.<br />
<br />
Cassandra used the soaked bed sheets to wipe cum off her face before she answered, “Well I made you breakfast to say, I’m sorry for the whole horse dick thing. I was drunk and bored last night, you know. Anyway it looks like breakfast was a success so I’ll be leaving now.” <br />
<br />
With those words Cassandra sauntered towards the door.<br />
<br />
“By the way your dick is really hot. It’s not like I like you or anything, but I’m down if you need help managing it, since I made the wish, it&#39;s my responsibility. And keep this a secret from the others, OK?” Cassandra added on.<br />
<br />
“Uh, sure?”<br />
<br />
“Good.”<br />
<br />
Then Cassandra left the room with the door slamming shut.<br />
<br />
Kimberly sighed, she was still sort of angry at Cassandra, but she did come to apologize, even if the apology was weird. Maybe Cassandra was a good person under her mean girl exterior. Kimberly looked at the mess on her bed, no Cassandra was still Cassandra, better to play it safe by being aloof from her like normal. <br />
<br />
“Fucking Cassandra,” Kimberly said as she stared at the ruined pancakes, her cum covered bed, and her sticky soft dong. She had to clean this up by herself since Cassandra just left.</p>
