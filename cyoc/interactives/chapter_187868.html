<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff&#39;s mom called up from downstairs, &quot;Jeff! Don&#39;t forget our usual appointment is in an hour! We should head out soon or we&#39;ll be late and you remember what happens when we are late!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff realized with a start that he did remember what she was yelling about. Despite only recently swapping his penis for a super model&#39;s vagina he realized he also somehow had years of memories of mother/son bonding time at their spa together. The last time they were late the ladies at the spa had rushed the one part of the experience no one wants rushed and he and his mom had spent some time in pain together from too quick of a bikini wax. Jeff shouted back down, &quot;I&#39;m almost ready Mom! Just showing Ashley something on the computer real quick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to Ashley and bit the bottom of his lip in sexy frustration at the huge pole tenting Ashley&#39;s skirt. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, babe, but Mom is right and I&#39;ve got to go. The spa doesn&#39;t like it when we are late. I&#39;m going to need a raincheck on getting that pipe fitted for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley pouted and it was unbearably hot to Jeff, but he knew as bad as having a rushed wax job was, it would make it even harder to do what Ashley wanted the both of them to be doing right now. Jeff sighed, &quot;I&#39;m really, really sorry. I… forgot… didn&#39;t know?… forgot… about what day it was. Anyway, I don&#39;t need my girlfriend walking home with an erection that won&#39;t go down and I especially don&#39;t want my girlfriend suffering from blue balls just because of me,&quot; Jeff put a hand on her cock as if to pet it and Ashley smiled hoping that meant a quick hand job at least, but Jeff continued, &quot;So I left my computer unlocked and hopefully you can find some porn to masturbate before you head home.&quot; Ashley pouted again. Though Ashley realized that maybe a bit of masturbation might not be the worst idea to get used to a very new cock for her. She was pouting as much because she had a deep sense that it was really upsetting and arousing Jeff.<br />
<br />
Ashley shrugged still pouting, &quot;Fine, go have a nice spa day with your mother.&quot; Ashley wasn&#39;t sure if she said it as more of a disappointment, a threat, or an honest sentiment that she hoped her boyfriend had a good time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing it all for you, babe. You know I wouldn&#39;t look half as good in a thong if I didn&#39;t.&quot; Jeff gave Ashley a quick squeeze and then whispered in her ear, &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no problem getting it back up when I&#39;m wearing my smallest g-string over my freshly waxed tight little fanny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley laughed away the pain of her erection somehow getting harder at that whisper. &quot;I&#39;m going to hold you to that promise, Jeff darling.&quot; She growled before kissing him. Jeff held the hug and the kiss a few moments before finally rushing downstairs to join his mom.<br />
<br />
The spa day went just about as it usually did for Jeff and his Mom. Even the painful parts felt surprisingly ordinary to Jeff despite this being the first time he&#39;d done it since swapping his genitals, it also felt like a regular occurrence and Jeff was feeling really weird from that mix of memories.<br />
<br />
During a quiet bit while they waited for their nails to dry (Jeff didn&#39;t let them do as much to his fingernails, trying to keep them somewhat &#39;manly&#39;, but he&#39;d let the shop&#39;s ladies have fun with his toenails, as supposedly they always did, some part of his memories suggested) when Jeff&#39;s Mom turned from small talk to some a shockingly serious question to Jeff&#39;s ears, &quot;I know a Mom isn&#39;t supposed to ask this early, especially not at your age, but when are you finally put a ring on it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at his mother in shock, &quot;What? Ashley? We&#39;ve only just started dating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s Mom laughed a little, &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you still think so. I&#39;m glad it still seems fresh and exciting. I know you both have been sweethearts since middle school and I want you to know that I&#39;ve got friends whose entire marriages where shorter than how long you two have been dating. She&#39;s really special, Jeff, and I enjoy it every time you bring her over. I know it&#39;s really selfish of me to hope that you pin her down before you both move on to the even harder real world. I know I should be wanting you to finish school and get a good career first, but I really, really selfishly just want to see my son swelling up with my first grandkid already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mo-om,&quot; Jeff groaned. His head was awash in competing imagery. He&#39;d not really considered the effects of a teen pregnancy on his possible future career, but realized how suddenly that was in play now that he had swapped his a huge cock onto his girlfriend this morning. Yet somehow he was also remembering how adorable Ashley&#39;s parents were about always supplying their daughter with plenty of prophylactics and how much Ashley&#39;s parents worked to make sure Jeff and Ashley always had the safest of safe sex since they&#39;d been old enough to have safe sex after dates together. Jeff&#39;s memories of only their second date together, last night, still seemed so fresh, but somehow was also sharing room with a much longer history of dating his lovely cheerleader girlfriend (with a big cock to play with). He started to remember boys picking on Ashley for having the biggest cock in school and how he eventually wound up finally convincing her that they were saying those things because they were just envious and of course she had the biggest cock in school and they should be more than envious that they didn&#39;t, they should be humbled. He started to remember how Ashley had introduced Stanley Gregory movies to him and they had bonded over all the cool stuff he did in those movies, and that Jeff should be similarly confident at what he had the other guys didn&#39;t. He remembered how Ashley had encouraged him to be the action hero he wanted to be, and how much Jeff got into sports to prove her right and give her things to cheer for. Jeff started to remember that first time they&#39;d giggled together and laughed through some of Pipe Layer Greg earliest pornos when they discovered his porno name. (And then how that had lead to wild dates after that.)<br />
<br />
Jeff had been worried about changing the timeline too much earlier. However, other than the headache of all those memories jumbling up rapidly in his brain, Jeff decided that having years more dates with Ashley was a surprisingly great outcome of changing the timeline. He hoped that Ashley would get an easier reminder of their new shared memories than Ashley&#39;s Dad just straight out asking her when she was going to propose to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s Mom assumed the silent contemplation was mostly still just embarrassment, assumed she had said to much already, and did not pry any further.</p>
