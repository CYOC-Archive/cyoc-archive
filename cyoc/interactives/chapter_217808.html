<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff and Alex made small talk while they set up and waited for the others to arrive. Alex was a pretty nice guy, and also the oldest of the group now that Jeff had taken his dads spot at 47 years old. He was definitely beginning to show signs of aging, with the thick beard he had beginning to transition from black to a salt-and-pepper coloring. He was shy about his receding hairline, though, and would typically wear a hat to cover it up, like the ball cap he was wearing now. <br />
Slowly but surely, the rest of the guys arrived. First was Ken, a 39 year old father of two. He was the tallest of the guys at 6’7”, usually just barely clearing the equipment Mike had fastened to the ceiling of the garage. Then Henry got there. The 33-year old had recently gotten married, and was without kids. He was fairly heavy, but had a deep authoritative voice that commanded respect. Then 38-year old George got there, just a few minutes late. George was technically their manager at work, but he never acted that way and liked keeping things friendly. He was the guy that could always “brighten up a room” both with his personality and his bright red hair. <br />
Last to arrive, as usual, was Ty. Ty was the youngest of the guys by far, and also the newest addition. At 26 years old, he was a massive man, thick with hard earned muscle. He started working at the company a few months ago, and despite his handsome looks and appealing demeanor, was a fairly reserved guy. He was invited a couple months ago for the first time and he surprisingly came out of his shell quite a bit at game night compared to work, where they also learned he took part in, and won, amateur bodybuilding competitions. He had recently been invited to a big league competition as well. He arrived wearing a tank top and athletic shorts compared to the rest of the guys in button-ups or polos and jeans. Now that all of the guys had arrived, it was time for game night to truly begin.<br />
After a couple hours of poker, drinks, and cigars, the guys decided to change games to blackjack. Since blackjack was an easier game, Jeff used this opportunity while the guys were chatting to go back and try to get Mike to play a few hands. He walked, a bit drunkenly, towards the living room where he saw his dad on the recliner watching sports. <br />
“Hey, why don’t you come join us for the last few hands? You could *hic* even have a beer if you want.”<br />
“Um…” He didn’t entirely look like he wanted to say no. “Well I don’t really know the game, and I’m not big on gambling, and I don’t really know the guys still, so…”<br />
“Come on, it’s blackjack! I’ll show you, it’s easy. I’ll even front you the chips! And the guys are fun, you’ll love it!”<br />
Mike shrugged and got up. “I guess a few hands won’t hurt, as long as I can get a beer.” He followed Jeff back out and was welcomed by the rest of the guys. Jeff fetched more beer for the guys, making sure to grab an extra for Mike.<br />
After teaching Mike the basics, Jeff slid some of his chips to Mike and they played a few hands. Mike surprised himself with how much he enjoyed the game. Eventually, just as Jeff was about to deal out another hand, Alex stood up. “That’s game. I’m out of chips.” <br />
It was true, and they usually stopped once someone was out. Jeff had another plan though.<br />
“Why don’t we play one more hand. This time we’ll bet our favorite things about ourselves.” The guys had questions, of course. “Think of it like blackjack truth or dare. What’s the hard, right?” They couldn’t argue that, and everyone agreed.<br />
Going around the table, they started with Alex. “Well, uh, I guess I’d have to say my beard. I’m pretty proud of it, actually.” The rest agreed, he took great care of it and it showed. Ty was the next to bet. “I mean obviously it’s all this.” He flexed an arm and popped his pecs. The rest of the guys agreed, though Ken rolled his eyes at Ty’s showing off.<br />
George cleared his throat, ready to bet next. “I guess… it’d have to be my cock?” The guys laughed. “I’m serious… I don’t mean to brag but it’s huge. I wear baggy pants to hide it. Here…” He got up and started taking his jeans off. The guys protested, but they were down before anyone could do anything about it. Underneath, George wore a pair of compression shorts that had a large 10-inch soft beer can thick cock. The rest of the guys went silent and dropped their jaws. “Well alright then. We’ll take it?” Said Jeff, shocked by what he saw and partially wanting to move on. <br />
Ken offered his height, and the guys chucked about it. Henry offered his voice next, and the others drunkenly mocked Henry’s deep commanding voice, but none could deny its power. <br />
Next it was Mike’s turn. “Well uh… I guess right now I’d have to pick my son.” Jeff tried to fight this. “Well isn’t there anything else dad? Like, mom, or something?” <br />
“No, I think right now I’m just really proud of my son.” Jeff got worried. He was a prize now. What if he won, would be become his own father?<br />
Last, it was Jeff’s turn to bet, and without thinking, his mouth moved on its own. “Id have to bet my awareness.” Jeff slapped his hand to his mouth, shocked, as he realized that he didn’t have a choice. He liked it a lot, and he made a deal to bet his favorite thing. The other guys were confused. “Um.., I guess whoever wins will find out what I mean?” The guys shrugged, not really wanting to accept more from a kid anyways. <br />
After playing through the hand, a winner was decided. <br />
<br />
The winner is…</p>
