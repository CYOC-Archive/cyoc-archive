<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Robbie was lying on the bed and resting, his beloved parents were lying with him. His mother was lying with her head on his chest, and his father was lying lower - his head was on Robbie&#39;s groin.<br />
<br />
The night was really stormy - the guy had to please his parents from below while they were kissing. The father sat with his pussy on Robbie&#39;s penis, and the mother on the guy&#39;s face while he did cunnilingus with his tongue.<br />
<br />
Now Robbie got up and began to get dressed - he put on a white T-shirt, denim shorts and socks. The T-shirt hugged his muscular torso, and the shorts did not hide his big &quot;device&quot; much. He was going to school.<br />
<br />
Despite the changes, classmates didn&#39;t care about Robbie&#39;s changes either, and no one was embarrassed that the 21-year-old was studying at school. He sat down at his usual place and prepared for lessons.<br />
<br />
Robbie had an idea. He wanted revenge on a bully. There was a nasty guy in his class-a guy named Rick. He was a typical muscular guy whose muscles replaced brains.<br />
<br />
The black guy knew how he could get revenge on Rick. He knew when to take revenge. But you have to wait for that.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Now physical education was over. Robbie came to the men&#39;s locker room, where his classmates were changing clothes. Rick was among them.<br />
<br />
The guy sat down on a bench and began to change clothes too, but for show - Robbie had a plan. He waited until Rick was alone. <br />
<br />
He sat and watched intently. When there were two or three guys left, Robbie took out his phone and pointed it at Rick - he was sitting in the distance and putting on sneakers.<br />
<br />
The black guy focused the camera on the bully and finally took a picture. He did it without anyone noticing. It was lucky that the last potential witnesses left before Robbie took Rick&#39;s picture.<br />
<br />
The guy started Chronivak and began to introduce changes. There was an update of the application, where you can save the memory of the changes to the person who was photographed. And the second update made it possible to change people, changing their appearance not just into a person, but into an object or an animal.<br />
<br />
Robbie decided to take advantage of this and began to make changes, and then clicked &quot;Save Changes&quot;, before putting a check mark on the item &quot;save memory&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rick stood up, but almost immediately sat back down on the bench. His body wouldn&#39;t obey, and then he saw his arms and legs begin to retract into his body.<br />
<br />
- What&#39;s goin on?! - he screamed. It was obvious that he was scared.<br />
<br />
Robbie, on the other hand, sat and continued to watch the transformation. The bully&#39;s body gradually seemed to deflate like a balloon. The legs retracted into the body until there were pathetic stumps, which are a quarter of the hips.<br />
<br />
The arms were completely retracted into the torso. Rick couldn&#39;t make a single sound anymore, as his voice seemed to have disappeared. The head also began to sink, and the neck shortened. <br />
<br />
Holes began to appear at the hips, as well as on the forehead, when the head was pulled into the trunk. The skin changed color to glossy black. And here in Rick&#39;s place lay his clothes, gradually disappearing into the air, as well as black latex underpants - Rick turned into it.<br />
<br />
Robbie came out when only Rick&#39;s underpants were now lying on the bench. He took it and examined them with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy your new position,&quot; Robbie said, and began to take off his underpants to put on Rick. <br />
<br />
He put it on and began stroking in the groin area. The underpants fit perfectly. With a clasp along the penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re perfect&quot;, - the black guy whispered and began to put on clean clothes. He knew that Rick&#39;s consciousness was preserved and now he couldn&#39;t do anything, feeling how he was hugging Robbie&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry&quot;, - Robbie continued, - &quot;I can turn you into something else later, but you can&#39;t be human anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick didn&#39;t understand what was going on. He couldn&#39;t see, couldn&#39;t hear, couldn&#39;t speak, but he could feel him hugging Robbie&#39;s groin, thighs, and buttocks. He tried to at least do something, but he was unable to move on his own. <br />
<br />
Robbie made fun of Rick a little bit and still decided to stop torturing him like that when he gets home. He put on shorts, a T-shirt, socks and sneakers and went out with a bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one knows you&#39;re missing somewhere&quot;, - Robbie whispered, Rick could somehow hear it.<br />
<br />
The guy calmly walked home. He enjoyed his new underpants, which creaked pleasantly.</p>
