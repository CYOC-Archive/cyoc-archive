<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa sat at the computer scrolling through Chronivac options, while Eric paced carefully around the room, trying not to trip over his long dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea,&quot; Lisa announced.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's two stages to my plan,&quot; she said and turned her chair to face him. &quot;First...&quot; she held up one finger. &quot;I will alter reality so that our bodies are accepted as normal. Everyone's memories will be altered as well. That way we won't have to change back no matter what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric felt a bit conflicted about altering reality. He did love his new body, but the idea of completely rewriting his life scared him. Yet, he loved Lisa and was willing to go along with her plan if that was what she wanted. &quot;Alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
She held up another finger. &quot;Second, I have a plan for your mother if she starts to be a problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric was worried. &quot;'A plan'? What plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have something set on the Chronivac for her for when she comes home. How she acts around us will determine if I use the second part of the plan.&quot; Lisa smiled. &quot;Don't worry. It won't hurt her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Eric. &quot;So long as it doesn't hurt her...&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa spun around to face the computer, while Eric stood over her shoulder to watch her type in changes. As she worked, he realized that Lisa was using the computer now more often than he was, which was understandable. He had a hard time sitting in the dress he wore. Still, he felt a bit uncomfortable when he realized just how much she seemed to be running the show now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Sweetie?&quot; She did not look up from the screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to really love using the Chronivac.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa paused a second. &quot;I do. I really do. I supposed I feel a lot more assertive now with this new body, like I need to change the world.&quot; She started typing again. &quot;This Chronivac is the perfect thing for doing that after all. I dunno. I guess it's just really empowering to be this big... and to have a huge cock. That helps.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said Eric who thought about his new feminine anatomy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess you could say I have the balls to do a lot of things now that I wouldn't have done before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
She finished typing with a flourish of her hands. &quot;Ready to change reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
She hit a key and the world warped around them. The room shifted. For a moment everything blurred into colors and vague shapes. Once reality came back into focus, Eric noticed that he now had larger furniture. Besides the furniture, little else in the room seemed to have changed. There was some make up on his dresser now and, of course, the mirror that Lisa had created, but that seemed to be the extent of new things related to his feminine body.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,&quot; Lisa said, satisfied. &quot;No one should be able to remember how we used to look. Our histories have been rewritten.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember,&quot; said Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;We both do. It's only everyone else that had their memories changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even from Eric's room, they heard the lock turn on the door to the house. The door opened and Eric heard his mother call out, &quot;Hello, I'm back.&quot; Eric froze. He didn't want to face her in this body. What if the Chronivac didn't work on her? What if she freaked out?<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to her,&quot; said Lisa. &quot;I need to finish up the second part of our plan. I'll be down in a few minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; he said and slid through the door, carefully avoiding letting his dress catch on anything. As he slowly made his way down the stairs he noticed a family portrait on the wall. In it was his mother, his father, and a younger version of the girl he had become. &quot;I guess reality really has changed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric? Where are you? God, I have to say that spa was lousy. Terrible service,&quot; said his mother as he reached the bottom of the stairs. She met him at the bottom. She was a bit overweight and had a sort of grumpy look on her face. She seemed a bit smaller now that he had grown. &quot;There you are,&quot; she said. She didn't seem surprised to see him looking like a giant hermaphrodite. &quot;Oh, you're all dressed up. Well, can you still help me get some things from the car? I did a bit of grocery shopping on the way home, and I'm feeling a bit worn out from everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh,&quot; said Eric. He pulled at his dress. &quot;I don't think I can.&quot;<br />
<br />
His mother sighed. &quot;Fine,&quot; she said, frustrated. &quot;You've got time to play dress up with that girl of yours, but no time to help you mother. I get it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said his mother holding up a hand. &quot;Stay here. I wouldn't want you to to dirty up your pretty dress.&quot; The sarcasm was palpable.<br />
<br />
As soon as his mother left to get her bags from the car, Lisa appeared on the stairway. &quot;So I'm 'that girl' now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa,&quot; said Eric trying to placate her. &quot;She's just worn out from traveling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She just came from a spa!&quot; complained Lisa. &quot;I swear, your mother is the only person in the world than can get less relaxed by going to a spa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just take it easy with her, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It depends on how she treats me,&quot; she said and held up the Chronivac remote device. &quot;I'm ready for her if she's decides to be trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa-&quot;<br />
<br />
The door opened and his mother walked in with grocery bags in each hand. &quot;Oh,&quot; said his mother blankly when she noticed Lisa. &quot;You.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lisa. &quot;Me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two stood and stared each other down for what felt like a minute. Eric sweated under his corset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was this dress your idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Lisa and then added with mock friendliness, &quot;Do you like it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric's mother didn't even blink. &quot;I think it's impractical and, frankly, silly looking. Tasteless.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa smiled and raised the remote. &quot;I'll show you 'silly looking.'&quot; She pressed a button and Eric's mother began to shrink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa!&quot; cried Eric.<br />
<br />
Eric's mother sprouted fur all over her body. The grocery bags slipped out of her hands as her fingers shrank into paws. Her nose stretched into a muzzle and her ears grew pointy. All the while, her clothes became baggier and baggier as her body shifted and shrank. Her pants dropped, and a tail poked out from beneath her baggy shirt. In seconds, instead of a woman, there was a Border Collie sitting there half buried under a pile of clothes.<br />
<br />
Eric was too stunned to talk.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a bitch,&quot; was all Lisa said.</p>
