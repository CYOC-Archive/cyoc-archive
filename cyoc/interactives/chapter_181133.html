<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max jogged at a casual rate on his way to school. His massive size 15 feet carried his new muscular body easily.  The jog wasn&#39;t too long, maybe 10 minutes or so. It would give Max time to think about his new situation and his new body. <br />
<br />
Max&#39;s mind pondered the events of this morning and all that had happened. He thought about what he had done to his mom&#39;s sewing doll! Had he actually tried to fuck it? Was he actually that horny? On top of that, he had faced his mom with boxers soiled with a fresh load of his semen. His massive erection was on full display, too! &quot;Oh my God, this is all just so embarrassing...&quot;, Max thinks to himself. His face burns bright red with shame. <br />
<br />
He thought back to the condoms in his room too, along with the dozens and dozens of used tissue and spent condoms. &quot;Jeez, maybe I am a horn dog? I can&#39;t stop myself from fucking a sewing doll and I apparently used all of those condoms!&quot;, Max pondered to himself. <br />
<br />
A couple minutes into the jog and Max was breaking into a light sweat. His new muscular body and feet were doing good; this body was obviously very athletic. Max was being bothered and distracted by an uncomfortable sensation as he ran, though. He was wearing loose mesh gym shorts and loose boxers. His newly enlarged member was bouncing around in his boxers, slapping against his things. Likewise, his balls were jiggling and wobbling about too. As the soft meat slapped against the thighs, he was acutely aware of how much bigger and heavier it was than his old genitals. He truly was a hung jock. The slapping sensation and thinking about his new rod was quickly making his head fill with need and desire, and blood began quickly rushing down into his crotch. He could feel his fat cock slowly getting harder, fatter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, again?!&quot;, he muttered to himself in his newly deep voice. He was annoyed at the rapidly swelling bones in his pants, but he was also scared at how strong his growing urge and pent up need was gaining strength. Fuck he was getting really horny. He stopped jogging for a second to collect himself. He was right on the sidewalk in the park on a clear day, but thankfully no one was around. He was already half hard, but given that his cock was so much bigger, it made an obscene lump. He was worried that if he got fully hard it would be almost pants tearing it would be so big. <br />
<br />
He closed his eyes and tried to calm down. His thoughts kept wandering. Hairy jock boys, fat cocks, muscles. He needed to fuck something, to hump something badly! He wanted to hump a hairy jock boy, he wanted stick his face in a sweaty hairy armpit and sniff up all that stink and musk. Max opened his eyes and lifted one of his arms. He saw a huge brown bush of pit hairs spill out from under his toned biceps. He saw it was beaded with sweat from the jog. He was so turned on by musk and sweat and pits in his degraded horny mind now, he couldn&#39;t help himself. He dug his face in and took a deep sniff, his newly sprouted pit hairs tickling his face and nose. He was rewarded with a sharp stink of BO. Fuck, he forgot to put on deodorant!<br />
<br />
He took his face out of his pit and put his arm down. He saw he was fully hard, his pants tented a ridiculous 9 inches out! Plus, there was a rather large wetspot where his head was pushing against the fabric. &quot;Fuck, I&#39;m a fucking pervert!&quot; he muttered, disgusted and ashamed with himself and his dirty thoughts. His mom was right, his libido was out of control! And now he was fully erect standing in a public park! What was he going to do!</p>
