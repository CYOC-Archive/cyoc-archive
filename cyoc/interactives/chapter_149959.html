<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
I went back to my own room and shut the door. I lay on my bed. What had I done? I had just agreed to be like this for 4 weeks. Was I crazy? I felt like crying but that would be girly. I was a man. I wouldn’t cry over little things like this. The tears came and I couldn’t stop them.<br />
<br />
I stayed in my room. I wasn&#39;t in the mood to face anyone. Definitely not Mum or Mary. I must have fallen asleep as next thing I remember it was morning. Mary barged into the room ‘Hi little sister. I heading down to the shops to meet my friends. It’s now your job to vacuum the lounge’<br />
<br />
‘Piss off’ I said. My voice was so high.<br />
<br />
‘You can do the breakfast dishes as well. And you may as well have these. I&#39;m sure they are a perfect fit’ She tossed some girls panties at me. I immediately recognized them as part of the set matching the training bra I had used on Mary. She snickered then left. I heard the front door close.<br />
<br />
I had the house to myself. Mum was work. She had the breakfast shift at the café where she was a waitress. She would not be home until 3 pm. I headed for the shower.<br />
<br />
I stripped off and naked examined myself in the mirror. There was no mistaking the lack of a penis for anything but that I was now a girl. I had started to develop hairs around my penis but now they were gone as well. I had a hairless mound. Tentatively I explored my new anatomy. I had flaps that opened to reveal a pink hole. I felt dirty. My legs seemed to be marginally further apart but maybe that was just an optical illusion because of the void in my groin. To think that only yesterday I had sported a ten inch penis.<br />
<br />
I examined the rest of my body. Not much else had changed. I don’t think I had shrunk. Though my feet had seemed slightly smaller in my shoes earlier. They looked the same. Without having a tape I estimated that I was still about 5’7 and quite skinny. Taller than Mary by about 3 inches. She had stopped growing several years ago when she started to develop breasts. I was still growing, although slower than I would have liked. Was I now going to stop?<br />
<br />
My legs, and chest still looked the same as they had yesterday. Neither had developed any hairs or muscles. I really was a skinny runt. The ‘bum fluff’ I had started to develop on my upper lip was gone. My face was essentially hairless. Mum had been pestering me to shave and had given me a razor for my last birthday, but with my girly face I had tried to retain every bit of masculinity that I could. I would have to pretend I had followed her advice. <br />
<br />
Of more concern was that my developing Adam’s apple was gone. In the last 6 months it had started to develop but now my throat was smooth. My voice had started to crack but I guess that was now a thing of the past. I tried to make my voice as deep as possible. Repeatedly I said ‘I am a man’ I had to consciously deepen my voice to sound remotely like I used to. But it seemed possible.<br />
<br />
Everything else about me seemed unchanged. My hair was no different and my eyes and eyebrows were still the same. I had longish hair. It had not been cut since the start of last term, 4 months ago now. It was probably half the reason Mary’s friend didn’t know if I was male or female. I would need to rectify that. I decided to get as mannish a haircut as I could. I showered and got dressed. I had to put a rolled up sock in my undies to give myself a familiar bump. Fully clothed in my jeans and a baggy windcheater I examined myself in the mirror again. I looked like me.<br />
<br />
I ate breakfast and cleaned up the kitchen. I even did the vacuuming which was Mary’s chore. As long as she had possession of the medallion I would have to stay on her good side. I had promised to do her chores for the month.<br />
<br />
Once the work was done I collected my wallet and headed down to the shops. I had noticed a men’s barbershop and that is where I was headed. The rental house we now lived in was only about 300 yards from a medium sized shopping mall. I warily approached knowing that Mary was likely to be hanging about. I really didn’t want to run into her.<br />
<br />
Luck was with me. I managed to get into the barber shop without incident. I leafed through some magazines as I waited my turn. There were pictures of busty girls. I made a show of looking at them. My groin no longer responded. <br />
<br />
It was finally my turn. As I sat in the chair the lady barber asked ‘What sort of haircut would you like?’<br />
<br />
‘Short back and sides’ was my response, in as deep a voice as I could muster. It was what I had heard the previous occupant had asked for. He was a man in his 60’s. The barber raised her eyebrows in surprise. <br />
<br />
‘Are you sure Miss? Once I cut there is no going back’ <br />
<br />
I was shocked she had called me ‘Miss’. Was it that obvious? How did she know? ‘I’m not a Miss’ I said glaring at her.<br />
She didn’t say anything else but went about giving me the haircut I had asked for.</p>
