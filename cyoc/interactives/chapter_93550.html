<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day began quietly for Sally and Alice. Sally had transformed back into her human form and dressed herself while Alice had gotten up and dressed herself as well. The two moved to set themselves up for breakfast.  Alice in fact found that Sally was quicker in than she was, as she found the platinum blond woman was actually working eggs and bacon for the both of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;That smells good,&quot; Alice commented as she walked into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should,&quot; Sally commented.<br />
<br />
Alice slowly nodded, &quot;You ready for the car ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll stay here,&quot; Sally said slowly, &quot;I&#39;d need to let the police know if I were going with you to Denver to pick up Karl and that&#39;d end up being more trouble than its worth... besides, I will have some work today...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice sighed. Sally had lost her job working within the school district, but that didn&#39;t mean she was without work. It wasn&#39;t work she liked and it was a considerable step down for her, but it was better than nothing. The local supermarket had approached her and employed her in their back room and warehouse area within the building and they had only come along after she had been revealed as a werewolf. In recent years, many of their suppliers had tried to sell the store food that was rotten or nearly so. Their normal inspectors did catch some of them before they could be stocked on the shelves, but a lot did make it to the shelves and the market had very nearly faced a lawsuit over the fact that they hadn&#39;t done enough to prevent such items from being sold and the market did join in a class action lawsuit against the suppliers who had sold them the bad food in the first place. They then gave Sally a job using her heightened senses to make sure nothing was rotten or mislabeled as well various custodial duties as well. Both Alice and Karl had heard Sally complain about the job, but it was the only one that she could get after her exposure where she wasn&#39;t facing taunts, insults, threats, and jeers.<br />
<br />
&quot;They couldn&#39;t give you a day off?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just to pick Karl up from the airport?&quot; Sally sighed, &quot;Alice... dear... I know that show tracking down Karl and asking him to come on their show as they continue to talk over... what happened... is a big thing for Karl specifically, but it&#39;s nothing that special as far as the grocer is concerned. You know that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice walked over to a small round dinner table that she and Karl generally shared and now shared with Sally since they had started hiding her from mob that had harassed Sally earlier. She sighed as she did so. Sally noticed it and inwardly sighed as well. She knew full well that Alice and Karl would always be there for her and would do nearly anything for her, even before they had said they would. They had always been friendly to her and had been the closest to her. Those she knew from her previous job with the school district had been fairly friendly but not as close as Karl and Alice had been. Much of that was due to the fact that Alice had grown up with Sally and introduced her to Karl while they had been in college. The three of them had been good friends ever since and stayed very close. In fact Sally had followed Alice and Karl to Glenwood Springs to stay with her friends.<br />
<br />
Sally had been alone as a werewolf for years. Unlike Sharon Barlow, Sally had been turned into a werewolf. It had happened back in high school. Sally had known a young teen whom she had been attracted to and they had hesitantly dated several times. Unfortunately, the boy was also a rather scatter brained werewolf. On the night of the senior prom, the boy had taken Sally to the date and the two had a very good time, including Sally losing her virginity to him. Things seemed great until her first full moon after the senior prom when she transformed for the first time. Thankfully, her parents had been out on an overnight trip and Sally hadn&#39;t bothered them. She then stumbled onto boy in his werewolf form later that evening in the woods when both learned that being bitten by a werewolf wasn&#39;t the ONLY way to become a werewolf. Sally had wanted to freak out at him, but his parents were present as well and they lit into him for being &quot;so stupid&quot; and she stayed quiet through that lecture. They then helped her and had been supportive, and Sally grew to admit being with them had been wonderful.<br />
<br />
Then the boy&#39;s father&#39;s job had forced them to move three towns away and Sally was left alone with no other werewolves to be with. She spent the last months of high school as a lone wolf with only Alice being really close to her. She was a lone wolf in college now with Karl joining Alice as a close friend, and once she graduated college she stuck to them. They were friends that would do anything for each other, though Sally did her best to keep her lycanthropy secret, for fear that Alice and Karl wouldn&#39;t be her friends if they found out. Though, over time, Sally remembered the security she had felt with her boyfriend and his family as a pack and she longed for it. As a result, while she feared exposure, a real part of her had fantasized about turning Karl and Alice and then they could be a pack together. Then came &quot;the incident&quot; and the backlash that came after it. At first, Sally thought that Karl and Alice had deliberately betrayed her and set it up on purpose, which furthered her initial fears. A part of her considered attacking them as punishment for exposing her, but when Karl and Alice apologized and try to make up for the mistake, Sally began to realize that she had let her own private fears get the better of her. <br />
<br />
Their apologies reminded Sally that Karl and Alice were her best friends and they would do anything for her, as she would do for them. It was what made her realize that she probably could have trusted Karl and Alice with her secret. She still wanted to turn them and together they could be a pack, but with all the negative press and laws that werewolves were having to take, she didn&#39;t want Karl and Alice to have to endure that. She had no idea that if push came to shove, Alice and Karl had already privately agreed to have Sally turn them. <br />
<br />
And that was the situation they were presently in. Sally noticed it when Alice sighed and practically dropped into her chair. She personally wanted to go with Alice to pick up Karl, as they were the closest to Sally and they might well have been her pack. But just because she was a werewolf and saw them as her pack members, that didn&#39;t mean that the job she did have shared the opinion. She would have to go to work, and even if she could get out of it, the fact that they would have to drive to Denver to pick up Karl would require some notification to law enforcement that she would be travelling as part of the various registration laws that came about after &quot;the incident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;ll be okay, Alice,&quot; Sally said again after a few moments, as the sizzle of the cooking eggs and bacon became such that it was obvious that they were completely cooked, &quot;It&#39;s not like you and Karl are running off together, are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...? No!&quot; Alice protested, &quot;We&#39;ll stay here and do ANYTHING to protect you. You&#39;re our friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Sally smiled as she set down a couple of plates to put their cooked breakfast on, &quot;but we are still in the real world... I have to work and can&#39;t get out of it... I don&#39;t like it one bit... but it isn&#39;t as though I have better choices at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we did,&quot; Alice said weakly looking down.<br />
<br />
Sally nodded. Alice&#39;s statement was an obvious one that they couldn&#39;t get away from.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, it&#39;d be okay,&quot; Sally assured her friend as she set a plate down in front of Alice, &quot;We have a lot to do today.&quot;</p>
