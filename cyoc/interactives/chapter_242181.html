<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate plopped down on his bed. He didn&#39;t know what to think of the strange woman in his house. A woman he&#39;d never met before, never even heard of. Where did Mom even find her, he wondered. And what was with what she said as he went back upstairs? That was definitely weird. <br />
<br />
He rolled over on his bed, laying on his stomach as he began playing on his phone oblivious to the clouds parting outside revealing a bright full moon in the night sky. As he scrolled through his social media apps, he was blissfully unaware as his right ear slowly grew to a lupine point and fur grew in around it. A moment later, his left ear did the same. He caught a glimpse of his right palm and noticed it was looking a bit rougher than usual. He checked his left and noticed it looked the same. He then saw his forearms looked hairier than usual. His right ear started itching and when he reached up to scratch it, he realized something was wrong. He felt it with his hand and was shocked at what he felt. Dropping his phone on the bed he ran over to the full length mirror on his closet door. He was shocked at his reflection. Turning his head, side to side, he checked out his newly transformed ears. He gasped as he watched short hairs growing along the sides of his face. <br />
<br />
“What the hell?” He whispered. <br />
<br />
Nate looked down and noticed his legs had gotten significantly hairier. He stumbled back and fell to the floor. He stopped his fall with his hands and watched in shock as each of his fingernails grew out into thick, sharp claws. A wave of pleasure rippled through his body and he let out a moan as his back muscles grew and reformed, straining his t-shirt until the fabric gave out tearing right down the middle, exposing his now fur covered back. <br />
<br />
“Oh no…not my favorite T-shirt…” he growled, surprised how much deeper his voice suddenly was. He tore away the tattered remains and tossed it aside. He looked up at the mirror, surprised to he how more bestial his face looked and watched as his teeth grew out into sharp fangs. His nose looked more lupine as well. He drew his lips back and let out a low growl that quickly turned to a smile of utter joy. He grimaced again and rolled over, sitting on the floor and watching in awe as his feet stretched and reformed into large digitigrade paws and his toenails grew out into sharp claws. He couldn&#39;t help but smile again as he took in all his changes. <br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s heart skipped a beat when a loud knock at his bedroom door startled him. He turned to the door and let out a low, quiet growl. <br />
<br />
“You about done changing in there?” asked Miss Angie. “Come on, open up. Let me get a look at you.”<br />
<br />
Nate slowly got up, still feeling a bit unsteady on his digitigrade paws as he made his way to the bedroom door. He grabbed the doorknob with one furry, paw-like hand and took a deep breath as he opened the door to his eternally youthful babysitter who was grinning from ear to ear. <br />
<br />
“Oh my, look at you! You&#39;re a natural, I could tell from the moment I saw you that you were destined to be a werewolf and I was absolutely right!” <br />
<br />
“You did this to me?” growled Nate. <br />
<br />
“Well, of course silly.” Miss Angie started walking around Nate taking in all his changes. “Now, granted, I did have some help from your Mom. Don&#39;t be mad but she found one of your notebooks and showed it to me.” <br />
<br />
“Wait a minute, you&#39;re Miss Angie, aren&#39;t you. I&#39;ve heard the kids tell stories about you. Better be good or Miss Angie will turn you into an animal…” Nate walked over to his bed and sat down. Miss Angie took a seat on his desk chair across from him. <br />
<br />
“Is that what they&#39;re saying? Hah. Nothing could be further from the truth. I only transform people I like. My magic is a gift, a reward, not a punishment.” <br />
<br />
“But I was so mean to you earlier. Why did you change me?” <br />
<br />
“Because we could be great friends if you gave me a chance. I can tell that much from your writing.” Miss Angie swiveled around in the chair. “But I was a little irked at you, so I only changed you this much. But if you&#39;re really good tomorrow you may just have a snout and be on all fours.” <br />
<br />
“I am sorry about that.” Nate did sound like he genuinely meant it too. <br />
<br />
“Thanks, I appreciate that. And now, come along Wolfy, it&#39;s time you tried out your new abilities.”<br />
<br />
She led Nate downstairs and opened the sliding patio door. “Go on now, let your new werewolf instincts run and enjoy. But I expect you back here in a few hours, ok?” <br />
<br />
Nate nodded and then ran outside. This was going to be fun.</p>
