<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think we would like to rest Father,&quot; I said speaking for us all. &quot;Three of us have been <br />
transformed into girls and we'll need a little bit of time to get used to these bodies. <br />
Nausikaa and Dike will probably take longer than I will since they didn't want to be <br />
girls. We all need a little time to absorb that we're your daughters now. Also it's been a <br />
long day for us. Taken altogether we wouldn't learn much if we trained right away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Poseidon nodded and said, &quot;You make a good argument Anthea. Do you agree <br />
Semele? You've changed the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Semele jumped a bit then said, &quot;Yes Father.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then by all means rest,&quot; Poseidon said smiling. &quot;Your training will begin tomorrow. I'll <br />
also have gifts for you. Now Amphitrite will lead you to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we go Father could you tell our families what happened?&quot; I asked wanting my <br />
family to at least know I was ok.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've already spoken to them,&quot; Poseidon said. &quot;Your family accepted what I told them <br />
after a little convincing Anthea while Nausikaa's thought I was a demon and tried <br />
banishing me even after their attempts failed. I don't think I convinced them. Semele's <br />
family accepted me without any convincing while Dike's took quite a bit to convince <br />
them I wasn't a demon. I told them I could bring them to this world but it would be up <br />
to you and them to decide. Now go rest and I'll see you tomorrow.&quot; He rose and left <br />
the dining hall looking a little worried.<br />
<br />
Amphitrite rose and said, &quot;Follow me girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
We followed behind Amphitrite for a few seconds and then Nausikaa asked, &quot;Why are <br />
we named like we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amphitrite looked back at is smiling and said, &quot;Your father thought ancient Greek <br />
names would suit you. Each of your names means something. Anthea means flower <br />
or blossom, Nausikaa means burner of ships, Dike means justice, and Semele means <br />
once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does Father have something special planned for us?&quot; I asked extremely curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he does and maybe he doesn't,&quot; Amphitrite said shrugging her shoulders. <br />
&quot;Either way you need to train since monsters will come after you. You're safe here in <br />
the palace, on Olympus, and a training camp but outside of those places you are in <br />
danger of being attacked. We can't interfere directly if you get attacked by a monster <br />
because of an ancient rule. We can however offer some help if you ask and we can <br />
give you gifts. Now here's your room.&quot; She opened what looked like a giant clam shell, <br />
which it turned out to be but only half of the shell, to reveal our room.<br />
<br />
Our room was huge with open arched windows allowing deep sea fish and other deep <br />
sea creatures to swim through. On one wall there was what appeared to be a closet <br />
with another giant clam shell for a door. Around the room on raised platforms there <br />
were four vanities made of marble inlaid with gold and gems. Next to the vanities were <br />
giant clams which I figured were our beds. This was confirmed when Amphitrite said, <br />
&quot;The clams won't turn you into pearls when you sleep in them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh is there anyway to close the windows and lock the door?&quot; Semele asked blushing <br />
a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need for that,&quot; Amphitrite said smiling. &quot;Poseidon set a ward on this room <br />
so no male can see you girls in here unless you invite them or there is an emergency. <br />
He made it so strong that even he can't see you in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we open the clams?&quot; Dike asked looking a little afraid like she would be <br />
turned into a pearl despite Amphitrite's assurances.<br />
<br />
Amphitrite smiled and put her hand on Dike's shoulder saying, &quot;Just walk to them and <br />
they'll open. You should be drawn to a particular one. That will be your bed while <br />
you're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
I did deal like one of them was calling me and when I went over to it the shell opened <br />
up revealing the dark tan mass of the mollusk within. It was Nausikaa who asked what <br />
the others were thinking. &quot;Where are the pillows and blankets?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think we need pillows with these beds,&quot; I said with a smile. &quot;As for blankets I'll <br />
show you.&quot; I untied the belt around my waist then reached up and slipped the pins out <br />
of the fabric on my shoulders causing it to fall around my feet. I put the pins on the <br />
vanity then picked up what had been my clothes and put it on my bed. I turned to <br />
Nausikaa, Dike, and Semele saying, &quot;Our clothes are our blankets.&quot;<br />
<br />
They looked at me shocked while Amphitrite said, &quot;Anthea is right girls. Your chitons <br />
can be used as blankets if you desire or you can sleep without them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we'll be naked if we do,&quot; Semele said looking embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're all girl's here now,&quot; I told her putting my hands on her shoulders. &quot;You shouldn't <br />
be embarrassed about being naked in front of other girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were boy's before though,&quot; Semele said avoiding looking at me. &quot;Mommy told me <br />
it wasn't right to look at naked guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took her hand and placed it on my breast asking, &quot;Do boy's have breasts like a girl <br />
does?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No but I keep seeing as you were,&quot; Semele said blushing some more.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll soon get used to seeing them as girls,&quot; Amphitrite promised. &quot;You may be <br />
embarrassed right now but you only knew them for a few hours as their male selves. <br />
Your embarrassment will fade as you spend time with them. Now I'll let you girls get <br />
some sleep. I'll see you tomorrow.&quot; She turned around and closed the door leaving us <br />
alone in the room.<br />
<br />
Nausikaa looked at me and asked, &quot;Do you know what story we're in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't seen this one before so perhaps it's new,&quot; I said shrugging my shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you have no idea what will happen to us?&quot; Nausikaa asked looking a bit afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm not an oracle,&quot; I said smiling. I turned serious and said, &quot;Even if we were in <br />
one of the stories we had read it would be changed just by is being here. There's no <br />
way to know if we'll be transformed again or not. I suspect that if we are transformed <br />
again that Father will change us back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing we can do?&quot; Dike asked?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we can keep our eyes out for those things we know can transform us like the <br />
Medallion of Zulo and the Chronovac,&quot; I said sighing. &quot;We can avoid them and thus <br />
reduce our chances of being transformed again. Now I'm a bit tired so let's get some <br />
sleep.&quot; the others followed my example with taking their chitons off and using them as <br />
blankets. Once we were in the clams they closed and I sincerely hoped that we <br />
weren't going to be transformed into pearls.<br />
<br />
The next morning we Amphitrite woke us up and after using the facilities which <br />
happened to be on the other side of the closet we went back to the dining hall for <br />
breakfast. Poseidon looked like he had a rough night. There were bags under his eyes <br />
and he was continually frowning. &quot;Is something wrong Father?&quot; I asked upon seeing <br />
him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing you need to concern yourselves with for now,&quot; Poseidon said trying to smile. <br />
&quot;Maybe in a few days when you've had some training I'll tell you what it is. For now <br />
though try to pit it out of your minds and concentrate on training. After we eat I'll give <br />
you your gifts.&quot;<br />
<br />
We ate in silence then adjourned to the throne room. I had expected Poseidon and <br />
Amphitrite to grow to giant size but they didn't. Instead Poseidon went to a tray and <br />
said, &quot;The gifts that you're about to receive will help you in your battles. Anthea step <br />
forward.&quot; I did and Poseidon gave me a bracelet with tiny seashells and marine <br />
animals embedded in what looked to be gemstones. There was a metal disc in the <br />
middle of it and the clasp was a ring shaped like a clamshell through which a bar <br />
would go through. I put it on while Poseidon said, &quot;This will turn into a shield when you <br />
tap it. It can be used both as defense and offense since it will shoot water out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Father,&quot; I said bowing a bit then stepping back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nausikaa step forward,&quot; Poseidon said. When she did he handed her a necklace <br />
shaped like a hippocampus and said, &quot;This necklace will turn into a sword when you <br />
pull the tail from the body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Father,&quot; Nausikaa said bowing to Poseidon.<br />
<br />
Dike's gift was a ring that turned her invisible when tapped and Semele's gift was a <br />
pair of earrings shaped like lobster claws which turned into a bow and arrow when she <br />
pulled them from her ears. Poseidon smiled at us and said, &quot;Your gifts will return to <br />
you should you lose them. If you want to trade with each other that is fine since I don't <br />
know which one of you will be good at archery or good with a sword. Happy late <br />
birthday girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are we Father?&quot; I asked looking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;All four of you are eleven with a few months separating the oldest and youngest,&quot; <br />
Poseidon said smiling more. &quot;Anthea was born on December 6th, Nausikaa was born <br />
on Feburary 10th, Dike was born on May 3rd, and Semele was born on May 6th. Now <br />
you should get to your training. I have some things that I need to attend to but I'll <br />
come by to see how you're doing later.&quot; With that we were ushered out by a couple of <br />
mermaids to begin our training. As we left I looked back and saw the worried <br />
expression on Poseidon's face and wondered what could make a god worry like that.</p>
