<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Alex was about to walk inside his home to clean up from working with Nate laying sod; Zylina who was watching, making sure she wasn’t seen by Nate as she approached. Like typical female weres, she was stacked where it counted. With a petite curvy figure for her age and auburn hair; Zylina was a stunning beauty who could have any man she wanted. When in her werewolf fursona, she had the fur markings indicative to that of the red wolf but with piercing blue eyes. Out of her fursona, her eyes are still blue, but with a touch of grey.<br />
“Excuse me,” Zylina speaking as she approaches Alex; “can I ask you something?”<br />
<br />
Alex who was looking forward to a cool shower and fresh clothes after his grueling morning of work, turns around to see a girl from one of his classes in high school. Instantly recognizing her scent as werewolf, however not remembering her name.<br />
“I’m sorry,” Alex looking at the girl: “I can’t remember your name. I know we had math class together last school year-“<br />
“Zylina Nash,” she speaks; “but that’s not what my question is about. You wouldn’t happen to be in a werewolf pack accepting new members now would you?”<br />
“The pack I am a member of is always accepting new members,” Alex answering; “but don’t you already belong to one?”<br />
“My parents wouldn’t let me join one,” Zylina speaking the truth; “with my father’s job, he was always out of town a lot and was worried for my safety.”<br />
“So they finally relented,” Alex sitting on the front step of his house; “so why do you want to join my pack?”<br />
“Love,” Zylina smiling; “I love a certain werewolf and want to be with him.”<br />
“I’m spoken for,” Alex shaking his head.<br />
“Oh I know that,” Zylina rolling her eyes; “the whole school knows you and Ben are an item. And just to keep you from feeling nervous,” Zylina speaking; “I’m not interested in either of you.”<br />
“Then who,” Alex chuckling; “who has stolen your heart?”<br />
“That’s the problem,” Zylina sighing; “he doesn’t know. I’ve tried to get his attention, but I’ve always felt nervous and scared. And I kind of want to keep him a secret for now.”<br />
“A secret crush,” Alex shaking his head; “well I’ll let our pack leader Austin Perry know you want to join. Our pack likes to meet primarily on the new and full moons,” Alex texting Austin; “so our next regularly scheduled gathering will be on September 16. A full two weeks from now.”<br />
“So I won’t be joining until then,” Zylina looking crestfallen.<br />
“Not necessarily,” Alex responding; “we generally make exceptions for new member inductions. We did when Nate Anderson joined and became a werewolf,” Alex chuckling; “that was one wild night for him.”<br />
“But I’m already a werewolf,” Zylina speaking; “naturally born.”<br />
“Not an issue,” Alex getting up; “Austin will get back to me when he can and I’ll let you know. I just need your phone number to reach you when we will meet up.”<br />
“Great,” Zylina looking please as she plugs it into Alex’s phone; “I can’t wait.”<br />
<br />
Zylina darts off before Alex could speak; dashing into the nearby woods. Feeling pleased that the first part of her plan to win Nate’s heart has passed with ease. She know’s he has seen her in her fursona back when she confronted Jean; confident that he has not seen her human form, Zylina chances a daring stroll by the Anderson house, hoping to see her love as she walks back home. Seeing him getting into his truck and drive off; Zylina’s heart skips a beat as she could not hide her smile. Nate saw her; but her heart sunk a bit when he didn’t so much as give her a second look. Not knowing that Nate was on his way to the Talbot house to speak to Peter; Zylina makes her way back home to await Alex’s call.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
“Thank goodness,” Nate shaking his head; “that is a load off my mind. But I still have all these delinquent accounts that need addressing.”<br />
“My suggestion,” Peter looking at the figures is to either sell the debt to a collection agency for pennies on the dollar or have a professional tax accountant look at writing them off as a business loss. I recommend the collection agency slant.”<br />
“How so,” Nate looking dubious.<br />
“One,” Peter closing up the computer program; “it’s off your books and you got some money to help deal with paying your suppliers. Two,” Peter grinning; “your delinquent clients will have to deal with a collection agency and have their credit destroyed as a result.”<br />
“And I lose the client as a result,” Nate sighing.<br />
“Since most are one time jobs,” Peter speaking; “it’s not as if you were going to get more work from them to begin with. But I’d hold off on this big one here,” Peter pointing too one particular name; “Talbot restoration’s does some work for them maintaining his great grandfather’s Ford Model T. The Jenkin’s are a little slow to pay their bills what with their construction company, but they do pay. Just don’t call them relentlessly each day,” Peter chuckling; “they don’t like it, all clients do actually.”<br />
<br />
“Construction Company,” Nate looking at the name Jenkins; “perhaps they need a landscaper for their jobs.”<br />
“You would need to take some drafting and surveying courses,” Peter answering flatly; “that’s college level and you would also most likely need to be able to understand grading and on the rare occasion storm water management. Jenkins Construction deals with a lot of commercial developments.”<br />
“I probably need that stuff anyways,” Nate sighing; “but first things first. I need to learn how to keep my books in better order.”<br />
“An accounting software program at any computer store could help,” Peter responding; “but if you have the knowhow, you could always use your computer’s spread sheet program. You just got to know how to create formulas for specific cells and link them to each other.”<br />
“I don’t think I have the patience for that,” Nate answering; “Eric might if he wasn’t busy spending every free moment he has with his girlfriends.”<br />
<br />
Peter chuckles as he hands over Nates ledgers; getting up and heading to the kitchen for coffee and pouring two cups, handing one to Nate. Peter sits down at the table and encourages Nate to do the same.<br />
“Speaking of girlfriends,” Peter sipping his coffee; “what are your intentions with my sister.”<br />
“I already had this talk with your father,” Nate rolling his eyes; “or did she have the talk with him? Anyway,” Nate sighing; “as soon as I get enough money scraped together, I’ll hopefully be able to propose to her.”<br />
“Really,” Peter looking stunned; “so soon?”<br />
“Well,” Nate thinking; “after High School at the latest. Besides,” Nate looking at Peter; “Jean has been eyeing a few rings during our walks downtown. I think she is trying to send me signals,” Nate chuckling; “but since we are on the subject with girlfriends, what about you and Liv Robinson?”<br />
“You know how it’s going with her,” Peter looking embarrassed; “you know she crashed the were-lion gathering last month and rode me right?”<br />
“Yeah,” Nate chuckling; “Jean told me. She also said you two ended up doing it on a tree branch?”<br />
“Lions, were not meant to be in trees,” Peter grumbling; “despite Liv’s insistence that the branch could support our weight. It didn’t.”<br />
“How did your father take it,” Nate laughing; “what with a wer-leopard among lions.”<br />
<br />
“I laughed my ass off,” Leon walking into the kitchen to join them; “I and Regina seeing Liv pulling splinters out of Peter’s ass, it was hilarious.”<br />
“Then you told me to bed her as you and mom sauntered off,” Peter looking embarrassed.<br />
“And I can’t wait to see what Jean does to you,” Leon looking at Nate; “at the next wer-lion pride gathering.”<br />
“But I’m a werewolf,” Nate looking curious; “aren’t there rules for the gatherings? Such as were specific species only? Unless of course they are your spouse?”<br />
“Yeah,” Leon answering; “but I’m the were-lion king. Being royalty does have a few perks,” Leon grinning; “such as bending rules for the sake of his cubs. Jean should be home in a few hours,” Leon getting up and grinning; “stay for supper Nate, Regina will be making chicken a-la king.”</p>
