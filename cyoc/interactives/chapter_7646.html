<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa opened her eyes slowly. The sunlight glowed in her eyes and she could barely make out anything. She was in a bed, her parents bed, and lying next to her was... OH... MY... GOD! It was Hank Thompson, Quarterback in the school's Football Team! He was sleeping, luckily, and she thought back at what had happened the last day. She'd been holding a party in her house(her parents were away in Swiss anyway) and Hank had asked her to dance, and they'd dance and they'd... She hugged a pillow. It was as if all her dreams were coming true. She looked under the quilt and smiled. Blood, only a little, but that proved it. She'd done it with Hank Thompson. The girls would be SOO jealous!<br />
<br />
She was interrupted in her thoughts when a odd feeling started in her stomach. She realized suddenly how much she'd been drinking yesterday, and she rushed into the bathroom (luckily connected to the bedroom) and rushed up to the toilet. She prepared to throw up, but nothing came. She bent ower the bowl for a short while but then relaxed. She was probably just being itty over having had sex with... Oh, it was too much.<br />
<br />
She stood up and checked herself in the mirror, admiring her perky and rather big breasts and her fine figure. Of course Hank'd fallen for her, she was drop dead gorgeous. And no zits at all. She felt the sensation in her stomach again, but smiled as it developed into a warmth that spread down to her lower parts. Perhaps if she was silent she could...<br />
<br />
She started massaging her breasts, noticing how the nipples were already stiff. Her breasts were perfect. Firm but not hard, and they jiggled alot. Guys loved that. She saw Hank before her and nearly gasped as she remembered how it'd felt. She didn't even notice when her breasts began to grow, slightly only, but when she reached down to her pussy she realized she was completely hairless down there.<br />
<br />
She finally noticed how her breasts had gone from C to D, almost DD, and the pleasure she experienced as she touched them was undescribable. She moaned, a bit too loud, and heard how Hank woke up in the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that's good, now I can fu...&quot; She thought, but realized how silly that sounded. They'd both been really drunk, and no way he'd want to have sex with her now. &quot;But I WANT to fuck him!&quot; she thought, and she heard how Hank walked up to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Lisa, are you okay?&quot; He asked. This was almost enough for her to come. He cared about her. She felt her skin begin to dry and noticed suddenly that it had taken on a deep green color, strangely scaly-like. Her breasts were lime-green, as was the rest of the front of her torso. She realized her hands were stuck on her breasts(&quot;God, they're big&quot;) and she had to try hard to get them loose. She turned to the door when Hank started knocking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa, please, answer me!&quot; He shouted. Lisa smiled for herself. She needed to fuck, to mate, or she would explode. Her stomach was swelling slightly and she opened the door to Hank. He gasped as he saw her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who're you!&quot; He asked, but she ignored him. A thin fluid excruded from her hands and feet and, even though she didn't know why, she jumped on Hank. She drew her hands over his mouth, forcing him to swollow the gook, while he resisted fruitlessly. It didn't even occur to her how she could overcome the strongest one in the team.<br />
<br />
Hank coughed once or twice when she released him, and he experienced the burning heat inside him. It was much quicker now than with Lisa, and when he stumbled into the bathroom he was already turning green. Lisa looked out the window and saw her parents pool. That would be perfect. She jumped out the window, landed without even harming herself, and waited for Hank to follow.<br />
<br />
Hank was groaning and moaning now, his underwear bulging when his massive cock erected itself. He looked down on Lisa through the window with two big, yellow eyes, and smiled. Finally his underwear ripped apart and his manliness, much bigger now than before, stood with all it's pride. Lisa made a croaking sound and Hank followed out through the window. The two began swimming around eachother, Lisa now rather fat as her stomach had swollen greatly. Finally the two climbed up on the side of the pole and mated, Hank caressing and fondling her big breasts. He was still the old Hank, even with new instincts, and there was nothing he loved more than big breasts. He entered her slick and slimy cunt with a wet slopping sound and the two of them humped rhythmically. Finally Hank came, and not a second to soon. Lisa waited a short while and then jumped down in the pool and Hank watched calmly as about a hundred of eggs the size of ping-pong balls pushed their way out of her cunt. He began collecting grass and straws and threw them into the pool, making sure the eggs could stick to them. He also turned off the pump so the water would stagnant and bring many insects they could feed on.<br />
<br />
Lisa climbed up again and the two began humping, just for fun. Mating was over, but what was a bit of fun between friends?<br />
<br />

<br />
All through town events much like this happened. People everywhere turned into either half-men/half-creatures, mythical beings or even the different sex. Many young people quickly grew a bit older, reaching maturity sooner than ever, and old people experienced vigor and fertility again.<br />
<br />
The Military Base, however, took notice of this strange turn of events.</p>
