<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I blinked heavily in surprise at who I found sitting on an empty desk in the office that had once been Trip Johnson's. It was my boss's wife. She sat there with a look that was half smug half seductive. She was fully dressed, but the dress she wore, looked more like it was designed be extremely provocative yet business-like at the same time. It reminded me of some movies of a much more &quot;adult&quot; nature that I had had before the divorce. They ended up being sold at a garage sale after Terri and I had started up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hello, John,&quot; my boss's wife said with a soft smile, &quot;it would appear you've found me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She repositioned herself on the desk and leaned forward, giving me quite the view of her cleavage. Her scent was stronger then the faint traces that I'd detected around the office, and being female, her scent was also very attractive to me. However, I wasn't looking for her, and she was my boss's wife. I didn't know my boss's name, and had only rarely seen him or his wife. My boss looked like a fairly strong individual, but from where I was at the office parties that he and wife attended, I was far enough away that I could never truly tell whether it was the suit he wore or himself. His wife, however, always seemed to wear something similar to what she was wearing now and flaunted the fact she was probably a 9.5 to a 10 on any guy's &quot;hotness scale.&quot; And, today, I got a good idea as to why.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, ma'am,&quot; I said politely, &quot;I was looking for someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you found someone, Mr. Will, you found me,&quot; my boss's wife said with a smile, that did not look entirely honest.<br />
<br />
I backed away nervously as she then got up and began to approach me, swaying her hips as she did so. The look in her eyes was fierce and authoritative. Like she knew what she wanted and was accustomed to getting it. Part of that made me somewhat nervous. My boss already had me looking for Fred Jones to escort him out. And so far, I'd been unable to find him. Pete hadn't been able to help as my interaction with him had indicated. Keeping Fred hidden from my boss was a tough job, and commonly involved a lot of code words to ensure that that was done. If anyone who wasn't in on the attempts to keep Fred &quot;employed&quot; was around, the staff would &quot;play dumb&quot; as though the guy looking for Fred didn't know that Fred had been fired. At times it even included the use of false names to try and play to that, hence my use of my middle name as my surname in that case.<br />
<br />
But that wouldn't help me at present. My boss's wife would likely know if I was lying in some way, just as Terri did on the night that she bit me.<br />
<br />
&quot;You smell quite good, Mr. Will,&quot; my boss's wife said as she came closer, forcing me to back up against the closed door to the office, &quot;new cologne?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, ma'am,&quot; I answered, half nervously, knowing that her scent already had my attention, and the fact that if I succumbed to her scent, my own wolf would come out in the middle of the afternoon, in a public place, and would get me shot by the police when I tried to escape... and if I did escape, the human population would probably get a lot of images of a male transformed werewolf running through an office building or the streets, &quot;It's... uh... something... uh different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said in a half seductive tone as she pressed herself up against me, &quot;and maybe in time you'll begin to look... heh-heh... different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what you mean,&quot; I spoke carefully, &quot;Your husband has me looking for Fred Jones at the moment, ma'am. I should get get...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or maybe we could get a little closer,&quot; she replied and ran her hands down my chest and torso, &quot;and we'll look very different in a short while.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then moved her hands to mine in an attempt to physically move them toward her, but I managed to slide away from her and get some distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband has me looking for Fred Jones, ma'am,&quot; I said to her, &quot;He's somewhere in the building and your husband wants him gone. I need to get him out or I'll be fired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you'll deny the will of an Alpha to do what your boss wants?&quot; she replied, but in a way that made &quot;boss&quot; sound odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alpha...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Fangton's Alpha Female, which would be me,&quot; she gave a smile, which looked as though she was hiding something and enjoying it, &quot;you're here... in a vacant office. You're with me, a member of your pack. Wouldn't you want to be with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm with Terri and Night,&quot; you said carefully, &quot;and you're my boss's wife. If he were to catch us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wouldn't mind,&quot; she told me, &quot;Just as I haven't minded when he's taken both Terri and Night in the same evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
That elicited a half angry sounding growl. A good part of my instincts had wanted to fight Devon for being with Terri, and it was only the fear of being killed by him that kept me from starting an outright fight over the matter. My boss's wife's comment brought those thoughts back to the front of my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;My, my,&quot; she mused, &quot;so possessive of one you divorced for being fat... I suppose you're only with her again because lycanthropy carries certain benefits...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never hated her,&quot; I answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; she gave me a much more authoritative look, &quot;but she is my husband's now. Not yours. And YOU will get only what is offered to you at my or my husband's discretion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your husband?&quot; I said slowly, sounding a little lost.<br />
<br />
&quot;Devon Lycos,&quot; she gave a triumphant smile, &quot;Fangton's Alpha Male. The Pack is his, and if you wish to survive in it, you will obey your Alphas.&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked at that. Devon Lycos was my boss, and was apparently the same Devon that Terri and Night were nervous about concerning the meeting coming tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get the sneaking suspicion that if I take you up on your offer, I'll get in trouble at work for it,&quot; I told her, trying to sound firm and not nervous, &quot;your husband, who is also the local Alpha Male has given me very different orders, and they were not to have sex with you. And Terri and Night have told me that you just go along with what he says... which would mean that if he catches us, and decides to punish me for it, you wouldn't say anything in my defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
I moved to a side, trying to make sure that she couldn't get close to me, as she was still trying to move in a fairly seductive manner. I didn't know why she was doing this, but I got the impression that I was in the middle of a &quot;damned if you do, damned if you don't&quot; situation. As I did so, I got closer to the desk, which had nothing on it and also looked as though it had taken some damage. I managed to see some marks in the wood that looked almost like claw-marks. My nose also picked up something that smelled faintly of sex. That then reminded me of something Night had told me...<br />
<br />
That after Terri had joined the Pack, they seemed to get a new girl every month. While Trip Johnson had been dead longer than Terri had been a werewolf, that didn't mean that Devon wasn't using the vacant office as his own personal &quot;sex room&quot; after Johnson's death. First it would have been him and his wife in here, and after Terri joined his pack about six months ago, this might be where he brought in new pack members for him to mate with. After all, the werewolf scents that I'd detected seemed to lead toward the offices of some of the secretaries. One was male, which gave me a slight fearful feeling, the others were female which partially turned me on, just as my boss's wife's scent was starting to turn me on.<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't tell you NOT to have sex with me,&quot; she countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well... Fred Jones called when his wife had cancer and said he wouldn't be back until she got better,&quot; I replied, &quot;when she didn't get better in a day, your husband fired him. I was given orders to find him and escort him out.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, I managed to duck down and sneak past her and made it to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he told me I had to do that within thirty minutes, and at present, I have ten minutes left and I still need to find him,&quot; I finished and ducked out the door.<br />
<br />
As I made my way back into the hallways, I faintly heard her curse, &quot;fuck&quot; through the closed door. I didn't fully know where all of that came from. Maybe she and Devon were trying to engineer something that would get me in trouble at work and make me look bad in front of the Pack prior to the meeting I was still privately dreading. Maybe she was privately detested by Devon's treating of the pack like his own harem and was starting some private &quot;revenge&quot; of her own. Whatever it was, it would surely mean trouble for me, and I rushed on to carry out the orders I'd been given.<br />
<br />
After a few moments, I caught a scent that I recognized as Fred's. I didn't know how I knew it was his, but it was. I then began to carefully follow it.</p>
