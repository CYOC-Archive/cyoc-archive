<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Eric! Be sure to be back before supper!&quot; He heard his mother call.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will mom!&quot; Eric called back and closed the door. He was off to just do a little exploring. He ran a hand through his long, slightly shaggy blonde hair. Twelve years-old, blonde haired and blue eyed, but skinny and only a little tanned. He'd been trying to build himself up a little, but he wasn't having much luck. Too busy with the move. He looked down at his baggy cutoffs and white shirt. &quot;Ah well, maybe I'll ask my new neighbor. Maybe he'll be able to tell me where some things are.&quot; Eric mumbled to himself and walked up to the door of the house beside him. He raised a hand and knocked.<br />
<br />
Ty sat in his room, doing his homework when he heard the doorbell. Dustin was taking a nap, and Ty didn't want his stepbrother to wake up. &quot;I wish Dustin would continue sleeping as if he didn't hear anything...&quot; he wished out loud, and Dustin just continued to do so. Ty quietly walked over to the front door and opened up, and greeted the boy who stood before him. &quot;Well, hello!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, I'm Eric I just moved in next door. I was wondering, uhh, could you tell me where things are?&quot; he asked. &quot;Like, introduce me to the town as it were?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi... my name is Tyler... just call me Ty... I go to JFK High School down the street... you live next door?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Ty. Well I only just moved in yesterday.&quot; Eric said. &quot;Uhh, if we're gonna talk can I come in? I don't want to stand here, my legs are getting tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, come on in!&quot; Ty opened the door wide, and led Eric through the door into the living room. &quot;So, what are your interests? Any sports? Hobbies?&quot; He sat down on the couch in front of the TV, which was on low volume since Dustin was asleep. &quot;I like to watch TV and play video games, and I play basketball with Cousin Peter now and then. I'll work out in the gym from time to time. How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric sat down on an armchair and let his legs rest for a moment. &quot;Well, yeah I play video games, watch TV, go on the internet and play computer games. I don't play much sports.&quot; he said. &quot;I've tried, but I'm never very good. To scrawny I guess.&quot; He leaned back in the chair. &quot;I've tried working out at the gym, but it doesn't do much good. And I was always busy. Now we've moved I don't even know where the gym is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there's a gym just three blocks down the road from here, but their membership is kinda pricey... Is that something you long for? To become a little more buff?&quot; Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged. &quot;Yeah, I've always wanted to be a fair bit more muscular. I want to play sports. All my friends always wanted to, but I was stuck out of it.&quot; Eric said, lamenting a little. &quot;I don't know if I want to pay a lot for it either.&quot; Eric sighed and slouched. &quot;Oh I have no clue what to do. It's a goal for me, but I have no clue how to achieve it.&quot; He stood up a little abruptly. &quot;Can I use your washroom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... go right ahead!&quot; Ty said, pointing at the bathroom door.<br />
<br />
Ty watched as Eric got up and stumbled to the bathroom and closed the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Eric went into the washroom, and pulled of his shirt for a moment and gazed at his skinny body. With a sigh he pulled the shirt back on and went, well you know.<br />
<br />
Ty pondered what to do and decided to wait till Eric came out of the bathroom. In the meantime, a wide grin appeared on his face. &quot;So you want to become muscular, huh?&quot; he chuckled to himself.<br />
<br />
Eric washed and dried his hands and stepped out of the washroom. &quot;So Ty, um, you know anywhere else I could get buffed up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, just hold it right there, Eric...&quot; Ty ordered Eric, while Eric was walking towards him. &quot;You can get buffed up right here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um? I can? You have equipment downstairs or something?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eric... Why, if we change those clothes into a Speedo, you'll see that you're already one really buffed up teen, my friend...&quot; Ty chuckled, as he slowly got up and walked towards Eric, who was staring at him with a very confused look on his face<br />
<br />
Eric frowned, completely confused. &quot;I hate Speedos for one thing. Boxers and board shorts thank you very much. And second, what are you talking about. I'm scrawny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright... boxers, then... I wish you were only wearing boxers right now...&quot; Ty said out loud. Instantly, Eric's shirt, jeans and shoes disappeared, leaving him wearing just a pair of boxers while his chest was exposed while he was standing before Ty.<br />
<br />
Eric shook his head and looked down at himself. He was standing half-naked in front of a kid three years older than him. &quot;How'd you do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty just folded his arms while he stared at Eric with a smile on his face. &quot;Magic trick...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? Are you ashamed of your body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic? You mean you're like, a wizard or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that I can perform certain magic tricks.... I can make certain wishes come true.... now what was it you were saying about your body a few minutes ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm skinny and I want to be buff.&quot; Eric repeated mechanically. He had an idea what might be going on, and he wanted to let Ty finish before giving the 'That's so cool' praise.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see a scrawny, skinny kid at all... I see a kid with 60 pounds of muscle before me... a kid who loves to work out, who is generous and helpful towards everyone, especially those who are weaker, and a kid who always defends those who are being bullied by bigger kids....&quot; Ty said. Suddenly, Eric began to feel a warm, tingling feeling all over his body.<br />
<br />
Eric gasped as he felt a warm, tingling sensation all over his body. He felt like he was expanding or something. &quot;What's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Eric looked down, he noticed that his body was changing. His calves hardened and inflated to the size of softballs, forming into rocks of power in his lower legs. His quads thickened and widened with layers of additional muscle, covered by thick veins that provided blood. &quot;There, how do you like those legs so far?&quot; Ty asked him.<br />
<br />
Eric gasped as the changes took place. So much power in his legs. &quot;Wow! That's incredible! You can do upper body too right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it&quot; Ty chuckled. &quot;I love doing this as much as you love feeling your own muscles grow&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, then do it.&quot; Eric said with enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
Ty just stared at Eric's torso and grinned. Immediately, Eric's abs started to turn into a washboard of muscle, with rows and columns of mighty buttons popping up like tiles on the kitchen wall! He had a 6 pack of abdominal muscles! Next, his pectorals inflated like balloons which had air pumped into them, and they became like two spheres of rock solid power, forcing his arms and shoulders to spread apart further, with thicker and wider lats supporting them. His back was widened as well, along with thicker arms sporting big, round triceps, biceps, and python-looking arms rich with veins. He was truly transformed into a young muscle boy who had every reason to show off his guns in school! &quot;There, happy now?&quot; Ty laughed, as he watched Eric, who was examining his new body from head to toe. &quot;Like I said, you're not scrawny-looking now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric looked himself over and flexed his new muscles, taking a number of muscular poses. &quot;That's fu - freakin' cool!&quot; he exclaimed as he fled both biceps and watched the huge balls of muscle. He ran a hand over his abs and marveled at their hardness. And his back, he reached back and felt his back as solid as a rock. &quot;I don't think this is the right body for basketball. But who cares, I could do weight lifting or something.&quot; He took a few steps and could've sworn the ground shook a little. The boxers he was wearing were pretty much a Speedo now anyways. &quot;If you can do this so easily, how come you don't do it to yourself?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do it to myself all the time... I just shrink back so I can make myself grow again later.... It's just MORE FUN to grow others....&quot; Ty replied. &quot;If you like it, I can make it permanent... I can also make it where you're always growing bigger, very slowly.... as long as you stay actively involved in sports.... Is that a deal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged. &quot;Sure I guess. Deal. But take a request. Do this-&quot; he gestured to his massive muscles. &quot;To yourself. I wanna see you do some form changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you look magnificent!&quot; Ty chuckled, as he walked around Eric and studied his handiwork.... &quot;You're one of my best muscle-grown guys in a long time!&quot; Ty then stood before him. &quot;You want to go for a walk, with me? We can go out as two muscle dudes!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure why not. You can show me around town.&quot; Eric said. &quot;Oh you mentioned you have a cousin named Peter was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! My cousin is playing basketball&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, cool. Well let's take a walk as two muscle kids, and then play basketball. You can make us basketball players can't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! Would you want to be a basketball player now?&quot; Ty wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I wanna be a muscle kid.&quot; he said, flexing his massive muscles. &quot;Come on, grow yourself and let's go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alrighty!&quot; Ty giggled. He closed his eyes and concentrated. Suddenly, his legs thickened as his calves and quads inflated as well, followed by his abs and shoulders. Next, his arms grew wider while his pectorals stuck out a few inches further, giving him the look of a teen bodybuilder. Ty looked a little bigger, obviously, since he was a little older and a bit taller than Eric. Finally, he opened his eyes and stood right before Eric. &quot;How do I look?&quot; he asked, as he made a fist and flexed, showing off his guns. <br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; Eric said. &quot;Okay, let's go.&quot; he said and stood up. &quot;Oh wait, I can't go walking around town in a little Speedo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, have some cargo shorts...&quot; Ty snapped, and the Speedo changed into camouflage cargo shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay that works.&quot; Eric said. &quot;Do we need shirts?&quot; he asked. &quot;Oh and shouldn't you tell Dustin you're going out?&quot; He stopped suddenly. How did he know that? Ty had a stepbrother named Dustin. He shook his head to clear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know I had a brother named Dustin?&quot; he asked Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I'm not sure...&quot; Eric said, trailing off into thought. &quot;Well I've always had a bit of a precognitive sense. No big deal is it? Once I predicted what our homework was gonna be before the teacher put it on the board.&quot; he explained. &quot;Heh, it's funny because I wished for him not to give us as much and he suddenly seemed to decide to give us less. Said we only had to do 1 to 3 instead of 1 to 6.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds cool!&quot; Ty said, as he opened the door. The two muscle dudes then walked out and left to go to the park where they would meet cousin peter and Allen...<br />
<br />
Ty had left a note for Dustin, telling him where they went…</p>
