<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Um mom grandmas here,” Gloria called anxiously. Lisa and Ann anxiously looked at their sister, for now it would be best to not surprise their mother with the return of her eldest daughter. “Quick,” Lisa said quickly. “Go hangout in Jason’s study. Let me prep mom before you reveal yourself otherwise it could get ugly.” Kellie nodded, her mother wasn’t a big fan of surprises and learning her daughter was back from the dead and that she hadn’t been told until now could lead to an ugly argument. Rushing into the study and closing the door Kellie now waited for her sisters to reintroduce her to her mother.<br />
<br />
Lisa took a deep breath to calm herself as she heard her mother ring the door bell. Looking back at the others she frowned as she saw how nervous her sister Ann was. “Geez Ann will you relax,” she hissed. “Your going to chew your damn nails off at this rate.”<br />
<br />
“Well what do you expect,” Ann replied frowning. “We’ve known about Kellie for what, a week? Maybe two? And we haven’t told mom, you know damn well she’s going to freak out.”<br />
<br />
“Just be cool,” Lisa sighed. “All of you.” Ann and the others all nodded as Lisa opened the door to greet her mother. “Hi mom,” she smiled. “Thanks for coming.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn frowned as she adjusted her glasses. “Lisa,” she said flatly. “I’m happy to see you but ai need to talk with you and Katie now.”<br />
<br />
Lisa paled slightly as the elderly woman now entered the house. Looking at the others she could sense everyone’s apprehension at her arrival. “They already have an idea I’m not happy,” she thought as she looked at everyone’s nervous faces. “And for good reason.” Turning she now looked at the nervous expression on Lisa’s face before looking back at Ann.<br />
<br />
“Lisa, Ann,” she said slowly. “We have a lot to talk about. But first I need Katie and her fiancé over here now so I can talk with them. Also Ann stop biting your nails, it’s a bad habit.” Lisa nodded as she went to retrieve her adopted daughter while Ann sheepishly placed her hands behind her back, quietly apologizing. As Lisa approached with Katie and baby Morgan, Marilyn narrowed her eyes. “So,” she said quietly. “This is my great granddaughter.”<br />
<br />
“Yes grandma,” Katie said quietly. “Kellie and I adopted her. She had nowhere else to go and...well, Their was something about her that just kind of, drew me to her.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn nodded as she looked the tiny infant over. Morgan looked up at the woman, her crystal blue eyes focusing on the woman with a look of astonishment plastered on her infantile face. “Well Katie,” she smirked. “She is a beautiful child. However, your still quite young and you and Kellie aren’t even married yet. Don’t you think trying to care for a newborn may be a bit much? Especially if your still trying to graduate from college.”<br />
<br />
“I know it will be hard grandma,” Katie said. “But Kellie and I are quite sure we want to do this. We can offer her the best life possible. Mom helped with the adoption process but we are doing everything else. She’s already seen a pediatrician and we care for her greatly.”<br />
<br />
“I understand,” Marilyn said. “And I’m not mad that you decided to care for this child. Your very much like your mother Katie, once your mind is made up it won’t be changed, that and I’ve akways known you to be quite empathic towards the plight of others. At my age I’ve learned trying to argue with any O’Toole woman is a fruitless effort. I know you will make a wonderful mother.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks grandma,” Katie said warmly, shocked that her grandmother would so quickly accept her decision. Marilyn smiled warmly, hugging her granddaughter tightly and stroking the babies hair lovingly. Sighing she turned towards Lisa, noticing the astonished look on her daughters face. “Lisa,” she said. “I’m not mad at Katie. It was made quite clear to me years ago that I am to have very little influence on her upbringing. You however Iam quite upset with.”<br />
<br />
“Me,” Lisa exclaimed. “What did I do?”<br />
<br />
“Lisa you said years ago that Katie was yours to raise,” she said. “You should look out for her well being. You know quite well how difficult it was raising a child at that age. Did you try talking your daughter out of this decision.”<br />
<br />
“No,” Lisa said slowly. “But it was out of my hands. Katie made the decision.”<br />
<br />
“And as her mother you should of told her how difficult of a decision that would be,” Marilyn exclaimed. “I mean Lisa you know how important this time in a girls life is. How could you let her make this type of a decision, you need to be more responsible.”<br />
<br />
Lisa now gaped at her mother, she had not expected her to be this angry at Katie adopting a child. “Hold on a sec,” she said. “This was Katie’s choice, she’s a grown woman. I’ve always believed she knows what’s best.” Marilyn could only shake her head as she looked at Lisa. “Is that so,” Marilyn sighed. “Tell me Lisa, how were your grades after you adopted Katie? I know how they were, they dropped and you lost your scholarship. Your father and I tried to help and you refused. We all took out student loans to help pay for your schooling. Tell me Lisa, are you taking loans out for Katie if that happens? Will you end up raisng not only your daughter, but your granddaughter as well?”<br />
<br />
“Mom maybe you should relax,” Ann said nervously. Marilyn glared at her middle daughter, causing Ann to go quiet once more. “Ann this not your concern,” she said sternly. “And come to think of it when Katie was growing up how much effort did you put in to try and help your sister and niece? You were so concerned with your own career that you ignored your little sister.”<br />
<br />
Kellie listened from the study as her mother now ripped into her sisters about not only the adoption of Morgan, but the mistakes they had made throughout Katie’s childhood. “Ugh mom hasn’t changed,” she groaned. “She still thinks she knows better than anyone else. Well enough of this.” Grabbing the doorknob Kellie threw the study door over, glaring angrily at her mother. “Okay that’s enough leave Lisa and Ann alone.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn gazed curiously at the grown woman who was now looking at her. “Lisa, Ann,” she said slowly. “Who is that? She looks like Katie’s fiancé? But that’s impossible, Kellie is over there.”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Lisa said, her face flushing. “I can explain, but um...it’s complicated. Try not to freak out or get mad Okay?”<br />
<br />
“Lisa why would I get mad,” Marilyn asked curiously. “I’m not mad right now despite the fact you and your sister both think I am. I’m worried about Katie, having a baby is a huge responsibility and no one here seems to think that. I’m more frustrated than anything, Katie is far too young for no one to tell her that having an infant could greatly complicate her life.”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Kellie sighed in annoyance. “Will you stop please. Katie is more than capable and taking care of a baby and the reason Lisa and Ann look so scared is because that’s what you do, you scare people. Everyone that is except me.”<br />
<br />
“Who are you,” Marilyn exclaimed, still confused. “You look familiar, and why are you calling me mom? I don’t know who you even are.”<br />
<br />
Kellie sighed as she looked at her sisters. Ann and Lisa both looked petrified at Kellies actions. Neither one wanted Kellies introduction to go like this and knowing Kellie from when she was alive the first time, any fight with their mother was always a clash of wills. “Mom,” she said sadly. “This is going to be really hard to understand but it’s me, Kellie.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn looked apdumbstrucknas she looked Kellie over critically. “No,” she said quickly. “No that’s impossible and a cruel joke. Kellie has been dead for almost 21 years. You can’t possibly be her.” Turning towards her daughters a look of pain and sadness crossed her face as her eyes began to dampen. “Is this your idea of a cruel joke,” she cried, her eyes beginning to dampen with tears. “Do you two hate me so much that you would have someone pretend to be Kellie?”<br />
<br />
“Mom no it’s no joke,” Kellie said sadly. “Mom it really is me. Look at my face. Tell me you don’t remember what my face looks like.” Marilyn wiped her yes as she slowly approached her eldest daughter. Looking the woman over her eyes bulged as she recognized her daughter. “Kellie,” she whispered. “No, that’s impossible. You died in childbirth, how? How could you be alive?”<br />
<br />
“Mom,” Lisa said quietly. “I’m sorry we didn’t tell you. We just found out ourselves. That is Kellie, our sister. It’s a long complicated story. The short version, she was reborn in another timeline. She’s around because of magic.”<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you tell me when you found out,” Marilyn whispered. “Do you have any idea how devastated I was when she passed, especially after the fight we had.”<br />
<br />
“Mom we barely believed it ourselves,” Ann said. “We decided it would be best to tell you at the babyshower.”<br />
<br />
Marilyn nodded sadly as she looked the adult Kellie over, running a hand across her cheek softly. “How long have you known,” she asked. “A couple of weeks. Right after Katie adopted Morgan,” Lisa said quietly. Marilyn’s eyes bulge as she now whipped her head around to face her daughters. “So you decided to tell me your daughter adopted a child but failed to tell me my daughter was alive,” she exclaimed. “Why on Earth would you keep that a secret!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know mom,” Lisa whined. “I guess I was scared.”<br />
<br />
“Bulls hit,” Marilyn snorted. “Scared is a word that isn’t in your vocabulary Lisa. Your the most courageous woman I’ve met. No, it was something else. You liked knowing this secret, just like you liked knowing your daughters had magic powers.”<br />
<br />
Lisa shifted nervously, as she thought about it perhaps that was the reason. She liked knowing things her mother didn’t, part of her was still the rebellious teen that butted heads with her parents. She had liked knowing more things than her family and her stubbornness and pride had driven an unnecessary wedge between herself and her family. “Ugh I’m an idiot,” Lisa groaned. “God mom, I’m sorry I should of told you.”<br />
<br />
“Yes you should of,” Marilyn grumbled. “Now I want to speak with everyone that is a part of family right this instant. No more lies, no more secrets, no more b.s.”<br />
<br />
Gloria and Katie had watched the exchange take place between their grandmother and mothers nervously. Marilyn was an intimidating presence and discovering her long dead daughter was alive (and that the knowledge she was alive was not exactly new) now had led to an uncomfortable situation. “This is about to get ugly huh,” Gloria whispered to her sister. Katie nodded turning towards her little sister before gasping in shock. “Gloria your ring!”<br />
<br />
Gloria’s eyes went wide as she saw the Ring of Age begin to glow. As she went to inform everyone what was happening she saw Adult Kellie and Teen Katie gasp as well. “Why are our rings glowing,” they are exclaimed in surprise. Nervously the O’Toole and Turner girls now looked at everyone, realizing that in only moments people’s ages were going to change.</p>
