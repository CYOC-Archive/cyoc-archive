<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Round two of the sex lottery soon began after a short break with renewed vigor. After putting the slips of papers back into the hat; Edward mixed the names up and decided to be the first to pull a name. Reading the slip from his vulpine hand-paws, Edward smiled as he looked a Atoli Clawfoot.<br />
“Hope you like knots,” the anthro fox fury smiling; “you’re about to be tied to one.” Edward pointing to his pulsing phallus with a noticeable bulge at the base; seeing the bald eagle fury gulp only pushed the lustful fox fury as he approached the female. “I know you are going to enjoy this,” Edward already guiding Atoli to the ground so he can mount her. He pauses to look at her puckered entrance peeking out of her plumage and smiles as he guides his shaft to its destination.<br />
<br />
“I’ll pull next,” Denise glancing at the rutting fox eagle combo and smirking as the eagle fury already has her avian tongue lolling out of her open beak; the gasp clearly audible as she was just knotted. Turning back to the hat, she grabs a name and stares at Lucas Soulfang; she was about to get filled by an anthro wolf fury. Lucas licked his lips as he pounced with a playful growl and started wrestling the amorous female; he pouted slightly as he lost the battle and was lying on the ground. He was being straddled by the anthro tigress and rumbling in satisfaction as his lupine rod got buried in her swollen snatch. She begins to gyrate as Lucas starts bucking; enjoying the view of her fury breasts bouncing about.<br />
<br />
“Would you like to go next Bob,” Julian staring at the anthro grizzly as he watches his mate being furiously fucked into oblivion.<br />
“Oh, I’ll;” Bob straining to pull himself from the spectacle as he stammers for the right words. “I’ll wait.”<br />
“Then I’ll pull,” Julian stepping up to the hat and pulling out a name; she smiles as she stares at Bob who still can’t tear away from the spectacle before him. His attention was finally diverted when he felt paws exploring his body; his fur being mussed up as the paws travel up and down his chiseled torso. Turning around he is surprised to see Julian Heartpaw exploring him; the anthro cougar smiling as she shows his the slip of paper with his name written on it.<br />
“Choice has been made,” Julian purring;  a feature most large felines don’t have, however mountain lions/cougars have that feature.<br />
<br />
“I guess we get to console ourselves with each other,” Michael approaching Rachael Soulfang from behind; cupping her tawny furred breasts with his hoof hands, he gently squeezes them as he watches Julian go down and Bob climb on her and starts thrusting in her missionary style.<br />
“Pin me to the wall,” Racheal turning around to stare at the imposing anthro stag-deer before her; her leonine tail thrashing in anticipation.<br />
“And I thought my mate was a naughty kitty,” Michael grinning as he stalks the lioness to the nearest wall; pressing her up on it, his cervine member pressing on her belly as he gives Rachael a passionate kiss. Pulling back slightly, he maneuvers his rod to the lioness’s entrance; watching her moan as it slides in and being pull closer as she wraps her legs around his waist. He places his hoof hands on her rear end as he begins to thrust in and out of her; his hips movement short and forceful as Rachael’s legs are keeping him close to her. Leaning in to give playful kisses on her neck he blows his hot breath on her as he starts to spasm as his balls clench and he feels the telltale sensation of cumming.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes,” Rachael screaming as her vaginal muscles clamp and start milking the shaft buried within her. The hot seed cooling her loins as she feels it flows within her womb; her eyes rolling as sparks dance within her periphery. “I want every drop you randy stag,” Rachael panting as she looks into her sexual partner’s eyes; gently grasping his fury sack and feeling it pulse within her paws.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
Soon after a spent Bob Clawfoot pulled out and climbed off of Julian Heartpaw; the anthro grizzly bear fury gasping as Julian did things with her muscles to extend the act of lust, bringing him to just before his peak, then keeping him there for as long as possible. The trick extended the rut for a few extra minutes; long enough for him to glance as Edward grips Atoli into a mating press as he pants while Atoli moans, his climax soon followed as he felt his balls clench and seed shooting forth.<br />
“Ooooh fuck,” Bob grunting as he instinctively pressed down on Julian just as he hears her moans of climax.<br />
<br />
“Oh Lucas,” Denise shouting as he body is wracked with her orgasm; her body shuddering as the lupine rod locked within starts spraying her hungry womb; the knot locking the two together and ensuring his essence doesn’t leak out of her.<br />
“Happy to satisfy,” the anthro wolf fury chuckling as he feels his climax ebbing; guiding Denise to her side so the two could spoon while they wait for his knot to deflate.<br />
“I don’t think I could last past round three,” the anthro tigress panting; watching as Michael helps Rachael to her paws after using a wall to rut her senseless. “Looks like Rachael has been ridden hard,” Denise chuckling as the lioness fury slowly collapses to the ground as her legs were too shaky from her post orgasmic release.<br />
“I just need a minute,” Rachael panting; “and I’ll be ready for another go.<br />
<br />
“Atoli are you alright,” Bob weakly crawling towards his bald eagle fury mate as her eyes flutter from Edward’s release; the feel of his shaft twitching putting her over the edge as her body reacts with its own orgasm.<br />
“I’m fine,” Atoli responding with a contented sight; “just winded from this wild romp of ours.”<br />
“We don’t hold this often,” Edward chiming in; his vulpine hand paws gently caressing Atoli’s feathery belly; “in fact this is only the second time we convened this lottery.”<br />
“Has it been six years since the last one,” Michael walking towards the bar to grab a bottle of water; remembering when his twin sons became mated with Alison and Brittany, mother’s to his grand cubs. “We need to get together more,” Michael sipping from the bottle; “assuming none of us are planning to expand the family.”<br />
<br />
“No guarantee there,” Bob sitting up; using the pool table as a makeshift support; “Atoli and I have been mulling on another cub. Sora is older and doesn’t need to be watched over as closely,” Bob speaking; “plus it will be a while before my brother comes back from deployment.”<br />
“He is not overseas,” Atoli chiming in; “Unless of course Louisiana became an island thank to the category four hurricane last year. He is just helping to rebuild and re-enforce the levees,” Atoli wincing as her attempt to pull away from Edward’s knot failed.<br />
“Still not ready yet,” Edward chuckling as he can feel his knot still in the avian cootch; “surely your brother is available by phone, Bob.”<br />
“Yeah,” Bob nodding; “but the time zone differences make a phone call tricky. It’s a three hour time difference between the east and west coasts,” Bob thinking as he works the math for eastern and pacific time.<br />
 “Don’t let the stop you from trying,” Denise being no stranger to calls that cross different time zones; the tigress fury has had many calls from the president of the United States at six in the morning when it was nine am eastern time. Being the head of the CDC who refuses to relocate to Atlanta Georgia did come with some headaches. “Give him a call tomorrow,” Denise speaking; “even if you are forced to leave a message, at least you tried.”<br />
<br />
“It looks like Lucas and I,” Edward changing the subject; “are going to be tied up for a few more minutes. Sorry Atoli,” Edward giving the bald eagle fury a light pat on her belly; “canine knots can be stubborn when deflating.”<br />
“It surely is a novel feeling,” Atoli wincing as she felt another attempt to separate her from the fox fury behind her fail. “Pity there is no male feline fury here,” Atoli scanning the room; “kind of wanting to feel one of those pricks rubbing my folds.”<br />
“Lucas and I know a couple;” Rachael finally getting up after being railed by Michael; “a squirrel fury and her mate, a spotted leopard fury.”<br />
“Trudy and Lucas Whitefur,” Lucas smiling; “but isn’t Trudy expecting? We can’t exactly invite them over right now.”<br />
“There is always next time,” Edward thinking about expanding his sex lottery; “at least the time we do this.”</p>
