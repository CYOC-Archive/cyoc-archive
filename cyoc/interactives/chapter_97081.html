<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning and Roger awoke with plans to be rid of his horny donkey wife and those two rank-horny sons changed into stud-jack donkeys.<br />
<br />
A new day and Rodger felt free of his troubles, but happiest about becoming a bachelor again, his wife wishing for bigger cocks to tickle her jennet donkey behind. Although he and his wife were married for some twenty years, and having birthed two sons, Rodger was free to do as he saw fit, or so he thought about then!<br />
<br />
 After having a hearty breakfast at the Corner Garage Café, Rodger returned to his farm to begin the first of his daily chores. As with any farm there is the usual tending to barn animals, included in the work was three new donkeys he would soon be rid of, and glad of it to boot.<br />
<br />
 As Roger entered the barn he was met by Marge standing in a heightened alert state, her tail held high as of to the right side of her smooth round furred rump.<br />
Elroy, her son was there standing behind his mother turned jennet donkey, his muzzle quite close to her rump, he sniffing of her spicy scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elroy, you get back to your stall,&quot; Roger yelled, his loud as terse voice was enough to warn away the young stud from thinking about deflowering his changed mother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Marge, put your tail down or some dare horny stud will ram his fencepost of a cock up inside you, rutting you until you are cross-eyed.&quot; Roger said, as all in the barn heard him, Elroy, Brian, and two stable-hands, one of which was me.<br />
<br />
Brian like his brother was of equal size and male maturity, the blue powder always created a champion animal. Both donkey brothers stood aside the other, they sniffing the breeze, were flagging each their donkey cock, filled with equine lusts, stood in all jackass glory. <br />
<br />
Roger took a hold to Marge by her halter and led her back to a box stall where he expected she would remain safe from any equine male molesting her before Stephen would arrive with the livestock truck.<br />
<br />
He was about to walk away from where he left Marge to her nervous estrus troubles, to see there looking at him, was Brian, his donkified son showing off a goofy smile, as if he were thinking similar thoughts as was his brother about their mother.<br />
<br />
 A shrill braying cry came from Marge as she had a mind induced orgasm.  All there heard her snuffling sounds of a Jenny Donkey in heat, wanting and wishing for some stud to quell her pent up passions. <br />
<br />
Just about then all there heard the sounds of a large truck coming to a stop there in the barn driveway.<br />
<br />
Roger ran to give his greeting to Stephen, he being the nephew and aid to Madame Illusia, she a perverse sort of woman magician having her own show at Pleasure Island Amusement Park. He was willing to give away his whole family, wife and offspring, they changed to being donkey animals, his reasoning had some merit, but to me if they were mine, I would have kept them, especially considering what troubles Roger got from selling his family.<br />
<br />
Stephen looked to be a odd sort, rather frail of form, and he walked like a sassy woman swaying his behind. Roger took note and while he was showing his donkey wife and jackass sons, he asked Stephen about why he walked as with an attitude. Roger was quite surprised to learn that Stephen was from birth as Stephanie, transformed of gender by her/his magical Auntie Illusia. He told some of when his auntie decided her niece would be better for the act if she became a male, and since then he had had several fun times of sensual enjoyments with aroused as horny animalized female transformed volunteers.<br />
<br />
The two men... characters went then to view as meet the three transformed people being donkeys. Brian acted as if he were a prime herd stud and masturbated his big cock for the viewing of Stephen as he knelt and stroked the massive male organ.<br />
<br />
Elroy was less the animal and act like he felt humiliation for having to stand there being checked over like the animal he was!<br />
<br />
Stephen went to check then Marge, and she being in an aroused state, wrangling, did back her visitor into a stall corner as she urinated all over the shirt and front of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger,&quot; yelled Stephen, &quot;Come in here, we have a slight problem!&quot;<br />
<br />
Roger went to the box stall, and there with Marge stood a urine soaked Stephen, and he then pointing to there in a corner of the stall stood a still aroused, as nervously horny a stud Welsh pony stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe your donkey wife got herself bred this morning,&quot; Stephen said with an angry tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
Roger stood there as a man stunned by the facts, as he wondered from where came the Welsh pony, it was not his, nor was it boarded there at the farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Auntie, Madame Illusia is expecting the arrival of three donkeys, two as studs, and one pure jennet. Your silly jennet wife has got herself bred and might be pregnant. Do you know what will happen if I accept her, and she with her sons become wards of my Auntie? If Marge is pregnant, Auntie will expect of you to make good your deal, and from knowing her, she will transform you into being the replacement jennet donkey for your soiled wife.<br />
<br />
Just maybe the thought of becoming female and equine delights your fantasies, it can after some time being different of gender to what you were born, but a donkey jennet gets rough sex from her suitors!<br />
<br />
If I accept just the two jackass brothers and tell Auntie you will replace the soiled jennet, you need to find a virgin and give her some blue powder to ingest and transform, or you will by the magic of Auntie drink down the powder and feel the need of getting your vulva filled, and filled full. Either way, it does not bother me to force you to replace Marge, it seems a righteous about turn of fate for her and you.&quot; Stephen said, and scared Roger, as he seeing me standing close enough to see and overhear the conversing, he smiled at me as if my being there sparked in him an idea.</p>
