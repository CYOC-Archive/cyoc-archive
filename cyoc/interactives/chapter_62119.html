<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">…Shifting to Brian’s perspective… I don’t understand this world anymore, wrong is right and right is wrong, heroes lose and villains win.  I came to school today with lifted spirits, confident I would win over the girl of my dreams but she stabbed me through the heart.  It wasn’t my looks, it was me; I was too nice, too clean.  I asked why she wouldn’t want someone like me, asked what I could do to make her like me and she just laughed coldly at me before walking away, making sure to step on every broken piece of my dreams.<br />
<br />
After Sam shot me down I went into the bathrooms to try to relieve some stress.  As I sat in the stalls, pondering my life I wished for the first time that I wasn’t such a push over.  I wished I could be the kind of person who was ruthless and calloused enough to get what they want even if it meant reaching through fire.  But I knew these fickle fantasies were just from my heartbreak, I couldn’t really be that kind of person, I hated people like that.  <br />
<br />
I heard someone else enter the bathroom and froze, not making a sound; not thinking and barely breathing.  I heard a soft clatter and a choker slid under the stall door and stopped right in front of me and then I heard the door open and close.  He was gone, whoever he was.  I hesitantly picked up the necklace, it looked innocent enough but it was hot to the touch and there was something wrong about it.  Just holding it, I felt a strange aggression trying to push its way into my mind as if the necklace radiated selfish greed and lust.  The heat and assault strengthened.  I could almost hear the necklace screaming at me to put it on.  The thing burned with fury, terrifying me.  Without warning it started squirming in my hands, letting out an earsplitting squealing sound.  It twisted and convulsed in sinister throes, trying to free itself from my grasp, the ends whipping at my hands dangerously.  Each time they made contact I felt the burning sting and shuddered in pain.  I dropped it out of fear and shock but it flew, like an arrow darting right for my neck with a blazing blue aura.  I quickly caught it with both hands and threw it into the toilet, flushing repeatedly until I was sure it was in the sewers, panting at my narrow escape.  I could’ve sworn I heard it groan in a deep, demonic voice as it spiraled out of sight.  <br />
<br />
I left the stall, zombie like from the encounter and stood in front of the mirror, splashing water on my face.  I must be losing my mind, I thought.  Before I could react the necklace seemed to reappear behind me and latched itself around my neck with a steel grip.  My eyes grew wide, seeing my horrified face in the mirror with the still glowing necklace around my neck.  I groaned in agony as I felt it pumping me with energy, as if being shocked endlessly; the sheer voltage bringing me to my knees.  The jeans I had been wearing this morning began, changing somehow.  I tried to scream but nothing came out as I watched my jeans slowly losing color, becoming first a light blue before paling to white.  The ends unraveled slowly into nothing as the boxers beneath disappeared.  Most of the pockets sealed themselves up along with the zipper as two white strings fell out the front and the waistband became elastic.  The jeans became shorter and shorter until they came just below my knees, the material changing and becoming softer and lighter, billowing out in an unfelt wind.  Blue spots began to appear like spilt ink, they blossomed out before becoming floral patterns.  Bewildered I pulled at the new swim trunks but they were almost super glued to me; not budging an inch.  Next my shoes tore themselves to ribbons, literally, the pieces floating around my feet as my socks just disintegrated before the pieces wrapped closer, solidifying into a pair of sandals.  I felt the necklace ordering me to stand back up and was helpless to disobey as it turned me to face the mirror.  My simple but nice tee shirt began to shift, the designs fading into oblivion as it became white and changed materials; a collar appearing out of no where on the new polo and several buttons forming in the front.  Bursts of color soon appeared and dyed the shirt blue.  I was left there frozen and forced to watch my attire change in the mirror.  I could almost hear laughing inside my head.<br />
<br />
A disquieting smile, full of cockiness and desire crossed my face, a smile that wasn’t mine but that I couldn’t shake.  I watched my face begin to change, my skin darkening; far beyond the tan I already had to that of someone who spends every sunny day at the beach.  I grabbed my head as the necklace whispered to my brain, telling me to leave it all behind, to turn my intelligence into something used only for getting g… getting pussy.  I clasped my head in my hands as the necklace continued to speak to me.  Women are toys, you’re a hot stud, you go through one after another, all you want is to have sex and surf.  My fingers dug into my head more as they grew long and nimble, my hands becoming freakishly large and strong.  They began to move on their own as I pleaded, to save my modesty, my intelligence and my innocence.  That smirk crossed my face again as my hands slowly undid the top button.  I heard the necklace whisper in my ear; that’s one.  I bent over in pain as my shoulders expanded, popping out the polo; my pecs growing and pushing into the front.  The front of the polo was strained to the limit by my sehelf like pecs.  They bulged out, impressively but I could feel my brain shrinking as everything else grew.  My hands undid the second button; two.  I could see the seductive, golden brown skin now, trying to resist my own swelling ego but my hands stroked my chest as it darkened further but not from the necklace’s control.  Each brush of my hand was ecstasy, sending a panorama of visions through my head of surfing and fucking.  The third button popped open by itself as my pecs finished growing out, so tight was the polo my now large nipples could be plainly seen; erect from the pleasure of the change.  Three, the voice whispered, laughing as my abs were pummeled by an unseen force that ground them into a hard 6 pack.  My hands pulled up my shirt allowing me to see the sculpted chest and dark treasure trail that extended to my naval.  <br />
<br />
My sleeves began to fill to the brim with my massive, dark arms.  The slight blond fuzz on them began to change.  More hair began to grow, the hairs getting longer and darker until my ripped arms were accented by countless brown hairs.  I grabbed the sink in fear and anger, trying to push out the thoughts and energy but feeling myself pushed out and pushed away from the sink as my arms grew wider still and longer.  From my back I could hear disturbing cracking and grinding noises as my spine elongated, causing my height to shoot up.  The muscles in my back also grew, big and firm.  <br />
<br />
My arms complete their growth as the voice begs me to show off, to enjoy myself.  I can’t stop myself from flexing, smirking at my… sexy arms.  “This isn’t right, what’s happening… I’m gettin’ fucking sexy!”  I clasp my hands to my mouth, mid-sentence my voice dropped becoming deep and sexy but unfamiliar.  My Adam’s apple pushes out as my neck thickens and I come to realize, that’s my voice now.  I double over as I feel… that changing.  Finally able to move my board shorts but just enough to watch the change.  I watch in awe as it grows inch by inch from an already decent size, becoming painfully hard until I can do nothing but moan.  “Dude my dick is a monster!”  Unable to control what I’m saying and equally helpless as my body forces me to keep adjusting the very noticeable bulge in my boardies.  The necklace loads me up with more images and compulsions, tearing away at my sensitive exterior, filling me with aggression and need but also a calm and cocky exterior to mask the burning arrogance and lust.  I feel it shattering my mind in a million places and putting the pieces back together in new ways, constructing this… thing that lives for sex.  <br />
<br />
I tried to escape, to run away from the life being thrust upon me but each step was more unstable until I crashed into the ground, groaning as I realized my feet and legs were growing.  My toes all lengthened as they grew several shades darker, the sandals growing to accommodate my feet as they expanded, lengthening to a size 15.  My legs explode with muscle while dark hairs erupt from them, coating my now bulging calves and thighs.  The necklace pulled me to my feet and unleashed all it had left into me, I screamed in pleasure and anguish as the new persona took control.  Watching in fading horror as my face succumbed to the changes; an arrogant smirk appearing, licking my lips as they became full and inviting.  My eyes became a mischievous emerald as my eyebrows thickened and stubble grew along my now square jaw; my hair growing out becoming dark and wavy.  All together a sexy package I thought.  “I’m fucking hot dude!”  I vaguely recalled there being something special about the necklace I was wearing, I don’t know when I got it it’s been there like forever and as I held it, it seemed like just a normal necklace.  I knew it was important though for some reason.  I tried to remember a life before but only came up with blissful memories of fucking, surfing and partying.  I thought about once caring for women, in a deep way and laughed a rich and deep chuckle.  I lusted for women, nothing more.  They belonged to me.  That reminded me, of something I needed to take care of…<br />
<br />
Flip flops slapping my feet I made my way to Samantha, confidence dripping from every pore in my body.  Eyes that once stared into her, stared right through her and she was obviously turned on.  With just a few words I had her, leading her into an abandoned classroom I could see the need in her eyes, begging for me.  With both hands I held her against the wall and invaded her mouth with my tongue as wiggled in pleasure.  Something came over her and she became more aggressive, more into it.  Her eyes dimmed, showing nothing but lust and adoration.  As I moved my hands towards her chest I felt her breasts swell and push out, already large for her age they became plump and bouncy, driving me wild.  It was all the more noticeable as the shirt she was wearing became smaller, pulling up to reveal her belly button and tightening on her.  Her skirt became a pair of torn shorts, revealing legs even sexier than I remembered.  Every curve was more apparent, more luscious, her face was perfection.  Her tangles of blond hair shortened to shoulder length and a beautiful tan covered her entire body.  What had once been a cute girl was now a surfing goddess around my age of 18.  “Please” she begged “do me now.”  Her voice was that of desire itself but I kept my calm and just gave her my trademark grin.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be over tonight babe, don’t make plans.  Right now, gotta go hang with my bros Ty and Matt.”  I left her there in the classroom, gasping for air.  I finally had the girl of my dreams, until tomorrow morning, then it’s on to the next bitch.</p>
