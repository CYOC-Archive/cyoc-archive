<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hey there. My name is Alex. I&#39;m a guy you see. That may be odd to hear someone say like its hard to believe, but... well you see, I&#39;m not quite who I used to be. My &quot;girlfriend&quot; too. But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself aren&#39;t I? It all started a week ago. Me and my girlfriend... Her name is Jesse by the way... Well me and my girlfriend... We&#39;re 19 years old too... Sorry. It sounds like I&#39;m stalling here... And I am. This is just... A LOT! Anyway, we were having sex like any normal couple. The walls between rooms are soundproof, so its easy to do this without disturbing anyone. My dick, hard at 10 inches, was slowly going in and out of Jesse&#39;s pussy. She has said I am quite good at sex. I make her feel more comfortable then anyone before. But things were starting to get weird. It felt like I needed to thrust harder to get in all the way. I thought nothing off it at first. I fondled her breasts to distract me. But as I did, I had trouble holding on. Like here breasts were smaller than before. Or my hands weren&#39;t as firm enough. Feeling disoriented I stopped. As I expected, she asked me what was wrong. I asked what her breast size was. A stupid question. She thought so herself, but maybe she thought this was my new turn on, so she told me she was a good D. I repeated back what she said. She giggled in return and told me to continue. I was about to when she said &quot;Good. Just like that. Ah!&quot; &quot;Just like what?&quot; I replied. Calling me silly, she told me she felt my dick moving in again. Unable to understand what she was talking about, I focused on her backside and that&#39;s when I noticed. I yelled and pulled out right away. Clearly annoyed, she asked what was wrong. And I told her. Her hair was receding into her skull, the color going from a light blond to a dark brown. Confused she turned around, asking what I was going on about, but yelled herself, scrambling back in the bed. Asking her what was wrong myself, she told me to look at my chest. I looked down and yelled once more. I had a nice coating of hair over my pectoral muscles, but looking down, my chest was smooth. And that wasn&#39;t all. My pecs weren&#39;t square anymore. They were almost round and slightly protruding from my body. Slowly, but surely, they continued to move out. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; was about all I could say. &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot; Jesse asked as she looked up and down my body, but I couldn&#39;t answer. I just looked at her in horror. Her breasts were definitely not D Cups anymore. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, shit, shit!&quot; I jumped up immediately and off the bed. &quot;Alex?&quot; Jesse asked, a palpable fear in her voice. I walked towards the door to make sure it was locked. As I moved, my eye level to the door was falling down. Shit was about all I could say. Meanwhile Jesse squirmed in her bed. She felt like her legs were about to fall off as she grew bigger. As I checked the door to lock it I looked down at my hands. They were changing. The hair on my knuckles receded into my skin and my fingers became much smoother and smaller. My nails grew beyond what it was capable off. &quot;Alex! Alex!&quot; After making sure it was locked, I turned around to my girlfriend. She looked like a mess. She was huge and a little bit hairy. And her breasts were a B at best. &quot;Jesse!&quot; I walked up to her and grabbed onto her hands. I could feel the weight on them shifting. They were as big as mine once were. &quot;Alex! What&#39;s happening to us?!&quot; I&#39;m scared!&quot; I tried to console her. &quot;It&#39;s okay Jesse! It&#39;s... OkkkkaaAAAYYYY!&quot; Then it happened. &quot;Alex!&quot; &quot;JesSSeeee! JesseeeEEEEE!&quot; I tried to talk normally, but my voice was getting higher. &quot;Alex! Alex! Your voice! Your voiCCCCeee! Ah! Oh my god! Oh my GoooOOOddddd!&quot; As if to confirm our predicament, Jesse&#39;s voice was getting lower in pitch. And it was then that I realized what was happening. In my new high voice, I told her. &quot;Jesse! I think we&#39;re switching bodies!&quot; &quot;Switching bodies?! But that&#39;s...&quot; I knew she wanted to say it was impossible, but her new voice confirmed our new reality. It was that of a man alright. But not just any man. It was definitely me. And I definitely had her voice now. &quot;No. No,no,no,no,no! I don&#39;t want to be a man! Do something Alex! Please!&quot; Tears formed in her eyes as I went to hug her, not caring that my developing breasts were reminding me of the cold hard truth. I kissed her for a moment then we moved back. Jesse was clearly taller then me now. Her breasts were nonexistent and were spreading out in her chest into pectoral muscles. &quot;Damn! Never knew I was such a giant!&quot; I joked. Jesse giggled a bit. She looked a lot like me now. Her body was filing with muscles as she watched me lose mine. &quot;And I never knew I was such a string bean!&quot; she retorted. <br />
<br />
She looked downwards. &quot;Oh god! Your dick!&quot; I looked myself. &quot;Oh boy!&quot; Was about all I could muster. My dick was still erect, but it was only three inches at most. &quot;I look like a little kid!&quot; My dick continued to slink back into my body. My balls, no longer hairy either, were the first to go. They sucked back into my body with a thwump. &quot;Oof! Fucking hell!&quot; I held onto my groin area. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jesse asked. &quot;God! It&#39;s like I was kicked in the balls.&quot; As I held my body, I could soon no longer feel my dick as it must have dug back into my body. My insides rearranged as my body became that off a girl at last. &quot;And that&#39;s that I guess.&quot; &quot;Alex.... Ah! Ahhhhhhh!&quot; All of the sudden, Jesse let out a moan. &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t tell me?!&quot; &quot;Ahhhhhh! My pussy... My pussy feels like its on fire. Ahhhhhhh! Oh god!&quot; &quot;Holy crap!&quot; I started to panic as I led Jesse onto the bed. She laid on it, her back to the wall. She spread out her legs so we could get a better look. &quot;I can&#39;t look! Alex! Ahhhhhhh! What&#39;s it look like?!&quot; I looked carefully as her vagina as a piece of flesh was visible. It slithered out like a snake revealing a mushroom shaped piece of meat. &quot;Ahhhhhhhhh! I feel it Alex! I feel it!&quot; &quot;And I see it! Just keep pushing!&quot; I realized this sounded like she was giving birth, but I let the fact a girl was getting a dick distract me from that thought. As it continued to move out bringing a stem of flesh with it, her ball sack was forming as well. It got hairier as it moved out, her dick at least three inches at that point. They remained baggy, but soon expanded as her balls filled it in. &quot;Ah! Ah!&quot; Jesse yelped with each one forming. Her dick was about five inches now as it gained girth. Jesse finally looked down her self, her mouth opened wide. &quot;I have a dick! Oh my god! I have a dick!&quot; &quot;That you do!&quot; I replied. It continued to grow to seven inches to eight. &quot;Ummmm...&quot; By then I realized it was way too big. But I soon figured out why. &quot;Alex?! My dick is...!&quot; &quot;Yeah... I know...&quot; It eventually stopped growing at ten inches as it stood erect. It pulsed up and down. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; I moved away. &quot;Alex...&quot; Jesse looked at me. &quot;Am I...?&quot; &quot;Yeah...&quot; That was about all I could muster in reply. Her dick continued to pulse as Jeese&#39;s whole body squirmed. &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! Alex! Alex! Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah!&quot; &quot;Holy crap. Jesse?!&quot; &quot;Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! No way! No way! No way! Ah,ah,ah,ah,ah! No... WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!&quot; And as soon as she yelled that out her dick shot its load all on to her body. She moved to cover it with her hand as only her nether region became soaked in jizz, eventually coming to a stop. Jesse let go as she heaved in the mess of her bed. She looked at me dumbfoundly and with maybe mix of horror at what had just happened. &quot;Well...&quot; I muttered. &quot;Looks like your really a man now... Alex!&quot; Jesse said nothing as she composed herself. &quot;Oh shut the fuck up, Jesse!&quot; And that was how our story as each other began.</p>
