<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Even walking is distracting in your new
body. Your breasts jiggle gently as you
walk, and your hips sway slightly no
matter how hard you try to keep them from
doing so. Your hair brushes gently at the
base of your neck, making you wish you had
a pair of scissors, and even your tail
gets in on the act, swishing softly
through the air behind you and
occasionally brushing against the inside
of your legs, sending a tingle up your
spine that would be thrilling if it
weren't exactly the sort of thing you're
trying to avoid. Gritting your teeth, you
manage to focus on not noticing as you
walk on.</p>
<p>You spot a bonfire ahead and make your
way towards it. You walk into a clearing
around a large, relatively flat-topped
rock formation, on top of which is the
bonfire. Squaring your shoulders and
setting your jaw as best as you can, you
climb up on top of the rocks - you find
the climb much easier than you would have
as a human, springing from rock to rock as
if you'd been doing it all your life. When
you get to the top, nearly forty feet off
the ground, you see a ring of
animal-people like yourself, sitting
around the fire. Sitting by the fir, near
the center of the circle, is Hannah.
"Good," she says, "you came." You nod
sheepishly, realizing suddenly that you're
naked in front of a good twenty people,
but noticing that none of them seem to
care. "Next time," Hannah continues, "feel
free to take the easy way, silly kitty."
She gestures towards the other side of the
rock, where you can see a much shallower
slope than the side you just ascended.</p>
<p>"Everyone," Hannah says, "this is
Jackie. She's new here. Say hello,
Jackie." You're about to protest the
feminine renaming, but across the circle
you spot another panther - a male. All
your fears from earlier come rushing back,
and without your even willing it, your
mind goes into a full analysis. He's built
lightly, or at least looks it - he's not
visibly muscled, but neither are you, and
you were just jumping five or six feet at
one bound, so he's probably pretty strong.
His body is straight and sleek, his
shoulders square and broader than yours,
his frame sturdy but not bulky. His face
is like the rest of him, sturdy and
clean-cut, and you just manage to stop
yourself from sneaking a peek downwards,
but try as you might you can't keep
yourself from concluding - he's
<i>hot.</i></p>
<p>Yes, he's hot. The question is answered
- you are unaffected by the various
unclothed women around you, but you're
turned on by the guy across the circle.
You're heterosexual, as you were in your
normal life, but you're a heterosexual
<i>woman</i> - you're attracted to men.
<i>You're attracted to men!</i> That's
what you were fearing all along. You want
to turn away, to run off to where the guy
isn't, but you can't tear your gaze away
from him. Another faction has arisen in
your mind, one that wants to keep your
eyes fixed on this guy, one that is
willing you to go sit down next to him
and introduce yourself. The two desires
are waging a bitter war in your head, and
all you can do is stand there and
sputter.</p>
<p>"Jackie?" Hannah's voice rings through
the confusion. "Is something wrong?"
Prompted for a response, your mouth opens
and the conflict in your head pours out
into words. <i>"YES!"</i> you screech.
<i>"I'm-I'm attracted to that guy!
Something's VERY wrong!"</i></p>
<p>Hannah stares at you for a moment as
you return to sputtering, then begins to
laugh. "Oh, girl," she laughs, "there's
nothing wrong with that!"</p>
<p>You stare at her in amazement.
"Listen," she continues. "That's just what
happens when you switch sides here.
Orientation stays the same relative to
your new gender, that's just how the
system works. It throws all of us for a
loop the first time we catch on, but
there's nothing wrong about the things
you're feeling!"</p>
<p>All eyes are on you now. "But..." you
say, "but I don't...I don't want to
lose...me. I can't lose myself! What would
I do when I got home? When I was a
human man again?"</p>
<p>Hannah looks at you compassionately. "I
think," she says, "that you need to ask
yourself what constitutes your self. Is it
really going to make you a completely
different person if you're suddenly
attracted to guys? Just because you've
become a straight woman doesn't mean
you're going to turn into a complete
girly-girl. There's lots of room in the
world of womanhood for what makes you
you." She puts a hand on your shoulder.
"Trust me," she continues. "I know.
Besides, even if you do become more
feminine, is that so terrible? Everybody
changes - that's just part of life. But
changing what you <i>are</i> doesn't mean
you lose what you <i>were,</i> and it
doesn't mean you can't change back."</p>
<p>In spite of yourself, you manage a
smile. "Atta girl," Hannah says. "We'll
help you through this, if you want us to.
That's what we're here for, after all."
She smiles and helps you seat yourself by
the fire, showing you how to sit without
kinking your tail under you, then walks
over to talk with someone else. As you sit
by the roaring fire, the panther-guy you
just blurted out your attraction to comes
over. "I-I'm sorry about that," he
says.</p>
<p>"No," you say. "Don't be, it wasn't
your fault. I...I was preoccupied with my
fears, and I just...I lost it at the first
sign of my suspicions being right. I'm
sorry I lost it at you."</p>
<p>He smiles. "It's alright," he says. "I
understand completely - I'm still getting
used to it myself. Am..am I really that
attractive?"</p>
<p>You can feel yourself blushing madly
underneath your fur. You hesitate, then
answer, "Yeah."</p>
<p>You sit in awkward silence for a bit.
"I didn't introduce myself," he says,
suddenly. "I'm Keith. Or at least that's
the name Hannah gave me. I used to be
Cathy." He gets up to leave.</p>
<p>You smile, weakly. "It was nice to
meet you, Keith," you say. "I'll...I'll
see you again...sometime?"</p>
<p>Keith smiles back. "Yeah," he says.
"Yeah, I'll see you around. Tomorrow,
maybe." Then he bounds off into the
night.</p>
<p>You stare after him. Then, returning
your attention to yourself, you realize
that you're feeling warm and tingly
inside, in a way you've never felt before.
You're still not sure what to make of
this, but...if there really is no way to
avoid becoming a girl inside as well as
outside...<i>well, he's not only
attractive, but nice as well...</i></p>
<p>You shake such thoughts out of you
head and get up to meet some of the other
attendees.</p></p>
