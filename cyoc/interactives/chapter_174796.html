<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Plot hole coming up in future chapters. In a previois chapter where we last left Harry listening silently and motionlessly to age-regressed Scott talking to himself at the end of the week when he finally got back down into his lab. Where I had written: &quot;his tendency to speak to himself intact&quot; after he said to himself &quot;finally, back in my lab.&quot; This doesnt happen. His tendency to talk to himself is fading. </div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry&#39;s mind actively &quot;wakes up,&quot; as the lights come on in the lab for the first time in a week. Harry instintively tried breathing, and moving, forgetting for a moment that his body was completely made of stone. The fact that he fully expected his non-responsive body to respond, but utterly failed to, made him try again. But again, he was stuck completely motionless. He tried one more time. To even twitch a finger. Nothing. <br />
<br />
Harry felt both a rising panic, and his still-unsatiated horniness level rise. His already rock-hard adolescent penis would be rising further to attention, if it werent stuck in its stony prison. The horniness level only made him want to move even more. But his stony immobilization prevented that from happening. Which made his frustration rise even further. Which in turn, would lead to an even further increased desire to masturbate. The rising tension was making his mind begin to panic. He couldn&#39;t even change his placid stony mask of an expression. His calm,  expressionless stone face belied his budding passions in his brain. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a heavy knock at the door that led from the basement/lab directly to the back yard. His heart would have jumped, if he had one. His entire body cavity had slowly filled out to be complete rock through and through. His internal organs no longer existed, even if they were stone themselves. But the heavy knock at the door made his nearly panic-stricken mind to &quot;jump.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the slightly smaller figure of his ten year old self swiftly walked past him and opened the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vin! Thank god you&#39;re here! Oh! And Ant as well,   I see &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  jeez. Is that really you, Scott?&quot; said Vin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; he sighed heavily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you really did a number on yourself. Human trials are srill years away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Scott responded. &quot;But. Can you help me? Us?&quot; He asked, looking at the statue of the real 12 year old Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.....we do have some.....uuummm.....&#39;news.&#39;&quot; Said Vin hesitently, still standing at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why dont you guys come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Sure.&quot; The twin brothers quickly walked down the short steps and into the basement/lab below. Ant (short for Anthony) closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So. I need to turn this statue back into Harry, and me back into myself,&quot; Scott started breathlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on a second there, champ,&quot; said Ant. But he stopped and joined his brother who was studying the statue. It was an absolute perfect carving of a young naked boy. Inside, Harry was nervous, being studied by two men he barely even knew. But he was completely helpless to do anything about it. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the machine that did this to him&quot; piped up the 10 year Scott in his boy&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
The two men gathered around the Inanimation Machine next.<br />
<br />
Sparing the reader a lot of the boring engineering/science discussions while the two men and the boy went over the programming and inner workings of the machine, the brothers were rapidly coming to a conclusion that Scott already came to but had been denying all week long. <br />
<br />
Harry, meanwhile, was hopeful. He would be free of this prison soon. Help had arrived! And people knew he wasnt just an object to be looked at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Harry heard one of the men say as he walked over to the boy again. &quot;Harry is just a statue, and thats all he&#39;ll ever be. Luckily, this is just an object. It has no consciousness. It&#39;s just a thing. There is no way to turn stone into living cells. There is no brain function, for there is no brain. It is, in fact, stuck as a statue forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry&#39;s &quot;heart&quot; dropped, as he felt a pang of instant panic! <br />
<br />
&quot;As for you, my little man, I&#39;m afraid the news that we were going to share with you, is that it is impossible for that solution to ever work on you again. You&#39;re stuck as Harry. Furthermore, it appears that solution you took, also makes you ageless. You&#39;ll be stuck as a 10 year old boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s haw dropped as Vin continued;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I do mean a 10 year old. Your mind will slowly revert to a 4th grade education level. It will also take on the personality traits of young Harry here. In short, your identity will be indistinguishable from that of your own step son. Now, there will always be a part of you that will remember who you once were. But that will largely be overwritten by your immaturing mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he was speaking, the twin brother,  Anthony, was gathering up all of the research materials and placing them in boxes. Both versions of Harry were stunned. Both the statufied Harry, and the shrimpified Harry. <br />
<br />
The statue of Harry was on the verge of a mental breakdown. He couldn&#39;t be stuck like this forever! He just couldn&#39;t! At the same time, his inner darkest desire had come true. He was forever stuck as a statue cast completely in stone! He would never move. He would never communicate again. The idea both excited Harry, and appalled him. He was now a &quot;living&quot; inanimate memorial to himself. He was also forever stuck with an adolescent boner that would never go away. He was forever stuck in sexual frustration. Stuck between a boy and a man. And stuck completely and forever in place. Totally at the mercy of everyone and everything around him. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, poor Scott was stunned to learn he would be stuck as a shrimpy 10 year old. <br />
 <br />
&quot;How? Why??&quot; He demanded to know. <br />
<br />
Vin went on to explain about how the syrum is absorbed by the DNA throughout the entire body, and is dramatically changed by the syrum. The experiments on mice down at the lab had exhibited failure after failure in turning them back into mice after changing them into other species. They also took on the temperaments and intelligence of their new species, while retaining some memories of their former selves.<br />
<br />
In other words, turn out there is no going back or changing into anyone or anything else ever again. Scott was stuck in Harry&#39;s youth, while Harry was stuck as a statue.</p>
