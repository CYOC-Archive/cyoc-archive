<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We are going to be testing Formula 525, variance 1 today, please roll up your sleeve.&quot; The doctor said.<br />
<br />
Eric rolled up his sleeves and watched as Dr Veranderen emptied the large vial of fluid into his arm.<br />
<br />
“Ok Eric, you have free reign of this apartment for the day, we need to keep you here for a bit to make sure there are no adverse side affects. There is food in the kitchen and the TV you know about, have fun!” The doctor said as he walked out the door, magnetic lock engaging behind him.<br />
<br />
Eric thought to himself, ‘Why did he lock me in, it’s not like I’m going somewhere without my check,’ as he sat down on the comfy couch to watch a DVD.<br />
<br />
The doctor walked into the large observation room that spanned two sides of the test room to keep watch on Eric’s reaction to the formula. Sitting at a desk with a laptop and a camera monitor he could keep his eye on Eric as he took notes.<br />
<br />
<i>11:23 AM – Injected Formula 525, Canis Familiaris, Variance 1. Approximate Gestation: 1 – 2 Hours.</i><br />
<br />
Half hour into the movie Eric was beginning to feel a little famished and decided to check the fridge for some food. Grabbing a ham and cheese sandwich and a soda he continued his movie.<br />
<br />
<i>11:58 AM – Subject grabs lunch, no apparent affects at this time</i><br />
<br />
Eric absentmindedly scratches his stomach and chest ‘must be my fabric softener’ he thought.<br />
<br />
<i>12:42 PM – First signs of change are apparent; subject is scratching at his chest. Hair has thickened on arms and legs slightly; the once clean-shaven young man now shows a few days growth.</i><br />
<br />
Eric shifted his position as he continued to watch the movie; the couch had begun to hurt his tailbone. He stretched out across the couch lying on his side.<br />
<br />
<i>1:00 PM – FUR has increased, much thicker on arms, legs and face with a light layer forming on his neck, ears and forehead. A thick tuft of fur is sticking out the top of subject’s shirt. Subject repositioned his body due to discomfort; top down camera confirms slight bulge is forming at the rear top of shorts. No other canine features are currently apparent.</i><br />
<br />
Eric began to feel a little warm and was still all itchy. He casually moved his furry hand under his shirt giving the area around his navel a scratch. The look on his face turns from a smile to a look of shock as his open hand rubbed the thick fur on his stomach. Lifting the shirt he sees no skin just thick golden fur. Sitting up to remove his shirt he felt a sharp pain as he sat on his ass. Ignoring the pain he pulled his shirt over his head.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” Eric said in a low voice. His whole torso was covered in 2 inch long fur that spread down his arms and onto his hands. Looking down he could see the same thick fur on his legs.<br />
<br />
He had seen enough and was ready to tell the doctor of his horrible reaction. Walking up to one of the mirror covered walls he spoke to it, “Doctor? I think I’m having some sort of reaction to the formula. Doctor, you there?” Eric became very aware of the tightness in his shorts at that moment. Dropping his shorts he turned his ass to the mirror to see what was inside them. His jaw dropped at the sight of something snaking down his tight underwear and emerging from one of the legs. A fur covered tail slowly continued to grow as he watched. As it stopped he freaked wondering what else might be changing and worked the underwear completely down. His front side was completely normal aside from the thick fur; his penis was still human and hairless but every other inch of his body had fur over it.<br />
<br />
Eric stood and starred at the mirror watching, waiting for something else to happen.<br />
<br />
<i>1:25 PM – Changes have not progressed for five minutes. Process is complete. Formula 525, Canis Familiaris, Variance 1 resulted in canine fur covering body and a canine tail. Subject 525-1 will be prepared for release.</i><br />
<br />
The doctor closed the laptop and standing saw Eric pounding on the unbreakable glass crying for help, asking what had happened to him. The doctor pushed a button releasing a clear gas into the room.<br />
<br />
Eric began to feel light headed and walked his naked body back to couch where he collapsed in a daze.<br />
<br />
Dr. Veranderen cleared the gas before entering the room but it would keep Eric down for a while still.<br />
<br />
Eric looked up at the doctor and quietly said “why”.<br />
<br />
The doctor rubbed Eric’s new fur, “Don’t worry, everything will work out just fine.”<br />
<br />
At that Eric fell into a deep sleep.<br />
<br />
<hr><br />
<br />
Eric awoke 3 days later. He was sitting in the airport very disoriented not knowing how he had gotten there. He ran his fingers through the soft hair on his head (must be his new conditioner) as he saw he friends walking toward him.<br />
<br />
“So Eric you ready for Vegas!” One said as he walked up.<br />
<br />
Eric still groggy replied “Ya, its Saturday already?”<br />
<br />
“Ya dude, we haven’t heard from you in days and were worried you weren’t going to show up.”<br />
<br />
Eric had a large blank spot and no memory of the ad or any of the time at the mansion. The base of his spine was sore for some reason, maybe he had fallen at some point.<br />
<br />
Eric and his friends boarded their plane and as they were taking off  he was looking through his carryon bag. Inside was what appeared to be a copy of a will from a long lost relative. Eric’s mouth dropped as he read that $1 million worth of bearer bonds had been given to him in the will. He sure was missing those 3 days he thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Overjoyed he showed the will to his friends, they would be having a great time in Vegas.<br />
<br />
<br />
The doctor knew Eric would be needing that cash… for hair removal and razors for when his thick pelt slowly grew out over the next month.<br />
<br />
<i>Formula 525, Canis Familiaris, Variance 1 Conclusion – Subject 525-1’s fur was chemically removed so as not to be visible again for at least a week. Tail was removed only soreness should be felt. Changes have been made to Formula 525 and Variance 2 has been prepared and is ready for testing.</i></p>
