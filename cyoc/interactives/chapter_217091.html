<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now with something he also had to keep in check, Max tried his best not to think about the snake that just grew in his shorts. If he would have known he would change too along with his twin, he would have planned it out better. The one thing that he did do was press the “Memory update” for himself and Ricky(Nicki); making sure to select to keep their old memories as well. <br />
<br />
Both twins zone out for a moment while the memories flooded their minds. As their new lives stopped flashing in their minds, Ricky(Nicki) leans over. “What the hell was that?!” he whispered. <br />
<br />
“Well, I didn’t want there to be any unnecessary odd moments.” Max jokes. <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) starts to ball up her fist before catching something out the corner of her eye. Looking down at her brother, she see that his cock head was starting to grow out of his shorts. During the memory update, Max was turned on from, and growing hard. <br />
<br />
“Talk about an odd moment.” Ricky(Nicki) replies before turning to look out the window. <br />
<br />
Max was confused at first at what his twin meant before he felt his cock pull up on his pants leg as it hardens. Now at it’s full 8.75 inches, the mushroom head was well out of his pants leg and pulling up with all its blood infused life. Max grabs his bag, pretending to be searching in it, while he tries to hide the erection from his parents. <br />
<br />
As the twins both became quiet, the rest of the drive was rather unimpressive until the family made their way to the indoor water park, the first stop on their trip. The plan was to stay here a few nights before heading on to the next part of their trip.    <br />
<br />
The water park had a hotel inside it, and as the family checked in, the desk clerk gave them some unexpected news. “I am sorry sir, but the room that you originally booked had to be put into maintenance status. As you know, this is our off season, and while doing updates to some rooms, they found some electrical issues that needed to be addressed. The good news is that we will be putting you into one of the already finished wings. But there is another catch, we will be giving you two rooms. They are attached to each other, and they will both be fully furnished. One is a King bed with couch, kitchen and dining set, jacuzzi bath with shower, and TV set. The other is double queens with the same. Here are your key wrist bands and here are two for your kids. I also took the liberty of setting them for our unlimited food, drink and play option for your trouble.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks, I guess.” Geoffrey replies before handing the bands to Max and Ricky(Nicki). As all four walk up to their rooms, he then laid down some rules for the twins. “It looks like we will have to be trusting you here. So here is the deal, you two keep the room clean and unlock the door when we ask. You will be able to go out whenever you want, just let us know or send a text. I guess we now have free range of the place, with these bands, so have fun but be good. Don’t get sick from overeating or too much sugar and soda.” <br />
<br />
“Yes dad.” The twins replied in unison. The twins then looked at each other, as hearing the now girly voice of Ricky(Nicki) alongside Max’s was strange. <br />
<br />
As they got to their room, the twins scanned their wristbands to get into their room. They took their beds, Max near the door and Ricky(Nicki) near the bathroom, like always before making sure that the door connecting to their parents was locked. <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) then steps in front of Max as he was opening his luggage. “Dude, change me back. And what the fuck with giving yourself that rod.” <br />
<br />
“I didn’t do that. The device changed me when I gave you your bigger boobs.” Max replies as he pushes past his sister. <br />
“I don’t want to walk around like this.” Ricky(Nicki) replies. <br />
<br />
“Just do it for this part of the trip, and I will let you change me for the next. Alright?” Max replies, debating of honoring the deal already. <br />
Ricky(Nicki) crosses her arms, “You better. I am tired of you playing tricks on me. Even with my new memories, that I guess you gave us, you been doing mean stuff like that.” <br />
<br />
Max snickers, “You know, you are cute when you are mad. Maybe you can find a boyfriend here.” <br />
<br />
“Fuck you.” Ricky(Nicki) replies before walking over to her bags. <br />
<br />
The twins take out their clothes and throw them in the dressers, leaving out just their swimsuits. Max doesn’t hesitate to undress, his new member swinging between his legs and his larger balls behind it. As he does, he sees Ricky(Nicki) hesitate to take off her clothes. <br />
<br />
“Come on, ‘sis’. You got change in front of me this morning.” Max jokes. <br />
<br />
“Dude,” Ricky(Nicki) replies back mad. “That was not the same and you know it.” <br />
<br />
“Come on, you wont make me hard. If anything, I now how something to compare other girls with.” Max replies. <br />
<br />
“You are an ass.” Ricky(Nicki) replies. <br />
<br />
“Oh, so many bad words, I must of really pissed you off.” Max replies. <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) turns away from Max, but she knew she had to get change. She slowly lowers her skirt and panties, dropping them to the floor. She then grabs both her hoodie and shirt bottom before pulling upwards, over her head. Ricky(Nicki) tosses them to the side, as she gets her first real look (outside of memories) of her new body. <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) couldn’t really see much over her D-cup breasts. On her small body, they took up most of it. Her areola and nipple were about the size of her palm. Having the first real chance to feel them, Ricky(Nicki) brings her hands up and cup her breasts. They were soft, but firm. As her skin touched, new sensations flooded her body. A moan escaped from her mouth as her new vagina grew warm and moist. <br />
<br />
Max seeing his twin’s reaction to herself, walks over. “Do you need to have a ‘release’ before we go swimming?” <br />
<br />
Ricky(Nicki) turns, seeing Max was concerned. She replies…</p>
