<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on, Emma, let&#39;s go in. The water will be nice and refreshing. We can chat more there if you like.&quot; Alice smiles and focus on enjoying the day with Emma. As they walk towards the pool, Alice feels Jake&#39;s spandex fabric clinging to her body, and she wishes she could just talk to him and find out if he&#39;s okay. But she doesn&#39;t want to do that in front of Emma. &quot;Hey Emma, do you come here often? I&#39;m surprised we haven&#39;t met before. And are there others here with people who have been transformed into objects?&quot; she says, trying to make small talk and distract herself from her concerns about Jake. Emma thinks for a moment. &quot;Not really. I usually go to a different pool. But I saw this place online and wanted to check it out. And no, I don&#39;t think there are many others here who are transformed into objects. At least, not that I&#39;ve seen anyone else with an emitter besides you. But I&#39;m glad we met you guys. You&#39;re really nice and I&#39;m enjoying our conversation.&quot; Alice smiles, &quot;I&#39;m glad too. And I hope you&#39;ll give us the chance to meet Mike soon. I&#39;d love to talk to him as a person, not just as an object.&quot; Emma nods. &quot;I&#39;ll definitely consider it. And who knows, maybe we can all try out some new transformations together sometime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since Jake can neither see nor hear without the emitter connected to Alice&#39;s smartphone, he relies on Alice to know what she&#39;s about to do. *Where are you going with me right now? Do you want to go swimming or lie in the hot tub? Or maybe even go on the waterslide?* &quot;Yes, we&#39;re going swimming, my love,&quot; Alice replies over Mental Link. &quot;I hope the cool water will help you feel better. You seem a bit strange right now.&quot; Jake hesitates, somehow Alice is right. On the other hand, he feels great! Right now he&#39;s Alice&#39;s swimsuit, hugging her body so tightly. He can feel her every curve and every movement. *What did you mean with strange? What&#39;s strange about me? I&#39;m your swimsuit, after all, you made me this way.* Alice frowns, she doesn&#39;t quite understand Jake&#39;s response. She&#39;s used to him having his own thoughts and opinions, but now he&#39;s more and more focused on being her swimsuit. &quot;You&#39;re not just a swimsuit, Jake. You&#39;re my husband. Don&#39;t you remember that?&quot; Jake&#39;s thoughts seem confused, as if he&#39;s not sure about his identity. *Husband? What do you mean? I&#39;m your swimwear. That&#39;s all I know. That&#39;s all I am. I exist to be worn by you and to bring you joy.* Alice&#39;s concern grows, but she tries to stay calm. She and Emma have now reached the pool and they get in. Alice enjoys the cool water, it&#39;s really refreshing. The water makes Jake cling to Alice&#39;s body even more tightly. *This feels amazing! I love being in the water with you. It&#39;s like I was made for this.* Alice smiles, trying to focus on the positive. &quot;Hey Emma, how&#39;s the water? Isn&#39;t it great?&quot; Emma replies, &quot;It&#39;s perfect! Just what I needed. I&#39;m so glad I decided to come here today.&quot; Alice nods, &quot;Me too. It&#39;s nice to cool off and relax. Hey Jake, do you like the water? Is it refreshing for you?&quot; *Oh yes, it&#39;s incredible. I feel like I&#39;m really coming alive in the water. Like this is what I was really made for.* Alice giggles, &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it, my love. You seem to be enjoying it.&quot; As they swim and chat, Alice notices that Jake seems even more focused on being her swimsuit. His thoughts are consumed by the feeling of clinging to her body and bringing her joy. *I love being stretched over you like this. It&#39;s like I&#39;m a part of you. I can feel every movement you make, every breath you take. It&#39;s incredible.* Alice tries to reassure him, &quot;I love having you on me, Jake. You&#39;re an amazing swimsuit. But remember, you&#39;re more than that. You&#39;re my husband, my partner. You have your own thoughts and feelings.&quot; Jake&#39;s thoughts are a jumble of confusion and excitement. *Husband? Partner? I don&#39;t understand. I&#39;m a swimsuit. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever been. I exist to bring you pleasure and comfort. That&#39;s my purpose in life.* Alice frowns, she&#39;s getting worried now. Something is definitely wrong with Jake. She decides to try and distract him by talking to Emma. &quot;Hey Emma, what do you like to do for fun besides swimming?&quot; Emma thinks for a moment. &quot;Well, I like to read and go for walks. And I love trying out new restaurants and cuisines. How about you guys?&quot; Alice smiles, &quot;We like to cook and try out new recipes. And of course, we love to travel and explore new places.&quot; As they continue to chat and swim, Jake&#39;s thoughts start to wander. *Wait a minute... husband? Partner? What does that even mean? Am I something more than just a swimsuit?* He starts to feel a strange sensation, like a memory or a feeling from somewhere else. *I think... I think I remember something. Being a person? Having thoughts and feelings? But no, that can&#39;t be right. I&#39;m a swimsuit.* Alice notices Jake&#39;s confusion. &quot;Jake, what&#39;s going on? You seem lost in thought.&quot; *I don&#39;t know. I feel strange. Like there&#39;s something I&#39;m forgetting. But it seems not important. All that matters is that I&#39;m your swimsuit and I make you happy.* Alice&#39;s concern grows, but she doesn&#39;t want to push Jake too hard. She decides to let him process his thoughts for now. Emma suggests they swim over to the other side of the pool, and Alice agrees. As they swim, the friction of the water against Jake&#39;s spandex fabric starts to feel good. Really good. *Oh wow, this feels amazing. I love the way the water moves against me. It&#39;s like I&#39;m being caressed all over.* Alice smiles, &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it, Jake. The water feels great, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; *Yes, it&#39;s incredible. I&#39;ve never felt anything like this before. It&#39;s like my whole body is being massaged.* As they continue to swim, Jake becomes more and more aroused by the feeling of the water and Alice&#39;s body inside him. *This is the best feeling ever. I love being your swimsuit, Alice. I love the way I cling to your body, the way I feel every curve and movement. I exist only for this.* Alice notices Jake&#39;s growing excitement and feels a mix of concern and amusement. &quot;Jake, you&#39;re getting a bit carried away, aren&#39;t you?&quot; *What do you mean? This is what I was made for. To bring you joy and pleasure. I love being stretched over your body.* As they near the other side of the pool, Jake&#39;s arousal reaches a peak. The combination of the water, Alice&#39;s movements, and his own thoughts about being her swimsuit sends him over the edge. *Oh my god, I&#39;m... I&#39;m...* Jake experiences an intense orgasm as a swimsuit; it&#39;s almost as if his spandex fabric is trembling with pleasure, which isn&#39;t actually possible, since he&#39;s made of just plain Spandex and Polyamide fibers and thus has no ability for active movement. Alice also senses his orgasmic state and can&#39;t help but giggle. &quot;Oh Jake, you&#39;re so funny. You had an orgasm as a swimsuit!&quot; *What... what just happened? That felt amazing! I think I&#39;ve never felt anything like that before. Did you have this in mind how I should feel when you made me? Can we do it again? Please, I want to feel it again. I want to bring you pleasure and joy all the time.* Alice laughs and shakes her head. &quot;You&#39;re something else, you know that? But I&#39;m glad you enjoyed yourself. Maybe we can try something else.&quot; Alice turns to Emma. &quot;Hey Emma, are you coming to the slide? I&#39;d love to go down that long, winding slide one two or three times. And I think Jake might want to go there, too.&quot; She thinks for a moment and adds, &quot;Isn&#39;t it a bit sad that Mike doesn&#39;t get to experience all of this? Not even afterward?&quot; Emma laughs. &quot;Well, you never know, maybe he&#39;ll surprise me someday and wants to be a sentient object.&quot; Alice giggles and they swim over to the pool slide. Jake can feel the excitement building up again as Alice prepares to go down the slide. *Oh yes, please. Take me with you. I want to experience everything with you.* Alice smiles and positions herself at the top of the slide. &quot;Are you ready, my dear swimsuit?&quot; Jake moans. *Yes, I am. I&#39;m ready for anything.* And with that, Alice slides down the slide, taking Jake with her on the wild ride. Jake experiences a rush of exhilaration and pleasure as they zoom through the twists and turns. Jake&#39;s arousal builds up again more and more. *Oh wow, this is incredible! I&#39;ve never felt anything like this! It&#39;s like I&#39;m flying!* Just after one turn more he starts to moan softly again, feeling an orgasm is building up again. Alice feels Jake&#39;s moaning and gets a little bit aroused too, but she is not sure if she can go all the way. They continue to slide down and Jake feels like his pleasure is going to explode any second now. Finally, they splash down at the bottom of the slide. *Yes, yes, YES! I&#39;m coming again! I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m your swimsuit! I love you, Alice! I exist only for you!* Alice laughs and shakes her head, amused by Jake&#39;s antics. &quot;Oh Jake, you&#39;re so silly. But I love you too.&quot; She turns to Emma. &quot;That was fun, wasn&#39;t it? What did you think of the slide?&quot; Emma grins. &quot;It was great! I love the way it curves and twists. And I have to say, it looks like your swimsuit had a good time too.&quot; Alice giggles. &quot;Oh, he definitely did. I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s gotten into him today, but he&#39;s really enjoying himself as a swimsuit.&quot; Emma smiles. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s happy. And I have to admit, seeing you two together is really sweet. You guys have a great relationship.&quot; Alice smiles, &quot;Thank you. We really do love each other, and we love to have fun together. Speaking of which, what do you think about going to the hot tub next?&quot; Emma nods. &quot;That sounds great. I could use a good soak after that slide.&quot; They swim over to the hot tub and get in, letting the warm, bubbly water massage their bodies. Alice feels Jake relaxing against her skin. *That was amazing. I love being your swimsuit. I love experiencing everything with you.* Alice smiles, &quot;I&#39;m glad you enjoyed the slide, Jake. But maybe now you should relax a bit. We&#39;re just going to soak here for a while.&quot; Jake hesitates, still feeling the afterglow of his orgasm. *Relax? But I&#39;m already relaxed. I&#39;m just happy being your swimsuit and feeling you inside me. This is what I was made for.* Alice sighs, she&#39;s still concerned about Jake&#39;s state of mind. &quot;My dear swimsuit, I have to tell you, I notice that you seem to be repeating yourself over and over again. Don&#39;t you even notice it yourself? You keep saying that you exist just to bring me pleasure and joy. And that you&#39;re just a simple swimsuit. But I know that&#39;s not true. You&#39;re my husband, Jake. You have your own thoughts, your own feelings. Don&#39;t you remember being a human being?&quot; Jake pauses, feeling that strange sensation again. *Human being? I... I don&#39;t know. Is that what I am? No, I&#39;m a swimsuit. I&#39;m your swimsuit. That&#39;s all that matters. I love being your swimsuit.* Alice tries to reassure him, &quot;Jake, listen to me. You are more than just a swimsuit. You&#39;re a person with your own identity. You have thoughts and feelings and desires beyond just being an object.&quot; Jake hesitates, his thoughts a jumble of confusion and arousal. *But... but what if I&#39;m not? What if I&#39;m just a swimsuit, made to bring you pleasure? Is that so bad? I love being your swimsuit. It feels so good, so right.* The warm water, the bubbles, and especially the water jets quickly distract Jake. He was just in the afterglow of his orgasm, and now he&#39;s back in the middle of his arousal plateau. *Oh, this hot tub makes me feel sooo good... Did you come here for a purpose? Mmm... yes... this purpose?* His moans reach Alice via mental link. Alice sighs, feeling a mix of frustration and amusement. She decides to let Jake process his thoughts for now and just enjoy the moment. She leans back and relaxes in the warm water. &quot;Let&#39;s just enjoy this for now, shall we? We can talk more later.&quot; As they soak in the hot tub, Alice starts to feel a bit more relaxed. Emma seems to be enjoying herself too, letting out contented sighs. Alice tries to push aside her concerns about Jake&#39;s state of mind and just enjoy the warm water and Emma&#39;s company. She also likes his moans. After all, they excite her too. Besides the fact that she loves feeling Jake&#39;s spandex stretched around her. Her vulva has been continuously well-circulated and swollen ever since she put him on. She smiles at Emma. &quot;This is nice, isn&#39;t it? Just relaxing in the warm water and chatting.&quot; Emma nods. &quot;Definitely. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve had a chance to just relax like this. Mike&#39;s usually just an object, so we don&#39;t really have conversations like this when we&#39;re out.&quot; Alice laughs. &quot;I understand. It&#39;s nice to have someone to talk to while we&#39;re out, especially when it&#39;s someone as interesting as you.&quot; Emma smiles back. &quot;Thanks Alice, you&#39;re really sweet. I&#39;m having a great time getting to know you better.&quot; As they continue to chat and soak in the hot tub, Jake&#39;s moans become more frequent and intense. *Oh yes, this is amazing! I love the way the water jets hit me! It&#39;s like a massage all over! And the bubbles! Mmm... it feels so good to be your swimsuit in this hot tub! Please, let&#39;s stay here forever! I want to feel this pleasure always! I exist only to bring you joy, Alice! Use me! Take advantage of me! Make me feel good!* Alice feels Jake&#39;s excitement building up again and can&#39;t help but get a bit aroused too. But she also feels a pang of concern. She&#39;s not sure what&#39;s going on with Jake&#39;s mind, but she doesn&#39;t want to ruin the moment. She decides to just enjoy the time with Emma and let Jake experience whatever he&#39;s feeling. As they continue to relax in the hot tub, Alice and Emma chat about their lives, their interests, and their experiences with the Transform-O-Matic.</p>
