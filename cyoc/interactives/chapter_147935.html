<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The nudity warning is more for parts mentioned that one would see on a naked person, not actual nudity.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Agatha rather enjoyed her new status as a Dinotopian and a real part of her was interested in the new colony in Texas, at least from a point of curiosity. However with some acclimation classes and other issues that she had to manage, a move... or at least considering wasn&#39;t quite in the cards, yet. At the same time, Lyre and Animalia also seemed to be awash in excitement over the IAC, as the large Animalian sporting events and arenas had attracted a lot of attention the first time around and now with more experience behind the organizers, it appeared that the events would have even more attention than before. <br />
<br />
Some of it was good and some of it was a bit odd, even for her. For she&#39;d found that with more people starting to trickle in as tourists to watch the IAC, there were more cat calls and other things that really startled her at times. The whistles and cries of &quot;thicc&quot; in her direction were not what she expected, particularly when many of the people doing so didn&#39;t strike her as appealing to her and likely weren&#39;t interested in converting. This in turn meant that their sole reason for coming to Lyre/Animalia was pretty much to gawk at Animalians, which only reminded her of her own past mistakes and issues, things she actually wanted to get away from. She gave a small &quot;humph&quot; after one group proceeded to make those calls after a workout at the Claw Coliseum and continued on her way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to it in time,&quot; came a feminine voice from beneath her.<br />
<br />
Agatha looked down to see a female Mink Animalian standing beneath her. With her height as a Therizinosaurus Dinotopian, she towered over the Mink Animalian, but the  Mink seemed calm and pretty much unconcerned with what she had likely witnessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t become an Animalian to be gawked at or treated as a sex object,&quot; Agatha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But most Animalians are built to attract that sort of attention... to a degree that most Humans don&#39;t get,&quot; the Mink commented, &quot;the average woman&#39;s cup size is a B to a small C cup. The smallest cup size for a female Animalian is a D cup. The average male penis is around seven to eight inches long. The smallest size a male Animalian&#39;s penis is at ten and a half inches... and that&#39;s with Animalians that are about the same size as Humans... Dogs, Cats, and...&quot; she paused to smile, &quot;Mink. As you start getting into Animalians that are bigger than Humans, those numbers will increase and increase proportionately to their body size. Which, when you add in a lot of the muscle mass that all Animalians have and added curves to female Animalians... that sort of response is a given. We are built to attract sexual attention. Not something we can get away from. And Animalia&#39;s been around long enough that you should know that by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agatha sighed and nodded. She did know that, but her conversion was not about being sexy or being anything like that. It was mostly to heal from the wounds related to botched surgeries for a job that she only took because it was the only one that would let her keep her Goth personality and didn&#39;t demand she be some kind of peppy cheerleader. She did feel more cheerful now, and she wasn&#39;t necessarily opposed to having the attention, but she preferred it if it was a bit less crass than it was. Approach and talk, not just the &quot;wow, what a thicc ass... I&#39;d tap that&quot; sort of thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do understand,&quot; Agatha answered, &quot;I just... would want the attention to be more than just sexual innuendo. I had to deal with enough of that in the past. Joining Animalia was to get away from that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Mink nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sure... and many Animalians often looking for mates do look for that sort of thing... but with the way we&#39;re built... that crass behavior is likely always going to be there. Particularly when a fair number don&#39;t mind some of that attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a stripper?&quot; Agatha asked.<br />
<br />
The Mink shook her head, &quot;No, I don&#39;t work at the Meat Market. My name is Maggie... a lot of my work has been more with professional modelling. Not as sexual as pornography and stripping... but not too terribly distant, particularly when one considers that sex sells, regardless of what one thinks... Though the school for modelling and the agency I&#39;ve run to help its graduates does focus on the more tasteful side of things. If some want to get into things more... exotic, that&#39;s entirely up to them. And I&#39;ve had a few students that almost exclusively work with more professional and conservative attire. So it&#39;s not all about sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agatha slowly nodded, &quot;I&#39;m Agatha... though you could call me Aggie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what are you interested in?&quot; Maggie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now... mostly getting through my acclimation classes and figuring out how to manipulate these things,&quot; Agatha answered as she held her hands before her and displaying the long claws on them.<br />
<br />
And her claws were something that hampered her dexterity. Her bulkier fingers hampered that a fair amount, but the long claws, proportionately longer than the claws on any of the other Animalians that Agatha had seen, added to that. The claws weren&#39;t as sensitive as her hands were, which made manipulating things with them fairly difficult. For clothing, it had meant a preference for work out clothes and things with plenty of elastic and didn&#39;t require the use of manipulating buttons and zippers. She managed and she enjoyed being different as a Therizinosaurus, but she did have to recognize that her lengthy claws did present a problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;And after that?&quot; Maggie wondered, noting the claws and figured they had to present issues, and many of which would become fairly limiting with most things. She figured that Agatha wouldn&#39;t have great computer skills. Even with a keyboard scaled up to Dinotopians, her lengthy claws would limit how fast she could type or manipulate office equipment if she sought any sort of administrative career and they might also limit her with anything that would require her to have a great deal of dexterity.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment... I&#39;m not fully sure...&quot; Agatha managed, &quot;I enjoy the workouts... but Lyre and Animalia are already set in that department. Having lots of gym managers probably wouldn&#39;t help...  Maybe in Dino City when I can get down there after my acclimation classes... though I&#39;ve heard some rumors that there are some Dinotopians that might also be starting their own gym once things are established... I really don&#39;t know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may offer... why not stick with some form of modeling,&quot; Maggie offered, &quot;I can help you with how it would work professionally. And it won&#39;t be sexual unless you want it to be. And with the Dinotopians getting their colony... their numbers may see a bigger increase now that they&#39;ll have a place that is big enough for them. And all of that will mean ads for attire to fit them... You could focus to present sports and exercise wear. Classes won&#39;t be too pricy and once you&#39;ve graduated... you&#39;ll earn a decent amount of money as some of the companies have had interest in Animalian models...&quot;<br />
<br />
Agatha was silent for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I assure you... no sexual pressure will be put on you from me or anyone that the agency typically works with, unless you expressly want that,&quot; Maggie finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me finish my acclimation classes,&quot; Agatha said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ll let you know then.&quot;</p>
