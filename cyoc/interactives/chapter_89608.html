<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two college coeds silently opened the garage door as the drove off in Kellie&#39;s minivan. Mika had insisted that Katie drive even though she never had before. Katie was cautious at first but soon got the hang of it speeding along the road. The two girls now talked of their plans for the evening. Mika wanted to buy some alcohol and junk food for the party, it had been so long since she had cut loose that she was looking forward to a fun night. Katie was a little apprehensive about this idea but was eventually convinced by Mika. The high spirited Asian girl assured Katie they wouldn&#39;t mess up the house and that Kellie would be none the wiser. Katie breathed a little easier at this idea, Mika was proving to be quite the energetic one.<br />
<br />
Katie and Mika were so absorbed in their conversation they didn&#39;t notice the stop sign they ran through or the cop car that pulled up behind them. When the officer began flashing their lights and ordering them to pull over the girls looked at eachother apprehensively. &quot;Mika what should I do?&quot; Katie asked nervously. &quot;Just pull over and show the cop your license,&quot; she said. Katie looked at the girl with a look of fear in her face. &quot;Mika I don&#39;t have a license&quot; Mika&#39;s jaw dropped as she stared at the fearful college girl. &quot;How can you not have a license,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;I have my license how can you not have yours.&quot; &quot;You had a license before you got younger,&quot; she moaned. &quot;I never had one to begin with. The ring didn&#39;t give me it for some reason. I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika looked back to see the cop exit the car and slowly begin walking towards the car. &quot;Katie I think your going to have to use the ring on her,&quot; she said. Katie looked flabbergasted at Mika but realized she had no choice. As the cop ordered Katie to role down the window Katie looked at her. The police officer was a Hispanic woman in her early thirties. Katie could see by the name plate the woman&#39;s name was Nieves. She had an athletic build with c cup breasts and chestnut hair tied back in a bun. &quot;Roll the window down miss,&quot; officer Nieves said. &quot;How old should I make her,&quot; Katie asked. &quot;Young enough to not be driving a cop car.&quot; Mika exclaimed. Katie looked back at the cop and wished the woman to be six years old.<br />
<br />
Katie complied with the police officers windows and watched the woman for any signs of regression. &quot;Is their a problem officer?&quot; She asked. Elizabeth Nieves tipped her cap up and stared down at the young coed. &quot;Did you see that stop sign back their miss?&quot; She asked. Katie nodded no and stared at Elizabeth. Elizabeth had reentered her twenties as her skin looked more refreshed. The small crows feet she had had faded leaving her skin flawless. &quot;Let me see your license and registration,&quot; she ordered. &quot;I don&#39;t have a license,&quot; Katie stammered. &quot;She forgot it at home,&quot; Mika added. Elizabeth shot Mika a fierce look, which quickly quieted her. Turning back to Katie she looked her over. &quot;Stay here for a minute I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
Katie and Mika watched as the 28 year old police officer returned to her car. &quot;How long do you think it will take before she&#39;s done regressing?&quot; Mika asked. Katie shrugged as she waited patiently. After a couple of minutes Elizabeth returned. Katie could see that the the cop was now about the same age as Katie and Mika. The 21 year old officer was adjusting her loose pants that seemed to be sliding off her narrowing hips. The girls face also had become softer, losing the sternness of a couple of minutes ago. &quot;I need you to step out of the car please,&quot; she said as she slipped back to 20. Katie complied and slowly opened the door. Now standing before the youthening police officer Katie could see that the woman was a little taller than her. Her chestnut hair was beginning to unravel from her bun and cascade down her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Katie watched as Elizabeth reentered her teens. Although she was talking to Katie she wasn&#39;t listening to the speech. Elizabeth was rapidly losing the athletic build of her twenties as she began the slow descent into her teens. While still shapely for an 18 year old girl she had lost the muscle tone she had built up from ten years on the force. Katie watched in awe as Elizabeth was now beginning to shrink. The 17 year old was continuing to talk to Katie but cleared her throat. Elizabeth had a puzzled look on her face, her voice didn&#39;t sound right, it sounded younger. Shaking it off she continued to reprimand the college girl as she adjusted her loosening pants.<br />
<br />
Katie continued to wartch as Elizabeth became 16. The teen was continuing to scold Katie for her mistake but Katie would not respond. As she went from 16 to 15 Katie watched as the police cruiser was erased from existence. The 15 year old continued to scold Katie as Katie smiled. This only enraged the young teen who began pointing her finger at Katie. Katie surpressed a giggle at the young teens actions. The cuff of her shirt had slid over her wrist and covered the lower part of her had. Elizabeth shook her hand free and looked herself over. Her pants were becoming increasingly loose on her waist and the cuffs now dragged on the floor slightly. Elizabeth&#39;s shirt was also becoming increasing baggy as her breasts shrank down to small b&#39;s.<br />
<br />
A confused look spread on the young teens face as she becam a skinny 14 year old. Katie was now a few inches taller than the girl, which didn&#39;t make any sense to Elizabeth. Shaking it off Elizabeth glared up at Katie with all the sternness her 13 year old features could muster. Katie was now finding it difficult to hold in a laugh as Elizabeth became 12. The preteen in the overly large police uniform only got angrier at Katie&#39;s lack of respect and began to flail her arms at the college girl. Unfortunately her pants could no longer hold onto her narrow hips and cascaded down her skinny legs. Elizabeth made a scramble to pick her pants of the ground and readjust them. She couldn&#39;t understand why they were so loose and found her service belt just caused them to cascade to the floor.<br />
<br />
Katie now giggled openly at the young girls plight. A now 11 year old Elizabeth gave up the struggle and kicked her overly large shoes and pants away. The young girl now stood in sock covered feet as she held up her belt, the only thing saving her dignity at this point was the overly large shirt, which descended to mid theigh. Elizabeth was now forced to push her hat up as she became 10. All signs of puberty had been wiped away from the cute Hispanic girl. Elizabeth&#39;s chestnut colored hair had come loose from its bun and now cascaded to the middle of her back.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as Elizabeth reentered single digits the young girl had finally stopped trying to reprimand her and looked  up at Katie with a look of confusion. Elizabeth looked around wondering what she was doing here talking with this older girl. The eight year old was apprehensive being out at night and was wondering where her parents were. Katie smiled warmly at the young girl as she once again pushed her hat up.<br />
<br />
Katie watched as the final years melted away from Elizabeth leaving her an adorable child of six. Elizabeth&#39;s shirt now covered her down to her calfs as the sleeves went several inches past her hands. The young girl now continually had to push the overly large hat out of her eyes, which were moist with tears. &quot;You okay sweety,&quot; Katie asked. Elizabeth nodded shyly but still had a look of fear in her eyes. &quot;What&#39;s your name little one?&quot; She asked. &quot;Elizabeth,&quot; she lisped. &quot;But everyone calls me Lizzy.&quot; Katie smiled warmly down at the little girl. &quot;What a pretty name,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;Lizzy why don&#39;t you come with us. It&#39;s too dangerous to be out here by yourself. Were friends of your parents we&#39;ll take you too them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Lizzy nodded shyly and shuffled into the back of Katie&#39;s car. Katie buckled the young girl in and returned to the drivers seat. &quot;Okay that&#39;s taken care so what do we do now?&quot; Mika asked. Katie shrugged, she had no answer for what they should do next.</p>
