<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...But Joey never got the chance as they were interupted by a knock at the door. &quot;Come on in!&quot; Dr Von Hauser called out. The door opened and Joey&#39;s mother, Julie, walked in, oblivious to the naked truth in front of her. Joey felt an overwhelming wave of shame as he realised his mother was about to see him naked for the first time sense he was a little kid, but this time with his whole 14 year old package on display. He cupped his hands in front of him, in an attempt to retain some dignity, as she entered the room and sat on the couch uncomfortably close to him. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late, traffic was hell.&quot; she saidwith a sigh. &quot;Perfectly understandable Mrs Adams. Right, so me and Joey had decided to pick up where we left off last week wh-&quot;<br />
<br />
But Joey wasn&#39;t listening. He was far too freaked out, confused and scared for his own good right now that his previous wish to enable thought-based wishes wasn&#39;t going well, judging by the fact that he was sat, buck naked, in a therpy session with his fully clothed mother and his sexy-as-hell psychiatrist, who was also naked except for her black pumps. Add to that, the fact that both Dr Von Hauser and his mother was completely oblivious to any of it. It was all a bit too much for poor Joey. He couldn&#39;t recall a time when he was more uncomfortable, embarrassed and ashamed in his entire life. The shame of simply being naked in front of them had robbed him of his free will.<br />
<br />
Joey couldn&#39;t stop his mind from running away with itself and, in the confusion, he accidently made a few wishes. The first thing Joey noticed that clued him into the fact that things had changed was when looked back at his psychiatrist, who was now fully clothed again in her normal black suit jacket, white shirt, black skirt atire, still talking to his still fully clothed mother. It was all so perfectly normal. Except for Joey, who was still sitting there, stark naked, with neither of them noticing in any way. And, for some reason Joey couldn&#39;t comprehend, he knew that they nor anyone anywhere never would notice. He also knew, but didn&#39;t know how he knew, was that A) if he went home, right now, that every single article of clothing, including shoes, that he owned was gone; B) That if he ever tried to put on clothes, they&#39;d simply vanish, leaving him perminatly naked forever and C) This was a perminate thing that no wish would ever undo. As far as the world was concerned, Joey Adams was just as clothed as the rest of the world.<br />
<br />
But Joey knew better. He could feel the texture of the carpet beneath his feet; the leather of the couch against his bare ass; The unexpected cool breeze of the overhead air conditioning unit, which made goose bumps appear all over his skin and his nipples stiffen in the office&#39;s cold interior. Joey couldn&#39;t concentrate any more and almost started panicking. How would it be to be seen by his girlfriend like this? Joey hadn&#39;t been dating Sharon for less that a month. They&#39;d never even seen each other naked, much less had sex with each other yet. He kept expecting for her to suddenly come in and join them, just to complete his humiliation. The final clue, that disturbed Joey the most, was that the wishing ring he&#39;d been given by the old lady was no longer on his finger, it was simply gone. Had it moved onto a new owner somewhere? Or had Joey accidently wished it out of existance? Joey never found out and these questions would haunt him until his dying day. All Joey knew for sure was that he&#39;d messed it up again. Big time.<br />
<br />
&quot;... And what I&#39;m really trying to say, Mrs Adems,  is that I believe Joey has some deep rooted depression and anxiety issues that I think we should work on in our future sessions.&quot; Dr. Von Hauser continued, oblivious to Joe&#39;s internal monologue. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but that just happens to be how I feel about it. What do you think about this Joey?&quot; she asked him, shocking him out of his thoughts. Joey looked up and realised that all eyes were on him and he had no idea what to do. His life was now fundimentily different and they were more concerned about his behaviourial problems at school than the fact that he was now a perminate 24 hour, 365 day unwilling nudist. Karma must&#39;ve been having a field day with this. &quot;Oh Joey, you do understand that this is all in your best interest. You do, don&#39;t you?&quot; Julie asked her son, placing her hand on his bare naked upper thigh, uncomfortably close to Joey&#39;s manhood, almost giving Joey a heart attack in the process, while Dr Von Hauser looked at Joey with concern, sitting there with her notepad looking back at him. &quot;Um...I-I, er...dunno?&quot; Joey managed to squeek out, sounding totaly humiliated and defeated. It was all Joey contributed to the entire session.<br />
<br />
As Joey survived what had to be, hands down, the single most embarrassing day of his entire life, he kept asking himself one question; what exactly had happened to his wishing ring?</p>
