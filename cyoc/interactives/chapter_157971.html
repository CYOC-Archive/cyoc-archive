<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice sat herself down in her usual chair, the one she started in. Thomas did the same with his chair, Rachael hadn’t moved (not that she could), and Brian had just watched everything unfold in front of him, but was in his chair.<br />
<br />
Alice looked at the card, she read it all through again,<br />
“Hold on...” she said, then paused,<br />
“What?” Thomas said, still sorta checking out his sister (he couldn’t help it),<br />
“It says that if a player gets 3 of the same dice in a row they get a golden dice,”<br />
“Yeah. It did. Nobody got 3 in a... wait did you?” Thomas said,<br />
“Yeah! I got a pink 4, a green 4, and a blue 4. Look I’ve got the blue one right here...” she reached into her pocket, she went to pull out her blue dice but instead pulled out a golden one. It was mesmerising to look at.<br />
<br />
Alice was looking at her dice, excited that she had won it, then she noticed that a card from the centre of the pile slid over to her, she picked it up and read it,<br />
<br />
“Congratulations player! You have just received the golden dice. This dice may be used after the game is completed.<br />
The game will play as normal;<br />
All players will gain clothing that matches their body size and any changes applied to them,”<br />
<br />
Alice stopped, she looked at her brother. His small dress grew longer and split in half. Grey tights wrapped over his legs, large boots that made him even taller appeared on his feet. The bottom half of the now two part dress became black panties. The top half shrank into a black bra. Holding his DD bust. Over that formed a dark sweater that covered most of his upper body, which tightened a tiny bit, showing off more curves. The sweater was very long and covered his panties and most of his thighs. Black lipstick, eyeliner, and to top it off, his skin became a few shades lighter. His black hair was longer and he had bangs. He realised that he had become a typical goth girl. He tried to wipe the makeup off his face with hand, and instead of making an ugly smudge. The makeup didn’t move. The makeup was a part of him. He had black lips and paler skin, his eyes naturally had eyeliner. He sighed, “typical for this game to make that assumption because I’ve got black hair now, ugh,” <br />
His attitude hadn’t changed, but it was more apparent why the game decided to change him to this.<br />
<br />
Alice was next her tiny skirt and t-shirt were no match for her new ass and breasts. The skirt became yoga pants, tight and showing off her curves from the waist down. Her tiny t-shirt changed to become a bra, not any bra. A push up bra. Showing off her bountiful breasts through the use of cleavage. Over the top of this bra formed a pink top, bearing her midriff off and not removing anything from her cleavage. Her bra was poking over the top of the tiny piece of fabric they called clothing. Her feet were covered by trainers. She watched her skin as it brightened and darkened at the same time. Luckily she didn’t have a huge tan but her skin was noticeably different. Her lips brightened, her cheeks became rosier.<br />
Alice became a typical teenager, tanned skin and revealing clothes. Matching with her blonde hair and massive assets.<br />
The worst part. Alice loved it.<br />
<br />
Surprised, Brian changed. He was a 27 year old at this point, his clothes change to seem a little more to date, but overall not changing all too much.<br />
<br />
Everybody looked at Rachael as she was about to change, she knew what was coming. But instead of what she thought was coming, instead she felt that familiar feeling in her chest and her butt. It clicked, since the game thought she was cheating those few rounds ago, she would get the change of other players. This one was only just kicking in. <br />
<br />
She felt her butt grow larger, she lifted higher in her chair, higher and higher until she stopped. Even with Thomas being 6 foot 2, she was the highest up while sitting down. Her butt was almost entirely off the chair.<br />
She watched her breasts, already at the edge of her belly. They grew, larger and larger, buttons popping off, flying across the room. Her breasts reached past her belly, they spilled not only off the front but also now off the sides of it. Her boobs kept growing until they finally stopped. They sat on the table. They were giant. They were massive. They were also exposed after the growth ripped open her husbands borrowed shirt.<br />
<br />
She waited for herself to grow taller, she didn’t. She thought back to the card when she was told she was cheating, she left out the part that said, the punishment is limit to 2 changes that occurred per player.<br />
<br />
Then remembering per player, she hadn’t changed for Thomas yet. Her breasts grew again, bigger again, together, they were the size of her belly and a half. Her butt grew again as well.<br />
<br />
She was absolutely massive. A woman with this amount of fat and this size of breasts and ass is insane.<br />
<br />
She noticed the remains of her button shirt reforming they seemed to grapple around her breasts and scoop them up, a bra was made. It was massive. So much cleavage showed through it as well. It grabbed her breasts. They weren’t lifted by any means but they were supported. Her panties grew larger and larger until they actually covered her up. Over her legs formed jeans. These jeans were massive, they barely fitted over her butt. But they managed to. Thank god for magic. And a button up rose blouse with a floral pattern on it covered the rest of her body. Her breasts pushed on it but covered it up.<br />
<br />
The whole family were dressed to match their body’s.</p>
