<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke&#39;s stomach grumbled, making him open his eyes. He glanced at his clock - it was nearly 11, prime time for everyone heading out to parties on campus, but there weren&#39;t so many food options left. The only place nearby was the campus late night joint. All they had were french fries, hot dogs, and chicken strips, not the most healthy food. Luke&#39;s friends had warned him about the Freshman 15, but he wasn&#39;t too worried: at 6&#39;4&quot; he&#39;d always been lanky and any extra calories he consumed never seemed to stick around.<br />
<br />
Throwing on some shorts, flip flops, and a t-shirt from college orientation, Luke started to head out to the cafe. It was a warm night in September, and a lot of people were out and about on campus. As he got closer, the smells of greasy fries, pizza, and melted nacho cheese wafted from the cafe. By the time Luke reached the pool of lamplight above the double doors, there was already a line of other kids waiting for orders. Everyone was chatting and laughing, and Luke felt self-conscious that he was there by himself.<br />
<br />
Finally, he reached the front of the line. The guy behind the counter was a senior, and looked like maybe he had been on the football or wrestling team: he had huge shoulders, and a full beard too. Definitely wasn&#39;t in-shape anymore though: even though he was wearing an apron, Luke could see his shirt riding up his sides, exposing a glimpse of love handles. Man, if this is what college late night food did, maybe he shouldn&#39;t come here too often. His stomach gurgled again, and he decided a treat every now and then couldn&#39;t hurt.<br />
<br />
He ordered chicken strips, which came with fries anyway. The guy at the counter took his order, glanced up at Luke, and then smiled. Luke smiled back, he&#39;d never seen this guy before but he looked so friendly. Luke could see his name tag read &quot;Steve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ve got a special milkshake tonight&quot; said Steve. &quot;It&#39;s really good - we put in some malt and other stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I think I&#39;m good, but thanks,&quot; Luke shrugged, fumbling with his wallet to get out his student card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me,&quot; said Steve, as Luke looked up again, &quot;you&#39;ll like it.&quot; Luke paused, and saw Steve&#39;s eye twitch a little. Did he just wink? Luke had never been winked at before, not by any of the girls he&#39;d dated back in high school - his height made him stand out, but none of his relationships had really gone anywhere past a few weeks. But a dude? <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, ok,&quot; said Luke, a too flustered to do anything but acquiesce. He wasn&#39;t gay or anything, but for some reason, just being paid attention to after an evening of other kids ignoring him made Luke feel better.<br />
<br />
&quot;Coming right up man,&quot; grinned Steve.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later Luke&#39;s tray of chicken and fries was up at the window. A large cup with a straw was on the tray too: Luke knew he&#39;d only been charged for a regular shake, but they must have made a mistake or something because this was definitely 20 oz at least. <br />
<br />
Luke had some trouble finding a seat, the cafe was crowded and more students kept coming in. Finally he saw a hand wave at him from across the room. For a moment he thought it might be one of the kids from his dorm, but it was a guy he&#39;d never seen before: short and stocky with sandy hair. Luke walked over and saw at the table of three guys, there was an empty chair. &quot;Saw you needed a seat, grab this one&quot; said the kid who had waved.<br />
<br />
Luke sat down and glanced around at the other guys. They all looked like upperclassmen, definitely in their 20s already. They also looked like they probably came here a lot: all of them were on the bigger side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks dude,&quot; said Luke, and then heard his stomach rumble audibly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem!&quot; said the stocky guy with sandy hair, &quot;Sounds like you&#39;ve waited long enough for some grub, so don&#39;t let us hold you up.&quot; Luke blushed a little but he was really too hungry to care that much.<br />
<br />
Luke learned the sandy haired guy was Isaac, the guy in the baseball cap was Charlie, and the last guy, who was tall with tan skin and whose tank top showed off thick, but not very muscled arms, was named Johan. He learned they were all former athletes, but for one reason or another had dropped off their teams over the last few years. One of them started talking about a show Luke watched, and they laughed about last week&#39;s episode. These guys weren&#39;t so bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you got the special shake, huh?&quot; Isaac asked. He pushed his chair back a bit so he could turn toward Luke, and Luke noticed the guy&#39;s beer belly was just round enough that he couldn&#39;t have turned comfortably without moving away from the table. Man, these guys really looked like they&#39;d let themselves go during college. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should try your shake&quot; continued Isaac, &quot;it&#39;s great. They only make them here once a week, when that guy Steve is working.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure know the menu,&quot; said Luke, and then caught himself. How rude was that to say! <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man,&quot; Charlie grinned. Apparently none of them had taken offense. &quot;This place is great, we come here all the time. Once you figure out what&#39;s good, it&#39;s hard not to come back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke tentatively picked up the massive milkshake, and took a sip. Isaac and the others were right: it was so good, malty and creamy, and so thick that the container felt heavy in his hand. He continued sucking on the straw, feeling the cold ice cream and milk all the way down to his stomach. Actually, he couldn&#39;t remember a shake ever tasting so good.<br />
<br />
They continued chatting for a while, and then Luke gave another slurp on his straw and came up with nothing but air. &quot;Sounds like you polished that shake off dude,&quot; said Johan. &quot;They&#39;re so good right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but I just started drinking it,&quot; said Luke, a little confused. Had he really drunk the whole thing that fast? <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been sipping it the whole time man,&quot; said Charlie, &quot;but I can&#39;t blame you. You look like a growing guy, just like us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke rolled his eyes, and took another slurp of the shake, trying to get the last of the cream. &quot;I guess so,&quot; he said, &quot;although I don&#39;t think I&#39;m getting any taller.&quot; The other guys all laughed, although Luke didn&#39;t think he&#39;d been that funny. Then again, it was nice to finally be interacting with other dudes. He didn&#39;t feel lonely any more.<br />
<br />
Luke felt pretty full now. In fact, maybe a little too full. He noticed his belt was digging into his stomach, something he couldn&#39;t remember happening since the Thanksgiving when his parents had invited another family over and they&#39;d all eaten way too much. Luke tried to surreptitiously loosen his belt, scooting closer to the table and fumbling with his buckle. The buckle scraped on the table though, which made Isaac glance over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, eat too much there buddy? It&#39;s cool, we&#39;ve all been there. Loosen it up if you need to.&quot; Luke was embarrassed all over again, but then heard his stomach gurgle and felt his belt tight against it. He went ahead and flipped his buckle open: so much better!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we all remember the Freshman 15,&quot; laughed Isaac, who patted his belly. &quot;It&#39;s just the start dude: the food here really makes you pack on the pounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been working out though,&quot; said Luke, &quot;Plus I&#39;ve always been skinny. My high school track coach always wanted me to gain some more muscles in my legs but just stayed thin the whole time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem to be be making some, um, progress&quot; said Johan, who smirked and glanced down at Luke&#39;s waistline. Luke laughed and grabbed his stomach, but was startled to feel, not the washboard abs he&#39;d always had, but rather the beginning of a small belly. Looking down, he saw his shirt was pulled tighter round his middle than he&#39;d ever seen it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, that shake really filled me up,&quot; said Luke. Suddenly he felt additional pressure in his gut, and without being able to stop he let out a loud belch.<br />
<br />
Far from being grossed out, as Luke himself was, the three other guys started laughing. &quot;Nice dude,&quot; said Isaac, &quot;that was a good one!&quot; I guess he&#39;s right, Luke thought: it had felt good, and boy it had been loud. He&#39;d never burped like that in front of anyone before.<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s stomach began to feel pressure on it again, even though he&#39;d loosened his belt. Not worrying any more about what the other guys thought, he reached one hand under his shirt and felt his waistline. His stomach had really ballooned! His belly - he&#39;d never had a belly in his life - felt full and taut. Damn I probably look as chubby as Isaac right now, he found himself thinking. He shifted in his seat, and then felt another new sensation. His shorts didn&#39;t just feel tight around his waist, but around his butt and thighs too.  He squirmed uncomfortably, and felt the seams the seat or his pants stretch just a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, I think I ate too much. I--burrrp&quot; Luke clapped his hands over his mouth too late to stop the second uncontrollable belch. That shake must&#39;ve had something in it that was disagreeing with him. The other guys laughed once again, and Charlie clapped him on the shoulder. &quot;No worries dude,&quot; he said, &quot;just let it out, we&#39;re all big guys here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Big?&quot; thought Luke, &quot;But I&#39;m not big. I&#39;m just full is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Isaac, following up Charlie&#39;s comforting words, &quot;I bet you&#39;re just wearing clothes that are too tight. What are you, size 34 pants right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;30!&quot; said Luke, indignant. He&#39;d been size 30 since he was 16.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not anymore you&#39;re not - trust me. College does stuff to you: I&#39;d say you&#39;re a 34 easy&quot; Johan eyed Luke&#39;s waist, &quot;maybe even a 36 like me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just full,&quot; protested Luke, but reaching down he could feel that his shorts were indeed much too tight. Suddenly, one of the seams on his shorts couldn&#39;t take any more, and he felt the seat of his pants rip, right there as he was sitting. The tearing sound was audible, and the guys laughed again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, you must have been wearing totally the wrong pants Luke!&quot; said Charlie. Luke was stunned, but at the same time felt some relief: he no longer felt that pressure in his thighs and but from his shorts becoming too tight. &quot;Here,&quot; continued Charlie, reaching into his backpack under the table, &quot;I&#39;ve got an extra pair of athletic shorts. Just slip them on, no one will notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is bizarre, thought Luke. Thank god these guys were friendly. He glanced down at the XL mesh shorts that Charlie had handed to him. Well I&#39;ll be swimming in these but it&#39;s better than having to get up from the table with a big hole in my pants. Luke tried to lean down to remove the remains of his old shorts, but then felt his gut press up against himself. He was so full that he couldn&#39;t bend over properly! It was as if in just the last few minutes, he&#39;d become just as fat as the other guys sitting at the table around him.<br />
<br />
He bent over again, feeling his skin touching against itself in new ways as his fat belly was compressed between his thighs and his chest. He was passed worrying about how he looked in front of the other guys, and finally managed to kick off his old shorts and slide the newly borrowed pair up. Far from being too large, this pair seemed to fit great. He stood up slightly in his seat, pulling them back around the cover his exposed boxers. Then he felt something that made him catch his breath.<br />
<br />
He stopped and sat down heavily, beginning to freak out. The curve of his own ass felt unfamiliar: much rounder than before. His stomach could be explained, maybe, by his big meal and that amazing milkshake. But his ass! How could it be so big? In fact, even within the much larger shorts, he was beginning to feel the elastic band of his boxers becoming too tight. He needed to get out of here and figure out what was going wrong. These guys had been so nice, he didn&#39;t like to run out on them just when he thought he&#39;d made some friends.<br />
<br />
Then he felt a hand on his shoulder and he looked up to see Steve from the counter, standing right next to him. His apron was off now, and sitting down, Luke was right at eye level with the guy&#39;s belly. His shirt was a little too small, exposing some belly hair and the love handles Luke had seen earlier. Steve&#39;s hand was big and felt warm against Luke&#39;s shoulder. Suddenly Luke felt his dick starting to harden. What was going on? It was as if he were attracted to this guy! This big chubby guy who worked at a late night cafe - how could that be!<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you found my friends&quot; said Steve, and the other guys smiled and nodded up at him. &quot;How did you enjoy that shake man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I . . .&quot; Luke was stuck for words. His dick was now fully hard, and he was sure it was tenting the front of his thin borrowed shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, I actually brought you another,&quot; said Steve, setting down another milkshake in front of Luke. &quot;Drink up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke found himself wanting to do what this guy, to whom he was inexplicably attracted, said. He reached for the milkshake, and began slurping it down.<br />
<br />
Now, the changes Luke experienced didn&#39;t occur nearly so slowly. With each gulp of the shake, his body changed, filling out, packing on weight. Slurp: his belly rounded out into a full beer gut. Slurp: his pecs bulged and then sagged a bit, visibly pushing out in his t-shirt. Slurp: he had to adjust himself again in his seat to make up for his increasingly padded ass. Slurp: he felt his face rounding out, his jawline filling and cheeks becoming rounder. With each of these changes, Luke found himself caring less. He felt good, and looking up at the smiling Steve, he found himself even feeling excited.<br />
<br />
When Luke finished his shake, there was no one that could deny that he had become a fat kid. Despite his height, he was carrying a good 220 pounds on his frame, seemingly a lot in his round belly and full ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guys,&quot; said Luke, his voice sounding thicker and a little lower than he was used to, &quot;I think I got fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the club man&quot; said Steve, who winked again. The other guys all grinned. &quot;Although now you&#39;ve put on that college weight, you might need to find some new clothes. Why don&#39;t you come back to my place and we&#39;ll find something that looks good on you.&quot; Luke felt his dick twitch again, now hard enough that it was pushing into his newly bloated beer gut, and knew that whatever happened next, he&#39;d found his new place to fit in.</p>
