<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Turned out Ken&#39;s physique was a lot more compact and condensed than one may have thought. It wasn&#39;t Ant-man strength of having a normal man&#39;s power but with reduced mass, but he could jump a foot in the air or about 6 times his height, and he seemed to have proportional strength of an ant... or something. He could move around most objects a small child could at least, and after having a textbook accidentally fall ontop of him Ken figured out he was more durable... or at least squishier as he came out without really any notable injuries, and Ken didn&#39;t want to experiment more on that front. While Ken was learning what had been named &quot;Mage hand&quot; and &quot;Jump&quot; his sister Steph was looking at some of the spells the agents had recommended. <br />
In general the government classified spells under 3 categories. &quot;Public&quot; were spells that had low magic radiation and wouldn&#39;t disrupt the peace that much, &quot;Personal&quot; tended to be spells with moderate magical radiation or would generally cause panic or disturbances to the public, and then &quot;banned&quot; spells were well banned. Usually they had large amounts of magical radiation, could be highly dangerous or disruptive... or a special interest said no. usually you could sling &quot;public&quot; spells around willy nilly assuming you weren&#39;t using them nefariously, &quot;personal&quot; spells you used in private or on willing people or willy nilly assuming you weren&#39;t used them right, and &quot;banned&quot; spells were just banned by the government... I mean feel free to use them if your smart about it, but if an officer catches you it could land you in a lot of hot water. &quot;Mage Hand&quot; was a public use spell that was effectively a visible telekinesis, and &quot;Jump&quot; was technically a private spell used just for parkour courses or special uses... but in Ken&#39;s case the agents okayed it since it would be very useful for Ken to Jump possibly ten times his normal jumping height, and since his normal jumping height was a foot... ten feet would help him get to desks and the like would also help, and with some calculations the agents had determined Ken probably couldn&#39;t hurt himself that badly from dropping a couple of feet. <br />
<br />
While Ken was figuring out &quot;Mage Hand&quot; didn&#39;t work as a floating platform for him Steph said &quot;Let&#39;s see there&#39;s Tether, another personal spell that scaled down could let you be like spiderman.&quot; Steph suggested<br />
&quot;sounds good, mage hand&#39;ll be useful but if it can get me off the walkways I&#39;ll take it.&quot;<br />
&quot;OOO, how about change sex?&quot; Steph said teasingly<br />
Ken blushed and said &quot;No, I&#39;m not... I&#39;m comfortable as a guy.&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, can you say you aren&#39;t curious? It says here from the agent they recommend in this female dominate household... Also I could imagine this make you a decent amount of money...&quot;<br />
&quot;More concerned about my quality of life right now first.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or are you sure you wouldn&#39;t rather... huh...&quot; Steph muttered &quot;I think Agent 2 may have a thing or something, there&#39;s a number of transformative spells... a few banned ones but with a few notes saying if no one catches you right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Could you just send over that Tether spell?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken was on his pillow through the night after having learned &quot;Tether&quot; as he went through a number of those spells that Agent 2 had recommended. Change Sex was somewhat complicated that Ken was half tempted to learn and use twice and then probably never again... Then there were Shrink and Enlarge... Spells that were nearly on the verge of being banned outright and the ones suggested had a limited duration baked in.... Then there were a lot of random cosmetic spells and then... animal based ones. Eagle Eye, Gorilla Arms, Aquatic Adaptation sounded circumstantially useful... Cow&#39;s blessing sounded more like fetish bait 99% of the time... and the worst part was... Ken half felt like he may as well learn them at some point. <br />
&quot;Mage&#39;s Hand&quot; was complicated. You created a construct of specific proportions and size and then had to learn how to manipulate it in every way a hand could be manipulated before the spell was learned and castable. &quot;Jump&quot; was uncomplicated as it was just charging your feet with power to let you leap farther, but he learned &quot;Jump&quot; a whole lot quicker than he felt he should. &quot;Tether&quot; was similarly complicated to &quot;Mage Hand&quot; but Ken learned that significantly faster. Ken imagined this was like learning a second language. It was hard at first, but once you learned the grammar and the like... It got a lot easier. Ken remembered on T.V. a reality show that was just through it&#39;s first season about monsters and how in general there seemed to be 3 types of monsterized people. Those in Denial who kept trying to be human which was easier for some than others, Then there were those who embraced their monster side and their natural abilities/magics, and then there were the mages... Those that may use some of their monster abilities, but mainly used magic for almost everything. Flinging cantrips for minor inconveniences and seemingly having learned thousands of spells for the most niche of tasks... Ken wondered if he was closer to the third if he was actually considering learning all those fetish spells just because he would have a low opportunity cost in learning them, and they MAY come in handy in some way somehow. Ken&#39;s hand wavered to the spells he could potentially learn and told himself just ONE MORE SPELL... Then sleep... Just that Reduce spell...</p>
