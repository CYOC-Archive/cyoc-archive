<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Some time later you slowly begin to wake up, remembering the events of earlier as though they were an amazing, sexy, dream. Because they must have been, right? There&#39;s no way there&#39;s such thing as a magical flashlight that can change genders and reality. Then again, it felt so real, the way your boyfriend was giving you a blowjob in that dream has your clit sensitive enough that when your boyfriend reaches around in his sleep to brush his fingers against it you shudder. It feels so big, so... You freeze when you feel his fingers close loosely around it as he gives you a few sleepy strokes before falling back into a deeper sleep, his fingers still wrapped loosely around your...cock. It was real!<br />
<br />
Your mind replays the events of earlier, the way he acted like you having a cock was the most natural thing in the world, how enthusiastic he was to suck you off, how good it felt and how different the whole experience was. The only thing that was even a bit of a disappointment was how little sensation you got from your nipples after using the blue setting on your breasts. Well, it was fun, but now that you&#39;re awake you figure it&#39;s best to change things back to normal.<br />
<br />
Careful, so as not to wake your boyfriend up, you reach for your purse and carefully remove the flashlight. You decide that you want to handle this while your boyfriend is asleep just in case. Pushing the sheets off your chest you set the light to a medium pink setting and let the light wash over it. First the slight hint of muscle softens, then your nipples grow darker, perking up as puffy little breasts bud beneath them. Your cock twitches at how good it feels to have breasts again, the way your nipples are tingling as your breasts swell into an a-cup and then a b-cup, back to the way they were, then you turn the light off to catch your breath. At the moment you&#39;re an ordinary enough looking girl, except for your slightly small, uncircumcised cock and balls. You push the sheets down further to look at said anatomy,<br />
<br />
Your cock is half hard, about four inches long at the moment, the tip of the head just showing past the foreskin, beneath it you can see your balls, with their fine dusting of hairs they look almost delicate, especially when you consider the hairy, weighty orbs that your boyfriend possesses. For lack of a better way of thinking about it, your new anatomy looks feminine to you, if a cock and balls could be considered feminine. Maybe, you think, it&#39;s the foreskin, you&#39;re so used to circumcised guys that with yours being the first unaltered cock you&#39;ve seen you&#39;ve decided it to be feminine because it&#39;s yours. Either way, you realize that you like it and that maybe you&#39;ll keep it for a little longer, especially considering the blowjob your boyfriend gave you. Now that&#39;s something you could get used to, the only downside being that his cock is too big for you to properly return the favor. You look at the flashlight in your hand and realize that there&#39;s a way to fix that.<br />
<br />
Carefully disentangling yourself from the bed sheets and your boyfriend&#39;s arms you turn the light to a low blue setting and shine it on his cock and balls. Before your very eyes his cock shrinks by half an inch despite already being flaccid. The hair around it also lightens in color and thins out a bit. Still not sure if you could handle his cock when fully erect you turn the intensity of the light lower and watch as his cock starts to shrink again. This time when it stops its flaccid length is three inches, about the same as yours and his pubic hair has been reduced to a fine down. Now his cock and balls almost look kind of cute. That thought, combined with curiosity about how he would act if you had the larger cock and balls, makes you decide to turn down the intensity again. His cock shrinks further still, down to two inches and the hair around it is reduced to a few fine, blond strands. Now it&#39;s positively adorable and you give it one last hit with the light, bringing it down to just over an inch and leaving him completely hairless. That small it looks so suckable that you have a hard time keeping yourself from waking him up with a blowjob. Really, the only thing keeping you from latching your lips around his cock and sucking away is the fact that you don&#39;t like the taste of cum. You look at his tiny little balls, about the size of grapes, and put the light to its lowest blue setting. Careful not to catch his cock in the beam, you shine the light on his balls, watching as they shrink down to the size of marbles. Perfect, you decide, balls that small probably don&#39;t produce much cum at all, and even better, as small as they are, when you give him a blowjob you will be able to easily fit his cock and balls into your mouth. in the past he told you how much he liked it when you licked and sucked his balls, which you found worse than giving him a blowjob because of how hairy they were. Now they&#39;re so small and hairless that you could lick and suck them to his hearts content without a problem.<br />
<br />
Taking a step back you admire your work, only to realize that his reduced anatomy looks out of place on his large, hairy body. Well, you can fix that too. In fact, the idea of him being smaller, maybe smaller than you even is intriguing. How will he act if it&#39;s not just your cock and balls that are bigger? Keeping the light on the lowest blue setting you shine it over him, starting at his feet. The change is both rapid and exciting, his large and hairy feet halving in size and losing all their hair, which you like a lot. Body hair was something you never found attractive. As you bring the light up his legs the hair there vanishes too, in addition his muscle melts away, leaving his legs smooth and soft looking. That&#39;s a bit of a disappointment since you liked how muscular he is, but you decide to continue anyway. Further still, you reach his stomach, his sixpack abs vanishing, before you move on to his chest and watch as the hair there disappears along with his pectoral muscles. He shifts in his sleep, bringing his arms up across his chest and you let the light shine on them as well, watching as his arms become slender, smooth and hairless. More than that, his shoulders grow narrower, leaving him slender and lean, which you decide is a bit hot. At his throat his Adam&#39;s apple disappears, making you wonder what he&#39;ll sound like when he wakes up, then it&#39;s on to his face. You watch as his features soften and smooth out, stubble and sideburns vanishing, leaving him rather boyish looking. <br />
<br />
From where you stand it looks like he&#39;s shrunk about a foot, leaving him around your height. Once he wakes up you&#39;ll be better able to compare heights, but you don&#39;t wake him up just yet. Remembering how much less sensitive your chest was after you shone the blue light on it, you decide to give your boyfriend a little something extra. Putting the light on its lowest pink setting you shine it carefully on his nipples, which promptly turn a pale pink and puff up slightly. They&#39;re barely even buds, but you have the feeling that they&#39;re going to be a lot more sensitive than they were. In fact maybe it will be more fun for you to wake him up by playing with his nipples. As small and delicate as he looks now, you wish that you could do something more about his cock. it&#39;s cute, but you wish you could make it as utterly adorable as the rest of him. Well, you realize, maybe you can...<br />
<br />
Emboldened by everything else you&#39;ve done you keep the light at its lowest pink setting and lean in close, shining it so that it&#39;s at the very base of his cock. This time the change is slow, almost as though more time is needed due to the precise nature of the changes taking place. At first nothing seems to be happening, then you see something, maybe a slight thickening of the skin around the base of his cock. You watch closely, noticing that the already wrinkled skin seems to bunch up a bit more at the base, the wrinkles growing slightly deeper, then the changes flow forward. His cock seems to move lower down between his legs, becoming less prominent as the skin at its base fuses further down on his crotch. If he&#39;d still been able to pee standing up before he certainly won&#39;t now. The skin around the tip of his cock seems to bunch up for a moment, then falls forward, covering his cockhead as his foreskin regrows into something more akin to the hood of a clit.<br />
<br />
You turn the light off, put it back in your purse and step back one last time to admire your work. <br />
<br />
It seems that you&#39;ve finished just in time, because a moment later your boyfriend lets out a small yawn and opens his eyes. He looks at you with a smile and speaks in a soft, voice, slightly high in pitch for a guy, &quot;Wow, you wore me out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You smile back at him, not sure of what to say as he eyes your cock, which until this moment you hadn&#39;t realized was fully hard again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for round two already?&quot; he lets out a laugh and licks his lips.</p>
