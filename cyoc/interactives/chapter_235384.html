<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Labor Day isn&#39;t really recognized outside of the United States, this year&#39;s placement made it the perfect day for people to have one last big three-day weekend at the end of summer. There were many people who planning events to go with this weekend, from trips out of town to big parties in their backyard. Of course, Animalia was having their own celebrations, both community and individual. But most people would have expected the colonies outside of Animalia to get involved.<br />
<br />
Ao Guang Island has quickly gained a reputation of the party island of Heiya Prefecture, and for good reason. While things didn&#39;t escalate into complete debauchery (only moderate, isolated debauchery), it was starting to be considered the Animalian version of Macau. It was unlikely that Ishinowa Island was going to gain such a reputation even when the Turtle Chief&#39;s Palace is fully open as the climate was a little too cold for wearing nothing but swimwear all year long. They were still surveying islands in the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean for the Phoenix Queen and Tiger Lord&#39;s Palaces respectively, but there were promises to find suitable islands and start construction by spring.<br />
<br />
But right now, the staff on Ao Guang Island had arranged a big party for this weekend. This may seem like any other final summer bash, but the invitations were particular. Only Chinese, Japanese, and Korean people were invited, and only those within an age range of 30-60. Sharp-eyed people noticed that the party was being held at one of the more secluded beaches on the island, which could be easily walled off from any casual strollers or uninvited guests. The party was known (in English) as the &#39;Retreat to Beat the Heat&#39;. It had similarly flash names in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, though those didn&#39;t necessarily rhymed. It was also pretty much an open secret that this would be Animalia&#39;s second conversion orgy.<br />
<br />
Behind the beach barrier, several people were given single doses of the Animalia virus to become the Animalian species they wanted to be. By having sex with each other and the unchanged humans, they&#39;d become double-dosed and being restored to their primes. It wouldn&#39;t take too long before there wasn&#39;t a single human left as they all got converted. An observer would notice there were a lot of reptile strains among the party-goers. Part of that was it being the Year of the Dragon, but there were also several snakes. Part of that was a tie-in to next month&#39;s theme, Snektember. This would be the month where those who will be participating for the Year of the Snake competition would begin their training this month. It would also be the latest time where a converted snake could join the competition. Anyone who converts after September would be unable to sign up.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t any real recordings of what happened during the orgy, except for what a few people did with their phones. Though none of those clips were added to the premium page of Animalia&#39;s website, mostly due to legal reasons. And considering how...messy orgies can get, it was probably for the best. However, there was one occurrence that revealed a previously unknown factor.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The black stallion had been a Japanese salaryman a few minutes ago before he received his first dose. Now he was looking around for a suitably exciting partner to get his second dose. He soon noticed a female snake reclining on a beach chair for the moment. She looked like some sort of python, but he wasn&#39;t versed enough in herpetology to know more about what kind besides her being big and having brown patches. He walked over to her and said, &quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled and said, &quot;I&#39;m just resting between fucks.&quot; She spoke Japanese though with a Korean accent. It was fortunate that so many people at this party were multilingual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ready for another then?&quot; asked the stallion, stroking his cock, &quot;Because I need another dose and I&#39;d like to, as Americans might say, bury this snake in your snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
The python raised an eyebrow and said, &quot;Feeling confident, are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the first time I can imagine,&quot; said the stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I think I&#39;m ready then,&quot; said the python before getting off her chair and uncoiling on the sand.<br />
<br />
The stallion grinned before crouching over her. He was inserting his cock into her when he felt some resistance. &quot;It feels like there&#39;s something already in there,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; said the python. With a little effort, a pair of hemipenises emerged from the cloaca and moved out of the way. &quot;I guess it&#39;s not obvious I&#39;m a herm at first,&quot; said the python, &quot;Is that a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not today,&quot; said the stallion as he slid more freely, &quot;As long as this isn&#39;t your asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way the python was moaning, he was doing a good job. It was a little odd for hir penises to be poking his stomach, but he could ignore that. He could feel a tingle through his body which he assumed meant he was getting his second dose and going to his full prime. He certainly felt more energy going through him. And yet, something seemed a bit wrong. He had a strange feeling in his guts that didn&#39;t seem to be hunger or nausea. Looking down, he noticed his chest looked rounder. He wasn&#39;t top shape when he was human, but he wasn&#39;t that fat. In fact, his chest seemed to be getting rounder as he went. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked, suddenly conscious of a hitch in his voice.<br />
<br />
The python looked up and noticed the shape of the stallion had changed, his shoulders getting a bit narrower, his waist getting more concave. But more obviously was the new mass building up on his chest. &quot;Are you going breasts?&quot; shi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not possible!&quot; snapped the stallion, though his voice was noticeably higher and not just because of how freaked out he was feeling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re getting your second dose and my virus is still active,&quot; said the python.<br />
<br />
&quot;But that shouldn&#39;t mean-&quot; started the stallion before gasping. The flesh between his asshole and his scrotum suddenly became very sensitive. A cleft formed before deepening, tunneling inwards to connect to the new womb inside hir. This new pressure on hir prostrate caused hir to fire inside the python. The herm-snake hissed with pleasure as the sudden flood of horse batter pushed hir far enough to climax.<br />
<br />
Shi pulled out of the python, but the damage was already done. The stallion was clearly now part-mare, hir large breasts, wider hips, and round ass were undeniable for all to see. The herm-horse felt hir new boobs and said, &quot;I&#39;m a mare now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not totally,&quot; said the python, stroking the still-erect cock that hung between the new herm&#39;s legs, &quot;I&#39;m sorry this happened. I didn&#39;t know it could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a bigger surprise for me,&quot; said the stallion-mare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; asked the python.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I&#39;m not feeling bad,&quot; said the horse, &quot;Maybe I&#39;m just in shock now, but I don&#39;t feel...upset about it, yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not so bad being a herm,&quot; said the python, &quot;There&#39;s a lot to enjoy about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what?&quot; asked the horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;For one thing, I can repay the favor,&quot; said the python. Shi coiled hir tail around the horse&#39;s legs before shi angled hirself around. With a little probing, shi was able to slide hir dick&#39;s into the new mare vagina behind the stallion balls. The horse let out a moan which turned into a surprised whinny when the python hugged hir from behind and hir long neck looped around to start sucking on the horse&#39;s new breasts. The horse was not ready for this level of pleasure and found hirself really liking it.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
After the orgy, Horizon scientists were able to do some tests with basic fluid samples. It seems that when a single-dosed Animalian receives a second dose, their DNA enters enough flux to accept new genes, including the hermaphrodite chromosomes. It was unclear if other modifications like the four-armed gene could be added this way, but the herm gene was definitely universally adaptable enough to be applied to anything.<br />
<br />
This new discovery prompted Horizon Labs to issue some warnings to make sure an unintended conversion like this wouldn&#39;t happen again. Though the likelihood was rather remote as most people who want to become herms typically do so with their first dose and most people wouldn&#39;t choose to double-dose that way. The herm horse now calling hirself Shun was fully compensated and was given as much support as shi needed to getting accustomed to hir new sex. Fortunately, shi seems to be adjusting rather well.</p>
