<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tammy trundled down the stairs of the Strasserman home, feeling her curves jiggling with each step and being confused by the conflicting feelings in her head, which was itself feeling rather strange and foggy after Brianna had made her wish. On the one hand the jiggling felt normal, the soft sloshing of her bulging breasts and tummy as they jiggled with motion, but on the other hand part of Tammy&#39;s brain was telling her that it was wrong. Sure, she&#39;d been overweight when they&#39;d ended up in the future, but not this much...<br />
<br />
&#39;And what did we wish for anyway? Did we, um, want to see how we&#39;d look as old people?&#39; The former jock turned middle aged wife turned cute geek turned thick chick thought, scratching her curly blond head as she stepped down off the stairs and followed the twin immense bulks of Brianna and Gloria into the kitchen. The kitchen itself was drastically different than Tammy remembered it being; before it had been very clean and orderly, almost the perfect model of a suburban home but now it was almost the exact opposite. Jars of sweets lined the counter while a stack of dirty dishes sat in the sink. Unopened bottles of soda were stored next to the fridge and bags of chips and other junk food lay within easy reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; Gloria whined as she followed her friend Brianna into the kitchen. She&#39;d thought that maybe the other large girl had just been hungry upstairs and it had just reminded her that it had been a whole twenty minutes since she&#39;d last eaten breakfast at the Strasserman residence, the plate full of eggs and bacon and pancakes that Brianna&#39;s mom and sister always had ready for when her dad would drop her off on his way to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too&quot; Brianna replied, the notion of being hungry had derailed her own train of thought and she paused along with Gloria to start grazing from the readily available junk foods, but a loud honk from the garage proved enough of a distraction. &quot;But...Willow is supposed to be somewhere to do...something. She&#39;ll get in a lot of trouble if she doesn&#39;t do it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m starving! Gloria said, stamping massive cankle on the ground and shaking the room, &quot;I wanna eat something!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm...Oh!&quot; Brianna turned in a slow circle as her piggy eyes scanned her favorite room in the house. There had to be something they could eat quickly...And that was when she saw the brightly colored packaging from a carton of chocolate chip cookies partly buried under a potato chip bag. &quot;Let&#39;s take these&quot; She said, batting the bag of chips away with a puffy hand and picking the carton up to show Gloria. The boy turned old man turned dumb fat girl felt proud of herself for coming up with such a solution, but the small grin on her face died as she saw Gloria stare at the package of cookies in disappointment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just that one?&quot; Gloria said, her already squished face scrunching up into as fierce a pout as she could manage. It was so small! And if there was only one she&#39;d have to share!<br />
<br />
&quot;We might have more...&quot; Brianna started as she stared off into the expanse of the kitchen once more. In truth she didn&#39;t even want to go to school anymore, she just wanted to stay home and snack now. Maybe take a nap after. She started to drift further into the kitchen, ignoring the second honk of Willow&#39;s car horn from the other side of the nearby garage door, but through her layers of shoulder fat she felt a hand give her a squeeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, we really need to get to school girls. C&#39;mon!&quot; Tammy clasped another hand on the even larger hump of Gloria&#39;s flabby shoulder and tried her best to move the two human boulders along with little success.<br />
<br />
&#39;OMG&#39; Was all she could think as the two girls stood there staring at her with dull eyes before a third honk decided the vote. With slow, ponderous movements Brianna and Gloria turned once more towards the garage door and waddled towards it, opening the door and sliding partially sideways through it and into the garage. Tammy just let loose a sigh of relief as she closed the door behind them. They just needed to get to school and then Tammy could focus on seeing her boyfrien-<br />
<br />
&#39;No, focus! You have to figure out how to use the wishing rock!&#39; She kicked herself again, giving the tiny bulge in her shorts pocket a pat as she turned towards the waiting vehicle, her eyes widening once more as one memory betrayed another in her mind. But this time, at least, she knew which one was the real memory.<br />
<br />
There, sitting in the middle of the garage and looking very much worse for wear, was Willow&#39;s large faded purple van. Tammy knew this was wrong because before the wish (whatever it had been) had done whatever it did, Willow had had a almost brand new red sedan. And Tammy&#39;s eyes went even wider as she saw Willow glaring at the three of them from the driver&#39;s seat. Instead of the skinny, healthy and kind looking Willow that Tammy clearly remembered there was now another overweight (Though not as much as Brianna, Gloria or even Tammy herself) girl that clearly looked like she didn&#39;t care for her appearance and was getting very little sleep. Another fake but real memory floated to the surface of Tammy&#39;s mind; Willow was very much her sister&#39;s keeper. Her parents relied on the older girl to babysit Brianna and by extension, Gloria. She had to help her mother fix them breakfast, had to get them to school, help with what little homework they had on top of her own schoolwork. The stress of being a caretaker and essentially a second mom had clearly taken a toll.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon! Tammy, you were supposed to have them out here twenty minutes ago! What fucking gives? I CAN&#39;T miss my test and it takes thirty minutes to get to the college!&quot; Willow barked at the tubby trio, her voice hard and angry and utterly different from what Tammy knew it should be. &quot;Quick, get your butts in here and...&quot; Willow trailed off as she spotted the package of cookies in her little sister&#39;s bloated hand, &quot;Christ, again Bri? How can you be hungry again after everything you had for breakfast!?&quot;<br />
<br />
After a few moments Brianna just shrugged and moved to open the sliding door of the van, revealing an interior that was even worse than the exterior. Instead of a mid-sized middle seat and a long rear passenger area, instead there were two large, clearly not factory standard, chairs bolted into the floor of the van. The vehicles shook and shuddered and began to noticeably sag as Brianna and Gloria pulled themselves up into the van with no small shortage of feminine grunts from the obese dullards until finally both girls had settled into their cradles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a cookie&quot; Gloria snapped, pawing at her friend who quickly unsealed the package as Tammy simply stood there and watched as sausage like fingers began plucking the small discs of cooked dough and chocolate chips out with frightening speeds. In a matter of moments the carton was empty as Brianna let it fall to the floor of the van as she and Gloria messily devoured their snack.<br />
<br />
And Tammy suddenly felt a little upset the two girls hadn&#39;t at least offered her one. With all the confusion she was feeling a cookie might have helped ease her befuddled mind (and soothe the small hunger pang she suddenly felt).<br />
<br />
&quot;Rear in gear, Tammy! Don&#39;t make me leave you!&quot; Willow barked once more, shaking the curvy blonde out of her thoughts again and Tammy wasted no time in getting into the front passenger seat. &quot;Jesus&quot; Willow said as she put the clearly long suffering van into drive and rolled out of the Stasserman garage and into the spring rainstorm that had developed over Shermer.<br />
<br />
The drive to the school was rather short. In truth Tammy, Brianna and Gloria could have walked it and Tammy sometimes did, but her other friends clearly wouldn&#39;t have made it more than a hundred feet down the sidewalk without needing to stop every few steps. As Gloria and Brianna let out several burps from the back seats, Tammy looked out the window while a hand went to rest on the bulge in her pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to fix this. I&#39;ll figure out what went wrong and fix it. I promise Bri...I mean Bill!&#39; Tammy thought as the van rolled down the street. She&#39;d always forgotten that Brianna wasn&#39;t supposed to be Brianna and was instead a guy named Bill. And Bill was very important to Tammy, maybe even the most important, but for why, much like Willow, Tammy was having a hell of a time figuring out.<br />
<br />
She turned away from the window and looked over at the frustrated face of Willow, who was clearly annoyed with her. Tammy knew that asking a question was a bad idea but maybe Willow knew something, anything, that could help her figure out what went wrong with their wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, um, Willow...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, WHAT, Tammy!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did....did I ever used to be so ditzy like this? Or have I always been like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Willow simply gave her friend an annoyed look before turning back to the road. Before long the van full of girls arrived at Shermer High, though not at the front doors. No, Brianna and Gloria spent most of the day in remedial class, and their presence in the halls of the school were someplace that the girls simply wouldn&#39;t survive as kid upon kid would crack their usual jokes. Instead Willow pulled around to the back of the school, near the doors to the girl&#39;s gym. It was what was best for the girls, after all. As the trio piled out of the van Tammy could feel as well as see the reinforced automobile raise dramatically back up to it&#39;s factory standard ground clearance. The moment the passenger door slammed shut the van whirled to life again with a blast of carbon out of the poorly attached tail pipe as Willow took off angrily from the school and headed to her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go home now??&quot; Gloria asked as they watched the purple van speed down the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now Gloria, you know we all have to, like, go to school. It&#39;s the, um, law and stuff&quot; Tammy felt herself saying as she turned to head into the gym doors. But she gasped in surprise as she broke into a huge grin as she saw someone waiting for them.<br />
<br />
It was her boyfriend, Rob Bolstrum!</p>
