<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while, Ken decides that he’ll throw a party, the teen grins evilly, “hehe… I could invite my family, Jeff’s family, our friends… I could say that, who likes can come in costume,” he says to himself. Ken smirks, “knowing some of our friends, Jeff’s siblings and mine, THEY most certainly will turn up in a costume,” he says, “hehe… with the Chronivac… it will be a party no one will ever forget, I know I won’t!”<br />
<br />
So, Ken heads up to the fourth floor where his office is located, he turns on the Laptop and starts to type the invitation. Once finished, Ken opens his E-Mail account and sends the invitation to the people, “now, I should use the Chronivac to make me wealthy,” he says, he opens the App and selects his file. Ken had scanned himself earlier, just in case he decides to change something about himself. The teen selects his bank account and frowns at the amount of cash he has: 100 $! Ken grins, “let’s add a few zeros to that number,” so, Ken adds seven zeros to the 100 $, making it: 1.000.000.000 $!<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “now, I do not have to worry about money for a looooooong time,” he says, “I guess I should get some shopping done, before the guests arrive! But… first… I’d need a car… hmm… let’s see!”<br />
<br />
The teen opens the browser on his Gaming Laptop, which also had been created out of Jeff, but Jeff has no control over the Laptop. Ken types “list of SUV” into the search engine, he soon finds the perfect car: an Cadillac Escalade V 2023!<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “perfect,” he says, “I know I could just buy one, but… I’m in the mood of transforming someone into my first car! But who should I choose?”<br />
<br />
The teen leans back in the chair, he then hears noise coming from the outside, Ken walks over to the window and peers out. He grins when he spots two young boys playing some soccer in the street, “perfect,” he say to himself, “I can transform one of them into the Escalade… the other I could transform into a nice statute for my front yard, or a tree, or a hedge, or maybe a cute inflatable Fox pool toy… hm… or a Dolphin pool toy… I’ll think of something. First I got to get the kids into the House… and I know how,” he grins as he hurries down the stairs and out the front door.<br />
<br />
As Ken walks down the front path towards the gate, he takes out his phone and opens the App, grinning he scans the two boys, he then opens the gate, “hey,” he says, the two boys turn to look at him, “I just moved here, and wondered if you two would like to see my house?”<br />
<br />
The two boys look at each other, then at Ken, “that depends,” they say, both sounding like the typical “snob”, “have you got anything cool in that house of yours?”<br />
<br />
“Well, I have an indoor Cinema, Pool, Arcade, and other entertainments,” Ken says.<br />
<br />
“You got us on “Arcade”,” one boy says, “our parents never let us play stuff like that”.<br />
<br />
“Then follow me, boys,” Ken says, “my name is Ken, by the way”.<br />
<br />
“My name is Archie,” one boy says, he has short blond hair, freckles in his face and an athletic body.<br />
<br />
“My name is Charlie,” the other boy says, this boy has brown hair that reaches just below his ears, an olive skin tone and like Archie an athletic body.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles at the two boys, who seem to be not older than 12, maybe 13, “it is nice to meet you,” he says. ‘I think Archie will do nicely as my Escalade,’ he thinks to himself, ‘and Charlie will make a great fountain for my front yard’. Ken leads the boys into the “House” and then down to the basement, he shows them the Arcade area with the slot machines and hands each a handful of tokens, “here, have fun,” he says, smiling.<br />
<br />
The two boys waste no time and rush to the machines, as they start to play, they don’t notice Ken pulling out his phone, a evil grin on his face. First, Ken selects Archie, he types in a command into the mind field and saves it.<br />
<br />
Archie turns to his friend, “I got to go,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Charlie says, not really paying attention, “okay”.<br />
<br />
Ken grins when he watches Archie leave, knowing very well where the boy is heading to, ‘now for Charlie,’ he thinks to himself. He opens the boy&#39;s file and starts editing, after saving, Ken leans waits.<br />
<br />
Charlie stops playing the game, the boy then starts to strip out of his clothes and starts to walk out of the room, Ken follows.<br />
<br />
“Where are you going, Charlie,” Ken asks.<br />
<br />
“To the garden of course,” Charlie says over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, knowing very well why the boy is saying this, “I see,” he says, “any reason?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Charlie says, opening the front door and stepping outside, luckily there no one is out and about to witness the naked 13 year-old. The boy walks halfway down the path, he then steps onto the grass, “this is where I belong,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff, who is witnessing everything, is horrified when he feels his watering system, which controls the sprinklers of the front yard, get an additional pipe. The pipe moves right up underneath the young boy. Ken smirks when he sees the end of the pipe sticking out of the ground and continuing to move upwards towards Charlie&#39;s butt.<br />
<br />
Charlie lets out a moan when he feels something enter his butt, causing his cock to erect, the boy&#39;s skin slowly takes on the appearance of white marble. His feet and legs merge together, his feet expand and form a bowl around the boy&#39;s pilar. The boy&#39;s erect penis detaches itself from the boy&#39;s marble body, as the boy&#39;s hips widen and become the platform of the pilar. Charlie&#39;s cock, which is lying beside Charlie, changes into a vase, leaving the boy genderles, water starts to pour from the opening and fill the bowl of the fountain. Charlie&#39;s chest puffs out, forming two nice B-cup breasts, a dress materializes, covering the naked girl&#39;s body, finally, the former boy&#39;s face takes on a more feminine appearance, as his hair grows a little longer and pull back into a bride.<br />
<br />
Ken smirks, happy with the fountain, “now, time to meet up with my soon-to-be car,” he says and heads straight for the garage.<br />
<br />
When Ken enters the garage he grins when he spots Archie standing motionless in a free parking spot. “How are you feeling Archie,” Ken asks, “like your new home?”<br />
<br />
“It feels better than my former home,” he says, “far more natural”.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “good,” he says, “now, let’s get you out of that stupid human costume”. The teen pulls out his phone and starts to type:<br />
<br />
Vehicle: Car<br />
Make: Cadillac<br />
Model: Escalade V 2023<br />
Color: Aqua-Blue<br />
Target to change: Archie Powers<br />
Duration of Transformation: Permanent<br />
<br />
<br />
Ken smirks as he saves the change, he then watches as Archie starts to undergo the transformation.<br />
<br />
Archie takes off all his clothes, throwing them towards Ken, “here,” he says, “I won’t be needing these anymore”. The boy then gets down on his hands and knees, he then starts to moan, Ken notices that the boy’s body is starting to grow. The boy’s skin takes on a metallic appearance while changing from a white tone to a nice aqua-blue. Archie’s hands and feet start to inflate, becoming big and round, turning black and rubbery. The boy’s body lengthens and widens, doors appear on his sides, his face pushes forward, Archie grins, his grin widens as his mouth becomes the grill of the car. The boy’s eyes merge and become glass, while his eye brows become the wipers, his cock disappears, and reappears as the gear stick while the rest of the interior starts to form inside of Archie. A exhaust pushes out from Archie’s butt, windows appear on his body and front and rear lights appear on his “face” and “butt”. The boy’s voice suddenly dies as a brand new Cadillac Escalade takes his place.<br />
<br />
Ken grins, he picks up the boy’s clothes and heads to the event room, where he collects Charlie’s clothes, then he simply throws the clothes into a trash bin. “Now, time to do the shopping for the party,” he says, “let’s see how well my new car drives”. The teen laughs as he walks to the garage, he looks over at the key rack and grins when he sees that keys have materialized. Ken grabs the keys and unlocks the car, he then gets in and presses a button which opens the garage doors. The teen then carefully drives the car down the driveway and out the gates and starts heading down the street towards the shops.</p>
