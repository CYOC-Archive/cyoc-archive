<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uhhhhh...&quot;  Amelia, not sure how to respond to Kathy&#39;s proposal. &quot;Oh come on, Amelia! This could be our one chance to actually feel what a cow feels! Wouldn&#39;t that be fun? Just spending a day relaxing, eating grass, not having a worry on your mind!&quot; replied the sorceress. They had snuck to the dairy that night since Amelia had lost a bet and now  they were going to transform into whatever Kathy wanted, for as much time as she wanted. Kathy&#39;s family was made up of several magic-users, and Kathy was the 17th generation to pass on the tradition. Kathy met Amelia in high school, and they were best friends ever since. <br />
<br />
&quot;But do we really have to do this now?&quot; asked Amelia. &quot;Hey, you lost the bet, and now you&#39;ve got to transform into what &#120336;  want for the whole week!&quot; replied Kathy. &quot;And I chose for you to be a fat, little cow.&quot;<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to remind me.&quot; Amelia said.<br />
<br />
But seriously, it&#39;s the beginning of summer. Can&#39;t we just spend time going-&quot; said Amelia, getting shushed by Kathy&#39;s finger on her lips. &quot;Another complaint, and I might do something about your transformation.&quot; Kathy said with a smile. &quot;Ugh, fine.&quot; <br />
&quot;Get ready to undress.&quot; Said Kathy. &quot;What, why?&quot; asked Amelia. &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want those sweater and jeans to rip, then you&#39;d undress.&quot; Kathy replied. Amelia started to regret even gambling with Kathy. &quot;At least turn around!&quot; she exclaimed.<br />
<br />
As Amelia undressed, she had mixed thoughts about being turned into a cow. Kathy was excited and couldn&#39;t wait to be turned into one, since cows were her favorite animal anyways. Amelia on the other hand was nervous and embarrassed. When Amelia&#39;s last pieces of clothing got removed, Kathy put them in a neat pile inside a bush, along with her cellphone and glasses. Amelia did the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Amelia, you ready?&quot; Kathy asked, with a grin only comparable to the grinch. &quot;Ready as I&#39;ll ever be, I guess.&quot; Amelia said, blushing. Kathy raised her hands, as purple sparks pulsed out from them. Aura swirled around her body as her fingers slowly reached out, only to touch nothing but the air. She was charging up her magic, until they were ready. As Kathy opened her eyes, she looked at Amelia. &quot;Here it goes.&quot; she said. &quot;Tr&#257;nsførmïo, bovïñiøsis!&quot; She exclaimed, as the rays of light went through Amelia.<br />
<br />
Amelia then felt a pressure coming her breasts, seemingly because they were growing. &quot;Ooooh, the transformation is starting!&quot; exclaimed Kathy. Amelia didn&#39;t say anything, only looking at her breasts as they ballooned out. her breasts seemed to be fusing together, forming one single, giant mass. &quot;Looks like that&#39;s gonna be your udder, Amy!&quot; she giggled. <br />
<br />
 As the mass continued swelling, other body parts started to grow as well. Their hips widened and their legs and arms grew thicker. <br />
A tail began to sprout from her tail bone as the mound grew 2 more nipples and began sliding down the girl&#39;s stomach. As it forced it&#39;s way down there, her genitals stretched and widened, making room for the growing udder as it grew into her crotch area. &quot;OoOoOo, oh god! oh god!&quot; Amelia exclaimed. Amelia&#39;s udder finally stopped, resting peacefully between her hind legs.<br />
<br />
Speaking of her legs, the grew to enormous proportions, as her feet and toes became longer and darker, until they looked exactly like a cow&#39;s hooves. Something that clicked in her hips made her stumble onto the floor, landing on her hands, until she was in an all fours position. Her ribcage thickened as she got fatter and meatier. Her tail finished growing, as  tiny hairs formed on the tip as tinier hairs formed around the base. The hair patterns were starting to look like the traditional holstein cow patterns, with the black and white splotches.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, hair began to form everywhere on her body except for her hooves and udder. As she continued growing, Amelia groaned as her neck and face elongated, forming a muzzle. Horns grew from her head, and her ears elongated, growing longer as her hearing improved dramatically. So did her sense of smell, as her nose flattened out and widened, providing more range to smell with. Her arms gained more muscle mass as it gained through the same transformative process as her hind legs did. Her teeth rearranged themselves for a life more suited to eating grass than anything else. <br />
<br />
As the last few bits of hair finished sprouting, Amelia was basically done with her transformation. Kathy moved closer and pat her head, noticing how much more soft it was due to her fur. &quot;Now, it&#39;s my turn.&quot; Kathy said. &quot;Tr&#257;nsførmïo, bovïñiøsis!&quot; she repeated. This time, the beam of light aimed for herself. Suddenly, she began to shrink. Her limbs slowly getting stubbier, until Amelia could no longer see them as they were being obscured by her clothing. Kathy&#39;s head tucked in as well, covering her face as the transformation was happening. After only a few moments, there was only a small lump inside Kathy&#39;s clothes. <br />
<br />
As the lump wiggled around, Amelia could see a tiny little cow tail sticking out of Kathy&#39;s shirt hole. The thing wiggled around more, and suddenly, out came a nose, and then i tiny little head, as a calf peeked it&#39;s head out of Kathy&#39;s old clothes. &quot;Kathy? Is that you?&quot; Amelia asked. &quot;Of course it&#39;s me!&quot; said Kathy, slowly making her way out of her pile of clothes. Amelia laid down on the ground as Kathy neared her. &quot;Can you still do your magic?&quot; Amelia asked. &quot;Well let&#39;s find out.&quot; Kathy replied. &quot;Expänd&#363;s, Cäpítulüm quíntüm&quot; She chanted, as that same purple light appeared and flowed towards Amelia. The light went right through her udder, as she could feel it expanding. It grew larger until she could barely fit it between her legs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; she said. &quot;What?&quot; Kathy asked. &quot;You&#39;ve always wanted bigger boobs!&quot; she joked. &quot;Yeah, but not like this! I could already feel the milk inside there, I don&#39;t to hold more!&quot; Amelia exclaimed. &quot;Well, there&#39;s nothing I could do now. Besides, the bigger the udder, the more milk you&#39;ll produce for me, your calf.&quot; said Kathy reluctantly. Amelia rolled her eyes. &quot;Now, come one. The farmer&#39;s about to lead the cows back inside the pen for the night. We better be quick for him not to spot us.&quot;<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
When Amelia and Kathy reached the herd of cows, they were just in time, for the farm-hand had just gone out to round up the cattle. As the cattle saw that they were coming, they immediately knew that it was getting dark, and they should start walking to the pen. Amelia saw that they were moving, so she did as well. Kathy stayed close to her, often at her side or near her udder. It was quite uncomfortable walking with a semi-full udder sagging between her legs. Though, it won&#39;t be as saggy for long, since the thing was already filling up with milk. She also hated how her legs constantly rubbed against them. Kathy&#39;s spell made her udder more larger, but it also made it more sensitive. <br />
<br />
As they finally went inside the pens, each individual cow started to lie down on the dirt. Amelia did it as well, seemingly glad that she didn&#39;t have to put up walking with her giant udder anymore. The farm-hand locked the door. As they were doing so, one of them spotted Amelia and Kathy sitting together. &quot;Hey, that one over there has a calf.&quot; The worker said. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we do something about it?&quot; <br />
&quot;I mean, we can just do it tomorrow. Like, what even is going to go wrong?&quot; said the worker beside her. As the farm-hand left, they were finally alone, except for the several dozen cows with them inside the pen. &quot;Better get some sleep, big day tomorrow.&quot; Kathy joked. &quot;I really should stop gambling with you, Kath.&quot; she said, smiling at her, as she laid her head down to the dirt, slowly drifting to sleep.</p>
