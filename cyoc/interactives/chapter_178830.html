<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke, or was he Daniel now, went upstairs once &#39;Luke&#39; left, heading back to his bedroom like he walked that path thousands of times. He knew which one was his right away. He opened the door and wrinkled his nose a little. It was about what would be expected from a teenaged jock though, some exercise stuff strewn about, sports equipment off to one side, dirty laundry just thrown about, and a faint musky smell that one sniff of his own pits told him belonged to him.<br />
<br />
He wanted to think a bit, so he started tidying, gathering at least the dirty laundry into his hamper. Luke had always been on the cleaner side, and while he had Daniel&#39;s body and memories, it was still his brain in here. It made him wonder how &#39;Luke&#39; would act out there. Would he take on his old personality, acting like nothing was weird, would he act with Daniel&#39;s, some blend of the two? He hoped Daniel in his old body wouldn&#39;t mess up his life too much in case he wanted it back. Luke rubbed one of his firm, rounded pecs, fingers brushing over his nipple. If he wanted it back.<br />
<br />
A few more clothes went into the hamper. The room was already looking better. He sat on the side of the bed, reaching for a jock that lay partially under it. As if by instinct his hand brought it up to his nose. He inhaled his own new scent, musky and strong, feeling his cock instantly hardening inside his shorts. This wasn&#39;t something he normally did, but memories told him it was a kink of Daniel&#39;s. Maybe he wasn&#39;t as completely himself in here as he thought.<br />
<br />
He freed his cock from his shorts, smiling down at the more and more familiar sight of the monster he had made for himself. He didn&#39;t know how well hung Daniel had been, but he knew he had been bigger. Besides, at this point it would be a shame to leave this behind. Though he copied it, so his old body had a twin to it. He cupped his balls, thinking he needed to find someone with a big pair of those to really make it impressive.<br />
<br />
He fell back on the bed, taking his swollen manhood into both hands, the jock still on his face. It needed both hands, as he pumped into his fists, inhaling his own musk. This was his body now, young, virile, flooded with teenage hormones. It was so different to how he had been at this age. Though he hadn&#39;t been much older he felt a decade younger. His cock throbbed in his hands, his thrusting spreading pre down his shaft causing it to slip a little in his grip.<br />
<br />
He lost himself in the simple pleasure of it. It wasn&#39;t as good as sex, but he was so horny in this new body it didn&#39;t matter. He thought of plowing his old body, spreading his ass wide on his thick shaft while its twin cock bobbed between &#39;Luke&#39;s&#39; legs. His muscles tensed, he felt his cock throb in his hands, and with a grunt he came, a thick rope of cum arcing through the air and landing on his chest. The next one hit his stomach. As did the third and fourth. The door to his bedroom opened. &quot;Danny..&quot; The fifth dribbled free lethargically and he let his still somewhat stiff cock drop against his stomach. His strong chest heaved from his deep breaths though he stared wide eyed at Mr, Wilkins, no, his dad standing in the doorway.<br />
<br />
Their eyes met and his dad left the room and shut the door behind him. &quot;Well, fuck. First day back as a teen and I get caught jerking it.&quot; He cleaned himself off with a quick trip to the bathroom, then grabbed a tee-shirt and tugged it on, going to face the music. He knew his dad would say something, even if the old man was as much of a horn dog as he knew him to be, he never missed the chance for a lecture.<br />
<br />
He heard him down in the kitchen making himself something to eat and headed down that way. He didn&#39;t say anything as he stepped into the kitchen, instead just reaching into the fridge for a soda. &quot;I have an emergency business trip for a few days. I&#39;ll be back Wednesday.&quot; Lue nodded. He knew his mom was out of town on a girls trip this week as well. &quot;No house parties while I&#39;m gone, you can have friends over, just try not to trash the place, Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure.&quot; Daniel, it was oddly getting harder to think of himself as Luke, nodded. His father narrowed his eyes at him as if expecting a fight. Memories told him he and his father butted heads, a lot. Daniel just shrugged and tried not to look bothered. &quot;We&#39;re not going to talk about..?&quot; His eyes drifted upwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a teenager. I&#39;d be worried if you didn&#39;t do that. So, no..&quot; Did his father&#39;s eyes flick downwards? He had to have caught sight of how big his son&#39;s cock was. It was weird when you knew you were exactly your father&#39;s type, not that his dad would do anything. The senior Wilkins took the sandwich he made for himself and went upstairs to pack, grabbing his dry cleaning out of the front closet. He also knew he&#39;d be seeing his old body sometime in the next couple of days. His dad had a bad habit of sending his assistant around with some excuse to check up on Daniel to make sure he wasn&#39;t doing anything crazy while home alone.<br />
<br />
It was also Saturday night. He knew he had homework to do, but he also knew he could go out with friends and maybe have some fun with the bracelet.</p>
