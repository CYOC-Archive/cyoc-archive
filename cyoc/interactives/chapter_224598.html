<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thousands of years ago, sorcerers used dark magic that has been lost to time. They were experimenting with curses. When one decided to simply curse a regular stone for his own amusement, the stone glowed pink, but before he could see what his creation was capable of, he simply went on his day with the stone left on the earth.<br />
<br />
The stone lay dormant for thousands of years until it was discovered during the American Civil War. A soldier found the stone while he was digging out a trench. He was mesmerised by the glow of the stone, so he quickly touched it and pocketed it, thinking it was a sign from God.<br />
<br />
The soldier carried the stone with him for a week and noticed the stone never lost its glow. The soldier went to sleep that night, unaware that his life would change forever. During the night, he had a wet dream, and when he awoke, he discovered he was a woman.<br />
<br />
None of the other soldiers could quite believe what was going on. There was now a beautiful blonde woman wearing the uniform of one of their friends; the soldier himself couldn’t believe it, but something else that was strange was that the stone had lost its pink glow.<br />
<br />
The soldier sat out the rest of the war and eventually got together with a lonely veteran. On their wedding night, when the newlywed couple first had sex, the soldier turned wife orgasmed for the first time, and in the morning, they woke up as man again. The couple discovered the man was cursed to swap genders every time he orgasmed. They kept the secret of the curse to themselves until they died. The soldier-turned-woman hoped no one else would have to go through such a confusing adventure.<br />
<br />
In the present day, three teens were racing down the empty roads of their town; they were late. Justin, the driver of the car, had his foot down on the pedal, and he and his best friend Kevin had the most important soccer game of their entire lives.<br />
<br />
“We’re so dead if the coach catches us late!” Said the anxious Kevin. The boy had a shaven head with a light black beard that was starting to grow out a little; he was 5’9 with a lean build.<br />
<br />
“WE’RE ALL GONNA BE DEAD, IF YOU DON’T SLOW DOWN JUSTIN,” screamed Kate. The teen girl was Kevin’s girlfriend and the sensible one out of the three, but that wasn’t hard; she had a slim build, and at the height of only 5&#39;2, she had quite a girl next door type of look; she had round glasses and bushy shoulder-length hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, guys; we’re going to get there, and if we die, then we’ll have a killer view of the game from heaven.&quot; Justin was relaxed as usual. The sixteen-year-old boy was a relaxed babyface teen who didn&#39;t have a worry in the world, even though he was moments from being late for the most important game of his soccer career. Oh, and he’s also the captain of the soccer team. Justin is 5’10 with quite an athletic build. His brown, short, curly hair gave him an innocent look, but he could be quite mischievous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, to be fair, I said we shouldn’t binge all of the ‘Killer of Canada’ movies in one night,” Justin said with an ‘I told you so’ grin on his face.<br />
<br />
He was met shortly after with a punch on the shoulder from Kate. “It was Kevin’s dumb idea; why the hell would you watch movies that made you scream like a little girl every five minutes?” Both Justin and Kate broke out into spontaneous laughter at Kevin&#39;s expense.<br />
<br />
The three teenagers have been friends since they were toddlers, and they’ve been inseparable since the third grade, when Kevin and Kate started dating.<br />
<br />
A sigh escaped the lips of Kevin: “We had to watch all five of the movies because ’Killers of Canada’ is coming out next week, and I wasn&#39;t scared. The jump scares caught me off guard, plus at least I wasn’t hard during the nude scene in Put Four!&quot; He nudged his best friend, trying to tease him.<br />
<br />
Kate rolled her eyes while Justin blushed. &quot;Hey, it ain’t my fault; me and some of the other guys on the team haven’t jerked off in a week... It’s supposed to help with the performance in the game.” Justin shook his head. &quot;Hey, let’s not talk about my  bon-.&quot;Before he could finish his sentence, Justin lost control of the car, and the car went off the road.<br />
<br />
Luckily for the teens, they were fine; the car hit something, but it was only small. “Is everyone fine?&quot; Asked Kate as the three teens felt themselves be rushed with adrenaline as they all took several deep breaths.<br />
<br />
“We’re so going to be late.&quot; Kevin had his head in his hands, dreading how he&#39;d explain this whole situation to his strict parents.<br />
<br />
Feeling a little more calm as the adrenaline wore off, Justin got out of the car. “I gotta check for any damage; dad would kill me if this puppy got scratched. He checked the side of the car, but everything looked normal. However, a strange, glowing pink rock was left on the side of the road. Justin picked it up. What the fuck is this, some sort of toy?” he thought to himself, but his thoughts were quickly dashed when he heard someone hit his car  horn.&quot;Dude, we need to go!” Yelled an impatient Kevin, Justin just pocketed the rock and got back in his car.<br />
<br />
Five minutes later, the trio finally made it to the game. “Oh crap, coach looks pissed,” said Justin as he pulled up. The three looked up at the stands. &quot;Crap, my parents are here, and they look more pissed than coach,” squeaked Kevin.<br />
<br />
They got out of the car and started heading to the pitch. &quot;Oh, great, Jenny Ortega is here,” scoffed Kate. Jenny has blonde hair, blue eyes, and an hourglass figure that would make most models jealous. She was quite bitchy, but her money and looks made her the most popular girl in the school.<br />
<br />
The two boys were confused by her presence. “Why is she here? A soccer pitch isn’t the typical scene of a snobby rich kid like her,” said Justin. The two boys also noticed that most of the stands were filled by teen girls; even on a busy day like this, there wouldn’t be this many people here, let alone have the stands almost full.<br />
<br />
“Her and all the other girls are here for one reason,” she pointed at the captain from the opposite team, “Enzo Ferraro.&quot; The Italian-American teen boy was handsome, and that was an understatement. He was six feet tall with long, dark, flowing luscious hair touching his shoulders; he had flawless olive skin with noticeable cheekbones and a strong jawline; and his most captivating feature was his sea blue eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, if you cheated on me with him, I would understand.&quot; Kevin said it dimwittedly before getting elbowed in the ribs by his girlfriend. Justin simply shrugged his shoulders. “He looks normal to me.”<br />
<br />
Kate smirked. &quot;Well, Justin, not every girl is here for Enzo.” She then pointed at Emma, a ginger-haired girl with freckles and emerald green eyes; she was slim and wearing a set of overalls. Her parents were divorced, so Emma lived both on a farm with her dad and next door to Justin, so she had both the farm girl and girl next door vibes: “She’s been looking at you since we got here; please ask her out.”<br />
<br />
Even though Justin was a good-looking guy who was the captain of a school sports team, he was also pretty shy. “I don’t know Kate... I doubt she’s here for me.”<br />
<br />
Kevin jokingly gasped, &quot;Dude, ask her out. You two have clearly liked each other since like the fifth grade,” but before they could get an answer out of Justin, the trio saw that the coach of the soccer team was approaching. and he wasn’t happy.<br />
<br />
“Good luck, you two... You’ll probably need it, Kev. I’ll try to calm your folks down.” Kate kissed her boyfriend before going to the stands and sitting next to Kevin’s parents.<br />
The boys got yelled out by their coach and got a few disappointing looks from their teammates.<br />
<br />
As the game started, a light drizzle of rain fell onto the pitch as a dark cloud approached. As the game went on, the rain got worse, and it got pretty clear that both teams were equally matched as they had the same number of points. Every time Enzo touched the ball, there would be a loud roar from the girls in attendance.<br />
<br />
Before the second half, Justin was accidentally tackled by Enzo, and he fell hard to the floor. “My apologies, my friend. Do you need a hand?&quot; Justin looked up to see Enzo standing over him with his hand out to help Justin up. Justin got up and patted himself off. &quot;Thanks, but no thanks, dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
At the hallway break, it was clear the weather conditions were too rough for the game to continue, so both teams would have to play each other next week.<br />
<br />
Justin was soaking wet and was wondering around the car park looking for Emma, but he couldn’t find her anywhere when suddenly he felt a hand grip his shoulder. He looked at the hand, and it was very familiar; it was Enzo’s &quot;Justin, right? Man, you were good out there!&quot; Said Enzo with a grin on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, he’s tall,” thought Justin as he looked up at Enzo to make eye contact. Justin was a little annoyed because he wanted to find Emma before she left. &quot;Thanks, bro,” Justin said as he rubbed the back of his head.<br />
<br />
Just past Enzo’s shoulder, he saw Emma standing in the car park with an umbrella. “So I was wondering if we could practice; you’re one hell of a player, and I need to improve if I want to go pro.” Enzo was talking, but Justin’s focus was on Emma. &quot;Yeah, sure, swing around my place later,” he said before rushing over to Emma.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the only one who came prepared,” said Justin as he approached Emma, who was completely dry under her umbrella.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Daddy always says, ‘if the cows are sitting down, then it’s going to rain’” She said, both awkwardly smiling at each other, “It’s a farmer thing.”<br />
<br />
The two stood in each other’s presence, feeling shy. “So I was wondering,&quot; they both said in unison. “Go ahead,” said Emma.<br />
<br />
Feeling a little nervous, Justin swallowed hard, trying to find some courage within, but before he could speak, a pickup truck pulled up beside them. &quot;Oh, shoot, that&#39;s my daddy. Erm, I’ll be at my mom&#39;s in the afternoon,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
“Swing around my place so we can talk.&quot; Justin blurted out, and Emma smiled. “I’ll love to,” she said before getting in her pickup with her dad.<br />
<br />
With a goofy big smile on his face, Justin walked back to his car and noticed his friends were sitting in there waiting for him. &quot;Oh, hey guys, I thought you&#39;d be heading back to your place, Kevin.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other teen boy was pale, and he looked like he had gone through a war. “My parents are seriously pissed, and I’m so grounded when I get back home. Can I crash at your place for another night?” Said Kevin.<br />
<br />
A nod of the head was a simple answer: “Of course my parents aren’t back till tomorrow anyway, so you might as well. What about you, Kate?”<br />
<br />
“Of course, I ain’t got nothing better to do, but are you sure you ain’t going to be busy with Emma coming over?” She teased slightly.<br />
<br />
Kevin’s eyes widen. &quot;Woah, you actually spoke to her; how’d it go?” He asked.<br />
<br />
Justin smirked. &quot;Well, I asked her to come around mine so we could chat.” Both of his friends were smiling. “Oh my gosh, I’m so happy for you,” said Kate as she hugged Justin from the back seat.<br />
<br />
“But that’s not all,” Justin continued, “that Enzo guy might come around later as well.&quot; Both Kate and Kevin were confused.<br />
<br />
“What does that guy want?” asked a confused Kevin. Justin sighed. “Something about soccer practice; I don’t even know, I was barely listening, he said as he started the car and began driving to his house.<br />
