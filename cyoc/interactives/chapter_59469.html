<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hammecker Smith kicked a rock and it skittered part way across the creek before hitting something. Gold <br />
glinted back.  Hammecker, whose parents had been big fans of Hammecker Schlemmer &amp; Sharper Image, had heard of <br />
people finding gold nuggets in the river.  He thought, why not also in the creek. So gingerly he hopped from <br />
boulder to rock until he reached the spot where the gold glinted in the sunlight.  He leaned forward and stuck <br />
his hand into the icy water. It was deeper than he thought, he stretched his arm deeper.  He felt his foothold <br />
on the wet rock slipping.  He fell into the water with a splash. His head burst out of the water spitting out <br />
water.  He must have swallowed half a gallon he thought, as he held up the gold object he had sought.  It was <br />
a brass fitting off something. He grimaced and threw it over his shoulder. He waded shivering out of the <br />
creek, and nursing his bloodied knee and elbow. He collapsed on the bank of the creek, his breathing was <br />
irregular.  It was true that Hamm was out of shape, but his exhaustion and shivering wasn't due solely to his <br />
ordeal.  The creek water was contaminated.  The brass fitting he found wasn't the only thing to wash down the <br />
mountain from the hidden secret government lab. Hamm's skin was flushed and clammy.  He felt dizzy, his <br />
stomach churned, all his muscles twitched, and then he passed out.<br />
<br />
Hours later, the sun was low in the sky.  Hamm awoke.  His clothing was dry, and it hung awkwardly on him.  <br />
His shirt seemed too tight around the shoulders, and too loose around his belly.  His trousers fell off him, <br />
when he stood.  His waist had narrowed. He looked down at his handsome naked legs and genitals. They were part <br />
of him, but they didn't look like his had, these were too perfect, too ideal. He ripped open his shirt and <br />
stared at his  now ripped abdomen, and sculpted smooth chest with perfect areolae and pert nipples. His arms <br />
were muscular, his shoulders broad.  He felt different. Something itched mercilessly between Hamm's shoulder <br />
blades.  He reached back to scratch, and painfully pulled out a feather quill and all.  He blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;A feather?&quot; he asked.  He forgot his question astounded by the beautiful voice that came out of his mouth. He <br />
added, &quot;Was that really my voice?  Good heavens it is!&quot; <br />
<br />
The voice was deep, masculine, but not too deep, not too masculine.  It's vibrato was perfect. Every word <br />
seemed to be sung when he spoke. His voice was mesmerizing. He spoke just to hear is own voice. He rambled on <br />
about nothing, until he noticed the shadow cast by his growing wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I dead?&quot; he gasped. &quot;I've got wings like an angel.  Big white wings are growing out of my back.  I wonder <br />
if they work.  Can I fly?&quot;<br />
<br />
He started to run naked as he flapped his wings.  He stumbled and flew about 100 yards before crashing into a <br />
thicket. He got to his feet, and began plucking brambles and thorns out of his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I had some clothing that fit me,&quot; Hamm said, and suddenly, he did.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the?  How did that happen?&quot; <br />
<br />
Hamm reached up and scratched his head.  His short straight hair was now longer, thicker and wavy.  He <br />
couldn't help but smell the hypnotically floral woody scent emanating from his own armpit. He sniffed it, and <br />
found his new and improved cock growing harder.<br />
<br />
What had Hamm become?  What was he becoming?<br />
<br />
He flapped his wings and flew a foot up in the air and hovered there for nearly a minute.<br />
<br />
The chemicals he had been exposed to had not been intended to be used together.  One was a special genetic <br />
retrovirus designed to make the user irresistible sexually.  It had been a bit too effective though.  The <br />
pheromone was so intense that it effected people beyond specific targets.  The night club that an agent <br />
enhanced with the pheromone had turned into a sex orgy due to the poor ventilation and the power of the <br />
pheromone.  The wings had actually been intended for horses.  A government scientist had envisioned soldiers <br />
in the mountains of Afghanistan flying on Pegasus-like stallions to run down Taliban guerillas.  <br />
Unfortunately, the horses they tested the formula on had indeed grown wings, but were incapable of handling <br />
their new ability of flight. The terrified animals flew into canyon walls, and tumbled to their deaths as <br />
their airborne hooves kicked and struggled for the purchase of the ground below them.  So both chemicals had <br />
ended up in barrels of toxic waste that was supposed to be properly disposed of by the staff.  Proper disposal <br />
unfortunately meant, &quot;pour it in the creek.&quot;  There were several different body building agents which had all <br />
proven ineffective separately, when mixed in the creek, they had produced the amazing affects already noted on <br />
Hamm's physique.  <br />
<br />
After several attempts, Hamm was airborne, and gliding down the slopes toward the town below. He discovered <br />
that the psychic drugs had enhanced his mind.  He could hear people's thoughts as he soared toward them.  He <br />
was surprised to hear the jock Thad Brunner lamenting that he couldn't find true love.  That guy had every <br />
girl in town chasing him.  Except, according to Thad's innermost thoughts, they didn't want him - not the <br />
person - they wanted the star quarterback, they wanted the captain of the football team, they wanted the <br />
student body president.  He was all those things, but they didn't define him.  He was more than that.<br />
<br />
Thad was jogging along side the creek. Struggling to fix the flat tire on his bicycle was Darrin Crenna.  His <br />
thoughts were strikingly similar to Thad's.  Oh, he wasn't a jock per se.  No, the girls that went after him <br />
wanted his money - or rather his family's money, or their prestige.  He thought they only saw dollar signs <br />
they didn't see him.<br />
<br />
Hamm soared overhead, neither man looked up to see him. His scent wafted down on them.  Thad found himself <br />
deviating from his planned course.  He left the trail and jogged along the bike path, and there was Darrin.  <br />
Hamm willed Thad to stop to help Darrin, and it worked. Thad stopped.  He helped Darrin. They both were <br />
extremely nervous.  Under Hamm's influence, each young man was suddenly finding the other attractive.  Each <br />
fought their new feelings, Hamm was relentless. The words &quot;true love&quot; haunted the young men's minds. Hamm's <br />
winged shadow passed over them, but neither young man could take their eyes off the other.<br />
<br />
Darrin was wearing his cycling shoes.  He took a step toward Thad with his hand extended to thank him for <br />
helping him fix the tire, and he tripped.  The two went sprawling on the ground. They ended up embracing and <br />
accidentally their lips touched. They kissed. Passion consumed them. Their clothing flew from their bodies. <br />
The two unhappy young men were thrilled, they were elated, Hamm had given them true love.  Oh, yes, they had <br />
both been straight, but Hamm wasn't about to let such a little thing stand in the way of their true happiness, <br />
it was obvious to him that they were soul mates.  So he willed their brains to reconfigure them to being <br />
totally gay.  He was amazed at his own abilities, and pleased with his success.<br />
<br />
Hamm had discovered what he was - he was a love god.  He was Cupid.  He was Eros.  In two days, it would be <br />
Valentine's Day, and he needed to spread the love. His wings beat rapidly as he raced toward town. He was <br />
already thinking and hearing the thoughts of his old English teacher Ms. Maine. She was an incurable romantic, <br />
and she was lonely.  He found the mind of the poet to complement her in the body of Mr. Temperance, the <br />
postman. Now how to bring the two together?<br />
<br />
As he thought about Maine &amp; Temperance, he was distracted by so many thoughts.  So many lonely unhappy people.  <br />
He would make them happy, he would help them find true love...</p>
