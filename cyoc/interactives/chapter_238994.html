<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marc was what most people would call a bookworm. Despite being a fully grown man with a steady Monday-to-Friday job as a programmer, his life was far from agitated. His job wasn’t terrible, and his salary was decent enough to cover all his monthly expenses, but it was mundane and boring job. On weekends, while others hit the beach, partied, or pursued thrilling hobbies, Marc had a very different idea of fun. Every Saturday and Sunday, he spent his afternoons at the city’s grand library.<br />
<br />
There, he’d grab a stack of all kinds of literature books and novels, settle into a quiet corner, and read for hours. Once he finished, he’d carefully return each book to its rightful shelf before heading home. Marc’s dedication to this routine wasn’t just because.<br />
<br />
For one, he loved the library as a space. He was someone who cherished peace and quiet places when it came to reading, and his apartment just didn’t offer the same sense of immersion and calm. The library, on the other hand, provided the perfect atmosphere for diving into stories. Secondly, it made him nostalgic. During his college years, the campus library had been his favorite escape, a place where he spent countless hours lost reading all kinds of fantasy novels.<br />
<br />
And then, there was his secret hope—a very dumb fantasy. Marc dreamed of meeting the love of his life in the library. He fantasizing with the idea someone noticing him amid the stacks, appreciating his love for books, and sparking a connection. He wanted to marry someone who shared his passion for reading, someone who would understand why he loved reading books so much. Even though Marc was a very peculiar and nerdy person in many ways, in reality his tastes and preferences with women weren&#39;t very different from those of the average guy, as ridiculous as this may sound, Marc would give anything to live in a world where busty bimbos with plump lips love to spend their time reading literature in the library. What silly thought and concept of a better world, he admitted to himself, but a persistent idea nonetheless.<br />
<br />
However, after six years of faithfully visiting the library every weekend, that part of his fantasy remained unfulfilled. Libraries, unsurprisingly, aren’t exactly the best place flirt with sexy girls or even just find them. Still, Marc had made good use of his time. Over those six years, he’d devoured a staggering number of books. Sometimes, he joked to himself that. Hmm would he read every book in the library or finally meet the woman of his dreams here, the mystery, what will happen first? At the rate he was going, it seemed like the former was more likely.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t all bad, though. Marc took a bit of pride in his reading accomplishments. He’d almost finished all the works of Jin Yong and was now halfway through &quot;White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind&quot;, the last one, with that finish you would have read all this author&#39;s books!..Time flies...Wow seriously you&#39;ve been doing this for 6 years?<br />
<br />
However, this Saturday was about to be anything but ordinary. After finishing his lunch, Marc headed to the library as he always did. But then he saw it, he had never come across anything like this so to speak…?<br />
<br />
Lying in the middle of the street was what looked like a card. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a card with nothing but a QR code printed on it. Beneath it, there was a small booklet, looked like an instruction manual, lying on the ground. Intrigued, Marc picked up both the card and the manual to take a closer look of them.<br />
<br />
The had the following booklet title: “A Phone App That Changes One Thing About Anything.” As Marc flipped through its pages, he began to read the explanation of what was this:<br />
<br />
“This app has the power to edit reality retroactively, altering every element that defines it. Here’s how it works:<br />
<br />
Using the app, you can scan something with your phone. The app will then generate a sentence that perfectly describes the scanned object or person with 100% accuracy. Each generated sentence is completely random, meaning you can generate multiple descriptions of the same target, but every sentence will still be a 100% accurate and perfect description of the target.<br />
<br />
The app allows you to CHANGE one word on the generated sentence. Once you make a change, the new sentence will still be 100% accurate to the scanned target. This means the very reality from where emerged the original sentence will be rewritten to ensure the new description is completely true. If necessary, even the entire history of humanity will be edited to maintain what is described in the sentence as true. Reality will shift to reflect the changes and adjust to whatever you asked this app to change.<br />
<br />
In essence, this app grants you the ability to edit reality to your liking, retroactively.<br />
<br />
On default mode, only who just used the app retains awareness of any changes made. This ensures you can perceive the difference in the two realities, as the altered timeline would otherwise erase any memory of the previous one. In this User Aware Mode, your memories from the original reality are copypasted on the new reality, allowing you to remember exactly how things were before the alteration. Due your memories being carried over from Reality A to Reality B.<br />
<br />
Other points of interest:<br />
<br />
1) The app utilizes location data to generate a map of everything within 50 feet of your position. You can select any object or person within this range via the map, or by directly scanning the target with your phone, to generate the sentence that describes the target<br />
<br />
2)Th&#61597;&#12339;&#10101;&#58594;&#13105;&#61635;&#59623;&#13104;---”<br />
<br />
Then the text abruptly ended, the rest of the booklet corrupted beyond readability. Marc frowned as he skimmed through the few remaining pages, but the content was illegible. <br />
<br />
Ok what in the name of fuck was all this about? Was this some kind of prank? Was this part of the setup for some sci-fi movie someone was filming around here? <br />
<br />
Marc wasn’t sure what to think. Despite the risk of potentially infecting his phone with a virus, he decided to scan the QR code from the card he found alongside the booklet. To his utter shock, scanning the code instantly caused a mysterious app to install itself on his phone! What made this even stranger was that Marc had his mobile data turned off, meaning his phone wasn’t even had access to the internet. How in the world did that app manage to install itself just from scanning a QR code? The hell was all this?<br />
<br />
When Marc opened the app, it seemed to match the description from the booklet. It appeared to be the reality-editing app described in the manual.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Marc allowed himself to believe that this could all be true. Nervous and paranoid that someone might catch him with something maybe he shouldn’t have, he quickly stuffed the booklet and card into the pocket of his jacket and hurried away from the spot where he’d found them, making a beeline for the library.<br />
<br />
About forty minutes later, Marc had completely left that random spot on the street behind and was now stepping into his favorite place in the entire city—the big library. A place that was like sanctuary he visited every Saturday and Sunday.<br />
<br />
But as he walked in, his thoughts were dominated by one burning question: What the heck? And could this app on my phone actually work?<br />
<br />
Trying to shake off the lingering unease, Marc headed to his usual spot to grab some books and settle down at a random table. But as he looked around, another unusual thing caught his eye. The library today seemed to have a big number of women in it today—far more than usual. Marc couldn’t help but wonder: Could this be destiny…?<br />
<br />
First things first, what Marc needed to do was confirm whether the app was what his inner fantasy-believing self thought it was. Having read countless books, he was no stranger to scenarios like the one this app promised, and he already had an idea of how to test the statements.<br />
<br />
Marc picked up one of the books he had grabbed, took a picture of it with his phone’s regular camera, and set the photo aside. Then, he opened the mysterious app that had inexplicably installed itself on his phone without any internet connection.<br />
<br />
He proceeded to scan the book using the app.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, the app generated a sentence describing the book:<br />
<br />
>&quot;A copy of The Great Gatsby, a book written in 1925 by the American author Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. The book cover features eyes and a mouth on a blue background.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marc froze, staring at the screen in disbelief. How could the app generate such an accurate description of the book? His phone still didn’t have internet access, so the app couldn’t have pulled the information from the web. Intrigued—and a little terrified—Marc decided to test the app’s main feature.<br />
<br />
He edited the sentence, changing the word “blue” to “yellow”.<br />
<br />
&quot;A copy of The Great Gatsby, a book written in 1925 by the American author Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald. The book cover features eyes and a mouth on a yellow background.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment he hit “accept” on the app, the impossible happened. Right before his eyes, the book’s cover changed. Instantly. The background, which had been blue, was now yellow.<br />
<br />
Marc’s hands trembled as he quickly went to check the photo he took a couple of minutes ago. The photo had changed too! The book in the image now had a yellow cover. His heart raced as the realization hit him: the app actually worked. The change was retroactive. He had just rewritten the past of this book, and he changed not only the book but also a photo of it that existed before he did the change.<br />
<br />
If Marc wasn’t in a library, he might’ve jumped up and screamed something ridiculous like, “Hallelujah, it worked!” But the library atmosphere forced him to stifle his excitement. Still, his shock made him shift in his chair awkwardly, and in the process, he accidentally knocked over the stack of books he had piled on the table.<br />
<br />
As the books hit the floor with a thud, Marc quickly bent down to gather them, trying to avoid drawing attention to himself.<br />
<br />
But there was no denying it now: the app worked. Everything the booklet had described was real. He now held something that defied all logic—a tool capable of bending reality itself to his will. The possibilities were endless, and with so much power at his fingertips, Marc’s mind buzzed with excitement and indecision. Where does he even start?<br />
<br />
It took Marc another fifteen minutes to calm down. He forced himself to take slow, steady breaths, trying not to look too suspicious. After all, he didn’t want to attract unwanted attention in his favorite library.<br />
<br />
Finally, he felt composed enough to start to act.<br />
<br />
Alright, Marc thought, time to see what this thing can really do.<br />
<br />
Marc looked around.<br />
<br />
Near Marc, three people were sitting at their tables, each minding their own business.<br />
<br />
At one table was what Marc could guess was a guy and his girlfriend, both of them looked like they were adults, but they looked still pretty young so they were possibly perhaps college freshmen, so they both had to be around 20 or 23 years old? The guy was tall and blonde, with a fit, athletic build that suggested he played sports. His girlfriend, on the other hand, had short black hair and but what stood out most about the girl was how she had a wow huge bust, she had a pretty big pair of tits and they were quite visible because she was wearing a somewhat low-cut blouse, not only did they look very big but it seemed like their size was completely natural! However, even though the girl had that big pair of natural melons there, her face was quite ugly honestly, like my god she was the literal definition of butterface, Marc couldn’t help but think her features were misaligned and awkward, she also had huge eyebrows that didn&#39;t look good at all...like really, when God created this woman he really said to himself: give her tits and nothing else. Marc guessed that if it weren&#39;t for that huge pair of tits surely that black haired girl would never have gotten a boyfriend like that hot guy...Anyway, the two seemed engrossed in their studies, with the girl actively helping her boyfriend prepare for what Marc guessed was an upcoming exam.<br />
<br />
At the table behind them, was the table that was right in front of where Marc was. There sat a girl who had a nerdy appearance, like if someone unexpectedly looked for someone here to play Vilma Dinkley this girl wouldn&#39;t be a bad option. She had a classic “nerdy” look—glasses perched on her nose and a snug green turtleneck that highlighted her slender frame. Unlike the previous girl, she barely had any bust, probably a B-cup at best if Marc had to gues. But what stood out most about the nerdy woman, was her face, which was sweet, tender, and undeniably cute, her face was so so cute. It was hard to describe but there was something about her that was quite the charm of cute nerdy girl vibe, literally she was the opposite of that other girl, not much chest but all the cuteness went to the face, and Marc estimated she was likely a bit older than the other two, maybe around 28. Her long brown hair was neatly kept.<br />
<br />
What really caught Marc’s attention, though, was the way this girl wasn’t focused on her book. Instead, she seemed fixated on the short-haired girl at the table in fronte, this girl cheeks slightly flushed as she watched the girl with short hair, was she looking at her bust...?<br />
<br />
Huh? Marc’s curiosity spiked.<br />
<br />
This made the second girl completely capture Marc&#39;s attention, then he discreetly opened the app and scanned the long-haired nerdy girl. Within seconds, a sentence appeared on his screen:<br />
<br />
>&quot;This nerdy woman who wears a green turtleneck, named Celine, is looking at the bust of another girl, named Yasmine. Yasmine is a busty woman with a G-cup, her huge breasts are natural, and Yasmine&#39;s face is very ugly. Celine is jealous that Yasmine&#39;s breasts are much bigger than her own breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
What a hilariously detailed sentence the app had randomly generated for Marc! So the two women were named Celine and Yasmine. Marc couldn’t decide what amused him more—the revelation that Celine, despite her looks, was secretly jealous and wished for a bigger chest, or the fact that even the app agreed Yasmine’s face was... well, very ugly. Probably the latter. Marc chuckled to himself, imagining the blonde guy not exactly being very excited at the idea of kissing her up there compared to below. Also Marc learned there that Yasmine is a fucking G-CUP?! Wow that&#39;s a big size for sure.<br />
<br />
The sentence, packed with about 50 words of various details, left Marc wondering about his next move.<br />
<br />
What will you do now Marc? Generate a new different sentence to see what happens then and what other options does this give you? Use this sentence that was generated already when scanning Celine, to indirectly change Yasmine and fix her unfortunate face?<br />
<br />
Alternatively, Marc could scan Celine’s boyfriend to learn his name and uncover what quirks the app might expose about him. Or perhaps it was time to move on and explore another part of the library and see what options other people give you to do something. After all, there are many more people here than just these three.<br />
<br />
Of course, Marc could even try something absurd, like using the app on himself to see what it said—and maybe even change his own reality. What if he made himself gay, just for fun? The possibilities were endless.</p>
<hr/><h3>
The question now was, again: What will you do now, Marc?</h3>
