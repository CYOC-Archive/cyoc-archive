<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Twister someone shouted from the partying group.<br />
<br />
“Twister it is” Finn confirms to no one in particular. The air smelled of alcohol. Finn’s dad was setting up the twister mat. Paul, Isaac and Brad were chatting with the others and no one seemed the wiser of what was happening. Brad was reaching behind his ears dragging his still human fingers over the soft fur, his face betraying small amounts of pleasure from the movement.<br />
                                                                             …..<br />
Somewhere else a black-haired man was racing around his office. He was short of breath and grabbed a bag. In practiced seconds he obtained his inhaler and took a deep breath. This was Mathew. <br />
<br />
Mathew wore a simple but clean polo. His pants were smooth and professional. He was perfectly plain if he was in any office you can imagine. The only distinguishing feature on him was a plastic card on his breast which read Chronivac inc.<br />
<br />
“Fuck fuck fuck” Mathew was saying under his breath cursing how things could have gotten so out of hands. Yes he had been given the job of testing their new inventions but never ever was he allowed to lose sight of them let alone spread it over the world.<br />
<br />
Mathew was looking at a machine that looked like an old radar system. It pictured the world and he was looking at it with intensity. So far nothing had shown itself but he knew something had to happen. One person had downloaded the app before he was able to restore his mistake and get the app offline. He had gotten off easy with that he had to admit. It could have been much worse.<br />
<br />
After a few days of staring at the radar screen Mathew sat a little easier in his chair. His pose was a bit more relaxed than after he had first discovered his mistake and tried to remedy it. Maybe no one had gotten their hands on their valuable research. Then the screen started blipping. <br />
                                                                             …..<br />
Paul lay there topples over on Bard. Brad seemed like he was being squished but also had a bit of a red shine on his cheeks. Finn noted that the beer and games were doing their work well and reached out his hand paw to Paul. Paul took it but seemed to gain no help from it getting up. <br />
<br />
On the other mat Jeff and Dave seemed to fare much better. They looked up at their opponents shared a smile and got back up to their standing poses.<br />
<br />
“Well you lose again. Maybe it is not your day” Dave said to his, mostly human counterparts. Finn shook his head at that. Luck and fate had nothing to do with the losing streak of Isaac, Brad and Paul but they would not have to know that. <br />
<br />
Maybe he should let them win for once in order to keep everyone happy. Brad seemed pretty red anyway and Finn was not sure whether that came from having Paul on him or losing again. Finn reasoned that no one would benefit from Brad rage quitting halfway, So Finn put his hand on the back from Brad and gave him another beer.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get worked up too much. I am sure you will win the next round. Hey Isaac, Let’s show these two how to win for once, what do you say?” Isaac gave a nob and the four players started another match.<br />
<br />
Brad and Paul went back to the board to remove another card from their names. Paul took the feet note putting his beer at his mouth. Brad quickly ripped of the tail one and tossed it on the floor.<br />
<br />
Paul his feet bulged and stretched. His toenails grew enveloped over his toes and fused together leaving him with a hoof in each shoe that chewed into the material. They stretched until the cloth ripped leaving the heels hanging in the air. Paul fell on his slowly growing ass. He barely felt his fall but looked in shock at his feet until he shook his head and go up again continuing his beer. <br />
<br />
Finn smiled as the looked at the horse boy. Paul his head almost reached the ceiling and a clop announced every step he made. “halfway there” Finn thought to himself.<br />
<br />
Brad his change was much less spectacular. Finn knew he had changed but the tail looked like someone had stuck a rope into someone’s pants. More interesting was that Brad was losing height with every hour. The once massive player looked now like a normal average student. <br />
As Finn walked to the mat he Looked back to the empty wooden table of his kitchen. Did he not leave his phone on there? <br />
                                                                              …..<br />
“So furry boy thinks he can mess with reality like that. He will learn responsibility even if I have to bash it into him”.</p>
