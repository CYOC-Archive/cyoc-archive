<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How about my place? Parents are gone for the next 2 days on another business trip, so you guys could spend the night too. My little brother may be home though is all. But don&#39;t worry, he most likely won&#39;t bother us. Probably busy wearing a pair or my old panties or something. Oh, since you two don&#39;t know, my brother has a crossdressing fetish which he has poorly hidden from me. He definitely thinks no one knows about it though. It is kinda fun watching how excited he gets when I hand him a new outfit to quote unquote donate. Yeah, like I am that much of a show-offy snob who only wears clothing once then tosses it out. I don&#39;t know where his stash is, but it has to be massive by now. It us kind of funny really. I bet he thinks we are the same size too. That being said, I am pretty sure it is just me and Krista, well I guess you both too who know about it. I know for a fact that our parents are completely blind to it.&quot; Said Marin, unknowingly dropping a huge bomb on Brie. <br />
<br />
Clarice didn&#39;t miss her chance though. &quot;So your brother wants to be a girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I would bet that it likely is just a fetish for him. However, now that I&#39;m thinking of it, he may actually make for a pretty cute girl. If he were to fully commit that is, like with full makeup, hair extensions or a wig, etc.&quot; Answered Krista. She had been told by Marin years ago, and had agreed to keep the secret too.<br />
<br />
Clarice was grinning like mad. &quot;Oh I want to see what he looks like. Got a picture or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marin pulled out her phone and opened one of her pictures of her brother to show the group. The picture was only about a year old or so. Brie felt that she had aged quite a lot in that time, but seeing herself once again, this time as a girl, she had to painstakingly agree that she was rather androgynous at best, but maybe also even a bit more effeminate than she had realized in certain areas. For one, she wasn&#39;t tall. At 66&quot;, she was about the average height for many of the girls that she went to high school with. She was really never able to grow a full beard either. So she had keep her face cleanly shaved at all times (along with the rest of her body). She use to have her hair kept rather long for a guy when she was in high school, so if she had been given a bit of makeup and maybe a padded bra, she could have probably passed for a boyish looking girl easily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, she&#39;s kinda cute.&quot; Said Clarice, using &quot;she&quot; instead of &quot;he&quot; on purpose. Marin had caught on to her intention, but choose to just ignore it for now. However Krista wouldn&#39;t let it slide. &quot;HE isn&#39;t a girl Clarice. HE just like crossdressing which is perfectly fine for people to enjoy.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Clarice took the hint and almost was about to backed off a bit, when she thought of one last quip. &quot;Alright, but I do have an intriguing thought. Hypothetically, if you Krista, were to marry him, who would be the bride, and who would wear the dress?&quot;<br />
<br />
Krista&#39;s face turned beat red at the unexpected question. Marin knew that Krista had a thing for her brother, which was why she told her about his hobby since it was something they shared. So she understood the importance that question held to her. Brie on the other hand, was throughly humiliated by now, amd wanted nothing more than to leave. But since she was pretending to be Clarice&#39;s girlfriend, she couldn&#39;t just up and leave on the spot without any excuse. So she did her best to swallow her embarrassment to the best she could. But seeing how Krista reacted to the question had piqued her interest a bit. She wasn&#39;t an idiot, so when Krista hesitated a few seconds before she stuttered out the first word in her response, she had gotten a pretty good idea that she must like her. &quot;W-w-well, uhh, I, er... I guess I would be the bride, and, um, depending on how we would hold the wedding would decide who is in a dress, maybe. B-but. If I had to pick, then... he would, be in the dress, and I, would get the suit.&quot; Krista finally muttered out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, well no need to get too worked up about it. It was just a hypothetical situation. Just something that I thought up on the spot is all. I didn&#39;t mean to insult anyone if I did.&quot; Apologized Clarice so that she wouldn&#39;t risk being dropped out of the group for being rude. <br />
<br />
Marin felt better after hearing that, and switched her focus over to the silent one. &quot;So what do you think Brie? You have been rather quiet. Care to share your opinion?&quot;<br />
<br />
The last thing Brie wanted was to be put on the spot like this. But since it was her turn to share, she needed to say sonething. But ahe had to say it in a way that neither gave Clarice any more ideas, nor sounded like a complaint. After thinking it over, she finally came up with a fairly dismissive response. &quot;Umm, I don&#39;t know. I guess if it is what he wants to do, then whatever. If its his thing, then that&#39;s how it is. I don&#39;t really kink shame.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but like, would you ever even date him?&quot; Asked Marin, setting up a somewhat loaded question. Something about Brie had been bugging her for a while now, but she just couldn&#39;t figure out what. So she decoded to test out some of her personal details.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um, well you see, that isn&#39;t really an easy answer. On one hand, I am a lesbian, so I really am only into dating other girls. But maybe I could try it if he pretended to be one, since I think he would actually look fairly pretty if he were to try and look like a girl. But I am already dating Clarice. So saying whether I would date him or not isn&#39;t really appropriate for me to do, in my opinion at least.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marin nodded her head in understanding. Although her suspicions only grew even more. That answer had been too perfect. Too well thought out. It was almost a simple yes or no kind of question. And yet she answered so thoroughly. Something just wasn&#39;t sitting well with Marin about her. Like she was hiding something, but what could she possibly be hiding? Unless... no. That would be crazy let alone practically impossible, right? There is no way that Brie could actually be just her brother&#39;s female persona after he hard commits to crossdressing. But on the other hand, they are nearly identical in body shape and size. They were the same height even. But this girl clearly had massive tits. Then again breast forms have become almost life like now. So if he got one to perfectly match his skin tone. The thing that really frustrated her was that there wasn&#39;t anything solid to disprove her suddenly thought up theory either. <br />
<br />
In the end, Marin decided to just keep an eye out for anything. Maybe she would test her a few more times. &quot;Still though&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;If Brendon really is Brie, then he has done an amazing job. Even his voice is super girly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group left the cafe and got in a car to go to Marin&#39;s house, much to Brie&#39;s dismay and Clarice&#39;s enjoyment.</p>
