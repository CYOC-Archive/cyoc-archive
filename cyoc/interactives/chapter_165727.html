<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heading out of the library, he was keen to find more candidates for swapping. He was particularly keen to include himself in the fun. Dan was not happy with many aspects of the way he looked. Average height, rather above average weight, average below the belt, hair already thinning at 21, body hair in the wrong places. He’d lost count of the times he’d struck out at the students Union gay night.<br />
<br />
Now though, he could change all of that with a few strategic switches to give himself the body of his dreams.<br />
<br />
He looked around, but didn’t see any promising candidates for his own swap just yet. He did see a couple of individuals ripe for messing about with though.<br />
<br />
Dan spotted a silver fox of a lecturer that quite a few of his female dorm mates were attracted to. Despite being well over 50, he still had a lean trim waist, and square shoulders, with salt and pepper hair and beard that made him look distinguished rather than old. He looked around and spotted a greasy-looking teenager apparently on a open-day tour of the campus with his high-school classmates. He was perving on his female classmates making them uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Satisfied he’d found an appropriate donor, Dan switched the teen&#39;s youth for the age of the lecturer. The kids hair rapidly greyed and thinned, until it became a white horseshoe around the sides of his skull. <br />
 Crow’s feet formed at the corners of his eyes and he began to hunch over as his back grew weaker. He and his classmates, however, didn’t seem to notice anything untoward. He still behaved like he was a creepy kid, albeit one that suffered the beginnings of arthritis.<br />
The lecturer, meanwhile, developed a thick head of lustrous dark brown hair, though his beard thinned out and shrank to wispy stubble. His waist slimmed down further, while his backside plumped up into a pert peachy little behind. His chest swelled a little, filling out his shirt, as did his biceps. It was clear he was every bit as attractive as an 18 year old as he was as a middle aged man.<br />
<br />
Pleased with his results, Dan turned to a construction worker working on some refurb of a lecture theatre, handsome and very hirsute man in his early 30s. He had a full thick black beard, which almost connected with the forest of dark chest hair under his open collar. More dark hair covered his arms and, presumably his legs, though they were hidden by his work trousers.<br />
<br />
Smirking, Dan singled out one of the 18 year old girls the now middle aged teen was leering at, with fine, platinum blond locks. With a thought, she acquired the Builder’s thick black beard which clashed with her pale hair. Dark wiry hair could be seen through her open collar and her arms and legs were covered in dark thatch. The worker, on the other hand now had a silky smooth face, highlighting just how boyish and youthful he looked – clearly the beard was there to make him look more manly. His hairless arms seemed to gleam like satin. Feeling not a little aroused, Dan wanted to see more of the damage, so swapped the guy’s jeans for the tiny running shorts of a passing female jogger, and switched the Builder’s t-shirt over to one of his older colleagues who was wearing nothing under his open high-vis vest.<br />
<br />
The change of attire revealed a silky smooth tightly toned athletic torso, with a nice set of taut pecs and small pert pink nipples leading down to a well defined six pack, cute navel followed by a beautifully cut v-line leading into the tiny shorts that looked set to burst from the decent sized package within. The completely hairless legs were equally well toned.<br />
<br />
Dan was pleased with what he’d done – the guy’smuscles would have been all but invisible under all that body hair and he liked the man’s boyish good looks. He was sure the dude’s package would look far more impressive without a thatch of pubes too. Intrigued and keen to see more of the guy later, he made two further swaps, with a girl he spotted passing by who he knew lived a few doors down on his floor. Now the builder not only lived in the same building as him, he now had the sexual desires of a shy 19 year old straight girl. Dan made sure to make the builder aware of that last swap – he enjoyed the  thought of the guy feeling confused the next time he went to beat that impressive meat of his.<br />
<br />
Satisfied, Dan moved on, keen to find a partner to swap with himself. And he found him, a guy he recognised from the LGBT union, Tim. Tim was short, but with an impressively athletic build, coupled with an achingly handsome boyish face, with a Spanish complexion, a bona fide twunk. Tim intrigued Dan – he’d wondered what it would be like to be a twink many a time, wishing he could slim down himself.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, he switched with Tim. Suddenly he was looking at himself in the distance, albeit from a much lower vantage. He looked down, seeing his new pecs straining his shirt, his flat stomach and his slimmer, toned legs peeping out from beneath his shorts. Feeling guilty about leaving Tim in his rank old body, he quickly spotted another lecturer, a 30 something with a rather well built figure and neatly trimmed blond beard. He swapped the two of them, so that Tim was now in the nicely muscled hairy body that Dan would be happy to feel up at the next Union gay night. Happy with the change, Dan headed to the toilets to explore his new body.</p>
