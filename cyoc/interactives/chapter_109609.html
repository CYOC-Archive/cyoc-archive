<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Chronivac was on my phone, but I don&#39;t have one right now.  I checked on the computer, but I couldn&#39;t find it anywhere.  I did set the changes to last for a day, so hopefully I would change back by tomorrow.  In the meantime, I guess I&#39;m a 4th grader again.  I leave the computer and go back to my homework, which is now for 4th grade unlike earlier.  I know that I&#39;ve been through this stuff before, but I gotta say that the math homework gave me a little trouble.  Yes, a teen in a 4th grader&#39;s body is having trouble with 4th grade math.  I guess my brain also got younger in the process.<br />
<br />
The door suddenly opens and my mom insisted on checking my homework to see if I&#39;m doing it right.  I never had to go through that when I was older, but now I&#39;m being treated like a kid.  Anyways, she told me to &quot;double check&quot; my answers since I got a few wrong.  I would have asked for help, but I had to do this on my own.  As soon as I did finish, dinner was ready, which was uneventful.  Mom and dad didn&#39;t even notice me being younger than usual; I guess they think that I&#39;m supposed to be 10.  My homework was already done, so I bolted upstairs to my room as soon as dinner was finished and turned on one of my game consoles.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#39;t have been caught dead with the kid stuff that I now have, but there was nothing else to do.  It wasn&#39;t even an hour after turning the console on that mom told me to turn it off.  Yes, they&#39;re trying to limit how long I can play with the consoles in a day, as they had always done before starting high school.  Furthermore, it was already 8:00 and I was told that I had to take a bath.  Even though I last had one before starting middle school and using showers, I was in no position to argue.  Thankfully, mom trusted me enough to do it myself.<br />
<br />
Since the transformation, I never had to see myself naked until right now.  Skinny, hairless, and a rather disappointing looking penis.  I didn&#39;t even bother looking at it for more than a few seconds.  I stepped in as soon as the bath was full enough for me, and my legs can&#39;t even reach the other side of the tub.  I forgot how small I was when I was younger, but now I remember hating being this small and wanting to be bigger.  Still, maybe I can try to find some enjoyment with being younger.<br />
<br />
Bathtime was a blur and before I knew it, 9:00 came and it was already time for bed.  The bed was the same as before, but the covers were completely different; they were the same as I remember from before I was 12.  The Mickey Mouse doll was still in the room and it was staring at me as I tried to get to bed.  With little hesitation, it was in my arms as I fell asleep.  It was the first time I saw that thing for years, before it went to the attic, and I somehow couldn&#39;t help myself.<br />
<br />
Waking up at 7:30 the next morning, I was hoping that I would return to my normal self.  I open my eyes, and damn!  Still the same as last night!  I&#39;m still 10!  I was hoping that the Chronivac wasn&#39;t going to be literal when I set this to last for 1 day, but now I guess it&#39;s back to 4th grade today.  I opened the dressers and picked out whatever didn&#39;t look childish to me, to no avail.  Fuck it, I thought.  I just grabbed whatever clothes I saw first and then saw myself in the mirror.  Based on how I look now, it would be no surprise if someone told me that I looked younger than 10, being short for my age.<br />
<br />
Breakfast happened and then it was time to go to school.  Yes, back to elementary school and I had to take the bus today.  Due to force of habit, I almost turned the other way on the way to the bus as my old school was in that direction.  Mom had to walk me to the bus, or at least part of that walk as I was on my own not even two minutes later.  I waited at the stop with some kids who I knew were 2nd grade, but I look like I could very well fit in with them.  The bus didn&#39;t take too long and I sat next to this kid named Toby.  In my older life, he was just a kid, but for some reason, I saw him as a friend.  It wasn&#39;t long before the endless conversations started and also before we arrived at the school.<br />
<br />
I haven&#39;t been to this school in a while, and it looked just the same as it did when I graduated to middle school.  I was expecting this day to feel like being in prison, but it actually wasn&#39;t too bad.  I did have some trouble with the lessons, but Ms. Simmons clearly wasn&#39;t out to get me like some of my old teachers were.  I did have a group of friends to hang out with during recess, but keep in mind that they were all guys.  I didn&#39;t like the fact that I was in one room for pretty much the entire day, but it was good to know that none of the kids in my class bullied me for my size.  Well, for the most part anyway.  <br />
<br />
Looking at the kids in my class, it is no secret that I&#39;m now one of the shortest, if not the shortest.  It wasn&#39;t really a problem with anyone in my grade, except for a few kids.  I try not to make any eye contact with them, or give them any attention, but they always lift me by my shirt and try to intimidate me.  Keep in mind that I am weaker than them, but imagine what would have happened to them if I was still older.<br />
<br />
Homework was still annoying as usual, but it wouldn&#39;t matter if I end up back to my normal self.  I try not to think about the Chronivac or about being older again until after I got home, which was a lot easier than expected.  Mom insisted on waiting for me at the bus stop as I got off, and, as usual, expected me to do my homework right away.  What was on my mind right now was the Chronivac.  Hopefully it ended up in a place that I can easily find it.  If not, then at least I cam hope that the change would end and I would be older again in the blink of an eye.  Then again, staying like this for a little longer wouldn&#39;t be too bad.</p>
