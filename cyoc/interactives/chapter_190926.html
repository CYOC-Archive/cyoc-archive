<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I promise to try and make these shorter, but I&#39;m trying to set a scene.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew Farminga stepped off the mostly blue with silver and black bus that he helped paint as a freshman and onto the blacktop of the parking lot.  Over his shoulder was his last name with Assistant Coach in the middle of the back of the jacket in black on the silver center.  Slipping his phone in his front chest pocket, he pulled the strings at the front to tighten his hood around his face and began walking across the pavement.<br />
<br />
The rain had softened up, but when he looked up to the sky, he saw lightening with no thunder in the distance.  All the trees seeming just a little too tall.  A driveway vanishing was one thing, but there was something more here.  A feeling in the back of his head that he just couldn&#39;t shake.<br />
<br />
Moving across the short parking lot area, Andy moved passed a jeep, an American muscle, two SUV, an <i>old</i> model BMW Beetle, one pickup truck, mini van that looked like it had seen one too many winters up north with all the rust it had, and two or three other cars.  Flash of light, and he looked up to the sky again... still no thunder.  Weird.  But when he got closer to the cars in the lot, he stopped and took a better look.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the actual fuck?&quot; he asked himself as he walked closer to the Beetle, distracted from his path to the cabin up the hill.  &quot;That&#39;s a Belarusian flag,&quot; he said with deep shock.  His family was from there.  The tiny flag was on the left side of a long white license plate rimmed with black with &#39;0415 DE-1&#39; in the same black.<br />
<br />
Looking at the other cars, the van had a New York plate, one with blue letters and a red Statue of Liberty in the middle.  The muscle car was an old black TransAM with a blue and yellow California plate.  But two of the other cars had clearly European plates, the jeep&#39;s plate said &#39;Brasil&#39; across the top of it, and one SUV said &#39;New South Wales&#39; near the bottom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that Australia...?&quot; Andy asked himself, confused.  Excluding the rust, most of them seemed in good shape, though four had flat tires.  &quot;This is some eerie shit,&quot; the Senior swore again now that he wasn&#39;t in earshot of the Coach.  Suddenly he was considering James&#39; thoughts on it being a horror movie all the more.<br />
<br />
As he walked under the lights that held up the path&#39;s roof, Andy pulled out his phone from his pocket.  He&#39;d just unplugged it from his reserve battery, so it was at 100% charge... but it also disturbingly said &#39;No Service&#39; in the top line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he remarked.  &quot;No bars.  Classic modern lazy writing,&quot; and, as if on cue, the header of the phone gained a swirling circle for a moment, found service, and returned him to one bar, then two, but no higher.<br />
<br />
Pulling the phone up to his mouth, he swiped to more commands and held the side button for the walkie-talkie feature.  &quot;Some of these cars are abandoned,&quot; he said to the Coach.  So long as the phones were within wi-fi range of each other, they could be used as short-range two-ways.  &quot;Many of them aren&#39;t American,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not every car can be a T-top,&quot; Coach Banks remarked.  The two knew to keep the responses short for best results.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not what I meant,&quot; Andy said.  It was easily fifty feet up the long walkway of stone to the front porch at the big double-doors.  Leaning to one side of the right door, Andrew looked in to the front meeting area.  It was lovely... warm, even, with all the lighting... but he didn&#39;t see anyone.<br />
<br />
Taking a gamble, he reached out and pulled on the handle of the door.  It opened.  &quot;It&#39;s unlocked,&quot; he said into his phone.  Without waiting for a response, he stepped inside.  His phone buzzed in his hand.  Glancing down, it said &#39;Northwest Bell SA-X02 Wireless Hotspot Available.  Unsecured Network&#39;.  Andy blinked and tapped &#39;Join&#39; as he moved up to the front desk and hit the bell there.<br />
<br />
His head looked around the spacious open room.  There were balcony&#39;s of the upper two floors looking down over the lounge area just ahead.  It was nice creme-colored tile pattern path surrounded by an ocean of dark red carpet with yellow designs.  Though... there was a smell.  A smell that Andrew didn&#39;t know well but that sort of smelled like... fap.  The distinct aroma of sex thickly covered by pine air freshener.<br />
<br />
He frowned.<br />
<br />
Glancing down at the guestbook at the service station, it was almost empty.  &quot;Either this is a new book or no one comes here but Harold and Miranda Blaskowitz and these other nine people,&quot; he remarked.  &quot;Just glad it doesn&#39;t have my name in it,&quot; he said... then turned his head to look at all the pictures on the walls.  Mostly it was scenic and animal paintings, but Andrew just wanted to make sure he wasn&#39;t <i>in</i> one the pictures or something too.<br />
<br />
Sure as he could be that he wasn&#39;t in The Shining, he yelled out <i>&quot;Hello!?&quot;</i>  No one answered.  Sighing, he pulled his phone up to his face, using the shortcut for the walkie again.  &quot;Place is lit.  TV&#39;s on The Weather Channel for Berlin, Germany.&quot;  He said each sentence with a pause after each.  &quot;Hold on, I&#39;m gunna check the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
A fateful mistake, it would turn out.  Approaching the bathroom just around the corner, the entrance seemed like one of those that you&#39;d walk left or right to get to male or female once inside the entrance, but neither was labeled.  When he stepped left and inside, there were urinals and toilet stalls equally and glancing right, he saw the other entrance came to this same place.  Even the walls were a gender-neutral creme white rather than a red or blue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unisex,&quot; he realized, softly.  &quot;Hello?  Is anyone in here?&quot; he asked, moving over to the stalls.  He knocked on one door and it simply swung open.  Feeling a little spooked, Andy eventually did open all the stalls.  Unfortunately for him, the last door had a level of white and sticky he was not prepared for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, <i>sick!&quot;</i> he yelped, flicking his hand hard so that the goo hit the inside of the stall wall as the door hung open.  Blinking, he saw writing on the wall.  &quot;We&#39;re all animals here,&quot; it said.  It was a detailed pen drawing of an upright penis, hard and pointed at the tip, with a bulge at the bottom above furry balls, and a tri-fold design underneath it like a ready canine sex.<br />
<br />
Andrew was largely ace... that is to say, asexual.  He never much felt attraction of a sexual kind to another person... but, with no one around, he found himself almost transfixed by the image before him.  It wasn&#39;t even crudely drawn.  It was overly detailed if anything... ballpoint pen on bathroom wall, a modern classic medium.  Truly a work of art.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; he asked himself, physically twisting his body to move away from the bathroom stall as if trying to break paralysis.  Andrew moved to the sink and ran cold water over his hands.  Pulling the soap dispenser and expecting it to be empty, but it was not.  Rinsing for thirty seconds was a habit he&#39;d gotten into but he still felt dirty.<br />
<br />
Also hard.  He looked down at his pants to confirm he in fact had such a raging boner that it was pressing against his khaki pants in a distinct rod-like shape.  &quot;Shit,&quot; he said.  He couldn&#39;t walk back out like this.  There&#39;d be so much distance everyone in the bus could see him before he&#39;d get there.  Turning his head, he moved back towards the stalls... but not the one he&#39;d last opened.<br />
<br />
Closing the door of the first stall behind him, Andy pulled down his pants and looked at his cock.  It was so dangerously hard as to be red and, honestly, looked a little bigger than he was use to.  As he started to rub it, he felt something moving behind him and jumped up.  Turning around to face the toilet seat, he didn&#39;t know what he expected to find—rat maybe?—but nothing was there.<br />
<br />
Standing at alert for an attack of some kind, his thick black lupine tail stuck out straight behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Andrew said, as if he had read the last sentence in a text document and could not figure out from the red underline how the word he&#39;d just used had been misspelled when the program insisted it was.  Turning his head so fast he actually hurt his neck, Andy had a brief eight seconds of literally chasing his own tail before he reached out, grabbed it, yiped, then grabbed it more gently the second time.<br />
<br />
Running his hand over the fur, he loved it.  He expected it to be coarse, but it was actually kind of smooth... like the thickness of it was like a full and shampooed head of hair.  It was fur, though, definitely, and not hair.  The tail was lupine for sure, but also larger... like the tail a werewolf might have.<br />
<br />
Andrew hadn&#39;t noticed his other hand was stroking his shaft while he&#39;d been stroking his tail.  Sitting back down, his first instinct was to get the boner to go away and then focus on the tail.  Why?  Probably some way the curse worked, because Andy wouldn&#39;t have been able to tell you.  Just like he couldn&#39;t say why he had trouble jerking off.<br />
<br />
He had no one to picture in his head since he didn&#39;t feel strongly in that way about anyone.  Instead, he remembered the image from the other stall vividly in his head.  The rod he imagined was tasty and he licked his lips... but the word &#39;lips&#39; stuck in his head, and suddenly he was picturing that plump canine spade drawn at the lower part of the picture.<br />
<br />
Beneath him, taint pulled back from behind his still human and hairy balls.  In his mind, as he pictured the bitch&#39;s anatomy, he imagined one for himself.  Black fur just like his hair around the area, three plump lips, maybe in heat?  No, just needy... just like him.  And as he rubbed one hand under his balls to his new female anatomy, he discovered his lupine clit was a bit large as brushing it with just the top of his finger made him cum, twice... once with his femsex flexing as if trying to hold a dick inside him, and a second time with his human shaft jerking to let loose a stream of white against the stall door.<br />
<br />
Some of it ended up on his underwear, but an unusual amount of it was on the door.  Excellent launch distance.  And in that moment, the urge vanished just as quick as it had come, and Andrew was left in the stall, realizing what all had happened.<br />
<br />
He had a black wolf tail, rather large, and now calming female spade that was his.  Honestly, it felt rather good, but in truth more concerned about the none-human, none-male parts he&#39;d just earned himself.  Comfy new appendage be right was wrong in all kinds of ways and his mind reeled from the double-think.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Andy,&quot; came the coach&#39;s voice after a handful of minutes... Andrew was already washing his cloths with paper towels at the sink before the triple beep of the walkie-talkie feature of his phone made him jump.  &quot;Everything OK?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Andrew said.  &quot;This place is super-cursed and we gotta go.&quot;  With that, he re-buckled his pants and made haste through the main hall.  He didn&#39;t know what he was going to tell everyone, but it was clear they couldn&#39;t stay here.  They had to go, and now!<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it&#39;s too bad that really wasn&#39;t up to him... or any of them.</p>
