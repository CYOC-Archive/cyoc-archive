<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The private investigator made his way through the office building of Henry Amberhill, but it was his daughter, Effie, that he was going to see today. He had been called by her to take some photos and get any personal information he could on two women and their daughters who were living out in the outskirts of Old Town, Maine. He couldn’t fathom why someone so rich and powerful as the Amberhills wanted information on these people, but he had been promised ‘a lot of bills’ from Effie.<br />
<br />
The private investigator took the elevator up to the floor right before the penthouse and walked to the last door at the end of the hallway. The private investigator took a deep breath and knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
“Who the fuck is it?!” A female voice from the other end called out angrily.<br />
<br />
“Uh, the....the private investigator you hired....ma’am. I’ve got that info you wanted.” The private investigator replied with a notable fright in his voice.<br />
<br />
“Right. The door’s unlocked.” The female voice replied.<br />
<br />
The private investigator opened the office door to see an office arranged like it was a punk teenager’s room, minus the bed. Directly ahead of the private investigator was the woman who hired him, Effie Amberhill. If he didn’t feel terrified of the woman, he would think her beautiful in a way,even with her half shaved blonde hair . She sat on the edge of her desk smoking a cigarette while wearing a white tuxedo shirt, undone to show off her cleavage, and black suit pants with short black cowgirl boots that dangled just above the floor.<br />
<br />
“I take it you got the information I paid you for?” The woman asked glaring at him while smoking her cigarette.<br />
<br />
“Y-Y-Yes ma’am. I’ve got it right here: this envelope has the pictures, and all the information you need about those two women and their daughters.” The man said holding out the envelope towards her as she nearly grabbed it, but the man held it away from her.<br />
<br />
“Now, wait just a minute!” The private investigator said putting on a brave face for a moment as Effie gritted the cigarette in her teeth she had been smoking. Her eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
“I...beg....your....pardon?” She asked, holding back an obvious scream.<br />
<br />
“I...uh...I will not give you this, until you hand me the money you owe me.” The private investigator said as Effie rolled her eyes as she reached behind her and handed the man an envelope with what looked to be a lot of money inside of it.<br />
<br />
“Now, hand me what’s mine.” The blonde growled insisted as the he handed her the large envelope.<br />
<br />
Effie opened the envelope and peered inside and grinned seeing all the dirt this investigator had brought her as she now looked up to see the investigator looking to leave as he began walking towards the door while opening his envelope and stopped looking baffled by what he saw inside.<br />
<br />
“Hey, there’s just a bunch of one dollar bills in here.” The private investigator said turning back towards Effie.<br />
<br />
BAM!<br />
<br />
The private investigator fell onto his back and screamed in pain as the shot had hit him in the stomach.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I said I would pay you in ‘a lot of bills’, but I never clarified what those bills would be, now did I?” Effie explained with a chuckle as she kissed her gun, ‘Effie Jr.’.<br />
<br />
“Oh, sweetie, you did so well, now mommy has to make the nice man go bye-bye.” Effie said to her gun as she tucked it away and leaned over the man and gave him a firm kick in the side where she had shot him and let out a squeal of joy when he screamed in agony.<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, I’m not done with you yet.” Effie said as the doors to the elevator opened.<br />
<br />
“Come along, I’m taking you to meet some of daddy’s men.” Effie said as she picked up the investigator and dragged him to the elevator as he screamed in pain. Effie made it to the elevator and pulled the man inside as he was still cowering in pain.<br />
<br />
She now took the man down to the parking garage where many of her father’s men were doing miscellaneous things like either playing cards or waiting on orders from their boss when the elevator doors opened.<br />
<br />
“Boys, boys, you’ve all been doing such a good job helping my father and I get ready for our little planned attack that I’ve brought you a treat. Some nice human flesh to bite your teeth into!” Effie exclaimed as her father’s men cheered for her, all of them knowing better than to deny her bloodlust.<br />
<br />
“No.....plea....please....Miss Amberhill....I....I brought you what you wanted.” The investigator pleaded to Effie as she hoisted him up to her face.<br />
<br />
“Yes…you did. But I can’t have any loose ends that might tie back to me and my father, so…” Effie said as she tossed him to her father’s men.<br />
<br />
“Enjoy boys, and remember to clean up that shit when you’re done!” Effie said as her father’s men now changed into their werewolf forms and began devouring the private investigator as Effie watched while a grin formed on her face before pressing the button to head up to her office to look over the information the investigator had given her.<br />
<br />
Effie went back to her office and began to look through the file. She saw the teenage girls and scoffed at the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Fucking child’s play with those two.” Effie scoffed as she looked at the two of them.<br />
<br />
She then came across the pictures of the mothers of the two girls and raised a slight eyebrow at the two women.<br />
<br />
“Luca’s bitch widow and this other chick look easy enough to deal with for daddy.” Effie smirked as she now came to a final photograph of a woman she didn’t quite recognize, then looked through the notes that her informant had given her and her eyes went wide when she recognized one word in particular, ‘Misery’.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! God damn it! Daddy!” Effie Amberhill shouted as she went to the elevator and headed to her father’s penthouse.<br />
<br />
“Daddy, we got a major fucking problem here.” Effie said as she slapped the folder and the photos and notes down before her father, Henry, as both he and Trisha looked over the photos and notes that Effie had recently acquired.<br />
<br />
“What’s the problem Effie? You know I’m still planning the attack on Mrs. Hoti’s land.” Henry asked raising an eyebrow.<br />
<br />
“This is the problem; those bitches and their little bastards have a fucking wizard living with them now, and not just any wizard, one that goes by the name ‘Misery’.” The blonde said pointing her finger at the picture of the human woman and her disguise.<br />
<br />
“Hmm, yes, yes I must say this does pose a problem. But Effie, you worry too much and you forget that Trisha here has rudimentary magic she can use against this ‘Misery’ woman.” Henry reminded his daughter nodding towards Trisha.<br />
<br />
“Key word being ‘rudimentary’ daddy. Her spells aren’t anything more than basic party tricks.” Effie said rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I do know a spell that will be most useful against this ‘Misery’ woman, Miss Amberhill.” Trisha said as she put down her notepad and walked around Effie creating a circle and saying some magic words.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck was that petty parlor....” Effie began to say before she realized she couldn’t get out of the circle she currently found herself in. It was like she was a mime trapped in a box.<br />
<br />
“My plan for ‘Misery’ is a simple one. Lure her into my circle that I create and trap her within it. I can make the duration of the spell last however long we need it, be it one minute, like what I’ve done with you. Or it can be longer.” Trisha said as she went back to pick up her notepad just as the spell was finished and Effie was released from her temporary prison.<br />
<br />
“See Effie, this is why it’s always good to think one step ahead of your enemies. Now, what did you do about your source for these photos?” Henry asked his daughter.<br />
<br />
“I let your men have their way with him, it looked so beautiful daddy, like a work of art as they tore him to shreds.” Effie sighed thinking about the way her father’s men had slaughtered Effie’s info source.<br />
<br />
“If you were an artist, you would be the bloody Jackson Pollock of your time.” Trisha joked as Effie scoffed while Henry Amberhill looked over the photos and notes they had.</p>
