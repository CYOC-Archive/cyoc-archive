<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well I always loved chocolate” Roger said grabbing the brown labeled can. “Excellent choice sir” replied Megan as Roger opened the can and took a good size gulp, tasting a bitter dark chocolate concoction. At first Roger didn’t feel any different at first but then felt a tickling sensation across the back of his neck. Bringing his hand to his neck it was intercepted by a large wave of hair, he grabbed a handful of it and brought to his eye. What he saw was that his hair had grown to considerable length reaching we’ll pass his shoulders gaining a curly strain and a midnight black color and unsee by him all other body hair had vanished leaving no trace. As he was inspecting this new feature another change caught his eye, his hands were pained as they started becoming slender and delicate things as the nails grew a cm in length and covered in a layer of purple polish. At the same time his skin pigment started darkening into a light tan tone and still darkening. Once his hands were finished the change shifted to his arms losing the well formed muscle underneath and started to match his hands in size and shape. As the change reached his torso the slightly uncomfortable feeling multiplied tenfold as his shoulders crunched in on themselves drastically decreasing his height, muscles here also melted away becoming thin layers of fat Roger also felt an extremely tight grip on his waist sucking the air away from his lungs only to sudden be release with a crack of his spine which formed a new forward arc and waist becoming the center of a developing hourglass. The melted muscle then started moving to his pecs growing into sizable mounds the nipple growing twice their size once they finished growing Roger immediately recognized them as breasts clearly in the DD cup range. He also saw that his skin had taken a milk chocolate color at this point and still growing ever more darker. Then Roger felt the change start to form in his feet taking the same change as his hands becoming small attachments with purple nail polish. The legs then started to painfully change the calves and thighs muscles turning into softer flesh then started growing in length giving Roger some of his height back while at the same time turning his legs into beautiful long thick appendages. Then both waves of the transformation hit together causing Roger’s hips to widen to match the thick legs he had developed becoming perfect child bearing size and his butt ballooned into a supple size to match the rest of his lower body finishing the hourglass figure that had been forming. Then all the changes centered on his groin where he felt tremendous pleasurable  pressure building, Roger instinctively grabbed hold of his penis in his pants as he soon felt it shrinking into him. At the same time the pressure had started pushing his testicles deeper into his body until they both popped in and began digging into their new positions turning into the held sperm into eggs forming Roger’s new ovaries the trail they leave behind becoming a new tight vagina, moist uterus and finally Fallopian tubes as the ovaries settled in their new placement. Once Roger became a biological female her remaining male anatomy just slowly escaped Roger’s grasp burying itself above the vagina turning into a small clit. As Roger finished becoming a she, her skin finished it color change staying as a dark ebony complexion with no sign of blemish or imperfection anywhere on it. Roger quickly turned around to see a mirror to witness the final change as her neck thinned and Adam’s apple sinked back into her neck, as Roger gasped for breath from this change her voice taking a new pitch being several octaves higher and smoky tone. Her face then received a drastic change her lips growing large and plump soon being covered in a dark purple lipstick, her nose shrunk a bit and took a more flat shape, her brow became smoother and thinner of her new gender, her checks and jaw became soft and rounded and finally her eyes became slightly bigger with added dark purple eye shadow, eyeliner and mascara but the amber color remained only being more brighter than their male version. Once Roger overcame from the initial shock she glared at Megan who only held a big smile on her face. “What have you done?” Asked Roger in a new smoky sultry voice. “Why I gave you the opportunity to help improve your life you took it” she replied. “You didn’t say that it would include becoming a woman how does this improve my life” Roger countered. “Well as a stripper your job is to induce pleasure and excitement in your audience but being gay has been a barrier holding you back as you feel slightly uncomfortable performing for women not allowing you to use your full passion in your performance. As such your demand has suffered which hurts your wages but now as a woman you will be stripping for men who you feel a connection to, allowing your full passion to erupt which will increase your demand increasing your hours and tips. Also as a straight woman now your dating market has far more options as all the men you have fallen for have been straight. So tell me how has your life not improved because of that drink” Megan argued. As Roger thought about it she realize Megan was right, in the form she was in right now her business, dating and overall life was improved but she still felt a connection to her old form having lived a life as a man. “But I can’t just become a woman what everyone I know think that I disappeared and this new woman came out of nowhere with no past what life would I live” Roger asked. “Well if you finished that soda you bought reality would bend in a way that you were alway a woman your life would be almost the same except some changes to result in you being in this form” Megan explained edging the brown labeled soda closer to the new woman. Roger took the can in hand looking at the fizzy fluid swishing in the can thinking of what might change and then looked back at the mirror seeing the beautiful, confident and sexy person that she is, she then turned back to Megan with a more sure look “You know Roger doesn’t really fit my new status call me Regina” tipping the can into her mouth draining the remaining liquid down her throat. As the last drop passed her lips, Regina felt as if a heavy fog was lifted from the entire world, soon then her former male clothing vanished off her body leaving her nude for all but a moment until new attire started adore are shapely figure. First a set of black lace lingerie cupped her breasts and embraced her groin region, next to form was a pair of fishnet stockings that wrapped around her legs followed a leather skirt that cut off just above the knee, then a pair of black high-heeled leather boot materialized up to her mid calf, what followed up was a tight purple shirt which showed a good portion of cleavage which was then mostly covered by a slim fitting black leather jacket. As the clothes finished their appearance Regina felt several sharp pricks in her ear only to find that her ears were now pierced and their were several earrings which were a pair of silver arrow shaped pieces then a pair of smaller arrows and finally a chain that led to a final piercing higher up the lobe. This was not the only jewelry as an intricate necklace of colored polished stones and several silver bangles on each wrist also appeared. Next to Regina a silver-gray handbag came into existence where after some exploring Regina found make-up, tampons, a phone, a checkbook, etc. what interested Regina the most was the wallet as she opened it she saw all the IDs only held one name Regina Edwards. As this was happening new memories started to manifest in Regina’s mind being kicked out for being a stripper rather than being gay, her parents now African-American and her workplace having change to a strip club that now caters to men which also holds a new stripper name for her “the Ebony Angel”. Regina turned her head to Megan who still held her smile Regina broke the silence first “Allow me to introduce you to Regina Edwards employee of the Midnight Sun Club A.K.A. The Ebony Angel” Regina said in her same sultry voice only with more confidence and surety, giving a slight bow with flourish with a large smile draped a crossed her face to finish. “Well I hope you enjoy your day Ms. Edwards” Megan replied. Regina then left the store and the alley where she continued on with her day, where ever that might lead.</p>
