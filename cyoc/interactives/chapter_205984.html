<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason wakes up, mostly oblivious to what Sarah had done while he was asleep, and decided to go the bathroom start his morning routine.<br />
<br />
Sarah felt the movement and woke up too, being a way lighter sleeper than Jason. She decided not to comment on the whole sucking part of the night, but gave Jason a good morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, I almost forgot you where there. Eeeeer...Good morning too Sarah.&quot; Said Jason, remembering that this whole thing wasn&#39;t just a bad dream.<br />
<br />
What both him and Sarah realised is that his voice was a little higher than normal, but Jason mostly thought that it was his throat acting up and him needing to oral higiene to fix it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I know it is a new thing for you, I too wish I had woken up in my body, so it is a learning process for both of us.&quot; Said Sarah, trying to be nice to him for trying things behind his back, literally.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, like, do you have teeth to brush or something of the kind?&quot; Asked Jason, being polite, considering he hasn&#39;t fully grasped the whole deal yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, the doctor said that my teeth where just recombined into your bones with the rest of my skull. So atleast I don&#39;t have to brush anymore. Can you imagine? Hahahaha.&quot; Replied Sarah, having some fun with the thought of shoving a toothbrush inside of Jason&#39;s ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooph, I&#39;m glad there is that. I was thinking I would have to shove a brush in my ass everyday. Hahahaha&quot; Said Jason, feeling aliviated that this isn&#39;t the case.<br />
<br />
Sarah just start cracking in laughter, as she realises they had the same idea.<br />
<br />
Sarah sees the face towel hanging in front of the sink&#39;s undercabinet when Jason moves the other way to look for it on one of the hanging ones and decides surprise him with one of her discoveries from last night.<br />
<br />
When Jason turns back towards the sink he can feel something brushing against his cock, and relises that the towel is suspended in it, thinking it was just a normal morning wood, he removes it from his cock only for Sarah move it around.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is that?&quot; He shouts, startled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that is something I found out I can do.&quot; Replied Sarah, in a funny tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell, I might not have a degree in Biological Sciences, but I know damn well that cocks don&#39;t do that.&quot; Asked Jason, still kind of startled over the whole thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it is one of the sideffects of having absorbed a lot of me. Looks like the surroundings of your cock have my muscles and I can also control the blood vases. Like, I think you didn&#39;t realise that it is also way bigger than your older cock too doesn&#39;t you?&quot; Said Sarah, proud of her finding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, you are right, shit, the Doc has to allow me to keep it for sure as compensation for the whole thing.&quot; Said Jason, seeing something positive from this whole thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure he will. It is only fair.&quot; Replied Sarah, trying to be nice.<br />
<br />
Jason finally finishes his oral higiene and spits on the sink, he tries his voice again, and to his surprise, it is even higher than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, shit, shit, shit.&quot; Jason starts repeating.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down dude, it is probably one of the sideeffects of having me. Your body is growing my vocal cords too. Like, in case you don&#39;t remember, they aren&#39;t on your ass, the Doctor just arranged things so I could sound like myself, but my vocals where somewhere else on your body.&quot; Sarah said, trying to calm him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, but why do I have to sound like girl?&quot; Said Jason, upset at the whole situation again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, it is easily reversable, people even pay surgeons to do that, I&#39;m sure the Doc can fix it when he removes me from you. Stop making a storm about everything, it has been only a single day, he said more changes would come.&quot; Sarah said, bothered by how much Jason has been freaking out, considering she was the one in the worst situation by far.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, OK, I will chill, but it is still shitty.&quot; Said Jason, feeling calmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, now that you finished your morning routine, what do you want to do, it isn&#39;t like we have appointments anyways.&quot; Replied Sarah, trying to nudge him into wanting to try some stuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I generally start my days off doing some excercises, since I lack my equipment jogs are out of question, I can try some calisthenics.&quot; Said Jason, thinking he should be keeping his body building, since he can barely see his muscles under all of soft Sarah flesh over them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it might be fun, I will coach you so.&quot; Said Sarah, trying to be nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat, let&#39;s go so.&quot; Said Jason, leaving the Bathroom, since he has no shorts in hand and underwear was destroyed to give space to Sarah, he decided to work out completely nude.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I will be your spotter, so let&#39;s go, 1, 2...&quot; Said Sarah, as Jason started with Burpees.<br />
<br />
As the exercises came and went, both Jason and Sarah had some fun, realising that they where barely getting exhausted. Upon arriving at the squats thought, Sarah started getting some ideas and decide to provoke Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Jason, Mike would love to help us with this don&#39;t you think.&quot; Said Sarah.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you Sarah.&quot; Replied Jason, chuckling about the joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is certainly what I have in mind.&quot; Sarah laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahahaha, you are going to make me lose balance, and you will only have yourself to blame for getting yourself a concussion.&quot; Jason laughed, losing some of his concentration.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahaha, I will keep that in mind.&quot; Sarah finished laughing, realising that he was probably speaking the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, we are finished. I&#39;m hungry, are you hungry? Because I sure need to eat something.&quot; Said Jason, feeling hungry again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, the Doctor said that there where his protein mix stored on this room. Must be on the cupboard.&quot; Said Sarah, remembering that they don&#39;t need to actually cook.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, it must be not too different from a protein shake.&quot; Said Jason, thinking about how he thinks the protein mix is.<br />
<br />
As he opens the cupboard, he sees it is actually filled to the max with large, transparent, soft pills with a white, thick liquid inside. They probably held less than a 1/4 of a cup of liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be shitting me, this is what we eat?&quot; Jason said, kind of underwelmed by the so called food he was supposed to eat.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it? I can&#39;t see it from here.&quot; Asked Sarah, curious about what he was talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, take a look.&quot; Said Jason, as he pulled one of those pills towards Sarah&#39;s &#39;face&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooh, interesting, it looks like a supository.&quot; Said Sarah, getting an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, very funny, I&#39;m not going to stick a golfball up my ass.&quot; Said Jason, shuddering at the prospect of having to put it on his ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well champ, unless you want to fill your mouth with a thick, white liquid, I doubt that you swallow it whole. I don&#39;t think it was supposed to be eaten, since he feeds those things to his test tube subjects.&quot; Said Sarah, coaxing Jason to let her try it.<br />
<br />
Jason didn&#39;t say anything, he just kept thinking for a few seconds before saying. &quot;OK, you are right, just, you know, don&#39;t turn that into a sex thing, what you did yesterday was already degrading enough.&quot; Said Jason, thinking about her shtick with Mike.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t, now let me eat for us 2 before we fall from lack of nourishment, you big baby.&quot; Sarah said, as Jason put the pill near her &#39;mouth&#39;.<br />
<br />
In a single &#39;bite&#39;, she swallowed it whole, and easily moved it to their shared stomach. Amazingly, when the outer shell broke, they felt instantly rejuvenated. It was almost like they had just got rested after a hearty meal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, that really works.&quot; Said Jason, feeling the difference on his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;It sure does, the Doctor is a genious, I can&#39;t even comprehend how the mechanics of that work, but he indeed can do miracles.&quot; Said Sarah. Having a great time thinking about how incredible the work of the doctor is.<br />
<br />
After finishing their meal, Jason decides to check on his gains on the full body mirror in their room, and realises that his body got extremely fast and visible gains. It is almost as if Sarah&#39;s soft flesh adapted to the exercises and became even more muscles. He had the physique of a body builder with very wide hips, and soft skin. He also saw that his chest way larger than normal. He now could clearly see boobs forming. Also, his finally got the clarity of mind to check on his face, seeing it was way softer and rounder than his regular square jawed face. He tried to get some encouragement from Sarah and said: &quot;Well, if I can get gains that fast, I could play The Hulk on a movie, don&#39;t you think Sarah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are more of a butch She Hulk at this point honey.&quot; Sneered Sarah, seeing the changes on the mirror as Jason posed on it with his ass turned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not for long, honestly, if the Doctor allows it, I wan&#39;t to keep this ability for sure, I&#39;m going be a superstar.&quot; Said Jason, trying to see some of the positive side of the whole thing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure. You are looking sexy anyways, boobyboy.&quot; Sarah said, trying to get a laugh at Jason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, you are just jealous that I will be getting a whole lot of pussy when I&#39;m finally out of here and none of them will be your&#39;s.&quot; Said Jason, trying to hit back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you forgot who controls the libido here, kiddo.&quot; Said Sarah, kicking up Jason&#39;s horniness to the max.<br />
<br />
After Jason fell on his knees from the heat, he started jerking off, with Sarah enjoying the whole process, finally getting a good sensation of the shaft as a whole being caressed with. She sure was enjoying finding out those new sensations. She is almost thinking if she should ask the Doctor to allow her get a cock after it all, since Jason will probably get to ask for her new additions to be kept too.<br />
<br />
After another thunderous climax, Jason falls facefirst on the floor, defeated. &quot;OK, OK, you win.&quot; said Jason, feeling the heat lowering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right.&quot; Said Sarah, gloating about her victory.<br />
<br />
Sarah could also, feel more of Jason&#39;s body, and she realised a pattern. Every time she or Jason got horny, her body regeneration got faster, and it might be connected why Jason got so much gains from just a few hours of workout. She can feel more and more of Jason&#39;s body feeling familiar to her.</p>
