<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer exited the locker room and headed back towards practice, lost in thought. <br />
<br />
She loved being on the cheerleading squad. It was the one way she was able to be social and see all the cute girls she wanted. <br />
<br />
Her stride faltered slightly as that last thought passed through her mind. Jen felt there was something off about it. Didn&#39;t she like guys? Hadn&#39;t she been all over her boyfriend Jackson for the past 6 months? Suddenly the thought of getting it on with him seemed much less appealing. He didn&#39;t have the same appeal as some of her friends on the squad were starting to possess, cute feet encased in those adorable cheerleading shoes and socks. Feet...<br />
<br />
Before she got distracted in thought again, Jen shook her head and picked up her pace. Hefting the the pom-pom bag in her arms, Jennifer managed to make it back just in time to save her position on the squad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to have you back with us,&quot; said Miss Hendricks, her voice sounding oddly calmer as she looked at Jen. Hendricks was fidgeting with the hem of her vivid yellow tank top, which seemed to have extended down from the high waist of her electric blue yoga pants, covering her crotch slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry I forgot to bring it out,&quot; said Jennifer with a light smile, trying to maintain Hendricks&#39; sudden new calmness. &quot;I was really delayed this morning. It won&#39;t happen again coach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose you weren&#39;t too late...&quot; said Miss Hendricks. Jennifer could have sworn that her coach&#39;s eyes dipped down to eye her legs. &quot;I-if you could just pass them out Jen, we can get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes coach!&quot; Jen said brightly, &quot;gather round girls!&quot; She scrunched her nose, feeling her sinus pressure building again.<br />
<br />
The other members of the team slowly queued up in front of Jen, forming a rough semi-circle. Jen lifted the bag up and held it open, holding her breath, willing herself not to sneeze. One of the other cheerleaders started forward, her hand outstretched. Before she could reach into the bag, Jennifer found herself unable to hold it in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-AH-AHH-ACHOOO!!!&quot; Unable to cover her mouth while she held the bag, she let out a big sneeze all over the approaching girl. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ugghh Gross!&quot; said the cheerleader, taking a couple steps back recoiling as she was sprayed. <br />
<br />
Jen was going to apologize, but instead found herself letting out two more loud sneezes, her neck jerking as she did. A chorus of protests and disgusted sounds erupted from her fellow cheerleaders as they all got caught in the blast zone.<br />
<br />
&quot;EW!&quot; said one girl. &quot;What the hell Jen!?&quot; said another as she wiped saliva off her cheek. A few others spit onto the grass after Jen&#39;s sneeze hit their mouths.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry guys!&quot; Jen managed as the sinus pressure disappeared again. She turned her head to awkwardly wipe her nose against one of the puffy shoulders of her short-sleeved top. &quot;I think my allergies are acting up today. I&#39;m not sick, I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls continued to grumble and wipe themselves off even as they walked forward and took their pom-poms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem!&quot; Miss Hendricks cleared her throat loudly once they were done, some of her usual attitude returning. She put her hands on her hips and splayed her legs, trying to look commanding. Jen found her eyes drawn to her coach&#39;s legs, where she vaguely noticed that Hendricks&#39; white ankle socks were slowly rising up out of her white athletic shoes. Their hems reached the bottoms of Hendricks&#39; yoga pants. Like writhing snakes, the fabric of each hem split open, intertwining together. The blue color of the form fitting pants quickly infected the merging socks, shifting the fabric as in progressed down beneath her shoes.<br />
<br />
Jen&#39;s mouth opened slightly, as if to say something about this impossible thing occurring before her eyes, but a bit of her brain suddenly buzzed. Instead she found herself admiring how those blue spandex tights really showed off Miss Hendrick&#39;s toned legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shape it up girls!&quot; said the coach, idly twisting an ankle as she spoke. &quot;Now that we have our pom-poms let&#39;s go through our routines.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls quickly lined up in formation and for the rest of the period went over their flips, kicks, and spins. Jen thought the girls were looking rather good today, strong and agile, cute and toned, they were even managing to pull off tower drops with ease. Granted the cheerleading squad had been doing them since the beginning of the year, but today just seemed to flow better than last Friday&#39;s performance at the football game.<br />
<br />
In contrast, Jen felt like she could barely keep up. Much like during the warmup squats, Jen felt rushes of pleasure each time her toes rubbed against one another or her feet rubbed the fabric of her shoes when she changed her stance. She had to try hard not to moan a few times. Her eyes were increasingly admiring her teammates lithe forms, and once or twice she almost messed up parts of her routines. During the second half of practice, she could have sworn she was getting similar looks back from her teammates.<br />
<br />
At the end of the period, Miss Hendricks waved the girls in to form a circle around her, smoothing out the skirt of her short yellow skater dress with her other arm as she did so. <br />
<br />
&quot;Girls I was SUPER happy with today&#39;s practice.&quot; their coach said, her hands clasped girlishly in front of her bosom in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You all look so cu...err great and I&#39;m sure we will wow the judges big time when we head to our first Cheerleading competition in a few weeks. I couldn&#39;t keep my eyes off your excellent fee...footwork&quot; she corrected herself, blushing slightly and avoiding their eyes as she twisted a white canvas sneaker idly. <br />
<br />
Even covered by the fabric of the shoe, Jen could tell her coach was clenching and unclenching her toes, much like Jen herself was doing right now. Jen felt a strong desire to whip that shoe off and get at those blue encased toes.<br />
<br />
Miss Hendricks brushed a loose lock of hair behind her ear. &quot;If we keep the same energy we had today and keep it going all year, I know we can take any competition with ease. Feet in.&quot; She said, extending a shapely leg. All the cheerleaders blinked in confusion for a second, but then quickly stepped forward and stuck a leg into the circle, feet bumping into and atop of each other. <br />
<br />
They put arms around each other in the circle. Jen found herself entranced by the circle of feet in front of her. Her eyes were unfocused and mouth open slightly. What she wouldn&#39;t do to get all those shoes off and rub those socked feet against one another. She began unconsciously squeezing and rubbing the shoulder of the girl to her right, her good friend Jade. Surprisingly, Jade made no move for her to stop and even leaned a bit harder into Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;One, two, three, Go Spartans!&quot; said Miss Hendricks, a girly lilt sliding into her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;ONE, TWO, THREE, GO SPARTANS!&quot; shouted the team in unison. They lifted their feet up in unison as they shouted, their energy strong and enthusiasm stronger than before.</p>
