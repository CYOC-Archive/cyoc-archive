<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A nude muscular Zeke, gleaming with sweat, grunted his final release and an equally nude and disheveled Diane cooed her acceptance and pleasure.  Zeke leaned down and gave his lover a deep passionate kiss, and she accepted it readily, wrapping her legs around her masculine lover, not ever wanting to let him go.  Zeke pulled his head back slightly, giving an incredibly satisfied grin.  Diane returned the smile of satisfaction, and they set to heavy making out again, Zeke not yet removing his still-hard member.<br />
<br />
Toby was trapped in his glass cage, a captive audience.  His panic subsided, but he remained stunned.  None of this made sense.  None of this made any God-Damned sense.  He’d just seen his friend and patrol partner David… turned into that sexy, busty female. David’s grunts turning into feminine cries of pleasure echoed in his head like an earworm.  It was all too much.<br />
<br />
Then, suddenly, the glass partition turned opaque, like with the snap of  finger.  Toby looked around in a panic.  His cell was now a dark tomb.<br />
<br />
“Officer Toby Smith,” a voice of uncertain origin toned.  It was a deeply masculine voice.  Toby looked about, remaining akimbo.  He didn’t have his weapon or his radio, but he still had his self-defense training.  And the scene he’d just witnessed gave him plenty of motivation to be wary.<br />
<br />
“No need to panic,” a form approached in the darkened space.  Toby moved away from it, until he backed into one of the opaque walls.  The space was so poorly lit, all he could see was a silhouette.  A very large and muscular silhouette.<br />
<br />
Then the lights came on.  Bright lights, illuminating the room, the walls all white, and a large examination table in the center.  And a man.  A man as tall as Zeke, with amazing shoulders and proud swollen pecs all encased in a doctors’ white coat.  He was ruggedly handsome, and blonde with salt-and-pepper in his beard and sideburns.  “I am Doctor Jack,” the man intoned, smiling friendly.<br />
<br />
“Bullshit!”  Toby spat out.  “What the fuck is going on here?!?”  He tried to run, to attack, to grab something to defend himself.  But Toby found himself immobilized.  He stood still, like a mannequin.<br />
<br />
“Safety first,” Dr. Jack nodded.  “Now, I know there’s a lot to digest here.  But we need to understand how you came to find our little… town.  I just know you’ll cooperate.”  Then with a friendly smirk, Dr. Jack snapped his fingers and Toby found himself compelled to walk forward.  Step by step, Toby unwillingly sauntered over to the examination table.<br />
<br />
“Best that you strip,” Dr. Jack advised.  Toby found himself obeying.  He breathed out his frustration as his resistance came to no use, and whimpered as he carefully folded his police uniform into a pile, and then clamored onto the table.  Toby was smaller and more lithe than Diane’s former male form had been.  He had a very hairy chest and legs, and well-honed muscles from running triathlons and yoga.<br />
<br />
“Excellent,” Dr. Jack nodded.  He ran his hand over Toby’s leg.  “Amazing specimen.  We’re very lucky to have you visit us.”  Dr. Jack put his massive hand on Toby’s manhood, and whistled appreciatively at the size and heft of Toby’s member and balls.  “Very lucky indeed.”<br />
<br />
“Let me go,” Toby pleaded, finding himself only able to whisper at this point.<br />
<br />
“You’ll soon be able to move about however you please,” Dr. Jack assured.  He put on some black rimmed spectacles, and then looked at some charts.  “But first things first.  The truth serum.”  And then, without ceremony, he pulled a syringe out his white coat pocket and injected the fluid into Toby’s neck.<br />
<br />
After Toby seized and jerked for a bit, Dr. Jack knelt down at the calming, dreamy eyed man.  “Now, tell us, human, how exactly did you find us here?...”<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Hours later, Toby came too.  He did not remember the testimony session he’d just engaged in, the revelations of every detail he’d shared about law enforcements’ tracking of the small town and it’s strange occurrences, the many men who had disappeared while traveling through the area, and the special surveillance he and David had been performing.  Dr. Jack had probed further.  Toby, free from normal distractions or even consciousness, was able to dig into his memory and recite specific IP addresses for his police force, phone numbers, comings and goings of police shifts, and even the weights, descriptions, and cock-measurements of his entire force.  Dr. Jack wrote away furiously, recording it, all.<br />
<br />
Finally, Toby’s brain was empty of any new knowledge.  Dr. Jack patted him on the head, thankful for the serum.  They could have downloaded the poor boy’s brain, but that would have taken days to analyze; much better to get the immediate testimonial via the truth serum.  It was worth the risk; Dr. Jack would never dare tell Toby, but it drove some human subjects completely insane without remedy or treatment.  Luckily, that was not the case here.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack left Toby to his nap, and went to report to his superiors on the intel he’d collected. As Toby sighed contentedly into slumber, Dr. Jack, Zeke, and several other mountainous muscle men conferred, their faces all smiling at the jackpot of info they now had, both the better conceal their town, and for the harvest of additional men they could now target.  Life was good, and Mars needed women.<br />
<br />
++++<br />
<br />
Toby was roused by Dr. Jack.  Blinking in surprise and he exited sleep, Toby found his hands and feet bound to each of the stalks of the examination table, now split out into a St. Andrew’s cross, and moved up at an angle, with Toby’s head 45 degrees above his feet.  He was pulled into an ‘x’, and still completely naked.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Toby asked, still somewhat sedated.<br />
<br />
“It’ll wear off soon,” Dr. Jack assured him as the man removed his glasses.  “We’re thankful for all the information you volunteered to us.”  ‘Volunteer’ was an odd choice to describe the situation, but Dr. Jack wanted Toby to be comfortable.<br />
<br />
“You gotta help me, Doc!” Toby pleaded, his voice rising a little in urgency.  “They did something weird to David.  We need to get out of here, get the authorities involved.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll untie you in a minute,” Dr. Jack assured him.  He stepped forward as he shrugged off his white doctor’s coat. The human breeder smelled sooo good to him.  The Martian&#39;s superior male member swung so seductively, the cock thickening with arousal.  Dr. Jack LOVED this part.<br />
<br />
Confined as he was, Toby’s eyes narrowed and his nostrils flared.  “Let me fucking go, Doc.”<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack didn’t immediately respond.  He was too busy unbuttoning and shucking off his dress shirt, revealing a massive powerful set of pec and a tight trunk.  He hung the shirt up on a hook, and turned back to Toby, now clad only in black dress pants.  They strained tightly in the crotch.<br />
<br />
“No!”  Toby struggled.  “NO!”<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack walked up to Toby.  Even with Toby trussed up on the exam table, Dr Jack towered above him.<br />
<br />
“Amazingly beautiful,” Dr. Jack handled Toby’s junk again, appreciating it like a jockey appraises a fine racehorse.  “Amazingly beautiful breeder.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t wanna be like David!”  Toby struggled at his mightiest, futiling trying to free his limbs.<br />
<br />
“No,” Dr. Jack smiled at this silly man and his silly fears.  Soon, he would express nothing but gratitude. Dr. Jack LOVED what came next. “You’re going to be come someone even better than David.”<br />
<br />
The sound of Dr. Jack’s zipper filled the room, and then Toby was mesmerized by the enormous male member that spilled out.  The pheromones that accompanied Dr. Jack’s freed cock hit him at point blank range.  Toby gasped and shuddered as he suffered an overdose of alien musk, and began to heave and jerk in sensation.  His human cock, large by standard measurements but miniscule in front of this large hulking doctor, throbbed and swung like a pendulum.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack squatted slightly to align his penis, as wide as a 2-liter soda bottle, with Toby’s.  “Take me inside you,”  Dr. Jack whispered.  Up in another room observing the proceedings on a surveillance camera, Zeke rolled his eyes.  Dr. Jack was always so formal; Zeke didn’t have the patience to ask permission like that.  As if permission was needed from these inferior humans.<br />
<br />
Drunk of hormones and not thinking clearly at all, Toby grunted, entranced by the enormous angry head in between his legs.  And then Dr. Jack lunged into him.<br />
<br />
The thrust was savage and unrelenting.  Toby’s penis and balls put up no fight at all as they were subsumed into his body by the giant dick, which kept coming, forming and plunging into the new hole in the lithe policeman’s crotch.  Toby cried out in pain and pleasure all at once, all his muscles seizing and relaxing, even his toes curling, as the giant Martian penis plunged further inside him.  It dove in unrelentingly, until Dr. Jack bottomed out, and the two found themselves face to face.  Toby gasping and moaning, unable to handle the amount of strange and foreign pleasure that consumed his every thought.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack dove in, and began making out heavily with Toby as the good doctor thrust and shifted his hips back and forth.  Dr. Jack’s black pants fell past his glutes, and Zeke was treated on the surveillance camera to his brother Martian’s powerful ass muscles clenching and thrusting over and over again in the quivering human, never stopping or hesitating.  This jack-hammering fuck was unrelenting.<br />
<br />
“OH MY GOD!”  Toby now-masculine throat cried out into Dr. Jack’s mouth as the much larger male devoured him.  Dr. Jack took this interruption as an excuse to change positions and moved into an upward dog pose, allowing gravity to assist in his savage thrusts.  OH! But this human’s snatch was wonderful! Dr. Jack reveled.  His movements became even more strong, more focused.  The entire examination table quaked with each movement.<br />
<br />
Looking down at the space between them as it opened up, Toby continued to gasp and groan.  He witnessed Dr. Jack’s cock plowing into him, again and again.  Toby could see his entire public region aflame, the skin pink, the pulsing matching his heartbeat.  As the piledrive thrusting continued, Toby saw the edges of his new gash gather and rise.  Toby had gotten enough ass in the pass from lady friends to recognize a labia when he saw one.  <br />
<br />
“What the fuck!” Toby called out, alarmed even amidst all the pleasure.  He tried to escape; his shackles jangled and the exam bed groaned.  But it was no use. “What the fuck is this, doc!!”<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack grabbed Toby by the chin and leaned in, never stopping his rhythmic hip movements. “THIS,”  Dr. Jack said emphatically, thrusting in time with his words. “IS.&quot; EVERYTHING.”  He gave another thrust, the strongest yet, and both the beings heard a squelch deep inside Toby as the cock finally bottomed out completely.<br />
<br />
In that moment, Toby accepted it. “This is everything,” she accepted it. “This man is EVERYTHING.  I am to serve HIM.” For the first time, Tomasina gave a thrust of her hips back.  Dr. Jack smiled greedily, and began making out heavily with the new woman as they began meeting each other’s thrusts.<br />
<br />
Dr. Jack pawed and cherished Tomasina’s chest as her breasts swelled into a solid C-Cup.  He gave her ass a playful slap as it swelled and reshaped into feminine curves, and Tomasina&#39;s litheness turned into an hour-glass figure.  Dr. Jack helped her hold back her brunette curls as they tumbled down onto her new decolletage.  And finally, when the time came, he cried out his orgasm into her kissing gasping mouth.<br />
<br />
Tomasina clutched to him, her restraints somehow undone during the ruckus (Zeke had been helping from his control room, and had flipped the switches).  The two were left on the exam table, Tomasina fully nude and in awe at her new opening, and Dr. Jack panting and sweating next to her, his black dress pants still bunched at his ankles.  As their panting subsided, Dr. Jack admired the beautiful and athletic woman he had created, so fit and so breedable.  He guided Tomasina’s hands to her own pussy, and together, they played with her leaking folds as they kissed heavily and gratefully.<br />
<br />
Zeke grew hard upstairs.  Diane had been a great lay this morning.  But seeing this scene made him horny anew.  It was time to set out some bait…</p>
