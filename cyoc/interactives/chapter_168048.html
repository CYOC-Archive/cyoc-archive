<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex fell backwards into a giant recess of the couch as the armrest was suddenly forward out from under them, almost to the point of being broken.  The armrest was now poorly held upright by duct tape and a few boards, while the couch had all of it&#39;s cushions completely flattened, making a indent where Alex now lay on his back, his breasts bouncing as he flattened out there.<br />
<br />
Rolling out onto the floor, Alex blinked as he got onto his knees.  &quot;What the fuck happened to my couch?&quot; he asked shocked as he took in the full breadth of damage while getting to his feet.  Overall, the couch wasn&#39;t simply laid in... it seemed somewhat crushed, as if a big boulder had resided on it for a long time and then was moved off.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s where I sleep,&quot; said David, who quickly grabbed Alex&#39;s attention from the unexpected height of the origin of their voice.<br />
<br />
Alex looked over at David, and what a sight they were.  An absolutely beautiful black mustang of a horse... nothing but sleek, well-kept black fur for the body which was mostly right at Alex&#39;s eye-line.  If there weren&#39;t a caucasian human torso where the neck should be, there&#39;d have been no doubt of it being a well-kept if perhaps not properly fed horse of such a stature.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, there was some weirdness even to the horse body, because it had covering.  The fetlocks were covered in what could only be described as kahki-pants-style ankle socks of the same color as the pants David had worn while going out.  There was also a khaki covering over their groin which was somewhere between a loin cloth and horse-butt fitting short-shorts.  Meanwhile, held up by the same brown belt David had been wearing beforehand, there was a khaki utility harness at their front which had pockets at the side like their pants had been, along with a long cloth that fell to their front between their front legs, down to just above their knees.<br />
<br />
David&#39;s tail was long and black, tied up with a gray hair-tie just as the long hair on their head now was... a centaur-style that Alex recalled from his role-play books where the head hair would often be mirrored in style to the horse-tail.  And while David&#39;s hair had always been longer, it now reached almost to the base of their human back.<br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s green eyes shifted upwards to look at David who was now looking to him, concern in their eyes.  Their face was just slightly widened, and their ears were pulled up into slender soft points with the backs of them now blackened in color to match their hair.  Those brown eyes met Alex&#39;s and he smiled.  &quot;Dude!&quot; he yelped in happy surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;This&mdash;&quot; David said, pulling their shirt down towards their human waist, &quot;&mdash;is so weird.  I feel... big and powerful... heavy, but also... like... mismatched that all that power is downstairs, though...&quot; he trailed off, using the hand of their which wasn&#39;t still holding their phone to feel their own shoulder.  &quot;I think my upper-body is stronger too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I bet your dick is huge,&quot; Alex remarked, moving up to David.  &quot;Can I touch you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My dick?&quot; David asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean... sure, if you&#39;d be OK with that,&quot; Alex chuckled.  &quot;Honestly, you&#39;re just... well, you&#39;re clearly a mustang.  Just... beautiful.  I&#39;d love to run my hand over your fur and along your tail, but... like, you&#39;re, a person and my friend, so I&#39;m asking first,&quot; Alex smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start without dick,&quot; David offered, glancing around the room.  &quot;Sorry about your couch,&quot; they offered.  Alex simply grunted.  &quot;I&#39;m sure we can fix that,&quot; they added.  &quot;Also, I bet that giant fridge we now have in the kitchen is a big power-suck,&quot; they offered as they saw it over the counter.  Reaching to the back of their head, David bumped their knuckles into the ceiling.  In fact, when David glanced up, they could see their ears were missing the ceiling by only a few inches.  &quot;Eight-foot ceiling?&quot; the inquired.<br />
<br />
Alex looked up, standing alongside David&#39;s large centaur butt.  He laughed once, then smiled.  &quot;Yeah... You might be... seven eight or seven nine,&quot; he considered, putting one hand on one hip.  &quot;So I guess... <i>technically</i> this place <i>is</i> actually big enough for the two us is...&quot; he smirked.  There was a pause, and Alex glanced at the short-shorts over David&#39;s big, solid ass.  &quot;Hey, dude... how about... just a look, no touch?&quot;<br />
<br />
David looked back toward his friend, frowning a bit.  &quot;Seriously?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you blame the transman for wanting to browsing new and interesting cocks?&quot; he wondered, reaching one hand between his own legs and waving the hand forward in the air as if he was holding up his own horse cock.  &quot;Not like I&#39;ve never seen you naked before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said that was an accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It totally was,&quot; Alex assured them.  &quot;But don&#39;t act like I wasn&#39;t still envious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; David considered, letting out a sigh.  &quot;Alright... look, but don&#39;t touch,&quot; they said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent,&quot; Alex remarked, leaning forward and looking under David&#39;s torso.  &quot;How do you reach this zipper?&quot; he wondered, looking at the bulge at the center of the khaki pants.  &quot;Wait... do <i>I</i> dress you, you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
David looked back at that point and did two things Alex wasn&#39;t expecting.  For one thing, when they tried to move their backend to meet their front end, they did a decent job of it... their horse torso shifting almost 70&ordm; in a curve to the side so that their rear was closer to their front.  &quot;Whoa... horses don&#39;t bend like that,&quot; Alex said.  &quot;Like, at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second thing David did was turn his upper torso so that his human half twisted around, not unlike how an owl might turn its head around, just not the full 180&ordm;.  It was enough of a turn that David could reach over and along their horse torso and barely reach their hands up under their lower body to where their crotch was there.<br />
<br />
Alex patted David&#39;s head.  &quot;This is crazy,&quot; he said, and David looked directly into his eyes.  &quot;Means centaurs are probably real, then, right?  Like... what weird assumptions must be made to account for centaurs putting on pants?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still feels weird, though... khaki ankle-sleeves and short-shorts with long sides?&quot; they wondered.  &quot;Seems like a weirdly lacking cover even for centaur clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zipper already in one hand, Alex motioned to the chair at the front door of the apartment where the two had previously both tossed their jackets.  &quot;You&#39;ve a caparison,&quot; Alex said mater-o-factly.<br />
<br />
&quot;A what?&quot; David asked, leaning away from their horse half and looking to where Alex had motioned.  Instead of a soaked jacket on the chair, there was instead a heavy, waterproof-looking black cloth with red and white stripes down one side of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Caparison... it&#39;s a covering for a horse that can protect from the elements or damage, commonly worn under barding... which in medieval or <i>fantasy settings</i>&mdash;&quot; Alex emphasized, &quot;&mdash;is one would describe as horse-armour.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat,&quot; David said, blinking, then looking back to Alex when the somewhat loud zipper sound could be heard and a rush of air onto their privates could be felt.  David blushed a little... until Alex made an appreciative whistle through his front teeth.  They could feel their length held back by what David assumed was underwear of some kind which Alex slowly pulled back to allow David&#39;s manhood&mdash;stallionhood to fall out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good news, you&#39;re not a gelding,&quot; Alex says appreciatively.<br />
<br />
David knew that meant castrated, and didn&#39;t ask.  But Alex looking at his dick and balls made them a little self-conscious.  It was all fun and games until you best friend/roommate was staring at your huge horse cock.  Somewhat quickly, David began to get hard at the thought... and trying not to think about it ended with them focusing more on it, and soon enough they were at full mast.<br />
<br />
Alex whistled again, moving his hands so that they were sort of measuring the length in the air.  David watched as Alex&#39;s breasts dangled there under their lower half, arms moving apart, and while Alex may have been a man in David&#39;s mind, David&#39;s groin was very much of the &#39;person with breasts is under my body&#39; mindset and their own length became much more ridged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;d say you&#39;re a respectable foot and a quarter,&quot; Alex remarked.  <i>And, also,</i> Alex thought to themselves, <i>you got hard human-fast rather than horse-fast</i>.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?  Is... is that big or small&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, I think it&#39;s at the top-end of average.&quot;<br />
<br />
David was still blushing, but Alex hadn&#39;t noticed yet.  &quot;I feel so exposed... like... wow, that&#39;s a lot of dick.  I think it&#39;s an uncomfortable amount of dick, honestly.<br />
<br />
Looking up, seeing David&#39;s face for the first time in a while.  &quot;If I was a centaur I&#39;d want bigger,&quot; he offered.  &quot;But, honestly, you&#39;ve always been a bit iffy on your appearance as a man, David.  Have you considered... either going all in or, you know, switching to the other team?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You serious?  You really think I need bigger changes right now?&quot; David wondered<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, dude?  You should definitely&mdash;&quot;</p>
