<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diana kept track of the rolls as Nora came up with a nine, a five and a Nat 20. Nora&#39;s eyes bulged; her roll had been made better with the additional roll. She fistpumped the air, while Abby looked on unimpressed.<br />
&quot;See what I mean? She just cut the warrior&#39;s health in half with that roll. Damn it, Nora!&quot; Abby slammed her fist into the seat&#39;s armrest while covering her face.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, oh yeah! Nat 20!&quot; Nora danced around as the other two friends sat amused by the sudden turnaround.<br />
Jennifer, on the other hand, was not celebrating. She had reached the middle of the hallway when it began. Her body wobbled slightly as she tried to push on. Defeated by pain and pleasure, she dropped to her knees only five feet from the upstairs landing. &#39;Welp, I fucked up,&#39; was her last thought before the changes overwhelmed her system.<br />
It began with the nine. Jennifer&#39;s impressive racks suddenly bulged, then swelled out and larger. She passed through several cup sizes, coming up on Q-cup. The growth stopped there and picked up in another place. Jennifer felt several points of pleasure below her humantaur body. Knots formed, before changing shape and pushing out into five more pairs of breasts, each the same as her upper torso&#39;s four. The last change was her cocks, to her great dismay.<br />
The lengths seemed to bulge and wobble, growing thicker in mere seconds. A line began to run up both lengths, the cocks being pulled apart from themselves. With a sound only described as a squelch, Jennifer&#39;s two pricks had doubled in number. Four large cockheads stuck out from her rear crotch, fighting for space with their enhanced lengths. However, Jen felt more underway as they all grew again. On they went, pushing further from their crotch until they poked out in front of her. She stared down the four purplish heads, each bobbing with her increased heartbeat. She felt how her lower torso&#39;s breasts smothered the lengths with feelings she had never felt before. The 8&#39; pillars of meat were visible between her front legs despite starting between her rear legs.<br />
&quot;Oh for- Jeez, those are fucking *gasp* massive. I knew that shit was about to get worse, but it had to be in the form of these?&quot; Jennifer panted, trying to not let lust overtake her. She made her way heavily down the stairs to the living room.<br />
The DnD party was still revelling in the lucky roll Nora pulled off. She was absolutely beaming with pride, as most of her rolls before the encounter had been less than helpful. Abby still sat silently, dreading her choice of allowing freebie items. Annabeth and Diana exchanged smiles; they loved it when Abby underestimated them.<br />
The first to notice Jennifer&#39;s presence near the stairs was Nora. She made no sound, but her celebration stopped. Her jaw dropped as she stared at the mutant form before her. Nora&#39;s face slightly shifted as she tried to understand why the figure before her looked slightly like Abby&#39;s older sister. The other girls had not noticed quite yet. That was until Jennifer spoke up. &quot;No one freak out. Please.&quot; Immediately, all eyes fell on her. And all of them were shaken by what they saw. A pin could have dropped three houses over and still been heard in that room. The group made no movements as if a Tyrannosaurus Rex was watching for a false move. Jennifer made the first move and stepped forward two steps. It was then Annabeth screamed. The other girls started freaking out, scrambling behind furniture and into other rooms. With one loud shout, Jennifer cried out, &quot;STOP IT, YOU BITCHES! GET BACK HERE!&quot;<br />
The house went silent again. Slowly, the other girls revealed themselves from their hiding places. Annabeth and Nora stayed behind the kitchen doorway while Abby and Diana moved inch by inch. They approached with uncertainty, unsure if what they were looking at was human.<br />
&quot;Oh my god. Jen?&quot; asked Abby.<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me. I told you NOT to roll that dice,&quot; Jennifer fumed. She crossed both pairs of arms under her upper four breasts. She was surprised at the fact she could still fold them beneath breasts bigger than her head. &quot;Now I&#39;m going crazy from these-&quot;<br />
&quot;Dicks,&quot; Annabeth gasped. &quot;Oh god, those are dicks. And they are fucking gigantic.&quot; She looked at Abby with utmost concern. &quot;Abby, your sister had four fucking cocks! And a shit ton of tits!&quot;<br />
Abby moved to Annabeth and placed her hands on her shoulders, shaking her from shock. &quot;Anna, calm down! Calm down! I&#39;m here, everything is fine.&quot; She took a moment until Annabeth calmed herself. Abby turned slowly to face her changed sister. &quot;Now, what the fuck happened to you? &#39;Cause, to be honest, you look like the internet vomited porn all over you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, it&#39;s a long story. And before I say what happened, I must ask you one last time: DON&#39;T. ROLL. THAT. DIE. Capeesh?&quot; With that said, Jennifer knelt. Her lower torso&#39;s breasts smushed the hardwood floor, the cold surface perking up all of her nipples. The girls looked at each other with bewildered faces before taking seats around the coffee table and their postponed game session. Once everyone was settled, Jennifer explained what had happened in detail. She left out the parts where she had self-pleasured her pricks but kept in that she had been hiding twice from Abby. Once they were caught up, Jennifer gave them time to dwell on what she had told them. They contemplated the legitimacy of the story but knew for certain that before them was Jennifer, but extremely transformed.<br />
Abby took the lead on the questions, starting with one that should have been further down the list. &quot;You were in that bathroom, hiding from me? What the hell, Jen? I could have helped you earlier on!&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, are you offended I didn&#39;t want to be seen by you? I looked like a freak, and I felt insecure and unsure about what you would say or do. Don&#39;t turn this into a &#39;my fault&#39; thing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just don&#39;t understand why you waited until now. Especially considering you told me you had four legs BEFORE we rolled in our game.&quot; Abby glanced at Nora, who seemed saddened by the story. &quot;Don&#39;t think that this is your fault, Nora. Jen really screwed up on her end.&quot;<br />
&quot;God, you are so... Ugh, yes, it was all my fault for getting cursed. You happy?&quot; huffed Jennifer. She twitched a little as one of her cocks throbbed. They were irritating her for release, be it sex or masturbation; it didn&#39;t help that she was heavily attracted to her sister and her friends at the moment.<br />
Annabeth spoke next, &quot;Yeah, one question about the curse: you said Kyle cursed you?&quot;<br />
Jennifer answered, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s his last name?&quot;<br />
Jennifer thought for a moment. &quot;Kyle Perkins.&quot;<br />
Annabeth went wide-eyed. &quot;Oh shit! That freak got you?&quot;<br />
Jennifer was a bit confused, as were the other girls. &quot;You know him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, he tried asking for a titty pick from me. I denied that bastard by sending him a dick pic. Oh, he was livid with me. I kid you not, he slipped ten of his own into my duotang for math. Thank god I noticed before the teacher came by. Not much to see anyways, but still was so fucking weird.&quot;<br />
The girls were stunned by the information. Abby spoke up, &quot;You&#39;re kidding me? What an asshole and a perv. Why didn&#39;t you mention that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wasn&#39;t important. He also left me alone after I threatened to post those pictures to the internet with his home address.&quot;<br />
&quot;You doxxed him?&quot; exclaimed Nora.<br />
&quot;Yep. He got scared and said he wouldn&#39;t bug me again. I still leaked those photos; I just didn&#39;t include his address, only his name.&quot;<br />
Everyone sat there staring aghast at Annabeth and she looked at each one in return.<br />
&quot;Okay then, moving on.&quot; Jennifer adjusted herself. &quot;Now, considering you are all taking this in stride, I need to ask something of you. You need to help me reverse this.&quot;<br />
&quot;How?&quot; questioned Diana.<br />
&quot;You must use this curse on me,&quot; Jennifer handed the girls a piece of paper. &quot;Say those words directly to me. I am going to answer transform, and then you will return me to normal before the curse.&quot;<br />
Abby studied the three words on the paper. &quot;Just say this and tell you to be normal? That&#39;s it?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it. Please, Abby, I don&#39;t want to be this freaky thing.&quot;<br />
Considering her sister&#39;s plea, Abby consulted the girls silently. They all nodded in agreement before Abby read aloud the words.<br />
&quot;Jen, Transform or Dare?&quot;</p>
