<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>- Valencia &quot;Vala&quot; Vixen, lvl. 28 female Kitsune Wizard (13)/Courtesan (15)<br/>
- Sardonica, lvl. 20 female Kitsune Sorceress (10)/Courtesan (10)<br/>

<br/>
(I settled on &quot;Alessia&quot; as the spelling I prefer.)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty leaned wearily against her Mistress, her head still swimming from the intense pounding and overfilling she had received. Even though her pussy ached, she found herself already dreaming of the next time Luma used her.<br />
<br />
For her part, Luma idly stroked her concubine, lost in thought. She very much wanted to go out immediately and claim what she hoped to be the Tome. However, she knew that would be a bad idea. The Witch Queen was having her watched, she knew; and even if she acquired the book she would hardly be able to open it before the Witch Queen became aware of it.<br />
<br />
The same went for sending enough of her slaves to try and take it by force. Not only would that draw her suzeraine&#39;s attention, it would leave her defenses at the Palace seriously short-handed.<br />
<br />
No, the best course of action was to send a spy. To determine if the book Tyana saw was really the Tome, and then try and abscond with it in secret. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm...&quot;<br />
<br />
The question was who to send. She considered Tyana&#39;s earlier suggestion that she and Stephanie be sent to &quot;recruit&quot; their friends. That had some merit, but she was loathe to send out either of them before they were properly settled in her brothel, especially Tyana, whom she wanted to enjoy more. Besides, they weren&#39;t really experienced, even if their knowledge of their friends would be handy.<br />
<br />
She mused over some of her other slaves. She had a number that she regularly sent out, whether to look for more potential whores or just to collect information. Finally she made a choice, and rose to her feet. She stretched, running her hands over her body, admiring her full breasts and sloped thighs. Even though she&#39;d lived for well-nigh a century in this dimension, the former male still marveled occasionally at the luscious female she had become.<br />
<br />
Then she used her tails to scoop Tyana up and set her on her feet. &quot;Come, slave,&quot; she commanded. &quot;It grows late. It is time I introduced you to your sisters in my harem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm.&quot; Ty continued to lean against her, her mind still a bit tired from her experiences. This morning -- or was it yesterday? -- she had been free, a heroic ranger. The horror of being wrenched from that and made into a foxy slave slut; followed by her submission and Mistress&#39; fucking... Actually, she was <i>exhausted,</i> and she relished the warmth of Mistress&#39; body and the tails cradling her. Even so, she remembered what they had been talking about.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the Tome?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to trouble your pretty head about it, pet; I will send someone else to scout it out and see if it is indeed the Tome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you want to see your friends again...&quot; Luma began leading her slave down the dais and towards one of the side doors. &quot;And you will; but my pleasure comes first. And I&#39;m sure you <i>also</i> want to meet your fellow harem slaves, hm? More lusty vixens for you to play with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And learn from,&quot; Luma continued as they left the throne room. &quot;The Master&#39;s spell gave you some experience as a courtesan, but believe me, pet, you have much, much still to learn about pleasing and serving your betters.&quot;<br />
<br />
They turned right, going past several open archways showing various richly appointed apartments, and the late afternoon on the rooftop gardens beyond. Although Ty was too lost in afterglow and anticipation at meeting the other harem girls to put it together, this confirmed that they were on the first floor of the upper hall -- the personal rooms of Luma Lerouge, her most honoured guests, her bodyguards, and of course her concubines.<br />
<br />
They ascended a flight of stairs, and passed a closed door guarded by two males in armour, who bowed as the two passed, steel medallions dangling from their collars. Luma pointed this out as the entrance to her own private suite. Then, a little beyond, the corridor terminated in a large set of double doors, these guarded by a pair of females, a jaguar and cheetah, who likewise bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;The harem,&quot; she announced. To the cat girls she said, petting Ty&#39;s head, &quot;This is Tyana, my newest concubine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our Mistress&#39; harem, sister,&quot; the guards said in unison. &quot;Serve her well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; replied Tyana, blushing under her fur. &quot;I&#39;ll do my best!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have already done quite well,&quot; affirmed Luma with an indulgent smile. Then, the guards opening the doors and stepping aside to kneel, she led Tyana inside.<br />
<br />
A spacious chamber with vaulted ceiling stretched out around them, sumptuous as the throne room. Erotic, inviting scents of perfume and female arousal crept up Ty&#39;s nostrils, and she felt a thrill as of coming into Paradise and finding that it was where she belonged.<br />
<br />
The angels inhabiting this paradise took the form of five vixens, reclining on couches and cushions, all gazing eagerly at Ty, ears perked at the declaration that a new slave was joining their elect number. Ty felt humbled as she looked around their shining eyes, never having felt this much love and desire directed towards herself before -- sweetly mixed with a growing heat between her legs at the naked beauty of the voluptuous femmes, enhanced but not hidden by ribbons of silk and linen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, my pets,&quot; Luma saluted them warmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, Mistress!&quot; They responded in happy chorus. One, an orange vixen in purple silks, asked, &quot;Who have you brought to join us?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma nudged Ty to step forward, The new whore did so, somewhat self-conscious; she had no jewellery, no silks, nothing but her Mistress&#39; cum on her, And her collar, of course -- proof that she <i>did</i> belong here among these beauties. She lifted a hand to finger the golden disk, feeling a little better, then placed both hands atop her breasts, posing for the inspection of her sisters.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Tyana, a former adventurer whom I purchased from the Master along with a friend of hers, a tiefling bard who shall be joining you this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooo, a bard,&quot; cooed a brown vixen, her tail wagging slightly. &quot;I&#39;ve been <i>dying</i> to have music to relax to. Thank you, Mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma nodded, smirking a little. &quot;&#39;Relax,&#39; pet?&quot; The girls giggled at the implication. Then Luma proceeded to introduce them, starting with the long-limbed, slender brown girl, who sported an additional tail.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Sardonica, a former physicist, who became a skilled sorceress and figured out how to &#39;beat&#39; the Game -- but, alas, overestimated her abilities; she was a gift to me from the Baron, another boss whose key she tried to acquire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sardonica laughed throatily. &quot;Best mistake I ever made. I&#39;ve found far more interesting subjects to &#39;study&#39; here at the Palace. I&#39;ll be happy to share my knowledge with you, youngling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this&quot; Luma indicated the busty orange vixen &quot;is Vala Vixen -- <i>the</i> Vala Vixen, whose spell you are currently enjoying. I caught her myself a long time ago, knowing I could put her lust magic to better use in my service.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi!&quot; Vala waved, still giggling. &quot;I&#39;m glad to know my heat spells are still helpful!&quot;<br />
<br />
Next she indicated a particularly tall, curvaceous and regal-looking woman with golden fur and three tails. &quot;This is Rhea, my chief concubine, a waitress whose eyes were opened upon entering the Five Lands: she sought me out freely to become a whore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better to serve in Heaven than be free in Hell... And Mistress gave me more than I ever dreamed.&quot; The three-tails tenderly touched the sheath at her groin, running it down over her own modest, white-furred package. Then she gave a motherly smile to the newcomer. &quot;I&#39;m so happy to finally see another beautiful girl enjoy this life with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And this is Alessa.&quot; The next vixen was almost pure white, with a few black markings on her limbs and face. But what stood out about her was that she had four pairs of breasts, several of them leaking through their piercings, and her stomach showed a slight rounding. &quot;Formerly Prince Alistair, of Celephais, who was given to me as a tribute after I defeated the city in a little war.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Tyana,&quot; she said softly, stroking her stomach, a shy smile on her muzzle and a blush visible in her ears. &quot;I... I look forward to... suckling the kits Mistress gives you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see,&quot; chuckled Luma as Ty rubbed her own belly, aware of Luma&#39;s fertile semen still trickling from her heat-swollen lips; &quot;I gave her special attention, making her the wet nurse for my children. She makes an excellent breeder herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then she indicated the last vixen: black, with long silver hair and pale golden eyes, white lace framing her breasts and nethers.<br />
<br />
&quot;And finally, Marie, my newest before you. Formerly a snobby rich boy whom the Master remade to fill an order I placed for a French maid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Bienvenue, ma soeur,</i>&quot; Marie bowed her head, her ears folded down submissively. <br />
<br />
&quot;She did not speak French before,&quot; Luma noted with amusement.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I must go and attend to other business. The girls will show you around; you have your own private bedroom and washroom, and the Palace servants are at your beck and call. Have fun, sweet pet.&quot; The ninetails bent down and kissed the top of Ty&#39;s head. &quot;Not too much, however. I will return before I sleep to celebrate your concubinage with a proper orgy, and I want you wet and eager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll try, Mistress,&quot; Ty giggled, a little nervous. &quot;Though you&#39;ve... kind of worn me out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing a little food and aphrodisiac won&#39;t cure. Take care of her, pets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure, Mistress!&quot;<br />
<br />
Luma nodded in satisfaction, then turned and swept out of the common room. The guards closed the doors behind her, leaving Ty alone with her new harem mates.</p>
