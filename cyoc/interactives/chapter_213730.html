<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Whatcha doin&#39; with the new girl!?!&quot; came a bellowing question from elsewhere from one of the entryways to the commons room in one of the Freshman dorms where Rachel was meeting Cynthia and the African American student that Rachel hadn&#39;t caught the name of.<br />
<br />
It made Rachel jump and made her look over to see the approaching male student. Like so many of the other students on campus, he was relatively well built, for a man, with a mop of rather unkept blond hair that took away a lot of what might make him attractive to any women that were interested. To Rachel, that really didn&#39;t work, as she&#39;d figured out she was a lesbian fairly quickly and regardless of how good the men in Moon Lake looked, they did nothing for her. Cynthia hit on a lot of the buttons that Rachel had been attracted to, though to a degree, even before she became a werecat, Rachel had been built like her mother, who didn&#39;t look out of place among many of the women in Moon Lake that she&#39;d met.<br />
<br />
&quot;D & D, Mace,&quot; Cynthia said to him with a tone of irritation, which Rachel watched and caught the scent of weredog on him, further surprising on all that Rachel had seemed to gain even when not in her transformed state, &quot;just as I do every Monday night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yeah, Rachel is new,&quot; the other guy that was at the table commented, &quot;but this is the Freshman dorms and unless you&#39;re an RA, just about everyone here will be new to the campus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s new to Moon Lake,&quot; Mace answered back, &quot;and those outside Moon Lake are weird...&quot; Mace turned to look to Rachel, seemed to sniff at her and then looked around to make sure there was no one else in earshot, &quot;even the weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, because so many of the people outside Moon Lake aren&#39;t weres?&quot; Cynthia shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because so many of them come in, get surprised by the Mandatory Were Law, flip out and then do something stupid,&quot; Mace answered back, &quot;often forcing the police to have to respond just to keep them from causing trouble for the town. Or they come in like some kind of creepy furry that just because we turn into anthropomorphic animals that we just cater to their desires. And need I remind you, Cynthia that in the dorms... we&#39;re to try and keep a lot of that to a minimum, because there will be students who&#39;ve come from outside Moon Lake and AREN&#39;T weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that last issue applies to me,&quot; Rachel spoke up, a bit weakly, but majorly turned off by the territorial vibes that Mace was giving off.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she came in because of circumstances that were hard on her outside Moon Lake,&quot; Cynthia spoke, &quot;the last thing she needs is you getting all territorial on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re supposed to be looking out for everyone in these dorms,&quot; Mace answered, &quot;not just her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Her case is special, Mace,&quot; Cynthia answered back, sounding like she was losing some of her own patience as he came down and sat in another chair near the table and eyed Rachel directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then perhaps you&#39;d like to explain this &quot;special case&quot; where a werecat with a NORMAL family moves into Moon Lake?&quot; Mace inquired as he looked directly at Rachel and gave her an indication that he wasn&#39;t going away without an answer.<br />
<br />
Rachel sighed, glanced to Cynthia and began, &quot;Well...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The club wasn&#39;t much, but it was a relatively active spot on the edge of a Florida town that had some thick forest/marsh/swamp ground nearby, though what drew Rachel&#39;s eye was the neon green lights that ran along the top of the club&#39;s entrance that read &quot;Cat&#39;s Eye Club.&quot; It wasn&#39;t the first place that Rachel had figured going to to celebrate high school graduation, but she&#39;d already been to her family&#39;s party, and it made sense to give her on again off again girlfriend Leslie the fun she wanted. After all, the two of them had had to keep things fairly secret. While her mother and sisters knew she was a lesbian, her father didn&#39;t and seemed to almost routinely go out of his way to rant on how homosexuals deliberately choose something &quot;unnatural&quot; in order to &quot;fight&quot; what was right. <br />
<br />
It was something that often lead to some of the fights between her and Leslie, who&#39;d said that her family was like her and accepted her without question. Rachel had long tried to explain that that was good for Leslie, but her father was different and was a firm enough man that being open about it would be difficult. With the family party taken care of and Leslie having accepted fair amounts of this back and forth over the years, Rachel agreed to reward Leslie for being that tolerant and patient. Though, she didn&#39;t think that the club would be the spot to go to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure they&#39;ll let us in?&quot; Rachel asked, &quot;don&#39;t they only let in people over twenty-one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s who they&#39;ll serve drinks to,&quot; Leslie answered, &quot;and we&#39;ll still be carded... but they&#39;ll let us in. Come on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel followed along behind as Leslie lead her in. Leslie could be spontaneous with these things, and it was something that drew Rachel to her in high school, though it was also something that at times made her worry. As spontaneous didn&#39;t always mean &quot;good,&quot; but for the moment she couldn&#39;t complain. The club was relatively well lit and there was some very peppy music playing from the speakers as the two of them entered. From what Rachel could see, nearly everyone in the club was female, and many were hanging out in booths or at the bar, and there were a few that were even dancing together on the dance floor in the center of the room. She thought she saw one of the women on the floor grinding her butt against the front of the skirt of her partner, which reinforced the reputation that the Cat&#39;s Eye Club catered to lesbians. The only males that were there were in serving roles, one man behind the bar and another, looking big and impressive. He was the sort of bouncer one didn&#39;t want to meet in a dark alley, and it looked like he had an old scar running along his temple.<br />
<br />
&quot;ID, please,&quot; the bouncer said, sniffing at both Leslie and Rachel. Rachel didn&#39;t notice that.<br />
<br />
Rachel dug into her purse and pulled out her ID and showed it to him at the same time as Leslie. The bouncer looked at it and then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you&#39;re both eighteen... you are free to dance and talk,&quot; the bouncer spoke, &quot;sodas and water are fine, no alcohol.&quot; The bouncer then looked to Leslie directly, &quot;and remember NO means NO.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Rachel asked to Leslie as they passed by and moved toward the dance floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the bouncer is just being protective,&quot; Leslie answered, &quot;you know... making sure no one damages the club&#39;s reputation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could see the threat of that in a gay bar in Florida,&quot; Rachel commented and the two chuckled.<br />
<br />
They danced for a while, moving about the floor with ease and with little attention to the other guests and no one came in to criticize them. It was all great, and Rachel liked it. To a degree, it was one of those things where she felt free, particularly given her father&#39;s stance on homosexuality. At times she felt Leslie was having fun too, though, there were moments where Leslie seemed to want to get closer and seemed a bit frustrated when Rachel didn&#39;t let her get closer. To a degree, Rachel had some idea on what Leslie wanted, but graduation night was not the one for that. All Rachel wanted was to have fun and enjoy the night. Eventually, Leslie relented a little and lead Rachel toward the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two Cokes, please,&quot; Leslie said to the bartender, &quot;no alcohol.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is none in Coke,&quot; the bartender answered.<br />
<br />
Leslie laughed and looked back to Rachel, &quot;having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rachel answered as she watched the bartender serve two plastic glasses filled with ice and the dark brown bubbling Coca-Cola.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you want to get closer?&quot; Leslie asked as she paid the bartender, &quot;I mean... we&#39;ve dated all through high school, gone through all your dad&#39;s crap. Wouldn&#39;t you want to... I don&#39;t know... give him the ultimate F-U?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not on graduation night,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;I&#39;m just content to dance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leslie only shrugged and then took the drinks from the bartender. Rachel didn&#39;t notice it, but Leslie then slipped a pill into Rachel&#39;s Coke and then handed it to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, may the night be fun!&quot; Leslie declared as she watched Rachel take a drink from the cup.<br />
<br />
Rachel ended up drinking a fair amount of it while Leslie drank from her own cup. The Coke tasted nice and bubbly as it went down, but it wasn&#39;t too long before Rachel began to feel a rather odd sense of things just falling away. It was like she was there and not there at the same time. She looked to Leslie, who only looked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Leslie asked, sounding concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel... off... I... I think need to go home and sleep...&quot; Rachel spoke, which she thought the bartender heard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Leslie answered, &quot;but we just got here?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; Rachel said, &quot;let&#39;s... get... out... of... here...&quot;<br />
<br />
Leslie smiled to that and took Rachel by the hand and then escorted her out. Rachel seemed to stagger a bit as they went and found that Leslie was having to hold her up before they even made it to the door. No one seemed to respond, but she thought that there were more eyes on them leaving then coming in. Once they were outside, Rachel noted that Leslie wasn&#39;t leading her back to the car but in the opposite direction and into the woods.<br />
<br />
&quot;Les... car... other... way...&quot; Rachel said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re not going to the car,&quot; Leslie answered, &quot;we&#39;re doing what you said you wanted, to get out of there. And then we&#39;re going to have fun...&quot;<br />
<br />
That was the last thing that Rachel really remembered before her mind went into some kind of a haze. The rest were sort of blurred images in which she saw the trees and other things surrounding them, with even the lights from the club going way. There were images of Leslie sweeping away a spot among several plants that looked rather soft and looking back to Rachel with green cat-like eyes. Rachel thought she saw chocolate brown fur growing on Leslie&#39;s face and creamish-white fur growing on her neck. Clothing was stripped of, and in Rachel&#39;s case rather quickly, and she couldn&#39;t fight... as she was then laid down onto the ground, not even recognizing that it was rather soft. Then there was the image of Leslie&#39;s vagina settling down, right above Rachel&#39;s face, surrounded in creamy-white fur.<br />
<br />
It was only when Rachel felt herself beginning to change and feeling a burning need for Leslie that things began to snap back into focus. But it also reached a spot where she couldn&#39;t stop. She could feel Leslie&#39;s rough tongue licking at her clit and the need to return it in kind, and that made her lick back at Leslie&#39;s clit. And this continued as the pair bucked their hips trying to get more of the other&#39;s tongue inside them. At the same time, Rachel&#39;s fingernails began to lengthen out into short but sharp recurved claws that extended from her fingers and as black fur began to grow over her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...?&quot; Rachel managed as she saw her claws extending and short black fur growing out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just let your kitty out!&quot; Leslie urged, &quot;Let us be mates, like you know the BOTH of us wanted! Because I know you love my pussy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The scent was arousing, and the need was still there, and Rachel did comply, even as her face began pushing forward into a rounded feline muzzle and her ears stretching up into points on the top of her head. She licked at Leslie&#39;s clit and nibbled at the lips of her vagina, making Leslie moan and do the same to Rachel. A part of her was completely shocked and horrified by this to a degree, and Rachel really wasn&#39;t sure what to be afraid of more. That Leslie was a werecat, who&#39;s form was based on the Siamese Cat, that she was becoming a werecat as well, based on an all black Domestic Short-Haired Cat, or that Leslie had effectively decided to rape her to get what she wanted and initiate the transformation. But for the moment, Rachel really couldn&#39;t do all that much as there seemed to be some burning need to complete her transformation, and as her feet lengthened into digitigrade paws, she thrust forward enough to lift Leslie&#39;s head up and allow for Rachel&#39;s long black furred tail to grow out beneath her. It left Leslie with a contented mew as she came.<br />
<br />
Rachel wanted to ask questions as that burning need seemed to finally go away when a flashlight and footsteps came into view and pointed at both of them. To her surprise, it was the bouncer brandishing the flashlight and coming at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Wilcox! Hands up!&quot; came the bouncer&#39;s voice as he approached with the bartender close behind. Rachel was even more surprised to see some of the other club patrons also there. The bouncer and bartender smelled... more like a canine... werewolves, to be precise. The club&#39;s patrons, smelled more like Leslie, werecats. It all left Rachel confused, and before any answers could come, Leslie bolted, abandoning Rachel and with the bouncer in hot pursuit.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And from there, the other werecats at the club confirmed that my transformation had been completed and helped me get control of things,&quot; Rachel finished, &quot;transform back, and so on. But it left me feeling betrayed. I didn&#39;t set out to be a werecat. I didn&#39;t ask to be a werecat, and at the time I didn&#39;t know that Leslie was a werecat... but because I was the only one that had ever given her the time of day through high school... she&#39;d decided we&#39;d be mates and lovers and didn&#39;t care about any other sort of niceties. I learned that when the bouncer came back with Leslie under his arm. She&#39;d clawed up his shirt but nothing she could do against a werewolf, even in human form... and who I learned was originally from Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... this werecat you&#39;d been dating effectively raped you?&quot; Mace asked, his voice now sounding a lot less hostile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;slipped me a Mickey and took me out to change me. She never asked and never said anything else... she just wanted me and made sure I couldn&#39;t say no. And I then found that I couldn&#39;t go back to being a normal human again. While grateful that I didn&#39;t lose control and just become some &quot;wild animal...&quot; that didn&#39;t mean I wanted to become a werecat that night or fully felt more in control after it. I mean... I&#39;ve always been a lesbian, so becoming a werecat didn&#39;t affect me in that department, but there are things now that often make that engine seem to fire quicker and with greater strength than before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is part of what comes with being a were,&quot; Cynthia said slowly, &quot;our libido is pretty high, and higher than the average normal human. My guess is that Leslie was feeling that and was really looking for someone that could satisfy that &quot;need&quot; for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She never even said she was sorry,&quot; Rachel said weakly, &quot;not when the bouncer caught her, not when she was turned over to the police, with a warning from the bouncer on what would happen if she revealed she was a werecat, not at the trial... nothing. And of course, because it drew police attention, my parents were called, and my homophobic father found out I&#39;d been raped near a lesbian bar/dance club and then got into an argument with my mother that led to divorce then and there. It made me glad that I&#39;d been accepted to Moon Lake College...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that before?&quot; the African American boy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before Leslie raped me?&quot; Rachel asked back, &quot;yes... I&#39;d applied here and even got accepted. Mostly because I thought it be a good change of pace and I could major in biology/ecology and study nature and all that. But... I still wrestled a bit with what I&#39;d become. Like how I couldn&#39;t even have sex with anyone that wasn&#39;t a were without turning them into a were. That the form I&#39;m in was now only half of a whole and... it was too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel took a deep breath, &quot;but that bouncer that caught Leslie and turned her over to police... he actually stayed in contact with me and my family, and was helpful after my parents divorced over my dad finding out I was a lesbian. He suggested that my mom move here with me and my sisters. Help me get things on straight, with all the instincts and so on... and that since I was a were, this &quot;Mandatory Were Law&quot; wouldn&#39;t apply.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s something Moon Lake has done with new families,&quot; Cynthia nodded, &quot;at least one member of every family must become a were... though from rumor... it&#39;s not uncommon for every member of the family to end up joining for one reason or another. They find some local they fall in love with or become more open to it over time, particularly when they find out that weres are not out of control. Leslie... she&#39;s more a case of a rare rogue were and would more than likely be criminal for the same reasons a normal human would rape someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn&#39;t that be a danger?&quot; Rachel asked, &quot;I mean... my sisters...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;d only be in danger if they run into someone with no self-control, like your friend Leslie,&quot; Mace answered, &quot;that&#39;s not really common here. We know we have a higher libido. We know that once one becomes a were, there is no going back, and we&#39;re taught by our parents, by the schools, and almost everyone to RETAIN self-control. If your sisters want to become weres, that&#39;s their choice, and any boyfriends... or girlfriends... they get, would be expected to explain things and get them the appropriate birth control pills if it&#39;s a male/female pairing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a bit of a relief,&quot; Rachel said slowly, &quot;and might make things easier for my mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what are your sisters into?&quot; Cynthia wondered, hoping to turn things away from Mace&#39;s line of questioning and hopefully give Rachel something more positive than recounting being raped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... my younger sisters are twins,&quot; Rachel said slowly, &quot;Michelle is a bit of an athlete and would be looking to get into sports... and Jasmine... well... I think her main interest is boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few grunts and groans at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... for one, Moon Lake doesn&#39;t have much of a sports program, either at the high school or here at the college,&quot; Cynthia said slowly, &quot;with most of the town being a were of some kind, even at the high school level, we&#39;d be setting sports records that would attract a lot of attention. Attention would draw people to Moon Lake in ways that many would fear, as there are some weres that have elders that remember the last real &quot;were hunts&quot; and want Moon Lake, at least, to remain a secret.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But outside of that,&quot; Mace commented, &quot;everything should be fine. Especially so long as everyone remains in control of themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like a certain weredog making someone relieve a moment of weakness?&quot; Cynthia said to Mace.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Mace then said to Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Rachel answered, &quot;there are times when I&#39;m trying to hold things together myself...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;D&D always helps,&quot; Cynthia smiled, &quot;and don&#39;t worry about Mace. Normally, he&#39;s a big ol&#39; softy. But he gets a bit touchy on memories of when weres don&#39;t control themselves. Stuff like what happened with you is one of the biggest crimes in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rape is the second biggest crime here?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turning a human without their consent is the second biggest crime here,&quot; Mace answered, &quot;rape isn&#39;t looked on fondly... and given how sex is part of completing the transformation... what happened to you probably would include rape along with Statute 1A if you were raped here instead of in Florida...but turning a normal human into a were against their will IS a big thing here. And that&#39;s what I&#39;d most worry about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you worry about the students here,&quot; Rachel said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;As an RA here, it&#39;s part of my job,&quot; Mace answered, &quot;and the Dean takes those things even more seriously.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... I promise to do my best to maintain all my self control,&quot; Rachel vowed.<br />
<br />
That got Mace to stand up and he patted Rachel on the shoulder, and looked a lot more friendly than he did a few moments earlier. Rachel even shook his had to try and show she took no offense.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all I can say,&quot; Mace answered, &quot;Maybe Cynthia here can help you find a werecat pride to join when you&#39;re done with D&D.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel didn&#39;t see Cynthia smile at that and merely followed Mace as he left.</p>
