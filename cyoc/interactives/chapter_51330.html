<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I guess I'll be a teenage nerd,&quot; Andy said, &quot;Might as well be <br />
creative.&quot; The amulet on his chest glowed brightly for several <br />
seconds, then subsided.<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, across town, Mitch was reviewing his presentation for the <br />
senior executives who would be visiting that day.  All of a sudden, he <br />
felt a weird tingling sensation start to go over his body.  He chalked <br />
it up to his nerves, but then he realized that something just felt <br />
wrong.  At first it seemed like chills, but whatever it was also made <br />
him feel very lightheaded.<br />
<br />
He decided to go to the bathroom to splash some water in his face to <br />
see if that would get him to calm down.  As he entered the bathroom, <br />
however, he felt a pain in his stomach that sent him running to the <br />
first stall.  He quickly pulled up the toilet seat and proceeded to <br />
throw up his breakfast.  His body felt weird, as if it were being <br />
squeezed tight.  He threw up again, this time causing his muscles to <br />
contract quickly.  The pain seemed to reach a climax, and then slowly <br />
began to subside.  He collapsed on the floor in the stall, exhausted.  <br />
<br />
His entire body felt different in a way that he couldn’t quite <br />
understand.  He tore some toilet paper off to wipe his mouth, and then <br />
noticed that his jacket and shirt seemed much larger on him.  He stood <br />
up as he wiped his mouth, and was surprised to see his nice dress <br />
pants fall to the floor.  He threw the toilet paper in the toilet, <br />
flushed, and then pulled his pants up.  It looked like his clothes had <br />
grown to be three or four sizes too large.  Walking a bit uncertainly <br />
in his now too big shoes, he made his way out of the stall to the <br />
sinks and the mirror.<br />
<br />
What he saw in the mirror astonished him.  He looked like a kid again.  <br />
It appeared that he was thirteen or fourteen years old.  But he looked <br />
different.  Mitch had always been a fairly trim guy, even as a <br />
teenager.  He had never been super muscled, but he looked now more <br />
like a little shrimp.  Before he could ponder his looks further, he <br />
felt his clothes begin to change.<br />
<br />
First his jacket disappeared completely as if it had never existed, <br />
and his nice white dress shirt began to shrink to fit his smaller <br />
body.  The sleeves on the shirt slowly receded to become a short <br />
sleeve dress shirt, and an ugly brown plaid design appeared on it.  <br />
The fabric of the shirt had changed to cheap cotton; as opposed to the <br />
fine dress shirt he had worn that morning.  His fine black silk tie <br />
pulled itself up to the caller, as if it were shrinking in on itself, <br />
but the knot seemed to grow larger on either side.  The color changed <br />
from black to a red with blue polka dots.  He saw the tie recede from <br />
around his neck, clipping on to the front of his shirt in a new red <br />
and blue polka dot bow tie.<br />
<br />
“What is happening to me?” he said to no one in particular.  Maybe I <br />
can just close my eyes and open them, and everything will be all <br />
right.  He closed his eyes and started to count to ten, but a shifting <br />
in his lower body caused him to open his eyes before he reached four.  <br />
<br />
The shirt and tie were still there, ugly as ever, and as he stared <br />
down at his nice silk boxers that he was still holding up along with <br />
his pants, they proceeded to shrink.  The dark blue color turned a <br />
plain white, and the fabric began to tighten around his crotch.  Soon <br />
he was wearing a small pair of white briefs.  The briefs themselves <br />
seemed to contract, and Mitch cried out in pain as it felt like his <br />
penis was shrinking.  He let go of his pants, which pooled down on the <br />
floor around his feet, and pulled down the briefs, and was shocked to <br />
see his once proud six inch member had been reduced to what looked <br />
like a little boy’s 2 incher.  Almost all of his pubic hair was <br />
completely gone, except for a few sparse hairs above his tiny dick.  <br />
<br />
“This can’t be happening!” he cried out.  A ripping noise drew his <br />
attention back down to his pants.  The nice black leather belt had <br />
ripped in two, and had pulled itself out of the loopholes on the waist <br />
of his freshly pressed slacks.  Large metal clips appeared on each end <br />
of the belt, and two of the clips fastened themselves to the front of <br />
his pants.  The black leather turned to a polyester, and brightened to <br />
a sky blue color.  As if pulled by a strong force, the two parts of <br />
the belt pulled the pants back up his legs.  As the pants started <br />
coming up his legs, they quickly changed.  The crisp black, freshly <br />
pressed slacks seemed to rib themselves, as they turned from expensive <br />
dress pants into cheaper corduroy.  The color changed from a black to <br />
an olive green, completely clashing with the light blue color that <br />
what Mitch now recognized as suspenders that his former belt had <br />
become.  The green corduroys shrank to fit his small body, and the <br />
suspenders pulled the pants up as high as they could go, above Mitch’s <br />
waist to where his bellybutton was.  If he had still had his larger <br />
endowment, this would have proven to be extremely uncomfortable, but a <br />
growing part in his mind seemed to find it quite normal to have his <br />
pants so high.  Several inches of his leg showed under his now high <br />
water pants, as the suspenders pulled themselves over his shoulders <br />
and locked in place on the back of his pants.<br />
<br />
With a sudden shift, his stretch nylon black socks started to stretch, <br />
extending from his calf to the bottom of his knee.  The fabric began <br />
to change to plain cotton, and the color slowly whitened until he was <br />
wearing plain knee-high white cotton socks.  Because his pants were <br />
pulled up so high, the majority of his high socks were showing for <br />
everyone to see.  The thickness of the cotton felt strange in his <br />
expensive dress shoes, the only article of clothing that hadn’t <br />
changed.  <br />
<br />
His shoes then began to feel strange as the heel grew in thickness.  <br />
Due to his pants being pulled up so high, Mitch had a full view of the <br />
change beginning to happen.  His shoes completely unlaced themselves, <br />
the laces disappearing much like his jacket, and in their place, black <br />
Velcro began to grow in.  The back of the shoe slowly grew up his <br />
ankle, as the last Velcro attachment fastened itself in place.  His <br />
nice expensive dress shoes had become a pair of heavily scuffed and <br />
well-worn black Velcro sneakers.<br />
<br />
He looked back at himself in the mirror, the change apparently <br />
complete.  He looked like a complete nerd!  The only thing missing are <br />
the glasses, he thought to himself sarcastically.  As if on cue, his <br />
eyes began to ache in pain.  He closed them and rubbed his eyelids <br />
slowly, but they felt like they were on fire.  After what seemed like <br />
hours, the pain subsided, and Mitch opened his eyes.  He was shocked <br />
to see that his entire vision had blurred.  His perfect 20/20 vision <br />
was completely gone.  Now he could barely see six inches in front of <br />
him.  His own reflection in the mirror was a complete blur, and <br />
although he could make out the colors, the detail was gone.  Somehow <br />
without realizing it, something had appeared in his hand.  Holding the <br />
item up close to his eyes so that he could see clearly, he realized he <br />
was now holding a pair of Coke bottle glasses with a huge piece of <br />
white masking tape holding the two lenses together in the middle.  I <br />
had to tape them after that bully, Billy Jackson, hit me in the face, <br />
a voice seemed to say inside his mind.  Wait, what?  What was that? <br />
Mitch was slowly becoming aware of another voice inside his head, one <br />
that seemed to be asserting itself more and more strongly, and it was <br />
frightening him.  Putting on the glasses, he found that his vision <br />
corrected itself, but his countenance was that of a complete nerd.  <br />
<br />
As he continued to look himself over in the mirror, a strange feeling <br />
began to work its way across his face.  He pulled himself closer to <br />
the mirror and watched in horror and large red blotches started to <br />
push out of his skin across his cheeks and forehead.  The blotches <br />
continued along his chin and started working their way towards his <br />
nose, which itself had grown to be much larger.  Larger red pimples <br />
pushed their way out of his now acne-covered face.  Another feeling <br />
started to work its way through his whole body, and as Mitch examined <br />
himself closer in the mirror, he noticed that a multitude of freckles <br />
were mixed in with his acne on his face.  He looked down at his arms <br />
and noticed that his entire skin had grown pasty white, and freckles <br />
covered his arms as well.  He could literally feel the freckles appear <br />
under his clothes across his entire body.<br />
<br />
How can this get any worse? Mitch thought to himself.  As if to answer <br />
his question, his freshly combed brown hair started to lighten in <br />
complexion, turning an orangish-red color.  His straight hair started <br />
to curl and grow unruly.  He felt his hair to make sure it was real <br />
and was disgusted to realize that it felt super greasy, like he hadn’t <br />
washed it in weeks.  Parts of it stuck out all over the place, making <br />
him look like a complete dork.  Although his hair was a little longer, <br />
his ears seemed to grow with it, and stuck out hugely on either side.<br />
<br />
Please be over…please be over.  As Mitch thought this, however, <br />
another voice spoke softly in his mind: This is how I’ve always <br />
looked.  I’ve always been a huge nerd.  Mitch shook his head in <br />
frustration.  “That’s not me!” he cried out loud.  Nevertheless, he <br />
couldn’t get over the feeling that this was how he was supposed to <br />
look.  But there were still things missing.  On cue with that thought, <br />
he felt a pain rush through his mouth.  He opened his mouth wide to <br />
see that his perfectly white straight teeth had grown crooked.  His <br />
two front teeth stuck out as huge buck teeth, and ugly metal braces <br />
now covered both levels of his mouth.  Metal wires pushed themselves <br />
out of the braces, and came together behind his head, growing larger <br />
into a large pad on the back of his neck, completing his new headgear <br />
set.  You’ve got to be kidding me!  He thought.  His large buck teeth <br />
and the headgear made it impossible for him to close his mouth without <br />
his teeth sticking out.<br />
<br />
“What is going on?” Mitch cried out in despair.  He stopped though, at <br />
the sound of his voice.  It sounded higher.  “Test…test…” he said <br />
softly.  There was no doubt about it.  His voice had gotten <br />
significantly higher, and had a marked nasally sound to it.  “Oh no!” <br />
he moaned in his new nasally voice.  “I’m a complete dweeb!”  His <br />
voice sounded like a little girl with a cold.  <br />
<br />
To complete the ensemble, a large pocket protector appeared in the <br />
pocket on his shirt, jammed full of pens and pencils.  His nose <br />
started running, and the armpits of his shirt dampened with sweat.  <br />
The feeling that he had always looked this way completely asserted <br />
itself over his original persona.  New memories forced their way in of <br />
being made fun of at his high school, his late bloomer body, and his <br />
overall nerdiness.  His mind filled with math, science, video game, <br />
and anime information, replacing all of his old interests.<br />
<br />
Mitch the fine business man was now replaced with Mitch the high <br />
school nerd.</p>
