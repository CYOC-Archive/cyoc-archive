<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kellie and Jack now appeared in Katie’s front yard, stumbling only slightly as they reoriented themselves to their surroundings. Gazing at the driveway they could see Katie had quite a few guests over. “Huh wonder what the occasion is,” Jack mused.<br />
<br />
“Your Guess is as good as mine,” Kellie shrugged. “To be honest I wasn’t even sure if they would be around. I figured though she would be on winter break and most likely home.”<br />
<br />
“So you weren’t even sure if she would be here,” Jack exclaimed. “What the hell Kel? They know your visiting right?” <br />
<br />
“Of course she knows,” Kellie yelled back. “I told her I would be stopping by in the next day or two. Now come one let’s go see what she’s up to.” As the two teens now approached they peaked through one of the windows to see what Katie was up to. “Wow she invited everyone over,” Kellie whispered. Jack nodded in response, gazing at the large group of college kids mingling inside Katie’s home.<br />
<br />
It appeared Katie and Kellie were throwing an impromptu birthday party, some balloons and streamers scattered throughout the home. At first curious who they were shocked when they saw a 1 year old Kari toddle into the room, Mika following close behind. The Kitsune child appeared mostly human with only a small set of black fox ears poking out the top of her head while a small tail swayed behind her, causing the birthday dress the child was wearing to continually ride up on her. Mika smiled, picking the small child up and carrying her to Claudia. The petite blond was sitting down, a cane nearby, as she now positioned the child on her lap in front of a large piece of cake.<br />
<br />
“It’s Karis birthday,” Kellie said curiously. Jack could only shrug as the two continued  to watch. Shiro and Jen now approached, placing a gentle kiss on Karis forehead before handing Mika a gift. Ashley followed suit along with Mary Elise and Sebastian. Claudia and Mika thanked everyone as they now looked into the kitchen. Katie and Samantha now exited the kitchen carrying several pizzas with them and calling for everyone to join them. As Kellie and Jack looked to the side they could see Mika now enter the room, cradling Tricia while the other Kellie trailed behind a crawling Morgan. The other Kellie had a serene smile on her face as she watched her daughter crawl towards everyone before scooping the laughing child up. <br />
<br />
“Did you know Morgan was crawling,” Jack asked. Kellie shook her head, she was just as surprised as he was. “No but I mean it makes sense,” she said. “Technically she was reborn in February so she would be what, 10 months.”<br />
<br />
“Do you find it ironic that we just dropped in on a kids birthday considering what were about to say,” Jack smirked. Kellie blushed, looking down at her stomach. The illusion spell she cast concealed her pregnancy but still this was going’s to be a lot for their daughter to take in. She only wished their hadn’t been as many people here when she told Katie the news. Sighing she now looked first at Jack then The front door. “Well let’s get this over with,” she shrugged. Approaching he door they now rang the bell, awaiting an answer.<br />
<br />
Katie raised an eyebrow as the bell rang. Everyone they were expecting was here already. While the group had become cautious since Mika and Claudia were attacked they had only now begun to relax. Glancing over at Shiro, Katie got his attention. Mika’s brother gave her a grim look, nodding before approaching Mike and whispering into his ear. Mikes face went from joyous to serious instantly. Handing his daughter off to Samantha, he gave his wife a gentle kiss before meeting Katie and Shiro in the kitchen. “What’s up Katie,” he asked. <br />
<br />
“I just heard the bell ring,” Katie said. “Everyone we invited is here already so I have no idea who it could be.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t think it’s another Kitsune do you,” Shiro asked. Katie could only shrug as she looked between the two young men. Shiro exhaled, leaning in to speak. “Jen heard the bell too,” he sighed. “She’s moving off to the side just in case.”<br />
<br />
“You know,” Mike said quickly. “Sammy is a lot better with magic than I am. You want me to get her?”<br />
<br />
“No,” Katie stated. “If it is the worst case scenario Sammy will be needed to counterattack. Besides Mike, she told me you’ve been getting pretty good lately.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t see how changing my skin to steel is helpful,” he grumbled. “But I’ll do my best if it’s bad news.” Nodding the three now cautiously approached the door, Shiro conjuring her katana from thin air as Mike began to harden his skin. The flesh tones of his body becoming metallic in appearance. Katie now opened the door, a look of shock on her face. “Mom? Dad?”<br />
<br />
“Hey Katie,” Kellie said. “How have you been?”<br />
<br />
“Um fine,” Katie stammered. “Um, cmon in.” Kellie and Jack entered the house, raising an eyebrow as they saw both Shiro and Mike. “I take it we weren’t expected,” Jack said in awe as he gazed at the two wizards. “By the way nice spells fellas. A mystic blade and transmutation. Pretty impressive stuff.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks I think,” Mike stated awkwardly as he began to revert back into human form. “So mom, dad,” Katie asked. “What brings you here?”<br />
<br />
“Well I did say I was going to visit,” Kellie stated. “But um, you think it could be just the three of us. You know, for starters.” Katie nodded motioning towards Mike and Shiro who now went to to enjoy Karis birthday party. “Sure mom lets head over the the back room. It’s more private.”<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded, following her daughter into the back room, which had served as a spare bedroom/office before Katie had tu Ned her into a teen all those years ago. As the three entered Katie closed the door as she now looked over her parents. “So what’s going on,” she asked. “I mean don’t get me wrong I’m glad to see you but kind of in the middle of something.”<br />
<br />
“I can see,” Kellie stated. “Didn’t realize it was Kari’s birthday.”<br />
<br />
“Well we think it’s around mid December,” Katie said. “We could never really figure it out before Kari got transformed so we came up with the 15th. The Harris And Tozawa families are throwing a family party on Saturday. We just decid d to have a party for her ourselves since we all had it off, besides it will give us a chance to plan my wedding.”<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s right,” Jack stated. “How’s it going anyway?”<br />
<br />
“Hectic,” Katie sighed. “Have almost everything planned out. It’s getting a bit expensive though.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve got it covered,” Jack stated with a smile. “Just send me the bill.”<br />
<br />
“How do you have it covered,” Kellie exclaimed raising an eyebrow. “I can help with the cost just as easily as you.”<br />
<br />
“Kellie look,” Jack said solemnly. “I was just offering it’s not a slight against you. I just happen to have more money right now.”<br />
<br />
“More like your mom has more money,” Kellie grumbled. Katie sighed as her parents now began to argue once again. “Mom,Dad,” Katie exclaimed. “Look, if you two came to argue about things then you got to go. I really don’t have time.”<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack apologized taking a deep breath as they now looked at their eldest daughter. “Sorry,” they stat d together. “We both want to help and I hope you let us. We do have something to show you though, it’s....kind of shock.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded, accepting their apologies as her  teenage parents now looked nervously at eachother. “Might as well show her,” Jack shrugged.<br />
<br />
Kellie nodded, taking a deep breath as she now ended the illusion spell on her stomach. Katie watched in wide eyed horror as her mother’s stomach began to swell. Slowly pushing out, straining against her pants as it rounded off. “I’m pregnant again,” Kellie said sheepishly. “Your father and I are having a son. Your going to have a little brother around the end of February.<br />
<br />
“Your shitting me,” Katie said. Those were the only words she uttered as she stared dumbfounded at her teenage parents. The two were constantly fighting, were way too young, and despite their immense power lacked a lot of maturity. To think we’re about to bring another magical child into this world, one that could potentially have the power of a god, was unfathomable. Rubbing her eyes she now stared at her parents, this was going to be a long day.</p>
