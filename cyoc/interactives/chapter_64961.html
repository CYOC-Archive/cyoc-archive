<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chastity sat on the toilet, horrified at what she was seeing where her vulva normally was, scared at the feeling she was feeling and the oddity of all that was happening. Beneath her, she could hear a low growing noise and puzzled by this, she sat on the toilet, breathing hard, attempting to come up with a solution as she scratched her head in puzzlement, noting that the two hard nubs on her head where even more pronounced then they had been minutes before.<br />
<br />
Again, another groaning noise came from beneath her and concerned about what she was hearing, Chastity started to force herself to get up, noting that her weight distribution seemed off for some reason and reaching down, she uttered another lowing-like groan as she attempted to pull up her pants and underwear, but instead found them to be much to tight, especially with now her genitals.<br />
<br />
Forcing her pants and underwear on, Chastity nearly screamed in both pain and frustration as her semi-erect penis became caught and then, with a loud ripping noise, the garments she was attempting to force split apart at the seams and she was left holding a couple bits of scrap-fabric that had at one time been her favourite pair of jeans and underwear. Moaning, &quot;Nooouuu!&quot; which still sound off, but was unable to place why, she dropped what she was holding and turned her attention to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Gazing at her reflection, she thought that something was off, besides the two nubs on her skull, which were even more pronounced and if she did not know any better, looked like the formation of a set of horns. Letting her gaze drift down, she thought that her shirt looked tighter and curious, she flexed her arms like what she saw the boys on the football team doing.<br />
<br />
With another loud ripping noise, Chastity watched as the sleeves on her shirt ripped apart at the seams and dismayed, telling herself, &quot;I should not have done that,&quot; she began to take the shirt off, noting as she did that it was mostly tight in the shoulders area.<br />
<br />
Naked, except for her bra, Chastity gazed at her reflection, thinking more and more that something was off and that she looked for some reason more muscular. Turning away from the mirror, she stepped over to the scale and stepping on it, she watched in horror as the dial spun about, stopped at about four hundred and three pounds, jumped to five hundred and eight and then uttered a noise as it collapsed under her feet.<br />
<br />
Backing away from the scale, scared, Chastity uttered another lowing-like noise and gazed wildly about the bathroom. Seeing the mirror and what she was still wearing, she began to angrily pull off her bra and when she was finally able to remember how it fastened, she tore it free and tossed it down onto the remains of her clothes. Peering into the mirror, she was dismayed to see that her breasts appeared to be less developed, all most as if she had regressed backward through puberty by a couple ages, and glancing down, she uttered another lowing noise as her eyes settled on her penis and testicles, thoughts about cows in estrus flitting into her mind as she did so.<br />
<br />
As she began to breathe heavily, Chastity rubbed her hand over her forehead, thought that something felt off there as well and deciding that she could not take this anymore, she turned away from the mirror and pulled open the door, accidentally wrenching it off the hinges in the process. Both horrified and scared at what she just did, Chastity hastily ran down the hall to her room, the sound coming from her feet hitting the groaning floor reminding her of the weight she had just gained.<br />
<br />
Inside her room, she sat down on her bed, shifted about to get comfortable, finally settled on sitting with her legs open for comfort and began to attempt to sort out her thoughts but did not get far as with a sickening crunch, her bed gave underneath her and she suddenly found herself sitting on the floor instead.<br />
<br />
Another lowing noise escaped her and forcing herself up, Chastity gave the matter a bit more thought before deciding that what she needed was another opinion and heading for the phone she had insisted be installed in her room, she picked it up, gave the matter a couple seconds of thought and finally decided that it was April she had been the most closet too as she began to punch in the girl's number into the handset of the phone.<br />
<br />
On the other end, Chastity heard the familiar ringing noise and after a bit, the sound of the answering machine picking up. When the machine finally made the usual beeping noise, Chastity was unsure what to say and taking a deep breath, she started to explain in a quavering voice that April needed to call her and that something odd was happening and that she, Chastity, needed an outside opinion.<br />
<br />
Hanging up the phone, feeling totally stressed out, Chastity leaned forward and buttered her head against the wall, barely giving it a second thought when the nubs on her head, which looked more like horns then they did minutes before, broke through the wall. Deciding that she was actually hungry, Chastity straightened and figuring getting something to eat my help, she headed for her closet to get something to wear, hoping that she still had something that would fit her, all too aware that not only had she increased in weight, but that her body had started to slowly change as well and with her flattening chest, she was looking more and more like a guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell,&quot; she thought. &quot;Even my posture and walk appear more masculine as she entered the closet and began to go through the clothes she kept within.</p>
