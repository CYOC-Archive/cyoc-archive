<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mia stared blankly at MaKenna after the pink light had faded, seemingly unaware of what just happened. Suddenly, she seemed to snap back to reality and looked herself up and down. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, she still looked and felt normal.<br />
<br />
“What the hell was that light?” MaKenna asked, putting the gun down.<br />
<br />
“No idea.” Mia responded. “What did you do? Something felt kinda weird when it surrounded me.”<br />
<br />
“How would I know? Neither of us have ever used this thing before, who knows what it could do!” MaKenna picked the gun back up and wandered over to Mia so the two could properly inspect it. Her attention was captured by Mia’s stomach instead of the gun. It seemed slightly bigger than usual, but she brushed it off as nothing and examined the gun. <br />
On one side of the gun were a list of switches, each switch bearing a different label. Some of the switches read things like “age”, “species”, “inflation” and “clothing”.<br />
<br />
“All these switches look like they’re turned off.” MaKenna noted. “If this gun actually does anything, hopefully nothing happened to you.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, hopefully…” Mia trailed off, seemingly distracted by something. Her stomach felt heavy and knotted, as if she were nervous. She chalked it up to the shock from being engulfed by the pink light and continued to look at the gun, not noticing her petite belly slowly expanding.<br />
<br />
The other side of the gun featured a small display screen, with only the word “Description” being shown in a small font. To the left of the screen were the numbers one to one hundred, with the arrow on a revolving dial pointing at one hundred by default. The top of the gun had yet another display screen, though it was slightly larger than the one on the right side of the gun. MaKenna tapped it, bringing the screen to life, where it displayed some kind of search engine. She used the touchscreen keyboard and pressed the letter “g”, when all sorts of results popped up on the screen, such us giraffe transformation and grape inflation.<br />
<br />
“Can you believe this?” MaKenna asked Mia. “Looks like this gun can do all kinds of…”<br />
<br />
“What?” Mia asked, her best friend trailing off and staring at her very round stomach. “Why are you looking at my stomach?!”<br />
MaKenna said nothing and continued to stare. An irritated Mia looked down and squealed in realisation and fear of what was happening to her.<br />
<br />
“MaKenna, what’s happening? I’m scared!” Mia shouted, on the verge of a meltdown.<br />
<br />
MaKenna stared at her bloated best friend. “I…I don’t know. Do you feel alright?”<br />
<br />
Mia’s hips began to widen as she burst into tears. “This does not look alright! Help me!”<br />
<br />
“How?” MaKenna responded in shock, staring at her friend’s puffed-up midsection. She gently rubbed Mia’s growing belly, trying her best to comfort her while she blew up. She gave her belly a little poke, though found it was softer and squishier than her own belly. Mia’s body jiggled, causing her to groan in frustration.<br />
<br />
“Don’t do that!” Mia yelled, in no mood to be poked and prodded.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry!” MaKenna replied meekly, her eyes widening as Mia grew larger and at a much quicker rate.<br />
<br />
Her squishy belly pushes outward and downward, weight piling on by the second. Mia’s thighs thickened and her butt began to push against her tracksuit pants. Her body had taken on a literal pear shape, though the changes were far from over. Her skin continued to stretch as something continued seeping through her body. The substance suddenly hit the top half of her body, her chest filling with…whatever this stuff was. Mia’s chest and belly became one in a matter of second, her shirt tearing into pieces and her bra snapping off at the same time a bolt of lightning struck the night sky. Mia was taking on a much more spherical appearance as she continued to expand.<br />
<br />
She soon found she couldn’t rest her arms straight by her sides anymore, as she’d become far too large. She was having trouble standing on her legs as well, waddling, jiggling, and wobbling around MaKenna’s lounge room to try and regain her balance. She was unable to find her footing and rolled onto her back, her pants ripping and feeling her limbs sink into her immense frame. She continued to grow and was beginning to worry that she would destroy the apartment, or even the building itself.<br />
<br />
MaKenna, meanwhile, stared at her best friend with her jaw on the floor. Mia’s breasts grew to the size of overinflated exercise balls, while her crotch was mere inches from MaKenna’s face. Mia’s skin was becoming more and more pale, eventually changing to a shade of white. Her chin suffered the same fate as her arms and legs, sinking into the enormous orb that was her body.<br />
<br />
Just like that, Mia had stopped growing and was laying on the lounge room floor, a huge ball of…who knows what. The apartment was completely silent, save for Mia’s heavy breathing, relieved that the transformation was over. MaKenna slowly navigated her way to her engorged friend’s stomach and poked it again, her finger almost sinking into her squishy best friend. She then climbed onto Mia’s bouncy midriff, going further until their eyes met.<br />
<br />
“Mmmph!” Mia muffled, seemingly unable to say anything, as her mouth had been engulfed by her chest.<br />
<br />
“I feel like this is my fault Mia, I’ll try to find a way to fix this. I promise.” MaKenna said sadly, hugging Mia’s breast.<br />
<br />
As she squeezed Mia’s breast, the substance that filled Mia had leaked out of her and onto MaKenna’s fingers. Curious as to what it was, MaKenna licked her fingers, the substance tasting sugary and sweet. Sort of like a marshmallow. MaKenna deduced that Mia had inflated with marshmallow fluff and became a giant marshmallow girl. Did she turn Mia into a marshmallow girl with the gun? Was it the marshmallows from the cocoa?<br />
<br />
She stumbled off Mia’s swollen breast and landed on the floor, in search of the gun, when she stopped looking. She looked at her best friend and thought that while she’s in the state she is now, maybe she could have some fun…</p>
