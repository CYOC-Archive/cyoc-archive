<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer fell down into her chair, wincing slightly as the cold metal chilled her bare backside and butt. &quot;Stupid skirt.&quot; Jennifer said as she tugged on it, hoping to make it cover her thighs to no avail. That was the price of fashion afterall Jennifer thought to herself.<br />
<br />
The teacher, Ms. Ricken was young for a teacher, only in her late twenties, she had only just finished her masters degree in teaching. She tapped the board to get the classes attention. &quot;Alright class, following last week, we&#39;ll be continuing our lesson of American history from the pilgrims.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ms. Ricken passed out worksheets and questions from the period. As she counted heads. &quot;Hmm, it seems we&#39;re missing two.&quot; She said quietly. &quot;Has anyone seen Susan or Britney? Ah what am I thinking, they are probably still in the hallway.&quot; The teacher turned to open the door, disappearing for a few seconds before returning with two others. Britney and Susan looked ragged as their clothes were wrinkled and twisted, it was quickly spotted that the two were covered in lines of cum, some fresh, some older. Guiding them to a corner the two sat mindlessly gazing around them confused as the teacher continued to speak.<br />
<br />
It was nice that the school still let the girls go to classes, even though everyone knew they were just cum dumpsters. Jennifer tried to guess why they&#39;d even let them in, maybe it was some part a hope they could actually learn, or maybe just a ploy to have the other male students content. <br />
<br />
Ms. Ricken chimmed in again. &quot;So as we know, as the boats fled from the Netherlands the interpret few landed upon the New World. Seeking, to uh, hold on.&quot; Ms. Ricken stuttered as she apparently must have lost a note sheet. She was always unprepared Jennifer thought, she had just finished her teaching certificate before coming here. But Jennifer couldn&#39;t blame her, she was only a few years older than the students.<br />
<br />
Ms. Ricken flipped the paper over before continuing. &quot;Right, sorry, uh, they were seeking to find the thingy. You know the thing with the land, freedom and stuff.&quot; Ms. Ricken wiped her brow, she was nervous at her first day teaching. &quot;They were very brave to chart the unknown waters and...uh.&quot; she paused as she gulped infront of the class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right so, I uh, have a movie to show you. Here it is.&quot; Emily, the teachers aide said as the projector lit up. The teachers aide struggled with the remote, unable to figure out the complex controls. Other student walked up and showed her the button as the video began to play. Jennifer always liked Emily, she wanted to be a teacher one day but she didn&#39;t think she could actually do it. If she couldn&#39;t even talk to her peers there was no way she&#39;d ever teach a classroom. Embarrassed by her inadequacy, Emily returned to her seat as she pulled out her notebook.<br />
<br />
As the film played Jennifer could hear moans as Britney and Susan were used by some of the other boys. Their lewd sounds were abit distracting, but they always where. <br />
<br />
As the short video finished the teacher entered the room. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late class, got held up in a call.&quot; Mr. Akenburo stated. He walked up the podium. &quot;Right so we were talking about the pilgrims yesterday, let&#39;s continue with that.&quot; The teacher looked around. &quot;Who already passed out the worksheets?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily raised her hand eagerly. &quot;I was me sir.&quot; The teacher smiled, &quot;Ah, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer rolled her eyes, Emily was a teachers pet for sure, always at his side. They used to be friends before she got caught up with school.<br />
<br />
Emily fixed her collar as she sat patiently next to the teacher as he taught the class. Her pert nipples standing at attention from the cool classroom air. She would often stare back at Britney and Susan, occasionally whinning and pawing at Mr. Akenburo&#39;s leg. <br />
<br />
As class ended the teacher moved to sit at his desk, before waving over. &quot;Jennifer, before you leave.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer gulped as she watched Britney and Susan be carted back out to the hallway, the biggest pair of dumb grins etched across their faces.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mr. Akenburo?&quot; Jennifer relied.<br />
<br />
The teacher winced as he looked down below the desk. &quot;Hey no biting, behave.&quot; He looked back up, his gaze meeting Jennifer&#39;s. &quot;Look, I just wanted to say I&#39;m glad the school is letting girls be here, but I still have to treat you like any other student.&quot; he said as a slick slurp rhythmically started to be heard under the desk. &quot;This paper you wrote was just horrible.&quot; He flipped a paper over to Jennifer. &quot;Not only was it barely legible, it didn&#39;t even answer any of the questions.&quot; His face turned to genuine concern. &quot;Look I know people want to think you&#39;re smart for a girl and all but you gotta show it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer paused &quot;You, you think I&#39;m smart?&quot; Jennifer&#39;s heart fluttered, she has tried so hard to prove she had the bigger brain than dumb Britney. &quot;You make me happy!&quot; Jennifer said naively.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you show it Jennifer, if you show it.&quot; The teacher corrected. Jennifer tilted her head in confusion. &quot;Show?&quot; She guessed as she started to pull up her shirt. <br />
<br />
&quot;No Jennifer, show with your mind. Mind.&quot; The teacher corrected again as he tapped his temple. &quot;I&#39;ll let you retake the test tomorrow after school, but that&#39;s my last saving grace before I have to report you to the principal.&quot; Mr. Akenburo gestured to the door as the next class walked in, leaving Jennifer to stagger out the doorway into the hallway. A line of girls laid across the floor all posturing to be used as each was covered in past dirty deeds. Jennifer looked up and down the hallway before shuffling to her next class.</p>
