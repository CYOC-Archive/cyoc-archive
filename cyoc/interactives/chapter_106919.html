<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max was sitting on some sort of metal go-cart with only two wheels and a mower blade behind it.  It looked a bit like a low-rider rickshaw.  He glared at Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re late!  It&#39;s time to mow the lawn!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your chore,&quot; Tony replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m ready to do it, as soon as you get out of those clothes and into your harness!&quot; snapped Max.  He held up a bunch of leather straps with metal rings, and thrust them at Tony.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta be kidding, Max,&quot; Tony said.  He couldn&#39;t believe the Chronivac did all this, when he simply meant to tweak Max to be more aggressive.  He put his hand to his mouth to cover his smirk. <br />
<br />
&quot;Put it on now,&quot; Max said softly.<br />
<br />
Okay, time to test Max&#39;s limits.  He cleared his throat, &quot;Max, you put it on me, if you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max leapt off his little seat, and pulled something out of his pocket. It was black. There was a crackling noise, and pain, oh, the pain.  Tony blacked out.<br />
<br />
When he came to he felt cool air and blades of grass touching his skin where there should have been clothing, and he felt tight leather straps cutting into his flesh.  He leapt up, Max had Tasered him and stripped him, and dressed him the harness.  He pulled two long poles up with him when he stood.  The painful straps suddenly fit comfortably. He felt reins pull at the bit in his mouth.  He heard a whip crack, and something stung his ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Gidyap!&quot; ordered Max.<br />
<br />
Tony tried to say something but there was a bit in his mouth gagging him.  He heard the blades of the mower spinning, as he walked forward. <br />
<br />
&quot;Faster, Tony, I don&#39;t want to miss The Flash, and we have to do the whole yard. So gidyap, faster!&quot;  Another whip crack punctuated the order.<br />
<br />
Tony was now jogging across the yard.  When he got to the driveway, Max pulled the reins, and steered him into a turn, and proceeded to drive him back across the yard.  It took forever.  Tony had stopped trying to speak.  He was soaked in sweat, and glad to be nearly naked.  Cut blades of grass blew and plastered themselves to his wet calves and thighs.   He stole glances back at Max.  His kid brother had his earbuds in and was obviously listening to his favorite tunes.  The moment Tony started to slow down, Max noticed and cracked the whip.  It took nearly an hour to mow the entire backyard.  <br />
<br />
Max stopped Tony, and got off the cart.  He walked behind and raised the blades up in the air.  He swatted Tony&#39;s bare right ass cheek, and said, &quot;Good boy.  Now for the front yard.&quot;  He grabbed hold of the reins next to bit, and pulled Tony toward the concrete driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmpft!&quot; Tony said pulling back against Max&#39;s grip, even though it hurt.  He was nearly naked, and it was one thing to be naked in his private backyard, but the front yard was on a main street. Everyone would see him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re thirsty,&quot; Max said misunderstanding.  He tied the reins to the porch rail, and disappeared inside.<br />
<br />
Tony struggled to get free, but Max had locked leather mitts over his hands,  and the harness limited his mobility.<br />
<br />
Max returned with a bottle marked &quot;SLAVE-AID&quot;.  It looked and tasted like Gator Ade, as Max fed it to Tony via rubber tube he attached the bit.  Tony gagged a bit at first, but he really was thirsty.  He drank it all up.  He suddenly felt a lot less anxious, a lot more relaxed.  He wondered what was in that stuff.  Tony let Max lead him around to the front yard, and was positioned with the mower blades lowered.   Max got back on, and shook the reins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gidyap!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony lurched forward.  Suddenly, he felt pressure on his bladder.  Tony stopped pulling and started doing the need to piss dance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tony, keep pulling, and just piss as you go.  I&#39;ll hose you down afterward like usual.&quot;<br />
<br />
Like usual?  How long had this been going on?  Tony would have to adjust the Chronivac settings, as soon as he got free.<br />
<br />
Tony zoned out.  It was only when Max pulled him to a stop by the fence, did he realize that he&#39;d mowed three-quarters of the front yard.  That Slave Aid must&#39;ve been drugged with something.  Tony ached all over.  The house was on the corner, and Max had stopped next to the side fence to chat with one of Tony&#39;s classmates, Roger Nelson. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Max, I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t tattooed your pony.  He-he, Tony the Pony, I hadn&#39;t realized that before,&quot; Roger said as he leaned against the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pa says I can&#39;t mark him until he&#39;s 20, and I&#39;m 16.  Then I&#39;ll get my learner&#39;s permit, and can drive him with a surrey to school.  I&#39;m planning on a nice brand right here,&quot; Max said drawing with his index finger on Tony&#39;s butt cheek. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lkf hullurrrr,&quot; was the muffled sound coming from Tony&#39;s bit. Fortunately, for Tony, Max couldn&#39;t make out that he meant, &quot;Like hell you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;m going to put either tribal tats on the sides of his arms and legs, or else flames.  It depends what&#39;s in that year,&quot; Max explained.  &quot;And I plan to train him to race.  If he wins a few purses, I&#39;ll breed him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not going to geld him?&quot; Roger asked in a disappointed tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I don&#39;t think so. He&#39;s submissive enough, I think.  If he wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d probably have to snip him.  Though his balls are a bit too tight to his dick for a pony don&#39;t you think.  Do you think they&#39;ll drop or should I use weights?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He always wore briefs at school,&quot; Roger said in a reflective tone, &quot;I suppose you&#39;ll probably need the weights to give him proper low hangers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven&#39;t gotten to that point in my Future Slave Trainers of America class yet. Roger, you trained your pony a few years ago, did you have to use weights?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I was lucky, he was already a low hanger, though the auctioneer at Police Auction said he had stretched them himself, it&#39;s apparently some sort of gay-fetish.  Soon as I found out he was gay, I had him gelded.  Though I&#39;d have probably done it because he was guilty of assault. It&#39;s cool you were able to get a pony that wasn&#39;t a criminal. No existing tattoos or piercings to deal with.  Tony&#39;s a blank canvass,&quot; Roger said in an envious tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I better get back to mowing. Don&#39;t want to miss The Flash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, I better get home. Gotta see how he handles last week&#39;s cliffhanger,&quot; Roger said waving, and walking away.<br />
<br />
Tony was wracking his brain, he must&#39;ve changed more than just Max&#39;s aggressive tendencies with the Chronivac, but what and how?<br />
<br />
The whip cracked.  He resumed pulling.  It was harder than before.  Tony was sore all over and panting, when Max finally stopped.  The yard was mowed.  But now it needed raking. Tony wondered whether Max would use him to collect the grass too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for my program. I&#39;ll unharness you afterward,&quot; Max said tying the reins to the fence post , and walking toward the house.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Muhkks?&quot; Tony called. <br />
<br />
Max turned and grinned. &quot;Still haven&#39;t figured it out, Bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While you were a statue admiring your marble smoothness in the mirror, I came in and discovered your Chronivac, and made some interesting changes. But I kept you aware of what was, and not what your new reality is, and being a pony boy is only the start. Mwahaha, oh, crap, the show&#39;s started!&quot;  Max dashed inside, slamming the door.  An insect flew by and landed on Tony&#39;s sweaty ass. He couldn&#39;t reach it to swat it. It was drinking up his salty sweat. It tickled a bit. Finally, Tony shook his bum until it flew off.<br />
<br />
Tony and Max&#39;s father drove up the driveway.  He came right up to Tony and inspected the yard.  He saw the clippings and yelled, &quot;Max, get out here now!&quot;</p>
