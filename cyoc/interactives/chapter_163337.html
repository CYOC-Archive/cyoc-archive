<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Reverend stood there as a man stymied, his only weapon was his book of scripture. The day was wearing onward and his parishioners’ were faltering, inspired by the alluring words and enhanced sensuality that devils like to use to bring people to wanting their doom. <br />
<br />
Young Jared was the first to being led away from his moral and religious convictions. As the Medallion coaxed the boy and sparked his full transformation; he became as was Jasper, a Morgan breed stallion. He was as alone when the Medallion brought about the miracle, merging Jared with the dead mindset of an animal. The Reverend did not know how the Medallion could rearrange living matter to create from a teenage boy the virtual body mass of a grown stallion.<br />
<br />
How then and why but from what the Devil said, Jared being as Jasper, let the animal mindset take control. The beast mated with Mildred a Morgan breed mare there at the farm. The subsequent mating of Mildred with Jared being as Jasper caused his transition to become as a permanent reality.<br />
<br />
The sexual altercation worked by Dolthan a devil’s made donkey Imp taunted Margery, forcing her in some fashion to wishing, want and begin her physical change, she became as a Anthropic pony mare. Somehow, as not explained to the minister, but Roberta Morrison, Marg’s husband and the parents of Jared, he too was bedeviled, changed of form and species, as became a twin of the pony mare Tilda.<br />
<br />
Robert Morrison seemed as calm and willing to accept his demeaned new self as a welcomed change. He became as Roberta, another Welsh breed pony mare and did as told by the curse-host devil, acting as subservient in every way. This situation the minister could not believe was real, he having known Robert for ten years, working with him on many church matters. All of this the Reverend was milling over in his thoughts, he feeling as helpless, watching as Jasper stood there sniffing of Margery, and she seemed as willing to give up and let the devil take her.<br />
<br />
“Keep back from the mare Reverend, don’t try to scare Jasper from his claiming the mare,” the Devil said, but the Reverend noticed a nervous flocculation in the voice of the Devil.<br />
<br />
A thought stirred what became a remembered past situation where from the lying on of hands upon a devote person’s head worked to invoke the presence of a guardian angel. Cautiously the Reverend approached Marg in her pony form. He held up a hand to motion for her to remain as calm. He tucked his bible under his right arm and reaching both hands forward, he laid them atop the furry head, as set between two quivering pointed, furred ears.<br />
<br />
“NO, NO, NO…,” the curse-host Devil yelled from within the shadowed barn!<br />
<br />
Reverend Manson began then to pray, calling upon the Almighty to intervene and save a believing person from a devilish doom. He continued to pray silently while the Devil screamed and tried to coax Jasper to attack the caring man from doing his duty. Jasper stood wagging his erect cock and still sniffing about the rounded furry rump of pony Marg.<br />
<br />
Jared was in control over the lusty ways of Jasper and he denied the Devil his desired plan to stop the minister from calling for a blessed aide to arrive.<br />
<br />
Sudden like and Margery raised her pony head and she looked back at Jasper sniffing about her tail. <br />
Marg felt an urge to do a hind-leg high kick and her hoofs caught Jasper under his chin. The harsh kick worked to dissuade Jasper and his lusty intentions, as he backed away from the angry mare.<br />
<br />
A scramble of four legs and four hoofs, and Margery took off on a fast gallop, she running headlong along the gravel driveway and ran across the road, leaped the pasture fence and continued to put some distance between her and her family farm.<br />
<br />
“Jasper, you chase after that mare,” the Devil yelled, he sounding as then oddly frantic.<br />
<br />
“Jasper and Jared, would you please go to your corral and ignore that vile devil,” the Reverend then said, as Jared in control her revered the minister and with an erect cock wagging, he walked past the barn and into the aisle between the corrals, and opening the latch to a gate, the big stud did as the Reverend did ask.<br />
<br />
“I am not without my powers and abilities to bring people to their doom,” The devil stated, but said nothing more.<br />
<br />
“God forgive, and aid they who are in need,” the Reverend said softly, being reverent to his maker.<br />
<br />
A screaming bray of a panicking donkey came from inside the farmhouse and disturbed the Reverend from his praying. As a few minutes more and Dolthan a brown furred donkey stood then as outside the farmhouse back door. A string of strapping tape still clung to his hind fetlock, and seeing of it made the Reverend to chuckle.<br />
<br />
“Dolthan, I see you have attained the grandeur of a sensual form, something you had hoped to gain from being a servant to an evil, lusty devil. You became quite a healthly big Jackass specimen to live as your future, do you like being on all fours?” Reverend Manson said as gloating at a disrespectful youth who as a donkey Imp infected his own mother, and sent Mildred to living in the Morrison farm barn.<br />
<br />
The Donkey that her son had become, Mildred knew his foul stench from where she stood, being down wind from a sweaty Jackass. Mildred whinnied of her personal disgust, and Dolthan heard well with his long ears the equine style chiding by his mother.<br />
<br />
A leap from off the rear porch to the hard ground and the new to being a full form Jackass, Dolthan stumbled, fell down with his donkey head to the ground, as did his bulky donkey body do a somersault.<br />
Dolthan laid there on his back, four legs in the air, his big donkey balls and sheath seeing the warm rays of a blazing sun. An angry mare mother then walked to her son and she did a nip-bite at the lip to his black sheath. Her nip was a hard bite and she drew blood, causing Dolthan to revive and scream a bray of pain.<br />
<br />
“Retribution is at hand for you there Dolthan, your sins are being repaid!” The Reverend said, as felt the bite was a proper way to spank a grown child for living a naughty existence. The thought of Dolthan and why he tended to stay nearby the Medallion, reminded the Reverend that the evil coin was setting inside the farmhouse on the fireplace mantel.</p>
