<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Blinking under a spotlight, Sally slowly started to come-to. Looking around, she noticed she was naked and her legs strapped down. The table she lay on was warm, but she felt a chill of fear.<br />
<br />
The room was filled with drawers and cabinets, and the door was barely visible as she craned her neck.<br />
<br />
“Subject C52 is a size medium,” a voice said. Sally glanced around and saw cameras, hidden outside of the light of the spotlight. She squinted and saw the intercom speakers. “Subject C52 is currently fertile.”<br />
<br />
Trying to process what the intercom was saying, Sally thought back to what had happened. She had been in a one night stand and then… And then what?<br />
<br />
The door opened and a man in yellow scrubs and a white apron came in. He was carrying a box about the length of his chest.<br />
<br />
“Hello, C52. Sally, yes?”<br />
<br />
She tried to focus on his face through her growing panic. “Yes,” she squeaked. He had cold dark eyes and a strong jaw. “Where am I?”<br />
<br />
“You,” he pulled a wheely table out from under where she lay, “are in a farm.”<br />
<br />
“This doesn’t look like a farm.”<br />
<br />
“It is a special farm,” he said. “My name is Frank.” He set the box down and opened it. He lay out three syringes on the table. Sally felt terror growing in her but she couldn’t muster up any words. He took out disinfectant swaps and wiped her neck, just under her ribcage, and her lower belly. She felt her skin quiver at his touch. “Now, now, don’t be afraid.” He lifted the first. “This,” he said, “Is a cow hormone.” He held her chin up and slid it in. She felt it going in but didn’t want to squirm – what if it broke?<br />
<br />
“Why?”<br />
<br />
“All part of the process.” He rubbed her stomach. “This is a…digestive assistant.” He injected the second needle where her stomach must be. “This final one is to help with the special fertizilation.”<br />
<br />
“Fertilization!” She screamed as he pushed the third and final needle into what – must – be her reproduction hormones. Finally, she found her voice. “What are you doing? You can’t! This is illegal.”<br />
<br />
He patted her stomach as one would pat a child’s head. “Shhh, once the hormones really start working you’ll be calm. He put the syringes back in the box. “Mind you,” he said, “that will be in a few days.”<br />
<br />
She squirmed. Her brown hair flopped around her face. He brushed it aside and said, “You’re very pretty, Sally. You’ll do well. Full lips, big innocent brown eyes, and quite the blush.” He flicked her nipples. “Now, for the actual fertilization.”<br />
<br />
He press a button where the table was attached to her legs lifted her legs lifted and spread them so she was in stirrups. She tried to fight it, but the machinery was too strong.<br />
<br />
He moved to one of the cupboards and pulled out a hose. He got a stand from another cupboard and positioned it between her legs. Reaching into the box, he pulled out a nozzle. “It’s sterile,” he reassured her. He attached it to the hose, and rubbed it with lubricant. He realigned the stand so it was precisely at her vagina.<br />
<br />
“Please,” she begged.<br />
<br />
“Most of our subjects actually find this quite pleasurable,” he said. He slid it inside of her. She felt it stretch her as it reached in. It was tight and cold.<br />
<br />
He slid a tape-measure around her waist. “This’ll slide open as you fill up. Isn’t that wonderful? Saves me having to keep measuring you.” She kept squirming, but he ignored her. She begged but he kept walking towards the wall.<br />
<br />
Speaking to the wall, he said, “Four liters prime sperm for subject C52.” <br />
<br />
The wall started to making a noise. “Confirmed,” the intercom said.<br />
<br />
The nozzle started to warm up, and Sally screeched as she felt something warm entering her. Frank walked towards her and placed his hands on her breasts. It felt good, and strangely relaxing, but she couldn’t stop straining to look at her belly. He massaged her gently and she felt the nozzle still going.<br />
<br />
She started to see her stomach stretching. He moved to his box and began to slather something over her stomach. “To prevent stretch marks,” he said. It was warm and felt good but she couldn’t deny the fright as her belly grew and grew. She looked pregnant already – but she was just carrying the sperm!<br />
<br />
The machine continued to pump and she felt a shiver as the warmth became quite pleasurable. Frank’s hands on her belly were arousing and he lightly touched her clitoris. It twitched under his hands and he continued as she got more and more tense. Unable to stop herself she felt herself coming and she let out an awkward squeak.<br />
<br />
“Very good,” he said. “You get such a nice redness to your breasts when you come.” He returned to her belly as the machine continued. She couldn’t find her voice.<br />
<br />
“Since the sperm is from a different species, we need to put a lot to make sure it goes through,” he said as he finished lathering her. Her belly was enormously distended, now, filled with sperm. The machine clicked and the intercom said, “Four liters prime sperm complete. Please enter in measurement.”<br />
<br />
“Sally, you began at a waist of 26 inches and you have reached a belly of….forty inches! Congratulations,” he massaged her belly and unclipped the measuring band. “You went from a medium to an extra-large in under twenty minutes.” Her belly felt tight and heavy. He lifted the stirrups even higher and said, “This will help fertilize.” He got another thing out of his box – it looked like a little mask. “This will help you sleep. We’ll keep you here for quite a bit of time. Don’t worry, we’ll have a food-tube in you to help you start gaining!”<br />
<br />
She tried not to breathe in the gas, but eventually, she felt herself drift off.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
When she woke up, she was on a bed. Her belly was slightly smaller than it had been when she had last seen it – but it didn’t feel so tight. Touching it gently, she felt it squish under her fingertips. Before it had been tight and full from the inside out. She was dressed in a tight-white shirt and tight-black leggings. When she tried to sit up, she felt her bra pinching into her. Her breasts were spilling out of their cups, a full size larger than she had been before.<br />
<br />
Slowly, she stood. The bed was large. The room was simple – a tile floor, a toilet, a sink, and a mirror. Looking in the mirror, she noticed she was bigger all over – a bit rounder of a butt, thicker thighs, and her arms felt soft. Her belly was the largest, but her breasts looked ridiculous. The straps could be seen pinching into her back. At least her face was the same – huge eyes and same hair.<br />
<br />
She didn’t feel fear or panic. Strange.<br />
<br />
“Subject C52 awake,” the same intercom voice said. A little irritated by the voice, she spun around to see the intercom. There is was – and a camera.<br />
<br />
Feeling winded, she sat down. Her belly sat atop her thighs – the sensation was strange. <br />
<br />
In pink scrubs, this time, but the same white-apron, Frank came in. She noticed he was tall and thickly muscled in the chest and shoulders. “Sally! So good to see you up and about!”<br />
<br />
“How long have I been asleep?”<br />
<br />
“About a week.”<br />
<br />
“A week?” She squeaked.<br />
<br />
“And you’re pregnant!” He patted her belly. “The gestation will be 285 days, though, so you have plenty of time.” He pulled out a little notepad. “Your belly is currently at thirty-five inches, but you seem to have jumped a cup size.”<br />
<br />
“I’ve gained weight.”<br />
<br />
“The next order of business!” He took her hand and pulled her to stand. “Time for a weigh in!”<br />
<br />
As he led her outside, she was surprised to see other women being groggily lead along by men. They, too, seemed to be a little round – but with bellies too large for the rest of them. Frank kept holding her hand as they found a line. He greeted the others nearby. “These are all new,” he said. “About a month or so in.”<br />
<br />
As they stepped up to scale, Sally felt increasingly tired. “Almost there,” he patted her back.<br />
<br />
As she stepped onto the scale, she noticed that she saw the first not-pregnant woman there. She was managing the scale. She was stick-thin, but wore all black. She smiled a huge, toothy grin as she read the blinking, “160” on the scale. <br />
<br />
“A forty pound gain!” Frank hugged her as Sally stepped off. “Congratulations. In just one week!”<br />
<br />
She didn’t feel proud.<br />
<br />
He spoke with the woman at the scale and she gave him a new bra for Sally. He also got a cardboard box and carried it as he and Sally walked along. “So,” he said, and passed her a green granola bar from the box, “I’ll be your caretaker during this upcoming 285 days. Well! 277 days, not counting this week!” They sat at a little seating area.<br />
<br />
Sally chewed the granola bar, and took another as he passed it to her. They tasted leafy but sweet. They were a little bit sticky and took a while to chew. And another. Finally, the box was finished. She felt sleepy.<br />
<br />
“What do you like, Sally? Music? Movies?” He kept her engaged.<br />
<br />
“Music.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll get you some good music. It’ll be all calm, of course.” He got her talking about favorite bands, and someone brought over another box. She ate it – this time they were circular and a darker green. They were thick and somewhat chocolate-like. When it was finished, though, she was surprised not to feel full.<br />
<br />
“Thirsty?”<br />
<br />
She nodded. She wasn’t sure what she felt, exactly.<br />
<br />
Someone carried over a jug. It had a cute swirly straw on it. He opened the jug and put the straw in for her. They sat, with his arm around her, and watched people walk by. She sucked in the creamy substance quickly, engaged by it. Frank didn’t speak that much, anymore. Sometimes he greeted people walking by and they would say hi to Sally, too.<br />
<br />
She was surprised when she finished the jug. Her belly felt tight and she didn’t know if she could walk. Looking down, she noticed her shirt had started to pull up and showed her belly. It was probably over forty inches, now.<br />
<br />
He helped her up and walked slowly. They stopped on the way back to her room.<br />
<br />
She sat down on her bed and he helped her get her shirt off over her head. He took off her bra and massaged her sore breasts. She moaned against his touch. He put the same warm moisturizer on her belly and lay her onto her back. He rubbed it on her until she came – he didn’t even have to touch her groin once.<br />
<br />
The next day, when she woke up, she noticed her belly had lost a bit of size – but still bigger than the day before. Her bra was the new one. This time, it fit – and didn’t pinch. Her breasts weren’t that big, but she felt like they weren’t “hers”.<br />
<br />
When Frank came to get her, she was happy to see him. She stood, insisting she could do it alone. He took her by her hand and lead to her the weigh machine again. She had gained six pounds. He congratulated her, took a box, and they walked to the seating area. He pulled out a little music player and said, “You can use this while you’re in your room.”<br />
<br />
She ate and drank the same amount as the day before. She wasn’t as sleepy, and he didn’t rub her down when she returned to her room. She listened to music and drifted in and out of sleep.<br />
<br />
The days continued like this. She would slowly ask him questions, which he would vaguely answer. Some days he would put the moisturizer on her and rub her – sometimes sexually, sometimes just her belly – until she orgasmed.<br />
<br />
She was gaining weight quickly. Her breasts grew and grew along with her belly. Most of the rest of her stayed the same. <br />
<br />
Eventually, she gathered enough information. She was pregnant, but also getting special hormones to help it along. <br />
<br />
They were calves growing inside of her.<br />
<br />
Frank explained he had a few other women he cared for – all on different schedules. She felt a bit jealous, but he rubbed her and she let it go. She couldn’t resist his hands, and he no longer seemed to have cold eyes. She slowly began to see them as warm, welcoming, and gentle.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, though, she would get panicked. He would give her food, and tell her it would calm her down. The chewing did. She tried to resist, but whatever it was – whatever shape, color, or texture – she couldn’t resist. <br />
<br />
One day, she hit the two-hundred and fifty mark. Her stomach was enormous, and so were her breasts. He congratulated her and told her she would be moving up to the next stage. When she asked why – pregnant was pregnant – he told her that she was one-third of the way through. This meant she would start to develop other traits. The cow babies inside her were changing her, he explained. What did that mean?<br />
<br />
“Well,” he said as he lay her down to sleep, “as the pregnancy continues, you will become more like a cow.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” She felt placid from all the food.<br />
<br />
“Then, depending on whether or not someone fancies you – we have buyers – you’ll either be sold or you’ll be pushed into a full-cow form!” He shrugged, “Some rare cases are kept as permanent breeders, but that’s only if you are truly remarkable and no one buys you.” He patted her. “But that is a long time away. You’ll only be shown for sale at the beginning of your end – all the other changes will have happened.”<br />
<br />
“Mmm,” she didn’t process that information until she woke up the next day. She felt afraid, but Frank hurried in and fed her. “How big will I get?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry,” he said. “Don’t worry.”<br />
<br />
She worried.</p>
