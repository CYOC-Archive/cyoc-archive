<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Abolith watched as her daughter anxiously paced in within the royal hall. After a fun filled picnic for the elf, she begged her parents to experience something most young human girls took for granted. A sleepover.<br />
<br />
Abolith had finally relented under the girls constant pleading, allowing the elven teenager to invite a small group to the palace. Now, mother and daughter awaited the arrival of Anjelica Kirkman, Sachiko, and Genki&#39;s sister Nanami.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to relax Stella,&quot; Abolith said softly. &quot;They will arrive shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if they don&#39;t mother,&quot; Stella asked nervously. &quot;What if no one comes? What if none of them want to be my friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
Part of Abolith wanted to respond in the most violent way possible. If someone were to cause harm to her daughter be it physically or emotionally, she would hunt the culprits down and murder them slowly. The other, more rational side, wanted to comfort her daughter. They would come or perhaps something had come up and they would try again. In this instance, Abolith choose the later.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sure they will be here,&quot; Abolith said softly, trying to soothe her daughter&#39;s nerves. &quot;Just give them time. It is still early after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella nodded, reassured by her mother&#39;s words, yet still anxious. As she looked to respond, they were greeted by a five tailed sentry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Stella,&quot; the kitsune stated. &quot;Your guests have arrived.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stella smiled, watching as Anjelica, Sachiko, and Nanami all entered. The elf girl squealed with delight, bolting towards Sachiko and hugging the celestial kitsune.<br />
<br />
&quot;You made it,&quot; she said happily. &quot;So glad you could come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t miss it Stella,&quot; Sachiko grinned, the white kit all smiles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the invite,&quot; Nanami said happily, &quot;I&#39;ve never been inside the palace before. I can&#39;t believe how big it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to brag but I have,&quot; Anjelica grinned. &quot;It&#39;s just, last time there was a war going on. Nice to be here without worrying about being attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith smirked as she watched the four girls now exchange idle chit chat. She had expected Sachiko, the celestial white kit and Stella were both very close. Anjelica and Nanami though we&#39;re a pleasant surprise. Anjelica&#39;s interactions with Fukushu had not been pleasant the last time the teenage wizard was here. Abolith worried her beloved would have frightened her off. As for Nanami, she had only met the kitsune in passing. She wasn&#39;t sure how eager the two tailed kitsune would be to attend a sleepover with a teenage elf girl and a one tail kit. Thankfully, it appeared Nanami&#39;s curiosity at seeing the royal castle had won out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stella,&quot; Abolith stated. &quot;Why don&#39;t you show your guests to their rooms.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay mother,&quot; Stella replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of curiosity where are you headed?&quot; Anjelica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have business to attend to,&quot; Abolith replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means she&#39;s on guard duty,&quot; Sachiko clarified. &quot;At least that&#39;s what Momma and Poppa always say you mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Abolith furrowed her brow, staring at the celestial kitsune kit. She wasn&#39;t wrong, she just hated this child pointing it out. &quot;Yes,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Quite right.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Abolith now excused herself, Stella smiled as she now guided her friends through the corridors of the Dragon Castle. For Sachiko, the trip was routine. Over the years the kitsune had toured the castle numerous times. Anjelica and especially Nanami though, we&#39;re still tourists. The teenage wizard and kitsune wide eyed as they walked down unfamiliar corridors enroute to Stella&#39;s bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, is that the royal family?&quot; Nanami exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Stella paused, glancing at the portrait hung upon the wall. Gazing at the painted portrait, the quartet now noticed an ancient picture depicting the royal family from centuries ago.<br />
<br />
Tatsu and Shizen sat on their thrones, the nine tail Shizen cradling a fusha colored kit in her arms. Standing towards the left was Fukushu, the three tailed kitsune soldier by his side. Next to Shizen stood twin two tailed vixen, one white and one black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow I&#39;ve never seen this before,&quot; Anjelica said in awe. &quot;Didn&#39;t realize the royal family had family portraits taken. This must have been right after Kiko was born.&quot;<br />
<br />
Continuing onwards, the group noticed a second portrait. This one was painted later, the older siblings in the same position, this time sporting an additional tail. Standing in front of her three tailed sister was Kiko, the one tail kit beaming. A definite departure from her more serious faced family. Cradled in Shizen&#39;s arms was a very chunky looking grey kitsune infant Anjelica immediately realing that infant was Chisai.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there&#39;s Chisai,&quot; Anjelica smirked. &quot;Man, he was huge even as a baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls giggled, continuing on their way as they noticed yet another portrait, this time Tatsu and Shizen holding an infant Takeo in their arms. Once more the siblings stood around their parents. Fukushu adorned in his signature red and black hikama, a heavy set two tail Chisai standing in front of him. To the side of Shizen once more stood the twins with Kiko, the younger sister sporting her mischievous smile with her more stoic expressions.<br />
<br />
&quot;They even have one with Takeo,&quot; Nanami added. &quot;And one more, that must be the latest. Looks like it was done around the turn of the century.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anjelica looked closer, seeing a date that read 1/1/2000. &quot;Looks like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh,&quot; Nanami pondered, the brown furred two tail scratching her chin. &quot;I wonder why there&#39;s no portraits of the twins as newborns or even Fukushu?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anjelica was quiet, she suspected why after Fukushu&#39;s confession during the Civil war. Those portraits most likely contained Tatsu and Shizen&#39;s oldest son Raiden. Considering the pain and the lengths the surviving family went through to not mention that tragedy, Anjelica believed the portraits were removed. Still, she discovered not want to reveal this personal secret Fukushu shared. It would also explain why no family photos existed past the last one. Both Hikari and Yomi were no longer around.<br />
<br />
&quot;No clue,&quot; Anjelica shrugged. &quot;I bet they might have been destroyed. I mean, how many wars have the royal family seen? Not to mention them moving from the mortal world to the kitsune realm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anjelica breathed a sigh of relief, the others seemingly believing her explanation as they continued towards Stella&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are there any portraits of you Stella?&quot; Anjelica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s a few with my brother around here somewhere,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s portraits of me and Raiden,&quot; Sachiko said quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Anjelica asked, somewhat curious. Sachiko nodded, guiding the group down an unfamiliar hallway. As they approached a heavy wooden door, Sachiko reached inside her kimono producing a brass key. Unlocking the door, the group now saw a small room lined with artwork and four portraits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow,&quot; Nanami gasped, slowly approaching the four portraits. The portraits on the wall portrayed four kits. Nanami and the others recognized Sachiko and Stella&#39;s brother Raiden but, the other two were quite surprising. &quot;Is that Lord Tatsu and Lady Shizen?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Sachiko smirked, her gaze resting on the portraits of a golden one tail kit and a tailed vixen around the same age. &quot;Apparently it was painted when Lady Shizen first came to the capital. They told me it was done on their first day meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I never thought I would say this,&quot; Nanami said. &quot;But they&#39;re freaking adorable!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls laughed, studying the room carefully. &quot;What is this place anyway?&quot; Anjelica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Room of the Celestial,&quot; Sachiko stated. &quot;It contains portraits of the celestial kitsune as well as artificial only celestial can touch. Technically, I&#39;m not allowed to bring in anyone outside of Raiden. So....we should probably get out of here before we get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exiting the room, Sachiko locked the door. As the girls turned, they gasped as a glowing blue eye glared at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Security breach please identify.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is that?!&quot; Nanami exclaimed in alarm.<br />
<br />
Anjelica watched as the creature emerged from the shadows. It was a kitsune, that much she was certain of. The profile of the creature was an anthropomorphic fox man possessing four tails. What was odd though was the cybernetic implants embedded in the kitsune.<br />
<br />
Anjelica noted the pieces of machinery grafted to the kitsune. It&#39;s machine parts humming in the shadows of the hall as a blue cybernetic eye focused on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur, it&#39;s me Stella.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s a cyber kitsune,&quot; Sachiko stated. &quot;Stella and I have met him before. There are two others within the castle, Atlas and Murphy. They&#39;re kinda supposed to be top secret.&quot; Sachiko and Stella now stepped forward, turning their gaze up at the six foot cyborg. &quot;Initiate scan,&quot; they commanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scanning,&quot; Arthur replied roboticly.<br />
<br />
The group was quiet as a blue light washed over both Stella and Sachiko before washing over Anjelica and Nanami. In seconds Arthur&#39;s demeanor changed as he turned to Sachiko and Stella.<br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies Lady Sachiko and Lady Stella,&quot; Arthur stated. &quot;I detected a security breach within the Room of the Celestials.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Arthur,&quot; Sachiko smiled. &quot;Everything is fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The cyber kitsune now turned, his mechanical eye resting on Anjelica and Nanami. &quot;These two are not recognized,&quot; he stated, his brow furrowed. &quot;Have they attempted to break security protocols? Shall I eliminate them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? NO!&quot; Sachiko exclaimed. &quot;They&#39;re friends. Stella invited them for a sleepover.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthur tilted his head, unsure of Sachiko&#39;s explanation as Stella now stepped forward. &quot;Arthur,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;Command override. Stella 003. Additional security clearance for subjects Anjelica Kirkman and Nanami. Conduct bio scan and record data.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scanning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anjelica and Nanami watched in confusion as Arthur once more scanned the pair, bathing them in blue light. After only seconds, the cyborg grinned as he gazed at the pair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings Anjelica and Nanami,&quot; he smiled, his voice still robotic. &quot;My apologies. You have been added to our security clearance list. May I offer you something to drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I think we&#39;re good,&quot; Nanami stuttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arthur where are Atlas and Murphy?&quot; Stella asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Atlas is currently located on the West side of the castle conducting security checks,&quot; Arthur stated. &quot;Murphy reported to your mother Abolith on the North side five minutes ago and is reporting to the East guard tower. I was enroute to the South wall when an alarm was triggered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re okay here Arthur,&quot; Stella said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you head back on patrol. Sorry to bother you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no trouble at all Lady Stella,&quot; Arthur smiled. &quot;Please enjoy the rest of your evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without another word the cybernetic kitsune turned and sped off to resume his patrol, leaving the others slightly bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that all about?!&quot; Nanami exclaimed, still shocked by the cyborg&#39;s appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;The cyber kitsune were a gift from a friend of my dads,&quot; Stella replied sheepishly. &quot;Built with 22nd century technology they help patrol the castle at night. They&#39;re nice, but can be a little freaky to see at night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I can see why,&quot; Anjelica huffed. &quot;Cyborg kitsune jumping out of the shadows was not on my BINGO card for the night.&quot; The girls giggled as Stella now led the group towards her room.<br />
<br />
Entering Stella&#39;s room after a few moments the group was shocked by what they saw. Stella&#39;s room was huge, a large bed with a canopy lay towards the back, with massive pillows, a finely crafted oak desk for school work, oak dressers, a massive flat-screen TV and a huge closet with clothes neatly hung. The room even sported a massive picture window giving the elf teen a spectacular view of not only the market but the expansive forest just past the castle walls.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is gorgeous,&quot; Anjelica said in awe. Slowly the young wizard approached the bed, finding a few stuffed animals hidden beneath the pillows. It appeared Stella attempted to hide these in order to not embarass herself in front of guests.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want to do first?&quot; Stella asked nervously. &quot;I have a TV if you want to watch a movie or we could make our way to the kitchen for something to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m kinda hungry,&quot; Sachiko said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I kind of want to see what&#39;s on TV,&quot; Nanami said, approaching the expansive television. &quot;I mean this thing is probably bigger than my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Stella said sheepishly. &quot;I..I didn&#39;t want to boast about the room if it makes you uncomfortable. We can stay in one of the guest rooms if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding, I love it!&quot; Nanami exclaimed happily. Quickly the two tailed vixen sprinted towards the canopy bed, leaping into the air before landing with a small thud. A contented sigh escaping the brown furred vixens lips as her body sank into the soft mattress. &quot;I could get used to this rich lifestyle.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls now chuckled, unpacking their belongings as they began to chat about what they should do with the rest of the evening.</p>
