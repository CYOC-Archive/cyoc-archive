<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jen came down the stairs she heard a noise coming from her father's office.  She made her way over down the hallway.  <br />
<br />
The door to the office stood open, a young man was rummaging through a bunch of folders on her's father's desk.  The handsome twenty something was dressed in a navy suit, his blond hair carefully trimmed and gelled.  She recognized him, one of the law student interns at her father's firm, he invited them all over for dinner whenever he brought in a new one, she thought his name was Michael.  She remembered him well, most of the interns her father hired were kind of nerdy, but this one was good looking.  She had tried to flirt with him that night, knowing it'd bother her father, but he wasn't up for it.<br />
<br />
Jen felt the world slow down around her.  Her heart began to beat rapidly, she needed to have this young man now, she felt a surge of emotion as she ran her eyes over him in his neatly tailored navy suit.  She looked down as her clothes suddenly vanished, leaving her standing in the hallway completely nude, then she remembered what Kyle has hit her with.  Michael had yet to notice her, in fact he seemed not to be moving at all.  At least there were worse people she could have fallen in love with.<br />
<br />
She felt a stirring between her legs and looked down.  There was a small bump on her crotch, which slowly began to push outwards, she instantly recognized it for what it was, a small penis.  It kept growing larger until she had a ten inch erection pointing out from her crotch.  A swelling below her new dick as an empty scrotum formed.  A stirring in her gut and a pair of golf ball sized balls dropped and made her moan.  Her mind was racing, trying to figure out what was happening.  Kyle had said she'd change to make the romance possible.. and now she knew why he hadn't responded to her flirting that evening, women just weren't his thing.<br />
<br />
She felt a pressure on her chest as her breasts began to deflate, sinking into her chest, her large nipples shrinking to what they were before she her breast had grown.  She felt a grinding in her bones as she began to grow bigger.  Her legs stretched longer as he hips narrowed.  Her arms elongated as her shoulders began to broaden.  She grew almost a foot in height, now well over six feet tall.  Her hands a feet grew larger and more masculine.  She turned to look at the hallway mirror, she looked like a tall effeminate man now, but even as she watched more changes came over her.  Her face became sharper, a more squared jaw, thicker brow, overall a more rugged masculine face, it still had a family resemblance, like it belonged to an older brother, or a younger version of her father.<br />
<br />
Muscles began to swell her body even further, her chest once more pushing out in twin mounds, but this time sold plates of muscle.  Her abs became harder, a six pack becoming well defined.  The growing muscle began to swell her shoulders, then down her arms.  Similar growth of muscle firmed up her ass, and continued down her legs, becoming thick and solid.  She he was built like a professional athlete, 6'4&quot; of solid muscle.<br />
<br />
All the hair she shaved off, basically everything that wasn't on her head, began to grow back in, thicker and darker too.  A dark bush grew in around her still erect penis.  Her leg hair darkened, first covering her lower leg and growing up her thighs, even a fine coating covering her ass cheeks.  Her forearms and the back of her hands grew a fine coating of hair too, also her underarm hair growing in thick and dark.  Her pubic hair kept thickening and spreading, growing up her stomach and over her six pack, not thick enough to conceal the muscle definition but still a nice pelt.  It continued to grow up and onto her chest, fanning out to cover her two pecs.  Her jaw itched as stubble grew in.  Her blond hair retracted into her scalp darkening to a deep brown, forming into a short buzz cut.<br />
<br />
New memories began to flood her mind as her current ones faded slightly drifting into the back of her mind.  Jennifer was fading, being replaced by James.  Her parent were still the same two people, only they no longer had a seventeen year old daughter in high school, they had a twenty two year old son in med school, who made his way through pre med on an athletic scholarship for football.  He had been scouted for professional teams, but he had always wanted to be a doctor, he did football to stay in shape, and even now that he wasn't playing he lifted weights everyday.<br />
<br />
The entire change had only taken the amount of time it took for Jen, now James to walks down the hallway.  He leaned on the door frame, making a small cough to get Michael's attention.  The intern finally looked up, his eyes going wide as he saw the completely naked James standing there in the doorway.  He looked away, but a little too late, the eyes lingered just long enough.  Michael grabbed one of the folders on the desk, and held it at groin level.  &quot;Sorry, I didn't realise anyone was here. Ah.. you might want to uh..&quot;<br />
<br />
James interrupted him, &quot;Cover up?  Sorry, I usually walk around the house naked when no one's home.&quot;  Jen never did, but the new memories in his head told him James did.  Still he made no move to cover himself up.  Instead he walked closer to Michael, who backed away slowly, into a corner.  James placed one hand against the wall as he leaned in close towards hims. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Is it making you uncomfortable?  How about instead of me putting on clothes, you take yours off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you've got the wrong idea about me.&quot;  Michael tried to keep his eyes off James' body, but the kept drifting back over the hairy chest, and the large cock now poking against the folder he was using to cover his own arousal.<br />
<br />
James laughed, &quot;Please, you couldn't keep your eyes off me that time you were over for dinner.&quot;  Another altered memory.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention..&quot; James slipped his hand under the folder and cupped Michael's buldge, giving it a firm squeeze and causing the law student to moan.  James pressed his lips against Michael's open mouth, at first he resisted the deep French kiss, but soon he was returning it with just as much vigor.  James pulled off Michael's jacket and started working at the shirt while Michael worked at his own pants.  His pants and boxers hit the floor just as James pulled off the shirt.  He ran his hands over Michaels chest, slender but with the muscle tone of a swimmer.  Just a touch of blond chest hair between pecs and around the nipples.<br />
<br />
James pulled Michael to the floor, and turned him around.  Michael's chest lay against the hard wood floor ass in the air.  James positioned himself behind him and lined up his drooling cock, rubbing the pre down his shaft and then with a quick thrust drove it down Michael's hole.  Michael grunted in pain, but as James began pulling out and thrusting back in the grunts turned to moans.  James gripped Michael's throbbing cock, stroking it in time with his own thrusts, Michael pushing back against James with every thrust into him.  James felt his first orgasm as a male building up, filling Michael with his seed, Michael's own cock twitched as he emptied his load onto the floor.<br />
<br />
The two men rolled onto their sides, James still buried to the hilt in Michael.  The two laid on the floor for a while, simply bathing in the musky smell of sex and eachother's touch.  Michael finally spoke up.  &quot;My god.. I..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you and I go grab something to eat?&quot;  James unentwined himself from Michael and sat up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to get those files back to your father.. but uh, call me tonight and we'll meet up for.. more.&quot;  Michael stood up, redressing himself, but the clean crisp look was gone, Michael now looking slightly disheveled which made him even more attractive.  With one more kiss for James he left and drove off.  The nude James watching from the window marveling at the newfound emotion in him.  Kyle had been right, Jen hadn't known love, but James did, and that gave him and idea.  He ran upstairs to his room which had also changed, putting on some of the altered clothes in the closet and left the house.</p>
