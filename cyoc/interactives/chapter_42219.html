<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyriel blinked a few times, then stared for a few moment, then burst out laughing as she <br />
floated backwards hugging her sides. <br />
<br />
As a rule, only the lowest of the angelic host could solidly manifest in the material <br />
universe least the collateral damage from the exercise of their power resulted in a <br />
extinction level event. As such, Michael had never had a face, mouth, eyes or other things <br />
related to having a spiritual self image developed as a side effect of physical life. But he <br />
was as easily able to convey his emotions and concepts easier than any mortal form of <br />
communication and in less than a nano-second Kyriel fully understood the archangels' <br />
confusion, and in the same nano-second Michael felt Kyriel meant no disrespect or slight. <br />
<br />
&quot;What is so humorous?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Charlene, that is the name Karther gave to one if his victims when he kidnapped men to <br />
get around his agreement to not kidnap any women for his harem. She one of the two who <br />
chose to return to her old life such as it was.&quot; Why did they all go along with the names <br />
Karther chose for them? Well, except for Anne whose now Akira/Akane... It was just one <br />
more branding and mark authority the fox prince had over them. Perhaps because they <br />
had all become a sisterhood -with- those name so there was no point in alienating each <br />
other by changing them. That's what Janice/Jack's memories imply at least.'  <br />
<br />
Michael then also laughed, &quot;So it is, so it is, and you believe out of all the women in <br />
London that this is the same Charlene?&quot;<br />
<br />
The cherub put her hands on her hips and floated up to even sight with the superior angel, <br />
&quot;One of my parents might have been a human soul, but I'm a Messenger through and <br />
through. I can see the identity that exists beyond a tack on sound as well as any <br />
Messenger.&quot; Kyriel said a microgram insulted. <br />
<br />
 &quot;So you can, so you can. And I did not speak to imply otherwise. But do not blindly <br />
assume your other parent's heritage and memories do not effect you cherub.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir. So I am to be assigned to one of my aunts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. One of the ones you have yet to meet face to face. You may chose to manifest <br />
materially to her at the time of your choosing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What of my aunts who had chosen to become Messengers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are each considering the best way to tell their loved ones fair well for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Until their human loved ones die of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh of course.&quot; Kyriel nodded in perfect understanding and acceptance. Though she fully <br />
knew Janice/Jack would be very disturbed by at the causal way it was talked of, and that in <br />
of itself disturbed her.  She had HAD inherited traits from Jack/Jance as Michael as said <br />
right? She hadn't been born completely from Tabra/Tabris right? She'd be nothing but a <br />
thief if all of Jack/Janice's traits had been lost to the winds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyriel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you do not wish others to hear your thoughts then do not speak so loudly. There is <br />
nothing remotely human about your four aunts save for their memories. -YOU- have more <br />
human traits than they do. Do not distract yourself by thinking you are somehow not also <br />
your parent's child, you were born in conflict and one of your parents often found himself <br />
in conflict, it is natural you would rely more on his traits when you were first born.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; Kyriel crossing her hands folded her wings closed her eyes and bowed. &quot;No <br />
assignment is given at random, so I assume I've been assigned to my aunt with another <br />
purpose?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That purpose if it does so exist for you to find and discover. Your supervisor's purpose <br />
shall be to teach and support you, but all interaction with the material universe shall be up <br />
to you entirely save in case of emergency or in defense of you from rogues and rebels.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;And learn an acknowledgment other than 'yes sir' silly cherub!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall be done.&quot; A lingering thought occurred to Kyriel. 'What about my grandparents? I <br />
should meet them just once at least. I know Tommy gave his word that he'd tell them what <br />
happened to Jack personally, but, they're my grandparents all the same, I should honor <br />
them by seeing them at least once while they're still alive. Maybe once Charlene gives birth <br />
and her offspring proves healthy I can ask for a short stand in to visit my grandparents in <br />
a vision.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind on task at hand silly cherub!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes sir!... Oops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Michael ruffled her hair. &quot;Knowledge you may have cherub, but you have much to <br />
experience first hand.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
It was a beautiful day on the roof of the shrine. The flower garden everyone was sure was <br />
going to die of disease had spring back to life now in the colors of the rainbow. A con <br />
man who had come through the settlement hoping for a quick buck was exposed when his <br />
own money revealed him to be a snake oil salesman. Then, to the con man's eyes at least, <br />
everyone in town was suddenly a giant snake and felt in terror leaving his 'talking' money <br />
behind. And of course there was the boy whose kite go caught in the tree and the tree <br />
handed it back to him!  Keiko knew she could have changed the boy into a monkey to get <br />
his kite back, but Keiko saw no reason to disrupt the peaceful simple lives of the humans <br />
and mortal mythicals under her jurisdiction. they provided her with offerings in return for <br />
good fortune, and Keiko was allowed free run of the settlement visible or not. It was even <br />
stranger was how she didn't mind the lack of twenty first century technology. Besides <br />
medical techniques, and the introductions of practical appliances such as the oven, this <br />
settlement had barely changed a twinkle in the last fifty years if not twice that! <br />
<br />
Keiko knew all this for she had formed a connection with this place the more she stayed <br />
here, the more she understood it, and the more it understood her. Already the people <br />
spoke of the kitsune spirit that walked among them. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;I&gt; But while I wasn't too happy about having my self being taken away, it was <br />
still, well, -fun- being with Karther, and now that I'm well, me again, I don't <br />
think I want to return working at a video store and being a weekend warrior.&quot;  &lt;/I&gt;<br />
<br />
Keiko remembered Akira's words. And how the otaku had been relatively impressive at his <br />
culture shock at actual japanese culture. <br />
<br />
Keiko honestly wondered if Akira/Akane/Anne had even bothered to appear before his <br />
parents back in America. Regardless of any liberation that had been granted to her mind <br />
due to her new species, she still felt emotional endearment to her own family.  She knew <br />
she had been putting it off for far too long. And she'd rather not wait until they died of old <br />
age... mortal lives were so brief...  'And when I do, I'm also going to make sure that <br />
Akira/Akane tells her parents and friend what happened to her/him if I have to drag him <br />
across the bottom of the Pacific ocean by his tails!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Sister dearest! Great weather we're havin' isn't it?&quot; 'Speak of the devil.' <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Akira.&quot; She said not turning around hearing his effeminate voice. &quot;Finally managed <br />
to pull together our family gather for all ten of us sisters?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw. But that is technically eleven ya know, Tammy was a sister too, even if she wasn't <br />
part of the harem fer long. Though I wonder if it should be twelve and have Kyriel sit in <br />
honor of Janice's place...&quot; <br />
<br />
Keiko wondered if she should tell the bees that there was honey in Akane's ears again, she <br />
grinned at the mental image. She knew fully (and correctly) that Akane would take it with <br />
good humor.  &quot;So there a reason for your visit sister or did you just get bored with the <br />
games you play with the humans under you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw. Give me a thousand years and -maybe- I'll get bored. I came here to tell ya! Seems <br />
like a developer or something is planning to push the locals off their homestead for <br />
whatever reason, thought they might try your place too so I'd give you the heads up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By the time I'd be done with them they wouldn't come within sight of this place ever <br />
again. So how'd you find this out?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh just heard some guys talking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what did you do?&quot; Keiko asked without missing a beat. <br />
<br />
Akira told her. <br />
<br />
Keiko instantly replied, &quot;I'll be back in a few minutes! You keep an eye on things! And if <br />
you do anything I wouldn't have done: I'll place a curse so powerful on your village, that <br />
every drop of saki in it and within a mile of it now and forever more will turn into water!&quot; <br />
Seeing Akira's tails stiffen she grinned knowing that threat was more than enough to keep <br />
him in line for the short amount of time she planned to be gone. <br />
<br />
In a swirl of leaves she vanished. <br />
<br />
Of course Keiko couldn't undo the curse Akira placed on the new girl who had chatted <br />
about knowing women better (Akane had let that slip too), that would give Akira the <br />
justification he needed to play games on people in the insignificant settlement of Japan <br />
Keiko had been sent to by Tabra/Janice that people still reversed spirits such as herself <br />
with respect and reverence. 'Such as myself.' It never ceased to intrigue Keiko how easy it <br />
was to see humans and males purely from an outsider's point view. Perhaps it was mostly <br />
psychology. <br />
<br />
Keiko knew she should have felt more upset and angry at Akira for playing on a passing <br />
teen's choice of words as an excuse to curse him. But all she felt was a pang of annoyance, <br />
she and Akira were both now creatures of chaos after all. She just felt Akira's game felt like <br />
Karther's, and for her, this feeling the same as if a sibling of hers was imitating something <br />
they saw on TV with little consideration, not something very proper at all, but at the same <br />
time not something to get terribly upset about. <br />
<br />
And in a bit of justification, the girl still had her voice and hands, perhaps she could play <br />
to Akira's ego or love of saki enough and trick him into giving her her Y chromosome back, <br />
and if not, it was not impossible for her to find happiness as she was. <br />
<br />
Keiko knew she danced a dangerous line of slipping into sanity with her actions, a a heavy <br />
burden no kitsune regardless of current mental state had any desired to carry. <br />
<br />
Keiko strolled over to the man who had been reduce to a human faced tree. He looked <br />
down at her in a clear amount of fear, maybe he thought she was going to 'mark' him or <br />
something. Either way, she put her forepaws against the tree's bark and looking up at the <br />
still human face, &quot;Hello there dearie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;GET AWAY FROM ME YOU FREAK! LET ME GO! LET ME GO!&quot; <br />
<br />
Keiko magically maintained her composure. &quot;Now I can't really do the latter if I do the <br />
former, but since you asked for the first one first-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nonononono! Please! Please don't go away! Please! Change me back! Change me back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now if I do that, how can I possibly know you won't do something like I was told you were <br />
doing ever again?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoever told you was doing it was lying! I wasn't doin' nothin!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't try to lie to a kitsune... and just for that I'm going to tell you that I can't really undo <br />
your curse since it was done onto you by another kitsune, would be a break of protocol <br />
and professional courtesy. But I can make certain... modifications... like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;LIKE MAKING YOU A TOTAL TREE!&quot; Keiko cackled for dramatic effect, and it worked <br />
perfectly. <br />
<br />
&quot;No no no! Please! Don't!&quot; the man was crying now, clearly finding the prospect something <br />
new to be terrified of. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if you don't want that, I -suppose- I could do some other modification instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please! I don't want my boss to be angry at me! He's a corporate vampire!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you were stupid enough to work for something like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't know that was what he was at the time!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nobody knew HOW people who crossed him disappeared! Just that they did! The boss got <br />
banished from Europe AND the USA  when the press found out what he was! Just cause <br />
that's what he was! Wasn't fair I tell ya.&quot;  <br />
<br />
'That explains the gaijin accent.'  &quot;When you said banished, you meant fled church <br />
sanctioned vampire hunters, and you say different, you mean prefers to turn anyone who <br />
gets in his way into corpse puppets right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... what if I could make you able to get out of the nasty problem you're in right now, <br />
and not have to worry about your boss draining you dry, and able to live a life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not gonna kill me or turn me into a rat and eat me are ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I LOOK like a genie? No, I won't, I can do this WITH or WITHOUT your consent, I'd <br />
rather just have your opinion first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not wanting to anger or upset his only possible way out the man agreed quickly, &quot;Yeah! <br />
Yeah! Sure! Just please fix me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-oh-oh-oh. I'll fix you all right. I'll fix you so you can't have kittens!&quot; Keiko words <br />
again got just the right scared rootless look that she had been hoping for. Cackling some, <br />
Keiko brushed her tails against the tree trunk. She couldn't go changing the man back into <br />
a human without breaking Akira's curse, and that would be in violation of their mutual <br />
agreement, but she could still the sentient being to have a functional life. <br />
<br />
A humanoid shape, like a figure through taunt silk began to step out of the tree trunk with <br />
Keiko's waving tails leading the way. The man's face was covered over by bark but <br />
remained in it's proper shape as the figured stepped out of the tree trunk. <br />
<br />
In a matter of seconds the figure solidified shrinking several inches losing muscles tone <br />
along the way. Dark green tendrils grew long behind the bark shaped creatures head and <br />
down it's backside, looking perfectly like long hair. The bark became smooth and a light <br />
green tone. A flower bloomed on the side of the head of the being as hands and feet <br />
became dainty.  Meanwhile, the tree behind the man changed into a sakura, and the figure <br />
lost more height. <br />
<br />
The figure blinked and looked down at herself and yelped at her naked body. &quot;What what-<br />
what's this?! Huh?! That's my voice?!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it came out of your mouth so yes it's your voice. This is your manifest form. You're a <br />
dyraid, a magical manifestation of a botanic life form. You're a plant, and trees don't HAVE <br />
blood so your boss can't harm you, and now you have a vested interest in this place, if <br />
that tree dies, you die because you ARE that tree, the eyes you're seeing out of and the <br />
ears you're hearing with are just an avatar you're creating with with the magic ingrained in <br />
you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why-why do I look like a dame who couldn't even be in collage!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko assumed her most majestic, regal and awe inspiring stance on her four paws and <br />
her tails spread out like a fan. &quot;Simple. You were around I'd say thirty years old before, and <br />
you're thirty years old still, I didn't bother translating your life span to tree years, so you're <br />
going to live a few CENTURIES now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Centuries?&quot;  The new dyraid was crying now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yip! Yep! So get used to your body. I could have left you as a human face on a tree, but I <br />
felt my brother was being too cruel. I couldn't make you human without crossing him so <br />
that was out. I could have rewritten your mind so you thought you had always been a <br />
dryaid but I've had WAY too much personal experience in having my identity treated like <br />
play-dough. If you want to be human again ever, I suggest you treat my brother with <br />
respect, as much as he deserve as any rate. If you want company, I suggest you talk to the <br />
OTHER trees around here, maybe if you try hard enough you'll 'awaken' them and they'll <br />
spawn dryaids of their own, no promises of course. You're free to interact with the locals of <br />
course, with Project Return, and I'm sure they'll treat you with love and kindness since you <br />
don't look or sound a thing like you did before. Oh and be careful how far you stray from <br />
yourself, your avatar will grow weaker the farther you go until it becomes immobile <br />
though the presence of other trees will extend your range.... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about my ID, my keys, my-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They're somewhere inside you right now I imagine along with your clothes... go luck <br />
getting them out of yourself, ha-ha! Well, have a nice life! Maybe you'll get your head on <br />
straight and your priorities together eventually being one with nature, and if you somehow <br />
DO butter up my brother enough in a lifetime or two, maybe you'll be a wiser human. And <br />
if you're thinking of betraying anyone here... don't, I have placed a curse on you that shall <br />
smite if you betray them to your old vampire boss.&quot; A lie but she wasn't an angel. &quot;... good <br />
luck...&quot; Keiko said the last part sweetly as she vanished into a swirl of leaves again. <br />
<br />
The young teenage dryaid fell to her knees and began to cry again in lament. <br />
<br />
The locals would be quite joyful to have another spirit be their alley and friend, though the <br />
dryaid would not say what upset her, they would be determined to lift up the spirits of <br />
their new resident.  <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Julio calmly and happily worked in the library. Karther had inherited a surprisingly large <br />
volume of written knowledge, ninety nine percent of Julio was very certain the desert <br />
prince had never once even looked at!  <br />
<br />
The one percent was unsurprisingly porno. Julio didn't think he had ever been a librarian <br />
in all his centuries of life. it was actually a rather relaxing and calming change of pace <br />
compared to all he had endured before through wars and run ins with Jasim, who Julio <br />
knew regardless of anyone would STILL greet Julio with &quot;DIE ABOMINATION&quot; if they ever <br />
met face to face. <br />
<br />
So at the moment the fly was hiding on the base of the fly swatter, right in the middle <br />
east, the place Jasim was the most active, but within the walls of the kitsune city where <br />
Jasim had no desire or obligation to enter. <br />
<br />
Of course no one questioned where the librarian came from. Julio had told 'his king' when <br />
his turn in line was up that the fox man had no desire to become human at this time and <br />
fully remembered every trace of his human life and would inform 'his king' if he needed <br />
King Tommy's help at any point with becoming human again. Of course Julio could do that <br />
himself. Of course he had to invent an arab alias to go along with supposedly being among <br />
the people Tamthis had suckered or recruited in mass. 'Junaid' had made a point of trying <br />
to form a friendship with the apparently elderly fennec kitsune Gean. Maybe it would <br />
work, maybe it wouldn't, but as a sacred rule, Julio had made a point of making a friend to <br />
distract himself whenever he planned to stay someplace for a relatively long amount of <br />
time.  And Gean always had something to say or speak about when properly prodded. <br />
<br />
'Quite a good distraction, quite a good distraction indeed, just what I needed to encourage <br />
my quest even more so.' Julian thought, thinking of the events surrounding Karther then <br />
Tamthis. <br />
<br />
He looked at the great library, it would take him years, if not decades or perhaps a century <br />
or beyond to read through everything here, but the desert foxes has quite a collection of <br />
unique knowledge, and within it, buried, where bits and pieces of The Knowledge that Julio <br />
sought to claim while still within his mortal coil. And he would have it all, he would <br />
understand all, and the whereabouts of Truth would be his. He was not anything, if not <br />
patient.  <br />
<br />
'At the end of the day, this will be just another step for me, I out lived the Roman and <br />
Ottoman empires, and I've seen the creation of the veil and it's tearing down. All a very <br />
very good distraction indeed. Here's hoping His Majesty, Kyriel and the rest can keep me <br />
distracted from boredom for eons to come...'</p>
