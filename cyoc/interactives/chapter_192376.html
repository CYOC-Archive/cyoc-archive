<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mieni had its freedom to move forward and the first of the new residents to convert was the mother, Angelyn. The family of well-endowed women had agreed to convert to become Animalians, not so much because they wanted to fit in with the other residents of Mieni, but because they were moving in to revamp the underground hotel it was figured that conversion might be necessary. Angelyn and her daughters had looked it over after moving in and finding that they had no guests there at the time. The internal facilities seemed rather stable and the exterior walls being metal and fit like a submarine&#39;s pressure hull, but they&#39;d also agreed that if some freak storm took out the island, they were on it would be wiser to convert.<br />
<br />
There were assurances that the island wouldn&#39;t face destruction, as when some storms had moved through, they hadn&#39;t done serious damage to any of the islands in the atoll, but Angelyn figured it best to convert, just in case. The one thing they ultimately agreed on was that the family would undergo the conversions in rotation, both to not tax the modest staff that Horizon had on Mieni and to give her daughters a potential shot with the available bachelors. She remembered seeing some of them have some fairly friendly conversations with those that were single and didn&#39;t want to rush them or force them into becoming a specific kind of Animalian. That left Angelyn to go first and with her preferred choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do have it, right?&quot; Angelyn asked as finished the last of the paperwork and handed it to the Sea Krait Animalian, Harold.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;we&#39;ve actually gotten samples of just about all kinds of reef and in the case of the Yellowfin Tuna, fish that will often stay at the surface layers to hunt, fairly easily. Though, for the most part, most people that have become Fish Animalians have tended to either pick a species of shark or they match an Animalian they&#39;ve fallen for. Tuna really hasn&#39;t been one that&#39;s been chosen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;d be the first,&quot; Angelyn spoke, &quot;and given that the hotel my daughters and I have taken over is underground and could potentially flood, particularly if something goes wrong with the locks for the sub tours birth, being a fast-swimming fish species could me rescue guests if the need be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that isn&#39;t likely,&quot; Harold commented, &quot;from what I&#39;ve been told, when the island you and your daughters was used to create the underground hotel and connection for the sub tours, everything was made sure that it&#39;d actually be the most secure of the two hotels on the atoll should the absolute worst happen... be it a storm or simply global warming sinks the atoll.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It still wouldn&#39;t hurt to be prepared, right?&quot; Angelyn asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose not,&quot; Harold replied and lead Angelyn along through the hallways in the medical/Horizon Labs area in Mieni.<br />
<br />
Unlike the specific buildings that were built for this purpose, like those in Dino City, or improved over more hospital-like lab facilities like the main Horizon Labs in Lyre, many of the facilities on Mieni were made more Spartan and compressed to work with the fact that it was built out of the small medical center that had been there for the air force base that had originally been part of the atoll. Thus, Angelyn followed Harold along through the hallways until he came to one door that led into what looked like it would be an office from the outside. Harold went in, and Angelyn briefly noticed what looked like several industrial refrigerators along one wall, which made her guess that the samples of the Animalia Virus that Horizon had for Mieni was kept in there. After a few moments, Harold returned carrying a small plastic box, in which were the syringes needed for Angelyn&#39;s doses that would let her become a Yellowfin Tuna Animalian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, you will know that the Yellowfin Tuna isn&#39;t a reef fish?&quot; Harold asked, &quot;it may spend a lot of time at shallower depths than most other open ocean fish, but it&#39;s not something you&#39;d see in among the reefs and atolls all that often?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but it&#39;s fast and active,&quot; Angelyn answered as she fell along behind him as he led her to one of the conversion rooms on Mieni, &quot;and in some ways... tuna has always been my favorite fish and something of a favorite treat to eat. Though... I suppose I won&#39;t be able to have tuna sandwiches after converting. Cannibalism and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cannibalism would only be in relation to the same exact species, in your case the Yellowfin Tuna,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;the other Tuna species wouldn&#39;t be cannibalism, and it should be noted that large Yellowfins can and have eaten smaller Tuna species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Angelyn answered, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t want to create any trouble or odd things that way. And besides, it&#39;s not as though there wouldn&#39;t be other fish to eat as Animalian that haven&#39;t been uplifted and aren&#39;t of the same species.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold nodded and then opened the door to the conversion room. Unlike the tank room that was near the areas where Harold and Kirana worked with the uplifting of mundane animals brought to Mieni and where Harold&#39;s main computers were, this room was much smaller. There was still a bed that had been brought in, but it was smaller than others and was part of a more limited number of conversion rooms than the others. It was something that also made the decision to stagger the conversions for Angelyn and her daughters out more helpful. Harold went about readying to deliver the shots while Angelyn moved to sit down on the bed. She gave a polite smile when Harold prepared to deliver the shots.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Angelyn spoke.<br />
<br />
Harold nodded and delivered the shots with the standard, &quot;welcome to Animalia.&quot; From there, Harold headed out of the room to let Angelyn transform in peace. Things were quiet for a few moments as he shut the door and then rested on his tail. Yellowfin Tuna weren&#39;t known for being super aggressive fish, but neither were they small with large representatives reaching around four hundred pounds or so. It was something where Angelyn would likely need some new clothing.  Her shirt and bra size probably wouldn&#39;t change, but he expected that she would be slightly taller and would also need new pants to work with her new tail. While he waited, he noted Kirana approaching and carrying a set of clothing as she approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just in time,&quot; Harold said to her, &quot;she&#39;s just gone into the conversion room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Kirana nodded, &quot;there are some added donations from some of our other large size Fish/Dolphin Animalians. Not Ran and Gaz&#39;s size... but still of decent size.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold nodded and the two soon waited together for a few moments. Things remained quiet for a moment before the door opened a crack. Both Sea Krait Animalians heard this and noted Angelyn sticking her head through. Her hair was still there, though it had lost the gray and silver tinges to it. Many of the other expected changes were there. Her breasts didn&#39;t look any bigger, though they did look a bit firmer under her shirt as she leaned through the doorway, though she also seemed to be keeping her hips and legs inside the room. Then there were the obvious features that would be associated with the Yellowfin Tuna. Her scales were largely blue on the dorsal side and a silver-white color on the lower side and her mouth was now a bit pointed to match the Yellowfin&#39;s mouth. <br />
<br />
The that stood out the most were the dorsal fins. Female Fish, Dolphin, and Whale Animalians had their dorsal fin move up to their head when uplifted converted. Harold had seen plenty of this on Mieni. However, most of those that Harold had seen only had ONE dorsal fin. The Yellowfin Tuna, however, often had two dorsal fins, with the second being particularly long with the Yellowfin, and that stood out with Angelyn. Rising from the middle of her hair, and actually parting it was the first yellow dorsal fin that arched back along her head, looking almost like a mohawk hair cut standing up. The second grew out of the base of her neck and arched back like a big yellow sickle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done,&quot; Angelyn spoke, &quot;though... my tail kinda destroyed my pants and underwear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can help,&quot; Kirana offered and moved forward, &quot;and don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s common for those that become Fish Animalians of any species to need to change some aspects of their attire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Angelyn answered and let Kirana in to help her.</p>
