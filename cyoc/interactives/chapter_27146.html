<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a sudden puff of gray smoke in front of him that startled Ty out of his thoughts. A dark shadow appeared in the mist and began to slowly take the shape of a large four-legged animal. Ty gasped as the smoke cleared and a large black scaled reptile stood proudly in front of him at the foot of the bed.<br />
<br />
As the smoke cleared away Ty gasped in shock at what he saw. Standing before his gaze was a black dragon.<br />
<br />
There was no mistaking the regal teardrop shaped scales reflecting the light of the morning sun from his window. Sharp claws on all four feet, the long tail with a diamond shaped barb on the end, the large folded wings, the long snout full of sharp serrated teeth, the fan shaped ears and large powerful body. The dragon was bristling with sharp orange spines and the membranes of flesh between its ears and wings were dark purple. The dragon was thickly muscular and beautifully sleek at the same time, measuring some 12 feet long from snout to tip of tail, over eight feet tall in height, with what must be an even more massive wingspan. The shape of the dragon took up most of the empty space in his room.<br />
<br />
Beautiful yellow and green eyes stared back intently into his own human eyes, a sparkle of compassion behind them. This was not an evil creature, but Ty was too dumbstruck to think much of these details, taking in the entire impossible sight with shock.<br />
<br />
“Tyler?” A gentle female voice inquired sweetly.<br />
<br />
“Y-Yes?” Ty whispered, barely able to speak. He gulped and suddenly felt self-conscious of his boyish nudity, covering his exposed genitals with both hands.<br />
<br />
The dragoness held Ty’s gaze for several moments, exhaling large hearty breaths of warm air onto his chest, making him shiver. Then, she sat down on her back haunches and then craned her long neck down to rest her long muzzle on top of the boy’s shoulder. “Oh, my child,” the dragoness said with a hint of lament, “how long it has been.”<br />
<br />
Ty gulped as a large clawed forepaw reached forward and wrapped a limb around his back, cuddling him closely and pulling Ty to the dragon’s chest. Ty gasped as his cheek and chest was pressed into smooth cool scales. He could hear the dragon’s heartbeat and feel her chest gently heaving as she breathed. He felt a strange feeling of recognition, like he had seen this incredible creature before, and felt slightly at ease. But no less shocked at the circumstance.<br />
<br />
At last the dragon relinquished her gentle embrace in her muscular front leg and let Ty go, pulling back and sitting facing him with a large smile pulling at the sides of her mouth, revealing her pointy fangs. “The last time I laid my ancient eyes upon you, child, you were but an infant! How you have grown!”<br />
<br />
“W-What? I don’t understand!” Ty finally managed to say, his eyes wide and his jaw slack. “W-What’s going on!”<br />
<br />
The dragon raised a silencing finger to the tip of her snout and gently shifted forward. “Patience and ease, my young one. You are scared. Perplexed. Do not be.” The large dragoness gracefully rose to stand and bowed formally, spreading her wings and then folding them again. “My name is Seera of the dragon clan K’turr. I am over twelve thousand years in age. Your mother and father, your real mother and father,” the dragon paused as if searching for the words to say, “they were skilled masters of change, as you are destined to become.” The dragoness smiled, seeing Ty’s expression of horror change to wonderment. “And I, Tyler, I am your loyal servant, until the stars boil from the sky and time ceases to exist. My life is now yours for all eternity.”<br />
<br />
It took a moment for all that to sink in and Ty gulped down another lump in his throat. He felt sharp excitement building in his stomach and started to shiver. “Wow. My own dragon. T-This has to do with my power?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yes!” The dragoness replied. “It is precisely your awakening that lead me to you, my precious boy. Years have I searched for the son of my former master, long have I scoured the land in the hope that our paths would cross! The subtle changes you made to the fabric of reality rippled through my senses, and I knew at last it must be you!&quot;<br />
<br />
“My… parents?” Ty managed to ask, becoming amazed at how articulate and beautiful the dragoness was.<br />
<br />
“Oh, your true parents, Tyler. Not these crude caregivers you now possess. Your father was Azure the great sorcerer and your mother was a no less skilled sorceress named Nelphia.” Seera again sat down on her haunches and swayed her tail gently from side to side, rattling the spines running down its length. “They loved each other greatly and had great hopes for you, Tyler. Only a power greater than their own separated you from them, I fear forever.”<br />
<br />
“This is too much to take in.” Ty said, putting his swimming head in his hands and shaking it.<br />
<br />
“Oh, there is a great destiny before you, Tyler. Do not be afraid. You have discovered your power and once more there is hope for us all. I shall teach you, if you wish. You have so much potential.” The dragon gently tousled Ty’s hair with her large paw. “It is much to know at once, and yet you have all the time in the world to sort it out.”<br />
<br />
Ty looked up into the dragon’s matronly expression and smiled at her warmly. “Seera, it was?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Tyler. My name is Seera. And I am yours.” She nuzzled her scaly snout against his nose and laughed slightly.<br />
<br />
“Why are you mine?” Ty chuckled slightly at Seera’s pleasant demeanor. “I don’t want you to be … my slave. I mean, I like you, but I don’t want you.”<br />
<br />
“You misunderstand, Tyler,” Seera said with a grin. “I am not your slave. That would imply I am being forced to obey you. No, as with your father before you, I willingly enter into your service. I have much to offer you. Your father saved my life and freed me from a great distress, and I swore I would pay back his kindness to me by being his servant. As it is with you.”<br />
<br />
“What can you do?” Ty asked. “Do you have power as well?”<br />
<br />
“I do not.” Seera replied. “I am not a creature of magic. But I am immortal, I am strong, and I am wise. I can protect you where others cannot, teach you things that surpass humanity’s knowledge, and you can shape me and change me as you please. I am a completely loyal friend and ally who would do anything and everything you desire.”<br />
<br />
“Well… what… what now?” Ty asked. Did he really just gain control of a large black dragoness? Was she really saying what he thought she was saying? Wow. This really was turning into an awesome birthday.<br />
<br />
“Whatever you wish, Tyler.” Seera cuddled him close once more. Her affection and honesty was starting to get to him deep down. “Let me teach you to use your power, let me guide and shape your rightful destiny, let us share time and experience together and bring about change to this world.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds great!” Ty beamed. “But… let me put some clothes on first.”<br />
<br />
Seera laughed a growling snort. “Of course, dear Tyler, of course. Please do as you wish.”<br />
<br />
Ty got up from the bed and stood beside Seera, looking way up into her beautiful eyes.</p>
