<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adams was walking throughout the streets when he saw through a window two boys arguing.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t need you to babysit me. I&#39;m five and three quarters years old!&quot; The smallest boy said as he climbed an old fashioned bookshelf.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like the idea either, asshole, I had plans for tonight but I need to money!&quot; The other boy who looks like 13 or 14 years old replied.<br />
&quot;Well, I can give you more money if you leave alone!&quot; The small boy said from the top of the bookshelf. &quot;I have some money from my birthday!&quot;<br />
&quot;I would be pleased but I can&#39;t leave a brat like you alone.&quot; The other boy said. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll hurt yourself and then I&#39;ll get more problems!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not a baby! I can take care of myself like a grown up!&quot; The kid yelled. &quot;Look I&#39;m bigger than you now!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not bigger, you are just sitting in a higher position. You don&#39;t have any idea of growing up!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I do!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you don&#39;t!&quot;<br />
They kept arguing so intensely that they didn&#39;t notice that Adams was looking at them. He used the Pubertifier scan and realized that the older boy was too old to be affected, however the other one was completely suitable. He will just wait for the perfect opportunity to shot him without getting noticed.<br />
&quot;I do! You got taller and stronger and you can do anything like driving or staying awake late at nights! I want to be a grown up!&quot; The small boy yelled before he screamed in a tantrum while the other boy just left him there and sat on a couch to read a magazine. Adams knew that it was his opportunity to shot.<br />
<br />
The boy didn&#39;t feel the shot but he involuntarily groaned as he started to grow. He was feeling that his clothes were slowly getting tighter but he didn&#39;t say anything because he didn&#39;t want to demonstrate to the other boy that he&#39;s weak or something like that. After several minutes, there was a loud rip as he grew out of his clothes and the pain disappeared. However, as the other boy was ignoring him, he began to groan in order to get his attention back. &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to take care of me? Why <br />
aren&#39;t you doing anything? I&#39;m dying over here!&quot; He said in a dramatic tone.<br />
<br />
The other boy stopped reading his magazine and turned back without any enthusiasm. However when he saw the kid over the bookshelf he stared shocked at him. He quickly realized that the brat was growing older and although he thought at first it was something to be worried he also thought it was a good way to teach him a lesson. He just smiled at the boy and said &quot;Oh, you&#39;re certainly doing something but it&#39;s not dying&quot;.<br />
<br />
The other boy didn&#39;t understand, so he started to kick the bookshelf and make a tantrum again. The older boy wondered how he didn&#39;t notice he was as old as him now. He was starting to look like a typical <br />
teenager, only without the clothes which hadn&#39;t withstood his growth spurt. <br />
<br />
The babysitter listened to him moan in fake pain for another minute before grabbing him by a foot. The brat opened his eyes that he had closed because of his tantrum and said &quot;No, you don&#39;t pay att... Huh? Wow, why is my voice so deep?&quot;. He rubbed his throat, feeling a large lump where there was normally nothing. He thought that maybe he was sick. He looked at the babysitter&#39;s hand on his foot which looked too big and hairy that he wiggled his toes to be sure it was his foot. He gasped when he realized that it wasn&#39;t just his foot but his legs, his arms and hands were larger and hairier than before, looking even bigger than his babysitter&#39;s.<br />
<br />
The babysitter stared at the young man that the kid had grown into. He knew he had got taller than him but he wondered how much, maybe a foot or two. They both deeply watched how much he&#39;d changed. His arms and legs were longer and hairer. His torso was toned and there was a wide line of hair around his bellybutton that led down to a thick patch of hair surrounding his new manhood, which had increased tenfold. Hair was even starting to appear in the middle of his chest. It was all to much for the former kid that he suddenly broke down in tears. &quot;Waah! I&#39;m all big and hairy and I don&#39;t know why and I&#39;m <br />
scared! What happened to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The babysitter just laughed at the new man. He had to be close to 20 years old now but he still behaved like a crying baby. &quot;Well, you wished to be a grown up. So god decided you&#39;ll be one, apparently. Don&#39;t you like being big and hairy? It&#39;s what you had to deal with when you grow up. It&#39;s not as pretty as you thought, isn&#39;t it?&quot;. <br />
<br />
The new man&#39;s mood changed in an instant. &quot;You mean I&#39;m a complete grown up now? Wow, this is so cool! I can do whatever I want&quot;. He rubbed the snot away from his nose, his hand brushing against his newly grown facial hair. He <br />
started rubbing his face with a dumb grin. He thought that he could get used to his new body quickly. In fact, he was much bigger than his babysitter now, possibly even older. He could do all the things he had said and more. This was the greatest <br />
thing to ever happen to him.<br />
<br />
The babysitter watched as the man explored his body, possibly close to 30 years old now. He could see his youthful face was starting to harden, and his body hair thickening everywhere. &quot;Well you might think it&#39;s cool now, but how will you explain this to your family? They won&#39;t believe you grew all of the sudden and I don&#39;t have any intention to help you. In fact, as you are a grown man now, you don&#39;t need a babysitter so I can go now.&quot; He began to walk away. &quot;I recommend you to look for some pants, you won&#39;t like to go around showing off that.. thing between your legs. It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man blushed and yelled to the boy. &quot;You can&#39;t leave me here. You must help me because if my family didn&#39;t find me they will blame you.&quot;. The boy stopped and turned back. Dammit, that brat was right and he knew it. &quot;Now, give me your pants! I won&#39;t be the one who will be going around pantless.&quot;<br />
<br />
The babysitter hadn&#39;t choice but obey, so he took his pants off and threw them to the man over the bookshelf who grabbed them and then he landed on the ground making a heavy stomp. He looked at his babysitter&#39;s underpants and noticed that his bulge looked so small compared to his. He grinned and reached a hairy hand out towards his cock, wondering why it feel so different and interesting now. Almost immediately, it began to get hard and pointy, but his babysitter slapped his hand away. He didn&#39;t want to see something like that, especially by a 30 year old man with a 5 year old mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;My pants won&#39;t fit you. You need pants for grown-ups. I can take some from my home but you must wait me here.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you will leave me alone! I&#39;ll go with you!&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re naked! You can&#39;t!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, I can!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, you can&#39;t!&quot;<br />
Adams noticed that they were arguing again, so he left them and kept his way to the market. After walking away for a moment, he glanced at a pantless boy and an almost naked man running through the streets while people stared at them.</p>
