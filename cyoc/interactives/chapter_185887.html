<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The trio of girls wandered through the aisles, absent-mindedly examining things on the shelves. Every now and then they&#39;d toss something interesting into a shopping basket they&#39;d found a few aisles back. <br />
<br />
A tube of black lipstick promising to &quot;Darken your World&quot;, a set of mood rings that would alter your appearance based on how you were feeling, a deck of playing cards made for &quot;TF Poker&quot;; they couldn&#39;t help but grab at the stuff.<br />
<br />
The store seemed simultaneously gigantic yet cozy at the same time. Shelves seemed to stretch on endlessly, yet they all had this feeling like the front counter was right around the next corner...if they so desired it.<br />
<br />
Amy, Lina, and Samantha paused momentarily at the intersection of several aisles, trying to see where to head toward next. <br />
<br />
Lina peered down one aisle and said, &quot;I&#39;m going tooo-oooh head towards the footwear section&quot;, nodding in its direction, &quot;need to see if they&#39;ve got anything for these!&quot; She wiggled the fingers of her monkey feet at them unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; said Samantha, who was standing next to a rack of potions, &quot;I&#39;ll catch up, want to check out these shrinking solutions first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll stick with Samantha for the moment,&quot; said Amy, &quot;not much call for shoes and socks with theeiighse hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lina nodded, then headed off down the aisle, leaving Amy and Samantha alone. <br />
<br />
Amy looked over at Samantha, who had diligently been chewing her Girly Gum as they shopped.<br />
<br />
While she hadn&#39;t blown any more bubbles, the now shorter girl had continued her changes slightly. Her once red hair had faded in color slightly, a few streaks even looked...pinkish.<br />
<br />
Her shirt had gotten thicker and looser, its sleeves lengthening down to her elbows as the fabric shifted materials. A few splotches of different colors had appeared on it, but no pattern was discernible yet. The neckline was creeping up, now showing none of her chest.<br />
<br />
Further down, her denim shorts had bleached themselves of their blue color, and were now very faintly pink too. The waist had risen slightly up Sam&#39;s midriff and the legs exposed a bit more of her slender thighs. Some odd bunching of the fabric was occurring too, as if it wasn&#39;t quite cut right to be a proper pair of shorts anymore, the separation between the legs didn&#39;t seem so distinct.<br />
<br />
Around her ankles, her socks remained at the same height as before, the cute yellow ruffles sitting a few inches above her ankles. Samantha&#39;s shoes looked markedly different already though. The material in some spots had shifted from black canvas to pink faux-leather, and a two inch platform of pink rubber had formed to push her back up to her normal height.<br />
<br />
Amy&#39;s eyes slid up slightly to focus on Samantha&#39;s legs. Even with her diminished height they were quite shapely. Lightly toned with smooth, pale skin.<br />
<br />
Amy couldn&#39;t help but to imagine running her hoof hands across those smooth legs. I&#39;d love to peel those pink shorts off, she thought, her nostrils flaring slightly as warmth rushed through her nethers. Amy wouldn&#39;t mind putting her new tongue to use if....<br />
<br />
Amy suddenly looked up to find that Sam&#39;s eyes were on her. The blue color seemingly enhanced by an almost imperceptible sparkle. A small smirk played about her lips and she squinted her eyes knowingly. She began to chew her gum with extra gusto.<br />
<br />
Amy quickly turned away, embarrassed making herself extremely invested in the nearest product she could find. Fortunately enough due to the nature of the store, it did turn out to be interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tryannon&#39;s Transformative Taffies!&quot; the bright placard above a basket marked &quot;Sale: $5&quot; read. It was accompanied by some cartoon caricatures of people. One guy seemed to have a full lion&#39;s mane, while a girl had beautiful butterfly wings sticking out behind her, another girl seemed to be acting mock embarrassed over a bulge pressing out against her cartoon skirt. In the basket sat simple clear plastic bags of multicolored taffies.<br />
<br />
Momentarily forgetting her embarrassment, Amy leaned in to read the words on the placard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fun between friends! Take a taffy and enjoy a random effect for 30 minutes! Best at parties!&quot;<br />
<br />
She reached down and grabbed a bag of the taffies. She was placing it in the shopping basket when from behind her she heard the unmistakable sound of Samantha blowing another bubble. Amy waited to hear the sound of a pop but the inflating kept going.<br />
<br />
Amy turned around and her horsey eyes goggled in astonishment. She couldn&#39;t see Samantha&#39;s face, it was obscured by a pink bubble the size of a bowling ball. Amy wanted to say something as it grew, but before she could the bubble exploded with a very satisfying *POP* all over Samantha&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
The effects were near instantaneous as the girly air from the bubble was released. Samantha&#39;s hair was thrown back, the pale reddish color being subsumed by a wave of dusty pink as the locks grew thicker and longer, reaching down to below Sam&#39;s shoulders. A few more white hair clips popped into being, they were the same style as the first. As Samantha watched, a small plastic pastel yellow flower grew at the end of each one.<br />
<br />
The pink collar of her shirt rose up to the middle of her neck while the sleeves lengthened down to her wrists. The fabric thickened as the shirt became a cotton sweater, and the splotches of color across the shirt solidifying into pastel stripes; pink, purple, blue, teal, yellow.<br />
<br />
Her pink shorts *fwomped* outward into a high-waisted pink pleated skirt. It had two white bows on the front, just below the waistband. The bottom of the skirt fluttered around mid-thigh.<br />
<br />
Amy saw that Sam appeared to be shrinking again, losing another two inches, putting her natural height at only 5&#39;1&quot;. The trend downward didn&#39;t last long though as the changes reached Sam&#39;s shoes and feet.<br />
<br />
No sooner had she dropped in height, before the platforms on her shoes pressed out another three inches of pink rubber, pushing her an inch taller than before the bubble. The shoes shifted fully into pastel pink and white platform sneakers. Above the laces, pink ribbon flowed out and tied itself into a cute bow. Her pastel yellow socks rose up another inch to the bottom of her calves, and the ruffles around the hems grew larger and hung down towards her pink shoes.<br />
<br />
The increasingly girly Samantha shuddered, throwing out a hand to a nearby shelf for support, causing the potions on it to shudder and clink dangerously. Reaching up a dainty hand that now sported pastel yellow polish, she tugged the deflated gum off her face and stuck it back in her mouth.<br />
<br />
Her face looked cuter and more feminine before. With pale skin, soft pink lips that seemed a bit thicker, and a dainty nose. A smattering of freckles were brushed cutely across the bridge of her nose. Her eyes seemed to be the main attraction though. They seem to have grown slightly in size, and the blue of her irises shone out even bright than before from beneath the darker eyeliner that rimmed them.<br />
<br />
As she regained her footing, Samantha took stock of her changes and began chewing away at her gum again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad at all!&quot; she said, before daintily pressing a hand against her throat. &quot;Oh my!&quot; Samantha said in a higher, more sugary voice than she had had before. &quot;Guess that needed some adjusting too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at Amy and cleared her throat. &quot;What do you think?&quot; she said, batting her sparkling eyes provocatively, &quot;I figured you needed a better view if you&#39;re going to be staring that long.&quot; She winked, and Amy found herself unexpectedly weak in the knees. Amy had never thought much of girly stuff before, too many frills and colors. Now though, she couldn&#39;t deny that she was entranced by the sight of her new friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I uhh...&quot; said Amy, trying desperately, &quot;You look really cute!&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha pouted, stamping a platform sneaker in mock-dismay. &quot;Cute? I pop a bubble bigger than my head, turn ULTRA girly, and all you can say is &#39;cute&#39;?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The mock-dismay vanished and that sly smirk returned to Sam&#39;s face, &quot;Guess I&#39;ll just have to keep working on it then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Reeiighht yeah.&quot; said Amy quickly, &quot;Should uuhh, should we go find Lina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After you, mighty mare.&quot; said Sam, gesturing in the direction Lina had went with a little flourish.<br />
<br />
Amy said nothing, but swiftly turned and began trotting down that aisle, trying not to think about the gorgeous pastel girl following close behind her, or of what she wanted to be doing with her.<br />
<br />
The multicolored girl was still smirking as she trailed the mare girl. She slid another pink piece of the Girly Gum out of the package and put it in her mouth. She started chewing, shuddering for a second and almost losing her balance on her platforms as the sweetness of the two pieces combined.</p>
