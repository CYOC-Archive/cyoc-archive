<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This will be a little trickier, Rudy said to himself.  To his great annoyance, fire haired Jack jogged up to them and immediately starting hogging Tony's attention with his stupid talk about baseball.  Why did Tony give a shit about that?  Soccer's the world's sport.  Who cares about baseball?  <br />
<br />
Jack would have to go.  Besides, he knew about the chronivac.  At least he did until a couple minutes after Tony and Rudy had left him at the front of their yard.  Mrs. Sullivan had immediately started in on her son Jack to rake leaves in the yard and Jack had reluctantly dropped his backpack right there and picked up a rake.<br />
<br />
Rudy walked along with Tony, not saying much, just enjoying his view of Tony and then, when they were a couple blocks away, slapped his palm to his forehead.<br />
&quot;Oh, jeez, I was supposed to give Jack some physics notes&quot; he said and started to double back.<br />
&quot;I'll go with you, Rude&quot; <br />
&quot;Nah, no need for you to walk extra too.  I'll meet you at your house in just a few minutes&quot; said Rudy and he started jogging back toward the Sullivans' house.  Over his shoulder he saw Tony shrug and continue on toward the St. Martins' house.<br />
<br />
Rudy jogged up to the edge of the Sullivans' yard and set his bag down on a knee high tree stump.  He pulled out the computer with the chronivac 4.0 and the emitter and started furiously typing.  He hadn't really planned on taking care of Jack, but knew his way around the 4.0's options well enough to quickly designate a profile used for another subject for Jack.  He pointed the emitter and struck the 'enter' key.  As far as anyone knew, there was no Jack Sullivan and as far as Jack knew, there was no such thing as a chronivac.<br />
<br />
Jack felt an odd electric shock pass through his whole body and suddenly the seat of his pants was incredibly tight.  His whole body felt weird and he staggered, only staying upright by using the rake for balance.  In the front of his pants, he felt his penis thickening and lengthening like a water balloon held to a faucet.<br />
&quot;Cool&quot; chuckled Jack.  And then he looked at his hands.  His skin was getting thick and tough and then it covered over with a dense coat of coarse gray hair.  As he watched, amazed, his fingers coalesced into a black hoof.  <br />
<br />
To Rudy's amazement, he heard Jack chuckle and say &quot;Oh, cool.  This is like my fantasies from that CYOC site&quot;<br />
<br />
Far from being horrified, Jack was positively fascinated.  He laughed as his pants burst off his new jackass rear and his shirt shredded as well a moment later.  He staggered over to a car at the curb and watched his reflection in the glass as his ears shot upward and his face shot forward.  He tried to say &quot;Cool!&quot; again but only managed a mild bray.  To Rudy's shock, Jack shot his seed all over the side of that car as he watched his transformation complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit&quot; muttered Rudy. &quot;He actually likes it&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack brayed and kicked the air.  He jumped up and down for a full minute, luxuriating in the amazing experience of different senses and his huge new body.  He knew enough to know that he was a hinny, the product of a male horse and female donkey, and bigger than most other jackasses.  Jack set off to try a bit of that equine mating, himself.<br />
<br />
As he did, Rudy re-dialed the number he'd dialed outside the school.<br />
&quot;Animal Welfare.  How may I help you?&quot;<br />
&quot;You're not going to believe this, but . . &quot;<br />
<br />
But Jack, the jackass proved to be difficult to catch.  For one thing, Jack could run pretty fast and he was enjoying running.  For another, Jack still had his human mind and was clever about where he hid.  At nightfall, he had eluded the various vets and others who were after him and made his way to the farm at the north boundary of town.  He nosed his way into the stable there and mounted a small mare.  A half hour later, he mounted her again and then a half hour later yet again.  Jack was a little disturbed to find that he couldn't hold off from ejaculating for more than a couple thrusts, tops, but loved the pure animal fury of it.  No small talk, just, I'm the stud, you're the mare.  Here it is.  <br />
<br />
As he went to sleep, Jack's overriding feeling was that life was good.  He only wondered if it had been reading all those stories at CYOC that had triggered the change he'd wished for so fervently.<br />
<br />
Back at the St. Martin house, Rudy had run up to the front steps and rung the bell.  Tony answered the door.<br />
&quot;Did you catch up with Jack?&quot; he asked<br />
&quot;Jack?  Who's Jack?&quot; said Rudy.<br />
&quot;Um . . &quot; Tony puzzled for a moment then dropped the matter and let Rudy inside.</p>
