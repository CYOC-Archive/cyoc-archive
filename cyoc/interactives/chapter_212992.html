<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sammy and Milly had walked to the hospital thinking it would be better, but they were wrong. it was a busy day and people were everywhere, he accidentally touched a businessman and he turned into a 7-foot boar toon, &quot;sorry was all he could say&quot;. next, he touched a planted tree and it grew into a massive banana tree which he grabbed some and ate. then he brushed a fire hydrant with it and it became toon before it gained a face and started making puns about hydrants, &quot;don&#39;t worry about me I&#39;m hydrated&quot;. at that point, Sammy suspected it would be better to walk on his hands. the sidewalk became a cartoon with each hand step he took, a manhole cover got tooned and the writing on it changed from the city of Osmon to the city of Ostoon. <br />
<br />
they eventually got to the hospital with the ground behind Sammy now tooned. &quot;hello can I help you&quot; Dr. Peters said already eyes the gorilla toon. &quot;yes my friend here got affected by the cartoon thing. his name was Sally Heartly&quot; Milly said before Sammy lifted his right leg towards the doctor. &quot;the name is Sammy heatwave&quot; he said. &quot;I see well let&#39;s get you checked out&quot; he led them to an examination room. &quot;now when did you change,&quot; the doctor said before grabbing a clipboard. &quot;I don&#39;t know as far as I can remember I&#39;ve always been this way,&quot; Sammy said as he hopped on the already toon examination table.<br />
<br />
&quot;He was a woman when we left west Emily high school together. I had to pick up something at the mall and then saw the two toons so the investigators asked me some questions. when I got back it was 4:00 and I saw our couch was toon, then I saw Sammy and it took a bit but I got him to realize what happened&quot; Milly finished. &quot;OK did you affect anyone else?&quot; he asked the 2 of them, &quot;*sighs* yeah I thought not going in the car would be better but that was a mistake. now there&#39;s a banana tree at the sidewalk of Jhonson street, a boar toon businessman and a fire hydrant that likes to make jokes about itself.&quot; he said pinching his nose with his gloved hand. &quot;OK well we&#39;ll need to do a complete examination so miss cooper can you step outside for a bit. once Milly was outside the room the doctor told him to undress and put on a hospital gown. <br />
<br />
he did so while the doc was facing him before saying &quot;sorry I didn&#39;t mean to do that. it&#39;s just when there&#39;s no one else around I like being Au naturel, or at least now I do. It&#39;s really confusing my noggin I mean there is proof that I was once a woman but I always remembered being a toon man&quot; Sammy said. &quot;it&#39;s alright, I&#39;ve unfortunately seen a few cartoons cocks these last few hours. so you said you always thought you were a gorilla man&quot; dr peters said getting a bod in response. &quot;ok just so you know I&#39;m the type of doctor that looks at the physical things rather than the mental things&quot; before tapping his pen against sammys white gloves, the been becoming tooned. &quot;now let&#39;s check your vitals&quot; producing a needle and drawing thick black liquid. <br />
<br />
&quot;just as I suspected, ink. it conforms that the change is consistent, a living being is comprised of  60 percent water. now, these changes cause the molecular structure of the water to turn into ink which is the perfect place for this stuff to thrive in. I&#39;m calling it stuff because there is no scientific term for it, all we know is it is found in the bloodstream or ink stream. it starts from the target area face, elbow, the foot you name it the spreads till the person is turned into a toon. this stuff is also able to alter the molecules of other things like the tree you touched and even able to make an inanimate object &#39;alive&#39; like the fire hydrant. the biggest problem is since it&#39;s unparalleled in what it does we have nothing to combat it.&quot; the doctor rambled on before falling into his chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OK?&quot; Sammy asked, &quot;no I&#39;m supposed to be a doctor, I&#39;ve studied every disease and cure I could find, and saved dozens of lives but I don&#39;t know how to stop this.&quot; he replied. &quot;hey that&#39;s OK, I honestly only want to remember who I was. I don&#39;t care about turning back I mean I have the best bod ever.&quot; Sammy told the man. &quot;I&#39;m thankful you&#39;re happy but this still is a basically uncontrollable phenomenon.&quot; dr peters said. &quot;well find a way to control it I mean you figured out that ink stuff so you can figure out the rest,&quot; Sammy said putting his feet on his shoulders. &quot;OK I guess we will continue with the examination,&quot; he said his resolve returning. <br />
<br />
&quot;OK then next we will test reflexes,&quot; he said before using a reflex hammer, he was almost knocked to the ground when the leg shot straight at him before he was caught by the foot at the end. &quot; next height and weight,&quot; he said motioning to the measuring scale, Sammy then stepped on it which gave an unintelligible sound before being crushed. &quot;sorry about that, I&#39;ve got pounds of muscles&quot; Sammy apologized. &quot;*sigh* it appears that every toon who steps onto a scale crushes it, I thought we got a tougher one. anyway height is 8&#39;10&quot; he said. &quot;next we examine the head,&quot; he said before a flashlight, he shined it into Sammy&#39;s ear and light came out the other one. he then checked the nose and saw that it seemed the most normal. &quot;open wide&quot; as he checked his mouth and throat. &quot;OK similar to the other toons I&#39;ve examined&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;next pulse,&quot; he said feeling Sammy&#39;s neck, &quot;strong pulse good&quot;. &quot;and finally we check the heart and lungs,&quot; he said before putting a stethoscope to the toons chest. he hear the lungs fine though when he listened to the heart he could hear it beat to the macarena. &quot;last time it was turkey in the straw. OK now that we&#39;ve done the check-ups let&#39;s try to find when this started&quot; he said, &quot;but doc I do not know when, I&#39;ve always been a toon, or so I thought,&quot; Sammy replied. &quot;I know but how about we go about your day and see if anything seemed odd to you even for a moment.&quot;Dr. peters said, &quot;let&#39;s start when you last saw Milly before she came home later.&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;right um... school let out early so Milly said she would go to the mall and do some shopping. I decided to go home and watch some tv, I flipped through the channels before I saw the news. it said people at a clothing store at the mall had become toons and one even went from being a woman to a gator toon man. I got up to go... somewhere...&quot; he said pausing. &quot;sorry memories are a little fuzzy&quot;. &quot;It&#39;s OK we may be getting to where you changed.&quot; Dr. peters told him. &quot;OK so then I felt a raging boner so I took off my... clothes..., wait I like being naked alone so why did I still have my clothes on. I then slid down the kitchen wall and jacked off, got to say it was the best organism I ever had.&quot; Sammy finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;wait you said your memory of where you were going got fuzzy when you went to the kitchen&quot; he got a nod in response. &quot;and then you took off clothes you usually take off when you get home and no one is there, then you felt the best sexual release ever.&quot; the doctor asked. &quot;yeah so...&quot; Sammy replied. &quot;Mr. Heatwave I&#39;ve talked with the toons that remember who they were and each one of them is happy with what they became AFTER they changed. you said that around when your memory was fuzzy you felt an urge to *cough* masturbate and it was the greatest you ever had. you see when we feel excited or just happy our brain releases a chemical called Dopamine. from what I gathered the stuff creates artificial Dopamine so the person affected won&#39;t freak out and quickly accept and like their new form. however toons such as yourself already felt the effects of the chemical naturally occurring in your brain, so when the artificial Dopamine hits your head it overloads your brain. this causes the normally small mental changes to become complete personality and memory overhaul.&quot; he said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;so am I ever going to remember who I was this sally something,&quot; Sammy asked. &quot;it&#39;s too early to tell, like I said we barely got a grasp of what this is. we can&#39;t seem to stop it let alone cure it, our best hope is to learn how to minimize the damage. there is one last thing I want you to do for me. we need a sample of your... *cough* semen for analysis&quot; he said giving Sammy a large jar. &quot;OK but can you at least turn around&quot; he asked, the doctor turned around before Sammy aimed his cock at the jar and jacked off with his arms working his cock and his legs were busy fondling his sack. he then cummed...</p>
