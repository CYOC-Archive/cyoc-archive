<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stalagmites and stalactites rained down from the rumbling ceiling as Isaac crashed down onto his back, a dull pain forcing his teeth to clench. Debris crumbled around him and the nameless paladin, the pair spares from potential impalement, thankfully. <br />
<br />
Digging his claws into the stone ground with a choked growl, Isaac&#39;s barreled chest heaved, his wide back rising and falling as he turned over to allow his wings to breath. His tongue hung free from his maw as he panted, the dull ache in his wings replaced by mere numbness as he allowed them to settle.<br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Dammit!</em>&quot; He rasped as he smashed a fist into the ground, struggling to calm himself as his draconic rage threatened to break free. The man&#39;s need for constant protection had proven to indeed be more trouble than it was worth; especially since it ended with him now being farther from the source than he had at the start.<br />
<br />
The black haired paladin coughed as he sluggishly rose to his feet, his bare form bleeding minimally from a few small wounds. Eyes scanning the expanse of cavern, his gaze shot to the white scaled dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Further from the exit than we started.&quot; Isaac grumbled as he also rose to his feet, golden eyes examining the sky of shadow above. &quot;I have a feeling flying up isn&#39;t an option.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rubbing his head, the man winced as it continued to ache and throb. He couldn&#39;t remember any of his lost memories aside from what he had vaguely told the dragon. Irritating was an understatement in describing his predicament.<br />
<br />
The pair froze as a sudden noise echoed throughout the dark expanse, akin to a teleportation spell. Dagger still within one hand, Isaac&#39;s guard hardened as his eyes darted across the cave. The nameless paladin, while strong in physique, stood close to the dragonman for protection, unable to contribute due to his lack of clothing and weapons.<br />
<br />
Allowing a few more moments to pass, Isaac&#39;s guard broke with a hushed growl as no other noise was heard, even as he scanned their surroundings.<br />
<br />
A sudden rage building within him, Isaac spun to face the black haired human, a sneer plastered across his maw. &quot;You are becoming a burden to take care of. Without armor or weapons, you&#39;ll be nothing more than prey for the vile creatures we encounter; dead weight.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s expression darkened, his brow furrowing in response. &quot;<em>D-Dead weight?!</em> Excuse me?!&quot; He spat at the white scaled dragon, disregarding the reptilian beast&#39;s look of disappointment at such an act.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You <em>scoundrel!</em> I will not allow a beast such as you to dishonor me like this!&quot; The man screamed, his face burning red with anger. &quot;I was one of the High Paladins! Demons cowered at the mere sight of me, for I was so fearsome, that without armor or weapons, my holy spells proved to be their undoing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Save your audacious and pointless anger for later. We must move forward.&quot; Isaac growled in response, swishing his tail as he turned around, the gesture only serving to anger the naked paladin further.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare turn your back on me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring the protests, slitted eyes scanned their dark surroundings.<br />
<br />
Yet before he could assess, a roar escaped his maw as a heavy force smashed against his back, causing him to stumble forward. Catching himself, the dragon spun to face the man, golden gaze narrowing as the man&#39;s palms dimmed from use of magic<br />
<br />
&quot;Whether you be corrupted or not…&quot; The man snarled, both hands extending outwards, palms beginning to glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;For my God, for my king, and for my honor, I will slay you, dragon!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;<em>Ferio Percello!</em>&quot; He screamed, a javelin of blinding light firing from his palms and barreling towards the dragon.<br />
<br />
Instinctively Isaac&#39;s eyes snapped shut, only popping open as no pain flooded him. His gaze drifted downwards to the progenitor&#39;s claw, the blast of light slowly flowing into the claw, converting into silver grey runes and seeping into his body, dissipating.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-What?!&quot; His assailant shrieked in shock, gasping as his draconic adversity lunged forth with a terrifying snarl. Thrown to the floor with a roar, the black haired man rasped as the dragon&#39;s foot smashed into his chest, claws a mere press away from stabbing into his skin.<br />
<br />
Leaning forth until his maw lay meters away from the human&#39;s nose, Isaac hissed a warning, his golden eyes darkening with an ancient rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;How foolish of you to attack the inheritor of the progenitor&#39;s power. You disgrace The Order by merely existing, a sick excuse for a High Paladin.&quot; <br />
<br />
The dragon&#39;s maw twisted into a scowl, fangs glinting as his eyes narrowed to knives. &quot;You will accompany me to the source of the corruption.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Or…&quot; One of the Dragon&#39;s hands rose, the rose dagger spinning within his palms as he toyed with it. &quot;I can bring this dagger upon your heart, reverting you to your corrupted state so I can savour your squirming as I reduce you to nothing more than a useless pile of sludge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The choice is yours, choose wisely.&quot; <br />
<br />
With a final sneer, the draconic paladin removed his foot from the human&#39;s bare chest, the man gasping for air as he sat up, shivering from both fear and frigid temperatures. Feeling no pity, Isaac turned around once again, eyes closing as he released a breath.<br />
<br />
Yet as his eyes closed, his jaws fell open in a silent gasp, a faded memory flooding to the forefront of his mind.<br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
<em><br />
The paladin&#39;s booted feet echoed through the labyrinth of endless passageways, counterpoint to the dripping of water spattering against the frigid stone floor. He assumed it was nothing more than his own breathing which he thought was rustling in the air.<br />
<br />
But his senses should have told him that his own breath was not so deep, nor was it tinged by guttural growls.<br />
<br />
Yet by the time he had realized it, it had been far too late; discovering how foolish he had been to brave the forest so many of his kind had told him not enter.<br />
<br />
For framed in the gothic archway of the crypt, a nightmare graced his sight. It&#39;s eyes the hellish color of blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t die,&quot; the beast rasped, it&#39;s maw twisting into a depraved smirk. &quot;No, you will be reborn as my successor.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a gleeful roar the beast lunged, it&#39;s maw parted in a sadistic grin as it sealed the man&#39;s fate.<br />
<br />
Ilvir. That was the man&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
Overtaken by the ghost of a long dead lupine beast, the paladin lost his heart and soul out of desperation, the corruption echoing throughout his broken mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow my bidding, and I will grant you the joy of freedom, spawn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heeding the king of beast&#39;s whispers, the foolish man came upon a group of humans, the voice promising freedom should he follow its dark bid to spread the curse.<br />
<br />
He gave in without hesitation, becoming nothing more than a mindless beast as he slaughtered the group of men, fucking the worthy to his heart&#39;s pleasure. Growing deranged, he succumbed, as did the surviving adventurers, his pack.</em><br />
<br />
. . .<br />
<br />
Eyes snapping open, Isaac scoffed to himself in disgust. Ilvir, was nothing more than a prideful and arrogant man. <br />
<br />
Gaze drifting to the silver ring that blended with his silver scales, his fist clenched. <br />
<br />
Should the &#39;paladin&#39; discover he held the Ring of Purity, he held no doubt he would attempt to steal it by any means necessary. Telling the man of his Paladinian origins, and his merging with the progenitor, would raise questions he did not want to risk answering. Lying would be his best bet.<br />
<br />
The dragon&#39;s neck craned to glance at Ilvir in scorn, eyes narrowing in revulsion. <br />
<br />
Bait was always an option.</p>
