<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The bathrooms in the barracks was part of a large communal bathroom, and likely had been there for the prison&#39;s prisoners before the Lycothan arrival. The facility had probably been on the edge of a modest sized town and the meadow that surrounded it that I&#39;d seen when we went outside was probably where many of the nearby buildings of that town had been, but in the course of time, the town had been leveled and dismantled to make way for the meadow that now surrounded it. I still didn&#39;t know how long I had been a prisoner, but I did now know what the Lycothans had accomplished in the area. And now I&#39;d be contributing to that in one way or another, though I&#39;d still have to wait until tomorrow to begin that, which would probably start with my head being shaved and leaving me with only my crest.<br />
<br />
For the moment, I was coming out of the shower area of the barracks&#39; showers. The whole bathroom area smelled slightly different from the rest of the barracks. I could smell the musk of my sisters there, but I could also pick up a great deal of the scent of bleach and cleaning supplies were there as well. It was probably efforts to keep bacteria or other potential health issues. I might be immune to parasites now as a Lycothan, but that didn&#39;t mean that Lycothans were immune to disease, though that might be hard to figure out. Many diseases only infected one species or one general type of animal. It was rare that diseases crossed species barriers. As such, since I wasn&#39;t human any more, I didn&#39;t know on whether or not human diseases could still even effect me. Though, I didn&#39;t know for sure and let it go. After all, keeping things clean wasn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<br />
As I came out of the shower, water dripped down my body, which even in the more human-like form felt extremely powerful. It was probably a reflection of Eira&#39;s description of me as a &quot;big girl.&quot; I found all the others also all in the process of drying off after getting themselves cleaned off. The room we&#39;d all moved into from the showers was part of the main part the bathroom, and I could see a row of bathroom stalls along one wall along with a row of sinks with mirrors above them from another angle. A part of me wanted to see my &quot;Valkyrie&quot; form, but for the moment I had to dry off. I approached a series of open steel shelves on which several towels sat folded. Grabbing one towel, I was quick to rub the material over my hair, so as to make sure it wasn&#39;t matted in a damp mass on my back and atop my breasts.<br />
<br />
While I was drying off, Eira and Raksha came out and grabbed towels of their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Sartari...check out your possible candidate for warhammer training!&quot; Raksha called across the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Emm?&quot; I heard Sartari answer as I began to rub the towel around my back.I then looked over in her direction as she looked to me and came closer. For the moment she had her towel wrapped around her waist, though I got the feeling she did that only because she didn&#39;t want to drop the towel on the floor. Lartara, just as nude as the rest of us now, came along with her. As they both came closer, I was able to see that at least in terms of height that I was now just as tall as they were. As she came closer, Sartari began to look me over rather closely. &quot;Yes... she is a worthy candidate? Wouldn&#39;t you think, Captain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d say so,&quot; Lartara nodded, &quot;She appears to be our equal physically...which will give her a good capability to swing the hammer...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how big is this warhammer?&quot; I asked, as I began drying my front with the towel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big, sister,&quot; Sartari smiled, &quot;the handle of it is about seven feet in length and holds a metal mallet that weighs around one hundred pounds. All of us are strong enough to lift it and even handle some basic swings with it... but the smaller ones of us... wouldn&#39;t be fully able to control the hammer in combat. You, though, look big enough to use it and use it well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what would we be using the warhammer for?&quot; I wondered as I looked to the white haired warrior.<br />
<br />
&quot;Within the facility... it&#39;s mostly ceremonial, as the prisoners aren&#39;t a threat to require us to use them,&quot; Sartari answered, &quot;but in combat... we use them to break barricades or armored doors, and obviously bash heads in at a distance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting,&quot; I said slowly. I figured that it related to what I had remembered from the news reports from before my capture. That Lycothans seemed to prefer weapons that played to the great strength of their Warriors rather than using things that one might expect from a race that was capable of interstellar travel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like to undergo warhammer training once you and Eira have competed your basic training?&quot; Sartari asked, &quot;You&#39;re more than strong enough to do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time, I&#39;d fully finished drying off from the shower and I glanced toward the mirrors that were in the bathroom and looked at the new me. And there I stood, strong and powerful, a far different from the human form that I&#39;d had. I&#39;d easily noticed that when I realized that I was now taller than Eira. My musculature was far larger than it had been when I was human. It didn&#39;t take away from my general femininity, but that didn&#39;t change the fact that I had far more muscle than fat. I looked like I&#39;d spent years lifting weights and doing other forms of strength training with clearly defined muscle groups and very little fat on my body. <br />
<br />
The only place where I had any fat was in my breasts and perhaps in my but. In this way, I figured I was built more like a comic book super-heroine, like Wonder Woman or She Hulk. My breasts were massive in comparison to what they had been, though with the muscle mass I&#39;d put on, I didn&#39;t know exactly what my cup size was now. I figured was in the D range, though not that cup size really mattered. My Warrior sisters seemed quite comfortable being naked around each other when not on duty, and had found myself not feeling much in the way of shame either, they were after all my sisters and we weren&#39;t fighting or engaging in real work and weren&#39;t presently engaging in handling the facilities prisoners. My human mind and memories even admitted that with even with my freckles, my muscles, my breasts capped with dark nipples, and my hips gave me little really be ashamed of or shy about. I remembered at times comparing myself to other girls when I was in high school and feeling rather jealous that they were more curvy than I was. But now, I was a Warrior Lycothan with more curves than I&#39;d ever had before. It may have been vain on my part, but my human mind and Lycothan instincts were very much in agreement on that.<br />
<br />
My face didn&#39;t seem too different from what I&#39;d looked like before, though my cheekbones looked a little higher and there was a noticeable difference in my eyes. My eyes were now a bright green with gold flakes in them, and as I looked at the new me, I ran my tongue over my teeth and could easily find the signs of the wolf in me, as my canine teeth were definitely sharper than my teeth had been as a human. Those other signs were in other places too. My fingernails and toenails were sharper than human nails would be. They weren&#39;t quite the claws of my wolven form, but they were enough to draw blood if I put my mind to it. And then there was the juncture between my legs. My mound had mantle of fiery red hair around it growing thicker immediately above my fire and, as I had noticed on Eira when I first came in, had a fine trail of red hair that came up to my naval. The folds of my vagina and my clit were larger than they had been when I was human and had the same wine-dark coloration, like any other Lycothan. My form was strong and I still had the feral beauty that my wolven form, but my muscle was perfect as it filled out my frame and balanced out with my chest and hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think so?&quot; I asked as I flexed one arm, watching my muscles flex in the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Sartari said with a smile and came up closely behind me, placing one hand on my right shoulder and another hand on my other shoulder, &quot;You&#39;re a big girl and a powerhouse Warrior. I&#39;d agree with Raksha that you&#39;d be an excellent candidate for warhammer training once you&#39;re through with basic training.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll look forward to learning all that I can about swinging the hammer around,&quot; I looked to her and gave a slight smile.<br />
<br />
Sartari then gave a firm pat on the back and gave a smile, &quot;Great! It&#39;ll be great to have another who can use the warhammer...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aside from males,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... of course aside from males,&quot; Sartari laughed, shaking her head, &quot;a male Warrior is even bigger than we are... but as I&#39;m sure the Captain&#39;s told you, they keep us separate from the males. So I was only referring to our sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
I only nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though that&#39;s all for the future,&quot; Lartara commented, &quot;both you and Eira will need to complete your basic training first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Eira and I both said as Lartara walked by and dropped her towel into a small plastic laundry hamper. Many of the others did the same as they followed her. Sartari even unwrapped the towel from around her hips and placed it in the hamper. It was a complete lack of shame, and a part of me wondered where that came from with Lycothans originally, but at the same time, I felt I didn&#39;t have anything to be ashamed of either and went along with it a &quot;when in Rome&quot; sort of idea. As such I dropped my towel into the hamper with the others, figuring a Servant would probably be by later to take hamper to do the laundry.<br />
<br />
After leaving the bathroom/showers, most of the others turned and went through the doors into the living area of the barracks or toward the barracks&#39; actual sleeping quarters. Lartara, meanwhile, stood more towards the exterior door and between the rows of lockers that I&#39;d been lead past on my way to becoming Harkaal earlier that evening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Harkaal... tomorrow will include getting your crest and being checked in with the Alphas as a Warrior under my command,&quot; Lartara spoke, &quot;this will include a direct report to the facility&#39;s commandant. To do so, you will need to be uniform before you can do either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I answered, &quot;will I get a locker of my own? Or will I need to share with someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll share with you,&quot; Eira said in a husky voice from beside me.<br />
<br />
Lartara ignored the comment and moved over locker that was near the door to the rest of the facility and on the other side of the hallway that the two rows of lockers formed from Eira&#39;s locker.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have your own locker, Harkaal and in it your uniform is ready,&quot; Lartara answered, &quot;It&#39;s been waiting for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s been waiting for me?&quot; I asked, feeling my heart flutter a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lartara said with a smile, &quot;Remember, I&#39;ve long seen Harkaal inside Human 992014... so I made sure I was ready...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For my emergence,&quot; I answered with a smile. There was something in Lartara&#39;s tone that gave me the impression that she&#39;d wanted to say my human name, but couldn&#39;t, as as far as I knew, Lartara and I were the only ones  in the room that remembered our human pasts. Lartara nodded at my comment. &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again Lartara nodded.</p>
