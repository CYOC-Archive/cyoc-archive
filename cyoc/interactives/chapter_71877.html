<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“It has to be people who need help,” said Nicole.  “People who will most benefit from working here.”<br />
<br />
“Do you mean someone unemployed?” I asked.<br />
<br />
She shook her head.  “No, someone who has it worse than that,” she answered.<br />
<br />
“You mean a homeless person?” I asked.  <br />
<br />
She nodded.  “We’d give someone both a home and a job.  I really think it’s the best thing to do,” she said.<br />
<br />
“OK, I see your point,” I said.  “But how do we find them?  Go scour the streets?”<br />
<br />
“You’re so forgetful sometimes,” she chastised me.  “That,” she said as she pointed at the ring.  “Let them <br />
come to us.”<br />
<br />
“So you want to have two random homeless people find their way here and not remember why?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I guess,” she said slowly.<br />
<br />
I said, “We’ll have to do something about that gate.  Make it automatic so that we can open it from here or <br />
something.”<br />
<br />
“Then do it,” she said.  <br />
<br />
“OK,” I said.  “I wish that the gate in front of the house was fully automatic and could be opened by remote <br />
from inside the house.  I also wish that there was an intercom system in front of the house which people could <br />
use to notify us of their presence.”  Nicole chuckled as I finished my wish.  “What?” I asked her.<br />
<br />
“I just wondered if it already had that,” she said.<br />
<br />
“Won’t matter now,” I said.  “So do you want me to ‘summon’ our guests?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, yea, we’re really ready to receive them this moment,” she mocked.  “Let’s show them how weird it will be <br />
by greeting them in the nude.”  She paused, looked up with her eyes and then said, “That might be a fun test <br />
actually.  But no, not now.  Which bedroom is mine?” she asked.  I pointed her in the right direction.  “I’m <br />
going to put on something that looks right, you’d better do the same,” she said as she went to her room.<br />
<br />
I picked out a pair of khaki shorts and a polo shirt.  It seemed right to me considering the warmth of the <br />
summer day, that it was a weekend, and that I was now a leisured man of wealth.  Nicole came back into the <br />
room after several minutes.  She wore a short, gray skirt and a button-down white shirt.  “Going to the <br />
office, are we?” I teased her.<br />
<br />
She looked me up and down and scoffed.  “I have to teach you how to dress,” she said.  “That’s a project for <br />
another time.”  She beckoned me to follow her downstairs.  We descended to the first floor and went into one <br />
of the living rooms.  “Go ahead,” she said.<br />
<br />
“We’re going to do this one at a time,” I said.  She nodded in approval.  “I wish that a random homeless man <br />
who doesn’t have any kind of drinking or drug problems but is just in need of a home and a job would find his <br />
way to the mansion gate.”<br />
<br />
Nicole looked at me and asked, “Why did you specify no drug problems?”<br />
<br />
“Easier that way,” I answered.  “One less wish to have to make.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly a quick buzzing sound echoed in the house.  At first neither of us knew where to look for an intercom <br />
system.  I finally glanced at the front door and saw one just to the side of it.  We ran up to it and I <br />
pressed the talk button.  “Yes?” I asked.<br />
<br />
A voice replied, “Excuse me, but I am in need of some assistance.  Can you find it in your heart to…lend a <br />
hand?”  The voice was sad, weak and full of defeat.  There was a definite sense of pity in the voice, but <br />
disgust as well.  This sounded to me like someone whose spirit and pride were destroyed and had nothing but <br />
resentment for himself.<br />
<br />
“Absolutely, come on in,” I said.  I pressed the button to open the gate.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, sir,” said the voice.<br />
<br />
I realized that we had no way of seeing this poor man.  So I made a wish for there to be a small, discreet <br />
camera system around the gate, and for the video output to display above the intercom system.  It appeared in <br />
time for us to see the gate swinging open and the man walking slowly inside.  He appeared to be suspicious of <br />
the gate for some reason.  Perhaps he sensed he was being watched.<br />
<br />
“Here goes a test,” I said to Nicole.  “For time’s sake and all.  I wish that the man would appear at the <br />
bottom of the steps leading to the front door, and that he would not notice he was magically transported from <br />
one place to the other and would remember that he walked the whole way to the steps.”<br />
<br />
We looked back at the video monitor and saw the man vanish.  Satisfied that the wish worked, we did not bother <br />
to see if he was at the steps.  However, Nicole got a little anxious and opened the door before the man fully <br />
climbed the steps.  “Hello, hello, come on in,” she said cheerfully.  She was too cheerful, actually.  <br />
<br />
The man entered the house cautiously.  He appeared taken aback at Nicole’s welcome.  He carefully wiped his <br />
feet on a mat inside the door.  He also constantly looked down, as if he was afraid to lift his head.  His <br />
hands gripped a cap that was extremely worn.  His clothes showed signs of wear as well.  His clothes must have <br />
been laundered recently because there was no odor about them.  His shoes were in much better condition and <br />
seemed new.<br />
<br />
The man himself appeared to be in fairly decent shape.  His hairline showed signs of receding and his hair was <br />
becoming gray.  It appeared he was ginger as the hair that was not gray seemed to be light orange.  He also <br />
had a full mustache and beard that showed the same signs of graying.  He did not appear to be overly skinny or <br />
anything like that.  <br />
<br />
“Good afternoon, miss,” he said.  He looked at me and said, “Sir.”<br />
<br />
“Here, come on and sit down,” Nicole said.  She took him by the arm and led him into the living room.  She <br />
walked him to one of them armchairs and he sat down.  Nicole and I sat in chairs opposite him.  “How can we <br />
help you?” Nicole asked.<br />
<br />
“I don’t mean to trouble ya,” he said, “and I don’t want to take too much of your time.  I’m…”  His voice <br />
trailed off and he looked at the floor.  “I’m down on my luck, ya see, and I saw that this house was occupied <br />
again, so I figured I’d come see if there was any help ya might be needing.”<br />
<br />
Nicole and I played along and looked at each other.  “What did you have in mind?” Nicole asked.<br />
<br />
“Whatever ya might be needing,” he said.  “I’ve done a lot of things in my life, so I feel I could be of good <br />
service to ya for most anything.”<br />
<br />
“Pardon our manners,” I said.  “What is your name, sir?”<br />
<br />
“Edward Pearson,” he answered.<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you, Edward,” said Nicole.  “My name is Nicole Davidson and this is my brother Joe.  Obviously <br />
you know that we just…took over this property.”  Nicole’s hesitation was a bit troubling.<br />
<br />
“That is what I had seen,” answered Edward.  <br />
<br />
“Edward, I’m sorry to pry, but where do you live?” asked Nicole.<br />
<br />
Edward looked down at the floor again.  “Well, ya see, I, uh…go from place to place,” he answered.<br />
<br />
“Shelters?” asked Nicole.<br />
<br />
“Yes, that’s what I meant,” said Edward.<br />
<br />
“Oh, my, you poor soul,” said Nicole.  “That’s horrible.”<br />
<br />
“Well, I’ve been down on my luck for about a year,” he said.  “Haven’t been able to find a job and so I lost <br />
what I had.  But I’m ready to do anything I can.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad you came here,” Nicole said.  “I think we can help you.  We don’t have anyone here to help us yet.  <br />
This is a big house so we definitely need some help.  Do you think you could work as a butler?”<br />
<br />
He stopped looking at the floor and looked at Nicole again.  “I would say ‘yes’ to that,” he answered.  “I’ve <br />
never been one, per se, but I’ve done plenty of things that a butler would do, I suppose.  I sure would do all <br />
I could for ya and hope that I meet your expectations.”<br />
<br />
“I sense that you would,” she said.  She looked at me and I knew what she was going to ask next.  “Edward, <br />
there is one very important thing you need to understand before we could hire you.  You see…”</p>
