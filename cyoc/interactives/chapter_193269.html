<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I had wished for Kathy to tell me why she hated my mother so much and also me.<br />
<br />
She then says that she hated my mother because she had been married to a nice guy and that the man she married had been cheating on her and that if she was to divorce him she would loose everything. She then says that she had wanted more kids but that because of one of the affairs her husband had cause her to get a VD and that it caused her to become infertile.<br />
<br />
She then tells me that since Sara has turned to being just like her father. She then says that she wished that she could of got out of the marriage but that she is stuck. I then tell Kathy that if she had a wish what would it be.<br />
<br />
Kathy then says that if it was possible  I would want to have it where I never signed  the pre-nup. I  then asked Kathy what she would think if it is possible to have it where it had been redid where she would be able to divorce him without any repercussions and having it where he would be the one to lose everything.<br />
<br />
Joey then says that what about Sarah won&#39;t she be still like her father. She then says that she wishes that she could re-raise Sarah without her fathers influence.<br />
<br />
I tell Kathy that I can grant her the wishes but before I do this I want to see what you mean about Sarah and then I wish that I had a way to see what Sarah was doing right now.<br />
<br />
After I said the wish the television was showing Sarah and her father and that it was where they were having  incest. Sarah father was talking but we didn&#39;t know what he was saying. So I made another wish that we could hear what was being said.<br />
<br />
We hear him saying that you need to keep quiet about what we are doing otherwise they might take you from me. I then wished that we had a list of all the females he has had sex with. Just after I had wished that. A file appeared and I show it to Kathy and she has a shocked and then angry look on her face.<br />
<br />
I then asked what is the matter? She says that when Sarah was little and when we would have a date night that we would have a babysitter to watch Sarah and that her husband would give them a ride home.<br />
<br />
She then says that one of the one of the babysitter had been watching Sarah for close to 6 months and then she told us that we would have to find anther because she was asked to help her aunt out while she was going to be gone for awhile.<br />
<br />
I then asked her what was the sitter name and she tells me and we find out that the sitter went to live with her aunt when she had gotten pregnant and that at the time the sitter wouldn&#39;t tell anyone who the father of her unborn child was and that what happened is that her and her aunt had been killed while they were traveling to the hospital but as they where going down a hill because her aunt  lived a on top of a hill. When the tire blew out and that the car went over the side of the hill and landed in a lake upside down.<br />
<br />
I asked her if I could look at the take a look at the list and it was when I see that the youngest was age 7 and that the we found that her parents had been paid off and forced to sign a contract. <br />
<br />
I tell Kathy that what I will be doing is that the prenup that you had signed will be different when you look at it and that where now there is a clause in it for any type of illegal act that they would lose all the riches. I then tell her that she will have to put up with how Sarah is acting until the plan is finished. I then have it where the police had already a file on her husband but that most of the time her husband was able to provide a alibi but I have it where the ones providing the will actually have trouble themselves. <br />
<br />
I then tell Kathy that in a month your husband will be found guilty of rape of a girl that is 12 and that the parents will not be bought off. I then say that all the ones that have been lying  will all be found with stuff to get them arrested. I then tell Kathy that Sarah will after her father goes to jail that Sarah will become a baby again and that at the same time she will become a virgin again. and that she will age again  until she is her current age but without her fathers influence and that she will age to her current but at a rate of 1 year for every 5 days I then tell her that while she is at the age of a baby your body will be able to provide for her.<br />
<br />
She says do that plan.</p>
