<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake turned on the shower, letting it run free while he grabbed a nearby towel and rubbed the unknown sticky <br />
substance out of the hair on his torso and his beard, then quickly rushed through to his parents' room and <br />
rumaged through his dad's wardrobe. He grabbed some underwear and shoved his still erect cock inside, hoping <br />
it would go away before he got downstairs. He pulled some jeans on, not needing a belt as they felt a bit <br />
tight around his waist. Matt banged on the front door again, even louder than the first time. Jake had to <br />
hurry. He grabbed what looked to be the largest shirt out of his dad's wardrobe and put it on. It fit very <br />
snuggly, the shirt design looking warped as it stretched out across his wide chest, and his biceps threatened <br />
to rip the sleeves to pieces. It showed just how big he'd grown, now being a couple of inches taller than his <br />
dad was and a lot more bulkier. Despite being the biggest shirt he could find, it just barely reached the top <br />
of his jeans. It felt like every movement of his body dragged it up, exposing his hairy stomach. He checked <br />
himself in the full-length mirror in the room. Everything looked tight on him, like the clothes had shrunk in <br />
the wash, but it would have to do for now. Pulling up the jeans as far as he could and tugging his shirt down <br />
further, he ran down the stairs, briefly pausing to make sure the bathroom door was closed, and reached the <br />
door.<br />
<br />
Jake opened the door to his friend, feeling weird as he looked down upon him instead of being equal height and <br />
spoke quickly &quot;Oh my God, I'm so sorry! I've had a bit of a late start, the alarm didn't go off, I was still <br />
getting ready, and... I mean, how can I help you?&quot;. He tried not to flinch at the sound of his deep voice. He <br />
realised he hadn't exactly spoken much when he first discovered his new body. It was a rich baritone, several <br />
octaves lower than he had the day before.<br />
<br />
Matt looked up at him, surprised at the large man being there. He bared a resemblance to Jake's dad, if he'd <br />
become a mountain man. He was large in height and size, but not overweight. Just... large. His clothes looked <br />
tight on him and hair seemed to stick out everywhere. He felt a bit intimidated and said &quot;Oh, I came to get my <br />
friend Jake. But who are you exactly?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm his uncle, uhm, John. Uncle John from his father's side. My brother was a bit worried that he might get <br />
into trouble and asked me to check on him while they were away. I ended up staying the night, and here we <br />
are&quot;. Jake stumbled through his words, hoping he sounded convincing to his friend, who was looking at him in <br />
an odd way. &quot;He's up in the bathroom getting ready at the moment&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt grinned at the news, remembering how excited Jake was about being home alone for the first time. He must <br />
of been so annoyed when his uncle showed up. &quot;Ah, OK. I can wait for him then&quot;. Matt went to enter the home, <br />
but the man stopped him from passing with one of his muscular arms, a troubled look on his bearded face.<br />
<br />
Jake tried to stop his friend from entering, saying as forceful as he could &quot;He's only just got into the <br />
shower now. He's probably going to take a while, so maybe it's best if you went back to the cinema and waited <br />
for him there&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! I've been waiting there for him for an hour! The only reason I came by was to make sure he hadn't <br />
died or something. I'm not heading back just for him to never show up! I'm not leaving without him&quot;. Matt <br />
tried to get by again, but the strange man still blocked the way. He crossed his arms and grunted.<br />
<br />
Jake sighed, knowing that once Matt had something in his mind, he was going to go through with it. There was <br />
no way he'd be able to get him to leave. He pulled his arm away from the door frame and moved aside for Matt <br />
to enter, then pointed up towards his own bedroom, saying &quot;Fine, go and wait for him upstairs, and he should <br />
be with you when he can&quot;. Matt thanked him as he past and headed for the stairs while Jake closed the door. He <br />
felt relieved, wiping sweat from his brow. Then Matt called out to him &quot;By the way, you should probably do <br />
something about your clothes. Looks like they shrunk&quot;. Jake glanced down and saw his shirt had ridden up <br />
towards his chest, exposing his hairy stomach. He noticed Matt looking at him odd when talking to him earlier <br />
but didn't notice his shirt had exposed so much skin. He blushed in embarrassment, barely visible through his <br />
beard. Now that he couldn't get his friend to leave the house, he had to come up with a way to either turn <br />
back into a kid, or convince Matt that he was really Jake and not his hirsute uncle. He still didn't know what <br />
turned him into a man in the first place. He stroked his beard again while thinking, enjoying the feel of it. <br />
Did he really want to be 10 again? Well for now, he'd have to find more comfortable clothing.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Matt had entered Jake's bedroom to wait for him to get ready. He passed the bathroom on the way and <br />
could hear the shower was still running, but the water splashes sounded hollow, like nobody had stepped in <br />
yet. As he entered the room, he noticed the new clock on the bedside table. He grabbed it and turned it over, <br />
thinking his friend must of left it off, but it was turned on. He turned the dial he assumed was the alarm to <br />
the current time, and clicked his tongue when it made no sound. Figures Jake would buy an alarm clock that <br />
didn't work. He put it back on the table-side and squirmed in his seat, feeling uncomfortable for some reason <br />
he couldn't tell.</p>
