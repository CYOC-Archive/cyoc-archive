<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not fully understanding her guilt, Milly decided that she couldn&#39;t just do nothing. Corey may have accepted whoever they were now but Lucia&#39;s disappointment in the situation had been well communicated. She ran wildly through the book looking for any kind of solution when suddenly there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that dinner couldn&#39;t have been much weirder, huh?&quot; Jakob asked.<br />
<br />
Milly just hummed in response at first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will Lucia be ok?&quot; She asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw that&#39;s sweet of you to worry, kiddo,&quot; He reassured, &quot;I&#39;m sure she just needs some time to cool off and relax a bit. I should go check in on her - are you good putting yourself to bed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;mhmm! I&#39;ll go brush my teeth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like a plan, you have a good night,&quot; Jakob kissed his daughter&#39;s forehead and made his way to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Once Milly heard the door open and close, she pulled the book back out from under the pillow. Nothing else in the world could have been more important to her than finding a way to fix Lucia&#39;s feelings. She tossed through the book&#39;s pages trying to find something that could help. It didn&#39;t help that many of the spells were written in old English and were very hard to understand at her age. A drawn picture of someone laughing and having fun did get her attention, though.<br />
<br />
The spell was labeled as &quot;Inebriated Merriment&quot; which Milly kind of understood.<br />
<br />
She began to read aloud the words on the page as the familiar sensations returned. The only difference was the amount of attention she directed in the spell towards Lucia now. Once it was finished, Milly felt like she had just run a mile. Fulfilling her promise to her dad, she brushed her teeth and pretty immediately fell asleep.<br />
<br />
When Milly woke up the next morning it seemed like the issue had actually been resolved. She came down stairs for breakfast to find Willow and Corey perplexed at how good of a mood their mother was in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Milly!&quot; Lucia called, placing a plate of French toast on the table for her.<br />
<br />
Before she could even sit down to eat she was crushed by Lucia&#39;s embrace as she hugged and planted a wet kiss on her cheek. Lucia was never neglectful of course, but she was rarely ever this affectionate. Never this touchy. Pulling away, Milly noted how Lucia was wearing a full face of makeup, which was also rare considering how early in the morning it was. She didn&#39;t say anything as Lucia thoughtlessly continued through her routine.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is weird, right?&quot; Corey whispered to their sister.<br />
<br />
Willow looked at her had-been-brother now wearing some of her own clothes and makeup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, nothing is normal anymore,&quot; She sighed.<br />
-----<br />
The next month or so was interesting to say the least. While yes, Lucia&#39;s mood on Corey&#39;s identity crisis had been redirected, things didn&#39;t at all return to normal. Lucia was generally more active and excitable about literally everything. She started going out more and more often, which wasn&#39;t necessarily a problem until it became a nightly routine. At first with Jakob to different parties and clubs but eventually she started going on her own. Coming home later with every passing night.<br />
<br />
She started dressing like someone a quarter of her age. She wore booty shorts and crop tops, anything that let her show as much cleavage as she could, and started talking with a Californian accent. She straightened her hair. She started to tan. Her makeup became more and more extravagant. Some days Milly swore that Lucia literally looked younger.<br />
<br />
On top of all this she had become increasingly more promiscuous over the weeks that passed. Willow was scarred on the day she caught her mom masturbating, but Lucia carried on with her day like nothing had happened. Lucia may have been lazy before as a mom, but now she was fully irresponsible. Jakob attempted to get her to therapy, but it was difficult to find a diagnosis on someone who was just perpetually in a good mood.<br />
<br />
Milly knew she had to do something again to further rectify the magical hiccups she inflicted on her own family. Milly and her siblings came home early from school on a half day to hear their parents arguing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucia you can&#39;t even be trusted to drive anymore because you&#39;re not paying attention to the road!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But like, baby, how can I pay attention to the road when all I can think about is your thick throbbing cock?~&quot; The pout she made was audible in her tone.<br />
<br />
All three kids wanted to subsequently vomit as they all grimaced at each other. When Jakob opened the door he was surprised to find all the everyone standing near.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a half day, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; He said letting the realization dawn on him. &quot;Damnit, I&#39;m so sorry, guys. I&#39;ll order you some pizza for dinner&quot;<br />
<br />
Willow only scoffed in response as she turned to her room. Milly noted how even Willow&#39;s negative attitude reached a new peak later that night at dinner. When the pizza arrived and everyone was seated, Lucia joined a bit late and guilt free as she kissed her husband. Her kissing clearly shifted to trying to make out as she moved her tongue into his mouth and began grabbing at his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough!&quot; Willow shouted, just barely getting her mom&#39;s attention, &quot;What the fuck has gotten into all of you? How has any of this just become normal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, way to kill a vibe babe&quot; Lucia rebutted rolling her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m killing the vibe? You&#39;ve had a complete mental breakdown over Corey turning into a girl like it&#39;s some kind of magic!&quot; Willow was now losing her breath &quot;and now what? It&#39;s just fine that you&#39;ve become a total slut?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucia blushed at the insult and tossed her hair, thinking it was a compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re all sick!&quot; Willow made her final accusation, threw her plate of pizza on the ground and stormed off to her room.<br />
<br />
Milly knew Willow was right, this was all wrong. She knew that she would have to use the spell book. She had to use it tonight.</p>
