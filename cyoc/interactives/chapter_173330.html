<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You made your way to the nearest clothing store, which was actually just a few minutes away. You use to hang out here a while ago, back when it was just a small shopping mall, but that was before it was sold and then remodeled into a special complex filled exclusively with women&#39;s clothing stores. You gkt a few stares, but no one payed too much attention to you as you browsed through the aisles in one of the more flashy stores. Compared to the others, this one was by far the smallest, but it had just about everything a girl could want if she wanted to look sexy, provocative, or even just down right slutty. They also sold a wide variety of sex toy, bondage gear, and sexy/unique costumes for those with a bit more &quot;creative&quot; interests. Honestly, you felt right at home in this store. <br />
<br />
As you looked, you slowly began accumulating a pile of items in your cart. Things like skin tight dresses, a few latex outfits, a dozen pairs of various high heels, all ranging anywhere from a modest 3 inch, all the way up to a pair of ridiculous 9 inch stripper heels. 3 high heeled boots with various lengths, and even a pair of ballet heels, which you were currently wearing. For casual clothing, almost nothing you picked could be considered conservative in the slightest. The most covering thing was a sleeveless halter neck, crop top sweater. It was the only piece of clothing which covered your breasts in their entirety, although if you leaned in just the right angle, someone could easily still get a glimpse of your side boob. <br />
<br />
As you walked around, making sure you didn&#39;t overlook anything, you came across a rather unexpected sight. Your teacher, Miss. Olivia Shirk, and one of you female classmates, Irie Blake, were shopping together, for sex toys. This was completely out of their usual identities. Olivia was the very well liked, very laid back physics teacher. She was also known for being rather timid. And as for Irie, she was almost unanimously considered an annoying prudish bitch by the rest of the grade, since she always showed an open, almost hostile dislike for anything even remotely provocative in the slightest. A few times it even got to the point where she would call people out for something, even if they technically were not breaking any rules.<br />
<br />
The interesting thing was that Irie had a dog collar on, and Olivia was radiating an unquestionable aura of superiority and confidence over her. It was as if each of their key personality traits were reversed. And this caused you to begin to wonder which versions were their real personalities. Either way, you felt like you had to at least go over and say hi. So you quickly made an edit which gave yourself the ability to speak again, only now you sounded like a girl.<br />
<br />
They both didn&#39;t notice you approaching, so when you finally said something... they both froze in place. &quot;Um... hello? Miss Olivia. Irie. I see that you both are out doing some shopping together. Find anything that you like? I have been meaning to get myself something new too, but I can&#39;t seem to find the right thing. Would either of you happen to have any suggestions?&quot; You opened up, hoping to ease the mood a bit by acting as casual as you could. &quot;Jess! What on Earth are you doing here?&quot; Replied a panic stricken Olivia. &quot;I, well, actually is it really that surprising that I shop here? I am part sex doll you know. I even have been mistaken for one of the products sold here, on more than one occasion too.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s right, you definitely are part sex doll. My mistake. But still, why are you here? This is no place for a student.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was now Irie&#39;s turn to speak &quot;Livi, that isn&#39;t really a strong argument since I am here too you know.&quot; Then she turned to face you &quot;Jess, could you please keep this a secret&quot; she begged. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I don&#39;t really see a problem here anyways, so why would I need to hide it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t really appropriate for a teacher to be intimate with one of their students, well besides with you, but you are an exception. Please, just don&#39;t even speak about it, or Livi could lose her job or worse.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Again, I said I won&#39;t. I just wanted to say hi and ask if you had any recommendations was all. I don&#39;t judge either.&quot; You made sure to show just a lack of interest, so as to not cause her to feel like she needs to keep you quiet. If you knew it would be like this, you wouldn&#39;t have stoped to say hi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, about that&quot; said Olivia, slowly but surely regaining her composure once more &quot;we are in need of something new as well. So why don&#39;t you just join us for the rest of today? We were planning on spending it together after all anyways, and adding a girl who is part sex doll, may bring us that extra flair we have been looking for.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I don&#39;t mind. It sounds like fun.&quot; You reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats great, and I guess you are more of a bottom than a top, just like me right?&quot; Asks Irie as she grabs your hand, running her fingers through your own. &quot;Or perhaps maybe you could do both.&quot; You gave a nod when she said both, and quickly redirected the conversation. &quot;So, now that I am here, what are you girls planning to do next?&quot;</p>
