<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">staring in remorse at these poor chaps as you couldn&#39;t help but grunting in frustration that by chasing them is where you had each one now doomed to watch the mirrors, even you. Involuntarily as there&#39;s nothing much you can do to help in this current form that the two humans were by now already changed into a tiger and a grey wolf while your rabbit friend was by now a big brown bear. so with that in mind, you simply walked over a bit with being turned also into a white tailed buck of a big 8 pointer as you then stand there and witness yet another metamorphosis from what had happened.<br />
<br />
While each of their clothes disappeared like thin air, like before with your fellow rabbit friend that the two panicked more and more as they were also more confused than ever. while growing to amazing lengths that even their nose and mouths were melting together into a snout as they were shortly shaping into something less than human. with each features was taking form for one was growing out fur of strips that the other was grey and black as their hands and feet morphed into the paws fit for them for you soon saw a large feline with a canine, which makes you think firstly of a tiger and a wolf that it was further confirmed when the bodies were readjusting in terms of their weight, height, and balances for you secondly thought of them might want to eat you for a hungry meal to actually want to run out of there, even if you&#39;ll be stuck with the body of a 8 point white tailed deer for the rest of your miserable life to stay out of fear.<br />
<br />
by this time, the fur nearly takes over as they were nearly completion that you see their arms and legs reshaping into strong and powerful legs that the very last thing which remained to come was their tails. the wolf&#39;s tail was more fluffed out to the tiger&#39;s ropy tail that you shortly heard a loud popping sound, signaling to never walking up right on two legs again for it wasn&#39;t long for you to notice where the rabbit was at was now a big brown bear. given by this misfortune, while looking very much horrified by all of this to each of their new forms that You decide to approach the newly-turned bear slowly.<br />
<br />
it was now useless to chase out the two in hope of making them leave unchanged anymore. they&#39;ll have to check countless of times into each of those mirrors in order to find the one to change them back, back into their human shape. they were getting nervous while wondering is to why they were seeing a kangaroo for it was now a deer was nearly approaching a rabbit that was now turned into a big brown bear made things a bit curious as they start questioning on what it is to what they was happening, let alone what was going on here.<br />
<br />
it was clear that the two were not just any animals, but something was very wrong for a kangaroo who was turned into a deer trying to see if the rabbit as it was now a big brown bear was ok. the bear got up to see it was disappointed, the two soon looked at the scared tiger and wolf that you both slowly came close to the wolf and tiger as the two of you were trying your best to not frighten them any more than to what they each had just went through. it was just as the bear had went through for he can understand their sympathy to what they&#39;re going through for it was just like he was to when he turned into was a rabbit while you were a kangaroo, but this was different for there were now two of them while in the forms of a predator that they saw you getting closer with not knowing on what to do upon this point at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Stay back!&quot; the wolf stammers suddenly for the tiger leaped in between you with the bear and the wolf while keeping the wolf safe as the two slowly backed away from the tow of you, yet not closing the distance for you both kept on coming closer. it was not to your surprised to hear human speech from the both of them, not even to the bear and said nothing as your bear friend simply smile back at the two beasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Don&#39;t... don&#39;t come near us, please...&quot; the wolf said in fear now as the tiger said not to worry for her will protect him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Luckily for the both of you, we&#39;re actually not interested into food right about now.&quot; you reply back for even the bear agreed to this. it was then that the wolf simply fainted that the tiger screams out of surprise, almost like he was screaming like a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;wh...wait a minute! you, can talk?! Oh, my god! how... how can this be!? I understand you... but, why?! &quot; shortly after, the wolf came to as to wonder about this too.<br />
<br />
&quot;like I said with him here that it&#39;s dew to Animal speech, I guess.&quot; you said as the bear finished off to what you were saying. this made the two question themselves on what they were talking about, let alone on weather or not to trust them.<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah... it&#39;s ether that, or we used to be like you before... being human.&quot; the bear said as their ears perk up while hearing your words. thinking this was crazy to think that these two animals were actually once human, but they started to believe this story might be true as they were now animals themselves. this started to build up questions that they wanted answers, even if they had to bare their fangs on the two of you to get some.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the wolf asked. judging by the fact that this slightly ran shivers down to the both of them in fear on what this has to do with them, you take a deep breath and began to explain right from the start. even if the bear had a different story, your breath sounded a bit more like a beast to them. so, you started.<br />
<br />
&quot;it&#39;s like to what I&#39;ve explained a while back with him that this is because of the Hall of Mirrors you see before you. you see, each time you stare at a mirror that Judging by the concept of things here is where you become into something else. it&#39;s difficult for it&#39;s completely random for you can be either something disgusting, impracticable, remotely unwanted, beautiful, basically to almost anything in the world...Like us.&quot; you said as the bear put a paw on his belly that you basically grunted by nature.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see what you mean.&quot; the wolf said as the tiger was still not sure of what to think of this, so he asked while wandering at the mirrors that some were towering over him at the moment. &quot;still though... You can try to change over and over again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;its vary risky as there are some risks to this, but yes. it can be accomplice.&quot; the bear said that even you agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;still though, the thought of changing into something too small for us to ever see the the mirrors again means that we may be stuck in those forms for the rest of our lives. not to mention that Either one of us could even lose our minds to the new forms to ever forget that we were once before human... maybe forever.&quot; you said while taking a breather that the tiger gulped in fear for the two of them, before speaking up and from where you left off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look! I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t want to be in this form of a body you got there, forever. as mush as I don&#39;t want to be stuck in this body and be screwed around of being a 8 point buck while my friend here being a big brown bear for hunting season to come. the way you are looking at us is kind of feels like you are a hunter who&#39;s going to hunt us and feast upon us for survival as a part of me now wants to run and escape that i&#39;ll end up trapped in this body for the rest of my life, so i&#39;m staying while fighting these urges.&quot; you said as it made you blush by just saying it while lowering your ears back in shame, tilting your head down to it for you were also looking away from the rest of the group of animals here.<br />
<br />
&quot;s, sorry on saying it. I&#39;m...not sure how I feel yet, but I, we, can definitely try and help you guys out in any way possible as of to change you both back.&quot; you said finally as the wolf and tiger wiggled their tails with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;so then, What about you? are you going to try one too?&quot; the wolf said that this surprised you both for a moment, so you then the bear take a deep breath first for this, before sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;ah well, he&#39;s sort of given up on that - for now at least. you see, he was first turned into a 5 year old kid as he was then turned into a little girl that shortly after was later brought back as a woman by some weirdo for he soon grew back into his own age of 20 while leaving the house of mirrors. when he&#39;d reentered though is where he tried to return to his male body, but it only made him turned into a 3 year little girl as he then was a female adult Golden Retriever that by becoming a kangaroo is when he&#39;d found me. trying to chase me out, just as we were doing same to you while trying for you to not look into a mirror that i&#39;ve did just like the two of you did and turned into a rabbit. soon afer, you all came as we finally came to this current conclusion In which we bear at the moment. an 8 point buck, a tiger, me being a big brown bear, and a grey wolf.&quot; the bear said as you were almost crying into tears from hearing this that it almost sounded like an argument at the end of his speech.<br />
<br />
The two was obviously struck by this story. they didn&#39;t say anything at first, but the wolf was processing on what he&#39;d had just learned by what he heard this from the bear. the tiger was also thinking the same way as you were whipping off a few tears that you were stun when the tiger jumped in to give you pounce of a hug, even if it scared the both of you a bit by this.<br />
but it felt like a baby joy was now in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;So um,... besides jumping onto me like i&#39;m some kind of prey here, What are you going to do now?&quot; you asked as The tiger jumps off after words for he then ponders for a bit. He then looks up at the two of you and seems to be telling you some sort of answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;W...well, of course I do want to change back. I&#39;ve just got hook up with a nice looking girlfriend that my friend here set me up with. I can&#39;t imagine if she&#39;ll still ever want to be with me, when I basically look... like a tiger...&quot; he says, looking over his large, furry feline form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t argue with you there. being stuck to be hunted down by hunters for your meat while having your head mounted on the wall while staring off into space in one direction for the rest of your life, that&#39;s pretty much a scary thought that said, what should we do for now?&quot; You ask, looking apprehensively around the room as the bear ponders for a moment, before the wolf began to coming up with an issue that its tail was tucked between the legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;uh, guys! we might have a problem.&quot; he said as he sheepishly turned around for his rear to be shown that by lifting the tail up, we saw why. he was now not only a grey wolf, but as a she wolf that the tiger&#39;s friend was blushing red to start panting for the canine tongue began to stick out of her mouth. this was making you blush as you were admiring her beauty, before realizing what was happening that you felt a strange feeling for it to actually want the wolf person to stay female. Wait!... what were you thinking?!<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah guys! *paint* looks like i&#39;m now, A Big Bad Bitch! *paint, paint* wimpier&quot; the wolf said as you were now willing to actually help out on what was happening, while secretly keeping the part on the the thought of to keep the female wolf to yourself. <br />
<br />
<br />
You weren&#39;t sure about this place anymore for you were turned into a girl twice, aged, de-aged, doggified, a normal kangaroo, to a 8 point white tailed deer as your friend here who found and saw you was a cute bunny before that he&#39;s now a big brown bear while your two new friends are now a tiger and a female wolf. the bear was still silent about this that the group, including you began to think about what your next move be while following onto this strange and mysterious set of events. with any luck though that For the moment, There&#39;s bound to be at least one mirror somewhere here to change us all back to normal. there just might be even one for our she wolf friend here too.<br />
<br />
some of you may want to leave this place, but you may never get another chance of returning back to normal that you&#39;ve all agreed to stay together. well... at least three of you for the next question now is, what now?</p>
