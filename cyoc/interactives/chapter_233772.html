<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Why are you looking at me funny?&quot; Amy said with your mother&#39;s voice, her eyes still sparkling like Amy&#39;s do when she &#39;playful.&#39;<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but stare with a concerned look. Your mom was coming-on to you. You were somewhat thrilled, intrigued, disgusted, scared, aroused, and repulsed. But mostly confused with all this even though at first you just thought it would be funny. You really knew it was Amy and you wanted to mess around &#39;cause &quot;she&#39;s different&quot; now and it&#39;d be something new, but each time you get comfortable with that, you looked into your mother&#39;s face and your mind threw a fit about how wrong doing anything with your mother was.<br />
<br />
While you&#39;re pondering the situation and acting so strange, Amy waited for your answer then finally got very concerned herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s with that strange look on your face? It&#39;s like you&#39;re scared of me, or ... OMG ... you&#39;re going to break up with me!&quot; Then her eyes got red. She backed up slowly and turned away.<br />
<br />
Like a fool, you just lay there thinking about your mom crying, not your girlfriend. You had never really seen your mom cry except about great aunt Suzie&#39;s death. You didn&#39;t know what to do then either and just stood around like a statue until she eventually hugged you, and you sort of patted her back with your arms loosely around her.<br />
<br />
But this was really Amy, and she was starting to sob and about to run out of the room, when you finally recovered and said, &quot;NO. Wait. It&#39;s not that at all.&quot; and you pushed yourself off the bed to stand and stop her. Fortunately, she stopped and slowly turned around to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re ... not ... breaking up?&quot; she whimpered wiping the tears from your mother&#39;s face and sniffling.<br />
<br />
Your mother&#39;s green eyes were pleading with you. Her whole look was as if helpless, and you&#39;d never seen your mother that way, either. This stirred something inside you that carried you over to her. You put your arms around her comforting her. Her head went against your chest and shoulder as she wrapped her arms around your waist still breathing in little sobs. You could feel the leftover moist tears soaking into your shirt.<br />
<br />
It was a strange feeling to be holding your mom this way and feeling so concerned and caring for her. Her body was full, unlike Amy&#39;s thin frame. Your mom&#39;s much larger breasts than Amy&#39;s little buds pressed against you and felt amazingly good. You kept hoping Amy would blossom more as you have always been fascinated with big breasts. You instinctively pressed your head against her head putting your nose into her blond hair. She smelled of violets - your mother&#39;s shampoo that you always associated with her. Your eyes looked down at the straight, short blond hair and the back of your mom&#39;s house dress and her nice round rump. So different from Amy&#39;s long wavy brown hair and little butt. It seemed more sensual as if you had gone from the little leagues to the big. It was a mature women you were holding and looking at, and it made you feel good, comfortable, and a little excited. That&#39;s when you found yourself really enjoying all these new sensations being in close contact with this female body.<br />
<br />
Just then, a most pleasing thought blossomed in your male teenage mind. Holding a woman&#39;s body different from Amy was thrilling, and there really wasn&#39;t any guilt since you weren&#39;t actually cheating on Amy since she&#39;s inside. That means ... you could have any girl from school that you wanted, at least (or most male importantly) have her physically, like Celia Bankshire. Or any teacher. Or any of the school staff college interns. Umm! Or any woman for that matter. Cedric Walsh&#39;s MILF. UMMM!<br />
<br />
As your thoughts wandered with visions of each of the beautiful female bodies available for your enjoyment, you became even more excited. Your pants were quickly filling, and you snuggled more affectionately with Amy, now oblivious to this being your mother&#39;s body. Obviously, Amy could recognize your growing arousal and sense your caring by the way you were now hugging your mother&#39;s body with her mind in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You do still love me?&quot; your mom&#39;s voice asked softly as she turned her head back around to look you in the eyes. Her voice was so loving as she added, &quot;I love you so, John.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your mind was becoming too confused again knowing this was Amy but seeing your mother. Here you were holding your mother&#39;s body with your girlfriend&#39;s mind and you had inadvertently made her think you weren&#39;t interested in her any more because of the way you had looked at her in your mom&#39;s body. Your mom actually did have a fairly nice figure especially for a forty-something. A little extra here and there (especially on the chest which were really nice though you never thought of her in this way before). Her face was pretty enough, just not a young as Amy but not really wrinkled or anything. You felt a deep attraction for her, being either horny for Amy or caring for your mom. It was like the best of each, and you wanted to make it last.<br />
<br />
This forced a contented smile to your lips as Amy looked longing at you with your mother&#39;s face. This made her cheer up and your mom&#39;s eyes start to sparkle. As you looked at her now so needing to be comforted, you found yourself relaxed and lowering your head towards her, your lips starting to twitch as you just closed your eyes when you clearly recognized it was your mother and said ...</p>
