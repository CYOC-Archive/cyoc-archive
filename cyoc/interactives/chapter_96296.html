<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer couldn’t fathom what was occurring. She desperately pushed down on her right foot to free her left, but it’s as if she was trying to move against concrete; she didn’t move at all. Adrenaline flared, energy ran throughout her body. She frantically pushed down on her left and right, alternating as she wiggled in the pot. But nothing happened. Confusion hastened into panic as fear started setting in.<br />
<br />
A moment later, it felt as if her toes were splitting into dozens of different strings. Jennifer tried pushing more energy into her legs, but the movement was fruitless. Whereas there was once feeling of energy rushing down to her toes there was but numbness below her knees. She slowly kneeled down and pushed down on the pot’s outer rims as if to lift herself out of the pot. Amassing all her strength into her arms whilst wiggling all about, she felt a tingle running slowly up her legs. Feeling her skin, it was oily and soft. She yelped as if the skin had become extremely sensitive. Terror turned into horror as she saw her legs melt away into one another, beginning from the soil she was planted on. Green slowly ran up to her skin as if keeping pace with the merging, stopping at her waist.<br />
<br />
The girl wiggled everything she could, but to no avail. “Help me!” she screamed, beads of tears forming around her eyes. “I’m stuck!” The classroom clock kept its steady beat. The students yawned as the teacher gave his lecture. Nobody even turned to her. Her legs continued, slipping through and covering her groin. Her hips visibly swelled twice her natural size, causing her to cover herself in shame. Suddenly, her thighs pushed out, becoming round and bulbous, as if forming an elongated peach.<br />
<br />
Helplessness became hope when she could feel her feet suddenly explode with warmth. Her legs felt wet and no longer adhered to dirt. Believing it an opportunity, Jennifer pushed down once more with all her might. The pot broke. She yelped with joy! Dirt quickly dropped onto the floor. She was free.<br />
<br />
…Only to see the large bulb wrapping up to her waist still intact. She tried running, jumping, moving her legs, anything — but to no avail. She was firmly stuck within the bulb.<br />
<br />
Slowly, her prison peeled backwards, revealing what seemed to be a large flower. Surveying her surroundings, she saw that there were five big petals of warm pink. Her legs were intact, albeit with a slick texture. The petals tapered off just above mid-thigh. Numerous leaves present below the petals shook as if breathing in the fresh air. Sugary orange sap spilled out from the flower and onto the floor. It didn’t feel very sticky at all, though it slowly ran down the leaves beneath.<br />
<br />
Jennifer tried moving once more. She could move her hips, waist — everything above her knees. No matter what, she could not escape from this new prison. Finally, the sap stopped overflowing, remaining level just slightly below her thighs.<br />
<br />
She felt an irritation in in the lower half of her body. Gradually, her thighs grew wider, with her skin oily and sweet-smelling. “Not again!” she panicked. The irritation spread up towards her butt, and her posterior grew until it naturally formed the shape of a heart. When it went through her waist, she felt her lungs burn and her bones constrict, her waist narrowing until it was half her enlarged hips.<br />
<br />
The prickliness from her lungs sprouted upwards through her throat. She tried stopping it by putting her hands on her neck. Regardless of her effort, it broke through, passing through her mouth. She smelled what she breathed — a saccharine, syrupy fragrance that smelled more honeyed than the sap that she stood in. Fred, the boy nearest to her and a diligent student in the front row, blushed furiously as he tried to listen to the teacher’s lecture.<br />
<br />
With a rush of vitality in her chest, her breasts ballooned, each being the size of her head. Her wet and oily skin only ensured that light shimmered off of all of her body. A small, fresh and scented odor began emitting from her as she twisted and squirmed to free herself. Her scalp itched, and she began scratching it furiously. Her hair abruptly spurted down to her waist, becoming a light pink. Rubbing strands of hair, she felt as if she was touching silk. Jennifer, aggravated, twisted and turned, her breasts and ass swaying silly as she futilely to release herself from confinement.<br />
<br />
Tenderness spread throughout of something unknown. Jennifer touched a petal of her flower once more, feeling what was like a muted, soft touch. “I can feel through the flower?” She pinched the petal, and it only hurt a little bit. Tenderness gave way to soreness, and then pink, purple, and white flowers exploded forth from underneath the petals, all surrounding Jennifer.<br />
<br />
The warmth of noon egged a portion of the newly born flowers to drip wet with sweet sap. Some of the sap slowly streamed down Jennifer, so she squirmed and moved the flowers around to make sure that it wouldn’t drip on her and into her pool of sap instead. With limited success, as one flower made its way to drip on her shoulder again. She groaned in frustration.<br />
<br />
And then everything was dark and warm. Jennifer tried moving her hands to her face, but found that they were restricted. She attempted to scream and yell, but she couldn’t move her mouth. Something wrapped up her hips and caught hold of her breasts. She tussled about furiously, but she couldn’t reposition any part of her body.<br />
<br />
Light returned. Everything about her was intact. She saw flowers around her retreat back to her surroundings. They stood still as if nothing had happened at all. Looking downwards, she saw her breasts cupped by a few petals forming a bra. Purple elbow gloves that started just below her shoulders sprouted pink petals upwards, whilst her hands were covered with pink, soft petals. Looking even further below showed a single pink petal that stuck to her groin and protected her vagina. As she looked downwards, her hair, organized into a long ponytail, fell over her right shoulder. Feeling her hair, she realized that a flower was somehow keeping her hair in place, acting as a sort of scrunchie.<br />
<br />
One moment, two. No changes occurred further. Touching the flowers elicited no response except feeling that these flowers were a part of her. The air was calm as the sunlight shone in strongly at Jennifer’s back, marking the symbol of summer. Birds tweeted outside making merry song. Students continued writing whatever was on the board. Young Erik kept sleeping in the back, his manhood quite strong. The teacher, Edward, slammed his pointer down onto the table, haphazardly erased the blackboard, and started putting his things into his brown bag.<br />
<br />
“And so class has ended,” the teacher remarked suddenly. He seemed to be in a hurry. Students were dumbfounded as they repeatedly looked between the teacher and the clock. Class still had ten minutes remaining. Showing astounding initiative, Fred, the boy nearest Jennifer, quickly ran out of the class with his stuff in his arms. The other students gradually followed in tow, chattering and leaving the classroom after they had gathered their bags.</p>
