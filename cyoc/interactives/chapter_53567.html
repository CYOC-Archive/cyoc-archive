<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Coming out of the bedroom, her little voice crying for Karen to stop, Declan stopped and watched as Denise came up the stairs. Upon seeing Declan, she said, &quot;I thought I told you to take a nap before mother comes home,&quot; as Karen said, &quot;That's not Katie. It's Declan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a step, reaching out as if she was about to grab Declan, Denise stopped as what Karen said suddenly dawned on her. Looking at Karen, she asked, &quot;That's Declan?&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Karen as Declan hastily explained, &quot;It's that amulet. The one I am always looking at and studying online. It turned me into Katie when I accidentally touched it to a pair of her underwear,&quot; but stopped as she suddenly realised how silly what she was saying, the fact of how her voice sounded and the look on Denise's face.<br />
<br />
Glaring at her sister, Declan cried out, &quot;I am not lying, if that is what you are thinking,&quot; as she stomped her foot.<br />
<br />
Covering her mouth, attempting to hide the fact that she is smiling, she reached over and flicked on the hallway light. After a moment, she finally dropped her hand and said, &quot;Even if that amulet were real and it could change you into a girl, it wouldn't be Katie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Staring at Denise, wondering what was going on, Declan took in the look of confusion on Karen's face. Seeing this, Denise waited another moment or two and then said, &quot;You see, about three years ago I over heard you best mate, Egon, complain to mother that several bits of his sister's clothes were disappearing from the laundry hamper. Stepping in, I explained my concern that several pieces of my laundry, Karen's and Katie's clothes as well, have also been going missing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing the incredulous look on Declan's face, Denise continued by saying, &quot;We couldn't prove it was you, but we had our suspicion. So we started leaving clothes about. Clothes that really belonged to nobody because they were store bought, but looked a great deal like what Alexandrina, Karen, Katie and I would wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell,&quot; Declan thought as Denise finished by saying, &quot;It was either this or try to catch you in the act, but you were to sneaky to be caught. So we figured you'd come out eventually about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And now you have and you look so cute,&quot; Karen cried out as Declan mumbled, &quot;So these aren't Katie's panties?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a striking resemblance to Katie, but I can already tell that you are not her.&quot; and turning about, Denise went back downstairs, leaving Declan and Karen at the top, both wondering what was going to happen and where Denise had went.<br />
<br />
After a bit, Denise came back, holding a family album. Flipping it open, she points to several pictures, telling Declan as she does so, &quot;Katie at age five. And though you have the same hair length, the auburn colour is off by a shade. That, and you body build is just a hint smaller then her's,&quot; and flipping to other pictures, Declan, and Karen, began to see that Denise is right.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I am not Katie?&quot; Declan asked, to which Denise, still smiling, nodded her head.<br />
<br />
Turning away from the two older girls, Declan started back toward Katie's room. Behind her, Denise demanded, &quot;And where do you think you are going, young lady,&quot; as she grabbed a hold of Declan's hand, stopping the five year old girl in her tracks.<br />
<br />
Looking at Denise, Declan whined out, &quot;I need to get the amulet. Change myself back. I can't let mom see me like this. She'll flip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaking her head, Denise looked at Karen and announced, &quot;I think our brother,&quot; she giggled and then said, &quot;Our little sister needs to be punished for what she did.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod from Karen and Denise explained, &quot;For stealing mine, Karen's, Katie's, and Alexandrina's clothes, I think you should stay like that for a bit. And mother will find out. And after that, we will take you over to Egon's and you will both explain what has happened, what you have been doing and then apologise to both him, his sister and their parents. Now, until mother gets home, you are in time-out. I want every single article of clothing you have ever taken.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, but,&quot; Declan sputtered out, trying to find a way out of the nightmare she suddenly felt trapped in.<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts,&quot; Karen cried out. &quot;You will listen to your sister and do as she tells you, young lady. Now, march,&quot; and to Declan's horror, Karen took her other hand and between the two of them, they forced Declan back to her room.<br />
<br />
Inside, Declan was forced to hand over every single article of clothing, even the underwear she was wearing. Watching as Karen, who had disappeared at some point while she brought forth the clothing she had taken, dumped it in a garbage bag. As this occurred, Declan listened as Denise explained, &quot;I am sure mother still has your clothes from when you were younger somewhere. I am going to find them and you will wear them. Understood?&quot; and before Declan could nod, she turned and disappeared out of the room, followed by Karen, who was carrying the trash bin bag.<br />
<br />
Sitting on her bed, looking down at her young, female body, Declan felt the sting of tears come to her eyes as she thought, &quot;This is not how it was supposed to turn out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moments later both Karen and Denise were back. In Karen's hand was the Amulet of Zulo, which placed in a Ziploc bag as Denise handed a pair of pants and a blue t-shirt with Pikachu on the front to Declan. Taking the offered clothes, she asked, &quot;No underwear?&quot; as she pulled on the shirt and then the pants, noting that there was no zipper or buttons in front, just one elastic band that stretched all the way around.<br />
<br />
Denise shook her head as she looked at the amulet and said, &quot;I couldn't find anything and I certainly not giving you a pair of Katie's.&quot; a grin spread across her face and she added, &quot;You would like that to much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Turning, the two girl's left, leaving Declan sitting on her bed, the sting of tears sharper then ever. After a moment, she lay down and curling up, she stuck her thumb in her mouth and feeling the tears slip down out of her eyes, she thought, &quot;This is not the way it was supposed to turn out,&quot; as she slowly cried herself to sleep.</p>
