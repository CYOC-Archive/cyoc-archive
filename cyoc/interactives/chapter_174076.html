<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ok…here is the plan.” Said Mike as they all gathered around the table talking in low whispers. “They reinforced the door after Nate’s little magic blast.” <br />
<br />
All eyes turned toward the door which had been reinforced with magical means but still showed the signs of the blast. It had some marks on the door and looked a little craved in. <br />
<br />
“If they have built this room just like we do on land then there is likely multiple chambers like this to our right and our left. Likely a series of rooms, like a hospital room with a matching room on either side.” Explained Mike, everyone took Mike’s word for it. It made sense and Mike did just finished school number one in his class for Architecture and had won multiple awards across the nation and a few international awards as well. “The door is likely reinforced because that is where people would assume people trapped inside would try to escape from there. However, the side walls are likely not reinforced…a strong blast could burst a hole in it. Our best bet would actually be one of the bathroom walls, they are likely lest reinforced.”<br />
<br />
“Since every time a merperson comes in they turn to the right, so if we do this we should try to blast to the right.” Stated Stacy <br />
<br />
“It is likely that instead of another room we could end up blasting through to a hallway.” added Mike “It is human nature to use the closest room to the end of a hallway and fill the rooms farther down the hallway last. Either way if we blast into another room instead of a hallway the door should be unlocked and we can escape.”<br />
<br />
“And then what?” inquired Rose “I hate to rain on everyone but once we get out into either the hallway or into another room what do we do? We know nothing about what we would be walking into.”<br />
<br />
“Swimming in.” corrected Nate as he crossed his arms and let out a heavy sigh. “And I don’t know how I even did that…energy blast thing…I just got very angry and let it all go.”<br />
<br />
“Well if you don’t do it then we will all become merpeople and get trapped in this world.” Stated Sam with some anger still in his voice. A look from Taylor did shut him up but his anger was still visible. <br />
<br />
“You have to try.” Added Taylor<br />
<br />
“Or not.” offered Kelly as people looked at her. “Maybe instead of trying to escape we should try to fit in and find out how to get out. If Nate can become human as a baby, we can find out how and do it.”<br />
<br />
“The best way to find information may to go with the flow and find out what type of world we are going into.” added Kenny <br />
<br />
“The longer we wait…the harder it will be to explain what happened.” countered Sam “We can’t say…well we became merfolk which is why we where away for a x amount of time, we would be thrown in a mental hospital if we did that.”<br />
<br />
“And how long would we last if we made it out and then where discovered right away? We need more information.” Countered Kelly <br />
<br />
“This is all pointless.” Stated Nate as all eyes turned toward him. “I don’t know if I can even do that magical blast thing again…until we know I can do that it is pointless.”<br />
<br />
“He has a point.” Confirmed Mike “Alright let’s work on that.”<br />
<br />
It took hours, but in the end they got next to nowhere. The closest they got was blue energy gathering around Nate’s fingers, but it faded the moment it was noticed by Nate. Rose was by him most of the time but she found herself sitting on one the slabs resting, the transformation was still taking it out of her. <br />
<br />
“How are you doing?” inquired Taylor as she swam up and sat beside her friend.<br />
<br />
“I have been better…Nate is getting frustrated.” Stated Rose as she watched Nate once again try to gather magic around his hands.  <br />
<br />
“I must apology for Sam…he is getting frustrated with Nate.” Whispered Taylor as Rose eyed her friend. “And so am I.” <br />
<br />
“It isn’t Nate’s fault that we are….” Started Rose as Taylor raised her hand.<br />
<br />
“I know, he isn’t at fault we are becoming merfolk but I wonder if he actually wants to stay here.” Stated Taylor as Rose eyed her friend. “He did grow up without a family and now…”<br />
<br />
“He may have a family.” Whispered Rose as she saw where Taylor was going. <br />
<br />
“That is a strong lure and being a prince isn’t bad either…however I wonder if you or he has considered something.” stated Taylor as Rose looked at her. “We know nothing about how their society works and Princes at least until the modern age had arranged marriages to Princess, they didn’t marry commoners.”<br />
<br />
Rose saw where Taylor was going as she looked at the floor, her tail filling in even more with shades of reds and pinks. <br />
<br />
“Well…we will….” Started Rose as suddenly the door opened. All eyes turned toward the large doors as four merman and four mermaids entered the room.<br />
 <br />
Four of them two mermaids and two merman where dressed in what looked to be legless medieval armor, with short swords on their hips and spears in their hands. They looked like ceremonial guards however the other four wore what looked to be modern looking body armor and what seamed to be strange rifles on their backs and pistols on their hips, they looked like a modern security detail.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck.” Said Nate as a rather large and well built merman dressed in the ceremonial armor but lacking a spear swam into the room along with the mermaid doctor. <br />
<br />
“Captain Adonis…here he is.” Said the mermaid doctor as they swam up to Nate. “Here is Prince Cain.” <br />
<br />
The armored merman studied Nate with a stern face before bowing to him.<br />
<br />
“Prince Cain…you can’t believe how happy we are to have you back, we all thought you where dead.” Said this well-built merman “We are your royal honor guard and official protection detail and there is no way we will let harm come to you.”<br />
<br />
“Ah…hello.” Said Nate as he looked around confused. <br />
<br />
“This must be confusing for you and believe me the Palace is working on bringing you back into the fold.” Said Captain Adonis before giving a smile. “The general public do not know yet, but when it happens the people will be celebrating across our kingdom and the world. It isn’t often that a Prince comes back from the grave yet alone the heir to the throne.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…” answered Nate not sure what else to say. <br />
<br />
“Sadly the King and Queen, your father and mother are sadly on a diplomatic conformance on the other side of the world but they are rushing home to be with you.” said Captain Adonis before he gave a smile. “However we do have a surprise for you.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Nate as the Captain turned back toward the still open door.<br />
<br />
“Come on in.” said Captain Adonis as all eyes turned toward the door.</p>
