<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You stepped out into the gym floor and made your way over to the rest of the class who were still stretching. You took a spot next to your best friend, Ryan, and began to stretch as well. Looking across the gym, you saw your girlfriend, Emily, in the other class who had gym at the same time as yours. The classes normally rotated who was in the gym and who was in the weight room, but today their teacher was out sick, so you all had gym together. It was the perfect time to dump her in front of everyone.<br />
<br />
Of course, in this reality, she couldn&#39;t have cheated on you with Jason, because you were Jason. Instead, your new memories informed you, she had cheated on you with some guy from another school because you wouldn&#39;t &quot;put out&quot;. The truth was that she was incredibly narrow-minded and you hadn&#39;t made your double dicks public knowledge yet. You were afraid that if she knew she would be scared off and tell everyone. Now, you got to be the one to tell everyone about her secret: that she was a complete cock-whore, going after any guy she saw even while you were together.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Jackson,&quot; Ryan asked quietly as you stretched, &quot;are you still going to do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; you tell him, &quot;I&#39;m going to dump her ass before we go out to the track.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I got your back.&quot;<br />
<br />
After about five minutes, Coach Hanson called the two groups together. Today you would be going outside to run your laps, since the track was bigger to accommodate the larger group. After he took roll, he began preparing things to time the laps. As he did, the class began talking and Emily came over to you with a fake smile and hugged your waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, boo! Ready to run together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off me,&quot; you say, pushing her arms away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your problem?&quot; she asked, obviously annoyed at being rejected rather than worried about why.<br />
<br />
&quot;My problem is a girlfriend who cheats on me!&quot; you retort. &quot;I know about Adam, and I&#39;m tired of you fooling around on me with any guy that walks by. We&#39;re through, Emily.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re dumping me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad you understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t dump me!&quot; she raged, the whole class including Coach Hanson now looking at the two of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like he just did,&quot; Ryan added smartly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine!&quot; she huffed. &quot;I didn&#39;t like you anyway. Your only good for your money!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Emily turned and stormed back to the locker room, making the coach and her friend run after her. Some of the class cheered you on, but most stayed quiet, which was fine by you: you didn&#39;t need their approval. But one who did seem oddly quiet was Ryan, who was now looking at you with a strange expression as if he was just realizing something and wanted to tell you, but was holding back. You decided to let it be and the class was soon led outside sans Emily.<br />
<br />
After your run, you returned to the locker room, changing out of your sweat-drenched gym clothes. Normally, you didn&#39;t shower after gym because of the whole two-penises thing, which was fine because almost nobody else showered either. There was only one guy who did, and that guy had been staring at you strangely all class: Ryan. You had an idea of what was going on, and if you were right it would fit perfectly into your plan. You scanned your friend into the Chronivac, but didn&#39;t look at any of his stats. All you did was increase his confidence so that he would tell you himself. Then, you grabbed a towel from your bag that you normally just used for sweat, and headed over to the showers. <br />
<br />
Built in the 60s, your school didn&#39;t have individual showers, but a large communal shower separated from the locker room by the bathroom stalls. Since most people didn&#39;t use them, this corner of the locker room was quiet and secluded. Ryan was already in the shower, and when he heard footsteps coming back, he turned to see you wrapped in your towel. He blushed fiercely and turned away quickly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What...what made you want to shower today?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; you play it off. &quot;Just thought it&#39;d be relaxing after what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah, I guess...&quot; he trailed off before you applied the change to his personality and he gained the courage to tell you what was on his mind. &quot;Hey, Jackson? How did you know you were bi?&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;d come out awhile ago, but since you had a girlfriend at the time nobody had really taken notice. Yes, everyone knew you were bisexual, but since you were with a girl nothing was really different. You hoped to change that, and apparently so did Ryan. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just listened to my feelings and didn&#39;t give a damn what other people thought. I think dudes are as sexy as women, if not more sometimes. If anyone else doesn&#39;t like it, tough shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay—then...don&#39;t be offended when I say this, but...I really like you, Jackson. And I&#39;d like it if we could try being more than friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
This was better than you could have hoped for! Jack had always known Ryan was more than a little bi-curious, and had made an entire plan to get Ryan to go out with him after his revenge on Emily and Jason. But now Ryan had come out to you with only minor persuasion from the Chronivac. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ryan,&quot; you said, &quot;I&#39;d love to be your boyfriend, but there&#39;s something you need to know first.&quot; You weren&#39;t worried about him gossiping like you were with Emily, but you still didn&#39;t know how freaked out he would be.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You simply dropped your towel and slowly pulled down your underwear, revealing the two sausages hanging from your crotch. His jaw dropped almost cartoonishly, but he couldn&#39;t hide the fact that his own member was slowly hardening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...that&#39;s hot,&quot; he breathed. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re not too grossed out?&quot; you ask, relieved. This was all going way more smoothly than you had expected. <br />
<br />
&quot;No way, that&#39;s just amazing! Have you...always been like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Since birth,&quot; you answered, which was true for this reality anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;ve got two different eye colors and two dicks,&quot; he said, over the initial shock as you stripped and took the shower next to him. &quot;Anything else you want to show me, you circus freak?&quot; You punched him playfully, laughing at his light-hearted insult as only a true friend can. &quot;So...can I...touch them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, yeah...go ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan reached down and stroked your twin shafts gently, continuing down to fondle your balls where he noticed that they were doubled too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you didn&#39;t have anymore surprises?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I kind of assumed those went together, but I guess you never were very good at multiplying, were you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; He continued to feel you up, bringing you to full mast and truly showing off your massive members. &quot;Damn, you&#39;re hung! I can barely hit seven inches and you&#39;ve got 18 all together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think it works like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It might as well...so, when you...you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Is there a lot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you find out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, here? But we&#39;ll be late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who cares? It&#39;s just English; not like you&#39;re really learning anything new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess...do you want me to just...do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do whatever you want, buddy,&quot; you give him permission. <br />
<br />
Ryan turned off his shower and moved over to yours. The warm water spilling down onto the two of you felt nice, and the sight of your best friend bathing with you was a real turn on. He put his hands on your wet shoulders and slid them gently down your pecs and sides until he reached your crotch. Taking one shaft in each hand, Ryan began giving you a handjob, the pleasure of having two cocks rubbed at the same time both familiar and new, but nothing less than ecstatic. You noticed your right penis was slightly more sensitive, a leftover effect from Jason&#39;s previous change; however, you decided to keep the aberration because it was yet another interesting aspect of your new existence. <br />
<br />
Ryan then placed his own seven inch hardon between yours and stroked them all in unison. The feeling of tender flesh squishing together was more than enough to send Ryan over the edge, but you still had increased stamina from Jack&#39;s change. When you finally came, you felt all four of your balls tense up and your cocks began shooting jets of thick, sticky semen all over yourself and your friend. Ryan smiled excitedly at the sight of the copious cum. You had the production power of two extremely virile males, plus some. <br />
<br />
You actually had to grab onto Ryan for support as you released, the pleasure more than you could take while standing. When you finished, you pulled him closer and noticed a glob of your cum on his neck. Gently sucking it off, you kept it in your mouth before tilting his head and bringing him into a deep kiss. Your tongue danced around his, coating both with your juices and asserting your dominance in the relationship, which Ryan seemed more than happy with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackson, I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you, too, Ryan. I&#39;m so glad you came out to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too...hey, now that we&#39;re boyfriends, what should we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my parents are out of town for the weekend, so maybe you could come over?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that sounds like fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But first, let&#39;s make this relationship official.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
You wouldn&#39;t say anymore, keeping your mouth shut as you helped each other dress, despite Ryan&#39;s pleading. Walking upstairs to your English class just before the bell rang, you sat down next to Ryan, who was still quietly pestering you about what you meant. As the last of the class filed in, Emily took her seat across the room, trying to glare you down. You then pulled Ryan over to you and took him in a deep kiss, your action shutting him, Emily, and the entire class up for the rest of the lesson.</p>
