<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Exiting the portal, the Boss sighed in contentment. Dr. Umba&#39;aku had done it, the door to the kitsune realm was open. Now all he had to do was enact his part of the plan.<br />
<br />
While his subordinates dealt with the remaining wizards, the Boss would take care of the kitsune. Throughout his time dealing with the Catalyst, the kitsune were a constant thorn in his side. The Boss was confident in his plan. After today, they wouldn&#39;t even exist. Gazing around the kitsune capital, he could see various kitsune going about their daily routines, some casting the hooded figure a curious look. Slowly, a six tailed guard now approached. &quot;Can I help you?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you can,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;I need Tatsu and Shizen to come here right now.&quot; The guard raised a furry eyebrow. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but Lord and Lady Shizen will not just appear.&quot; he stated. &quot;If you would state your business I will inform them of your request.&quot; The Boss sighed, he knew just asking wouldn&#39;t yield the results he wanted. He would have to give the pair of celestial a reason. With a flick of his wrist, he now split the six tail kitsune in two, sending the pieces soaring into two adjacent buildings. The wet slap of organic matter made several observing kitsune gasp in horror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; he asked, noticing thw crowd gape at him in horror. &quot;No one&#39;s going to run and grab those two? Okay, guess I got to up the stakes a bit.&quot; Lazily the Boss began casting spells, fireballs crashing into various buildings, sending debris soaring into the air. With buildings engulfed in flames, the Boss finally had his desired results as the kitsune populace ran in the other direction. &quot;Thank you,&quot; he called out to the screaming populace. &quot;Just make sure they know I&#39;m here.&quot;<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for the Boss to meet with the celestial pair. Tatsu and Shizen now approached with a platoon of kitaune soldiers at the ready. Much to the Boss’s delight, he now noticed Darren as well. The teenage Catalyst by Tatsu&#39;s side as the celestial nine tail glared at the Boss. &quot;Hey good to see you,&quot; the Boss waved. &quot;Was wondering what was keeping you? By the way, place looks gorgeous. Really love the esthetics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare enter my realm,&quot; Tatsu growled. &quot;I knew you were dangerous, I did not think you a fool.&quot; The Boss chuckled softly, shaking his head. &quot;Fool?&quot; he replied. &quot;Hardly. Just needed to get your attention. Plus, wanted the kid here. He&#39;s going to love what happens next. First things first though.&quot; Taking out the Hourglass, the Boss now cast a spell. Darren gasped, his body growing rigid. &quot;I..can&#39;t move,&quot; he grunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;Freezing spell boosted with the power of the Hourglass. I don&#39;t want you to miss what I&#39;m about to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what is it you plan on doing?&quot; Shizen asked. The Boss&#39;s eyes narrowed under his hood, Darren, Tatsu, and Shizen sensing the malicious grin. &quot;I&#39;m about to make the kitsune disappear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren watched as the Boss now mumbled a spell, the Hourglass glowing for a moment. For a few moments it appeared nothing happened. Slowly though, voices began to cry out. Darren was at first confused. It sounded like mass confusion amongst the kitsune. All he could make out was one collective sentence. My child disappeared!<br />
<br />
That collective confusion quickly turned to panic. Darren, Tatsu, and Shizen now understanding what was happening. The population of the capital gasping in shock as they collectively grew younger. Darren watched as teenage two tails grew skinnier, shorter, losing their second tails, becoming children once more. The firmer teens crying out in shock, mainly attempting to stop the process as they crept further into infancy. Soon enough though, their voices became garbled, unintelligent babble. The former teens falling onto their rears as they cried, continuing to grow younger until...nothing. Darren’s eyes growing wide as he realized the Boss was regressing the entire kitsune population into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Tatsu, seeing the danger, ordered the army to attack. They needed to stop this before every kitsune found themselves unbirthed. As the army charged forward, the Boss laughed. Erecting a barrier around himself, he now kept the kitsune army at bay, watching as they fruitlessly tried to stop him. Unable to move, Darren could only watch as the youthening kitsune population tried to stop the Boss.<br />
<br />
Spells and weapons proved useless. No matter how hard they tried, the kitsune were unable to break through. The angry war cries of the army and the populace slowly devolved into the panicked cries of children. Darren watched in horror, noting powerful seven and eight tailed kitsune growing younger, losing tails as they aged backwards. As they became teenagers two tails, Darren could see their bodies slimming, their features softening, their height decreasing with each lost year. It was pandemonium, kitsune of every age attempting to either stop the Boss or stop the process. Eventually, even the oldest of the kitsune found themselves reduced to children.<br />
<br />
Adorned in the baggy clothing of their adult lives, these kits either yelled in anger, pleaded for mercy, or cried for their parents. Darren was horror struck, watching as a population of a million within the capital dwindled away to nothing. Childish pleas turned to infantile banter, which in turn became a deafening silence. As the last kitsune vanished into non existence, Darren found himself with only Tatsu and Shizen as companions.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done?&quot; Shizen gasped, gazing at the scattered clothing that now littered the streets. &quot;I&#39;d think that would be pretty obvious,&quot; the Boss replied. &quot;I&#39;ve made every kitsune within this realm disappear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean every kitsune?&quot; Tatsu snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean every kitsune,&quot; the Boss spat. &quot;You think I would only focus on your people? Think again! Every kitsune clan that exists within this realm is now gone! Congratulations you two, you rule over a barren wasteland.&quot; Tatsu snarled, unsheathing Dragons Tongue as he now furiously beat against the Boss’s barrier. The Boss simply chuckled, his gaze now resting on Darren. &quot;It wasn&#39;t every kitsune though,&quot; the Boss continued. &quot;As you can see Tatsu and Shizen are still up and about. Plus, any kitsune in the mortal realm are fine. At least for now, but..that&#39;s about to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Darren watched as the Boss now removed his hood, a maniacal grin on his face. With a gesture, he now opened several portals, Darren, Tatsu, and Shizen watching as an army of Voids exited. As the Hourglass began to glow once more, the Boss stared at the pair of celestial kitsune. &quot;I wonder how long it takes to unmake a god,&quot; he smirked. &quot;Let&#39;s find out.&quot;</p>
