<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake could not wait to get off work. His shift had been unusually busy tonight, and he wanted to get home to enjoy his anniversary with his girlfriend, Ashley, as he knew if he played his cards right he would be getting lucky tonight. <br />
<br />
Jake was a skinny, sort of effeminate looking guy, with medium length blond hair and baby blue eyes. He was also a bit of a stoner, mostly just weed, but occasionally he would get some pills or some strong drink, nothing too dangerous he wasn&#39;t an idiot, he just enjoyed having a little extra &quot;fun.&quot; Ashley was an attractive, athletic redhead with bright green emerald eyes, pert A cup breasts, a nicely toned butt from all her training running track on the track team, and heavily muscled legs. She would occasionally partake in Jake&#39;s habits, more so to not feel alone, though as she sometimes wished he would just stop. They had met 2 years ago in class and had been madly in love ever since. <br />
<br />
It was finally time for Jake to clock out, and he wasted no time, almost dashing out the door. It had been such a stressful shift he decided to swing by his buddy, Andy&#39;s, house to get some of his usual choice in weed, but when he got there was disappointed to find out Andy had run out of his stash and was not expecting anything until tomorrow, but offered him a bottle of some new thing Jake thought he might have heard the name of on the news or something promising him a great high, but since Andy was out of the usual he got it at the friend&#39;s rate of half off. Jake, accepted thinking it only mildly odd that Andy was out of his usual, and continued home, stopping off only once more at store to get some flowers.<br />
<br />
He got home, still an hour to spare before he would expect Ashley home, he began his preparations. He prepared Ashley&#39;s favorite meal, lobster and a side of asparagus, with an appetizer of a nice fresh vegetable soup, and a custard apple pie for dessert, had the table set with the flowers and some light candle lighting, her favorite wine, and even had a list of her favorite music playing, it was terribly cheesy and cliche, but she was into that sort of thing. He was putting the finishing touches on the meal and plating things just as she walked in the door.<br />
&quot;Happy anniversary sweetie!&quot; he exclaimed as he was placing the last plate on the table as she walked in. <br />
Ashley was surprised for a second, but then remembered it was their anniversary tonight, glad she had thought ahead and got a gift earlier that week, but it had honestly slipped her mind that it was tonight. &quot;Happy anniversary, honey.&quot; she replied, &quot;Wow you really outdid yourself tonight, is that my favorite soup I smell? Oh and lobster, you really do know me well. I am so lucky to have a sweet guy like you.&quot; They sat down and had a wonderful diner, having some small talk about each other&#39;s day, and enjoying the meal and wine, lots of wine. <br />
<br />
Ashley excused herself to use the restroom, and Jake took this time to get ready for his next plan, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a small box with a beautiful ring inside, he looked at it hesitating briefly, wondering if it was the best time, or if he should have planned something bigger. He cut a big slice of the dessert he had prepared and drizzled some caramel syrup on top in a sort of decorative &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; and placed the ring on top of the slice of pie and got ready to place it in front of her when she sat back down. As she sat down he walked over placing it in front of her and getting down on one knee as she looked at the plate, it took her a second to register what it said, she gasped, turning her head quickly and seeing Jake down on a knee, smiling giddily at her and exclaimed &quot;Yes!! Oh my god yes!&quot; they then kissed passionately, breaking only a moment for her to try the ring on. <br />
<br />
The slightly intoxicated make out session got hotter and hotter until they migrated to the bedroom. Jake feeling the effects of the wine excused himself to go to the restroom before they continued their love making session. It was there Jake saw the drug he had gotten, he had intended to take that when he got home, but got so caught up in making everything perfect he just forgot about it. Figuring it couldn&#39;t hurt, he chugged it on his way out of the bathroom and went back to his new fiance to continue the lovemaking session. Ashley had meanwhile taken the moment she had to change into some very sexy lingerie she had purchased for the occasion and got under the cover to wait for Jake. As he walked in, she pulled it back and gave him her sexiest come hither look, &quot;Wow...&quot; was all he could say, he felt an odd feeling of euphoric energy as he got a raging erection. He felt more energy than he had in a while, and thought briefly how if this is what that drug did he was going to have to get more of that, but with Ashley in front of him all he could think about was how he was going to rock her world. He leaped into the bed and they made out passionately for a bit, before they started to undress for sex. He felt so much energy he began to thrust into her roughly grunting and with such ferocity that Ashley was honestly surprised where this was coming from as he rarely got this rough, but damn was she enjoying it. She screamed out in an early orgasm from the rough sex and Jake, still very much ready to go, and feeling some pride in making her cum so easily, started to wonder in his inebriated state how it felt as a woman, to be on the receiving end of such a sexual encounter. This though, brief though it was, hung in the back of his mind, almost an unconscious wondering.<br />
<br />
It was here that the drug began the secondary effects. As they continued having such mind blowing sex Ashley felt a slight odd feeling, like Jake&#39;s penis was getting harder and bigger, but in reality her vagina was slowly pushing it out and becoming more and more shallow. At the same time his 6 incher was slowly losing some length, but he did not notice due to the feeling of Ashley getting tighter. Neither noticed the slight bush around Ashley&#39;s pussy as it grew in more than her usual trimmed state and got much longer, nor as Jake&#39;s bush started to cover less area and form more a feminine pattern as he lost his treasure trail. His other body hair slowly thinned and shortened until most of it disappeared, leaving him clean shaven with only some lighter armpit tufts and a light coating on his legs and his pubic area. Meanwhile Ashley grew some small tufts of hair under her armpits and was starting to get a slight fiveoclock shadow on her face, as her leg hair also thickened and grew back in after her recent shave. her arm hair also thickened some and she started to sprout a few light hairs across her belly and in between her breasts, it was mostly unnoticeable for now, still very thin and sparse. Ashley&#39;s breasts had also started to shrink somewhat, they were down to an A cup and slowly becoming smaller as she gained some more muscle tone and they slowly were becoming firm pecks, she was also developing a six pack and her arms were also getting a bit more toned as her shoulders also grew more broad, her ass had firmed up and lost it&#39;s shape as her hips narrowed and her hair shortened some. She was starting to look more manly than Jake, genetics and her athleticism combined, all except for her lack of a penis. It was here that she orgasmed a second time, moaning in a slightly deeper tone as her adam&#39;s apple was starting to come in and her face getting more manly, Jake was still pumping away furiously, he had not had an orgasm yet and was both surprised by that fact and the one that he had given her two already, he renewed his efforts to try for a third and finally finish. He had still not yet noticed that at this point he was down to 2 inches and his balls had started to shrink some and pull into his body. His hips flared out some as well as his butt had slightly expanded into a nice ass and was still getting larger and wider. His nipples were hard as rocks and he wondered if he had chafed them some, but did not notice as they were also pushed out by slowly increasing mass of flesh behind them. His hair had lengthened some and though he normally had it a bit longer, it was down to his mid back now and much shinier and softer than usual. His effeminate look was only emphasized more by his changes and had it been a bit more bright in there, an observer would think it was 2 lesbian lovers going at it, though they would assume he was the girly one. His adam&#39;s apple was all but gone, his face thinning and taking on a girly look and his voice pitching upwards slightly as he continued to try to finish, though he was getting tired. It was here where his penis had finally shrank to a nub and started to become a clit and an opening had formed, his balls gone to become ovaries. He gave up and laid face up on the bed, tired and defeated, frustrated but giving up on his orgasm, he chalked it up to the wine, though he did give Ashley 2 so it wasn&#39;t a total loss. Ashley noticed his faltering and had a strange surge of energy herself and flipped on top of him. Ashley had by now grown a penis of about 4 inches and had just gotten her first erection though still due to the euphoric feeling of the sex and wine had not noticed. Ashley began to thrust at Jake, hoping to help him finish, not noticing the odd feeling of her starting to penetrate him as her penis grew in and his vagina formed and deepened. Now resting more Jake did not notice his continued growth of breast flesh as he was now currently well into a C cup and about to reach a D cup still growing constantly nor did he notice his ass which at this point had more than doubled what Ashley had at the start, he was not as muscled as she was, but his genes were turning him into a blonde bombshell of a woman.  His vagina finished forming into a fully functioning one and at this point he was being penetrated by his girlfriend&#39;s new 8 inch cock and finally he felt it, his orgasm was coming, though felt a little different more intense almost, he figured due to the length of time he went. Jake and Ashley both came together, her big 8 incher pumping him full from her now massive egg sized balls, they both cried out in ecstasy, neither noticing the new voices, thinking their own voice was the other&#39;s voice and then Ashley slumped, exhausted and ready for sleep almost immediately, they lay there cuddled together sleeping until morning as the last effects of the drug slowly finished as Jake got shorter and Ashley got taller, making her a muscular athletic specimen of a man, and Jake into a sleek but stacked blonde bombshell with DD cup breasts, an ass for any woman to envy and beautiful ass length blonde, wavy, silky hair.</p>
