<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elspeth suddenly appeared in front of James with her arms crossed and a stern look on her face. James didn’t like the looks of that either. She then yelled in a commanding voice. “Meghan! Come here now!”<br />
<br />
Meghan came running back still in her two-piece bikini. She had a frightened look on her face. She stopped in front of Elspeth and bowed her head. “Yes Mistress.” She said quietly.<br />
<br />
“That spell of yours was very good and well-executed, I was impressed with it.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you Mistress.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not finished! You and the other girls know that you are allowed to tease James, but sex is reserved only for the one he chooses and no one else!”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry mistress, I guess I just got….I mean…I got carried away in the moment.”<br />
<br />
Elspeth then looked angrily over at James. “And you, you should have known better, after the generosity I have shown you, you betray me like this?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know mistress, I’m sorry.”<br />
<br />
“Just because I never said anything to you, you should have realized that part of the prize of choosing one of the girls was the possibility of sex with them, but none other!”<br />
<br />
James cowered at those words. He was not liking how this was going.<br />
<br />
“So if you really want to see what your future together will hold, let’s just test that theory.”<br />
<br />
And before Meghan could say anything Elspeth waved both of her hands high in the arm and then slammed down with one forceful gesture.<br />
A loud crack could be heard as suddenly James could feel his body transforming again, the familiar feeling of getting older. Looking across at a scared Meghan, he could see that she was aging too as she quickly burst out of her bikini as her breasts grew larger and her whole body grew and filled out. Soon they were both back at 30 years of age, but it didn’t stop, if anything it was accelerating and Meghan looked frightened.<br />
<br />
Soon they were both entering their 40s and James could feel his strong adult body softening as she noticed Meghan’s rich brown hair starting to grey as lines appeared on her face and her incredible breasts began to sag ever so slightly on her body, which was starting to look worn. So they passed their 40s and entered their 50s as James saw that Meghan was now a mature older woman with salt and pepper hair and the lines on her face deepened as crow’s feet appeared around her beautiful eyes and worry lines across her forehead. Her breasts seemed to increase in size again and sag down her chest in a teardrop fashion.<br />
<br />
Soon they entered their 60s and James saw Meghan’s hair turn completely grey and the deep lines on her face turn into wrinkles as the skin on her body became blotted with age spots as she folded both of her weathered arms under her sagging breasts as if to try and prop them up.<br />
The aging accelerated again as they wizzzed through their 60s, 70s and finally stopping as they were now both 80 years old. James felt exhausted as she saw his body was no longer muscular but frail and thin, his hair and beard was now snowy white. He looked over at Meghan, she was now a very elderly 80 year old woman with white and thinning hair and shriveled body. He could see that even the hair around her shriveled vaginas was now also white. Her once long sexy legs were now shapeless twigs. Instead of a young teenage witch apprenticing in high school, she was now a very elderly witch in bad need of retirement.<br />
<br />
Elspeth surveyed her work and then smirked. “Let’s see how you now feel about each other. I’m not entirely sure if I am going to leave you both this way permanently or not. Time will tell!” and with that Elspeth stormed off.<br />
Meghan was trembling as she then uncrossed her arms, making her large shapeless breasts sag downwards on her belly. She then waved her hands and soon she was dressed in age-appropriate clothes, a large flowing dress that went to her ankles with a support bra, large panties and support hosed and flat shoes for comfort. She then waved her hands again and James found himself dressed in slacks, a button down shirt and heavy cardigan sweater. Then magically two canes appeared for each of them.<br />
Once Meghan grasped the cane and learned on it she began to cry<br />
“I’m so sorry James.” She rattled, which shocked James just how old she sounded.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t mean to harm you.”<br />
<br />
James groan as he took his cane and walked slowly over to the crying and trembling Meghan. His entire body ached and his joints hurt as the old man made his way to the crying elderly woman.<br />
<br />
“It’s ok Meghan” James said shocked that he sounded like a great-grandfather now. He then put his arm around Meghan and held her tightly.<br />
“It will be ok, I promise. And if this permanent, I hope that you will consider letting me be your husband and we can live out what is left of our lives together.”<br />
<br />
Meghan sniffled as she looked up at James as his wrinkled face, “You would….I mean…you would still have me?”<br />
<br />
“Of course I would. You don’t think I would let something like a few wrinkles make me stop caring for you, do ya? Besides, you make a sexy grandmother”<br />
<br />
Meghan smiled. “I bet you say that to all the old women you meet!&quot; she laughed, &quot;Yes, I would love to be your wife James. So how are you feeling dear?<br />
<br />
“Oh, I got some aches and pains, but I think I could still curl your toes old woman.” And with that he grabbed her dropping ass and squeezed it.<br />
Meghan tried to giggle but it sounded more like an old woman’s cackle. <br />
<br />
“Stop it ya old fool. That’s what got us into the mess to begin with.”<br />
<br />
“So let’s got sit down over there on that bench by the water.”<br />
<br />
“What was that you said dear?” as Meghan strained to hear James as her hearing was fading as all of the side-effects of their aging was starting to set in. “You need to peak up James, My hearing isn’t what it used to be”<br />
<br />
James smiled and led the old woman slowly down to the bench as Meghan shuffled using her came and then her other hand on her back for better support as her lower back began to hurt.<br />
<br />
The elderly couple finally sat down on the bench and James put his arm around her and she laid her white-haired head on is shoulder. They looked like and elderly couple who had been married for at least 60 years.<br />
Meghan looked sadly out at the water. <br />
<br />
“I used to be such a young and pretty thing when I was a girl. I could really fill out a swimsuit, couldn’t I James. You thought I was pretty didn’t you?”<br />
<br />
James squeezed her tightly. “You were an beautiful girl Meghan, such a beautiful girl”<br />
<br />
“What was that? Like 60 years ago now?”<br />
<br />
James was startles when she said that as he looked at her closely. It seemed like some senility was seeping into Meghan’s mind.<br />
<br />
“How old are you, Meghan, really?”<br />
<br />
“Stop it old man. You know I’m 80 years old today. I wonder if our great-grandchildren will come visit us here at the lake before we have to go back to the home.”<br />
<br />
“And what home is that, dear?”<br />
<br />
“You know, the retirement home. Silly old man, stop playing dumb.”<br />
<br />
James gently kissed Meghan on her forehead as he knew she was losing her grip on reality.<br />
<br />
“Its ok sweetie, I will take good care of you. You will never be alone, I promise.”<br />
<br />
Meghan turned and looked at James in the face and for a moment her mind cleared as she put one weathered and bony hand on his face lovingly. <br />
<br />
“Thank you James. I don’t regret anything we did and if this is what our life is going to be like, I think I can endure it if I am with you.” <br />
<br />
Then her eyes seemed to glaze over as she turned and looked back at the water. James gripped her tighter and remembered just how beautiful she once was.<br />
<br />
The old woman soon fell asleep in James arms and just before James was about to nod off himself, Elspeth suddenly appeared again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it seems that even in old age, you tend to do the right thing, James.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please change her back. You can keep me this way if you want, but change her back please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! She needs to learn that there are consequences. However, I was too harsh with you. You didn&#39;t know about tat rule and I can hardly blame you for being seduced. So.....&quot;<br />
<br />
And with a wave of her arm James was instantly restored to his youthful old self.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Meghan?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Elspeth motioned and two of the girls came over and helped the old woman up and placed her in a wheelchair and began to wheel her off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think a couple months in an old folks home will cure her of any future mischief. She will be young again eventually depending on how she behaves.&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked sadly at Meghan as she was wheeled off, he could hear her talking to the girls as they pushed her up the path. &quot;Such sweet young girls. I used to be a young witch too a long time ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elspeth then turned her attention back to James. &quot;I know I shouldn&#39;t do this, but I am going to let you keep your rendezvous with Melanie. She is waiting for you now.<br />
<br />
And with that she strode off. James gulped and then walked towards where Melanie was waiting. He started to get dry mouthed as he got closer to where she was waiting.</p>
