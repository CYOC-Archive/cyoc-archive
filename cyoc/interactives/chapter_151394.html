<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even with the air conditioners on, the air was still relatively warm as Tyra and Rex stepped into the terminal in Spain after a long flight. Though some of that was largely expected, given that the Mediterranean coast was not that far away and both Dinotopians could see it as their plane came in for its landing. Though, going to the seaside was not on the immediate agenda, particularly as they were to meet up with Countess Irena de Vasconcellos in order to get to where they would be staying while on their honeymoon. Supposedly her villa had had some upgrades since she became a Pyrenean Ibex, which left Tyra curious and to a degree hopeful for a good time, as the villa was also a place that her baggage carrier had wanted to see.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come along, Heather, we wouldn&#39;t want to be late,&quot; Tyra spoke, &quot;and we&#39;ll probably have customs to go through.&quot;<br />
<br />
There followed a low grumbling that Tyra could hear as she looked over her shoulder to see Heather coming out of the terminal carrying her own bags as well as Tyra and Rex&#39;s. This let the newlywed couple walk with their arms free, and Tyra was all to happy to take advantage of that to wave to people who had their eyes bulge out of their head at seeing her, even if she was fully dressed and was all part of her own &quot;revenge&quot; for Jeremy and Heather not coming to Dino City earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know these carry on bags aren&#39;t that heavy,&quot; Heather spoke, &quot;you could manage them. Especially if you&#39;re expecting me to carry the main portions of your luggage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And let you miss your workout,&quot; Tyra teased back with a smirk, &quot;no way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather managed to scowl back, as she had gotten herself in shape for the reveal for Project Mesozoic being opened to the public the previous year and for the Mesozoic Fight Club match with Regina to essentially open the league up and she did keep up with some exercises to stay in shape. In this, she didn&#39;t like the insinuation that she was presently pudgy and neither did she really like that she wouldn&#39;t at least have Jeremy with her. Jeremy was still in Dino City with his work with Horizon and the workout plans that Tyra and Rex had set him up with Mr. M for.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could have at least let Jeremy come along,&quot; Heather managed under her breath as they walked along and began going through the customs process.<br />
<br />
&quot;He still had his work, and I&#39;d think this will help,&quot; Tyra commented, &quot;Mr. M will get him in shape and you&#39;ll come back to find him totally ripped and just think of all the fun you&#39;ll have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather didn&#39;t say anything to that. There was a part of her that was interested in that, but to a certain extent a lot of her past attraction to Jeremy had not been about his physical build. Before he became a male Syntixisaurus Rex he wasn&#39;t exactly the most muscular or athletic, primarily because he spent so much of his time working on his academic work. In many ways she still loved that about him, the muscle and size he&#39;d gained as a Dinotopian was just an independent plus that didn&#39;t relate to her feelings. There was also the fact that it was likely that Tyra was just messing with her, as while Tyra would still act like a grandmother/parental type of figure, there had also been plenty of times in which she&#39;d acted more like an older sister or older friend. This was of course likely the result of her double dosing and coming back into the prime of life.<br />
<br />
The group walked along and made it through customs without any real difficulty. There were confirmation checks that they were up to date on their vaccinations to make sure that the Animalia Virus in their system was presently in the suppressed state and thus non-infectious. That wasn&#39;t too hard and it was long before they&#39;d cleared customs and collected the rest of the luggage that Tyra and Rex had packed. Heather was heavily thankful for an employee who&#39;d offered a sort of cart to carry them. It took a little bit of work, as it turned out the man knew very little English and while Heather and Rex knew a fair amount of Spanish, the Spanish they knew was closer to what was spoken in Mexico or Costa Rica, but they did manage, which allowed Heather to push the cart along until Countess Irena came into view.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Spain, land of sun and hopefully some fun for those on their honeymoon,&quot; Irena said with a small smile and then looked around to see that Jeremy was not with Heather, &quot;Did you... lose someone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Jeremy has work in Dino City,&quot; Tyra spoke, &quot;and work he couldn&#39;t get out of.&quot;<br />
<br />
While that was technically true, as Irena glanced to Heather and saw the &quot;younger&quot; Syntixisaurus female roll her eyes, Irena guessed that there was something else going on. However she wasn&#39;t going to speak on it for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though the sun would sound good,&quot; Rex commented, &quot;a place to go for some swimming after everything is settled in and recovered from a long flight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds good,&quot; Tyra smiled, &quot;and Heather might have time to see what art museums are here. It might give her some ideas and she has been getting better with her artwork.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mostly just advertisement work for Horizon,&quot; Heather spoke, though she was pleased that Tyra had referred to something she could do on her own and separate from her grandmother, &quot;copying pieces from a local gallery wouldn&#39;t do well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about that inspiration that you told me about when you were little?&quot; Tyra asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Copying someone else&#39;s work isn&#39;t inspired, its copying,&quot; Heather told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could lead you to looking for a similar scene,&quot; Irena offered, &quot;but for the moment there will be much to do to get your things to the villa.&quot;<br />
<br />
There were a few nods as they followed Irena out to a large van or a small bus that was parked near the front. The driver opened the door and Rex calmly offered a hand to Tyra to let her climb in. Countess Irena followed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spain has already adapted buses for Animalians?&quot; Rex with some surprise as he looked to see that many of the seats had an open area in the back that would allow for Animalians with thicker tails that couldn&#39;t curl to sit on them with some ease. Designs had been managed, he knew that much, but for the most part those things were largely limited to sale in Lyre and Animalia where most of the customers were.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I&#39;ve invested in it as a means of public travel for those who may decide to join Animalia in Spain,&quot; Irena answered, &quot;Much like Lord Chumlee in the UK, I am happy to share my home with those that may wish to join... should circumstances require it or they simply do not wish to be alone. And it will serve for tours and other services to help Spain&#39;s future Animalians live and work with those who do not convert... Though not something super easy with all the nonsense that&#39;s gone on with the EU of late and how relations with the US have been troubled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Rex said slowly as he sat down beside Tyra as Heather finished loading the luggage and then waved politely to the airport&#39;s employee that had helped them with the cart, &quot;but I&#39;m sure things will get better. Even some things in America have gotten better to a degree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Irena commented, &quot;though regardless of all of that... the villa is calm, relatively quiet leaving you the peace and quiet for plenty to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment... I&#39;d settle for something peaceful and quiet,&quot; Heather commented, &quot;to rest after a long flight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... jet lag does that,&quot; Irena chuckled, &quot;but I&#39;m sure everything will be fine.&quot;</p>
