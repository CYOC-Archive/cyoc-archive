<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Heavy and erratic drumbeats filled Zossie’s mind while she pumped that dildo in and out of her, feeing more and more sexually aroused by the second. Her mind started to go blank as she did this and the music began to fill it. Heavy guitar riffs, deep guttural chanting, loud singing, wailing, and solos, and the occasional weird instrument. Her playlist went through metal song after metal song as she stared blankly at the roof while pumping that purple dick in and out of her body.<br />
<br />
As she did this her arms and legs began to slim down and she got noticeably taller. Her partially brown skin paled a few tones and her brown hair darkened to a black. She continued to pump and her breasts inflated with each thrust crossing from A-cups to B-cup, and finishing at a large C-cup. Her tongue lolled out and immediately got a stud in the center of it while her eyes rolled back and gained heavy amounts of mascara. Makeup flowed into her face hiding blemishes and lines as her eyes dropped to halfway and her hair grew longer and poofier. Metal piercings appeared in her ears and ran all the way up the sides forming a multitude of silver markings that were matched by piercings on her face. An eyebrow piercing emerged followed by a nose piercing, a Monroe piercing, and a lip ring that gleamed just as silver as the rest while bright red lipstick appeared around it. A final piercing emerged in the center of her chin just below her bottom lip and her belly button gained a near identical one. <br />
<br />
Metal music continued to fill her mind while her body clock was rearranged. Now she was wired to stay up until dawn and sleep during the day on weekends. Her bedroom rearranged itself do posters of various bands changed to only feature the best death metal bands with the hottest songs whether they be popular or underground. Zossie’s wardrobe shifted to feature dark clothing, chokers, tank tops, and short shorts. She suddenly had a style of dress for the concerts she’d visit and the school. Her days in detention grew As her wardrobe became less and less “School Appropriate” and a disdain for the place began to grow in her. Most of her grades wilted away to barely scraping by and her number of days skipped increased tenfold. She gained a rebellious streak and tattoos began to spread across her body. Her left arm completely encased itself in a tattoo sleeve while various designs imprinted themselves on her chest, her stomach, her back, and her legs. <br />
<br />
She began to rhythmically move her hips while plunging the dildo into her. Her sexual experiences rewrote themselves and she became better and better with sex. Her drawers gained a few kinkier sex toys and her memories altered to fit her new person. Zossie humped back and forth while memories of trying out drugs, drinking heavily, and being an aloof groupie more than once over the last summer filled her mind. Her attitude changed to a slightly aggressive one with lots of rebellion against the system and wrongdoings by society. She despised the polite and proper curtain everyone was supposed to act under and the second she realized she didn’t have to follow society’s crippling rules she had been freed. She became happier and opener. She was all for things she hadn’t dreamed about and swear words lined her mouth along with actual true expression. She didn’t feel like she had to water herself down anymore and now she a free person.<br />
<br />
Some unknown drug filled her head and body making her feel loose and energized. Society acted like they were so bad and sure they caused addiction and issues but in sparse amounts at parties like Zossie took they were enabling, freeing, and fun. She still had enough self control to avoid becoming a stoned loser and she actually gained more self control. She knew her limits and knew when to say stop or no. She had taken a small dose of something or the other and her suspicion of it being stronger than expected had been confirmed. She didn’t even bother with what was left as the room began to flicker and she found herself in a house party just getting past the whole power outage.<br />
<br />
She continued to masturbate until the dildo vanished and was replaced by a similar sized human penis. She moaned and rocked back and forth on it until it came and started to go flacid leaving her disappointed. She picked herself up off the guy’s condom covered dick and glared at him disdainfully as he made out with another chick. The second she was off him his attention was on her and she was left watching the two with annoyance. She stooped down and picked up her push up bra and panties, sliding them back on before pulling her top and short shorts back on and slipping her long socked feet back into her boots. A choker and wrist straps attached themselves to her as she fixed her hair and exited the room to a silent hallway where a couple of guys argued about the sound system and how to get it working again.<br />
<br />
Zossie reaches into her pocket and pulled out that half sucked candy that had started her high and tossed it away deciding she was high enough. She walked down the stairs rather grumpy that she couldn’t get off on that guys dick and still feeling empty and the desire to be filled. However it was clear the party had died with the music, and anyone who had stayed was too high or drunk to be any fun.<br />
<br />
Zossie stopped near the bar and rocked her head back and forth trying to decide if she wanted to down one last drink or not. She decided not to and instead walked to the door and pulled her tight black jacket that stopped at her waist on and stepped out into the warming summer air with rain cascading around her and the remnants of a lame party slowly breaking down in her body.</p>
