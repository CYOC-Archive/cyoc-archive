<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">An explosion ripped through the brick wall of an old building. Fortunately, it was on the edge of town with no other buildings in its <br />
immediate vicinity. A shape that had been thrown out of the building by the explosion slowly stood up and brushed himself off. The ring <br />
on his hand glowed faintly and his body changed from the titanium alloy it had been to its normal fleshy state. <br />
<br />
The man was tall and bulky with a chiseled, yet handsome face. He was wearing jeans with a white shirt and black vest left open. He <br />
had a certain air about him that said &quot;don't fuck with me&quot; and the .44 magnum at his side certainly backed that up. His gruff beard and <br />
mustache gave a somewhat Clint Eastwood appearance. He stared back at the gaping hole, charred bricks, and burning upholstery <br />
inside the house and spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's going to take a lot more than that to get rid of me,&quot; he said coldly. <br />
<br />
The subject of this addressing stepped out of the hole as well. He was much older than the other man, around fifty or so. His graying <br />
beard and bald head were almost laughable if it weren't for his evil-looking face. He held a rocket launcher still smoking from its recent <br />
use. He wore casual business clothes and black sunglasses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ring wielders use their powers to hurt one another,&quot; he stated, &quot;But I find this loophole quite nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder,&quot; the younger man asked, &quot;If your assistant felt the same way?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Irrelevant. I will finish you off one way or another and he will have served his purpose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice guy,&quot; the man scoffed and slowly drew the previously concealed gun, &quot;But you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
He quickly aimed and fired before the older man saw the gun. The hole in his forehead splattered blood all over the rocket launcher as <br />
the man fell to his knees. The younger man walked over to the dead corpse and took off his ring. <br />
<br />
&quot;...Nice guys finish last.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then put on the new ring which adjusted to his finger. It also glowed and the rocket launcher turned back into the rat-like man who <br />
had been helping the wearer's deceased foe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look, mister, I'm real sorry!&quot; he stumbled, &quot;He threatened to turn me into a pooper-scooper if I didn't help him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you weren't exactly saying no to all the money you were getting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please Mr...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Judge, Brett Judge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Judge, please I'll do anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, get in the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What car?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sirens wailed as the police showed up. The police chief's car pulled up and an imposing black man stepped out. Chief Murdock had <br />
been a bar bouncer before joining the force and had kept up his physique for catching criminals. With raised weapon and handcuffs, he <br />
read the man his rights and put him in the back of the cop car.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really saved our asses here, Brett,&quot; he said when he walked back over. His voice was surprisingly gentle for the mountain of a <br />
man. But those who knew him knew that he was kind and compassionate. At least to law-abiding citizens. <br />
<br />
&quot;No problem,&quot; Brett answered, &quot;You guys have saved my ass plenty of times, 'bout time I returned the favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he had one of the rings?&quot; Murdock spoke much quieter. It wouldn't do for others to hear about this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, used it to make all of his weapons. Wish I had known that before I destroyed half of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't be helped now,&quot; the Chief sighed, &quot;The important thing is that Yates doesn't have the ring anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you might want to have some of your boys clean him off the sidewalk. He's not exactly in the nicest condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's three rings we know of: you have the Mod Ring, I have the Mental Ring, and you just got Yates's Inanimate Ring. That leaves <br />
four unaccounted for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what I gather, the other rings can't be too far away. When their previous owner died, they all teleported to new owners. But the <br />
rings seem to tend to stick together. I wouldn't suspect them to be too far outside the city, or at least the county.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Brett, if a man had that much power, why didn't he do anything with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he knew what these things were capable of. And some people are better than Yates here who let power get to his head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good thing, too, or we might be bowing down to some tyrant right now.&quot;<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Brett,&quot; a man called from the couch, &quot;Will you grab me a beer while you're in there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have two legs that aren't broken,&quot; he quipped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but the game's on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett walked back into the living room with two beers. He handed one to the guy on the couch and opened the other for himself. The <br />
man sitting on the couch was actually his younger brother, Ethan. They looked a lot alike, but Ethan kept his face clean shaved and he <br />
was much more lighthearted. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how much longer are you going to be pussy-whipped into coming here to watch the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not pussy-whipped!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She told you you couldn't watch the game on your own TV because she doesn't like baseball. You haven't even been together a whole <br />
year. She comes into the house you own and tells you what you get to watch on the TV you paid for. She doesn't do anything in return, <br />
and she has you buying all this shit for the house that you know you hate. Ergo: you're pussy-whipped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not all true,&quot; Ethan defended himself, &quot;She does do stuff for me. I'm getting laid. Now who's laughing Mr. Solo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How often?&quot; Brett asked, ignoring the insult. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; he said hesitantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Face it, you're pussy-whipped.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you're so sure you'd be in charge, why don't you have a girlfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I put my life on the line every day. If I got myself killed, you'd have to deal with a crying ex-girlfriend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because the only other person at my funeral would be Murdock. And he doesn't exactly have a pillow-soft shoulder to<br />
cry on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is true,&quot; Ethan said, giving up on the subject. &quot;So what's with the rings? I thought the first one was ugly enough, so you go out and <br />
get another. And I saw you got Murdock in on the anti-fashion. What's going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It'd be way too complicated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two sat and stared at each other for a long while before Ethan remarked, &quot;Oh yeah, busy as a bee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Drop it, Ethan, if I need to tell you I will. But you don't need to know and I don't want to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; he said, knowing he wouldn't get anywhere. &quot;Aw, I missed the end of the game!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yankees won 7-4.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I hate the Yankees. Now Jack at work will be rubbing it in my face,&quot; he complained as he stood up and got his coat. &quot;Well, I <br />
have to be at work early tomorrow, so I better get going. See ya, Brett.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye Ethan.&quot;<br />
____________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
&quot;We just got a report,&quot; Murdock said as he opened the door, &quot;Lady says the raccoon who had been in her crawl space turned into a <br />
man when it got into the woods. You thinking what I'm thinking?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Homeless guy got the Animal Ring?&quot; Brett suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably, I'm gonna go check it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll come too.&quot;</p>
