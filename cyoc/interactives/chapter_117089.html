<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt cringed at the sight he got. Going down below his belly button he saw his own genitals. Staring at his member on the screen he wondered even more how he would look like as a girl. Even better, he could make his own design right now.<br />
<br />
On the screen for editing the character, one of the first options was to choose what species you were, below that the Chronivac asked what gender it had to be. The species was set to human, and because he saw a 3D-model of himself on the screen it was obvious that the gender was set to male. Matt decided to change that. After he clicked, it took a couple of seconds for the program to load a woman-shaped mannequin. The 3D-model was actually a shape only, appearantly Matt still had to alter the settings to actually make it look like a normal woman. For now, the model had not a single hair on its skin, resulting in a completely bald head. Besides that there were no breasts either. Well at least not completely formed. Two lumps were sticking out of the lump&#39;s chest. What actually looked like it belonged to a woman was the still undetailed vagina which was generated on the model. It was all completely basic, there was a lot of work to do, if Matt wanted to make it look somewhat like a woman.<br />
<br />
First things first. Matt looked at the &quot;general&quot; settings, which set the model&#39;s virtual length, weight, and ethnicity. It also had a name, Matt Helen. Matt looked at it suspiciously, but remembered how he used the program to edit instead of to create a new model, so he quickly forgot about it afterwards. Matt set the length to 5 foot and 10 inches and set her weight on 150 lbs. He chose a slightly darker tan than the one of an average caucasian female, giving her, the 3D-model, a slightly mediterranean tint.<br />
<br />
Going back to the top, he tried to pick what hairstyle the model should have. After thinking for a while, he made the hair colour dark brown, in which you could sometimes notice a lighter tint, like light brown, or even blonde. Matt gave her curls, but not too small ones and decided to keep them together making a long ponytail, reaching past her shoulders. He made the colour of the model&#39;s eyes blue and made the noise point out slightly, thus creating a greek style nose. He created both ears with a helix shaped like half a heart. Matt also decided to keep the ears close to the model&#39;s head, so they wouldn&#39;t point out too far. The model&#39;s mouth was normal red, making it not too necessary to give it make-up, as he didn&#39;t want to spend too much time on creating the model. Zooming out to observe what he made of the face, Matt smiled. &quot;I guess that&#39;s it for the face then&quot;, he concluded.<br />
<br />
He went down a bit, to the model&#39;s midsection. The options on the side automatically changed as he moved on, the main factor now being the secundary female characteristics, also called, the breasts. Matt looked at the two disappointing lumps sticking out of the model&#39;s chest. It didn&#39;t even have nipples yet, so he decided to continue editing the model. He put the clothes layer in front of the model again, for the first time since starting he saw a woman-ish model looking back at him. The shape of the body was still the same as when he started editing the 3D-model, but now an actual face was on top of it. He wanted the chest not to stand out too much, trying to make it just a bit visible through the pajama shirt. He managed to get a similar result when the size of the breasts were about B to C-cup, somewhere in between. It mostly went to B-cup though. Matt was satisfied with this. For the areola he picked a size that seemed to fit the B-cup best.<br />
<br />
Matt loaded a randomly generated belly button on the model&#39;s belly and thought about giving her visible abs. He looked at the options, shrugged and went with it. Giving the model a slight six-pack automatically made its &quot;fitness&quot;-level increase, whatever that meant. He also saw how it affected the rest of the body, as it made the biceps and triceps on the arms a little bigger and also increased the muscle volume in its legs. Looking at the arms, he thought that a little bit of hair on it wouldn&#39;t hurt. When looking at the outcome, he threw that idea away, but still kept the setting to let the 3D-model grow hair on its body, on her head, her arms and legs and also the next part, the nether regions.<br />
<br />
Matt felt both comfortable and uncomfortable at the same time. It was arousing to see a woman&#39;s groin up close like that, but it felt strange to him that this program just left it uncensored. The model&#39;s vagina now had hair growing from everywhere, so Matt decided to change its settings, so it became a neatly shaven line from its pussy to its belly button. Going down towards the legs he made those just a little longer, giving 5 toes on each foot, appearantly those weren&#39;t generated yet. Also he managed not to forget the nails, after he looked at the fingers. Matt&#39;s new 3D-product was almost finished. Looking from all different angles, it literally looked like a girl. Matt was finally done when gave the model a nice hourglass figure and a more curvy ass, making it fit well with the boobs on its chest.<br />
<br />
Matt rolled his chair away from the computer, putting his arms behind his head and groaning, to finally stretch a bit. It took about two hours, but the finished product was marvelous. He&#39;d paid attention to every single detail and he was very satisfied by how it worked out. If this girl were to have existed in real life, he would&#39;ve fallen for her in no time! Now to save it...<br />
<br />
In the top left corner Matt noticed the icon of a floppy disk. He moved his mouse to it and clicked it. After loading for a few seconds, a notice appeared on the screen:<br />
<br />
WARNING NOTICE! Overwriting files on this program will result in the overwritten files being deleted and destroyed. Would you like to create a backup?<br />
<br />
Matt remembered that he indeed chose to edit his own 3D-model instead of making a new one. He looked at the model of himself. On one hand it was as well made and detailed as his own version. On the other hand he didn&#39;t feel comfortable looking at himself. He ran his fingers through his hair. &quot;What to do?&quot;</p>
