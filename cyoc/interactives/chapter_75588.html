<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I wanted to have a collection of…well, I wasn’t sure what the right word would be.  “Servants” wasn’t the <br />
right word.  Nor was “minions.”  Perhaps the right word was “followers.”  No matter what the right word <br />
happened to be, I knew I wanted other people in the castle.  They would all just need a reason to be there.<br />
<br />
The first thing I knew I wanted was brides.  If I was going with Dracula as an overriding inspiration, this <br />
was an essential requirement.  Considering the desires I had before I wished to be a vampire, along with the <br />
innocent answer I’d heard earlier today, the person whom I wanted to be my first bride was easy:  Colette.<br />
<br />
Colette was everything I would want in a woman.  She was the closest thing I’d ever seen to what I would <br />
consider a “dream girl.”  Now that I was a vampire, she fit that description all the better.  Her long, jet <br />
black hair was perfect for a creature of the night.  She had a tremendously curvy figure with her large <br />
breasts and shapely ass.  She also possessed a face that could make men, and perhaps women, bend to her will.  <br />
Especially when she smiled, I thought.  Her smile was warm and inviting, but I always thought there was a bit <br />
of devilish mischief behind it as well.  I’d find out soon enough.<br />
<br />
In order to speed up the process, I wished I knew exactly where Colette was right now.  As chance would have <br />
it, she was just leaving my house.  Satisfied with this knowledge, I next wished to know where she intended to <br />
go.  This revealed to me that she was just going back to her own home.  I knew what to do next.  I wished that <br />
she would be able to hear my voice, despite the great distance between us, but that she would not be able to <br />
identify it.  I also wished that I would be able to see where she was and how she would react to what I was <br />
about to do.  <br />
<br />
My vision suddenly became double.  Not in that I saw two of everything in front of me, but that in I was <br />
seeing two different things.  Out of my left eye, I saw the woods before me.  Out of my right eye I could see <br />
Colette walking towards her home.  The vision I had of her was a bird’s eye view, but also in front of her, so <br />
I was basically looking down and at her face.<br />
<br />
At this point I whispered, “Colette.”  She immediately stopped walking and looked around.  It seemed to me <br />
that she wanted to locate the source of the voice she just heard.  After a few seconds she continued on her <br />
way again.  I realized that I didn’t want her to get all the way back to her house, so I wished I knew how <br />
much longer it would take to reach her home.  She was only about five minutes walking time away.  Her home was <br />
not that close to these woods either.<br />
<br />
I decided to start walking myself.  I intended to go closer to where I entered the woods earlier, but not all <br />
the way out of them.  I wanted to lure Colette away from probable sight of anyone else.  It was weird to walk <br />
with my double vision, but I managed to make progress.  <br />
<br />
After another minute I again whispered, “Colette.”  She stopped walking again and this time looked a little <br />
nervous.  Perhaps she felt someone was stalking her, or maybe playing a cruel joke on her.  I didn’t want her <br />
scared, just intrigued.  So before she began walking again I whispered, “Colette, do not fear.”  She stood in <br />
place but still appeared troubled.  “I need you,” I whispered again.  “I need your help.”  <br />
<br />
Colette appeared to say something.  As best as I could tell, her mouth opened and appeared to say, “How?”  I <br />
had to know for sure, so I wished that I could hear her if she answered me directly.<br />
<br />
Again I whispered, “I need your help.”<br />
<br />
Through the void I heard Colette’s voice.  “How?  Where?” she said.<br />
<br />
“Come to the woods,” I whispered.  “I need you, Colette.”  Colette did not say anything but she began to walk <br />
again.  After a few minutes she stopped at what I assumed was her house.  She stood outside it for a few <br />
seconds and looked at the door.  So again I whispered, “Colette.”  This worked.  As soon as she heard my voice <br />
again, she resumed walking.  She quickened her pace and had a determined look on her face.  I smiled with the <br />
satisfaction of my plan working.  <br />
<br />
I soon reached a point in the woods that was deep enough away from civilization, but not so deep a point from <br />
where Colette might decide to turn back.  I stopped walking and looked for a place to hide.  None of the trees <br />
seemed thick enough to hide behind.  I also couldn’t be positive where Colette would appear.  So I <br />
concentrated my thoughts again and jumped into the closest tree.  I was able to somehow expertly jump higher <br />
than any human could and right onto a branch that was thick enough to support my weight.  It concealed my <br />
position perfectly.<br />
<br />
I saw that Colette was nearing the woods.  I wished that no one would pay attention to her now and that no one <br />
would see here entering the woods.  She entered the woods slowly, but surely.  It seemed that she had <br />
traversed these woods before.  She navigated her way through the thickening trees and drew nearer to me.  <br />
Again I whispered, “Colette,” so she knew she was following something still.<br />
<br />
I wished now that instead of simply hearing my voice, she could follow it to where I hid.  “Colette,” I <br />
whispered again.  I watched her turn in a different direction.  “Colette,” came my voice again.  She was <br />
definitely headed in the right direction and walked with focused determination.  <br />
<br />
I was able to hear the sound of sticks and brush being trampled underfoot.  She was coming ever close.  I <br />
wished away the special sight of her and saw normally with two eyes again.  I heard the sounds of her walking <br />
grow louder with each step.  Soon I could peer through the leaves and branches of my tree and see her <br />
approach.  I wanted to call her name again, but in such a way that she would actually pass me by.  I wished <br />
that the next time I spoke my voice would seem to come from several feet in front of her, not from where I <br />
hid.  “Colette,” I called again.<br />
<br />
To my great satisfaction she walked past my tree and in search of the place from where my voice had come.  <br />
Once she was about ten feet in front of me, I wished that I could leap out of the tree without risk of injury <br />
and that when I landed I would make no sound.  I jumped forward and landed on the ground with the grace of a <br />
gymnast.  No sound came from my action.  Colette did not turn and see me.  Anticipation built within me to a <br />
boil.  In a normal voice I said, “Colette.”</p>
