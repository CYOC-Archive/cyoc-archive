<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Number 500 and 501 happen together, 453<br />
<br />
Casper and Janet walked together to the campus, talking some more about the movie last night, and other topics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyone special in your life, Janet?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
The pink hedgehog girl blushed, and shook her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really.&quot; she said, absent-mindedly adding &quot;I don&#39;t think Casey feels that way about me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She realized what she just said and stared at Casper, her shiny pink cheeks reddening.  She hugged her books closer to her ample chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t tell her I said that.&quot; she squeaked.<br />
<br />
Casper smiled, &quot;I wont.  But if that&#39;s how you feel, you should tell her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet stared off into the distance, &quot;Maybe...&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Casper and Janet arrived in the quad of the college campus, and said their goodbyes, each going their separate ways for their classes.<br />
<br />
Casper went on to his Pre-Calculus class.<br />
Walking into class, he saw a few of his other classmates from yesterday, one of the red wolves, and two of the tigers, the gold and bronze pair.<br />
<br />
There were 20 human students in this class, and the human teacher, but Casper was going to change that.<br />
He was having a hard time concentrating on the material, but he was unsure if that was because the material was actually difficult, or if he was being distracted by the ring and its abilities.<br />
<br />
He decided to change the teacher first.<br />
<br />
He was a middle-aged man, with a short-sleeve button-up and a red and orange tie.  Casper remembered seeing that tie many times, so he figured that those were the teacher&#39;s favorite colors.<br />
A thought and the teacher became a large naked rubber anthro horse, probably a Shire, with a rubbery orange mane and tail, and interestingly ivory colored hooves.  His orange barcode prominent on his sealed behind, and impressive bulge showing off for the whole class to see.  No one batted an eyelash at his change.<br />
Casper thought to himself that he had no idea the teacher was a fan of a certain cartoon show involving ponies, but he had seen many other Synthetics assume forms from that particular piece of entertainment.<br />
<br />
One down, 20 to go.<br />
<br />
He went around the room, letting the transformees choose their forms and colors, and soon he was surrounded by 3 blue male wolves, a yellow and green giraffe woman with an impressively long neck, a male and female hyena pair, purple and yellow, 7 assorted dog breeds, male and female, in varying shades of brown to blonde, one red, and one light blue with yellow stripes running down his sides.  A sage green rubber alligator, who on closer inspection was semi-translucent, like the rubber lion on the bus this morning. Two more became a ram, tawny brown, and a ewe, ivory, joined the growing ranks of Synthetics.  The last four became various breeds of felines, a spotted snow leopardess, slivery grey and white, a ink-black panther male, a rust black and white calico male and a light blue Siamese girl, with chocolate paws, face, and tail.<br />
All of them were naked, but a few sported bags, backpacks or the vest they were wearing before the change.<br />
Their barcodes were plain on their rears that had been sealed by rubber, and their nozzles were plain on their stomachs.<br />
<br />
474.<br />
<br />
Casper looked around him, at the completely rubber class, and smiled to himself.  He could feel his excitement building. He wondered if Ashley was getting any new memories, he was sure that she was.  He made a mental note to ask her about it later.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ashley had her own troubles in her Life Drawing class, the steady influx of new memories about her schoolmates telling her that Casper was using the ring, her own excitement growing with each new memory.  She hoped he remembered that she wanted to be with him when they crossed the 500 mark.<br />
<br />
He managed to slog his way through the rest of the class, and when the teacher called time, the throng of naked rubber anthro animals got up and squeaked, shuffled and clopped out of the class room.<br />
<br />
He hefted his bookbag, slinging it over his shoulder, and Casper made his way to his next class.<br />
<br />
Biology was next, and Casper was actually looking forward to this one.<br />
<br />
The teacher was a mousey looking human woman, with glasses and a penchant for wearing paisley scarves.<br />
<br />
As Casper took his seat, the teacher began lecturing on how life as we know it is divided into 6 categories, 5 for organic life-forms, and more recently, a 6th was added for Synthetics.  Casper listened intently, but also waggled his fingers and the ring changed her into a shiny naked rubber mouse woman, nipple-less breasts rising and falling with each breath under her paisley scarf.  She stepped out from behind the head lab table at the front of the class, revealing that she was naked from the waist down as well, nothing but smooth rubber between her thighs and butt, her nozzle popping into place in her navel, as her latex skin took on a sandy brown texture, the barcode on her rump darkening to a chocolate brown.  Her nose, paws and tail remained a light pink.<br />
<br />
475.  25 to go.<br />
<br />
There were 24 other humans in this classroom, but Casper knew that would not last for long.<br />
<br />
He was barely listening to the naked latex mouse teacher, while his attention bounced around the room.<br />
<br />
A male student became a mottled blue and green African wild dog, 3 became female wolves, red, white and blue, 7 became several dog breeds, a dalmatian that was black with white spots, another doberman, husky, rottweiler, a jack russel terrier, schnauser, and a great dane.  All were naked, rubber over their human privates, and between their cheeks, in a spray of colors, sunset, auburn, gold, mercury, metalic blue, electric blue, and crimson.<br />
Another student became a squirrel, blue with light blue stripes down his back and tail, and over his front.<br />
Casper made a pair of goats, navy blue and gold, a pair of tigers, one rainbowed with black stripes, the other black with rainbow stripes, a pair of gazelle, green/blue, their spiralling rubber horns rising proudly into the air. A pig boy followed, rubber skin black as night, and a platypus, saffron collored, which surprised Casper.  Lastly, a pair of bulls, chocolate brown and russet, their dark horns spreading wide.<br />
<br />
This brought the number to 499.  One more, only one more was needed, Casper thought.  He resisted the urge to change the first human he saw, remembering Ashley.<br />
<br />
Biology class ended, and Casper decided to ditch the rest of his classes that day to find Ashley.<br />
<br />
Turns out, she had decided the same, so they ran into one another outside the cafeteria.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems that you&#39;ve been busy,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup,&quot; Casper nodded, &quot;one left, so I decided to find you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, who to change for number 500?&quot; he mused aloud.<br />
<br />
Ashley slapped her forehead, &quot;Oh, Becky!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;How awful, we should have turned her earlier!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Casper asked, as the ring fed him new memories, &quot;Oh, Becky, your best friend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; Ashley said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, lets do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley pulled out her cell phone and dialled Becky up.  They made small talk and agreed to meet at a local fast food joint.<br />
<br />
Casper and Ashley walked up to the fast food place, noting that it was decently populated by both humans and Synthetics.  Becky was waiting for them, a somewhat plain girl, wearing bellbottom jeans, a band t-shirt, and a flannel overshirt,  Her long straight hair framing her face.<br />
<br />
Ashley squeaked up to her and they greeted each other, hugging each other tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Becky,&quot; Casper said, waving.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heya Casper, headbutt anyone lately?&quot; Becky teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, no, not recently.&quot; Casper chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m hungry, lets eat!&quot; Becky said.<br />
<br />
The trio went through the line of the fast food place, Becky got a burger and fries, and Casper and Ashley got some plastic chips, and a sandwich of various plastics, rubbers and cellophane. A soda for Becky and more of that liquid polymer for the two Synthetics.<br />
<br />
They took their food and sat down.  They talked about classes, art projects Ashley and Becky were working on, pretty benign stuff.<br />
<br />
Ashley reached under the table and gave Casper a squeeze on his thigh, signalling that he should use the ring.<br />
<br />
Casper took the hint and used the ring.  Becky&#39;s clothes vanished, and her skin became glistening, darkening to a midnight blue, fading to violet, then red, orange and finally yellow at her feet.  Small spots of white appeared on her skin, like stars in the night sky.  Her feet reshaped into paws, her hands into clawed dainty things, and a thin tail sprouted and grew from her backside.  Her nipples vanished, and smooth rubber covered her crotch and rear, sealing her like the rest of the Synthetics.  Her face lengthened into a feline muzzle, plastic whiskers pushing from her cheeks as her ears expanded into triangular things, migrating to the top of her head. Her nozzle appeared, and her barcode was emblazoned on her rump in red orange and yellow.  Her food changed to match Casper and Ashley&#39;s.  Across from them Becky had become a naked rubber Sphinx cat, colored like the night sky just after sunset.  Her thin belly had a small pudge, that one would call cute.<br />
<br />
502.<br />
<br />
Casper&#39;s eyes went wide.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Ashley whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just used the ring on Becky, but the ring is telling me that 3 new Synthetics have been made.&quot;<br />
<br />
The ring spoke to Casper then, informing him that Becky, her mate, and her unborn had been converted.</p>
