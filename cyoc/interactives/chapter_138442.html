<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;A Spinosaurus?&quot; Nellie finished as she watched Lizzie stumble with the last word as she relayed her story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lizzie nodded with a small chuckle, &quot;and while Dimetrodon may not be a dinosaur... it does share some things with Spinosaurus, namely that sail...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Dimetrodon Grandis?&quot; Lizzie asked to Doctor Stein, mostly to confirm that they had the right animal.<br />
<br />
She might not have known the most about every animal, but she was fairly well aware that there often many prehistoric animals that had the same genus name but a different species name. Running into Sophie and Roland had been a surprise during the Storm from Nowhere, but a pleasant one, as it did present the opportunity to get into the program through Project Phoenix and with a project that would technically be fairly different from Project Mesozoic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein nodded, &quot;Dimetrodon Grandis the animal that looks like a dinosaur but wasn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizzie nodded, as she&#39;d always been interested in the creature, particularly after seeing a skeleton of it in a natural history museum. She grew up thinking it was a dinosaur as it had the huge sail on its back and was identified as a reptile, but by the time she got to college, she was astonished to learn that the creature, while not a direct ancestor of mammals, was actually far more closely related to mammals than to dinosaurs, and mostly due to the adaptations in its skull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, do you have everything?&quot; Lizzie asked, almost impatiently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Doctor Stein gave a slow nod, &quot;It was actually a bit easier with regard to getting the needed bone samples to make sure we have the DNA needed for a successful conversion, possibly because of the success we&#39;ve had with Project Mesozoic that many are starting to have some interest in these projects...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Likely for soft tissue studies, I&#39;d think,&quot; Lizzie commented with a small smile, &quot;since all we have right now are bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded and slowly began to lead Lizzie from his office and to the hallways that would lead to one of the transformation rooms. Everything had been arranged so that things were ready and that Lizzie&#39;s transformation could be handled as quickly as possible. The two quietly made their way through the halls with Lizzie occasionally glancing toward the other people making their way through the hallways as well and they continued on their way and covering the various key points of business that had to be done, particularly in the relation to Lizzie&#39;s age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... before we get into the actual transformation, you must be aware that given your age, and the fact that many older women going through the conversion process have had this happen, there is the very real possibility that you could develop Regressive Hypersexuality and will NEED to sign up for appropriate counseling to handle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lizzie slowly nodded as she followed after him, and noted his firm and no nonsense look. This was something that she knew was possible given all the press that had gone on with it. There were times when she wished her party would stop trying to fight tooth and nail on cultural issues and focus on working economic policies. And the present battles in Congress seemed to reflect that. They finally got a anti-Regressive Hypersexuality Bill passed and signed, but it fell far short of the legislating Animalia and Horizon out of existence that had been hoped for, and a part of the bill even undercut itself with its conflicting ideas on sexuality.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine with that,&quot; Lizzie said slowly as they walked along.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have it... Regressive Hypersexuality, I mean?&quot; Nellie asked, to which Lizzie looked down slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Lizzie said slowly, &quot;and to an extent... I can SEE know why people want to end regressing the elderly&#39;s age through the Animalia Virus... and in all honesty... I can see some of the reasons for their reasoning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d support their efforts to ban the conversion of the elderly, if they want it?!&quot; Nellie gasped in shock and surprise, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t that mean you&#39;d oppose your own conversion now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not so much &quot;oppose&quot; as it is that we need something improve the nature of the conversion for the elderly,&quot; Lizzie said slowly, &quot;Particularly when so many seem to be developing Regressive Hypersexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But so far there hasn&#39;t been any major problem,&quot; Nellie countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one with Regressive Hypersexuality has raped someone after the sexual high, true,&quot; Lizzie answered, &quot;but with so many continuing cases... it can&#39;t be a minor issue. There are too many instances of that. It&#39;s not that I&#39;d favor outlawing it... but I&#39;d think that Horizon needs to change its emphasis to try and prevent new cases from developing. Because all some would need is one mistake during a sexual high... and we&#39;d all be in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take too long for Doctor Stein to lead them the conversion room where there was a nurse waiting with a small rolling tray. She looked to Lizzie for a moment and then to the doctor as he began to open the door. Lizzie watched as the nurse lifted up a plastic container and opened it revealing the syringes that would be used.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is ready, sir,&quot; the nurse spoke as she handed the syringes to Doctor Stein.<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein nodded and lead Lizzie into the room. It wasn&#39;t too large with a bed and a mirror, which given the news that had been reported on Animalia and Horizon had become rather well known. Lizzie was simply glad for the chance to get her youth back at the moment. She stood by calmly while Doctor Stein then readied the syringes and readied her arm for the injections. They didn&#39;t hurt, and Doctor Stein gave what had become the standard welcome that was given with new conversions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to Animalia,&quot; Doctor Stein said to Lizzie and then made his way out.<br />
<br />
Lizzie looked back as she saw the door open and shut, and was quick to begin removing her clothing once it shut. She could feel her body growing warm and that her transformation was beginning, and knowing that Dimetrodon was known for its tall sail that she likely wouldn&#39;t be able to wear anything that she was presently wearing. As she slipped out of her blouse and her pants, she could see her muscles regaining muscle tone that she&#39;d lost a long time ago. Her hands felt stronger as short and stubby reptilian claws began to grow from her finger tips.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels good,&quot; Lizzie smiled as her muscle tone returned and got better, while she could start to see some emerald green and yellow scales appear on her body.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t see it, but her skin tightened up with wrinkles and age lines faded away. As Lizzie wrestled to get her bra off, she ran her tongue over her teeth, and the were already growing sharper and more pointed. But they weren&#39;t uniform in size. Some teeth were quickly growing larger while others only grew a little. As they did so, Lizzie looked forward to see an emerald green scaled muzzle begin to push out in front of her, with her hair falling out as it did so. As it lengthened, it took on a shape and look that sort of resembled some the theropod Dinotopians that had already converted, but lacking the horns or other truly saurian trains. And under her skin, Lizzie&#39;s skull muzzle remained largely solid bone with the exception of the nasal openings at the front of her growing muzzle, the openings for her eyes, and the synapsid opening behind the eye.<br />
<br />
With this, Lizzie made her way forward to look into the mirror. She could see her muzzle finishing its growth with her larger front teeth and smaller rear teeth.  She gave a small smile as she also noted how firm her muscles were and how they were even growing a bit in size. Her breasts were firming up into at present modest round mounds on her chest, with a yellowish underside and her nipples becoming more scaled and were also beginning to grow erect while she felt some pressure on her back and at the base of her spine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here it comes,&quot; Lizzie said aloud with a great deal of eagerness in her voice, and as a hand pulling on her panties, trying to get them off. At the same time she could feel her hips beginning to widen and it was beginning to make her wet.<br />
<br />
As she pulled off her panties with one hand she brought up her other hand to her breasts, which were now also beginning to swell larger and feel heavy with milk. It drove her on and even made her happy as her panties fell to the floor. One hand slipped down to massage at her vaginal opening, which opened wider and Lizzie soon carefully slipped two fingers in and gave a very heavy moan as her tail began to grow out behind her. After a few moments her tail was long enough that she found she could sway it from side to side and even in the midst of self induced pleasure as her fingers slowly and steadily rubbed at her inner walls she did see it swaying. It felt good and Lizzie simply kept at it, feeling the driving need to reach the pinnacle pleasure that she didn&#39;t even notice her growing sail. As it reached its full height behind her, Lizzie felt her vaginal walls gush with cum as they clamped around her fingers as she then trembled and gave her breast a soft squeeze and gushing milk from her scaled nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;That felt good,&quot; Lizzie smiled and then turned to a side as saw her grown sail. It was largely the same emerald green color as the rest of her, but the individual spines and the edges of the sail were actually orange. It gave her a small smile as she felt she looked good, but at the same time, she felt unsatisfied. It was like she needed more, and then she picked up a male scent and remembered Doctor Stein. &quot;And I know where to get more.&quot;<br />
<br />
She made her way forward, filled with lust and desire, and opened the door with no shame, startling Doctor Stein who was waiting for her, with Sora and Yuki having just arrived. Lizzie paid them no notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elizabeth...?&quot; Doctor Stein stepped back slowly, noting the milk leaking from one breast and the Dimetrodon Animalian&#39;s intense gaze focused on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me Lizzie,&quot; Lizzie answered in a seductive voice, &quot;It&#39;s more fun... and that&#39;s what I&#39;d like...&quot;<br />
<br />
Doctor Stein stepped back again and said, &quot;I am happily married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She can join us!&quot; Lizzie spoke as Sora and Yuki both leaped into action.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;The two Velociraptor Dinotopians managed to hold me down until I came down from the sexual high that I&#39;d been on in the transformation,&quot; Lizzie then finished, &quot;I apologized to Doctor Stein, but it was still something that had to be reported that I have an extreme case of Regressive Hypersexuality. THAT is why I&#39;d think that it may be a good idea that the Animalia Virus be corrected so that older people don&#39;t get the rapid surge of hormones that leads to so many developing Regressive Hypersexuality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet you&#39;re working at the Meat Market?&quot; Nellie asked as she looked to Lizzie.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not saying that having an active sexuality is a bad thing,&quot; Lizzie answered, &quot;it&#39;s actually quite healthy. The problem is that with Regressive Hypersexuality...  there is a great deal more control that is needed than is normal. For... if Yuki and Sora hadn&#39;t been there, I might have made a real mistake with Doctor Stein...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t argue, I suppose,&quot; Nellie commented slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end... some of the work at the Meat Market has worked out quite well in helping me gain more control over myself,&quot; Lizzie answered, &quot;Tyra seems to be quite helpful with that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From everything I&#39;ve heard, she doesn&#39;t have it though,&quot; Nellie commented.<br />
<br />
Lizzie shrugged, &quot;Maybe... but you can see her over there with Rex, Heather, Jeremy, Sophie, Roland, and their parents... you can tell that she very much likes her own freedom and her knew start... and the bond mate that came with it. In all of this... I think she&#39;s gained some understanding on all these things to help those of us that DO have Regressive Hypersexuality... even if it&#39;s to keep us out of trouble between visits with Doctor Jones clinic.</p>
