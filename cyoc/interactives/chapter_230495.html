<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason had an old gift card in his wallet with a few dollars left, and put it down on the table and aimed his phone at it. Jason read through the text of the app and saw the mention of the card. Jason changed &quot;gift&quot; to &quot;credit&quot;. The card did not change, except the word &quot;gift&quot; was no longer present on the card. Jason pointed the phone at the card again, looking for some text about his credit limit or balance. He found the balance due, and changed the amount from zero dollars to negative $100,000 and submitted the change. Then Jason used the credit card to pay for the in-app upgrade to the full version. It took a few minutes, but eventually Jason was presented with the upgrade successful message in the app.<br />
<br />
Jason pointed the phone to the baby store and a pregnant woman&#39;s information showed on the app. Jason read through the text, and thought he would change, &quot;birthing date&quot; to &quot;egg laying date&quot;. The text change a bit after Jason applied the change. The woman was now carrying a single egg and would be laying her egg in a week. Jason changed it so she was carrying three eggs, then altered the egg laying date to today. The woman&#39;s features and clothing changed. The baby store was now advertising their excellent egg care. The woman went inside the store, greeted by the egg handlers. <br />
<br />
Jason clicked on the Baby Store on the app, and read through the text. Jason saw where humans now laid eggs, and proper egg care was needed as the hard shells weakened when exposed to air so the baby could break out when ready, which was usually 8 weeks after being laid. Jason changed the word &quot;hard&quot; to &quot;latex&quot; and applied the change. The updated text now read the baby would break out 16 weeks after the latex egg doubled in size after and the shell thickness was paper thin. Jason noticed for the first time he was now wearing a latex bodysuit, with everyone else now wearing something latex. Jason clicked on the map for the GAP store, and read through the text. Jason found clothing is now recycled mammalian egg shells as it is as durable as leather, easier to work with, and does not irritate even the most sensitive skin.<br />
<br />
Jason saw the shoe store was now a boot store, selling both leather and latex. An older fat guy was at a table eating, when Jason clicked on his table using the app map. Jason skimmed through the text of the table, the guy, and his food. Jason changed his weight from &quot;318&quot; to &quot;119&quot;, and Jason watched as he hit apply the guy instantly shrink, unaware of any change as he kept eating.<br />
<br />
The mall was not very busy, and Will saw Jason sitting at the food court table once he was clear of the theater entrance. Will&#39;s choice of leather boots and a cow patterned leotard with a black leather jacket didn&#39;t seem abnormal for Jason as Will sat down at the table.<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;Was the movie good?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will smiled, &quot;Yea, great chance to jack off the whole time, and I&#39;m still hard.&quot; Will reached out and squeezed Jason&#39;s arm, smiling.<br />
<br />
Jason asked, &quot;Why me? Why not that girl that wants to breed with you? Lee, Leah, Laiah...whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will patted Jason&#39;s arm, &quot;Think about it, for me?&quot; Will got up from his seat before turning back to Jason, &quot;I didn&#39;t eat yet, want anything, it&#39;s on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason shook his head no, &quot;I&#39;m good, besides, I&#39;m not sure I want to go home with you later for just that reason.&quot; Jason grinned at will.<br />
<br />
Will nodded, &quot;Yea, I told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason pointed the phone up to Will as he walked away, and started going though the app&#39;s description of Will. Jason changed, &quot;Male&quot; to &quot;Shemale&quot; and applied the change. From behind, he could see Will&#39;s legs spread apart and his boots were now only ankle high. Jason left Will&#39;s lactating breasts as DD, and didn&#39;t make any further changes. Will came back with a foot-long hotdog, and did his best job of making Jason want him now. Jason was about to ask if he had no shame and what if his parents were here, but realized better and let Will do his thing. Jason was actually enjoying Will&#39;s very feminine face and hands savor the hot dog. Will finished the hot dog and disappeared into the men&#39;s room. Jason read some more of Will&#39;s profile and read where Will was processing his lunch into milk, and in a couple of hours would require milking. Will was Jason&#39;s designated fuck buddy, agreed to by both sets of parents to reduce teen pregnancy and unwanted eggs. Both of them came from working class families, and were paranoid about getting a girl pregnant before they could finish college and get a good job due to the insane sex drive by males and shemales to fuck any pussy possible.<br />
<br />
Will came back and led Jason around the mall for a while, holding hands together, before going back to the dorm. Will was very dominant sexually, and Jason did not stop or resist the oversexed shemale. Jason was going to need to examine a few things, as it seems sweat was now a lubricant and Will was at home impaled in Jason&#39;s muscular ass. Jason was also just has happy deep inside Will&#39;s pillow-y shemale ass. Jason was working on draining each of Will&#39;s breasts as they lay on the latex sheets of their queen size bed as Will was running his hand through Jason&#39;s hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t answer now,&quot; Will started, &quot;but are you mad at me? That was good, but you don&#39;t let me go wild like I did today normally.&quot; Jason started to answer when Will mashed Jason&#39;s face into his breast, &quot;Eat first. Then talk.&quot; Jason nodded and continued to nurse. Will continued, &quot;...and if your not mad at me, I want to fuck your lights out after you empty your favorite milk jugs. I know you don&#39;t have my stamina, but I don&#39;t mind filling your ass full every time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason managed a thumbs up to Will, who was giddy with excitement. Jason could feel Will&#39;s cock throb and grow.</p>
