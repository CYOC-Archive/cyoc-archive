<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I think it’s time we moved to a more…comfortable location,” Tetsuo says, looking down at you with a smirk. “Follow me, pet.” The kitsune brushes past you and walks out the door, his tails gently swaying behind him. Your body seems to act on its own, as you get up and follow behind the kitsune. He leads you to the entrance room of the manor and opens a pair of wooden doors that are adjacent to the front doors you entered from. You try to make a break for the front door and get the hell out of here, but your body doesn’t respond. Against your will, you follow the fox deity into the room he just went into. <br />
<br />
On the other side of the doors is a rather simple yet elegant living room. Much like in the bedroom you were just in, the floors are made of tatami and the walls are a calming beige color with dark wood accents. On the left and right sides of the room, you can see a set of sliding paper doors that lead to other areas of the house. A low tea table sat in the middle of the room, complete with an ornate teapot, teacups, and two pillows for sitting. You assume this was where the kitsune was leading you, but you are proven wrong when he walks over to the sliding doors on the right side of the room and opens them. He turns to you and makes a beckoning motion with one of his fingers before slipping into the room. Just like before, your body moves completely on its own, following behind the kitsune. <br />
<br />
The room that you entered was a massive library. Rows upon rows of tall bookshelves filled the room, with each one being completely full of books. On the far side of the room, you can see a fireplace in the wall with a cozy looking fire already lit. In front of the fireplace was an armchair, in which Tetsuo sat with his paws up on a footrest. In his hand was an ancient looking book with symbols you didn’t recognize. You walk closer to the deity against your will, stopping just a few feet away from him. The kitsune gently sets the book down on the end table next to his chair before turning his attention to you.<br />
<br />
“Here we are, my pet: my personal study,” he says, throwing his arms out in a dramatic gesture. “This is where you will learn how to harness the infinite knowledge of the universe. But first, you must embrace my gift and know your place as my pet. Drop to your knees.”<br />
<br />
Without warning, your body does exactly as the deity told you to, putting your face inches away from the fox’s paws. You look up to the deity to ask him what to do next. <br />
<br />
“Lick them.”<br />
<br />
“Wh-what?!”<br />
<br />
“You heard me, pet,” the deity says. “Lick my paws. You may soon be a kitsune like myself, but until you have earned all nine of your tails, we are not equals. You are beneath me, and you are to serve your master’s needs. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
You nod your head and bring yourself closer to the god’s paws. You try your hardest to pull away and keep your mouth shut, but your eyes widen in horror as your mouth opens against your will and your tongue comes out. As soon as your tongue touches the pads of the deity’s paws, a sweaty taste bombards your tongue, making you want to retch in disgust. You unwillingly run your tongue slowly and thoroughly along the deity’s pads, working against your will.<br />
<br />
Tetsuo lets out a relaxed sigh. “Oh, it’s been so long since a mortal has worshiped me like this,” the deity says. “I only had eight tails at the time, so I was unable to give them the gift of being a kitsune. It’s such a shame that you humans have such short lifespans...” The kitsune pauses, seeming to reflect on his former lover. “But that won’t be a problem anymore, pet. Just focus on pleasing your master for now.”<br />
<br />
You continue to lick Tetsuo’s paws, moving to suck on each digit. As the deity grunts in approval, you begin to feel rather proud of yourself. Against your better judgement, you begin to lose yourself in your work, cleaning the god’s paw as thoroughly as possible. When you finished with the first one, you moved to the second one without hesitation, moaning slightly as the now-appealing taste hit your tongue. <br />
<br />
You are so engrossed in your work that you don’t notice Tetsuo picking up the book he had been reading and beginning to read from it, speaking in a foreign tongue. As he held the book in his right hand, the deity’s left hand began to glow in an eerie pale bluish-green light. It isn’t until he lets out a slight grunt of pain that you look up and realize what is happening. The kitsune continues to speak in the unfamiliar language, wincing in pain every now and again as the light in his hand grows brighter and brighter. The light becomes so blindingly bright that you are forced to close your eyes and look away. When the light finally dims, you uncover your eyes and look up at the fox deity in front of you. <br />
<br />
Tetsuo is breathing heavily, clearly exhausted from whatever it was he had just done. Levitating about an inch above the palm of his left hand was a small, bluish-green flame that flickers softly every now and then. At the center of the flame is what appears to be a transparent orb. You have no idea what the ethereal-looking object is, yet you find yourself rather entranced by it. <br />
<br />
“I…apologize for interrupting you, pet,” the deity says, sounding rather exhausted. “That spell…it took much more of my energy than I thought it would…but that does not matter. What matters…is that it worked…” He closes the book once again and sets it back down on the end table.<br />
<br />
“What is that…?” You ask cautiously, unable to take your eyes off of the fiery orb in the kitsune’s paw-like hand. Tetsuo smirks and pets your head with his free hand. <br />
<br />
“You’re a curious one,” he remarks. “That will serve you well as a kitsune. To answer your question, pet, this is the pure, untainted essence of a kitsune. Every kitsune possesses this essence, but only the most powerful ones are able to create it out of nothing. I suppose the closest thing to this essence that you humans have is your souls, if that makes it any easier for you to understand.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes widen as you realize how powerful the deity before you truly is. If he can create what is basically a kitsune’s soul out of nothing and only appear slightly tired after, then what exactly is the extent of his power? You aren’t given much time to think about it, as Tetsuo suddenly shoots forward and pushes the essence into your chest, making you fall back onto your ass. Immediately you begin to check for the essence, but it’s nowhere to be seen. <br />
<br />
“Wh-Where did it go?” you ask.<br />
<br />
The kitsune chuckles as he gets up from his chair, standing over you. He kneels down to your eye level and places his right hand on your heart, closing his eyes as he does so. Almost immediately, a feeling of warmth washes over your body, which causes you to let out a slight moan. You aren’t sure what’s happening, but it feels quite good…<br />
<br />
After a second or two, the fox deity withdraws his hand from your chest. “There…your soul and the essence have merged and become one,” he says. “There is one more thing we must do to complete the ritual, however.” Tetsuo stands up and extends his paw-like hand to you. You hesitate for a second before cautiously taking the deity’s hand. Immediately as you do, the room begins to shift and spin around you, only for it to stop a few seconds later. You feel a bit dizzy from watching all the spinning, but when the dizziness fades, you realize that the room looks completely different. <br />
<br />
Instead of a library, you are now in a lavish bedroom. Paper screens with images of foxes and kitsune decorated some areas of the room, and a low sitting bed was centered against the back wall of the room. The left wall of the room has a small alcove in the center where a scroll depicting a gold and silver fox hangs. On either side of the alcove is a series of cabinets and shelves that are built into the wall. The shelves have various trinkets on them, such as a bonsai tree on the left one and a pair of porcelain vases on the right one. <br />
<br />
“How…how did we get here?” you ask. “We were just in…” The kitsune cuts you off with a chuckle. <br />
<br />
“Teleportation, my pet,” he answers, stroking your head. “We are now in the master bedroom, where the most sacred and intimate part of the ritual will begin. He gently runs a hand across your chest, teasing your newly sensitive skin. “In order to truly become a kitsune, you must receive the seed of a kitsune to act as the catalyst for your transformation.”<br />
<br />
Your eyes widen in horror as you realize what Tetsuo is implying. You frantically try to tell your legs to start running so you can get the hell out of here, but it was no use. You couldn’t control your body at all. There was nothing you could do as the fox deity wraps his arms around you and pulls you into a deep, passionate kiss. Unlike before, however, you find yourself opening your mouth wider so the fox can push more of his tongue in. The familiar taste of his saliva fills your mouth much stronger than before. You can feel your mind beginning to fog up, slowly pushing all of your worries, fears, and inhibitions to a tiny spot in the back of your mind where they would never be heard from again. <br />
<br />
When the kiss breaks, the fox gently caresses your back. The feeling of his smooth, leathery paw pads against your bare skin makes you let out a moan. You try your hardest to ignore the feeling and not get aroused, but you find that your attempts are in vain when the deity reaches down and tightly grips your stiff cock. He begins to rub the head of your cock with his thumb, moving it in a circular motion in order to tease your sensitive member. Every circle he completes makes your body weaker and weaker to his touch. <br />
<br />
“Does that feel good, pet?” Tetsuo asks, his sultry, melodic voice lingering in your ears. “Because I can make you feel <b>much</b> better.” The kitsune lets go of your throbbing member before saying “On your knees.” Without any hesitation, you drop to your knees and come face to face with the deity’s large, canine member once again. A voice in your head is begging, no, <i>pleading</i>, for you to resist the fox, but it’s being drowned out by numerous thoughts telling you to take the cock in your mouth and submit to the kitsune completely. You know you have to fight these urges, but…<br />
<br />
“Go on pet. Suck it.”<br />
<br />
<i>You can’t fight them.</i><br />
<br />
Upon hearing your master’s order, you take his cock in your mouth and eagerly begin to suck. Tetsuo grins triumphantly, knowing that he’s successfully broken your resistance. He groans in satisfaction as you run your tongue along his shaft, running his clawed fingers through your hair. <br />
<br />
“My my, for someone who claimed they weren’t gay, you seem to really enjoy sucking my cock,” the deity chuckles. “Did you perhaps have a change of heart?” <br />
<br />
You nod slightly as you bob your head up and down the fox deity’s large length, finding the taste to be even more appealing than it was just a few minutes prior. Tetsuo inhales sharply, and you feel a little of his precum leak out. The salty taste makes your eyes widen, and you find yourself beginning to lick the tip of the canine’s cock to coerce more into coming out. <br />
<br />
“F-Fuck…I’m close pet…s-swallow every last drop!” The fox cries out in pleasure, and your mouth is suddenly flooded with the deity’s cum. His seed tastes fresh, as if it was the essence of the forest itself. Obeying your master’s orders, you swallow every last drop of his cum, not letting a single drop go to waste. You should be disgusted, and yet you find yourself wanting more. <br />
<br />
You take Tetsuo’s cock out of your mouth, and the fox deity places a hand under your chin. He lifts your chin and looks you in the eyes. “Did you swallow?” he asks. You nod, and the deity grins before patting you on the head. “Such a good boy,” he says. “And do you know what good boys get?”<br />
<br />
“What do they get, my lord?” you ask. <br />
<br />
“Why don’t you go to the bed and find out for yourself?”<br />
<br />
You eagerly move to the large bed in the room, climbing onto it. A second later, Tetsuo joins you on the bed. He places his hands on your shoulders and pushes you onto your back. He moves a hand down towards your ass, and you hear a tearing noise. Seconds later, the kitsune holds up your boxers, which he had torn off of you. You had honestly forgotten that you were still wearing them.<br />
<br />
“Raise your legs,” the deity commands. You eagerly do so. The fox grabs your ankles and pushes them away, making your body curl as your ass is brought closer to his face. Then, you feel the fox’s tongue rub over your asshole, causing you to moan in pleasure. You squirm in pleasure as Tetsuo rims your virgin asshole, preparing you for what is to come. As he does this, your body begins to feel ridiculously warm, so much so that you begin to pant. <br />
<br />
When Tetsuo finishes rimming your ass, he looks at your face and smirks. “I see that the transformation is beginning,” he says. “Well, we better not delay any longer.” He places your legs on his shoulders, and you feel his throbbing vulpine cock begin to prod your asshole. Then, without warning, he pushes in. <br />
<br />
For a brief moment, there’s pain as your asshole is stretched wider than it ever has been before. You clench your eyes shut and whimper in pain as the deity pushes the head of his cock inside you, not stopping for a second. By the time three inches of the fox’s clock is in you, however, the pain has largely faded, giving way to an immense pleasure. You moan as Tetsuo pushes more of his thick cock into your ass, unsure of how this could feel any better. Then, the thrusts begin. <br />
<br />
You let out a loud moan as the kitsune gently thrusts his length in and out of your hole, taking great care of you every step of the way. He brushes a hand along your cheek, and you instinctively nuzzle it. <br />
<br />
“That’s a good pet,” Tetsuo says in a soft, sultry voice. “Now, brace yourself for what comes next…”<br />
<br />
Before you can ask the deity what he means, he thrusts his cock hard against a certain spot in your ass. You let out a cry of pleasure as the fox begins to increase the speed and power of his thrusts, making sure to hit that sweet spot over and over again. <br />
<br />
As Tetsuo thrusts, you can feel your feet starting to change. Your toes fuse into four digits as your foot elongates slightly, taking on a more canine appearance. Black, leathery paw pads grow in under each of your new digits, and you can feel the sensation of what you can only assume to be fur growing in. As the sensation moves away from your feet and up your legs, you can see that it is indeed the feeling of fur growing in. Your legs begin to change into a more digitigrade structure as gold fur spreads up towards your upper body. <br />
<br />
“Yes…your changes have started,” the kitsune remarks as he thrusts his length into you. “It won’t be long now, pet…”<br />
<br />
As the fur spreads up your chest, you suddenly feel an immense pleasure in your cock, which causes you to let out a loud cry. You lift your head and watch as flesh begins to spread around your cock, covering it completely as gold fur grows in. Seconds later, your cock begins to emerge from your new sheath, and you watch in awe as the head becomes pointed and the entire organ takes on a red tint. Just at the base, your new knot grows in. You reach up and give your newly changed cock a stroke, shuddering in pleasure at how sensitive it is. A slight pressure at the base of your spine makes you lift your ass slightly, whimpering in pleasure as you feel your new tail grow in. This is immediately followed by a strange shock through your new appendage, which makes you squirm slightly. When the feeling fades, you are suddenly aware that you gained another tail. <br />
<br />
The fur spreads to your arms, and your hands begin to shift into a strange fusion of paws and hands, with pads growing in on your palms and the tips of your fingers. Your nails lengthen slightly and become claws, perfect for running through your soft fur. <br />
<br />
Your changes finally reach their climax as the fur begins to spread up your neck. Your master’s thrusts have grown much harder and faster, each one making your body shake with pleasure. “It’s almost over, pet,” Tetsuo grunts as he thrust into you. “Let your spirit bind you to the forest, and submit yourself fully to me!” Despite the overwhelming pleasure you’ve been feeling, the voice telling you to resist has remained the entire time. Deep down, you know that you should listen to it…but you don’t want to. <br />
<br />
“I…I give myself to you, master!” you cry out. “I submit to you for all eternity!” The fur seems to spread faster than it did before once you shouted that out. Your hair changes into fur and takes on the same shade as the rest of it. You begin panting as your mouth and nose push out into a slender, vulpine muzzle, complete with a wet black nose and sharp teeth. As your ears turn triangular and move to the top of your head, Tetsuo grabs your hips and rams his length into you, causing you to let out a loud moan as his knot is shoved inside of you. Seconds later, you feel your insides being flooded with his hot, canine seed, and your release follows right behind. You moan loudly as you shoot your first load of canine cum all over yourself and your master. <br />
<br />
After what feels like an eternity, both of your orgasms die down, and the two of you are panting in unison. Tetsuo leans close and licks your muzzle affectionately. “You look gorgeous, my pet,” he says to you. “Gold fur suits you well.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you master,” you reply, licking his muzzle back. <br />
<br />
“Your training will begin tomorrow morning,” he says. “But for now, let us sleep and enjoy this time together.” You nod in agreement, nuzzling your master as he rests his head on your shoulder.</p>
