<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The realistic one present, Gillie pointed out, &quot;We should keep that a cure for the game is <br />
underway under wraps until the cure is already ready. If we don't, everyone will try to get <br />
in one final grudge match or try to figure out the most outlandish and self use of the game <br />
they can. Or worse, they chose to try to murder Father Mike and Father Paul to prevent the <br />
game from ending.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The Mayor blinked those big brown eyes of his. Gillie internally shivered at the feelings her <br />
body was telling her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought after what Kurse did, no one would be mad enough to use the game anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity slowly shook her head, &quot;I'm afraid not… I had Penny restore two couples of <br />
Leomans who were turned into love dolls just yesterday…&quot; <br />
<br />
The Mayor gasped in shock. &quot;I don't believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's true.&quot; Madam Serenity said simply.<br />
<br />
The Mayor looked at Gillie who just nodded automatically, Gillie knowing very much how <br />
greedy people could get and how they'd justify just about anything to themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see… tell me the moment that you have enough of the cure so we can minimize the <br />
risk… I'm stilling going ahead with any of the all preparations however. The radio <br />
declaration can wait until the near the end.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two women nodded at this. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Madam Serenity looked at Gillie when they left the Mayor's office, and had walked past the <br />
smiling naked bald lion women acting as security. <br />
<br />
&quot;I noticed you picked up the new jargon and the 'revised' version of events rather quickly.&quot; <br />
She commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been through more twists and warped to reality than you,&quot; Said Gillie simply, as they <br />
walked around in public Gillie naked but not a single person so much as glancing at her <br />
more than any other person… except the lion people who kept smiling at her and some <br />
waving… and at each other. &quot;I've had to adapt to quick and bizarre changes in existence <br />
before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can appreciate that Gill.&quot; Madam Serenity said simply.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you can. So how is that Trevor kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't remember ever being a cat, or human, or a teenager, just a little boy I took under <br />
my wing when he was in danger of his life for a good long year… Back with his family and <br />
happy as a clam for it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gillie looked around the wolves, humans, and lion people, and noted how there were more <br />
of the latter then there had been yesterday, she could smell them too. 'The building are <br />
slowly becoming all different too… no way the doors to the post office where that tall <br />
yesterday… and … THAT WAS A VEGAN restaurant yesterday! Prime Rib a third off on <br />
Fridays?!' <br />
<br />
Gillie knew she was in some warped version of invasion of the body snatchers, and short of <br />
a meteorite hit, or a carpet bombing, nothing was going to stop it. That sense of finality <br />
and inevitability hit the police chief hard. It made Gillie feel ill. <br />
<br />

<br />
Mr. P of course did not have the street address of every Pride member memorized, nor did <br />
he know the finer details of what Gillian II and Mother Glen had done with themselves after <br />
leaving the estate. <br />
<br />
Some people gasped, but most simply smiled and nodded when a giant gold and black <br />
wolf came into the retirement center run by Mother Glen. He was a personal friend of hers <br />
after all. <br />
<br />
The nurse (still human against all odd) greeted the giant wolf and asked kindly what his <br />
business was with them today: -Right after- waving off a happy family of leoman who had <br />
just visited their grandparents. The two elderly leomans were now having a card game with <br />
their friends who of course didn't notice as their wrinkly skin because wrinkly fur and the <br />
old women no longer having to worry about their hair. Though keeping track of their tails <br />
did become trouble in their elder years. And the chairs and beds needed to be bigger and <br />
more reinforced for the elderly leomans as the cascade found it's way into the retirement <br />
home. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm here to see Snow White, I mean Mother Glen.&quot; <br />
<br />
The Nurse nodded and said, &quot;Mother Glen isn't in right now. She told us yesterday that she <br />
was moving into a new home with her long lost Prime Mate, the movers began taking her <br />
belongings to her new house this morning in earnest. <br />
<br />
Mr. P finally took note of the humans taking the items out one of the secondary doors to a <br />
truck parked along side the building. 'Oblivious old man.' He thought to himself.  &quot;I see… <br />
do you have her new home address?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; The Nurse said telling him where Mother Glen's new home was. <br />
<br />
As Mr. P left, the nurse's brother, who never got tired of listening to the stories of one of <br />
their residents who had been a mountaineer, who was a card player with the elderly couple <br />
whose family had just visited, whose child went to the same school as Trevor.  He had <br />
taken this job originally just to pay off his loans, but now he had been enraptured by his <br />
unique tales. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey sis.&quot; Said a young leoman with white fur and red markings on his shoulders and back <br />
that resembled a cross. An ID card hung around his neck. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bro'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I---&quot; Before he was going to say he was going to go home early without any back up or <br />
warning… but… that wasn't the civilized thing to do was it? <br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else you need for me to do?&quot; <br />
<br />
The nurse's super curly brown hair ceased to exist, and brown fur with the same red marks <br />
as her brother appeared over her skin as her clothes vanished, her ID card appearing on a <br />
string around her neck. She grew larger and stronger and her desk changing shape to <br />
match as her round ears moved to the top of her head and the tail emerge and hands and <br />
feet became more like paws. Her maternal material shrank a bit, but Leoman had never <br />
been known for the sometimes oversized busts that some Felmans and Leomans had. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's some bed sheet laundry that needs doing in the laundry room.&quot; She replied in a <br />
deeper more growly voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; He simply nodded and smiled and went to his appointed task. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
Gillian and Mother Glen were in the semi-furbished house drinking tea (well, Gillian <br />
drinking tea, Mother Glen was licking it up from her large tea cup since her experiments <br />
with trying to hold cubs had been mostly disasters), when there was a crude knock at the <br />
front door. <br />
<br />
When Gillian opened, he was surprised to see the giant black wolf from before at the <br />
Manor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Mr. P said smiling, &quot;Name's Patrick. Remember me? Snow White in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here Blackie.&quot; Mother Glen answered and the two nuzzled each other. <br />
<br />
Gillian was a tiny bit more confused than vexed. Lupeman from what he remembered didn't <br />
snow this kind of affection or emotion to outsiders ie non-lupmans… 'Guess some things <br />
have changed for the better.' <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; She asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;My grandson wanted to check on the Pack who wasn't at the estate at Kurse turned the <br />
entire planet for a short while into mutant lunatic freaks and back again… I realized had a <br />
perfect excuse to visit you Snow White.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need an excuse to visit your best friend Blackie?&quot; She said to the Lupman who she had <br />
not even really know all that well in the old timeline. But due to their long live spans and <br />
their similar conditions and both spending more time in Glendale in this timeline, they <br />
were the best of friends. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;When Joella said 'acting as though they were not under a spell' she didn't say WHICH <br />
SPELL. Her command would require them to ignore death's Geass as well… which as I said <br />
before, could NOT be broken! This created a paradox in their minds of obeying their <br />
mistress' command, and obeying the irresistible Geass from death. Thus why their minds <br />
shut down.&quot; Marie-Eliza explained. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had hoped they had just fainted due to what they saw had happened to their bodies.&quot; <br />
Maddex said depressed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Remember what I said before. Joella never realized her parents had been the cause of the <br />
wandering demons, or that they had committed murdered repeatedly, that their ideal world <br />
with their insanity wouldn't have worked, and basically spent her life believing her mothers <br />
had been -good- and this is what -inspired- her to become the local saint she's <br />
remembered for now. And died believing the witches had died doing what was right… But <br />
that is all just recap.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
1689 August<br />
<br />
&quot;My mothers succeeded at making me happy, and the Witch Pride happy, and the fairies <br />
happy. And all my brothers and sisters happy. AND they made Free very much happy!&quot; <br />
Joella corrected him sternly. <br />
<br />
Vatican nodded at once at his mistress. <br />
<br />
Mal'Akh glared at Joella but also ran to check on the two hunters… they were out like a <br />
light. <br />
<br />
&quot;Joella are you okay?… Can… is that what I was feeling… &quot; <br />
<br />
Both turns and miniature gargoyle turned around to see a naked girl with a long brown <br />
pony tail looking at him looking scared, sick, confused, and hurting. <br />
<br />
&quot;LARK!&quot; Joella ran to her and hugged her, like she would any of her brothers and sisters. <br />
Who at that moment were also waking up. <br />
<br />
Free meanwhile awoke where she had been deposited just next to Running Bear's run down <br />
house (who was doing to take care of his corpse?). If a gargoyle could <br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Officer Linus Sure and Father Draco Fire struggled in their minds, both a rag doll being <br />
pulled between two adult sized children was what the feeling could be best described as. <br />
<br />
Their mistress had ordered them to live their lives as if they were not enhanced, and they <br />
struggled to obey, but that meant going up against Death's Geass… at which they had no <br />
chance, no force on Earth, even the witches' curse could change that. <br />
<br />
So their mistresses command futilely tried to pull them away from the grip of Death's <br />
command. The two men in pain as their minds threatened to tear in two as the two utterly <br />
uncompromising, and unrelenting orders that could not be ignored. <br />
<br />
None of this was visible on the outside, and no one in reality saw the two brave and strong <br />
willed men's psyche finally break under the strain and collapse in on themselves… And <br />
slowly begin to rebuild itself, the Dare and Deaths' Geass, being magically enforced and the <br />
cause of the conflict being the only parts that were not torn to pieces, and became the <br />
basis of their psyches… <br />
<br />
The compromise that was finally reached, was for serving and protecting the young child <br />
to be what the two WANTED to do with themselves. Along with guiding, helping, and <br />
protecting the many children left without parents by the witches, and to aid the pride of <br />
leomans, and the family of humans who had been left with nowhere to go. <br />
<br />
The human and the uber naga remained unconscious as their minds slowly rebuilt <br />
themselves with these two basic tenants as the basis for their selves. 'Guide, protect, and <br />
aid those the witches had created to find their own lives, and serve and protect the young <br />
heir to the witches holdings as part of that task.' <br />
<br />
So the soldier and priest were unified in one idea. <br />
<br />
'I must serve Young Lady Joella.' <br />
<br />
For Father Draco Fire, the desire to show Joella the way of the Lord became prominant, <br />
that was his base definition of helping someone after all, and who was more important to <br />
show and convert to the Lord's Word than Young Lady Joella? <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
All around Glendale the puritans awoke from their fogged state of mind and from their <br />
deep sleep… they wondered what they were doing all lined up in rows. They all screamed <br />
in alarm and panic when they saw they were all naked in front of each other, and most <br />
were quickly losing the youth the witches had given them.  The fact many of the savages <br />
from the praying town were there too naked under blankets only made them scream and <br />
panic even MORE! <br />
<br />
At the same time at Witch Manor, the Witch Pride, Ben's family, and the child familiars also <br />
also awoke… and through the connection with the witches that had struck them down <br />
when Marie broke their magic… they also knew the fate of their mistresses… and began to <br />
cry and hug each other in misery. <br />
<br />
Sister Kathrine's ears flickered, &quot;Marie… can you hear it?&quot; <br />
<br />
Sister Marie started and turned to Kathrine, &quot;Hear what?&quot; Marie Cruz shuddered, &quot;The <br />
screams of panic and alarm or the cries of misery?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Both.&quot; Sister Kathrine admitted. <br />
<br />
Sister Marie Cruz sighed. <br />
<br />
Of course Winifred just ignore all the NOISE as she took the witches' corpses for her own. <br />
With no one there loyal to the witches to protest, and Sister Marie Cruz having more <br />
pressing matters on her minds, did not. THe silver Wolf, programmed by the young <br />
witchlings years before to obey and serve the young pups without question and basically <br />
had the same identity and persona as her sister save for a name … which was rather fitting <br />
since the two of them had actually been original one flustered Omega, not that they, or <br />
anyone else was even remotely aware of this fact of the old reality.  <br />
<br />
 The two by the witches spell that had given birth to them made them the ideal Omegas to <br />
the Alpha's mind. Unquestioningly obedient, unquestioningly loyal, and to take care of and <br />
look after the pups needs and wants was their reason for living. In their own way, though <br />
they would not say it out loud, were almost sorry to see the fantasy come to an end, but <br />
they knew the teenage bright colored lupman weren't trained or able at carrying for the <br />
young, and had to put practicality first. <br />
<br />
Her twin, Maryweather, greeted her at the door, and the two hugged, Winifred still carrying <br />
the corpses the witches like they were prizes. <br />
<br />
&quot;That is them sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are dead sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most assuredly and sincerely dead sister. The wicked witches are dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shall we eat them sister?&quot; Maryweather said completely serious <br />
<br />
&quot;No sister.&quot; Winifred replied not freaked out by the suggestion in the least, &quot;They placed a <br />
curse on the outsider who rid us of them.&quot; Winifred said with no clue that she owed her <br />
very existence to the three whose dead bodies she was carrying. &quot;We should burn them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
The witches corpses were dumped quickly outside unceremoniously a few seconds later as <br />
the pack members began to awaken and most reverting back to their true age. Those who <br />
did not were those whose persona had changed too drastically to revert to the identity they <br />
had as adults.  The omegas would burn the witches bodies later when the meaningful and <br />
important tasks were done. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;So the witches bodies… would be burned as an afterthought.&quot; Marie-Eliza said. <br />
<br />
&quot;They deserved it and worse. No matter how sad their brainwashed puppets were.&quot; <br />
Maddex's heads said simply. <br />
<br />
No one objected to his point of view. <br />
<br />

<br />
Tokyo Japan <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to wear the Battle Maid's costume Ai?&quot; Lamented Aiko, smoothing over the <br />
rough points in her tail from putting it through the multi layers cosplay dress. <br />
<br />
A black haired human girl in the room dressed in a somewhat similar outside but with fake <br />
ears and tail looked at the japanese felman who had bright pink fur (which Aiko had dyed <br />
several times as Black, Brown, And Blond).  &quot;You lost bet Aiko so no backing out now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know I know.&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door and Ai opened it to reveal a large Japanese Leoman dressed <br />
like Edward from the anime Full Metal Alchemist, a bit of a joke on his part since the <br />
character was infamous for being short. HE was a wearing a blond wig over his black <br />
mane. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aito!&quot;  The human girl smiled and nodded at him and gave him a quick hug. <br />
<br />
Aito had secretly saved bits of his fur so he wouldn't overheat from his costume but it was <br />
a good sacrifice for his friends. <br />
<br />
Ai's costume became bigger along with her, her dyed hair replaced by a wig on her bald <br />
head. Her tail became very much real along with her ears even if she had a bow on the end <br />
to hide the tuff and a bit of costume glue to give her ears the illusion of being pointed. <br />
And her fur was died blue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aiko you coming?&quot; Ai asked happily. <br />
<br />
Aiko had long grown used to being so small, to Japanese humans at least she wasn't THAT <br />
small, but to Leomans she was still a midgit…  She remembered meeting her friend Ai and <br />
later her boyfriend Aito on an internet forum… and then realized they already knew each <br />
other in reality going to the same school.  What made her friendship with Ai particular was <br />
that Ai had never mistaken her for a runt leomanness.<br />
<br />
Aiko between the two towering leoman headed for the cosplay convention.</p>
