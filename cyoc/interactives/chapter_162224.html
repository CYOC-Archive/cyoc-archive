<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen&#39;s day had gone relatively well, and things had been calm, which was something greatly needed, given some of the other things that had gone on in Moon Lake since the proposed &quot;reveal plan&quot; was voted on and the development of the plan was approved. She could understand being fearful, and having been away from Moon Lake while Jeff was alive and serving his country had presented her with enough of a view of the country as a whole that she could see the reasons that could be there to worry about. There were places in the country that pushed an interpretation of Christianity that could be quite fanatical and clearly opposed to things like homosexuality or even being bi. That reinforced the idea that there were people who wouldn&#39;t be ready for the revelation that weres were real and more than just movie monsters. She and Jeff had been very firm and careful with regard to Tad when he was young to make sure he didn&#39;t accidently let something slip and after he had his first transformation to make sure he didn&#39;t transform and get caught on camera.<br />
<br />
Those that were against the reveal in Moon Lake, Jen figured fit well within those fears, and to a certain extent they hadn&#39;t left her, either. But in following Jeff from deployment to deployment in the US, Jen had also been able to see the sides of the country where things were not necessarily as bad as might be feared. That things were not always as they seemed, and that was something that many of those who lived in Moon Lake could probably stand to learn, for the world had changed since the middle ages, and while there could be people that would fear them, there would also be people that would support them, possibly in equal measure. And those that would likely support wears wouldn&#39;t just be limited to hippies, people with &quot;furry fetish,&quot; or some other odd quirk in humanity. She&#39;d met the wives of other officers who were as fiercely conservative as their husbands were, but could and did respect minorities. As such it wasn&#39;t as though everyone would be out to get weres when the big reveal happened.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, Jen had generally come to feel it best to go through with developing the plan and make it good. Show weres in the best possible light and let the reveal happen. While it might mean some time of strife and struggle on certain levels, it wouldn&#39;t necessarily as bad as some might fear it to be. At the same time with all the jumps in technology, weres might be facing a situation where if the were secret were to be kept a secret... it would mean that weres could NEVER transform into their were-form and could definitely never be outside in their were-form, not even at night. In this, the consequences of sticking to keeping the secret at all costs could end up being worse that the legal court battles to secure civil rights for weres, and as such, Jen did come to support it. It might let them actually be free of the fears that weres lived with.<br />
<br />
But Jen wasn&#39;t in any real position to argue that point, as she&#39;d been picking up her life since Jeff&#39;s murder and her return to Moon Lake with her son. She&#39;d joined a new pride on her return and was pleased to see that Tad fit in well at Moon Lake and hade made friends, and began searching for a job. She&#39;d had a fair number of local applications out, and two interviews, but it was the second of them that had born the most promise. That had been as a personal secretary to Akane no Tachibana, the CEO of the company that held her family name. The interview had gone well enough that she had gotten word of a callback for a second interview, scheduled for Thursday. Jen had been practicing for what would likely come up in the second interview when the other piece of joy that Jen had found in Moon Lake returned home, Claire.<br />
<br />
The two had met at the Halloween Dance at the high school and had since learned about each other. Claire had been a straight human woman, who&#39;d gotten a job as a custodian with the college. Most of it had been because she liked some of the &quot;repair&quot; challenges that they would face, should something break and immediate repairs had to be made. The most surprising thing was that Claire, while perfectly straight, loved cats and at learning about werecats seemed to be eager at it. But since werecats were all at least bisexual, if not homosexual, many had apparently turned Claire away for not wanting to change more than just her species, but Claire had seemed determined on that issue. With Claire&#39;s recognition that becoming a werecat would change her sexuality, Jen agreed to allow for it... and from there, Jen soon found herself in a loving relationship with Claire and in a way it felt good.<br />
<br />
There were some times when Jen wondered or worried that she might be moving to fast with Claire, that she was somehow cheating on Jeff. But at the same time, Claire had also voiced her opinion at not wanting to replace Jeff&#39;s place in her heart, just have a place adjacent to it, and Tad seemed to approve of Claire. That made things better and made her happy at having Claire. Thus when Claire came home in a mood to play, Jen was more than happy to play as well. It lead to both of them coming together and steadily undressing the other and leaving their clothing on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;These,&quot; Jen said to Claire as she held up the bra that Claire had been wearing, &quot;need to be bigger... for these...&quot; Jen then paused to run one hand along the swell Claire&#39;s bosom, feeling it gently rise and fall with each breath Claire took and soon feeling the nipple harden against the palm of her hand... &quot;ARE bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... you like?&quot; Claire answered as she leaned forward to slip her thumbs along Jen&#39;s hips so that they slid underneath her fiancée&#39;s panties and began to pull them down. She did her best to make sure that Jen was able to get a look down to see the two round mounds that were Claire&#39;s breasts, which had swelled up to an E cup when she became a werecat. She eventually looked up with a smile as she felt a familiar happy warmth as she began to transform, knowing what would come quite soon. Claire looked up to Jen beginning to change as well, her eyes turning green and her pupil rising into a vertical slit and as black fur began grow out of Jen&#39;s skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Jen answered as she felt the familiar rush of her transformation, her long black furred tail growing out behind her and marveling as the werecat in Claire also came forward. Claws forming at Claire&#39;s fingertips and her feet lengthening to accommodate a more digitigrade stance when standing. &quot;But there are certain things that just can&#39;t contain your beauty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Flatterer,&quot; Claire replied playfully as she felt her tail grow out a bit behind her, though with her were-form based on the Japanese Bobtail, it wasn&#39;t very long. And her calico coloring design for her fur, mostly white with some black and honey-blond splotches gave her another difference from Jen&#39;s solid black Persian fursona, but Claire liked the comparison. She&#39;d also grown emotionally attached to Jen in that Jen had been willing to transform her. It made her a lesbian, as the interest in men just wasn&#39;t there anymore, but she didn&#39;t care and would love Jen forever for being willing to turn her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I try,&quot; Jen told her with a smile, &quot;If I can win the job with Tachibana Enterprises... we&#39;ll do a bit of shopping. Get you some things that will fit you better. I could use some things too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love that,&quot; Claire answered as Jen climbed up onto the bed. She raised her furred hands to Jen&#39;s cheeks to pull her into a passionate kiss, or at least as passionate as they could manage with their muzzles while transformed. Jen&#39;s Persian fursona included the rather &quot;flattened&quot; face that the breed was known for, but Claire had the full feline muzzle that pushed out in front of her face, and with both werecats having the sharpened canines, some elements of kissing were a bit harder and it soon turned into a sort of sensual grooming. Each gently licked at the other and soon at the other&#39;s sensual areas. &quot;But right now... I think that both of us would like something else...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Jen moaned out in agreement as the pair came close and had their legs wrapped around the other which soon had each of their vaginas pressed together, while Claire resumed her attention to grooming at Jen&#39;s neck and chest. Claire didn&#39;t bite or pull at Jen&#39;s fur, but Jen could still feel the rough barbs on Claire&#39;s feline tongue and she could tell that Claire&#39;s attention was aimed at driving Jen&#39;s arousal up. She eventually settled on to licking and nibbling at Jen&#39;s breasts, including some suckling on Jen&#39;s engorged nipples. It was something that got her going, and Jen gladly returned the favor in reaching down to Claire&#39;s hips, to hold them together and even gently stroked at the underside of Claire&#39;s short bobbed tail.<br />
<br />
That encouraged a mewing moan in return as the two werecat&#39;s enjoyed their late afternoon together and were able to enjoy the other&#39;s company and for the moment, ignore many of the stresses that went on outside the Decker home that neither Jen nor Claire could control. Though as the pair massaged each other&#39;s breasts, vaginas, and other sensitive areas, they also failed to hear Tad&#39;s return with Amy as the only thing that Jen and Claire focused on for the moment was to bring the other to a well deserved orgasm...</p>
