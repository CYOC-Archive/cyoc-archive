<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Then an obvious thought pops into your head, &quot;I'm not a slave or animal to do this man's biddings, maybe I won't go!&quot; You begin to unpack the suitcase hanging everything back nice and neat as before.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was going through your mind, you don't have to tow the line for this kook Thule! No, your free to choose, and a citizen of these United States, your own man and proud of it!&quot; so you reason as the bags is placed back in the closet and set into the corner once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Wells family had to, or so they thought as to save their child from an early death. Yet they and if the cruel Doctor might be right Hank is on his way into oblivion anyway. Foolish be Andria to sign him off to the Doc. Still more foolish was to sign over everything they owned to his foundation only to live on as poor dumb beasts.&quot; you reason the situation out and cosign yourself to staying put!<br />
<br />
Soon enough the plane tickets are tossed into the waste basket and you try to put Tim's pleading phone call out of your thoughts. As one can become busy about the house it is easy to set aside what was to be for what you want to be, maybe just like Tim and Andria Wells.<br />
<br />
Ding dong dong ding, goes the front doorbell just as your dinner was coming out the oven.<br />
<br />
To the door and great an unexpected guest, maybe one of the kids are in town and like normal they just drop around. You open the door and stand with a look of surprise and wonderment. There looking back at you are to Pinkerton security policemen dressed as if ready to kill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes gentlemen, what is it you need here?&quot; one askes of such men in a very polite manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are here on the order of Thule Research Foundation with a warrant to detain you!&quot; says one of the men as both look sturn of face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Omwa, me!&quot; you say looking puzzeled but having heard the name Thule you have an idea what's a foot.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had an appointment for a plane trip to the Foundation's main office, you didn't show up for the plane! Being you are home and with the smell of cooking inside I can only think you have decided to ignor the Foundation's request.&quot; says the Officer again as his partner just stands there with a cold stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;My plans have changed, they will just have to accept that till we can talk again later!&quot; you say trying to bully your way.<br />
<br />
The other officer reach behind him showing a folded paper. &quot;We are prepared to arrest you if need be, this is a Federal warrant for your arrest!&quot; announced the till then silent Officer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on now this is some stupid joke!&quot; you said as the other Officer, the first one to speak pulls out one of those horrid Taser guns and points it at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need....................................&quot; you begin to agree wanting not to be blasted by the stun weapon pointed at you.<br />
<br />
Z-A-P is what you remember later when waking up aboard a plane and strapped to a first class seat. The head aches and solid memories of a terrible pain like nothing ever did one feel before. The plane is airborn and you are one of 200 plus passengers bound for who knows where?<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake at last I thought after those two goons hauled you into the plane plopping you here by me I'd have some very interesting conversation.&quot; says this young man his face bright as if ready for an adventure.<br />
<br />
You offer a hand to shake and moan the still rugged electric shock pains boucing about your chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Louis J. Jeffery is my name, at least right now it is!&quot; he says making you suddenly wonder what nut case your seated beside.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm....&quot; you begin to say as the young man smiles and holds up the Federal warrant showing your name in bold print. &quot;Yup, that's me!&quot; you smile as to his cute way of breaking the ice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going out to visit our mutual friend, Doctor Ultima Thule I see here!&quot; he says as if its only a social call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but I'm going there on....on...an application for employment!&quot; you state. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, hahahaha, ha, ha, ha, you are going there on a oneway flight the same as me brother! I don't know why you got arrested but if one visits the Doc you almost never leave on two legs, oh or unless you swim like a fish, or slither as a snake! Well do tell, I'm going there as a willing volunteer! Yup a volunteer ready to lose what little I own and be for this great scientist a real part of his ongoing work. He has me contracted to become his first ever French Angora Buck Salbe Rabbit. Think of it aa old strain of the Rabbit species coming alive and I'm choosen to make it happen!&quot; announced the young man as your thoughts of this guy ending up as a six foot tall Harvey is sounding plum crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what!&quot; you say in a sullen way.<br />
<br />
&quot;No idea at all!&quot; comes the quick reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it all began at our local zoo when some nieghbors, their son Hank and I went to the grand opening of this new exhibit. He, Hank fell into the Hippo pool and before security could recue him from the hungry Hippos he was slipped aboard a friendly Hippo male. It was after he came out that the security man thanked the Hippo calling him by the name of Jim. I noted a bronze placard by the pool side stated that a guy named James had made a personal contribution to the exhibit. I suspected he was somehow that Hippo. Now you as proud as can be announce your willing to become a cute bunny for the Doc!&quot; says you as your new found friend listens and listens well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe he's done this quite a number of times, even had a group once that wanted to know what it was as becoming a herd. I, myself don't have any reason to hold back, I'm willing to go through with this, its ok.&quot; he says as now you listen.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Hippo was the first but when I by accident dropped my camera into the African exhibit's scene there came an old friend. Odd it is that so many are found and taken, then placed as whatever and not a soul doubts or considers, then who would think such is really possible?&quot; you grumble as the thought of again ending up as anything from a bird to a snake makes shivers go down your spine.<br />
<br />
The flight is long, about two hours and this allows time for you to walk and look about. People, children, college students, faces showing happy thoughts, places to go, people to see, and plans for a bright future.<br />
<br />
A heads up look toward your seat has that young man smiling at you his face all aglow with wonderous expectation of being a buck Rabbit. The Pilot announces the plane is soon to land at Missoula and all should strap into their seat. You look at the emergency escape window a passing thought of killing yourself. The thought passes as it would be terrible to doom all these other here as they have wonderful lives ahead and will maybe help do something special for mankind. <br />
<br />
The plane lands and again two huge hormone taking type security Officers stand ready to escort you to the Thule Foundation. A simple good bye to the young man wondering if you paths will ever cross again?<br />
<br />
Into a waiting Limo and your off as if a special guest of the Thule Foundation and not a prisoner soon to executed physically.</p>
