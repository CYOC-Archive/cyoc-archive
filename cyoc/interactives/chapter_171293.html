<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While everybody was looking at Michael&#39;s growth, Nathan, a 15 years old guy with brown curly hair and blue eyes, approached to mr. Turin and talked to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, mr. Turin... I already know that becoming an adult is inevitable but... I was wondering if... Can you make grow to my uncle&#39;s age?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting request.&quot; Mr. Turin said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you want to become like your father? Are you ashamed of him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Nathan shrugged. &quot;My dad is almost on his fifties. Fat, bold and pretty hairy. I have seen him almost naked when we&#39;re on the beach and I really don&#39;t want to get that body. On the other hand, his brother is on his forties but he&#39;s quite built and good looking. He&#39;s also a furball but not as disgusting as dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm... I&#39;m not sure about this.&quot; Mr. Turin replied. &quot;The kind of man you&#39;ll be depends only on you. Look at Shane and Justin for example. They&#39;re brothers and now are like twins but they look completely different.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take the risk.&quot; Nathan said as he closed his eyes. Mr. Turin pointed the DILFnator to him and shot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!! Everybody!! Nathan is growing up!!&quot; Shane shouted and all the newly grown men turned their attention to the soon to be member of his awkward group.<br />
<br />
Nathan had already started to feel very hot and dizzy. “Oh man, this feels so weird.”<br />
<br />
&quot;And it will be even more weirder.&quot; Counselor Frank said as he scratched his red chest hair.<br />
<br />
Nathan was feeling his clothes getting tighter and tighter. “Oh man! I forgot to take my clothes off!” He said before his shirt buttons suddenly began to pop open.<br />
<br />
“Ugh!! Hey! Watch out!!” Rick yelled when a button hit his forehead but Nathan didn&#39;t listen to him because he was ripping open his shirt to find that his body had grown thicker with muscle, immediately he moved his hand down his abs.<br />
<br />
“Whoa! Cool!” Nathan smiled as he ignored a sensation going throughout his body. His legs started to stretch longer causing his pants to barely cover the tops of his ankles now. “I’m really getting big and strong like my uncle!”<br />
<br />
He looked down at his arms noticing that dark hairs began to sprout. He scratched his face as hair began to grow there too. His body continue to stretch and expand resembling a young man in his mid twenties now. He felt his pants getting tighter and tighter.<br />
<br />
“Shit!” His deep voice boomed as he felt a lot of pain coming from his shoes. “Ahhh! My feet! They&#39;re getting too big!” He looked down and noticed that his growing feet were trying to burst from within his increasingly smaller size 8 shoes. Just then Nathan’s toes bursted through the top revealing very big, large and hairy toes. “Whoa! Are those really my toes?!!” Suddenly the rest of his feet caught up revealing large size 15 feet. Nathan rubbed his sore feet from the pain admiring how long his soles were now. However the rest of his body wasn’t done growing.<br />
<br />
The sensation moved right into Nathan’s arms causing them to blow up with muscle. “Oooh man! That&#39;s what I been looking for!!” Nathan grinned as he flexed his biceps which caused the sleeves of his shirt to completely rip open. His torso expanded to match his now large biceps.<br />
<br />
“Um, Nathan… You&#39;re growing hair on your shoulders, and your back... and your... um... Butt” Carlos said as he watched dark hair sprouting all over Nathan&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
However, Nathan was already distracted by a sensation moving down into his tight underwear. He clenched the front of his underwear tightly. “Ugh!” Nathan squeezed his balls as they began to rapidly expand. His eyes rolled back as his dick began to double in size.<br />
<br />
Nathan’s legs began to expand causing his pants to rip completely open revealing a throbbing hard cock trying to rip through what was left of his underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh! I knew this would happen but I thought I would have more self control!! Aahh!!&quot; Nathan couldn’t take it anymore and he ripped open his tight underwear allowing his balls to hang low and his dick to continue growing larger. “Uuuuuuuh!! He moaned in his newly found pleasure as he stroked his thickening cock.<br />
<br />
Nathan now resembled a man his 40’s. His face was no longer that of an innocent boy’s but instead a grown man’s. He kept stroking harder and harder as he felt an intense pressure building up inside of him.<br />
<br />
“Ugh!! UHH!!” Nathan’s face was red as a thick stream of cum blow all over his body. “Oooooh!!” He passed out from the strong sexual encounter. All that was left of Nathan’s younger self was his undersized and torn up clothes that was scattered around the fainted DILF.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what he wanted but that&#39;s pretty gross.&quot; Mr. Turin said. &quot;Frank, can you go to my office and take the box of condoms in my desk? This boys need to learn to control their new hormones, especially the younger ones. Or I mean, the former younger ones.&quot;</p>
