<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chase herself was feeling very conflicted.  She'd never been an unpopular girl, but she'd never had this kind of attention paid to her either.  She nearly felt delirious!<br />
<br />
What's worse, she couldn't help but notice how attractive the girls were...nor the fact that they were trying to make themselves even more attractive!  Already a lot of young, healthy girlflesh was on display, and the better-endowed girls were starting to show more of their cleavage by the minute.<br />
<br />
Chase had never considered herself to be a lesbian.  Oh sure, she'd had a crush on her next-door neighbor for years, but her mom claimed that girl crushes like that were totally normal.  Ok, granted, she'd had sexual thoughts about Lina on occasion, but that didn't make her a lesbian...did it?<br />
<br />
By all rights, she ought to be disturbed by all this female attention...but she found she liked it.  A lot.<br />
<br />
So she was on cloud nine when she got to class.<br />
<br />
Now as it happens, Chase, due to a scheduling error, had a few classes outside of her age group.  Second hour was one of these, World History with Mr. Archer.<br />
<br />
Like most of the girls, Chase found Mr. Archer (his given name was Glenn, how hot!) attractive, and had entertained a few fantasies about him.  Quite aware of this fact, Mr. Archer made it a point to wear his wedding ring, and to let the girls know he was happily married.<br />
<br />
(Chase had seen Mrs. Archer once, and had to admit, the wife was smoking hot!)<br />
<br />
In this class, Chase sat in front of Natalie Preston.  Natalie was a Junior this year, but she might as well be a Senior, given that she was the most popular girl in school.<br />
<br />
She was tall, athletic, and built like a model, with ample breasts and long dark hair.  Her skin seemed flawless, and she had a smile that could light up a room.  She wasn't a bad person either, at least, she wasn't stuck up.  She made it a point to know everyone's names, and even if she wasn't your friend, she didn't seem to care for bullies.<br />
<br />
For example, when the school year began, one of the senior girls was harrassing a sophmore girl who'd shown up with an emo cut, with her long bangs dyed pink.<br />
<br />
Chase had actually liked the look, but once Violet Bishop started in on someone, they were quick to become pariahs.<br />
<br />
Natalie hadn't said a word, but the very next day, she showed up to school with her hair dyed purple.  The principal had hemmed and hawwed about the dress code, but Natalie simply pointed out her hairstyle was perfectly legal, and gave the principal a note from her parents that gave her permission.<br />
<br />
Violet had been furious, and at lunch, marched right up to Natalie and demanded to know what she was thinking.  Natalie's response had become legendary.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh the hair?  I thought you'd like purple, Vi.  Given your name and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Something about the way Natalie had said it caused everyone in earshot to snicker or even laugh outright, and just like that, picking on people because of their hair color was no longer cool.<br />
<br />
Natalie apparently liked the look, since she hadn't stopped dying it since.<br />
<br />
Chase found herself stealing a few glances at Natalie, who was, oddly enough, the only other girl in the class.  Natalie's skirt was short, and it showed off her long legs nicely.<br />
<br />
As she turned for another look, she made eye contact with Natalie, who had apparently turned to look...at Chase!<br />
<br />
Time seemed to freeze...but then Natalie smiled at her.  Not her usual cheerful, friendly smile, however.  It was more reserved and mysterious, and Natalie seemed to have an odd look in her eyes.<br />
<br />
After class, Natalie simply dropped a note on Chase's desk, and walked away.<br />
<br />
Natalie stared after the older girl's backside for several moments before leaving.<br />
<br />
Gin followed Chase, who paused to read the note, and then began moving much faster through the hallways.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, Gin lost sight of his quarry, and after ducking into a bathroom, turned invisible to search the school.<br />
<br />
The school nurse's office was adjacent to the gym.  It was a small room, little used, since the school couldn't afford a nurse full-time.  Instead, the nurse would be at the junior high three days of the week, and the high school the remaining two; the schools were only two miles apart, so she could get from one to the other quickly in an emergency.<br />
<br />
Chase expected the door to be locked, but it opened easily.  The lights were out, and the only light came from a translucent skylight in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lock the door, please.&quot;  Natalie's voice, but she was very quiet.<br />
<br />
Chase locked the door and walked towards the bed in the back of the office.<br />
<br />
Natalie was sitting on the edge of it, head down.  She'd taken off her shoes and socks, and seemed very nervous about something.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you want to see me for, Natalie?&quot;<br />
<br />
The older girl looked up and Chase almost gasped at how beautiful the other girl was.  The soulful look in Natalie's dark blue eyes took Chase aback.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were looking at me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase blushed.  &quot;Well...you're very pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think so?&quot;  <br />
<br />
What was going on here?  &quot;Of course, who doesn't?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie frowned.  &quot;This was a mistake.  You should go before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase crouched down at the other girl's feet.  &quot;Before what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I make a fool out of myself.&quot;  The older girl seeemed near tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn't do that.  Natalie, whatever it is, you can tell me.  Honest, I'd never make fun of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie bit her lip and then reached out to touch Chase's hair.  It felt good, and without thinking, Chase leaned into the other girl's touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no you...you'd never be like that, Brittany.&quot;<br />
<br />
Normally Chase didn't like letting people use her given name, but the way Natalie said it...was different.  The taller girl ran her fingers lightly through Chase's hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've been watching you for some time now, Chase.  You always seemed like someone special, someone worth knowing.  Everyone else seems so shallow...fake, even.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know.  Everyone thinks they have to be someone else, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie placed a hand on Chase's cheek.  &quot;Except you, Brittany.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase grinned.  &quot;Well...I realized I wasn't as pretty as other girls, so I decided I'd just be me, and I'm ok with that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie frowned again.  &quot;That's stupid...you're beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, on the inside, right?  But..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Brittany.  Don't.  Don't even.  Today when I saw you walk into the classroom, I realized it.  You're the most beautiful girl I've ever met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase felt very warm hearing that.  &quot;Wha...what changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie smirked a little.  &quot;I don't know...it's like I was seeing you before, but not really.  Like I was blind to how beautiful you really were.  But I'm seeing you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase couldn't help but smile.  There was nothing but sincerity in Natalie's words (even if she really didn't believe it), and she could feel her heart beating faster in her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Natalie.  Coming from you...that's special.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie smiled back at her.  &quot;Brittany...I think..I'm...in love with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase blinked.  &quot;Wah...what?!&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a look of pain in Natalie's eyes.  &quot;Why did I say that?  I'm so stupid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Chase quickly hugged the taller girl as tightly as she could.  &quot;No!  You're not!&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie started to cry, but she hung onto me like a life preserver.  Chase waited until everything came out.  She'd never really given much thought to how other people treated Natalie.  They all wanted something from her.  Nobody seemed to care about Natalie as a person.  Her parents were always planning out her life for her, boys just wanted to have sex with her, and girls just wanted to leech off her popularity.<br />
<br />
Finally, Natalie stopped talking, and just sniffled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Natalie...I just want you to know.  I'm not like that.  I care about you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two girls looked into each other's eyes for a long moment.  When Natalie leaned in to kiss her, Chase was paralyzed.<br />
<br />
She was keenly aware of the girl in her arms, how soft her skin was, and how nice her hair smelled...like honeysuckle and lilacs.  Her lips were velvet soft and warm, and they parted slightly.<br />
<br />
Chase felt the damp tip of Natalie's tongue against her lips, gently probing, asking for entry.<br />
<br />
Chase opened her mouth.  She'd practiced kissing with Lina before (it was really nice!).  Natalie knew what she was doing as well, and when they finally parted, Chase took in a sharp breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;...wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Natalie looked so vulnerable just then.  She'd done something taboo, and Chase realized she had absolute power over the older girl.<br />
<br />
With a word, she could destroy Natalie.</p>
