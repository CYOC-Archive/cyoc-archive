<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad was irritated at Jeff. Why would he be so angry at his own brother over a simple computer? He didn&#39;t really care, but figured it was the reason for Jeff&#39;s mood recently. Get the computer back, and they can get back to how he liked things: Active and hot. Just thinking about it made his dick stir, grinning as he re-adjusted himself while driving.<br />
<br />
Jeff was sitting in the passenger&#39;s seat, hoping this wasn&#39;t a mistake. It was bad enough being forced to let Bruiser have his way, and now Brad. But if he couldn&#39;t get back to normal, or at least get rid of the controls his brother put on him, then he&#39;d be miserable the rest of his life!<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long to drive back to the house, Jeff wanting to jump out of the car and run inside, but because of the programming from the Chronivac he waited for Brad to open the door first. Something about Jeff&#39;s attitude and actions started bothering the larger man, things not quite matching up in his head the way he was sure they should. As soon as he opened the door to the house and went inside, he started talking again. &quot;The computer you want is the one Rich has in their bedroom, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, sir.&quot; Jeff couldn&#39;t help but respond submissively, his body moving on its own as soon as the front door was closed. He had no idea what he was doing until the fake memories kicked in again, Brad being very strict on what Jeff was allowed to wear in the house when they were alone. Specifically: Nothing but the collar, unless he had permission otherwise. And being the &quot;dream lover&quot; he was, Jeff obeyed his Alpha obediently, stripping down to nothing and folding his clothes carefully to keep from making a mess. &quot;T-thank you, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad couldn&#39;t help but get aroused at the display, though it didn&#39;t really interest him much right now. Jeff did anything he wanted, and kept up with his sexual appetite easily. But with the attitude he saw back at the hospital, he was starting to question how much he actually enjoyed someone who didn&#39;t struggle...<br />
<br />
It only took a minute to get to Richie&#39;s bedroom, and even less time to get onto the computer. Brad never had trouble guessing the password, remembering sneaking in more than once to order &quot;supplies&quot; for fun with Jeff. As soon as he got on this time, however, he was met with the strangest screen. Even when he was a dog, he never actually saw the Chronivac, so he had no idea what it was he was looking at. &quot;Hey, Jeff! What the hell is this? What does your brother have a model of me on his computer, with all this information?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to answer. Not just to try and convince Brad to help more, but also because his programming wanted him to obey and answer the question. But it conflicted with the programming to never talk about the Chronivac. Luckily for Jeff, this conflict caused a warning message to appear on the screen.<br />
<br />
[center]&quot;Notice: Conditioning Programming Conflict! Details: Subject Jeff (Max) conditioning &quot;dream lover&quot; answering question conflicts with &quot;never speak about Chronivac&quot; topic taboo.&quot; Resolve:[/center]<br />
<br />
Brad didn&#39;t think twice before clicking on &quot;remove taboo topics&quot;, wanting to get answers. As soon as he did, Jeff started talking, quickly beginning to ramble as he explained not just the device but also what Richie had done and was forcing him to act like now. Being turned into a dog, letting Bruiser mount him, Bruiser being turned into Brad, and being forced to act like the man of Brad&#39;s dreams. Because of the Chronivac, he couldn&#39;t actually say he wasn&#39;t gay or  By the end of it, Jeff was wimpering and crying a bit.<br />
<br />
Brad, on the other hand, was initially curious. As he heard what Rich had done, to his own brother, he quickly got furious. Brad grabbed Jeff, pulling him into another quick kiss before turning back to the machine. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Jeff. I&#39;ll fix this. And that bastard brother of yours doesn&#39;t deserve my sister! Just tell me how I can help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff was still partially disgusted at the thought of kissing a guy, but his body reacted on its own still, getting aroused at the touch of Brad&#39;s lips. Jeff was looking at the screen as well as Brad opened up his profile. He wanted to say to change everything back, and erase the conditioning programmed into him from the machine. He wanted to tell him to change things so he was the one about to marry Beth. But he was still being forced by the conditioning programming to answer the way Brad&#39;s &quot;dream lover&quot; would. &quot;I... Go to the last tab, where it says &#39;other options&#39; and erase... erase the lines that say I can&#39;t touch the Chronivac or tell anyone about it. And the one that says I can&#39;t hurt Richie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad followed the instructions, pausing as he saw the two other lines in the list while erasing them all one by one and saving the changes. &quot;You... aren&#39;t gay? You aren&#39;t actually in love with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff choked, the programming forcing him to answer at first, pressing up against Brad suggestively. &quot;N-no! That&#39;s not it! I love you, sir! I can&#39;t-&quot; As soon as all the lines were gone, Jeff jumped back as if Brad were on fire, grabbing a pillow to cover up. &quot;I can&#39;t believe my brother made me act like that for you! I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m not gay, and I don&#39;t love you. Thanks, but I love Beth! She was my girlfriend before my brother did this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad was hurt, worse than he expected to be. He knew it wasn&#39;t Jeff&#39;s fault, but he still couldn&#39;t keep from growling and pointing to the door, turning away from his former lover. &quot;Get... get out of my sight, then! If you hate it here, then leave! I&#39;ll deal with that... lying bastard you call a brother!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff flinched and left quickly, taking off the collar and pulling on clothes. He knew it was going to be hard, but he still felt bad for Brad. Maybe he can turn his brother into the male bitch Brad wants, after the larger man is off the computer. It would be a fitting punishment...<br />
<br />
Brad waited until Jeff was out of the room before wiping his eyes dry. Then he looked at the screen, and Jeff&#39;s still-open profile. It wasn&#39;t fair what Rich did to Jeff... but he could change it so Jeff enjoyed it, and even make him forget the past. But wouldn&#39;t that make him as bad as Rich?</p>
