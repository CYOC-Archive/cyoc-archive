<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Battery at 65%...&quot; Ryan moved through the opening screen and clicked on the map, the school was a glow with hundreds of different dots representing freshmen through seniors as well as teachers and staff. Ryan scrolled around, looking at the different names. It in a small town school like Bucktail, he knew almost all of the names and had, had some sort of interaction with most of them. He clicked on some of the different girls he liked to see them naked on the screen. &quot;Whoa look at the size of Cindy&#39;s nipples&quot; he chuckled out loud to the empty bathroom.  He backed out of Cindy&#39;s stats and noticed she was sitting next to Tim Burns. Tim was a wide receiver on the football team, and one of the many people who found it funny to pick on Ryan for one thing or another.  Ryan looked around the class room and saw a few other of the football team there too.  Tim&#39;s friend Ben was sitting right behind him, Mitch over a few students to the left. <br />
<br />
Ryan stared at the screen for a few moments. A battle raged inside of him, he wasn&#39;t a bad person, he believed that good people got good things in the end and that bad people were punished. Yes, he could remember a time when each of those boys had made him feel badly. They had checked him into a locker or teased him about being fat, or unathletic, or a nerd. In a town where football and farming was everything, being short, tubby, and book smart was not considered acceptable let alone cool.  He couldn&#39;t help but thinking that this was different, that his cousins and brothers really deserved it for years of being jerks and treating him like garbage. These three probably didn&#39;t even know his name, not to mention that they&#39;d hurt his feelings. They had hurt his feelings though, he thought to himself, and he now had the ability to make himself feel better about it, and what was best they&#39;d never know, who did it. <br />
<br />
Tim had always been the ring leader when it came to singling out people he felt were inferior and worthy of his contempt.  Ryan pulled up Tim&#39;s statistics, they were pretty average.  Ryan thought about what Tim was most proud about, the answer came as quickly as the question, his prowess on the football field. Ryan clicked on Tim&#39;s hands, they were big and strong enough to snatch a football right out of the air and carry it into the end zone.  Ryan decided to make them a third of the size they use to be, the 17 year old now looked like he had the hands of a 10 year old. Ryan laughed at the updated model, it looked ridiculous. Next Ryan clicked on Tim&#39;s left leg and shortened it two inches. Tim would be a little taller than 6 feet when he stood on his right leg and almost 5&#39;10&quot; if he was on his left. That would slow down his 40 time quiet a bit. <br />
<br />
Ben was next. When Ryan thought of Ben the first thing that popped into his mind was great hair. Ben was meticulous about making sure his hair was aways perfect. The rumor was he went to get it touched up every week and bought products that weren&#39;t available in town on amazon to maintain his look.  Ryan clicked through some option on the scalp until he found one for male pattern baldness, which was currently set at &quot;N/A.&quot; He played around with it until it was set so that Ben would be almost completely bald by the time he graduated next year. Just for good measure, Ryan added 30 pounds of fat, he wasn&#39;t sure what position on the team Ben had, but figured it wouldn&#39;t help. <br />
<br />
Mitch presented a little bit of problem.  Ryan was extremely satisfied with the personal punishments he was going to dish out on Ben and Tim, but he didn&#39;t know much about Mitch besides that he had been there a few times when Ryan had been bullied by the other two. He considered just skipping Mitch before reconsidering; he had the power, there were no consequences to his actions. So Ryan went to the most important area he could think of for a 17 year old boy.  Mitch had a 5&quot; penis soft and 7&quot; hard, Ryan thought for a second about how that would have previously impressed him.  It wasn&#39;t creative or unique but Ryan shrunk it down to less than 2 inch hard while keeping it at 5 soft. That would be funny, and confusing he thought.  Ryan clicked on Mitch&#39;s golf ball sized testicles and added another, he&#39;d now have three balls. <br />
<br />
Ryan clicked through and accepted all the changes. He watched the familiar countdown, shut down the machine and headed off to class.</p>
