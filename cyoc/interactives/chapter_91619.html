<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hogo the homan went undercover to infiltrate the humans. He changed his name to Hugo. The community he went to was a private men&#39;s college. He spent a few months establishing his cover as a human college student.<br />
<br />
The night he started his experiment was during a frat party. Naturally, several of the frat men invited girls but Hugo had arranged ahead of time. From the O.S.S. Bogle, Donshel and his assistants flooded the community with subliminal messages so that very few girls showed up at the frat party. They didn&#39;t want to influence the community too much because they wanted to see natural reactions but they had to use some subliminal messages to isolate their targets.<br />
<br />
Hugo waited until most of the guests had arrived and had a few drinks. Some were already getting drunk but Hugo didn&#39;t want to experiment on drunk frats. He wanted to experiment on frats who were either still sober or who were only experiencing lowered inhibitions. If the frats were already staggering, slurring their speech or in any way showing signs of mental impairment, they were too far gone for his experiment.<br />
<br />
Hugo decided that Danny was a good target. He started talking to Danny. The conversation turned to alien abduction and Hugo joked that maybe anal probes were just the alien&#39;s way of saying hi.<br />
<br />
Then Hugo brought out his dicking camera and explained it to Danny.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;That&#39;s impossible. You can&#39;t turn a person into a penis with a camera. First of all, we don&#39;t even have the kind of technology that could change a person and second, if we did have that technology, it would be in the form of nanites, not cameras.&quot;<br />
<br />
But Hugo persisted in trying to convince Danny of what the dicking camera could do.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;You&#39;re drunk. Either that or your trying to set me up for a prank.<br />
<br />
Hugo kept trying to convince Danny and they attracted a crowd.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Alright, prove it to me. I&#39;ll pose for your camera and you can turn me into a dick but just to make sure this isn&#39;t a prank, I choose where and how I pose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo agreed and Danny searched for any places where he might be ambushed. He even searched the camera which looked like an ordinary camera with no holes that would shoot ink.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;How about I take a picture of you first. If this is a trick camera, you won&#39;t want to fall for the trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo agreed and set the dicking camera to non-dicking setting. After his picture was taken, Danny agreed to pose.<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;This will prove that your camera is just a camera and that you are just a drunk idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo triggered the dicking camera and Danny&#39;s clothes billowed into a pile. Hugo reached in and searched until he found a stiff member. He pulled Danny the dick out and held him up for the crowd to see.<br />
<br />
Danny was a good-sized, uncut dick. He wasn&#39;t large by any means but he wasn&#39;t small either. What was most impressive about him was his large balls that were held tightly to his base. Hugo passed Danny the dick around. Several guys refused to touch Danny but several other guys played with Danny in a joking manner. One of the few girls found Danny dropped into her drink. She screamed and left the party.<br />
<br />
Danny the dick frequently had a little pre-cum on his tip. One of the guys used Danny the dick to draw on the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
The demand for Danny the dick was high. Several people wanted to use Danny as a joke. Hugo asked if anyone else wanted to become a dick like Danny but no one volunteered.<br />
<br />
Then the frat started playing poker and other gambling games since most of the frat loved to gamble. So they decided that the stakes would be that the losers get dicked.<br />
<br />
Bryan was the next to get dicked. When he lost, groaned and looked down. The other guys were already teasing him about what they would do with him once he was a dick.<br />
<br />
Brock said, &quot;Show us what you will look like. Strip. You might as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan refused but Brock got a bunch of guys to strip Bryan.<br />
<br />
Brock said, &quot;We want to compare the before and after. Is it your own dick you&#39;ll be turned into or just a generic dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
When Bryan was naked, the frat guys poked him and he did his best to protect himself. Then Hugo told them to get out of the way unless they wanted to be dicked themselves. When Bryan was standing by himself, he covered himself and looked terrified.<br />
<br />
Bryan was also a good sized dick but he was circumcised and his glans was as big and red as a strawberry. He curved to the right. A few more guys lost bets and wound up dicked. Brock was a short but fat dick.<br />
<br />
Troy used a dick to sneak up behind people and dribble pre-cum on their necks. Steve shouted at Troy threatening to beat him up. Perry was unconscious and the frat stripped him and drew all over him with pre-cum. Then someone grabbed Hugo&#39;s camera and dicked Perry. Perry was a really skinny  but really long dick.<br />
<br />
Hugo didn&#39;t like that. He didn&#39;t say anything but the point of his experiment was to see if he could persuade guys to be dicked, to see how easy it was to manipulate humans. It didn&#39;t do anything for his experiment to dick someone who was unconscious.<br />
<br />
The night was coming to an end and Hugo had only dicked eighteen guys, not including Perry. Several of the guys were passed out now and several more left so Hugo was about to call an end to his experiment. However, as he left the frat, Steve called him over to a private place. He admitted that he didn&#39;t dare admit it in front of the others but he really wanted to be dicked. So he found a private place to hide his clothes and let Hugo dick him. Perry was a tiny dick.<br />
<br />
Hugo decided to not end the experiment. He figured the only reason he didn&#39;t get more than eighteen dicks was because he chose the wrong place, a frat party. He decided to extend his stay and set up in various different ways to get more dicks.<br />
<br />
The end of the experiment would have meant restoring all the dicked guys to normal and giving them subliminal messages to suggest it had all been only a hallucination. Now he had to call Mint to get some advice on how to extend the experiment. He went home and used his communicator disguised as his computer.<br />
<br />
On his screen, Hugo saw a blue dick and balls. He had called while Mint was off duty and the computer explained that Mint had decided to be dicked for the night so Hugo would have to wait until morning to discuss extending the experiment.</p>
