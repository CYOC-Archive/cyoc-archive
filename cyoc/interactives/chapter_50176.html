<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As midnight approached the howls barks and yips within the estate slowly began to wind <br />
down up rev up for one finally hurrah before finally calling it a night. <br />
<br />
Terri and Sandi leaned against each other as they watched the constellations drift by. <br />
Jasmine leaning against Terri on the opposite side. <br />
<br />
&quot;I still say Fox could take them all.&quot; Jasmine said. <br />
<br />
Terri answered flatly, &quot;You've barely played a game in your left I'm sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I played the shooters a few times at Toys'R'Us' game demo back when they still had <br />
those.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Sandi said nothing at this point. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can I ask... why aren't you down there with everyone?&quot; Ulysses asked. <br />
<br />
Sarah looked ready to tell Ulysses to not make her repeat herself but then thought of a <br />
different response, &quot;Doesn't really interest me that much, if Master wants me to be his <br />
girlfriend for the evening then I'll be first in line before anyone else gets the chance... But <br />
I'm not all that interested in a bunch of other wolves just cause they're free.  You wanna be <br />
a free sex toy cause it's your -responsibility- right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Ulysses leaned against her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well buck up. Not bulk up. If I wanted to have sex with a wolf I'd be down there right now <br />
already. But I'm not. Know why? Because I find being up here seeing some hot balls of gas <br />
a million miles away drifting through an unimaginably vast and empty cosmos is more <br />
satisfying, at least to me, than having a random wolf's thingie in me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So why me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I feel relaxed around you kiddo, knowing you aren't made for that,&quot; She put her <br />
arm around him, &quot;Maybe I think you were a bit lonely and you needed some company that <br />
didn't relate to your 'one true function.' Maybe I was curious and wanted to get to know <br />
you a bit better. Maybe... I dunno... maybe you're just relaxing, let my guard down around <br />
you knowing nothing will happen right? ... Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah turned to see Ulysses was asleep on her shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh. Sweet dreams Ulysses.&quot; She carefully picked up the lad and arranged it so he could <br />
rid piggy back on her as she took him back down (being very much careful). <br />
<br />
Terri meanwhile picked up the now sleeping Sandi in her arms, Jasmine half asleep <br />
holding onto Terri's tail so she didn't go wandering off the roof top. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's the real story with you and him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what I said. Nothing else to it. Ulysses' a good kid, before the change and after.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri said, &quot;Could just use the game to age him a few year and bulk him up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... that... that wouldn't be right, kiddo... he doesn't need to be a sex machine to be part <br />
of the pack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that's what all the guys were KEPT guys to begin with! There's no point to'em being a <br />
male then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... maybe no... give the pups ten years, they won't be interested in each other I <br />
hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just made that up on the spot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look. I kept Caroline from falling over herself, and I'm going to keep Ulysses from falling <br />
over himself. Besides like I said, there's more to it than sex.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Says who?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Says me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna go to bed now.&quot; Jasmine nearly whined. <br />
<br />
&quot;See ya guys there after I drop Ulysses in the guy's den.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See ya.&quot; Terri nodded. <br />
<br />
As Sarah began her careful climb down, a thought occurred to him, 'Is this what it's like to <br />
have a little brother? Naw, he's not driving me nuts enough... then again, maybe there's <br />
more to siblings then that.' <br />
<br />
Sarah looked back at smiled weary at the lad. 'See you in the morning kiddo.' <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;All hail princess Jenny! All hail princess Jenny!&quot; Jenny delightfully rod on grandpa who was <br />
the size of an elephant her black fur matching her grandfather's black gold fur nicely.  The <br />
wolf people citizens of the kingdom of Glenedale cheering on their princess. Jenny's <br />
siblings following behind her on pony sized deer, riding submissively to their smarter, <br />
prettier and cooler princess.  'It's good to be princess.' Jenny thought as one of her royal <br />
subjects threw her a bundle of flowers. <br />

Bart gasped in horror as the shadows turned into real, solid, living masses of darkness, <br />
their glowing red eyes glaring at the little boy wolf. Bart backed away from them in horror <br />
and hit his back to the window. <br />
<br />
&quot;You killed us... you killed us...&quot; Whispered the shadows as they got closer. Bart then fell <br />
out the window, the reddish brown boy wolf took off running as the house turned into a <br />
giant shadow head trying to eat him. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Look! Up! Up in the sky! Is it a Bird? Is it plain?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's Super Kevin!&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have anything to say in your defense?&quot; Said he big giant oger in the judge's outfit <br />
to Marcy in the defendant's box. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I've done absolutely nothing wrong.&quot; Marcy said simply.<br />
<br />
The ogers all looked at each other. Then shrugged. &quot;Okay, case dismissed, would you like <br />
some cookies?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sugar cookies with white frosting and blue and red sprinkles?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OKAY!&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Visiting Pluto had been such a clever idea Alice thought. It was positively wonderful! It was <br />
so mighty clever of her indeed! She danced on top of the frozen atmosphere, and waved at <br />
Charon, Pluto's moon. 'How can it be considered a dwarf planet when it has a moon all it's <br />
own?' Alice wondered.  'I can't wait to bring Abbey and Samantha here! They'll love it!'<br />
<br />
That was when Alice heard something behind her shatter. <br />
<br />
Alice turned around, a meteorite had shattered the mirror on the space prob... <br />
<br />
&quot;No...no no no no!&quot; Alice desperately looked for all flat reflective surface that could serve <br />
as a mirror but there was nothing, just the cold and the darkness. <br />
<br />
&quot;PLEASE! Someone do help me!&quot; Alice cried out desperate to the infinite nothingness that <br />
surrounded he little planet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help!&quot; Alice sat up in bed, her nose drenched in sweet. She looked around, she was in the <br />
reflection of the cub's bedroom, she was wearing her nightie, it was some time after <br />
midnight. <br />
<br />
Alice silently climbed out of the mirror, her body turning into indestructible glass as she <br />
did, or something like that, the Transform hadn't been that precise. She silently sat down <br />
next to Mr. P and curled up next to him, falling back to sleep in his fur. <br />
<br />

<br />
Dawn came as night ended, as nights always do. Jack and Marcine awoke first. They said <br />
good morning to one another and began grazing, being occasionally on the look out for <br />
wolves, but the encounter with the giant wolf and the pups suggesting that Jensen's world <br />
was binding. <br />
<br />
What happened next was simply inevitable. That didn't make it any more pleasant however. <br />
What happened next simply was. <br />
<br />
Their musk did what it was made to do. It attracted more deer to the superior stock that <br />
was Jack and Marcine. The deer immune to sickness and disease, able to produce in <br />
numbers ultimately enough to full sustain the bad wolf pack autonomously. <br />
<br />
Jack saw the doe first. Marcine saw the buck first. Both coming from different location. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Said Jack. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Said the new doe. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings.&quot; Said Marcine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings.&quot; Said the new buck. <br />
<br />
What happened next was quite predictable. <br />
<br />
It was a dispassionate and as indifferent as 'insert tab A into slot B.' There was none of the <br />
emotion Marcine and Jack felt they united with each other the day before. These two <br />
unions simply were, they were to be sealed as part of union to forge a part of the herd <br />
that was to be forged. Pleasure was a passing superficial taste, Joy wasn't even there. <br />
<br />
And when it was over, it simply was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the herd.&quot; Jack said simply. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm welcomed into your herd. My prime buck.&quot; Said the doe. &quot;I offer my womb to the <br />
herd.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to our herd.&quot; Said Marcine. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm welcomed to our herd, prime doe.&quot; Bowed the new buck. &quot;I'll add my seed to our <br />
herd.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Adam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your name is Eve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-name?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Name....?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes name... &quot; Jack said. <br />
<br />
Marcine said, &quot;A name... what you are...who you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eve.&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
So awoke the six groups (Ulysses and Sarah's having broken up rather than sleeping in the <br />
same place) slowly, but with a lot more relaxation and energy than the previous morning. <br />
While Pearl and June did wash away Zackery's scent, Grace and 'Belle did not, they had no <br />
reason to be ashamed of mating with their friend their new wolf mentality had spoken. <br />
<br />
Maxine, Robyn and Millie awoke in a pile of each other with Roger safely a few feet away.  <br />
Lawrence found himself awakening like an arabian prince. While Nick awake to find Nicole <br />
had spirited him away to the other side of the room for herself when the wolves had <br />
started calling it a night. As for Jensen, well, you can guess. <br />
<br />
Mr. P was surprised to see Alice next to him... but chose not press, a verbal girl like Alice <br />
didn't seem the type to bottle something up if it bothered her, if she as going to share it, <br />
she'd share it before breakfast, if not, Mr. P doubted there was anything he could do to <br />
pry it out of her. <br />
<br />
Fran and Darla had immediately set to work on preparing breakfast for the pack had <br />
become their unofficial task. That there was all that much to it. The shadows made their <br />
own breakfast, and the rest was just a steady diet of meat that would have left a human <br />
being with a heart attack from such an unrounded diet. <br />
<br />
Was also becoming a tradition within the pack, Alice invited the twins into the mirror <br />
world to share breakfast with her (the only place she ever felt hungry if you could call it <br />
that). <br />
<br />
&quot;Today is a bright new day.&quot; Marcy declared to no one in particular.</p>
