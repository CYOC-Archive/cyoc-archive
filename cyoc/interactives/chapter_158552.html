<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;...bull. I know it&#39;s not exactly flattering to become an animal that your species keeps as livestock, but something tells me you will find it more enjoyable than it sounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
I must say I really wasn&#39;t sure what the talking fox meant by this, so I went to ask her a question and startled myself when a long bovine bellow rang out. Did that come out of me? I cleared my throat and tried again. Moooo!<br />
<br />
She giggled. &quot;You might want to get out of those clothes while you still can. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to fit you much longer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her suggestion kind of freaked me out, because I just met this girl and she was basically asking me to take my clothes off in front of her. I had to remind myself that she wasn&#39;t really a girl, even though she could talk, she was an animal, and if I was going to be one too, I might as well stop being so dramatic about nudity. And my clothes were already getting tighter, meaning I was getting bigger, which left me know doubt that I was really changing. I wasn&#39;t sure whether that was really a good thing or not, but it was time to find out.<br />
<br />
By the time my whole outfit was lying on the floor, I was just a very tall, very muscular human with a bovine voice. That was soon to change. A piercing prick assaulted either side of my head, and then a dull weight surged out. It didn&#39;t take a rocket scientist to figure out what happened, but still it was surprising to get a hold of those thick, curvy cones of keratin sticking out of my massive head. My horns were so long I couldn&#39;t reach the end of them! I was really stunned that this was actually happening. I mooed again and felt my ears start to wobble on their own accord. Those things were a lot longer (and hairier!) than they were before.<br />
<br />
All of this time I had been ignoring a very intimate swelling feeling in my crotch and in a straight line up my belly to the base of my chest. Yuna had been polite enough not to say anything, and I didn&#39;t want to draw attention to my nether regions in full view someone else, but I couldn&#39;t hold out any longer. Surely she had already seen whatever was down there, and I deserved to get a look at what I was feeling. I turned around a little bit, feigning privacy, sneakily looked down, and did a double-take. My balls were huge! They were hanging so low, in such a big sack, that I might as well have not bothered to turn around. There wasn&#39;t going to be any chance of hiding these things from now on. Part of me was proud that they were mine, part of me was unnerved that some people do actually eat those, and part of me was still embarrassed about being naked.<br />
<br />
I couldn&#39;t directly see my dick anymore, but I couldn&#39;t really miss the indentation it made under the skin of my crotch, running all the way up my bulky abdomen to a little tuft of shaggy hair under my chest. The horny male in me was really starting to see the perks of turning into a bull. No man on the planet had a bigger manhood than I had right now! And none of them had a nifty belly holster to keep theirs in like I did, either. I saw the pointy hot-pink tip peek out the top and had to remind myself that I wasn&#39;t alone, so I didn&#39;t dare start touching. I couldn&#39;t really stop myself from looking, though, until another change made me jump and look behind me. Moooo!<br />
<br />
It started as a sudden weight on my tailbone, then it was a tingly feeling like a foot had been asleep and gone numb. Then it wasn&#39;t numb anymore. It was a thick bony rope covered in my own skin, ending in a copious tassel of shaggy hair, hanging every bit as low as my balls and beckoning me to try it out. I couldn&#39;t believe I had my very own tail now! I twisted and turned and craned my neck around to watch it flop around and sway back and forth. I didn&#39;t need my hands to make it do that, but I couldn&#39;t keep my hands off of it since they were eager to get a handle on my new fifth limb. It didn&#39;t last very long, though, because I wasn&#39;t going to have hands for much longer.<br />
<br />
Before I knew it, I was much too heavy and too thoroughly altered to stay upright, and my hands and feet were so fused and lengthened that I wasn&#39;t going to be grasping my tail, my horns, my (ahem) third horn, or anything else from now on. All I had were a couple of toes ending in thick brown cloven hoofs and my feet were pretty much the same. Falling over onto all fours sealed the deal, and I had to face the fact that I&#39;d given my humanity away. Brown fur sprouted over every square inch of my body, and I hoped that I hadn&#39;t made an impulsive mistake by wasting a magic creature&#39;s gratitude on this.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d never felt stronger, though, and I noticed that even in my four-legged stance I towered over the little fox who had given me this &quot;gift.&quot; My snout grew out and pushed my eyes apart, and I found myself seeing more of the room at once than I used to be able to. I stuck my longer tongue out and waved it around in front of me: I could easily lick the wet nose at the end of my broad muzzle. It was weird, but it was oddly relaxing. I snorted, shook my giant head, swung that tail again, and looked back at Yuna with a weird mix of nervousness, confusion, and gratitude.</p>
