<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A shining red light covered the guy&#39;s body completely from head to toe. It was too bright that he can&#39;t keep his eyes open.<br />
&quot;Proceeding with phase 1: Body.&quot; A scientist said as he was typing something in a machine.<br />
At the time, Mark saw how slowly but firmly the guy&#39;s muscles began to grow. His already toned arms went from weightlifter to bodybuilder in seconds, as well as his legs and torso. His shoulders grew really wide to allow more space for muscles and his neck turned thicker than his head. Finally his hands and feet became meatier as Mark could see the now sausage like fingers and toes.<br />
&quot;What the-!!&quot; Mark shouted but quickly covered his mouth when he saw a scientist move a little alarmed. &quot;What are they doing?&quot; He whispered to himself.<br />
Although what happened to him, the guy was still motionless on the table. He occasionally moved his fingers which now looked funny in Mark&#39;s opinion. His actual huge size covered completely the table and Mark guessed he was at least 7&#39; tall.<br />
&quot;Phase 1 completed.&quot; Indicated the scientist near the machine. &quot;Initiating phase 2: Mind.&quot;<br />
The red light that covered the guy turned into orange and it kept that way for some minutes. Apparently, in Mark&#39;s POV, nothing was happening and he just stared astounded until the scientists spoke again.<br />
&quot;Testing phase 2. Subject, please tell me the seasons backwards.&quot; Said a scientist with clipboard.<br />
&quot;Retniw, nmutua, remmus, gnirps.&quot; The guy said in a robotically way.<br />
&quot;Excellent, now tell me the seasons as a little boy.&quot; The same scientist told him and to Mark&#39;s amazement, the guy&#39;s voice changed from his former deepness to a high kiddish voice.<br />
&quot;Perfect. We have complete control over his mind and body.&quot; The scientist said.<br />
&quot;Then, we will continue to phase 3: Maternity.&quot; The scientist with the machine said as he turned the light into a yellow one.<br />
Once again, Mark couldn&#39;t believe what he&#39;s seeing. As the yellow light covered the guy&#39;s body, his gut began to inflate. His former abs quickly disappeared into a big hairy balloon-like belly who Mark assumed was filled with another being inside.<br />
&quot;Nine months development.&quot; A lady scientist said. &quot;Procede to phase 4.&quot;<br />
&quot;Phase 4: Fertility.&quot; The scientist said and turned the light from yellow to green.<br />
The guy&#39;s genitals, who Mark had tried to avoid seeing until now, began to pump. Actually, his genitals were laughably small compared to his huge body, so at first they grew to match it. In comparison with Mark&#39;s own genitals, the guys balls were 5 times bigger and they were still growing. In a few seconds, they turned huge like soccer balls and his penis looked like a 2 liter coke bottle hanging between them.<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot; Mark gasped.<br />
&quot;Keep going to phase 5.&quot; The lady scientist said. &quot;We need to know if he can make it this time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, initiating phase 5: Cyborg.&quot; The man said as he typed on the machine.<br />
Suddenly, the light that covered the freak guy turned blue. Once again, nothing seemed to change until that a scientist spoke.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s time.&quot; He said as he closed to the guy but without touching the light. &quot;Open your legs.&quot; The guy reacted and spread his legs giving the scientist a good look of his now huge balls that softly fell on the cold table. &quot;Thanks, now. Give birth.&quot;<br />
Mark almost screamed from what he had heard. &quot;Was it real that that guy was going to give birth another human being? He wasn&#39;t pregnant an hour ago, or was he?&quot; Mark&#39;s mind was so confused right now. &quot;Anyway, he&#39;s a man. He can&#39;t give birth. He hasn&#39;t female organs.&quot;<br />
As Mark was still thinking about it, he was completely focused on the scene. Minutes passed and nothing seemed to happen.<br />
&quot;Is not working...&quot; The lady scientist said. &quot;Maybe we need to abo-&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; The scientist near to the guy said. &quot;I see something.&quot;<br />
And he was right. Slowly and almost imperceptible, the guy&#39;s belly began to deflate but none baby was coming from him. Actually, his belly deflated completely but nothing else appeared to happen.<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; The lady scientist said. &quot;Did he lose the child?&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; The scientist near the guy said as he looked around him looking for some clues. &quot;Wait! I found it!&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!!&quot; The lady yelled almost irritated.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s inside his testicles! They&#39;re twins!&quot; He shouted.<br />
&quot;Wonderful!&quot; She said pleasantly. &quot;Then, continue.&quot;<br />
&quot;Please, give birth.&quot; The scientist repeated again.<br />
Now, the guy&#39;s body responded as he began to shiver like if some kind of internal process was going on inside him. Finally, it was his penis which adapted in order to obey.<br />
First, it turned rigid, a solid erection that pointed to the blue light above it. The penis looked like some kind of weird hydrant with a gigantic purple mushroom head on top. Then, that mushroom began to open like a machine until a big hole appeared, enough big to introduce Mark&#39;s head inside. At the end, and with some labor pain, two bodies came out from the weirdest possible way. They were caught by the scientists who almost immediately put them on two cribs.<br />
The gigantic penis hole closed and it turned soft again.<br />
&quot;Tell me! How are the babies?!&quot; The lady scientist said.<br />
&quot;They are alive.&quot; A scientist said. &quot;And they both are male.&quot;<br />
&quot;Perfect!&quot; She shouted very happy. &quot;Finally we can move to phase 6!&quot;<br />
&quot;Understood!&quot; The scientist near the machine said. &quot;Phase 6: Gender.&quot;<br />
An indigo light covered the new father but apparently nothing happened.<br />
&quot;Now he&#39;s completely male too.&quot; The scientist said. &quot;The readings says there isn&#39;t any trace of femininity on him, physical nor biological.&quot;<br />
&quot;Excelent.&quot; The lady scientist said. &quot;And now, turn to phase 7 and return him to nature.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; The scientist said. &quot;Final phase. Phase 7: Animal.&quot;<br />
Th guy&#39;s body was covered by a last purple light which immediately began to make him to grow fur. Golden fur covered quickly his body, face and limbs. Then, his arms and legs began to turn into paws followed by his hands and feet whose fingers and toes shrank accordingly.<br />
After some seconds a tail popped from behind him and grew long with a furry end. His face had already changed into an animalistic one, with a short muzzle and sharp teeth. His ears changed too and, even if they were closed, his eyes for sure also changed.<br />
Finally, as his body, bones and muscles reorganized themselves, a long mane grew around his head and a second later a huge lion was where before was a regular guy.<br />
&quot;Do we need to keep his genitals as human?&quot; The scientist with the machine asked.<br />
&quot;No, he had fulfilled all his use.&quot; The lady scientist said. &quot;Isn&#39;t it right, Kevin?&quot;<br />
&quot;Kevin!&quot; Mark shouted so loudly that everybody should have heard. He couldn&#39;t believe it, that young man who went to all those changes can&#39;t be his friend Kevin. Since the beggining he was way older than Kev. He couldn&#39;t believe it, he didn&#39;t want to.<br />
&quot;There&#39;s an intruder!&quot; The lady said. &quot;Go for him!&quot;<br />
Before he could react, Mark was surrounded by dozens of guards who easily caught him and bring him inside of the white lab.<br />
&quot;Welcome, my dear.&quot; The lady scientist said as she closed to him. &quot;I guess the boy you saw was your friend, isn&#39;t it? You can say hi to him.&quot;<br />
She ordered the guards to put him near to the lion who was once his friend Kevin. He was licking his abnormally huge human genitals as they slowly turned into also abnormally huge lion ones. The sheath that he now had, revealed a red and barbed penis who he kept licking with his now long tongue.<br />
&quot;Kev! Kev!!&quot; Mark yelled to him, but the animal didn&#39;t react. &quot;Turn him back now!!&quot;<br />
&quot;Sorry, kid. But that&#39;s not our plan.&quot; The lady said. &quot;In fact, we would be pleased if you join him instead.&quot; She smiled wickedly &quot;Prepare the lab! We are going to have a second test right now!&quot;</p>
