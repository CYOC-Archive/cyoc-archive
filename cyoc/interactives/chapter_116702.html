<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John (you) walked towards the bar and asked for whiskey. He sat down beside another man who was fitting every stereotype of depression: head slumped over, disheveled appearance, several empty glasses in front of him. The only thing odd about him is how broad he was. His shoudlers proudly met the sides of the chair and continued past it. He seemed like a gym junkie, but the dark suit he wore suggested otherwise. While the bartender is getting John a drink, he nudges the stranger, and softly tells him, &quot;Hey, things always get better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Live my life, kid, and try telling me that again,&quot; he replied. The bartender puts down John&#39;s drink and puts a &quot;don&#39;t start anything&quot; sort of look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mind if I ask what happened that&#39;s making you so pessimistic?&quot; John asks.<br />
&quot;I doubt that any story I tell is believable,&quot; the stranger said.<br />
John covered his eyes and said, &quot;I&#39;m all ears.&quot;<br />
<br />
The stranger quietly slipped something into John&#39;s whiskey and began to explain, &quot;My name is David. I was brought to life by a thought and however hard I try, I cannot die. I have lived for more than 500 years, I have &#39;abilities&#39; people only dream of, and all my life&#39;s defining moments were tragedies.&quot;<br />
<br />
John turned back, and believing this was a faux story to impress him, followed along.<br />
&quot;How could you have been brought to life by a thought? Are you really immortal? What powers do you have?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can feel pain, as if my entire body were being severed limb from limb relentlessly, but I am prevented from completely dying. My &#39;creator&#39; was believed to possess magic during the plague some centuries ago. Rather than aid the sick, she created me as some kind of joke. That girl died right after I was &#39;born.&#39; I think it would have been her that could kill me, but she&#39;s dead. So I&#39;m stuck here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, great monologue, but I think if you want to turn this into a proper story or a film, you need conflict!&quot; John said. &quot;This all sounds so predictable too! Boohoo, I can&#39;t die and I want to, now I&#39;ll find somebody and they&#39;ll fix me and we&#39;ll fall in love and at the end I will manage to die woth my love. Give me a fucking break, you can&#39;t act like this is the reason for your depression!&quot; John slammed his glass down, never realizing he had finished the drink long before he started his speech.<br />
<br />
David stood up and grabbed John. He was much larger in his full physique, and John began to feel groggy as his eyes closed and he slumped over into David.<br />
&quot;You forgot to ask about my abilities,&quot; David whispered into John&#39;s ear. He threw John over his shoulder and walked through the kitchen door of the bar.<br />
<br />
John could not open his eyes, but he heard the sounds of a kitchen, followed by the freezer opening and wind blowing. There&#39;s no wind in a freezer, how could he feel it? He was thrown on the floor next to what he assumed was a fire, where he properly fell asleep.<br />
<br />
John considered himself straight, but he did know when to admire a man or to acknowledge the beauty of a man. Opening his eyes, John was chained to a wall by his wrists. He was in a small box room, an animal rug lay in the middle with a kitchenette and table on the other side of the room. There were doors on his left and right, one of them seemingly a bedroom or the bathroom and the other the front door. There was a fireplace in John&#39;s wall towards his left. John heard the sink running and quickly acted like he was sleeping. He squinted his eyes so that he could get a sense of what was happening.<br />
<br />
David stepped out of the bedroom completely naked. &quot;Fuckin dead as a door nail,&quot; he muttered, referring to John. <br />
<br />
When David turned around, John opened his eyes. He had never seen a sexier person in his life. Now that he could really see David, he had to admire his darker skin and body. He was roughly 6&#39;5&quot; and nearly 3&#39; across. His face had a shadow if facial hair with a low cut hairstyle on top. His eyes were a dark green and his neck was well built. David&#39;s arms hung down to his hips and his muscles were well defined, curving in such a perfect way that began to turn on John. His pecs were sharply built, casting a shadow over his abs. John couldn&#39;t find the words to describe it, but David&#39;s nipples were so amazingly sized on his body. David was carrying a well defined set of abs that created a V on his torso. As John continued down David&#39;s body, he was overwhelmed with lust after seeing David&#39;s massive cock. His balls hung almost halfway down his thighs, which by themselves looked as big as barrels. David&#39;s cock, however, was hanging just as low as his balls, but David was only soft. Even in that state, it was as thick as a soda can and darker than the rest of his body. He had a thick bubble butt that would make straight men swoon over. David&#39;s legs were sculpted to that of an Olympic runner, and his feet were incredibly large. What was really turning on John on top of all of this was the hair! David&#39;s arms and legs were dusted with hair. His torso and ass had dark curly hairs spread among his muscles deeply, but not enough to smother the real beauty. In John&#39;s eyes, David was the perfect human being.<br />
<br />
Even though David was moving around the room, he could still see John&#39;s cock turn hard.<br />
&quot;You like what you see?&quot; David said coyly.<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you gonna do to me,&quot; John asked.<br />
&quot;Like I said John, I have abilities. We&#39;re currently somewhere between Russian and Mongol territory. The disease I mentioned earlier actually originated around here. It only became an epidemic after it spread to Europe. I wasn&#39;t always this way. Another man passed these powers onto me, continuing a centuries old cycle. I&#39;m ready to die, so I&#39;ve decided to pass these powers to you. It&#39;s painful, it&#39;s long, and it is a curse. You might see the bright side at first, but these lives always end in tragedy.&quot;<br />
<br />
David was on the other side of the room, but John&#39;s chains unlocked and John was somehow forced onto the animal rug in the middle. He struggled, but could not move. John&#39;s clothes disappeared, leaving his fare skinned body open to nature. He was modestly above average in almost all areas on his body. Nothing stood out about him, but David looked at John as if he were a god amongst men. <br />
<br />
David&#39;s cock began to grow. Hard, his cock had to be over a foot long, and it slowly grew thicker as well. John&#39;s ass was forced open, and as David began to push only the head in, John was already in pain. As John&#39;s ass was further pulled apart, David&#39;s cock grew harder and pushed further into John. As he finally accepted David, he began to tear up. David&#39;s cock began to push all the way into John until the base of the cock of inside John. Somehow, it still felt like David&#39;s cock was still growing. John managed to open his eyes and clear his vision when he could see David was changing. Hos muscles started to balloon outwards and his skin was turning red. His veins popped out on his head and it looked like he was sweating. John was in a severe bout of pain, and when he looked down he could see his own stomach bulging out slightly with David&#39;s cock. David&#39;s balls began to swell too, pushing into John&#39;s legs while John was already trying to take in more and more of David&#39;s cock. David&#39;s thrusting grew faster until finally David leaned over onto John.<br />
&quot;When I&#39;m done, I will die and you will take my curse. My powers will be revealed over time, but for an example,&quot; David trailed off. John&#39;s mouth was forced wide open and he was constrained to the floor. David pulled out his horse cock, which really did grow to nearly double the length and thickness. His muscles were pulsing and enormous and his balls were pulling down to his knees, bigger than his fist. David&#39;s cock pointed down into John&#39;s mouth and released wave after wave of cum. It went straight down John&#39;s throat and he could almost feel it throughout his entire body. As David poured out into John, he began to shrink. <br />
<br />
Eventually, David fell onto John, but he had shrunk to the size of a midget and kept going until he fell straight into John and disappeared completely. John passed out on the floor, but his body had started to stir...</p>
