<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">... adults. Not just any adults however, but new family members to Mary and Mr. Jameston. <br />
<br />
Jake looked down and his jaw dropped. He was standing up again, taller than before, but that was not what grabbed his attention. On his chest were two absolutely massive boobs, sprouting up from some kids of maternity dress. He could tell that, because below the boobs was a fat stomach, sticking out only in a way that a pregnant woman would have it. Dark brown, curly hair fell into his eyes, and he felt like throwing up, covering his mouth in time with his tiny, manicured hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh, are you feeling icky Auntie Jane?&quot; Mary sweetly asked.<br />
<br />
Jake wanted to respond with a &quot;No shit I&#39;m not!&quot; but sadly if he moved his hand he thought he was gonna barf. He wondered if this is really how pregnant women felt. He figured once he got the camera back he&#39;d have to apologize to his Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s fine... kiddo.&quot; Jake heard a burly voice say as two massive hands came to rest on his shoulders. &quot;Auntie Jane just needs to rest for a minute. Why don&#39;t you run along to your daddy ok?&quot; The voice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Mary said sadly before running off.<br />
<br />
Jake looked up to see a strong, rugged, blonde man. At first, he wondered who it was, until a closer look at the face gave it away. Jake quickly swallowed whatever was coming up and gasped.<br />
&quot;Holy shit, Mark is that you?&quot; He asked while cringing at how feminine his voice sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Yeah it&#39;s me.&quot; He chuckled slightly. &quot;Jake, we&#39;re back.&quot; He smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the Hell do you mean?&quot; Jake protested, standing up straight again. &quot;You think this is back?&quot; He said cupping his huge boobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I meant we&#39;re human again!&quot; Mark celebrated &quot;I thought I was gonna go mad! Just standing there on a shelf for... for, I don&#39;t even know how long!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I think it was about two weeks.&quot; Jake speculated. &quot;But it&#39;s hard to say. Doing nothing for so long and standing in one spot really makes you lose perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why I&#39;m happy to be human.&quot; Mark added. <br />
<br />
&quot;But, we&#39;re not normal.&quot; Jake interrupted. &quot;You&#39;ve lost decades of life and I&#39;m gonna be a freaking mother!&quot; He angrily emphasized his massive stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap, I don&#39;t wanna have to go to work and get a job and help raise some snot rag.&quot; Mark sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously, which is why we have to get the... camera. Mark. Why didn&#39;t you grab the camera when Mary was holding it?&quot; Jake asked, suddenly annoyed more than before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well... good, uh, good question.&quot; Mark nervously chuckled. &quot;I, umm, forgot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mark!&quot; Jake sneered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Jake! It was just, I was so happy to be alive again it didn&#39;t really cross my mind! I just wanted Mary out of the room so I could talk again!&quot; He defended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, fine.&quot; Jake sighed. &quot;So now we need to find away to not only get the camera, not only turn ourselves back, but also turn every one of our classmates back too.&quot; He said angrily, pointing at the wall of dolls and other toys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, these are our classmates aren&#39;t they!&quot; Mark laughed. &quot;Look, I bet this is Tyrone!&quot; He said, picking up a doll.<br />
<br />
Tyrone was a tall, Black football star who was entering puberty way earlier than everyone else. He definitely always swung his weight around and made sure every guy knew just how tall he was. The doll Mark held was a little black girl doll with a goofy afro, hoop earrings and a shiny disco outfit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, he&#39;s called &quot;Tina&quot; now and the era he&#39;s from is the seventies.&quot; Mark chuckled. &quot;Not so tall now are you&quot; Mark smirked as he placed Tyrone back on the shelf. Mark&#39;s smile faded slightly. &quot;Yeah Jake, I guess we do gotta turn them back. Even if they&#39;re not aware, I know just how sucky being a doll can be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I&#39;m not saying we spend weeks trying to fix every single person, all I&#39;m saying is we get them to at least be human and then fix ourselves.&quot; Jake explained. &quot;Speaking of which, who the heck is this?&quot; Jake asked, pointing at his stomach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my gosh, look!&quot; Mark pointed at the nightstand where they had been left. The only toy which remained was the GI Joe doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... you mean the Ken doll...&quot; Jake quietly guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, so it can turn things that were originally toys into people too!&quot; Mark gasped. &quot;This thing is crazy powerful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mark, here&#39;s the plan.&quot; Jake interrupted. &quot;We walk out there, act like everything is okie dokie, and just chat about nonsense for a bit. We wait until Mary isn&#39;t paying to much attention or puts down the camera or something, and then we grab it, transform her and Mr. Jameston.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t we just grab it from her?&quot; Mark asked. &quot;I mean, look at these guns!&quot; He laughed, flexing his thick arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Mark, as long as the camera is in someone else&#39;s hand it&#39;s dangerous. Even if you&#39;re strong, all she has to do is lightly tap a button and suddenly you become a baby, or a slinky or a toilet or something and then we&#39;re screwed!&quot; He explained. &quot;If we change them, then we are the only adults in the house, and then we can take as much time as we need fixing everything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I guess that makes sense.&quot; Mark grumpily sighed. &quot;But if things are going wrong plan b has to be muscle!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine Mark.&quot; Jake sighed. &quot;Now, time to pretend like we&#39;re a loving couple.&quot; Jake groaned, offering his arm to Mark to interlock and walk out looking happy.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there you two are!&quot; Mr. Jameston smiled at them. &quot;I was getting worried after what Mary told me about you feeling sick sis.&quot; He gently whispered.<br />
<br />
Jake was grossed out that he was his least favorite teacher&#39;s sister, but forced himself to play along.<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry... bro.&quot; She laughed, forgetting Mr. Jameston&#39;s real name. &quot;I&#39;m totally fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure Jane? You&#39;re not feeling like you&#39;re going into labor or anything do you?&quot; He asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! No. No definitely not.&quot; Jake nervously replied, not even wanting to think about the idea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Sarah can fill you in on anything you need to know for your first time. She&#39;s already had one kid... and don&#39;t tell Mary, but we&#39;re thinking about trying for another.&quot; He whispered to the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, congrats Mr. Jameston!&quot; Mark chimed in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please Mark you&#39;re married to my little sister, you&#39;re practically family, just call me Ty.&quot; He laughed, walking towards the kitchen table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, good work his name is Tyler.&quot; Jake whispered to Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna suck ass.&quot; Mark whispered back. &quot;And where&#39;s this wife he has that we&#39;ll have to deal with now? And where the hell is Mary with the camera?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you just play it cool for now.&quot; Jake quietly growled as the two approached the table and sat down. <br />
<br />
The next few minutes felt like an hour for Mark and Jake as the three talked about nothing. First it was politics, then the weather, then some old memories which Jake had to bluff through about how Tyler used to pick on Jane as children. Finally, their patience paid off. Mary walked cheerily into the room, holding the big polaroid camera loosely in hand.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s eyes shot wide. &quot;Hey Tyler.&quot; Jake asked. &quot;Is that your camera.&quot; He questioned, trying not to seem too suspicious.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so.&quot; He replied. &quot;Mary come over please!&quot; He called, as she began to happily walk to her dad. &quot;I found it in the attic I think... in a box of our old stuff actually Jane! Why, do you remember it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES! Ahem, I mean yes! Yes it&#39;s definitely mine. One of my favorites, can I have it back?&quot; He asked, poorly hiding his urge to get it back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course sis!&quot; Tyler laughed. &quot;Mary honey, can Auntie Jane have her camera back?&quot; He asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! It&#39;s mine daddy!&quot; She whined.<br />
<br />
Jake saw Mark starting to stand up in his seat, and he had to give him a quick kick and a glare to sit back down and wait. Mark reluctantly agreed and sat back down as Mary pouted at her father.<br />
&quot;Now Mary Elenor Jameston, you listen to your father. That isn&#39;t yours it&#39;s Auntie Jane&#39;s. You wouldn&#39;t;t want her to feel bad would you?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Mary sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl.&quot; He said, giving her a pat on the head. &quot;Now, go hand it back to her. Maybe even if you&#39;re nice, she may let you use it still.&quot; He suggested.<br />
<br />
Mary trudged over with a solemn expression on her face. She clearly was not happy with the decision, and judging from some crunched photos in her pocket, she had been using it. Jake&#39;s eyes went wide. Had Mary changed some people?! Or, had she transformed some objects?! Was that where Sarah came from?! Did Mr. Jameston even have a wife? Did he even have a daughter before the class picture?! Jakes mind raced, and so much so that he didn&#39;t notice Mary place the camera in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weight, so can I have it?&quot; She perked up upon Jake not immediately taking it. Jake snapped back and realized what was going on, and panicked. &quot;No!&quot; He yelled, and in doing so both tugged on the camera, causing it to drop and slide across the floor slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh!&quot; Mary said, rushing for the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Mark now!&quot; Jake yelled, trying to move as quick as he could with his pregnant belly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t strain yourself sis I got it!&quot; Tyler said also rushing for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it!&quot; Mark tried to claim, rushing for it as fast as he could.<br />
<br />
They all awkwardly tugged on it, but ultimately it ended up in the hands of whoever grabbed it first, and a large FLASH occurred, leaving only Mark and Jake aware of reality&#39;s newest change.</p>
