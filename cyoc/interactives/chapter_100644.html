<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE: The current Jenny/Harry sequence was originally conceived and written as just 1 episode, but would have been too big a post to present as is. Otherwise, the story continues...}}<br />
<br />
Jenny cradled her fiance&#39;s head in her lap. &quot;Was it really that bad? Other than our wonderful night together in the hospital safe room, I don&#39;t remember much except being driven crazy with lust and need for that damn Yvette.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m no doctor,&quot; began Harry, as he looked up at the woman he loved and tried to dry his eyes with the back of a furry paw, &quot;but they were starting to get worried about your vital signs slipping and you lapsing into a coma. Being a were now, physically you would of and did bounce back once you were completed by the rogue, but everyone was also starting to get worried about your mental state, because there was no way of knowing the consequences from such a delayed completion.&quot;<br />
&quot;Doctor Twist called it Post Transformation Stress Disorder, but we&#39;ve got to face facts here. I had some problems even before becoming a were.&quot;<br />
&quot;Your folks and their &#39;shining knight&#39; Dieter Wilhelm I presume,&quot; replied Harry, looking at his fiance more closely now.<br />
&quot;Yeah. The old me would never have been able to face any of them for long. I might of tried to stand my ground, but in the end I always would have caved in and gone along with whatever they wanted, no matter how wrong they were or how I felt,&quot; conceded Jenny.<br />
&quot;And now...&quot;<br />
Jenny paused. Harry could tell she was staring off at something, but couldn&#39;t hazard a guess as to what.<br />
<br />
&quot;The old me, at least physically, is gone,&quot; realized Jenny. &quot;Granted, there wasn&#39;t really anything wrong with that aspect of my life. My figure may have been waif-ish compared to even the average/normal human woman, but it was all natural. No fad or crash dieting involved.&quot; Then Jennifer Harper stood up and started taking off all of her clothes.<br />
Harry Jenkins couldn&#39;t help but smile as the nude and nubile body of his fiance emerged. His fox tail started wagging while his vulpine penis hardened and came out of its sheath as Jenny walked over and started to admire herself in front of the mirror attached to the closet door of Harry&#39;s bedroom.<br />
She fluffed her now longer blonde hair as she turned this way and that, studying the new curves of her body in greater detail before cradling her more bountiful bosom. Then Jenny released her breasts, turned back to face Harry and said, &quot;I&#39;ve fully embraced the werevixen side of my new life, and part of me wants nothing more than to grab you by the paw, run off into the woods and never be seen again while we raise a big brood of kits together. But then I&#39;d just be trying to escape once more and that would do neither of us any good.&quot;<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; asked Harry, as he came over and embraced her in his furry arms.<br />
<br />
The sensation of silky fox fur against her bare human skin sent shivers of pure pleasure throughout Jenny&#39;s body even as it raised goosebumps on her flesh.<br />
&quot;You feel so wonderful against me this way, and you feel even more wonderful as my loving fox against his very appreciative vixen,&quot; said Jenny, as human lips met fox muzzle. Then she broke the kiss, stared directly into his eyes, and said, &quot;but all my problems are from my human side, and that&#39;s how I have to face and deal with them. As much as I love our were side, tonight what I really need is for you to make love to me as we once did, as plain simple humans, so I can fully appreciate this part of my new life as much as I do our furness.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry remained silent as he willed himself back. The fox seemed kind of disappointed, yet knew he would still be with his mate and sensed she needed this as part of her road to recovery to be fully well again.<br />
A naked human male embraced and kissed his equally naked fiance as her breasts pressed against his chest, their hard nipples rubbing against his body hair. Harry&#39;s heightened fox senses smelled Jenny&#39;s increasing rate of arousal, but he kept a tight mental leash on his were side as Harry ran his fingers through Jenny&#39;s blonde hair and teased her ears while he started kissing his way past her lips, across her chin, and down her neck.<br />
Soon he had worked his way through the valley of her cleavage and was suckling a breast even as Harry held Jenny in his arms and led her to the bed.<br />
Jenny felt their final destination behind her, but didn&#39;t move as she reached out to caress and run her fingers across every part of Harry&#39;s body that she could reach. Harry meanwhile had switched his oral attention to the other breast, even as he started massaging and teasing the nipple of the tit he had already pleasured.<br />
Eventually he (very reluctantly) left her bosom and started kissing his way down her belly, only pausing long enough to tenderly kiss her navel.<br />
Soon Harry&#39;s lips were at the outer edge of the blonde patch of hair that hovered over the entrance to her sacred den.<br />
A cruder man might have made some crass comment about how the curtains naturally matched the drapes, but Harry didn&#39;t care. All he wanted to do was run his tongue through Jenny&#39;s outer labia, tease open her vagina&#39;s inner lips, and then drink deeply from her depths even as he exposed and pleasured her clit.<br />
<br />
Jenny started moaning to express her pleasure even as she sat on the bed and draped her legs over Harry&#39;s shoulders, allowing him even greater access to her inner recesses than he already had. She was getting wetter and more excited by the second, but begged the vixen to stay silent as Harry continued to lap at her cunt.<br />
Her foxiness sensed the importance of this moment and so didn&#39;t appear, but couldn&#39;t help yelping in pleasure within the back of Jenny&#39;s mind as she came, and came, and came; for Harry refused to stop licking her until long after his thirst was actually sated.<br />
Then Harry stood, his hard cock rising into view even as he started teasing the tip of the head around the outer boundary of Jenny&#39;s leaking vagina.<br />
She wiggled her ass and used her tongue to lick her mouth in anticipation as Harry took a step forward and slowly sank his penis into her moist cunt.<br />
<br />
The fox wanted to secure his topknot deep within his mate and continue rutting until both could no longer move, exhausted from experiencing so much pleasure together.<br />
Instead, Harry slowly started sliding in and out of Jenny, establishing a gentle rhythm even as he leaned forward, cupped her breasts within his hands and started kissing her again.<br />
They both began moaning and groaning in unison as Jenny locked her legs around Harry&#39;s ass and motioned him to start fucking her faster.<br />
Bracing his feet against the bedroom carpeting the best he could, Harry eagerly complied with his fiance&#39;s request, their tongues dancing back and forth between each other&#39;s mouths even as he continued plunging further into Jenny&#39;s sexual recesses, his penis barely starting to come out before he rammed it back into her once more.<br />
He gave up his hold on Jenny&#39;s breasts to wrap his arms around her even as Jenny embraced Harry within hers, each trying to pull the other tighter to them in order to be even closer together as both suddenly saw nothing but a great white light within their minds as they experienced a wonderful, mutual orgasm together.<br />
<br />
Basically on autopilot, Harry continued his leg motions as the couple experienced the pleasurable after shock of several mini orgasms together.<br />
Just about spent, it was all Harry could do to maneuver them until both man and woman were completely on the bed, but still holding each other close even as his hard penis flexed within her pussy, still longing to continue exploring the tight tunnel it found itself in.<br />
Greatly satisfied, they parted the sweat matted hair from each other&#39;s foreheads.<br />
&quot;Thank you my wonderful mate,&quot; said Jenny with a huge smile on her face, before she fell asleep in Harry&#39;s arms.</p>
