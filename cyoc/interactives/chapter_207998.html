<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harpinder stared into Gurpreet’s eyes.<br />
<br />
There was no compulsion telling him he must say yes. If he wanted, he felt he could simply leave.  But at the same time…he’d never really had a choice during this whole time as a Sikh. Gurpreet was a rather handsome bear, that was true, but he was also kind and caring and conscientious. If Harpinder had a best friend in college…well, it would be Gurpreet. No matter what form he took, the big bear was always there.<br />
<br />
“I’d love to.” Harpinder said, and meant it.<br />
<br />
The fat bear smiled widely and gave Harpinder’s hand a gentle squeeze. Harpinder smiled back, feeling happy for the first time in a while. Class let out and they walked together back to Gurpreet’s apartment across the street form the campus.<br />
<br />
“I am so glad you said yes.” Gurpreet said as they got in the elevator to the small student apartment tower. “It would have been so embarrassing if I had been wrong.”<br />
<br />
“No, Gurpreet.” Harpinder replied, rubbing the big Sikh&#39;s broad back. “I’ve just been very confused about things for a while now. I’m glad I chose you.”<br />
<br />
They embraced and Harpinder enjoyed how soft the larger man was. Gurpreet squeezed him and then kissed him. A she enjoyed the roughness of the man’s beard the elevator door dinged open. Gurpreet took Harpinder’s hand as they went to his room. A flash of a keycard and Harpinder finally saw the big bear’s apartment.<br />
<br />
It was clean and smelled of cooking. The kitchen was just past the bathroom and closet when they walked in. All kinds of kitchen appliances were there. Clearly Gurpreet took cooking seriously. A paint can was on the tiled counter, a bit of newspaper spread underneath it. Gurpreet waddled over to it and closed the lid.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I have been doing renovations.” Gurpreet opened a window to let out the paint smell.<br />
<br />
“I like the color.” Harpinder said, admiring the eggshell white paint.<br />
<br />
“It was this horrible off-yellow color before.” Gurpreet put the paint can away. “Drink?”<br />
<br />
“Please.” Harpinder smiled and walked over to the counter.<br />
<br />
Gurpreet poured a glass of iced tea and handed it to Harpinder. “Here, give it a taste.”<br />
<br />
“Is it special?” Harpinder sniffed it but could smell only floral tea.<br />
<br />
He took a sip and smacked his lips at the taste. Spicy yet floral but with the same black tea notes he was used to. Harpinder looked up at the chubby man questioningly.<br />
<br />
“Masala tea.” Gurpreet smiled.<br />
<br />
Grinning, Harpinder tossed his head back and drained the tea in one quick swallow. The back of his head bumped the cupboard behind him. He pulled away, the fabric making an odd sticky sound as it peeled off the cupboard. <br />
<br />
“Ah, Harpinder!” Gurpreet’s eyes widened.<br />
<br />
Harpinder reached back and touched his turban. When he brought his fingers back, they were covered in wet paint. Oh no, he’d forgotten the bear had painted the cupboards!<br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry, Gurpreet!” Harpinder said, “I didn’t mean to screw up the paint job!”<br />
<br />
“You’ve got paint all over your turban!” Gurpreet exclaimed. “Give it to me, I’ll wash it.”<br />
<br />
“But-”<br />
<br />
Gurpreet quickly unwound the cloth, his big belly, pressing against him, making Harpinder blush. The big bear noticed and smiled. He pressed forward a bit more, and Harpinder moaned, rubbing the big bear’s body.<br />
<br />
“You can borrow one of mine.” Gurpreet smirked and backed off, then hurried to his room. <br />
<br />
He came back with a strip of black cloth and tossed it to Harpinder. He caught the cloth and paused, looking at the smiling Sikh bear in front of him. Again, he was faced with a choice.<br />
<br />
“Gurpreet, what do you want in your perfect man?” Harpinder asked.<br />
<br />
“A man who loves cooking and me in equal measure. I want you, Harpinder, though I wish you had a bit more meat on your bones.” Gurpreet winked. “But if you stay with me long enough, I don’t think that will be an issue.”<br />
<br />
Harpinder smiled and intentionally placed the cloth on his head. <br />
<br />
A warm wave of heat enveloped him as the cloth wrapped itself perfectly on his head. He felt bloated but comfortable as the flesh of his stomach rose like soft dough. It started slow, but the feeling of fullness and comfort became overwhelming as his flesh began to expand at an exponential rate. Soon his belly was a huge beachball of fat that hung far over his waist band. Two large lovehandles wrapped around his sides to an ever-expanding posterior. His ass wobbled as it swelled behind him like a counterweight. His breasts expanded into huge, pillowy moobs that flopped softly onto his gut and wrapped around his torso. Harpinder’s face puffed with fat, a huge doublechin welling into existence as his face rounded out. In a series of pleasant pops, Harpinder grew taller, wearing his weight rather well, everything tight and swollen with little sag.<br />
<br />
As before, his clothes re-sized to fit his form. Harpinder’s jeans were stretched tight by his thick thighs and the two globes in his rear. His shirt managed to stay loose despite his round belly hanging far in front of him. His tight, straining shirt grew too an XXXXL size, barely fitting him. The plain shirt gained a graphic of angry cow, with the pun &quot;Fitteh Moo!” next to it. Harpinder’s mustache thickened, his beard grew thicker, wider than his face in a round shape and stretching below his neck. Itching heralded the growth of body hair all across his blubbery form. Finally, a pair of clear prescription aviator glasses appeared in front of Harvey&#39;s eyes, completing the transformation.<br />
<br />
He stood at equal height with big Sikh bear and much fatter around. The new, massive Harpinder winced as a tattoo of a bear paw needled itself into his upper arm. He touched it gingerly as the ink faded, as though it had been there for years. The raw stretch marks covering his bloated body faded as well.<br />
<br />
“You look good, <I>richa</I>.” Gurpreet waddled forward and placed a warm hand on  Haprinder’s lovehandle and jiggled it. “Will you cook for me, <I>sudara</I>?”<br />
<br />
“Of course.” Harpinder said, unable to stop smiling.<br />
<br />
His heart was beating so hard in his chest and butterflies were flitting in his stomach as he leaned in and kissed the handsome Sikh. They fondled each other for a minute until the time on the stove went off.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get it.” Harpinder smiled and walked to the stove. <br />
<br />
Sauces were boiling and cooking. As though on autopilot, Harpinder easily stirred and mized and tasted all the dishes. Harpinder felt  a massive, soft belly squish against his back and something hard and warm press between his massive cheeks. He. A hand covered his as he stirred the pot and he felt Gurpreet’s beard on his neck.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, I love watching you cook.” Gurpreet nuzzled Harpinder’s thick neck, prickling him with his beard. He wrapped one of his chubby arms around the small of Harpinder’s back and squeezed his love handle on the other side. <br />
<br />
“I love...” Harpinder blushed. “…Cooking for you.”<br />
<br />
Gurpreet turned him around gently and they kissed, beards rubbing against each other. The big bear pressed his gut close, smooshing their bellies together. Harpinder founding himself exploring the fat bear’s flab, how soft it was, pressing his huge body against his own fat gut, one of Gurpreet’s hands landing on his wide ass. His erection strained his jeans as his own hands roamed over Gurpreet’s curves.<br />
<br />
“Looks like it’s done.” Gurpreet broke the kiss, staring at the bubbling sauce and breathing hard. “Wanna eat?”<br />
<br />
Harpinder nodded, trying to catch his breath, his cock aching. He dutifully served his…boyfriend? Lunch and sat down. They ate, talking happily, Gurpreet playing with Harpinder’s feet under the table. Harpinder smiled and laid a hand on the big sikh bear, admiring how handsome he was.<br />
<br />
“Ah, I am so full!” Gurpreet rubbed his belly lazily and got up, stretching. “Thank you for the food, Harpinder.”<br />
<br />
“Anytime, <I>sudara</I>.” Harpinder got up and put the plates away, washing them in the sink.<br />
<br />
A warm, pudgy brown hand caught his as he finished the dishes. Harpinder looked behind him.<br />
<br />
“You do not need to do that. Come to bed with me.” Gurpreet squeezed his hand gently. “Come.”<br />
<br />
Harpinder’s heart fluttered and he let the big Sikh bear lead him into a very clean bedroom. The smell of Gurpreet’s spicy cologne lingered in the air. The big man removed his clothes-and his turban. He gestured for Harpinder to do the same. <br />
<br />
Harpinder took a wavering breath. If he took off his turban…he would change back into Harvey. And that wouldn’t be fun. He knew Harvey was likely straight and certainly not Gurpreet’s type. But the big bear smiled kindly and sat down on the bed, only his kerchera between Harpinder and the lovely cock that awaited him.<br />
<br />
“Please, my handsome bear,” Gurpreet simply gestured between his legs.<br />
<br />
Harpinder fell to his knees with a loud thud. His body wobbled and he slowly crawled forward. Gurpreet slid his wide body forward and spread his thick thighs. Harpinder leaned forward, the heavy, oppressive heat of the big Sikh’s crotch on all sides of him. He gulped and rubbed Grupreet’s furry underbelly. His own pudgy brown fingers pressed into the bear’s hot chub and sunk into the flab. With his other hand, he slowly untied the kerchera as though unwrapping a present.<br />
<br />
It came loose, and a big roll of hairy, heavy fat spilled out. A good five inches of thick, hard dick breached the fatpad, ready for him to suck. Below, Gurpreet’s balls drooped low and heavy: two heavy handfuls of masculinity. A thick musk accompanied them, sweaty yet alluring. Harpinder’s mouth watered as he watched the cock throb as he rolled Gurpreet’s heavy orbs in his hands.<br />
<br />
Harpinder rubbed his face against Gurpreet’s balls, taking in more of his musk. His tongue went to work, licking up the sweat from between the Sikh’s thighs and up his sack before finally letting his lips wrap around the fat Sikh’s big shaft.<br />
<br />
Gurpreet moaned and panted, leaning back.<br />
<br />
Harpinder bobbed up and down on Gurpreet’s cock, burying his beard into the big Sikh’s fatpad and then pressing his face deeper, trying to take it to the root. He fetl so hot with Gurpreet&#39;s big cock in his mouth. Harpinder found himself salivating, lubricating the dick, thinking about all the cum he would get to swallow as a reward.<br />
<br />
The bear didn’t last long, groaning as his heavy balls contracted hard in Harpinder’s grip. Harpinder felt a splash of cum hit the roof of his mouth and kept slurping and swallowing. There was so much-the big bear must have been so pent-up- that it spilled out of Harpinder’s mouth and dribbled down his chin.<br />
<br />
He panted, face red and hot, before Gurpreet gently coaxed him to his feet. Harpinder’s knees popped and he regretted having knelt. Of course his knees would be bad after carrying so much weight! Something about that thought felt off, but Harpinder dismissed it.<br />
<br />
The two fat, hairy Sikh men cuddled up together on the bed and drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Harpinder awoke in the warm, comforting embrace of Gurpreet, who was fondling Harpinder’s soft belly. Something about that was wrong. The big bear played with Harpinder’s hair and gently turned him over and Harpinder found himself locking lips with him in another long, loving kiss. Gurpreet playing with his hair was just so <I>hot</I>, he couldn’t help…wait, where was his patka? How long had it been off?<br />
<br />
“Gurpreet, I-”<br />
<br />
“Let’s skip International Business class.” Gurpreet murmured in Harpinder’s ear. “Just for today.”<br />
<br />
Before Harpinder could reply, the fat Sikh rolled him over and he felt Gurpreet’s hard member slide between his cheeks and pressed deeply into his sleep-relaxed hole. As it slowly started to spread him open wide, he felt the big Sikh&#39;s heavy gut press down upon him.  <br />
It popped in. Harpinder gasped in pain, but his dick was dripping pre-cum. It hurt, but it felt really fucking good. Gurpreet kept pushing, and the sense of fullness only increased and increased. The big Sikh bear left his cock there for a moment, letting Harpinder get used to it.Gurpreet’s weight was pressed fully against Harpinder’s back. Harpinder had to support himself on his elbows to support all that weight, but it felt so fulfilling he wouldn’t dare complain.<br />
<br />
The big bear fucked him slowly, rolling his hips, and Harpinder surrendered to the feelings. Gurpreet slid a hairy arm around Harpinder’s waist and began fingering his nub of a cock. Harpinder moaned, precum trickling between Gurpreet’s nubby fingers. It all felt so good. He knew he was supposed to be someone else, but it was all so blurry. And every slow rock of Gurpreet’s hips wasn’t helping, his thoughts and fears vanishing as the bear’s large cock pummeled something sensitive inside him.<br />
<br />
“Ah, my lovely <I>richa</I>, you are so perfect!” Gurpreet groaned, buck faster.<br />
<br />
 <I>Richa</I>. It meant bear. Gurpreet fucked him, his pudgy hands sliding across Harpinder’s vast, furry tummy. He was quite the bear, Harpinder supposed, and it filled him with some pride to hear Gurpreet name him so. He growled playfully, wiggling his wide, hairy bottom and pressing back into the thrusts. Whatever was wrong could wait until this handsome man behind him finished.<br />
<br />
“Ah, that is nice, make those sounds for me.” Gurpreet panted.<br />
<br />
“Grrr!” Harpinder snarled, feeling rather silly, but he cold feel Gurpreet’s cock twitch inside his hole. It clearly turned him on. “Fuck this big fat <I>richa</I>, <I>sudara</I>! His belly needs to be full for winter.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmf!” Gurpreet groaned happily, pulled back out and truly started to fuck Harpinder. <br />
<br />
Harpinder’s eyes went wide the first time that he felt the enormous bear slam into his backside…then again, then again. It hurt a lot at first. He steadied his breathing and closed his eyes. And then he focused, first, on the incredibly feeling of all of that weight literally sloshing on top of him. They were both wobbling and sloshing in tandem with each other. Two big fat bears breeding. It was really absolutely incredible. And the longer he focused on that, the more turned on he got. And the more turned on he got, the looser he became. He felt Gurpreet stretch him open over and over again, and that was so hot. He was really getting fucked. <br />
<br />
“Ah! <I>Richa</I>, I…”<br />
<br />
Harpinder growled again and pressed back.<br />
<br />
Gurpreet leaned forward as hard as he could, arching his wide hips and let himself go. His fat dick burst forward with cum. Harpinder gasped loud; it was so intense, he could feel every bit of his wet warmth flood his guts. Each slow pump brought another load of cum. More and more and more.. He had never felt more full in his life. And when the orgasm finally died down and The Sikh bear carefully pulled his dick out, Harpinder could feel the cum drip down onto his balls.<br />
<br />
It was too much for him to take, and with a warbling roar, he came into the bedsheets, the feeling so amazing, better than any orgasm he’d had by hand. He panted and sagged against his own seed, belly wet with it. They panted in the afterglow for a minute before Gurpreet pulled out, sending more warm rivulets of cum running down Harpinder’s thigh, and rolled over onto the bed, sweaty and heaving for breath.<br />
<br />
Harpinder nestled himself into the crook of Gurpreet’s fat, hairy arm and wrapped himself around the fat bear’s gut. They kissed and Harpinder forgot what was bothering him. When they woke up, they decided to go out to eat at a new restaurant. When Harpinder put his hair up in the turban, he had the strangest feeling that it was supposed to wrap itself for him.<br />
<br />
The bear shook his head. What nonsense! The two fat Sikh lovers went out to eat and had a lovely night.</p>
