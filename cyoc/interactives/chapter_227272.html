<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I picked up Larry&#39;s dinner from the bag he&#39;d brought, reheating it in the microwave for him. He&#39;d gotten a few burgers from the fast food joint on the way home. Looking through the bags he brought home, he&#39;d also gotten some hardware stuff for the other tenants&#39; unit, like plumbing and electricity things. I put those aside near the door, since he&#39;d probably drop them in storage later.<br />
<br />
The microwave dinged as Larry called out to me, “how&#39;s the food comin&#39; along, Hole?” My head felt hazy for a moment. “It&#39;s in the oven Larry, that&#39;s a big meal to heat up,” I answered back. The three chicken were just warming up, so I moved around the kitchen to get his protein shake ready. I pulled out the powder from the top shelf in one of the cupboards, feeling the breeze hit my gaping hole as I tip-toed about.<br />
<br />
Mixing everything, I started the blender, pressing the buttons around as the shake took form. A wave of small pins and needles came over my brain as I shivered. My choker&#39;s heavy chain pulled my neck forward as I played with the consistency of the drink. Soon enough it was ready, and I put it in a shaker for later. <br />
<br />
The oven dinged, Larry&#39;s meal now nearly ready. I pulled the chicken out, and plated it for him. As I was removing all the bones, I froze in place for a few seconds, unable to process anything. I picked back up where I was, continuing with the food preparation. “Boi, where the fuck&#39;s my meal?” I heard from the living room. “Your meal is nearly ready Sir,” I politely answered. <br />
<br />
Soon enough, everything was done, and I made my way back. As I stepped into the living room, I held my head down, not wanting to disrespect Sir Larry. “Collar&#39;s lookin&#39; good on you, Daddy likes,” He complimented me. “Th-thank you, Sir,” I meekly let out, blushing as I placed His food on the end table next to Him, my cock throbbing from the praise. He grabbed the chain attached to my collar, and yanked me closer to Him. He grabbed my jaw with a hand, pulling my face in front of His. “Look at me boi,” He ordered as I raised my eyes to meet His. My entire body quivered as His piercing brown eyes looked deep into my soul. He placed my mouth on His, forcing His tongue inside mine. He explored my mouth, making out with me. I gulped, my throat muscles throbbing from the pleasure. His thick tongue forced mine back, reminding me this mouth was His to use as He pleased. <br />
<br />
Pulling out He smiled, “good boi, still tastes like me.” From the corner of my eye I saw His arm move. “Thank you Sir, thank you Daddy,” I blurted out, flustered, “I love you, Daddy.” He licked His lips as the hand gripping my jaw moved to the back of my head. He pushed me down towards His hairy muscle-gut. “I know you do, slut,” He nonchalantly replied. <br />
<br />
A fork hit His plate as I smelled Him, kissing His stocky gut. I heard Him chew, then He talked mid-bite, “whash rule 3, boi?” I kneeled down in front of Him, “my life revolves around Master Larry, Sir.” I swiftly grabbed His calf, and started kissing and licking it. It was taut, rock-solid and hairy, covered in His sweat. I moaned as I serviced it, tasting Him. “You missed Daddy when he was away, didn&#39;t you?” He asked. “Yes, Sir, yes I-” I answered between kisses, “missed you so much, Sir.” <br />
<br />
Being away from Sir Larry for more than a few minutes made me feel like something was missing. He was such an important presence in my life, ever since I moved in with Him. At first I found Him too strict, trying to control when I came home at night and which friends I was seeing. We&#39;d been fuckfriends since I&#39;d visited the place, His cock always ready to plow my mouth or ass. But soon enough, He became a mentor to me, helping me discover more of what I liked and what I didn&#39;t. I liked serving Him breakfast in the morning, His protein shakes when He worked out, taking pictures of myself plowed by His dick. He started adding rules to how I lived in the apartment, like what I wore and who I could have over. He introduced me to His friends, who kept complimenting Him on how good of an influence He was on me. Slowly, Larry became everything my life revolved around, and I was getting rewarded with new sex-toys and friends of His to distract myself with while He was away. <br />
<br />
I was brought back to the present moment by something warm and slick hitting my back. “Good hmmrph boi,” He said between bites. I&#39;d moved to His other calf during my reminiscing, kissing it and licking it like I did the first. Slowly as Master ate His meal, I started worshiping His tree-trunk thighs. They were so massive, muscular from years of supporting Master&#39;s truly sublime manhood, and how much His job made Him work out. The tang of His crotch made its way to my nose, my throat tightening as my hole quivered. <br />
<br />
“Hmmmhhh,” I let out in pleasure. “Slut,” Master yanked my collar&#39;s chain with vigor, having me face Him in an instant. Furrowed brows crowned His eyes, a frown on His face. Tightly holding my chain, He forced a finger into my mouth, all the way to the knuckle. “Fuck you look pathetic,” He growled, smiling, “suck.” I moved my tongue around His thick, calloused finger. He let the chain go, knowing I wouldn&#39;t move, so He could keep eating His meal, loudly chewing as I stared at Him. He chuckled between bites, moving His finger in and out of my mouth. “What&#39;s rule number one?” He asked, looking deep into my eyes.<br />
<br />
“Es-ect Ma-ahr Ah-hee&#39;s ools, Ehr,” I tried to reply. “Good,” He replied dryly. He shoved another finger in my mouth. He took a few more bites of His food, this time keeping both fingers hitting the back of my throat. I sputtered, drooling onto Him, fully into the power He was showcasing. I stayed put for a few minutes spitting out drool while He finished eating. Once His dinner was over, He shook His drink, before downing it in one gulp. He let out a big sigh of relief. “Two, boi,” He spat out. “Oh loes ohr Ole aaoun Ma-ahr Ah-hee, Ehr,” I vocalized, unsure He&#39;d even understand. He leaned forward, His now free hand holding onto my inhumanely wide ass. “Yup, that&#39;s it. I&#39;m here, you&#39;re in your birthday suit,” He said. He took His fingers out of my mouth, grabbing my other buttcheek.<br />
<br />
Daddy squeezed my ass, a high pitched noise escaping me. “Y&#39;already went over three, what&#39;s four?”, He asked, as I placed my hands under His arms. I lowered my face onto His chest, kissing it repeatedly as He kept His grip on my ass. “Always be ready to serve, Sir,” I swiftly said between smooches, “thank you for the pleasure, Daddy.” I kissed and kissed His chest, thanking Him again and again. “Thank you so much Master Larry, thank you for allowing me to touch you, Sir,” I lovingly said as I started kissing His neck, rubbing my face against His thick beard. “Thank you for using me Daddy, I&#39;m yours to use, Master,” I moaned against Him.<br />
<br />
“Good fuckin&#39; boi,” He groaned, letting go of my ass. “Better than a fuckin&#39; fleshlight,” He chuckled before I felt His flesh against my hole, “open up.” My body obeyed, opening itself to its rightful owner. My eyes closed by themselves as I moaned loudly, “thank YOU MASTER.” He filled me up instantly, every inch of Him kept warm against the moist ridges of my ass. Daddy didn&#39;t have to do anything once He was in me. I spent my days training my ass, my throat, my mind for Him. Focusing on His cock, I fucked myself with it, doing all the heavy lifting. Master Larry didn&#39;t have to stroke or anything, I was the one who was always ready for Him. I lifted my head from His chest as I moaned, admiring my owner.<br />
<br />
Sir Larry licked His lips with a smirk. “How&#39;s my little toy doing?” He smugly asked me. I tried piecing out a sentence, only able to reply with an airy “uuuhhmmmmmahhhhhhhh.” Daddy let out a booming laugh, echoing through the room, shaking His own cock inside me. “Alright, time to do some more work,” He let out.</p>
