<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After switching on the news channel to understand as much of the nature of the chaos as they could, the two both called their loved ones.  Tail swishing, feet stamping, Celia was able to contact the untransformed Kent and her untransformed adult daughter, but Ben&#39;s mother, who was staying at his house, did not respond.<br />
Hugging Celia to wish her and Kent safety and luck, Ben shouted as he ran out the door to find something to protect herself.  Scrambling to his car, he rushed along the side of the highway, avoiding transformees and the unchanged alike, desperately trying to make it to his mother in time before all the streets became clogged with panicked, unmoving traffic.  Almost hitting a group of terrified SWB girls, getting hit by a full-fledged, busty female centaur, and getting harassed by an naked eagle harpy, Ben soon made it, miraculously, home.<br />
<br />
Stopping to led a group of people run across the road, Ben had been harassed by a six-foot tall bimbo with overexaggerated figures.  Her blonde hair shone with an iridescence uncomfortable to the eyes, and her G-cup breasts looked ridiculous on her slim frame as they strained the limits of her (now) tiny jean jacket.  With bright pink nails that were long enough to be literal claws and a waist only a foot wide, Ben was startled when she slammed against the car, sucking, bright pink, oversized lips first.  Having heard from the news that some mutants had developed dangerously high libidos, he almost sped away before the apparent bimbo took out her phone and, with much difficulty, typed &quot;help&quot; before clasping her hands in a pleading motion.<br />
Against his better judgement, Ben rolled down his window to her relief as she spoke - <br />
&quot;Thammkbbk yooubb.  Dwwoo yboo know howwb two gwett toub thuu twaaiine?&quot; - the saliva and lip smacking made it sound even worse.<br />
Not wanting to abandon the girl, Ben got her to type her question out painstakingly before guiding her in the right direction.<br />
She jumped up and down in glee, her breasts and the titanic bulge in her apple-bottom jeans that reached down to her knee wobbling.  Then, she reached into the car to give Ben a big hug before giving him a big, wet smooch on the forehead.  As she ran off, Ben couldn&#39;t help but laugh - it had been a while since he had been kissed by a girl.<br />
<br />
Getting out of the car and onto the sidewalk, a packed sedan screeched to a halt as the driver waved him over and rolled the window down.  A concerned two headed woman, with two hands on the wheel and another comforting a sobbing teenage girl, began to ask him questions.<br />
&quot;Hi good sir, do you know what in the Hell is going on?&quot;<br />
Quickly explaining to two women the situation and warning them to find someplace safe quickly, the women explained how they had once just been a single individual - a single mother who had been attending a soccer match their former son-turned-daughter was playing at.  He, now she, was visibly, quite upset - and Ben offered his condolences and some comfort.<br />
Another two voices piped up from the backseat, and unbuckling their seatbelts, a headless feminine body also clothed in a soccer jersey popped forward.  Pulling it open, Ben instinctually looked away, before realizing that identical female heads had taken the place of the breasts on the body.  Further still, the head-breasts were missing mouths, with rather perky nipples in their places.  Lifting up both of their hands to face Ben, the perfect, rosy red lips on their palms spoke independently, introducing themselves as teammates of their feminized friend.  They both nervously sighed in relief as they fears regarding the mental states of mutants were resolved.<br />
As a token of their thanks, the two-headed mother handed Ben a ten-dollar bill and wished him luck before speeding away.<br />
<br />
Taking a momentary glance at the next-door lawn to determine the source of some rather loud moaning, the man grimaced as he saw what looked like a fusion between the neighboring couple and an inflatable Christmas decoration.  The 9-foot tall, nylon being was maneuvering its puffy arms and hands to stroke off its rather puffy penis and vagina, its two antlered heads moaning quietly as the engine that inflated their brown, reindeer-like body continued to blow.  One head more feminine than the other, both had inflated bell collars around their necks and an inflated red nose, which, respectfully, neither jingled nor glowed.<br />
Ben, fumbling with his keys, listened to the moans reach a breaking point, before ceasing all together as air burst with a whine from the tip of the sentient inflatable&#39;s penis and from the inside of its vagina.  Sighing in relief, the left head gave the right a peck as they leaned on each other as they deflated.  With the inflatable&#39;s shapely reindeer behind being the last area to deflate, Ben got a good view of realistic feminine ass poke up in the air and deflate, leaving the reindeer tail as the last to die out.<br />
<br />
Not knowing what to expect any more, Ben opened the door and burst in, expecting to find his mother fused with a sofa or a television.  He instead found her sleeping blissfully in a puddle of her own semen, lying on the floor of the cum-drenched kitchen.  Having de-aged morphologically by some thirty years, the newborn teen&#39;s supple legs, now shoulder-mounted, had switched places with her arms, now attached to her hips.  The shortened woman somehow did not have trouble stroking herself off, however - her breasts had inflated to D-Cups before multiplying into four, then five - arranged in a dice&#39;s formation.  And then, somehow, their nipples had each turned into a four-inch penis.  Judging from the fact that only the center breast&#39;s penis stood erect while all the others lay flaccid and crusting, Ben assumed that she hadn&#39;t even gotten to toying with that one before the pleasure from the other four knocked her out.<br />
<br />
Ben spent the rest of the day helping his mother shower, clean the kitchen, and cook a quick dinner, before they both became terrified at worsening news developments. <br />
When Ben finally got to bed that night, the first thing on his mind was his mother&#39;s enthusiasm at young new body.  The second was his mild disappointment that he hadn&#39;t been transformed in any way - he would have loved for the Fusion Wave to have gotten his extra weight removed. - Such wish would be granted, with much more, the following day.</p>
