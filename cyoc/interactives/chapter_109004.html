<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff worked quickly, Sean&#39;s mother calling out as they were reaching the door. &quot;Sean! This is your last chance to explain yourself before we come in! You had better not be hiding an animal in your room!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sean looked over to Jeff as the doorknob turned. Jeff mashed the enter key as soon as he changed the target to &quot;group&quot; to try and get it to activate quickly. The Chronovac popped up with a dozen dialog boxes to adjust the settings for a group change, each of them gone unread by the panicked teens.<br />
<br />
&quot;We saw the tracks going straight he-&quot; Jeff&#39;s mother stopped mid-sentence as the emitter hit the three parents in the now-open doorway. The changes started immediately, identical on both women and the man.<br />
<br />
Their ears pulled up into points and migrated up on their heads, their hair spreading onto them as fur, black for %Sean_dad, blonde for %Sean_mom, and brown for %Jeff_mom. For the women, their longer hair seemed to pull up on its own, retracting back into their heads until it was no longer than the fur spreading down their heads.<br />
<br />
Their faces were the next to change, their eyes changing to shades of amber, gold, and brown. In the down of a few seconds, their nose and mouth pulled forward, reshaping into distinct lupine snouts. The fur spread onward at the same time, giving them full lupine heads on their still-human bodies.<br />
<br />
But not for long, as the changes spread along with the growing fur. As if signaling the other changes, all three of their muscles tensed and flexed as the fur grew past them. Still held frozen, it was a sight for the two boys as their parents&#39; shoulders widened simultaneously to fit the growing muscles, biceps and triceps bulking in size as the fur spread down their arms.<br />
<br />
Both teens were still frozen in worry themselves as they noticed the strangest change yet. While it was no surprise Sean&#39;s dad would start tearing through his shirt when his pectoral muscles were affected, causing his chest to outgrow the thin material, what shocked then the most was what was happening to their moms. Their tops were starting to tear all the same, but only at the sides. In the fronts, where normally the women had noticeable breasts, the material started to sag. Instead of growing larger in the expected way, their chests grew more muscular like Sean&#39;s father, losing any feminine qualities as their fur made it look hairier than any man&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Sean looked back toward Jeff nervously as their parents&#39; nails sharpened and grew into claws. &quot;That... That&#39;s normal, right? I mean, with the muscles...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... bodybuilding women don&#39;t... have big boobs anyway, right?&quot; Jeff finished his friend&#39;s thought, too afraid the changes would stop if he looked away even as he was mortified at the shirts treating and falling off their parents&#39; bodies. The fur had spread onward, any gut or belly fat already reshaped into six-pack abs on each of them. And on the fur spread, into pants and shorts, quickly seen coming out the shorts legs as the muscles swelled with strength.<br />
<br />
As if there was someone controlling the changes, they seemed to focus on the legs and feet first. Shoes were quickly destroyed as the bone structure changed, heels pulling off the ground while toes rounded out, the largest toe pulling back and up as nails once more grew out into claws, disappearing into a dewclaw to finish off their new digitgrade paws. A tearing sound drew both teens attention back upward from the floor, tails growing out behind their parents.<br />
<br />
And with the trails bursting free, the growing muscles made short work of the rest of the adults&#39; clothes. The sudden reveal gave the teens far more information about their parents&#39; undergarments than they wanted to know. While Sean could live with his dad&#39;s boxers or his mom&#39;s panties, Jeff was mortified to see the lace thong his mother was wearing. But it also made it clear the changes were far from over.<br />
<br />
What was happening to the growing bulge in Sean&#39;s dad&#39;s boxers both teens knew well. And to their continued horror, there were matching bulges growing in both their moms&#39; underwear. Through the lace on Jeff&#39;s mom, they could see her clitoris growing larger and longer, pushing out against the thong and creating an obscene bulge. It didn&#39;t take long for it to push the waistband away and push itself out of it, a matching growth on %Sean_mom proving that the changes were being mirrored. Neither saw %Sean_dad own penis push out of the waistband of his bozers, already larger and redder as it changed. They were frozen in shock at watching their moms, and the most profound changes they&#39;d seen yet.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take much longer for them to realize what was happening, though. Sean stumbled back toward Jeff as he made the connection, not able to keep close to the door where his mom was turning into a second dad. As the lengths became thicker at the base, tapering quickly to points at the tip, the canine members on their moms was the final shock they could handle. They passed out, dropping to the floor as new testicles dropped into just-formed scrotums for the newly-male wolves.<br />
<br />
As the changes finished for the three parents, sheaths pulling their male lengths against their bodies and hiding them from immediate view, whatever power was holding them still let them go. As far as they were aware, no time had passed since they opened the door. But what other settings were changed unintentionally by Jeff&#39;s rush?</p>
