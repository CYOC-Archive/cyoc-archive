<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you and Cathy went for a jog you again found yourself staring at her ass as you&#39;ve done so many times before. But this time something was different. The other times you kept telling yourself it was wrong and that your attraction to Cathy would pass. But now... now you started imagine how it would feel to fuck her just like you had done Anna. How her pussy would taste. Was she a screamer? clean-shaved, hairy or maybe something in between. You felt yourself grow hard while thinking about eating her out. This was so wrong - but at the same time - perfectly normal. Cathy was just a woman now. Not your mother. She hadn&#39;t been your mother for a month. To the rest of the world she was your wife. Your wife with a sexy ass. Big tits. So what if she was a little bit pudgy? She was losing weight. And even still, a little bit of fat on a beautiful mother of four was to be expected. <br />
<br />
Cathy kept looking over her shoulder at you, now noticing the large bulge in your shorts. Looking a bit embarrassed as she noticed it. You were now a bit into the woods and all alone. She stopped. So did you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; she said, while trying to catch her breath. &quot;I know you&#39;ve been looking at my ass on these jogs. But I&#39;ve also seen your guilty look and I talked with Dr Larry. He told me what he told you. About it being left overs from the former Steve.&quot; Now a bit more composed, but her face red from embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I cannot get you out of my head. And I&#39;m not gonna lie. I kind of liked it when you looked at me. I still only see my husband when I look at you. And I can&#39;t take this anymore&quot; She said while looking around. &quot;And judging from that thing in your pants, you can&#39;t take much more either&quot;. Now you felt incredibly flustered. What was going on here? But before you had much more time to think Cathy had walked up to you and put her tongue in your mouth and her hand on your crotch. &quot;I know you want this as well&quot; she whispered. &quot;Let&#39;s move behind that big rock, now&quot; she said with determination. You didn&#39;t resist as she lead you there. <br />
<br />
Soon enough you were making out with Cathy like a couple of teenagers. This was nothing like with Anna. This was much better. You didn&#39;t care how wrong it was. You, making out with Cathy.  A woman that used to be your own mother. But that didn&#39;t matter. Whatever was left over from the old Steve was making this amazing. Was this how being with a woman you loved felt like? The chemistry was so intense.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want more&quot; she whispered. You pulled down her tights to expose her wet pussy. &quot;You made me this way&quot; she said. &quot;Take responsibility&quot; she added while pushing your head down between her legs. You were eating her out. Her pussy tasted so good for some  reason. She was incredible at helping you find exactly the right spot and rhythm. &quot;You&#39;re gonna make me cum&quot; she whispered while suppressing her moans. &quot;Make me cum, Honey&quot;. After a few more seconds you felt her pussy juices flow down your beard as she quivered. All while trying not to make any sound. &quot;Oh fuck, that was great, babe&quot; she said. &quot;Now it&#39;s your turn&quot; she purred and pulled down your shorts. Below you were now the view of a lifetime. Cathy was looking at your throbbing member with truly eager eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve missed this bad boy&quot; she said as she put her lips around it. &quot;And I&#39;ve missed this taste&quot; she added in between head bobs. After a while she stopped &quot;I think you&#39;re ready&quot; she again purred as she turned around and put her hands up against the rock. &quot;Fuck your sexy wife with your fat cock, Baby&quot;. As you put your girthy man-meat in her she moaned loudly. She could no longer contain them. Soon you were fucking her with both speed and power while repeating &quot;How do you like your husbands cock?&quot; and Cathy answering &quot;I love it&quot; each time. Turn around you told her and she obediently obeyed. You pushed her up against the large boulder and Cathy helped you by putting up her leg and guiding you to the right spot. &quot;Hold my leg up, Honey&quot; she commanded as you started thrusting. You looked her deep in the eyes as you said &quot;I.. I love you&quot; and Cathy just replied with &quot;I love you too&quot; as she started kissing you. &quot;You&#39;ve had a vasectomy by the way, so you can come inside of me&quot;. She told you. You kept thrusting as Cathy&#39;s tight pussy kept clamping down harder and harder on your shaft. Her big tits bouncing inside her top. That was when she said &quot;I&#39;m gonna cum on your big dick now&quot; as she dug her nails into your back. This made you cum as well. You tried to pull out but Cathy stopped you. &quot;We&#39;re not done yet. Your wife needs more of your big thing&quot;. That made you instantly harden again. You kept going for probably 40 minutes in different positions each more pleasurable than the last. And Cathy kept guiding you to make her cum. <br />
<br />
&quot;That was... Amazing.&quot; Cathy said. &quot;And with the cat out of the bag, this was not the last time this happened&quot; she said smiling. &quot;But we obviously can&#39;t tell the kids. Imagine if David were to find out his parents are fucking?&quot; she added. &quot;When he used to be one of them?&quot; She laughed. You smiled as well. &quot;Yeah, this was amazing. Babe&quot; that last part making Cathy crack an even wider smile. &quot;You know, I think it&#39;s best if we think of each other as husband and wife. That makes this a little less weird. And it really turned me on when you called yourself my husband.&quot; she cooed. You nodded in agreement. Thinking of Cathy as your wife was turning you on as well. &quot;And maybe we could go on a date, as husband and wife? I have a work thing and spouses are invited, the kids wouldn&#39;t think twice about it&quot; You told her. &quot;I... I think I&#39;d like that&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
You walked back to the house in bliss. Excited for the idea of more sex with this sexy woman next to you.</p>
