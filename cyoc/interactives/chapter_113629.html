<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The family split up, each following a different path.  Derrick was torn, tempted by the nymphs but also very interested in seeing satyrs and fauns.  He decided to check to the nymphs first since he was only planning to sneak a peak.  There would be time to check out the satyrs afterwards.  June chuckled as she saw the teenager look at the different paths in confusion, and being typically male, not asking directions.  He started down a trail she had not talked about, for good reason.  She hoped he wouldn&#39;t mind losing sex forever.<br />
<br />
The trail Derrick was on twisted down and through some thick trees, then opened up into a beautiful pond surrounded by brilliant flowers and odd-looking rounded huge plants, some with petals spread open and others closed up like big pumpkins.  There was movement over behind one of the big plants and he hunched down, hoping to see a naked dryad or nymph.  Instead, a naked little boy, no more than 3 years old, wandered out.  The child was eating something sticky, licking his fingers happily.<br />
<br />
Disappointed, he started to turn, and then fell back with a shout as two similar toddlers flew up in front of his face.  Startled, he scrambled back as the two darted and dove at him like giant hummingbirds, giggling all the time.  Derrick realized he was being herded by cherubs!  Scowling, he stood and brushed himself off while the flying children hovered close by, grinning happily.  &quot;A human!  We have not had a human here in a long time!&quot;   The closest one hovered closer and reached out to feel Derrick&#39;s hair.  &quot;A big human!  Play with us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick shook his head.  &quot;I was looking or the Nymphs.  Could you show me where they are?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;  The third Cherub joined the two to fly close to Derrick.  They were all touching him now, tiny hands stroking his face, his hair, probing his nostrils and mouth and ears.  It was like being surrounded by babies.  Well, he actually was surrounded by babies.  They were cute looking, and seemed very friendly, so he put up with their attentions.  &quot;Sit down and we will help you find the pretty ladies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick started to sit on the ground, but one of the cherubs tugged him toward one of the open flowers.  &quot;No!  Sit there!&quot;  Derrick started to protest that he did not want to crush the plant, but then saw that the leaves were very thick, and there was a curious swelling in the middle that looked almost like a shaped seat cushion.  Settling carefully, he was surprised that it help his weight, though it spread out and up to cup around his rump.  It was very comfortable.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where do I find the &#39;pretty ladies&#39;?&quot;  Derrick grinned at three flying boys - each was different - one was blonde, another looked Hispanic, while the third was probably African.  Other than that they were pretty much identical, about 3 years old with small white wings that flapped so fast they were a blur.  <br />
<br />
All three boys giggled and backed away, watching him.  The Hispanic child said &quot;They are very close.  On top of the hill.&quot;  He pointed to what looked like a sheer cliff just beyond the trees.  Derrick stared up and then sighed.  &quot;Um, is there some other way?  I can&#39;t fly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We show you!&quot; insisted the black boy.  All three zoomed back to pull at his hair, his clothing, his face.  He did his best to wave them off, not wanting to hurt the little guys.  &quot;Hey, back off!&quot;  His voice cracked unexpectedly, something that had not happened in along time, and that seemed to amuse the toddlers.  Derrick was getting annoyed again, and feeling oddly warm.  Then he gasped as something pulled at his crotch.  Looking down, his eyes went wide.  His pants were crumbling apart!  He tried to jump up, but the soft, form-fitting pad was somehow stuck around his rump.  &quot;Hey!  Let me go!&quot;  The teen struggled, then jerked and cried out as a fleshy green tube suddenly slid over his exposed penis  and applied suction!  A  moment later he felt something probe his anus and then push in locking him to the pad.  <br />
<br />
Derrick struggled, pulling and kicking, but the plant was incredibly tough.  Then he saw that the huge petals were closing in around him!  He struck them with his fists and tried to push them back, but the thick petals could not be stopped.  He was pressed down into the monster flower&#39;s center as the plant closed up to the pumpkin shape.  <br />
<br />
Struggling as best he could, Derrick felt the tubes start to draw liquid out of him through his penis and anus.  Now he was terrified.  The plant was eating him!  He could feel his body getting smaller - it seemed like his flesh and bones were becoming thick paste that was sucked out.   The weird thing was that it all felt really good.  Not sexual, but like he had really needed to use the bathroom badly and was finally able to let go.  His struggles got feebler and weaker, and finally he just sat there dazed, wrapped up inside the plant.  He felt sleepy now, and though he was afraid he was being digested by a carnivorous plant, could not keep his eyes open.<br />
<br />
Derrick woke feeling warm sunshine on his face.  Blinking, he looked up to see the sun high overhead, and the three cherubs hovering over him with big grins.  His first reaction was relief - he had not been eaten!  Then he felt the tubes pull free of his body and looked down.  It was easy to recognize the stubby legs and rounded belly, even if it was covered in golden-brown skin.  Gaping, he stood up on wobbly legs and stumbled over tot eh edge of the pond.  A 3 year-old Asian boy stared back at him, angelic looking especially with the small white wings sprouting from his shoulders.  He had been turned into a Cherub!</p>
