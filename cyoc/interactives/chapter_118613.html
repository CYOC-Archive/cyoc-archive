<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A second later his mom stepped into the house announcing her presence, &quot;I&#39;m home! Jeff, I&#39;ve got groceries!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shit! Jeff realized she had set the world to change but not reality itself, so the clothes she was wearing and had in her closet, fit her, but mom (and her little sister) was expecting a teenage boy, not a woman, to come racing down the stairs and help.<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to her profile and switched her gender back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, did you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap!&quot;, now panicking. There were too many fields to change and he needs to respond before mom comes into her room! &quot;Fuck it.&quot; Jeff mumbled to herself toggling on the reality shift setting and clicking apply. Jeff sharply inhaled ready to reply, but caught herself as some warning popped up. &quot;Proceeding with this change............. do you wish to continue?&quot;<br />
<br />
YES! Jeff clicked without reading and bolted for the door. &quot;I&#39;m coming!&quot; Jeff yelled from the hallway. His voice sounding masculine again. With each step he took he took he could feel his body weight redistributing and increasing. As he hit the stairs he felt the bouncing of his boobs become the bouncing of the muscles making his pecs.<br />
<br />
With a sigh of relief he hit the kitchen and breezed past without a glance. He opened the trunk of the car and pulled out the groceries, taking an extra moment to get 5 bags on one arm, four on the other arm and carefully he grabbed the 30 pk of beer with his free hand. With all the groceries grabbed, he shut the trunk feeling disoriented for a second. Didn&#39;t she drive an SUV?<br />
<br />
Brushing the feeling aside as the bags were beginning to cut off circulation, Jeff went into the kitchen and deposited everything onto the kitchen table. &quot;Here you go Cheryl.&quot; <br />
<br />
She turned around and smiled. With a chuckle she said, &quot;Thanks. You know, you and Jim both refuse to make more than one trip. I think you boys got it from your mother, she&#39;s just as stubborn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her words went in one ear and out the other, something about Jim. You never realized until this moment how breathtakingly beautiful Cheryl is. You noticed her shift her gaze to your face, and she passed you a lustful glare as she glanced at the microwave clock. She swept past you and looked in on your niece who was completely absorbed in her TV show, was playing on her cell phone, and had her headphones in. Kids these days.<br />
<br />
Something in the back of your mind was screaming this is wrong, but it&#39;s not like you were proud of your affair with your brother&#39;s wife, but she was so fucking hot.<br />
<br />
She led you up the stairs to the guestroom/office you were staying in during your vacation. Something about your room seemed off, some vague thought about missing your stuff, but that wasn&#39;t important right now. After shutting and locking the door you disrobed eagerly and were briefly surprised as you saw your equipment.<br />
<br />
Cheryl was just as fast and within seconds you were feeling eachothers&#39; bodies and stifling the moans that wanted to erupt from your passion. After a few seconds of making out, you gently lifted her and placed her on the floor, the bed, 5 feet away, was just too far. You continued kissing her delicate and supple neck, while thrusting, and caressing her generous curves. <br />
<br />
She pushed you back to look at your face, you continued thrusting, and she whispered, &quot;Jim will be home in an hour, I still need to start dinner.&quot; You grunted and nodded.<br />
<br />
You knew that should turn you off, but it only intensified the thrill. Maybe you appreciated her concern for secrecy, her weird ability to multitask despite what was going on, or maybe it just reaffirmed that you were having sex with your older brother&#39;s wife, being chosen over him.<br />
<br />
Without warning she reached up grabbing two fistfuls of your chest hair and pulled herself up as she came. The sudden pain mixed with everything else and you barely stifled the scream from orgasm, pain and surprise.<br />
<br />
You were motionless, absorbing all the pleasure of the orgasms afterglow. Cheryl got up and dressed as quickly as she undressed. She went to the door, unlocked it and slipped out, going to the bathroom to &quot;freshen up.&quot; As she slipped out she gave you that look that made your body scream for more.<br />
<br />
You felt amazing and dressed much more slowly. Something about the computer drew your attention as you pulled your pants up. You pulled on the same shirt, no need to make your niece suspicious. You reached into your bag and reapplied your cologne. <br />
<br />
You sauntered over to the computer waiting for Cheryl to finish up so you can wipe off your dick. The program on the computer was throwing up an alert of some kind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Urgency activation: Due to the biochemical state of the last user when attempting to activate an interaction, this program was forced to make assumptions regarding:    Percent of prior reality recalled by User,  .  The prior state is available for reversion like normal, however, Percent of prior reality recalled by User was set to 0% and will automatically increase to 100% over a 5 hour duration, this can be adjusted manually using the slider below.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as &quot;Current Value:&quot; flipped from 7 to 8%. It felt like that should mean something, but it didn&#39;t. You don&#39;t recall your niece coming into the room for the computer but she might have. It looked like the program was taking care of itself anyway, why mess with it.<br />
<br />
Cheryl had gone downstairs while you were trying to decipher the meaning of the computer warning so you should be safe to go to the bathroom without things seeming obvious.</p>
