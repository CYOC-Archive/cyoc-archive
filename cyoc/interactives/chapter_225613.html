<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lankey had a firm grasp on his animalistic penis as he watched the Anthro Beaver Furry squat by the side of the road to pee. Angling herself in such a way, that her feminine slit was exposed and in clear view of the two teenage furies temporarily under her charge. She smiled wickedly through he muzzle as a stream of urine flowed from her lips; grinning as Lankey’s furious stroking upon seeing a woman’s most treasured secret watched as he blew his load. His salty splooge splattering all over the dirt and sticking to his fur; the Koala furry sighed in contentment as his torrent soon tapered off and he started to clean up. His efforts were soon stopped when the anthro beaver got up from her bladder break and used her magic runes to save as much of Lankey’s cum and put it in a vial.<br />
“In case we get people trying to pass through our checkpoint again,” is all she said.<br />
<br />
Slag, the anthro Copperhead snake furry just shook his head as his tongue flicked in and out of his mouth. Smelling the air as a result; he could taste the pheromones that both Lankey and the female deputy were giving off.<br />
“If it weren’t for the age gap between us,” Slag breaking his silence; “I would be actively trying to seduce you.”<br />
“As if you’d have a chance,” the anthro beaver deputy smirking; “but a boy’s reach should exceed his grasp. For what is a penis for,” the deputy joking as she puts a stopper on Lankey’s stored seed.<br />
<br />
She explained the plan to the two furry teens earlier. They were to use their runes to remain invisible as she talked to the humans who she requested to exit their vehicles to perform a sobriety test. Making their roadblock a make shift anti-drinking & driving stop. As she would get the person to perform the varied field sobriety tests, they would fling the infectious seed at the person, hoping it would land in such a way as if the person just got shat on by a bird flying overhead. It was a good plan that worked twice already. The first time was with the Anthro beaver’s vaginal honey as it landed on a balding man’s head and trickled down entering a tear duct. He soon turned into an Anthro Cassowary furry who’s transformation was sped up as Slag gave the sexual aroused man a blow job; careful not to pierce the man’s avian penis with his snake fangs. Fangs that Slag was unsure if they were venomous or not.<br />
<br />
The second use of this plan involved a family of three. A mother and father couple with their six year old girl. Choosing to take a drive out into the wilderness in a convertible with the top down; one of the lasts days to do it as chilly October air is signaling that winter will soon arrive. So the anthro beaver deputy continued her ruse and allowed Lankey and Slag to fling Slag’s cum at the family while still invisible. The sound of the six year old girl shieking as she was wiping the sticky substance as it hit her face soon got the parents attention.<br />
“Looks like bird crap,” was what the deputy said as she watched the mother cleaning the mess off her daughter; “you might want to put the top on your car as the geese and ducks are currently flying south for the winter.&quot;<br />
Before the father could nod as his wife finished cleaning their daughter both he and her were soon hit with the cum magically made to look like bird shit. The deputy had to stifle a laughter as the father swore as some of the infectious concoction entered his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Mommy I feel funny,” the girl managed to speak before she had an uncontrollable urge to take her clothes off. Ripping them as black fur started to sprout over her body. Her pleas of help were soon drowned out as her parents started to moan as they too began to turn into furies.<br />
“Boy’s,” the deputy speaking; “help the girl as her parents get amorous with their change.<br />
Letting their spell lapse, the girl who was soon terrified and now looking confussed watched as an anthro koala and anthro sopperhead snake furry approached her.<br />
“You’re looking like the cutest anthro skunk furry,” Lankey speaking with a kindness behind his voice; “you want to see some magic?”<br />
“Yeah,” was all the girl could say as she clambered out of the convertible; shaking the tattered remains of her clothes as she padded towards the two, naked and unconcerned if her fur covered privates were on display. She smiled as the runes on Lankey’s and Slag’s wrist glowed as they summoned small balls of fire and started to juggle them between the two.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the girl’s parents were already climbing over each other as they struggle to remove their clothes. The furry virus encouraging them to rut and passionately embrace each other; they were soon assisted when the deputy, who now lowered her glamour to reveal herself as an anthro beaver furry helped to remove the clothes as both parent’s fur started to form. Like their daughter, both were turning into anthro skunk furies. Watching as the mother had the man’s penis in her rapidly forming muzzle; sucking it hard as she had a rapidly forming hand paw buried in her aching snatch. It wasn’t long before the man grunted and the mother gagged upon reflex as she was not ready to handle her husband’s more fertile and virile load. With the formation of their tails with white stripes running from tip to the tops of their heads and the formation of their runes, the couple soon relaxed as they starred into each other’s eyes; the statified expression as all furies gain after transformation assured that they were accepting of their new forms. They soon collected their daughter who was beaming at how pretty she and mommy looked. The father thanking the deputy for her advice, put the top of his convertible back up as they continued their country drive.<br />
<br />
Now it was Lankey’s turn to use his infectious fluids at the next approaching vehicle. It was a beaten up looking Ford Bronco with an overabundance of flood lights.<br />
“Careful of this one boys,” the deputy watching the two go back to being invisible; “I suspect he is armed.”<br />
The female deputy’s suspicions were soon confirm as the driver soon stepped out of his vehicle wielding a bolt action hunting rifle. She suspected that the flood light on the truck were for night hunting. Flooding a field suspected of have deer grazing, the lights would paralyze the deer as it tried to remain still; however this resulted in the hunter getting an easy shot from the comfort of the vehicle. It was considered an unethical form of hunting an illegal. The deputy suspected that this person had been doing such a task but has not been caught.<br />
<br />
“Is there a problem officer,” the man speaking in a belligerent fashion. Believing that he has the upper hand as all he sees is a lone woman in a uniform that means little to him.<br />
“You can first put away your weapon,” the officer looking stern; placing a hand by her waist, pretending to ready her service weapon despite the fact that she had none and her glamor made her looked armed.<br />
“Or you’ll what,” the man looking smug; “arrest me? You can try,” the man smirking as he started sporting a tent in his pants.<br />
<br />
“Acceptable terms,” Lankey speaking from behind the man; dropping his invisibility spell so he can see the koala furry.<br />
The man spun around with his weapon and stood stunned as the anthro koala has a vial of something and threw it at him. The man dodges the object and was about to raise his rifle to shoot, when slag appeared behind the man. Grabbing him to prevent him from firing; Slag hisses as he sinks his snake fangs into the man’s shoulder. The ear piercing scream from the man permeates the surrounding area as Slag soon releases his vice like grip just as the deputy wrenches the fire arm and breaks in in half.<br />
“That’s not what we planned,” the deputy looking at the two disapprovingly.<br />
“He had a gun,” Lankey retorting; “what were we suppose to do, let him shoot you?”<br />
“Fuck I think I broke a fang,” Slag using one of the truck’s side mirrors to examine the hollow teeth resting at the top of his palette.<br />
“Are they venomous,” Lankey looking at the man as he writhes in pain on the ground.<br />
“Copperheads are venomous snakes,” the deputy sighing as she radios for a medic; just try to make him comfortable as I search his truck. I suspect he is a poacher,” the deputy lowering the back gate of the truck.<br />
“What the fuck,” the man gasping in pain; “are you!”<br />
“The next evolution of humanity,” slag hissing as he gets close to the man; his forked tongue tickling the man’s cheek.<br />
“Furies,” Lankey adding; “and we are spreading fast.”<br />
“I don’t think he will make it,” Slag watching the man struggling to breath; “plus his skin is looking really pale.”<br />
<br />
“Did you just smoke from this pipe,” the deputy returning to the man and tossing the glass object on his lap. She also tossed down the small bag of rock like crystals; “were you driving high on meth?”<br />
“F.f.f.fuck you,” the man shaking as his body struggles to fight what is raging inside.<br />
“I need to know if you have any hope in surviving,” The deputy now letting her glamor fade.<br />
“Y.y.y.y.y.our a f.f.f.f.f.freak as w.w.w.w.w.well,” the man seeing the female anthro beaver as he shudders with what could be his final breaths.<br />
Before the deputy could answer, the man stops breathing as his eyes go lifeless and grey.<br />
“I killed him,” Slag looking at the man who just died; “I didn’t mean too.”<br />
“look,” the deputy sighing as she places a comforting hand paw on the copperhead fury’s shoulder; “you were acting to defend your friend and me. It’s a justified homicide. Plus,” the deputy opening the deceased man’s mouth and shaking her head; “he was an addict. His teeth have rotted away from meth use. Bet you his body was wrecked from so much drug abuse that the furry virus was too much for him to handle.”<br />
“So I’m not venomous like my limbless swamp dwelling counterpart,” Slag finding it hard to see the positive in this.<br />
“Well you could bite someone who is healthy,” the deputy responding; “but do you really want to test that?”</p>
