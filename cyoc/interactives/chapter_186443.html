<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel was your average teenager with an interest in fitness, although that wasn&#39;t always the case. During his freshman year, Daniel hated how plain and average he was. That&#39;s when he decided to join his school&#39;s fitness club to change that. That&#39;s also where he got hooked to lifting and eventually joined the school&#39;s weightlifting team. Daniel wasn&#39;t what many would consider buff just yet, more so an athletic and lean swimmer&#39;s build, but he was proud of the progress he made and couldn&#39;t wait to make more.<br />
<br />
Anyway, while he was glad that Billy wasn&#39;t usually annoying like other younger brothers, he was annoying now. Daniel was playing video games when he heard a weird banging noise coming from his little brother&#39;s room. Perhaps Billy was just moving some weights in his room, the older brother thought. However, when he heard a scream, it was then where Daniel decided that he probably should check up on Billy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Billy! What on earth are you doing up there?!&quot; Daniel yelled as he headed up to his brother&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Billy was panicking. He wanted to call out to his brother that everything was fine but then realize that his voice was deeper now and would only make Daniel more suspicious. His only hope was that the leaching cube would return him to his original age quick enough. However, in his panic, Billy said something he didn&#39;t mean to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-age Daniel ten years!&quot; Immediately after he said that Billy covered his mouth in shock and question why he just did that. He then used the Leeching Cube again, and this time he said the correct thing and began to regress to his original age. Although, perhaps doing that was unnecessary, considering Daniel was going to age ten years and Billy had no way to stop it. The only thing Billy could do now was hope that Daniel didn&#39;t put two and two together.<br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
With no response from his younger brother, Daniel made his way upstairs. Though, once he reached the second floor, a strange feeling came over him. Was everything smaller than usual? Daniel thought at first before he realized that no, he was getting taller! Before the young teen could process what was happening to him, he soon felt dizzy and collapse onto one knee.<br />
<br />
If that wasn&#39;t enough, Daniel then felt that his arms were getting numb. However, when he looked over to see what was wrong, he found that his arms were more muscular than before. It probably would have taken him a year to get arms this size, according to Daniel&#39;s rough calculations. Not to mention they were still growing!<br />
<br />
Soon after seeing that, Daniel&#39;s body started to grow all at once. His shoulders were broadening at an incredible rate, but it was his broadening back that caused the shirt he was wearing to tear first. His pecs follow suit as they caused his shirt to get completely destroyed. Daniel&#39;s abs hardened and strengthened with each breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what&#39;s happening to me!&quot; Daniel cried out in a deeper voice. His legs that he struggled to build up were now pillars of muscles that absolutely destroyed his pants. All he had left to wear were a pair of boxers that were straining against his bigger butt and slightly bigger junk. The last thing to change was his face. It was becoming more handsome and mature, to the point where a short beard grew in. And finally, it was over.<br />
<br />
After he made sure that he wasn&#39;t getting any older, the older brother stormed into Billy&#39;s room, where he found a Billy who had returned to his correct age. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know you did this!&quot; Daniel accused as he motioned at his adult body, &quot;What did you do to me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Billy slumped his shoulder as he listened to his brother&#39;s accusations. Well, there was no use trying to his way out of this one. He had no choice but to tell Daniel almost everything. &quot;Alright, Luis, you can come out now the jig is up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sheepishly the still adult Luis came out of Billy&#39;s closet wearing a makeshift loincloth with Billy&#39;s clothes. Daniel&#39;s eyes went wide when he recognized the man as an adult Luis, while Billy started to give an explanation. There were a few details that he left out, like what he and Luis did after becoming adults or how creepy Mr. Gaunt was, but he explained the main things Daniel needed to know.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so basically, you got a cube that can change your age?&quot; Daniel started, &quot;Well, I guess we don&#39;t have to tell our parents about this...&quot; As much as Daniel wanted to be the responsible older brother, he still had the mentality of a dumb teenager. It felt great to be in his adult body, plus having the power over people&#39;s ages was just too enticing. Hearing this made Billy ecstatic. He could continue his aging escapades, abate under the watchful eye of his brother, but that was better than not being able to use the cube at all. Now there was only one question left to answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great, so what do we do now?&quot; Billy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Luis chimed in,  &quot;I might have an idea...&quot;</p>
<hr/><h3>What do you do now?</h3>
