<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;m a donkey.&quot; Alex thought to himself for what must have been the thousandth time as he plodded along. The sun was setting but they had made it to town. This must have been Dicktin, with it&#39;s cobblestone streets and multi-story buildings. In the middle of the sprawling town lay a large keep that Alex could occasionally get glimpses of up one street or another.<br />
<br />
On entering the town they had passed through a gate guarded by what Alex assumed were a pair of town guard. Their uniforms showed as much flesh as they covered, vital parts covered by armor, though they looked more like gladiators out of some raunchy movie about ancient Rome to Alex&#39;s eyes than plain town guards. He tried braying at one to get their attention, to rescue him, but the guard only seemed amused and Lyonus whacked him hard on the rump with the riding crop for doing so.<br />
<br />
While humans made up most of the town, there were a few other species running around. He saw one burly man with green tinged skin, an even bigger man with a bull&#39;s head and hooves, there were smaller humanoids, almost child sized but with beards, and even some people that looked like animals walking on two legs. Also, every last person he saw was male. He knew it would be so after his time here already, but it was strange seeing it. He even saw two young men walking together, one with an amply swollen belly that stuck out on his otherwise lithe frame. A man. Pregnant.<br />
<br />
But everytime his pace slowed there was a crack of the reins or the lick of the crop to get him moving again. At least until they pulled up in front of a store with a swinging sign showing a goblet overflowing with purple-crimson wine. A man wearing a pair of shorts, boots, and an apron came out of the store and began to talk with Lyonus, but Alex paid it little heed. Greeting were exchanged followed by bargaining and haggling over prices, threats to take it to another purveyor, and a whole lot of posturing. Eventually it seemed like some sort of agreement was met, gold coins exchanged hands, and the shopkeeper called into the store where two burly young men came out and began carrying the barrels off the cart and into the store.<br />
<br />
Alex stared forlornly into the distance. He had been so lucky up to the point, having met men who wanted to help and protect him. He should have assumed there were those like Lyonus about as well. His thoughts were interrupted as he felt his harness being removed. He looked over to see Lyonus disconnecting him from the now empty cart, taking everything but the bit and bridle from him.<br />
<br />
The elf murmured a few words in the direction of the cart, his hands glowing blue as he did. The blue light enveloped the cart and it shrank down to the size of a toy, along with the harness. Lyonus picked it up and dropped it in a belt pouch. &quot;Sadly, I cannot shrink the cargo on the cart, limited magic you see.&quot; Alex tried to glare at the elf, but he didn&#39;t think the expression carried well as he only laughed.<br />
<br />
Grabbing the bridle, Lyonus led Alex on. Side by side they walked to another part of town. As they passed one street everything seemed to flip, sounds, smells. There were less humans here, though some wandered around, but most of the men walking here were of other races. Alex lost count of how many different species and races he saw. Were all those animal-folk different species? Was the minotaur with his human-like torso different from the bull man covered head to toe in short black fur. Questions swirled in his mind, questions he couldn&#39;t give voice to.<br />
<br />
&quot;The foreign district.&quot; Lyonus said as if reading Alex&#39;s mind. &quot;Though many of those living here were born in this town, humans always consider non-humans to be foreigners in their own cities.&quot; The disgust on the elf&#39;s tone was clear. &quot;But you know that, don&#39;t you, human?&quot; They came along a somewhat quiet and deserted stretch of street and stopped in front of an alley. He motioned for Alex to walk ahead. There wasn&#39;t enough room for him to turn around, but Lyonus still spoke from behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I am an elf of my word and I promised to return you to your two legs once I delivered my wares.&quot; There was a clinking of metal from behind him, and after a moment a leather pouch landed with a soft clink on the cobbles at his feet. &quot;Your coin purse, plus a few silver for your labor. Aren&#39;t I generous?&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard that strange singing language being spoke behind him. He looked back but could barely make out Lyonus, much less turn to get a better view. But that concern passed when he felt the now familiar fire racing through him. With a loud bray he dropped to the ground, all four legs trying to find purchase to pick himself back up and failing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I promised you two legs. Never what form that would take. Enjoy your new life, human.&quot; The sound of boots clicking on cobblestones was the only sign Lyonus had left, left Alex in an alley, writhing in pain as some strange arcane spell tore through him. His fingers dug into the stony ground as he tried to push himself up.<br />
<br />
Fingers. He had fingers. He focused on his hands. Yes, they were hands. Each one had two fingers and a thumb, each digit capped with a heavy black nail, but they were hands. The bones and muscles in his forelegs shifted, twisting back into arms, his shoulders shifting backwards as his chest started caving in. His barrel-like ribcage flattening out in the front to give him a more human like torso, his chest muscles reforming into a pair of large pectorals and his stomach hardening into abs. Despite shrinking down from his full size as a donkey, his muscles were even larger than they had been before his foray as a beast of burden, but the changes seemed to be slowing.<br />
<br />
He managed to sit up and lean back against the wall. His whole body was still covered in a bristly coat of dark gray, and his legs still looked like the hind legs of a donkey, hooves and all. Between those legs lay a fat, black-skinned sheath that held his still over-sized equine manhood that stuck out rock hard and well over a foot, coupled with a large pair of swaying gray-furred balls. His ropey, black-tufted tail lay draped over one of his heavily-muscled thighs. With a bray bursting from his throat, his cock unloaded a thick torrent of musky cum onto the ground. As it softened and retreated back into his sheath, he knew the spell had run its course. Did everything in this world have to make him cum?!<br />
<br />
He reached up and touched his face, and just as he feared everything there was still distinctly donkeyish. His muzzle was a bit shorter and his eyes faced a bit more forward, but that was the only thing human about his face. &quot;Why?&quot; His lips felt thick and clumsy, and his tongue and teeth too big, but he was able to speak, not that there was anyone around to hear.<br />
<br />
He reached out to grab the pouch the elf had tossed at him. It was the only thing he had left, after all. He was worse off than when he first came to this world he thought to himself. Once again naked and lost, but this time he didn&#39;t even have his old body. He wasn&#39;t even human. He could feel his ears drooping as he sat there, trying to think of what to do next.</p>
