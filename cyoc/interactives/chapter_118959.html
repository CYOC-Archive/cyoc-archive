<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few seconds were muffled speaking I couldn&#39;t hear them because of the blinding fear filling my heart. It was like a hammer pillaging down on my heart making each beat hurt. I could feel my blood run away from the heart an run back realising their mistake. I was in a complete frantic. My breathing was automatic, my blinking was automatic I just wish fear was automatic as well and could be turned off like that. <br />
<br />
I look to my left and wait for the green substance enter my body. But it doesn&#39;t come I look around and see people enter the room. Their voices become bearable again and I could hear them say. &quot;Oops nearly forgot the precautions&quot;. I felt a mask being put on my face. I couldn&#39;t resist against it i didn&#39;t even try. I felt the rough leather touch my skin. My vision has a black tint to it and through the squares I could see the people leaving the room. I had lost my chance. I could of asked them to stop. Whatever crime I did I could persuade them out of it. I had experience with this sort of thing but my body didn&#39;t I guess. <br />
<br />
I heard the door close and then the panic filled me again. I look to my right and even though its muffled I can hear the countdown. They were anchors of the sea. They were visible to my thoughts I could picture each number in slow motion as one disenetragted and another generated. It wasn&#39;t scary anymore it was welcome. Each passing of the number was sad but happy when the next came. The fear only started again When the happiness  ended and the sadness began. <br />
<br />
I look to my left again and see the green substance appear there. It wasn&#39;t welcome and as I saw it I felt my life as short as it was flash through my eyes. The green substance entered my arms and the pain began. I felt myself screaming automatically I couldn&#39;t stop it th pain was umimaginable to any of my past experiences. I had been ripped apart, cooked and raped but it was nothing compared to this. I felt my left arms grow in a panic frenzy like the muscles were screaming under my skin. And like my heart they bulged out not stopping. Faster and faster they grew. I could feel my veins filling with the venom they were changing shape greying bigger filling up and displacing more blood for artificial blood. My arms kept bulging outwards and it was agonising. Beneath the mask I could see nothing except sweat was building up from underneath it and making to glue more to my face.<br />
<br />
The blood was obviously being transported round my arteries as they went around my arms they then travelled to other places. I then screamed out even more the venom had entered my chest. It bulged and grew outwards my chest felt like a invisible force was pushing it out. In panic I tried reaching for it but felt my arms resisting like they were trying to resist the pain. It was all still growing I didn&#39;t know what to do. It felt like the pain wasn&#39;t coming from me but I was watching it. A transformation video with special effects and animation but it wasn&#39;t it was real. The pain and growth was real. My chest felt soar it kept growing out and out. My legs then joined the fray. My entire body was pinned to this torture. My legs outstretched by automatic I felt them crack as if trying to be as possible.<br />
<br />
The shackles on my arms felt tighter now. Before they ere just touching the bottom of my wrist but becuase of my massive growth I felt the coldness of the top of the shackles and I was still going. I could feel my wrist being crushed by the shackles. My chest was also growing massively as well the restraints on there were being pulled by my chest.<br />
<br />
Then a weird sensation filled my body like the feeling of when you flex energy fills your body like adrenaline. It felt good it felt like it was drowning the pain out. I reached for it I screamed for it I roared for it. I liked it every essence and drink of it filled my body my chest, arms and legs it was like a pain killer. It was addictive and it filled me with power. I pushed myself forward and back it came in pulses and I was attracted to it. I roared as the venom got filling my veins it wouldn&#39;t stop when would i. <br />
<br />
But I didn&#39;t want it to stop I wanted to have it forever the pain was long gone now it was a addiction I needed it I wanted it. I could then see the scenery return to me. I could get more later I thought to myself. I pulled my left arm forward and felt what felt like a rock under my arm it turned out to be muscles. I pulled the left shackle off. It was easy like ripping paper apart easy. I pulled the right one off as well the shackle ripped off as easy maybe more easy. As the venom entered my body it gave me more power. I wanted to see something. I pushed my chest forward and heard the leather restraints rip off. It felt good. Crazy good. I kept roaring not in fear but in excitement and adrenaline. I stood up and felt power in my legs in my arms and body. I flexed it off and continued doing it. <br />
<br />
I looked at the mirror and roared at it. But there were no one there. I growled and looked around. I couldnt remember being this strong before. But that could be because of the drug addictions of venom. I felt a brain wave enter my brain but then it disappeared. What is happening I thought. I realised that this drug did increase muscle size but destroyed that persons interllect. In any second I will feel not smart anymore. I felt my brain empty as if a heavy weight left my body. I looked around and could see no one. But then I saw it a fart hit the back of my neck and I could feel the room spin around me and I fell to ground making a loud noise as I fell.</p>
