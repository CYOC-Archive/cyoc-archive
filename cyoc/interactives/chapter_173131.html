<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim&#39;s world around him instantly shifted. The open sidewalk faded away in a flash, replaced with the interior of a building. His eyes blinked, as if trying to tell if he was hallucinating. When his eyesight did clear, it did not help his confusion. He had seemingly teleported to the gym which his wife attended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what the hell?&quot; Tim muttered aloud, noting how out of breath he now felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on girl, don&#39;t give up just yet!&quot; A voice rang out behind him.<br />
<br />
He turned, and facing him was one of Jennifer&#39;s friends, Lynda! She was wearing a slightly sweaty purple tank top, dark black yoga pants, and had her dark hair in a tight bun. She was smiling at Tim, seemingly unfazed as to how Tim had suddenly appeared in from of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynda, what&#39;s going on? How did I get here? Why, why am I so tired?&quot; Time muttered before sitting down on the nearest exercise machine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear, we might have pushed it.&quot; Lynda whispered. She leaned down and made eye contact with the confused Time. &quot;Just sit tight Jen, I&#39;l get you some water.&quot; She reassured Tim before jogging off.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if- wait, did she just call me... Jen?&quot; Tim thought confused out of his mind.<br />
<br />
He looked down, only to confuse himself even more. He was still himself. He could see his slightly puffy pecs, his clearly male figure, and even his large dick&#39;s outline was still visible. What confused him, was what his outline was in. He was wearing a gray tank top, similar to Lynda&#39;s but adjusted to his body. Not just that, but he was wearing yoga pants, which REALLY made his dick pop out.<br />
<br />
He began to panic a bit more, checking all over to see if he was really seeing what he thought he saw. He was still himself, but dressed totally like his wife! He could feel a bra underneath the tank top, gently poking against his chest, and from the wedgie he felt, he was also wearing a pair of panties. <br />
<br />
Weirdest of all was the hair. He still had his brown hair, the same texture of it and the slight graying remained, but now it was curly, tied up in a messy bun, and definitely would&#39;ve passed his shoulders if he let it down. Just like Jennifer&#39;s haircut. Even worse, he could feel that his entire body below the head was shaved clean.<br />
<br />
Just as he finished checking out his body, Lynda had returned with a large water bottle in hand.<br />
&quot;Here you go hun, how are you feeling?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
Tim quickly downed the water, wiped his mouth then stood up tall. He grabbed Lynda&#39;s shoulders and stared directly at her.<br />
&quot;Lynda, who am I?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Are you ok?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine just... humor me ok?&quot; He asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re... Jennifer Johnson, my best friend.&quot; She quietly responded. &quot;Jen, we might need to take you to the doctor you look white as a ghost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! No I&#39;m... I&#39;m good! Ha, I just had this... dizzy... spell. I&#39;m fine now, girl.&quot; He laughed off his behavior, trying his best to talk like his wife did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you positive? We&#39;ve been working pretty hard the last hour or so, and you said some pretty weird stuff.&quot; She responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure, you like, know how it is when you&#39;re exhausted and a little dehydrated ha!&quot; He bluffed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you sound better... just let me know if you&#39;re feeling dizzy again alright?&quot; Lynda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... girl.&quot; Tim responded with cringe. &quot;I just gotta pee real quick. Back in a flash!&quot; He laughed, speed walking off.<br />
<br />
Lynda watched her friend walk off. She was worried about her, but usually Jen told her when something was off, so she shrugged it off and started to stretch once more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tim walked through the gym towards the back, trying to piece together what had just happened. One second everything was fine, the next he was here! As he walked, he realized he was drawing some eyes. &quot;God, please don&#39;t tell me they all think I&#39;m some cross dresser or something.&quot; He thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey girl.&quot; A guy said as he walked by, giving Tim a wink.<br />
<br />
Tim recognized the guy as someone who frequented his favorite bar. He KNEW that guy was straight, and as he glanced around, he realized all the gaze here and there was from men. He knew his wife was a gorgeous woman, even for her age, but did they really see him as her?<br />
<br />
He reluctantly walked into the girls room, and quickly made sure no one was in any stall. Looking in the mirror, he found everything he had seen before was confirmed. Staring back at him was himself, if he was doing the perfect cosplay of his own wife. He checked his sweaty face, noting that he didn&#39;t even have a hint of facial hair left, pierced ears, and weirdly enough the little scar Jennifer had under her left ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, this needs to end, like yesterday.&quot; He muttered, reaching into his... or rather Jennifer&#39;s bra, where he had felt a phone previously. He pulled out Jennifer&#39;s phone, and quickly called his own cell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on come on...&quot; He muttered. <br />
<br />
*CLICK*<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, this isn&#39;t a good time.&quot; Jennifer&#39;s voice came from the other end.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god, Jennifer is that you?&quot; Tim asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Jennifer what&#39;re you talking about?&quot; Jennifer asked, as Tim&#39;s heart sank. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m almost at my meeting, and this is REALLY important to me, so please, no more calls.&quot; Jennifer whispered before hanging up quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Time whispered. &quot;She thinks she&#39;s me.&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
Tim stared at his reflection, wondering what the hell had happened, when he realized something that had slipped his mind previously. On his wrist still was the same watch he had bought at the shop. Every other article of clothing was that of his wife&#39;s but he was somehow still wearing that watch.<br />
<br />
As he recalled his fiddling with the watch just as the world seemed to shift, he realized it MUST have been the cause. Tim looked the watch over, carful not to touch it, and realized it only had a few numbers on it, with stiff arms which appeared to have limited movement. Then, on the side, was an obvious large button that he thought he might have pressed previously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell did I buy?&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen? You in there?&quot; He heard Lynda call out from the other side of the door.<br />
<br />
Tim&#39;s mind raced. He thought he knew how to work it, but what if he got it wrong? Would he be stuck like this? What about his interview? What of his family? Do they not remember the truth either? Should he wait? He didn&#39;t want to pretend to be his wife! Time had to act fast, finally deciding what to do as the door opened.</p>
