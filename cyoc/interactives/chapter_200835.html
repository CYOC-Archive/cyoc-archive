<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Two hours earlier <br />
<br />
Sasha exhaled, nervously glancing at the massive luxury hotel looming overhead. Obviously the prom committee had exceeded expectations this year.<br />
<br />
Despite an invite to join her friends in their limo, Sasha declined after Duke and her father surprised her. Returning home after school one day, the raven haired wizard was shocked when her father Joe and Duke presented her with a rebuilt Dodge Charger. <br />
<br />
Always a fan of muscle cars, Sasha was even happier when Duke told her he would be driving it to their prom, as long as she wanted to go with him. Sasha couldn&#39;t help but laugh at Duke&#39;s nervousnes. &quot;Of course I&#39;ll go with you Duke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Pulling up to the hotel in their midnight black Charger, Sasha now felt a wave of anxiety wash over her. &quot;You nervous?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha frowned, glancing over at her boyfriend. &quot;No,&quot; she grumbled. Sighing she now looked back at Duke, admiring her damphir boyfriends tuxedo. &quot;Okay maybe a little.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look great,&quot; Duke smiled. Sasha now flashed him a nervous smile, she could count the number of times she had dressed up like this on one hand. Blushing she now quietly thanked Duke, watching as the damphir now exited the car to open her door. Taking her hand, Duke couldn&#39;t help but gaze at his girlfriend. Adorned in a form fitting black dress, Sasha looked amazing. <br />
<br />
As the couple now entered the hotel lobby, they immediately noticed numerous classmates mingling. Scanning over the crowd a small smile now cracked across their faces as they noticed Ann and Jackie. &quot;Ann! Jackie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann now turned, flashing a smile at the approaching couple. Jackie had obviously used her ring as the former adult now reduced to an 18 year old.  The grown down adult sporting a lovely dark blue dress, which accented the blue highlights in her hair. &quot;Hey you two,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Was surprised you didn&#39;t come with the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duke surprised me with a ride,&quot; Sasha grinned. &quot;Didnt realize everyone else was here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah they got here a few minutes ago,&quot; Jackie stated. &quot;C&#39;mon I&#39;ll show you our table.&quot;<br />
<br />
Making their way inside, Sasha and Duke marveled at the layout of the ballroom. Large tables lined an expansive dance floor with a D.J. setup off to the side. As they now spotted their friends they waved before exchanging pleasantries.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gloria you look gorgeous.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you Sasha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Caleb I&#39;m surprised you&#39;re not wearing you hat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caleb now chuckled, the teenage demon hunter shrugging in response. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t go with the tux,&quot; he smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Told you it wouldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke now glanced down, noting Spark stick her head out of Calebs lapel pocket. The tiny green fairy gazing at the damphir excitedly.  &quot;Spark what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well had to see what this prom thing is all about,&quot; Spark stated. &quot;I mean Connors gonna take me in a few years and I keep hearing the after party is WILD!&quot;<br />
<br />
A collective chuckle now sounded amongst the group. Tonight was going to be fun.<br />
<br />
As the night wore on, Sasha, Duke, and their friends ate, danced and enjoyed the magic of Senior Prom. This would be one of their last and best memories of high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having a good time,&quot; Duke asked as he and Sasha slow danced. Sasha simply sighed, resting her head on Dukes shoulder. &quot;The best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know,&quot; Duke stated. &quot;They should be announcing the prom court soon. Any idea who will be on it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably Gloria and Adam,&quot; Sasha said. &quot;And a couple of snotty ass rich kids. You know how these things go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re my prom queen,&quot; Duke smirked. Sasha couldn&#39;t help but laugh, gently punching Duke in the arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Class of 2022 can I have your attention. It&#39;s time to announce West High&#39;s Prom Court!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha and Duke now paused in their dance, glancing towards the D.J. as the announcement was read. As expected Adam and another football player were named, with Adam being declared Prom King. Sasha and Duke couldn&#39;t help but smile as Adam now raised his hand in victory, yelling to Felicia his eternal love, much to the blonde teens embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Felicia loves the attention secretly,&quot; Duke laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah but she&#39;s too shy to admit it,&quot; Sasha added.<br />
<br />
As the crowd now began to settle, all eyes rested on the D.J as he now readied himself to announce which two girls would be joining Adam on the Prom Court.<br />
<br />
&quot;And joining the court for 2022 are. Gloria Turner and Sasha Sampson!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What,&quot; Sasha exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Sasha was dumbfounded as she now gaped at her classmates. In all her time in high-school she would have never thought that she would have been voted onto the prom court. Nervously she now glanced at Duke, the damphir beaming with pride as he encouraged her forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sasha,&quot; Gloria squealed. &quot;Oh my God we made the court!&quot; Sasha simply smiled nervously, completely out of her element as she now stood before the entire senior class. &quot;Glo I&#39;m freaking out up here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be fine Sasha,&quot; Gloria smiled. &quot;Just enjoy the moment.&quot; Sasha simply nodded, taking her friends hand as they awaited the announcement of Prom Queen.<br />
<br />
A million thoughts now raced through Sasha&#39;s mind. No way she would be Prom Queen. She was the tough girl,  the rebel, thw girl that had always gotten in trouble. She never thought she was pretty. That is until she met Duke.<br />
<br />
Duke made her believe in herself, he thought she was the most beautiful thing in the world. If she became Prom Queen  then maybe, just maybe, she would feel justified in being worthy of Dukes love. For a moment, being named Prom Queen seemed like the most important thing in the world.<br />
<br />
&quot;This years Prom Queen is Gloria Turner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha smiled, giving her best friend a hug. She was torn emotionally, part of her was happy to see Gloria win yet another part felt absolutely defeated. What was she thinking believing she could have been Prom Queen. As Gloria now stepped forward to accept her crown, Sasha now stepped away making her way towards a side room.<br />
<br />
Entering the room, Sasha let out a sigh before wiping her eyes. She was sad at losing, angry with herself for being upset over losing, and crying because of the entire situation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sasha?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha now glanced upwards, sniffing as her date now approached. &quot;Sasha why are you crying,&quot; Duke asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know its stupid,&quot; she whispered, wiping her eyes. &quot;Why am I crying over this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Was going to ask the same thing,&quot; Duke said softly. &quot;I mean, you made the court. That&#39;s incredible. You should be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha simply nodded, gazing into her damphir boyfriends magenta eyes. &quot;This is gonna sound dumb but I wanted that crown.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; she sniffed. &quot;Because, I&#39;ve never felt pretty. I&#39;ve never felt like I was good enough for you Duke. You&#39;re the most amazing, handsome person I&#39;ve ever met. I love you Duke. And, I don&#39;t know its dumb, but...if I was Queen then maybe, just maybe the whole school would know that I was good enough for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke now gazed at his girlfriend, watching as Sasha cried softly. He had known that Sasha was a little self conscious but he had never believed that she felt she needed something to prove herself to him. Gently he now lift her chin, wiping her eyes before placing a gentle kiss on her lips. &quot;I&#39;ve alway thought you were beautiful,&quot; he smiled. &quot;You never need to prove anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the couple now embraced, they were puzzled as they heard the door close. Turning Duke now spotted Wyatt, Kyra, and an auburn haired teen that looked very familiar. &quot;Hey Wyatt,&quot; he called. &quot;Whats up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt said nothing, a sinister smile spreading across his face. This was too perfect, Duke having separated himself from the others. Now he, Kyra, and Cassidy gazed at the outsider prince, anxiously waiting to spring their trap.<br />
<br />
Duke and Sasha never saw it coming. One moment, the pair was standing with one another. The next moment Sasha was knocked unconscious, collapsing ti the floor as Duke now found himself lifted into the air by his throat. Struggling, Dukes eyes went wide as he gazed into the dead eyes of his father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello my son,&quot; Miro snarled, tightening his iron grip on Dukes throat. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you!&quot;</p>
