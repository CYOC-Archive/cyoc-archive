<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On a different side of town, on a small farm, the men of the Adler household sit on the couch and watch TV. “Officials are still unsure of what caused this viral in- um, in-fect-EON to spread.” The strawberry-blonde news anchor struggles to read off the teleprompter.<br />
“I hope mom’s okay,” I say, with concern in my voice, knowing that she’s miles away on a business trip. <br />
William is the eldest of the boys, 22 years old, and is living at home until he can afford his own place. He is 5’10” and on the chubby side but he still enjoys running. He has grown his curly brown hair out and has gotten a septum piercing, much to his father’s disapproval. He loves playing video games and is the most liberal of the Adlers. <br />
“She’s fine. This is all just fake news made up by those homos in the government,” says Mike as he angrily grabs the remote and changes the channel to a football game. <br />
Mike is 50 and is the father of the household. He is 6’0” and around 250 pounds with the quintessential dad bod of hair everywhere and a beard. Mike likes drinking beer and watching football with his buddies. William would describe him as homophobic but Mike didn’t care, it wasn’t natural. He would get into long fights with Will about how he looked and dressed “like a fag.”<br />
Not caring to watch sports with my homophobic father, I go up to check on my twin brothers, Jack and John. <br />
Jack and John are 19 and inseparable. The two brothers are each other&#39;s best friends and they do everything together, they always play video games together, they are committed to the same university, and they love trolling LGBTQ+ websites, live streams, and chat servers. At 6’0&#39;&#39; each the two skinny brunette boys don’t have much muscle, as they prefer cardio over lifting weights. They both tend to agree with their father politically and socially, mostly because that’s all they’ve been taught. They don’t hate Will as much as their father but they still tease his “gay” behavior occasionally.<br />
	I walk into the game room to see the twins on their computers in the middle of a match of some FPS. “How are things up here?” I ask. “Shut the fuck up queer, can’t you see we’re in the middle of a competitive match?!” shouts John while Jack throws an empty plastic bottle at me trying to get me to leave. With that, I sigh and close the door and go to his room.<br />
	“Can’t wait to be stuck in quarantine with these upstanding gentlemen,” I say to myself. I lie down on my bed and pull out my phone and open Twitter. I scroll through the headlines. “STRANGE VIRUS CAUSING CRAZY SEXU-” *scroll* “COLLEGE CAMPUS FLOODED WITH SE-” *scroll* “VIRUS MAY AFFECT ANIM-” I close the app. “Maybe it is all just some conspiracy,” I thought to myself. Just then the family dog, a German shepherd sporting a blue collar with the name Leo inscribed on the tag, pushes my door open and jumps up on my bed. “Hey buddy,” I say, petting him and drifting off to sleep.<br />
	The next morning, I wake up and roll out of bed, trying not to wake Leo. I put on my shoes and go out to get the mail from the mailbox. “Looks like it rained last night,” I say looking at the still wet ground and trees. “Goddammit,” I say loudly, looking at the crooked mailbox. It looks like some fucking jackasses came and tried to knock it over last night. I bend down and pick up the wet mail. “Gross,” I say while trying to shake off the… wetness. I walk over to the small stable they have in their backyard to go feed the horse. “Listen here, little shit, if you’re gonna live here you have to do chores,” Mike’s words echo in my head as I walk into the stable. I am greeted by a large head poking through a stall window. “Hey, Cash.” I pat the large horse’s head. Mike had bought Cash as a mid-life crisis purchase and lost all interest in him in a couple weeks. Despite not being a huge fan of having to do chores like cleaning up after a beast like this, Cash was sweet and I’ve learned to love him after all, the barn has become the place I go to when I need to escape my dad and the twins. I’ll come and sit on a haybale and cry and rant to no one, well, no one except for Cash, about how much I hated my family. The big brown and tan speckled stallion with his orange bandana had become one of my most trusted confidants alongside Leo. I chuckle to myself realizing how dumb and kind of pathetic that is. Whatever, I shrug and walk over to the bin where they keep the oats and I bend down to grab the scoop. *Slip* A few of the sopping envelopes and magazines slip out from underneath my arm and land in the bin of oats. “Fuck.” I bend down and grab them and shake them off. I then grab the scoop and scoop up oats and pour them into Cash’s bowl. Cash eats them up diligently. I pat Cash’s head and neck, “Thanks for being here for me, big guy.”<br />
I then head back up to the house. I see Dad pouring himself a cup of coffee. I put the mail on the kitchen counter. “What the fuck, William?!” exclaims Mike angrily looking at the wet and oat-covered mail. “Can’t even do basic chores right?!” “Well maybe if you actually helped me instead of making me do everything by myself this morning, this wouldn’t have happened,” I replied, curtly. “You little shit, is this what they teach you in college these days? How to disrespect the MAN of the house? I swear all those places fill your head with billshi- LEO NO!” Mike yells at Leo after jumping on the counter and grabbing the newspaper off the stack of mail. Mike turns his anger on me, “Go get it from him for fucks sake!” I sigh and run after the runaway shepherd. <br />
“LEO!!! LEOOOO!!!! Where are you, you dumb dog?” After looking for him for 10 minutes, I call it quits and go back up to my room. I walk in and see Leo asleep on my bed with scraps of a now-eaten newspaper strewn about the room. Damn it, Leo. I pick up the remaining pieces and throw them away. I lay in bed next to Leo and pet him. Leo wakes up and pounces on me and licks my face. “Hey, boy, stop it!” I push Leo off me. “Gross your tongue went in my mouth!” I wipe the slobber off my face.<br />
The rest of the day is uneventful, I do the rest of the chores without the help of the rest of the family of course. I go up to his room and take a shower. “Leo must’ve shed all over the bed today,” I remarked seeing a bunch of hair wash down the drain. I get out of the shower and look at myself in the mirror. <br />
Will has always been self-conscious about his small cock, it drove him to always wear underwear while in the shower in locker rooms in high school, but today he felt a bit better about it for some reason. <br />
“It’s actually kind of cute,” I say to myself while shaking the 3 inches. “That diet looks like it&#39;s working too!” I look at myself in the mirror, noticing that I appear to have lost a few inches off my now hairless stomach. After that, I dry off and get into his bed with Leo missing from his usual spot at the foot of my bed. Despite Jack and John yelling and shouting homophobic slurs at their computer screens all night, I drifted off to sleep.<br />
“Hey, Slut.” A disembodied voice speaks. <br />
“Hello?” I reply.<br />
“Good, you already know what you are.” <br />
The words flow like honey into my ears making me shudder and let out a small whimper. I now notice that my small cock is rock-hard and leaking.<br />
“Who are you?”<br />
“Do not concern yourself with that, my little slut.” <br />
I shudder and whimper again, pre drooling out of my cock.<br />
“But-”<br />
“QUIET, SLUT!” <br />
I shudder again and nearly fall to my knees as my cock surges. Pre now freely flowing from my aching hard-on. I can’t speak anymore! Why not? Master says I can’t. Wait, Master?<br />
“Now listen to me, slut,” the disembodied voice interrupts my internal dialogue, “You are going to become a perfect little cock-addicted whore whose job it is to please every cock bigger than yours. Which, with that little nub, will be pretty much everyone you see.” <br />
I was so confused but so horny I couldn’t think right. I must obey my Master, I tell myself. WHAT AM I THINKING. I CAN’T JUST-<br />
“Now go, I will see you again soon, slut.”</p>
