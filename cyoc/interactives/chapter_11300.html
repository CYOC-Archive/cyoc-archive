<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mrs.Farnsworth and nancy returned home and for weeks and weeks there after Nancy was argued at by her Mother. The Middleton Police had called asking questions since a neighbor had reported Mr. singleton as missing. <br />
<br />
Now Nancy's foolish story had some possibility but Mrs. Farnsworth kept saying over and over, &quot;I'll never believe that fool story till my dying day, disgusted am I and shall remain unhappy with you till your dear Uncle is found!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Farnsworth's personal disgust was giving Nancy a lot of sorrowful days. Meanwhile back near Middleton her Uncle now taking her place as a jenette mule was on cold nights wondering when his trade wish would be over? His days and nights being a mule were making him feel oddly satisfied. He was beginning to slip into the mindset of a mule and mule's life. His male desires were already gone and replaced by those of the female gender mule. He'd flay his rear in any male horse of mule's face making them lustful.<br />
<br />
Indeed Singleton himself was finding the occasional fucking from a stallion to be very enjoyable. He would at late night when placed in a stall think back and shudder to think of remaining as a mule much longer.<br />
<br />
Through these many weeks Nancy had toyed with the Medallion as she learned how best to use it's wonderous power.<br />
<br />
As Nancy did not have a car of her own and dear Mother still angered by the missing Uncle and Nancy's fool story, nancy had to take the city bus where or when she needed to go anywhere.<br />
<br />
The bus line offered her travel about the city and connection to the rail commuter line. It was one warm afternoon when while on the train Nancy was taunted by four teenage boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell's Bell Gang, thats us four and we do as we damn please! You there sweetheart we decided needed some care and comfort travelling alone!&quot; said Tyrone the leader of these four young monsters.<br />
<br />
Nancy thanked them for their concern, not wishing to anoy them with bad manners. Yet Tyrone kept coming on and soon plopped down next to Nancy. He smiled as his nasty three friends stood guard giving stares at othe riders in the coach, as if to say &quot;Stay the hell away!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy fought with Tyrone to keep his filthy hands off her. She began to actually fight him with her small fists flying about and as she screamed for help.<br />
<br />
Tyrone got very demanding and soon had his hand digging through Nancy's waistband of her slacks as he told her she would calm down after a good hand fucking. She screamed all the more for hs to stop as in the maylay she remembered the Medallion.<br />
<br />
Nancy had used it only once thus far and was when she had used it made her appualled at what occured. A friend named Tina Bayoun had Nancy over at her parents lake cottage home. The two girls both of the same age had spent a fun day together when in the evening as they sat watching the Sun set and feeling very meloncoly, it was Nancy who asked the prime question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tina, if you could be anyplace else or as anyone else what would you choose?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nancy remembered yet the smile which broadened over the girlfriend's face as her imagination worked of the wonderous question. &quot;You'll think me crazy, but here you go! I'd love to be an Equestrian Thorourghbred horse and live maybe a year doing whatever I please!&quot; announced Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;A horse?&quot; asked Nancy back as she had some knowledge of what being equine and a jenette mule felt like and for her it wasn't all that neat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you it was silly but I remember my Aunt Eleanor and her stables down in Florida. She had this wonderful horse named Angelica! She was a tall Thorourghbred mare, a flax golden mane and tail with dark seal brown hair covering a body taunt with muscles and filled with electric power to vault over any barrier, wow I thought that horse to be just a wonderful wonder, yup that should be me, if it were only possible!&quot; explained Tina.<br />
<br />
Nancy sat there and then asked, &quot;If it were possible would you really, really dear friend want to become a Thoroughbred mare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina starred, &quot;How!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By this!&quot; said Nancy as she pulled out of her pocket the Medallion she'd seen Uncle Singleton rub and wish her to be a jennette mule.<br />
<br />
&quot;That, what's that!&quot; asked Tina getting edgy.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a wish coin given, well it was my Uncle's and now it's mine!&quot; announced Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your making fun of me, your not being nice, Nancy!&quot; grumbled Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it does wonders, I know! Now stand up and I'll show, or grant you your wish, if really being a horse is your true desire?&quot; said Nancy as Tina slowly stood up and looked a little scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's going to happen?&quot; asked Tina in a shaky scared tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we have to sent the spell correctly unless you would prefer being a horse the rest of your life! I mean we have to put a whereas so you can return to this you at some future time.&quot; explained Nancy.<br />
<br />
&quot;At the end of Summer?&quot; asked Tina.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I think something more direct!&quot; said Nancy as the girls thought it through.<br />
<br />
&quot;I could be a filly and when coming into season change back!' suggested Tina.<br />
<br />
Nancy agreed but did not understand what coming into season meant, she thought it was when a filly matured to a mare. never-the-less both agreed and Tina stood with her arms out straight and eyes closed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead dear friend do it!&quot; said Tina still not believing Nancy but willing to play along in go friendly fun.<br />
<br />
Nancy sat up and talking out the Medallion began to rub it watching the bobble shine, then glow brighter and brighter.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for my good freind Tina Bayoun to become a dark seal brown haired, golden flaxen colored mane and tailed Thoroughbred Filly, and to remain as her horse self till coming into season as a mare, and at that time to return to her human self remembering her time as a horse!&quot; spelled Nancy as Tina's eyes popped open.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no you got it mixed up, when a filly comes in season not as a<br />
 M-A-R-E !&quot; said Tina as the Medallion's power rushed around her.<br />
<br />
Nancy sat there watching, thinking she'd done it right as Tina's face turned darker and darker from a lovely tan to jet black. The seal colored hairs sprouted over her face and with the changing skin color it continued down her neck and everywhere.<br />
<br />
Tina began to thrash about as clothing got horribily tight. Rip and tare the clothing began to drop away as her thighs bloomed broad and a rump so cute grew to massive buttocks of a young filly. <br />
<br />
Arms changed as bones snapped and set into place. Fingers and toes merged quickly making sound and solid hoofs for Tina the Thoroughbred to stand upon.<br />
<br />
As Tina's head strained out into a long face of a horse she whenced in a pain and whinnied a high pitched scream. her neck grew longer and soon filled in the pattern as the changes slowed till a wonderous filly stood flicking it's tail and nickered at Nancy's ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked!&quot; exclaimed Nancy seeing before her a young filly and no sign of Tina.<br />
<br />
A whinnie and then a screaming neighing came from a scared but very changed young girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you asked for it dear Tina your a filly Thoroughbred horse, seal brown hair, golden flax colored mane and tail, and more beautiful than I was when a Mule!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tina though was feeling very undecided about her standing naked and having become this horse and animal form. She turned to look at her far more massive body and watched as her tail flicked about with it long hairs touching a very sensual rear.<br />
<br />
It got very late and around midnight Nancy asked where Tina would like to be bedded down? The Filly just stopped and stood very quiet, she had never given a thought to their games and with thinking of being kept in a stable was suddenly a horrid thought.<br />
<br />
Tina got very nervous the more Nancy asked where she might take her Filly friend to sleep and stay. Tina thought of only one stable that was near by and she didn't like it as a human let alone as her being a horse there. The place was always dirty and smelled very bad, the stalls were clean only on a weekly basis and mostly she hated to even go there for riding lessons.<br />
<br />
Nancy was thinking of another place, a friend she knew who had two horses and kept them in a small barn. So nancy walked along and told Tina to follow. At first the Filly balked at walking anywhere and would if she could say it ask to be changed back into her young human self.<br />
<br />
Alas, she had no choice now, she was indeed a Filly and a horse. Tina plodded along behind nancy as she walked the dark streets to her friend Sandy Alley and her small farm.<br />
<br />
The snap of the gate latch made Tina whinnie a sad cry as she felt then trapped by body and a fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you stay here and I'll talk with Sandy in the morning. I'll ask her to keep you here till a Filly comes into season, now stay here and be quiet!&quot; said Nancy almost as an order.<br />
<br />
Nancy left Tina wandering around the small paddock and went her merry way back to home thinking of what other wonders the Medallion might hold.<br />
<br />
As that first long night drifted along Tina began to have true Filly horse feelings as equine instincts began to take hold. Her first note was to sniff at piles of manure till in one terroized nibble she watched her own big lips nips a chunk of manure and bring it into her mouth.<br />
<br />
Her natural inclination was to chew and swallow, even though she really desired to spit it out due to the yuck'o taste or even the thought of eating horseshit. Yet with an easy swallow it went down the hatch and she shuddered to think what other nasty things being a horse might make her do.<br />
<br />
As time wore on Tina began out of either nervous feelings or maybe those deepening equine instincts but she soon became rather accomplished in grazing. The simple task of grazing made the night fly by till with sun up, came a voice.<br />
<br />
Nancy's friend Sandy was up at the crack of dawn every morning for her two mile run. Yet as she opened the dutch doors for each of her prize Palaminos to look out at the morning she saw a filly grazing alone in the paddock.<br />
<br />
Sandy jumped the gate and walked cautiously toward the Filly. Tina seeing the approach of a girl like she was turned and saunted over for some friendly nickering and loving pats from Sandy.<br />
<br />
It was almost noon when Nancy pulled herself out of bed, a long late night made her sleep late. As she brushed her teeth and combed long hairs filled with snags the thought of Tina at Sandy's made her run for the phone.<br />
<br />
She called Sandy's house and on the fifth ring her mother answered. Nancy asked to talk with Sandy but her mother told her she and her father were outside as they found a strange mare in the pasture this morning. Before Nancy tried to explain the lady excused herself and hung up the phone.<br />
<br />
Nancy got ready and running down stairs begged her mother to drive her to Sandy's. As usual her mother declined still angry over nancy's wild story about being changed into a jenette mule by her Uncle.<br />
<br />
So out to the garage and on her bike she did peddle and fly. A half hour away a young Filly was getting fitted with her first set of steel shoes, a bridle, bit, and a harness for use witha sulky cart.<br />
<br />
When at last Nancy came closer to Sandy's house she saw her friend Tina now a filly being harnessed to a small cart and with Sandy sitting behind snapping the reins.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there Nancy!' yelled Sandy as Tina pulling she swooped by at a full trot.<br />
<br />
Nancy stopped and watched her friend teaching another good friend how to live and work as a horse. Those were dark days and weeks to Nancy as she only on rare occasions came to visit Tina.<br />
<br />
The Filly grew both in size and strength as she matured. The summer passed and Nancy returned to school as her problems there took her thoughts, Tina was learning her lessons well.<br />
<br />
It was late March when Sandy called and asked Nancy to come over. Nancy thought of her friend Tina wondering how she farred the Winter months.<br />
<br />
A short ride on her bike had her chilled but looking forward to a visit with Sandy and Tina. As she came into the long driveway her first sight was of Tina standing with the stallion Palamino sniffing her now much larger rear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tina!&quot; exclaimed Nancy.<br />
<br />
Tina did not answer to her name and stood with head hung low and tail moving slowly as the stallion tended to her rump.<br />
<br />
Nancy stood by her bike at the fence while she watched in horror as the stallion's big cock fell out his sheath and became very erect. Tina was quiet and then held her tail high and to one side. The stallion took his que and with a forelegged bound her came to straddle Tina's big rear.<br />
<br />
A slow waddled walk had the stallion moving closer till with a slight jump of Tina's head Nancy watched with tear filled eyes as the stallion took away Tina's virginity. Nancy cried at the sight as the stallion soon jolted his head and screamed a whinnie of domination when his cock unloaded into the young mare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nancy!&quot; came a yell from Sandy as she waved her to come up the drive.<br />
<br />
As Nancy came near Sandy, her friend said, &quot; I think it's wonderful when a filly comes of age and season!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Season?' asked Nancy remembering the spell that made Tina a horse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, season, it's when a filly or soon to be mare feels the heat of their sexual passion. Oh Pegasus there won't make her pregnant with one shot, it take sometimes several but at least her feelings of passion for now will be quelled and her training for being a good equestrian jumper can begin again.&quot; explained Sandy.<br />
<br />
It was shortly after that when Tina seeing her good friends by the gate plodded over her tail swiping the draining juices and semen off her soiled rear.<br />
<br />
Nancy was almost in tears as Tina approached the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good girl there Tina!&quot; said Sandy as Nancy's mouth droped open.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yea, I forgot to tell you I named the filly Tina after Tina Bayoun who disappeared last Fall, you remember it was in all the papers. Well this Filly just showed up out of the blue heavens and Daddy said we should keep her and train for the coming Equestrian trials, I applied for the Olympics.&quot; told Sandy as Nancy looked into Tina's large round brown eyes. <br />
<br />
All this came to mind as nancy grabbed for the Medallion while Tyrone had her fingers dancing in her privates.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like fucking girls?&quot; she asked in a sultery sort of way.<br />
<br />
Tyrone stopped his feeling and looked at her with a note of stunned delight. &quot;Yes, I like getting into a pretty girls pussy!&quot; replied Tyrone as his three friends giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I get off at Bensenville, how about the five of us having some fun, I know a good place!&quot; offered Nancy.<br />
<br />
Tyrone kept his fingers daning about Nancy's pussy while the other's stood and watched licking their lips for a chance. When the train arrived a Nancy's town station the five got off with other passengers cold stares.<br />
<br />
A walk out the station and down the street had Nancy leading the gang to a perfect place. As Nancy opened the door Tyrone looked at the sign out front and grabbed her wrist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take it easy, we can go upstairs, I know the owner, it's going to be fun!&quot; said Nancy in as seductive a manner as she could muster.<br />
<br />
Thr five went inside and Nancy began to rub the Medallion. Through the store and down a long hallway the five walked as the boys began to look around and wondered.<br />
<br />
Nancy turned to the boys asking, &quot;What's each of your's first name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyrone looked to one as he said, &quot;Gus!&quot; Then another said, &quot;Franko!&quot; and the third smiled and replied, &quot;Paul!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish for my friends Gus, Paul, and Franko to become Doberman bitches in heat and Tyrone as their stud Doberman dog for a fucking good time!&quot; spelled Nancy as one by one the boys' faces began to change.<br />
<br />
Even at the sight Tyrone screamed his cursing curse at Nancy, but his words drained off to groans and growls.<br />
<br />
Not long after the Doberman gang was all engorsed with sexual play as Tyrone's knot was burried deep into Gus the bitch. Paul and Franko now dogs too stood by waiting with anxious delight for their turn with Tyrone.  <br />
<br />
As the gang waddled down the alley and into their new lives as Dobermans Nancy stood with her fingers poked deep delighting herself and finding new thrills in her sensual private parts.<br />
<br />
Over the course of the next three months Nancy found and helped place several dogs through the pet store there in Bensenville. she would smile and think about articles in the local paper of stories about a growing menece of a pack of Doberman dogs running loose in Downtown Chicago. Nancy wondered how Tyrone found his knot to be a pleasure?<br />
<br />
A year passed and Nancy was caught up in school and dates when her Mother called for her to answer the phone.<br />
<br />
It was a call from Mrs. Bayoun, she announced her daughter Tina had come home. She begged for Nancy to come and visit as she was such good friends with Tina till she had disappeared.<br />
<br />
The phone call was both blessing and fearful as Tina, what she went through, would she might want to do to Nancy for get even!</p>
