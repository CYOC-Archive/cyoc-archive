<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few days passed relatively uneventfully: David went to the gym all day, returning home later that <br />
night, then flexed in the mirror, jerked off and slept. He’d started eating more, going from three meals a day <br />
at the start to six now, and he had a huge craving for protein, however he could get it. Eggs, chicken and <br />
fish had become staples, and carbs and fats had gone right out the window. David couldn’t explain why but he’d <br />
just lost the taste for them.<br />
<br />
Whenever he saw himself now, the first thing he thought was: ‘fuck, I look GOOD’. His hair was getting a <br />
little long but was nicely tousled, and he hadn’t shaved since the start of his changes giving him a rugged <br />
look. And his body had grown to a size best described as: huge. His shoulders looked as though bowling balls <br />
had been shoved under the skin; his traps were enormous and came close to obscuring his neck; his pecs were <br />
spherical mounds of muscle; his abs a powerful eight-pack; his biceps at least 22 inches; his ass a round <br />
bubble which looked awesome in everything he wore; his legs massive tree trunks. His hands and feet had grown <br />
too to match his new huge body, but his dick and balls had stopped growing at just over a foot long hard and <br />
eight inches in girth. Even soft he was a mammoth nine inches, which was quite difficult to conceal. ‘Thank <br />
God I’m not any bigger’, thought David, as if it had got much bigger it’d be impossible to use it for anything <br />
useful.<br />
<br />
However, by the end of the third week, David was starting to feel a bit tired of marvelling over his own body. <br />
Or rather, of him being the person doing the marvelling. So on the Friday evening in a fit of horniness he <br />
decided to turn on his computer’s webcam, and flex on video. He pulled some double bis, showed off his triceps <br />
and his pecs, his big meaty ass, and he jerked off at the end of the video, showing off his enormous meat. He <br />
put it on one of the muscle worship websites online, and saw the adoring comments rolling in: how other people <br />
wished they looked like him and wanted to do things to him. Even though he’d just cum, these comments really <br />
turned David on again. But he had started to feel funny. There was a tightness in his chest and across his <br />
stomach, quickly turning to a burning sensation. His cock was hard as diamonds and leaking pre all over. ‘This <br />
must be it,’ David realised, ‘This must be what needing to change someone else feels like’.<br />
<br />
Without really realising it, he grabbed his phone and texted the person on the top of his contact list to come <br />
over: Alex. He felt really bad for this but he needed to fuck someone, needed to pass the virus on. As he put <br />
down his phone he realised he was shaking. A reply came very quickly,<br />
<br />
‘in the area now, be over in ten mins, alex’<br />
<br />
David started pacing the room: the passing seconds felt like hours. He was sweating and shaking, his cock so <br />
hard it was hurting. But he also had a period of mental clarity: he knew just how to get Alex to do what was <br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a knock at the door, and David ran over and opened it, seeing Alex standing there. He was <br />
wearing a tight vest which showed off his muscled upper body and a tribal tattoo on his left arm.<br />
<br />
“Jared?” Alex asked when the door opened, “I got a message from David asking to meet, where is he?”<br />
<br />
“Oh he’ll be back soon...” David replied, “Come in.”<br />
<br />
“Are you ok? You look terrible,” Alex observed as he sat down on the couch while David locked the door.<br />
<br />
“Just catching David’s flu I guess...Alex can I ask you something?”<br />
<br />
Alex nodded and David continued, “How do you think I look?”<br />
<br />
“Erm...pretty good I guess. Huge. I mean, to be honest, I wish I was just about your size, I always wanted to <br />
be huge.” Alex was a little surprised as the words came out of his mouth. Until he’d been in Jared’s presence, <br />
he’d never thought about being bigger before...had he?<br />
<br />
Bingo, David thought, “You obviously take care of your body. You look good too by the way, hope it’s ok to say <br />
that. How would you feel if I could tell you a way you could look better than that with no effort?”<br />
<br />
Alex looked confused, “I’d say you’re deluded. Takes a lot of hard work to look as good as this,” he replied <br />
as he flexed a bicep.<br />
<br />
David’s pants tented a little as he continued, “I’m not kidding Alex,” (he’d guessed that’s what deluded <br />
meant) “I used to be a little guy like David, but then I found out this secret and grew like crazy. There’s a <br />
little catch, but it’ll all come together.”<br />
<br />
Alex looked cautious and asked, “What do I have to do?”<br />
<br />
David smiled and pulled out his huge cock, “Suck my dick,” he said.<br />
<br />
Alex jumped up, “What the fuck man? Dude that’s sick...put it away,” he said when David still hadn’t put it <br />
back in his pants.<br />
<br />
“I’ve a little secret for you. My name’s not actually Jared, and David’s not actually sick. I’m David.”<br />
<br />
Alex looked incredulous for a moment, then stared at his face and everything fell into place, “Holy shit! I <br />
thought it was just a family resemblance but that’s too fucking close...Shit! Fuck David, how did you get so <br />
huge in three fucking weeks?!”<br />
<br />
“You want to be this big don’t you Alex?”<br />
<br />
Alex looked unsure for a moment, “Well, yeah, but....”<br />
<br />
David interrupted, “So suck my dick, and you will be,” David knew this was a lie as he didn’t have a clue how <br />
Alex would turn out, but he needed to change him soon.<br />
<br />
Alex hesitated, but slowly came over and slid his tongue along David’s huge cock.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm yes Alex, suck on daddy’s shaft,” David had never thought about calling himself ‘daddy’ before but it <br />
kinda suited the moment.<br />
<br />
Alex was obviously not enjoying it, but thankfully for him David needed a quick release. After just a few <br />
minutes he felt it building and warned him, “OK Alex, you ready? You gotta swallow buddy, OK?”<br />
<br />
Alex didn’t respond – too busy trying not to be sick – but as David came in moans of ecstasy he dutifully <br />
swallowed all of David’s hot salty cum. He then rose and said, “OK David, what the fuck is this?”<br />
<br />
David tried to explain everything that had happened over the last three weeks: his absence from the group; his <br />
growth; how he got fired; how he turned gay – everything. But he got a bit muddled and broke off halfway <br />
through, so Alex had to ask some questions.<br />
<br />
“So..what, I’m going to get bigger now?”<br />
<br />
“It’ll take like three weeks, but yeah.”<br />
<br />
“And I’m going to be gay?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry Alex...but I had to.”<br />
<br />
Alex scowled at him, “What do you mean you had to?! You can change anyone in the whole fucking city, why the <br />
fuck did you pick me?! I don’t wanna be gay! I didn’t think you did either!”<br />
<br />
“That’s what I’m trying to say, I didn’t. But through these few weeks...I dunno man, it just kinda <br />
happened...and I like it. Can’t really figure out why I liked girls before, you know?”<br />
<br />
Alex was clearly unhappy, “No, but I will soon right? Fuck this, I’m leaving.”<br />
<br />
As Alex turned to go David stood up to stop him but just then, he felt light-headed. All the blood had rushed <br />
from his head and he looked pale as a sheet. He started to sway.<br />
<br />
“Dude...are you ok?” Alex wasn’t sure what was happening. Should he still leave?<br />
<br />
David collapsed onto the couch and started to breathe really heavily, his huge chest rising and falling fast <br />
with the effort of getting so much air into his lungs. His clothes were soaked with sweat, he was moaning in <br />
pain, his knuckles white from how hard he was gripping the couch. Alex grabbed the phone and was about to dial <br />
911 when he heard a rip. He turned back to look at David, and saw that his vest had ripped across his pecs.<br />
<br />
“Fuck, you’re growing more!” Alex murmured in shock.<br />
<br />
He could only watch as David swelled even bigger, his shoulders growing ever broader, his stomach creasing up <br />
into tighter crevices, his arms bulging with even more thick ropes of muscle. Before long his pants ripped too <br />
across his growing thighs, and along his calves not long after – even his crotch bulged a little more. His new <br />
muscle mass was twitching with the effort of growing so much in such a short time, his pecs were bouncing <br />
involuntarily, and his arms were bouncing in spasms too. Soon the colour started to return to David’s face, <br />
his new growth subsided and he levered himself off the couch, staring Alex straight in the eye.<br />
<br />
Alex didn’t know what to say. He’d just witnessed his former friend adding about thirty pounds of muscle in <br />
the space of a minute or two. Eventually, he worked up to saying:<br />
<br />
“Are...are you alright?”<br />
<br />
In response, David grabbed his vest in both hands and ripped it from his larger torso, then did the same with <br />
his pants. Standing there naked, Alex could see it wasn’t his dick that had made is pants’ crotch swell more: <br />
David’s balls had grown to be nearly as big as lemons. He was also almost completely smooth now, with only a <br />
slight covering of pubic hair, the rest had all gone. His body was amazing: tanned and smooth, covered in <br />
thick muscle, huge pecs, defined 8-pack and great v-taper. David turned (obviously knowing he was showing off <br />
for Alex) and displayed his enormous back, so huge it looked as though Alex could lay across it with room to <br />
spare, and a taut bubble butt. He looked like a porn star, and apparently felt it, as he grinned and replied:<br />
<br />
“I feel fucking awesome.”<br />
<br />
Alex was shaking with anger – while he’d been worried David was dying all the larger man had worried about was <br />
growing bigger. He’d lost his intelligence as well as just about any empathy.<br />
<br />
“Fucking great,” Alex muttered.<br />
<br />
And with that Alex stormed out of David’s apartment, and didn’t answer when David tried to call to apologise. <br />
He tried Tony too, but he didn’t reply either. David felt disgusted with himself. He’d had to change someone <br />
but Alex was right, he could have changed anyone and shouldn’t have changed his friend. But he shrugged it <br />
off: it was done now, and Alex would like it eventually...David tried to go to sleep and forget about the <br />
whole evening.</p>
