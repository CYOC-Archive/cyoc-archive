<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I am legally required to remind you, that the contract once signed is unbreakable and immutable. You agree to having your existence rewritten and there is no guarantee what traits if any of the you that you are will survive if any. And whoever your service contract is auction off to will become whom you&#39;ll dutifully serve willingly and eagerly. The Exchange will also take this time to remind you will have legal and magical protection against any Contract Holder who tries to deflower you, and you will return to the Exchange, with your new sister in tow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes we know! It also means that you guys can&#39;t suddenly change the conditions of the contract after we&#39;ve already signed.&quot; Said a short thin girl with long black hair and glasses. <br />
<br />
The old man behind the desk read, &quot;Brainwashed Cat Girl Maid, Brainwashed Foxgirl Harem Dancer, Brainwashed Bunny Girl Cheerleader, Brainwashed Dragoness Nudist Bodyguard.  All to be held under the same contract so they are always taken as a set. You do realize there is no guarantee the four of you will remember each other or even recognize each other after the rewriting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re all friends in this lifetime, we want to be friends in our new life time,&quot; said a pudgy woman with a brown bowl cut. <br />
<br />
 &quot;I know that we&#39;ll just form our bond over again,&quot; said a blond who looked aged before her time, her purse containing a slew of medication.<br />
<br />
&quot;As per standard rules, 90% of the sale of your contract will go to your families. And your families will receive a pension  for the foreseeable eternity you remain in your Master&#39;s service.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we please get this over with,&quot; the red-head of the group said shivering as she hugged herself, scars hidden under her sweater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sign the contract, and the process will begin immediately, be sure to sign next to which rewrite you wish to submit to, there is no renegotiation.&quot;<br />
<br />
The short lady sighed and signed, &#39;Angie&#39; next to &#39;Brainwashed Cat Girl Maid.&#39;<br />
<br />
The pudgy woman sweated slightly as she signed, &#39;Ruby&#39; next to &#39;Brainwashed Foxgirl Harem Dancer.&#39;<br />
<br />
The blond scrawled &#39;Ivy&#39; next to &#39;Brainwashed Bunny Girl Cheerleader,&#39; barely looking at the contract. <br />
<br />
The redhead didn&#39;t even hesitate as she signed, &#39;Vivian&#39; next to &#39;Brainwashed Dragoness Nudist Bodyguard.&#39;<br />
<br />
Once the last name was signed, all four immediately stiffened. Their arms locked locked at their sides and their legs stood together as their backs straightened and all four stared straight ahead. <br />
<br />
Reality itself was rewritten as the four were remade physically, mentally, their souls, and destiny were all rewritten to make them ideal for the fate they&#39;d willingly given themselves to. <br />
<br />
The four women increased in height, though Angie remained shorter than the rest but not as obvious as before, while Vivian became easily taller than the other three.<br />
<br />
Their figures changed, morphing and growing. Angie&#39;s chest became petite and with compact muscle. <br />
<br />
Ivy&#39;s figure became as fantasy granting as possible without breaking the laws of biology and square cube law, with muscles of an athlete. <br />
<br />
Ruby&#39;s figure changed the most dramatically, gaining a body shape thought to only exist on magazine covers, with a chest that should have cracked spines and a waist you&#39;d think could only exist with the removal of some internal organs, but Ruby suffered no ill effects... she was immortal now after all. <br />
<br />
Vivian already the tallest, gained breasts fitting her size, and formed muscles of an amazon warrior who could break bones with her bare hands. <br />
<br />
Angie&#39;s body was covered in bright blue fur, her hair turning a darker shade. A blue furry tail snaked out under her dress, pads formed on her palms and soles of her feet, her nails replaced with retractable claws. Her mouth filled with fangs. Her eyes became an even brighter green and slit. Her face pushed out into a muzzle as her ears became triangles on the top of her head. <br />
<br />
The feet of the contractees became digigrated, their shoes and socks vanishing. They&#39;d always been digigrated, they&#39;d never worn shoes: just as they&#39;d spent their entire lives with training and lessons preparing for this day, not allowing themselves to be pulled away by useless distractions. <br />
<br />
Ruby body was covered in brought orange fur except for dark brown &#39;gloves&#39; and &#39;socks&#39; covering her hands and paws with tiny claws. White covered her underbelly and the lower half of her face and the inside of her ears. Her ears became dark brown furry triangles, a long muzzle with a black nose psuhing forward with a large brush like tail with a dark brown tip. Her gold eyes stared out. <br />
<br />
The names of their old existences meant nothing, their Master could give them new names if need be. Their minds emptied of useless things that were only annoying distractions to their new fates, their minds filling with decades worth of study and training, instinct and muscle memory seamlessly taking its place. <br />
<br />
A blond round fully tail appeared from Ivy&#39;s dress, her entire body covered in blond fur, her ears becoming longer and thinner as their reached up above her head. Her teeth flattened, her front teeth becoming longer in her muzzle, her nose and whiskers twitching. Her blue eyes became huge. Her mucles becoming even stronger in her legs. <br />
<br />
A french maid uniform replaced Angie&#39;s brown jacket and skirt. She would keep the Master&#39;s home perfect and clean. <br />
<br />
A cheerleader uniform that exposed her mid-drift morphed out of Ivy&#39;s sweater. She would aid Master&#39;s self confidence, his focus and drive to succeed! <br />
<br />
And Ruby&#39;s outfit became practically just jewelry that what was not shown only made her more attractive and enticing, bits of transparent clothing hanging from different spots. Her mind filling with memories of moving with a truly liquid grace that melted the minds of all who saw her perform. She would proudly keep Master and their guests entertained. <br />
<br />
Vivian&#39;s clothes vanished completely, but that didn&#39;t matter. Her entire body became covered in mostly crimson scales. Bronze horns grew pointing backwards on her head. Her nails becoming claws like spears. Golden scales covered her neck, belly, and the underside of her  reptilian tail that lifted above the ground behind her, a mass of solid muscle. Her mouth became a muzzle filled with teeth like dagger, her eyes becaming sparks of crimson as her ears vanished. A pair of batwings grew from her back that could cover her like a cape if need be. Her legs them... fused with her tail... until from the waist down she was nothing but tail, but she held her stature without problem, slithering along the ground without trouble. She would destroy anything that threatened her Master. <br />
<br />
With identical grins on their faces, the four marched out in perfect lock-step with each other, each of their hearts practically bursting with anticipation of who their Master might be that they&#39;d serve their immortal lives for. <br />
<br />
Stepping through a waiting door their instinctively knew to pass through, the four stood side by side, standing tall and chests out, a little off to the side of a podium. A skeleton stood behind the podium, holding a gavel and dressed in the finest queenly jewelry of a thousand years.<br />
<br />
In the audience were mythical beings of all sorts, dragons, genie lords, kitsune, Tanuki, etcetera: and all of them with the money to buy the immortal service of four anthro women whose only reason to draw in their next breath was to find joy in service to the one who&#39;d hold their contract, and would die to protect their Master if need be as was their duty. <br />
<br />
The four didn&#39;t even so much as look at each other as they waited for who would claim the four of them as their servants.</p>
