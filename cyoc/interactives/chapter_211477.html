<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a stark moment of silence at first as Jonathan paced around a little bit, taking stock of his newly animalistic appearance. Not quite human but not entirely animal either. Half of one it seemed and half of the other. That had been a simply incredible orgasm - one that made him contemplate doing this sort of transformative event another night some time. Then the silence was broken as Peyton spoke up first, shifting a little on his chair and looking around as if to check if everyone else still saw that like he did, &quot;Jonathan...you...you became a fucking <i>furry!</i>&quot; <br />
<br />
Jonathan chuckled a little at the verbage used, and responded somewhat sarcastically, &quot;Kick me if I start doing any &quot;uwu&quot; nonsense. Just...do it.&quot; He then surveyed the way he&#39;d changed, noting as he did that he still retained his human mind, even in such an animalistic body, &quot;It does indeed seem I&#39;m somewhere between human and lion. Pretty interesting change. I feel pretty strong. Some areas...&quot; he said as he looked over his manhood and his less bulging gut, &quot;Seem better than ever. So...&quot;<br />
<br />
He then turned and looked at Adriana, &quot;This is a pretty interesting change. Apologies for making you swallow. I&#39;m usually a bit more capable of stopping to let my date off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;d show me that consideration...?&quot; Adriana seemed delighted, &quot;Thank you, Jonathan. And it&#39;s alright. I fully intended on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adriana looked Jonathan over - each change was always something unique and new, even as she sometimes saw the same thing occur again during a session - it always registered and happened differently. Sometimes it progressed from the head, other times from the feet. &quot;As it stands, you&#39;re at a pretty comfortable point in the change. Most of my clients stop here. Another session with me would push you further toward your leonine half. Just as a warning, in case you had the idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
The other guys looked among themselves, though Calum seemed to register what happened with a degree of consternation.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d enjoyed thoroughly watching Jonathan change. And the fact it seemed going by his expression he wasn&#39;t interested in going further...well, Calum was disappointed, but he understood. It was after all their choice.<br />
<br />
Jonathan gulped, not knowing if the same consideration toward his intelligence versus any instincts might be maintained if he went further toward the lion aspects introduced to him during that Change Service. &quot;I&#39;ll uh. Keep that in mind.&quot; He did however wonder about any sex he might have the rest of the night. Adriana was probably off limits. But he hoped to have at least two or three more orgasms before he reverted to human. There had to be some bars or something catering to those undergoing their change, something like that...<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; Adriana looked at the other men seated on their chairs naked, &quot;Which of you lovely American young men want to go next?&quot; She said it with some degree of impish interest and delight. She always enjoyed the sheer variety of changes that her clients underwent. It was part of what made this service so eminently enjoyable. Whether it was watching a man&#39;s potency enhance, or sucking on it as it retreated down to a clitoris and his chest swelled into breasts... the change was thrilling.<br />
<br />
There was a degree of chatter among them as they tried to sort it out. <br />
<br />
Jonathan decidedly kept away from the proceedings, enjoying his happy middle ground between human and lion very much thank you. As good as that had felt, he wasn&#39;t interested in taking it even further. He valued the things maintaining his connection to humanity allowed him to do.<br />
<br />
Calum on the other hand with his unsaid and uncontemplated transformation fetish was eager, &quot;I-I think I want to---I mean, Jonathan did it. And it looked like it felt pretty good. But---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But nothing, I&#39;m going next.&quot; Luke confidently stated. The effete pretty boy Luke was eager to see what he was going to end up as. <br />
<br />
Joshua Keller shook his head, &quot;You&#39;ll hear no interest of yet from me. If I do go, I don&#39;t want any perverted glances toward me as I do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like you watching me pump my hips into that South African woman&#39;s pussy?&quot; Luke said, and then chuckled, &quot;Yeah I saw you eyeing my ass while we were all fucking that group of women. Hard not to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I was just---ahh fuck, dude, you were just making so much noise, you know!?&quot; Joshua fired back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just gonna wait to see what happens next. Make my decision from there.&quot; Peyton announced. He saw what happened with Jonathan, and he hoped whatever happened to him, he didn&#39;t end up too animalistic. It looked like it felt good, but he really hoped he didn&#39;t end up with an animal TF. If he did...he&#39;d deal with it. Probably just stay indoors here until it wore off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh, Luke can have it.&quot; Calum conceded - deciding he wanted to build up some more anticipation for his turn and just enjoy watching another round of changes. If nothing else, this was really arousing, and he hoped to see something every bit as exciting from this occasion. What kind of transformation would happen to Luke...? Considering the pretty boy&#39;s looks, he&#39;d have guessed something to do with his appearance or some such. Maybe gender related. Still, it definitely excited him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Luke it is then~!&quot; Adriana advanced on Luke&#39;s chair, looking him up and down, &quot;Now, keep the thrashing to a minimum, and don&#39;t stress about what change you may get. It will feel excellent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke breathed heavily, and then laid back in his chair and released any stress, letting his arms fall by his sides, presenting his manhood forward, and moving his hair back with a slide of his hand. He let any worry about what he might get fall by the wayside. He looked at Adriana as she advanced toward him, &quot;However you&#39;re good with doing this to me, I&#39;m good.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, Adriana started with Luke&#39;s nipples - seeing them on his hairless chest, standing out a bit. In truth, she&#39;d made quite a good guess. Luke had quite sensitive nipples, and was always keen on his dates touching his chest while he touched theirs. It was a rare quirk of the male body - but one Luke was eager to enjoy. And enjoy he did - as Adriana locked her lips on one nipple while pinching and teasing the other, Luke immediately gasped, &quot;Oh---Oh, good---good girl...oh so good...&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke did not see that as Adriana went to work that his chest, as well as the rest of his torso and abdomen were pulsing, growing brown and pale hairs, the pale more toward the chest and abdomen as the brown hairs spread slowly outward. Even as this hair spread, the muscular flesh underneath grew more powerfully built - the lean muscles surging with a new size, pushing Luke up a bit as he gasped at the sensation. &quot;F-Feel it! The change it&#39;s---it&#39;s ohh its something else!&quot;<br />
<br />
Unlike with Jonathan, next Adriana went to Luke&#39;s legs, bringing his feet up and the changing young man watched her start sucking on his toes with both mirth and mystified intrigue - having never had this done to him before. But as he felt something shifting in his legs and feet, the sheer sensation was at once overwhelming and new to him, &quot;Aww...aww yes...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Adriana sucked on his toes, she could feel them shifting within her mouth, even as his legs bulked up and grew stronger, more powerfully built with muscles made for carrying a brawny horse as far and as fast as it wanted to go. The brown hairs beginning to travel down his legs at a fast pace. Luke gripped the sides of his chair as he felt his cock bob - the coloration seemed to be...weird. Different. Blotchy - not entirely human any more.<br />
<br />
Like hell he was gonna just let himself cum straight away! He intended to enjoy this as much as he could. <br />
<br />
But by the time Adriana pulled away - more or less forced to as Luke&#39;s hooves began to fully form on his feet - the young man was huffing and feeling quite wound up. He had never known his toes to be an erotic spot, especially not as far as feminine attention went. But now he was freshly surprised - and all the more when he saw what became of his feet and the leg structure around near them. &quot;I&#39;m...ooh, beginning to get an inclination of---of what I&#39;m turning into.&quot;<br />
<br />
He could see how his legs looked different, more muscular but structured in a new way...<br />
<br />
&quot;That so...?&quot; Adriana addressed the young man, seeing the fur still spreading across his body, &quot;You must be feeling rather <i>horse</i>.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That---That was a bad---bad pun---!&quot; But Luke couldn&#39;t finish chiding her for the pun as she moved to kiss him. Knowing what this likely meant, he gave himself fully into the kiss - even as he felt his skull and head starting to tingle. He kicked the floor between her legs as the fiery makeout started to draw forward, the sheer sensation confusing but basically pleasant - alien, yet enjoyable. His head extended, growing longer, forming the muzzle of a horse. His eyes moving in the course of it, shifting a bit to the sides as his form adjusted to the equine influence.<br />
<br />
Yet even if he would notice his shift in vision, he didn&#39;t yet - because his eyes were shut, his hands gripping the sides of the increasingly straining chair as he felt his form growing heavier, stronger, more capable. His fur spreading across his body, growing in on his head quickly, his usual hair growing backward into a combination of his human haircut and a horse&#39;s mane. He couldn&#39;t help himself but pump his hips as he felt Adriana stroke his mane with one hand.<br />
<br />
By the time she pulled away, Luke had a horse-like muzzle for a head, but retained some inflection of his human persona - his eyes, his hair and some element of presentation. &quot;Aww...huh...&quot; He noted as he was forced to stand up - the chair just not made for a human / Clydesdale Stallion hybrid - that his voice was deeper. His body more powerfully muscled...and now, able to see, the fact his vision was different, &quot;I---I see things differently...&quot;<br />
<br />
But he didn&#39;t have much time to contemplate these things as Adriana knelt down and took his cock into her mouth - it had not of yet fully changed, and feeling her mouth around himself made Luke let out a gasp that proceeded into a whinny, &quot;Ohhh! Oh that&#39;s---that&#39;s fucking sensitive!&quot; He felt her hand roam around down there as she licked and sucked at his manhood - in the process introducing a brand new sensation as it began to grow into its equine dimensions.<br />
<br />
The feeling of the ring around the middle of his dick growing in on him made Luke almost pump his hips, but he managed to control the inclination...but this control severely flagged as Adriana moved from sucking him off to sucking on his balls, which made him outright pump his hips several times - in the process his tail grew out behind him, the fur fully growing in on it within moments. He was beginning to take several sharp breaths as he felt his body&#39;s functions change...<br />
<br />
His lungs became stronger, his stomach could digest grass as well as oats and other plant life... Luke looked at his fingers, seeing that while they weren&#39;t turning into hooves, they still looked thicker, more unwieldy, the nail larger and tougher. As he fully covered in the hair of a horse, Luke hoped he&#39;d be able to keep control of himself longer...<br />
<br />
But then Adriana found another weakspot on him. She licked at and pressed her tongue on his taint, and the burgeoning horse-man could take it no more. &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m cumming! Cumming! Fuuuuuck!&quot; And with that, and one more push of his hips he felt the orgasm rush through his body - a loud neigh erupting from his mouth outside his awareness as he wavered on his new hooves. The floor now had a mess of horse / human hybrid sperm across the floorboards - and a quivering, still astonished Luke observing the sheer volume of his emission.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hot damn, that was something else.&quot; He murmured and then looked around. <br />
<br />
The other guys were quiet for a moment, Peyton and Joshua were glancing at each other - Peyton a little worried and Joshua trying not to show any excitement by what he saw. On the other hand, Calum had ended up openly rubbing his cock as he observed. Almost drooling at the sight of it.<br />
<br />
Jonathan had duly observed, but much like some of the others had ended up enjoying the sight quite a bit. The lion-man nursed a new half hard erection, dragging his tongue over his new teeth, and his tail swishing with excitement. He didn&#39;t want to necessarily change any more, but that had really got him excited for more sex. It seemed he was trying to focus on looking at his phone - being careful with his new claws - trying to find some place for later that might cater to those who&#39;d been changed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...who&#39;s next?&quot; Adriana looked at Joshua, Calum and Peyton...</p>
