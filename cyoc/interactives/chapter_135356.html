<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James was just about to wonder what was going on, when he found himself thrown to all fours. His neck and body were already large enough to see his face in the mirror. His face was a striking draconic figure, and if he would soon be the size of a horse... But he seemed too slim, like his body was growing upwards more than out... Or longer rather than wider.<br />
<br />
He soon found his hands starting to cramp up as they turned into talons. They didn&#39;t become unusable as hands, but as soon as he felt a few cracks in his back and hips, he wasn&#39;t sure he&#39;d be getting back on two legs again. There was also a slight swelling feeling in his pecs. And his mind struggled to figure out what was going on.<br />
<br />
His vision went fuzzy for a moment as draconic lore passed through his mind, things he&#39;d never heard of; such as the most basic workings of magic... And he suddenly had a hunch that the magic that was turning him into this was only partly successful at turning him into the sire, so he wasn&#39;t going to be excluded from being one of the &quot;dams&quot; he met... But if that&#39;s the case then...<br />
<br />
Even as his dick grew longer and pointier, he felt something opening between his legs, wet and winking; even without the shower still washing his behind... And he suddenly understood with perfect clarity... He was going to have to be the mother AND the father.<br />
<br />
Right as he began to question how exactly he was supposed to fuck himself, he felt a pain rip through his belly, like his testicles were suddenly displaces without warning, and he part felt and part saw with draconic magic his balls right next to a growing womb getting wired to it as a new pathway from his prostate opened, even as a brand new pair of ovaries formed above his womb.<br />
<br />
For a moment he almost panicked until the magical knowledge floating in his head reassured him that its unlikely to go that route unless his prostate overflows... Or more likely if he makes it go that way... Images of his feminine slit being pleasured in a all manners of ways from dildos to letting one of her dams pleasure her slit themselves making it very clear to him what it would take it make it go that way... To give into his female sex&#39;s needs, no matter how he did so.<br />
<br />
The images weren&#39;t exactly helping him keep the heat in check, so he tried refocusing on his reflection. Only to find herself in a mix of confusion and affection to her own reflection, her slitted pupils were quite wide in this dim light, and his eyes themselves were large wide and expressive, with needlessly feminine eyelashes, the gold irises quite striking. She was torn to do so, but she turned to show off her butt to herself, and found it was cute and round, with her slit looking tight right beneath her tail, a tail which was long and elegant like her body. Even standing on all fours like this, she felt her head was almost touching the roof. She was practically as large as a very slender horse. And her face was framed by hair a shade of dark purple, and her body was closer to lavender... Its like every piece of her was more feminine than her sister.<br />
<br />
He shook is head at the thought of him being a girl... But the body, that waist... Those modest and supple breasts... She... She was the only term that really fit the way this body made her feel, even if she was technically still fated to be the man in any relationship she&#39;d ever have.<br />
<br />
The wings were mostly a formality to what she was at this point... She was a dragon... And a girl everywhere it counted, and if she wasn&#39;t mistaken... Even her mind was that of a girl now as near as she could tell from the draconic fuzz trying to save her sanity, though she was still a boy at heart even if that means &quot;tomboy&quot; now.<br />
<br />
She sighed... Somewhere between defeated and humiliated even as the subtle heat in her loins remained a constant reminder of her need to mate herself... And her raging erection remained despite this embarrassment.<br />
<br />
She sat back down in the shower, trying her best to fit herself in. Even so, the knowledge of the sire in her head made something crystal clear. If anyone got too close to her like this, they&#39;d become a dragon just like he was; boobs, four legs and all, only without the dick... Even if they were a man.<br />
<br />
There was a knock on the door to the main room, and James tried to make her best impression of her old self. &quot;Don&#39;t come in,&quot; she said, sounding more like a mature woman than a young male, adult or not... And she had the feeling if she wasn&#39;t trying to disguise her voice, she&#39;d sound a young maiden.<br />
<br />
&quot;James, I had this feeling in the back of my mind that you&#39;d been turned into a... &quot; He heard his father say from outside. &quot;Well... Not important I guess... But it sounded like you were trying to warn me of something... I guess that happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If its really related, then say it! I&#39;m a purple dragon!&quot; James said, &quot;and... Look, just don&#39;t get close, its dangerous.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause. &quot;... You get any knowledge of magic out of that?&quot;<br />
<br />
James held her head as a massive headache ran through it for a split second. &quot;If vague instinctual feelings, images, and thoughts count? Maybe... I... I&#39;d need to know what I&#39;m trying to do, and even then we might need supplies to do anything worthwhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounded like his father was thinking for a moment as it seemed dead silent for a moment. &quot;Maybe we can rig up something so you don&#39;t... You know... Turn the wedding into your hand maidens. Call me on your phone if you think of anything to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
James pouted in silence, and she heard her dad place some kind of tag on the door handle, probably a &#39;do not disturb&#39; sign. She sighed at this, and tried to think of how exactly to contain the effects that would turn anyone nearby into dragonesses... But between the heat in her loins, and a beginning of a trickle of milk down her breast mingling with the shower water... Lactation that her &#39;sire&#39;s knowledge&#39; seemed to assure her was probably something she was stuck with.</p>
