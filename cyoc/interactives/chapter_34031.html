<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>The thin layer of clouds dissipated, allowing the light of the full moon to shine brightly on the ground where they both stood out in the open, in the middle of the dirt path. Both Paul and Nathan could feel the change build up in them slowly. Both sat on the nearby park bench, clutching their chests.</br>
<br>Nathan's lips were curled into a smile, enjoying whatever it was that was happening to them. Paul could clearly see that Nathan was further along in his change. Nathan's facial hair was fuller and thicker than just coarse facial hair, not to mention his ears were pointed and hairy. As Nathan began to speak, Paul could hear a deeper, more animalistic voice come from his mouth rather than the voice Paul came to like.</br>
<br>"Do you feel that? We are becoming something more and better than normal men!"</br>
<br>Paul could feel what he was talking about. It was like the more animalistic side of him was building up on the inside, building to burst through his skin and make him the animal every human-being is. "Yeah, I can feel it... what is going on?"</br>
<br>"Well... I know I drank four glasses of moonshine at least an hour ago. What about you? I am pretty sure you had it too, but I wont jump to conclusions."</br>
<br>"No... you can jump into anything you like." Paul said with a wry smile. "I had the moonshine too, come to think of it I only had four shots, not full glasses. It was half an hour ago that I had my shots as well."</br>
<br>Nathan continued to smile, his changes a little further along. His eyes had tinged yellow, his body was more muscular straining against his tightening clothes and his exposed skin was much hairier than before. "Yeah, that's what I had too. They don't give out full glasses of the stuff because I am sure it would knock people right on their asses."</br>
<br>The two chuckled and as they both laughed something in Paul had changed. He eyed the bulge straining against the fabric of Nathan's pants, obviously so Nathan would see him do it. A low howl escaped from Paul's lips. <i>Awwwrrrrroooooo.</i></br>
<br>"I know how you feel Paul, it's in me too! You can go ahead and do whatever you want. I have spent some time on Pleasure Island and I have learned that we are free to do what we want. Indecent exposure doesn't exist here because only men are allowed on the island. No females at all, never has been and will always remain to be that way. If you want to take my cock out, it would be alright with me, especially because it would make things more comfortable."</br>
<br>Paul shrugged, liking what he heard. The change continued further in him as the sun completely disappeared and gave the sky over to the bright shining full moon. Paul felt his face and could see that his stubble was dark brown and thick like Nathan's. He felt around and his ears had grown hairy as well as pointed. Looking down to his exposed arms and legs, he noticed he was just as hairy as Nathan. Something in him knew that it was wrong and was fighting against whatever change was happening. Returning his attention back to Nathan, Paul saw that he was relaxing against the bench, panting in heat and slight sexual arousal while staring up at the starry sky, but with his gaze fixed on the moon.</br>
<br>"Paul... do you feel something inside of you fighting the change?"</br>
<br>In a low, similar voice that Nathan acquired, Paul responded. "Yeah... a part of me wants whatever it is to keep fighting while the other part wants to let it happen... whatever it is. It just feels like my insides are in a stalemate while my mind wants to see and know what the new me would be like!"</br>
<br>"It's like that inside of me too right now. You and I are both at the same point in our transformations. Do you know what we are going to become Paul?"</br>
<br>"Well... I think so, but I am not sure. Since we both had four shots of moonshine; we both are hairier, with thicker beards, pointy and hairy ears like a wolf's; not to mention we are both attracted to the moon. I would have to guess we are becoming werewolves."</br>
<br>"Yeah, I know we both are because the bartender told me he drank it and that I would love being a werewolf."</br>
<br>"The bartender was a werewolf?! That is so cool and would explain why he had several of the guys eying him."</br>
<br>"Well that and the fact he is a hairy, muscle bound, nicely tanned and sexy man!"</br>
<br>Both sighed and chuckled realizing they had did it simultaneously.</br>
<br>"What do you think lets us allow the rest of the change to happen? The urge to complete the transformation feels incredibly strong, just like the wolf inside is ready to burst through and take possession of the world!"</br>
<br>"The bartender shouted something at me as I left, I think it was a hint on what to do when this was happening."</br>
<br>"What was it Nathan?"</br>
<br>"Let the animal loose and don't worry about doing whatever you feel led to do."</br>
<br>Paul smiled, ripped off his shirt and placed both his hairy hands on Nathan's crotch. Paul leaned over and placed his lips on the bulge trapped in the fabric and started kissing it, then moved onto gumming it with his lips. Paul could feel Nathan's cock stir and harden even more, feeling a wet spot form through the fabric.</br>
<br>"Oh my god Paul, that feels ssssooooooo good. I feel like my cock is just leaking gobs of pre."</br>
<br>Paul smiled, looked up at Nathan and placed his fingers at the button at the top of his jeans. Unbuttoning it, Nathan gasped and Paul could feel a bit of relief in Nathan as he was slightly less tense. Paul continued smiling and unzipped the pants, adding a lot more relief. Then he placed his right hand inside and pulled out Nathan's meat. Paul's eyes went big, surprised to see a cock that big but felt that he was up to the challenge. Paul looked to Nathan to see his expression, but found that it was the same as Paul's. Apparently the size of his cock was just as new to him as it was to Paul.</br>
<br>"OH WOW! He said anyone who drank it would get bigger, but I had no idea by how much."</br>
<br>Paul was slightly jealous, but didn't worry about it, just because he probably was just as big... if not bigger. "You know, he was awfully chatty with you. He was quite and mysterious with me, not telling me anything. Eh, no matter!"</br>
<br>Paul took Nathan's cock in his right hand and started to stroke slowly down Nathan's shaft and found no resistance as Nathan's copious precum lubricated his cock. Paul wanted to be the werewolf badly so he expected his next move to be the clencher. He took a long lick of Nathan's huge cock, coating his entire tongue in the sweet clear fluid and when he reached the tip, Paul smiled and swallowed. Paul looked up at Nathan and could see that things had changed for him.</br>
<br>Nathan's faced pushed out to form a muzzle, and because Nathan was panting, Paul could see that Nathan's teeth had sharpened to form fangs not to mention his tongue widened and flattened out. Paul also noticed that Nathan had a wet, black nose at the end of his maw, along with the yellowed whites and green eyes. Nathan's body had doubled in muscle mass, as well as dark brown (almost jet black) fur that was making all of his clothes strain to stay together. Since Nathan was wearing a polo, the seams had already split in some areas, allowing his fur to poke through. Nathan's hands had changed, they were puffier and meaty, like a pair of man hands; worked over and calloused. He had full and soft black pads on his palms while his nails were longer and curled, making wolf claws. Paul looked at the exposed potions of his legs and found the same. Nathan's legs had bulked out to be proportionate to his upper torso, covered in the dark fur, placing strain on his jean shorts, with the seams split in places along his thighs. Nathan's feet must have gone through the same thing because Paul could see that Nathan's taloned feet were poking through the tattered shreds that used to be a hundred dollar pair of Nikes. Paul focused back on the massive cock, noticing that it too was different. It was slightly longer and an inch thicker than before. Paul smiled while he eyed the cock thinking <i>Well... more for me, yum!</i> Paul could hear Nathan whimper, then he took a claw to his pants and swiped across them. Simultaneously from taking the swipe, the clothes fell to tatters laying formlessly on the bench and Nathan raised his butt off the bench to allow his fluffy wolven tail to be free. Paul smiled because he knew that his changes must be on their way.</br>
<br>Paul first wanted to finish what he started. Paul, still having Nathan's cock in his hand jacked him methodically to build up Nathan's climax and when he felt the thick meat tense up, Paul opened his mouth and placed the tip of Nathan's cock in his mouth, catching every thick and creamy white drop.</br>
<br>After the torrent subsided, Nathan sighed and Paul licked his lips clean while he sat back up.</br>
<br>"Well I am glad to see you let the wolf in you come out!"</br>
<br>"Yeah, same here! You give great head man and it looks like the wolf in you is just starting to come out!"</br></p>
