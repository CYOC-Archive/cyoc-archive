<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melinda smirked as she glanced over the haul her and her boyfriend had taken from the apartment. Garrett had been right, the owner was loaded. The two thieves were able to snatch up about $10,000 in jewelry and other items. Times that could be used to not only pay for their next dope score but set them up in a nice hotel for a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
“You were right babe,” the Latina smiled. “The bitch was loaded and her security sucked.” Garrett turned, the strung out men giving a small smile as he looked over his busty girlfriend. “Told ya,” he said. “Noticed that place when I dropped off some takeout last week. Rich people never think anything can happen to them. She’s so damn stupid, having all her shit layer out for anyone to see. Now let’s go see Malik, starting to get the shakes.”<br />
<br />
Jackie had approached slowly, unnoticed by not only the two thieves but Ann. She had listened intently to the two them, which only angered her more. They were addicts and thought very little of Ann. Jackie could feel her cheeks flush with anger as she watched the two of them laugh at Ann’s expense. If they were going to act like little shits, then she would make them little. Focusing her magic Jackie watched her ring begin to glow as she anxiously awaited the transformation to begin.<br />
<br />
The two 19 year olds shivered slightly as they began to sneak away from Ann’s apartment. As they darted into a nearby ally, Jackie could see the changes begin. Garrett was a skinny teen with unkempt brown hair and a patchy beard. Melinda, an attractive and busty Latina with chocolate brown hair, had a face sternner than her 19 years indicated. As they began to age backwards Jackie watched as Garret’s beard began to thin while Melindas face began to loose its fierceness, becoming softer and more innocent. As the two teens became 16 they paused, something didn’t feel right. As Melinda called for Garret to wait she gasped as she looked at his youthful face.<br />
<br />
“Baby what’s happening to you,” she exclaimed. Garrett stopped dead in his tracks, as he turned he gasped pointing at his girlfriend. “Melinda what’s going on!”<br />
<br />
The two 16 year olds now pointed at one another, examine themselves and eachother as they noticed the changes taking place. Garrett beard, which had been thin and patchy to begin with, had all been wiped away leaving his face smooth. As he glanced over his body, he was shocked to see that he appeared to have gained weight. The skinny body of an addict had been wiped away leaving the teen healthier than he had been in the last couple of years. <br />
<br />
Melindas changes were just as dramatic. Gone was the street smart girl with the killer figure and stern face. Now, Melinda looked like the teenage girl Garret had met when the two of them started high school. Melindas breasts had shrank down from d cups to b cups as her curves eroded. Melindas face was also becoming more innocent by the second becoming the innocent girl she had once been before she fell in with a bad crowd that concerned themselves with drugs and theft instead of grades.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god,” Melinda whispered as she stared at her hands before looking at Garrett. “Baby look at us. We look like kids!”<br />
<br />
Jackie watched as the regression continued. The two teens left high school behind as they grew younger. The two thugs were now growing shorter as they grew younger, puberty quickly abandoned the two as they raced backwards through elementary school. The weight Garret had put back on quickly vanished as he began to grow small and skinny once more. The boys face becoming more innocent and cherubic by the passing moment. As Garrett left his teens behind Jackie could see the boy becoming a lanky boy with a childish face. The boy now pulled on his overly baggy jeans as they threatened to fall off his skinny waist.<br />
<br />
Melinda was near tears as she began the journey backwards through puberty. The girls face was becoming more innocent with each passing second as she grew younger. Melinda grasped her chest, despondent as she watched them shrink back into her chest. As the two became 10 Jackie could see the two children desperately trying to keep their adult clothing from falling off their childish bodies,<br />
<br />
“What’s happening to us,” Melinda exclaimed, wincing at the childishness sound of her voice. “I don’t know,” Garrett whispered. “I think, I think we’re shrinking!”<br />
<br />
“Make it stop,” Melinda demanded, stomping her foot. “How,” Garret whined as the two dropped to 9. <br />
<br />
Jackie smirked as the two children now began to argue. The two former criminals were now rapidly losing height as they became younger. Garrett had lost a grip on his baggy jeans as they became to heavy for the skinny boy to hold up. Pulling his feet free of his jeans and large sneakers, the boy now stood in the ally in overly large socks, his baggy T-shirt acting as a make shift dress. Melinda was not faring much better as she grew smaller. Not wanting to share the same fate as her boyfriend, the second grader tried her hardest to keep her jeans up as she grew steadily smaller, despite the fact her shoulder was now poking through the collar of her shirt.<br />
<br />
Jackie smiled as the two completed their regression, leaving them 6 year old kindergarten students. The two children were now swamped in their adult clothing, struggling to move. The times the two had grabbed lay scattered on the ground in front of them as they now tried to gather their clothing around them. “Well now,” Jackie smiled. “What do we have here? Looks like a couple of tiny thieves to me.”<br />
<br />
Garret and Melinda turned, shocked to see the adult woman looming over them. “We didn’t do anything,” Melinda yelled. “You don’t know what your talking about.”<br />
<br />
“Jackie scoffed at the small child as she bent down to pick up one of Ann’s stolen items. “Do I look stupid to you,” Jackie huffed. “I saw you two leave my wives apartment. Why do you think I followed you two down this ally.”<br />
<br />
Garret and Melinda paused as they began to put things together. “Wait,” Garret stated. “You, you did this to us.” Jackie smiled, nodding her head, which only angered the young Melinda. “Change us back you bitch,” she screamed.<br />
<br />
“That’s witch,” Jackie frowned. “And you two obviously need to learn some manners.” Melinda frowned as she now tried to punch Jackie. Unfortunately for the young girl, she was swamped in her clothes and only succeeded in falling over. Jackie’s laughter only making the girl angrier. “You just wait til I get my hands on you,”she growled.<br />
<br />
“I don’t think so,” Jackie scowled as she now made another wish on her ring. Garret and Melindas eyes seemed to glaze over as Jackie added to her wish. The two former thieves felt their minds begin to cloud as Jackie began to mentally regress them. Melinda and Garrett tried to remember their adult lives only to find it fade into the ether as Jackie erased their adult existence. Instead of two drug addicted street hustlers, Jackie had transformed them into two 6 year old children, children that would get the help they needed before they turned to a life of crime.<br />
<br />
“What’s going on,” Garret asked, still confused. “Why are my clothes so big.?”<br />
<br />
“You took them from my house,” Jackie stated as she frowned down at the boy. “You and your little girlfriend here.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not my boyfriend,” Melinda said, a look of disgust on her face. “That’s just Garrett, he’s in my class.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Jackie said stoically. “And why are you two breaking into my house.”<br />
<br />
“Cause we wanna explore,” Melinda said defensively. “We didn’t hurt no one and we were gonna put everything back when we were done playing, honest.”<br />
<br />
Jackie nodded, taking the two children’s hands, as she did she made her final wish. Garett And Melindas clothing shrank to fit their tiny bodies. Garrett’s T-shirt And jeans transformed into child sized versions of what he was wearing while Melindas formerly clothing morphed into a small dress complete with a set of Mary Janes. As Jackie now emerged from the ally with the children in tow she could see Ann talking with the police.<br />
<br />
“I found our culprits,” Jackie proclaimed.<br />
<br />
Ann and the cop gave Jackie and the children a confused look as she led the children towards them, Ann’s belongings in tow. The officer glanced at the children, sighing in relief. “Lady you just helped us out big time,” he breathed. “These two went missing from a field trip about an hour ago. Looks like they decided to explore the city on their own.”<br />
<br />
“We were just playing,” Melinda whined.<br />
<br />
“Yeah tell it to your teacher and your parents,” the officer grunted. “Don’t think anyone’s going to be too happy you went into this nice ladies house and took her things.”<br />
<br />
“We’re sorry,” Garrett mumbled.<br />
<br />
The officer shook his head as he now handed Ann back her missing property. “Sorry for the inconvenience ma’am,” he apologized. “Can’t really arrest these two but I’m sure you can expect an apology from the parents and the school.”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay really,” Ann whispered, slightly stunned. “I’m just glad the kids are okay.” As the officer now waved goodbye, escorting the two rambunctious 6 year olds away, Ann turned towards her wife noticing the sly smile on her face. “Figured those two needed a redo,” she grinned. “Hopefully they get it right this time around.”<br />
<br />
Ann laughed softly, before placing a tender kiss on Jackie’s cheek.</p>
