<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the &quot;Dragons of the Earth&quot; competition ended, JC and Pauline carried out one bit of direction for the Animalia Ambassadoria coverage of the contest, mostly because of the fact that the Year of the Dragon contest was in Dino City and well away from Lyre/Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;That last run concludes the Dragons of the Earth contest, and the present standings will be posted up on the scoreboard shortly,&quot; JC spoke, &quot;though, the next event here in this part of the Dome will be the Sky Dragon competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;However, that will require some time to set up some landing mats and things like that here,&quot; Pauline spoke, &quot;so... while we wait on that to be set up, we will move things over to the pool area and the Dragons of the Water contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I still wonder why they&#39;ve flipped up the schedule on all of this,&quot; Sophie commented as she and Roland made their way into the main locker room at the Dino Dome, &quot;I mean... from what we had to start with... the pageants were to go first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe it&#39;s a timing thing,&quot; Roland commented, &quot;there are enough Dinotopians, and even a few contemporary Animalians in the contest that the female&#39;s pageant and the male&#39;s equivalent would be on one day for each. This way with the individual group &quot;skills challenges,&quot; they can get those done in a night and thus avoid taking up too much time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sophie nodded to that and was quick to note on how big many things were in Dino City. The locker room was set up like those at WSA and the Claw Coliseum, in that they were mono-gendered and that the only thing that was different was the scaling. For while Sophie and Roland as Dinotopians that were about the same size as most Humans would have to put a bit more effort into working some of the larger and heavier things in Dino City, many of the larger Dinotopians wouldn&#39;t be able to get into things built for Humans or smaller Animalians at all. And since she and her mate were strong enough to operate things, it wasn&#39;t as though the oversized lockers were an impediment. They went to where they could find locker that wasn&#39;t permanently rented by anyone and hopped up onto the main bench to change from what they&#39;d worn during the day and their classes at SMU and what would be more &quot;sporty&quot; gear for the Sky Dragon competition.<br />
<br />
Sophie had just gotten the door to the locker open when a bit of movement out of the corner of her eye caught a bit of attention, and she turned her head a bit to see that Andrew and Jen were there and redressing after the &quot;Dragons of the Earth&quot; challenge. They hadn&#39;t done too badly in the opening round and handled the strength side of the competition with relative ease, though their raw size also made certain aspects of running a bit more difficult, which kept both of them out of the top ten so far as the points went, but they had managed a rather respectable placement, and to a degree, some of what went into that challenge benefitted the medium to large sized Theropods which would better balance both parts of the challenge. Among the Sauropods, it was actually Luke and Marjorie that managed to just make it into the top ten.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; Sophie called as she worked to get her way out of her shirt and hoping that Andrew and Jen weren&#39;t too engrossed in anything important.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, you Ms. Albers and Mr. Luwrie, you two are getting ready for the Sky Dragon competition?&quot; Andrew asked as he looked down to the two Pterodactylus Dinotopians.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;ll be fun chasing drones,&quot; Sophie commented, &quot;will you be staying for the rest of the skills challenges?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;ll be fun to see on how things go for the others,&quot; Jen nodded beside her husband, &quot;particularly when the female Tylosaurus Dinotopian had the same issue as me... So, in a way, I&#39;d be rooting for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;d make sense,&quot; Roland commented as he picked up the conversation as he sat down to switch from his jeans to the athletic shorts for the contest, and also picking up on what Sophie was getting at, &quot;though... while you&#39;re here, if you run into our folks... I&#39;d think they would want to thank you for the help you gave them on what specific Sauropods to go with for their conversions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... by rule, we couldn&#39;t force anything, though, one could say that there were some things where there was obvious interest,&quot; Andrew said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have no doubt of that,&quot; Sophie responded, &quot;but they&#39;re happy with their conversions and they did mention your help... as well as Luke and Marjorie in which species they ultimately picked. So it&#39;s a simple thank you for the help they want to give...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure we can manage that... as would Luke and Marjorie,&quot; Jen managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My folks are largely shade of blue now... though my dad has some bright orange on his head,&quot; Roland gave a base description, &quot;and they may be bigger than both of you... as... well, Alamosaurus is bigger than Brachiosaurus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And my folks are a bright emerald green with some yellow spots on the dorsal side,&quot; Sophie added.<br />
<br />
Andrew and Jen nodded at that. Though, from there, the two pairs went about their work. Most of those who were in the Dragons of the Water contest were likely already ready for those events and were either warming up or were moving over for it. The only other ones who would be on their way would be JC and Pauline who would need to change for the Water Dragon competition. Sophie would also go to watch, but she did want to be better prepared for the air dragon contest, which would follow shortly after...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And some of that preparation made sense, as there were others that were also ready for Dragons of the Air contest. That were most ready were essentially in a position similar to that which Regina and Ulysses had been in. Both Spinosaurus Dinotopians had been in the Earth and Water competitions, and while Ulysses didn&#39;t match Regina, he&#39;d done well enough that he felt that the female Spinosaurus Dinotopian might give him some attention, and over time, trying to court her... in the most polite way possible also had Ulysses willing to change certain things that he wanted for himself going forward, and to a degree, he wasn&#39;t the only one. For there was also Fred Timm and Quetzal. The two, now happily married Quetzalcoatlus Dinotopians had also been in the Dragons of the Earth contest and were now preparing for the Dragons of the Air competition as well, and it did attract some other attraction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weren&#39;t you in the land dragon races?&quot; asked a boy in one of the front rows of seats making Fred Timm turn his head and beak to look down to him.<br />
<br />
Fred Timm thought he recognized him as one of the Elementary School level kids from Glenn Rose. Since his conversion, he&#39;d been able to provide some added talks and discussions on how Dinotopians were able to provide some added information for use on the speculation on the actual animals they were based on. Rex had helped him with some of them, and Fred thought he&#39;d seen this kid at some of those meetings. A parent moved to shush the kid, but Fred was able to counter the parent.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m sure all of this is just curiosity,&quot; Fred spoke, &quot;and yes, my mate and I were in the land races. But it&#39;s something that fits with the type of Pterosaur that we are. For not all Pterosaurs are from the same species or even grouping within the Clade... For example, with the species that everyone knows... Pterodactyl, its Genus is Pterodactylus and has two Species... Antiquus and Kochi. My mate, Quetzal, and I are Quetzalcoatlus, a different species with a different Genus... Quetzalcoatlus, which also has two species names... Northropi and Lawsoni.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re specifically based off of Quetzalcoatlus Northropi,&quot; Quetzal added.<br />
<br />
Fred nodded, &quot;and as an Azhdarchid Pterosaur, it&#39;s a species that has grown to massive sizes for a Pterosaur... larger than any other in North America, and the only other Pterosaurs that can rival Quetzalcoatlus are related species from other parts of the world... other Azhdarchids. All are large bodied and have long toothless bills that can be used to scavenge or hunt smaller prey. And in North America, the only thing that would really be a threat to Quetzalcoatlus was an adult Tyrannosaurus. Which would mean that Quetzalcoatlus didn&#39;t NEED to fly as much as other Pterosaurs would... So, to work with that... Quetzal and I also ran in the Earth Dragon competition as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t do quite as well as most of the others... but we did do okay,&quot; Quetzal answered, &quot;and given that all the points are cumulative in this... we&#39;re hoping for a decent score here, as that would raise our point total that could narrow things between us and Heather, Tyra, Rex, and Mr. M in the overall contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think you can win?&quot; the kid asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope so,&quot; Fred answered with a smile as some of the others that would be competing in the Sky Dragon competition began to come in.<br />
<br />
The others were all well identified by the specialized tank tops and athletic shorts that fit for the competition. Most of them were all other species of Pterosaur, and which made sense. The first true Birds did emerge out of the Theropod lineage in the Mesozoic Era, but so far, most of the Dinotopians that had become Theropods had either picked among the larger species that would be flightless because of their weight, regardless of how close they were to Birds, or had become some species of Raptor. However, the roster was reasonably full with Sophie and Roland approaching Fred and Quetzal first. Next came Buzz Rainfield, the Pteranodon Dinotopian and after that came a couple of female Pterosaur Dinotopians. The first of them was Norrie Simus, the Ornithocheirus and the first Pterosaur Dinotopian. The second was Hazel the Dimorphodon Dinotopian. The last to come in was one that actually was an uplifted Dinotopian... Arcelia, the Archaeopteryx Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like we&#39;re all here,&quot; Sophie spoke as the group all assembled and looked out at the thick mat that covers the floor of the arena.<br />
<br />
Or rather a series of thick mats, and which were likely there to offer something of a cushion in case anyone fell or had trouble in the course of carrying out the competition. All of them could also hear various heaters and fans going at full breeze inside the Dome, which was likely to serve as a part the main test for their competition, which was a timed race after drones that were carrying various large balls being carried by drones. Sophie could see the drone operators over near one of the main desk where JC and Pauline were moving to take their seats. At the same time, there were others that were coming in to watch the contest and were filling the arena after watching those in the Water Dragon competition. This also included most of the other competitors, who were in one section on the first level and on the east side of the arena. Sophie also noted that her parents were on the middle level on the south side and Roland&#39;s parents were on the upper level of the north side, different spots from where they&#39;d been on the opening night and in the other contests so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they said that their assigned tickets seemed to vary when they bought them,&quot; Roland said to her, &quot;so... it may be lucky that they weren&#39;t split up into four individual seats and all spread out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who?&quot; Quetzal wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our folks,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;they became Sauropod Dinotopians back on the tenth while we were setting things up for the start of the contest... And they&#39;re happy, so, that&#39;s great for them. The one thing that might be a distraction would be their wanting to thank Andrew, Jen, Luke, and Marjorie for all the help they gave in picking what species of Sauropod to become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure there will be time for it,&quot; Fred commented, &quot;everyone is here...&quot;<br />
<br />
He was about to say more when a couple of Horizon PR men approached toward Sophie and Roland with what looked like some cameras and various sorts of strapped harnesses. Sophie and Roland also noticed this and looked over to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not wearing those while competing,&quot; Sophie said before either of the PR men could say anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;The idea would be provide some element of showing flight from a Dinotopian&#39;s point of view,&quot; the first PR man spoke, &quot;and would be part of the Animalia Ambassadoria coverage... and was promised as such.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If need be, I can show that AFTER the competition,&quot; Sophie answered, &quot;if that&#39;s strapped to my head in the contest, it will either impede by vision or impede my ability feel the air currents while flying... it would slow me down and provide something that would make it near impossible to fly well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the competition is timed,&quot; Roland added.<br />
<br />
The Horizon PR men both blinked and then looked up to the other flying Dinotopians that all seemed to rally around Sophie and Roland. That was enough for the two PR men to back down. They nodded and backed away while raising a thumbs up to JC and Pauline back at the desk.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
From the desk, JC and Pauline noted the &quot;thumbs up&quot; and then nodded to the Horizon staff member that was operating the camera and had provided much of the direct coverage for the events thus far. As the camera light came on, JC and Pauline moved to give the introduction for the Sky Dragon Competition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome back to the Dino Dome&#39;s main arena, where we will begin the last of the three sets of skills events for the Year of the Dragon... the Sky Dragon Competition,&quot; JC spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;A competition that would actually fit to base abilities often seen in many dragon types... both Asian and European,&quot; Pauline added, &quot;the ability to fly. Much like the other events, this race will be timed and will serve to see on who can be the master of the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
JC then gestured to a side and the cameraman moved to follow the gesture to show the series of drones.<br />
<br />
&quot;Each contestant will chase after these drones, that will be flown at different heights and in different directions,&quot; JC spoke, &quot;they will be carrying a rubber ball attached to a piece of string. They are to grab the ball and the string... which will easily detach from the drone and fly them back here. And each contestant will do this in a one at a time approach. No going and getting two balls in one trip.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The event will be timed to see how fast the competitors can accomplish the retrieval mission,&quot; Pauline continued, &quot;but the heights and different directions will not be the ONLY impediment that the contestants will be facing. As I&#39;m sure many are aware in the stands, we have various fans and heaters and even air conditioning running in places here inside the arena. This will manipulate localized air currents that each contestant will have to contend with. Some may be able to use them to increase their speed while others will have to power through them... or find a way to avoid being slowed down by them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The points will be based both on how many of the balls are retrieved and the time taken,&quot; JC moved into the final steps, and it was in this section where he and Pauline were in agreement on it maybe being a good idea they didn&#39;t sign up. While both Microraptor Dinotopians could mimic some of what Arcelia could do with regard to powered flight, but ultimately not as well. Most of that came from the flight feathers on their legs. They couldn&#39;t flap their legs as well as their wings and the natural leg motion for powered flight would only increase drag.  And while their better gliding abilities with the four &quot;wings&quot; would help them grab the balls easier, they wouldn&#39;t be able to reach them as easily. &quot;And note that some drones may move after a ball has been recovered and returned to the desk. And now... let us begin in the order in which each contestant from our flyers entered the tournament...&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
From there, the races then went on. To a degree, there were fewer Pterosaur other flying Dinotopians that were in the contest, which often made a bit of sense as there were many people that often became Dinotopians because of an interest in some of the elements of size and strength that came with the large Dinotopians.  Some might be interested in the flight elements that came with Pterosaurs, and that had mirrored a lot why Sophie had picked Pterodactylus when the possibility of becoming a Dinotopian became an option, but that would still battle with those that wanted the size and strength of Sauropods, the ferocity of the larger Theropods, the perceived brain power of the Raptors, or the weapons of the armored or horned Dinosaurs.<br />
<br />
However, this didn&#39;t remove closeness of the competition and both Sophie and Roland had a fair number of cheers when it was their turn execute the race. For them, a lot of it was relatively easy as they&#39;d adjusted quite well to feeling the wind and air currents moving over their heads and wings, though, it wasn&#39;t something that was left to just her. Both Fred and Quetzal did surprisingly well, and some of this was probably a part of the fact that returning the balls to the desk was a one at a time effort and it was something that heavily tested Sophie and Roland&#39;s time. Once Sophie finished her run and had a decent time and having recovered all the balls, she found herself following Fred and Quetzal&#39;s run almost as close as she did for Roland&#39;s, and the female Quetzalcoatlus she taught to fly did quite well, even with a slower time than Sophie and Roland&#39;s. Sophie figured that a lot of Quetzal&#39;s progress was likely in some of the training she&#39;d been working on to improve her own flight endurance. The worst that hit the two Quetzalcoatlus Dinotopians was that Fred dropped one ball while trying to better position it in his grasp.<br />
<br />
Though, the small number of flying Dinotopians then made many things close as in some cases, fractions of a second were often what kept them all separated, and in some cases experience also mattered. This was where Norrie actually did quite well. Her species of Pterosaur wasn&#39;t as large as Fred and Quetzal, and she&#39;d been an Ornithocheirus than any of the other flying Dinotopians. It was only her larger size than Sophie and Roland that ultimately slowed her down a bit, but Roland still only edged Norrie out for second behind Sophie by a few fractions of a second. The next few then tight race where things became even closer. Buzz and Hazel ran fairly quick times, but Hazel found her tail caught some of the air currents just as well as her wings did, and when going under one set of blowers for the air conditioners, that blower caught her tail and sent a chill up Hazel&#39;s spine. The result was that she flared her wings and ended up dropping one of the rubber balls. She managed to safely land and retrieve the ball from the mat, but that ball didn&#39;t count because it did fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
Buzz showed he&#39;d become quite a strong flyer and could build up a lot of speed, but in some cases, it also proved a bit too much. He never dropped a ball, but at times he&#39;d built up so much speed in racing to drone and to grab the ball that he also had to bank wide and circle for a time in order to land and return the ball. This in turn cut down on Buzz&#39;s time, which essentially then put him in a position to tie with Fred in terms of the time and Quetzal in retrieving all the balls in. Of those competing, Arcelia ultimately had the slowest time, but she managed to bring all the balls in and put on a display that was actually seen as quite smart. Some of the heating and cooling efforts didn&#39;t bother or help her as much as it did the Pterosaurs and showed some of the differences between them and the early birds, which Archaeopteryx technically was. Arcelia accepted the slower pace to get to height and then dove down quickly, rolling inverted before getting to the drone, grabbing the ball and then continuing to dive down and gradually flaring her wings and banking slowly. It allowed her to make for where her uplifting had hurt her ability to maintain powered flight by diving, and it cut down on her timing. It was something that actually allowed her to maintain a time that wasn&#39;t too far behind the Pterosaurs in terms of time.</p>
