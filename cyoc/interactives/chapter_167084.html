<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa saw no possible way to escape the need to open the bedroom door, she being in a bedroom on the second floor of their family home. Feeling nervous from wonder as what might happen when Jerome saw not his lover but a half sheep, and worse a male, she approached the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
Slowly she turned the doorknob and eased the door open, as Jerome was sitting, he waiting, his red cock poking three inches of length out past the end to the sheath. Jerome was quick and he seeing as knew the scent of his lover girl, he changed into the bedroom. Jerome whirled in a quick turn to see then an equally quick Lisa then a male sheep, she stepped through the doorway and closed the door behind her, leaving her outside the door and standing in the upstairs hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, that was easy,&quot; Lisa mumbled, she feeling elated as from her escaping Jerome and what he might have done to her. Although Jerome and likely too, Jeff having seen and smelled the woolly creature who exited the room so swiftly, caused the big dog to begin barking.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is all the noise,&quot; Lisa heard her father say, he in his bedroom, he having made use of the shower.<br />
<br />
Lisa felt again the flight - fright instinct arise in her and she/he dug her cloven hoofs into the carpet and made a mad dash for the stairs. She as much ran down the stairs not missing any steps, not tripping or falling, finding her sheep legs as soundly strong and agile. She was of hope her luck was changing as swinging a turn at the bottom of the stairs she failed to meet her mother.<br />
<br />
Lisa slowed her run and listened, hearing the sounds of her mother in the lower basement level, she slamming then the door to the clothes dryer machine. This was a perfect time for Lisa and her walking on cloven hoofs to  clip-clop her way across the slate tile kitchen floor, and exit out into the garage.<br />
<br />
Moving with a rhythmic mode of stepping having cloven hoofs tromping against the hard slate tiled floor, her mother heard the sound and called from below, &quot;Hey there girl, what is all the stomping?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa felt the flight urge going critical, her heart pounding, adrenaline flowing, as every muscle of her new self recoiled as ready to run with due haste. As she jumped down over the three steps from the kitchen floor height to the cement garage floor and saw then the garage door as left open, she ran to find some safer haven.<br />
<br />
As run did Lisa, she ran while feeling scared for being seen by anybody of their neighborhood. She felt her body responding to her wish as need to get away from all human surroundings. Her thought was channeled toward her running to the Killingsworth ranch, where lived John her friend. As what John would or could do for her strange situation she did not know, but he was a friend.<br />
<br />
Lisa ran, dashing across streets to run between houses, while admiring her agility and the speed of her ability to run using cloven hooves. She heard the voice of some child holler about seeing a sheep running through their backyard; as this spurred her to run faster, and welled up in her a desire to run faster.<br />
<br />
Benson creek and Lisa felt an urge to stop and take a needed refreshing drink. As she tried to lower herself there on the bank of the slow flowing creek, she discovered that her arms and hands had made the changing. Her running and the adrenaline worked to enhance the speed to her body changing species. Feeling upset and at the same time Lisa was capable to admire her new forelegs, she knelt by the creek as would a sheep wanting a drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no hands to use for cupping up the  water, guess it is time to learn how a sheep drinks,&quot; Lisa thought as well tried to say, but her tongue seemed tangles and quite uncoordinated. As she leaned with due care as not to fall into the creek water, Lisa peered down at the slow moving water and stared.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; did Lisa think to say, but what was her new manner of annunciation was not a word, but the common baaing sound of a sheep. &quot;My face, I have the face and head like a Ram sheep!&quot; Lisa thought but dared not try to say any words. As wide eyed gawking she forgot to take a drink and knelt there looking at what was her reflection.<br />
<br />
Her usual bright blue eyes were then as dark pools as she realized her vision had changed, and colors she saw when a human were faded now that she became as all a sheep. Her cute nose that Daddy liked to give a loving peck-kiss had merged with her mouth to form a muzzle. Her face had a light coat of curly wool, but her muzzle had on it a light fuzziness. As she peered at her reflection Lisa noted how her ears were oval shaped, slightly pointy, and extra sensitive for hearing slightest of sounds.<br />
<br />
A planned reach then to drink and she saw her teeth as how they were set differently, and she knew she had finalized her transition to becoming a sheep and a Ram.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baa...,&quot; Lisa cried as she pushed her muzzle into the cool water of the creek. She sucked up the water, swallowing quite a bit and when feeling as satisfied, she stood up, but stood on all fours. Undecided as what to do or where to go, Lisa walked along side the creek, she following it blindly, being mentally befuddled due to her knowing she became as is a sheep.<br />
<br />
The small creek did wander the countryside, and so did Lisa as she felt scared and unsure what to do or where to go. She noticed the sun as setting and night coming soon, with her as a naked animal, was alone, and knew little as how she could protect herself from any predictor she might meet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Lisa, what a day you lived through to become like is Jeff, he a dog and you, me a sheep!&quot; Lisa thought about her day past, and wondered as to the new first full day of her being a sheep.</p>
