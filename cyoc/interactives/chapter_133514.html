<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Philip once more watched his living room vanish around him, surprised to realise that he could move slightly during the transition for the first time. Arriving in the bathroom once more, Philip gave a slight glance to his naked form in the mirror as he felt a tug towards his stall.<br />
 <br />
The tug started as he arrived and was as if something was slowly urging him to take his place willingly, he entered the stall yet sad whilst looking down at the large pipe before turning towards the mirror forward looking at himself as he began to lower.<br />
 <br />
Philip decided to just close his eyes, feeling his anus once again enlarge to match the large pipe protruding from the floor, feeling bliss as it entered spreading apart his buttcheeks as they settled on either side of the pipe as their form began to soften and wrap around it merging together. Feeling the tingling spread from his hands he could tell his skin texture began to take the porcelain look and feel as his make up was altered. Before even feeling the desire to pull in his legs, he did so as he placed his head flat against the wall behind him. His bowl and tank once again was taking shape, his vision suddenly returned as his eyes had finished transforming. Philip looked forward into the mirror seeing his dwindling features vanish as his large seat and lid formed once more finally settling into place.<br />
 <br />
Once again there was a large Disabled toilet in the stall, where before there was none. Philip settled as he looked towards his own reflection, “Nothing but a toilet, how am I supposed to accept that I can just become this…toilet, Lohse said I would be happy to continue this beyond this week, how could anyone in their right mind want this? Do I have brain damage?” Philip questioned himself continuously even as the door opened to the bathroom for the first time that day as what sounded as a group had just entered.<br />
 <br />
“Finally they unlocked it, I was starting to think these were out of order, but there&#39;s something I must ask since we arrived together in the car lets try our best to support each other” one voice said trying to sound supportive.<br />
 <br />
“Hmm, Sounds like a group of friends, god I hope they bypass me, I’m not ready, not yet…” Philip cried out wondering about having to face what he had avoided since last night.<br />
 <br />
As they approached the centre of the bathroom Philip could see their appearances in the mirror, there was three of them. Two of them be okay with the other stalls, but the last she was much larger still less then the large lady he had yesterday but still big enough that she may require his stall.<br />
 <br />
“I’m scared, I don’t want to be ridiculed” the largest one said.<br />
 <br />
“Don’t worry they see people like us everyday and they only wish to support us” Philip was now able to match this voice to the one that had entered first.<br />
 <br />
“Well I need the toilet” she said making her way to a stall just two down from where Philip was.<br />
 <br />
“Me two, god knows how long we are to wait”, entering the stall next to Philip’s.<br />
 <br />
The last girl looked in the mirror again, taking in her appearance, she had an apple like body, her rear wasn’t that large compared but her large breasts were easily visible form the outline of her top, resting easy on her stomach. Looking to enter a stall she noticed Philip, “Girls you got to see this” she said with a slight laugh.<br />
 <br />
“Oh the big toilet, I saw it as I entered mine, I thought I was too small, maybe you should go and try it out for us.” the first girl said with a sarcastic tone.<br />
 <br />
“Are you calling me fat?” the largest of them returned sarcastically.<br />
 <br />
“Well honey, we wouldn’t be here if we didn’t need help” the 3rd girl spoke, Philip could hear the regret in her voice, knowing full well the truth in her words.<br />
 <br />
As she began to enter Philip began to feel awful as she drew closer, “She’s gonna use me, just like yesterday, she gonna do her business then flus…..” Philip suddenly paused, for but a moment “Flush” emerged from his thoughts, distracted as he noticed her close the stall door.<br />
 <br />
Removing her trousers and underwear she sat on Philip, “I think you’re a little too small for me please get off please…” Philip was desperate he didn’t want to face it.<br />
 <br />
“I think I’m a little too small for this, but I can make do” his user said as she spoke to the other stalls.<br />
 <br />
“That’s good news I wonder how fat you must be to use it properly” laughing audibly as she flushed her own toilet. There was another flush from the other friend as they laughed together as they went to wash their hands.<br />
 <br />
Philip was silenced, the sound of the flushes shudder Philip, he felt tingles around his rim, as if a distant feeling.“<br />
 <br />
Philip was mentally at the back of his own head, thinking pretty thoughts when sudden his vision shifted once again, “no..” as he whimpered internally. With a trickle the large girl on top of him began to urinate into his bowl, though not as strong as before he couldn’t help but notice a strange sweetness to it, as if he could taste sugar in a drink. “She’s a diabetic” he realised. Though the big girl hardly fit the amount of light passing into his bowl he could see its cloudy look. The lady continued to pee for awhile longer before finally stopping, grasping sheets of toilet paper from beside him as she cleaned herself. Rising from his seat and lifting her underwear and trousers, she turned to Philip once more, not noticing her own cloudy business as she pulled his handle.<br />
 <br />
With a large sounding flush echoing around the bathroom Philip spiralling into bliss not even noticing that girls had left leaving his door just ajar as before.<br />
 <br />
“Be……. the toilet…………, NO! I won’t break…” Philip continued to struggle it was as if he was splitting into two , part of him could accept, the other half continued to fight.<br />
 <br />
It wasn’t long before another individual arrived, using the other toilets as time passed, Philip became anxious having to wait. “Why won’t someone use me…., what am I saying!, no please just flus.., arghhh!” Philip was crying out internally.<br />
 <br />
Over the next couple of hours many more people arrived, making use of the other toilets, yet afraid of the large toilet at the end commenting on its unwelcoming appearance, its size, or their own convincing themselves they didn’t need it.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t take this, please just use me” Philip begged, pleaded as if praying to a higher power.<br />
 <br />
The door opened once more to the sound of heavy foot steps entered, “Mom said I should be careful what I wish for..” telling himself internally, yanking his thoughts away from the idea of being used again.<br />
 <br />
As the two seats of feet approached Philip could hear a single individual with laboured breathing and assisted living tools that clanked across the floor as they drew closer.<br />
 <br />
“Its at the end miss, I will be outside if you need any help”, Philip knew this was it his 2nd one today, yet deep down he knew she might well be the biggest yet.<br />
 <br />
“Oh god here she comes” Philip could only look in shock as the nurse opened his door to the fullest, she must have been the fattest person he had ever seen. Leaving her assisted living walker behind as she held onto the walls while wearing a nursing gown, she eased her way inside. “I can see her stomach!” he said to himself, eyeing her belly as it hanged well past her knees, close to her ankles swaying side to side as she struggled to get inside noting the lack of the inability of the gown to cover her completely. With a struggle she closed the door as it brushed across her body, “God she’s too big for the stall, she’s too big for me!” he couldn’t help but stare as she turned around as she raised her gown lowering herself onto his seat as her stomach forced her legs apart.<br />
 <br />
“Ahhh” she said as she relaxed, Philip moved his point of view around his form hoping to see past her to get a better look but it was no use, she was so large she blocked any angle from him seeing into the mirror, at this point he could only feel.<br />
 <br />
“What’s that?” he thought as something was brushing the lower part of his exterior bowl and base. As she adjusted herself it slapped against his base, suddenly it dawned on him, “Its her belly! It hangs down that far holy shit, how can you do this to yourself” yet Philip was taken back by his own comment, she might be beyond obese yet he was the toilet.<br />
 <br />
Philip could feel it coming, his eyes shifted to the bowl once more, yet to his own surprise he couldn’t see, not even a seam of light, he was in utter darkness, “She must be covering all the light” he felt relief but for only a moment.<br />
 <br />
With a sudden rumble oily fatty stools rained down into his bowl as she began to relieve herself. “argggghhhh, the taste its….. overpowering, I can’t think!” Philip felt as if he was going to pass out. The stream didn’t end as the faeces continued to fill his bowl, “The... water.. line its rising” he couldn’t escape the feeling she was starting to fill his immense bowl.<br />
 <br />
Slowly the water level rose as the spread of its taste began to impact more of what was his taste buds, suddenly as it started the stream ended as she began to urinate, “Please flush me, please, please don’t leave me like this”. he said weeping to himself. As she finished she gripped the support handles rising.<br />
 <br />
“I need a little help” she cried out.<br />
 <br />
“Ok I’m coming in” the nurse struggled to open the door but the obese woman did her best as it opened all the way.<br />
 <br />
“I can’t wipe, I’m sorry” the obese lady said.<br />
 <br />
“I know that&#39;s why were here” as she reached into her pockets unpacking a sealed pair of hand gloves then reaching over for for some toilet paper”.<br />
 <br />
Philip was shocked, he knew she couldn’t reach her own anus but getting someone else to do it how degrading. Again Philips thoughts slipped, realising once again his own predicament.<br />
 <br />
Fitting in the room as best she could, she used the toilet paper now in hand as she wiped away any excrement from her behind as she cleaned the rest of her, looking into the bowl with a face of disgust. “All done, I will escort you back to your bed” the nurse said as politely as she could.<br />
 <br />
“Thank you its nice to get out of it even if its for just a moment” she said gratefully.<br />
 <br />
For a moment Philip did see a sense of pride in the nurses face, she wanted to help as he noticed her removing her rubber gloves, dropping them into the bowl as it sank to the bottom. “I can’t taste anything but…” Philip hoped for the gloves to give a distraction.<br />
 <br />
“Come we have to get you back to bed we can’t have you on your knees too long” the obese lady eased her way out, grasping once more onto her assisted living walker as the nurse began to close his door as they began to leave.<br />
 <br />
“WHAT!, DON’T GO!, WAIT!!!!!!” Philip screamed out he could hear them as they made their way towards the exit leaving the bathroom entirely.<br />
 <br />
“no no no NO!!!!!! This can’t help happening, THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING!” He began to go mental crying out internally as he whimpered. Looking down into his bowl all he could see was a mound of excrement with the pair of gloves somewhere bellow as the taste continued to overwhelmed his senses. Looking into the door mirror in front of him he knew it it wasn’t pretty.<br />
 <br />
“I look like a disused toilet full of shit, I look disgusting, this is the worst thing that could have happened during the entire week” Philip was shocked, he was right, there in the mirror sat nothing other than a disgusting toilet full of unflushed waste.<br />
 <br />
The door opened again, “please be the cleaner….” he said with sorrow.<br />
 <br />
“ugh, what&#39;s that smell” as the first one entered, sniffing the air.<br />
 <br />
“Its coming from one of the stalls”, the second one said with a more mature voice.<br />
 <br />
“Do your business and lets get out of here”, the first said in reply.<br />
 <br />
The end stall opened, “This ones fine, I’ll just go here”, the mature one replied.<br />
 <br />
“Fine but I’m gonna find a window and open it, it reeks in here. Philip could hear her approaching as she opened his stall looking at the wall as she noticed the toilet. “I found the source of the stench” yelling over to her friend. “Flush it will you” came from the other end of the bathroom.<br />
 <br />
“Once I get this window open” she said, unlatching the lock on the window, opening it to its widest setting, “That should help” as she reached over and pulled his handle. His tank began to empty into the bowl. “Philip felt bliss once more yet it cut short as if it was missing something.<br />
 <br />
“Eww, its blocked, its filling over the edges” she said dashing back out his stall<br />
 <br />
“Shit I’m overflowing” he began to panic, he could taste the waste everywhere at this point though his bowl as it flowed over his seat, dripping then flowing down his sides and down to his base and across the floor that surrounded him. “Oh my god what has she done”<br />
 <br />
“Come I’m done, lets get out of here before people blame us” she said as she exited the end stall in a rush forgetting to flush the toilet she just used.<br />
 <br />
Philip could only look in the large mirror as he saw all the waste that stained the exterior of his bowl, looking down he had what looked like a small pond that failed to recede, he could feel the blockage further down. “It must have been those gloves collecting the waste and blocking me” he thought.<br />
 <br />
Philip sat covered in waste, tasting everything as he looked at himself in utter ruin. Yet he slowly drifted off to sleep as people entered and left suddenly after seeing the state of the bathroom as he went unused for several hours.<br />
 <br />
Philip awoke to being unclogged by the cleaner he saw yesterday. “Come on” she urged as she used gloves that went up to her shoulders as she gripped at the blockage, finally pulling it free. “Fucking nurses throwing gloves down the toilets, just cause its a big one doesn’t stop the glove from collecting the water and expanding” she then disposed of it in a bio-hazard bag beside her as the water began to recede.<br />
 <br />
“Ahhhhh finally” Philip didn’t feel like he was flushed but felt a pleasing feeling as the water left, looking down his rim was stained filthy. “Huh I can hardly taste it now” he thought to himself. Hearing the same robotic voice regarding the bleach, the cleaner disposed of her arm gloves into the same bio-hazard bag as she bleached his interior bowl once more. “Must have been the preparation for this” he wondered to himself.<br />
 <br />
The cleaner continued for what felt like 30 minutes as she scrapped away the waste and cleaned his base from top to bottom as she left to mop up the mess, leaving Philip with a bowlful of bleach to soak in before finally returning to flush him, “I’ll give them a piece of my mind when I see them” she said furiously as she left the bathroom.<br />
 <br />
“What a reward…….., no….… just…. got to last the week, I can prove her wrong” he reassured himself.<br />
 <br />
The water finally settled into his tank and bowl as he began to relax, looking once more at his reflection as if nothing had happened today, yet there was a shine across his form. “I look a little different, shinier…, the cleaner must have used something special on me, ah well I made it….., become the toilet…., haha not yet Lohse, not yet” he continued telling himself.<br />
 <br />
For the remainder of the day the other stalls continued to be used, Philip felt a little ignored but knew of the price. As the sun set once more he heard the entrance to his bathroom lock. With that his form began to shift once more, releasing his limbs and body as he separated from the confinements around him, standing he felt the shift as he returned home.<br />
 <br />
“God what a day..” he thought to himself as he prepared his dinner, while it cooked he watched his TV, adverts for toilet supplies, from toilet rolls to bleach. “I should get some of that for my own bathroom” chuckling to himself as he got up to use to use his own toilet.<br />
 <br />
“This is so strange these past two days, becoming the very thing I’m sitting on then coming home as a job…. huh.. beats being a politician any day, its easier to take shit than talk shit” laughing loudly as he flushed his own toilet. Suddenly his mind focused on the noise closing his eyes, shacking his head side to side as if to distract himself. He left the bathroom to finish his dinner, as he sat down to eat, he continued to watch several shows late into the evening as he drifted off to sleep in his arm chair.<br />
 <br />
“Where am I…. uh I’m in the bathroom.. I must of slept though the night…*yawn*” he saw his toilet form once more in the mirror, as he mentally adjusted to his surroundings, suddenly his vision was blocked as he noticed the heavy woman from yesterday as she turned around to sit once more.<br />
 <br />
“NO NOT AGAIN!” thinking loudly to himself.<br />
 <br />
Another load of oily fatty stools fell into his bowl as she contrived to fill him, yet he couldn’t taste the rancid filth he couldn’t taste anything, just hints of Chinese take-out, fish and other greasy foods. She got up once more as he eyed the nurse coming in to clean her, eventually she moved out of his stall as they left the bathroom, ignoring him completely again.<br />
 <br />
“Flush me you bitch, come back, flush me, FLUSH ME!” he continued to cry out as he awaited release.<br />
 <br />
Waking with a sweat on his face he could see the alert of his computer in his living room preparing his day with less than 20 seconds to go, rushing out of his chair he made it in time as the shift began.</p>
