<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In this story, there is mention a dark spider-goddess named Uttu. Why Uttu rather than the usual Lolth? Because Lolth was specially created for Dungeons & Dragons, and while others pen & paper R.P.G. have used her since then, I preferred to use a public domain name. <br/>
<br/>
Uttu was a spider goddess from the Ancient Sumerian pantheon, and WASN&#39;T on the side of evil. But being Sumerian myth, her name is public domain, and I needed a (false) spider goddess, and I needed her to be evil, and couldn&#39;t imagine a good name by myself, so you get an evil Uttu who&#39;s only pretending to be a goddess.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While you could try to think of a solution for Ariane&#39;s problem, lets be honest: If a mechanical genius like <strong><em>the</em></strong> Inaya Akila El Houari can&#39;t think one, there is few hope of anyone else present doing so. No, the true problem is that Inaya have a tendency to over-concentrate on a problem, often forgetting to do anything else. You need to make her think of something else for a time, and maybe when she come back to it, she might approach the problem from another angle and find a solution.<br />
<br />
You know she&#39;s often asked to help other teams of Valkyries, generally when they want Akila to use her herculean force. And she often end up bringing a better solution than using brute force, which combined with her vocabulary and perfect speech pattern always impress anyone that don&#39;t know her, but can see she&#39;s an orcann.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you need to change your mind, come back to it later. In the mean time, why don&#39;t you share some anecdotes about some of the missions you helped other teams with? Nothing confidential of course.&quot; Since you are presently in your natural form but out of duty, you say all this in a flirting tone, going so far as leaning suggestively against Inaya while asking her to share some of her ‘solo’ adventures. It make said orcann roll her eyes, albeit goodheartedly. She know its just your nature as a succubus expressing itself, and you&#39;re aware nothing will ever come of it. …Not that you would mind if it did.<br />
<br />
Inaya was about to start her first story, when a Drider came out of a shadow in a dark corner of the ceiling. &quot;If the ‘problem’ is finding a place on Ariane&#39;s armor to display her rank, I have an idea.&quot; Not wanting to look down at you any longer, the newcomer came down to the ground, walking on the wall to do so. &quot;You could use my silk, the non sticky kind, to weave some epaulets that would naturally fall where her shoulder-guards should be when she isn&#39;t flying, but would only be attached by the top so they wont impede her when she <strong>is</strong> in the air.&quot;<br />
<br />
The drider with a good solution for Ariane&#39;s problem was your penultimate teammate, and apparently the last piece needed to finally remember all of your new reality. The invasion force at your old school? It was an army of surprisingly organized drows, which suggest they were commended by someone else. Maybe the false goddess Uttu herself, a demoness that looked like a drow-headed spider and was worshiped by the elf-like abominations.<br />
<br />
All that is known for sure is what was their objective: to give their goddess ‘blessing’ to all the dark-skinned people at school, or in other terms, to turn them into driders.<br />
<br />
There is two thing you need to know about driders. Firstly, whatever was their gender before they become a giant spider, once someone became a drider they&#39;re always female. Secondly, once turned into a drider, dows usually become blind follower of Uttu, even if they were among the few ones that <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> worship her before. Apparently, turning a human into a drider is a bit less efficient on that front, but not by much.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your</strong> drider is a childhood friend of Inaya who used to be an ordinary human boy. A <strong>black</strong> boy, which made him one of the drows&#39; targets. His ancestors were slaves who worked in what would eventually become Brazil, and were among those using the few free time they had to create what they pretended to be a new dance to honor god but was, in reality, a training so they could fight for their liberty: An art called capoeira.<br />
<br />
So with how much his ancestors frighted for their liberty, he wasn&#39;t about to let anything turn him into a slave, not even if it altered his mind on top of his body. His lower part had already entirely turned into a spider, and he could feel the rest of him turning more feminine by the second, he was able to mostly stay himself in mind by sheer force of will, but it wasn&#39;t enough against Uttu&#39;s tempting voice in his head, and he could sense he would succumb eventually.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s about that time he saw the girl he had a crush on, you, land before him. (Yes, already in middle-school your unnatural attractiveness seduced boys.) Normally he would simply have given you a kiss on the cheek, and only if he had been able to overcome his shyness. Or he would have fled screaming, since you weren&#39;t disguised anymore. Since he wouldn&#39;t be himself soon, he decided to do something he saw adults do when they like each other, while he still could, and he put his lips on your own. It was only for a few seconds, but it had quite the consequences.<br />
<br />
The first impact of his short and rather chaste kiss, was that the drider he finally become was mostly just a girl version of the boy he was. <br />
<br />
The second was linked to the fact you&#39;re a succubus princess. The drider curse is made so any of its victim worship a set royal demon like it was a god, to actually <strong>think</strong> of it as a god. Usually, it&#39;s the empress Uttu, but in the case of <em>your</em> drider, it is none other than yourself. She <strong>does</strong> know you&#39;re no goddess, but is forced to think of you as such, and no one can do anything about it, not even yourself.<br />
<br />
The third concerned the other peoples being turned into driders, the one that hadn&#39;t totally succumbed at least. They somehow felt that one of them was able to break all connections with Uttu, and it rejuvenated their fighting spirit against the (other) false goddess. That said, with Uttu&#39;s now enraged voice in their mind, they weren&#39;t much help on the physical battle.<br />
<br />
Your new follower, on her side, wasn&#39;t hearing any voice in her head. Not only that, but she seemed to have gained all knowledge the few driders on the enemy side, be it former drows or human having succumbed to Uttu&#39;s power, were gifted. It include how to make her body produce all kind of poisons, all the way to use her silk in fight, be it as trap or otherwise, even how to soak it in her poisons. She also was able to disappear into a shadow, only to reappear from another, a capacity that seemed to be shared by all drows, even the driders one, but not the other human-turned-driders.<br />
<br />
Until then, even with your keen strategic mind, you were only able to stall the drows&#39; progression. But with the unexpectedness help of your drider, the battle turned into a literal bloodbath. Whoever commanded the drows, be it Uttu, one of the demons at her service or someone else altogether, decided to cut their loss and ordered their remaining force to retreat. All of the living drows were able to go through the teleportation-portal, but only a small number of the former humans were able to follow, most of the others being entrapped in your follower&#39;s webbing.<br />
<br />
Once everything had calmed down, and Freyja came with her Valkyries, the clean-up commenced. The driders that conserved their human mind were given bracelets that disrupted their connection with Uttu, so they wouldn&#39;t hear her voice anymore. But even them got their memories altered, so they would think they accidentally stumbled in a gathering of drows performing a dark ritual and got cursed as a result, but where somehow able to escape before they lost themselves. Each of them <strong>do</strong> remember meeting an angel who gave them their bracelet disrupting Uttu&#39;s influence on them, but on totally different circumstances.<br />
<br />
You were with your drider, who tried to comfort Inaya, the young orcann wailing about having failed her best friend, unable to prevent him from turning into a drider. You barely knew your worshiper beyond the fact he was a classmate, and Akila was a total stranger back then, but you felt the need to be there for them. One of them saw you as a goddess after all! It should count as something, even if you definitely aren&#39;t one. You were so worried on how to help those two you didn&#39;t notice when Freyja approached you.<br />
<br />
The Corps General of all Valkyries startled you when she put her hand on your shoulder, in what she hopped was a reassuring gesture. &quot;You did good work here, young one. Far better than what would be expected from someone of your age. …Unlike the one that was supposed to do the job, who took decisions one would expect from a kid, ironically enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, miss Angel, can you help this one?&quot; you said, pointing to the drider trying to comfort her orcann friend. &quot;What turned her part-spider seem to force her to see me as a goddess, and I don&#39;t want to make God angry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, there is nothing that can be done. She fully transformed into a drider, trying to remove the curse would kill her. But don&#39;t worry, God isn&#39;t angry, he know it&#39;s not your fault. In fact, with how well you did in commanding the battle here, God would like to recruit you as a member of my Valkyries. The offer also extend to anyone that helped and is interested. What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t answer right away, needing to think on it. A time your drider used to ask something to Freyja. &quot;Why are all the other driders getting a bracelet but not me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, unlike you, their transformation is incomplete. The bracelet stop the mental influence of Uttu from affecting them. Theoretically it&#39;s also making them slowly revert back into their former self, but a human life is so short and their change so slow, they will be driders for the rest of their lives. On you the bracelet wouldn&#39;t even work.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t remember how your chat came back to the offer to become Valkyries, but you eventually accepted, along with a Harpy named Ariane Delaroute, a Centauride named Flore Woodlife, a still crying orcann named Inaya Akila El Houari and her drider friend, who was unable to give her name somehow. &quot;I still remember my old one, but I feel like I should change it. But I can&#39;t accept any name I come up with as my new one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because of your curse&quot; sadly answered Freyja, &quot;you need said name to come from the one you consider your goddess. Uttu rarely bother, so most drider end up nameless. Either way, once you get a name, or a lack of, it will activate what we call the ‘reverb effect’ of your curse. You see, being a drider won&#39;t just force you to see a royal demon as your god, it will also make said royal <strong>need</strong> you to see them as their god.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that you panicked a bit. &quot;Wait! Can&#39;t I simply decreed that she can get it from her parents or something? I would rather be her friend than her goddess…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you could. Especially since, her case being special, I need to explain what appended to her parents, at least partially. But you need to be here, and it won&#39;t prevent the reverb effect from activating, young Hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this, you approached your drider and said &quot;I know your curse force you to revere me as a goddess, even knowing I&#39;m not, but… I hope we can still be friend. That, in time, you can learn to see me as a friend first, and a goddess only second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like that, but can only promise to <em>try</em>.&quot; she answered, a timid smile on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s all I ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akila, for her part, didn&#39;t trust you one bit back then and insisted to come along when you went to see her childhood friend&#39;s parents. A decision all of you were grateful for a few moments later, when said parents rejected the young drider, calling an “abomination full of malice”. Freyja was forced to intervene and erase all memories of their child from the unworthy parents&#39; mind.<br />
<br />
The rejected girl, Freyja and you ended at Akila&#39;s house, who explained the situations to her parents, with the help of the Valkyrie. In the mean time, you were trying to comfort the young drider. &quot;I know they were your parents, but they didn&#39;t even <strong>try</strong> to see beyond appearances. And saying you&#39;re full of malice? If malicious people save as much lives as you did today, then the world need more people ‘full of malice’! You should wear it as a badge of pride, coming from them!&quot; Realising what you just said, you added. &quot;Sorry, I know it&#39;s not something nice to say, but…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I understand. Say, were you suggesting I take ‘Malice’ as my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Almost, my <em>Malicia</em>.&quot; You were about to say no, but thought it wasn&#39;t so bad an idea in the end.<br />
<br />
The newly named Malicia blushed, probably because her goddess called her ‘<em>my</em> Malicia’. You saw it and found it utterly cute. You also noticed that her nervousness made her sort-of wringing her t-shirt with her pedipalps. Because of this, you saw that where a spider as their head or whatever, where a human as their crotch, on the strange hybrid between the two she had, Malicia have a vagina. A rather human one at that.<br />
<br />
What you hadn&#39;t noticed is that Akila had come back some time ago, and was observing the two of you interact. &quot;Thanks, for helping my best friend calm down&quot; she said, surprising you. Apparently, she was a bit less mistrusting of you than before. Addressing Malicia, she added &quot;I&#39;ve got good news: We found you a foster family. Not only do you get awesome parents and a lot of nice aunts, but also the best sister ever: Myself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Since then, the El Houaris take care of Malicia like she was their own. Inaya and your drider even call each others sisters.<br />
- – — – -<br />
Malicia and you became more than just friend, you&#39;re dating each other. Sure, you are her ‘goddess’, but for her you are her girlfriend first and foremost, the rest only come after. Well… Unless you&#39;re on duty, then you are her leader first and the rest only come after.<br />
<br />
On her armor, If you look at her shoulder-guards, you can see the Star of Life above her rank, marking her as your team healer. It was her decision to learn first aid and healing magics, a bit like she wanted to prove to herself her former parents were wrong, that she could help people. But it still not enough for her, she would like to become a doctor.<br />
… And you know she can, you just hope she won&#39;t renounce her dream thinking she need to quit the team to do so.</p>
