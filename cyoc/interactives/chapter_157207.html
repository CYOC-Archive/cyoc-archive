<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr Jenkins groaned as the vile concoction got to work. He quickly started to feel bloated and numb as his bones and organs seemed to grow and shift under his skin.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Lily and Serena were busy ordering their subordinates around as they prepared for the imminent transformation. A pair of burly Zoo workers roughly dragged the changing doctor outside before throwing him carelessly inside a large fenced-off enclosure.<br />
<br />
The two sisters knelt down on the other side of the fence as Jenkins shakily rose to his hands and knees. He grimaced as he crawled towards them, clearly in immense pain as his innards quickly changed.<br />
<br />
Jenkins leant against the fence with one hand, clearly trying to stand in defiance of the two bitches watching him. But try as he might he couldn’t get up. He felt utterly drained of energy as the evil formula forced his body to re-wire itself. He tried to plead with them but his words were choked with gurgles and low moans of discomfort.<br />
<br />
However the severity of Dr Jenkins’ condition did nothing to stop Lily and Serena from rubbing it in.<br />
<br />
“Aww look sis, I think he’s trying to say something” Serena teased. <br />
<br />
“Yeah he’s probably begging us to stop; just like our friend over at the Stables begged him to stop. Did you really think you could just turn your boss into a stallion one day without feeling any repercussions? Well if that’s so then you really do deserve to have wound up here with us!”<br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins tried desperately to explain that the business in the stables had all been a misunderstanding. But all that came as was more of the same choked gargling as the man’s voicebox was overwhelmed by the changes. <br />
<br />
However, aside from losing his voice, there were other tell-tale signs that Dr Jenkins wouldn’t remain as a human for much longer. Most notably he had grown considerably in terms of height, weight and girth as his skeleton and muscles had stretched and reformed to match his intended species. He had practically exploded out of his clothes as his chest had fattened-up and become barrel-shaped.<br />
<br />
To make these changes possible the doctor’s arms and legs had also adjusted themselves. All four appendages had grown thick and un-flexible, designed simply to carry the enormous weight of his growing body. His hips had now snapped into a new orientation, ensuring that Dr Jenkins would never walk on two feet again.<br />
<br />
Alongside this, the doctor’s skin had transitioned into tough, wrinkly, grey hide as it spread across his body. Added to this, Jenkins now sported a short tufted tail which casually dangled behind him. By this stage the horrified doctor had worked out what he was destined to become: an elephant!<br />
<br />
Lily and Serena continued to chuckle as Dr Jenkins’ face twisted and contorted in pain. “I think he’s coming along nicely,” Serena said with a smile “don’t you sis?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Lily replied, “but there’s still one key area that could use some work.”<br />
<br />
“Oh you didn’t…” Serena asked questioningly. Her sister replied with a knowing smile. “Oh I love it when they realise what’s happening, especially the men. This is going to be hilarious.”<br />
<br />
Right on cue the transformation struck Dr Jenkins’ manhood. The tiny organ, which had remained human-sized, was barely even noticeable as it hid between the doctor’s massive thighs. <br />
<br />
But it was clear to see that something was wrong based purely on Dr Jenkins’ alarmed reaction. His eyes shot wide open before he quickly bent down to check that everything was ok. Jenkins could just see past the outline of his rounded belly that his cock and balls seemed to be shrivelling up and shrinking. He looked back at the two sisters with panic in his eyes, shooting them a glare as if to say ‘how could you do this?’<br />
<br />
However, the two onlookers only added insult to injury as they both burst out laughing. <br />
<br />
Dr Jenkins shut his eyes, hoping to drown out the laughter. However, this tactic did nothing to distract him from the intense sensations coming from between his legs. He let out a low bestial groan as a long vertical slit started to form beneath his tail. He shifted about in discomfort as he felt his cock and balls being swallowed up by the large saggy orifice. More moans of protest echoed across the enclosure as a new channel opened up, connecting Jenkins’ new sex to his developing womb.<br />
 <br />
With this dramatic process out of the way the rest of the transformation seemed to speed up as female hormones surged through the doctor’s inhuman body. The doctor’s neck thickened as tough hide covered its surface. Then, to further cement the doctor’s new feminine body, a pair of long, thick, and hyper-sensitive nipples poked out between his hind legs. Now all that remained was the man’s still-human head.<br />
<br />
This soon changed as Jenkins felt a strange tingling in his nose. Although he knew what was coming the changing man couldn’t help crying out in despair as his face stretched forward, causing a long trunk to spill down towards the floor. This new feature was soon joined by a set of small ivory tusks and a pair of large flapping ears.<br />
<br />
After a few more tweaks to his body were complete and the last patches of pink skin were filled in, the sickening process was done. The man that was once Dr Jenkins was now a large cow elephant!<br />
<br />
“Brilliant!” the two sisters called out as they high-fived. “It’s always fun to see an arrogant man getting the justice they deserve” Lily said in a mocking tone. Isn’t that right doctor err… mister…err miss…”<br />
<br />
“Jen?” Serena suggested with a smile.<br />
<br />
“Yes, ‘Jen.’ I like Jen&quot; Lily announced as she smiled back.<br />
<br />
They then moved closer to inspect the latest addition to the African Savannah. The new elephant seemed to be an exquisite specimen of healthy size and weight, and; most importantly, she was well-equipped to participate in the Zoo’s breeding regime. Thanks to the ingenious transformation formula, any newly-created female animals instantly entered heat, just to make breaking their resistance that little bit easier.<br />
<br />
In Jen’s case this tactic was already working like a charm. Although still dazed and exhausted from the horrific transformation he, or rather ‘she,’ could feel an intense throbbing emanating from deep inside her. New animalistic urges were already creeping into her jumbled mind. Her body wanted her to accept her fate and give in. Thoughts of being mounted and claimed by powerful males already started to stir. The human side of the elephant’s mind still retained overall control, but this was slowly being eroded as the heat grew in intensity.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, as Jen tried to make sense of the situation, Lily and Serena were busy dishing out more orders. Given the urgency with which they spoke, it was obvious that they had something special planned.<br />
<br />
In fact, it turned out that…</p>
