<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>It's been quite a while since I've posted.  I've been quite busy though.  The last chapter, Confrontation, is definitely not one of my better works, but that doesn't matter.  I'm sorry for taking so long to write again, but here we are!  Back for more.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I noticed that in the chapter What the Future Holds, I used the wrong name for Lucien and Marcelle, confusing their last name, Bordeaux, with Barteaux.  The funny thing is that the Barteaux family is a family from a completely different story I wrote on a different site!  My mind is weird...<br/>
<br/>
Post writing note.  This chapter came out weirdly, but its the start of something very different with the characters.  I hope you like it!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Warning.  Adult Language.<br />
<br />
July 19, 704<br />
<br />
It&#39;s been quite a while since Leopold failed at slaying you and Rowan.  But, what happened in that time?  The answer may not surprise you, but a lot happened.  Eight years is a long time, but for our main characters, it felt like nothing.  Being the ageless beings you are, time doesn&#39;t really mean anything.  People grow up, people die, and yet you stay as if nothing had happened.  Many people consider immortality as a curse, watching your friends and family die, with you having no choice but to watch.  But, what if your friends and family are immortal as well?  Spending eternity with those who you love doesn&#39;t seem like such a bad thing after all.  It is surreal knowing that you are 27 years old while having the body of an 18 year old, and a dragon...<br />
<br />
Anyway, what happened in those eight years.  The technology that you helped pioneer in Kelper has improved greatly, not quite to the extent of your home plane, but a fair deal.  The E-Crystals have contributed to making devices similar to cell phones, but using magic rather than cell signals, and many other interesting technologies.  But, the important thing came very recently.  As Rowan mentioned, his power is almost constantly growing.  And, since your power is tied to his, yours is as well.  When he learns a new power, you follow closely behind.  It took a while for you to learn the Divine magic Rowan encountered when you almost died, but other than that, you&#39;ve been successfully following Rowan in his magical footsteps.  Recently, Rowan unlocked even more of his potential.  Mastery of Planar Travel.  Now, as long as he had some knowledge of the plane he wished to go to, he could travel anywhere in it with ease.  You followed closely behind on this.  It&#39;s just one more step gone before becoming the God Rowan was destined to become.  With that news out of the way, on with the story.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gannoth, do people really wear this in your home plane?&quot;  Rowan asked, trying and failing at adjusting the collar on his polo shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Master.  Robes, cloaks, and all of that kind of stuff fell out of fashion over 1000 years ago in my home plane.&quot;  You explained, fixing Rowan&#39;s collar.  &quot;Honestly Master, you look good in this!&quot;  You smiled, looking at Rowan.  He was wearing a black polo with blue jeans and sneakers.  On his left wrist was a gold and silver watch, which went very well with his collection of magical rings.  He also wore a necklace which bore a gemstone that matched his violet eyes.  Meanwhile, you were in a t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers, with a watch that matched Rowan&#39;s.  In your right ear, a light blue stud earring twinkled in the light.  It perfectly matched your icy blue eyes.  Coupled with your tousled blond hair and your perfectly white teeth, you could make anyone swoon with a smile -- as long as they don&#39;t notice the demonic fangs...  &quot;Anyway Master, or Rowan as I&#39;ll be calling you when we get there, people don&#39;t know about magic in my home plane.  If they see us doing anything remotely magical, they&#39;ll freak out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know Gannoth.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;You told me a lot about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also Rowan.&quot;  You started.  &quot;Wow that&#39;s going to be weird to get used to.&quot;  You sidetracked.  &quot;Please start calling me Kevin.  It&#39;ll be better in that plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Gan..  Kevin.&quot;  Rowan said.  &quot;That feels weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both have weird things to get used to.&quot;  You smiled before grabbing Rowan&#39;s hand.  &quot;But like everything, we&#39;ll do it together.&quot;  With a grin from Rowan, you disappeared from the castle.<br />
<br />
When you reappeared, you were on a hiking trail in the middle of Maine.  &quot;I decided this would be a good place to appear because people wouldn&#39;t be here to see us randomly appear out of nowhere.&quot;  You were surrounded by forest.  Before you forgot, you conjured up a hiking backpack with the essentials for hiking in it.  &quot;So Rowan?  What do you think of my home?&quot;  There was silence from Rowan&#39;s mouth.  &quot;Master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kevin.  Do you feel that?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean.&quot;  You answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;This air.  It&#39;s filled to the brim with magic.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;I feel its power.  Its energy.&quot;  He took a deep breath in.  &quot;Kevin, I now see why you are such a powerful familiar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel it now.&quot;  You stated, realizing what Rowan was talking about.  &quot;Rowan, its not that magic doesn&#39;t exist here.  It&#39;s that people don&#39;t know how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And, since nobody can use it, it just permeates the air.  All of this magical potential!  It&#39;s ours!&quot;  Rowan smiled.  &quot;With this power, we will rule over the planes very soon.&quot;  You were speechless.  You never know that your home was full to the brim with unusable magic.  Yet, here you were, soaking up and breathing untapped magical energy.  Pure, unbridled power, waiting to be unleashed.<br />
<br />
After a couple of minutes of celebration due to this magical discovery, you started hiking down the path.  By the late evening, you made it to the end of the trail.  Thankfully, it ended in a parking lot.  &quot;Perfect.&quot;  You smiled.  &quot;We have road, and an empty parking lot.  Rowan, watch this.&quot;  With a simple snap of your fingers, a car appeared.  &quot;This is a car.  The main method of transportation in this plane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting.&quot;  Rowan was examining the car when a young couple pulled into the parking lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello strangers!&quot;  The woman yelled.  &quot;Did you just complete the green trail?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;  You answered.  &quot;We just did a small loop trail.  It was very nice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which trail is that?&quot;  The man asked.  &quot;I don&#39;t see it on the map.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;  You asked.  &quot;It&#39;s there on the map.&quot;  With a little magical help, you convinced the couple that the trail you were making up existed.  &quot;Anyway, I have to go.  My parents were expecting my brother and me home an hour ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We won&#39;t keep you waiting!&quot;  They smiled as they entered the trail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good time!&quot;  You yelled, waving them goodbye.  You got into the driver&#39;s seat, and Rowan in the passenger&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brother?&quot;  Rowan laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a cover story.&quot;  You smiled as you started the car.  &quot;Thankfully, this car&#39;s fuel source is magic, so we won&#39;t be running out of gas anytime soon.  Now let&#39;s see if I remember how to drive...&quot;  You fiddled around with the controls before the car started.  After a bit, you were on the road, cruising down Interstate 95.  The two of you talked about many things, mainly you telling Rowan about the plane.  At one point, you needed to stop at a rest stop on the highway to see where you were.  That&#39;s when you realized a problem.  &quot;Rowan, we have no money.&quot;  You said to him in the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why can&#39;t you just create some?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Money here is so intricately detailed that even you probably couldn&#39;t create accurate bills, despite how powerful you are.&quot;  You stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot;  You started.  &quot;Though there are ways...&quot;  You smiled evilly as you pulled into a parking spot.  You scanned the rest stop before noticing the ATM.  &quot;Perfect.  Rowan, follow me.&quot;  You and him walked over to the ATM.  Before doing anything, you made sure that there were no cameras.  Thankfully, there were not.  &quot;This is an ATM, or Automatic Teller Machine.  Here, people have cards that represent their money.  If they want cash that they can use upfront, similar to gold back home, they come to this machine, swipe their card, choose how much they want, and they get it.  The amount they get is deducted from their account, and they have cash.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And your point?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is my point.&quot;  You laughed as you put your hand on the machine.  Your hand glowed a faint yellow, before spewing $20 bills at you.  &quot;These things have a lot of money in them.  I just made it give all of it to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice thinking Kevin.&quot;  Rowan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?&quot;  You heard someone yell.  &quot;WHAT WAS THAT GLOWY SHIT WITH YOUR HAND?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rowan?  You want to take care of this one?&quot;  You asked, gathering up the many $20 bills.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing, brother.&quot;  Rowan smiled.  He looked around, and noticed no other people around.  &quot;That, what you saw, is magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic?  Like that shit that people do with cards?&quot;  The man asked angrily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you are referring to.  Magic is much deeper than most people here believe.&quot;  Rowan smiled evilly, conjuring a small fireball in his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot;  The man asked, becoming frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we can&#39;t let someone with this kind of knowledge live, can we brother?&quot;  You stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we can&#39;t.&quot;  With a snap of his fingers, Rowan sent the man straight to oblivion.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was anti-climactic.&quot;  You complained, holding hundreds of $20 bills.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t want to make a scene yet.&quot;  Rowan smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s going to notice that he&#39;s gone.&quot;  You smiled evilly.  &quot;Oh well.&quot;  You put all of the money into your car, keeping some on your person, and headed off to NYC.  When you got to the George Washington Bridge, you paid the toll and proceeded on the bridge.  &quot;Rowan, this is New York City.&quot;  You smiled, uncovering his eyes.  (You covered them to surprise him).<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa.&quot;  He gasped, looking at all of the skyscrapers.  &quot;It&#39;s huge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.  I think this&#39;ll be the perfect place to start.&quot;  You smiled evilly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Start what?&quot;  Rowan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think, with the significant power boost this plane gave us, we should take over this plane.&quot;  You grinned.  &quot;I mean, who can stop us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you make a scene?&quot;  Rowan asked.  &quot;It&#39;s your home plane, so I want your input.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to let loose.&quot;  You laughed evilly as you entered New York City.<br />
