<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff selected his girlfriend for the target. He didn&#39;t care what part of her he became, as long as it wasn&#39;t her asshole, and hit enter.<br />
<br />
The next thing he knew, he felt himself being tightly hugged by some tight fabric which was oddly hugging his entire new form. He could see light, but only bairly and certainly couldn&#39;t move on his own anymore. But, something didn&#39;t sit quite right with this whole situation. He couldn&#39;t for the life of him, figure out which part of her he had become. <br />
<br />
At first, he suspected her breasts, seeing as how he felt their were two parts of himself. But then that wouldn&#39;t explain the soft cushion resting on the top and on either side of him. The other oddity, which really threw him for a loop, was the moist opening above him, that ocasionally leaked a drop or two of something every so often. The last hint he had recieved was when Hailey, his girlfriend, had moved and he could feel himself bouncing and flopping around a bit inside of his dark fabric enclosure. <br />
<br />
Then he heard an alarm go off. He knew it well as his girlfriend&#39;s alarm clock, meaning she was in bed and just getting up now. And then there was light, as Hailey pulled off the covers. Then she nearly fainted on the spot. With a panicked expression, she reached a finger out towards her newest addition to her body. <br />
<br />
Jeff watched the finger approach him and was deeply worried for Hailey since she looked so frightened all of a sudden. Then she poked him, and a bit too hard too. Jeff was instantly sore and his whole body ached in an instant. Hailey felt as if she was about to puke too, as the sudden throbbing pain turned her stomach. <br />
<br />
Jeff knew this pain though. And it was not a good sign. He hoped he was wrong, but Hailey&#39;s grim expression wasn&#39;t helping. Then she confirmed his fears.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck? Why the fuck do I have fucking testicles?&quot; She whispered to herself in shock. &quot;And why are they so big?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff had become a pair of large testicles hanging down off of his girlfriend&#39;s pussy. He wanted to cry. They both did. Hailey stood up, feeling the weight of her new balls pulling down on her labia. She walked over to her mirror only to find that her balls seemed to have naturally repositioned to behind her thighs, and underneath her ass. It made her appear nornal-ish in the front at least, but having 2 large orbs underneath her ass cheeks was another problem. Today was chilly too, and all she had ready to wear were leggings. <br />
<br />
Without bothering to put on panties, she pulled up her leggings only ro realize her fears were correct. Behind her legs, were the very clear twin orbs of her balls. The material hugged their shape, perfectly displaying their presence to all who would look. It looked like 2 tenis balls were stuffed into her leggings. <br />
<br />
Jeff, after seeing himself in the mirror, was annoyed with himself. Mainly because he liked it. He didn&#39;t know why, but he found it very hot to see his girlfriend with a large pair of balls squeezed into a skin tight pair of leggings. The problem with this, is that it wasn&#39;t just himself now. If he got horny, his girlfriend got horny. And seeing this stunning reflection of themselves in the mirror was oddly really doing it for him. When Hailey realised she was getting turned on by her own reflection, she grew even more concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, I thought this would have been a lot better than this. Sorry Hailey&quot; Jeff apologized, not expecting her to hear him, but just to at least say it. However, Hailey stopped her panic and looked around the room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff?&quot; She asked. She definitely heard his voice just now. &quot;What are you saying? Did you do this to me somehow? And where are you?&quot; Realizing that he can talk to her and that she can hear him, Jeff starts to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you wanted to become part of my body, but didn&#39;t expect the device to give me balls. Right, if you were not said balls right now, i would say you are so full of shit. But... more importantly, this is fixable, right?&quot; Asked Hailey.<br />
<br />
&quot;It should be, but you will have to do it. Seeing as how I am just your balls now. I can walk you through it though. And... by the way. Don&#39;t get mad, but I kind of like the look of you having these massive balls. I don&#39;t know why really, but just looking at you in the mirror a while ago was really turning me on. More so than usual, which even I was surprised with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff... what are you saying? Do you have a thing for balls now? Is this your way of telling me that your gay or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO! No, definitely not that. I just find your balls attractive is all. And trust me, it is just your balls. No one elses. And I am being serious here too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, thanks for making me horny for my own balls, asshole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I was sorry, I didn&#39;t think it would give you balls. If I had known, I wouldn&#39;t have picked random.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, let&#39;s just get this over with. Im going to your house right now and undoing this.&quot; Said Hailey. She wasn&#39;t nearly as mad at Jeff as she was coming off as being.  In all honesty, she found the entire thing more funny than anything. But she was worried. She was worried because ever since she found them, she has slowly been comming around to the thought of having balls. It worried her because where she was once panicking to the point of nearly passing out, now she is actually finding them to be kinda interesting. Plus, they did make her VERY horny. <br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, keeping them for a while may not be so bad? Just to satisfy my curiosity at least&quot; she thought to herself as she unconsciously began fingering herself.</p>
