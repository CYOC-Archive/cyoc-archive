<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taken by surprise, Mike found himself pushed through the door. He felt briefly a slight tingling that reminded him of the time he&#39;d accidentally stuck a finger in the light socket, only not as bad and then he was through the door. Blinded by a light, struggling to adjust to the suddenness of it, he blinked and listened to what sound like a number of voices all talking and overlapping at once. Wondering where he was, and why there was a slight echo, Mike was at first grateful when his vision finally cleared, then horrified and embarressed by what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
Before him he could see a number of women and girls, all in a process of either getting dressed or undressing. More boobs and butts and crotches, some hairy, other bare, then he&#39;d ever seen greeted him. And then it hit him, as he realised that not a single one of the naked women appeared attractive or turned him on, that he was standing in a girl&#39;s locker room. Uttering, &quot;Shit, I&#39;ve got to get out of here before I&#39;m discovered,&quot; he hastily glanced about, glad that none of the people were paying attention to him.<br />
<br />
When he spotted what he thought was the way out, Mike considered the idea of putting a hand up to block his face, but decided against it, figuring it would draw attention to him. Quickly, but not fast enough to call attention to him, he headed across the room and toward a open doorway that had been cut in the wall. Hoping it would lead out, and not into the showers, he stepped over the threshold and cursed again when he found himself looking at sinks and a row of toilet cubicles. Realising he&#39;d walked into the bathroom part of the locker room, he turned to head back the other way and began to panic when he saw a group of women, talking amongst themselves, walking toward him.<br />
<br />
Certain that he was about to be ousted as a pervert or worse, Mike hastily looked about, then headed for the nearest of the stalls. Locking himself in, he sat down on the toilet, glad that it had a lid covering the seat, and listened as the women went about their business. Wishing they would hurry up and go away, Mike began to breath evenly and after a moment, found himself thinking of what Angelique had said and what he had thought he had seen looking down the shirt he was wearing.<br />
<br />
Her words, or what he could remember, seemed to him an odd way of saying goodbye to someone. Listening as the women continued to do whatever they were doing, he asked himself, &quot;Is this what she meant about with what I discovered that I should be happy?&quot; then wondered if maybe she had somehow set him up to be taken as a pervert, caught dressed in girl&#39;s clothes in a place he had no business being in. Drawing a blank, he heaved a sigh and thought, &quot;Damn you, Angelique,&quot; and looking down, he considered how ridiculous it was that he could pass as a girl just because some strange, &quot;And possibly crazy,&quot; he thought, woman dressed him in clothes of the opposite sex.<br />
<br />
After a bit, sure that something about the way his chest looked off, &quot;And not because it is pressed outward,&quot; but also because of the way it felt, Mike hesitantly reached his hands up and cupped what he assumed were fake breasts. Feeling his hands pressing into the the bra, which pressed into his chest, he thought, &quot;What the fuck,&quot; and shrugging off the button-up shirt, something tickling his shoulders shortly after he&#39;d done so, he gazed down at the tank top and swell that pushed the top part slightly outward. Thinking it looked way to real, frightened by this, he lay the button-up across his lap and after a moment of hesitation, grasped the hem of the tank top and pulled it up and over his head. Getting it caught in his hair, Mike wondered briefly why his hair was suddenly so long, but then decided that it wasn&#39;t important at the moment as lay the tank top in his lap he turned his attention back to his chest.<br />
<br />
Ensconced in the soft cup of the bra, Mike found he could not deny that his chest was bigger, did in fact push outward and that he could feel the soft fabric cupping the breast. Terrified by what he was seeing and feeling, he thought, &quot;They are only supposed to be inserts. They&#39;re fake,&quot; he began to fumble with the front clasp.<br />
<br />
Sure that once he got it undone that the breast inserts would fall out of the bra and into his lap, Mike nearly screamed when, upon finally getting the bra front undone, his chest stayed exactly where it was. The cups of the bra hanging to the side, his pert swell of his chest sticking out, Mike silently gasped, &quot;Shit. I have tits,&quot; then cast a look at the cubicle door, hoping that his voice hadn&#39;t carried and that he hadn&#39;t been heard.<br />
<br />
No sound from outside the cubicle reached him and off a bit he could hear the normal sounds of the locker room. Releasing the breath he&#39;d been holding, unaware that he had, he slowly grabbed the shirts on his lap, got up off the toilet, squatted down and peered underneath the divide. Seeing no sign of anyone, suddenly away of the soft fabric pressed against his breasts, Mike tittered nervously when he thought how nice, comfortable, the soft fabric felt touching his chest, and sitting back down on the toiler lid, he stared down at his breasts. Trying to come to terms with the fact that he had tits, he suddenly wondered what else he had and standing, he hung the button-up and tank top on the hook on the back of the cubicle door.<br />
<br />
His bra still open, Mike didn&#39;t bother to re-clasp it shut and let it hang open as he reached down and began to fumble with the buttons on the jeans. At first, he couldn&#39;t get his fingers to cooperate and it seemed like he wouldn&#39;t be able to get the pants undone. But then he managed to slip one of the buttons free and from there he was able to get the other four. Pushing down on the pants, he stopped when the panties were fully exposed and staring at them, trying to see even the faintest hint of a bulge, he shoved the pants down a smidge more and then, before he could change his mind, hooked the waist band of the underwear with his thumbs and pulled down on it.<br />
<br />
A light coloured patch of barely-there pubic hair greeted him and for a moment all Mike could do was stare dumbfounded at it. The thought, &quot;That isn&#39;t right. My dick hair should be darker, fuller,&quot; raced through his mind as he sank back to a sitting position and tried to spread his legs.<br />
<br />
The pants and underwear making it kind of difficult to do, he was eventually forced to pushed both of them down to a little past his knees before he could actually get his legs apart. Staring at what was clearly a lack of his normal cock and balls, Mike found he was unable to process what he was seeing until, tentatively, he reached down. His hand brushing against the soft pubic hair that was now growing over his crotch, he slipped the appendage between his legs and using the first two fingers, probed the area. Feeling his fingers first brush up against the tiny nub of his clitoris, then something he could mentally picture, having seen it a number of times in the girly magazines he kept hidden in his closet, and what felt like more wisps of hair. Pulling his hand away, he stared at it, then at his flat crotch and the way his chest pushed out, and thought about the number of naked girls and women he&#39;d seen in the locker room as his mind leapt to what he now thought was the obvious.<br />
<br />
The notion, &quot;Oh, fuck. I&#39;ve been turned into a girl,&quot; flashed through his mind and then he tittered, a sound he thought sounded awfully feminine, and thought, &quot;That&#39;s impossible,&quot; but was unable to fully believe it was impossible, as the proof he had been he could clearly see, feel and hear.<br />
<br />
Alarmed by this, Mike tried to sort out what he should do as he stood, pulled up the underwear and pants, buttoned them, then worked the front clasp on the bra. And as he adjusted his tits so they sat comfortably in the cups, he arrived at the conclusion that the only thing he could do was to go back to the manor, find Angelique and demand she change him back. Reaching for the tank top and button-up shirt, he started to pull them on, but stopped when he suddenly remembered the others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck,&quot; he moaned as he pulled on the last two garments. Stepping out of the cubicle and towards one of the sinks, he peered at his reflection, which he could now see, with the way the shirts hugged his body, the way his chest pushed outward, how his face looked and that he clearly had longer hair, that it was not only a girl&#39;s reflection, but that, if he didn&#39;t know any better, he looked younger. Thinking, &quot;How could I have forgotten Sei, Jonathan, Ryan and Erick,&quot; he silently chastised himself for forgetting about his friends. Figuring they were much more of priority then trying to make Angelique make him a guy again, Mike turned away from the mirror.<br />
<br />
No longer concerned with the fact that he was in the girl&#39;s locker room, he marched across the bathroom section and into the locker room. Looking about, he quickly located the showers, what looked like the exit to the pool or whatever the locker room exited out to, and the entrance to the locker room. Ignoring the naked girls and the women, understanding why the sight of naked women no longer turned him on, Mike hurried across the room and through the entrance. Passing women and girls as he went, all of whom didn&#39;t pay any attention to him, knowing full well now why they didn&#39;t, he barely gave it a glance to where he was once he left the locker room and hurrying outside the building, he confirmed what he thought when he stopped and finally looked at the parking lot outside the local community college annex centre where people went to swim, among other activities.</p>
