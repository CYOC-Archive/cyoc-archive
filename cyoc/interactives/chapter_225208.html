<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Damon was excited.  He was standing in the baby&#39;s section of a department store holding mommy&#39;s hand.  The 30 year old with his adult mind was excited to be able to pick out his own potty chair and training pants.  Ryan had been dropped off at his neighbors house so that only Damon and mommy could shop together.  Clearly, he picked up a package of 2T training pants with cars on them, but the bunny on the front of his diaper was cute and soft looking.  Mommy never did put any pants or shorts on him and so he was still just wearing his diaper and polo shirt.  His puppy shoes were flashing drawing the attention of other shoppers who thought he looked adorable and went on doing their shopping.  He held out the package to mummy and then she placed it in the shopping cart.  &quot;Do you want another package, darling?&quot;, Mummy said.  He shook is head yes and went to grab another package.  However, something caught his eye.  Sitting on the shelf was the cutest training pants he&#39;d ever seen.  The package showed the picture of a cat wearing a red bow.  He saw the training pants the girl on the package was wearing and fell in love with the design.  He checked to make sure it was his size, 2T, and threw it into the cart.  Mommy didn&#39;t question him about it.  It was his moment and she didn&#39;t want to ruin it.  Besides, she knew that sometimes children at this age sometimes explored the opposite gender.  Just to be sure of her suspicions, she picked up some night time training pants with a picture of a princess and snowman.  She then placed it into the cart.  on the other side of the aisle, He saw a red plastic potty with the smiling car he liked, but then he saw a pink potty with the same cat on it.  he smiled as it was a hard choice.  In the end, he pointed out the pink potty and mommy put it in the cart.  If Damon wanted another potty in the future, she&#39;d get it for him since they weren&#39;t too expensive.  On an end cap, she noticed a book called, &quot;It&#39;s Potty Time!&quot;  She&#39;d read it before to one of her patients at her old work place and it had helped that child learn to potty, so she put it in the cart.  Finally, she saw a toddler&#39;s back pack with the same cat on it and put it in the cart.  She walked with her big-boy or.....girl to the self check-outs and paid for her stuff.  After dinner and just before bed, Ryan was already tucked into his for the night, mommy took Damon into his nursery.  She looked around it and wondered if she should paint it pink.  On the floor of Damon&#39;s nursery was the pink potty.  She sat him on his changing table and removed all of his clothes including the slightly moist bunny diaper.  She then set him back on his feet on the floor again.  She asked Damon,&quot;Are you ready to use your kitty potty?&quot;  Damon only nodded his head.  She helped Damon sit down on his potty making sure that his legs went around the urine deflector and that his penis was well inside it.  She then went over to the changing tablet grab the wipes and then sat down next Damon on the potty.  She read him the potty training book and when finished, handed it to him to look at.  Damon gladly took the book.  Even though he had the mind of an adult 30 year old, Madame Illusia had completely taken away his potty knowledge and bladder and bowel control leaving him starting at the bottom.  He quickly read the book again and discovered that all he had to do was sit there.  He&#39;d also learned that he needed to know when to let mommy know when he had to do the pee-pee dance, what ever that was.  He&#39;d never danced the pee-pee dance before.  After 15 more minutes, he heard a strange sound coming from his potty.  He wasn&#39;t sure if he peed in the potty or not, but the poor cat&#39;s face in the bottom of the potty was definitely covered in urine.  Mommy helped him off the potty,  wiped him with a diaper wipe, opened the snow princess training pants, showed them to him, and helped him step into them.  She then pulled them up his legs.  She wanted for him to get used to his training pants and so she simply placed him in his crib for the night, tucked him in and kissed him on the cheek.  She turned on the night light, turned off the overhead light, and grabbed the plastic potty to empty it.  She headed out the door leaving the door slightly ajar.  Tomorrow was a big day.  She had to get Ryan to Pre-K and get Damon settled in at the nursery where she worked at the special education school.  She had a seven-year-old to tend to and had to order an incubator to move her into since she had graduated downward from her youth crib.  She wondered if Damon could be part of the experiment.  The government would pay her a hefty sum if they would accept him.</p>
