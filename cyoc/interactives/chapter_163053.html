<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With a few quick button presses, she transferred the Chronivac out to her main PC, briefly forgetting about her tits as she moved between computers and they clumsily got in her way. As &quot;annoying&quot; as it was, it was admittedly a little fun so Jeff decided to keep the change as-is after she loaded up the Chronivac and remembered that the changes were something she made.<br />
<br />
Thanks to being on her normal PC, it seemed to be able to pick up on natively installed applications. Going back to her primary hobby outside of work, she decided to tie some changes into League of Legends, and hit several categories for this change. First up in the boob category (since it was near the top), every time she got an &quot;assist&quot; point, she was going to lactate. Travelling downwards, she had two changes to make. First, each time her character died was going to make her increasingly horny. Second, every time she got a point for a kill, she&#39;d have a minor orgasm, which wouldn&#39;t relieve the horny buildup from dying. She typed in one more parameter for the end of the game, and decided to toggle &quot;Subject Awareness&quot; > Off for the duration of two matches. Although Jacob had been playing a while, she wasn&#39;t what she would classify as &#39;great&#39; but she wasn&#39;t entirely bad either. She was solid &quot;Gold&quot; rank at best, though she was currently unranked because she didn&#39;t care unless a cosmetic reward she liked was on the line that season. <br />
<br />
She figured she&#39;d eke out a few kills, end up with a wet shirt, but ultimately be unbearably horny by the end of the first match. She hit &#39;Apply&#39; and closed the Chronivac. The perception of the changes to her tits removed from her mind; this was how big they always had been.<br />
<br />
Jacob decided to play one of the longer game modes, one that had a little less concentrated action. Accepting the queue, she had been auto-filled support. Which was less than ideal--she wanted to play Top lane--but she could have plenty of fun as a bottom as well. She settled into her pick--Brand, someone who excelled in blowing -everything- up--and the match began. It was a little slow, there was a bit of back and forth on damage between the two teams, Jacob&#39;s ranged carry teammate was obviously not that great at the game. Even less than Jacob considered herself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, things got spicy.<br />
<br />
At level 4, the enemy team had managed to collapse on his ranged carry, in spite of their best efforts to discourage the enemy. They had piled in a significant amount of damage on both players, but unfortunately her ranged carry hadn&#39;t lasted. However, Jacob saw an opportunity. She&#39;d played plenty of Brand to understand the overlap of her abilities, and the combo needed to trigger the proper outcome. She threw everything she had at them, and they exploded in a shower of fireworks. But she spent her life just before they died. She felt a little heat flush across her belly, then the kills went off. She exploded in a similar shower of fireworks, erratically jolting the mouse to the side as she came twice. But it didn&#39;t break her concentration for some reason. She was feeling a little warm, but more importantly she felt determined. She returned to lane with a few big items. Things seemed to be back to normal, but the enemy jungler tried to gank them. Jacob laser-targeted in and absolutely blew him up, before his adc could even react. Another jolt of pleasure caused her to buckle in her seat as she moved back to a more easily defensible position in the lane.<br />
<br />
The enemy jungler wasn&#39;t keen to repeat the same mistake, nor was she in the mood for &quot;surprises&quot; of that sort. She warded, as her and her teammate pushed in on the enemy. She got them critically low, and her partner finished both of them off. She felt warmth, accompanied by a damp feeling on her chest. ||Damn underboob sweat, my eternal bane|| she thought to herself, as she pulled up each breast and tucked the waist of the tshirt underneath.<br />
<br />
She ended the game 19 kills /5 deaths/6 assists, about 60 cs. She was an absolute mess of sweat, milk, and pussy juice. Her boxers were soaked nearly transparent, and her shirt resembled a wet t-shirt contest. Her nipples--which were pert before--were now significantly poked out, and could likely cut diamonds with their point.<br />
<br />
Before getting up to wash off the &quot;gamer sweat&quot; and maybe cool herself down a little, she took a brief peek at her profile page. It said &quot;Diamond IV&quot; which seemed...right? She remembered all the ranked games she triumphed over, always so intensely focused she&#39;d need a shower between each. Even though her memories said this was right, it was somehow wrong. She shrugged, and trudged herself to the bathroom, fluids clearly dripping down her thighs, unable to be contained any more by the completely sodden boxers.<br />
<br />
She peeled off her clothes, and tossed them directly into the washing machine along with other clothes that had suffered a similar fate. She didn&#39;t question it, she just made her way to the bathroom and turned on the faucet. She was tempted to soak in the bath, but she wanted to get back to playing and didn&#39;t want to take several baths today. A quick shower would have to do. She waited for the water to warm up, and sat on the toilet to relieve herself, pulling her massive ass cheeks apart as she sat so that she&#39;d have minimal cleanup. Manuvering her breasts so she could see better, she looked down at her pussy while pissing. She noticed it was red and engorged--she was definitely horny.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d always gotten this way after playing League for as long as she could remember. She had suspicions that it wasn&#39;t just all &quot;sweat&quot;--it felt too good to play. It was far worse when she was a noob, she had almost no release until after the games. But as she died less, she began to derive pleasure out of triumphing over the enemy team. Even if every game didn&#39;t go her way, at least she enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
That being said, she knew there was only one way to reset herself before her next match, otherwise she&#39;d be so horny she&#39;d be stuck fingering herself into oblivion by the end of the next match. She&#39;d only done that a few times, and she couldn&#39;t remember much afterwards. She just remembered having to replace her bed with how soaked it was after she woke up.<br />
<br />
She grabbed around under her sink until she found the box containing her old friend--a waterproof dildo, with ridges and bumps lining the edges. She got in the shower and laid down on her back, her ass cheeks and breasts barely contained by the edges of the tub. She let the water wash over her, and felt a warm bliss as she became &quot;clean&quot; for the next hour. The water began pooling a bit between her boobs, and it was clear her ass was damming the water from reaching the drain. She shifted a little, and a flood raced to the drain. She sat up a little, legs splayed and her breasts resting on their corresponding leg.<br />
<br />
She grabbed her dildo, and got to work. Or at least tried to. She found she could barely trace the outline of her slit with the dildo! It was way too big! But...wasn&#39;t this her favorite toy? Her memories were a bit muddled. There was absolutely no way she could fit anything like that in any hole, let alone the slit that tight.<br />
<br />
She pulled the box that had contained this monster a little closer, careful not to splash too much water on the floor. Rooting around, she found something much, MUCH smaller. Almost comically smaller. But why was the big one there in the first place? She dried it off, then set it back into the box. Unbeknownst to her, it began to shrink once it was out of sight, becoming something much more &quot;fitting&quot; to her current tension. One of the changes Jacob had implemented had been tied into creep score. &quot;If creep score > 50, reduce sexual prowess to minimum+1&quot; According to the description, this governed number of previous partners, toy usage, sexual understanding and other similar parameters. Jacob just hadn&#39;t wanted to &quot;pop the cherry&quot; so she left the virginity (+1) turned off.<br />
<br />
But Jacob didn&#39;t realize this, and was instead trying to figure out what to do with this dildo. Surely she had used it before. Her slit was horny and oozing, but she couldn&#39;t put two and two together for some reason. It looked like an every day object to her, or something a kid would play with.<br />
<br />
She fished around for her phone outside of the tub. Luckily it was water proof so she could use it inside of the shower. She tried a few search terms, but couldn&#39;t quite put her finger on what to look up. She searched &quot;Men and women&quot; and got a bunch of generic results. She searched &quot;Naked woman&quot; and got a few anatomical results, before realizing her safe search was on. Turning it off gave a few more examples of nude women, but nothing she could go off of. ||I was a man before the Chronivac, wasn&#39;t I? What would I have done with a woman again??|| she tried to think back. She remembered having a rod resembling the dildo; but attached to her body. But Jacob hadn&#39;t seen much action as a man, mostly porn.<br />
<br />
||That&#39;s it! *porn!*|| she finally remembered the term. As if she hadn&#39;t heard it in twenty years. She did a generic search for &quot;porn&quot; and ended up on one of the most well-known porn sites on the internet. Most of the titles of the videos grossed her out, indicating incest all over the place. Most of the thubnails sucked, she couldn&#39;t see what the women were doing with the man&#39;s meat.<br />
<br />
On a whim, she decided to click a video of a girl with pink hair and boobs that were almost as big as her own. She seemed to be a gamer as well, and was giving a &quot;live show&quot; to her audience, teasing them and after a certain point taking off one piece of clothing at  a time. Someone then paid her $500 to take off her pants and point the camera at her pussy. Jacob was flabberghasted. She couldn&#39;t believe someone would pay $500 for something like that!<br />
<br />
As the video went on, she got more requests for her to play with her tits, and Jacob wasn&#39;t even going to try to hide it--she began pretending *she* was the camgirl, responding to each donation and treating the bath faucet as the webcam. Then the request came in from one of her long-time subscribers. &quot;Do it for us.&quot; to which the woman in the video nodded, pinched her nipple (Jacob did as well, and felt a little spurt of sticky milk between her fingers before it got washed away in the shower). Pink haired pulled out a dildo resembling the first one Jacob had fished out, and began working her pussy. Before even inserting it, she spit in her hand and lubed it up. She then rubbed it along her frothing slit, before plunging it in. Over and over again. Jacob felt hotter, as she reached for her much smaller toy and mimicked her motions. Her volcano was already spilling out; this only increased the flow.<br />
<br />
Then--just as pinky did, she plunged it in. Her world turned starry, as she couldn&#39;t control the speed or force that she fucked herself with. She rode wave after wave of pleasure, and wasn&#39;t in the state of mind to notice her nipples were also giving a 10-gun salute of their own juices.</p>
