<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, I got an idea, let&#39;s go shopping.&quot;  Joey grinned.<br />
<br />
Melissa blinked.  &quot;Huh?  Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To get you some clothes for your new sizes, obviously.  Like, stuff for what you want your normal height to be, then we can pick some out that you can wear at an even smaller size.  In case you want to go outdoors like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, couldn&#39;t you just change my clothes to fit me?  Or just make new ones?&quot;  Melissa eyed him, dubious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure but one, it gives us something to do, and two, you can try out different outfits...uh...for me?&quot;  He trailed off, lamely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, now I get it.  You want to play dress-up with your new dolly, huh, Wish boy?&quot;  She grinned at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t have put it that way, but yeah?  I mean, only if you want to.&quot;  He felt his cheeks get warm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, stop blushing, cutie, I&#39;m just jerking your chain.  I&#39;d love to dress up for you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;You would?  You will?  That&#39;s great.  Where&#39;s a good place to shop?  I mean, I&#39;m a guy, I don&#39;t know jack about women&#39;s clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.  &quot;Well, for now, we&#39;ll avoid the places I usually go to and get more, ah, normal clothing.  I know you like my goth look, but if money&#39;s no object, we can try out other stuff.  Even...gah...cute girly outfits.  I can&#39;t believe I said that out loud!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I mention you&#39;re the best?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And don&#39;t you forget it.  Ok, so, what do you think about a trip to New York?  I&#39;ve always wanted to shop on Fifth Avenue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;New York?  Uh, so I&#39;ll have to wish us there.  Well that&#39;s ok, I was going to wish for some money too.&quot;  Joey thought about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do have a condition.  You have to let me buy some stuff for you, too.  I can&#39;t have my boyfriend looking like a shabby geek.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey pretended to be offended.  &quot;But I am a shabby geek!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but I kind of want to show you off a little, because underneath that geeky outfit is a really cute guy.  Perverted as hell, but cute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm-hm, you could say that about yourself, you know.&quot;  He gave her the side-eye.<br />
<br />
She giggled.  &quot;Yes, but I own that shit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine.  Ok, so...we&#39;re going to be transported to a suite in a luxury hotel, within walking distance of the Fifth Avenue shopping district.  Our rooms are paid for indefinitely, we&#39;re booked as Mr. and Mrs. Claremont.  I have an unlimited line of credit, and a briefcase full of money in the wall safe.  The staff will believe we&#39;ve been there for days, and nobody there will notice any changes I make to you.  We also have the unlimited use of a Rolls Royce Silver Ghost, vintage condition, but with modern conveniences, at any hour, with our own personal chaffeur.&quot;  He paused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should the chaffeur be like?  Guy, girl?&quot;  Joey looked at his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty in-depth there, Wish boy.  My smarts are rubbing off on you.  Let&#39;s see, I want some eye candy.  So, female, young, very pretty, but she wears a man&#39;s uniform, classic, cap and everything.  She&#39;s tall and slender, but can handle herself in any fight.  She&#39;s also our bodyguard.  Thinking ex-military...oh, how about an Israeli chick, like, I dunno, a younger and cuter Gal Gadot, and a total badass.  Cheerful girl, smart, quick witted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sure, you say my wishes are detailed.  Ok, sure thing.  Her name is going to be Eleora Ben-Asher, she&#39;s 26 but looks younger, she spent 2 years and 8 months in the Israeli Defense Forces.  She&#39;s trained as a sniper, and has a high degree of proficiency in Krav Maga.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;What is she going to think about our, uh, shenanigans?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa laughed.  &quot;Shenanigans, nicely put.  Uh, I don&#39;t want competition, so she&#39;s a lesbian, so her relation with God and her family is...complicated.  You don&#39;t mind if I fool around with her, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joey felt himself growing firm.  &quot;Uh...no.  That&#39;s actually kind of hot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a peach, Joseph.  Ok, she&#39;ll be smart enough to know you can do things normal people can&#39;t, you know, in case of emergencies, but she&#39;s a total professional, she&#39;s not going to comment on anything that isn&#39;t flagrant, and she won&#39;t make a big deal out of transformations.  She&#39;s paid extremely well...I think we&#39;re going to keep her.  She has a secret fetish for being transformed, just in case you decide to have some fun.  Age, size, um, some body modification, and, oh you brought it up before...she&#39;s really intrigued by liminal forms.  Y&#39;know, centaurs, sphinxes, that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.  So half animal, half-human?  I was joking, but ok, that all sounds fine.  So sex is on the table for you both, but your relationship will be...intimate friends?  Casual lovers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded.  &quot;Make it so, Cap&#39;n.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You call me a nerd, jeez.  Ok!&quot;<br />
<br />
In a flash, they found themselves standing in a luxury suite with a great view of Fifth Avenue.  They were dressed in fine quality, but nondescript clothing.  Standing by the door, leaned against the wall, was a tall Israeli woman, dressed as a chauffer.  She had short dark hair, dyed blonde at the tips.  She was very lean, with striking features that made her look quite tough (especially her cold, dark eyes) but upon seeing the two, she smiled, which made her look like a teenager, and her eyes seemed to have a cheerful glint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, Miss, welcome back.  Will you still be needing the car for your shopping trip?&quot;  Eleora nonchalantly asked, completely oblivious to the fact she didn&#39;t exist moments before.<br />
<br />
Melissa recovered first.  &quot;Yes, we will, Eleor...can I call you Elly?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly&#39;s smile managed to become brighter, if that was possible.  &quot;You certainly may, Miss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa grinned.  &quot;Great.  Yes, get the car ready, Elly, we&#39;ll be down in say, twenty minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elly tipped her cap with a wink, and walked out, her footsteps as silent as a cat&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.  I just realized.  I made a person.&quot;  Joey seemed slightly in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did!  And you did a great job, too!  How does it feel, being all Godly?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little scary.  And speaking of little, we need to decide on a height for you.&quot;  He looked down at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!  I forgot I was a Halfling.  Not a word about me being a geek.  Uh...well you&#39;re six feet tall, right?  Let&#39;s start with...ugh, any number I think of, I want to make smaller.&quot;  Melissa frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about we start with, say, 5&#39; 4&quot;, you said you liked me being able to rest my chin on your head.  So that&#39;s short, but reasonably short.  We can decide on a &quot;lap size&quot; later.  We won&#39;t need any fun-sized clothes unless you were serious about me making you into a kid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was serious about that, actually, I think I want to try it.  Then I could buy ridiculously cute clothes and not feel bad about it.&quot;  She grinned up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You little wench, you secretly want to be a goth loli!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that too, but also the girly stuff I&#39;d hate to wear normally.  Like say, Catholic schoolgirl outfits, with bobby socks?&quot;  Her smile turned wicked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man...&quot; Joey gulped.  &quot;Yes, definitely.  So what, 8 or 9 years old?&quot;<br />
<br />
She thought about it.  &quot;9&#39;s good.  Keep some hints of future sexiness, you know, little buds for breasts, slightly wider hips, just to keep you excited.  Just above 4&#39; tall.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I change you now, or...?&quot;  Joey felt like he was having a hard time breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only when we start shopping for that stuff.  5&#39; 4&quot; is good for now, and um, how about 4&#39; 9&quot; for lap sized?  Tinier than that is for private, so I won&#39;t need much clothes, now will I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;N-no, I guess not.  I mean, you&#39;d look hot in doll clothes, but you probably wouldn&#39;t be wearing them much.  Uh, did I say that out loud?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa laughed.  &quot;You did!  And I love the idea.&quot;  She gasped then, as she grew in height, becoming a 5&#39; 4&quot; young woman.  Her clothing changed with her.  &quot;Man, this is still way shorter than I used to be.  I like it, but I kind of want to be a tiny bit shorter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might have to revise lap-sized then, ok, how about this?&quot;  Joey made her dwindle to 5&#39; 2&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...darn, I was hoping for 5-foot nothing!&quot;  She laughed.  &quot;No this is good.  I need a size that I won&#39;t be mistaken for a kid, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;  He gazed at her hungrily.<br />
<br />
She held up a finger.  &quot;Shopping first, fun later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Missy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She glared at him until he flinched, then her eyes softened.  &quot;Sorry, I never liked being called that.  But you can get away with it...two conditions.  In private, or when I&#39;m in little girl mode.  Any other time, and you have to let me punish you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...deal.  Missy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t push it, Joseph.&quot;  She took him by the hand and led him out of the room.</p>
