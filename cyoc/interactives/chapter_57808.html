<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the Leoman cascade continued, many things changed to fit new race that was rapidly gaining numbers in Glendale. Much of this would probably make Gillie's tail tie itself in knots but there was nothing anyone could really do about it. And not all of it was necessarily bad. And this is where Glendale's mayor fit in. In the previous reality, he was married to a Brenda Hune. He had met her in college and through charm and hard work, convinced her to marry him and come back to Glendale with him. They had a little girl, Sandi.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, in the previous reality, Glendale's mayor had one MASSIVE weakness. And that was other women. Shortly after being elected mayor, he made a lot of effort to personally do many of the interviews for staff positions. He had settled on a Brandi Robbins for his secretary. She was a very beautiful woman, much like his wife, but unlike his wife shared his passion for politics, and civic duty. She commonly came home with him just to get last minute notices, invoices, and faxes to be sent done, and Glendale's mayor came to love her for that. The relations, however, ended up in Brandi becoming pregnant and bearing a son, Aaron. Fearful that the mistake would lead to a divorce, the Mayor urged her to keep silent about who Aaron's father was, but promised to make sure that he would not want for anything.<br />
<br />
And then there was Maria Lopez. A extremely beautiful Hispanic woman (whose family had legally immigrated in 1900) that seemed extremely attracted to him after trying to play &quot;wingman&quot; for one of his single friends at one of Glendale's bars. He tried to pass her on to his friend, but she seemed more attracted to him. He tried to tell her that he was married but that didn't slow her down. Eventually, after she &quot;bumped into&quot; him at the library, he set her down in a quiet corner and asked why she was doing what she was doing. She then explained that she had left an abusive ex-lover and needed work. She hoped the Mayor could give her a job if she was friendly with him... and admitted that she did find him cute. The Mayor didn't have any positions for her to fill at the time, but agreed to help her find work. When nothing appeared to open up, he relented and offered her a position as a cleaning lady in his home. It wasn't a large mansion the way Wolf Manor was... or as Smith Manor was in the previous reality, but it was still larger then the average home. She accepted and soon became a regular figure in the Hune household, despite Brenda's assertions that she could do the job herself. And again, Maria's presence lead to the Mayor committing adultery... again and by chance conceiving another daughter, whom Maria named Catherine. Again the Mayor urged Maria to keep the father of the girl a mystery, because he did love his wife, and did not want to lose her.<br />
<br />
Brenda Hune had always suspected her husband's infidelity to her, but could never prove it, and with her own work, she couldn't supervise him all the time. And she did love him as well. She didn't want to divorce him, but she if she ever found proof, she would keep him in her &quot;dog house&quot; for a long time, and the other women would be thrown out...<br />
<br />
But in the new reality as the Leoman cascade began to reach them, things would obviously change.<br />

At the end of the school day that he learned Trevor was alive and with Pride again, Aaron came out of school to find his mother's car waiting for him in the parking lot. He waved to Trevor, and trotted over to the car and got into the back seat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, mom!&quot; Aaron said cheerfully to his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Aaron, and how is my little lion today?&quot; Brandi answered as the vehicle seemed to enlarge, although unknown to her. At the same time, her clothing vanished and faded yellow fur began to grow on her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm great, mom... guess what?!&quot; Aaron replied to her, as his mother's muscle mass began to enlarge and retractable claws grew from her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Brandi asked back as her eyesight improved tremendously and her feet lengthened so that she would be in a digitigrade stance when she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor's back!&quot; Aaron cheered, &quot;He's alive! Alive! Trevor's alive!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor? Trevor Tyson?&quot; Brandi asked as faded yellow tail, tipped with yellowish orange fur grew behind her, though she kept it limp so it didn't bother her while driving, &quot;Jacob and Marie must be so happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd think they are,&quot; Aaron answered, while his mother's ears moved to the top of her head, and a leonine muzzle pushed out, all of it painless, &quot;are you done for the day? Or do you have to go back to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm done for today,&quot; Brandi smiled, &quot;so I figured I'd have a little fun with my cub.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next morning, after entrusting Aaron to a neighbor to take to school (the neighbor was also already a member of the Pride), Brandi made her way into work. City Hall was always a rather busy place with many people going in and out, and Brandi's lioness ears always managed to pick up on either gossip or serious conversation. Most of it related to how the town tried to keep the Game under wraps. She gave the statue of Joella Cruz a pacing glance as she went in and hurried on her way.<br />
<br />
Once inside she made her way to her desk and chair which was larger then before, in order to allow the lioness to use it... or because it had always been that size. Brandi didn't notice. She merely sat down and found a couple of letters the Mayor had that he wanted typed up. She immediately set to work.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Brandi,&quot; a voice said to her politely and in a very friendly manner.<br />
<br />
She looked up to see that the Mayor had arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, Joseph,&quot; she answered back in an equally friendly manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good night?&quot; Joseph Hune, the Mayor of Glendale asked as his clothing vanished and light tan fur began to grow over him, a sheath rapidly forming around his member.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a good a night as I could have without you,&quot; Brandi answered, as the mayor grew retractable claws and began to get taller as his feet lengthened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that Brenda will always be my Prime Mate,&quot; Joseph answered as his ears moved to the top of his head and his brown hair began to lengthen and circle around his head neck and upper chest, which was also gaining a lot of muscle mass, &quot;I love her first and foremost.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Brandi sighed, &quot;but I still love you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you too,&quot; Joseph answered, like any Leoman male would, &quot;but Brenda is my Prime Mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nuzzled his newly grown muzzle to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Brandi sighed, &quot;I've just gotten started on these letters you wanted typed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good,&quot; Joseph answered, &quot;bring them in and I'll look them over when your done. Then we can decide on where to go for lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joseph then continued on and Brandi continued with her work. She was only stopped a very loud OUCH echoed through City Hall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your tail, sir,&quot; Brandi gave a have snicker as Joseph opened the door that had closed on the appendage.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
And in that, Joseph Hune had joined the Pride fairly quickly and easily. Though the web that he had woven in the previous reality had not yet been completely touched by the Leoman cascade, but that was coming quickly as well.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Joseph made his way home later that evening. He had asked Brandi if she and Aaron wanted to join them for dinner, but she had politely declined, saying she didn't want to aggravate Brenda. He had sighed and let her go her own way. It would, after all, be uncivilized to force her to do anything she didn't want to. He came in to find Sandi and Catherine seated together watching television. Since he and insured that both went to a private school, they had not yet been touched by the Leoman cascade that Trevor and Sabrina had taken into Glendale's public school, but Joseph didn't know that the two of them would soon carry it there themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, girls,&quot; Joseph said politely to them as he came up behind the couch they were seated on, &quot;what are you watching?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls turned, saw his maned head close to them and gave one loud cheer.<br />
<br />
&quot;DADDY!&quot; both cheered and leaped into his arms, forgetting all about the television. Again their clothing vanished, other then a red ribbon that Sandi wore with a large bow in the back. Light tan fur covered Sandi while Catherine became covered in blackish-brown fur. &quot;MOMMY, DADDY'S HOME!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sandi there is no need to yell,&quot; Brenda answered as she came around a corner, and having interacted with her transforming daughter, began to transform as well. Her clothing vanished and bronze/brass/beige colored fur began to cover her.<br />
<br />
Joseph set Sandi and Catherine down as their little bodies gained more muscle mass, which would be very evident when the grew up. They hugged his leg while he moved toward Brenda.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello dear,&quot; Joseph gave a slight smile and hugged Brenda, as her own claws grew and pulled inside protective sheaths. His daughters' tails sprouted behind them and twitched slowly as they continued to hug their father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Brandi and Aaron?&quot; Brenda asked as her body enlarged and she began to grow to the height of a Leoman lioness, &quot;I thought the whole family would be here for dinner tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She said something about not wanting to make you mad,&quot; Joseph said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I be mad?&quot; Brenda asked as her tail blossomed out from the end of her spine, tipped with brown fur, &quot;it was my idea for her to come to you when she was in heat before Aaron was born. And she knows that we are Prime Mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I tried to explain that,&quot; Joseph answered as he rubbed his muzzle to Brenda's newly grown one, &quot;maybe she's met someone that she is courting to be her Prime Mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda nuzzled him back, &quot;If she has, I hope she's happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
And at that point, Joseph felt Catherine leap from the back of the couch to clutch onto his shoulders. Her little claws stung him a little as she climbed up there, but he withstood it. Brenda giggled at the cub's antics.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, mommy, daddy's home,&quot; Catherine said toward a nearby flight of stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see that young cub,&quot; came Maria's voice as she descended the stairs carrying a load of laundry, her clothing vanishing and dark blackish-brown fur covered her, &quot;I am just taking some old linens from the guest room down to the laundry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no need for that, Maria,&quot; Brenda commented, as Maria began to gain additional muscle mass and grow in height, &quot;I could have done that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You and Joseph hired me to help manage the house, Brenda,&quot; Maria answered, as her tail grew out behind her, &quot;and that is what I will do.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Maria got closer, Brenda pulled away from Joseph and the hugged the transforming lioness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but we're all a family,&quot; Brenda answered, as Maria's ears rounded and her muzzle pushed out, &quot;it would be unfair and uncivilized to make you do everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Brenda,&quot; Maria nuzzled the Mayor's Prime Mate back, &quot;but I can manage one basket. There is plenty of other things that need doing that I know that you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brenda only smiled as there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll get it,&quot; Joseph answered and walked to the door, with Catherine still riding on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
He got there to find that it was Brandi with Aaron standing beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brandi!!&quot; Joseph gasped, &quot;I thought you said you weren't coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had...&quot; Brandi said slowly, &quot;but Aaron wanted to tell his half sisters about Trevor being back. So how could I say &quot;no&quot; to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Trevor?&quot; Catherine asked from Joseph's shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabby-Lion?&quot; Sandi asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, Sandi...&quot; Brenda began.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Mom, he looks like a tabby-lion... soooooo cute!&quot; Sandi answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Trevor is back!&quot; Aaron smiled as he looked up to his father, and one of his half sisters.<br />
<br />
Brenda meanwhile, came forward and hugged Brandi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come in, come in,&quot; Brenda said in a very friendly voice to the female that she shared her mate with, &quot;it will be wonderful to have the family all together for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Brenda,&quot; Brandi smiled and lead her son in.<br />
<br />

<br />
Returning to the present time, Serenity looked up at the building that functioned as &quot;City Hall&quot;. Like Wolf Manor, it was a very imposing and large structure, but there was the sort of appearance that the building itself was a veritable fortress in its construction alone, while Wolf Manor was protected by the Lupmen that lived there.<br />
<br />
After a few moments of waiting, the copper lioness she was waiting for arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Gill...ie,&quot; Serenity said politely, getting used to the name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Gillie answered, &quot;Do you have everything you want to say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what I want to say, if that's what you mean,&quot; Serenity answered, &quot;will they expect us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I called the mayor's secretary this morning to make the appointment, and got a very friendly reception on the phone,&quot; Gillie answered, &quot;but I think we are expected...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe she's since joined the Pride,&quot; Serenity commented, &quot;just about everyone in the Pride seems to know everyone else in the Pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Crazy communality,&quot; Gillie sighed, &quot;let's get this over with.&quot;</p>
