<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There, a Ewe is her zodiac sign, and how befitting I might add, especially since her first name is Mary!&quot; Peter exclaimed to the shopkeeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, your beloved should appreciate this gift in ways that both she and you shall gain new passions for togetherness.&quot; The man said to Peter. He knowing his congratulating came with a host of unsaid changes to their bodies, and how they would relate to each other, as to their relatives.<br />
<br />
Peter paid the man and left the shop feeling happy.  He drove straight to where Mary resided, as at her parents home. He wanted to give her the special gift that very day.<br />
<br />
Knocking at the front door with a sense of urgency, Mary came to answer his knocking, as he then offered to her a small box as his present to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Peter, what is this...,&quot; Mary said, as she opened the small box, and looking inside she smiled as if recognized the ring, the zodiac insignia of a Ewe sheep, her birth month.  Peter knew she absolutely loved it, so after she slipped it onto her right hand and finger, the ring offered her good reasons for having a full body shiver. &quot;Oh Peter, my ring just gave me such a new sensed thrill, you come in, my parents are away, we can cuddle, make plans to wed, and if you like, we can see if you fit inside of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter entered the house, taking Mary by her hand and as they made plans to marry, he led her to her bedroom where they could cuddle ad do more.<br />
<br />
Although Mary was thinking of their wedding day, for some odd reason all sense of religious and moral teaching seemed obscure. Their plans were easily made and not fifteen minutes later, Peter laid atop her, they on her bed, and she beckoning of Pete to delve ever deeper, as he did she &quot;Baaed&quot; instead of moaned.<br />
<br />
Two in love then frolicked passionately for three hours. As Peter felt at and messaged her mound and clit, he noticed her genital hair as seemingly there, where he remembered it as shaved when they had begun to making love. As they rolled about fondling, she came to sit straddling his lap, his penis rigid, was inside her, as she swooned, baaing, the white colored curly hairs about her groin were growing denser, with the feel of wool.<br />
<br />
She was in a state of sexual euphoria and grabbed at Peters balls, she messaging them with one hand, and without thinking, started pleading with her lover to give her many lambs...!<br />
<br />
&quot;Lambs,&quot; Peter asked, as he thought of the ring, but never had his Mary made such silly mentions of their future or him, as if they were sheep?<br />
<br />
Later, that evening, after the parents had returned home and found their daughter as elated, talking of marriage, they knew something drastic had changed. As indeed, Mary was changing, filled with a euphoria brought on her from Peter and their mating. As beginning that evening, as progressing through the night, Mary experienced a personal itchy feeling in her groin.<br />
<br />
The next morning when Mary awoke, she felt something strange, as what she had bought some years ago, an item to ease her horny feelings of wanting to making passionate love with a real man. What she discovered was from her restless night, during her sweats and remembered heaves, she had found that dildo and inserted it where Peter had gone to help stimulate their relationship.<br />
<br />
The dildo was still vibrating when she began removing it from her vagina. It happened then that she took note to the excessive re-growth of her mounding, as white curly dense fur. She knew the growing body fur was wrong, but the more she touched it, the more she wanted the dildo inserted deep, and vibrating her into a sense of sexual madness.<br />
<br />
The  dildo seemed to gain back its changed state, stimulating Mary as it never had, or she never recalled.<br />
<br />
Moaning, baaing occasionally, she ignored her reason for sounding off like a ewe mating. As the dildo kept her feeling more and more yet elated, the woolly fur began to grow as spread. Mary lost consciousness, she fainted from the vaginal stimulation, did not stop the dildo from it exciting the spell, the ring, and how Mary was to change species.<br />
<br />
When she awoke, she was lying on her bed naked, or without her bed clothes. As she moved and removed then the dildo, she&#39;d realized her body as having changed for the more sensual arousing of her need for sex. She saw her pelvic regions as grown covered by white wool. Mary combed her fingers through the dense curls of her wool. As she felt about her groin and buttocks, she discovered a new tail was now hers to feel. As finding she had grown a short tail did elate her for wanting as wishing she could become more as a ewe and less a person. Giggling, as baaing, she thought her ewe like changes made her look cute.<br />
<br />
Mary made plans to have Peter there for dinner that night, as her parents were leaving again, this trip taking three days and two nights; time enough for her to coax Peter back to her bed.<br />
<br />
A dinner of lusty desires held in check, or until he was fed and she came at him, acting as alluring, aroused sexually, having a need for her cunt being filled.</p>
