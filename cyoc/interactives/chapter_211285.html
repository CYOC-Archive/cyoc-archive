<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg reluctantly agreed to going to slay the slimes. He didn&#39;t particularly like quests like this, but if Jeff had helped Finn make something like this, then it might be better just to go along to get along. Plus, there was some gold per slime core they were able to return and that might help them in the long run as it didn&#39;t feel like they were going to be leaving this game world anytime soon. <br />
<br />
The three went out into a large overgrown field. The grass and flowers blew in the wind. A crooked tree graced what looked like a lower cut area that had been used for grazing. Based off the adventure poster, slimes had attacked a couple of cattle and needed to be taken care of. Most higher level adventurers didn&#39;t care about quests like this, so it was always easier to get the low level ones to take care of it. They carefully crept closer, using a boulder for cover. <br />
<br />
&quot;I think they&#39;re right over there,&quot; Greg whispered. However, it was only to Jeff as Charlie seemed to have disappeared. Being a rogue, he had impressive sneaking abilities. He just didn&#39;t think he&#39;d be using them yet.<br />
<br />
Jeff licked his chops excitedly. &quot;Indeed,&quot; he smiled as he looked over the small group of slimes. There looked to be about 5 of them in a group happily jumping around without a care in the world. <br />
<br />
Greg felt a grumpy grunt roll out of him as he saw the wide-eyed look of the bear. Jeff was actively touching himself above his robes. &#39;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&#39; he thought as he looked back over into the small field. His eyes caught the grass not moving quite right. &#39;There&#39;s Charlie. Going in for a sneak attack.&#39; He smiled as he saw the wolf&#39;s snout peak out of the edge of the grass and then jump into battle, stabbing the small green slime. It popped.<br />
<br />
Little bits of slime splattered around and all that was left was a small green orb. However, all the other slimes instantly sensed the threat and readied themselves for action. &quot;No time like the present,&quot; Greg shouted as he leapt onto the rock and let out a roar. The slimes froze as he took out his dueling great axes. He jumped down slashing down two more. Several more appeared out of the tall grass. &quot;Oh shit! Jeff?&quot; Greg called out.<br />
<br />
All he heard was an over satisfied. &quot;Oh yes!&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg and Charlie shared &#39;What the fuck?&#39; faces. However, that also gave the slimes ample time to set themselves up with advantage against their much larger opponents. The two quickly realized that they could goof off. Turn order was in real time. If they spent too much time elsewhere, they were going to pay for that.<br />
<br />
The slime jumped up towards Greg. &quot;What the--!?&quot; Greg shouted, but to his surprise he was instantly grappled. The small slime creature instantly attached itself to his cock and balls and gave it a nice little tug. He let out a moan and fell prone to the sudden semisolid jelly gently stroking his cock. &quot;Oh fuck..!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ARR YOU OKAY!?&quot; Charlie shouted. He was still busy fighting his own. The wolf was a bit better at avoiding the creatures and focusing more on dex than strength gave him a pretty good chance of avoiding their jumps all together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Yeah...&quot; Greg didn&#39;t mean to make it a moan, but it couldn&#39;t come out any other way as his cock was still stroked. And then the amount of flesh it was touching had to be near twice as much as he was used to. He felt blood engorge his cock, filling it into what had to be at least a 10 inch log. Just feeling that small blob engulf his cock and gently suckle on it, made him roll over. With his ass high in the air a second slime took their chance at entry.<br />
<br />
&quot;EEP!&quot; he yelped as the slime failed its intrusion. Luckily, they could only fit in spaces 1 inch or bigger, but the way that slimed pressed, it might have had a pretty good shot. Greg rolled himself on his back. &quot;Fuck!&quot; he groaned as the slime continued to pleasure him. It felt too good. Somehow it knew all the right places to touch him in what order to send the best feelings possible. He felt his balls churn as it continued. But he needed a counterattack. No way was he going to use the great axe, so he pulled out his claws and dug them into the slime. It softened and lost any of its elasticity before falling to the ground and disappearing into a small ball. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh fuck yeah...&quot; Greg moaned as he fell onto his back. The sexual buzz was still making it hard for him to think and he completely forgot about the second slime that was currently heading right for his asshole. It charged in. &quot;YEEP!&quot; he yelped again as the creature actually made it inside this time. His face burned red as his cock throbbed with excitement at the intruder rummaging around in his anus. He could feel the semisolid liquid squirming inside him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope! Nope! Nope!&quot; Greg&#39;s voice raised a few octaves as he slammed his claws into the creature and tried to pull it out. Any essence of solid that it had disappeared with a pop inside him. &quot;EEP!&quot; he felt the sudden goo liquify and start leaking out of him. He looked around to see Charlie dispense of the last one and then laid back onto the ground. His cock still hard as a rock, shifting the loin cloth he was wearing to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone had fun,&quot; Charlie smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up...&quot; Greg couldn&#39;t look the other man in the eyes as he tried to press down his boner, but the loin cloth did nothing to cover up his embarrassment. &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it...&quot; He paused before asking. &quot;Where&#39;s Jeff?&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlie shrugged then jumped back behind the rock. The large bear was happily laying back as one of the green slimes continued to suck him off. His body shook and balls released into the creature filling it with his fluid. With that, it jumped off his dick and into the grass. Its green color shifted to red as Jeff&#39;s cream churned inside of it. Charlie tried to attack it, but there was a crack in the ground, and it was able to get away.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell man!?&quot; Charlie shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Jeff looked over his rotund belly, scratching it lightly. &quot;Why&#39;d you think I wanted to fight slimes?&quot; he yawned and laid back onto the ground. &quot;Such a good mob...&quot; And gently started snoring.</p>
