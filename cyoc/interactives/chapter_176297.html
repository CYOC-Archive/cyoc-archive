<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex carried on eating his breakfast as he weighed his options, eyeing the little stack of copper coins standing by his plate. These seemed like good people, and there was certainly plenty of work to be done around the farm even with his help. It wasn’t exhausting work, or at least now it wasn’t due to his enhanced muscles. And getting fucked by Bo every night would be a reward in and of itself. It was enticing, but he was eager to move on and see more of this new world, despite his meager funds. <br />
“I appreciate the offer sir, but I best be moving on to Dicktin. I’ve still got a long way to go.” Said Alex. He looked over at Bo, who nodded casually before tucking back into his breakfast.<br />
“Are you sure honey?” asked Kirk. His voice was deep like his husband, but somehow softer in tone. “Do you have kin out there in the city?” <br />
“Um, not exactly. But Raf and Roc told me they had a friend who lived in the city whom I should meet.” Alex set his fork down on his empty plate and leaned back in his chair. <br />
“They didn’t mention a name?” inquired Rick.<br />
“Nope. Just ‘a friend’.”<br />
“I can’t imagine werewolves having a lot of friends in the city, even those two,” mused Kirk. “Maybe they were talking about the wizard.” He said the word casually, like one would say “accountant” or “landscaper”.<br />
Alex stifled a snicker. Of course, there was a wizard.<br />
“There’s a wizard in the city of Dicktin? Is it an emerald city?” he said in a sarcastic tone. A tone apparently lost on the rest of the table, along with the reference.<br />
“Don’t be silly son,” laughed Rick, looking at Alex like he was a wild-eyed tourist <br />
“Do you know what a city made of emerald would cost?” Bo guffawed, giving Alex a playful shove that nearly sent him off his seat.<br />
“Besides, he certainly doesn’t run the city.” Rick finished his glass of milk before continuing. “He a kind old bear; he has a magical practice in the city.”<br />
“His name is Pascal; he used to be a doula for a time,” chimed in Kirk. “Travelling around the country-side using his magic to help families deliver their sons. He was there to deliver Van, my love.” Kirk leaned over and gave his husband a brief but passionate kiss.<br />
“Yes, my love,” Rick growled. “Maybe in time we’ll be in need of his services again…” he said, biting Kirk’s neck and eliciting a giggling yelp from the leaner man. Rick’s large hand reached for his husband’s ass and gave it a hard squeeze. <br />
“Aw, Paw, not at the table,” Bo winced and averted his gaze. Looks like even in this world watching their parents make out at the breakfast table was the last thing any kid wanted to see. Alex just thought it was cute, and laughed at Bo’s obvious discomfort. Van took advantage of his fathers’ lapse in attention and peeled away from the breakfast table without a word.<br />
Rick and Kirk kissed for a few seconds longer before Kirk broke away, blushing and muttering something about having to clear the table. Rick gave him a parting slap on the rear as Kirk leaned over to grab his plate. Bo and Alex handed their plates to the man; Alex picked up the stack of coppers and stuffed them in the small pocket of his shorts. <br />
“Well, Alex,” began Rick, standing up from the table. “It has been a pleasure meeting you. But we’ve got a busy day ahead of us all and I say its about time we get started.” Rick came around the table to pull Alex into a bone-crushing hug. Alex tried could feel that the immense man was still excited from his husband’s earlier attentions. Guess Bo takes after this father, Alex thought. Rick let him go and stood back from the comparatively smaller man. “Safe travels, and thank you for showing my young man here a good time.” He gave Alex a wink and then turned and stepped out the back door.<br />
“You have a sweet family,” Alex began, but before he knew it Bo pulled him into his strong arms and planted a deep and heavy kiss on the smaller man’s lips. Gods, Alex thought, Bo’s face was rugged and scratchy but his lips were so soft. Alex wrapped his arms around Bo’s strong back while Bo reached down to caress Alex’s ass, still sore from Bo’s thorough fucking the night before. <br />
“Yeah, and I thought they would never leave. I have to give you a proper good-bye.” He said, and suddenly Alex realized that Kirk had made a tactful departure as well.  Bo gave Alex a few kisses on the lips before slowly kissing lower and lower, down Alex’s newly hairy and developed chest, down his to abs before resting at his navel. Bo continued to kiss and bite at his skin while his hands worked at undoing Alex’s belt and pulling down his shorts. Alex gasped as Bo took the tip of his manhood into his mouth, massaging Alex’s larger balls with his free hand. Bo worked Alex’s cock deeper and deeper into his mouth, until Alex felt the scruff of Bo’s hairy face on the base of his dick. They both moaned as Bo expertly worked Alex’s shaft and swelling balls. But then once again he felt that tingling sensation as the last bits of energy left over from Roc’s blessing worked their way out of his system. <br />
Bo was busily working his mouth and throat up and down Alex’s shaft when he started to notice it was getting a little harder to breath with each thrust. It also felt like Alex’s balls were growing larger; he could feel them churning in his hands, growing. Bo noticed the hair around Alex’s crotch thickening and darkening. He knew it was happening again, that the cock in his throat was creeping deeper and stretching wider as he lovingly pleasured his new friend. But once again it only encouraged Bo to work harder.<br />
Alex shut his eyes and clenched his jaw hard to keep from crying out as he came, Bo gratefully swallowing every drop. Alex fell back into the chair, his mind reeling from his latest orgasm. He looked down at his cock and was shocked to see that it had grown longer and thicker, almost the exact shape as Bo’s. His balls were even larger than before.<br />
“My gods, your cock almost looks like mine!” Bo exclaimed, whipping his mouth on the back of his harm.<br />
“I hope that was the last bit of Roc’s magic,” lex said between deep breaths. <br />
“It was just as hot as last night, feeling you grow larger in my mouth while I was sucking you. I’m going to remember that tonight.” Bo pulled Alex out of his seat and pulled him in for another kiss, this one soft and slow. “Now come on. You need to pack your things and Paw needs my help. Get going, sweetheart.” And like his father before him, Bo Gave Alex’s ass a hearty slap before parting the room.<br />
Alex quickly collected himself and left the kitchen. He climbed up the stairs and back to Bo’s room, collecting his few possessions in his sack while noting how tight his jeans felt in the crotch now. How did Bo walk with a thing like this in his pants, Alex wondered? While he was packing, he heard a gentle knocking behind him, turning to see Kirk standing in the doorway.<br />
“Hello, Alex.” He entered the room, holding a little package in his hand. “I’m sorry we didn’t get a chance to talk more. My husband and my son can be quite boisterous, as you well know.” Alex blushed at that and Kirk smiled knowingly before continuing on.<br />
“I’m glad you and my son had fun last night. But I thought you might want to take this with you before you leave.”<br />
He handed Alex the package he had been holding. Opening it, Alex found a little ball of what looked like green clay, wrapped in soft green leaves. The smell reminded him of the smell of spirulina back home.<br />
“Um, what is this?”<br />
Kirk gave him a curious look, “You don’t know what this is?”<br />
“No,”<br />
“Your Birth Father never talked to you about this? Showed you what this is and what it does?”<br />
“No, Sir.”<br />
Kirk sighed and shook his head, and suddenly Alex felt like he was about to get a Talk.<br />
“Well, you’re here now, so its time you learn. This is an enemic dumpling: it is made from a special herb that is common around these parts.” Kirk seemed to steel himself before continuing, “When two men have sex, the receiving partner runs the chance of getting pregnant. When you eat this within a few hours or days of sex, it purges your system and prevents a pregnancy from happening.”<br />
Alex looked again at the tiny herb-ball, “So I eat it?”<br />
“Yes, but I warn you; it tastes terrible. Your father really never discussed this with you?” Kirk asked again incredulously.<br />
Alex did some quick thinking before replying, “My father, er, fathers were really uncomfortable talking about this sort of thing. Very conservative.” <br />
Kirk frowned, “How odd.”<br />
“Thank you, Sir, I really appreciate this. I wasn’t even thinking.”:<br />
“Please call me Kirk. And its my pleasure; I was young once too.” He stood up from the bed and then leaned over to give me a surprisingly maternal kiss on the forehead before departing the room.<br />
Alex wrapped his magical Plan B back up and stuffed it in his pack, sweeping the room before departing. He went down stairs and up to the front door. He thought about going out the to say good bye to Rick and Kirk, and to give Bo one last kiss. But instead, he opened the front door, politely shut it behind him, and continued down the road to Dicktin.</p>
