<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda was sighing as she stirred from her nap; feeling warm and content from her husband as he was snuggled and spooning her. Benton was in his fursona while Amanda shifted back to her human form after there bout of intense love making. Wanting to feel her husband’s fur on her soft silky skin; keeping her warm as she soundly slept.<br />
“You’re awake now,” Benton speaking up; “enjoy your nap?”<br />
“Did you not nod off as well,” Amanda stretching as she rolls over to stare at Benton.<br />
“No,” Benton smiling as he gently brushed the red hair covering his wife’s eyes; “I was just enjoying watching you nap. You know you softly purr when sleeping.”<br />
“That’s because,” Amanda kissing her husband; “you were keeping me safe and warm. But now I’m hungry,” Amanda freeing herself from Benton’s embrace and getting up to get dressed; “lets head to Grrrrrrr.”<br />
“I’ll get the robes,” Benton purrs; “you just put on that twenty thousand dollar diamond choker.”<br />
“Collar,” Amanda correcting Benton; “It’s a collar. But why wear only robes?”<br />
“The sun finally set a few minutes ago and it has been snowing,” Benton answers; “and if what Frieda says is true about Grrrrrrr, we will be dining in our Fursona. No need to get dressed other than a robe as we head to the restaurant.”<br />
“Oh we have to have a romp in the snow afterwards,” Amanda grinning as she once again shifts into were-panthress fursona.<br />
“What has gotten into you Amanda,” Benton chuckling?<br />
“Well just recently,” Amanda smiling slyly; “you. But you spend several day cooped up in a hospital room and not get antsy for some fun.”<br />
Benton laughs; “Alright, let’s go then. The robes should still be in the town car. I just need to get my wallet and phone.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
While Benton would never think of driving his Lamborghini Veneno while in his fursona; driving the town car which has more leg room was another matter. Wearing the red rob he got earlier while Amanda was wearing her blue robe. Amanda’s only fashion accessory while in her fursona was a tight fitting diamond necklace that freaked Benton out when Amanda bought it. Seeing her wear it and nothing else while lying in bed waiting for him, when he stomped home mad, definitely took the anger away as Amanda was yearning to be claimed by Benton that day.<br />
<br />
Pulling up to the main entrance of Grrrrrrr; Benton and Amanda step out. Their digitigrade paws crunching in the freshly fallen snow as the valet; also a were takes Benton’s keys and drives off to park the town car a discreet distance away. Benton and Amanda both smiling as they approach the entrance, they meet up with a man and a woman also approaching the restaurant. The man in full military dress while the woman was wearing a black dress; neither feeling the biting cold of winter as they went in.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to Grrrrrrr,” The attendant growling the name indicating he is a were as well as the two couples that entered the establishment. Seeing one couple already in their fursona as they stepped forward while the second were still human didn’t deter the attendant from his job. “We are a restaurant that caters to weres. There are a few ground rules before entering beyond these red doors. First rule, you dine in your fursona. Second rule, no sex. And thirdly we don’t serve alcohol.”<br />
“Our daughter told us all about this place,” Benton removing his robe; “She and her friends dined hear last Sunday.”<br />
“Is your daughter Frieda,” the man in the military uniform speaking up.<br />
“Yes,” Benton looking at the man; “why do you ask?”<br />
“Because my daughter Spencer was also here last Sunday,” the man in the military uniform answers; “the name is Evan Lawson.” Evan pointing to his wife; “my wife Maggie Lawson.”<br />
 <br />
Maggie not waiting for her husband, takes off her dress just as she starts to shift in her were-panther/feline hybrid fursoana. Benton looking at Maggie couldn’t help but stare.<br />
“Well I see where your daughter gets her looks from,” Benton speaking up; “she and Eric caused quite the scene last night as they were inducted into the were-panther pride.”<br />
“Eyes on me Benton,” Amanda looking jealous; “or I’ll scratch your eyes out and make you listen to me fondling myself.”<br />
Evan cocks an eyebrow as he starts to remove his military togs; handing them to the attendant as he shifts into his werewolf fursona. With black fur sprouting over his body while his bones crack and shift to a more lupine form; with menacing golden amber eyes, Evan was clearly a werewolf you wouldn’t want to cross.<br />
Benton just looks at the were in front of him and thinks to himself, ‘dam. Spencer’s father is no slouch.’ Speaking; “shall we share a table or go our separate ways?”<br />
<br />
Minutes later both couples were seated. Choosing to share a table as both couples were keen on getting to know each other, despite the apprehension both share upon meeting for the first time. Their waiter a were-tiger approaches begins to explain the oddity of not having menus.<br />
“Here at Grrrrrrr we have a set meal. While most restaurants provide multiple selections, we feel it’s best for all to be served the same meal so as to avoid conflicting food smells; us weres having heightened sense and all that, plus we want you to thoroughly enjoy your meal with your significant other and friends. Can I start you with something to drink as you wait for your meal?”<br />
“Interesting,” Benton speaking up; “what is the meal for this evening?”<br />
“It’s a three course meal; starting with Butternut squash risotto. The Entrée is a braised pork belly with parsnip fries and buttered carrots and peas.” The waiter grinning; “the dessert is a surprise.”<br />
Amanda lightly chuckling; “I remember Frieda mentioning the dessert was orgasmic inducing, husband.”<br />
“And I’m not,” Benton placing a paw on his wife’s thigh, his clawed thumb brushing the cleft of her sex; “I’ll have a half ice tea and half lemonade if you got any.”<br />
“Same here,” Amanda grinning; holding back a moan as her Husband lightly tickles her neither’s.<br />
“I’ll have a fruit punch smoothie,” Maggie adds.<br />
“Mango smoothie for me,” Evan adding.<br />
<br />
“So two Arnold Palmers, as well as a fruit punch and a mango smoothie,” the were-tiger waiter repeats; “I’ll be back shortly with your drinks. And your Risotto should arrive a few minutes later.”<br />
<br />
As the waiter left Maggie was the first to speak up.<br />
“It’s nice to see you finally out of the hospital Amanda,” Maggie states.<br />
“How did you know I was in the hospital,” Amanda looking shocked?<br />
“I’m a doctor,” Maggie answers; “I do the night shifts at the hospital ER. Plus I heard from the various nursing staff how much grief you gave them.”<br />
“And I’m sure the nurses are thrilled that my wife is finally out as well,” Benton looking at his wife.<br />
“So you were on call last Friday,” Amanda speaking up; “when I arrived from the ambulance.”<br />
“No,” Maggie answers; “that was my night off. But I was at the hospital with the Anderson with regards to what happened earlier.”<br />
<br />
Benton blanched; he knew that Maggie was referring to attacking Eric Anderson and then having to deal with a pissed off Mike Lawson who was a werewolf.<br />
“Yeah,” Benton sighing; “that was… an unfortunate night. One I’m hoping to put behind me.”<br />
“Then try and steer clear of my father,” Evan answering; “he may be retired from military service, but that doesn’t mean he’s forgotten his training.”<br />
“I would have won in in the end,” Benton answering.<br />
“Fat chance,” Evan retorting back; “My father would have eventually had you on the ground screaming in pain, wishing you were never born. Hell even Spencer could do that and I only taught her a few defensive moves.”<br />
“I saw your daughter use one of those moves last night,” Benton chuckling; “she had a were-panthress twice her size and at least three times her age bawling like a baby. I actually smiled at that image. The were-panthress tried to force herself onto Eric Anderson and Spencer gave the woman the surprise of her life.”<br />
“And what else happened last night,” Maggie asked?<br />
“Well, other than that incident,” Benton answering; “My daughter, your daughter and Eric were up until around midnight giving me worry lines as they go at it with wild abandon.”<br />
Evan laughs; “Eric is a good kid. You shouldn&#39;t have to worry about him harming your daughter.”<br />
“Well,” Benton sighing; “he and Spencer have made Frieda happy. More happy then I have seen her in a long time.”<br />
<br />
As they chatted, there were-tiger waiter returned with their drinks; each taking a sip. Amanda was the first to speak up.<br />
“So what has brought you two to this restaurant?”<br />
“Well apart from our daughter talking this place up,” Maggie speaking up; “Evan and I are doing something romantic,” Looking at her husband and grinning; “again.”<br />
“We are also trying for another cub,” Evan grinning.<br />
Ohhhh,” Benton grinning; “big love planned later tonight?”<br />
“And tomorrow,” Evan giving a wolfish grin.<br />
“We won’t be officially starting until tomorrow Evan,” Maggie licking her lips; “tonight we play. I took my were-pill this morning, but the next day?” Maggie grins.<br />
Evan smiles; his arousal starting to show as his member begins peaking from his sheathe. Shifting in his seat as he tries to stifle the urge to mount his wife in the restaurant; he takes a big sip of his drink and he feels his wife’s paw on his thigh, slowly travelling towards his rapidly engorged lupine cock.<br />
“No Maggie,” Placing his paw on hers to stop her advance; “remember the no sex rule this place has.”<br />
“If it helps,” Benton grinning; “I’m having a hard time keeping Amanda’s paws off my eager rocket.”</p>
