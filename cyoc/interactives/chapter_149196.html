<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Mr Pauls did what?&quot; Lee&#39;s mother took off her reading glasses and pursed her lips angrily. Emily was an attractive woman in her early forties with long auburn hair. A lawyer by profession, her looks could have sustained a career in modelling, and she used them to her best advantage in the courtroom. Today she wore a light form-fitting grey pant suit with a frontage cut to expose an unobjectionable hint of cleavage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s not on, is it dear?&quot; Lee&#39;s father, a tall, slim man with dark hair, wandered over and put his hand on Lee&#39;s shoulder in what was probably supposed to be a reassuring gesture. &quot;I remember even when I was at school teachers weren&#39;t supposed to stop students using the bathrooms. And we were all toilet-trained by your age.&quot; He added it as an absent-minded aside.<br />
<br />
Lee flushed and turned away. His mother, noticing the gesture leaned in and stroked his cheek.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh, Lee, don&#39;t let it get you down. Lots of people your age are in just the same boat.&quot; More than you know, Lee thought.<br />
<br />
 &quot;So you&#39;ll talk to Mr Pauls?&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily frowned and turned to her husband. &quot;Well, we understand how difficult it must be for teachers this days trying to cope with children with a wide range of ... needs. I don&#39;t think it would really help if I went marching in there asking for special treatment for my son, would it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee found himself shaking his head, even though that&#39;s exactly what he wanted. Then he remembered Carmen&#39;s bright smile and the feeling of her hand, and felt something welling up inside him that he would later identify as courage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually... Mom. It&#39;s not just me. I would mean a lot if you maybe had a word with the principal. Students who aren&#39;t ready for... potty training feel terrified because of how the teachers are. I think it would mean a lot if you said something. About a quarter of kids my year have gone back to diapers, and...&quot; he caught his father&#39;s brow wrinkling in vague disapproval &quot;...and I think the way the school treats us makes us so anxious we can&#39;t focus on training.&quot; The wrinkles disappeared. Good play, Lee thought.<br />
<br />
His parents exchanged glances. &quot;Well, Lee,&quot; Emily said, &quot;we don&#39;t want you to fall behind. We want what&#39;s best for you, and that involves getting you out of diapers.&quot; Lee&#39;s heart fell. &quot;But I think what you&#39;ve said makes a lot of sense, and the pressure the school is putting you under is having a counter-productive effect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like what the experts would say,&quot; his father said, a little uncertainly. &quot;Too much pressure can lead to the opposite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily kissed Lee&#39;s forehead. &quot;I&#39;ll speak to Principal Green tomorrow, or whenever she&#39;s free.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee&#39;s mother pressed him tight against her full chest and his dad gathered them both up in a bear hug. He felt safe, secure. Why would I ever want to give this up, he thought?<br />
---<br />
The next day, Lee saw his mother walk past the door of his English class. Emily didn&#39;t look in - probably didn&#39;t even know that was where he was. Her long hair was gathered back in a ponytail and the suit was a shade darker than normal, with a subtly lower cut top. She looked beautiful, determined, and a little vicious. Go Mom, Lee thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Lee, isn&#39;t that your Mom? Is she here to change your diaper?&quot; cat-called Ryan Tetch, a skinny, sarcastic boy who played the class clown. He&#39;d just left trainers by the end of third grade and was enjoying teasing those who hadn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lee&#39;s-in-trouble!&quot; someone half-chanted, to a chorus of tittering. The teacher, Mrs MacEnroe, turned around. She was relatively young - twenty-something and slim, with dark hair and a modest chest. She had become known amongst the more precocious boys for her skirts, which were just slightly shorter than you might expect a teacher to find appropriate. She had slender but curvaceous legs, which Lee had just begun to find interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s quite enough of that!&quot; she said in her high, almost musical voice. &quot;Lee, if you&#39;re called for any reason, it&#39;s okay to go without asking me, OK?&quot; Lee nodded. My knight in almost-mini-skirt armor, he thought.<br />
<br />
The day passed uneventfully - except for a few trickles which had Lee resort to a diaper change before his last period. When he asked his mother that evening what she had said to the Principal, she gave a wry, lopsided smile and said she thought things might be changing soon. That night he slept tight with no leakage whatsoever.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The following Monday, Lee felt a familiar sense of dread steal over him. Double Math. Except his fellow students seemed a little more buoyant than before as they walked to school.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Lee asked Samantha, a pretty blonde girl a few months younger than him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Christopher Brians says Mr Pauls has been sacked.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Serves him right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee scarcely dared to hope, but on entering the classroom the rumours were seemingly proven right - an elderly female who introduced herself as a supply teacher led them painfully through an equation to find the area of a somewhat implausible triangular room.<br />
<br />
Lee put up his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dear?&quot; said the teacher, squinting through coke-bottle glasses. &quot;Found the answer already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I be excused, Miss? I need to use the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
An odd look crossed the supply teacher&#39;s face. It wasn&#39;t disapproval. It was fear. &quot;Of course, dearie. Please take as long as you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Lee left the classroom, he heard the sound of scattered applause, and out of the corner of his eye saw half a dozen more hands go up.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The new policy was announced by Principal Green at the next school assembly. No mention was made of the disappeared Mr Pauls.<br />
<br />
Instead, the Principal explained, &quot;to help all our students stay safe and well, and to ease your transition into adult habits, we&#39;re investing more in self-change&quot; - she pointedly didn&#39;t use the word &#39;diaper&#39; &quot;-stations, and will ensure that you have as much time as you need to make sure you are dry and comfortable before moving onto your next class. This means a slight reduction in the overall length of each period, from 55 minutes to 50 minutes. I am asking teachers to ensure that if you have an emergency during class you must also be permitted to use the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lee smiled. The Revolution had claimed its first scalp, and he had the feeling it was only going to get better from here.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
That night, Lee lay in bed, head still full of the day and what it meant. The feeling of power was indescribable - to have taken revenge on Mr Pauls and actually made life better for every student in the school. He felt his groin stir - not the need of his bladder but something further down - and rolled back the diaper to access his penis. His hand slowly stroked the growing length of his four-inch woody, imagining his mother - his beautiful mom - arguing his case before Principal Green with the same passion as she might defend an accused man. The look of astonishment he imagined on the Principal&#39;s own quite young and pretty face was irresistable, and he felt himself approach climax. He buried his hard shaft in the diaper and let the sensation engulfing his penis tip him over the edge, bucking his hips hard into the cushy softness until he was spent. What little semen he&#39;d produced had been almost immediately absorbed by the diaper. He rolled over and fell asleep in less than a minute.</p>
