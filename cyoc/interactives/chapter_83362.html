<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vinny took a moment to catch his breath, and spit out some of the blood that had been pooling in his mouth after a a nastier punch from Brian. Just where the hell did these two get off, coming into his camp, and stealing one of his does? He was tempted to settle this right here and now, but he was coming down off his earlier adrenaline high and feeling a bit sore from all the fighting he&#39;d already done today. Whatever. He&#39;d already nailed that one and broken her spirit. This &#39;Lord Jeremy&#39; could have her for now. Tomorrow when he was back at full strength, they&#39;d settle this. He&#39;d claim his doe as a prize, and add her to his harem. Speaking of which, there were still a few virgins waiting to be broken in, and they&#39;d already made it clear just how bad they needed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you go thinking this is over,&quot; he said, as he walked back to the rest of the Stags. He caught a little doubt on a couple faces, but once he was sure the party crashers were heading home, it only took him barking out a couple simple commands to restore his image as new head of the Order. These other does all still had just one thing on their mind, and it seemed like the perfect way to take out his frustrations. He swept the one with the biggest tits off her feet to her obvious delight and said &quot;Well! You all know the pecking order. Line up and take your prizes!&quot; before finding a place to lay her down and break her in.<br />
<br />

<br />
Harry considered his chances. Running wasn&#39;t an option. They were armed, and there was nothing around to take cover behind other than a few rocks. That had been a pretty long access road too. Once they were through those doors though, this would get a lot harder. That only left one option. Riskier than he&#39;d like, but what else could he do?<br />
<br />
Years of training kicked in, as Harry jumped one of the guards, disarmed him, locked his arm, and positioned him as a human shield. &quot;Here&#39;s how this is going to go!&quot; he barked. &quot;One of you is going to start that truck back up, and we are going to take a little ride back to town. Nobody gets hurt, and nobody&#39;s going to jail, except for whoever pays your salaries. Sound good to you?&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Naturally, no news of any of these events had reached the rabbit warren yet, where things were carrying on in their usual fashion. As the sun began to set outside, Katerina stood up in the main den to make an announcement. &quot;I&#39;m afraid tonight&#39;s my last night for this trip, everyone. You know I&#39;m going to miss you all when I head back to work. Hopefully we&#39;ll all meet again next year. For now though, if there&#39;s any young bucks who want to give me a proper sendoff, you know where to find me!&quot; She grinned.<br />
<br />
Terry was surprised to hear it. She had a bit less than a month and a half left on her stay, officially, but when it came to it, she was going to do everything in her power to stay on indefinitely. She couldn&#39;t comprehend how anyone would ever want to leave a paradise like this.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Mark scowled as he considered the message he had received. While there was nothing at the park that would reveal the location, or even the existence of this new facility, larger scale investigations of the company as a whole might cause some problems. This latest merfolk trial seemed quite promising so far. The subjects clearly had no problems with orientation or mobility, they were staying active enough to keep their blood properly oxygenated, and it seemed even the modifications he&#39;d applied to their ears and larynxes allowed them to understand each other. He wondered if they even realized it was all just high frequency squeaks and pops to everyone else. Yes, keeping that bit of dolphin in the mix definitely seemed to do the trick. Long term, the semi-vestigial lungs could cause complications, but the version with gills alone had been far too sullen. He sighed, realizing how likely it was he&#39;d have to release these two before developing a device to re-enable proper communication with anyone else. Too much risk in what they&#39;d likely have to say. In fact, if this investigation got serious enough, he might have to release this pair to the wild before even having a chance to observe their reproductive behavior. He&#39;d been quite looking forward to that, and not just for the sake of scientific curiosity. The female had come out quite nicely from the waist up. He had to wonder how much of a step up it was from her original human form.<br />
<br />

Goldie was happy to see Zack, instinctively looking to him as temporary pack leader with Harry missing, and explained the situation as best as she was able. However, she hardly new any more than he did. The human who had announced Dunstan as new leader had left in something of a hurry, most likely caught somewhere by Agent Sherman, or too distracted trying to dispose of evidence to deal with this situation. No one seemed to have any idea where Harry could be, but Zack and Katie were at least able to explain to the others why he had disappeared, and all the possibilities seemed rather grim. Following Goldie&#39;s lead, most of the other huskies seemed to be looking to Zack for orders now, and there was an awful lot that needed to be done.<br />
<br />

<br />
Cherry was, as usual, conflicted as she followed Jeremy and Lateshia, but not in the same way she usually was. Overriding any other concerns, she needed sex right now, and she needed it bad. As one of the &#39;improved&#39; does whose creation others were doing their best to hide as computers and other records were seized, her brain chemistry had been altered to make her quite easily aroused, and naturally subservient to any buck, and this coupled with the thrill of having three of them fighting for the right to claim her as a prize, as she saw things, had pushed her very much over the edge. Lord Jeremy had so much power and authority he didn&#39;t even need to fight and prove it, so currently, he was the target of her adoration. However, he already had a favorite doe, and if she told him everything she&#39;d be asked to, she would recognize her from when they last talked, and she would poison him against her. She&#39;d need to be careful with what she said, and be absolutely sure not to respond to her old name.<br />
<br />

<br />
Agent Sherman didn&#39;t like how fast this guy had arrived on the scene, but he was pretty sure he knew how to handle him. &quot;You&#39;re welcome to sit in when we start taking statements, but we won&#39;t be making any arrests until all this has been sent back to Washington for proper analysis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? The way I hear it, one of the park guests is already in a holding cell, and the police seem to pulling everyone aside who&#39;s trying to leave. I&#39;m also told everyone looking to begin their stay in the park today is being turned away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, we made an arrest here earlier as part of an unrelated investigation, and it&#39;s a safe bet the park is not willing to pay for his legal representation. Interviewing people leaving the scene of an investigation is fairly standard procedure, particularly under circumstances like these. So long as nobody tries to leave the state before we know who&#39;s going to be called in for a trial, they&#39;re all free to leave. New guests are being turned away only because the computers which control those chambers are the very same computers containing the evidence we are here to collect, and believe me, nobody wishes that weren&#39;t the case more than me.&quot; His clothes were starting to pinch in places, leading to some awkward adjustments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not enjoying yourself as a skunk? From the suit I&#39;d have guessed otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, it&#39;s been a really long day. It&#39;s bad enough that I&#39;m stuck with this body and this joke of a suit. I am going to have a hell of a time checking into a motel tonight, and once things are finished here, I am going to have what I&#39;m sure will be a lovely time convincing my bank to wire me the money to pay for it. Could you please have at least enough decency to let me finish things here, and give me the third degree some other time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, as it happens, part of what I do here is sort out identification issues for guests who decide to keep their fur. How about I treat you to dinner tonight, and we talk things over then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Was this guy for real? On the other hand, the only other option he had was to leech off Johnson for the rest of this trip, bumming meals off him, sharing his motel room... between his sick skunk fetish and that unwelcome eyeful of his crotch he&#39;d gotten when they&#39;d first been turned into skunks... At least this guy he could trust not to pull anything funny. He had a lot more to risk creating a conflict of interest as the lawyer who&#39;d be defending this scum in court than Sherman did. His job was more or less done here after today.<br />

As Harry started backing towards the truck, a bullet caught him in the shoulder. He cursed, almost dropping the gun. Of course, he thought. They must have a transformation chamber on site here. Instant recovery from any injuries, so no reason to worry about hitting your partner. It was the same reason he usually had nothing to fear when trying to bring someone in. And the sound was going to attract back up from inside.  Even if he had the keys, it didn&#39;t look like he&#39;d be able to drive away without being shot... and Harry had been a husky long enough he didn&#39;t have a lot of confidence behind the wheel anymore. It was starting to look like his only options here were surrender or going out in a blaze of glory. Why had he been too stubborn to talk to that FBI agent about all this when he&#39;d had the chance? If he was going to get stupid and violent, he could at least have taken a good swing at that corrupt manager...</p>
