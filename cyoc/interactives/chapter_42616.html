<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle looked back at Valerie. It was odd-- she <i>did</i> have some features similar in appearance to Jenny, but she didn't look or act anywhere near as bitchy. She seemed much nicer, and Kyle realized that, despite the resemblance to the girl who had pantsed him, he found himself thinking she was sort of... well, cute. And besides, he had never meant to humiliate anybody but Jenny-- it would make him no better than she was to him. He picked up one of the packs of paper, so as to not seem conspicuous in front of Valerie while answering Jenny. "Hmm... yes..."
<br>
<br>
Jenny was relieved. Maybe even that creep Kyle had a conscious after all. *Really? Oh, thank you! All you've got to do is... um... get my sister to take... me off...* Jenny realized that she hadn't thought this through too well. Even with Kyle's help, this wasn't going to be an easy task.
<br>
<br>
Kyle turned to Valerie, to secretly talk to Jennifer again. "Well, what do you suggest?"
<br>
<br>
Valerie answered back, "Well, it depends on what the job is. If you're putting flyers up around your school, I'd personally recommend the fluorescent yellow or green printer paper. They're the easiest to read, and the ones that jump out the most."
<br>
<br>
Jenny followed her sister's answer. *Um... I guess... Try taking her aside and just telling her the situation calmly. She might not believe you at first, but you have to convince her you're telling the truth.*
<br>
<br>
"Okay," sighed Kyle, "I'll give it a shot." He turned once more to Valerie and glanced at her name tag. "Um... Valerie, is it? I know this is going to seem odd, but I... um... actually have to tell you something privately. It's about Jenny."
<br>
<br>
"Uh... okay," said Valerie. "We can talk near the back." Valerie led Kyle toward the back of the store, into a secluded aisle. "So, what about my sister?"
<br>
<br>
"You're not going to believe me," cautioned Kyle, "but I swear to you I'm not lying. This is absolutely the truth. Your sister is... the pair of panties you're wearing right now."
<br>
<br>
Kyle picked himself off the floor. He still had a big red handprint on one of his cheeks, where Valerie had slapped him. "Perv!" shouted Valerie. *Idiot!* shouted Jennifer.
<br>
<br>
"Please! Let me explain!" begged Kyle.
<br>
<br>
"Fine, but it better be good, or I'm calling Ted and having you thrown out of the store."
<br>
<br>
Kyle began to explain. "My name is Kyle Perkins. Last week your sister and a group of her friends pantsed me at school."
<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry to hear that," said Valerie, still guarded about Kyle's first statement. "My sister can be a bitch sometimes."
<br>
<br>
Jennifer groaned. *Yeah, yeah, I get it. I'm a bitch.*
<br>
<br>
Kyle began to laugh, but quickly regained his composure once more. "Er... um... so, anyway... I got back at her earlier this morning."
<br>
<br>
"What did you do to her?" asked Valerie.
<br>
<br>
"I called her up, and I gave her the Transform or Dare curse."
<br>
<br>
Valerie raised a doubting eyebrow. She'd heard of the curse, and a friend of a friend of Diane's had told her that she'd been affected by it, though she wouldn't exactly say what had happened to her. Valerie was skeptical. Her mind filled in the blanks in Kyle's story. "Let me guess. You turned her into a pair of panties?"
<br>
<br>
"Wellll... no, not right away. I turned her into a shapeshifter, and then told her she had to turn into anything anyone wanted, and that she would remain under each person's command for five hours. <i>Then</i> I turned her into a pair of panties. But see, that's why you've got to listen to me. That was almost five hours ago. If you don't take her off, she's going to turn back into her human form while you're still wearing her... and trust me, you don't want that."
<br>
<br>
Valerie was still not buying it. "Uh... huh. Okay, I'm calling security."
<br>
<br>
*Dammit, Kyle! Do something!* screamed Jenny. *She's going to have you kicked out!*
<br>
<br>
Kyle scrambled to think of something quickly, to make Valerie believe him. There was only one thing he could think of to salvage the situation.
<br>
<br>
"Okay, Valerie, I'm sorry I have to do this, but this is the only way I know how to make you believe me. Jenny, turn into your sister's penis!"
<br>
<br>
"What the f--!!!" Valerie trailed off. At first it was Kyle's words that disturbed her the most... but then she began to feel some rather unnerving changes to her nether region. Not only could she feel her new genitalia bulging outward and then drooping, but she realized she also no longer was wearing any underwear. Valerie quickly ducked into the stockroom nearby, and checked to make sure nobody was around. Once she was certain no one was watching her, she slid down her skirt. To her horror, she found that her vagina was gone, and that it had indeed been replaced by a penis and a pair of testes. Shaking, she slowly reached down a hand to touch it, to make sure it was real.
<br>
<br>
Although suddenly having male genitalia was bad enough, the next thought that entered her head was even more disturbing. It was her sister. "Jenny?" she called, looking down. "Oh my god... Jenny, is that really <i>you</i>?" Her penis just hung there, not answering. Somehow, Valerie <i>knew</i> it really was her.
<br>
<br>
Valerie pulled up her skirt and stormed back out to where Kyle was waiting. "What the fuck have you done to me? And to Jenny!?"
<br>
<br>
"I'm sorry!" answered Kyle. "It was the only way I could think of to really convince you!"
<br>
<br>
*Goddammit, Kyle! This is disgusting!* interrupted Jenny. *When I told you to think of something, I was expecting something that wouldn't involve me becoming <i>part of her</i>! Why didn't you just tell me to change colors or something?! You could've convinced her without turning me into my sister's dick!*
<br>
<br>
"Turn her back!" demanded Valerie.
<br>
<br>
"Right here and now? Are you sure? That might be kind of awkward..."
<br>
<br>
"Not back into a human, you nitwit! Turn her back into a pair of panties, so I can take her off first!"
<br>
<br>
Kyle nodded. "Um... okay... Jenny, turn into a..."</p>
