<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ian thought about who to change next he remembered Dylan, a guitar playing sophomore.  He smiled a bit to <br />
himself at the genius of the idea.  Dylan was from the south and had moved up here with his parents last year.  <br />
He was very self-conscious about his so-called ‘bible thumper Baptist’ parents and southern stereotypes so he <br />
did all he could to fit in.  In fact, you wouldn’t even know he was from the south if you weren’t truly <br />
looking.  He had all but rid himself of his accent and mannerisms, kept himself very clean and dressed mostly <br />
in skater type clothing and shunned his parent’s religious ways much to their chagrin.  He had a round boyish <br />
face with blue eyes and shaggy brown hair.  He was about average in height and very lean, made all the more <br />
apparent by his skinny jeans and tight tee shirts.  All in all he looked every bit the average skater boy who <br />
played a little rock on the side on his guitar but Ian thought it was high time he accepted his heritage…<br />
<br />
Ian quickly and somewhat reluctantly allowed his body to shrink back down into the guise of an emo teenager.  <br />
He was becoming more adept and accepting towards the constantly changing but he still preferred his ‘real’ <br />
body.  Leaving the others to help the new bass player set up Ian walked through the halls pretending to just <br />
be wondering aimlessly but actually searching diligently for Dylan.  He finally spotted him just leaving music <br />
class and casually passed by, giving him a friendly pat on the back and asking about his guitar playing.  Ian <br />
pretended to listen to the shy boys reply and then excused himself, Dylan would be coming back to him soon <br />
enough.  <br />
<br />
Dylan thought it odd that Ian had suddenly talked to him, he usually hung out with a much darker crowd but he <br />
quickly put it aside and went to meet up with his friends.  As he walked he couldn’t help thinking about how <br />
sad he was making his parents with his choices, they just wanted him to be more like a traditional southern <br />
kid, a bit like his parents.  Maybe he would humor them and go to local church.   The new pastor was supposed <br />
to be really inspiring.  He didn’t know where these thoughts came from but they only grew stronger.  Dylan <br />
didn’t notice, but someone watching might pick up that as he walked his pace gradually shifted.  He started <br />
with his shoulders hunched, his legs close together and eyes somewhat tilted down but with each step he seemed <br />
a little more confident.  His stride gradually lengthened and his legs spread further as his shoulders slowly <br />
moved back, from the awkward stride of a shy teenager to a more proud, confident and macho gait.  His thoughts <br />
continued to exist elsewhere thinking more and more about trying to appease his parents, he realized he was <br />
already at his locker and his friend was staring at him strangely.<br />
<br />
“Oh hey Brian… is there something on my face?”  Brian shook his head.<br />
<br />
“No man, just you look a little different, you cut your hair or something it seems shorter and I think your <br />
accents coming back a little.”<br />
<br />
“Nah, that can’t be right… hey I think it is.”  Dylan noticed a southern accent was starting to tinge his <br />
words but try as he might it just got stronger.<br />
<br />
“The heck… this ain’t how I was talkin’ earlier.”  Dylan coughed a bit, his voice sounded kind of rough, <br />
deeper, maybe it was just a cold but since when did colds cause accents?  <br />
<br />
“Its cool man, relax, you’re probably just stressed about Katie.”  Brian laughed, Katie was the girl Dylan was <br />
crushing on, he even planned to ask her out today and Brian knew as much.  <br />
<br />
“You reckon she’ll go for a guy like me?”<br />
<br />
“Well I reckon you should shave first but sure why not?”  Brian gave his friend a playful jab but Dylan stood <br />
there confused, he’d never shaved a day in his life but as he lifted his hand to his face he did feel some <br />
hairs poking through.  He looked at himself on his phone and saw his chin was darkened by quite a few new <br />
hairs and even some above his upper lip.  Part of him was kind of excited by the idea and part of him was just <br />
disgusted.<br />
<br />
Dylan excused himself and went to go try his luck with Katie.  People looked at him funny as he went by and he <br />
pulled at his clothes a little.  He was starting to question why he bought this stuff.  These skinny jeans <br />
were so tight and ugly he really just wanted to wear some old fashioned jeans and maybe a wifebeater to show <br />
off how great his arms were getting.  Wait?  When did his arms get good and when did he care?  But they were <br />
nice now that he thought about it, they looked darker, he could see a nice farmers tan coming in.  The biceps <br />
were round and firm, big without even flexing.  He smiled a bit smugly but couldn’t shake the feeling that <br />
something was off.  He kept adjusting the skinny jeans they were tight, tighter than they should’ve been.  It <br />
felt almost like he was growing under there.  His pecs were also pushing out somewhat into his shirt.  Before <br />
he had been pretty flat chested but it was starting to look like he worked out on a regular basis, or did <br />
heavy labor.  <br />
<br />
When he finally spotted Katie he stopped, the swelling in his jeans and the tightness in his chest said he <br />
wanted her but he knew God didn’t want him to do this nor would his ma and pa he realized.  He needed to wait.  <br />
He felt conflicted, he knew something was wrong and different he wasn’t like this when he woke up.  He felt <br />
his face and his bigger hands brushed a full goatee and much thicker ‘peach fuzz’ on his lip.  Even his arm <br />
was covered in darker hairs.  He grasped as his formerly shaggy hair but it retracted even more quickly into a <br />
short crew cut.  Something was calling him to the band room and the urge to please his parents, to change was <br />
growing getting so strong he couldn’t think.  He felt knowledge flooding out of his head, knowledge he was now <br />
ashamed of until only beautiful simplicity remained, the bare essentials of worship and living.  How to work, <br />
how to play his guitar, country music, helping around the house…  His head vibrated with all that was lost and <br />
gained.  As he rushed to the band room his pace quickened, his legs had thickened and become beefy, hairy legs <br />
to match his larger arms.  They were big from playing sports with the guys after school.  Football, wrestling, <br />
sometimes baseball but only manly sports none of that sissy stuff like soccer.  His voice was now very deep <br />
and his mind fogged by the changes.  <br />
<br />
“Glad you could make it!”  Dylan saw Ian, or at least a guy that kind of looked like him waiting inside.  The <br />
door closed behind him and Ian stretched out a hand.  Dylan took it and gave it a firm handshake as he’d been <br />
taught, feeling the warmth inside him become more intense as he did so.  Dylan cringed in pain, his face <br />
contorted with agony as his changes accelerated and completed themselves.  His jeans burst, no longer able to <br />
contain his thicker legs.  His shoes followed suit as his feet went from size 8s to size 12s in mere seconds, <br />
expanding and widening as the toes grew longer and plump.  The shirt was also destroyed, his thick chest now <br />
coated in a decent amount of hair barreled out.  He wasn’t naked for long as Ian handed him a wife beater and <br />
jeans along with some larger boxers and boots.  The now 18 year old, wiped of his former disdain for his <br />
destiny smiled with gratitude and went over to practice guitar while Ian set out to finish the band before <br />
day’s end…</p>
