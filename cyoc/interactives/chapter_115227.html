<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think... I&#39;d like the outpost.&quot; Derrick said hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent&quot; the woman coo&#39;d. Now there&#39;s just a few forms to sign and we will have you all set up. In a flurry, a small books worth of papers appeared. She began requesting initials and signatures on the pages while giving brief explanations of what the documents entailed.<br />
<br />
Form 1963 - Room transfer request- please sign here<br />
Rider 93.04 - Notice that the room transfer may or may not be of equal value and will not incur any additional expenses nor will it cause any refunds, this is an accommodation per your request- please sigh here.<br />
Waiver 5340 - Notice that there are inherent dangers to being located away from the main compound, you will receive a walkie talkie, but your safety is your responsibility.- please sign here.<br />
Form 0009 - By accepting these accommodations you agree to perform certain duties to the best of your ability and will be fairly awarded for doing so. - please sign here.<br />
<br />
The next several batches of documents she smiled sweetly and said she already had on file, and that they were signed by his parents and another copy wasn&#39;t required.<br />
<br />
Waiver 0010 - Some tasks and duties may include risk of bodily harm or death, your safety is your responsibility - please sign here.<br />
<br />
Derrick quickly reviewed and signed the documents accepting the inherent risks, reasoning that, if something seems too dangerous, he wouldn&#39;t do it, as he is only agreeing to do what he perceives to be within his abilities... surprisingly, there was no waiver to forfeit his humanity or allow him to be transformed. This made him feel more sure of his situation, and he was looking forward to relaxing and enjoying the quest scenarios the resort prepared for him to do.<br />
<br />
----POV Swap-----<br />
<br />
Angelia, daughter of Hermes, Goddess of messages, tidings, and proclamation, reviewed the documents the boy had signed. As she reviewed his signatures, the ink on the waiver forms faded off the document and out of existence. Damn! The child&#39;s parents consented to him being transformed, but not to his endangerment, he is of age to consent to barter, but ultimately is not yet fully responsible for himself. Though he consented, it isn&#39;t valid as he is a minor, and though she could get parental consent, they are not in a state of mind for the enchanted document to accept it. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, the child would panic if he saw his family in their current state. His father, now a 20 year old satyr and his mother a dryad who turned their daughter into a rose plant. The covenants that bind the Olympians are clear and this child is dangerous... The Oracle&#39;s prophecy for the Father, Mother, and Daughter were clear but this boy child will, in a weeks time, bring ruin or blessings beyond belief, but how? As prophesy goes, it was frustratingly unclear and there was no followup question and answer time. Many guests have had the prophesy of potentially bringing blessings, this is the first that threatens ruin if blessings are not achieved.<br />
<br />
At first she thought removing his individual identity and having him join staff as a Minotaur would afford him access while removing the pesky free will that often brings destruction... it seemed perfect, but he resisted somehow, though he seemed naturally inclined. Now he is suspicious of everything, and lying outright is forbidden. <br />
<br />
She must keep the boy occupied and away from his family. He is malleable but can no longer be transformed into anything non human due to his expressed revocation of consent which his father foolishly and unwittingly gave. The Olympians are so close to regaining their former glory, and this boy will somehow be their key or downfall, and now it falls on her to find the way... Ugh.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s watching her every move and she had paused too long. She quickly came up with a plan, acting as though the documents were satisfactory, and presenting him with a few quest tasks that she made up on the fly...<br />
<br />
He seemed to accept them readily and went off with the porter she called to him. Exhaling a sigh of relief she quickly scribbled a note, crumpled it up, and used her innate magical abilities to send it to the recipient instantly. Once the message was sent, the crumpled paper was plain and devoid of ink, a trick she learned from her sister, the goddess of mysteries.<br />
<br />

<br />
Derrick watched as the woman reviewed the documents and seemed to fade into her own thoughts for a moment. A second later she returned, cheerful as ever, &quot;Your first task will be to meet the Captain of our army and follow the orders he gives without question. Your second task will be to personalize your living area so it will feel comfortable when you wake up. Your third will be to rest up for tomorrow. Bull will be your guide.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Captain Horner was in his study reviewing scouting reports when a wave of magic struck him. The letters on the page before him rearranged into a message from Angelia. <br />
        &quot;Captain, I am sending a guest to you, he revoked consent to be anything other than human. He is important somehow, and we are currently at an impasse at getting the paperwork signed as his parents are indisposed. I know it&#39;s late but we must get him ready for The Outpost. I want him able to sign the papers by tomorrow morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Captain Horner sighed, &quot;Goddess of Gossip and Overreaction seems more appropriate.&quot; he mumbled to himself. The magic of the message didn&#39;t only carry the words, but he felt the frustrating anger Angelia was harboring when the child revoked consent, and her worry over the documents. He knows what happens to guests who come here, and that &quot;indisposed&quot; probably means mentally changed creature, orgy, inanimate, or some other intoxication if Dionysus is involved... probably all of the above. <br />
<br />
&quot;So a child with no valid guardians is coming, I need to make him ready for ranger duty while leaving him entirely human, and I need to keep him completely safe and yet train him in weapons, fighting and the such... Impossible.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was 6:30 and he was supposed to be dealing with intelligence reports before the end of the day, not some recruit in need of training. He knew what Angelia was asking of him and why it was him the message went to. He had access to the specific types of magic she needed and expected him to just dole it out to some guest. The audacity of some Goddesses...<br />
<br />

<br />
Derrick and Bull arrived some 40 or so minutes later. it was a decent distance but could have been much less time if Bull was less... lumbering? Bull led the way and eventually got him to a door marked &quot;Captains Office&quot; which he knocked on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enter.&quot; was called from the other side. Bull fumbled with the knob for several seconds before getting the door to swing open. Bull stepped back and allowed Derrick to enter before closing the door without entering.<br />
<br />
Derrick politely offered his hand and introduced himself, Captain Horner did the same and invited Derrick to sit. Derrick nervously explained why he was there, uncomfortable with the silence and Captain Horner&#39;s steady glare.<br />
<br />
&quot;May I speak frankly?&quot; Captain Horner asked, leaning back after a moments pause? Derrick went doe eyed and nodded, scared out of his wits.<br />
<br />
&quot;My job is to make you ready to take on jobs, quests as you call them, that would take months of training and skilled knowledge, tomorrow. I can make this happen, it won&#39;t hurt, you&#39;ll probably even like it. As I see it, you&#39;re barely able to help yourself, let alone anyone else. To prepare you, I will need to use magic, and your soft and scrawny little body will change. I understand you insist on remaining fully human, I can even work with that, though it does make this trying task more difficult. I don&#39;t have the patience to answer, how it works, why it works, what will be changed or honestly any of the inane questions you undoubtedly have. You either accept now and we move forward, or leave and let me get back to my work.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick was never spoken to so bluntly. Despite the Captain lacking any semblance of tact, Derrick didn&#39;t sense any malice or underhandedness. He realized that he appreciated knowing exactly where he stood with this man and felt a growing sense of trust. The captain just explained his intent and agreed to his terms. <br />
<br />
&quot;There isnt any way to Not be cha...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you want to survive.&quot; the Captain said icily.<br />
<br />
It seemed as though this place was going to have its way with him... at least this way it would be on his terms. Derrick steeled his resolve, &quot;I accept.&quot;</p>
