<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clara did not need to be a scientist of any sort to ascertain the fact that there were abundant and clandestinely obvious homoerotic signals going on between Max and Neil. The two of them had very obviously been affected by the gym&#39;s strange magical system. She&#39;d seen it first hand - she didn&#39;t need to doubt. She&#39;d seen Lucas and Brock go from two of the straightest guys - so freaking straight - to quite bisexual and obviously so. She&#39;d seen Bradley go from the ubermasculine personal trainer who pulled an overwhelmingly female crowd of customers to...well, someone who still had that, but as of today wore exclusively pink, tiny tank tops that showed most everything and coyly flirted with men and women both - though with this being his eighth day on it he seemed to dedicate a bit more effort to the guys.<br />
<br />
Without knowing about Neil&#39;s sexual effect, she decided there was one solution to this before it boiled over too far. &quot;So, boys,&quot; Clara stated as she stepped forward, &quot;It&#39;s pretty obvious what&#39;s going on here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uhh...&quot; Max awkwardly blushed and covered his groin, knowing full well what she could see just past his hand, &quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You two are giving each other the &quot;come fuck me&quot; eyes,&quot; Clara responded casually. &quot;Pretty obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I---dammit.&quot; Max swore as he gave up hiding it, &quot;I&#39;m sorry babe, I swear, I&#39;m committed and all...it&#39;s just that---well, Neil&#39;s fucking Neil, and I can&#39;t really help it. You---you saw I was---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to be in denial or assume anything,&quot; Clara shut him up and then winked, &quot;We&#39;re pretty far out here, and nobody&#39;s come by so far yet. We have ample time and opportunity to really test the waters of our relationships. You know, they say a healthy bit of swinging never did anyone harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Swinging!?&quot; Matt asked, gulping, the thought of Neil - big, macho, muscular half Korean stud Neil - and Max - the movie star muscle man - fucking so close by got Matt&#39;s engines moving again. After that sexual episode Matt&#39;s denial about his sexual nature had been whittled down significantly. While he didn&#39;t know how to put it, he was more or less bisexual - though to a degree he preferred men. A significant degree, but still. He looked at the two muscle men, then at Clara. Even with that in mind, the idea of fucking her made him jittery. &quot;I-I uhh, would that mean---&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Clara said with an interested smile, &quot;You and me, twinky. Think you can handle it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m built for beauty and sexual fulfillment,&quot; Matt said with a smirk, &quot;Lemme show you how a pretty boy handles his lady friend~!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that means---&quot; Neil said as he looked at Max, suddenly remembering both the ongoing ethnic effect he had induced due to his desire to experiment, and the effect he on average had on men. He thought about it - actively thought about trying to get the chairs switched around, so the speak. But then Max spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Max said, &quot;I&#39;ll be honest. I don&#39;t know if I even can shut it down much longer. I-I want you, man, and I&#39;d really like to just---do what Clara suggested. We can get this out of our system and finish the hike up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing that, Neil more or less lost the fight. He too found Max tremendously attractive, and he was willing to try and see if he could keep Max from changing more. He&#39;d succeeded with Brock, right, Neil rationalized to himself even as his will to go against what his body and mind so obviously wanted was being abraded. <br />
<br />
Max looked Neil over and said, &quot;Now, how about we give my girlfriend a nice show.&quot; The two muscle men promptly started moving off toward the side of the lake. Neil finally letting his hands before long roam over Max&#39;s shoulders and chest, the movie star quivering in delight as he enjoyed the attention. For her part, Clara watched and immediately enjoyed the sight. Much like straight men and their lesbian porn, the idea of two hot men - one of whom was into her - making out like this and even having sex got her going again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoying the sights?&quot; Matt asked, walking over to her, coyly running a hand up his toned stomach, accentuating his manhood.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know I am,&quot; Clara said as she started leading the way in the sexual session with Matt. Making love to Matt would be a different experience to having sex with Max - she knew that. He was softer, leaner, smaller...and he reacted very enthusiastically to her. She didn&#39;t know what was going on with him exactly, but when she kissed his nipple and teased a long moan out of him, she knew this was going to be fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh babe, you know what gets me going! More!&quot; Clara went with it - leading Matt on to the ground and starting to gyrate on top of him as she rubbed one of his nipples and grabbed at the other. Matt for his part squirmed with delight under her, feeling his cock getting erect as could be again. He honestly felt relieved he could get it up for her. It proved to him that some element of what he knew - knew! - to be true remained in him. He could <i>fuck</i> a woman and make her moan.<br />
<br />
Over with the other couple, Max had taken to kissing Neil - and he found it surprisingly enticing. He&#39;d only ever thus far made out with Clara, and now, his tongue entwined with Neil&#39;s, he was enjoying this a lot. &quot;Ohh fuck bro...fuck!&quot; Neil for his part could feel Max getting hard as his hand reached down. Feeling that tight groin and muscle ass, Neil knew he couldn&#39;t help himself much longer. Max was simply too big - too strong - set him off too well.<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Eojjeol su eobne...&quot; Neil murmured to himself, not even registering the casual use of Korean in his speech, and then he grabbed Max with both hands on the ass, intensifying the kiss instantly as he gave up fighting it. The make out became so much more torrid immediately - Max returning the favor and making Neil gasp as the muscled actor kissed him intensely, gripping the back of his head with one hand as the other roamed Neil&#39;s powerfully muscled back.<br />
<br />
Matt and Clara meanwhile had settled into their own torrid session.<br />
<br />
Matt managed to get on top - an odd position for the new Matt to be sure - and after a bit of guiding from Clara had managed to get his cock inside. He was thinner than her last, but the enthusiasm and his softer, prettier nature - plus his eagerness to please - made him a dynamic and surprisingly fulfilling lover. &quot;Ohh fuck, fuck me Matt, thrust harder!&quot; She was almost surprised she was enjoying this as much as she was. There was an element to this of sex with someone on the brink, too.<br />
<br />
She was in the know. He wasn&#39;t. And she knew he was precariously positioned with the changes such that his interest in women was not as strong as his interest in men. But the interest remained - enough to insist and push forward. Matt&#39;s generous ass thrust in the air as he pumped his hips into Clara - her moans and gasps encouraging him ever forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh babe, babe, you got it---mmph!&quot; Matt let out a girlish gasp when she more roughly grabbed at his nipples, &quot;You---you playful vixen! You almost made me jizz!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to know I figured---figured out your sensitive spots!&quot; Clara responded, and let Matt keep going. She was enjoying this - having a man who so eagerly and so obviously responded to such stimuli. She&#39;d never really had sex with someone before who was so vocal. So soft, yet so sexually eager... Matt was a case study in contradictions, and Clara loved it.<br />
<br />
Max didn&#39;t speak Korean, meanwhile, so he didn&#39;t know what to say, &quot;I dunno what that meant, bro,&quot; Max&#39;s tone was heavy and aroused, voice thick with need, &quot;But we gotta---we gotta fuck.&quot; His body was really starting to sweat from this. Just hearing Clara and Matt going at it over there made him even more excited to get this going with Neil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me on top or you...?&quot; Neil asked blearily, between kisses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither, frottage for the win,&quot; Max answered, and before long, the denuded men started in at a rhythm, rubbing their dicks upon one another. Max, who had never really done anything like it, grinned like a fool and thrust as much as he could. Neil, having a surprisingly deep amount of experience with men and women both, led the way adeptly well. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool it...calm, calm, thrust as you want, but we gotta---we gotta keep em together---&quot; Neil stated, his Korean accent slipping through a bit as he noticed something going on. He swore he thought he&#39;d done things better, but he guessed frottage wasn&#39;t one of the things that exempted a change. Not like Neil was about to stop for anything - he was far too turned on at this point.<br />
<br />
Max was changing, and it turned Neil on so much to see it happening...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Matt and Clara were nearing the climax of their episode of sexuality. <br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s muscular glutes flexed as he thrust as deep as he could go. Clara hit orgasm once or twice already, and seeing Matt&#39;s sweat covered, quivering and only barely restrained form made her feel like going for a third. He was really pushing himself physically as much as he could. She could see his nipples standing up on his chest, his stylized and soft hair stained with sweat. His teeth were grit between words, &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m gonna---gonna cum soon, Clara babe...mmph...fuck, can&#39;t---ohhh, I can&#39;t stop myself~!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum on then, pretty boy---!&quot; Clara urged him on...<br />
<br />
And Neil, for his part, was enjoying his part in this despite his misgivings.<br />
<br />
He could see Max&#39;s biceps, already well muscled, growing a bit more, becoming truly powerfully built - a true bodybuilder-actor in the vein of Sly and Arnold. He could feel, as his arm touched Max&#39;s shoulder, the separation of the delt growing and the muscular development getting crazy there. He could just see the headlines about Max&#39;s crazy shoulders. It turned Neil on more when his hand reached down, feeling Max&#39;s chest pump up a bit more and his abs etch slightly tighter.<br />
<br />
Fuck, Neil was gonna cum - even as he was sure Max was getting pretty close there himself. The muscular actor was huffing, gasping, almost quaking as the two of them thrust upon one another - fuck, Neil could feel Max&#39;s dick get a little bigger even as it started toward orgasm. And he could see Max&#39;s tan slightly deepen, in line with the kind of tanned look common among a certain type of actor.<br />
<br />
Max for his part was subject to yet more mental changes as he was pushed one step further along the spectrum of sexuality. He found himself really, really enjoying the sex with Neil - looking forward to another time with him actively. And memories, strange memories indeed, of his new past. Initially people were leery of him - rumors spread of him being a star in gay adult films, and while he had in fact done such films, his talent presented well indeed. Making even the most judgemental of directors look more favorably upon him.<br />
<br />
Max&#39;s new experience left him capable enough to manage to slow his orgasm just enough to mostly synchronize with Neil&#39;s. The mixed race young man grunted, groaned, and let out a loud, long shout in time with his orgasm. Max was not that far behind him, their cum staining their stomaches and some of it getting up on their chests. <br />
<br />
Over with Matt and Clara, the former jock thrust one final time and orgasm started - Matt paused mid-thrust, no longer able to help himself. Clara gasped under him - he hoped she was having fun - and he could feel his sphincter clench, his body quaking with the sheer weight of the pleasure he was feeling. He felt validated, he felt pleased and appeased - and fuck he felt good. Matt&#39;s emission was met with him almost screaming with pleasure - he and Clara both rode out the orgasm. Feeling Matt almost collapse on top of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were great, Matt,&quot; Clara moaned, feeling him up.<br />
<br />
Neil for his part immediately found himself wondering what happened with him let alone Max. He realized for his part that it seemed he&#39;d changed Max - and he had no idea yet if he himself had changed in the process. If he&#39;d kept going on that ethnic change, or if something else had started to happen. The denuded bodybuilder swayed a bit on his feet - two consecutive sexual episodes had him a bit worn out. But he before long eased his legs back into working condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...fuck, sorry about that, man,&quot; Neil murmured as he realized Max likely hadn&#39;t counted on changing again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Max got up shortly after himself, realizing something was up, &quot;When did---when did you start progressing changes through sex? Not really complaining right now. Fuck I got jacked through that, I think that&#39;s all...I think...&quot; Max shook his head, &quot;Maybe something about my past? I dunno.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew, you boys really gave us quite the fucking soundtrack to enjoy ourselves too!&quot; Clara got up before long, Matt beaming by her side. Just looking at Max and Neil - resplendent after their session - reaffirmed Matt&#39;s new sense of his sexuality to himself. Even now he felt a sense of attraction to them. Though he wouldn&#39;t deny that Clara was a very fulfilling lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Matt said, &quot;Really got me going. Fuck! You two really went at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neil by then had retrieved his shorts and went to look at his phone. To both check his reflection / pictures, and see what went on with the changes just then. &quot;Thanks, man,&quot; Neil said as he started looking at the pictures...</p>
