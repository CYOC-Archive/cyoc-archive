<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At last the Blonde&#39;s continuing pushing won out, and Ken walked, or was pushed toward the huge slot machine setting center stage in the middle of the Casino. The usual crowd of those curious, or who just could afford tossing a $100 bucks per spin stood by and watched as others who could tried their luck.<br />
<br />
Ken came to stand with the pushy Blonde, she nagging him to play; but he wanted to watch those ahead and see if there be something not quite right. He noted his Blonde bimbo companion waving a hand at the bartender man, as if she wanted to order a drink. As minutes later a waiter approached the Blonde, he holding a tray with two tumbler size glasses of iced golden liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;I ordered us some liquid refreshments,&quot; the half inebriated, as drunk bimbo said to Ken.<br />
<br />
Indeed, as Ken rather expected of her to order him a round of some form strong drink. As she gifted the waiter one of Ken&#39;s  won Casino chips as a tip; Ken reached across and he took her lighter colored drink, just as she then took the darker golden colored glass. <br />
<br />
When Ken took his first sip he realized the Bimbo had ordered for her an iced Ginger Ale soda, while she drank a gulp of what would then be as his; and Ken noticed by her surprised expression as she swallowed the mixed drink that it was quite stout.<br />
<br />
Ken knew that drunks don&#39;t have good and clear thoughts when playing casino games, or when driving a vehicle!<br />
<br />
Ken played along, he sipping at his drink, while wanting to keep his mind clear of booze, and able to think as watch what was happening. A Lady dressed in silvery long gown and drenched with jewelry, she stepped up to the slot machine just then. She held the oversized $100 dollar chip and inserted it into the slot. A hearty pull down of the oversized pull arm sent the machine tumbling the three frames of little pictures.<br />
<br />
As lights flashed, the machine played the theme song to the TV show &quot;Jeopardy&quot; as odd to erotic, suggestive little pictures spun away. Click, click, click, and a big gong bonged as three little picture lined up, showed then three nanny goats with oversized udders. <br />
<br />
A noisy rattling sound came from the machine just as from the winner&#39;s chute came out a long leather strap, and attached to it was a collar with a silver bell attached.<br />
<br />
The half drunken lady picked up her small prize and began then loudly grumbling that she&#39;d been had, taken, as she walked away toward the bar.<br />
<br />
Next came a tall man with a western type hat, he looked like some cattle baron of the old west. He too put in his large token and harshly slammed down the big pull arm making the machine to spin the rollers and sing. Click, click, click, went the machine as from the payout slot came a near ton of thousand dollar chips. He was a big winner that hour and had gained his big luck story. A pair of sexy clad Zebra skin dressed dollies then raked up the spilled winnings for the slot machine&#39;s big winner. As all there then cheered when counted total was announced, as the Texan had won $225,000 of the possible one million dollars allotted inside the machine.<br />
<br />
Jumping up and down in her five inch spike high heels, Ken&#39;s Blonde was getting quite drunk on the drink Ken was supposed to have drank. He looked at her face, seeing not her blue eyes, but both seemed to have changed their hue to match the color of her drink. Ken then handed her his one big token for her to play.<br />
<br />
As she stepped forward to play the slot machine, she handed her almost gone drink and glass to the security man standing to the right side of the machine. In went the token and with a sadly weak as drunken pull of the machine&#39;s lever arm she watched the pictures turn very slowly.<br />
<br />
Click,....click,.....click, went the machine as the little pictures spun slowly and locked one by one into place.<br />
<br />
The Blonde stared with an expression of dismay at the pictures she likely saw with blurred vision; forcing her to step close to the machine and tilt her head as she gazed through watery eyes.<br />
<br />
There before her were three small pictures of Carrot.<br />
<br />
Then from the pay slot came a rattling sound as she put out her petite, as greedy hands for the welcomed payout.<br />
<br />
Rattle, rattle, and plop into her hands was a silver chain necklace and hung on the middle a six inch large gold Carrot. She looked up at the security guard there by the machine, and then to gawking at Ken; she began to yell, exclaiming she&#39;d been had! <br />
Ken smiled, and said reminding her it was his $100 bucks, and with her the winner; he turned and walked away leaving her crying about the cheap prize. Walking away Ken heard the machine played again but this time when the numbers came up the prize winner, a too young, maybe teenage girl was with her winnings rushed off by the guard.<br />
<br />
Tired of his Ginger Ale drink, Ken went to the bar and asked for a draft beer. The Bartender looked at him in strange face then told him that he&#39;d have to go to the Satyr Club to get those brand of drinks. He tossed Ken a menu of drinks he&#39;d make and stated that in the Casino&#39;s Bar we serve mature people!<br />
<br />
Ken reciprocated and ordered a Brandy-Manhattan and sat there sipping his drink and munching on the free pretzels.<br />
<br />
Soon after, and from the far end of the long Walnut bar came the scream of a woman. She cursing at the bartender,  was sounding very angry about something, as maybe she&#39;d spilled her drink?<br />
<br />
A security Guard came quickly as just as Ken stood up and began to walk with his drink in hand, along bar just to see what was happening. Oddly there was not a crowd about to see or watch her, instead the Guard was cuffing the lady with her arms behind her back as he had her lying face down on the floor.<br />
<br />
Ken remembered the gown of that lady who won the leather strap and its small medallion back at the big slot machine. He wondered if it was the strong drinks she consumed, but that of what he saw, her legs which stuck out from under the gown looked quite hairy. Her shoes she in the struggling had kicked off, showing her shaggy legs and also hair covered feet ending in what looked like black toes.<br />
<br />
The Guard rolled her face to face up as the lady continued to yell about her condition. Ken looked at the angry lady, her hair which was a dark red, had streaks of gray and white lines; her eyebrows hard grown together making one brow, but colored differently as a dark shade of gray. Her nose too, appeared as turned up to showing more nostril as her lips were red with lipstick before, but had a darker look, almost as if then black. Even her face looked like she needed a shave as the gray and black hairs were sprouting all about her cheeks and chin.<br />
<br />
Ken tried to ask the Guard what was her problem, but he got pushed away.<br />
<br />
Picking the lady up to standing as best she could, the Guard pushed her through a steel door nearer the far end of the bar. As Ken stood there the screaming woman yelled for help from anybody. Her facial expression was of or if knowing after the door closed behind her, she was doomed. The Guard leaving the Casino Bar then as a quite place to drink once more.</p>
