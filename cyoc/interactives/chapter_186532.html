<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well I had better start taking you off. It&#39;s going to take a while and I will want to get something to eat before I go to bed&quot; Matthew felt 3 strong cramps in her right hand<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Kim. I&#39;m starting to get hungry already. I haven&#39;t had anything to eat since we got here, other than your mint&quot; Matthew reached for the side of her neck trying to feel the seam where the last piece of the skin suit had sealed over. All she felt was smoothness.<br />
<br />
She went to the bathroom and in the mirror searched for the seam. It wasn&#39;t there. She began examining other parts of her head and her neck. No seam could be found anywhere. She stripped out of the dress and examined her back then her arms and legs. All she could find was Kim&#39;s skin.<br />
<br />
Matthew had an idea &quot;Kim can you point to wear the seam is? How do I start getting you off?&quot; Once more she felt 3 strong cramps in her right hand<br />
<br />
&quot;Kim I&#39;m serious. I need to take you off&quot; again she felt 3 strong cramps<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean? Do you know how I get you off&quot; a single cramp<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you tell me?&quot; a single cramp<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you tell me?&quot; three cramps<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Kim. This isn&#39;t fair. How am I going to get a feed&quot; a single cramp in her left hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;I need to point&quot; she stuck her finger at the mirror seeing the girl just in a bra and panties in the reflection, then began to turn around. She felt a cramp when she was pointing at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll see what you want&quot; Matthew walked into the other room stood in the middle and began the pointing and turning once more. She felt the cramp when she was pointing to the table where they had been sitting earlier. Matthew pointed directly at the table and felt another cramp. &quot;Was it something you read?&quot; again a single cramp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I&#39;ll point through the brochure&quot; 3 cramps<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the brochure?&quot; One cramp.<br />
<br />
&quot;What then? The information book?&quot; one cramp. That was the booklet Matthew had looked through earlier when trying to find directions on how to operate the transformation machine. She picked it up. &quot;I&#39;ll leaf through the pages. Tell me when to stop&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt a cramp when the very first page was open. Matthew looked at the page. It was a list of activities for the coming week. <br />
<br />
Matthew began to point at the list. By now she guessed what Kim was after. She wasn&#39;t surprised when she felt a cramp as she pointed at the item for tonight. &#39;Island party. Pool deck. 7 pm&#39;. &quot;You want to go to the island party?&quot; 1 cramp.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you won&#39;t let me take you off until we have been to this party?&quot; 1 cramp. <br />
<br />
&quot;And will you let me take you off if I take you there&quot; 2 cramps.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that means you don&#39;t know?&quot; 1 cramp<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t know whether you will allow me to take you off. What does that mean? Do I have to do something else?&quot; I cramp. Then a cramp in the left hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Here we go again&quot; Matthew pointed. He was directed back to the bedroom. &quot;I gather I need to get dressed once more&quot; 1 cramp.<br />
<br />
Matthew picked up the white dress which was on the floor and began to put it on. He felt three cramps. &quot;What now?&quot; a cramp in her left hand. She pointed. Back to the wardrobe. Matthew began to point again. She felt the cramp when she was pointing at drawer Matthew had put Kim&#39;s lingerie in. &quot;Really?&quot; 1 cramp.<br />
<br />
Matthew had no choice. If she wanted to get out of Kim&#39;s skin and regain her old male form, she had to obey Kim&#39;s directions. And Kim was now pretty clear in those directions. She had to take off the white bra and panties she had been wearing and replace them with a lacy, blue set. The bra was a bit tighter then the white bra had been. Matthew realised it must have been some sort of push-up bra. Certainly her cleavage was enhanced. <br />
<br />
Next it was a pair of black pantyhose, previously unopened. They turned out to be a see-through black. Then Matthew was directed to the royal blue dress he so appreciated Kim wearing. He knew how hot his current body looked in that dress, but if he wanted to get out of this body he had to comply. <br />
<br />
She struggled to do up the zip at the back, appreciating why Kim would ask for his help. The dress was rather body hugging and showed off the cleavage the push up bra had created. Eventually with manipulation of her shoulders and hands she got the zip up.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t surprised when she was directed to Kim&#39;s make-up bag.  Matthew warned her &quot;I don&#39;t know how to do this&quot; Fortunately she only wanted Matthew to apply red lipstick. Matthew suspected she didn&#39;t trust him with not making her body look clownish. Matthew was very careful with her lipstick tube. She applied it slowly and carefully. She actually did a pretty good job<br />
<br />
She was then instructed to brush Kim&#39;s hair and once more apply Kim&#39;s perfume. This time a quick spray on her wrists was not enough. She had to also spray her underarms and neck. Matthew feared she had overdone it.<br />
<br />
Then she was directed to Kim&#39;s jewellery box and given the task of putting earrings into her now pierced ears. They were a gift Matthew had given Kim for her birthday. He also had to put a opal necklace on and a bangle on each wrist.<br />
<br />
Then there were shoes Kim wanted her to wear. Black shoes with 2 inch heels. She wouldn&#39;t take no for an answer. Matthew gave in and tried them on. She was amazed she could walk in them reasonable well. Was Kim somehow helping him?<br />
<br />
Lastly she was directed to Kim&#39;s handbag. Matthew appreciated the need. There were no pockets on the dress. Finally she got the single cramp answer to her question &quot;Are we ready now&quot;</p>
