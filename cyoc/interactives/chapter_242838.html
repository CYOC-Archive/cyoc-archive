<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As I stepped out of my patrol car putting on the sternest face I could muster. The speeder was man in his mid-thirties, gripping the steering wheel tightly, clearly angry. I smirked. It gave me a rush to ruin people&#39;s days. I approached his window and asked for his license and registration. Everything seemed normal until, suddenly, the world shifted around me.<br />
<br />
I shivered slightly, a strange sensation washing over me. My uniform felt odd, the way my bra dug into my shoulders felt unfamiliar. The way my underwear cupped my vulva seemed novel. I glanced down at my uniform, hugging my curves perfectly, highlighting my massive breasts. For that instant, everything felt wrong—my hair, my breasts, even my pussy—but that moment passed quickly, and I felt entirely normal. I didn&#39;t dwell on the strange sensation, attributing it to a momentary weird feeling.<br />
<br />
The man handed me his documents, his eyes flickering over my body before meeting my gaze. I could see the nervousness in his eyes, and I couldn&#39;t help but feel a sense of satisfaction. I was in control here, and I knew it.<br />
<br />
I took the documents from him, my fingers brushing against his for a moment longer than necessary. I could see the effect I had on him. I always loved to torture men with my body, making them feel small and aroused.<br />
<br />
I walked back to my patrol car, exaggerating the sway of my hips with each step, letting him get worked up so I could send him on his way frustrated. I walked back to his car and I could feel his eyes on me and I couldn&#39;t help but smile. I handed him the ticket, my fingers brushing against his once more. &quot;Here&#39;s your ticket,&quot; I said, my voice a low purr. &quot;Pay it within 30 days.&quot;<br />
<br />
But as I turned to walk away, I felt a sudden, overwhelming desire to be with him. I stopped in my tracks, my body turning back towards his car. I could see the arousal in his eyes. I wanted him, and I was going to have him.<br />
<br />
I opened the door and slid into the passenger seat. My body pressing against his as I kissed him deeply. I was in control here, and I was going to take what I wanted.<br />
<br />
I broke the kiss, my eyes locking onto his as I slowly unbuttoned my shirt, revealing my ample cleavage. I pushed him back against the seat, my hands deftly unbuckling his belt and pants. He gasped as I took him in my hand, then lowered my mouth onto his rod, tasting his musky scent, circling the tip with my tongue. He moaned. I needed him inside me. <br />
<br />
I straddled him, my body pressing against his as I ground against him, my wetness soaking through the thin fabric of my thong. I could feel his desire, and it only fueled my own. I leaned down, my breasts pressing against his chest as I whispered in his ear, &quot;I want you. Right here, right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t wait for a response. I pushed away slightly, giving him room to undress me. He started with my shirt. His hands roamed over my body, cupping my large breasts, squeezing and kneading them as I moaned in pleasure. I could feel his desire growing, and it only turned me on more.<br />
<br />
I moved my hands to my pants, unbuttoning them and pushing them down my hips and off my body, leaving me in just my thong. I could see the desire in his eyes as he took in my bushy public hair, my wet and glistening pussy. I grasped my thong and pulled it down, revealing myself to him completely.<br />
<br />
He pulled me down onto his lap, his cock pressing against my wet folds, gasping as he filled me completely. I rode him, my hips grinding against his, taking him deeper and deeper with each stroke. I could feel my orgasm building, my body convulsing as I climaxed.<br />
<br />
He followed soon after, his body shaking as he released deep inside me. I collapsed on top of him, our bodies slick with sweat, our breaths coming in ragged gasps. I could feel his heart pounding in his chest, and I knew that I had made the right decision.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s your only warning,&quot; I told him as he slipped out of me. I could feel his spunk dripping out of my vulva, mixing with my own arousal, and my panties were soaked. I quickly dressed, my hands shaking slightly as I buttoned my shirt and pulled up my pants. I could still feel the wetness between my legs, a constant reminder of what had just happened. As I walked back to my car I mentally made a note that I had to fuck two more strangers today. Wait. What? Yes. That was my personal rule. Three strangers get fucked every day. <br />
<br />
As I pulled back onto the road, I could still feel the remnants of our encounter lingering on my body. His sperm was drying on my labia, a sticky reminder of what had just transpired. The sensation was both familiar and arousing, making me sigh. I should probably wash up but there was something so erotic about knowing the secret dirtiness hidden away beneath my crisp uniform.</p>
