<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You don&#39;t know how long it&#39;s been since your plight began, as keeping track of time was kind of impossible in your state. True to their word, the daughters of the wolf, the orange fox girl and the lilac jackal, began to visit you in regular intervals, the fox girl to play with you and the jackal to &quot;play&quot; with you. It&#39;s safe to say that the constant bounding between pure innocence and wild maturity has put a strain on your mind, as you could barely bring yourself to react to anything at the moment.<br />
<br />
But you began to be able to cope, in a few ways. That body of yours doesn&#39;t really do things like sleeping, meaning that you were left alone with your thoughts and undying lust at all times that you were alone, which was most of the time. With nothing else to do except bask in your ever-growing lust, your mind sort of zones out. For the long, empty periods of time you’re alone, you cease to think. Your body grew still, your eyes glazed over, and you became inert, nothing more than an object, a toy to be used that came to life only when someone used it.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t a miserable existence. It was barely an existence at all. But there was nothing else to do. Somewhere within the amount of time that you spent in that pool room, being used as nothing but a playground and a sex toy, you abandon the idea of escape. You accept that this new existence is your life, and nothing could change that. You were nothing but a toy. And then things changed.<br />
<br />
You have no idea how it happened. But standing in front of you in the blank space of your mind was that stupid-looking duck that changed you into what you are now. In a silly, Donald-Duck-esque voice, the shiny black duck smiles and says, &quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
In response, you give the mental equivalent of a startled squeak. The duck tilts its head. &quot;You&#39;re surprised?&quot; it questions. Of course you&#39;re surprised! How else would you react when the creature that took over and changed your body into some kind of weird furry suddenly appeared in your head?! The duck nods. &quot;I guess that would be surprising,&quot; it admits.<br />
<br />
You pause. Did that duck just read your thoughts? &quot;Yeah, I did,&quot; the duck responds, frowning a bit. You noticed that it had placed its wing-like hands on what you&#39;re pretty sure are its hips in an impatient motion. It didn&#39;t seem like it was here to just chat.<br />
<br />
The duck nods again. &quot;You&#39;re pretty quick on the uptake,&quot; it points out. &quot;I&#39;m not here to talk.&quot; The duck pauses and sheepishly rubs its bald head. &quot;I&#39;m here to explain my actions, and to apologize for my rashness,&quot; it continues.<br />
<br />
You give the mental equivalent of a wary squint. Apologize? Why did this rubber creature want to apologize to you?<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to apologize because none of this was meant to happen,&quot; the duck says, bowing its head slightly. You return the duck’s previous head tilt with the mental equivalent of your own. The duck holds up a wing before you can continue to extrapolate and says, &quot;Let me explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The night that you discovered... well, us,&quot; the duck begins, gesturing to his rubber body to indicate the rubber creatures, &quot;I actually spotted you following the wolf, who is our pack leader, back to the mansion. I saw you look through the window and watch the transformation and everything. Once you saw that, your fate would be sealed. You would become another one of us, whether you wanted to or not.&quot; The duck nervously rubbed its head again before continuing. &quot;So, I kinda followed you home without you noticing?&quot;<br />
<br />
At this, you give the mental equivalent of a frown. Sure, you were distracted that night, but not so distracted that you wouldn&#39;t be able to notice the loud and awkward flops of a rubber duck creature trying its best to sneak up behind you. The duck shook its head. &quot;That&#39;s exactly how distracted you were,&quot; it points out. &quot;Do you think I would&#39;ve had a chance to get there ahead of you otherwise?&quot; The duck had a point.<br />
<br />
The duck continues. &quot;So there I sat, waiting on your porch for you to get there, when suddenly something hit me right between the eyes! I got so disoriented that my body fell apart.&quot; The duck pauses and tilts its head. &quot;I don&#39;t remember what happened next, but when I came to, I was shut in a dark room.&quot; You slowly nod, mentally of course. That must&#39;ve been your closet. The duck paused at that. &quot;Wait, you were the one that put me in there?&quot; it asks incredulously. You give the mental equivalent of a shrug. What else were you supposed to do when a rubber suit that looked like one of the creatures that suddenly drops unconscious on your porch?<br />
<br />
The duck frowns but continues. &quot;Eventually, the room opened, so I got out of there as quickly as I could. Somehow, I ended up tangled up on you body, and I panicked.&quot; The duck&#39;s frown seems to deepen as it continues. &quot;And then I sensed him: the wolf. That&#39;s when I struggled even harder to get onto you.&quot; The duck pauses and stares into your mental eyes earnestly. &quot;I just wanted to protect you,&quot; the duck says.<br />
<br />
This gave you pause. Protect you? Why? &quot;Two reasons,&quot; the duck says, holding up two finger-like feathers. &quot;One, you involved yourself in something that you had no idea about. Most of us rubber creatures were human once, you know, but few of us actually retain our memory past the transformation.&quot; The duck pauses, then takes a deep breath. &quot;Two,&quot; it continues, &quot;The wolf must be usurped.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave the mental equivalent of stunned silence. Usurped? That&#39;s a weird choice of wording. To usurp is to dethrone, to take someone and strip them of their power. And this creature is suggesting that this is supposed to be done to the wolf? The wolf that forced you into the form that you were? That wolf? No, that&#39;s impossible. Besides, who would even do something as crazy as that? The duck gives you a grin and says, &quot;Well, who else but you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Another round of mental silence. This duck must be joking. &quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; the duck affirms, crossing its wing-like arms and frowning slightly. &quot;You&#39;re the only one who can do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
This time, you give the mental equivalent of a wary squint, pointing it directly at the duck. &quot;Let me explain,&quot; the duck sighs. &quot;You saw what happened on the first night you, er, met us creatures, right?&quot; You give the mental of the equivalence of a nod. You can recall that night in vivid detail, from the part where the wolf melted over that helpless man and turned him into that feline blue rubber cat, to the part where a teenager got dumped into the pool that&#39;s currently next to you and emerged as a red rubber panther, to the part where you bludgeoned a rubber creature from a long distance because it was a freaking duck, of all things. &quot;Wait, you&#39;re the one who hit me with a rock?!&quot; the duck blurted. You gave it the mental equivalent of a glare. You had the right to protect yourself from freaky supernatural furries.<br />
<br />
The duck shakes his head and says, &quot;Nevermind. The point is that you didn&#39;t get gooped by the wolf or dumped into the pool to be transformed, which means that you&#39;re different from every other rubber creature in this mansion.&quot; The duck points in your general direction. &quot;You aren&#39;t forced to obey the wolf&#39;s will.&quot;<br />
<br />
You frown. What was that supposed to mean? &quot;It means you have free will,&quot; the duck explains, a kind of wistful look coming into its eyes. &quot;You can go where you want to go, do what you want to do, and be what you want to be without anyone telling you to do so.&quot; The duck sighs and looks down at his wings. &quot;No other creature in this mansion can do that because the wolf made them,&quot; the duck says sadly. &quot;All of us are forced to follow his whims and wills.&quot; You remain silent for a moment, thinking on your own current existence, stuck as a toy for the pleasure of the daughters of the wolf. Had the duck experienced this, too? The duck gave you a rueful smile. &quot;Yep,&quot; it confirms. &quot;It&#39;s crazy what the wolf can do to you for speaking out against his ways even once.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause once more. You have questions. &quot;Go ahead and ask,&quot; the duck says, glancing down at its arm. &quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay then. First question: if the duck didn&#39;t have free will, how was he helping you at all? The duck smiled. &quot;Straight to the point,&quot; the duck comments. &quot;Smart.&quot; The duck pauses for a bit, as if trying to figure out how to explain his story, then continues. &quot;There are times when the wolf&#39;s will can be circumvented,&quot; it says. &quot;The night you encountered us was one of them. That night was the night of the hunt.&quot;<br />
<br />
The duck&#39;s eyes grow a bit cloudy. &quot;On the night of the hunt, all of us rubber creatures leave the mansion and do, well, whatever,&quot; it continues. &quot;The wolf has no control of our actions on that night, so we can do anything at all until sunrise.&quot; The duck shrugs and glances down at its arms for a moment. &quot;It just happens that I got sick of the whole pack that night, and I needed a break. You just happened to be in the vicinity of the first conversion, and I just happened to see you because of it, so I decided to protect you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod slowly. Whether you like or not, you&#39;re starting to feel bad for the duck. But, second question: if free will was such a scarce thing, how was the duck even able to talk to you? At this the duck pauses. &quot;I... don&#39;t know,&quot; it duck admits. &quot;I think the wolf thought that I was trying to goop you, but I failed.&quot; The duck sighs and glances down at its arms. &quot;He always gloated about weak I was compared to the rest of the pack.&quot; The duck glances around itself and says, &quot;And as for this whole talking to you in your mind thing, no idea.&quot; The duck then looks you directly in the eyes and says, &quot;I don&#39;t think any of this was supposed to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, what was that supposed to mean? &quot;Usually, the only contact that us rubber creatures have with humans is when we&#39;re converting them,&quot; the duck explains. &quot;I don&#39;t think any of us have tried to cover a human before.&quot; The duck pauses again. &quot;This is something entirely new to both of our species,&quot; it murmured, almost to itself.<br />
<br />
Final question: how the hell were you supposed to beat the wolf?! The duck glances down at its hands and shrugs. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the duck admits. &quot;But I do know one thing. You can be whatever you want to be because you have free will, and for rubber creatures, that&#39;s usually literal.&quot;<br />
<br />
The duck glances down at its arms again and winces. You give it the mental equivalent of a frown. Why did it keep doing that?<br />
<br />
The duck stares at you for a moment, then holds up its arms at you. Or at least, what left of them. &quot;Uh,&quot; the duck says, &quot;Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but I think we&#39;re fusing.&quot; You pause. Fusing? Like, fusion-haaaaaa fusing?<br />
<br />
&quot;No, like my body&#39;s about become yours fusing,&quot; the duck corrects you. &quot;I think I&#39;m about to cease existing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. This duck is surprisingly calm about its disappearing.<br />
<br />
The duck sighs. &quot;Just promise that you&#39;ll try to take out the wolf, okay?&quot; the duck sighs as its legs dissolve into nothing. &quot;That&#39;s all I&#39;d ever want.&quot;<br />
<br />
You pause. Were you really going to accept this insane death wish of a dying wish? The duck says nothing, but stares earnestly at your eyes. You give the mental equivalent of a sigh. Fine, you promise. The duck gives you a beaming grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks,&quot; the duck says, left with nothing but its head now. &quot;Also, you&#39;ve got two guests. That lilac jackal and that pink rabbit.&quot; The duck mimes tipping a hat at you, then says, &quot;Good luck.&quot; And with that, the duck disappears.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you&#39;re shot back to the boiling expanse of lust that you mind had become. It&#39;s such a sudden shift in experience that you actually feel a little exhausted. What just happened? What was that? And how did it seal out all of that lust? In the real world, your eyes focus, only to see your two nightly tormentors in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are,&quot; the jackal purrs, licking her lips like the predator she was. &quot;I was starting to think we lost you forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh goody!&quot; the rabbit chirps, her wild eyes sparkling with lust and excitement. &quot;It&#39;s so much better when you&#39;re awake!&quot;<br />
<br />
For the first time in a long time, you actually feel something other than lust. This feeling... it was... pity. You have no idea where it came from, but it shines like a beacon in your mind, forcing back the fog of lust that clouded it. You feet... awake.<br />
<br />
And then the two rubber creatures descend upon you. This was going to be a long night.</p>
