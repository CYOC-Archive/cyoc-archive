<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Axel! Breakfast is ready!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Mom! I'll be down in a second!&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel Kaiser quickly shut down his computer and walked over to the dresser. He changed out of his pajamas and into his usual outfit of <br />
a T-shirt and a pair of jeans. After buttoning the strap of his tail hole, Axel checked the full-length mirror in his room to check that <br />
evrything was good. His head fur was a little scruffy, but he liked it that way.<br />
<br />
He took a moment to admire his reflection. He was a 5'10&quot; weasel/raccoon hybrid. He was considered hot by all the furry girls in his <br />
class, and even some of the humans. His face, arms, and legs were those of a raccoon, but his body and tail were those of a weasel. <br />
His coloration was that of a raccoon as well, but his tail was solid grey instead of striped. His eyes were a glowing neon green as were <br />
his tongue, paws, and even his dick. The doctors had said it was a slight gene mutation with no other side effects. But Axel knew that <br />
wasn't true.<br />
<br />
Axel went downstairs to the kitchen to find that his dad hadn't left yet. His mom was the one who stayed at home, while his dad worked <br />
for VexCo Nuclear Technologies in Foresttown, Kentucky about 20 minutes away. Axel's mom, Adrianna, was a raccoon and was the <br />
most important person in his life. Kevin wasn't really his father, he was his mother's second husband and a human. Axel's real father <br />
was a weasel, but he had left Adrianna when he'd found out he'd gotten her pregnant. When Axel's mother met Kevin, he stepped right <br />
into the role of fathering the young weaselcoon and the two were now best friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad, what're you still doing here? Aren't you going to be late for work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now how can I leave without wishing my Axel a happy birthday?&quot; the bearded man asked.<br />
<br />
That was one thing Axel thought was cool about humans. They could do thousands of things with their hair whereas furries only had the <br />
choice to comb it or leave it wild. Kevin had a nice thick beard and moustache that covered his pale face with curly brown hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down and eat your breakfast,&quot; his mom said, &quot;Then you can open your present before Kevin goes to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
After a special breakfast of homemade chocolate chip pancakes, Axel got to open a present from his mom and Kevin. Inside was a <br />
Transtongue, a special device that allowed furries to communicate with animals. It had been developed by a Swedish inventor in 2053, <br />
but it was very rare for regular civilians to own one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! This must have cost a fortune! You didn't have to get me this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I got it from work. A new set of Transtongues came in and they were giving away the old ones,&quot; Kevin explained, &quot;I got this for <br />
almost nothing!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's an old model, but since you aren't using it for scientific experiments, I figured that'd be fine by you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! This is the best present ever!&quot; Axel excalimed and hugged his parents, &quot;I love you guys!&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel started playing around with the machine and reading the instructions. Kevin had to leave for work and wished Axel a happy <br />
birthday. Axel spent the next half hour before school talking to the family cat. It was amazing what Jack had to say.<br />
<br />
{...so that's why I spend most of the day sleeping,} he finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;Axel! The bus will be here soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
He set the Transtongue up on the TV stand, where it would be safe, then, grabbing his bookbag and giving his mom a hug, went out to <br />
wait for the bus.<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Axel's highschool was pretty even between humans and furries. He walked to the back of the bus with the rest of his friends. Most of <br />
the 11th and 12th graders drove to school, but the 10th graders still rode the bus. The back of the bus was &quot;reserved&quot; for the older kids. <br />
Forresttown's highschool also included the 7th and 8th grades. They were expected to stay up front. Even some of the 9th graders <br />
weren't welcome in the back. <br />
<br />
Axel didn't mind who sat by him, he easily befriended everyone; but it was better not to stir things up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Happy Birthday, Axel!&quot; the tiger twins Jackie and Jamie Striker greeted him. They were the two hottest girls in the grade, but it was well <br />
known that their father chased away any boy who tried to go out with one of them. Axel was their friend though, and Mr. Striker trusted <br />
him since they were neighbors. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, guys!&quot; he waved back. <br />
<br />
He took the seat behind them and they talked until Axel's friend, Dan Schulz, got on. Dan was a grey wolf and also the richest kid in <br />
Forresttown. His father owned Schulz Industries which manufactured a wide variety of machine parts and provided jobs to most of <br />
Forresttown along with VexCo. Dan took the seat across from Axel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Axel! Happy Birthday!&quot; he greeted. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dude!&quot; Axel returned, &quot;Guess what my parents got me for my birthday!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know, a bike?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, way cooler. A Transtongue!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! Those things cost a small fortune! Even my dad won't buy me one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;VexCo was getting rid of their old ones to make room for a new set, so Kevin got it for almost nothing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweet!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two continued to talk until they got to school. Inside, they were joined by Jason Johnson, JJ, their human friend. JJ was the &quot;poor <br />
kid&quot; of the grade. His mother had died giving birth to his sister who had died as well. His dad worked at an auto parts store and his <br />
older brother was away at college. But even so, JJ was just about the cheeriest person you'd ever meet. He was determined to go to <br />
college and become a pastor so that he could help others and spread the word of God. <br />
<br />
The trio of friends carried on their conversation until the bell rang for first period. <br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
First period was Axel's least favorite. Even though history was one of his favorite subjects, Mr. Bueler was possibly the worst teacher <br />
ever. He was old, boring, and mean. He went over the most useless historical facts and completely skipped interesting things like wars <br />
and inventions. Those that didn't sleep through his class were awfully tempted to. <br />
<br />
Axel was mad that he got Mr. Bueller for history. One of his favorite classes was being ruined by some old, cranky stick-in-the-mud. He <br />
wished he could do something about it. <br />
<br />
Well, actually he could. You see, at an early age, Axel had found that he had the power of mind control. That's why his body glowed <br />
green in certain places. If Axel touched a person with his paws or looked straight into their eyes with his green ones, he could <br />
command them to do anything. He hadn't tried it with his &quot;other part&quot; yet, but he figured that's why it glowed green, too.<br />
<br />
His power didn't make them act all zombie-like, it sort of twisted their judgement. When a bully had stolen his books in 7th grade, he'd <br />
ordered him to give them back. All of a sudden, the bully tossed them back seeming uninterested.<br />
<br />
But even with a more flowing power, it would be too conspicuous to make Mr. Bueller nicer and teach more interesting material. So Axel <br />
had to suffer through a half hour of &quot;Why the Pioneers Used Oxen Over Horses.&quot;<br />
_____________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Second period was gym. It was Axel's favorite time of the day. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, the gym was used by two classes at once <br />
with a raisable divider down the middle. These days also happened to be days when they played fun games. Evryone made sure they <br />
used the bathroom beforehand so they wouldn't have to go during the game. At precisely 8:55, Axel asked to go to the bathroom. He <br />
used his power to make the teacher allow him to stay there however long he wanted. When he entered the bathroom, he heard a knock <br />
on the door leading to the hallway.<br />
<br />
Students that didn't have gym weren't supposed to use the locker rooms. But the doors were unlocked on the inside. Axel opened the <br />
door to find Matt Stock. Matt was a tabby cat in 9th grade. He was handsome, but a little dorkey. He was also secretly gay. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Axel,&quot; he whispered, &quot;Ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; he replied. <br />
<br />
Axel also had a secret. He was bisexual. He leaned more towards the straight side, but Matt was too sexy. They had been meeting in <br />
the locker room once a week since the beginning of the year. Matt had a study hall with an unattentive teacher at the same time as Axel <br />
had gym. To keep their meetings secret, they didn't hang out outside of the locker room. This was strictly for sexual relief, according to <br />
Matt. Axel wished he would loosen up and hang out with him more, but Matt insisted. <br />
<br />
The two young furs stripped in a far corner of the locker room. It was out of sight of the rest of the room and it was darker. There was <br />
also a big gap between the lockers and the wall back there, so one of them could hide if neccessary.<br />
<br />
Axel sat down on the bench while Matt got on his knees. The cat was definitely the submissive one he was always the bottom and did <br />
whatever Axel said without him using his power.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your junk is so cool,&quot; the cat complimented while slowly licking it, &quot;How it glows green. And how big it is!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit teasing, Matt,&quot; Axel moaned softly, &quot;If you want it, take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The younger fur didn't need any more persuasion. He quickly took the 8&quot; shaft into his mouth and suckled it expertly. He had watched <br />
porn on his laptop and now with a half year of practice, his blowjobs were amazing. Matt slowly sucked the weaselcoon's cock until he <br />
felt his balls pull up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt, I'm gonna...&quot; Before he could finish, the cat's mouth was full of Axel's boy cream and Matt eagerly licked it up.<br />
<br />
Axel watched the cat boy lustily. Matt refused to do anything romantic, fearing he might get too used to it and somhow let his secret out. <br />
But with the skimpy outfit of soccer shorts and a tanktop he was wearing today, Axel couldn't resist him. <br />
<br />
Grabbing the cat's head, he looked straight into his eyes and said, &quot;Kiss me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt was unable to say no. He hesitated, but then the two teens locked lips and shared Axel's cum that was still in his mouth. Without <br />
breaking the kiss, Axel lifted the cat boy onto the bench next to him and opened his locker. Inside his bag was a bottle of lubricant he <br />
had bought at the corner store over the weekend. They had never done anal before, just oral.<br />
<br />
Axel lubed up his green equipment and then reached under Matt to do the same to his rear. The cat softly yowled in surprise, but soon <br />
relaxed and returned to kissing Axel. He lifted the cat once more over his cock and slid the cat boy onto it. Matt grimaced in pain, but <br />
didn't complain as Axel softly pressed on. After some adjustment, Matt began purring while Axel slowly thrusted into him. They broke the <br />
kiss for air and Matt buried his head into Axel's shoulder, clinging to his partner. With one hand holding the cat, Axel used his other to <br />
stroke Matt's hardon. <br />
<br />
Matt wasn't near as big as him, only five inches erect. But what he lacked in size, he made up for with looks. Though he never worked <br />
out like Axel, Matt's body was lithe and muscular. And his fur was orgasmically soft. <br />
<br />
The same fur brushed against Axel's balls as he fucked his bottom. The feeling of pleasure was soon too much and Axel released his <br />
load into Matt's rear. His large balls supplied a steady stream of cum to the cat's hole. When he finished, he pulled off of the cat and <br />
they showered together. Then they dried off in the same oversized towel. Kissing once more after they dressed, Axel asked Matt his <br />
usual question. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you come hang out with me and my friends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know if I can...I mean...I'm kinda busy and...my friends...&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel knew the cat was lying. He knew for a fact he didn't have any friends. Any boy was too repelled by his slightly gay personality and <br />
any girl was repelled by his dorkey hobbies. But those were what Axel loved about him.<br />
<br />
&quot;C'mon,&quot; he said staring into Matt's eyes, &quot;What could it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; he hesitated, but Axel already knew the answer, &quot;Okay.&quot;</p>
