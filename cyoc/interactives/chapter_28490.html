<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kevin look at Sean and Chris with an evil smile...those little jerks deserved no mercy at all and he knew exactly what he would do to them.<br />
<br />
Fuck you! You won’t manipulate me again you little fag! I think you should learn a good lesson. Skaters sucks and I am going to solve that problem.  I will change you into big ridiculous wiggers! Big muscular white thug kids with a very low IQ! We'll see if you're going to make you're smartass after that!<br />
<br />
Sean and Chris faces where full of fear, what they've just heard didn’t pleased them at all. In fact they hated wiggers very much, finding that they where all posers and wannabe (which is’nt far from the truth). They tried to protest but before they realized that they where in big troubles in trouble it was to late, they where frozen unable to move or speak.<br />
<br />
Sean was the first to change; all his cloths vanished in thin air as Chris looked at his friend with fear. His haircut changed into a crew cut as his face re-arranged into an excessively masculine one. His jaw became very square and preeminent as his sideburn changed into fine line going all the way down to his chin. All his piercing disappeared. But they where soon replaced by the biggest diamonds (fake, off course, because they are just wannabes) studs ever...one in each earlobes. Wiggers don't wear piercing, it's for gay guys. Instead hardcore wiggers wear big diamonds in their earlobes. As the big wigger he was changing into, Sean would have to conform to this rule.  As his face was changing into the one of a hardcore thug, his body exploded with muscle. Not just a little, a lot more than most peoples would find attractive. <br />
<br />
Sean looked now like a teen that had always taken massive dose of steroids. His arms measured almost 20 inch each and the rest of his body was equally impressive. His chest was now a mountain of muscle, his abs looked like they where sculpted with a knife and his legs would make any pro bodybuilder jealous. Kevin also gave Sean the most irresistible bubble but ever seen on a boy of this age so he would easily get fucked all the time. <br />
<br />
But all that muscle looked more like a gift than a punition on this mature boy. Kevin had off course a plan for that. He wanted to humiliate them not reward them. With an evil smile he readjusted Sean’s age so that he would be 14 year old. Sean was now a freak for a boy of his age and Kevin was really pleased with that. He would certainly be the moquery of every other kids for now on... The transformation of Sean's body was now completed and he needed cloths. <br />
<br />
First a pair of boxers appeared on his ass as this is the must for a big wigger like him. Kevin opted for a classic white Joe Boxer boxer brief. With their big waistband, these boxers looked always good on saggers like Sean was going to be transformed into. The boxer brief looked skin tight on his bubble ass and that even gave Kevin’s a hard-on. Next the baggiest pair of jeans appeared on Sean’s body. It was certainly 4 sizes to big even for a muscled teen like Sean. However this was perfect for a super wigger. Kevin made sure that Sean would love wearing it very low so it would almost fall all the time. After all, that's what all wiggers do. Sean and Chris would not only be changed into ordinary wiggers but into super wiggers. So, logically, they also deserved to become super saggers. Next, a pair of very dirty Timbs appeared on his foots...that complimented the look very well. Although he looked like a freak, Sean was quite sexy standing there with his pants almost falling down revealing half of his boxers’ shorts and his entire bubble ass. His upper body was massive and Kevin decided not to give him any shirts. He just covered his left arm with tattoos that all white trash boys crave and putted a big shinny chain around his neck. Bling bling is a trademark of suburban wiggers.  Of course the look would not be complete without baseball caps and durags. Kevin made sure that those items would cover the head of Sean at all times. As a final touch, Kevin re-arranged Sean's look so that everything looked exaggerated and fake. Sean looked like the biggest poser ever made on earth. The biggest wannabe-gangsta ever seen.<br />
<br />
Sean’s mind was altered so he would have the IQ of a very stupid wanksta but Kevin let Sean’s keep all his memories. He wanted Sean’s to remember his transformation and everything that he was before. Humiliation being everything with this punition, Kevin unfroze Sean so that he could now look at himself in the mirror and speak. <br />
<br />
Kevin was first to spoke: “There you are! Fucking poser! You are now the biggest wigger I know.<br />
Sean: Ho fuck!!.<br />
<br />
When he saw himself in the mirror Sean got an immediate hard-on witch he immediately took care of by grasping the front of his boxer. Sean’s new cock got so big that the fabric of his boxer stretched almost to it’s limit. Kevin had altered the mind of Sean so that he would get the urge to grasp his meat every time he would look at himself or at another wigger like him. Muscled thugs, either straight or gay, would now give Sean big hard-ons every times. Everyone could admire the teen’s erection since he was straight sagging his jeans. Sean’s didn’t give a fuck however….he was proud to let it show.<br />
<br />
 Kevin: You love being a big stupid wigger don’t you?<br />
Sean : Ho yes!<br />
Sean: I'm so sexy with my pants almost falling down showing my entire ass and boxers. I love my muscled body, working out is the only important thing in life. Wiggers rules!!<br />
Kevin : Good boy! You deserved to be punished don’t you think? Skaters fag like you deserve to be punished by being changed into big muscle bimbo thug.<br />
<br />
When he heard that, Sean immediately came into his boxers. The idea of humiliating skaters by forcing them to become like him was now the most erotic thing to him<br />
Sean: yes I deserved to be punished for what I did to you.<br />
<br />
Kevin: yes you did! But you know that the real reason is because skaters suck. You deserved to become a big wigger because you where a skaters. Skaters deserve to be changed into big muscled wiggers don't you think?<br />
Sean: Fucking yeah!! Skaterz should all be forced to become big wigger thugs just like me.<br />
Kevin : Good boy! I now give you the power to change other boy into muscled wiggers. But this power will work only on skaters like you’re friend here.<br />
Kevin : that's what you want to do to you're friend here don't you?<br />
Sean : ho yes, I want him to become just like me, a big muscle wigger fag!<br />
Chris eyes open up with terror…He couldn’t believe what he was hearing from the mouth of his firend<br />
Kevin : good boy, for now on you'll have the power and the irresistible need to transform every skaterz you see into big muscular wigger thugs</p>
