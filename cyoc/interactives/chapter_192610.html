<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You.....your not.....it can&#39;t be&quot; mumbled Loki, his eyes frantically looking over Alex&#39;s form, as if searching for something that was missing.<br />
<br />
Alex was dumbfounded, how could she be this teen, no, this God&#39;s mother, the only child she had was still next in her womb, Alex&#39;s eyes darted to look at her swolen belly at the though of her daughter to find Lilly gazing out at the new person infront of her, her eyes wide and curious as she watched silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummmmmm, I&#39;m sorry but....who are you?&quot; Asked Alex as she took a step closer to the distressed Loki, Alex looked towards Mary who seemed too shocked from Lokis sudden outburst to muster any words, let alone walk over to assist Alex.<br />
<br />
Loki seemed hurt by Alex&#39;s question, a deep pain on his face before he looked away, his sholders dropping almost as in defeat &quot;of corse.....you won&#39;t remember....I doubt you remembered Sylphi either then?&quot; He asked, his eyes now locked on Alex&#39;s pregnant swell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Sylphi?&quot; Was the only question that Alex could muster the courage to ask, and yet as she spoke the name, it felt familiar upon her tongue, as if she had spoken it a thousand times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Silphy.....Silphy&quot; whispered Alex, her hands coming to rest atop her belly, feeling the growing movement within, with each whisper of the name Lillys movements seemed to grow stronger, Alex winced as a particularly sharp jab caught her in the rib.<br />
<br />
As Alex braced her palm to her rib she jumped back is surprised as Loki suddenly apeared infront of her swolen underbelly, his face pressed firm against her belly&#39;s translucent surface and his arms embracing as much of the orb as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Silphy.....Silphy, my dear young kin, how I have missed you&quot; he cooed to Lilly, Alex groaned as Lilly then began to turn so her head now rested in Alex&#39;s pelvis, all four of her hands pressing into her sensetive underbelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy sister, easy, I&#39;m right here, don&#39;t make your presence hard on......on your, mother&quot; said Loki as he looked up at Alex, a look of confused familiarity on his face, like the words he was speaking didn&#39;t match what he was seeing.<br />
<br />
A maternal feeling began to overwhelm Alex, seeing her baby girl seem so close to this young god, maby they realy were siblings, Alex then began stroking from the top of her belly, all the way to as far as she could reach at her middle, finding a thick head of hair, and the edges of a pair of cold hard horns, but she didn&#39;t stop, if anything she began to include Loki in her soothing gesture.<br />
<br />
Something about this scenario began to seem familiar, almost like this had happened before, with theis two children, in another time, in another life, her hands seemed to cup her belly and Loki&#39;s head just right, as if her hands had been molded just for them, to give them love and comfort, she then herd a light sigh from Loki, Alex gave a small chuckle before petting his head.<br />
<br />
Looking looked up, and Alex was taken aback by his appearance, he seemed smaller, younger, before he could easily have passed for eighteen, but now he looked to be around six years old, just like Lilly, or rather just like Sylphi.<br />
<br />
&quot;So then, Prince of tricks, this is what you really look like&quot; said Alex with a smile, cupping the young gods chin in her palm to pull his gaze to her own &quot;well if so I must say, to have been so lucky as to have children like you and Sylphi, your mother must have been verry proud indeed&quot; said Alex, using her thumb to wipe a stray tear from Loki&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
In that moment, as the tear of Loki brushed against her thumb, something flared inside Alex, something that felt buried, hidden for a long time, and now it wanted out, now it wanted to be free, for all to see, her pulse quickened, her blood now feeling like liquid gold in her veins, her skin broke out into a fevered sweat, and her eyes began to burn, like a brand had been pressed into her eyes.<br />
<br />
Alex then doubled over, clutching her gravid womb as it too began to burn, her bones began to shift and change, her hips becoming wider, her feamers becoming stronger and more load bearing, her spine grew a thick cartilage weave accross it&#39;s surface, creating a spiders Web of reinforced support for her spine.<br />
<br />
The translucent surface of her pregnant swell began to burn and stretch, black ink beginning to pool from her pours, snaking accross her surface into the pattern of a crescent moon, weaving into intricate designs to create the full image.<br />
<br />
When the blinding pain of her changes let her veins Alex opened her eyes to find herself laying on the fur carpet infront of her bed, Lady Mary at her side holding her hand, Alex let out a grunt as she tried to rise  finding her effort needed was no longer enough to rise, and upon looking down she soon realised why.<br />
<br />
Her figure had completely changed, her belly now ballooned out infront of her, the weight in her pelvis and along her spine was now far more noticeably noticeable, the movement beneath her skin seemed more frequent and strong, her hips felt wider, feeling more molded for her emense pregnancy.<br />
<br />
And speaking of her hips, there seemed to be something wedged in its bowl, but Sylphi was currently pushing her head into one of Alex&#39;s ribs, upon looking through her translucent midsection she soon found the culprit.<br />
<br />
Below her new sibling was a small black haired boy, with a pair of small black horns on his forehead, and he currently had his sholder nestled inside her pelvis.<br />
<br />
Alex gave a sigh as she stroked over her new swell, before heaving herself into a stand, Mary watching with her eyes wide and mouth agape, unable to find the words to discribe what had just happened, Strangely enough Alex seemed to find her new form wasn&#39;t hindering her as mutch as she would have expected, her close sadly hadn&#39;t fared as well as she had, her silk gown now laying at her side in shreds.<br />
<br />
More strange was the fact that Alex had a strange sence of calm, like she had been made for this, to be who she was now, Alex then groaned as she waddled over to her bedside and eased herself to sit on its edge, turning with a smile to Mary.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love the ideas for the dresses lady Mary, but I think we may need to up the size around the middle and hips&quot;.</p>
