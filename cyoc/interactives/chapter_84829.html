<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So what do you wanna do tonight,&quot; Kellie asked. &quot;Not sure,&quot; Mary Elise responded. &quot;I&#39;ve got a couple of personal days that I used for this occasion but it&#39;s getting close to the end of school year and I still need to finish the final grades for my students.&quot; &quot;Come on Mary,&quot; Claudia sighed. &quot;Mika and I are only in town til Sunday. It could be a long time before we come back.&quot; &quot;There are a couple of good bars downtown,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;I know the owners we can bypass the line.&quot; &quot;Loved to but my stupid ID has already been rejected twice.&quot; Kellie groaned. &quot;Let me see,&quot; Tricia asked. Kellie began rummaging through her purse producing her license and handing it over to Tricia. &quot;Huh that&#39;s weird,&quot; Tricia stated. &quot;It&#39;s your birthday except twenty years early with a picture that looks like your mom. Did you check this out when they handed it to you?&quot; &quot;Yea it seemed fine at the time,&quot; Kellie exclaimed. The women now began to discuss the mystery of the unusual ID Katie began to get nervous and felt the need to change the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kellie,&quot; Katie said. &quot;Why don&#39;t you and your friends come back to our house? We could watch movies and order pizza and just all hang out together.&quot; The five women looked at Katie and began to laugh. &quot;Thanks for the offer kiddo,&quot; Kellie said while patting her head. &quot;But I think we&#39;re going to do something a little bit more grown up.&quot; Katie began to sulk in her chair. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it kid,&quot; Mika said. &quot;It&#39;s a nice offer but we haven&#39;t gone out as a group in a few years.&quot; Mika&#39;s kind words didn&#39;t help the situation. &quot;You know we like hanging out with you at the beach but we&#39;re a little too old to just eat pizza and watch movies all night.  Maybe if you were in our shoes, then you will understand that there is more to us older women then you think.&quot; Katie glanced up at Mika as she finished her sentence. A thought began to form in her head. &quot;Mary Elise can you help me out on this.&quot; Mika asked. Mary Elise approached Katie with a kind smile on her face. &quot;Don&#39;t be in such a hurry to grow up Katie,&quot; she said. &quot;Going out to the bar isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be. Sometimes I wish you were as old as us, then maybe we can all hang out together and understand how the adult life is like.&quot; That last statement did it for Katie; maybe if she were the same age as them, then she wouldn’t be treated like a kid anymore. Silently she wished to age fifteen years older.<br />
<br />
The ring soon glowed green in response of her wish and she could feel the changed happening.  Going into her double digits as her height soon reached over the four-foot mark.  So much so that her one-piece bathing suit was feeling tighter then normal.  It felt so amazing the first time she done it.  But those times were when she wanted to age a few years to get her piercing.  Now she was going to grow older just so she can spend time with her former mother and her new ‘old’ friends.  Just as she thought of that, she felt a little quizzy and didn’t know what it was.  What she didn’t know was that she was entering puberty as her first period was starting.  Feeling a little uncomfortable, Katie turned to her former mother and said, “Kellie, I need to use the restroom.”  Kellie turned to her sister and responded, “Don’t take too long squirt.  We got a lot to do for our free time.”  Saying, “Kay”, she got off her chair and rushed to the nearby restroom to pee.  As she left the restroom, Mary looked to her and shook her head.  “You know, you should be a little nicer to your little sister Kate.” she said looking worried, “You know that she’s starting her puberty phase.”  Kellie looked to her friend and said, “Oh please…  Just because my sister is starting to become a teenager doesn’t mean she’s going to grow up fast.  She still going to be my little brat, no doubt about it.  There’s no way she’s going to compete with me and my babies.”  She then placed her hands to the sides of her breasts and squeezes them together, showing her the ample cleavage that she has.  Mary rolled her eyes around and could tell that Kellie was getting a little too cocky.  She just hope that Kellie’s comments won’t bite her back, but thanks to that little wish, it will change soon.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in the restroom, Katie was just about finished peeing in the toilet as she was a little surprised by the unexpected feeling of her period.  Noticing the blood in the water, she could tell that she was really growing up.  “Wish I had some tampons.” she said, as her mind was catching up to her growing body.  After she flushed the toilet, Katie picked up her bathing suit and put it back on.  But as she was putting it on, it was getting very uncomfortable.  Looking down, she could understand why.  Her suit was stretching over her aging body as she was entering the cusp of teenagehood.  Her height was increasing through the four-foot length as she could see the signs of woman hood taking place.  Her hips increasing a little bit as the signs of curves were starting to show.  Her rear looked a little bloated as it gave a distinct roundness to it.  But the one thing that caught her attention was her chest.  Two dots poked out of her chest and begins to expand, turning into small mounds.  Looking on in shock, Katie got out of the toilet stall and approached the full-length mirror in the restroom.  What she saw amazed her.<br />
<br />
Standing before her was a preteen girl around fourteen starting to develop into a fine woman.  Her breasts already expanded to A-cups and she’s already seeing signs of an hourglass figure over her tightening suit.  Her one-piece bathing suit however was stretching to the brink as the middle was showing rippage around her waist area.  Katie then looked to her face and noticed that it has changed as well, maturing with the rest of her body.  Her cheeks looked less puffy and her nose was looking a little long and thin.  Her eyes seem less childish and her innocence had become less noticeable.  Her hair even grew longer and fuller as is started to look a little wavy.  Katie looked on in awe and couldn’t believe she was growing up right before her very eyes.  “Wow…  Look at me.” she said in a lower voice, “I’m really growing up fast.”  She felt a minor migraine as she could feel her brain growing as well.  Years of knowledge are filling her mind, as she was getting smarter by the second.  In fact, common knowledge of kindergarten and grade school are easier for her as knowledge of high school entered her head.  But that’s not the only thing that is entering her head.  Ever since she was five, she always like going outside to play, rather it is hide and seek, ball, or playing tag.  But now that she’s growing, her body is becoming predisposed and more athletic.  Looking at herself, Katie could tell that her body was a little toned then before as she was gaining both energy and metabolism from the ‘years’ of sports.  Her mind was also being filled with memories of the many years she participated in sports including T-ball, soccer, and gymnastics.  Katie looked on in disbelief as her body was developing faster then before.<br />
<br />
Entering her teen years, Katie has now entered the threshold of child to adult as she hit the sweet sixteen mark.  Her height reached to five-foot range as her bathing suit was completely stretched to the limit.  Her breasts grew to B-cup size as the seam in the middle of her top of her suit and grew down the middle, showing a bit of cleavage.  Her hips and reach expanded further to create a much curvier hourglass as ripping came to the her waist line and exposed some skin.  Her arms and legs gained more feminine muscles as her biceps were bloating and her calves were bulging with years of jogging and push-ups.  Her face continued to mature as her lips started to puff out and her nose grew long and thin.  She did notice signs of pimples dotting hear and there, but that soon faded to be replaced with smooth flawless skin.  Even her hair grew fuller as it went down to her mid back.  Her brain kept on filling with high school knowledge as history, math, English, and social studies felt easier for her.  But her athletic knowledge continues to dominate more of her brain as memories of her taking on karate, track, and volleyball now entered her mind.  The teen watched on and was amazed by how her body has grown and developed.  If it’s possible, she might be able to surpass her former mother’s body.  The ring continued to glow as Katie left her teens and entered her twenties.<br />
<br />
Going over five feet, Katie height is straining her one piece to the point of breakage.  Her breasts now grew into a C cup as the rippage in the center grew further down to expose more cleavage.  Her hourglass figure grew curvier as her hips expanded further and her rear inflated bigger.  That expansion caused the middle of her bathing suit to split in two, making it a two-piece.  The muscles on her arms and legs grew thicker and harder and although they are not body builder level, she does show that she was very athletic.  Her face left childhood completely as her skin as clear and shiny, her nose was very elegant, her lips puffy and defined, and her eyes looked sultrier and less innocent.  Her hair was close to her back and darkened slightly to match with her looks.  Her mind matures as well as knowledge and memories were changing incredibly.  Most of which involve sports as she now knows how to do the hurdles, light weight training, and yoga to make her feel flexible.  At 21 years of age, Katie was amazed to see how grown up she looked.  She might even make Kellie jealous of her body.  But still, that wasn’t enough as she was just about finished with her changes with the ring on her finger.<br />
<br />
Her growth and development continued until she stopped at twenty-five, the same year as her former mother.  Once the changes are done Katie was stunned at the fact that in front of the mirror was he adult self.  In fact, she looked like an exact replica of your young mother but with a few exceptions.  Her breasts now grew to D-cups as additional muscles were added to her own physic.  The top part of her former one piece was now looking like a skintight bikini with a rip in the middle to show off her melon like cleavage.  Her waist was wide and curvy as she traced her now dainty hands on the barely visible abs on her stomach.  She could even see the bottom half stretched to the limit and now looked like a thin bikini with tight straps.  Her arms and legs looked muscular, yet at the same time sexy as well to fit her beauty.  Speaking of her beauty, her face was beyond beautiful.  She had some high cheekbones, plushy and kissable lips, elegant eyes, and a long and thin nose to complete her looks.  Her hair was long and full as it goes down to her lower back.  So much so, that Katie had to get a piece of her ripped one piece that was handing loose and lifted her hair up, forming it into a pony tail that goes to the middle of her back.  Posing a little bit, Katie looked to herself and self, “Mmm…  Damn girl, you’ve certainly grown up to be a fine woman.”<br />
<br />
As her body finished growing, Katie’s mind finished as well.  She now has knowledge and sports and any athletic activities that gave her the body to an Olympic athlete.  Any sports for females filled her mind and she felt very competitive.  So much so, that she thought that her former mother would hate her so much.  But then, another thing occurred to her.  For in Katie’s mind, memories between her and Kellie had been altered completely.  Now she didn’t think that Kellie was her former mother or big sister, but now a twin sister.  New memories entered her head as she remembered both her and Kellie being orphaned since their parents died in a car crash.  Since then, they looked out for each other when they grown up together.  But as they grew, the two took different paths of their lives.  For Kellie, studying to be a lawyer, for Katie, a sports athlete.  Still, they looked out for each other no matter the obstacles they faced.  Thinking about that, Katie thought that being a twin seems easier then that of a little sister.  It almost feels like a bond is now connected between the two as Katie felt like her as a mother or a big sister didn’t seem to work out.  Katie looked to herself in the mirror and said to herself, “You know what?  I think I could get use to the twin life.”  Looking back to the door, she sighed and said, “Better get back to the girl’s before they figure out what’s taking me so long.  I just hope this extra tight bathing suit doesn’t break when I walk.”  So getting ready for what’s going to happen next, she walked to the door and exit the bathroom to her new twin sister and her new ‘old’ friends.<br />
<br />
Walking into the bar, she noticed the girls still sipping on their margaritas and discussing on what to do tonight.  Approaching the table, Kellie turned to her new twin sister and gave a sly grin.  “There you are Kate,” she said with a bit of impatience, “We’ve been waiting for you.  What took you so long in the bathroom?  Admiring yourself in the mirror?”  Katie looked to her now twin sister and smirked to herself, noticing a hint of jealousy from her.  “No, it’s nothing like that Kel.  Just prepping myself for the big day for us girls.  So, what were you guys talking about while I was away?”  Kellie looked to her sister and said in a clear and understanding voice.  “Well…  The other girls realized that they were wearing some clothes that are a little big for them.”  “Tell me about it.” Samantha responded, “This look like something my grandma would wear.  Must’ve been some airhead putting this on.”  Kellie turned to Samantha and gestured for her to shut it and turned back to Kate for a favor.  “Anyways…” she continued, we were thinking of heading down to a swimwear store we passed by just so we could get something more fitting to our bodies.  You wanna come?”  Katie thought about it and realized that she does have a point.<br />
<br />
When she regressed the other girls the same age of her former mom, their clothes didn’t mimic their bodies, as they seem a little loose to them.  So perhaps a change in clothes will make them feel a little better.  And besides, since her old bathing suit will soon break apart, she needed to get something comfortable as well.  So nodding, she said to her twin, “No prob sis.  We could all use to new duds right now.”  With that said, Mary got up and said, “Then what are we waiting for?  Let’s go on a shopping spree!”  The others girls agreed as they finished their drinks, paid, and left the bar to get some clothes for them.  As they were leaving, Katie was feeling very confident, knowing that her new adult life would be an interesting one.</p>
