<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You look through the aisles of body suits, still pretty much in awe of the level of detail and sophistication that has went into making them. <br />
<br />
&quot;My God, I can just imagine what would happen if I went to a convention wearing one of these. I would win every cosplay competition hands down,&quot; you say, your voice barely above a whisper. You girlfriend had been the one to introduce you to anime, and for the last couple of months she had been trying to get you to dress up as Yoko Kurama, the fox demon from YuYu Hakusho. He was her favorite character, in fact she had a little notebook full of drawings of him in...intimate positions with other anime characters. And, more often then not, her.<br />
<br />
You had so far refused because, well, the costumes looked stupid. But if there is one of him here...<br />
<br />
There was, you realize as you turn into another aisle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy Shit,&quot; you say. There was nothing else to say, the costume was perfect. The suit's makers had rendered every perfect detail of Yoko Kurama's body; from his smooth, powerful abs to his effeminately beautiful face to his long, silver hair and long silver fox tail and fox-like ears . The mask's eyes were empty, of course; obviously the user would be using his own eyes to fill the void. And then there was the package, while big, was in proportion to the rest of the body and looked just about right. It was definitely bigger then your own, you notice, more then a little ashamed.  <br />
<br />
Hesitantly, you reach out and run your hand through his hair, finger the ears and touch the face before recoiling in surprise. The suit feels warm, like real skin and hair! You are more then a little creeped out by how lifelike it feels.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see you found one you like,&quot; a voice says behind you and you nearly jump out of your skin. You turn to find the the owner of the store standing behind you, arms crossed over his chest and the hint of a smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;This...this costume feels like its made of real hair and flesh,&quot; you reply shakily. <br />
<br />
He laughs. &quot;It should, otherwise the magic I used to make it didn't work. But obviously it did, and the costume is here, ready to turn anyone who wears it into fox demon Yoko Kurama.&quot;<br />
<br />
You couldn't believe what you just heard. &quot;Did you...&quot;<br />
<br />
The store owner nods. &quot;Yes, you see I am a wizard and I made these costumes to turn people into their deepest desire. Or in your case, your girlfriend's desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your stomach seems to knot up. &quot;How did you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't I just say I am a wizard? What part of that do you not understand?&quot; <br />
<br />
You stand there with a slack jaw for several seconds before stammering out, &quot;Ho...How much?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see, I don't accept money for these costumes,&quot; he said. &quot;What I expect the buyer to do is work for me as a, hmm, indentured servant would be the best word for it. About a year's time in which you will be running errands, delivering packages, gathering materials to make these suits, steering potential customers to the store. That sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
You are about to say something, but he interrupts you. &quot;Don't worry about the dangers, most of the errands are perfectly safe; and for the ones that have a degree of risk, well the suit gives you more then enough power to deal with those risks. You will have Kurama's speed, agility, strength, power over plants, his unholy stamina and healing ability. Oh, and you will be able to switch into his human form in order to blend into a crowd. I will even provide you with fake IDs for that form, all under the name Shuichi Minamino.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it permanent?&quot; you ask. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's up to you. You can take it on and off at will; or you can remain in it indefinitely. I really don't care,&quot; he says and then sticks out his hand. &quot;So do we have a deal? Are you ready to become something more then some slightly overweight, run of the mill college student?&quot;  <br />
<br />
After a second's hesitation you reach out and shake his hand. &quot;Yes sir, we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, dressing rooms are in the back. I will go and get you some more appropriate clothes for afterwards, along with the IDs.&quot;<br />
<br />
As he turns, you grab the suit off the rack and run into one of the changing rooms, locking the door behind you. You hustle to take off your clothes and hurry into the suit. You look at your body once in the full-length mirror. It looks pathetic next to the deflated suit. You're still somewhat skeptical, but, hell, its worth a shot. And you don't want to be some nobody forever.<br />
 <br />
You push your feet into the costume and watch as its feet and legs fill up, sticking and conforming perfectly to your legs. The material is smooth, almost silky. In fact, its erotic enough to give you an erection. As you stand up with your face red, it seems like you have gotten taller....then you realize you have gotten taller. The old man wasn't lying!<br />
<br />
You look into the mirror and see that your body looks disproportionately smaller than your legs. Time to fix that, you think and after a few moments of struggling, manage to get your erect little trooper into the suit's bigger one, smiling at the size of the resulting erection. If only you had had this suit sooner!<br />
<br />
You pull the stomach and chest up and feel the material stick before putting your arms in the sockets. You hold up your hands, marveling at the claw like fingers, running them over the suit, realizing that it feels just like your naked hands touching skin. Then you zip up the back, feeling the suit conform to your body. <br />
<br />
As you look in the mirror at your new body; tall, lean, powerful...and it has a tail. Curious, you reach behind you and yank on it and hiss a little at the resulting pain. The damn thing's real, you keep telling yourself.<br />
<br />
Then a big grin blossoms on your face as you pick up the mask and look into its empty eye sockets; realizing Kurama's face is much more handsome then yours will ever be even if you spent a small fortune on plastic surgery. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goodbye...and good riddance,&quot; you say as you pull the mask over your head. The mask seems to heat up as it goes down. When everything is correctly aligned and the mask's neck is smoothed together with the bodysuit's neck, your vision blurs for a second and then clears up. And when you look into the mirror, you see that your pupils have changed from your brown-color to Kurama's golden eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow,&quot; you say...and then realize your voice is the exact same tone and pitch as Kurama's from the series. Not only that, you are seeing things more clearly, noticing details on your surroundings that you have never noticed before, hearing things you have never heard before, and smelling things you never smelled before.<br />
<br />
Anxious to give it a test, you hold out your hand and make a blade of grass appear in your hand. An evil chuckle escapes your lips as you make it longer and harder then the world's strongest blade and then use it to slice your old clothes. Oh, things are going to be different from here on out!</p>
