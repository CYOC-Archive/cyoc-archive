<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The report that Marcus and Vito Gamboni had been caught and were in custody was an uplifting moment for the Charleston family and there were various feelings that related to the relief that came from that. The biggest was that the family likely wouldn&#39;t have to run again, or at least not for quite a while, depending on the nature of the sentence handed down. They might still have to attend the trial, given the laundry list of crimes that the Gambonis had committed over the years chasing them, but Moe considered that minor in relation to everything else that had been going on of late.<br />
<br />
The biggest real relief that Moe and Nichole felt was that they were able to take some steps to assure that Tara wouldn&#39;t be aware that the married couple had been a bit more physically active with each other than they had in quite awhile. It wasn&#39;t so much that Moe and Nichole were too old for things like sex, even if they weren&#39;t in the prime of their youth anymore, but that the pair of them had gotten into it in some one else&#39;s home, who had offered them her cabin as a safety measure when they&#39;d realized that the Gambonis had found a way to trace the Charlestons to Moon Lake, and while Officer Tara Strange might be fully aware of Moon Lake&#39;s were population, Moe and Nichole weren&#39;t weres and were there as guests. Thus, being able to &quot;clean up&quot; was a great relief to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s finally over...&quot; Nichole said as the three followed Tara out to her vehicle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not completely,&quot; Tara warned, &quot;they were captured... and they will face trial. It&#39;ll only be after the sentence is handed down that things regarding the Gambonis that chased you will be over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s rather small in comparison to what we&#39;ve been through,&quot; Moe commented as he buckled himself in the backseat while Nichole sat up front. Karen buckled in next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Though... how would that work?&quot; Karen wondered, &quot;given that I&#39;m now... different...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That may depend... how large of an online presence where you&#39;ve posted pictures of you do you have?&quot; Tara asked.<br />
<br />
There was a bit of silence as a result of this, as while Karen had been looking into being the Charleston&#39;s family were, she had also gotten a bit more forward than would have been safe. Karen was relived that circumstances allowed her claim her becoming a weretiger was the result of her own decisions after getting all the information she needed rather than wandering out into the woods and ultimately getting just enough pre-cum to lead to her eventual transformation. It wasn&#39;t really that she ever had any leaning toward being a werelion, but that had all been part of what she&#39;d managed to get her parents to accept the decision in the first place and she didn&#39;t want to get in trouble with them. <br />
<br />
Regardless, Karen&#39;s new status as a weretiger was a part of the puzzle to consider as Tara backed her vehicle out and began to drive down the road toward Moon Lake&#39;s City Limits and the Moon Lake Police Station. For Karen could tell that even her human form was different from where it was before. She wasn&#39;t proportionately as well built as the weretigress she&#39;d met, Olivia, but then Olivia was fully mature and Karen wasn&#39;t. However, since becoming a were, Karen could also tell that she was better built than she was before and that could be hard to hide.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... since Marcus started chasing after me... most of the police departments that we&#39;d consulted with for &quot;witness protection&quot; type stuff have urged not doing much of that,&quot; Karen said slowly, &quot;if only to give the Gambonis a harder time to track us down...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Tara said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;But some of the officers and FBI agents have seen me before... at least in certain areas,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;and there have been some occasions where Marcus managed to find where dad had his pizza shop set up... and couldn&#39;t do much because it was a public place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be difficult,&quot; Tara then sighed, &quot;I&#39;d suppose we could give an explanation that you&#39;ve had a bit of a growth spurt since the last time you&#39;ve seen any of those agents and officers... and they might buy into that. You could also claim to have gotten into some manner of personal fitness for self defense and thus trained in private. They could buy that too... though that might just be the best we can do for now. If Agent Baoman is suspicious over these things... Chief O&#39;Hara will handle things as they go from there with regard to coordination. He has a bit more expertise with being a were than I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of the drive into Moon Lake went relatively quietly and without too much trouble. The route still zigged and zagged as it came down from one of the mountains that surrounded the town before straightening when they came to the valley where Moon Lake was. From there, the drive was quick and easy as they made their way to the Moon Lake Police Station. Some of the FBI&#39;s vehicles were still there, but there were fewer of them than the days prior Tara guessed that was the result of the Gambonis being caught and less need for having many of the agents that were assisting with monitoring positions and setting up the ambush that finally caught the Gambonis.<br />
<br />
She parked her vehicle and lead the Charlestons in, getting some confirmation that Chief O&#39;Hara and Agent Baoman were waiting in the conference room when she checked in. The Charlestons followed along behind her as she lead them through the station and eventually came to the conference room that she was told her chief and the main agent that had been running the FBI&#39;s attempt to catch the Gambonis were waiting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief O&#39;Hara, the Charlestons are here, sir,&quot; Tara spoke after knocking on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well... let them in,&quot; came O&#39;Hara&#39;s voice, &quot;and you may then return to your duties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Tara answered and then opened the door.<br />
<br />
The Charlestons entered to find both Chief O&#39;Hara and Agent Baoman seated on the long side of the table opposite them. For the moment there were no other people in the room, and they approached the chairs that were opposite the pair. Chief O&#39;Hara paid no notice to the new Karen, though Karen caught a dog-like scent on him, which surprised her in that she could recognize the scent. Agent Baoman meanwhile glanced to her slightly, but most of his focus was on her parents as they sat down. For the moment that put Karen at ease.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust that Officer Strange has informed you that both Marcus and Vito Gamboni were caught last night?&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara asked to them as they scooted their chairs in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Moe nodded, &quot;which was quite good news...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that we can go home,&quot; Nichole added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara nodded, &quot;You can... although I am afraid that there will be some &quot;bad news&quot; that we must report to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad news?&quot; Moe said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our original plan had the hope that Marcus and Vito would enter the house normally... and the worst damage you might have had would have been minor structural damage to the door frame, which would have been easy to self repair,&quot; Agent Baoman spoke, &quot;However, it would appear that Vito threw us something of a curve ball. Somewhere along the way, he&#39;d picked up some tear gas grenades. We&#39;re not sure how or where... and neither he nor Marcus have said much of anything as to where they got them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though they are also the sort that are legal to buy,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara warned, &quot;we know they weren&#39;t stolen from a police armory... and various private security firms will invest in buying tear gas canisters, as they are non-lethal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe noted that Chief O&#39;Hara shifted his eyes to look to the FBI Agent as he said that line. Agent Baoman closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course... my point being is that this was a surprise that we didn&#39;t expect given the circumstances,&quot; Agent Baoman spoke, &quot;and in the use of these grenades, they broke one of the windows on the back side of your house... I believe the master bedroom, if the reports are correct.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They gassed our house?&quot; Nichole gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only part of it,&quot; Agent Baoman answered, &quot;and the house&#39;s ventilation systems will likely allow for it to clear and disperse. I wouldn&#39;t think that it would stain anything... though it may mean that washing your cloths and linins may be necessary to deal with any lingering scent of the tear gas that was used. The biggest issue, though, was that they broke a window to do the deed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did clean up the broken glass and have the window are secure so that nothing can get in,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara assured them, &quot;and Officer Brooks is keeping an eye on things for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Moe said to Nichole and patted his wife&#39;s hand with some relief.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as per the agreement, we will cover the cost of replacing the window,&quot; Agent Baoman spoke, &quot;and I can give you the specific offices to send the billing to... you do have the paperwork that was signed, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Moe nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be good,&quot; Agent Baoman nodded, &quot;and again... I apologize for the damage to your home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Getting the Gambonis off the streets and away from our daughter is the biggest thing,&quot; Moe assured him.<br />
<br />
The others nodded in agreement to that before Chief O&#39;Hara passed a small card over to Moe.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the address and phone number for Jenkins Construction, they&#39;ve built a fair number of the homes in the outer parts of Moon Lake,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara spoke, &quot;they may have the specific window frames in stock and would install them if that&#39;s not something you wish to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Moe took the card and noted that the site was actually in Moon Lake and thanked the police chief for that. As the meeting concluded and they stood up, Agent Baoman apologized again for the damage to their home and thanked them for the help in putting two members of the Gamboni crime family behind bars. Moe responded well to that, as that was part of what he&#39;d wanted since the Gambonis had put his family on the run to begin with. There might still be the trial, but for the most part the Gambonis and their threat were likely behind them now.  And with some aspects of Moon Lake growing on them and Nichole now more comfortable to things, the biggest thing that Moe had ahead of them was getting  Moe&#39;s Pizza up and running and that would have some hurdles in and of itself, but it would hopefully be worth it.</p>
