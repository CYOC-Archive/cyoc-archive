<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It started a couple days after his height and size had finished shrinking from his near six foot frame down to one of about ten inches tall if on two legs, but ten inches long if down on all fours. Out in the yard, squatting to pee like he did and now found so natural to do, Jeff happened to look down at his naked body. Cocking his head, he thought that something was different, but wasn’t sure what. Standing, still peering down at himself, he wandered over to where he&#39;d left his shirt and wiggled into it.<br />
<br />
Not a single thought to how he&#39;d gotten better at managing certain things with paws, like putting on his last article of clothing, his mind was instead on what was happening to him. Trying to sort of what was different, he wandered over to his dog house, but didn&#39;t enter. Sitting down so his legs were splayed out before him, he pawed at his shirt until he was able to see his cock and balls.<br />
<br />
Uninterested in them, as he was still male, even though he knew the eventual outcome, he was instead more interested in his pubic hair. Studying it, thinking what he’d thought he noticed off had to do with it, he worked the shirt up until he was able to see his abdomen and chest. Cocking his head to the side again, unaware of how much he looked like a dog by doing so, Jeff stared at the patch of hair on his torso, what surrounded his privates, and unsure what exactly he was looking for, he didn&#39;t do anything when his shirt dropped back down to cover him. Placing his forepaws flat on the ground, he wondered, &quot;What&#39;s different? And why do I think it&#39;s with what hair I have on my body?&quot; but, finding he wasn&#39;t able to determine what, he continued to stare downward and he considered that maybe the best he could do was monitor himself.&#8232;<br />
Satisfied it was the best he was to do, over the next few days, he did exactly that as he watched himself for anymore changes. Outside in the yard to have himself a squat, finding this was the best time to look himself over, it came as a start when he suddenly realised what it was that had changed. Peering at the hair that had started to cover his body since sometime after he&#39;d begun to go through puberty, Jeff could have sworn that, if he didn&#39;t know any better, it had lessened.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fallen out, is more like it,&quot; he thought as his finished, then trotted over to where he&#39;d left his shirt and picking it up in his mouth, he head back inside.&#8232;&#8232;His mother in dining room, dad off somewhere, and his sister in the living room, Jeff soon found a quiet place. Knowing he wouldn’t be disturbed, he lay down on top of his shirt and began to study his body. Discovering that it wasn&#39;t so much that his body hair was vanishing or falling out or whatever it was doing, but that it was instead being replaced, he couldn&#39;t help himself as he tried to groan, and instead let out a low whimper. Understanding what he was seeing and what it meant, Jeff found he didn&#39;t know how he felt about the fact he was losing his body hair, and that it was being replaced by dog fur. Deciding there was nothing he could do about it, figuring it had to happen sooner or later, he wiggled into his shirt and lay on his side, wondering as he did if there was any point any longer to having the garment on.<br />
<br />
Resolute to continue watching the fur grow, for almost two weeks, he observed how it sprouted over his body. White patches starting first in the privates and groin area, they then started to appear on the inside of his legs and arms, then his chest, and lastly his abdomen. Wondering as light tan fur began to sprout on the outside of his arms, medium brown fur on the outside and back of his legs why it seemed only to go as his neck as the coat became more pronounced, the matter was soon driven from his mind when he noticed another thing about him that was changing.<br />
<br />
His fur starting to cover more and more of his body, he almost missed it when he was once more outside. Slipping out of his shirt, thinking about his growth of hair and how it didn&#39;t cause him any discomfort, and therefore didn&#39;t lead him to being really horny, he almost missed it when he squatted to do his business. Looking down at how the patches had started to be less and less so, it came as a shock when he saw his dick had gotten smaller. Finding this upsetting, he reached down and touched it with a forepaw that was almost now covered in white fur. Ignoring the ticklish feeling of his fur brushing against the still bare flesh, Jeff found the only thing he could do was stare opened mouth and he thought, &quot;No, no, no, don&#39;t take that away. Not yet. If it goes away, I really will be a bitch. I really will have to squat to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sense of inevitability settled over him, Jeff and started to whimper and whine. Realising he&#39;d finished, he wandered over to his dog house, dropped to all fours, and finding it comfortable, even though he still was bipedal, had two arms and two legs instead of four legs, he wondered how much time he had left. Raising his head, Jeff started to howl, until he abruptly turned and ran across the yard. Slipping through the doggy door, he stood up on two legs, and wanting the comfort of someone, anyone, he wandered the house until he found his father in the living room. Sitting down next to his father&#39;s recliner, he wanted the man to pet him, and, overcome with a range of emotions he was unfamiliar with when his father did exactly that, he let his mind slip into what he&#39;d come to think of as his canine mentality.<br />
<br />
For the next couple days, Jeff allowed his dog mind full control. Finding it kept his mind off what was happening, it wasn&#39;t until it started to snow that he snapped back. Everything that had happened, was still happening, hitting home, Jeff wandered in out of the cold, and into one of the few rooms he was able to go into, the bathroom. Working the door partially shut, he stared for the first time in over a month into the full-body mirror at his reflection. The thing staring back at him weird, his first thought was that he looked like someone had taken a boy&#39;s head, shaved it bald, and put on the body of a female dog, as, from the neck up, he still had his normal human features. Standing on two legs, looking at himself from the neck down, his attention was drawn fist to the eight nipples and his female genitals. Somehow knowing his vulva were in the natural place an animal’s would be, he studied the white fur that covered what would be his for forechest if he was to drop to all fours, as well as his brisket and crotch.<br />
<br />
In addition to this, the white fur also covered the inside of the top part of his legs, the lower part of his legs, and his hind paws. The outside of his legs, but only going down about half of his leg, was covered in a medium to dark brown fur. Looking at his arms, as that was still what they were, he observed how the white fur covered the inside of his arms down to about the midpoint, then covered the whole thing, including his forepaws, whilst the outside was coated in a light tan fur that went a quarter of the way to half of the way. Turning around, and taking his time to try and get a good look, he saw black fur over his back that looked like he had a saddle on. Facing forward after some time, Jeff ran a forepaw over each one of his teats, then over his female genitals. Believing that even with paws and his privates changed it&#39;d still be impossible for him to masturbate, Jeff stared at his reflection and asked himself, &quot;What sort of dog am I becoming? And why, except for the obvious fact that I&#39;ve lost my hair, hasn&#39;t my head changed?&quot;</p>
