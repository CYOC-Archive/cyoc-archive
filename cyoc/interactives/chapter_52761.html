<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Had Brian been thinking clearly, he would have realised that he had just made a wish to be something he never wanted to be. Had he been in his right mind, he would have noted that all he was thinking about was the cute guy he was dating and this was their third date together not their first. Had Brian actually been paying attention, he would have realised that his mind was slipping into something more feminine.<br />
<br />
But he was completely unaware of what was happening to him and around him as he slid into the car next to the cute guy that worked at the office Brian worked at under the name Heather. Leaning over, Brian gave the man a peck on the cheek and leaning back, asked, &quot;Where we headed?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a surprise,&quot; the man said as he put the car into gear and drove away from Brian's residence.<br />
<br />
As they drove, Brian's mind did briefly flash to the note and the parts he had edited. Only for a minute did he think about the fact that he had wished to slowly transform into a woman, be like that for two weeks and the slowly regress back to the age of four. Flashing on the part that he added that one of his parents was a mythical creature, he asked himself, &quot;What sort of creature would that be,&quot; but was distracted as the man, Gary, started talking to him.<br />
<br />
Dinner, at a local four star restaurant, passed in a blur and before Brian knew it, it was ten o'clock and Gary was driving him home. Sitting in the car, Brian was unsure how to proceed and after moment, he asked, &quot;Would you like to come up?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gary grinned and said, &quot;Sure,&quot; understanding completely what Heather was asking.<br />
<br />
Parking the car, Gary and Brian made their way upstairs, hugging, kissing and groping each other. Fumbling with the keys, Brian hastily opened the door, and telling Gary, &quot;One moment,&quot; quickly removed the boots he was wearing and shut the door.<br />
<br />
Giggling in a rather feminine manner, his mind slipping further into that of female's mindset, Brian allowed Gary to pick him up and carry him to the bedroom. Depositing Brian on the bed, Gary grinned and bent over, gently kissing Brian on the lips and parts of his face. As he did this, Brian reached over to his left side and unzipped the hidden zipper.<br />
<br />
Pushing the dress off, not even caring that the inserts fell to the floor, Brian moaned in pleasure as Gary gently massaged his left breast. A movement and Gary was atop him, but all Brian could do was moan in a sultry fashion.<br />
<br />
Fumbling with his pants, Gary continued to kiss Brian as he told called him Heather and told him what he was going to do. Moaning some more, Brian shifted and the slowly pushed the sheer pantyhose down and kicking them off, Brian moaned, &quot;Give it to me,&quot; as Gary pushed a condom on over his enlarged and hardened member.<br />
<br />
The thong was pushed aside and Brian could feel Gary's penis rubbing against the area between his legs and for a moment his male mind reasserted itself, crying out, &quot;This is wrong! He'll know I'm a guy and that I have a penis and testicles and not the female genitals,&quot; but was pushed away as the female mind overruled it, just as an interesting feeling flooded Brian...the feeling of a hardened penis pushing into his body, through a cavity that he was didn't exist giving him such an orgasm, he cried out, &quot;Drive it in deeper.&quot;<br />
<br />
Later, Brian lay on the bed, confused. Next to him Gary was sound asleep, having been like that since some time after they had finished having sex.<br />
<br />
Rising gently so as not to wake the sleeping man, Brian pad silently across the room, wearing nothing but the thong he had been wearing earlier. Stripping off the garment and depositing it into the laundry basket, he withdrew a robe from the closet and pulling it on, he made his way toward the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Inside, he shut and locked the door as he clicked on the overhead light. Standing in from of the mirror, his bathroom hanging open, Brian peered at the reflection, taking in the appearance of what he thought looked like a she-male with a rather flat chest.<br />
<br />
After a moment, he reached down and pushed his penis and testicles aside. Peering at the area between his legs, seeing nothing but flat, smooth skin, he touched the area and then asked himself, &quot;How could Gary have stuck his penis inside of me if I obviously don't have a vagina?&quot; as he stood up straight and gazed into the mirror.<br />
<br />
After moment, Brian squatted down and opening the cabinet underneath the sink, he withdrew a box of tampons he kept just to make the illusion of him being female more complete.<br />
<br />
Reading what was written on the box, he withdrew one of the applicators and sitting down on the toilet, he looked down at the area between his legs. After a moment, he attempted to slide the tampon into what he knew was not there. When it met solid flesh, he stood up and began to pace back and forth.<br />
<br />
After moment, he sat back down on the toilet and thought. Closing his eyes, he shifted his body, reached down with the tampon and without opening his eyes, began to probe the flesh between his legs.<br />
<br />
Immediately Brian felt something different as the tampon first pressed against the skin, which felt off but Brian could place his finger why. And then, much to Brian's surprise, the applicator slid into his body. Snapping his eyes open, looking downward, Brian nearly screamed aloud at what he saw.<br />
<br />
Between his legs he still saw smooth flesh. But what really bothered him was, hanging out of his body - exactly where the vagina would be located - Brian saw a thin piece of string. Touching it, noting that it really was hanging out of his body, he gave it a tug and then hissed in pain as it became evident that it was coming out the way he thought it should come out.<br />
<br />
Lying back, resting against the tank of the toilet, Brian asked himself, &quot;What have I gotten myself into? But more importantly, what have I done to myself?&quot;</p>
