<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After the surprise of finding out his home room teacher was the one teacher everyone loathed having; the rest of Eric’s morning as a senior went by fairly well. His next classes were typical; the teacher would introduce themselves and layout the curriculum and what they would be learning throughout the year. Most of the students sort of glossed over it with a dazed look in their eyes. Eric on the other hand, looked on somewhat bored; with thoughts of being with Spencer and Frieda running rampant in his head, the were-panther had to be shaken back to reality by Ben.<br />
<br />
“Earth to Eric,” Ben speaking; “are you available for lunch?”<br />
“Lunch,” Eric seeing everyone getting up; “is it that time?”<br />
“For us seniors it is,” Alex chiming in; “one in the afternoon. Afterwards classes until three thirty.”<br />
“I’m seeing math after lunch,” Eric looking at his schedule; “I really hope that teacher isn’t teaching it.”<br />
“I hope so too,” Ben leading the trio out; “but if fat piggy is our teacher…”<br />
“At least we have Eric to help us through it,” Alex chuckling; “I doubt Wilson could stump Eric here with those crazy problems of his.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“So why do you call Mr. Wilson,” Eric taking his food tray and following Ben and Alex to a spot in the cafeteria; “fat piggy?”<br />
“It because he is a were-pig,” Ben chortling; “didn’t you notice his smell when he stormed in home room this morning?”<br />
“I wasn’t paying attention to that,” Eric looking sheepish; “I was busy trying to overhear what everyone was speaking?”<br />
“Mostly about you,” Alex digging into his lunch; “it’s not often a sophomore gets placed into the final year of high school.”<br />
“It’s a good thing you are a were-panther,” Ben speaking between bites of food; “all of the class mates are a were of some sorts.”<br />
“And some like to act and assert their dominance,” Alex rolling his eyes; “watch out for those three over there.”<br />
<br />
Eric noticed Alex gesturing to the far side of the cafeteria. The three Alex mentioned were clearly well muscled. Two of the three were laughing at the other’s joke. The third clearly the tallest had a wild look about his eyes.<br />
“Those stooges,” Ben uttering a low growl; “I thought they got held back, what with their grades.”<br />
Who are they,” Eric finally digging into the chicken fried steak that was served for lunch.<br />
“The big one is Rex,” Ben grumbling; “a were-African bull elephant who’s I.Q matches his shoe size and age.”<br />
“The other two are Harry and Larry,” Alex chuckling at the names; “also were-elephants, but based off the Asian variant.”<br />
“They like to call themselves the tusk brigade,” Ben scoffing; “do yourself a favor, stay away from them.”<br />
&quot;And if they are in the same math class as us,&quot; Eric picking at the pickled corn salad.<br />
&quot;Then fat piggy is going to have his hooves full this year,&quot; Alex chuckling.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
While Eric was busy listening to Ben and Alex give him the scoop of what to watch out for; Benton Knight was busy looking at the new elementary school, whose construction was delayed thanks to Jack Crawford’s scheming. A working lunch for Benton as he looks over the finishing touches being made to the building.<br />
“Despite that jack-ass’s planning,” Benton looking at the progress; “the school will be ready for this year.”<br />
“But late,” a school superintendent also present.<br />
“That’s the magic of overtime,” Benton looking at an empty classroom and watching a contractor quickly put together the desks that will soon be occupied with young children.<br />
<br />
Walking to what is the faculty office for the teacher’s and administrative staff; Benton sees that the equipment is already in place and the lights off. Walking past to see more classrooms also displaying desks in the midst of being assembled; the were-panther feels pleased that this project will be completed soon.<br />
“You know,” the superintendent speaking; “despite the fact that the press are swarming this town for the wrong reasons. It would be prudent to gather them all over here to watch you cut the ribbon, signifying the school is now open.”<br />
“Not a bad ideal,” Benton responding; all the while looking at his phone for messages and emails he can deal with while undergoing his inspection.<br />
“The sheriff would welcome the thought of those vultures distracted,” the superintendent following the busy were-panther to the gym; “giving him a chance to deal with that mobster in his jail cell.”<br />
“I could care less about that shit head,” Benton turning around to stare at the superintendent; “Frederick Parker can stay in that cell for all I care. After what his men tried to pull at my estate last Saturday; the man deserves whatever ill is coming to him. Trying to break into my house while my daughter was home along with her friends and a couple of were-tiger cubs,” Benton growling; &quot;that shark was lucky I didn&#39;t have men available to rend his flesh from his bones.&quot;<br />
<br />
The school superintendent stunned at what Benton just mentioned; looks on as the man in question continues to walk about the new building taking mental notes about what is completed and what is still unfinished. The inspection ending back outside in the schools parking lot, with Benton meeting his secretary as she hands over a bag of sub sandwiches.<br />
“I won’t be back at the office,” the superintendent could hear Benton saying; “make sure those reports are written up and filed before the end of business today.”<br />
<br />
Approaching the imposing man as the secretary left; the superintendent watches as Benton takes one of the sandwiches and starts eating them.<br />
“Time is money for me,” Benton handing one of the subs to the superintendent; “I can never sit still while there is business to conduct.”<br />
“Is that why you chose to inspect the new school during lunch hour,” the superintendent biting in the sub; surprised that the roast beef was at a perfect medium rare despite it shaved thinly.<br />
“I prefer working lunches,” Benton answering; “plus it was on the way for something else I have to be at.”<br />
<br />
The superintendent looks on as Benton refuses to give any more detail to the matter. Watching the man finish his sandwich and dispose of the wrapper.<br />
“If the contractors keep to the pace they are going,” Benton speaking; “the handover ceremony could take place this Friday at the earliest.”<br />
“So soon,” the superintendent looking surprised.<br />
“It would have taken place two weeks ago,” Benton looking at the building façade before turning back to the school superintendent; “But thanks to Jack Crawford and his email alias, that didn’t happen.”<br />
“It’s going to be a logistical nightmare to get the students and their parents over to this school,” the superintendent sighing; “since the school year already started…”<br />
<br />
“You’ll figure it out,” Benton heading to his town car and getting in; leaving the man to his own thoughts, Benton pulled out his phone to look at the message Amanda sent him.<br />
‘Get over to the animal shelter now.’<br />
“I thought we were going to talk about this more,” Benton muttering while starting the engine and driving off; “perhaps hire a security staff to start. Not go straight to getting guard dogs.”<br />
<br />
Yet Benton knew as he drove to the local animal shelter that this was a matter that could no longer be put off. After hearing about Nate Anderson being attacked yesterday evening; Benton was able to make discreet enquires and found out that the men arrested for the attack worked for Jack Crawford. With the man also scheming to take back Crawford computers; a portion of Frieda’s trust fund, Benton couldn’t be sure if the man would be desperate enough to take that company back by doing something equally worse.<br />
<br />
Knowing that Jack Crawford is no doubt ranting and raving mad over the expose Lance had printed; not just in the Moon Lake Gazette, but most of the major newspapers operating along the west coast. Benton knew that he had to do something to fortify and secure his estate before Jack shot back.<br />
“Let’s just hope these dogs Amanda is eyeing,” Benton pulling up to the animal shelter; “aren’t going to freak out. Animals and weres tend not to get along to well.”<br />
Seeing Amanda’s navy blue Tesla Sports car already present; Benton gets out of his vehicle and heads inside.</p>
