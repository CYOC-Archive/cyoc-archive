<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Um, I&#39;d like to find out more about the change.&quot;  Brian felt growing excitement.  An elf that could become a lion!  He would be a tremendous fighter.  And Leon was smiling at him in a way that made Brian feel hot.  It probably was nothing, but just being near the handsome young man was worth spending extra time.<br />
<br />
Leon chuckled.  &quot;I can show you everything about it.&quot;  He tugged at his tunic.  &quot;That is, if you don&#39;t mind seeing me without this.  Changing into a lion tends to rip up clothes, and I can&#39;t afford a new wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Brian flush, but he nodded.  &quot;That&#39;s fine with me.&quot;  This was getting better by the minute.<br />
<br />
The young man surprised Brian by starting to pull off his tunic right there.  He wore nothing underneath, and Brain&#39;s face reddened even more as he took in the powerful, lithe body and impressive sexual parts.  Leon chuckled as he dropped his clothing to the ground, gesturing around.  &quot;We are all ani-magus here in town.  Most of us wear clothes only out of habit, and sometimes we don&#39;t bother at all.&quot;  He waggled his eyebrows.  &quot;I could show you a lot more if you were naked as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
There seemed to be no mistaking the implication, and after a moment, Brian&#39;s tunic was on the ground by Leon&#39;s.  The young man stepped close and ran a hand over Brian&#39;s chest and shoulders, the yellow-gold eyes holding Brian&#39;s gaze hypnotically.  &quot;You are lean and strong, perfect to join my pride.  You have the desire to be with me.&quot;  That much was painfully obvious, as Brian&#39;s elven cock was at rigid attention.<br />
<br />
Brian dropped his head, embarrassed.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry.  I don&#39;t mean to offend you.  It&#39;s just that you are so...&quot;  His voice trailed off as Leon&#39;s fingers pushed his chin up and he was once again staring into those amazing golden eyes.  <br />
<br />
&quot;How can I be offended when I want you to join my pride?&quot;  His own erection was forcing his penis up from its foreskin, and he pulled Brian close to rub the tip against the elf&#39;s stomach.  Brian gasped and tentatively embraced the ani-magus, his face pressing against Leon&#39;s shoulder.  A hand slipped up Brian&#39;s back, sending shivers through his body, and he felt Leon&#39;s  fingers in his hair.  His heart was pounding as he turned to look up at Leon, and when the pressure on the back o his head pushed his face up, he went with the motion and met Leon&#39;s lips with his own.<br />
<br />
The kiss was hot and startling, tips of tongues brushing at first, and then probing.  Brian gripped harder, their bodies pressed together.  When they finally pulled mouths apart, Leon&#39;s eyes were bright.  &quot;Ready to be an ani-magus?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Still flushed and dazed, Brian nodded.  Then he was startled as Leon hefted him up, turning him to face away, and then lowered the elf onto his rigid cock.  Brian gasped as the hard prod pushed against him.  He could have twisted free, escaped the assault, but he did not want to.  This was definitely not rape.  Two more prods, and then the swollen cock found entrance, pushing into Brian with force that made him cry out.  The next thrust bottomed out, and Brian helped push up, sliding on the engorged shaft.  <br />
<br />
Leon grunted, holding Brian in a hug as he slowly pushed back in, then drew out.  &quot;You are mine.  You are part of my Pride.  You will be my lioness.&quot;  That last did not quite register until Leon&#39;s grunt turned into a low growl, and Brian realized the arms holding him were sprouting golden fur.  A lioness?  Brian&#39;s eyes widened as he realized what Leon had in mind, but even then he did not resist.  The sensations from Leon&#39;s cock were changing, getting longer and oddly rough.  And Brian felt damp, slick, in a place that did not match up to anything he was familiar with.  <br />
<br />
Leon&#39;s arms were now fully furred, and his hands were rapidly becoming paws.  Brian&#39;s own chest had golden fur sprouting as well, but it was hard to think of anything but the powerful thrusts.  Then Leon grabbed him harder and hefted him up against, pulling what must now be a lion&#39;s cock out of Brian&#39;s anus.  The elf gasped, then cried out as he was penetrated again.  This time, however, the throbbing, barbed lion&#39;s cock found a lioness&#39;s cunt ready to receive it.  Leon roared this time, and Brian&#39;s own shout turned into a  growl.<br />
<br />
They fell forward as both lost the ability to stand on two legs.  Brian caught himself on what had become forelegs, shuddering under the weight of the hug male on his back.  Leon never broke rhythm, shifting position as their bodies continued to change.  Brian was aware of transforming, felt his face push out, a tail stretch and twist behind him, muscles ripples and bones change.  Yet that was secondary to the intense pleasure/pain of mating.  This was not just sex - Brian&#39;s mind was being bombarded with instincts, desires, needs - this was a bonding between two animals, a rewriting of his most basic self.  Brian did not care.  He was happy to be a lioness, happy to belong to Leon.<br />
<br />
The lion pounding brutally into him stiffened and then they both roared as the male sent his seed into Brian.  There were some more thrusts, more jets of hot cum, and then the male collapsed on his back.  They were both panting as Leon pulled out and licked the swollen, tender lips of Brian&#39;s cunt.  Shivering, Brian twisted around and licked at the equally swollen red lion&#39;s cock hanging low under Leon&#39;s belly.  It was instinctive, natural.  And Brian found himself very happy to do it.<br />
<br />
They finally collapsed against each other, licking muzzles and rubbing heads affectionately.  Brian was so into the animal nature that he was startled when the lion spoke.  &quot;Welcome to my Pride.  You are an ani-magus lioness now.&quot;  He nuzzled Brian.  &quot;My lioness.  If you are not pregnant yet, you soon will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian had not thought of that possibility.  How would that work if he changed back to a male elf?</p>
