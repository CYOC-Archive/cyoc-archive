<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the bathroom, Irene was in the process of removing her clothes to take a nice warm shower.  After a hard days work, she really needed to relax and spend some time with her kids.  After all, a single mother really needs to have some family time.  Once she removed her top and bra, she went to her pants and said, “Jeff is certainly acting strange lately.  It’s not like him to stare at me like that, like I have two heads or something.  Teenage hormones, they can certainly drive a boy crazy.”<br />
<br />
As soon as she took her pants and panties off, she turned to the mirror and admired herself.  Thanks to Jeff’s Chronivac evolving her, she was quite a looker for a middle age woman.  Her C-cup breasts were firm and bouncy, her waist curvy and shapely, her stomach was flat and toned, and her face was as beautiful as that of an angel.  Looking at herself for the first time since the change, Irene would’ve panicked, seeing her body so young and energized. Yet she didn’t, instead she accepted her new look.  For not only did the Chronivac evolved her body, but it evolved her mind as well.  In her mind, mankind contained a gene that would stop the aging process into their mid twenties.  To Irene, it was no exception as she turned to the mirror and gave a quick turn and posed in the mirror.  “Can’t say I blame my son,” she continued, “Look at this body.  For a woman my age, I look so hot and sexy.  I’m happy that my body would stop aging and makes me forever young.  Maybe if I have some free time, I might start looking for a man.  After all, my kids really need a father figure in their lives.”<br />
<br />
Once she was done looking at herself, she approached the tub and turned on the water, setting it to the proper temperature.  Switching to her shower, she started to step in and let the warm water caress her smooth and shiny skin.  She was in pure ecstasy as was turned on by the water.  She then applied shampoo on her hair and started to scrub vigorously, rinsing it off soon after.  But as she was rinsing her doesn’t know that her body was still changing.  Jeff’s Chronivac was still evolving Irene further into the future as she was taking a shower.  Which would mean that it would be a matter of time before her body progress through the thousands of years.<br />
<br />
As the changes continued, something off happened to her hair.  She doesn’t know it yet, but it was seem that her luscious brown hair is starting to fall off her head.  Started off in with a few strands, then falling in small clumps, until finally having all of it fall, leaving her completely bald.  Once all of her hair is gone, her eyebrows started to fall off as the water slide down her face followed by her lashes while her eyes were closed.  Finally, the hair around her vagina, which was shaven every week to keep it from getting bushy, started to fall off as well as they left it completely bare.  All of that access hair started to go down the drain and disappeared completely.  Irene rubbed the back of her head to feel nothing but a smooth dome instead of her former tresses and laughed it off.  In her evolved mind, it tells her that a new chemical in her body makes her have no hair in any part of her body.  She was overjoyed as she felt that she waist hours on end making sure her hair was perfect.  Which means spending more time with the kids before and after work.<br />
<br />
As she thought of that, something happened on her fingers and toes.  One by one, each of her finger nails and toenails popped off the ends and glided down into the drain to join her discarded hair.  Irene looked to her hands to see her nails absent and smirked to herself.  In her evolving head she remembered that there was a disease ultimately nails off of peoples bodies.  It wasn’t life threatening, more like a random chance.  But it’s a chance she liked as she heard in the past that women waist over an hour in mannequin their nails.  “Who needs a manicure when you can go bare?” she asked herself as she picked her body wash and started to laven herself up.  But as she was watching her body, more changes took place that are more drastic then hair and nails.<br />
<br />
Rubbing on her breasts, her nipples started to grow smaller and smaller, starting from quarters, two nickels, to dimes, and then pennies.  They then formed into two little dots until they disappeared, leaving her boobs completely bare.  She then descended down to her stomach as she felt her curvy hourglass all around.  That is when her navel started to change as it filled in, enclosing in the process.  Once she was done with her stomach, her belly button disappeared completely with no distinction what so ever.  She then watched her round bubble but as she felt a shiver deep inside.  What she didn’t know is that her own anus was enclosing as well, sucking itself in and vanishing in her ass.  All that was left was her vagina as she washed it off.  During that time, she let her finger into a pussy lips and rubbed her colitis, wanting to masturbate in the shower.  During her masturbation, her vagina started to act as a zipper as it started on the top and slowly enclosed downwards.  As it was getting closer to the bottom something in her head told her to remove her fingers out of the vagina and she instantly listened to it.  She freed her fingers from her nub, just in time to have the rest of the pussy zipped up completely.  With the changes mostly done, she now started to look like a living Barbie doll with no tits or private area to speak of.  In her head, she would’ve freaked out, but as her brain evolved, it told her that it was all-natural as she acted like nothing happened.<br />
<br />
Once she finished soaping the rest of her up, she rinsed her entire body and was done with her shower.  Stepping out of the shower, she breathed a bit of relief and said, “Ah…  That’s much better.  Haven’t felt this good since I was single.”  Grabbing her towel, she immediately dried herself before she could put on some clothes.  But during the mid dry, her body kept on evolving as the changes started to get stranger and stranger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, little lines popped up and traced around her joints from her arms, legs, ankles, hands, fingers, neck, and waist.  This said lines widen and deepen, turning into what appeared to be segments for flexibility.  Her feet then started to make a remarkable change as well.  First each of her toes drew closer together and merged into one stub, sharpening up into a point.  Then her heel rose up as it started to grow and extra appendage, rising up to three feet.  Upon completion, her feet looked more like a pair of heel shoes connected to her legs.  The color of her skin started to lighten as the tan like peach color started to drain from her body.  Soon enough, she was white as a ghost as she looked very sickly.  That of course soon changed as her skin started to darken into a gray like color.  That said color started to shine as her body almost looked like it was completely waxed.  Soon enough, her skin was completely covered in a chrome like substance from head to toe.<br />
<br />
Speaking of her head, it too started to change as a few things shifted or disappeared.  The first thing was her nose and it shrunk into her face.  It sank right into her skin as the nostrils enclosed completely.  In a matter of moments, she had no nose to speak off, which means she couldn’t breath.  Yet she felt like she needed oxygen from the start and kept on drying herself.  Her ears grew small and loose definition, absorbing into the chrome skin and fading out of existence till all that’s left is the little holes on both sides of her head.  Suddenly, those holes filled in and two antennas like prods sticked out and grew a few feet, giving her excellent hearing.  Irene blinked her eyes a little bit as they were getting blurry from the wetness in the shower.  But what was actually happening is that her eyes were changing as well.  Her pupils started to dilate and pop out of existence as her irises vanish as well, leaving a pair of white orbs instead.  Those white orbs started to glow and change color to a light blue.  The eyes then drew closer together and merged into one, stretching sideways to form a futuristic visor.<br />
<br />
Finally, the insides of her body started to shift as some organs dissolved while others alter to form to technological mechanics.  Her lungs turned into a ventilation system, her stomach was now a fuel tank, and her heart was now a power core to keep her alive, or online.  Her skeletal structure altered and coated into an anematium frame to keep her in one piece while her muscles were shifting to a cybernized tissue for sheer strength and agility.  Lastly, her brain molded and shifted into a processor complete with CPU, memory banks, and RAM, like that of an actual computer.  Even her memories were rearranged during the change, as she was no longer a single mother of two children, but rather a servant and caretaker of the two.<br />
<br />
In almost half an hour, Irene went from being a forty something woman to a highly evolved android meant to serve those in need.  It would seem that the Evolution Package in the Chronivac has evolved Irene past the age humans and entered the dawn of the machines.  In her mind, or her processor, the human race has achieved what is more like immortality.  After centuries of modifications and innovations, mankind abandoned their human way of life to live in lives of metal and machine.  Irene seemed to be one of those individuals that wanted to live both forever and beautiful and didn’t want to die of old age.<br />
<br />
Finishing drying herself in her chrome like skin, she looked to the mirror and smiled with her metallic lips.  “Not bad for a highly advance body.” Irene said with a voice that was similar to her old one, only having a metallic feel, “I’m glad that I prefer to live a youthful beautiful life then that of a human.  The thought of that sickens me.  Oh well, better prepare dinner for the kids.  I think I should make them something very special for them.”  So Irene walked away from the mirror and out of the bathroom, not aware that she didn’t put on any clothes.  But being that she was a humanoid, she didn’t really need clothes to begin with as her private parts were all gone.  She didn’t even notice the clothes she once had vanishing out of the blue as reality seemed to have altered around her.  But she didn’t mind now, as she was going to the kitchen to serve her young masters.</p>
