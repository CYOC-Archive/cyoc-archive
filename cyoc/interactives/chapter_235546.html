<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">All of a sudden, the air around Brett grew thick and hot, like a sauna. While the jungle air before had certainly been humid, this was something else entirely. The air stunk with the scent of damp earth, leaves, flowers, animals… The pure elemental essence of the jungle was being concentrated into the Jungle King’s spell and seemingly forced into Brett all at once.<br />
<br />
He felt it flow down his nose, spreading to his lungs before radiating outward, up to the tips of his fingers and the soles of his feet. It tingled as it traveled up his spine, making Brett squirm with discomfort as he felt the intense power invade every part of his body. He felt a throb in his crotch as the tingle intensified to a vibration, then a deep massage like dozens of tiny hands were gripping his cock and squeezing it for every drop they possibly could. He grew harder than he every had before, precum drooling down his length before mixing with the torrent of sweat that was flowing from every pore on his body, soaking him from head to toe in a salty, sticky mess.<br />
<br />
“W-w-what… what’re you dooooing…” Brett slurred, barely even able to see straight as he experienced wave after wave of intense, unending pleasure.<br />
<br />
“You say you want the truth of the jungle, wasn’t that right?” the King said calmly, his voice intense as it pierced Breet’s veil of foggy thoughts. “It is impossible for you… As you are right now, that is?”<br />
<br />
“What? As I am…? What’s wrong with me…?” Brett moaned dreamily, his hips bucking wildly as he tried to hump the magic flowing around him, to no avail. The climax he sought was always just a hair away, hunted but never captured, leaving him drooling and moaning with no outlet for relief.<br />
<br />
“You are corrupted by your old world. A world of technology, of convenience, of weakness,” the Jungle King said harshly. “A mind like yours could never understand the truth of the jungle. And so, to become one with the jungle, you must be rebuilt from the ground up. Made into a true being of the jungle…”<br />
<br />
With a single swipe, the Jungle King reached out and ripped the clothes from Brett’s body, tearing them into shreds before tossing them aside into the dirt. “You will not need those pitiful rags,” he lectured harshly. “They separate you from the natural order. Your body must touch the earth, the air, and the water.”<br />
<br />
The Jungle King reached down and picked up a clump of dark, reddish-brown earth, then he dipped it into a nearby trickle of water flowing down the rocks. He cupped the thick mud in his hands and blew into it before approaching Brett’s twitching figure.<br />
<br />
“New earth. New life…” the King chanted quietly as he reached out and spread the mud across Brett’s chest, moving his hands slowly and sensually across the other man’s body. After his chest, his hands roamed across Brett’s arms, his back, his legs… and indeed, his crotch, drawing forth another moan and a spurt of warm precum. “New earth, new life…”<br />
<br />
In no time, Brett’s body was painted a dark reddish brown, the same color as the rich earth around him. It clung to him tightly, without running or streaking. Indeed, it almost looked like it was not dirt at all, but rather his own skin, no longer pale and pink but instead dark and earthy.<br />
<br />
“New life!” The Jungle King suddenly exclaimed, grabbing Brett in his powerful arms and lifting him into the air. With a shout, he hurled Brett with all his might, and he landed with a loud splash in a small pond filled the pure, sweet water.<br />
<br />
As Brett floated, thrashing and moaning as the powerufl magic continued to tease him mercilessly, he felt himself begin to change. More invisible hands began to roam across his body, shaping him like clay. His powerful, bulging muscles were pressed and massaged into a flat, lean chest, no longer the body of a muscular adult but instead the fit torso of an athletic child. Hands tugged at his short blond hair, pulling it outward painlessly until it rested far below his shoulders, while other hands picked up soft, muddy earth and massaged it into his locks, darkening it to a brown that was nearly black while also giving it a dense, frizzy texture. His muscular arms grew shorter, his powerful legs smaller and leaner, making him barely four feet high. The magic’s power flowed over his entire body, resculpting the once adult explorer into a child, but not just any child…<br />
<br />
With a final groaning squeal, Brett bucked his hips and felt his long awaited climax, his little erect dick twitching as waves of intense pleasure coursed through his body. But, there was no fountain of ejaculation, as Brett might expect, only a immature trickle of clear fluid that rejoined the water he was floating in.<br />
<br />
His mind still a hazy mix of fear, arousal, and excitement, Brett dragged himself out of the pond and slumped down at the water’s edge, while the Jungle King looked down upon him with a proud smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“There. You are now ready to learn the true nature of the jungle. For you are now one of its people, its native tribe,” he proclaimed, the magic around him beginning to fade.<br />
<br />
Brett’s eyes went wide and he pulled himself to his feet and gazed at his reflection in the water. The blond, blue-eyed face he was so familiar with was gone, vanished into the air thanks to the King’s magic. Instead, there was a young boy, barely ten years old at the most, with brown skin, black eyes, and dark brown hair that grew in frizzy twisted locks that hung around his shoulders. His features were round and soft, with a certain exotic tinge that was definitely not there when Brett had woken up that morning. He was, to the casual observer, a native of the jungle, his naked body showing off his dark skin and native features clearly.<br />
<br />
“You… What you? How you do? Me different…! Why me talk weird…?” Brett exclaimed, his voice now high and chirpy like a young boy’s but also coming out slowly and unsurely. He struggled to remember how to speak with proper grammar and vocabulary, but it seemed like anything but the most basic sentences were now beyond his grasp.<br />
<br />
“You will learn. There is so much for you to learn, in fact,” the Jungle King said, now speaking in a low, rhythmic language that Brett found himself understanding easily. “You are a new member of this jungle tribe. And someday, if you earn your place, you might learn a tiny glimmer of the truth of the jungle and of my magic. But that day won’t be for a long, long time. Will it, little boy?”<br />
<br />
The Jungle King smirked and laughed as the little tribal boy that was once Brett just stared at himself in shock...</p>
