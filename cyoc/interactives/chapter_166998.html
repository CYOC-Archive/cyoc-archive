<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt pushed the fear aside as he took in the immense image of himself in the hallway mirror.<br />
&quot;I have to try and get smaller!&quot; he said to himself. <br />
Matt made his way to the master bedroom and sat gingerly down on the bed, awkwardly spreading his legs as his huge muscle gut got in the way of his large quads.<br />
<br />
&quot;CONCENTRATE,&quot; he thought to himself, willing his body to shrink back to it&#39;s normal size, &quot;c&#39;mon, go back to normal!&quot;<br />
Over the course of the next thirty minutes, Matt concentrated as hard as he could, willing his body back to it&#39;s original state.  Through this intense concentration, he succeeded in bringing his body from a swollen and immense 550 pounds on his average 5&#39;9&quot; frame, to a relatively normal, though still much larger than his earlier size, 245 pounds.  Also, with a huge sigh of relief, he noticed his once bulbous muscle belly had shrunk to be a very flat and desirable 6-pack with a nice V-taper from his wide shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank goodness!&quot; Matt thought, &quot;it&#39;s working!&quot;  <br />
He then moved quickly into the bathroom to weigh himself and take in his form in the mirror.  After noting the 245 pounds, and checking himself out, he realized he was about 45 pounds heavier than he had been that morning, and thought that since his wife, Janet, wouldn&#39;t be home until evening, he would have plenty of time to return to normal before she arrived home.<br />
<br />
He returned to the bedroom, kicked off his sneakers and socks and changed into a pair of boxer shorts this time (his former pair of boxer briefs having been stretched and torn slightly), and pulled on a fairly loose-fitting tank top.  He then laid down on the bed to try and get rid of the remaining 45 pounds before Janet returned home.<br />
<br />
As he lay there concentrating, the extreme events from the day weighed heavily on him, and he quickly dozed off.<br />
<br />
After about an hour, he was awoken with a start as he heard the front door fly open and Janet yelling, <br />
&quot;MATT?!  MATT!!  WHERE ARE YOU??  ARE YOU ALRIGHT???&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH SHIT!&quot; Matt thought  to himself, &quot;why is she home so early?!&quot; glancing at the clock, she was home at least 3 hours earlier than she should have been.  He also glanced down at his body and realized he had lost no more weight than earlier and was still a fairly large man at 245 pounds. <br />
&quot;Janet is definitely going to notice my size!&quot; Matt thought in a panic, looking around for options as he heard Janet coming up the stairs, still calling for him, &quot;Matt?!  The neighbors called and said they saw you come home from Cray&#39;s house, and that you looked... ill... or different.  I tried calling you, but Cray answered and said you had left his house in a hurry... are you alri...&quot;<br />
<br />
During this, Matt had risen from the bed and was still trying to think of what to do, having finally realized he should hide in the bathroom, only a moment too late.  Janet swung the door open and saw him standing there, wearing only the boxer shorts, pulled tight by his larger frame and the tank top, hugging his large chest and lats.<br />
<br />
She stared for a moment collecting herself as Matt stared back standing awkwardly with his large arms at his sides and his muscled thighs pressed together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matt... what happened to you??&quot;  Janet said slowly and carefully as she gazed at her husband&#39;s considerably larger body.  As she spoke, she slowly moved toward him.  Matt instinctively tried to cover himself, moving his arms in front of himself uncomfortably (and with futility) trying to cover up his large body, but only aiding in making it seem large by the rippling in his arms and chest.<br />
&quot;I...  I...&quot; Matt began as he tried to think of a reasonably explanation for why he was now 45 pounds heavier with muscle than he was that morning when Janet left for her shift as a nurse at the hospital.  He was coming up blank, and decided to tell the truth, as weird as it sounded.  He started to explain, and was cut off around the time that he mentioned the ointment and Cray and Guy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, this is amazing!&quot;  Janet stated as she had now reached him and moved her small hands up to his muscled biceps and pecs.  She felt around his traps, and obliques, tracing around his hardened nipples as she did worked her way down, her mouth watering as she felt his newly muscled body beneath the tank top.  She reached down and rubbed her hands across his large thighs, letting her fingers rise and fall with the tongues of overlapping beef that made up his well-sized quads.  She reached behind him and gripped his large ass, pulling him closer.  &quot;You are so damn hot!&quot; she said, standing on tip-toe to kiss him.<br />
<br />
Matt, taken aback by this reaction, returned the kiss, his mind reeling with desire as his wife ministered to his body.<br />
<br />
What Matt had failed to remember was what had first attracted Janet to him in the first place.  The couple had met in college, when Matt was the star quarterback for his University&#39;s football team.  Matt had been in similar shape to what he was now, though somewhat smaller at a still weighty 225 pounds.  Janet was a member of the gymnastics team and would often workout in the student fitness center at the same time as Matt.  She was highly attracted to alpha-males with large bodies, and Matt&#39;s physique had fit the bill perfectly.  Their attraction was mutual immediately as she possessed then, and still maintained, a tight gymnast&#39;s body.  Matt had suffered a fairly bad knee injury in his junior year, and never quite maintained his physical prowess, dropping to around 200 pounds and an average build.  By then, Matt and Janet&#39;s relationship had gone beyond physical, and while she always missed his alpha body, she loved him just the same.  They were married a couple years later.  Janet had never forgotten Matt&#39;s body&#39;s glory days, however.  She would often imagine Matt back at his prime (though they were both only 30 years old) while they had sex.  She missed the feeling of the rock-hard muscles wrapping themselves around her while they made love.  <br />
<br />
And now, here he was, nearly a decade later, back and EVEN BIGGER than he had been in college.  Janet couldn&#39;t get enough, her lust overtaking her quickly.  She pushed her large husband back on the bed, Matt falling on his back with his knees hanging off the edge.  Janet reached down and fished his swelling dick from his boxer shorts, and then ripped off her scrubs and panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;TAKE ME NOW.&quot;  She demanded of her husband as she lowered herself onto his now stiff member.  As she maneuvered on his cock, she let her hands wander all over Matt&#39;s body, feeling his hard six-pack under the tank top, moving her hands up and down his arms, and kissing him intensely.  He was lost in bliss as he gripped her tightly by the thighs watching her C-cups bounce in her bra above him.  He closed his eyes as he drank in the pleasure.<br />
<br />
While they were going at it, Janet reached back and felt up Matt&#39;s large quads.  She briefly, and subconsciously imagined between her thoughts of lust and pleasure, &quot;if only Matt&#39;s dick were about 2 inches bigger, it would be the perfect fit for my pussy...&quot; As she thought this, something happened that no one, not even Mr. Yuan back at the Ointment Store, thought was possible.  Her subconscious desire had an effect on MATT&#39;S body.  This was a previously unknown property of the ointment that Guy had originally tried out a day earlier.  That a soulmate could also have an effect on the user of the ointment&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
What happened was exactly what you&#39;d expect:  Matt&#39;s cock swelled slightly larger to be about 2 inches longer, and slightly heftier in girth.  Janet, only vaguely aware this had happened, gasped in pleasure as she felt the member swell inside her.  She had never felt such intense pleasure in her life, and she bobbed faster on the now larger dick.  Matt, lost in pleasure, was nearly completely unaware of this change, but he did appreciate the renewed vigor of her ministrations<br />
<br />
This new development, only drove Janet&#39;s subconscious mind into overdrive now that the first wish had been fulfilled.  As her hands continued to explore Matt&#39;s bodybuilder-body, she couldn&#39;t stop her subconscious from wondering what it would be like if Matt&#39;s body was... bigger.  And so she dreamt of this as she continued bouncing on his dick, and Matt continued thrusting.<br />
<br />
And the properties of the ointment, once again became clear.  Matt&#39;s body responded to Janet&#39;s subconscious desires, and began to expand.  His already pro-bodybuilder-sized body puffed and swelled with each deep breath Matt took in.  His arms grew to the size of footballs, shoulders to melons, his neck starting to disappear into his traps.  Meanwhile, his legs went into overdrive, along with his bulbous ass, as they all inflated larger and larger.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s eyes snapped open as he felt the familiar sensations of his body outgrowing his clothes.  The tank top was now skin-tight, wrapped tightly around his huge pecs and his slightly bowing abs.  The straps of the tank top dug into the crevice between his rainbow-shaped traps and his watermelon-sized shoulders.  Meanwhile, his legs were nearing the point of outgrowing his boxer shorts.  The material of his shorts was less forgiving than the previous pair of boxer briefs and were already snapping seams around the cuff of the shorts.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s mind raced, &quot;what&#39;s going on?!&quot; he thought between grunts of pleasure, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m in control of this thing now, but my body is growing again!!&quot;<br />
Matt looked back up at Janet as she feverishly ran her hands all over his swelling frame as it pumped larger and larger, almost in tune to her bouncing and his breathing at the same time.  Her eyes were closed and she bit her lower lip in pleasure as she moaned.  He figured it out in seconds, despite being moments away from orgasm.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s JANET!&quot; Matt thought, &quot;She&#39;s controlling my body&#39;s size!&quot;  And that was the final coherent thought Matt had as waves of pleasure racked him.  As he pumped larger and larged beneath Janet&#39;s thrusting, Matt shot his load into her receiving pussy just as his tank top split open down middle and his boxer shorts ripped open from the size of his enormous ass and quads.  His waistband had also snapped at the same time from his prodigious muscle gut which had appeared again.<br />
<br />
Janet, simultaneously orgasming, tumbled off the much-larger body to Matt&#39;s side, sighed with absolute contentment, completely unaware of what she had done to Matt.<br />
<br />
Matt grunted as he heaved himself forward and up off the bed, the remains of his tank top and boxer shorts falling off him as he stood, thighs pressing together and huge ham-sized arms hanging off his sides.  He rested his beefy hands on his protruding gut, which was now only slightly bigger than his enormous pecs and looked down at his wife.  He wasn&#39;t sure, but he guessed he had gained at least 200 pounds, putting him at a scale-tipping 445 pounds.  He was able to move freely, but with difficulty and he was completely out of breath, both from his large body making it a challenge to rise from the bed, and from the intense sex he had just had with his wife.<br />
<br />
Janet lay panting on the bed eyes closed in contentment as she wiped sweat from her forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jan...&quot; Matt began, looking down at her over his monstrous heaving chest, &quot;babe, look at me.  It happened again...&quot;<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s eyes fluttered open as she took in her gargantuan husband, and she sucked in a large breath as she was once again overcome with lust.</p>
