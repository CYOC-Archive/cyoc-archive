<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Seemed like you wanted this one, JLTF. Cyoc.net now has a discord, by the way. https://discord.gg/2wduNWqeV8</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“A Ferrari.” Finn said confidently.<br />
<br />
“No.”<br />
<br />
“The anthropomorphic personification of the number 49.” Finn said.<br />
<br />
“Also no.”<br />
<br />
“Anthro Jet.” The burly ram smirked.<br />
<br />
“...I meant animal, jackass.” Jeff rolled his eyes. “We’ve kinda got a pattern going here. Football team mascots. Bengals, Rams, he pointed at Greg. Lions.”<br />
<br />
“A Buccaneer. No, a Viking.” Finn grinned, knowing he was annoying Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Are you taking this seriously?” Jeff demanded. “We’ve got Bears, Longhorns-so bull, horse for the Mustangs, Buffaloes, Panthers-”<br />
<br />
“Dolphin.”<br />
<br />
“Please…!” Jeff rubbed his forehead. “Not a goddamn dolphin! I will not make a man-made horror.”<br />
<br />
The young men on the couch were stripping naked. Finn eyed Greg’s massive, golden furred body in appreciation. His cock even had little nubs on it. That might be fun to ride. Why not give Chuck the honor of being Greg’s first fuck?<br />
<br />
“Pfft. Fine. Otter.” Finn said. “I considered bear but we already have enough  fat, hairy, middle-aged guys around here. It’d be pretty redundant. Plus I think Todd counts?”<br />
<br />
“Pandas are herbivores.” Jeff countered. “But thank you. It doesn’t really fit the theme, but…Start recording.”<br />
<br />
“Recording?”<br />
<br />
“So we can see if the shift is visible. We assume cameras won’t see the change, but is that really true?”<br />
<br />
“Fine, I’ll shoot your new porno.” Finn sighed and pulled out his phone. “Is Chuck going to be a top or a bottom?”<br />
<br />
Jeff thought about it. “Bottom. It’s funnier that way.”<br />
<br />
He turned his attention back to his computer. [What would you like to change?] Blinked on the screen. Jeff typed in his changes. When the [Awareness] window pop up, Jeff altered the parameters so everyone except him was mostly unaware at 20%. Not out of spite, but out of curiosity. Could reality shifts be identified on video recording if you knew what to look for?<br />
<br />
Jeff didn’t want to alarm any of the other guys in the room, but he couldn’t be the only person in the world with a Chronivac. What if someone turned everyone into dogs or something? That was a scary thought. He wanted to have a fail-safe in place to prevent that. As soon as he figured out how to properly work the thing. Every time he opened the Chronivac, a new option seemed to appear.<br />
<br />
He double checked his intended changes, hearing moans coming from his bed, then clicked enter.<br />
<br />
The handsome, tawny-maned lion man lifted the smaller human’s legs over his shoulders, exposing the soft pink flesh of Chuck’s ass. The young black man below him stared at the barbed cock, eyes wide in horror. Greg positioned himself…then paused and looked over at Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Got some lube? Bout to fuck some prime boipussy.” Greg growled.<br />
<br />
Jeff tossed him some lotion from his desk. The lion caught it with one claw, not even looking at it, deftly unspooled the cap and squeezed it into his hand. Then he tossed the lube back to Jeff.<br />
<br />
“Uh, Jeff, they’re about to fuck on your bed.” Finn murmured.<br />
<br />
So what if they were about to fuck on his-oh, new sheets. Shit. His dad would be so pissed if he ruined more of the Egyptian cotton sheets. Sure they were rich, but that shit was expensive.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” Jeff spoke up suddenly.<br />
<br />
Greg looked up. “What?”<br />
<br />
Jeff tossed him some towels. “Don’t get lube on my sheets, bro.”<br />
<br />
Greg grinned. “Sorry man. You ready, babe?”<br />
<br />
Chuck’s nose was darkening as he shook his head. “I don’t wanna bottom, man. It hurts.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to the computer and started making adjustments. <br />
<br />
Behind him on the bed, Greg was back to dominating the shorter man, nuzzling and licking his neck. Chuck’s cock was hard and he was moaning into the barrage of licks and nuzzles. Sprouting whiskers twitched in pleasure. The muscular lion shifted his maw downwards and continued licking, lapping at the man’s furrier body as sleek brown fur twitched and spread across his skin. <br />
<br />
With a gasp from Chuck, they saw the base of his spine press out, muscles reshaping, tugging the young man’s anus around, repositioning it. The long, muscular otter tail grew a short coat of oily fur. The lion purred and began to gently stroke it, causing the tail to twitch.<br />
<br />
“Like that?” Greg asked.<br />
<br />
Chuck nodded. “Y-yeah.”<br />
<br />
The lion bent over and kissed the man’s mouth. When he lifted away, the man’s face followed, extending into a short muzzle. Chuck stared up at the big muscles of the tiger with longing and lust. The lion gently prodded the ottery man’s virgin hole. It was tight, but the lion ground his cock against it nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Chuck groaned as the second transformation Jeff had just executed hit. <br />
<br />
Finn and Jeff watched Chuck’s asshole spasmed and suddenly loosened, tight pucker slackening and becoming puffy. The furry little man moaned lewdly, his eyes rolling in his head. Greg took the opportunity and pushed forward a little, his  tip resting against Chuck’s softly clenching tail-hole. <br />
<br />
“You sure you don’t want to bottom?” Greg rubbed the otter’s muzzle gently with his claws as Chuck’s puffy ring lipped the huge cock at his rear entrance.<br />
<br />
“F…fuck me!” Chuck mewled.<br />
<br />
“With pleasure!” Greg snarled and the lion man thrust.<br />
<br />
The shaft buried itself into the otter’s anus. Chuck’s ring seemed to welcome it, blooming open around the feline length, undulating rhythmically. Jeff could see the otter’s ring pulse and squeeze, practically sucking the tiger’s barbed cock deeper into him like a hungry maw. He smiled. Perfect.<br />
<br />
Greg pushed further and deeper into the lithe otter below him, moaning as Chuck clenched his ass, milking the jock’s barbed cock. The lion man threw his head back and shook out his luscious man, chuffing the ottery musk in the air. Chuck’s ears rounded and moved to the top of his head, though the otter seemed to be paying too much attention to the delightful sensations in his ass to care.<br />
<br />
“God, your fur is silky smooth.” Greg growled, running his paws down his new boyfriend’s form. <br />
<br />
As he did, the otter man’s head compressed and grew streamlined, the shape carrying through the rest of his body, torso stretching longer like taffy. Then, with a groan from Chuck, every muscle group in the otters body bulged, becoming toned and girthy enough to see them through the otter’s thick pelt. His cock shrunk and his testes grew rounder and less egg-shaped, pulling up tightly just below the otter’s anus.<br />
<br />
There was a beep from the computer signaling that the otter transformation was over. Jeff smiled, watching the two lovers fuck playfully on the bed. The otter writhing happily beneath his muscular lion lover. Whatever problems that had been between them before were clearly gone now, as the otter appeared to be riding the lion’s cock like a champ.<br />
<br />
Feral, musky scents filled the room. Finn was jerking himself off slowly, phone still out. Jeff’s own paw wandered to his cock and he gently rubbed his barbs. He yowled, hissing and spitting, precum running down his thigh. Finn noticed and got down on his knees between Jeff’s muscular thighs. The ram kept his eyes on Jeff’s as his wide muzzle engulfed the tiger’s turgid shaft.<br />
<br />
Jeff gasped. The ram began to bob, and Jeff moaned as he lost himself to the gentle suckling of the ram’s warm, moist mouth. He came so suddenly he hadn’t even realized that he was near orgasm.<br />
<br />
The ram pulled off his softening cock and licked his lips. Behind them, the otter and lion reached an undulating crescendo. Then the lion roared and Jeff could see his thick cock half-thrust inside the otter pulse as warm seed filled the otter’s tight stomach, making it bulge. The otter let out a warbling cry and semen drizzled across his abs and pecs and up into his muzzle.<br />
<br />
As the couple basked on the bed in exultation and exhaustion, Jeff gestured for the phone in Finn’s hand. The ram looked at it as though he’d suddenly realized it was there, then sheepishly handed it to Jeff. Jeff stopped the recording and rewound it. He handed it back to Finn.<br />
<br />
“I changed something. Try to see if you can tell what it is from only the video.”<br />
<br />
“Okay?” Finn said questioningly, but took the camera back and watched the video, pawing himself as he did so. “Uh, how am I supposed to tell?”<br />
<br />
“Just look for anything weird that catches your eye about a minute in.” Jeff replied<br />
<br />
Finn played the video all the way through twice. Nothing. Just a sexy twinky otter getting plowed by his muscular, well-hung lion boyfriend. He paused at the moment just before penetration, frowning.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jeff.” Finn showed him the phone. “Look.”<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at the video. The otter’s asshole is tight one second and then, suddenly, puffy and loose the next, as though he’d been well-used.<br />
<br />
“That’s it.” Jeff smiled. “We finally found a bug.”<br />
<br />
“So?”<br />
<br />
Jeff pointed at the screen and grinned.<br />
<br />

“Let’s see what the upgrade has to offer. The muscular tiger chuckled to himself, preening his head fur.</p>
