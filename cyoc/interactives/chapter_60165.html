<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is so lame, Julie,&quot; Joy complained, tugging her sister's sleeve. &quot;Let's just go home. We can still catch <br />
something on tv.&quot;<br />
Julie did not argue, not having really wanted to go to the carnival in the first place, so the girls headed <br />
out of the fenced grounds and began walking toward the road to go home. Then Julie stopped and looked around, <br />
getting her bearings.<br />
&quot;Joy, we can cut through the park. Its a lot faster. I don't know why we didn't do that on the way here.&quot;<br />
They turned left, heading to the heavily wooded park separating the carnival grounds from the edge of town.<br />
&quot;What about my car, Sis?&quot;<br />
&quot;We can walk back and get it tomorrow. I just feel like walking,&quot; Julie responded energetically.<br />
It wasn't long until they were out of sight of the lights of the carnival and the sounds had dwindled to a <br />
distant murmur, allowing them to hear the quiet sounds of the woods. Leaves and twigs crunched under their <br />
tennis shoes as they made their way between the trees. The night was clear and crisp. Cool, but not too cold, <br />
and peaceful. Despite their slight personality differences, the twins - as twins occasionally are - were best <br />
friends. They were rather popular, being attractive and friendly, but preferred each other's company over <br />
anyone else's. Tonight was no different as they walked quietly, just enjoying the freedom and solitude. Then <br />
Joy started lagging a little, her shoes irritating her feet for some reason. The were relatively new, worn <br />
just enough to be comfortable (most of the time anyway), but still retaining the off the shelf appearance. <br />
Julie was still ok in her black and white sandals. The Adidas slides were her favorite casual shoes when she <br />
didn't HAVE to wear something with a closed toe. Finally Joy couldn't take it anymore and stopped, leaning <br />
against a tree to kick her shoe off and see what was wrong, thinking she had a rock in the toe or something. <br />
Julie followed her over, impatient to be moving again.<br />
&quot;You ok, Sis?&quot;<br />
Joy was holding her shoe upside down and shaking it, but nothing had come out yet. Neither of the girls had <br />
noticed how bright the night seemed, even under the boughs of the trees. Joy dropped her shoe and stood up, <br />
leaning against the trunk with her eyes closed, her unshod left foot resting on top of her right which was <br />
still in its shoe. <br />
&quot;I don't get it,&quot; she griped, &quot;there's nothing in there, but the damn thing just doesn't feel right all of a <br />
sudden.&quot;<br />
Julie shrugged as she responded, &quot;Maybe walking wasn't such a great idea. But it's a nice night and we don't <br />
have to be home for another 3 hours. Let's take a break. It's been a long time since we just hung out in the <br />
woods like this.&quot;<br />
&quot;What the hell,&quot; Joy answered. &quot;You're right.&quot;<br />
She kicked off her other shoe as they sat down and rested her heels on the leather sneakers to keep her brand <br />
new white socks from dragging in the dirt. The girls laid back, resting their heads beside each other on <br />
crossed arms, staring at the trees above them as they made small talk, just catching up on whatever may be new <br />
in each other's lives. <br />
Neither noticed the slight tearing sounds as their toenails poke small holes in the ends of their matching <br />
white socks that ended just above their ankles. Neither noticed the slight clacking sounds as lengthening <br />
eyeteeth tapped against each other as they talked. Neither noticed anything odd until they turned their heads <br />
to look at each other and each exclaimed at the same instant: &quot;What the hell!?! Why are your eyes yellow?&quot;<br />
Before either could say anything else, they both convulsed, rolling toward each other instinctively as they <br />
curled up, groaning in sudden pain. <br />
They grasped each other's arms, whimpering as lengthening claws cut through the sleeves of their shirts and <br />
into skin as they held each other tightly. Ears slowly wormed their way out of their thick hair, growing <br />
longer and wider, the now pointed tips twitching as they moved slowly up the girls' heads. Widow's peaks <br />
slowly grew down their foreheads as small tufts of light brown and blonde fur sprouted along cheeks, jaws and <br />
the backs of their hands. The whimpers began sounding more like grunts as loud tearing sounds were heard, <br />
caused by tails ripping through the backs of their matching medium blue jeans under their matching pink <br />
studded leather belts. Torsos began to heave, clawed hands/paws gripping tighter to each other as their <br />
muscles began to expand, straining the seams of their clothing. <br />
They opened identical tear filled, amber colored eyes, watching each other as they realized that the magician <br />
hadn't been such a phony after all, and that they now carried a horrible curse. But neither was completely <br />
despondent as they also realized that no matter what happened to them after tonight, they were still together.<br />
The grunts turned slowly to growls as their heads began to widen, the foreheads sloping back, compressing <br />
their still-human brains. Noses turned black and moist as their faces began to pull forward, bones cracking <br />
and reforming as their noses and mouths fused and lengthened into lupine muzzles, filled with razor sharp <br />
fangs. Brown and blonde fur spread slowly across their growing bodies. Muscles continued to expand, snapping <br />
their bras apart a fraction of a second before their torsos ripped through their nearly identical shirts, <br />
Joy's red one and Julie's blue one held together by a few stubborn threads at key points along the shoulders <br />
and hemlines. Rips forming at the knees and along the leg seams of their jeans as their now muscular, fur-<br />
covered haunches grew too large for the tough denim to contain. The tiny holes in the ends of their soft thick <br />
socks grew larger as the new claws grew longer and sharper, the loose cotton growing tight as the arches of <br />
their feet got longer, pushing not just the claws but the toes of their growing limbs through the holes before <br />
the white cloth tore completely, the feet cracking as they formed digitigrade wolfish paws. Human minds began <br />
to fade and animal instincts took over as the huge creatures clambered to their hind legs, and howled their <br />
pain and grief at the trees overhead, the only thing left from their former lives was their twin bond, <br />
translating to their new feral minds as &quot;Pack&quot;. Infectious saliva dripping from their fangs, they looked at <br />
each other for a long time before continuing the way they had been travelling before, eager to recruit new <br />
sisters.<br />
Other than the nearly unrecognizable rags still clinging to their bodies, the only trace of the beautiful <br />
young girls they had once been was an almost new pair of white and silver Adidas tennis shoes and a black and <br />
white pair of sandals left laying in the dirt. Joy and Julie were nothing but a memory....<br />
With one more long</p>
