<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joshua tried to take off Nick&#39;s t-shirt but for some reason it was very tight to him.<br />
I thought you said you found clothes that fit you. Joshua said to Raul. His t-shirt is too thight.<br />
I don&#39;t get it. Raul said. He told me that t-shirt fits him perfectly. Could he be lying?<br />
I don&#39;t know. Joshua said. But we can&#39;t do anything else. Let&#39;s go back to sleep.<br />
Umm... ok. I just hope he won&#39;t push me again. Raul said.<br />
They were moving back to their places when they smell something weird.<br />
Hey Joshua. Do you smell that? Raul said. It&#39;s like a strong body odor.<br />
Sorry, it could be me. Joshua apologized. I used a little bit of deodorant but these bushes sweat a lot. He lifted his arms and showed his hairy armpits to Raul.<br />
Please, don&#39;t show me that... Raul said. But... you&#39;re not reeking.<br />
Well, if it&#39;s not me... then... Joshua said slowly but then, both guys realized what it could be.<br />
Nick! They said at unison and turned their sight to the boy on the bed.<br />
At the moment they looked at the guy, a weird sound came from Nick&#39;s gut followed by a fart. It wasn&#39;t loudly like Joshua&#39;s but it was longer, like a whistle. Then, Nick began to grow.<br />
His body was increasing quickly, his legs were elongating until his pants covered just a half of them. Muscles start to appear and his bulging thigh made his pants to look even smaller. His feet were on a similar change, they began to grow wide and longer, his toes became flatter and manlier as they lost the baby fat. Joshua thought how similar they looked to his own feet.<br />
Raul was looking how Nick&#39;s arms were elongating too, his hands were growing until they looked meaty and strong. His arms got biceps and his shoulder turn wider, it looked like he was hiding balloons under his very thight t-shirt which now can&#39;t covered Nick&#39;s elbows.<br />
With chest growth, they saw how Nick&#39;s t-shirt was moving up and revealing his belly. Two solid pecs began to sport on him, like bricks perfectly defined by the t-shirt&#39;s fabric. Also, abs started to form as his back became wider.<br />
He was the double or even the triple bigger than before. His body was occupying almost all the bed and he hadn&#39;t finished yet. His neck, who used to be thin, began to wide until it was difficult to see where it stops and Nick&#39;s face begins. About that, his face began to look manlier, his jaw got squarer and his nose grew a little bit. Finally, hair began to be visible on him as a shadow covered his jaw and sideburns, it moved down to his neck and went under his t-shirt which was struggling whit Nick&#39;s new frame. It covered his chest and his upper arms, but hair was visible in the rest of his arms, including his now manly hands. The hair moved downward his t-shirt until it&#39;s visible a thick treasure trail on Nick&#39;s belly which kept going down to where Joshua knew was Nick&#39;s new Bush. Finally, hair appeared on the uncovered part of his legs and over his manly feet. Nick was a very hairy guy who now looked like a college guy like Joshua.<br />
It hasn&#39;t ended. Raul said and he was right. In Nick&#39;s crotch three bubbles began to grow under his tight pants, they grew to monstruous proportions specially one which looked like a big salami under Nick&#39;s pants. It lengthened through his left leg until it reach his knee. It&#39;s shape was perfectly defined as it&#39;s mushroom head and some veins were clearly visible through the fabric.<br />
He grew up just like me... Joshua finally said. Raul was too astounded that he didn&#39;t said anything. Joshua was impacted f how big and hairy was Nick now and he wondered if his friends looked him that way when he grew in the pool. After that a moment of silence covered the place until Nick made a small moan with his new baritone voice.<br />
I think we must leave him to sleep. Joshua said. We&#39;ll talk with him in the morning.<br />
Raul nodded but then he realized he hadn&#39;t a place to sleep. Nick was taking the whole bed now.<br />
You&#39;ll sleep in the floor like me. Joshua said and they lay down on the floor.</p>
