<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What'd you do to me?&quot; demanded Tony, still wrestling with Jeff, but Jeff, who was quickly gaining the upper hand, noticed Tony's giant penis across the keyboard.  <br />
&quot;You did it to yourself with your own johnson&quot; Jeff snickered as he threw Tony back to the middle of the room.  He could push Tony around now because he was shrinking.  Retaining his exact human shape, Tony shrank in just a few seconds to a standing height of just over two feet.<br />
&quot;Oh shit&quot; he muttered softly.  He could feel all sorts of changes starting inside him as he turned to face the mirror.  His shoulders narrowed and his trunk shortened.  At the same time, his legs lengthened to take up a much greater percentage of his height.  His fingers and toes stretched and widened.  Long flat nails stretched out from each digit.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What am I becoming?&quot; he asked Jeff frantically.<br />
Jeff smirked.  &quot;You'll see.  It's not bad&quot;<br />
Tony felt a thousand pinpricks across his body and a fine coat of fur grew over him.  As this was happening, a tail started growing quickly out of the top of Tony's tiny little ass.  It wasn't especially thick, but it just kept growing, longer and longer.  Tony had unthinkingly fallen into a posture of sitting on his haunches appropriate for his new species.  His new tail stretched straight up higher than his head.  Tony felt control of this new limb integrate into his still human mind and whipped his tail back and forth.  A second later, he watched, after the same feeling of a thousand pinpricks over its surface, as fur, in a series of black and white rings, more than a dozen of them, sprouted over the full length of his new tiller.  The fur on his tail stuck almost straight out, giving Tony's new 1 inch thick tail the appearance of being 5 inches thick.  The rest of his fur was light gray except for white over his belly, chest and face with black spots over his now bright orange eyes and around the muzzle of his wet black nose and his mouth.  Tony's ears grew out a bit from his head and his face became a pointed muzzle and he was complete.  He was a young male lemur.<br />
<br />
Tony let out an angry screech over his shoulder at Jeff and approached the mirror.  He marveled at his new appearance.  His face and his movements with his black palmed hands were so human.  He opened his mouth and saw his grooming teeth in his lower jaw.  He sniffed.  He detected his own scent glands at his wrists and, with another sniff, just below his tail.  They were ever so slightly different.  But that wasn't hard for Tony to discern now.  His lemur nose seemed as sensitive as his greyhound snout had been.  Raising his head and spinning around, he found he could turn his head almost a full circle, he sniffed and could identify lingering traces of Cindy's perfume and the Super Sugar Crisp he and Mark had had for breakfast.<br />
<br />
The recollection stirred Tony's hunger.  Out of the corner of an orange eye, Tony saw a squadron of ants coming out of the farthest corner of the room at the ceiling.  Tony leaped for the corner, making it easily and slamming into the corner with his lemur feet and snatching away the ants with one lightning fast swip of his right hand.  He delivered them into his mouth and hungrily chewed on them as he bounced back to land, without any disruption, on the desk beside Jeff's laptop.  Jeff smirked at the sight of Tony chewing the ants with delight and explained his new body to Tony from the chronivac summary, but Tony was distracted by the sight of a tree full of luscious leaves just outside his window.  Tony only caught the last part of it &quot;. . your sister's pet for the next 9 days.  That's what you are, your sister's pet&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony snapped out of his leaf lust, letting out a screech.  My sister's pet!  Wait a minute!  Why don't you just change me back now?  He tapped one almost human finger on the laptop and then nodded at Jeff with a screech.  Before Jeff could respond, though, the door, already ajar, slammed wide open.  As Tony watched, in shock, the room reformed around them.  There was no Tony St. Martin or his bedroom.  The room became a hard plastic walled, rubber mat floored lemur room with three different trapeze bars at three different heights.  Tony was now sitting on a square wood block and not a desk.  On a shelf halfway up the wall was a dish with water and overflowing with leaves.  Tony's orange eyes went wide.  He immediately solved the puzzle of how to get to it and jumped up to the highest trapeze.  He dropped off the bar hanging by his tail and twisted his body to have his head and gullet upright as he held onto the shelf on which the dish rested and greedily chewed through a score of leaves.  <br />
<br />
Cindy laughed.  &quot;It's . . Jeff, right?  What brings you here to our monkey room?&quot;  She said and casually slapped a thick leather collar on Tony's neck.  The collar was attached to a thick leash.  Jeff was busy putting away his chronivac running laptop and emitter.<br />
&quot;Taking digital picture of little Tony?&quot; she asked pointing at the emitter then patting her morphed older brother's little ass and running her hand over his tail.<br />
<br />
His hunger sated, lemur Tony finally noticed that a collar with a 5 foot leash had been slapped on him.  Hey!  Get this off me!  Tony let out a screech, but his sister patted his head and, to his amazement, Tony found himself calming.  He felt obedient to his master, his sister.  The moment he screeched, she ran her hands over the fine fur of his head, between the ears and cooed &quot;Tony, Tony, Tony what's wrong little monkeywonkey?&quot;  To Tony's horror, like an automatic override, her soothing tone and touch made him behave instantly.<br />
<br />
Jeff shrugged.  &quot;9 days&quot; he murmured to his friend the monkey.  Cindy didn't pay him any attention, she was still busy cuddling with her humiliated former older brother.  She turned to Jeff &quot;The people at the zoo want to take my Tonywony.  They say he needs to play with other monkeys but he's just fine right here&quot;.<br />
&quot;I-I can see that&quot; said Jeff and he sheepishly picked up his computer and left with a final shrug at Tony as Cindy locked the other end of the leash to a bar bolted onto the wall.  Cindy stepped away and Tony's anger at this state of affairs suddenly burst forth.  He screeched his loudest and yanked over and over at his collar, the leash and the bar on the wall with all the might of his 2 foot high body.  He continued his frantic hysterics, leaping and pulling and screeching for 10 minutes before finally relenting.  He saw Cindy and then his mother, father and brother looking at him with worried expressions through the plexiglass window of the thick door.  Tony looked for some sign that his brother knew what was up.  He got it when Mark shrugged as if to say &quot;sorry bro&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Tony spent the remaining hours before sleeping trying to figure out his options.  He lept around the room a bit, amazed at his agility.  &quot;I wonder what I can do out in the open&quot; he wondered looking at his furry little body.  There didn't seem to be any chance of finding out the next day.  To Tony's continuing humiliation, Cindy swooped right in and picked him up in the morning.  Amid coos and petting of his little body, she informed him that she was going to show him off at the high school that day.<br />
<br />
Under almost compelled obedience to his master, Tony found himself sitting on Cindy's shoulder as she walked through school, the object of everyone's attention.  Cindy paraded him to the front of her first class and commanded Tony to jump off onto the teacher's desk.  She gave a brief lecture about lemurs and and invited everyone to pet little Tony.  Tony grumbled inwardly at how all the idiots demeaned him but outwardly just placidly accepted it.  All he could do without being detected was to squirt his scent glands at the ones who were particularly annoying.  The girl patting his wrist just thought his fur had been wet.  The girl persistently rubbing the base of his tail thought he'd pissed on her.<br />
<br />
Tony had to sit through six more such session, including one at the end of the day in the teachers' staff room.  That was where Tony made his break.  Cindy had backpedaled to the wall by the entrance door.  When she was within 5 feet, Tony felt powerless to be disobedient to his master.  She was now 15 feet away.  <br />
<br />
With no screech or any other kind of warning, Tony leaped over the shoulder of the fat french teacher for the window a dozen feet away.  He made it on the fly, his leash flapping behind him.  Before anyone could grab it, Tony flipped down two levers and pulled the window squeaky window open just enough to squeeze out.  He let out a screech of pride and scampered along the ground as fast as he could.  He stopped for just a moment to try and remove the leach from his collar.  He barely had the dexterity and hand strength to do it.  He let out another screech of triumph and hurled it away from himself.  To his surprise, he was confronted by two security guards, just short of rounding the corner of the building.  <br />
&quot;Whadda we do?&quot; asked one fat pseudo cop of the other.  &quot;Do we shoot a monkey?&quot;<br />
Tony glanced quicksilver fast at the building.  Two stories?  Maybe with a head start.  He ran and leaped onto one shocked guard using him as a springboard to leap onto the roof.  Tony got the edge with his extra long fingers and pulled his body up to the rough tar surface.  From there, he ran across the roof and leaped onto a nearby tree.  <br />
<br />
Tony was home free now.  The bumbling security guards ran around the side of the building but only caught a glimpse of simian Tony at the top of the tree canopy leaping 30 feet and more from branch to branch with effortless grace.  <br />
<br />
For 9 more days, the police then animal protection society then zoo personnel tried to catch Tony.  He toyed with them.  Any time he was sighted, they would try and circle the area.  But Tony could look down and see whoever had spotted him and the excitement in their eyes, if not also hear their words.  The zoo personnel were really no better than the cops or local animal people.  They had a good tranquilizer gun, though.  A couple darts whizzed by near Tony once, and it occurred to him to wonder what they thought would happen to him, 45 feet up if he suddenly got woozy.  He contracted his little belly as hard as he could and squeezed out some scat into his right hand.  He leaped for another tree and in mid-air flung his poo at them.  It hit the woman with the gun right on top of the head.  She dropped the gun and started cursing.  Tony jumped to another branch above the flustered crew and took his little penis in his hand then pissed for all he was worth.  Bullseye!  All three of them!<br />
<br />
Tony also found easy sanctuary in the trees behind Jeff's house.  The nearest other home was more than 300 feet away and Tony felt free to loll about there in the crook of branches.  Finally, he went in the open window to Jeff's room and sat there with Jeff, Eric, Jack and Mark watching TV.  A documentary about lemurs came on and Tony got a lot of ribbing from the others when the narrator said that females ruled the lemur hierarchies.  &quot;You'd be monkey pussy whipped!&quot; laughed Jeff and they all broke up laughing.<br />
<br />
At the end of the night, Tony tapped on Jeff's laptop and raised an eyebrow.  Jeff agreed to turn him back.  Tony crouched over the emitter and Jeff feverishly typed for a few minutes.  Finally, he hit the enter button with a flourish.  Monkey Tony felt the electric wave pass through his little body.  The transformation went in reverse order.  His ears shrank and his face changed shape.  He lost his fine fur and then his tail.  Finally, Tony's lemur body finished reshaping to his human proportions and he grew to six foot one and 171 pounds.  He was his naked model/athlete self.<br />
<br />
He smiled at Mark.  &quot;Believe me.  I will never be obedient to Cindy ever again&quot;</p>
