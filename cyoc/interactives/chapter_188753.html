<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff... or rather, &quot;Jess&quot;, as she was called in this life... held up the pair of panties.  This was his underwear.  Or rather, &quot;her&quot;?  No, Jess may be in a female body, now, but he still considers himself very much male.<br />
<br />
He pulled on the pair of panties.  They didn&#39;t really feel any different than his male underwear, until they reached his crotch.  The sensation of having a vagina was made all the more noticeable with the fabric of the panties pulled up against her comparatively flat crotch.  Looking in his mirror, it was strange, seeing the lack of bulge in his underwear.  Moreso seeing the pair of breasts that now adorned his chest.  He&#39;d probably find himself aroused looking at this half-naked girl, if that girl wasn&#39;t him.<br />
<br />
Reaching back for the clothes that he had previously laid on his bed, he noted an article of clothing that he didn&#39;t own, before: a bra.  After experimentally figuring out how the straps connected, he put on the bra.  It was tricky connecting the straps behind him, but he got it after a minute.  A part of him felt a little embarassed, being a dude wearing a bra.  But nobody would really think it unusual for him to be wearing one in this reality.  That said, he&#39;d definitely raise some eyebrows if he was seen wandering around in his underwear, so on came the pants and shirt, the latter being a bit uncomfortable until he realized he needed to pull his longer hair out from within it.<br />
<br />
Jess went back to his computer, looking at the Chronivac&#39;s settings.  Though it&#39;s convenient that reality has been changed so that him being female will be seen as normal, it certainly didn&#39;t help him with actually living it.  He had been so focused on becoming his own vagina, he hadn&#39;t thought how to handle this life in the meantime.  Granted, he only planned on staying like this for 24 hours.  As soon as he&#39;s reunited with the conciousness in his vagina, he&#39;s planning to change back to male.  But what was he going to do about his sudden date, tonight?<br />
<br />
The obvious solution was to change himself back to male.  But the entire reason he changed himself to female in the first place was so that he could send a copy of his conciousness to his new vagina.  Would his copy be okay with turning into a penis?  Jess thought for a moment, whether he&#39;d be interested in that.  And, the idea of being a penis, even his own, weirded him out.<br />
<br />
How do you undo a change, anyway?  Jeff looked through the transformation log.  There were two entries listed: the first being his transformation from male to female, and the second being the duplication of his conciousness into his vagina.  Jeff opened the former.  To his surprise, not only could it be undone from here, but it could be modified.  In that case, what if there&#39;s something here that would allow him to still be female for his vagina?<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t find anything in the basic options he originally used, so he opened the advanced options.  There, he came across the option that kept his awareness.  By default, it kept him aware.  If he was made unaware, he&#39;d only remember life as Jess, unaware that he&#39;d once been male.  Jess was somewhat thankful that it defaulted to keeping him aware.  Although, given the situation, Jess wondered if he should turn his awareness off.  Altering his memories like that was rather scary, but now that he has a copy separate from himself (at least mentally), his copy would remember his old life.  Soon as their conciousnesses merge, he&#39;d remember his male life, again, in addition to having memories of this female life.  But is he willing to alter his current memories like that?<br />
<br />
Looking furthur into the advanced options, he also found an option to alter reality.  Apparently, this option is why he now has a date with his best friend.  Maybe if he turned this option off, reality would go back to his male life.  Although, he&#39;s not really sure how he&#39;d explain to his family why he&#39;s a girl, or even if they&#39;d believe him, given the personal modifications he made.<br />
<br />
Jess opened the second transformation entry, the one in which he duplicated his conciousness to his vagina.  The first thing he noticed was that the sensory options he had chosen as &quot;Random&quot; had now been filled in -- his copy lacked a sense of smell, but retained his sense of taste.  But that wasn&#39;t the reason he opened this part of the log.  First, he wanted to see if he could change the duration of the change.  While there was still more than 23 hours left on the countdown, he found that he could not only change the duration, but he could also undo the change immediately if he wanted.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, he looked at the Awareness setting for his copy.  Unsurprisingly, his copy is fully aware of his transformation.  But what if Jess turned THAT off?  Jeff could make his copy think that he&#39;d always been a sentient vagina, and then immediately undo the change.  Then when their conciousnesses merge, he&#39;d gain an entire lifetime of memories as a vagina.  He wanted to find out what it&#39;s like to be a vagina?  He&#39;d certainly know it, then!  More importantly, he&#39;d be free to change himself back to male.  A quick fix for the situation.<br />
<br />
Hovering his mouse over the option to turn off his copy&#39;s awareness, he glanced down at the &quot;Telepathy&quot; option.  He had previously turned that off because he didn&#39;t like the idea of constantly speaking to himself in his head.  But maybe he should turn that on, and discuss the situation with his copy.  That would perhaps be the most fair thing to do.</p>
