<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the movie theater, Connor and Spark look at the choices available. <br />
<br />
Caleb and Gloria were eyeing a romantic movie, Connor and Spark both went, &quot;UGH!&quot; <br />
<br />
There was a horror movie playing... but Connor&#39;s dad fought monsters every day... his dad. And both Spark and Connor could never take these movies seriously. The last time the family had watched one, they&#39;d been laughing out loud at how many things they got wrong or how utterly nonsensical everyone was acting. <br />
<br />
And that left, <br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh! Last Action Expedition! Part Three!&quot; Spark said. <br />
<br />
&quot;You like that movie?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting decades for them to finally make a new one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the reboot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE DON&#39;T TALK ABOUT THE REBOOT!&quot; Spark snapped.<br />
<br />
Connor backed off some, deciding wisely not to say that he liked the reboot. <br />
<br />
Caleb and Gloria chose to watch the romantic film anyway, leaving Spark and Connor alone. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
The movie screen, the adventure played out. The lead actor had in fact been dead for years, but thanks to improvements in CGI, and a real life twin brother, they&#39;d been able to give his character a tragic, but still thoroughly heroic send off. <br />
<br />
&quot;You told me grandpa was a deadbeat! Why didn&#39;t you tell me he helped SAVE THE WOLRD?!&quot; The little girl in glasses shouted angrily at her mother. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Your world is doomed!&quot; Shouted the ancient evil. The little heroine fired back... the phantom of her grandfather helping her deal the final blow before peacefully vanishing into the afterlife. <br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Spark said, &quot;Maybe they recycled a few too many parts from the first movie, but it felt like they were doing it because they wanted us to know it was remembered, not because they couldn&#39;t come up with any ideas... And unlike ... that movie... this felt like they were doing a proper &#39;passing of the torch.&#39; &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It... wasn&#39;t that bad. It&#39;s not my favorite. It had some pacing issues, but it was a fun adventure.&quot; Connor admitted. <br />
<br />
As for a minute, Spark realized she&#39;d forgotten she was a human watching this movie... she truly had, just had fun with Connor, no ifs, ands, or buts. <br />
<br />
Gloria and Caleb came out a few minutes later. <br />
<br />
&quot;So have fun kids?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; They two said together, then looked at each other, and laughed. <br />
<br />
Spark twiddled with her fingers and said. &quot;Gloria... I... I want to thank you for this. It&#39;s... it&#39;s been a great experience for me... But... I want to pay Connor back for that... I&#39;ve seen his world... I want to show him mine.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gloria was silent for a minute. <br />
<br />
Connor said, &quot;Wait wait wait! You want to turn me into a fairy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. Into a breed of fairy like me. But you&#39;ll stay male. And you&#39;ll only stay that way as long as you wish. I got to experience things as a human, why not the other way around?&quot; <br />
<br />
Connor thought about it, they had kinda surprised Spark with this... and she had liked it, why not let him play with things the other way around? <br />
<br />
&quot;Will it be safe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Totally safe! I know a safe space for fairies we can go and have some fun!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And I can change back any time I want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I promise. I Give My Word.&quot; What Spark said was binding. <br />
<br />
Connor nodded. <br />
<br />
Gloria hated to admit it, but fair was fair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, dear, I take it you want to handle Connor&#39;s change yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Spark said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then!&quot; Spark shrank into her clothes as they vanished, revealing the green fairy, as she fluttered around. &quot;Oh yeah, one thing I definitely missed was my wings! Alright Connor, don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll love it!&quot;<br />
<br />
The magic of the fairy and the mage meant none noticed the odd transformations happening in front of them. <br />
<br />
Connor shrank into his clothes, which soon vanished, stored in a hypothetical state. <br />
<br />
The little naked blue fairy looked down at himself.... but didn&#39;t feel ashamed or embarrassed, if anything, he had this odd sense of being liberated. <br />
<br />
Spark fluttered down and took Connor&#39;s hands. &quot;Alright kiddo! Time for some fairy fun! See you later guys! I promise to bring him home in one piece!&quot; Spark laughed. She took to the air, dragging Connor with her. After a few cute panicked cries, he realized that if he just let go, instincts took over, and his wings let him fly along with Spark.<br />
<br />
The two kept low, and kept their eyes out for power lines and the like. Out of the city they flew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are we going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see! We&#39;re fairies, we&#39;re born from magic, and when we die, we return to magic. Our souls and Egos are reabsorbed into magic itself. But this also means we&#39;re more closely connected to magic than most.&quot;<br />
<br />
They entered a section of forest. Truly entered, for though Connor didn&#39;t see any border or barrier, he felt that he had crossed over into something. He felt stronger, more powerful, more mighty, like bindings had been let loose from him. <br />
<br />
And he spotted a group of four collage student at a camp site, looking like they didn&#39;t have a care in the world. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to a fairy safe zone for fairies!&quot; Spark said proudly.  &quot;In this area, we can transform mortals as we please and it&#39;ll be completely within the confines of fairy law!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How is that even possible!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are a lot of stipulations of course. Only licensed fairies may transformed mortals, or those of the royal family (but that&#39;s another barrel of fish). And licensed fairies may only transform mortals in the designated areas as agreed upon by pacts between mortals and fae several hundred years ago. <br />
<br />
&quot;The number of licensed fairies who transform mortals can&#39;t go over the quota. And those fairies themselves can&#39;t go over the quota their license provides. As a &#39;temporarily-transformed&#39; fairy, any transformation pranks you do are added to my quota instead. And getting your quota cleared for another go requires a a trip back to Avalon.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t transform mortals into something disposable or perishable like say toilet paper or a candy bar. They can&#39;t be changed into something that&#39;ll result in their invariable and/or immediate death. So you can&#39;t turn them into a fish in a boiling pot or on dry land. Whatever their form, they can&#39;t suffer death of consciousness, and they can&#39;t SUFFER in their new form. So you can&#39;t turn them into a statue unless you also make them HAPPY to be a statue.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t significantly reduce their lifespan, or if you do, you must give that lifespan to another mortal in exchange, but the reverse is not true. So if you turn them into a raccoon, you have to give that raccoon a VERY unnaturally long lifespan from their point of view.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t do a transformation that&#39;ll result in the direct cause of a major economic, political, or military upheaval. You don&#39;t want to know how that part got added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And finally transformations can&#39;t be for our own personal gain or those we care for beyond our own entertainment or amusement. Otherwise I&#39;d have used my quota in these areas that boost my magic to turn some of the sickos your dad has fought. You could turn a mortal into a gold statue, but you couldn&#39;t turn them into a statue and SELL it, nor could you take it for your personal collection.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;For people legally considered minors you wish to use your magic on, like you, things get interesting. You have to be in your true form. You have to explain to them clearly and concisely what the transformation is. And unlike normal transformations, they MUST agree to it of their own will! And if their new self wishes to be remade into their old self, you must concede to their desire no matter what, though it doesn&#39;t count towards your quota of changes. Also, the mentally handicapped are to fall under this subset for obvious reasons. <br />
<br />
&quot;And the vast majority of transformations in these areas come with a simple reality retcon to keep trouble from brewing over them. As a sub-clause to this, adults changed into children, fall under the consent clause AFTER the transformation is complete, though secondary changes from reality retcons are not considered separate transformations and do not require consent since their fate is bound to their parents, and their parents, and so on.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What about I heard about &#39;giving your name&#39; binds you to a fairy&#39;s will?&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that? Well. It also can only happen in designated areas. Counts towards your quota. And follows most of the same rules as the standard set, except they can be in your service, obviously. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have to be in your true form when you ask for their name, which means you can&#39;t do that as a temporary fairy. It has to be face to face, meaning no over the phone or internet. They have to be of sound mind and body when they give their name. Including free of any enchantments that would addle their thinking. Their name has to be their name to give.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So they can&#39;t give an alias?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I mean if someone can legally change your name, then it really isn&#39;t your name to give is it? And if you&#39;ve given yourself completely and utterly to a cause, then your name is no longer yours. Or if your name was changed as part of a ritual of joining a religion, then you legally can&#39;t give your name.<br />
<br />
&quot;Prisoners and convicts are an exception, since they had their new &#39;name&#39;, their prison number, forced upon them. Unless they&#39;ve given into despair and their number really is their name now, at which point they can no longer give it, since it, and them, belong to the state.  <br />
<br />
Connor was bewildered, he never imagined fairies, FAIRIES, the carefree pranksters of the magical world, would have so many RULES!<br />
<br />
And could he really go along with the idea of changing human beings for fun? But the more he looked at these mortals... the more, plain the mortals seemed, like they were blank canvas&#39;, with what they could truly become, what they truly were, screaming from the inside wanting to come out. <br />
<br />
&quot;How would I even be able to do magic like that?&quot; Connor asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna sound weird for you, but the key for this kinda magic isn&#39;t to force it to happen, it&#39;s to LET IT happen. Open the valves. That&#39;s the key, the only way to direct it, is by controlling what valves you open, not by trying to control the magic itself. Trust me, fairy magic doesn&#39;t like being dominated. The rules are there so we don&#39;t go wild with it and everything dissolves into chaos. There&#39;s really nothing to do. Just let it go, let it go, let it gooooooOOOooooo!&quot; Spark said the last part singsong like. <br />
<br />
Connor had seen many magic users, good and bad. He understood the vague fundamentals at least. <br />
<br />
The group was composed of three ladies and one guy. <br />
<br />
Connor focused on one of the ladies below. She stood-up at attention. A broad smile on her face. Brown fur like her hair spread across her body. Her clothes vanished as she put on a few pounds. Charcoal black fur covered her belly and parts of her face making it look like a mask, her head became like a raccoon&#39;s. A fluffy ringed tail grew from her rear as her hand and feet gained dark furred &#39;socks&#39; and &#39;gloves.&#39; Her feet became digigrated. Her beasts grew with her belly. <br />
<br />
But things were not done. Her eyes took on a doll like sheen, while her new ears became obviously plastic. Her fur took on a uniform, man-made look, her beasts and groin became devoid of detail. <br />
<br />
The alt-brand Soul Drive robot immediately began to happily help the humans and making their trip into the great out doors that much more comfortable. Naturally the objects of her human life all vanished into the either, or rather, had never existed at all.<br />
<br />
Connor felt his heart pounding, he had never felt such a rush. Of letting the magic out and letting it become one with someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad. My turn!&quot; Spark said. The next woman also stood at attention, her clothes became a maid&#39;s uniform, while her figure filled out, becoming like an otaku&#39;s fantasy. Her ears became feline and moved to the top of her head. While a tail emerged from her rear a hole in her maid uniform. The tail and ears black furred like her hair. <br />
<br />
The uniform itself remained perfectly clean. The woman had a perfect zen like smile on her her face, her feline fangs showing. <br />
<br />
The woman&#39;s eyes became white and silvery like a pair of pearls. But this wasn&#39;t blindness. The cat girl in this new reality had given herself willingly and knowingly completely to her duty, her role, her purpose, having willing freed herself of all distractions, leaving only devotion and obedience, and self-preservation to ensure she could continue the first two. Her mind cleansed of all else. The brainwashing and her mind one and the same. <br />
<br />
The brainwashed catgirl maid quickly go to work helping serve the remaining two humans. But the soul-drive and the cat-girl were shooting each other the occasional glare, apparently determined to show which of them was the more devoted servant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t plan on that part, but the unpredictable way these transformation can interact with each other is half the fun! Alright Connor, show me more!&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor &#39;undid the valves&#39; a second time. The one guy in the group began to shrink down. His insides became fluff, his clothes vanished as his eyes became polished glass buttons, his skin became wooly brown cloth. Sewing lines became obvious on his body. His fingers and toes became overly simplified, as his head became a bear&#39;s complete with a little round tail. The teddy bear wiped his nose, and climbed up to sit in the lap of his owner since childhood, still serving as her lifelong companion who would never judge her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that sure gives me inspiration for our last one!&quot; Spark said excitedly.  <br />
<br />
And the last human began to shrink down as well. Her dress became more frilly, turning bright pink with prancing unicorns stitched into the trim. Jewelry with sapphires adorned her neck, hair, and wrists. Her blond hair became curly. Blond fur covered her body as she gained tiny retractable claws and little fangs. Her face became feline as her triangle blond ears poked out of her hair while her old ears vanished. Her eyes became large and cornflower blue. Her shoes and socks vanished, leaving paws with thick pads, there was blur and she was wearing white sandals. A blond tail emerged from her pink dress. <br />
<br />
The anthro catgirl regressed in age until she was younger than Connor. <br />
<br />
&quot;We hope you&#39;re enjoying your day out mistress,&quot; said the catgirl maid. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll endure to make it as lovely as possible owner,&quot; inched in the raccoon gynoid. <br />
<br />
The heiress hugged her teddy closer, who immediately hugged her back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I just wanna enjoy being out in the woods right now,&quot; said the little cat girl politely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mistress/Owner!&quot; The robo-raccoon and brainwashed cat girl bowed together. <br />
<br />
&quot;It really is a lovely day Cleo,&quot; said the teddy bear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Robin, it&#39;s almost magical,&quot; smiled the catgirl heiress.</p>
