<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen felt stupid, just sitting there, in this big pot naked.  She had to sit there with her legs drawn up, her knees rising up from the top layer of dirt.  The soil itself was just up to her breasts.  Jen wanted nothing more than to just get up, get a shower, and leave this stupid thing behind.  But she HAD to stay in there; she had to. She was dared to and so she had to.<br />
<br />
&quot;This sucks,&quot; she pouted.  She grabbed her phone and went to call her boyfriend for help.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, her stomach cramped beneath the surface.  Another cramp quickly followed.  It was like she had to poop!  All Jen wanted to do was get up and run to the bathroom, but no, no.  She was stuck.  She HAD TO STAY IN THE POT.  SHE HAD TO STAY IN THE POT.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo,&quot; she grunted.  Another cramp, deeper now, and her anus began to pucker.  She was going to shit herself.  She was going poop in the pot but she couldn&#39;t get up BECAUSE SHE HAD TO STAY IN THE POT.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooooo, gods, nooooo,&quot; she moaned and grunted.<br />
<br />
Unable to help herself, she pushed pert butt against the bottom of the pot.  She huffed and grunted, cheeks spread wide against the cool plastic surface below.  &quot;Ffffuuucck,&quot; she snarled and could no longer help herself.  Deep below, in the potting soil, she farted and then . . . her asshole clenched, released, clenched, released and then --<br />
<br />
She screamed.  It was like part of herself was being shit out of her asshole.  It was it her body was being shoved out of her own butt.  Roots!  Jen knew immediately.  Roots!  They had formed in her stomach, like some bizarre fusion of plant and human.  They had filled her abdomen, replacing her very digestive system.  They shoved out of her asshole, unspooling from within.  Jen screamed again as her very biological functions were overridden by that stupid Transform or Dare bullshit.<br />
<br />
The roots slowly stopped and she felt them, faintly, in the soft fertile soil that was now her forever home.  This is how she would eat now; her roots would absorb all the nutrients from the dirt.  No more cheeseburgers, no more milkshakes, no more lattes.  Her butt roots did the eating for her now.<br />
<br />
Tenatively, gingerly, she reached down into the soil and felt the change to her once pert buttcheeks.  They were spread permanently now.  The roots themselves were fused with her the muscles of her anus, forming some kind of bizarre transition of human flesh to plant flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh noooo,&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
The next part of the transformation began.  Involuntarily, her legs jerked up, out of the potting soil and lifted Jen up a little.   Her roots shifted, giving her at least something secure to sit on.  But her legs - her long, smooth legs - they were changing now!  Her toes started wiggling on their own, turning green, the toe nails vanishing into her changing flesh.  The toes elongated, spiraling to the floor, sprouting heart-shaped leaves.  They tickled as they tumbled down the sides of the pot.  Her feet melted painlessly into this new mass, splitting into five huge vines that formed from her ankles. <br />
<br />
Jen stared, wordlessly, as her shins lost all sense of firm structure and became stalks from all of this sprouted.  Her thighs, now heaved out of the spoil, shifted impossibly wide.  Her pussy was exposed, her slit sighing open just at the surface of the soil.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, please stoooop,&quot; Jen moaned.  Her thighs were dark green and tingled.  Jen&#39;s position was shifted.  She was bent nearly in half, her anus-roots still beneath the surface, but her vagina exposed to fresh air.  Her mutated legs hung from hips that had silently and dramatically changed, locking her spread plant legs into position.<br />
<br />
Her pussy began to tingle now.  She could smell her own juices, musky and feminine, but it came with a strange throbbing.  She could feel parts of it swelling.  Jen reached down, her juices mixing with the soil.  She could feel bulb-like protrusions growing all within her sex.  There were at least fifteen of them, all the size of grapes, but with the texture of oranges.  Jen plucked them out from the inner folds of her labia and tossed them onto the ground.  They were blood red but looked (she hated to admit this) succulent.  Yet, as soon as Jen plucked them, a new set grew in - in fact, even more!  Twenty of her pussy fruits now filled her womanhood, rubbing against her clit and forcing the soft green edges of her labia to remain open.<br />
<br />
Her stomach became green and springy, and then her breasts.  They were filled with such warmth!  They grew, rapidly falling downward and out from her chest.  Her nipples went erect.  Within seconds, her boobs hung leg ripe watermelons from her chest.  Jen couldn&#39;t say anything anymore - she was too lost in shock.  Her skin across her shoulders, her arms, hands, neck, head . . . it was green.  A light, emerald green.  Her hair felt for a moment like it had been pulled - transforming from regular hair to long, fern-like stems.  <br />
<br />
Then it was over.  Jen&#39;s vagina had been changed into a cursed fruit-bearing receptacle.  Her legs were replaced by thick stems that led to wild, wide-leaved vines that spilled onto the floor.  Her anus was violated with roots that tangled beneath her, replacing her digestive system forever.  Her breasts were abnormally huge.  Her entire flesh had been turned green and her hair was now more fern than hair.<br />
<br />
Her could still talk.  She still had her arms, though she was afraid to touch this new, mutated form.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m - I&#39;m trapped!  I&#39;m trapped!  I&#39;M TRAPPED LIKE THIS FOREVER!&quot; she screamed in terrible and tragic sorrow.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at her door . . .</p>
