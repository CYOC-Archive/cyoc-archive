<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You feel someone gently shaking you awake. &quot;Come on and get up Violet&quot; you hear Sarah say.<br />
<br />
You roll onto your back and say &quot;Ok, I'm getting up. What time is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's seven in the morning&quot; Sarah says, &quot;and it's time for breakfast. After breakfast there is a council meeting which you need to attend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I have to attend council meetings?&quot; you ask sitting up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you're my daughter and it's just the way it is&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now get up and get dressed. Wear one of your dresses.&quot;<br />
<br />
You get out of bed and use the bathroom. Then you go to your wardrobe and look to see what dresses you have. There's quite a selection of dresses in there and you have a little trouble choosing one. Finally you decide on a sleeveless, black velvet dress. Next you go over to your dresser and pick out a pair of black silk panties and matching bra.<br />
<br />
After you get dressed Sarah says &quot;Sit down and I'll help you with your make-up.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit down at your make-up table and listen as Sarah explains how to put make-up on while she's putting make-up on you. When she was done you looked stunning, no red blooded male would be able to avoid staring at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well now that we're done it's time to go to breakfast&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
Breakfast went by without anything worth mentioning happening. After breakfast Sarah led you to a room with a semi-circular table at one end and about 30 chairs at the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the council chamber&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does the council do?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;There are a few things we do in here&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Most of the time we hear complaints about minor rule breaking or we decide if rules need to be changed, created, or thrown out. There are a few things that you need to know. The first thing is that you need to pay attention. The second is that you can ask questions of those coming before the council. Third, you do have a vote but it's counted as a half vote. Fourth, you need to be courteous to those who come before<br />
us. Fifth, when you speak you need to stand up. And finally, be courteous to other council members. We sit in the middle of the table now since I'm Head Council now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You follow Sarah to your seats and sit down. Over the next few minutes the other council members came in and sat down and the seats facing the council table filled up. You recognize Monty and Blade as two of the people sitting in on the meeting.<br />
<br />
As soon as everyone was inside the council chamber Sarah stood up and said &quot;Alright, the meeting will now begin. First are there any complaints?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one Head Council&quot; a young vampiress said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is the nature of your complaint?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danny came into my room uninvited two nights ago&quot; the vampiress said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you invite him into your room previously?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Head Council&quot; the vampiress said, &quot;we had always met in the rec room to hang out or we when we went out on dates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Is Danny here today?&quot;<br />
<br />
No one responded and after a few moments said &quot;If you're here this is your last chance to respond Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look around to see if anyone will respond. You see no one standing up saying anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well since Danny is evidently not here this council has no choice but to find Danny in violation of our privacy rules&quot; Sarah said. &quot;In addition he is also in violation of a council summons. I suggest a punishment of two hours staked. All those in favor raise your hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn't raise your hand but everyone else did. You wonder why someone would be staked for two hours over violating a privacy rule.<br />
<br />
&quot;All those against.&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
You don't raise your hand and neither does anybody else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Violet&quot; Sarah said, &quot;you didn't raise your hand. Do you have a different punishment in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up and say &quot;No Head Council. I just think this is a little harsh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I forgot that you're new Violet&quot; Sarah said. &quot;The staking punishment is because Danny didn't show up after he was summoned by the council. If he had been here and found in violation of clan rules, he would have been punished with some sort of service. Two hours staked is a standard punishment for not ignoring a council summons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok I see but I have a couple of questions&quot; you say. You turn to the vampiress and ask &quot;First of all, what's your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Alice Head Daughter&quot; the vampiress answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what Danny was doing in your room without an invitation Alice?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said that he mistook my room for his Head Daughter&quot; Alice said. &quot;I asked him to leave but he said that maybe we could do something since he was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you take that to mean?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he wanted sex Head Daughter&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he have anything in his hands?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;He had his hands behind his back when I saw him Head Daughter&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were you asleep when he came into your room?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I wasn't Head Daughter&quot; Alice said. &quot;Any other night I would have been but I was restless that night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like he was planning on raping you&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Since he didn't make the attempt though my original suggestion stands. All those in favor of a punishment of two hours staked raise your hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone on the council raised they hand including you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Punishment will be carried out in three days unless Danny appeals&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Is there any other complaints?&quot; When no one said anything Sarah said &quot;Ok moving on, Monty has something he wishes to tell us. Go ahead Monty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Head Council&quot; Monty said as he stood up. &quot;First of all I want to apologize to you Head Daughter for accusing you of not being a vampire last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up and say &quot;Apology accepted Monty, please continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Head Daughter&quot; Monty said as you sit back down. &quot;Now to what I came here to say. Many of you will think that what I'm about to say is my paranoid rambling but I have to tell you it. A friend of mine has told me that someone is trying to infiltrate us. Whether it's true or not I don't know. I don't expect you to believe me since I've been paranoid about every new vampire. I just thought you should<br />
know what I've been told.&quot; As soon as he finished speaking Monty sat back down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for this information Monty&quot; Sarah said. &quot;Now Blade has some news for us. Go ahead Blade.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Head Council&quot; Blade said standing up. &quot;Last night Dagger found two bodies. She came to me for help in identifying one of them. One appears to be a member of your clan. I'll let Dagger tell you more about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A young woman who appeared to be 19 or 20 stood up and nervously said &quot;Greetings Head Council. I found the bodies around midnight. I took some pictures which I'll show if you can dim the lights.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we can dim the lights&quot; Sarah said. As soon as she said that the lights went out and Dagger projected a picture on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;This first one is the female I found&quot; Dagger said still nervous. &quot;As you can see there are puncture marks on her neck indicating a vampire bite. The condition of the body suggests that she wasn't dead long before I found her. The second body puzzled me enough to seek Blades advice.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Dagger said this she clicked to the next picture and Alice screamed &quot;Oh my god! It's Danny!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am Head Council&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see&quot; Sarah said, &quot;please continue Dagger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well as you can see he has the same puncture wounds on his neck&quot; Dagger said. &quot;The strange thing is that he was staked. I called Blade to see what I should do. He told me to carefully remove the stake and tell him what happened. When I pulled it out nothing happened, the body was just as dead as before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you find the bodies?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the north side in an abandoned warehouse&quot; Dagger said. &quot;They were in an area that would get direct sunlight during the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand up and ask &quot;Alice, what times have you seen Danny during the last three months?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I only saw him at night Head Daughter&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that a change for him?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it was&quot; Alice said. &quot;Before we always ate together then he simply stopped coming to meals. I had asked him why and he said that he was doing something for the council. I didn't question him on that. Now he's dead.&quot; She broke down and cried.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Monty is right about us being infiltrated&quot; you say. &quot;It looks like there was a vampire that could take Danny's form here for the past three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We'll have to deal with this. Until we do I don't want anyone alone at night. Alice, I want you to stay with Violet in her room. I just hope this vampire can't mist. Do you have anything else to tell us Dagger?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Head Council&quot; Dagger said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since there's nothing else on today's agenda this council is adjourned&quot; Sarah said.<br />
<br />
Everyone got up to leave and Sarah said to you &quot;I have to go to work. Keep Alice company and just be there for her. I think that she and Danny were pretty close.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have Brian teach you how to transform into objects, people, and animals later today&quot; Sarah said. &quot;He'll also explain about what you need to wear when we go hunting tonight.&quot; Sarah kisses your forehead and says &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too&quot; you say giving Sarah a hug.<br />
<br />
You go on over to Alice who is still crying and say &quot;Come on Alice, let's go to my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Head Daughter&quot; Alice said through her sobs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me that outside of the council&quot; you say, &quot;use my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Head Dau... I mean Violet&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let's go&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You lead Alice to your room and once outside you say &quot;Alright, here we are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no door, this is just a blank wall&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you mist into your room?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I use a regular door&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is that?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't mist during the day&quot; Alice said. &quot;I appreciate you trying to cheer me up with this joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is no joke&quot; you say. &quot;Down here it doesn't matter if it's night or day, we can turn to mist.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How does turning to mist get us into your room?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's a small crack right here&quot; you say pointing out the crack to Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't see it&quot; Alice said. &quot;This joke is getting old.&quot;<br />
<br />
You realize that Alice won't believe you unless you take her in yourself. You have a good idea how to take someone or something with you when you turn to mist. You grab Alice and concentrate on misting your body and clothes as well as Alice and her clothes. In a second you're both mist and entering your room.</p>
