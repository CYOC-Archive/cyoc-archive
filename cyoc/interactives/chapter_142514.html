<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The &quot;adult&quot; tag/warning is more for a bit of foreplay than full on sex, but because the pairing in the chapter is male and female, that&#39;s the one I went with.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">JT softly nuzzled Spotted Tail as they sat at Christmas Dinner with the Brown family and Samson. It was a nice family setting and capped off what had been a wonderful Christmas morning, even if it wasn&#39;t typical for most people. But then, there were things about Animalia that weren&#39;t like most people. He remembered seeing the reports on the news and talking with Josephine on the report that Abby had been converted into an Animalian and was one of the first humans to convert, if by accident. He had been a bit worried then, as he&#39;d always liked his niece and tried to visit when he could, but as more news came out and things stabilized that worry seemed to ease.<br />
<br />
It was probably due to Lyre&#39;s acceptance of Animalia and the founding of things like Animalia Ambassadoria to try and promote and show the world how despite the sort of &quot;Mad Scientist accident&quot; that created it, Animalia was a driving force for good and improvements in many fields. Health related sciences seemed to relate to that, and while some might not want to give up their humanity for &quot;health,&quot; JT had no reason to complain about that issue. His lungs felt stronger than ever, and while his smoking hadn&#39;t gotten to the point of actually killing him, even he knew that it was having a negative impact on his health. It was why he quit smoking in the first place. Having Spotted Tail by his side, though, was an added perk that from one to another he wouldn&#39;t give up. Especially as it had brought him real love and healed his lungs. It was with that joy in mind that he nuzzled his nose to Spotted Tail&#39;s and thought back to earlier that morning...<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Spotted Tail&#39;s home wasn&#39;t too much to write home about. As with many Animalian build homes it was more functional to fit her size and needs rather than some of the artistic tastes that JT had seen over the years in his work running livestock auctions around the country. But artistic design wasn&#39;t the point of visiting someone, it was the person who lived there that was worth visiting someone for. For JT, visiting Spotted Tail was worth all of it. It was quite amazing in many ways to find that Spotted Tail had had interest in him, even though he wasn&#39;t an Animalian, though, of course that would likely change.<br />
<br />
Some of it was that he&#39;d never figured many would want to be around him. It wasn&#39;t that he was a bad person, and in fact JT prided himself on being amicable with people. It was more that he&#39;d often had so much time traveling between various auctions and helping various ranchers make their sales for livestock and hay for other rancher&#39;s livestock. In this, he&#39;d never found the time to settle down. And while he was happy for Josephine to have found love with Martin Brown and had been there for their wedding and as much as he could while Abby grew up, there was the sense that his busy work schedule was preventing him having anything close to what his sister had.<br />
<br />
And then came Spotted Tail. JT was still surprised that she was so interested in him after the first bachelorette auction that he&#39;d helped organize for charitable purposes, but he wasn&#39;t really going to complain. She was beautiful and kind, and in many ways highly intelligent, and over their time conversing, be it by phone, mail, or in person, JT had found that much of her interest came from the fact that when he came to Animalia it hadn&#39;t been to make money off of Animalians but to raise money to help others and it was THAT that drew her to him From the initial introduction that Josephine had arranged between them, JT had grown to love Spotted Tail in a way that he&#39;d never thought possible. It was that love that actually brought him to Animalia now and the coming step in connection with the Christmas holiday.<br />
<br />
In the course of these visits, he&#39;d managed to get a good tour of the modest yet functional dwelling. It was a single floor home with two bedrooms, one living room, one kitchen/dining room, with a small &quot;garage&quot; on the side that Spotted Tail used primarily as a laundry room. For the moment it was decorated for Christmas with a modest tree in the living room with a few flickering colored lights as it sat by a wall near a back door. Though what caught JT&#39;s attention was that behind and to the side of the tree was a mantel piece on which was a framed photo of him and her from just a few weeks before. It was the only real decoration that was there that could be there outside of Christmas.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll need to get a new picture taken before the holiday season ends,&quot; came Spotted Tail&#39;s voice from JT&#39;s left, &quot;For soon you&#39;ll be very different...&quot;<br />
<br />
JT turned to his left to find Spotted Tail in the doorway to what was her bedroom, though it was also one that she insisted on sharing when he came to visit. As his love for her grew, many of his initial protests went away as well. The biggest thing that was apparent was that she was totally naked, with nothing but her fur covering her. This was something that JT noted as something that marked Spotted Tail from Abby, Samson, Josephine, and Martin. While Samson was the only one of them that had been born a horse, he also knew that the Browns had raised American Quarter Horses, largely as part of their original ranching operation. As a result they were all largely one color with only their mane and tails being different, which was relatively typical for many horse breeds.<br />
<br />
Spotted Tail, however, was a bit shorter than either Josephine or Abby, and unlike them she wasn&#39;t a solid color. Spotted Tail was actually of two colors. Her base coat was a creamy whitish shade and it had various reddish brown spots, some of which were larger than others, and were in no real pattern that would serve for camouflage the way a leopard&#39;s spots would be. In this, JT had figured that Spotted Tail likely had some Appaloosa in her based on her spotted coat and some American Indian Horse in her as well based on her smaller size from Abby and Josephine. Though, because Spotted Tail was rescued from an animal fighting ring, it would be hard to tell exactly what breed of horse she was.<br />
<br />
Though, in the end that didn&#39;t matter. She&#39;d actually had interest in him and talked with him long enough that he was willing to take that leap, and in the end, love didn&#39;t care about all the paperwork that had to be signed. JT might not have ever figured he would become an anthropomorphic horse earlier in his life, but when he looked into Spotted Tail&#39;s dark eyes and the soft smile on her lips, he figured it was worth it. Seeing her dark nipples poke out through the white fur on nearly perfectly round and generous bosom also led to JT getting a reminder that he wasn&#39;t too old for sexual matters as it wasn&#39;t too long before his penis was growing erect and pressing against the front of his pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very soon,&quot; Spotted Tail smiled and came forward, swaying her hips slightly and letting her tail sway with them, if only to get JT interested, &quot;for we&#39;ll have a busy day. First your conversion, then we&#39;ll need to stop by Doctor Stein&#39;s place so he can re-administer the vaccine to me and give you your vaccination, and then to end the day there will be Christmas dinner with your family... where you get to show your sister what a handsome stallion you&#39;ll become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Abby and Josephine have their own stallions to love and admire,&quot; JT commented softly as he watched Spotted Tail approach, knowing that she was referring to the paperwork that would relate to his conversion. The fact that it was done with her and not by an injection by the Horizon staff had taken a lot, mostly in a way of assurances that they would insure that the vaccine for the Animalia Virus was given to both of them as soon as possible in order to make sure that Animalia Virus didn&#39;t end up a pandemic and leading to many unintended conversions. Though, JT found his hands slipping down to his waist, as if trying to hide the bulge in his pants from her and thus how little he was paying attention he was paying to regulations at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can smell your arousal, dear,&quot; Spotted Tail smiled as she approached him and soon had him in a warm hug, &quot;and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re interested... I&#39;ve been waiting for quite awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just call it nervousness on my part...&quot; JT answered slowly Spotted Tail lowered her head down to kiss him. JT returned the kiss eagerly.<br />
<br />
The kiss didn&#39;t last too long as Spotted Tail began to undo JT&#39;s pants and began to lead JT back toward the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Spotted Tail spoke with a soft smile as they broke the kiss, &quot;it won&#39;t hurt and as it goes on... I&#39;ve been told you&#39;ll even find the transformation pleasurable... even before sex comes into play.&quot;<br />
<br />
JT calmly with an arm around Spotted Tail&#39;s waist. She returned the gesture and JT could feel her strength as she held him to her. They then made their way into the bedroom while Spotted Tail moved to sit on the edge of the bed and softly caressed her breasts for a moment, almost as if to tease JT. That served to help encourage JT to finish stripping off his clothes, especially as her words had also provided some nature of confidence and comfort. He slowly came forward and despite the early time, he softly kissed Spotted Tail&#39;s nose along with another trail of kisses that went down her neck. He eventually managed to make his way down to her breasts where he softly latched onto a nipple and began to suckle. Spotted Tail gave a happy moan and watched as largely white fur began to grow across JT&#39;s back with darker spots forming as well in a pattern that matched Spotted Tail&#39;s own. Though on JT those darker spots matched his original hair color. Spotted Tail also smiled as his hair began to grow back, regaining its color and would also grow out into what would be part of his mane.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Sex first thing in the morning wasn&#39;t something that JT normally would associate with Christmas, but it was something that helped along with the plan that he and Spotted Tail had worked out. Originally the idea had been to make the decision on Christmas, but then as that day got closer, they decided to go through with it, at least for the sake of conversion. And as he saw Spotted Tail get a special &quot;welcome to the family&quot; hug from Josephine, a real part of him was extremely happy and content. Life had turned out different from what he&#39;d thought it&#39;d be like when he was in high school, but in some ways it was better. Having Spotted Tail there made it so.</p>
