<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa abruptly frowned a bit. &quot;You said that in her overstimulated state, June grew extra arms, breasts, and pussies? And pussy tongues?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ty said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you didn&#39;t promise not to make those transformations to anyone else,&quot; Lisa said, &quot;and I didn&#39;t ask you to promise that, but somehow I&#39;d hoped that they were special things that only I would have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m sorry, Lisa!&quot; Ty said. &quot;When June helped me sort out your consent to be transformed from mobile app to human the first time, she saw you with those transformations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I remember. I was upset about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After I teleported you home that night, June said that she wanted to try those transformations,&quot; Ty explained. &quot;If not for that, I never would have transformed her into those ways. I didn&#39;t do it right away, but after the first time I transformed her into a mobile app, I let her try them. And of course, I made her able to undo and redo them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she was a big help to us,&quot; Lisa conceded. &quot;I guess I don&#39;t mind sharing those transformations with her. But please don&#39;t give them to anyone else! And I want to keep at least some of the other transformations to be mine only!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa,&quot; Ty said, &quot;that&#39;s fine, and I feel the same way. But because I gave June more arms and pussies, Mark told me he was worried about whether he could satisfy her, and asked for my help. I gave him the extra arms, and extra cocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s fine,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I certainly want them both to be happy, so I&#39;m glad you gave Mark transformations to match.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I certainly didn&#39;t give June all of your transformations,&quot; Ty said. &quot;I didn&#39;t give her the zippers, or the enhanced vaginal muscles you used for the walnuts. I was thinking about giving her those, but didn&#39;t get around to it. I didn&#39;t tell her about them then, so now I won&#39;t. And I certainly won&#39;t ever transform her into my cock, or my cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa giggled a bit, then started laughing uproariously.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just imagining June as your cock! As your cum!&quot; she said, between laughs. &quot;That would be funny as hell!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Ty said. &quot;She&#39;s my mother. Frankly, lately I&#39;ve spent a lot more time seeing her naked, and thinking about her and Mark&#39;s sex life, than I really want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, I understand,&quot; Lisa said, still laughing. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you to actually _do_ those things with her. But just the thought of your mother being your cock or cum struck me as funny!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty harumphed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t even find the idea a little amusing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Ty said. &quot;When she was overstimulated by having both clothes machines merged into her body, her eyes were rolled up in their sockets, and she called out to Mark, and asked him to fuck her. Mark wasn&#39;t there, and maybe she thought I was Mark, but I told her I was Ty. Thenshe asked _me_, by name, to fuck her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Ty!&quot; Lisa said, &quot;That&#39;s awful! But you know she wasn&#39;t herself!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I know. She apologized later, and she was worried that I&#39;d never respect her again. I reassured her that I understood what had happened to her, and that she hadn&#39;t really been in control. Hadn&#39;t been really herself. But what I&#39;m ashamed to admit...&quot; Ty paused. &quot;is that a part of me wanted to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, I don&#39;t think you need to be ashamed of that. You had a beautiful woman, already in a seexual frenzy, ask you to fuck her. Any hetero man would be tempted. That you were tempted doesn&#39;t say anything bad about you. What shows your true character is that you didn&#39;t. You could have , and only you and June would ever have known, and under those conditions even she might just have thought that you were Mark. But you knew it would be wrong, and you didn.t do it. Instead, you helped her get back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it helped a lot that I knew that who I really wanted was you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa kissed him. &quot;And now you have me again. Shall we?&quot; Ty nodded. Lisa made a copy of herself, and then the copy transformed into mattress topper and pillows. Her mattress topper form looked strange, because most of her top half, from her mid line not quite to the head of the bed, and her breast pillows, were still in aquarium form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I make a few changes to her? You?&quot; Ty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go right ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty changed mattress-topper Lisa to be 100% aquarium. &quot;Not enough fish,&quot; he said, and the fish each split multiple times. &quot;And now that you&#39;re basically a waterbed, I want you to be much thicker.&quot; Lisa geprew from six inches thick, to about 30 inches thick. The floor started creaking under the weight. &quot;Oops, I&#39;d better reinforce the bed frame and floor. We don&#39;t want to unexpectedly find ourselves downstairs.&quot; The floor stopped creaking.<br />
<br />
After becoming so much thicker, the fish in Lisa seemed a bit sparse again. Ty made them split a few more times, and added more rocks, plants, and decorations in her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think?&quot; Ty asked the human/aquarium Lisa, who was staring in awe at waterbed/aqaurium Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t compete with that,&quot; she said, and turned her body back to entirely human.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a competition, Lisa,&quot; Ty said. &quot;You know I love you in any form. I didn&#39;t intend your watered form to detract from your human-aquarium hybrid form, which is amazing and beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s fine,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I actually like it a lot. But I think three aquariums in the room are enough. I don&#39;t need this body to be one as well, under the circumstances.&quot;<br />
<br />
Three? Ty looked around. Oh, right. Because in mattress topper, now waterbed, form, she usually detached her breast pillows, which were now separate, smaller aquariums.<br />
<br />
Ty was a little worried that he&#39;d somehow offended her, but he saw that she was smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Ty said, &quot;I think I&#39;d prefer your breast pillows not to be aquariums. They&#39;re huge for breasts, but small for aquariums, and I worry that we might injure the fish. That&#39;s the real reason I made you thicker, too.&quot; Her breast pillows turned back into her usual mattress topper breast pillows, which had her normal skin covered in silky white fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try out our new bed!&quot; she said. &quot;Our new me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The climbed onto her, and fucked their brains out.</p>
