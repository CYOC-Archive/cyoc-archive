<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finn looked around, trying to think of something interesting to transform. He could totally change anyone here…but Jeff just told him he knew everyone he had shifted. If Finn changed anyone into an anthro, Jeff would automatically know by default. Oh! He could change the whole campus! <br />
<br />
But if he did that…couldn’t Jeff win by literally pointing at anyone? Finn’s shoulders sagged. He’d been tricked! What else could he possibly change that Jeff wouldn’t notice?<br />
<br />
Sure the goth girl into a goth guy was a good one, but was that really sporting? Even he couldn’t honestly say that he could tell the difference. He needed to utilize outside of the box thinking.<br />
<br />
Finn bit into his dry cafeteria burger and swallowed it down with a glug of soda. Change one thing…could he change the food into something more appetizing? Would Jeff figure it out that way? He considered making a vegetarian at the table next to them a carnivore, but was there much fun to that?<br />
<br />
“Oh, one more thing. Should be pretty obvious, but let me make it clear.” Jeff spoke up.<br />
<br />
“What?” Finn asked, glancing at the tiger and feeling his cock spring to attention again.<br />
<br />
“No changes I couldn’t possibly know. Like selecting some rando and turning them gay. Or just a small change, like giving a nerd with acne another pimple. It has to be something visible and obvious.” Jeff said. “To you, at least.”<br />
<br />
“Hrrmmm.” Finn squirmed, thinking about the goth guy. That was kind of cheating, since there would be no way anyone would know. “You kinda win by default then, don’t you?”<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter, smarty-pants?” Jeff grinned toothily. “Regretting your decision already? Maybe we should just go back to the bathroom…”<br />
<br />
“I mean, I would like to suck your cock. But I also like winning too, you know!” Finn’s ears flattened. “I definitely won’t lose!”<br />
<br />
“Oho!” Jeff cackled. “My little fox is showing some fire! I like that! You better hurry up, because if we finish eating, you lose by default.”<br />
<br />
“That wasn’t the deal, babe!” Finn growled hotly.<br />
<br />
“Honestly, my attention span isn’t what it was, so…” Jeff rolled his broad shoulders apologetically. <br />
<br />
“Uh-huh.” Finn sighed, wondering what he should change. “Maybe I should become more masculine, like you.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Jeff’s eyes widened. “Why? There’s nothing wrong with you.”<br />
<br />
“That’s the problem, I guess…” Finn squirmed in his seat under his handsome boyfriend’s stare. “I just don’t want everyone to know I’m gay, you know?”<br />
<br />
“Oh right.” Jeff nodded sagely. “They might get the wrong impression, think you’re an effeminate little twink or something. A total bottom who squeals when I crush him into my pecs.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, exactly-hey!” Finn crossed his arms and pouted. “It’s not funny! I’m suffering a real crisis here, pal!”<br />
<br />
“Oh boy.” Jeff rubbed his temples. “What is so wrong with being gay?”<br />
<br />
“People judge me. Like, uh, my dad won’t love me anymore! He was a footballer, you know? No way he approves. Or your dad! What if he finds out his son is gay and dating me?”<br />
<br />
“I mean, you can <I>say</I> you aren’t gay all you want, but the fact is, you smell like a horny little fox around big men. That’s probably how your dad knows.” Jeff paused and stroked his fluffy white chin fur. “And mine. And any other anthro you change, for that matter. The nose knows, as anthros like to say.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god…” Finn blushed and stared at the floor. “I was humping my desk in Mr. Thomson’s class after he turned.”<br />
<br />
“Haha! Slut!” Jeff chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Girl, stop!” Finn punched Jeff ineffectual on one rounded shoulder. “You’re so mean!”<br />
<br />
“No straight guy says ‘girl, stop’, you know that, right?”<br />
<br />
“Right.” Finn sighed and looked around again, just in time to see Bryce Pierson walk up to their table.<br />
<br />
Bryce was the quarterback in highschool, and had gotten into college on a scholarship. He was tall, muscular, blonde hair, blue eyed-a serious catch. Basically a gay wet dream. And he was also a huge, cocky asshole who loved fucking with his teammates. That would be fine if he could be put in his place. The problem was, he earned that cocky attitude…he could back it up.<br />
<br />
“Hey Jeff. Having fun with your little boy toy?” Bryce winked at Finn, who sunk into his seat, embarrassed.<br />
<br />
Finn certainly did not like being referred to as a ‘boy toy’-though arguably, that’s exactly what he was. As he stewed in sheer embarrassment, realization struck him. Why did he even need to take this guy’s shit? Or anyone else’s, for that matter? He could warp reality, and Bryce was about to find out exactly what that meant.<br />
<br />
The other two were still talking. Bryce was mostly critiquing-in a very passive-aggressive way-Jeff’s failures at football. Jeff was starting to look annoyed, if his lashing tail and laid-back ears were any indication. It was time for Finn to put his paw down!<br />
<br />
“I think you should sit down or leave, Bryce.” Finn said, giving the jock one last chance. He was a merciful deity, after all.<br />
<br />
“I think you should go find a cock to suck, gay boy.” Bryce shot back.<br />
<br />
Finn grinned. Jeff’s eyes went wide, as he likely realized what the fox was going to do.<br />
<br />
“Bryce.” Jeff growled. “Not a good time, man.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think it’s a perfect time.” Finn interjected.<br />
<br />
The two looked at him. Jeff with a pleading expression, Bryce with a sneer.<br />
<br />
“What? Wanna get with me instead of this big pussy?” Bryce lifted his chin. “Figured Jeff couldn’t please you.”<br />
<br />
“You think you’re hot shit, dontcha?” Finn grinned at Bryce.<br />
<br />
“What would a little twink like you know about it?” Bryce snorted. “You don’t know one damn thing about football. Football, baseball, soccer. Put my up against your kitty and I’ll beat him every time. It’s not about skill it’s about talent.”<br />
<br />
“You’re right,” Finn smiled and started typing something into his phone. “You are an expert on balls.”<br />
<br />
“Babe, please,” Jeff’s voice was low. “We need him to win this season!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, he will, it’s nothing big.” Finn hit enter. “He’s just going to be too busy playing with his favorite balls to run his mouth, is all.”<br />
<br />
“What’s your little twerp talking about?” Bryce asked, sniffing haughtily. Then his sniffs grew more exaggerated, nostrils flaring, as the skin of his nose began to darken and moisten. “I..errr…that’s…you smell nice…”<br />
<br />
“Are you…” Jeff blinked, head twitching as the memories from the new realities struck him, and smiled, leaning back and spreading legs. “I know I do, pup.”<br />
<br />
“Pup? What?” Bryce shook his head, growing ears flapping from side to side, his breath quickening into a pant, tongue lengthening and hanging from his mouth, speckled with saliva. “Wrrrhat’s wrrong rrrwith me?”<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong is that you’re making a scene instead of just getting under the table.” Finn said smugly, watching golden fur spread across the young jock’s body. “Can’t you smell him? Jeff’s musk, I mean. He’s sooo pent up.”<br />
<br />
“I…rrrr!” Bryce’s face creaked forward into a muzzle, blackened nose twitching, his eyes glazing over. “Yrr…yres. So nice.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t you want a nice treat?” Finn prompted. <br />
<br />
“Mmm….” Bryce bent over as a large, fluffy tail sprouted and began to wag. “Trreat?”<br />
<br />
“Big kitty cum?” Finn grinned.<br />
<br />
Bryce gave a start, looking up at Jeff and whining. “Can I help you, Jeff? You smell so pent up.”<br />
<br />
“Come on, Bryce. You know you don’t have to ask-” Jeff’s slitted cat eyes went wide and he glared at the smug little fox sitting across the table and hissed. “Finn! You didn’t?”<br />
<br />
“Didn’t what, sweetie?” Finn batted his eyes and took a sip of his drink. “I haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.”<br />
<br />
The new anthro dog practically dove under the table. Jeff had apparently unzipped in the time between the reality shift and his sudden realization of said shift, and immediately began to moan. Finn continued to smirk. Yes, Bryce did love balls. Jeff’s balls, in particular, and knew exactly how to get the tiger to cum without even touching the shaft. <br />
<br />
Muffled slurps and lewd squelches arose under the table. Jeff’s eyes rolled, his claws clutching the edge of the table, tail tensed behind him. He was clearly trying not to get too into it, looking pleadingly at Finn.<br />
<br />
“Finn…I win.” Jeff gasped, pointing down at the dog.<br />
<br />
“You sure do, babe.” Finn typed something into his phone and pressed enter.<br />
<br />
Jeff chuffed and his head gave a little twitch. Then a wide, toothy grin spread across his muzzle and he placed a paw under the table, no longer upset. Mostly because Finn had adjusted it so that he thought he’d been the one to change Bryce<br />
<br />
With the tail wagging and his pink hole winking so invitingly, Finn reached down and inserted one dainty claw inside the Retriever’s entrance. The dogman yelped and his head smacked the table, sending a fork clattering to the floor. Jeff looked up at Finn and waggled a finger in disapproval.<br />
<br />
“You okay down there, Bryce?” Finn giggled, making a ‘come hither’ gesture with his finger.<br />
<br />
He was answered by a small, pleasured whine. “Y-yes!”<br />
<br />
Finn could smell Bryce’s arousal, now that he’d lifted the tablecloth to access the dog’s ass. He actually smelled really healthy, it was like an undertone that every anthro he’d created had. It was also a huge turn-on. Finn pulled out his finger from Bryce’s ass and slid off his chair, joining the retriever on the floor beneath the privacy of the tablecloth and smothered his pointy nose under Bryce’s tail.<br />
<br />
“F-finn?” Bryce had his head turned, puppy dog eyes pleading. “Milk me?”<br />
<br />
“That’s right, all-star.” Finn reassured the dogman, sliding two more fingers into the handsome Golden Retriever’s ring and pressing on his prostate. “I’m milking you.”<br />
<br />
The Retriever’s tail wagged faster as Finn’s other hand began to stroke Bryce’s big red doggy cock. A muffle yowl overhead indicated that Jeff had cum. A muffled howl came form the Retriever&#39;s muzzle and his hips bucked into Finn’s delicate paws as they squeezed around his knot, cum flying across the floor of the cafeteria.<br />
<br />
With a lewd popping sound, Finn extracted his fingers and licked them, enjoying the smell of musk on his hand. Then he popped back up in his seat. Bryce soon followed, setting his tray down at their table and digging in, chatting amicably with Jeff as though nothing had just happened.<br />
<br />
Finn smirked.</p>
