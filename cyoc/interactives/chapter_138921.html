<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Allright, everyone!&quot; Ms. Santos announced to the class, making her voice heard. &quot;This year, you all will be visiting a rainforest to see the animals and learn about the conversation efforts done there, specifically how animals are involved in their own environment.&quot;<br />
<br />
An idea suddenly sparked in Edwin&#39;s head, a mischievous smile on his face as he took the Chronivac emitter out and selected the Reality Change option, inputting his conditions. <br />
<br />
&quot;This should make things interesting....&quot; He mumured to himself as he began to enter them in.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rainforest trip will happen this afternoon. For the occasion, the administration gave the teacher an inferior version of the chronivac able to turn her students into diverse animals. Indeed, the goal of the trip is to have us being the animals and she will turn each one of us students into an animal of her choice. The students will keep their memories and most of their human thoughts, but a sizable portion of their minds shall be adjusted to be more like the animal they become. Once transformed, the students shall be allowed within a spacious area to roam. Of course, that is all still unknown to the students...&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin paused for a second, thinking on what else he wanted to put in, then continued to input conditions.<br />
<br />
&quot;...but their parents are completely aware of what&#39;s going to happen, and they have cleared it with the teacher. The parents may visit their transformed children every so often, although the children are required to spend some time on their own, in order to have a full rainforest animal experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sounded good to him, he decided, as he pressed enter. The Chronivac Emitter analyzed the change, then asked him;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want this change to be permanent?&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin frowned slightly, still using the emitter under his desktop. Unsure, he answered the following; <br />
<br />
&quot;The duration of each student&#39;s transformation shall be for as long as the experiment goes on, which shall be for 3 weeks exactly, unless the students become pregnant in breeding, in which case they will remain an animal until they give birth to their offspring and wean them.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Chronivac analyzed the answer, taking a few seconds to enact it. When the loading process was done, it emitted a white light, and Edwin felt a strange tingling wave go throughout the school. The emitter then displayed; &quot;Change applied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edwin then turned his attention back to the teacher, eager to see the results of his changes. <br />
<br />
&quot;... So I assume all of you are ready for the trip this afternoon?&quot; Ms. Santos was saying, with a slight grin on her face.<br />
<br />
The class nodded, all of them having a permission slip signed by their parents. Ediwn quickly checked in his pocket, finding that he had one as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, then I&#39;ll find you all next to the bus after class!&quot; Ms. Santos said, before continuing with the lesson on animals. &quot;And then it&#39;s off to the airport!&quot;<br />
<br />
And so, at the beginning of the afternoon, all the children and their teacher took the bus to the airport. The plane ride was long and pretty much boring, although Edwin still felt a childlike excitement trembling through him, wondering how they would be transformed upon arriving. <br />
<br />
Would they be turned into animals all at once, or would the teacher transform them one by one? And if she did, how would she prevent the others from freaking out? He also wondered what he would be transformed into, realizing that he&#39;d have to be stuck in that form for as long as the others, as he had dropped off the emitter at his bedroom at his house before going on the bus.<br />
<br />
Edwin soon found that he wouldn&#39;t have to wonder for too long, as the rainforest was in sight. The plane soon descended, dropping them off and heading back, leaving Ms. Santos with the students. A group of widlife conservationists came out to them, effectively acting as welcomers. <br />
<br />
The children were quite excited, however, and didn&#39;t really listen to the greeting speech of the researchers. Soon after they were done, they were walked through the rainforest, and led to a special area that was empty, showing the children a wide view of the land before them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allright, I&#39;m going to begin the roll call!&quot; Ms. Santos announced, taking out a thin white rod, which Edwin recognized as a more basic version of the Chronivac. The rest of the class didn&#39;t really think much of that, as they began to line up in the grass, but Edwin pretty much guessed that they would be transformed now. His guess was even more supported by the fact that the area before them was currently empty. Indeed, it was strange that the teacher would wait for the plane to leave to make the roll call, but Edwin brushed that aside. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kara?&quot; Ms. Santos asked, twisting a dial on her Chronivac as she gestured to the student to stand in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Present!&quot; A girl called, eagerly bouncing up and down. Edwin recognized her from his new memories, apparently she had a huge crush on him.<br />
<br />
Ms. Santos quickly pressed something on the device, and pointed it at Kara. Suddenly, Kara saw her body rapidly transform. Her body grew yellowish fur, her hands and feet began to turn into paws, her face morphing into that of a feline, and her body quickly growing lean and strong.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, where a little girl had once stood was an jaguar, confused and meowing frantically. The class began to freak out, some kids on the verge of tears, until Ms. Santos spoke up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Quiet now, class.&quot; She said, attempting to soothe the class. &quot;I know this may look strange to you, but the goal of this trip is not to see the animals, but to have you be them. Not only will this raise funds for our school, but I&#39;m sure this will be a learning experience for all of you as you will experience animal life from a firsthand perspective. Don&#39;t worry though, this all thing temporary, and it will all be over within three weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
This seemed to soothe the class somewhat, as Ms. Santos began to speak again, gesturing to a section of the forest, where one of the conversationists stood. &quot;Kara, please leave the rest of the students and move over there.&quot; <br />
<br />
Seeing as, even though Kara came out fine, the class was still far from completely calm, Ms. Santos added, &quot;And if you all don&#39;t calm down, I&#39;ll give you an F for this trip and you&#39;ll have a punishment assignment that your parents will have to sign.&quot;<br />
<br />
Surprisingly that worked for the other kids. Edwin didn&#39;t remember the fear of punishment to be that convincing in his time, but maybe the Chronivac was very accommodating with his fantasy, or maybe he didn&#39;t remember well enough. It had been a while since he had been this young.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now let&#39;s continue the role call.&quot; Ms. Santos said, pleased the children had calmed down a bit. &quot;Benjamin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Err... h-here.&quot; A boy said, shyly raising his hand up.<br />
<br />
Ms. Santos adjusted her Chronivac, and pointed it once again, turning Benjamin quickly into a macaw rather quickly. However, as the changes finished, Benjamin looked himself over in terror, learning that he was now a female.<br />
<br />
&quot;When you are done examining yourself, Benjamin, please join your designated conservationist.&quot; Ms. Santos said, dismissing the macaw. &quot;Kevin, you&#39;re next!&quot;<br />
<br />
The role call continued, with all the students being transformed into diverse animals, each moving to one of the researchers. They were lucky that this preserve had one specialist for each species, having this many researchers made organization fairly easy for Ms. Santos.<br />
<br />
At this point, however, there were 4 jaguars, 3 monkeys, 4 macaws, 2 tapirs, 3 anacondas, 3 toucans, 2 sloths, and 3 ocelots. Edwin had noticed that Benjamin wasn&#39;t the only one to change gender, as a boy named Thomas had been turned into a female monkey, similar to others. Soon, it was his turn, being the last student left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Edwin?&quot; Ms. Santos asked, clutching the Chronivac in her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Present!&quot; Edwin said, the mystery of what Ms. Santos would decide to turn him into exciting him, as he flashed her a childish smile.<br />
<br />
Smiling back, Ms. Santos adjusted the Chronivac and pointed it and him, causing a tingling feeling to spread throughout his body. As the feeling intensified, Edwin felt himself being turned into a...</p>
