<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Frieda sat down next to her mates, Eric and Spencer; she couldn’t help but notice her father was clearly looking happy. Grinning as he came into the dining room followed by her Uncle Lance. With the two were panthers each sitting at the opposite ends of the table, next to their respective wives; Frieda notices the Lila is the only one not in her fursona. Being the only woman pregnant at the table, Lila had to avoid shifting into her fursona for the health and safety of the developing fetus in her. Frieda couldn’t help but notice Lila smile as Lance gives her a loving lick as he sits down Benton noticing the tender action, he couldn’t help but grin. Once everyone was seated; Ethel with the help of George, brought out dinner contained in stainless steel lids on top of bone china plates<br />
<br />
It was a wonderful smell that both Eric and Spencer found delightful. Removing the lids covering the plate in front of them; everyone lets off a growl of joy as a Cornish game hen along with Parisian potatoes and steam asparagus greets them. Never having Cornish hen before; Eric licks his lips as his green feline like eyes go wide with joy. Despite the presence of cutlery everybody at the table grabs the Cornish hen with their paws and starts ripping into it; separating the meat from the bone in an almost wild savage fashion. Even Amanda, the most prim and proper of the bunch could not resist sucking each bone of every morsel of meat; using her rough feline tongue to get the last bits.<br />
<br />
“Wasn’t there supposed to be parmesan crisps with dinner,” Benton using a fork to stab his potatoes.<br />
“Oh,” Lila looking sheepish; “that’s what those were.”<br />
“Don’t tell me,” Lance looking at his wife; “you ate them all before dinner.”<br />
“They were so good,” Lila purring; “and I was hungry. Plus Ethel was easily distracted with these delicious smelling birds cooking in the ovens.”<br />
“But I liked the crisps,” Benton looking shocked; “they are the best part of dinner.”<br />
“Oh pipe down,” Amanda giggling; “let it go. Lila is eating for two. Besides,” Amanda winking at her husband; “we still have dessert.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Benton purring; as he quickly finishes his plate of food.<br />
<br />
“So what’s dessert,” Eric looking at Frieda.<br />
“If I know Ethel,” Frieda smiles; “then it’s a surprise I’m not going to spoil.”<br />
“No hint,” Spencer looking at the grey furred were-panthress.<br />
“Nope,” Frieda also quickly finishing her plate; “but I’ll know you’ll like it.”<br />
<br />
With George returning to the dining room to help the were-cheetah maids clean the table in preparation for dessert; Lance felt it was time to ask his bother about something.<br />
“Benton,” Lance sipping some water; “earlier today Lila and I arrived home to see a cube van parked in our driveway. The delivery driver dropped off a box-“<br />
“With a large crib right,” Benton finishing; “so they did deliver it on time as instructed.”<br />
“Okay,” Lance looking somewhat shocked; “that answers that riddle. My next question is, you want to help me put it together?”<br />
“Benton building something,” Amanda looking flabbergasted; “are you mad Lance?”<br />
“Sure why not,” Benton answering; causing Amanda and the rest of the table to look on stunned. “Were do you intend to put the crib?”<br />
“With Lila’s brother’s help,” Lance looking at his wife; “in the home office after we move the furniture out and start turning it into a nursery.”<br />
“We have to pick up beer on the way home,” Lila answering; “Rick is going to want cold suds for this.”<br />
“I know a great color for the nursery,” Spencer chiming in; “Tardis blue!”<br />
“I like Dr. Who as well kiddo,” Lance chuckling; “but I’m not going down that rabbit hole just yet.”<br />
“We don’t even know the baby’s gender yet,” Lila speaking up before smiling; “at least not for a few more months.”<br />
“Have you picked out names,” Amanda speaking; sounding genuinely interested.<br />
“Arnold if it’s a boy,” Lance smiling; as he looks at Lila<br />
“Cathy,” Lila rubbing her belly; “if it’s a girl.”<br />
“Arnold Knight or Cathy Knight,” Benton trying out the names for the first time; “just be sure to tell mom and dad, brother.”<br />
“Oh,” Lance chuckling; “mom and dad already know. They are planning to come back to town sometime before the due date,&quot; Lance watching George renter the dining room with dessert; “they don’t want to miss the birth of their new grandcub.”<br />
<br />
Just as the table erupted into a light hearted chuckle; George began serving dessert. Being the consummate professional; the were-tiger butler first placed the small plate infront of Benton and then a second one in front of Amanda. Shortly after the were-cheetah maids arrived to assist in serving the rest of the table. Once everyone had their dessert in front of them and a fork in paw; both Benton and Lila were the first to dive right in.<br />
<br />
Dessert was an aromatic chocolate lava cake with a mint demi-glace sauce. Everyone was enjoying the tasty treat; only Spencer was busy looking at her cellphone in complete shock at what she was reading.<br />
“I generally forbid cellphones at the dinner table,” Benton staring at Spencer; “so unless it is important-“<br />
“My mother just went into labor a few minutes ago,” Spencer interrupting Benton; “she gave birth to my brother in our living room just before the ambulance arrived.”<br />
“Did anything go wrong,” Frieda helping to comfort Spencer.<br />
“No,” Spencer putting down her phone; “Grandpa said both mom and Evan junior are doing fine and are on their way to the hospital. Dad is howling in joy as he help delivered the baby.”<br />
<br />
There was a moment of silence at the table before Spencer’s phone starts ringing. Blaring the theme from Dr. Who, Spencer quickly races out of the dining room to take the call.<br />
“That was one of the early themes,” Benton looking at his brother; “wasn’t it?”<br />
“The fourth doctor I believe,” Lance thinking; “Dam I haven’t watched that in a long time.”<br />
“Shush you two,” Amanda hissing; “Spencer is talking to her father from the sound of things.<br />
<br />
“Spencer,” Evan speaking on the phone; “I wish you could see this.”<br />
“I can,” Spencer pacing out in the hall; “give me ten minutes and I’ll be at the hospital.”<br />
“No,” Evan answering; “you stay where you are. Your mother and your baby brother are doing fine. In fact your mother hissed at the ambulance driver for demanding that I shift out of my werewolf fursona before joining them to the hospital,” Evan chuckling; “seeing them look scared as Maggie shifted into her were-panther/feline hybrid fursona for the first time in eight months was a wonderful sight.”<br />
“I take it the medic were were-rats,” Spencer smirking.<br />
“No,” Evan sounding wistful; “were-rabbits. I guess they were a bit uncomfortable what with a werewolf and his hybrid mate and their recently born child riding in the back of the ambulance.”<br />
“Is mom awake,” Spencer asking; “can I talk to her?”<br />
“She is resting,” Evan sounding happy; “the entire nursing staff came by to congratulate Maggie. I guess they miss her and can’t wait for Doctor Lawson to get off of maternity leave. Your brother is now resting in the maternity ward. “When they weighed him,” Evan beaming; “Junior came to Seven pounds nine ounces.”<br />
“I can be by the hospital tomorrow then,” Spencer speaking; “will that be okay?”<br />
“That’s fine Spencer,” Evan speaking; “you take care now. Oh and don’t worry about doing the trim for the nursery,” Evan finishing the conversation; “your grandpa will probably have it done as well as the mess in the living room cleaned up.”<br />
<br />
“That was rude,” Lance watching Amanda head back to her chair after pressing her ear to the dining room door; “even for you Amanda.”<br />
“I agree with Uncle Lance,” Frieda looking unamused; “you had no business eavesdropping.”<br />
“I figured Lila would like to know what she is about to deal with when her child is due,” Amanda speaking.<br />
“After watching Ester give birth to her daughter and twin boys a year later,” Lila looking at Amanda; “I know exactly what I’m in for. So when the time comes,” Lila speaking with an air of finality; “I want that Epidural shot, especially if the labor lasts as long as it did for Ester when Jasper and Yogi came.”<br />
“Just out of curiosity,” Lance looking at his wife; “how long did it take for Ester to give birth to her twin boys?”<br />
“About eight hours,” Lila answering flatly; “pack ear plugs just in case it happens for me.”<br />
“Dad,” Frieda speaking; “can Eric and I be excused?”<br />
“Go,” Benton answering; “be with Spencer.”<br />
<br />
Back up in Frieda’s room; Eric and Frieda were comforting a stunned and happy Spencer as she comes to the realization that she is now a big sister. While Frieda was doing her best to calm Spencer down; Eric took matters into his own paws by rubbing and massaging Spencer’s ears. With them being an erogenous zone for the all three; it wasn’t long before Spencer’s incoherent babbling was soon replaced with moaning and purring.<br />
“Frieda,” Eric speaking; “do you still have any lube left?”<br />
“I think so why,” Frieda asking.<br />
“Because I feel the birth of Spencer’s brother,” Eric still rubbing Spencer’s ears; &quot;qualifies as a special occasion for our special rutting.”<br />
“You mean anal,” Spencer opening her eyes; turning around to see Eric’s smiling muzzle.<br />
“Yes,” Eric answering; “after Frieda’s and mine birthday at the same day, we haven’t had a good reason to do anal together.”<br />
“I’m not sure I want to celebrate my brother’s birthday doing that,” Spencer sighing.<br />
“We are celebrating his birth,” Eric answering; “a onetime event.”<br />
“Eric has a point,” Frieda getting the lube; “we made our birthday celebrations a yearly event. Remember?”<br />
“Well I did miss the fourth of July fun,” Spencer thinking; “when I celebrated with my mom’s family.”<br />
“Well you missed it,” Frieda smiling; “I didn’t.”<br />
“Then this onetime event is mine and mine alone,” Spencer speaks while eyeing Eric&#39;s member peaking out of his sheathe; “Now let me at that barbed rod of yours Eric. I want to make sure this lasts as long as possible.”</p>
