<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I hope in years to come someone reads this and learns from my mistake. I entered this place for fun only to find myself trapped as the prey of a great evil mind. I sit here slowly degrading to something less on the evolutionary scale than the fifty years old man who walked in this far.<br />
<br />
True as true can be I should have fought for my freedom when the signs of this trouble first appeared. Oh I relished in the sensual delight of seeing the sprouting hairs on my arms. The orange red light which glowed softly in the tunnel made me look neat.<br />
<br />
I should have turned myself back to that fate filled door and with fingers possibly bleeding tore it open to escape. Yet I didn't and for that sit here scratching this last will and testament.<br />
<br />
The reason for my fears are simple. The hair which at first made me look the more manly soon thickened. The hair became a blanket of shaggy fur which as I rubbed the sensual stuff the delight turned to fear as it began to appear on legs too.<br />
<br />
My walking down the tunnel turned to a run which I'm sure was the absolute wrong thing to have done. The more I ran the more the fur spread from sweating skin. I saw an opening far ahead and with my last once of strength burst into the open.<br />
<br />
Sunlight, warm fresh air, and the sounds of people with kids talking, laughing and worst of all looking at me!<br />
<br />
In the fit of my run I'd peeled off shirt, pants, shoes, socks, T-shirt and was left with only jockey short covering the family's jewels. The bright sun blinded me after coming into the light from the darkened tunnel of terror.<br />
<br />
I remember as if it were yesterday standing there holding myself up by leaning on the tunnel opening. The sounds from crowds of people soon made me aware I stood almost naked. A fifty year old man with a beer gut is not a fine form to be standing about half naked in a crowd. <br />
<br />
Shaking my head to rid the cobwebs from thoughts I hear my fate being spoken by a child nearby. The first words still burn in my memory as if cast from the devil himself on my like a blanket of fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy see him shake his head, can I throw him a Nanna?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nanna, the thought of that word ran in my mind as if at first I should reach out and becon to recieve it. Then feeling my arms rise and fingers becon to get what I would not truely care for the sight was enough to make me scream aloud.<br />
<br />
Black shaggy hairs and blackened fingers reached into the air in hope of recieving the tasty treat offered by the child. I remember the stare at the child and then dropping my vision to fingers wiggling. The finger nails looking black and much like claws.<br />
<br />
Reaching for my delight I lose all footing and fall rolling insctinctively into a somersalt. As my body spread open and I lay flat on the ground I'm visited by some great ape who looks down into my face.<br />
<br />
The mumbling words from the ape seem to have odd meaning to me, but I layed there quiet and scared. This large black ape touched it's hand to my face. The feel of the leathered skin was oily and I sniffed at it like a puppy with it's master.<br />
<br />
As I peered ever so carefully off to one side the sight of her breasts hanging in open air made me wish to touch them. The thoughts raced in my mind as I strained to hold my movements in check. The desire seemed to mix with the sensual smell emmited from her lovely form. The thought of touching and a wild irrational lust was forming inside my mind.<br />
<br />
Lust, desire, thrills, I seem to be directed to her as if she was a willing mate. &quot;I'm married!&quot; my mind screams at the sight of my roaming black hand touches her breast. The hand trails down her form and soon the fingers tickle her black cunt.<br />
<br />
I drew back the hand as the feeling of a massive erection was about to burst my shorts. Suddenly she took hold of my shorts and in a quick move ripped them down my legs and toss them into a water pond.<br />
<br />
The yells and screams mixed with laughter hit my ears and made me all the more run for cover. Yet the female ape had other ideas as she touched the massive rod which was now erect and in sight of all.<br />
<br />
She moved so swift and with intentions she's planned long ago. As one of her lovely hands held my shoulder to the ground she leeped over my torso and crouched above my groin. I looked down my black shaggy haired belly to see a black penis almost the size of a blue ribbon beer can at it's base. The shaft lightened in color to almost dark brown near the tip. A circumcised male was me but male what I had no clue then! <br />
<br />
My eyes went wide as I saw her lowering form touch that stiff penis. The end of which parted her cunt in a slow and easy motion. She lowered herself onto my rod and thus forced it up and deep into her vagina.<br />
<br />
I remember we moaned of the pleasure together and the laughter of people in the distance. As my penis seemed to change it's name in my thoughts from the word used to discribe a human apendage to one of the male animal world. A cock, pressed deep into the warm moistness of her beauty. My eyes closed as the passion of animal lust surged into every part of my being. <br />
<br />
In a quick action we rolled over together still locked in rich wild sexual contact. Now I was over her and doing it mission style we made love. The feel of such thrusting surge of my seed rushing down the cock made me jerk. The dear female below me moaned as hot seed spewed into her hot body. Our mutual sweat from those moments merged to bind us as if married in a church. She was mine as I was her's and we rolled about till a man walked over with a sharp stinging stick.<br />
<br />
I screamed as he touch my balls and let loose an electric charge. The odd thing was that it made me all the stiffer and seemed to urge me into continued mounting. <br />
<br />
The man yelled at us to think of what we were doing and it played across our minds. Slowly she and I pressed the other away until we stood standing shamed by the man from the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go to the cell and stay there till the crowd leaves!&quot; the man ordered.<br />
<br />
She took my hand in hers and walking on one arm and her hind legs took me back into the rocks to her cave.<br />
<br />
The wild goings on and my strange feelings made me go with her and I obeyed as a trained animal. As we entered her cave the looking glass wall showed a female ape hualing along her mated. Hand in hand we passed the glass viewing port. I stopped of a second to see my blue eyes peering from the face of a great ape. <br />
<br />
All I could utter at that moment was a muffled, &quot;Ooo Great !&quot;</p>
