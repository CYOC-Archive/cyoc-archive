<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alongside the searching of history, the two were able to find the book, placed neatly on a cabinet which Megan (or Macy?) quickly grabbed. Part of her wanted to open the book immediately to get them out of this mess, but her newfound mental maturity and memories as Macy decided to carefully read through things this time. She also wanted to do it standing up, but it was clear just by looking at each other that sitting down would do the two some good. <br />
<br />
The two had only walked around the first floor, which was only a modest size, but both were panting heavily, very much unfamiliar with the added weights of their breasts and bellies. Their parents occasionally kicking inside of them didn&#39;t help either. Megan occasionally went down on her knees to catch her breath, while Alan (or Alice?) tried to suck up any exhaustion &#39;like a man&#39;, making up for crying not only in his sister-turned-wife&#39;s arms but seeing the recording of their marriage. In the moment, Alan chalked it up to female hormones. Needless to say, the attempt was clearly causing him more trouble than his former sibling in the long run, as he soon felt like he could pass out at any moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh...why did Mom have to open the book...this suuuuucks...&quot; Alan whined as he felt another kick inside of him, moaning in a soprano tone as he slowly waddled to an arm chair. <br />
<br />
Megan rushed ahead, relatively speaking, getting to a different seat first. Though getting her aching body some rest was amazing, there was another reason why she went ahead of her former brother. &quot;I know, right! It could&#39;ve at least given us some underwear...I don&#39;t want to be going around looking at your butt...&quot; she complained as she settled her own bare rear in the seat. What bothered her wasn&#39;t being disgusted. It was that... she liked it. <br />
<br />
His fat, exposed ass bobbing up and down in such exaggerated motions gave her a similar feeling to seeing the abs of a boy band star. Not to mention whenever she knelt down to rest, she was able to get a clear view of his pussy, with light pubic hair surrounding it. She hoped not looking at those would fully disperse those feelings, but even now she felt that same way looking at Alan&#39;s massive milky tits. She tried to avoid staring completely. She couldn&#39;t look down though...seeing her chest and belly like they were felt weird too... <br />
<br />
Normally, Alan would have argued back with Megan for such a comment, but frankly he was too tired to try. He also felt less aggressive towards Megan for some reason...more comfortable towards her. It wasn&#39;t just because they were in the same situation, but something deeper. That new history and those new memories he had as Alice must have gotten to him more than he thought. He let out a feminine grunt as he sat down considering this. <br />
<br />
As soon as Alan&#39;s ass hit the cushion, his train of thought was broken from another kick inside. He placed a hand on his belly out of instinct, groaning from a mix of the kick alongside looking down to see his changed body. He had tits and a pussy before from the book, but this was even more overwhelming. Unlike before, he was more matured. His brain was now fully developed, giving him the cognition to fully recognize the situation...he was old enough to be considered a &#39;MILF&#39; by his friends...he was holding a child inside of him now for God&#39;s sake! One of his parents! <br />
<br />
Holding his stomach, he wondered which one ended up inside of him. His dad kicking him into focus would certainly make sense, but his mom being agitated that she was on the opposite end of a &#39;first&#39; birth could have made sense too. He soon thought how the hits could have been involuntary, which brought him to the idea that the two&#39;s minds may not even be developed yet to think at all. Were they developed enough to even be considered human? He panted louder with eyes shut tight, beginning to rub his stomach with his manicured hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alan...are you okay?&quot; Megan tensed, lifting herself up a little, ready to go to his side if need be. Why she felt so worried, she didn&#39;t yet recognize.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Uhm...y-yes...I think...so...&quot; Alan whispered after a few more deep breaths. &quot;Just...tired...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...if you say so. I&#39;ll read through the book. Find something to change us all into something better.&quot; <br />
<br />
Megan was barely able to respectfully turn the first page before Alan spoke up, voice still in a whisper &quot;W-Wait...before changing us, you have to check something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...okay. What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to check if it can work on beings who can&#39;t see the book. Or beings who aren&#39;t humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do yo-&quot; Before she could finish her question, her eyes widened in realization - thanks in part to her own developed mind allowing her to catch on. &quot;Oh...Oh my god, are you thinking that they wouldn&#39;t be transformed?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pause. Alan knew the possibility. He was just struggling to think about what it would mean for their parents to survive. &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan began skimming through the book, trying not to give herself over to panic to make sure she didn&#39;t treat the book disrespectfully and randomly change things again. Alan rested as she did so. He didn&#39;t falling asleep thanks to whoever was hitting his stomach, but he was at least able to regain much of his strength from before walking around the house. He hoped Megan would find he was clearly mistaken, but he was slowly considering that he might have to get used to this new body&#39;s limits. <br />
<br />
It was about 10 minutes before Megan spoke again.<br />
<br />
Her face was pale white as she looked to her partner.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure since I can&#39;t read it all so quickly...but I think you might be right, Alan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; the former boy choked, rubbing his chin and biting his lip. &quot;We...We can&#39;t risk it. Not now. If fetuses can&#39;t change and we try it, they&#39;ll...&quot; he stopped himself short as he began to tear up, at least temporarily giving up the notion of being the &#39;tough one&#39; in this.<br />
<br />
Megan couldn&#39;t argue, at least from the information they had. She knew they had to stay like this, at the very least until they confirmed the process would be safe for fetuses, or somehow finding Organata again. Neither of which seemed likely. <br />
<br />
The worst case scenario was that the two would have to give birth to not accidentally wipe their parents out of existence. That was increasingly becoming the only scenario. Soon, the former siblings were now crying together again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...why did you have to open it so quickly!?&quot; Megan shouted looking between her own stomach and Alan&#39;s, as if Janet would be able to hear them. Of course, there was no confirmation of this, the only possible sign of communication being the irregular kicks inside of the mothers to be.</p>
