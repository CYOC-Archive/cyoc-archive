<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Murray’s day was filled with a whirlwind of awkward, surreal, and surprisingly supportive interactions. In the hallway, a group of schoolgirls clustered around him, their eyes wide with curiosity. &quot;Oh my gosh, it’s like you’re actually pregnant!&quot; one exclaimed, her tone a mix of amazement and fascination. Another chimed in, &quot;Do you feel kicks? That’s so wild! You’re literally growing a person in there!&quot; While their enthusiasm was somewhat comforting, Murray couldn’t shake the lingering embarrassment as their questions came rapid-fire. &quot;Do you have cravings? Are you going to get stretch marks?!&quot; He forced a smile and nodded along, trying to keep the mood light.<br />
<br />
Later, some of Johnathan’s clothed friends, Malik and Javier approached him, their expressions a confusing blend of concern and disbelief. <br />
&quot;So... uh, is Johnathan, like... still alive in there?&quot; Javier asked, glancing at Murray’s slightly rounded belly, which was unheard of these days for the naked boys who were perpetually toned. <br />
&quot;Or is he gone for good?&quot; Malik added, fidgeting awkwardly. <br />
Murray tried to explain the situation as best he could, though it didn’t make things any less bizarre. &quot;He’s... gone I think, or at least the original Johnathan is, and like a new Johnathan is developing, I guess? The teacher said he’ll be back with all his memories. Just, uh, give it a day or so..&quot; <br />
The guys exchanged uneasy glances, muttering amongst themselves about how fucked up all this was. <br />
<br />
By the end of the school day, Murray’s belly had grown significantly, now unmistakably resembling someone four months pregnant. The accelerated development of Jonathan’s fetus was evident in the way Murray’s body shifted and stretched to accommodate the growing life within. Each passing hour brought noticeable changes, and by the time the final bell rang, Murray’s walk was slower, his hands instinctively supporting the weight of his swollen belly.<br />
<br />
When Murray got home, his parents were waiting, their faces a mix of shock and worry as they took in his obviously pregnant appearance. Without clothes he was unable to do anything to hide it from them. <br />
&quot;What on earth happened to you?!&quot; his mom exclaimed, rushing over to him. His dad stood frozen, jaw slack, as he tried to process what he was seeing. <br />
Murray stammered out an explanation, his voice thick with embarrassment. &quot;It’s... it’s part of the experiment at school. I’m... carrying Johnathan.&quot; <br />
His mom gasped, her hands instinctively reaching toward his swollen belly but stopping short. &quot;This is insane! How could they let this happen?&quot; she demanded, her voice cracking.<br />
His dad finally found his words, muttering, &quot;This has to be illegal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dinner that night was tense, his parents exchanging worried whispers while Murray sat awkwardly at the table, acutely aware of the weight in his belly and the strange, surreal reality his life had become.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The next morning, Murray woke to a surprising pressure in his abdomen and found himself visibly eight months pregnant. His belly had expanded overnight, now firm and rounded. His abdomen was covered in deep, angry stretch marks that crisscrossed his skin, a visible sign of the rapid expansion his body had undergone in such a short time. The weight felt heavy, and the internal pressure from carrying the fetus was already becoming uncomfortable. His morning wood was pressed up hard and rubbing precum all over his protruding under belly. Staring at his reflection, he could hardly believe the rapid transformation; his chest now sported plump, engorged breasts with large, puffy nipples that dripped milk with every touch.<br />
<br />
Murray&#39;s arrival at school that morning caused an immediate stir. His belly, now resembling that of someone eight months pregnant, drew wide-eyed stares and hushed whispers from classmates and teachers alike. Some students couldn&#39;t resist asking questions, their curiosity outweighing any sense of tact.<br />
&quot;How are you even walking around like that?&quot; one girl exclaimed, eyes fixated on his protruding belly.<br />
Murray, cheeks flushed with embarrassment, muttered something about a &quot;school project&quot; and kept moving.<br />
<br />
A group of clothed boys, including Malik and Javier, watched him pass. Their immature curiosity getting the better of themselves they sauntered over, snickering among themselves.<br />
&quot;Hey, Murray,&quot; Javier said with a mischievous grin. &quot;How&#39;s the mom life treating you?&quot;<br />
&quot;So... does this mean we’re getting Johnathan back soon?&quot; Malik asked quietly.<br />
Before Murray could respond, Javier reached out and gave his chest a playful flick, brushing a finger over one of his increasingly sensitive nipples. <br />
“Hey you have bigger boobs than most of the girls here now!”<br />
&quot;Cut it out!&quot; Murray snapped, pulling back instinctively, his cheeks turning a deep shade of red. But the boys only laughed harder, Javier stepped back with hands up in mock protest, &quot;Whoa, careful, you might get milk all over my shirt man!&quot;<br />
Before things could get out of hand Murray’s friends found him and shooed off the jerks.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
With half the day over, Murray waddled into the health class. His swollen belly leading the way, drawing every eye in the room. The weight of his pregnancy made each step deliberate, and his labored breathing betrayed the discomfort of carrying what felt like a full-term child. Mr. Scaftie greeted him with a clinical smile, gesturing for him to take his place at the front of the class to continue the demonstration. The students watched intently as he carefully lowered himself onto the exam table brought in for today, his belly taut and rounded like an overinflated balloon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Class, as you can see, Murray&#39;s pregnancy has advanced significantly since yesterday,&quot; Mr. Scaftie began, placing his hands on Murray&#39;s belly to emphasize the size. He then moved his hands to one of Murray’s developed breasts and explained how the hormones produced during pregnancy would cause the breasts of the expected mothers to produce milk for the baby. He then squeezed a little causing the nipple to shoot milk out at the class. That caused most of the students to chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Today, we’ll examine the development of the fetus and discuss the birthing process.&quot; As the teacher explained, he applied gel and used an ultrasound to display the fetus on the monitor, revealing a fully formed, wriggling baby Johnathan. Gasps and murmurs filled the room as the reality of the demonstration sank in.<br />
<br />
Murray winced slightly as the teacher injected him to induce contractions, explaining how the body prepares for birth. Some students took notes, others stared in awe, while a few exchanged uneasy glances. <br />
<br />
As the demonstration reached its climax, Murray groaned through a series of sharp contractions. Unlike most normal births he heard about or seen in media, this one didn’t seem to hurt, just felt immensely uncomfortable as his vagina stretched to deliver the fetus rapidly. With one final push and an involuntary cry, Murray gave birth to a fully developed baby Johnathan, slick and crying loudly as he was cradled in the teacher’s arms, umbilical cord still linked to Murray’s uterus.<br />
<br />
Mr. Scaftie, ever clinical, announced, &quot;Class, meet Johnathan—restored through an accelerated gestation process. Now, we’ll insert old Johnathan’s brain structure&quot; Producing a sleek device, the teacher carefully placed it against the newborn&#39;s temple, activating the transfer of the original Johnathan’s preserved memories. The baby’s cries stilled as his eyes suddenly focused, and the class fell silent, watching the tiny form&#39;s expressions shift with recognition and confusion.<br />
<br />
Johnathan, now fully aware, blinked at the room before croaking out in a startlingly familiar but child-lke tone, &quot;What... what just happened?&quot; Gasps erupted, and a few students even clapped, marveling at the process. Murray, exhausted and stunned, leaned back, catching his breath as he stared at the baby-turned-peer. &quot;Well,&quot; Johnathan muttered, his tiny face scrunching in disbelief as he got a good look at his newborn body, &quot;this is going to take some getting used to.&quot;</p>
