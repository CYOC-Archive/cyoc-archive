<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexander‘s hair fell out and he felt a moderate pain, as his cranium elongated backwards and it became wider as well, veins on its skin became visible and grew larger and larger.<br />
<br />
Along with it his brain increased as well and he could feel, as his inteligence became higher. All of his memories came onto surface and his knowledge was enhanced significantly.<br />
<br />
He could feel, as his face was reshaping itself as well, making his mouth narrower. His nose sunk into his face, leaving only two nostril holes. His ears became smaller and smaller, until they disappeared completely.<br />
<br />
His eyes changed their shape and enlarged, losing their characteristics and becoming large, almond shaped, glistening, black orbs.<br />
<br />
Soon his whole body tingled and his torso and limbs started to losing muscle mass. His whole body flattened out, just like his unused legs. His skeleton became more and more visible under his skin, which now was changing from its original color to simple grey. His member shrunk and disappeared, along with his pubic and any other hair on his body.<br />
<br />
At last, his hands and feet reformed themselves and became four fingered, on his hand much longer, than his human fingers were.<br />
<br />
When he felt the transofrmation stopped, he slowly sit up and was greatly surprised, when he could feel his legs again!<br />
<br />
With exploding joy he bended his toes and twisted his ankles.<br />
<br />
He got off from the metal table, standing on his legs, first time in his life.<br />
<br />
He took some steps to try out his legs and it was something... wonderful.<br />
<br />
He then instictively walked to the door, and typed the entering code to the small panel next to it, however, instead of digits or letters various symbols were on them, so in normal circumstances he shouldn’t know the code.<br />
<br />
The door opened and he stepped into the room.<br />
<br />
It was bigger then the previous and there were some well known grey aliens, sitting before large screens, through which they were inspecting the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings, our newest member. Feel yourself home, because now it is.&quot; Spoke one them, but not with his mouth, but telepathically.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can’t believe it... so you guys really exist!&quot; He answered, suprised, not using his mouth as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and we’re glad to see you enthusiastic. We hope you’re not mad at us about turning you into one of us.&quot; Said another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not! I’m just... surprised greatly... and you guys, you healed my legs!&quot; He said looking down at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we studied your body, we realized your legs were disfunctional and we were thinking, that restricts you, but we can help and we did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don’t know how can I thank you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you’re the ones who landed in Roswell back then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the three of them were our emissaries, but the entry to your atmosphere failed, the ship crashed and the rest you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, I apologize, what my kind... my former kind did with your... our mates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was not nice gesture, but we can’t change that. We don’t blame the whole humanity and especially not you. That’s why you are here now, as one of us. Along with your body we studied your mind as well and realized that you are not all the same. That’s why we healed your legs and gave you a chance to another life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even my mind? That’s sounds crazy...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, to humans, our bodies shows similarities, but physically and especially technologically and mentally we are far more advanced race, than humanity. You can maybe sense, that your knowledge and inteligence has been enhanced as well by far beyond human limits. Therefore you could use our entering code.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... and that’s cool...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexander looked at his new body. He noticed he was slightly shorter, than the others, but they were not as short as depicted in the movies. They were almost same high as adult humans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing...&quot; He said, while raised his hands and bended his long fingers.<br />
<br />
One of the greys pushed a button on the panel and the wall opened itself and behind it was a magnificent sight; the Earth, as it seen from approximately Medium-Earth Orbit.<br />
<br />
Alexander felt a hand touching his shoulder. One of his new fellows stood next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought you’d like to see you former home, because soon our ship departs.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
He was right. Alexander watched Earth wordless, as his life as human ended and life as one of the Zeta Reticulans was about to begin.</p>
