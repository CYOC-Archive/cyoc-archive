<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After he&#39;d gotten off the phone with Dennis, Patrick headed back to his room. The plan was for the three of them to meet up at Tristan&#39;s place in about an hour. Sitting down at his desk, he found he was struck by how it seemed he was the only girl in their Dungeons and Dragons group. Looking at the laptop, he flipped up the screen and brought it out hibernation mode.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac programme still running, he wondered what he should do about it. On the one hand, he found he didn&#39;t mind the changes he made, though was still waiting for the other high heeled shoe, as it were, to drop, proving there was something wrong. He liked his height the way it, that the way he now moved was no longer the uncoordinated clumsy one he’d had before, and thought it felt right to have breasts. Still not sure what the full fallout would be for switching his genetics from XY to XX, he considered the one thing that was off was not so much the way people acted around him, like some thought of him as a girl, yet at the same time like he was a boy, it was the way reality seemed to be different.<br />
<br />
Clothes he&#39;d never had worn before could not only be found in dresser, but also his closet, as he&#39;d discovered when he tossed his sleepwear in the laundry hamper. What covered his bed was more on par with what girl might have, as the comforter was pastel pink with a pastel blue border and had a kawaii unicorn printed on it, whilst the sheets were white with a multi-coloured unicorn print. Thinking about this, and other things he&#39;d noticed, like the pictures on his desk, he spotted his student ID and picking it up, he read:<br />
<br />
Patrick McHenry<br />
DoB: 20-03-06<br />
Age: Sixteen<br />
Height: 5&#39;<br />
Weight: 97lb<br />
Sex: Female<br />
<br />
with a his current picture on the right side of the information printed. Finding it was different from when he&#39;d gotten it almost a month ago when school had started, he frowned. Before, he knew his height had been listed at five foot eleven, whilst his weight was closer to a hundred and sixty-three pounds. Puzzled by the alteration of his school identification, as it proved to him that with everything he did with the Chronivac it morphed the world around him, he reached out and tapped out a few things on his profile. Wanting to see if he could witness reality changing, he decided Patrick wasn’t a very feminine name, switched his name to Rowena, adding the name  Rowan in parentheses to indicate that it was his nickname, and setting the parameters to the usual of only he was aware and permanent until he changed them, he was about to hit execute when he paused.<br />
<br />
The picture on the card he saw was of his profile from the neck up, so all he could see was that he had on a dark shirt. This not really interesting him, though he did wish he had a better view of his chest and whether the image reflected how he now had tits, though he suspected it did, his focus was instead his face.<br />
<br />
Angular, narrow, busy eyebrows, it wasn&#39;t the face of a girl he decided. Going back to his profile, he thinned his eyebrows and made them more feminine, whilst he made his face more like a girl&#39;s normal, rounded one. Making sure the discomfort was at its lowest, and that everything was still the same, he hit the icon to execute his commands. Gasping as a warmth rushed through his face, he was surprised when it actually spread and went down into his body. Settling into breasts first, he uttered a low moan at the feel of the soft fabric that cupped the two mounds of flesh, how it brushed against his erect, sensitive nipples, before the feeling went even lower and a warmth spread through his groin. Understanding he had become sexually aroused, his first instinct was to try and figure out what had caused it as he absently put a hand to his crotch and began to rub at it.<br />
<br />
His attention drawn to his school ID with difficulty, and he was momentarily distracted, even as he uttered another gasp, both at what he saw and what he felt as his free hand pressed and kneaded the crotch of his pants. Watching as his face in the picture morphed, he found it just as weird as watching the word &quot;Patrick&quot; slowly vanish, to almost instantly be replaced by the name &quot;Rowan&quot;. Dropping the card on his desk as he smiled, he felt his body spasm and a sort of euphoric sensation flooded over him, leaving to believe that, if he still could’ve done so, he would have blown his load into his underwear. Standing slowly, he went and shut his bedroom door, and after giving it a bit of thought, undressed and headed over to the mirror.<br />
<br />
Naked as the day he was born, Patrick, now certain their name was Rowena, though everyone called them Rowan, stared at the person reflected back. The way they stood, their face, how their chest pushed out in two firm mounds that were alabaster white with pale, pink erect nipples, to their way of seeing it, it was girl they saw. The only thing that seemed to say otherwise was their hands and feet, still too big, and that their waist wasn&#39;t pinched, nor was their hips, butt and thighs pronounced like how a girl&#39;s body would develop. With a start, even as their eyes settled on the small cock and scrotum, Rowan realised that at some point they&#39;d stop referring to themselves by male pronouns and had begun to refer to themselves with gender neutral ones. Wondering about, they also couldn&#39;t help but ask themselves, &quot;Have I taken this too far? And if so, should I undo it? Or finish what I started?&quot;</p>
