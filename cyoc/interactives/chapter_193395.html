<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Emrys trusted Ceridwen on this matter, but not enough to let her out of his sight until he could be certain the former King was far-away and safe from her influence. “I accept, my services are yours. A-a-and I&#39;d rather let my body be y-yours too, tonight.” His cheeks burned with embarrassment as she stammered out the last part. Emrys knew he could probably have found some other excuse but the thought of her pinning him down and then holding him close kept pressing on his mind.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;d serve this whore! Traitor! I sh–” Rhys began to spit bile, but was interrupted by a firm squeeze of her hands that brought the slender femboy to his knees, expression twisted with the effort of trying to keep himself standing. Emrys hoped it be easier this way, no matter how the words the prince had said hurt.<br />
<br />
“Should do nothing to my newly appointed Court Witch. As for you, Prince Rhys, and your knights,” the Queen couldn&#39;t keep the wry smirk twisting the edges of her lips away, “are exiled from Ambria. Though I do expect you back soon, just don&#39;t take too long or even your most loyal of your former subjects will see the truth of my rule. That day will be sweet. As for the War Crown...,” she bent down, leaning her head against Rhys&#39; shoulder and whispered something in his ear as she snatched the crown from the ground and placed it on her forehead. Emrys couldn&#39;t hear what was said, but the femboy looked furious, “...where it always belonged.”<br />
<br />
As soon as her hands fell away from his shoulders, Rhys snatched his sword from the ground, looking at it as he considered if he could cut Ceridwen down where she stood. But then his shoulders slumped slightly, the tension in the air easing away. “Men! Take your swords and shields. Let&#39;s leave, for now.” Something of the old king returned even as he struggled keeping the blade balanced in his hand. Emrys again feeling his heart ache and throb at the sight.<br />
<br />
The young enchanter couldn&#39;t resist the urge, and when Rhys came within reach he pressed his lips against the prince&#39;s. Emrys felt himself melt into the softness, and for a single moment the prince invited him as he parted and opened his mouth. Emrys shuddered, knowing some part of the prince also wanted this to happen, sharing the same love and intense attraction that had arisen in them after the Witch&#39;s spell. He didn&#39;t think either of them had been interested in men before, but that difference seemed academic as the femboys&#39; tongues kissed and Emrys tried to press himself further into the prince&#39;s embrace.<br />
<br />
Rhys had a different idea as the suddenness of the witchboy&#39;s act faded. “G-get away from me! I se-see you&#39;re also a whore like my aunt.” He wrenched himself away, using his hands to push them part. The prince&#39;s slender slik-clad fingers lingered tenderly on his lips, but his narrowed eyes were burning with rage. Before Emrys could apologize, the prince had gone past him to join up with his former knights. Another few seconds and they were gone entirely from the battlements.<br />
<br />
The pain from earlier returned with a vengeance and began to repeatedly stick its metaphorical knife into him. Tears started to fall down the femboy&#39;s cheek, making a mess of his makeup as he stared forlornly at the door the prince had left through.<br />
<br />
“This wasn&#39;t part of the deal!” A growly, well, more an attempt at one, feminine voice angrily called out from behind Emrys. <br />
<br />
Turning around, the enchanter noticed the dragon that had hovered behind the queen was gone, replaced with a slender dragon femboy. Aside from the strategically placed red scales, claws, small wings, and horns, he was entirely naked. Then there was the very much not human and instead draconic cock hanging between his legs. The boy was stomping his feet, trying to look intimidating as he, red-faced argued, with the woman heads taller and broader than him. Emrys choked on the laughter from the sheer absurdity, forgetting about his pain for the moment.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not funny, witchling!” The dragon boy said once he noticed Emry&#39;s interruption. Yet his instance only made more laughter bubble up. “I&#39;m Calegor! Eater of humans. Taker of sheeps. Destroyer of Castle Aurvale! Fear me!” He proudly proclaimed and comically thrust out his flat and thin chest.<br />
<br />
“Enough of the magic must have remained to effect you once I had proclaimed myself Queen. It was all men and women of the kingdom. And you Callie, are a man as well as and one of my subjects, best not to forget the latter.” It seemed that he had as Calegor immediately retreated with a slightly apologetic expression. She turned away from the chastened dragon. “Now, how are you feeling, Emrys?” <br />
<br />
The Queen walked over to her Court Witch, concern in her voice. Unable to again help himself as he saw the kind gesture, Emrys rushed forward and clutched his fingers around her surcoat and buried his face against her stomach. He keenly felt his own weakness as he accepted the strength shared by the powerfully built arms and hands that enveloped him. Not caring who she was, or what she had done, the young femboy breathed in deeply of her strong yet still feminine scent, trying to steady himself as she accepted the pain he felt without judgement. <br />
<br />
A hand cupped one of Emrys&#39; cheeks and the femboy didn&#39;t resist as she gently tilted his head upward. She used her thumb brush away a stray lock of black hair. “You could easily have made him yours. Why didn&#39;t you?” There was no reproach, only curiosity.<br />
<br />
Emrys nodded, knowing he could&#39;ve with the spells now at his disposable. “You wanted him to leave, my Queen.” The femboy said, doing his best to avoid the question. “Shouldn&#39;t I have done as you wanted?” He needily began rubbing himself against her, trying to steer her mind, and his, elsewhere. He kissed her palm then looked up at her with fluttering and innocent eyes that were anything but. Seeing the effect he had on her while clad in his negligee when she returned the sultry gaze, scared Emrys a little. “Please, let&#39;s not talk about Rh-rhys anymore, this your victory not his.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, well. I&#39;ll let this go for now since you&#39;re so adorable Emrys. And I should celebrate shouldn&#39;t I.”</p>
