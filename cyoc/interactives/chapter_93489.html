<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;REALLY NEED BOOBS WHICH WOULD GROW MUCH FASTER THAN THOSE!&quot; the girl shouted. Jason was surprised how upset she was about this. Apparently upset enough to let everyone in the park know.<br />
<br />
But then he got surprised by something else. He suddenly felt very... dizzy. Over the course of few seconds all the sounds of a park in spring became muffled and his vision started to go dark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whaa?.. What is going...&quot; he only managed to mutter as he felt himself slipping into unconsciousness.<br />
<br />
He realized something was wrong as soon as he regained consciousness even though neither his hearing nor vision have returned yet. He couldn&#39;t move and his back was attached to something rhythmically jumping up at down at a walking pace, what seemed to him like 20 or 30 inches at the time. Actually, it wasn&#39;t just his back that was attached to that &#39;something&#39;. The behind of his entire body seemed stuck to something - his arms, his legs everything. Which was weird because at the same time he couldn&#39;t really feel his limbs. It wasn&#39;t like he felt any piece of his body was missing, more like he didn&#39;t HAVE limbs. Which obviously couldn&#39;t be true, right?<br />
<br />
Jason realized that &#39;attached&#39; wasn&#39;t probably the best word to his position. More like &#39;plastered&#39;. He felt kind of like someone spread him on a table and then rolled him and the table around with kitchen foil, plastering him to the surface which then was lifted to be vertical. Except that the foil also felt like a part of him because he can feel it touching another stretchy layer on top of it?.. The more he thought about his situation the more bizarre and indescribable it seemed.<br />
<br />
Speaking of being spread out on something - that sensation was far to strong to make physical sense. Jason felt like he was stretched over an area ten feet across. Just like in these medieval torture techniques where they would take a delinquent by their legs and arms and keep pulling apart until they could pull no more. But without pain, just a slight discomfort. And without the arms and legs. His entire body just felt like a single blob, stretched thin and flat against a very vertically mobile wall. And also sore. Almost like a muscle just worked out, but in his entire body.<br />
<br />
Just before he realized he was also naked, he noticed that he didn&#39;t all feel like a very flattened blob. There was something in right in the middle, right about where his crotch would have been. It felt like his penis was protruding straight in front of him, even though it was soft. And despite it being soft it also felt quite... oversized. In the absence of arms and legs it felt like his only limb, almost foot long and several inches across, squashed to his body by the tight and irritating layer in front of him. Moreover, his dick didn&#39;t seem like it quite ended at a base of the shaft. He felt the same sensitive tissue his weird new &#39;penis&#39; was made of also stretched out in a circle centered at his appendage, crawling on his skin. <br />
<br />
His skin, which now he realized was also the &#39;foil&#39; that kept him attached to the wall behind him. It was both his and not his at the same time. He could feel through it but it reached far beyond where he was located...<br />
<br />
It was at this point when he felt his other senses return. First the vision. Somehow he knew it was back even though his surroundings remained largely dark - the tight layer of fabric in front of him keeping most of the light out. He felt like his vision was located a foot or two above his &#39;penis&#39; but to his panic there was no head or eyes that he could associate with it. He tried looking down to see the protrusion of his &#39;dick&#39;. In the faint lighting he could only make out a pink, thick cylinder surrounded by equally pink circle of tissue covered by small bumps. The cylinder was bent, squashed between the dark-blue fabric in front of him and his own body.<br />
<br />
He knew his hearing was returning as he heard dull thumping somewhere far behind him. <br />
<br />
Thump-thump. Thump-thump. - it was like a distant bass drum trying to imitate a heartbeat. &quot;Trying and succeeding.&quot; Jason thought. A sound of chaotically running water and sporadic bubbles joined the bass drum. But all of that was in the background.<br />
<br />
The foreground of the sound seemed suspiciously close to the environment of the park where he passed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Jason became just fully aware of the situation. &quot;I passed out and now I&#39;m here paralyzed and probably tied up with my dick up in this weird place!&quot; <br />
<br />
The sounds of the park surprised him. If someone was to kidnap him and do God-knows-what to him, would they stay in the very park they got him from? This nothing seemed to add up.<br />
<br />
Then he heard a voice of a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just get used to it?&quot; she said. She sounded clearer and louder than the bass heart-drum and her voice was coming somewhere far to the left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you know...&quot; this caught Jason by a total surprise. The new voice, replying the first girl, was like nothing else he heard in his entire life. It sounded loud. Not overwhelmingly loud but still, louder than any natural voice he ever heard. And it was muffled. It kinda sounded like there was a stupidly powerful set of speakers trying to carry this girl&#39;s voice from behind a wall. And indeed, it seemed to coming from behind the wall he was attached to. From behind and above. He tried to turn his vision upwards as the girl continued speaking but he failed to see anything other than faint flight outside the layer of the stretchy blue fabric surrounding him from all around.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want me to say then, huh?&quot; the first girl continued. That&#39;s when Jason remembered he&#39;s heard this conversation before. He&#39;s heard it just before he passed out. He knew the other girl, the one with strangely close, loud and muffled voice would get really upset about something. Just... What was it?<br />
<br />
&quot;I JUST REALLY NEED BOOBS WHICH WOULD GROW MUCH FASTER THAN THOSE!&quot;</p>
