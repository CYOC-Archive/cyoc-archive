<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Author&#39;s note: inspired by &quot;Pink Plastic Clubbing Sandals&quot; by Auri and &quot;You, the influencer&quot; by qkdeakko).<br />
<br />
The store was spacious, and full of seemingly magical items, walking down the halls you see many accessories and clothes, but other than the absurd 99% discount you saw on the advertisements, none of them really catch your attention all that much. The accessories of the hall you were walking through were mostly suited for the girly type, and you questioned what you were even doing here, while walking back to the men&#39;s section. However, for not paying attention to where you were stepping you accidentally bumped your shoe against something at the very bottom of the shelf... something heavy.<br />
You crouched down to inspect whatever it was that you accidentally bumped, and, going past several accessories, bags and make up, you find a gigantic pair of wedge sandals, their golden light reflecting straight into your eyes, they were around size 20, you think, at least compared to your own average size, and they seemed almost as if they were custom made for someone way too tall, but still, curiosity struck you, and as the discount did mention &quot;All magical items are just one dollar&quot;, you struggle to pick one of the sandals up and turn it around, both from the size of it and its weight.<br />
Curiosity was getting the best of you. &quot;How big are these? Who would use such things?&quot; you ask to yourself as you look down at your own shoes. You compare sizes, sole against sole, realizing how the sandal&#39;s was around 15 cm longer than your own sole, and just like you had noticed, it was heavy, you struggle a bit more to hold it up. You didn&#39;t seem to notice the glow coming out of it, shining against your foot, to which you quickly pull away.<br />
&quot;Oh shit, what did that do?&quot; you say confused, witnessing the sandal stop glowing once its away from your shoe. <br />
You look everywhere, with fear and confusion in your eyes, for an employee to ask about this situation, but it would seem this part of the store was desolate aside from you. &quot;What was even-&quot;... You&#39;re interrupted when a cold, shivering sensation runs down your spine. What&#39;s worse, you weren&#39;t even able to see what&#39;s going on in your shoes, your feet glowing for a second, instants before they begin to pulse.<br />
You draw your attention back to your feet, only to feel a sliding sensation inside your socks, tickling your soles.<br />
Your feet pulsing again, the socks stretching, as your soles seem to grow just a bit more, you start to panic and attempt to stand back up, but something seems to be hindering you, tightness in your shoes that make it hard to move. You lean with your back against the shelf in an effort to keep your balance, but the sliding sensation doesn&#39;t stop, only increasing the amount of stretching, as it makes the fabric of the socks press hard against your skin, a light gasp escapes your lips as the sensation goes all the way up to the tip of your toes. You start to wonder... What exactly happened? You were just fooling around with the giant sandals and... Wait... Could they... &quot;It couldn&#39;t be... There&#39;s no way these giant shoes would affect me, right?&quot;.<br />
A ripping sound stops your train of thought, and you feel the tip of your toes press against a harder surface, the inside of your shoes. Wait, what happened to your socks?!- There&#39;s no time to think about that when the constricting feeling gets worse. The cold sensation runs down your back once again, and a sudden burning feeling begins to crawl its way from the tips of your toes up your heels, and to your ankles, but before you could question what was going on, the burning feeling moved up, the tingles inside your ripped socks getting more and more intense, and with it came a sudden and very pleasurable feeling in your arches. &quot;H-HOLY FUCK...UGH!... what is...&quot; you attempt to say, but the words don&#39;t seem to form properly. Your voice... sounds so... different, but before you can properly react, the cold, painful feeling is back once again, this time at the soles of your feet, the bottoms pulsing once again. The burning feeling began to slowly crawl up your calves, your tingling soles giving way to an almost numb sensation as your legs start to feel a bit... Tight... and warmer than normal, the tingles going up and down, causing you to tremble slightly, which makes the shelves around you rattle, you&#39;re a bit worried that they could fall on top of you, but you were way more focused on the weird sensations coming out of your legs.<br />
As your legs pulsed, your feet started to ache due to the compression of your shoes, your toes pressing against the tips, making them bulge and stretch, and you yelp loudly when your shoes give away to the pressure, the tip of your big toe on each foot pushing through the tips, tearing them slightly, and revealing a bit of what lies underneath, and that was your nail... a new one. It looked like it had already a thick, shiny, and healthy coat of light blue polish. You groaned as they grew even more, toes and heels ripping the shoes into rags, exposing your feet and revealing the soles. The skin felt soft, and was almost glowing a bit, even if it was still covered in sweat, a slight shine that you only now started to notice. You noticed as the nail on each of your big toes stretched longer. The same was happening with your other toes, as you notice the tips of your fingers twitching, but your attention was focused on your soft, pale toes, and how they seemed to be... further away?<br />
Looking back down, your feet were slowly, yet steadily growing, but they looked smaller from your view... in fact, everything looked much smaller, the shelves, the items... A tingle on your legs and more stretching, sliding sensations hint why, your pants were being pushed further and further back, and they felt like they were tightening in the back, making you fall back down. As your legs were being constricted, and the burning, painful sensation only got worse. The otherwise adequately sized pants only reached slightly past your knees now, revealing smooth, hairless, pale skin on your calves, and they kept going up. They were starting to ride up, making you blush slightly as the bottoms were getting exposed to the cold air, the painful cold sensation runs up and down your calves once more, but you were starting to get used to it, it wasn&#39;t painful anymore, you notice the small cracks between each toe, a soft blue shimmer emanating from them as your toes stretch and your heels pulsate in response to the sensations.<br />
Following the growth of your long legs, you felt your back shiver once more as your torso and arms began to catch up to the changes in your lower half, and your clothes only get tighter and tighter. A sudden burning on your upper back made you shiver in a way you had never felt before, it made you want to grab and tear your own shirt, but a loud, tearing sound tells you that it won&#39;t be necessary, your tummy was now exposed and your sleeves were now separated from the rest of your shirt as you outgrew it immensely, ripping it in several areas that allowed you to have more freedom of movement... and growth.<br />
Your arms lengthened, starting to normalize your proportions as they reached slightly past your hips, all the way down to your plumping thighs, which had also grown slightly. You sigh in relief and groan as you felt your bones crack, a new growth spurt never feels comfortable, you were thankful that the pain seemed to subside with each second, and only a slight, numbing sensation remained. You could only wonder how much more would you grow? You felt so huge already, you wondered what was it like to stand up straight again and stretch, you didn&#39;t realize how much you missed standing tall until this moment... you knew you could do it.<br />
A wave of relief and ecstasy flows through your body as the numbing sensations on your lower back and shoulders become a pleasant, warm sensation that fills you up inside, making you tremble again, a feeling you want to remember as your hips and butt finally catch up to the growth, but, you still weren&#39;t satisfied... you still felt like you were growing, even your hands and fingers were getting longer, you start to worry about how long you will get as the burning sensation fills them up with warmth and the tips of your fingers lengthen and become more defined.<br />
You lean down a bit more to reach your foot with your hand, a much easier task now, you still were shocked as to how tall you were now. Your fingers finally reached the toes, the warmth in your arms making them tingle, a small and sudden wave of pleasure coursing through your arm. &quot;My fingers are so soft...&quot;, you say as your hand strokes the side of the big toe, the soft skin only making you more excited, you wondered just how sensitive it could be...<br />
As you start to feel a tingling sensation on your soles, you immediately take notice of the strange sensation of having your toes get longer and your heels bigger, but as your fingers feel the newly formed smooth, pale skin of your heels and toes, you wonder how tall you&#39;re now, even sitting down you were as tall as most women... how did you end up so tall? And what could possibly happen next? You looked like an amazon right now, and you loved it... even if the floor was now quite messy with all your ripped clothes. You start to play with the skin between your fingers and toes as the burning sensation reaches your shoulders and hands. The feeling on the tips of your fingers were like little explosions of warmth, the fingers themselves pulsing slightly as you grab a nearby mirror with the newly formed digits, noticing how big your hand was in comparison, and how long and shiny your new stiletto nails are. <br />
You put your mirror down to get a closer look at the other foot, it seemed like your feet were finally done, and the tingling sensation on them didn&#39;t bother you much. They were pretty big and long, but not overly so.<br />
With the burning sensations now almost done, and just in time, the feeling on your toes began to dissipate, replaced by the burning sensation that moved from your arms to your head and neck, it felt weird at first, and made your vision go blurry for a few seconds. Suddenly being so big and having magic rework your face didn&#39;t help either.<br />
<br />
Opening your eyes again, you&#39;re shocked to see their bright, light brown color in your reflection, sparkling ever so slightly as you tilt your head, noticing how smooth the skin is around your eyes, as if it had no imperfections at all, and your lips were starting to get puffy, full and naturally plump, perfect for pouty lips. Your cheekbones became more defined, and so did your jaw, your facial structure smoothening in the process, becoming well defined and pretty. You blink a couple times in disbelief, your hands shaking as you rub your eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;<br />
Your heart races as you look down and grab the mirror to see the rest of your new self... Only to be greeted with a soft, cute and feminine, although still boyish face with beautiful and healthy-looking lips and shiny, full eyelashes. <br />
You didn&#39;t notice your voice was slightly higher and softer, probably thanks to the lengthening, thinning neck, giving it a strong air of elegance, along with your soft, defined jaw. You still had your Adam&#39;s apple, although it was much smaller and nearly didn&#39;t protrude.<br />
<br />
A chill ran down your spine once more, and as you felt your heart rate go up and down in pure excitement and happiness, you notice as the tingling sensation on the top of your head increased and moved to your scalp, filling you with a sense of dread... would your hair be fine? You loved it the way it was... <br />
The magic had other plans for you though, your hair got softer, shinier, ans brighter, signaling some good care and maintenance, but the more drastic changes were the shaving of your sides, leaving you with some fade, and the growth of your hair right at the top of your head, which remained slightly raised, becoming a complete, beautiful, femme version of a temp fade quiff.<br />
&quot;Not bad&quot; you think. At least you still had a full head of hair. You&#39;re still surprised by that high pitched voice coming out of your plump lips, your new body seems to be used to talk with a falsetto, and your own natural voice almost sounded out of place, as it sounded way deeper in comparison... and, was it just you, or your head felt much heavier?<br />
As if to answer that, the burning sensation began to slowly dissipate, being replaced with the familiar, numbing feeling, this time on your face and your eyelashes, a bit of eyeliner appeared on your lower lid, making your eyelashes appear a bit more voluminous and pronounced, mascara, contour, blush, lipstick, everything made your face look even more androgynous than before, you could help but put your hand on your face and caress the absurdly beautiful visage. The only thing that kept you from feeling like a completely different person were the remnants of the manhood that remained on you, and the memories of how your life had been up to this point, although this was in jeopardy too.<br />
<br />
You felt yourself raise even more. <br />
What&#39;s going on? Were you still growing?... not quite. Being sat down, what was really happening is that your rear and thighs plumped even more, their girth becoming so big that you couldn&#39;t sit down comfortably. Your butt stretched more,  you were preoccupied with how your butt felt more... bouncier, and how it was making you grow, expanding your hips and thighs along with them. This just happened to be very pleasurable, making you shiver, tense your body, and stretch your legs, bumping against the other shelf across the hall and making some items fall from the impact, you still weren&#39;t used to your absurd size. Your heart was still pounding, and with that pounding came an aching that began to crawl through your body. The growth in your butt was beginning to stop, and it was now around twice its original size. You still felt it expanding slowly as the rest of your body didn&#39;t feel any different from before, with the exception of a small growth on your chest and hips, both areas tingled pleasantly.<br />
<br />
With your hips finishing their widening and causing your pants (which were already shorts-sized) to shrink even more, you quickly remove the remains of your shirt to examine the changes in your chest, the cloth now looking like a rag on your much bigger body.<br />
The breeze gives you shivers when you notice the affected area, plump, pinky nipples on top of your soft, pale chest.<br />
Your chest starts to grow just a little, making the small nubs on the tips of your chest tingle pleasantly. It was still a boyish chest, you were still a young 20-something man after all, but it gave your chest a feeling of softness that was definitely femme. A smile appears on your lips for the first time since you got into this situation, a smile you quickly hide with your hands. Your heart is pounding, you didn&#39;t want this to stop... this was so fun, you wonder why didn&#39;t you do this earlier? Your body felt so amazing! And so were the sensations on your nipples as they swell more. It felt weird at first, but so good!<br />
As you enjoy the changes that happened to you, a warm, burning feeling suddenly rushes up from the inside of your thighs to the center of your buttocks, as the plumping of your rear had begun once more. This time, a pleasant feeling filled your mind with thoughts of your butt and hips being bigger, as well as making you look taller than before.<br />
<br />
The numb sensation returned, and it wasn&#39;t long before your knees began to spread, the remaining pieces of your pants groaning as they became more and more short in the middle. &quot;So much, so much... it&#39;s so good. I-I can&#39;t... ugh... more&quot;<br />
You didn&#39;t notice when exactly, but a bulge appeared in the front of your pants, as if you were a bit turned on by your new body. This is only proven by the sensation of something rubbing against your groin every time you squirm or move slightly, making your cheeks and ears red, &quot;This is... so hot&quot;. The tightness in the center of your pants continued for some time, the bulge becoming more and more pronounced, until your rear was satisfied with the plumping, the tingle going all the way to your plumping, soft and smooth, hips.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s then that the burning sensation went away and the numbness began to make your mind fill up with images and feelings of your own softness, roundness, and femininity, making you even more turned on than you already were, you began to softly and slowly rub the bulge that had formed on your groin. It responded with a few twitches, snaking down one of your leg holes and creating a bulge there too. You kept rubbing yourself as you began to get lost in the pleasure. &quot;It&#39;s... so soft... so... full...&quot;. You bite your plump lip to prevent yourself from letting out any sound, although that was getting more and more difficult with the thoughts in your mind telling you to just moan and give in. Your mind was still trying to think about what was going to happen, and the possibilities that could result from this situation. The warm and pleasant sensation continued, even as you continued to rub and squirm on your rear, a new growth began that pushed the pinky tip past the pant&#39;s leg hole.<br />
The sensations you&#39;re feeling were so intense, you could only notice the growth happening when the fabric of your pants started to make a loud ripping sound, and your hand brushed against a much different surface.<br />
The remains of your pants and underwear were the last bits of clothes to fall off your large body, leaving you completely naked, and setting the latest growth free. You had no control of your body whatsoever when you felt your large hands grab something even larger, a bulging, smooth shaft that pulsated when you touched it, you looked at the floor, where it seemed to be looking back at you. You&#39;re now realizing just how big you&#39;re, you were like twice your old size now... and even bigger than you were at first, but it feels right. It feels perfect. The tingle spreads from your waist down to the inside of your thighs as your cock throbs. You noticed the veins in the shaft were much thicker than before, pulsing with every breath, and it looked quite smooth, much like your soft ballsack. The area was completely hairless, and your soft hands with long stiletto nails caressing the soft pale rod made you enjoy how femme and... Gay? You are...<br />
Your cock and ballsack... they were... bigger, but still very girly looking. The size and smoothness were very impressive, it was not long before your balls started to tighten up. It didn&#39;t look like the changes in your crotch were done.<br />
As you let your eyes wander to the rest of your body, your hands wander and play with the soft and sensitive head of your cock, the burning sensation going from your shaft to your ass once more.<br />
&quot;Holy fuck! M-More!&quot;<br />
It was so hot you could barely handle it. As you enjoy the warmth spreading across your plump asscheeks, a slight tingle appeared inside them, you knew what would happen soon... and you loved it. You start to feel yourself slowly and rhythmically contracting around nothing, a strange empty feeling in your insides made your hole want to be filled. You wondered how it would be, the warmth spreading through your inner walls and the coldness that was starting to make your ass tingle a lot...<br />
A sharp intake of air escapes your mouth when the sensations on your rear stopped, making the empty feeling only grow bigger as your cock began to twitch. &quot;Ah, ah, ohh...&quot; You notice something inside you begin to... move?...<br />
A loud moan escapes your lips as a big bulge moves slowly and rhythmically inwards, you feel your hips moving as you contract around the unknown thing inside you. As it goes deeper into your ass, it presses against your inner walls and gives your shaft a nice rub every time it moves.<br />
Looking down, you notice the same familiar glow that you saw on the sandals that caused all of this wrapped around your cock and squeezed under your rear... It&#39;s... The magic!<br />
You groaned in pleasure even more, struggling to snap out of the haze as you start to remember that the pleasure you felt during the changes made you ease into them, accept them. Y-You can&#39;t allow that! You try to stop your body, but it acted as if it had a mind of it&#39;s own! <br />
Slamming your cheeks against the floor and forcing more of that magical glowing construct inside of you as your rod is pleasurably stroked by the same energy, you shake your head and hold it with your long hands as you fight the incoming orgasm... <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop!! I&#39;m not this guy! I&#39;m not-...&quot; <br />
You pant as your pleasure spikes again, your nipples perked up and your cheeks blushing intensely as you try to resist it... But it&#39;s no use... &quot;I&#39;m not... I&#39;m not g-girlie...&quot;. Your own mind and memories begin to shift, to change, making it easier for the changes to come. As you keep telling yourself those words, it seems the magic was coming back... it was like a cold and soft tingle... your insides, your... your dick, were pulsating with need, the empty feeling and the desire to be filled returning with a vengeance.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m n-not a s-sistaah, I&#39;m...&quot; You clench your teeth, you try to convince yourself that this isn&#39;t you, but it&#39;s too late. You feel twitching, a tensing sensation... &quot;I&#39;m not ga-&quot;<br />
Your train of thought is interrupted as you let out a loud, feminine and long moan, your cock and ass pulsing as the magic squeezes your shaft... You couldn&#39;t take it anymore. The emptiness, the rubbing, your soft and big body... it was way too much... and so, your resistance finally breaks.<br />
&quot;GAY!! I&#39;m not gaah...&quot;<br />
Your mind was breaking. You finally cum hard, and a strange cold, yet pleasurable sensation fills your insides, your ass contracting in a fast and desperate pace around the magic construct as the one on your shaft strokes it, milking you for all it&#39;s worth. Thick, femme and girly shots of semen escape your smooth rod, splattering the shelf in front of you, along with your big feet. You can only place your hands on your hair, close your eyes, push your hips forward, and moan.<br />
The relief that came after cumming was so intense, that you couldn&#39;t even process the cold sensation slowly retracting from your shaft and ass, while the remnants of your male personality started to break and fade, making room for the magic to take over, your mind was starting to change, and so were your memories, your thoughts... and you didn&#39;t care.<br />
As the glowing construct disappears, and your head stops spinning, you open your eyes and realize just how big you are, beautiful, soft and girly. Your soft and big hands run through your smooth, soft legs, and it&#39;s then that you notice the magic wasn&#39;t done with you... it never was, the cold sensation was back, and so was the burning, this time on your feet, and it felt so good. Your soles begin to pulse as they stretch, growing larger and longer, and making you gasp in pleasure. You don&#39;t even notice when your high heel nails lengthen slightly.<br />
As your soles pulse and stretch, the burning feeling on your calves starts, making them pulse and lengthen slightly too, which made your thighs follow suit. The growth spurt had resumed, and you loved it... the cold and numbing sensation filling up your head with thoughts of height and diva behavior, thoughts of fashion and beauty, thoughts of being femme and gay.<br />
<br />
Placing your long nails on your now big feet, you notice the cold, numbing sensation as it spreads from your soles to the tips of your toes, which pulsed again, making you shiver and moan loudly, you also notice how your feet lengthen AGAIN. You were way taller, and your body was almost done, the cold numbing sensation travels up to your calves, and, grabbing the shelf to your side, you stand up.<br />
&quot;Oh my...&quot;<br />
You look down. Your feet, which were huge to begin with, looked so small from your distance... All the display shelves barely reached your chest... You could watch every nook and cranny of the shop from here. <br />
&quot;Oh my gosh...&quot; you cover your mouth in shock. That voice was even fruitier than before... &quot;What&#39;s with my voice!?&quot; you ask with that bitchy tone again<br />
A slight wave of fear takes you for a moment, but your cock throbs once again as you&#39;re reminded of your changes, the fear slowly fading. The changes... you still had them. And as you stand there, in your almost naked, soft, smooth and huge body, with the rest of your male self fading away, you feel as your changes were finally done.<br />
Your hands tremble in anticipation as they slide down your soft, plump, hairless and silky smooth body, to grab your huge ass, feeling every inch of those amazing butt cheeks.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s so... BIG...!&quot; You exclaim as you look back at yourself in a mirror and gasp in surprise, it felt so soft, and it looked even bigger than it felt... You couldn&#39;t even believe how soft it was.<br />
Hell, the full body mirror couldn&#39;t even reflect all of you! You had to bend slightly to be able to see anything past your nipples.<br />
As you slide your hands down to the front to caress your dick again, the realization of the size difference makes your jaw drop, a bit of pre escapes the tip, coating the floor beneath. You ignore how much of a mess you could make with this big of a body. You were like two feet taller than the average man now! How much more bigger were you compared to your old body? And why did this make you feel so good?<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so big... I&#39;m gorgeous! And so femme!&quot;<br />
You laugh in a high-pitched, yet manly tone, as some remains of what was left of the old you fade away, another thought came into mind.<br />
&quot;How am I gonna fit anywhere?&quot;<br />
You look back at the entrance, the store was big enough, but, it wouldn&#39;t be an issue, considering how much money and fame could afford. <br />
Wait... what? Since when did you have money and fame?...<br />
It didn&#39;t matter, what was important now was how tall and beautiful you were... And how you needed clothes ASAP.<br />
&quot;Fuck, I&#39;m such a ditz...&quot; you groan as you walk away from the mirror. &quot;This place is, like, shitty as hell, where am I gonna find something that fits me?&quot;<br />
You look back at the ruined pile of clothes, your OLD clothes. You had no use for them now. You walk away from it, leaving the items on the floor for some employee to clean up later, you didn&#39;t care. your eyes wandering towards the golden wedges that now looked way smaller than before. The memories of how you got here were a bit blurry, but you know you didn&#39;t look this good until you got these.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, fuck it&quot; you smile while picking up the shoes. They felt much lighter now, and while holding them, you stylishly walked all over the shop looking for cute clothes that fit you, hips swinging side to side as your plump rear bounces, as if you were used to walk down the catwalk. Naked, with ass and dick bouncing... Not like there was anyone here, or they could do anything to you.<br />
It was hard to find anything made for someone who&#39;s eight feet tall, but you picked up some panties, a black sweater that could vaguely hint at breasts (although it would just your very effeminate chest), a small golden chain necklace, blue jeans, and your favorite wedge sandals.<br />
With everything set, you walked to the dressing room, and made yourself comfortable. The sweater was a bit too tight, but you could handle it... At least it covered your nipples and your hairless chest... the pants on the other hand, well, they fit you like a glove, but that was just how you liked it.<br />
You had no problem with your ass, you loved how big and round it was, the pants hugged it in all the right places, and the bulge it created looked so big... even when you tucked your dick inside your panties. Your ass looked amazing in those, and your cock could be seen from a mile away! <br />
The golden wedges looked pretty nice in your feet, despite being quite old, and it wasn&#39;t long before you started to get used to your new height, walking gracefully and posing in front of the full body mirror, even though you had to bend over to look at your beautiful face. Damn it, why&#39;d it have to be just 6 feet something? You were so gorgeous, you couldn&#39;t help but admire your own body... and with every moment, the last remnants of what was left of the old you faded away.<br />
<br />
You took a photo of yourself, it looked amazing, you didn&#39;t even pay attention to the extremely pricey, latest iPhone you just pulled out of your pocket.<br />
&quot;So gay...&quot; you say in a sassy tone as you start to type on the phone, typing quickly despite your long nails. Your high pitched voice sounding very feminine, sexy, and bitchy.<br />
&quot;Look at the hot stuff I found today!&quot; You type for your Instagram story.<br />
Your eyes widen, you didn&#39;t even notice until it was already too late that you didn&#39;t even button up your jeans in that one pic you just sent to your followers, who were now bombarding you with comments.<br />
&quot;Oh, shit! I think I just gave my fans a treat! Let&#39;s see what they have to say!&quot;, you smile teasingly as you open the comments section, scrolling through it with a wide grin after seeing your own bulge in those black, expensive panties.<br />
&quot;Fu~uck, did I really send that pic to my 5 million followers?!&quot;, you exclaim in delight.<br />
You can only roll your eyes as your fans ask for more pics.<br />
&quot;As if! I&#39;m not a free show, you know?&quot; You said with a bitchy tone before locking your phone and putting it back in your pocket. Your phone ringed with even more notifications as reality changed even more, you had everything, YouTube channels, Twitter, TikTok, followers rising, six million, seven million, eight million... ten million...<br />
Your phone stopped ringing, and so did your brain, it felt weird... almost as if you had been here all your life.<br />
It&#39;s then that you realize that you&#39;re so rich, famous, and beautiful, that you don&#39;t need to stay in this shitty store anymore!<br />
You walk out of the dressing room, grabbing your expensive Louis Vuitton purse. However, reality seemed to have changed even more than your massive follower count and multi-million dollar social media career, your clothes seemed to magically fit you to perfection in a split second. In fact, the store didn&#39;t even seem to be the same! You walked down to the check-out line, noticing how everything looked so much more expensive, and there was a lot of stuff that wasn&#39;t there when you were looking for clothes. It didn&#39;t take long before you reached the counter, where a cute blonde lady was waiting for you, she looked at you with an eager expression, and then her jaw dropped, she looked shocked.<br />
&quot;A-Are you...&quot;</p>
