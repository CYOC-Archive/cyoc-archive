<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ayaka Firewood isn&#39;t your average normal girl, she barelly reached 20 years, she is the tallest student of her class, she has pure brown eyes with beautiful brunette hair.<br />
<br />
She studies biology in a rich school, in the hopes that she could become a vet.<br />
<br />
Today she just got her summer hoilday and she barelly started enjoying it. She was laying in her bed, playing Pokemon Sun. She almost played every single Pokemon game that has been released, she loved almost every single Pokemon that have been released. But one of them was her most favorite.<br />
<br />
She loved the Pokemon Charizard, she had a thing for dragons in general, she loved Charizard so much that she would sometimes even do drawings of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally! Finished this darn fight.&quot; Exclaimed Ayaka as she slowly got up from her bed and went to her kitchen, leaving her console on her desk.<br />
<br />
Her mother and father needed to go to diffrent countries due to work, Ayaka didn&#39;t mind being alone in her house, it was nice and quiet.<br />
<br />
She opened her fridge and slowly made herself a sandwich and started eating it.<br />
<br />
While she was eating it, she was looking outside at the enormous garden her family owned, she almost finished her sandwich but she saw something shining in the grass.<br />
<br />
She finished her sandwich and due to her interest, she went outside to have a look, she slowly went near the object that emitted the shine.<br />
<br />
To her suprise, it looked like a fire gem! she went and took a closer look at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah.... It looks just like in the game!&quot; She exclaimed, she slowly reached her hand to pick it up, but as her index finger made contact with the gem, it burned her, it wasn&#39;t just a regular burn, it felt like her finger was sinked in pure lava.<br />
<br />
Ayaka quickly retreated her finger as she fell on her back, rolling left and right while holding her finger tightly with her other hand, her eyes were shut tightly.<br />
<br />
She slowly inspected her finger and saw that it was perfectly fine! She slowly got up and searched for the gem, but it was gone!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... I really need to check up a doctor...&quot; She said, as she slowly headed back to her house, she felt even more hungry, she opened the fridge, she couldn&#39;t see anything that would satisfy her, untill she saw the raw lamb meat, she quickly grabbed it and started devouring, ignoring the fact that it was raw, she kept devouring the raw meat like a wild animal, eventually she finished it, realizing that she just downed it all uncooked!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh gosh.... I will probably throw up...&quot; She said, she expected to be sick and throw up at any minute, but.... She was alright! She felt like she ate the beast lamb meat in the planet! &quot;Something is definetly wrong here.&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
She quickly headed up to her bedroom, after she downed the entire meat, she felt extremely tired. &quot;A quick nap won&#39;t hurt!&quot; She said, as she slowly laid down and closed her eyes.<br />
<br />
Eventually she started having one of her weirdest dreams ever, she was ontop of a cliff, in the middle of the night, watching the beautiful night sky, while also pleasing HIS member, &quot;Char~!!!&quot; he moaned, as he sticked his tongue out, realizing that he was a Charizard!<br />
<br />
Ayaka quickly woke up as she heard herself moaning in the middle of her sleep, she rubbed her eyes and looked at her clock, it was 19:55, she saw that the sun was beginning to set, &quot;What the hell did i just dream?&quot; she asked as she slowly got up and went to the bathroom, she undressed herself and quickly took a shower.<br />
<br />
She felt relaxed as she felt the water touching her beautiful cream white skin, she took a handfull of shampoo and covered her body in it, she covered her hair, her legs and her arms, untill she reached her breasts, she constantly touched them as they jiggled, eventually she snapped out of it, &quot;What the hell is wrong with me...&quot; she asked herself.<br />
<br />
A few minutes passed and she finished her shower, she went to her room with her hair soaking wet. She looked outside and saw that it was night time, she looked at the moon, full and shining.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t pull her eyes away from the moon, she blinked a few times, trying to snap out of it, not realizing that as she blinked, her eyes changed from a bright brown to a bright blue.<br />
<br />
She eventually snapped out of it, only to feel her stomach burning, &quot;Agh! My stomach! It hurts!&quot; she gasped, as she gripped her stomach tightly, dropping the towel that covered her body, it eventually stopped burning.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-It stopped?&quot; She asked, only to feel a tingling sensation on her fingers, she looked and saw that her nails were slowly turning into long white claws, &quot;W-What?!&quot; she panicked, only to feel her muscles growing in strength, they kept growing and growing, she looked like a professional female body builder, &quot;What is happening?!&quot; she shouted, panicking even more, she saw bright orange scales covering her hands, slowly traveling up to her muscular arms, not even realizing that she was becoming taller!<br />
<br />
She was panicking, what was happening to her?! She kept panicking more and more, untill... &quot;W-Wait, those scales... They&#39;re the scales of a Charizard!&quot; She exclaimed, she was turning into her favorite pokemon! A rush of excitment filled her mind.<br />
<br />
She saw bright yellow scales slowly covering her chest, not even realizing that her breasts were almost gone! She saw that she had a scaley 6 pack, &quot;Char.... Yes!&quot; she exclaimed, ignoring the &quot;char&quot; that left her lips, she touched her scaley chest , feeling turned on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Charr.... So... Hot... So horn-OH~!!!&quot; She moaned, as she felt a wave of heat hitting her genital area, she laid her back on a wall and watched her clitoris pushing forward, growing, untill it fully resembled a human member, untill scales slowly covered it, fully resembling a dick of a Charizard!<br />
<br />
&quot;Charr.... Need to.....&quot; Ayaka panted, as HE wrapped one of his hands around his new member, slowly pleasing himself, &quot;Grr.... Char!&quot; he moaned, as he kept pumping, feeling the changes accelerating.<br />
<br />
His feet digits were covered in scales, slowly fusing together, fully resembling the paws of a Charizard, the scales slowly traveled up to his bulky legs, covering them in scales.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hng... Char....&quot; He moaned again, feeling a wave of pain as a tail erupted from his back, &quot;Yes.... zard....&quot; he moaned again, he felt his member grow more and more, untill it reached 10 inches!<br />
<br />
&quot;GRRR.... CHAR! CHANGE ME MORE!&quot; He shouted, feeling a wave of pain on his back as a pair of wings bursted from his back, &quot;YES! YES! CHARIZARD!&quot; He shouted, feeling the changes reaching his neck, &quot;ALMOST... THERE...&quot; he moaned, hearing his new deep masculine voice, his hair quickly fell off and his face pushed forward, turning into a snout of a Charizard.<br />
<br />
&quot;GRRRRR.... CHAAAARIZAAAAAAARD!!!!!&quot; He roared in triumph, as the tip of his tail emenated a small fire and he shot a jet of fire out of his mouth, while his member shot his seed across his room.<br />
<br />
He slowly got up, feeling his balance shift, he saw his mirror and slowly went towards it and he saw himself, a 6 feet tall male werecharizard!<br />
<br />
He stroked his member, &quot;Mrr...&quot; he purred, looking at it, untill he felt extremely tired, he slowly headed to his bed and fell asleep.</p>
