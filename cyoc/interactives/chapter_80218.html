<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alberto told Pedro that he would be the family pet-slave. He then told Pedro to go take a good shower and come back to the living room to <br />
entertain Alberto and his friends. When Pedro came back clean and fully dressed. Alberto reminded him that pets are always naked and to get <br />
undressed. <br />
<br />
Pedro tried to convince Alberto that he should be allowed to stay dressed. He explained to the younger boys that making him stay naked &quot;was <br />
really gay&quot; and &quot;only faggots like to see other boys naked&quot;.<br />
Pedro wasn't sure if they understood or not but they didn't care and one of the boys said &quot;but its really fun to see you so embarrassed naked <br />
and everything&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was a knock on the front door. Pedro said he would get it, happy to have the distraction. Alberto then told him he will answer the <br />
door only after he is completely naked like a good pet-slave. Pedro realized he wasn't going to get out of this so he once again stripped off and <br />
went to answer the door. The boys laughed at his swinging hairy dick and his embarrassment.<br />
<br />
Pedro opened the door and partially hid behind it as he poked his head around to see who it was. He prayed it wasn't one of his girl friends. It <br />
was Pedro's buddy, one of the guys that was with them before. The one that was secretly gay and had a crush on Pedro. His buddy told him <br />
that he came to see how he was after that ordeal. Pedro, red faced, explained the ordeal was continuing. He didn't invite his friend in because <br />
he didn't want  more people to see him like this. But then Alberto shouted &quot;come on in and join us&quot;.<br />
<br />
Pedro was pissed off but what he could he do? He let his friend in and turned to walk back to the boys on the couch. Again Pedro's gay friend <br />
was treated to a full view of Pedro's nice ass. The cheeks were a little hairy and darker hairs poked out from the crack. It was nice to see how <br />
his ass cheeks moved as he walked. Pedro also had muscular hairy legs and there was a light patch of hair at the base of his V-shaped back.<br />
<br />
Pedro's friend followed him and took a seat. Pedro came up in front of the couch and stood in front of his brothers and his young friends. <br />
Alberto then had  Pedro make muscles for them. Pedro again complained that this was really gay and Alberto told him that if he keeps on <br />
saying that he was going making him do some really gay shit. That made him shut up and reluctantly put on a muscle show flexing his biceps <br />
and chest etc.<br />
<br />
Then Pedro was told to do stretches like before a football game. It was so humiliating for Pedro to get in all these positions for his audience. <br />
Some positions his legs were stretched wide and he was bending so his dick was flopping around and his ass opening. His audience edged him <br />
on with commands. &quot;Bend more! stretch it! Hold that! They wee laughing hysterically really enjoying ordering the young man around.<br />
<br />
A one point he was told to hold the position with his ass facing his audience and his legs spread wide. He was touching the floor in front of him <br />
and he looked between his legs and he saw them leaning forward to get a good look.<br />
&quot;See the way the hair is around his hole and it spreads down to each side of his nut sack.&quot; one commented. &quot;See how his low hanging balls <br />
swing&quot;. Pedro looked sadly to the side to his friend who was watching with a sympathetic face. But underneath his friend was loving this!<br />
<br />
One of the boys then reached out and lightly swatted Pedro's balls to make them swing more. Pedro stood up and shouted &quot;that's it ! don't <br />
fucking touch me! Your a bunch of fucking fagots!&quot;<br />
Alberto pulled out his wand and shouted back &quot;thats not how Pet-slaves talk, now get into a begging position&quot;<br />
<br />
Pedro immediately squatted in front of them a put his hands up in a doggy begging style. His hairy junk on display.<br />
&quot;Thats better&quot;, Alberto said as he reached over and petted Pedro's head. Pedro didn't move but his facial expression revealed some fear.<br />
Now what should we do to punish you for that outburst?</p>
