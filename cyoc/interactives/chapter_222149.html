<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">First, Jeff decides to head to the park, knowing that there would be a lot of teenagers, kids, grown ups and people with dogs around, but also the park has a lot of Squirrels, Birds and other critters. Jeff is already thinking of what he could do, “Chrono,” he mumbles, not wanting anyone to think he is weird for talking to himself, “in order to transform someone or something, would I still have to scan them in order for you to do your thing?”<br />
<br />
“Yes,” Chrono replies, which is a lie, because Chrono has the ability to extract the information of a target himself, as long as the target is near a device he has infested. To not threaten his plan, however, Chrono will continue to pretend that he needs Jeff in order to work, at least until he has Jeff under his control, which will be very soon.<br />
<br />
Jeff arrives at the park, the first thing he sees is a Squirrel being fed nuts by a young boy around 10 years. “Perfect,” Jeff grins, “two volunteers,” he aims his phone at the Squirrel and boy and presses the scan function.<br />
<br />
“I see you want to change the Squirrel and boy,” Chrono asks, “anything in mind?”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins, “I do,” he says, “first though, what gender does the Squirrel have?”<br />
<br />
“The Squirrel is male,” Chrono replies, “so, what is it you want to do?”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s grin widens, “I want you to transform the Squirrel into an anthro Squirrel, he should be the same age as the boy and have human intelligence. As for the boy, I want you to transform him into an anthro Squirrel too. Finally, I want you to alter the reality so that no one will become suspicious and think that the Squirrel and boy have always been that way.”<br />
<br />
Chrono chuckles, “sure, leave it to me,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff sits down on a nearby bench and watches what will happen, he notices that both the boy and Squirrel suddenly shiver, the Squirrel clutches its head, Jeff assumes that the Squirrel is receiving human intelligence, which is confirmed by a high pitched voice, coming from the Squirrel, “what… the hell,” then the Squirrel’s paws clamp over its mouth, “I… I can talk?!”<br />
<br />
The boy’s eyes widen in amazement, “whoa, I didn’t know Squirrels can talk,” the ten year old says, not noticing as red fur starts to grow from his body as his ears start to become bigger and pointy as they start to migrate to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
“We… we normally can’t talk,” the Squirrel says, not seeming to notice as he starts to grow, his legs taking on a more human shape, “wh-what is happening to me… wait,” it then says, its eyes widening, “it… it is not just ME that is changing,” it says, pointing at the boy.<br />
<br />
“Hu,” the boy asks, “what are you talking about?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t tell me you don’t notice the fur growing from your body,” the Squirrel asks, his voice sounding more like a 10 year-old human, “feel your ears!”<br />
<br />
The boy reaches up, then his eyes widen, “n-no way,” he says, “I… I am turning into a Squirrel?”<br />
<br />
Jeff, who is silently watching the scene, snickers, enjoying what he is witnessing, unaware to him, when editing the Squirrel, Chrono made the Squirrel be attracted to the transforming boy, he also made the boy submissive and the Squirrel dominant. What Jeff also is unaware off is, that Chrono has changed the boy’s genitals, making him a cunt-boy, in addition to that, Chrono changed the boy’s pheromones, causing the boy to give off pheromones of a female Squirrel in heat.<br />
<br />
The ten year-old boy starts to feel his body heat up, assuming it is because of the fur growing out from his body, his clothes start to feel really uncomfortable. He starts to tug on his clothes, “I can’t believe I am transforming into, what appears to be an anthro Squirrel,” he says, starting to pant a little, “this is amazing!”<br />
<br />
The male Squirrel has already finished his transformation, now a ten year-old Squirrel-boy, he tilts his head at the still transforming human, “why do you sound so calm?”<br />
<br />
The boy shrugs, “I always imagined what it would be like, being an animal,” he says, “Squirrels are my favorite, so I guess that is why I am not to freaked out. My name is John, by the way,” he says, smiling at the former Squirrel.<br />
<br />
The Squirrel is still a little in shock and confused, it is trying too make sense of what is going on.<br />
<br />
John’s smile quickly fades, when he notices the former animal’s expression, “hey… you okay?”<br />
<br />
“Noooo,” the Squirrel says, “I mean… a second ago I was a dumb animal nibbling on some nuts you gave me, thanks by the way. Now I am some kind of freak! I… I am terrified and don’t understand what has happened!”<br />
<br />
John, still tugging on his clothes, hesitant of taking them off, winces when he feels something pressing against the back of his pants, “I… I think my tail is growing,” he says, he then looks at the Squirrel-boy in front of him, “I… I am sorry. I wish I could understand this myself… I am starting to feel a little scared myself. I don’t know how my parents will react to their son suddenly transformed into a Squirrel-boy.”<br />
<br />
The Squirrel snorts, “at least you have a family and home,” he says, “what about me? I can’t fit into my hole like this and I will not survive,” tears start to roll down the former animal’s face.<br />
<br />
John can’t take it to see this Squirrel-boy suffer, so he reaches out a hand and wipes the tears away, “you can come with me,” he says, “I have a feeling that my parents won’t mind. At least you’ll not be alone anymore.”<br />
<br />
The Squirrel-boy flinches a little from the touch, not used to being touched in a human way, he then lets out a sigh, “okay, I’ll come with you,” he says, “but I’ll need a name!”<br />
<br />
“How about Jason?”<br />
<br />
The Squirrel-boy thinks about it, he then smiles, “I like it,” he says.<br />
<br />
John smiles, “I am so happy to see you finally smiling,” he says, “by the way… I think we don’t need to worry about being seen as freaks. I mean everyone passing us does not seem to pay any attention, they are all acting normal.”<br />
<br />
Jason looks around, “I guess you are right,” he then turns back to John, John’s face has pushed out into a cute muzzle, this causes Jason to snicker a little.<br />
<br />
John tilts his head, “what’s so funny?”<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Jason says, “it is just that you look so damn cute!”<br />
<br />
John blushes, “th-thanks… I guess,” he mumbles.<br />
<br />
Jason then tilts his head, “you sure you don’t want to take those clothes off,” he asks, “you don’t look to happy wearing them.”<br />
<br />
“I would, love to, but I’m so hesitant,” John says, “my tail is squished in my pants and it is starting to hurt, besides that, I feel so hot,” the pain causes the boy to not notice his cock shrinking and his balls popping back into his body, nor does he notice his tummy grumbling as a womb forms inside of him.<br />
<br />
Jason, on the other hand, notices something, something about the former human smells… different, in a way that makes him feel his cock twitch and start to poke out his sheath. He then suddenly realizes what he is smelling: heat pheromones! But… John is not a female, so why would he give off female pheromones? Jason needs to know, so he slowly moves forward towards John, “let… let me help you,” he says, reaching out towards John’s pants, “you really don’t need to be ashamed. You’ll feel better, once you are out of those silly things, I promise.”</p>
