<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer had given the curse some leeway with the addendum &#39;or something.&#39; <br />
<br />
Jennifer, naturally, knew only the bare minimum about anime, seeing it as a genre for freaks and losers... this naturally affected what kinda anime figurine Melody would become.<br />
<br />
But Melody WAS a total anime geek, and knew all the &#39;freaky&#39; cliches by heart. Melody had also held some fantasies of using the curse on herself or others, but had not desired to force it onto others like some twisted mad scientist. Jennifer obviously had no such problems. <br />
<br />
She became all the cliches for every selfish otaku rolled into one. <br />
<br />
She stood at attention, her legs locked together and arms at her sides, chin up and facing forward. Mold-lines appeared around her body like the outline of a cartoon character. Her clothes changed even as they fused and became part of her body. Her hair likewise became a solid piece that was just the shape of her head rather than something separate, or maybe it was detachable, Melody wasn&#39;t sure.<br />
<br />
Her eyes grew huge, her nose became a ski-slop shape, her mouth became tiny. Her skin became plastic and flawless (along with her &#39;clothes&#39; that were really just a part of her now). Her became an impossible bright blue while her hair turned neon pink. Her hair became drill spiral pigtails, with techno looking hair-clips holding them in place. <br />
<br />
Pink cat ears grew out of the top of her head, like a pink cat tail with a white tip snake out from her skirt. <br />
<br />
Melody began to loose height, not shrinking, but physically becoming shorter, but at the same time her chest expanded passed anything that was biologically logical. It was a wonder she didn&#39;t topple over, maybe it was the lost height. <br />
<br />
Her &#39;clothes&#39; shrank down, the colors being white, and black with blue &#39;glowie bits.&#39; The result looking like some swim suit made of techno gear, barely serving for modesty with a similar colored skirt made of transparent blue plastic. At the same time, a pair of technological wings grew from her back, looking like the wings of an angel with the &#39;fingers&#39; made of black and white plastic and the &#39;feathers&#39; of transparent blue. <br />
<br />
To finish off the cliches, in one hand appeared an over-designed katana &#39;laser&#39; with far too many tiny details to write down on the hilt (including gold patterns, jewels, symbols, etc). <br />
<br />
<br />
While this happened outwardly, Melody&#39;s inner self was struck from within like Thor&#39;s hammer. <br />
<br />
&#39;You are not human.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;You are not alive.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You are an object.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;You are property.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;You exist to be owned.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;You exist to be used by your owner as they see fit.&#39; <br />
<br />
These were slammed onto her soul like a hot branding iron, not becoming mere ideas, but fundamental truths seared into her very being! <br />
<br />
Melody&#39;s mind calmly accepted her complete annihilation of personhood, and turned to Jennifer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I can&#39;t objectively observe and note this transformation since I am certain my consciousness had been fundamentally altered. So what do you wish me of owner?&quot; <br />
<br />
Melody moved and spoke... but it was watching an animatronic, and her lips flapped without the rest of her face moving, like in an anime. <br />
<br />
Jennifer, really didn&#39;t care. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or dare me back to my real self!&quot; The spider woman hissed. <br />
<br />
&quot;As you command owner...&quot; Melody said, her voice now higher pitched and charged.  &quot;Transform or... or... or...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;COME ON! SAY IT!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... That is odd... It&#39;s like something is stopping me from giving the curse. I wonder... could this be because of the &#39;no revenge transformation&#39; that some people have insisted exists? It would explain why Kyle hadn&#39;t simply used this on his-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; <br />
<br />
Melody closed her mouth. <br />
<br />
Jennifer rubbed her temples. &quot;Come on come on, think. What did that freak do?&quot; Jennifer sat down, and did indeed so something she wasn&#39;t used to, and actually thought things through beyond her immediate gratification. <br />
<br />
&quot;That freak Kyle... he said something about undoing this... That has to be it! Bastard made it so I have to do whatever song and dance he wants me to do to fix this! Well I hope he likes visitors!... Do you know where he lives?&quot; <br />
<br />
The life size anime figurine nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can speak stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes owner, I do. I&#39;ve been there multiple times... though for the last few days he&#39;s only ever responded with texts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lead the way! Everyone will think you&#39;re just some nerdy loser trying too hard!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes owner,&quot; Melody nodded. <br />
<br />
Jennifer followed. Sadly... this quickly lead them straight into suburbia. <br />
<br />
&quot;It seems owner we&#39;ll be able to test my hypothesis that the presence those changed are &#39;muted&#39; by the curse to protect its existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get on with it!&quot; Jennifer snorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes owner,&quot; Melody nodded like a recycled frame of animation. <br />
<br />
People looked at Melody and Jennifer... and then quickly looked away, carrying on with their lives, pretending they hadn&#39;t seen anything. But more like they were seeing someone with a Mohawk with flashing lights thank actually terrified or alarmed. <br />
<br />
Melody spoke out loud, &quot;I wonder if my animation is a result of still carrying the curse, or because of your &#39;or something&#39; tangent, and the curse itself though me being an animate anime figurine would be more &#39;amusing.&#39; &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who the **** cares?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes owner.&quot; <br />
<br />
Finally, they arrived at Kyle&#39;s home. Just another house in a string of identical houses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get us inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we knock first owner?&quot; The figurine asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle isn&#39;t worth the respect!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I respect him,&quot; said the life size figurine in a completely friendly tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re both losers!&quot; <br />
<br />
Melody opened the door, finding it wasn&#39;t locked. &quot;There was no car outside, meaning Kyle&#39;s parents aren&#39;t home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just makes it easier for me, means the little freak can&#39;t call for help. Where&#39;s his room?&quot; <br />
<br />
Melody obediently showed the way... It was trouble squeezing through the hallway with her spider-taur body. The door to Keith&#39;s bedroom was locked. Without a hesitation, Jennifer kicked the door open, making the door knob on the other side smash into the wall. <br />
<br />
Inside, a figure gasped, and scurried up the bed and against the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer!&quot; It gasped out in a high pitched voice that Jennifer recognized. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle? That&#39;s you?&quot; Jennifer burst out laughing. &quot;THAT IS SO PERFECT! Definitely an improvement! Though ANYTHING about you would be an improvement!&quot; <br />
<br />
On the bed, terrified... was a bright orange and red humanoid vixen... with a figure even more exaggerated than Melody&#39;s... And she was made out of rubber with obvious mold lines. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle?&quot; Melody asked worried. &quot;Is that really you? Is that why you didn&#39;t call? ... Why? Why didn&#39;t you tell any of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;BECAUSE HE&#39;S STUPID THAT&#39;S WHY! He&#39;s too stupid to do anything other than let go of a harmless little bit of teasing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;HARMLESS? YOU TOOK A PICTURE AND POSTED IT TO EVERYONE!&quot; The vixen snarled standing up the spider woman. &quot;I was humiliated! After you lured me in saying you wanted to learn about my hobbies!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your own fault for thinking I&#39;d ever be into whatever garbage you&#39;re into.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But your parents protected you, as usual, from any consequences! All you ever do is used and break people like they&#39;re toys! Well congrats! Now you actually gotta face consequences for once!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle... how did this happen?&quot; Melody asked gently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot; Jennifer leaned in close. &quot;You WANTED this to happen... Kylie... you WANTED to be owned! Used! I bet what happened to you really turned you on, but you were too pathetic to admit it! But now here you are! You can go around naked showing your stuff, and no one is gonna complain! And you wanted to be owned by ME! Why else would you do all this garbage instead of say, &#39;daring me a better person&#39; or some junk. You like being this way!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle... Kylie? Shrank down (not literally) under Jennifer&#39;s words. Had he... had she... really wanted this? To be used? Owned? <br />
<br />
&quot;Now tell your owner little doll, what was the out you put in that&#39;s keeping me trapped like this?&quot; Jennifer said with false sweetness. <br />
<br />
&quot;You have to make friends,&quot; Kylie blurted out. <br />
<br />
Jennifer was silent for a few seconds. She looked at the giant doll incredulous, then bellowed, &quot;I HAVE FRIENDS! Dozens of friends!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kylie couldn&#39;t look her in the eye anymore. &quot;Real friends, not sycophants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? I DO have real friends you stupid love doll! See?&quot; Jennifer fished out her cell phone that she thankfully still had on her in spite of all the destruction her uniform had gone through... She showed it to Kylie.<br />
<br />
&quot;... That&#39;s a lot of unfriendeds,&quot; Kylie said in awe. <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Jennifer looked... and saw her followers, her best friends on the cheer squad... she was listed as &#39;unfriended&#39; one after another... &quot;No... No no no no no!&quot; Jennifer cried out from the ceiling! &quot;What did I do to deserve this!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you wish an objective list owner?&quot; Melody offered. &quot;The number of young men you&#39;ve strung along for your own amusement, the girls you&#39;ve made friends with, and discarded once they&#39;d served their purpose as social stepping stones, or your mistreatment of-&quot; <br />
<br />
Jennifer gave her a death glare. Melody closed her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t happening... this isn&#39;t happening... me and the squad are thick as thieves. We&#39;re real friends! Not like you geeks who are gonna break up from one argument over what color your eye-candy&#39;s hair color should be! This isn&#39;t real! They wouldn&#39;t do this to me!&quot; Jennifer&#39;s legs all gave out as she landed on the bed causing a small tremor. &quot;It must this curse!&quot; Jennifer glared at Kylie. &quot;YOOOOU! You&#39;re still doing this to me! Your curse is making all my friends leave me! STOP IT RIGHT NOW!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... That wasn&#39;t part of the curse... But it is part of swimming with sharks.&quot; Kylie said. <br />
<br />
&quot;SHUT UP! You don&#39;t know anything!&quot; She stood up. &quot;I just... I just need to go see them, snap them out of it, and I&#39;ll be done with this stupid curse!&quot;</p>
