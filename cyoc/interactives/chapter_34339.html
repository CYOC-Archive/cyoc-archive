<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eva woke up.  She was in a large and comfortable bed.  It wasn't her own bed, but neither <br />
was it the cot from her dream.<br />
<br />
She sat up suddendly and looked at herself.  She was wearing a nightgown, and...it wasn't <br />
a dream.<br />
<br />
She fell back on the bed, drained of energy.  &quot;What am I going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
The door to the room opened slightly and she heard a knock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just me, Michelle.  How does breakfast sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounded pretty good actually.  Sitting up, she replied.  &quot;I'd like that, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin entered the room with a tray loaded with food, as well as a glass of milk and <br />
another of orange juice.  He set it down on the bed for her.<br />
<br />
Unable to help herself, Eva found herself salivating, and she dug in without another word.  <br />
The blueberry pancakes were light as air and delicious, and the syrup was sweet, but not <br />
overly so.  The bread was toasted and buttered to perfection, with orange marmalade (her <br />
favorite), and there was an omelette as well.<br />
<br />
She blinked.  &quot;Is that a gyro omelette?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, your favorite, right?  I like them myself.  Oh and...&quot;  he gestured and produced a pair <br />
of items out of thin air.  &quot;Sauce and extra feta cheese, just how you like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
He set the items down.  &quot;Did I forget the hash browns, sorry about that..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no, this is fine, thank you.  You made this with magic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and a good thing, too.  My cooking is terrible.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite herself, Eva giggled.  It made her feel better.<br />
<br />
When she was done, the old man took the tray.  &quot;Feel free to take a bath, it's all ready for <br />
you.  I'll conjure you up some fresh clothing, and wait for you out in the living room.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled at him.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're most welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
The bath felt wonderful.  Her skin was more sensitive than ever before, and her hair...she <br />
was astonished at how long it was.  Well, to be accurate, it was the same length, it was <br />
just she had gotten smaller.  She'd have killed to have hair this long the first (and last) time <br />
she was this age.  Of course, she'd never get the braid back without Scylla's...<br />
<br />
She choked back a sob.  Scylla was gone, and even if she could get her away from <br />
Alecto...what kind of relationship could they have now?  That chapter of her life was over, <br />
stolen from her by a cursed ring and the libido of a 15 year-old boy.<br />
<br />
She had to laugh ruefully at how insane it all was.  But she had no choice.  This was real.<br />
<br />
She only had to rub her chest to prove that much.  Her breasts were gone, all she had left <br />
were a pair of pink nipples...very sensitive nipples.  She pinched them roughly and was <br />
rewarded by a lightning bolt running along her spine, and between her legs.<br />
<br />
Grinning like a naughty girl, she rubbed her crotch with her hand.  The skin was smooth <br />
and hairless, but she felt her body respond just like a woman's.<br />
<br />
It felt so good!<br />
<br />
She continued until her tiny body was wracked by pleasure.  She was so tight and <br />
sensitive!  As her orgasm subsided, she hugged her small frame until she noticed the <br />
water was cold.<br />
<br />
Her little pussy should have been rubbed raw, since this was, basically, her first time all <br />
over again.  Oddly though, that wasn't the case.  It seemed that she'd retained some of her <br />
adult traits.  Wiping the moisture off the mirror in the bathroom, she examined herself.<br />
<br />
There was no doubt about it, she was one sexy little girl.  While she lacked breasts, she <br />
had the beginnings of a figure.  Her waist was noticeably narrow, and her hips a little <br />
wider than they should be.  Her tummy was flat, and she had exceptional muscle tone, for <br />
the first time in her life.  She looked much more athletic, as if all of her attempts at <br />
physical fitness over the years had been retroactively applied to a ten-year-old girl.<br />
<br />
Which was exactly the case.<br />
<br />
Before she'd met Scylla, she'd never really looked at girls before, but now, she could <br />
appreciate her young body.  In fact, she felt herself becoming aroused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wonderful.  Now I'm a pedophile, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She sighed.  Still, it felt perfectly natural to be able to appreciate her youthened assets.  <br />
She only wished Scylla was here....but that was a dream.<br />
<br />
This was reality.<br />
<br />
Drying off her body and damp hair, she exited into the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Merlin (if that was his real name) had indeed set out clothing for her.  She smirked; it was <br />
a schoolgirl outfit.  &quot;That old pervert...well it's the least I can do to give him a show.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tartan skirt was a little short for her, but she had to admit, she looked very cute (and <br />
sexy, in an innocent sort of way).  The white blouse came with a blue tie, and she used a <br />
matching length of ribbon to tie her hair back into a long ponytail.  Black leather shoes and <br />
a pair of bobby socks completed the look (well unless you count the white cotton panties, <br />
that felt oh so good rubbing against her crotch).  She pushed the socks down a bit, <br />
knowing some guys were turned on by baggy socks.  Looking in the full-length mirror, <br />
she struck a pose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well how about that, I guess I'm turned on by baggy socks too.&quot;  She giggled, and again, <br />
felt better for having done so.<br />
<br />
Exiting into the living room, she was rewarded with a vacant stare from the old goat.  She <br />
laughed as he tore his eyes off her youthful form.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the matter, old man?  Don't tell me a little girl like me is making you <br />
uncomfortable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harumph.&quot;  <br />
<br />
She laughed some more, sitting down on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm glad to see you're so feeling better.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged.  &quot;It's hard to be gloomy at this size, I feel like the Energizer bunny.  I mean, <br />
yeah, I'm still sad my old life is over...I'll never be able to show myself to my friends or <br />
family like this...but...what will be, will be, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Michelle.  I can't fix this problem.  The Ring of De-Age is insidious when used <br />
improperly...and it always finds a way to ruin someone's life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it could have been worse.  I mean, what if he didn't stop?  I could have become a <br />
baby...or worse!&quot;  She shivered at the thought of it.<br />
<br />
Merlin nodded.  &quot;Quite so, I'm afraid.  While this isn't the best result I would have wished <br />
for you, there are worse fates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just don't know what to do now.  I can't stay here forever...but it's not like I can work or <br />
anything either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a moment there.  First of all, why couldn't you stay?  It's the least I can do to help you <br />
out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eva shook her head.  &quot;No, I couldn't impose.  You have your own life, and I can tell you're <br />
used to being by yourself.  A girl would really crimp your style, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Harumph.  Now see here, it's true I'm a crusty old man, but first of all, you're not some <br />
giggly little girl....&quot;<br />
<br />
Eva giggled, and was rewarded with a glare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;..usually.  You're very intelligent, and you have a talent for magic.  So actually, I was going <br />
to offer you a job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As what, a child porn star?&quot;  She grinned at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;While you do have the qualifications, I don't think that's what you'd like.  No no, a better <br />
job, as my apprentice.  I haven't had one in awhile, and you'll do just fine.  You help run <br />
the store, clean, keep track of my inventory, and I'll teach you some magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...and free room and board plus meals and expenses, I hope?&quot;<br />
<br />
Merlin rolled his eyes.  &quot;Yes...I know all about females and their...expenses.  I know it <br />
sounds like a good deal, but you'd be helping me out a lot.  I have problems with <br />
technology older made after 1979, and I'm betting you could use a computer to keep my <br />
books.  This is a business, and I do actually turn a profit once in awhile.  Plus, keeping <br />
track of what items are where...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Would help prevent what happened to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sighed.  &quot;Well, it wouldn't have helped you, sadly, but yes, it could prevent other <br />
problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood and offered her hand.  He shook it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, now for your first task...revenge.&quot;</p>
