<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle faded in and out of consciousness. He couldn&#39;t bring himself to get up. He was so tired and the concrete floor of the locker room just felt so cool on his skin. Why was he so overheated? Was he running a fever? It was as if a haze of warmth and darkness had enveloped him. <br />
<br />
Memories. Memories of the past twenty-four hours, of Jen and the bus ride and Josh and the videos and Austin and then the locker room with Nick and Jake and Corey, they flooded his mind and filled him with conflicting emotions. What was wrong with him? He knew that Jen&#39;s curse was changing him, but did he have to... like it so much?<br />
<br />
&quot;Have I always been this way?&quot; he wondered, lying there on the locker room floor. He seemed to remember eyeing Josh longingly before this had all happened, but now he wondered whether even these memories were nothing more than side effects of the transformation. If he didn&#39;t stop this transformation soon, he would surely lose himself. Hell, he wasn&#39;t even sure he knew who he was anymore. Part of him seemed to think that this was all perfectly normal, that he&#39;d always been the local whore, bending over for anyone who came along. But another part of him remembered being a normal guy, well, actually a pretty boring guy. Which was real? It was getting harder and harder for Kyle to tell.<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s wandering, half-conscious thoughts were interrupted by the sounds of the other guys returning from the field. He tried to pull himself up from the puddle of dried cum on the floor but found himself too shaky to manage even that. Instead, he collapsed back down onto the floor and tried to hold back tears as the crowd of his classmates flooded in, laughing and jeering at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, what a fag.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess he got in his exercise already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, Jake, you and Nick really fucked him up good.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle just stayed down, his eyes pressed shut. He hated hearing their words, but not because of the shame they should have been causing him. No, he hated the sense of pride he felt hearing them, hated how they made his dick start to harden beneath him once again.<br />
<br />
Finally as the last guys grabbed their backpacks and departed, the dismissal bell ringing, Kyle forced himself up to his knees. If he didn&#39;t move soon, he was going to miss the bus. With great effort, he staggered to his feet and hefted his backpack up onto his shoulders. It felt so heavy. Why was he so weak? Kyle&#39;s limbs were shaking and he felt feverish, ready to pass out again. &quot;I must be getting sick,&quot; he thought to himself. Just forcing himself to walk from the locker room and into the halls took all of his concentration.<br />
<br />
Kyle knew that he must be running late because the halls were almost totally clear of students. The buses would be leaving soon. He he needed to hurry, but couldn&#39;t make himself move any faster. He was just so, so tired...<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are my little dove!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle turned sluggishly to find Josh running over to him. Even in his exhausted state, Kyle couldn&#39;t help but admire how the  boy&#39;s golden hair shone in the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Kyle could only manage a weak smile as Josh put an arm around him and started shepherding him along toward the buses.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard about what Jake and Nick did to you back there,&quot; Jake said with a wry grin, &quot;You&#39;ve really been working hard today, haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle nodded and rested his head on the larger boy&#39;s shoulder. Damn, it felt to have Josh&#39;s body pressed up against his. Was that so wrong? That didn&#39;t make him gay, did it? Kyle&#39;s misgivings were soon brushed aside by the feeling of Josh running a hand over his back side. Kyle moaned happily as his boyfriend gave him a congratulatory pat on the ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a good thing I found you. You might have missed the bus. And we can&#39;t have that, now can we?&quot; Josh looked down at Kyle, a devious grin on his face.<br />
<br />
Something about this whole situation seemed off to Kyle but he couldn&#39;t quite place it. He was just so tired and it was so hard to think right now. Where was he? When had they gone outside? Oh yeah, they were going to the buses. Yes, there they were. Josh was leading him to their bus. Kyle vaguely remembered needing to find someone. Who was it? Josh? No, he was right next to Josh wasn&#39;t he? Then who was it...? Another guy to fuck? No...<br />
<br />
&quot;Jen...&quot; Kyle murmured weakly.<br />
<br />
Josh paused and asked Kyle to repeat what he&#39;d said. &quot;Jen?&quot; Josh asked, &quot;What about her?&quot; He seemed puzzled and in a hurry. Kyle became vaguely aware of the fact that the two of them were among the last ones not yet on a bus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Need to... need to find Jen,&quot; he croaked weakly,s struggling in vain to free himself from Josh&#39;s grip. At the exact moment Kyle said those words, he caught sight of Jen in the window of one of the other buses nearby. She was looking straight at him, snickering and talking to her girlfriends all around her. As he stood there dumbly, trying to think of a plan, he noticed her shoot him a wink.<br />
<br />
Josh gave a dismissive snort and yanked Kyle away in the direction of their bus. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about her, babe. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s just jealous of you, like most girls. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s get on the bus before they leave us here and we have to walk home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would Jen be jealous of me?&quot; Kyle wondered. He tried to make sense of Josh&#39;s comment but soon found it too hard to think and climb the steps into the bus at the same time. He was relieved when the two of them finally collapsed into a bus seat together. With a sigh of contentment, Kyle laid his head down on Josh&#39;s lap and passed out. <br />
<br />
As he rode home, Kyle became vaguely aware of a hand rubbing his cock through his jeans. It was Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm...&quot; Kyle moaned with pleasure. This was a very good dream he was having. He could even feel Josh&#39;s hardening member beneath his own head. Without opening his eyes, Kyle pawed at it half-consciously. To his relief, he felt Josh shifting, heard a zipping noise, and then the warmth of Josh&#39;s rigid cock against his lips.<br />
<br />
Still half-asleep, Kyle licked and kissed the length of the shaft, moaning softly the entire time. Distantly, he could hear other voices. &quot;Ew, gross.&quot; &quot;Get a room!&quot; &quot;Seriously?&quot; But they seemed miles away. He was alone with his favorite man, in bliss.<br />
<br />
His sweet dream was interrupted when he felt Josh tap him on the shoulder and pull his cock away. &quot;Wake up, love. This is where you get off, no pun intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
Groggily, Kyle struggled to his feet. When had his backpack gotten so heavy? Josh helped him up and pulled Kyle in for a deep, passionate kiss. Kyle whimpered with delight as he felt Josh&#39;s tongue probing the back of his mouth. It was difficult to pull himself away.<br />
<br />
He scarcely remembered the walk off the bus and up to his house. The next thing he knew, Kyle was flopping down onto his own bed, happy to finally get some sleep. Hopefully he would wake up in the morning to discover this had all just been a bad dream.</p>
