<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nicky turned off the water and stood there, dripping wet, in shock. He looked at the shampoo. What is it? Is what just happened real? He looked down at his body that now looked like a teenagers! He looked like he could be 16 now! He got out of the shower and quickly wrapped a towel around himself. He cracked the door to check if his mom was around and he didn&#39;t see her. He ran quickly to his room, shut the door, and locked it. <br />
<br />
<br />
He dropped his towel and stood in from of his mirror and gasped at his reflection. He could see how his frame had changed from that to a boy to a healthy looking, athletic teenager! His shoulders were broader he was around 5&#39;11 now! He could see a faint outline of abs on his stomach and his pecs had a small amount of definition to them. His biceps were noticeably bigger, too, with a few veins racing down his arm. He wasn&#39;t beefy or anything, but looked at least like he worked out a bit. <br />
<br />
<br />
He leans in close to the mirror, examining his face. His jaw is a bit more square and his face looks a little bit more like a man&#39;s than it did before. He can see he has peach fuzz slowly turning into real facial hair coming down his side burns, on his chin, and above his lip! &quot;Jeez! Does this mean I need to start shaving?!&quot;, He thought to himself. He touches the hairs on his chin and a few of them are quite thick and dark. &quot;Whoa&quot;, he says out loud, a bit startled by his voice! Whoa! His voice dropped! He sounded like a guy! He looked at his neck and saw a funny bump sticking straight out. &quot;Hello&quot;, he said experimentally in his deeper voice. He saw the bump rise up and down. Strange! His days of getting called a Mrs. on the telephone were certainly over!<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at his body in the mirror, the next thing that caught his eye was his crotch. Hairless before, he now had what could only be called a bush! He had a nest of wiry reddish brown hairs above his cock in an impressive V shape. His cock as well was much bigger. Average sized, it was about 4 inches long soft. It was much bigger than before and it excited Nicky!<br />
<br />
<br />
His eyes slowly traced up us torso. He saw his thick bush taper off into a small, but dark and thin line of hair to his belly button, extending and fading away an inch or two above it. He traced the happy trail of new hair on his torse. This was crazy! He also saw that he now had abs! They weren&#39;t the most defined or the most visible, but he had abs! Following his eyes up to his chest to his slightly developed pecs, he saw a smattering of hair in the center of his chest. Not many, maybe only 5 or 10, but they were thick and dark. An indication that he might grow more! Likewise, his nipples were circled with a few dark and curly hairs as well. He lightly tugged at the few hairs on his nipples. Damn they were kind of long!<br />
<br />
<br />
Following his gaze up his torso, he saw a dark mass under his arms. Lifting up his right arm in the mirror, he saw a very dark, hairy bush under his arms. Holy shit. He had armpit hair! Not just that, he had very bushy armpits now! He put his arms down at his side and two tufts of thick hair still stuck out from his pits. Jeez! <br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at his arms he saw some dark hairs growing on his forearm now as well, leading up about half way up his arms, which looked a bit more muscled and had some thick veins on them now! His biceps, as well, had some definition to to them. He struck a quick bicep pose and he grinned when he saw the hard muscle jump up. His pit hair was on full display as he posed, as well. This is crazy! He looks like a real teenager now! Muscles and body hair and all!<br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing his biceps and hairy bushes under his arm, he felt a strange stirring in his groin, a feeling he had never felt before. His newly enlarged cock slowly began to rise. Oh man he could feel his balls churning, but it was all such a new experience for him! What was going on?!<br />
<br />
<br />
As his new teenage cock slowly engorged with blood, he glanced at the bottle of blue shampoo! His mind raced with the possibilities of being stuck in a teenage body and of what else he could do with the shampoo...</p>
