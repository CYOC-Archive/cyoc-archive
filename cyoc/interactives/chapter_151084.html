<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob licked his lips as he reached for the Chronivac, so brimming with anxious energy that his trembling fingers could barely work the buttons of the fantastic device.  As a child, Jacob was overweight.  He did have success with losing the weight in his adolescence, but Jacob had noticed his paunch that was on his gut, appearing after starting his office job and adopting a relatively sedentary lifestyle.  With the return of his paunch, Jacob would find himself envying some of his heavier co-workers, ranging from chubby to tub of lard.  Jacob had fantasized becoming life them, becoming obese.  He was concerned about gaining for real as it would have harmed his health, but the Chronivac would help with that.<br />
<br />
Jacob wondered how much he wanted to weigh before heading into the office.  His ultimate weight gain fantasy was to weigh more than 700 pounds and become immobile, but he wouldn&#39;t be able to go to work that day.  He would cut loose and pig out on the weekend, but for the time being, Jacob would settle with weighing 300 pounds.  Jacob stepped on the scale in nothing but his underwear, and the numbers read &#39;189&#39;.  He was already overweight, but the thought of his paunch being large enough to obstruct his feet only made Jacob&#39;s cock throb.  <br />
<br />
Running into his room, Jacob entered his desired change, but at the last second, decided to change to 301 pounds.  A huge grin appeared on Jacob&#39;s face, thinking about that extra pound as if weighing 300 pounds was too small in comparison.  Jacob did not want reality to change as he wanted to see his co-workers react to his weight gain, but he did opt to alter his wardrobe aside from the underwear he had on.  He would go to work obese, and would only change back if he wanted to.  Jacob laughed aloud at the thought - after waiting this long, all he had to do to become as large as his co-workers was push a button. His laughter faded as he stared at the device. He took a deep breath and dried his palms on his pants.<br />
<br />
He pushed the button.<br />
<br />
A deep electric numb poured out of the Chronivac and washed over him, the man gasping in surprise before he remembered to turn towards the mirror he had set up to watch the changes - after a lifetime of waiting, he wasn&#39;t going to miss one second of this. He didn&#39;t have to wait much longer. It was but a few seconds after he pushed the button that the changes made themselves known, his paunch growing in length and width.  He also noticed the man boobs that were developing on his chest, the nipples and belly button that were getting bigger and wider as well.  His legs were also widening, with his underwear feeling very tight on him.  A second chin also began to develop.<br />
<br />
Before Jacob knew it, it was over, and he found himself standing on the scale.  His jaw dropped after seeing the number &#39;301&#39; on the scale.  &quot;301?  Holy shit!&quot; Jacob could only shout and laugh at his fantasy coming true.  He felt his torso and his bottoms in disbelief that he was touching and shaking his new fat.  He then darted for his room to get ready for work, feeling a guilty thrill over the quake in his ass and chest.  Tearing off the tight underwear, Jacob&#39;s excitement only grew as his new fat was obstructing both his feet and penis.  To top it all off, Jacob checked his work clothes only to find that they all had gone up several sizes.  His khakis are now at size 44, while his button-up shirt is at 3XL, as opposed to his respective previous sizes of 32 and L.  They even looked the same, aside from the size differences.  Jacob searched his wardrobe further, only to find shirts that were all 3XL, alongside khakis, jeans and shorts that were either size 43 or 44.  He put his larger clothes on, surprised at how well they fit his larger frame.  With his clothes on, and accustomed to his obese frame, Jacob headed off to work.<br />
<br />
Jacob was still able to drive to work, but he found his seat to be adjusted further back than normal.  All he could think about during the drive as watching himself fatten up in the mirror, and how it made him hard.  He later entered the office, where plenty of the other employees could only look at him, walking to his desk with his new fat.  Jacob then arrived at his desk, ready to start his first shift after becoming obese.</p>
