<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle looked inside the bag. Oh thank you Hannah! He had never before been so happy to see cheesy matching outfits. There were 2 sets of black shorts, one slightly larger than the other, along with two jumpers with &quot;world&#39;s best boyfriend/ girlfriend &quot; on either. Kyle quickly put on his pair of shorts. He felt a tingle and looked down- he actually seemed to have become slightly taller and more muscled! Ha! Take that, phone freak!<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s came down the stairs. &quot;Martha, isn&#39;t it your day off?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Normally, but your mother called me in especially today, apparently she&#39;s worried you had a break in last night.&quot; Kyle chuckled to himself, knowing he could use this to blackmail Jennifer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh by the way, is this it?&quot; She held up Kyle&#39;s missing sock, which she had somehow found. Today wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all. <br />
<br />
But Jennifer wasn&#39;t done yet...<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
School passed along nicely for Kyle, he almost forgot about the curse, and his new legs and butt seemed to be gaining a lot of attention from the ladies. This had turned out great, and now it was time for the last lesson of the day, as Kyle walked along to his classroom.<br />
<br />
Kyle was opening his locker, when suddenly two hands grabbed him from behind, and turned him around. It didn&#39;t take a genius to guess who it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you&#39;re so fucking clever, don&#39;t you Kyle.&quot; &quot;Jennifer pinned Kyle against his locker. &quot;Getting a brand new se of pants to come in. Well I&#39;m not having it! I worked too hard for this!&quot; Before Kyle could respond, Jennifer straight up kissed him on the lips, pushing something into his mouth with her tongue. Her B cup breasts rubbed against his body. Kyle normally would have been able to shove someone like her off, but this kiss felt good. TOO GOOD... His mouth felt funny, all puffed up and tingly. Kyle could barely concentrate as Jennifer began using her tongue against the top of his mouth. This didn&#39;t just feel good, this felt orgasmic- then Kyle felt a vibration at the back of his throat, and realised what was going on.<br />
<br />
Jennifer relinquished her mouth, but kept him pinned to the lockers. &quot;Becky! Mirror quick!&quot; One of Jennifer&#39;s few friends appeared holding a hand mirror. Kyle could see everything. His began to thin, scrunching and folding inward, going from lips to labia. His upper lip began to move upward as it folded in. His nose shrank down and joined to his fresh vaginal lips, becoming more deep set. His jaw seemed to be stuck shut, and his teeth recessed into his gums, which also started to join at the sides, shrinking and softening, becoming a new vaginal opening just behind the labia. His tongue was the strangest part. It actually lengthened and became thinner, so long in fact it could breach the vaginal lips. Kyle watched all this in horror as over the course of a minute his mouth became a fully functional set of women&#39;s sexual organs. <br />
<br />
But he couldn&#39;t stay horrified for long- the vibrations in his mouth continued, and only continued to build. His lips began to quiver and spasm, and what could have been either saliva or pussy juice started to run down his face. <br />
&quot;What... Schluuhrrrppp...have you...schluuurrrpp...ohhhh...done...ohhhhsscchhhlluuuuurrrrppppp...&quot; Kyle tried to speak, but between his new lips, the vibrator and the massive amounts of fluid leaking from his slit it was almost impossible.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s obvious isn&#39;t it? You alaays were a cunt, now it&#39;s about time you were treated like one. Here, let me give you a demonstration.&quot; And with that, she leaned in for the French kiss again. Her tongue expertly caressed his new clit, sending even more pleasure through Kyle&#39;s body. Every stroke of her tongue was like a jolt of electricity in his face. He could feel it coming as the vibrator kept going, oh so good... Jennifer must have known too, because with a click of a button it became faster and harder. He felt himself climb up the hill, higher and higher, before his new sex began to convulse, wave after wave of pleasure ripped through his body as he moaned in a feminine but strangely natural way. Just as he thought it was over, the orgasm from his clit, expertly timed by Jennifer, brought him back to a new peak as he joined her in a passionate embrace.<br />
<br />
Jennifer released Kyle&#39;s mouth slit, and spoke in a much more sultry voice: &quot;well, I bet you enjoyed that, didn&#39;t you little slut. I hope you&#39;re grateful, you have no Idea how hard it was to get Chloe Aster&#39;s vibrator, and when she was on her period too...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Chlo...ohhh...ohh...ohhhhhhhhh...&quot; Kyle realised the vibrator was still on, and his vag was only getting more moist again. Chloe Aster was the cutest and most popular girl in school, and the rumours about her sex life were wild. And this was HER vagina? <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, that Chloe Aster. Here, does this help?&quot; The vibrations in the back of Kyle&#39;s throat stop, and he can finally use his tongue to try and push it out. A pink, bullet shaped vibrator plops out into his hands. &quot;Oh my&quot; Jennifer says &quot;It seems your shirt is covered in your new juices, you dirty bitch. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got a spare right here. She stood up properly, releasing him, and handed Kyle a black Silk top with lace around the shoulders. Begrudgingly, Kyle simply took off his shirt and placed the new top over his head. His torso began to shiver, his shoulders and ribs cracked together, and he was left with a much smaller, sleeker upper body, which as far as he could tell matched Becky&#39;s upper body; he could tell from a matching black spot on her lower neck, which was also now present on him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll also need a few of these&quot; Jennifer pulled a few tampons out of her bag. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t change again if you put one in, these aren&#39;t clothes. &quot;Blut der vliblator isshhh?&quot; Kyle said, still getting the hang of his newly rearranged muscles. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come to my place later, and we&#39;ll have a talk about all this, and maybe I&#39;ll show you just how good a pussy or two can be. In the meantime, here&#39;s the remote, have fun...&quot; She giggled. Kyle stared at her blankly for a few seconds. &quot;Don&#39;t worry honey, you&#39;re one of us now, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll realise how wrong you&#39;ve been your entire life about us... And don&#39;t worry, I made sure you were marked here or the last lesson. You know where the bathroom is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps today wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all.</p>
