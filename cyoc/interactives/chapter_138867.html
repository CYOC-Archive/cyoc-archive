<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason let himself in the house and dropped his soccer cleats and backpack on the floor. Making his way to the kitchen, he thought he heard a door slam upstairs and figured his sister was home. Thinking, &quot;Great. Brian&#39;s not home and my sister is,&quot; he opened the fridge and snooped about for a snack. Not finding anything, the twelve-year-old boy decided to wait until dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which I&#39;ll have to find,&quot; he groused as he knew April wouldn&#39;t cook anything and would likely disappear somewhere with her friends. Slapping shut the fridge, he wondered what he should do and after a moment, he headed upstairs. Hearing the shower starting, Jason considered it a good thing his sister would ignore him and tiptoeing to her room, he peered in as he decided that what he would do, at least until dinner, was dress-up in girl&#39;s clothes.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d discovered his secret, guilty, shaming secret about a year ago. At first, his first impression was that there was something wrong with him. But, after a bit, he was able to partially convince himself it was okay, so long as nobody found out. And then, about the time he turned twelve, Jason came to the understanding that the reason he dressed and pretended to be a girl was that he wanted to be one, felt he should have been one and that wearing, at first, April&#39;s clothes, and later the clothes he nicked from the rummage, yard and garage sales, the stuff he got for free from the places that gave out clothes for free, as well as the things he occasionally bought, mostly underwear, wearing the stuff made him feel like a girl. Staring into April&#39;s room, listening to the shower, feeling ashamed at what he did, what he wanted and the way it made him feel, Jason eventually looked at the clothes his sister had left on the floor.<br />
<br />
As she normally left her clothes on the floor, Jason thought that maybe she&#39;d meant to drape the stuff over the chair. Stepping over the threshold, he tiptoed softly across the room and picked up the panties. Holding them up, he studied the tiny blue flowers printed on the white fabric and after a moment realised there was something in the middle of the panties. Considering it was one of the hygiene products April used, Jason twisted the underwear and sniffed at the crotch, curious to know what it was. Not smelling anything, he grunted when the underwear got to close to his face and he accidentally smeared whatever it was on the tip of his nose. Finding it to be warm and sticky, he reached up and rubbing his nose, he peered at the panties, trying to figure out what April had spread into the middle of her underwear and why she&#39;d done so. Bringing the cotton panties closer, he studied the goop, which was almost clear, but had a very slight yellowish tinge to it, and after a moment, headed out of his sister&#39;s room and toward his, taking the underwear with him.<br />
<br />
Inside his room, he shut and locked his bedroom door and  dropping the panties on his bed, the twelve-year-old boy took off his clothes and tossed them over the back of the chair in front of his desk. Heading for a closet, he pulled out a wooden chest with a padlock, undid the lock and opened the lid. Fishing through the piles of various clothes and whatnot, he eventually selected a tight pair of button-fly jeans shorts that had been designed with a ripped look, a string-bikini top and a pair of breast forms that, when tucked into the bikini, made it look like he had a double A cup. Turning away from the wood chest, he headed for this bed. Trying to convince himself that he really shouldn&#39;t be wearing April&#39;s underwear, that he should wear a pair of the panties he owned, Jason dropped the clothes on his comforter and reached for underwear. Examining the goop a bit more, which he noted was still moist and sticky, Jason tried to figure out what the point of putting such stuff in the middle of the panties was. Drawing a blank, he tucked his penis and testicles between his legs and, after a moment of hesitation, including trying to talk himself out of what he was about to do, Jason pulled on April&#39;s underwear.<br />
<br />
Warm, sticky and giving him a feeling of arousal, Jason shivered as he felt himself growing hard. Quickly pulling on the shorts before his penis could grow too hard, he lay down on the bed and started to button the shorts, but stopped. Sticking his hand inside the panties and rubbing his penis, feeling it fully becoming hard, he stuck his fingers into the goop and withdrew his hand. Sniffing, but still not smelling anything, Jason shrugged and reached for the breast forms, set them gently in the cups of the bikini and began pulling on the top, realising as he did so, that the goop had gotten on the back of breast forms, leaving them warm and sticking them to his chest.<br />
<br />
Not seeing any issue, he buttoned the shorts, which caused them to pull tight and really give him the look of not having anything down there. Lying back, he crossed his hand beneath his head and stared up at the ceiling. Finding the clothing felt comfortable and that the stuff in the panties, while warm and sticky, seemed to really turn him on. Shifting in an effort to get comfortable, Jason wondered what a girl did when she was turned on. Reaching down, he began to rubbed the shorts, first in front, then between his legs. Liking it, especially the way it almost felt like he didn&#39;t have anything down there, he moaned and, with his other hand, began to first rub the outside of the bikini top, but, after a moment, slipped his hand into the cup and began to place with the fake breast. Feeling more and more aroused,  he was willing to swear he was doing something right.For the more he rubbed both the breast form and the area between his legs, the more he believed that he could actually feel his hand against the breast form like it was an actual boob and that the area between his legs didn&#39;t have a penis and testicles tucked between.<br />
<br />
A series of moans escaping him, Jason gasped as he felt himself cum and for a moment, lay in his bed, feeling shame in what he did, yet also feeling like it was the most natural thing. Thinking the warmth and sticky stuff was more prominent, he rolled over on his side and curled up, drawing his knees up until the were pressed again the bikini top. Liking the way they felt brushing against the fabric and the way it actually felt like he had breasts gently cupped in the cups, he whispered, &quot;It would be nice if it were true,&quot; extending his legs, rolling back over and sitting up.<br />
<br />
The shorts pressing into the area between his legs, Jason considered how nice it would be if he truly did have girl privates instead of his usual penis and testicles as he noted that, while still feeling sticky, the goop had started to grow cold. Figuring he should return the panties back to where he found them, he listened for a moment to hear if the shower was still running. Hearing it, he decided he had enough time and reaching down, he started to unbutton the shorts, but stopped after undoing the top one of the three buttons and instead reach behind his neck and pulled gently at the thin strap. Taking off the bikini, he marvelled at how the breast forms managed to stay in place without the top, but figured it had something to do with the goop he&#39;d accidentally got on them. Heading for his closet, he tossed the string-bikini top into his laundry and, after thinking about for a moment, took from the wooden chest a strapless dress that was white, had a tight, form-fitting top and a flowing skirt that was tiered and came down to his knees. Slipping the dress over his head, Jason paused when he shivered and looked down, willing once again swear he could feel the soft fabric of the cotton dress brushing against the breast forms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just my imagination,&quot; he chuckled and adjusting the dress. he reached under his right arm and pulled up on the hidden zipper, which cinched the dress tight around his chest, forced the breast forms to take on a perked-up appearance and, in addition to making him appear a cup size bigger, also made it look like he had cleavage.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with what he was seeing, Jason reached up under the hemline of the dress and undid the other two buttons. Removing both the shorts and underwear, he tossed the shorts into the laundry basket and tiptoeing across his room, feeling like what he was about to do was risky and stupid, he unlocked the door to his bedroom and peeked out. Not hearing the shower, he wondered if April was still in the bathroom. Seeing that the door to that particular room was still closed, he took a deep breath and before he could change his mind, streaked down the hall and into his sister&#39;s room. Dropping the panties on the floor as close to the spot as he found them, Jason turned and ran back the way he came, making sure he was moving as silently as he could.<br />
<br />
Back in his room, breathing heavily, he flopped on the bed and with his legs spread and the skirt portion of the dress riding up a little, and also pressing into the area between his legs, Jason stared up at the ceiling. Liking how soft the fabric felt against his crotch, Jason tried to get control of his breathing before he idly reaching down. Lost completely in thought, he cupped his hand over his groin and grasping a hunk of the dress and pressing it into the area between his legs, he absently muttered, &quot;Man. How I wish what I was pressing this fabric into were the normal private parts of a girl,&quot; as he failed to realise that he hadn&#39;t been able to feel his penis and testicles since sometime after putting on the his shorts.</p>
