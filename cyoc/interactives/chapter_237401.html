<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A loud groan came from a two-story house. Gwen scratched at another spot. She&#39;d been doing this for the last few minutes. Every time she got rid of the itch it would start on a different part of her body. Unbeknownst to her however while she was scathing she was causing dead skin to come off scales hidden underneath.  <br />
<br />
Slamming her hand down on the mattress she got up. &quot;This isn&#39;t working.&quot; She looked down at her nails. They had lengthened chipping her nail polish off. An idea struck her as her tailbone started to lengthen. &#39;maybe a shower will fix this&#39; she thought. She ran out of her bathroom. She paused when she heard a howl come from the front yard. However, the itch was more of a problem.  <br />
<br />
She stumbled a bit as she entered the bathroom. Looking down she saw nothing wrong with her black four-toed paw apart from the remains of someone&#39;s socks covering them. Once inside she pulled off her shirt revealing little skin that hadn&#39;t become dead or scratched off for her scales. She discarded her bra and panties with little thought before stepping into the shower.  <br />
<br />
Turning on the water she felt relief as the itch was quenched. It would still appear at random spots but the water washed it away. Her growing tail closed the door as black spines covered his top part. Gwen let out a painful moan as her genitals rearranged. Her vagina moved up and became a paper-thin slit. Her ovaries then transformed into testicles as they descended into a scaly sack. With new testosterone flooding his system Gwen felt his cock emerge. It had a grey scute underside and black scaled top. Its head was like an arrow and a knot formed sealing it outside the slit for now.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Gwen asked. He knew whenever his cock was out there was only one way to take care of it. Gripping his foot-long dick he began to masturbate. Due to that and his new testosterone, his changes accelerated rapidly. His height grew as his muscles inflated. His hourglass figure soon became a slight v. he let out a growl as he splattered cum across the shower walls. He watched as his cock retreated into its slit. &quot;well that&#39;s one problem down&quot; his voice was much deeper and more handsome now.  <br />
<br />
At that moment a new problem hit him. His breasts and ass were burning. Quickly Gwen switched the water from hot to cold hoping that it would help. Thankfully after a minute, he felt the heat go away, mostly. He felt his large nipple-less pecs and was relieved to feel his fire gland still as warm as ever. Checking his ass he saw nothing but rock-hard muscle on either side of his three-and-a-half-foot tail. A bit of human skin still hung to his back. That wouldn&#39;t last as he shut his eyes in pain. His claws dug deep gouges into the wall. The moment finally stopped as two new appendages bushed against the opposite walls. They were pure grey with white spikes at their tips. The finger-like points soon grew downwards. The second outer one was the longest while the thumb was barely over a foot long. A blue membrane covered the space between them and his back.  <br />
<br />
He then let out a frustrated groan as his horns pierced his still human flesh. The ten-inch horns jutted almost straight back as he sighed in relief. The itching was nearly gone. He closed his eyes as his head was the last place he felt it. Dark grey scales were revealed when the water washed away hair and skin. The remaining hair became mohawk-like and mainly ran down his neck. As the last traces of his former life washed away his muzzle grew. Sharp fangs surrounded his forked tongue.  <br />
<br />
Gwyn turned off the water. He then grabbed a towel and dried off. As he did so the gouges he left on the wall healed. Outside the shower, his discarded clothes faded from existence leaving a pair of deep blue shorts and black boxers in their place. With the towel draped over his shoulder, he went to the mirror to ensure his main looked good. His blue and purple slit eyes looked at his reflection. His main was black with bright blue highlights. Blue highlights were visible on his scales at his hairline and under his eyes. His lower muzzle was light grey, the color ran down his front until it stopped at his inner thighs. Black scales covered his shoulders in a jagged pattern, a bright blue v pointed towards his armpits. A larger black diamond was on his thighs with a bright blue sideways arrow pointing right to his grey balls and tail. A bright blue streak went from his tail&#39;s base to over a foot down before ending in a point, his tail&#39;s tip also did the same. Finally, a bright blue v was just below his raised ankle and pointed between his inner toes.  <br />
<br />
The 6&#39;6 dragon was briefly shocked at his reflection, almost like he expected something else. He shook this off as he fixed his main. He then put his underwear and shorts on. he still wished there was a shirt that he could wear but his wings would always get in the way. After he entered his room he was relieved to see those girls hadn&#39;t messed with it. It was thankfully still an organized mess.  <br />
<br />
His comic books and video games were some of the only things not on the floor as they were some of his prized treasures. He gleamed with pride as he glanced at his awards and achievements. His certification from the mythical creatures society hung next to his family photo. It showed him as a hatchling with his human mom and dad. Giving birth to myths was a rare feat. They made up less than one percent of the population. Still, he had made his mark. &#39;dragon boy saves little girl&#39; the picture in the clipping showed him at seven saving a toddler from running into traffic, the image taken from an intersection camera. &#39;teen finds amber nugget&#39; showed him at fourteen holding a baseball size rock. The final one was his most recent achievement, &#39;Gwen Smith receives full college scholarship from MCS&#39;. Using his fortune he bought this house and invited his friends to live in while they attended college.  <br />
<br />
One might think that being a myth meant you had a lot of friends and were popular but that wasn&#39;t the case. Joy was her oldest friend. In fact that toddler was her younger sister. They had been playing with a hoop outside when she ran past them. Luckily Gwyn was flying so he spotted her. That day her family thanked them by a large dinner. He became friends with Wendy and Bella during high school. He stopped a mean girl from bullying them and calling them ugly. The mean girl didn&#39;t dare talk back to him. Of course, his tough guy act worked and he introduced them to Joy. With his ear holes he heard a clatter coming from the kitchen. &quot;what was that?&quot; he yelled from the open door. Getting no response he walked down the stairs and stood in the kitchen&#39;s doorway. Seeing the clothes he said &quot;Joy?&quot;.</p>
