<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>to &quot;The Werewolf Prince&quot;: Eric is still a normal human. He wouldn&#39;t have the sense of smell to identify new weres...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The morning came too fast for Harry. Jenny's nightmare had woken both him and Karen up, and while he did get back to sleep, his sleep was far less restful as he now had his worries for his bonded mate. Some of it was probably based on the fact that her transformation had been incomplete for so long. Mrs. Twist and the Mayor had said to him that there was the potential for her to have some mental issues regarding Yvette's attack on her. That combined with the stresses related to her family would only make things worse. A part of him just wanted to hold Jenny to him and assure her that everything would be okay. However, that couldn't be done as they both had morning classes.<br />
<br />
"You'd best both change back," Karen said from her bed as she moved to get herself dressed, "You'll have a lot to get out without getting in trouble for being in our dorm AFTER the time male visitors are allowed to be in the dorm... You'll both get in trouble if you're still in your fox forms."<br />
<br />
Harry nodded and turned to Jenny. She looked a bit concerned, but she did nod as well. Both werefoxes then took a deep breath and changed back, feeling their tails shrink back into their spines and as the pads under their fingers and toes lost the strength and durability that allowed weres to walk barefoot when transformed. Their ears rounded and shifted to the sides of their heads. Karen also quietly watched as their claws retracted and flattened into human fingernails, and as their fur retreated inside their bodies. It soon left both of them naked in front of her and in their human forms.<br />
<br />
While she found Harry quite handsome, being an art student, Karen wasn't immediately aroused by were or human nudity. A few of her art classes had involved drawing sketches based on an actual model being there and being nude. And at present, she also felt Peter to be far more attractive, though, she also figured that that was based off her present interest in the werelion and personal hope to be his lioness.<br />
<br />
Jenny moved to he drawer in the closet where she had placed the clothing she had gotten from Awareness. Most of her old clothing was donated to charity as they wouldn't fit her new werefox body, human or fox form, and only the largest pieces of clothing she kept. Harry was left to pick up the clothing he'd worn the day before. Thankfully they didn't smell too bad and the three of them rushed to get dressed and changed. With that, they turned to each other.<br />
<br />
"So... when is your morning class?" Karen asked.<br />
<br />
"At eight," Jenny said weakly, "with Mr. Anderson..."<br />
<br />
They looked to a nearby clock which read seven ten AM. They had time but they'd need to hurry.<br />
<br />
"Okay... let me look, and I'll see if the hallway is clear," Karen offered.<br />
<br />
Jenny and Harry watched as Karen went forward and opened it. Karen looked out and found the hallways presently empty. No one was getting ready to go out for breakfast or to go to the bathroom/shower area. With that, she waved her hand for Jenny and Harry to come to her. She lead them out with Harry shutting the dorm room door behind them as they dashed out. They made it to the entry area where the elevators were. As she got there, Karen was soon hastily pressing the down button. By a stroke of luck no one came out when the elevator arrived on the floor and gave a "ding" to indicate that it had arrived. As the doors opened, the three dashed in and breathed a heavy sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
"That was lucky," Harry said to Karen.<br />
<br />
"Yeah," Karen nodded, "Good thing these dormitories alternate floors... one floor is a boy's floor and the next is a girl's floor."<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, though her nightmare still weighed on her heavily. Though, Harry did keep one arm around her as they made their way out and on their way to breakfast. He got the sense that she was uneasy over her nightmare and wanted to do all that he could keep things easy for her and get Moon Lake ready for the Harper Family's visit. To do that, he dug into his pocket and pulled out his own cellphone. Privately thankful that Yvette's actions had only stolen Jenny's phone. He flipped it open and dialed a number that Akane had given him and Jenny the day of the trial. He waited quietly while the phone rang. Eventually a tired voice answered.<br />
<br />
"Konichiwa," came Akane's response over the phone.<br />
<br />
"Good morning, Mrs. Tachibana," Harry spoke, "I'm sorry if I've woken you up... this Harry Jenkins... Jennifer Harper's mate."<br />
<br />
"Ah," Akane responded, "and do not worry. You have not woken me up. Many of my days begin early, I trust all is well with you and your mate?"<br />
<br />
"About as well as can be," Harry spoke, "though... as we've been putting together our wedding plans... there are some things that you'll need to be aware of."<br />
<br />
"Oh?" Akane wondered. She didn't reveal that she already knew of the Harper family coming with a Dieter Wilhelm, but she did figure that Harry was warning her of this.<br />
<br />
She had warned Samantha Twist on the supposed threat, with the explanation the Skulk member who worked in Seattle for part of the year at a rent-a-car company had gotten updates on plane tickets and a car rental for the Harpers and a Dieter Wilhelm. It also involved some discussion on what her security personnel had thought concerning the Harpers, based on what Jenny had told them directly or had been heard off hand. However, at the moment she didn't want to reveal anything directly, as for the moment, she didn't want unnerve Jenny needlessly, and Akane assumed that Jenny and Harry would be together.<br />
<br />
"We have informed her parents for the "unofficial" invite to the wedding," Harry answered, "as they are her family... however... difficult they may be."<br />
<br />
"Of course," Akane answered.<br />
<br />
"While they made no direct statement on whether or not they would come to Moon Lake," Harry spoke, "they didn't respond well on the phone to that I was the man that Jenny is engaged to... and had seemed to have an interest in her marrying the son of a local power company executive in Alabama... probably thinking that through the marriage, the family she's marrying into would put them all on "easy street" as it were."<br />
<br />
"I see," Akane responded simply, "and would they try to hurt you or Jenny?"<br />
<br />
"I don't know," Harry answered, "and on some level... I wouldn't put it past them to want to."<br />
<br />
He paused to look to Jenny as Karen opened the door to the Student Union so they could go in and get a quick breakfast before going to class. He squeezed Jenny's hand for a moment and then continued.<br />
<br />
"Jenny and I though have the hope to show and demonstrate that we do love each other and will be happy together," Harry continued, "but we felt it best to let you know... since you've done so much for us."<br />
<br />
"That is quite understandable," Akane answered, "Hopefully when the time comes you can persuade them. Though... if not..."<br />
<br />
"If not... we'll come to that when it comes," Harry answered, "Neither of us really have a plan for that..."<br />
<br />
"I do not wish to put any strain on you... but based on what has already been told to us... wouldn't you think that it might be best to prepare for the worst?"<br />
<br />
"Maybe," Harry answered, "but they are her family... what would you have us do? Kill them?"<br />
<br />
"Of course not!" Akane answered quickly, "Honestly... many of those old laws Moon Lake has that demands transform or death could stand to be amended... especially since so many that come in on a temporary basis only need to sign waivers..."<br />
<br />
Harry looked to Jenny again, and he could tell by her frown that she was listening in. The conversation was likely only reminding her of her nightmare. That only made him sigh again as Akane continued.<br />
<br />
"But... it may be better to expect that they will not support you as Jenny's choice in a mate," Akane continued, "and since people in this era do not believe in arranged marriages... and Jenny is over eighteen, is she not?"<br />
<br />
"I am!" Jenny spoke loudly enough to be heard through the phone.<br />
<br />
"Then perhaps have your wedding earlier in the day," Akane spoke, "by the time they arrive, you will be legally wed and they can do nothing legally to prevent your love from being beautiful."<br />
<br />
"It'll be beautiful regardless," Harry said firmly, "but they'd likely respond even more negatively to that. It could cost her whatever good relations she has with her family."<br />
<br />
"My oldest brother and my sister," Jenny spoke from beside Harry.<br />
<br />
"I see," Akane sighed, "that will make things rougher if they do not respond well.... and if they make no intention of being respectful to you."<br />
<br />
Jenny took the phone at this point and spoke directly to Akane.<br />
<br />
"They are my family," Jenny spoke, "They may not have been easy to live with... and Moon Lake is my escape from a lot of their drama... but that doesn't mean I hate them and want to lose contact with them... particularly with my siblings."<br />
<br />
"Konichiwa, Harper Jenny," Akane spoke directly, "and I understand your wish... but if your parents have control over them and they decide not support your decision... they could do things that may hurt you, which no one in Moon Lake will want."<br />
<br />
"If... If it comes to that... then... then I'll have to say goodbye to them," Jenny answered, "Because I'm not leaving Moon Lake or Harry. But I would like the chance to persuade them to accept that Harry is wonderful... I... I know it will be hard and will probably put me through plenty of stress... but I have to try."<br />
<br />
"Jenny... are you sure..." Harry began.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded to him, as they went into the main cafeteria area. They got a quick breakfast, which amounted only to some donuts and orange juice, but it would give them at least something to put in the bellies before class.  Akane did responded with a sigh.<br />
<br />
"Very well," Akane spoke, "We will do what we can to help you."<br />
<br />
"Thank you," Jenny said back.<br />
<br />
With that Jenny hung up the phone and handed the phone back to Harry. The phone's screen now read seven thirty and they were getting close to being ready for breakfast and would have time to get to class. She found that both Karen and Harry had concerned faces.<br />
<br />
"You're sure about this?" Harry asked, "this will surely stress you out. It could give you more nightmares."<br />
<br />
"Neither of us want you to wake up screaming like you did this morning," Karen added.<br />
<br />
"I'm sure," Jenny gave a weak smile, feeling better to have Harry's love and Karen's friendship around her, "but it's something that we'll have to get through... something that I'll have to get through. Running from the problems my parents may pose won't solve them. If things don't work out... standing up to them will be something that will HAVE to be done."<br />
<br />
"I'll be with you when it comes," Harry promised, "I love you, Jenny. Always know that."<br />
<br />
That did make her smile as they sat down for breakfast. Jenny knew she would have plenty to worry over, but she'd have to get through it one way or another.</p>
