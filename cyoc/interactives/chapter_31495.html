<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>"Sorry for asking bud, but why are you wearing a hat indoors?"</br>
<br>Realizing he was watched while messing with his butt, the hairy bartender stood up, facing Jesse and Josh, then leans over the counter. He looks at Josh and Jesse, wondering if they were really ready to know. Since they were on Pleasure Island it was only fair that they found out sooner or later. The bartender smiles, showing off his pearly white teeth and his k-9s which were a bit sharper than normal for a human. His voice is deep and gruff, manly in every sense of the word.</br>
<br>"Don't you boys think you should ask someone's name before asking personal questions?"</br>
<br>Josh and Jesse look at each other, shrug slightly and place their attention back on the bartender.</br>
<br>"Sorry about that bud, you are right, we should have asked your name first! My name is Josh, this here is my impolite buddy Jesse and you would be?"</br>
<br>The bartender grinned, satisfied with winning that battle, while keeping him from having to teach the two boys a lesson in manners. "The name is Jim. Don't call me James, reminds me of when I would get in trouble with my momma and she would call me that."</br>
<br>"Alright, so Jim... why are you wearing a hat indoors? I mean we are safe from the outside elements..."</br>
<br>"To be honest, I just plain forgot to take it off. I suppose I could take the hat off, but what do you think is under there Josh?"</br>
<br>"Um... I dunno, your head probably."</br>
<br>Jim chuckled a bit from Josh's witty remark. "Touche young man, but you can clearly see that my hat isn't quite set firmly on my head. Obviously there is something different about me."</br>
<br>"Very true, you were just playing with your butt and almost getting off on it, especially being in public."</br>
<br>"Well, I must say you are one heck of an observant young man! So are there any guesses then?"</br>
<br>"Well if we are making a game of it, I would have to say your ears are that of an animal. I don't see your ears being on the side of your head like normal people, so by default, they have to be on top and that would suggest that they are animal ears."</br>
<br>Both of Jim's eyebrows raised in surprised at how observant Josh really was. "You surprise me kid, you definitely should be given more credit than what I gave you. You are right, I do have the ears of an animal."</br>
<br>Jim placed his hand on the top of his hat, taking a firm grip, removing it to show off his bear ears. Josh and Jesse stared somewhat at them, shocked that they were round and covered in a dark reddish brown fur, just like a bear! Jaws slacked in awe, a bit of drool ran out of Josh's mouth and as he felt it slip, he composed himself right away.</br>
<br>"How did you get these ears Jim?"</br>
<br>Jim smiled, knowing that Josh was curious, wondering if he might even be lucky enough to receive the gift Pleasure Island bestows on some.</br>
<br>"I got these ears shortly after arriving here a few years ago. In fact, if memory serves me correctly, it was in this bar that I first got them. Been natural for me since then, but it was strange when I first got them. If you had some time, boy could I tell you a few stories!" Jim slaps a hand on his jiggling belly.</br>
<br>Josh looked at Jesse, Jesse being uninterested, his attention was somewhere else while he looked at Jim. Josh backhanded Jesse lightly, bringing him out of his daze, and back to the world they lived in.</br>
<br>"Did you hear the man?"</br>
<br>"Uh... yep!"</br>
<br>"Uh... I doubt it! Are you interested in hearing his story or not?"</br>
<br>"No... not really. In fact, I am really bored right about now, so can we get out of here?"</br>
<br>"You can leave if you want to... I want to hear what Jim has to say. I think its neat that he even has bear ears, simply because it isn't supposed to be possible."</br>
<br>"Whatever Josh, it's your choice... do what you want, I am out of here."</br>
<br>As Jesse is about to leave, he turns and looks at Josh for a final time. Josh upset that Jesse was being rude, not to mention leaving him there when they came together, Josh shouts to Jesse. "Yeah... I don't even know why I had you come along with me in the first place! You never show any interest in what I want to do and you get mad at me when I flat out don't act as though I am interested in what is going on or as though I am having fun. You leave, you leave and just go home. Pleasure Island just isn't a place for you!"</br>
<br>As his verbal onslaught ended, Jesse turned back in the direction he was headed, hung his head slightly and walked out of the bar. Josh watched as Jesse walked past the windows, heading in the direction of the ferry to get back. When Jesse was no longer in sight, Josh huffed, releasing his anger in a single puff. Jim looked at Josh, surprised even more that he would do something like that just to hear what he had to say. Josh looked back at Jim, his face getting it's color back from being just red as can be, sitting there and waiting intently for whatever Jim had to say.</br>
<br>"Go ahead Jim. I am sorry for that little skirmish, please go on."</br>
<br>Jim smiled, showing his teeth off once more, standing and looking Josh in the eyes. "Ok, sure I will tell you my story. Like I said before, it was in this bar where I first found out that I had these ears. It was getting dark and I had a couple brews from the tap. When I went to get up, I noticed that I was a bit woozier than I should have been from just having a couple brews. I slowly got up from the bar, requesting another drink to be poured mind you, and when I got that new glass, I stumbled into the bathroom. Not even realizing how thirsty I had been, I downed the mug by the time I got to the bathroom, and as you can see it really isn't that far to walk. So anyhow, standing in the bathroom, I look at my face, my head swimming and at first I thought my eyes were playing tricks with me. Putting my hands where I though my ears were still, I didn't feel anything and then I thought I was losing it. Searching for them, as if I could lose them to begin with, I found them sitting on the top of my head, just the way they are now. So, from then on I had bear ears."</br>
<br>"Very interesting! So... does everyone get them?"</br>
<br>"It would be nice if that were the case, but sadly not everyone is lucky enough to grow ears like mine or like some of the other folk in here."</br>
<br>Josh looks as Jim points to a group in the far corner that were enjoying brews of their own. At first, Josh thought he wasn't seeing clearly, but quickly realized that he was. Josh saw that they all had wolf ears.</br>
<br>"So you either get bear or wolf ears then? I guess that is cool, but I don't know where luck would play into that."</br>
<br>"Well... see, here is the thing. Most men who come to Pleasure Island come for fun and that is exactly what they get. However, while some get to be in control of their fun, others aren't fortunate to even get a choice. On this island, you can get bear ears like mine or wolf ears like theirs, but you can also get donkey ears. They are the unlucky ones. For them, it would have been better if they didn't get new ears, which happen to some."</br>
<br>"What is so bad about getting donkey ears, they sound like they would be fun to play with!"</br>
<br>"Trust me, even though they might be fun to play with, consequences come from getting them. Men who get donkey ears are considered to be the lowest of the low, the ones who don't follow rules or don't play along with them. They are guilty by their ears..."</br>
<br>"What happens to those guys afterward?"</br>
<br>"They change completely into donkeys, both mentally and physically. permanently. After the change is complete, they are wrangled up on the island, placed in a corral and when there are enough of them, they get shipped off to farms around the United States. They live out their lives as working donkeys, either breeding with jennys or busting their butts in hard manual labor. That is why you don't see a whole lot of guys around. We are either in bars, enjoying other areas of the island, or spending time at our homes that are given to us to live our lives here. Any one of us can get donkey ears at any time from breaking a rule."</br>
<br>"How is that possible? I mean you already have bear or wolf ears, how can that change?"</br>
<br>"To be really honest with you... not one of us knows, but we have seen it happen to friends of ours. A couple bears and wolves were together once, they did something they weren't supposed to and it was something the magic on Pleasure Island wont tolerate. Before anyone knew it, one of the bears and wolves lost their ears for a second while they changed, flopping down and hanging in front of their faces. Shortly there after, both were one hundred percent donkeys, kicking and braying, almost injuring the two who didn't change into what those to were."</br>
<br>"Do you know what kept the bear and wolf safe?"</br>
<br>"Yep, it was a good thing too, because I have run into a close buddy of mine who did what the other two did. I saved his behind, but just barely. It was an open admonition of what was taking place and what he did. The two who remained as they were, openly expressed how they wouldn't be caught being part of their actions, that they would not tolerate even being around the two who were breaking the rules. My friend thought I was lying, tested the magic here and when the punishment was being brought on, he got real scared, real quick. He shouted apologies, promising to never test things again, just living his life the way the island allowed. Needless to say, he was even luckier in being allowed a second chance!"</br>
<br>"Wow... pretty heavy stuff! Will you tell me what it was?"</br>
<br>Jim hesitated for a moment, not knowing if he should even say anything, since Josh had not grown any ears as of yet and he didn't want to jinx the guy. Sighing softly, Jim decided it was best for him to know, especially if he was to get a pair. "My friend and the others liked to steal. Although, there is not a rule about stealing here, with the exception of one thing. People get a thrill out of taking what they weren't supposed to have, but if you took something from someone you consider as a friend, the magic changes you right away. Don't ask me how, I can't even begin to try to understand it, again I know it to be true cause I watched it with my bud."</br>
<br>"Huh... well I don't think I would be doing that regardless of having animal ears or not. That is just wrong for someone to even do in the first place. Second of all, I am a straight shooter and I have never been in trouble a day in my life. I am not planning for things with that to ever change for even an instant, too many problems that come with it, creating a heck of a lot of complications as well."</br>
<br>Jim smiled, thinking that Josh would be great as a wolf or a bear. He was friends with both species and that was perfect for him. Wondering if Josh would ever get ears though, Jim continued to look at Josh, watching him like watching a television. Thinking the guy might be thirsty by now, especially coming into a bar in the first place and not having a drink yet, Jim poured a glass of Pleasure Island brew and set it on the bar on top of a coaster.</br>
<br>"Hey Josh! Are you thirsty there bud?"</br>
<br>"Yeah, now that you mention it, I am!"</br>
<br>Jim smiles, sliding Josh the decent sized mug in front of him, pointing to it with an open hand.</br>
<br>"Go ahead bud, drink up. This is the same brew I had when I first got here, but remember that while it is tasty it is also strong."</br>
<br>Josh looked at the dark amber colored liquid while it still had a hint of foam floating on the top, wondering if he should drink it or not. He knew that he was underage, but he also knew that those rules didn't apply where was was for the moment. Josh hesitated further, wondering if the brew was the cause of the animal ears.</br>
<br>"Hey Jim, do you know if the brew is what makes guys ears' change?"</br>
<br>"Can't really say bro, don't know to be quite honest with you. I know of some getting ears without drinking and I know others, including myself, who drank and got ears after. There are even some of us out there that drank brew, had it pass through their systems and being long gone after leaving the island to go to their respective homes, they grew new ears and had to return here. The world isn't safe for our kind, werebears and werewolves alike, but it is definitely safe here."</br>
<br>When Jim said werebears and werewolves, Josh found that he wasn't surprised to hear it. Actually, it made sense to Josh, even having the ears constantly. It was pretty much their class system like it was back home, people being anywhere from low class to middle or even upper, while even having classes in the middle for better distinction. It was simple on Pleasure Island, ending up being a donkey guys had to be asses, ending up a bear or wolf was what guys should hope for. Josh shrugged his shoulders, knowing he only had one life to live, not having another chance to do things twice, he picked up the mug and took a taste.</br>
<br>The brew was good and it did have a kick to it, slightly though. Josh downed the first mug like there was nothing to it, smacking his lips together, figuring out exactly what flavored it. Jim sensing Josh's liking of the brew, he poured a second mug of the same size and slid it in front of Josh. This time, not even hesitating for a moment, Josh grabbed the brew and slammed it straight down. Slamming the mug on the bar counter, Josh called for a third. A hiccup came out of his mouth, making him tilt back a bit, suddenly making the room spin slowly. Jim smiled, thankful that he wasn't the only one who had it light the first time having that particular and special blend. Josh, in a slight drunken stupor, grabbed the third mug and guzzled it down, making his third the doosie.</br>
<br>Sitting there for a moment, letting the room stop spinning, Josh felt a discomfort in his bladder and realizing he needed to release it somewhere pretty quick. He got to his feet, completely unable to stand and falling almost immediately from his knees failing to keep him up. Jim ducked under the risible section of the bar, somewhat running to help his newly found friend, he stood there with a smile while towering over Josh. Seeing how drunk Josh was, Jim got him to his feet and pretty much carried the young man. Josh just pointed to the bathroom area making Jim guess he needed to use the facilities. Jim pretty much carried Josh, even though the boy was propped up on Jim's shoulder with his feet lazily dragging behind the pair. Jim pushed the swinging door open with a foot that was free, helping Josh to a urinal, hoping that the kid would be able to handle the rest on his own. Josh got a bit more of himself together when he realized where he was, standing on his own, undoing his fly and pulling his "little man", as he called it, out and let his bladder drain.</br>
<br>While Josh was finishing up, Jim was checking his bearded face, ensuring there was nothing out of the ordinary or the very emergence of a pimple. Jim saw in the reflection that Josh was finished, shaking himself free of any urine left on his member, then zipped up while flushing and turning to face Jim. Jim just looked at Josh, a smile on his face, noticing what was there now. He didn't know if Josh just got his new ears or if he hadn't noticed them until now. Whatever the case was, it was clear to Jim that they definitely were there now, being the only thing that really even mattered. As Josh walked toward the sink to cleanse his hands, he caught his reflection in the mirror. He also saw Jim smiling, happy that Josh's new ears formed. What they saw was a pair of...</br></p>
