<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Whether Alex consciously recognized it or not, his toon transformation has brought on a whole new attitude and way of thinking. In addition to feeling stronger, faster, hotter, and hornier, Alex felt like he could overcome anything, do anything. All the inhibitions that the old Alex had were gone, all the nagging voices in his head that told him what he could or could not do have been pushed down inside of him out of reach. Much like his new 2-D appearance, in a way his personality has become flatter, defined by one word: confidence. Alex can remember when he was a weak human, bound by social expectations and responsibilities, but that time in his life feels distant and laughable now. No, that time is over. Now Alex can do what ever he wants, and he wants to be bad.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Rachel and Tiffany were lounging at Rachel&#39;s place. It was a holiday weekend so they didn&#39;t have cheer practice. It wasn&#39;t easy being popular, privileged, and spoiled. Everyone thinks that cheer captain Rachel and her BFF must have it so easy, but having the expectations put on them that they do is exhausting, and those people are just jealous bitches anyways.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and then I said to her, that she can go... wait, do you feel that?&quot; Tiffany and Rachel exchange nervous glances as the ground rumbles.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s and earthquake!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, it sounds more like a stampede!&quot;<br />
Suddenly there is a blast as a massive, 9 foot tall and about half as wide figure bursts through the living room wall. &quot;Oh Yeah!&quot; it shouts. The two girls cough as the drywall dust settles, but soon see the cause of the destruction, a cartoon wolf who&#39;s mostly muscle and the rest is teeth in the shape of a grin, his muzzle alone the size of either of their torsos. They wouldn&#39;t believe it if they weren&#39;t looking right at it, though it does take a few moments even with the spectacle right in front of them.<br />
<br />
Then they both screamed.<br />
&quot;Ladies, ladies! I know you must be excited to see me, but contain yourselves!&quot;<br />
Rachel silences herself, more out of fear than anything else, but Tiffany stands up. &quot;Who are you and what do you think you&#39;re doing?! You can&#39;t barge into people&#39;s homes like that!&quot;<br />
&quot;Behave yourself lady, I&#39;m not even here for you,&quot; Alex Growls.<br />
&quot;Behave?!&quot; Tiffany walks right up to the wolf and pokes him in the chest while she rants. &quot;I don&#39;t know who you think you are, mister, but you&#39;re the one trespassing and destroying property! If you have half a mind you&#39;d start running now before the police show up! oh, when my father hears about this, you are going to be put away for so long that you&#39;ll be sorry that you ever crossed--&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Alex swiftly bends down and swallows half of Tiffany&#39;s body, prompting her to let out a muffled scream of &quot;What the hell!&quot;. As he stands back up, Tiffany&#39;s limbs wildly flail about as she tries to cling onto anything to pull herself out, including Alex&#39;s cheek fur and thick lips. Alex then uses his large, gloved finger to shove each of her limbs one by one into his mouth. Once Tiffany&#39;s last leg clears his lips, Alex closes his mouth like a bear trap and grins, revealing Tiffany trapped behind his pearly white teeth.<br />
<br />
With his grin still intact, Alex rolls his tongue around like waves, dragging Tiffany towards his throat. Tiffany panics and cries out for help as she slides backwards, desperately trying to grab onto anything, but everything is too slippery and coated in drool. Rachel watches in terror as she catches a glimpse of her friend&#39;s arms grasping the wolf&#39;s uvula at the back of his throat before that too slips out of her grasp and disappears into the unknown abyss, forever lost as food to this beast.<br />
<br />
 As Alex swallows Tiffany whole, he can feel her squirming and writhing in his stomach. He chuckles to himself, thinking about how satisfied he feels. As &quot;the big bad wolf,&quot; he is a predator driven only by a primal instinct to hunt and consume prey, and finds no greater pleasure than fulfilling his role. <br />
<br />
Rachel is paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. She stares at Alex in disbelief, realizing that she is now alone with this monster. Alex slowly turns his gaze towards her, and Rachel can feel her heart racing in her chest. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re next,&quot; Alex says, his voice low and menacing. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll make sure to savor every last bite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel tries to run, but Alex is too quick for her. He pounces on her, pinning her to the ground with his massive paw. She struggles and fights, but it&#39;s no use. Alex is too strong for her. As he prepares to devour Rachel, she thinks to herself that this is it. This is how it ends. She closes her eyes and waits for the inevitable. He opens his jaws wide and swallows Rachel whole. As Alex&#39;s stomach bulges and distends, he lets out a loud, satisfied belch. He pats his belly contentedly, relishing in the feeling of having his two victims trapped inside of him. He can feel them wriggling and squirming inside of him, their screams muffled by the walls of his stomach. But Alex is not bothered by their distress. In fact, he finds it quite amusing.<br />
<br />
As he walks down the street, people stare at him in horror and disbelief. His stomach is so swollen that it looks like he&#39;s pregnant with a litter of pups. But Alex just grins at them, feeling powerful and invincible. He knows that he can do whatever he wants, and that no one can stop him. He can eat whoever he wants, whenever he wants. And he intends to keep doing just that.</p>
