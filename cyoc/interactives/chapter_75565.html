<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I resumed my original quest to find a location to create my castle.  I had tired myself in my pursuit of the <br />
deer, so I made things easier.  I wished to know what would be considered the exact middle of the woods, based <br />
upon any realistic points of entry.  I figured this would be considered the deepest point of the woods.  To my <br />
surprise I realized that I was already at that area.  The knowledge came rushing into my mind that I was <br />
standing almost exactly at what was the heart of the woods.<br />
<br />
I decided to change back into my normal form.  I concentrated again on the image of my human or, rather, <br />
vampire form and felt the changes occur.  My muscles returned to normal size, the hair receded, my muzzle <br />
retracted.  All other features quickly returned to normal.  I realized I was naked, so I wished that I was <br />
fully clothed in the clothes I had torn out of earlier.  They reappeared in an instant.<br />
<br />
I had an idea of the type of castle I wanted.  I didn’t know how to put it into words, however.  So I wished <br />
that the castle I pictured in my mind would appear before me.  The ground began to shake beneath my feet.  I <br />
backed up several yards until the ground felt firm again.  From out of the ground grew the castle I pictured.  <br />
It was as if a great force from the underworld gave birth to my wish.<br />
<br />
The castle sprang up in only a minute’s time.  I stepped back again to better admire it.  The entrance to the <br />
castle was directly before me.  There was a narrowing staircase consisting of about 15 steps that led to a <br />
massive wooden door.  Different types of hideous looking gargoyles lined the top of the staircase as if to <br />
scare away any who dared climb the steps.  The castle appeared to be made of solid stone.  <br />
<br />
I eagerly climbed the stairs and approached the door.  I noticed there was no handle or knob with which to <br />
open the door.  There was a very large door knocker, however.  I was about to use it until I remembered there <br />
was no one inside.  I just looked at the door and thought.  I said, “Open!” and to my minimal surprise, the <br />
door swung open with a significant creaking sound.  “Very nice,” I said.<br />
<br />
I walked slowly inside.  There was nothing but darkness in front of me.  This room possessed no windows and so <br />
no light penetrated it, but for the light coming in through the still open front door.  I raised my arms up <br />
and said, “Light!”  Throughout the room dozens of torches blazed fire.  It was enough to keep the room well <br />
lit.  I turned back to the door and commanded, “Close!”  The door creaked again until it slammed shut.  <br />
<br />
So far I received exactly what I wanted.  I had wanted my castle to be essentially an extension of myself.  I <br />
wanted it to be something that I could command and have it obey.  I had control of it.<br />
<br />
I looked at the now lit room.  It was a very large room.  It was immense and foreboding.  It showed the <br />
classic signs of a haunted house, with cobwebs and evidence of decay.  There were several objects covered in <br />
sheets.  I could only assume they were pieces of furniture that were meant to show signs of not being used.<br />
<br />
The most prominent feature in the room was another massive staircase.  It was like something out of the <br />
classic Dracula movie.  I could almost see Bela Lugosi, candelabra in hand, welcoming me to his home.  Only <br />
this was my home.  The staircase was similar to the one outside, as the steps narrowed as it reached the top.  <br />
<br />
I walked up the staircase which had what looked like velvet covering.  At the top of the stairs was a long <br />
hallway which went in both directions.  I decided to head to my left.  Thick walls covered either side of the <br />
hall after several feet.  Again I commanded, “Light!” and several more torches lit the way.  The hall soon <br />
came to an end but revealed an opening to the right.  This hall was already well lit.  The left side of the <br />
hall was solid stone, but I could see several doors on the right side.  I tried to open a few of them but they <br />
were locked.  Presently I did not care to know why or how.  I walked down the remainder of this hallway until <br />
it, too, ended to reveal another hall to the right.<br />
<br />
This hallway had some small amounts of natural light piercing it from the left side.  It was sufficient enough <br />
for me to walk without needing additional light.  The light came through a series of thick, stained glass <br />
windows.  They all looked almost medieval in design.  The windows were the only things on the left side of <br />
this hall.  On the right side of the hall there was one large door, perfectly positioned in the center of the <br />
hall.  I passed it by for the moment as I instead continued to the end of the hall.  Once again I could only <br />
turn to the right.  This hallway was also lit with torches.  Apparently my command worked for the entire <br />
floor.  Also once again, the left side was solid stone while the right side contained several doors.  I went <br />
to the first one I could reach and found it locked just like the doors in the opposite hall.<br />
<br />
I returned to the previous hall and walked back to the large door.  This time I finally found an unlocked <br />
door.  I walked into a really large room and was surprised by what I saw.  The room looked like it was a kind <br />
of lounge.  It appeared very modern, quite unlike anything I had yet seen.  There were several couches, chairs <br />
and TVs.  There was even what appeared to be a small bar towards the back.  The ceiling was high and the walls <br />
on either side had as many doors as the halls on the outside.  The room itself stretched back to go as far as <br />
what I presumed was the first hallway I entered.<br />
<br />
I proceeded to check the doors.  I found they all led to fully furnished bedrooms, save for the two in the <br />
middle on either side.  Those doors lead to deluxe-sized bathrooms.  It seemed to me that my vision for my <br />
castle included the potential for several people to be able to live here.  I wasn’t sure how that might work <br />
as of yet, but it was something I’d be willing to explore.<br />
<br />
And as I thought about what I had seen in this castle so far, I realized that there were still a few things <br />
missing.</p>
