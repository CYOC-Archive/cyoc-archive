<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Animalians were very quick to get into the spirit of the holiday. Once they were told what Halloween was about, There were many who were eager to try on some costumes. Fortunately, there was a costume company that was eager to supply custom costumes for the town. The amount of advertising would sure to skyrocket sales just from having the uplifted and converted walk around in their costumes. This made for some very interesting looks.<br />
<br />
Unsurprisingly, cowboy and cowgirl outfits were high in demand, especially since there were so many uplifted cows and horses who were wanting to get into the spirit of the Old West. It was a bit easier to pick out the horses and cows who didn&#39;t dress up like the cast of a spaghetti western. One such couple were Abby and Samson. Abby seriously considered being a cowgirl, but she felt that would have been a bit too much of a stereotype. Besides, she could hardly dress like she was going ride a horse when she was a horse now. Samson decided to take some inspiration from his Biblical counterpart and dressed up in a barbarian outfit. Abby certainly liked it since it left his chiseled chest on display. She decided to do something similar and dressed up in a barbarian babe outfit, which namely featured a fur bikini. Not real fur, of course, fur coats were obviously not something that Animalians would care for, unless it was the fur coat on their bodies.<br />
<br />
Sarah hadn&#39;t been sure what to dress up as, but Malice was a big factor in what she ended up going as. Malice had decided to dress up like a jailbird. Not the modern orange jumpsuit kind, the old-fashioned kind with horizontal black and white stripes and a little hat of the same pattern. Malice joked that the outfit made her look fat, but then again, it mostly covered the parts that Malice wanted to look larger. You see, Malice was wearing a sexier version of a jailbird outfit, which mainly consisted of a halter top, hot pants, said hat, and a domino mask. She also had a pair of manacles on her wrists, though the chains on them weren&#39;t connected to anything. She had considered a ball and chain, but decided that would be too much to lug around.<br />
<br />
Malice was planning on spending most of Halloween trying to tease any police officers (real or costumed) into chasing her. And considering Malice was pretending to be a prisoner on the run, Sarah thought it&#39;d be appropriate for her to dress up as a Mountie. The two of them had a lot of fun with Malice dashing off only to find that Sarah had &#39;somehow&#39; beaten her there. Sarah may have been a husky instead of a basset hound (something she was very grateful about), but it was still very hilarious to anyone who saw the old Droopy cartoons. Sarah&#39;s Mountie outfit also went well with Travis&#39;s fireman outfit, though his was actually closer to the real thing.<br />
<br />
For Jessica, there was naturally only one choice. A red evening gown, some purple opera gloves, some makeup, and she was a real-life Jessica Rabbit. Of course, she couldn&#39;t wear the appropriate shoes because of her large rabbit feet and her figure wasn&#39;t as over-endowed as the legendary Jessica. Then again, no real woman could have Jessica&#39;s cartoonishly impossible figure. Waists simply couldn&#39;t be that small. Even so, Jessica hoped she could be at least partially as sexy as the Toon femme fatale when she got older. She was kind of expecting Roger to be dressing up as his Toon counterpart, but he ended up dressing up as Usagi Yojimbo from the comic of the same name. Though a little disappointed for the missed couple opportunity, she had to admit that Roger made a handsome ronin. Maybe she could do something similar next year.<br />
<br />
Sophie wasn&#39;t under as much pressure to dress up as anyone in particular. But because she wanted to make it up to JC for being left out of so much fun, she dressed up as a pirate, with her faithful parrot riding on her shoulder. But just in case, she had a cord around one of JC&#39;s legs to keep him from flying off. The parrot seemed eager to be out of the house and Sophie didn&#39;t want to lose him. She still wasn&#39;t sure for certain if she wanted to uplift JC, but she figured she had plenty of time. Parrots did have very long lifespans after all.<br />
<br />
Many other Animalians were dressing up for the occasion. Judy dressed up like her counterpart from Zootopia. She even found a fox named Nick to be her partner. Marlysa was wearing her bridal gown, but she also had stegosaurus-like plates attached to her back to make her a literal bridezilla. Several of the rescued stallions like Red Cloud, Thunder, and Stormheart were dressed up like Native Americans to match their names and their mates were also wearing similar costumes. Even Clara and Robby had gotten into the act, dressing up as a witch and a skeleton respectively.</p>
