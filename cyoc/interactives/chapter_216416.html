<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">leaving off of the arena as you shortly were walking around the backstage area to find Lupine the wolf, Nightfire the lion, Riptid the shark, and Shinning Saber the dragon that you felt confident enough to this point of meeting up with them for the first time in your life. although, you thought about which One of the wrestlers from the MC&#39;s staff who wanted to speak to you with as you also wondered what he wanted to talk to you about. thinking about it more as it could of been the MC&#39;s new crocodile-man that it could also could be the new grizzly bear-man, the snake-man, the octopus-man, the gorilla-man, the hippo-man, not to mention the eagle-man, and the tyrannosaurus rex-men that you wondered who was this anthro wrestler. just then, you saw them as they were heading out to the ring arena that you decided to follow them and see what was up.<br />
<br />
tailing up behind them that you followed them out to the arena ring site, to where it all began as the MC was standing there in the middle of it all while holding onto the mic with one hand. entering into the ring for &#39;The Out Lawers&#39; shortly followed after words that you stood with Shinning Saber behind you, Lupine to your left as Nightfire was to your right while Riptid was next to him. not sure why they were out here as you wanted to chat with them and see if they wanted to work at your place, but you were about to find out that the MC soon began to speak into the mic for the audience to hear.<br />
<br />
&quot;and here we have it, folks! The great wrestling league match off challenge champion, is here to greet us! we also have our very special guest here, The Out Lawers! Nightfire, the lion! and following with him are Lupine the wolf, Riptid the shark, and Shinning Saber the dragon!&quot; the MC spoke as they each made a fiercing roar that shook the audience with excitement to their knees, before having to settle down the crowd<br />
<br />
&quot;now then, not only did you save yourself from turning into an ass on your first match off, but also becoming an anthropomorphic beast while doing some crazy job that would hire you to pay off your debt from us! even if you decided to come wrestle for us to pay it off for a week, maybe even longer. still though, you&#39;ve pressed on that you&#39;ve beaten up B.F.T.P for second prize as it was a free trip to next years Pleasure island! and if that wasn&#39;t enough to satisfy your thirst to this fight that you&#39;ve also bested my best kangaroo-man! that being said, I don&#39;t know what to say to you. well, maybe except... CONGRATULATIONS! you&#39;ve won the challenge face off that you not only won second place prize, but look behind you.&quot; the MC said as you did just that.<br />
<br />
turning to see the four beast like wrestlers that they each were stun to begin looking at each other, before turning back to look at you. you began to realize what the prize was as you&#39;ve turn back to face the MC again, before speaking again. &quot;as you can see, these are our best wrestlers around. with your skills fighting with some good new wrestlers that are now under your wing, what&#39;s four more to your team, right? consider them as a gift for winning first place prize. so now, you have not only these four, but with the kangaroo, the bear, and the alligator wrestlers of ours as you punished them to be your new wrestling league start up that you&#39;ve now have seven...&quot;<br />
<br />
the MC was about to saw something about your new wrestling league start up, when you made a curation on a few things as you began to explain what they were. &quot;um, technically eight. you see a donkey that was once human is now an anthro stripped hyena as he was in the gym when this all happened. you can even ask the snake-man over there as he was there to conform all of this that what I say here is the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
the MC turned to him as he bowed his head while signaling that what you said was true, before turning back to you. telling the MC you now have eight fighting anthro wrestlers instead of seven. this made the MC pale as things looked like one just saw a ghost, before continuing back to what the MC was saying before the interruption.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, ok! eight then. still though, you now have enough for an equal team of eight wrestlers to match up with mine. to this, I&#39;ve made a special great wrestling league match off challenge match for the two of us. having people already signing up on the sheet to face off against some of our own wrestlers that I&#39;ve chosen two of my fighters for this set up. even though it&#39;s a special match that they can make it into a tag team match off as I&#39;ve chosen my grizzly bear-man, and my gorilla-man. yet I even made it special enough to have my snake-man as my substitute for any of my two fighters.&quot; the MC said that the snake-man was surprised and stun to hear he was also in this match fight as he even looked... frightened.<br />
<br />
thinking that it might be a good idea to have a few new wrestlers on the team, you decided to agree to this. however, you noticed the snake-man was shacking and quivering in his boot first to wonder why that you asked as the MC wasn&#39;t telling the hole story about what would happen if your team should loose. turns out, your hunch was correct as the MC told you the rest of the special match offs.<br />
<br />
&quot;hmm, you catch on to a quick ball than to bee for it&#39;s honey. alright! the roles are simple! should your team wins off against each one of your fighters that you, and your team gets to punish them that enter the ring as it could be almost anything you want. however, that&#39;s not without its flaw backs for should your side could lose as well.&quot; the MC said, just as the sign up sheet was shortly handed over to by the eagle-man as you were figuring out who to sent into this match.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh! it seems that I only have not one, not two, but six matches signed in for my team! as for your team that you have... oh, my! you have here three tag matches, and ten one on one matches that are signed in for on your team. now that you think about it, it&#39;s about two of your matches to my one almost. however, because that i&#39;m not completely merciless to my rivaling team... i&#39;m going to set this up with in two days time. that should be enough time to set up your team as to who will fight where. until then... have yourselves a great day to you all!&quot; the MC said to only drop the mic after.<br />
<br />
shortly seeing the match sheet that only three of the one on one fights were female as there was a tag fight with a girl in one of them to. thinking it was best to summon back your kangaroo wrestler for your shark-man Riptid that with a snap of your fingers, you did as you also brought back with her your anthro hyena. thinking it wold be best to have Nightfire in the ring for the boys while having Red Jack, now renamed DJ in the ring for the girls might be your best shot yet. even if Nightfire was your lion wrestler for you have him tagged up with Shinning Saber the dragon for your tags as you have D.J. being tagged up with Kirdy the stripped hyena for one out of the three matches with that one girl problem made things a lot easier.<br />
<br />
with only seven other matches left to sort out that Lupine wasn&#39;t who he said he was. it turns out that his real name was Alex for one, but what really made you pale was he was once a she by the name of D.G. (Dorothy Gale). thinking it was best to call him A.D.G. from now on that to him, it was better then being called Fido as he liked it even for you explained to him what the name really meant.<br />
<br />
&quot;ok... let&#39;s just call you Alex, Dorothy Gale. A.D.G. for short. and also, we want to have you fighting in three of the one on one rounds. are you ok with this?&quot; you asked that he agreed to this, leaving only four matches to assign to who knows who as the others were wondering about this too.<br />
<br />
having Kirdy the stripped hyena entering one, while having Shinning Saber entering one himself also now only left you with two spots remaining. thinking as to who should go into this one on one fight that the choice was clearly obvious to you for you thought of no one else for this. so with a flick and a snap of your fingers, you brought back Riptid the shark as you told the gang of the group who&#39;s the last for the one on one fight.... yours truly.<br />
<br />
with the seating set up to who&#39;s fighting where that the group as this also included you to rest up, work out while training, and more that the two day flew by like you were having fun on a video game you like playing so much back home. it was time now, time to begin the great wrestling league match off challenge specials. as you were with your team that believe it or not... you were ready to fight.<br />
<br />
(oh boy, things are starting to get hot in here now. the the greatest wrestling league match off challenge may have ended, but a special league matches are about to begin. if the MC had anything to do with this that you might as well give thanks for the help of recruiting new wrestlers. if not however, then you You wondered what will she do next. then again, what is she up to? Again, thank you and happy reading to this point of the tale.)</p>
