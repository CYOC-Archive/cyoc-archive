<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lydia brushed her hair in the sunlight the next morning.  Her shoulder length brown hair tangled easily when wet.  The shower had been enjoyable now that she did not fear sudden loss of legs.  She felt she understood herself better now.  She could live with it.<br />
<br />
Lydia thought about writing down everything she knew about her curse.  Swimwear and water were the triggers.  But the transformation could go as fast or as slow as she liked if she controlled the amount of water she touched.  She had been able to make her breasts grow by dribbling a little on them alone.  She had prevented her legs from merging by keeping her pants between them.  Her colouring was related to the suit she wore.  She could control those things.  Sort of.<br />
<br />
It was just the changing back that she needed help on.  Sex; last week it had been something for other people.  Now it was something she needed.  Yu had been willing to help her so far, but would he be willing for a long time to come?  Lydia had thought about a future with Yu before.  It was a girlish thing to dream about weddings with her boyfriends.  But now she felt she needed Yu in a way that she was not so comfortable with.<br />
<br />
Standing up she went to her closet to find an outfit for the lazy Saturday.  Her uncertainties about Yu were smothered in her plans for him today.  Uncertainties could wait for later.  Right now she wanted to test her wish.<br />
<br />
Lydia pulled out a two-piece swimsuit from the drawer.  The top was shaped like a sports bra made of a deep-green spandex that shimmered as if it was already wet.  The warm sunlight made the top gleam about her curvy breasts as she turned in the mirror.  If only she was willing to get a little moist she could push her breasts into showy sizes but for now she would remain normal.  The bottom was a hot-pant cut set of spandex shorts that were a pebbled gray with two green strips down the left side.  She tied her hair back into a loose ponytail that would flop about playfully.  Lydia tossed an old cotton t-shirt over the ensemble letting the hem cover almost everything but her tan legs.<br />
<br />
Lydia giggled as she thought about how to start Yu's transformation.  Should she hide in the bathroom?  Or lay on the bed and stare dreamily at the ceiling?  Instead she just smiled at herself in the mirror.  She felt guilty trying to look herself in the eye.  There was nothing holding her back.  The build up was almost too much.  She had done everything she could to delay starting the wish but there were only so many things she could do before she had to leave her room and face the day.<br />
<br />
In her last moments of privacy she decided to trigger Yu's change.  Placing one hand on her crotch, above her shorts she spoke clearly to herself in the mirror.  &quot;Yu, come!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a simple command.  A tiny magic phrase and she giggled at how silly it made her seem.  There was no light or magic sparkles for her to see.  There was no change around her to let her know anything had happened.  The whole thing seemed silly and she would feel really embarrassed if the genie had lied to her.  She pulled up her shirt and held the waist line of her shorts out a little.  She could just see the hair-thin, golden lines that appeared above her pubic hair.  The lines spelled Yu's name in small, beautiful, cursive letters.  It would not be long, she thought, before Yu called to see if something was wrong.<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
Yu started his day late.  He slept late and woke slowly.  The sun was uncomfortably streaming through his blinds forcing him to waken.  Yu could hear the noises of his family downstairs.  The TV was on and the coffee was going stale.  Yu hoped that his family did not inquire about what he did last night when he had the house to himself.  He did not know if he could lie convincingly about something so wonderful.<br />
<br />
Yu made his way to the bathroom to shower.  The tile floor was frigid from the air-conditioning and he shivered a little in the nude.  He let the water run a bit to get warm while he brushed his teeth.  He felt sore in his muscles and emotionally worn out.  But as the water washed over his lithe body he felt happy.<br />
<br />
Lydia was alright with the changes that he had made to her.  She understood that he had not done it on purpose.  So what did it matter if she was different?  She liked it and he liked it.  They could get along.  He just had to be sure to let her know that her tail was not all he wanted from her.  Yu made a decision to wait a long while before he even thought to ask her to change for him.  In the mean time he might consider buying new suits for her to try.  He also thought about the camera he had once again forgotten.<br />
<br />
Yu briefly considered masturbation in the warm water but pushed it out of his mind.  After last night his penis felt bruised and a little raw.  Best to let it rest, he thought, now that it might get more frequent use.  He was feeling good as he soaped up.  But rubbing his body down all he could think about was Lydia's spandex arms rubbing all about him.  He pushed that thought out of his mind too.  Turning the cold tap up even more Yu let the water chill his skin before he got too excited.<br />
<br />
Stepping out of the shower, Yu dried off quickly with his towel.  Wrapping it around his lower half, he combed his hair tossed on his toiletries.  It was not a minute before he was back in his room rummaging for a not so wrinkled shirt.  He wondered if he should call Lydia to see if they were going to do something today.  He felt himself getting stiff under the towel.<br />
<br />
It was going to be difficult, he thought, if I cannot even think about her without getting hard.  But for the moment he decided to feel the physical manifestation of his desire.  He let his penis grow hard this time.  Let it tent the fluffy towel.  See, he imagined shouting; look how my manhood can lift a heavy towel.  Feeling brash in his closed room, Yu tore off the towel and let his erection stand tall and free.<br />
<br />
He almost yelled in panic when he saw it.  It was proud and stiff and it seemed bigger than it ever had been.  But it was also a shimmering deep-green colour.  He waggled it a little and the light from the window caused highlights to dance about the tube shaped body-part.  Tentatively he touched his cock.  It seemed to be covered in a spandex sock made to fit tight as a second skin over his shaft.  He tried to pull the spandex-condom off by the tip but all he felt was the soft, turgid flesh coated in shiny fabric.  He tried to find the edge of the fabric but found it merged seamlessly with his own skin at the base.  His penis was now made of wet-looking spandex.<br />
<br />
Yu had felt this type of spandex before on his girlfriend's body.  It was a magical change that one was no likely to forget after they had seen it once.  Yu calmed down slightly.  He understood that it was magic.  What he did not know was why it was working on him?  Was it a new freaky sexually transmitted disease?  Would he also become a horny merman?  Or worse, mermaid?<br />
<br />
As Yu thought, his fingers stroked the sensitive, stretchy fabric of his dick.  He felt a rising desire to do something with it and he thought of Lydia, again.  When that happened he felt the spandex stretch and crawl over his scrotum.  His sudden encasement in a spandex cock-sac drew his eyes back to deep-green.  Now he noticed something new.  The name Lydia was scrawled along his shaft in fine, gold script.<br />
<br />
Yu felt the tiniest of pulls on his groin as if his erection was now a directional pointer trying to lead him.  He had only one guess to where.<br />
<br />
He needed to call Lydia.</p>
