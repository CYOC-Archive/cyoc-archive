<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The fox/wolf collective watched in general amusement as Kyri'.... no, Kyriel remembered what her purpose was for coming into this mind in the first place. The little fox-angel looked up, her spiritual presence now stronger with determination despite her currently small body.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will not stop me,&quot; she said confidently, &quot;I am Kyriel, an angel whose current duty is to save Tommie's soul. You are nothing but fragments of his soul twisted with magic. You hold no power over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel had hoped that her little speech would show a crack in the dominant group - something that she could take advantage of to get behind them and release Tommie's id, ego and super-ego, and help save his true self. Instead, Tamthis merely smiled, while the two chained wolf-beasts bellowed with hoarse laughter. &quot;Silly girl,&quot; Queen Tammia gently chided, &quot;We are all one here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel turned around, shocked that the queen fox had managed to get around her. &quot;Wait,&quot; she remembered, &quot;I am in Tammia's mind. These guys can pop up anywhere...&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen Tammia smiled seductively. &quot;That is correct,&quot; she said, &quot;Oh, you shouldn't be surprised I know what you are thinking. After all, this is OUR domain. As such, we know anything that goes on in the minds of any &quot;intruders&quot; like you. Besides...&quot; Her body phased out, reappearing between Tommy's ego and id. &quot;These three are just lying to themselves. We are truly Tamthis, not some mere human boy that you and these beings claim to be. See...&quot; She reached up to the ego, scratching his fox-ears, resulting with the unconscious figure moaning, &quot;This one is already starting to accept the truth. It won't be long before he becomes part of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up you old nag!&quot; the bounded Id burst out, &quot;You don't have the faintest friggin' clue what the hell you're talking about. Of course we're Tommie! We're not the ones lyin'-&quot;<br />
<br />
Queen Tammia gently put a finger on the Id's bounded mouth, somehow silencing him. &quot;You should know better than that,&quot; she said to the Id, &quot;after all, you particularly wouldn't mind staying with us would you? After all, you were sooo interested in having sex with that little angel there weren't you?&quot; The queen looked at Lady Tammia, &quot;Dear, please come and show this handsome man what it feels like to be one of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold it you bitch!&quot; The id screamed, somehow breaking out of the queen's vocal control, &quot;You can't do that to me again! I won't let you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Tammia neared the chained man. &quot;Again?&quot; Kyriel said to herself while watching helplessly, &quot;What have they been doing to him? Is this how they are taking over?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her question was answered when the smiling Lady Tammia reached the Id. The Id struggled to move but - being the Id - also showed obvious signs of excitement of what was going to happen. Lady Tammia raised her hand.... and shoved it into the Id. Kyriel gasped in horror and leaped forward, hoping to reach the Tommies through sheer force. She suddenly found herself frozen in the air, a small distance away from Tamthis' throne. Tamthis' hand was raised, and had somehow magically bound Kyriel in her place. Kyriel looked back at the Id, hoping that the damage Lady Tammia had not been too severe... only to see a bizarre sight: Lady Tammia was INSERTING herself into the Id. <br />
<br />
As Lady Tammia disappeared, merging slowly through his chest, the Id's features changed. <br />
<br />
His mouth wrap snapped off as a snout appeared.<br />
<br />
Lady Tammia was up to her hips now.<br />
<br />
The Id's hands and feets became more fox-like, and he was growing a tail as his ears became more pointed.<br />
<br />
Only Lady Tammia's tail and legs were left out now.<br />
<br />
The Id moaned as fur sprouted all over his body, covering his skin completely. His voice raised several octaves higher as his anatomy slowly developed into their female equivalents.<br />
<br />
Lady Tammia was fully inside now. The Id - or what was formerly the Id - opened her eyes, still chained to the wall. The Queen helped her down. &quot;What did you do to him!?&quot; Kyriel screamed, frustrated by her helplessness.<br />
<br />
The queen smiled. &quot;Lady Tammia is showing this poor man the wonders of being one of us,&quot; She motioned to Lady Tammia, who was examining her body to make sure everything was alright, &quot;We can only demonstrate with this method temporarily, as they will split and turn back eventually...&quot; Queen Tammia grinned, &quot;But at least during that time we can show them the pleasures of our existences. It's a pity that it doesn't work on the.... &quot;Vulcan,&quot; as you called it? But no need to worry, we'll be able to show him in due time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lady Tammia giggled in agreement, &quot;And we can also show them the wonders of working with someone as glorious as Karther!&quot; The Wolf beasts rolled their eyes at the Lady's dedication to the now-nonexistent being, rather than to Karther's goals as they and Tamthis were 'self-programmed' for. Kyriel had had enough. She was furious at the events that she saw. &quot;I... will not let you do this!&quot; she screamed, her maid clothes tearing off and her spiritual body reverting to its true self. The holy light emitted from Kyriel's wings forced the wolves and foxes to shield their eyes... except for Tamthis, who stood up from his chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woman!&quot; he bellowed, &quot;I have had enough of your insults!&quot; <br />
<br />
The light was suddenly snuffed out, and the wolf/fox collective shook their heads, trying to recover from their dazes. They looked up at Kyriel and smiled evilly. Kyriel was being held by her neck by Tamthis, her hands grasping the one arm that Tamthis was using. 'Why...?' she thought to herself, 'Why aren't my powers working? I'm an angel... I'm making sure to remember by &quot;self&quot;... so why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tamthis chuckled at his struggling prey. &quot;You stupid fool,&quot; he said amusingly, &quot;MY soul is far stronger than you think. Besides... you are not just fighting me. Do you not remember that part of Lord Karther is always with me? Both he and I are dominant here, and you will NOT defeat us. Now... become part of me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire area, including its inhabitants, started to warp around Kyriel. Kyriel was frozen, unable to do anything as the area warped even more, disappearing into floating balls of light. The balls hovered briefly around Kyriel before dashing right into her body. Kyriel groaned as waves of confusion filled her head and little bolts of energy sparked on her body, quickly warping her entire body. Her body was changing into the different forms of Tamthis, and she screamed. The scream turned into a sensual moan as her body shifted into Queen Tammias. The moan turned into a giggle as her body shifted in the more humble Lady Tammia, then into an insane laugh as she transformed into the Male Wolf-Beast king. The laugh became howls of pleasure as she shifted into the artificial-looking Tammia, before coming back when the Wolf-Beast Queen took over. She quickly started to turn into Tamthis...<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet.&quot; The calm voice of Tamthis said omnipresently, &quot;I will have you show a more interesting form to me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyriel turned back into Queen Tammia, and transformed into a new version of Tamthis altogether. She kept Queen Tammia's goddess-like body, but her features became slightly more wolven, a cross between the fox and wolf beings that already existed. More tails burst forth from her tailbone, ending with more tails than all but Tamthis. Her fur shined brightly as her hair elongated and matched the color of Tamthis. The room reappeared again as Kyriel was finishing her transformation. The collective looked on with pleasure as the groaning Kyriel's wings were slowly sucked into her back, and the new fox-wolf shivered with pleasure as the wings were absorbed completely. There was silence, and the godly wolf-fox raised her head and opened her eyes, revealing pupils as gold as Tamthis. She was a hybrid of the various forms, sharing Queen Tammia's beauty yet also showing a slightly wild look due to the wolfish qualities emulated from the Wolf-Beasts. Her hair, fur, tail and eyes however, shared the most similarity to king Tamthis. <br />
<br />
The fox-wolf smiled. &quot;We are now as one, are we not?&quot; She stretched, showing her naked form to the other foxes and wolves, &quot;And now we have finally retrieved our second body... though it may be in a shape different than before.&quot;</p>
