<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nicky paused for dramatic effect as the contestants uncomfortably squirmed. It always the final round. The final round managed to get everyone. After three physical challenges and tons of questions, some rivalries always developed. With it, the higher stakes and the added option for pettiness meant that every contestant always succumbed by this point. Anyone who&#39;d ever won Think or Twink had always done so before this round, meaning today the three of them would either make history for the world or make history for themselves, permanently changing their directions in life.<br />
<br />
For Eric, both options didn&#39;t seem that bad. Sure, he didn&#39;t want to be gay, but he didn&#39;t have anything against them. If he lost, he&#39;d definitely lose his virginity by the end of the night, even if he lost it in a way he wasn&#39;t currently interested in. And to be fair, none of the contestants would be able to go back to their old lives. Brian stood at only a penny and was nearing his fourth tick. With his changes he&#39;d never be a successful dealer again and his girlfriend wouldn&#39;t exactly be appreciative of his new member. Meanwhile, Micheal had ten dollars but just passed his fifth tick. He&#39;d probably already been fired from his law firm was already hired by his nearby beach and with his pink hair, below average IQ, and skimpy underwear, he&#39;d be a perfect fit. Finally, Eric had a thousand dollars and 6 ticks. His increased confidence, lowered weight, and comfortability with attention meant that he&#39;d probably have the best shot with women, though many would mainly be interested in pegging his always lubed ass or being naked in public with him. Regardless, Eric was getting laid, so he couldn&#39;t complain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Since I hear no complaints, I&#39;m assuming you guys totes wanna do it, maybe in more ways than one,&quot; Nicky suggested. &quot;But let&#39;s do the questions first, then each other. Alright, the average male has how many sexual partners in their lifetime?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian buzzed in, a quizzical look on his face. &quot;6?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct! So Brian, think or twink?&quot; Nicky asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think,&quot; Brian responded confidently, causing his score to rise to one dollar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, but didn&#39;t you here my advice? Ugh, next question,&quot; Nicky grumbled, though he still maintained his smile on his face. &quot;The phrase &#39;spit or swallow&#39; is a common phrase used to ask what a recipient will do when given this special creamy substance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian buzzed in again. Somehow, the bald man was just getting it faster than Eric. Micheal didn&#39;t even seem to be in the game now. He was so dumb, he looked lost in the studio. It was as if everyone was speaking a foreign language, which English now kind of was to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Semen,&quot; Brian answered, rolling his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, Brian not now. Later. But you are correct! Think or twink?&quot; Nicky offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think,&quot; Brian decided.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;re, like, on a roll with ten dollars. Now, what percentage of American homes own a cat?&quot;<br />
<br />
A long pause developed. Eric wasn&#39;t sure. Who looks up that kind of information? All the blonde could do guess was that it had to be a lot, right?<br />
<br />
Out of the corner of his eye, Eric could see Brian cupping the buzzer. Slowly, the bald man applied force on the button, shrouding him in pink light. &quot;60%?&quot; he guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo, you might have gotten too overconfident there. The correct answer was 30%. Computer, time to twink!&quot; Nicky announced.<br />
<br />
All three contestants watched with horror as Brian&#39;s meter rose past the fourth, fifth and sixth ticks. Eric couldn&#39;t see where it landed since the pink light soon blinded him entirely. When the dust settled and the light faded, it was clear Brian had changed drastically. The first change was that they&#39;d found where Nicky&#39;s vest went. That and a simple black thong was all Brian wore. It contrasted greatly with his neck length, curly reddish-orange hair that he now adorned. Before the bald had black hair that covered his body, but now the only place you could tell that Brian was a redhead was on his head. After all, the thong didn&#39;t cover much, and it was clear that even down there, he was completely smooth.<br />
<br />
None of that, however, was the most drastic change. The most drastic change was on top of his head and right above his ass. Protruding from his large amount of hair stood two cat ears the same color as Brian&#39;s hair. Eric couldn&#39;t tell if they were real or if his old ears remained since the redhead&#39;s hair now covered them, but the change was definitely apparent. Less apparent to the audience at least, was his tail, which had sprouted right above his ass. This one, Eric could tell was real, though it looked fake all the same. It had no fur, it was just a medium sized tail with a dildo shaped end.<br />
<br />
Nicky had a massive smile on his face seeing this change. &quot;Hey, like, you took my clothes! Though I think you&#39;ll need to see the rest for yourself. Computer, show us the camera feed on Brian.&quot;<br />
<br />
The feed appeared, and Brian looked at himself in horror. He ran a hand through his hair and felt the ears, deepening his fear. He looked like he was seeing his worst nightmare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! How am I going to go back to my girl like this? Even if I cheated on her dozens of times, I never expected this!&quot; Brian yelled, covering his mouth as he realized his voice betrayed him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone might be more of a pussy than we thought, pun intended,&quot; Nicky stated with a wink. &quot;Anything you wanna say to your girlfriend Brian?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, please, I&#39;m sorry I cheated on you so much and didn&#39;t regret it. I&#39;m sorry I got you fired from that company cause I didn&#39;t like a woman working. I&#39;m sorry your friend got sent to the hospital cause I sent some guys after him for looking at you funny. I&#39;m sorry--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hon, something tells me you might not be helping,&quot; Nicky advised, cutting him off. Brian thought for a moment before realizing his mistake and looked down in defeat. &quot;Let&#39;s move on. The syllables &#39;do re mi fa so la ti do&#39; are a group of syllables used to teach and train pitch. What is this group of syllables called?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, no one had an answer. Micheal might&#39;ve known it before, but there was no way he&#39;d know now. The room was silent up until the buzzer sounded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastic! That sound means no one got the answer in time. The answer was solfège. You know what that means? Computer, it&#39;s totes time to twink!&quot;<br />
<br />
Pink light enveloped the entire stadium once more. Micheal, who had been checking out his muscles during the current events, was shocked to feel that warm light on him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what? This only goes on if I&#39;m wrong. I didn&#39;t slap the ass cheek. What gives?&quot; Micheal asked. &quot;No stop! I wasn&#39;t wrong! I don&#39;t wanna be a fag! Noooo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nicky simply smiled as the light enveloped everyone once more. Eric didn&#39;t even flinch as the familiar prickling feeling encased him once more. The sensation acted similar to what it did previously, starting off with his entire body and gradually reduced in size. As it did, he could no longer feeling the parts of his body that weren&#39;t in the prickling feeling. Then, the sensation proceeded to focus itself on specific portions of his body. This time, it focused on his throat and brain. As it did, however, Eric began panicking. Thoughts of his IT career began flashing through his head, but when he tried to recall them, they now seemed foggy and unclear, like distant memories. Soon, he couldn&#39;t remember a thing about his tech job or his skills in them. In its place, knowledge of all types of music began emerging and taking hold in his brain, changing him permanently.<br />
<br />
When the light diminished. All three contestants had gone through similar changes. Looking at the board, Eric had gone through two ticks and now rested at 8 ticks. Micheal added two ticks as well, giving him 7 ticks. Brian, however, had the worst of it. Having been at 6 and a half ticks before, he now rested at a whopping 9 ticks! He didn&#39;t seem to mind though, based on the smile on his face.<br />
<br />
To be fair, from what Eric could see so far, he couldn&#39;t complain about his changes. In fact, he was estatic. For the first time in nearly two decades, he was skinny! All the excess fat on his body had disappeared, leaving Eric light and toned. He grazed his hands along his chest. It was smooth but taut. His legs seemed similarly toned. His arms didn&#39;t have much definition on them anymore, but honestly, he could deal with it. The only place that still felt heavy was his ass. Looking behind, he could tell his ass hadn&#39;t really shrunk at all. All that had changed was that it was muscle now, meaning that he could flex it just as he was currently doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, you all look so totally sexy! Let&#39;s see what changed. Eric, you first!&quot; Nicky ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I lost a lot of weight and--&quot; Eric cut himself off. His voice! It was much higher than before. It was also smoother, like cream had run down his throat. &quot;My voice! My voice is much higher! I sound like I&#39;m gay. Fuck!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like someone&#39;s got their summer bod and the voice of an angel to top it off. Hey Eric, try singing something for us,&quot; Nicky suggested.<br />
<br />
Eric decided to give it a shot. He sang the first song he could think of and to his surprise not only did he know all the words, he could sing them perfectly. He really did have the voice of an angel!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, like, that sounded amazing!&quot; Nicky noted while the crowd applauded. Eric felt amazing, he&#39;d never gotten so much respect in his life! Sure, his voice had lost all manliness, but the attention he was getting more than compensated. &quot;I actually think I got all hard and juiced up listening to that. Weird, huh? Anywho, let&#39;s move on. Micheal, what happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bro, it&#39;s Mike, Michael&#39;s too long. And once again nothing&#39;s happened. I&#39;m clearly too good for the machine,&quot; Mike explained with an ignorant smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geez, you really are stubborn aren&#39;t you. You&#39;ve convinced yourself that nothing&#39;s changed again! Well folks, as you can see, Michea-- I&#39;m mean Mike has lost lots of muscle. Now, he&#39;s only got enough muscle to be a good swimmer. And just like Eric, his face is totes cuter, as well. Computer, show us those changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Had my face gotten cuter, Eric thought to himself in confusion. He couldn&#39;t tell. Looking at the screen, however, it was clear. His eyes, though still sharp, had gotten softer and Mike&#39;s brown eyes had become doe-like in their innocence. The two shared matching button noses, each the perfect size for their faces. Their lips and faces had changed to accent their other changes: Eric had thick lips and a heart shaped jawline to attract attention and sing better whereas Mike received thinner lips and a rounded face to make him significantly cuter. Overall, straight or not, they could basically be classified as twinks now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm, don&#39;t you wanna just, like, smash your lips into theirs? Or shove something else through their lips? I know I do,&quot; Nicky stated, rubbing his package a little. &quot;Of course, someone here got the most changes of all. Brian hon, what happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m cute!&quot; Brian announced with a giggle. &quot;And my name is Bree silly!&quot;<br />
<br />
The redhead had completely changed in attitude. Sure, he always seemed happy before, but that was because he couldn&#39;t feel anger anymore. Now, he only seemed happy and giggly. On top of that, he was right: in every sense of the word, Bree was now cute. His eyes had changed to a sparkling green that was beyond soft and innocent. It would make anyone&#39;s heart melt immediately. The three contestants all had matching twinky noses that were small, upturned and cute and Bree was no exception. That coupled with his small yet thick lips more feline tongue that kept licking those lips meant that Bree could pounce on anyone and they wouldn&#39;t complain. And he&#39;d definitely be able to pounce now with his lighter body. The redhead seemed to have lost almost half a foot, going from taller than Eric to much shorter than him. His body had lost all muscle, leaving him completely smooth and soft. Unlike Mike and Eric, who retained a little usable muscle, Bree had none, completing his soft, innocent look.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell,&quot; Nicky responded. &quot;You know, you totally don&#39;t look 29 anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not, silly,&quot; Bree giggled. &quot;I&#39;m 21 now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that makes totes more sense,&quot; Nicky noted. &quot;Hey, by the way, do you need help with that?&quot;<br />
<br />
The green haired twink was pointing under Bree&#39;s podium. There, clear as day, the redheaded twink was sporting a clear hard-on. It was only about 3 inches, but no one could disagree. The redhead was horny.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not gay... yet! I&#39;m just so horny! I, like, wanna fuck all the time!&quot; Bree admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you do hon,&quot; Nicky agreed. &quot;So, our strong, well-formed men have now become totes cuter and sexier. What will happen to them next after this commercial break? Stay tuned to Think or Twink to find out!&quot;</p>
