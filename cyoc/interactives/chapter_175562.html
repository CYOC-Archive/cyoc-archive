<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was not terribly long after that - an hour or so later - for the next chapter of the changes to begin showing in Gabe and Terry, and it seemed both were keen on enjoying themselves. And as far as Danny was concerned, let them - he was going to have the last laugh after all. They were going to become reflections of their own perceptions of Asian guys at the end of this. Danny was just waiting for the pizza to get there, making sure he had the money for the occasion when he overheard the chatter going on in the other room;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, check me out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah dude, look at you! I heard of thirty minute abs before but this is ridiculous!&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny got up and slowly walked over to get a look. It seemed just at a glance that the changes were getting more involved. He smiled slightly, not wanting to make it too obvious he was anticipating these things. He didn&#39;t want the guys to make a stir about this at all. Gabe was standing there in the middle of the living room, a broad and dumb grin on his face. The former hairball seemed pleased as punch that his formerly stocky physique seemed at least a little...different.<br />
<br />
Even as he stood there, Danny was able to see that Gabe was now gifted a set of six, exceedingly well toned abs on his midsection, the obliques even as Danny watched starting to etch themselves in - more toned, giving Gabe a more distinguished physique for aesthetic appreciation...at least for now. Danny could tell just looking at him that he was very slightly thinner in a few other places, precipitating the loss of weight and muscle size that would surely follow in the coming week.<br />
<br />
The first of many that his girlfriend was going to remove from her own menu. The irony was delicious. As was the revenge for the way they thought they could talk down to him in secret.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey man, check this out!&quot; Oh, it seemed he leaned in a little too much. Danny walked over awkwardly at first when he was called out by Gabe, and then put on an act of being surprised;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Gabe, look at THAT!&quot; Danny observed the six pack as if he had not been expecting it, and moved over to put an arm around Gabe&#39;s shoulders. The jock would&#39;ve formerly recoiled at this kind of contact with Danny, but he this time seemed to take it as congratulations. Just the first steps to who and what he was ultimately going to be transforming into...<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, man. I swear, maybe it was just the workout in the pool that finally pushed me enough for this!&quot; Gabe&#39;s grin almost made Danny chuckle. Yep, Gabe was dumb as a sack of rocks, and even having this happen didn&#39;t alert him at all that anything was going on with him at all. Terry however seemed more preoccupied with something else. Or...rather, someone else. Namely, himself, as he looked at his reflection in the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
Terry grinned at his reflection, noting as he did that he was looking positively handsome today.<br />
<br />
Terry was not exactly what most would say was a phenomenally vain man, but you could be forgiven for thinking he was an outright man of the mirror! Danny admitted he himself had not quite so openly preened like that even when he was at the gym. &quot;Say, fellas,&quot; Terry contemplated, &quot;You figure you have a shot when the ladies get here? Because I am looking damn good so soon after the pool. Is it just the shine from the water on me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talk about a nonsequiter.&quot; Danny chuckled, eager to provide conversation so that they didn&#39;t overthink things. Though as he watched Gabe run his hands eagerly over his newly developed abs, and as Terry moved over to indulge in his newfound pride in his appearance, Danny supposed he was probably worrying about nothing. These two were just gonna keep going on in their ways most likely up until their changes were staring them in the face.<br />
<br />
And even then it was probably a crapshoot.<br />
<br />
Danny then heard the doorbell ring, and he left the two of them alone, just leaving in time to hear Gabe slap Terry on the ass jovially. &quot;Hey! Hands to yourself, ya lummox!&quot; Terry chuckled, murmuring his jock no homos under his breath. They weren&#39;t blatantly enjoying it yet, but it was clear that they were getting quite acclimated. Maybe by tomorrow things would get more homoerotic between these two guys. How long before the burgeoning curiosity became an attraction? And how long before that attraction overweighed their existing attractions?<br />
<br />
Well, that was why Danny loved having the ability to watch them so closely.<br />
<br />
He went ahead and got to the door, noting the pizza delivery guy was a thin, reedy guy. Probably a nerd taking a job while college classes were ongoing. Danny made a mental note to use the Chronivac to give this dude a tip - about 30 lbs of muscle should do it. Because the pizza was smelling nice!<br />
<br />
Danny paid up and took the pizza. He hurried upstairs after setting the pizza down and quickly made the changes to the pizza delivery guy. He watched through the window as it seemed the pizza delivery guy stopped at the door of his car, gasped, and forced himself to keep going with the job. Even as his shirt started even from that distance getting quite visibly tight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey guys, pizza&#39;s here!&quot; Danny noted even after all that running around it seemed the two of them were more distracted by their changes so far. Both went out shirtless, Gabe swaggering and leading with his chest, and Terry apparently just got done styling his hair with one of the combs in the bathroom. It looked like those two were gonna be enjoying themselves tonight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, I&#39;m not gonna have much of this. Bodybuilder and all. So you two can have as much as you want!&quot; Danny said with a grin. He looked at Gabe and Terry, whose expressions could easily be read as showing glee at the thought. Not many parties gave them this much pizza and without the host taking a large share.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Danny, you&#39;re a solid guy! Thanks!&quot; Terry stated, and then started taking pieces for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks a million! Hopefully the pizza won&#39;t make me lose my abs...&quot; Gabe, all about his new precious belonging. Before long those two were eagerly bounding off to the kitchen to eat their pizza. Danny decided to give it some time before coming back in and see where things were then. In a week&#39;s time these two would be wholly transformed into a pair of Asian twinks...meaning he was gonna have a front row seat for the entirety of a slow transformation that would take these guys from their vaunted position of swole authority and put them in another part of the totem pole of high school life altogether.<br />
<br />
As Danny left to go do his workouts and have his scant few pieces of pizza, he eagerly anticipated what was to come next...</p>
