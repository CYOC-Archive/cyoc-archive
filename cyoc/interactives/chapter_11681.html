<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Peter sat at his desk looking over his Chemistry and Physics notes from school. It was finals week, and both he and Ty had exams to study for. It was quiet in the room, until the door opened and a young boy walked in. Peter turned around and was startled, for he didn’t recognize the boy at first.<br />
<br />
“Hey Peter, you got to help me…” the little boy said, with a sad look on his face. Suddenly Peter realized that it was Dustin, but he looked like he was ten years younger, for he was just like a little, eight year-old boy!<br />
<br />
“Dustin? What happened to you?” Peter wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“Ty’s feeling a bit nervous again. I was walking by his room and I disturbed him, and he turned around and changed me into a little kid. He’s just very irritable these days…” the boy replied.<br />
<br />
“Of course! He hasn’t done any studying all semester long, and now that it’s finals week, and he’s frustrated. The same thing happened last semester, too. Just stay away from Ty this week, Dustin. I know you’re an easy target for him…” Peter replied.<br />
<br />
“I just want him to leave me alone, Peter! Can you grow me back again?” Dustin asked.<br />
<br />
Peter just stood up and walked over to the little boy. Then he used his power on him, and Dustin slowly started growing back again to his normal, eighteen year-old self again. Dustin grew taller and taller, his muscles expanded again, and his face changed from that of a kid to that of an adult. He gained hair on his chest, arms and legs again, and he was now standing 6 foot and 1 inch in height, just like he was before.<br />
<br />
“There! You’re good as new again!” Peter chuckled, while looking down on the older Dustin. Peter was still 2 inches taller than him, but Dustin didn’t need to worry about Peter doing anything to him for they were almost like brothers.<br />
<br />
“Peter, it’s on days like this that I’m so happy that you’re here. At least you can match Ty’s power, and therefore he leaves you alone. I just wish he would leave me alone once in awhile too, you know?” Dustin said to him.<br />
<br />
“I can arrange that!” Peter replied. “How about we just swap bodies for a few days?” Dustin thought about it for a few moments.<br />
<br />
“Sure, or let’s just swap while we’re here at home, since I have to go to work and you need to take the exams at school!” Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
Peter grabbed hold of Dustin’s shoulders and they both closed their eyes. Three seconds later, they opened their eyes again, and they realized that they were now in the other person’s body.<br />
<br />
“Alright! I look just like you!” Dustin said, while looking over Peter’s body. “Ty won’t mess with me now!”<br />
<br />
“Well, I guess I’ll be Ty’s foster brother for a change” Peter replied, as he was now in Dustin’s body.<br />
<br />
Dustin went down to the kitchen while Peter stayed in his room. About thirty minutes went by, when Ty got out of his room, and he walked on down to the kitchen. There he saw Peter, as he was cooking dinner.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing down here, Peter?” Ty wondered. “Normally, you never cook dinner!”<br />
<br />
“Oh well, I guess I wanted to try it for a change” Dustin said, chuckling at the fact that he had fooled his foster brother this time. Ty turned around and walked back up the stairs, wondering why Peter had finally decided to prepare dinner instead of Dustin.<br />
<br />
Then he walked past Dustin’s room, and there was nobody there. He then looked in Peter’s room, and he saw Dustin sitting at Peter’s desk.<br />
<br />
“How come you’re studying in Peter’s room, while Peter is downstairs preparing dinner?” Ty asked Dustin, who was sitting at the desk.<br />
<br />
“Well…. He wanted to prepare dinner, and this room is quieter. So he let me study in this room!” Peter replied, but while he was still in Dustin’s body.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… Weird…” Ty mumbled to himself, as he turned around and walked back into his room. But then he got up and walked back into Peter’s room.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Didn’t I turn you into a little kid?” Ty asked him. Peter just shrugged.<br />
<br />
“Who grew you back to how you were? Did Peter do that?” Ty wondered out loud. Peter just stood there and smiled, which irritated Ty tremendously.<br />
<br />
“Well, I still want you to be a little kid! So I want you to grow back into a little five year-old, Dustin!” Ty said. Peter (in Dustin’s body) immediately began to shrink, losing height almost immediately. His face became more round, and he became short and chubby. His jeans and t-shirt were now much too big on him, as the 6 foot teen was now reduced to a three-foot tall little kid, with short brown hair and big, blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“There! Much better, huh? Little guy?” Ty said, as he admired his handiwork. But Peter just stood there and grinned, instead of protesting out loud, the way Dustin normally does.<br />
<br />
Ty wondered why Dustin didn’t complain and he just walked back into his room. In the meantime, Peter just walked on over to Dustin’s room, where there was a large mirror that was hanging from the wall. There, Peter started to grow back again, and within moments he found himself staring at the reflection of the eighteen year-old Dustin once again. “Time to have some fun with my foster brother” Peter chuckled to himself. “It’s time for some payback and some power!”<br />
<br />
Peter casually strolled back through the hallway, where Ty’s bedroom door was standing wide open. He immediately turned around and was astonished when he saw Dustin walking by. Didn’t he change Dustin into a little kid, just moments ago?<br />
<br />
Ty decided to find out what’s going on, and he followed Dustin into the kitchen, where he saw Peter preparing dinner.<br />
<br />
“Wait a doggone minute! There’s something fishy going on here!” Ty yelled at Peter and Dustin. “What’s the deal with Peter preparing dinner, and Dustin studying in Peter’s room? And how come Dustin is able to grow back every time I turn him into a little kid?”<br />
<br />
Both Dustin and Peter began to laugh, as Ty was left standing there, feeling more confused than ever.<br />
<br />
“I told you, Dustin that you had to stay as a little kid today so that you could be quieter while I’m studying for my finals!” Ty shouted. <br />
<br />
Immediately Peter (still in Dustin’s body) began to regress once more, and he rapidly began to shrink until he was a little kid, just moments later.<br />
<br />
As soon as Peter looked like a little kid, he started to grow back again! Ty was astonished when he saw how easily Dustin was able to grow right back into his normal, eighteen year-old self again!<br />
<br />
“What the heck?” Ty said, as he saw his foster brother regress to a little guy and then grow right back into his eighteen year-old self within three minutes.<br />
<br />
“I guess it’s your turn to shrink, Ty” Peter said out loud. <br />
<br />
“What? But how is that possible? Dustin doesn’t have any powers!” Ty shouted back.<br />
<br />
Ty immediately began to shrink, and within moments the fifteen year-old teen was turned into a little five year-old kid, who was wearing clothes which were much too big on him.<br />
<br />
“What is this? What’s going on here?” Ty wondered out loud.<br />
<br />
“We swapped bodies, Ty!” Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
“We did this so that we could teach you a lesson!” Peter added, as both Peter and Dustin were now laughing at the little boy, who was now a younger version of Ty.<br />
<br />
“Oh…” Ty said, as he began to feel ashamed about how he’s been acting towards Dustin.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry… I’ve been acting like such a jerk to you guys, this past week…” Ty said, with his head bowed.<br />
<br />
“It’s alright, dude. I guess we can swap back again…” Dustin said. Then Dustin and Peter turned facing towards each other, and Peter placed his hands on Dustin’s shoulders. They both closed their eyes, and opened them again, about five seconds later.<br />
<br />
“That was a cool body swap, Peter!” Dustin said to Peter. “We should do this more often!”<br />
<br />
Peter and Dustin told Ty not to worry about it, since they realized that Ty was feeling a bit anxious about his final exams. But both Peter and Dustin agreed that they really had Ty fooled for once, thanks to their body swap!</p>
