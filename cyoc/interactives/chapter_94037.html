<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Red faced John dressed quickly while listening to the crowd around him giggling and taunting. He grabbed his boy by the hand and quickly walked away from the hypnotist show. His wife followed. <br />
<br />
A few teenaged girls whistled as John walked by making comments about his endowment.  John did his best to ignore them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to sue that man and this carnival for everything they have!&quot; he said loudly to his wife. He purposely wanted the people around to hear.<br />
<br />
His wife tried to calm him down saying it was all in fun but John was furious.<br />
<br />
A few children Ben&#39;s age had followed them out and started chanting &quot;We saw you naked. We saw you naked!&quot; <br />
<br />
John cringed and told his family that they were leaving the park immediately. <br />
<br />
Ben complained that he really wanted to see some animals and they never get to go anywhere fun. John told him to be quiet or he would get a spanking, Ben lowered his head and was quiet.<br />
<br />
Even John&#39;s wife tried to convince him they could just stay for an hour so Ben could have some fun but John refused.<br />
<br />
A few people from the show who were around were overhearing and a teenaged boy shouted, &quot;come on Ben, don&#39;t let your Dad, ruin your fun.. Make him a dog!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea Ben&quot;, shouted another, &quot;Just say the magic word,&quot;<br />
<br />
A few others joined in. Some other adults came by wondering if maybe the entertainment hadn&#39;t ended&quot;<br />
<br />
Ben looked around at the gathering group and then at his Dad. &quot;Come on Dad&quot;, he tried again, &quot; that man did say i can make you act like a Dog if I want  but I won&#39;t. Could we just stay for a while.. Please..&quot; <br />
<br />
John was getting furious and maybe a little scared as he glanced around at the faces looking. He lowered his voice and in explained in no uncertain terms that he was in charge and Ben had better not argue with him for one more second.<br />
<br />
Ben, encouraged by the crowd snapped back &quot;Well maybe I&#39;ll do it then!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you Dare!&quot; his furious father shouted. The crowd hushed now watching this new show.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we should go.&quot; Ben&#39;s defeated Mom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rex!&quot; shouted Ben.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no! &quot; John started to say as a shocked look came to his face.&quot; No! &quot;, he repeated as he reached for his shirt and instead of unbuttoning it, he just ripped it off. His muscular chest was again on display and those girls whistled.<br />
<br />
With all his might he fought doing it. He cringed and trembled as he moved but he kicked off his shoes and socks and his hands fumbled for the fly of his Jeans and down they came. He looked around at the faces now all starting to smile and laugh. He tried to tell them to &quot;fuck off&quot; but all that came out was a bark. The crowd laughed more.<br />
<br />
Ben smiled; &quot;I warned you Dady&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
John danced on one foot then the other pulling off his socks then with one hand trying to cover his junk he ripped off his boxers with the other. <br />
<br />
He now stood there totally nude in public trying desparately to cover himself. He was scarlet with embarrassment. For an instant he stood slightly crouched with both hands clutching his junk and then with a whine, which sounded more canine then human, he seem to lose his balance and he fell onto all fours.<br />
<br />
John now stood bare assed naked all on all fours staring up at his son and then looked around at all the laughing people. He whined again pathetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh My&quot; his wife said as she covered her mouth but she didn&#39;t seem very upset. <br />
<br />
John however was still blushing beat red.<br />
<br />
Good boy Ben said as he patted his fathers head. &quot;Now sit!&quot; he commanded John now crouched back on his haunches. He hated how this squatting position spread his naked ass cheeks and his hairy balls hung down freely swinging between his legs. John wondered if people behind him could see but there was nothing he could do about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now beg&quot; Ben said.<br />
<br />
John now put up both hands up in the air like a dog begging as he remained squatting. There was more giggling and whistling from the bystanders as Johns package was totally displayed.<br />
<br />
Ben clearly didn&#39;t understand how inappropriate it was for a grown man to be so exposing himself like this and didn&#39;t notice the lewd stares as the man&#39;s dick and balls flopped around exposed to all.<br />
<br />
Again John tried to talk and tell Ben to stop this, but all he could do was bark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, Rex, we are going to go walkies around the carnival for a while and if you are a good doggy, I will make you normal. But you better behave or I will keep you like this&quot;<br />
<br />
John fell back on all fours and wondered if his shame could be any worse.</p>
