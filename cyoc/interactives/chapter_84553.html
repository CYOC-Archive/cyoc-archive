<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was nearly an hour later when everyone slowly came out of the lust that went along with the transformation orgy calmed down. It left me seated on Sara&#39;s bed with Sara and Clarissa sitting on either side of me and the other four cheerleaders were seated or laying on the floor. Everyone was naked, but thankfully everyone was also &quot;spent&quot; for the moment.There was also a bit of surprise, particularly on Sara and the other four.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I take it your wolf finally came out,&quot; I said to Clarissa, sort of stating the obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Clarissa said weakly, &quot;I didn&#39;t want it to... at least not in a situation like this... I take it my mom made the offer to make you the Pack&#39;s Alpha Male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually MY mom made the offer,&quot; I corrected, &quot;but as you could see, I obviously took it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... wait... you&#39;re werewolves?&quot; one of the four on the floor asked to Clarissa and I, I didn&#39;t know all the cheerleaders that well, but I think her name was Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;And so are you now,&quot; Clarissa said weakly, sounding rather embarrassed, &quot;Sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did someone bite you?&quot; Sara asked her, and turned to me, &quot;Did someone bite you, Joe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually born as a werewolf,&quot; Clarissa said slowly, &quot;but werewolf pups don&#39;t transform until they begin to mature. Once I hit puberty at thirteen I could feel the wolf in me beginning to come out... and it finally did come out earlier today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What brought it out?&quot; I asked, deciding to play the role of Alpha Male, though I really didn&#39;t know what a Alpha Male werewolf would do.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d made the wish to be able to have sex with my mother&#39;s sexy friends, and now I would likely have to carry out what would be expected from an Alpha Male. The wish was quickly meaning I would need to do more work, though the sight of Clarissa and Sara sitting there naked, their breasts sitting there uncovered, large, soft but yet firm, and the fact that I DID get to have unimaginably hot sex with my mother&#39;s friends made me quite willing to put up with the any responsibility.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...we were going over what routine to do for next week&#39;s football game,&quot; Clarissa admitted, &quot;and well, we were talking over what to do the topic conversation turned to boys...&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced over to Clarissa as she looked down.<br />
<br />
&quot;And well, Sara was talking about how well you two were getting on... and well... I knew my mother wanted you to take me as your mate and be the Pack&#39;s Alpha Male and the mention of you made me start fantasizing and well,&quot; Clarissa admitted, &quot;I finally changed for the first time. Thankfully I was too aroused to be violent...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And she had her way with all of us,&quot; another one of the four cheerleaders finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then we started changing... getting hornier and hornier and...&quot; Tiffany said slowly, and I caught some scent of arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there,&quot; I urged, &quot;If you get aroused again, we&#39;ll all end up changing again...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d have to admit, I&#39;ve never felt anything like that,&quot; Sara commented slowly, &quot;though I thought werewolves transformed under the full moon...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a myth, purely a myth,&quot; Clarissa answered, &quot;We can transform whenever we want... though arousal is the trigger. When we get horny we change and then we mate, preferably with the pack&#39;s Alpha Male, but any other pack member that is there will do... and we generally need to mate with every other werewolf there before we can change back... and in my case, I was so horny that anyone would do... and when you all lapped up my cum you began to change and pushed it on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you didn&#39;t want to infect us?&quot; the third cheerleader asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... a part of me actually did want to, you, Sara, Tiffany, Jennifer, and Laura are all my friends and the rest of the Pack are my mother, Joe&#39;s mother, and their seven friends in their little support group for divorced women,&quot; Clarissa admitted, unable to look the cheerleader who had spoke in the eye, &quot;and while they are all attractive women... they aren&#39;t my age. Even as I felt my wolf coming out, I knew I wanted wolves my own age to be with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clarissa then looked to me, &quot;I&#39;ts probably why my mom wanted us to be mates. We&#39;d then control each other&#39;s lusts. Though her plan hit a bit of a snag... though I don&#39;t think anyone of us could have predicted when exactly I would change for the first time... and to be honest, I don&#39;t entirely think even the adults in the Pack really practice that much self control... I actually think Mrs. Gabrielli commonly asks for Pack meetings as an excuse to have a wolf orgy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; Tiffany said slowly, &quot;Mrs. Gabrielli... the Italian with the big...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the one,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... were you born a werewolf too?&quot; Sara asked me.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I admitted, &quot;My mom didn&#39;t meet Clarissa&#39;s mom until after I was born. She and the Pack though have been looking for an Alpha Male to lead them, and my mom suggested that  I take on the role...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He certainly filled out the role,&quot; Laura commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you...?&quot; Sara asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;They really didn&#39;t give me much choice over whether or not I had sex with them,&quot; I answered, &quot;Once I accepted it... a lot of sex followed... and given that I arrived to find you eating out Clarissa, I don&#39;t think you can really complain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sara shrugged, &quot;and suppose.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what is this about mates?&quot;  Jennifer asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sex that we all just had is simple Pack bonding,&quot; Clarissa commented, &quot;It ties us together and shows mutual support... but a Pack can only have one Alpha Male and he must take a mate as his Alpha Female and keep the Pack growing through having babies with that Alpha Female...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though within the Pack... I can rearrange the rules to allow for multiple mates, and uh... well, Clarissa, your mother did explain her reasons and I did want to help so that way you...&quot; I began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say it, so that I didn&#39;t fuck it up,&quot; Clarissa sighed. She actually sounded a little ashamed of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t quite put it that way,&quot; I told her, placing a hand on her shoulder, &quot;and I will admit that I have found you beautiful, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still loyal to Sara,&quot; Clarissa finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes... but...&quot; I began.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want both of us as your mates,&quot; Sara then cut me off.<br />
<br />
I sheepishly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Typical boy,&quot; the first cheerleader laughed.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t know how to answer that. It appeared that all of them were adapting and accepting this rather well, but then seeing Clarissa change didn&#39;t result in an attack. It resulted in sex, which had been extremely hot and heavy by the time I arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I don&#39;t know about you four, but this was definitely my first time... and likely was Clarissa&#39;s first time with someone other than herself... and, Joe... if you can do what we just did in the future, I won&#39;t mind,&quot; Sara said slowly, &quot;and Clarissa was surprisingly gentle... despite the fur, fangs, and six big...&quot;<br />
<br />
I began to smell Sara getting aroused again. She had to stop and take a deep breath to try and get herself under control.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll make that part easier,&quot; I shrugged after a moment, &quot;Though all of you will need to know that you cannot share that you&#39;re a werewolf with anyone... at least not unless the Pack is completely sure they won&#39;t either reveal us or raise a mob...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our boyfriends?&quot; Laura asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you remain together after high school and move to another town... you can take them as your mates and start new Packs,&quot; I spoke, &quot;but while you&#39;re here... I am the only Alpha Male and I don&#39;t want the pack destroyed by males fighting each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we still date them?&quot; Tiffany asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you don&#39;t have sex and don&#39;t get aroused around them,&quot; Clarissa answered, &quot;that was my mom&#39;s rule with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be the Pack&#39;s rule too,&quot; I agreed.<br />
<br />
There was a silence for a few moments. I sat their quietly and could hear my female classmates breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Sara asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I came to get you and take you back to meet the Pack and try to explain, which we will need to do as they should be expecting us to return... though I think they expected must me and you,&quot; I told her, &quot;I don&#39;t think Clarissa&#39;s mom knew about your cheerleader meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about our clothes?&quot; the first cheerleader asked, &quot;Clarissa either tore them off or we grew out of them as we changed...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we also ended up smashing a few things as well,&quot; Sara added.<br />
<br />
That made me sigh again. I had heard Clarissa and Sara having sex out on the font lawn of Sara&#39;s house. Sara&#39;s parents weren&#39;t home at the moment, but they could come home eventually, and even looking at Sarah&#39;s bedroom, we had made a mess of it and the entire room reeked of sex. Even a human nose would smell it. I knew I&#39;d have to use the ring, though I decided I&#39;d use it as a clean up device. No massive wishes that could potentially change the fabric of reality. I then held up the ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... earlier today I returned an old lady&#39;s purse and she gave me a magic ring as a reward,&quot; I explained, &quot;She said it would do for cleaning up messes, rearranging furniture or even changing furniture.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could it change people?&quot; the first cheerleader asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; I lied, but they all bought it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would some woman give you a magic ring that&#39;s only good for cleaning?&quot; the first cheerleader asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you seen his room?&quot; Sara teased, &quot;He could probably use something that would clean it for him. Lord knows HE&#39;D never do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I decided to let that go as it helped further along the lie that I had told.<br />
<br />
The other cheerleaders shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Tiffany sighed, &quot;Can&#39;t get any weirder...&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and said to the ring, &quot;I wish we were all dressed and that Sara&#39;s house was undamaged and unsoiled by all the sex we just had.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief flash of light, and when it faded, the room no longer reeked of sex, though I could smell Sara&#39;s, Clarissa&#39;s, Tiffany&#39;s, Jennifer&#39;s, Laura&#39;s, and Megan&#39;s, the first cheerleader, inner wolves within them and they could surely smell mine. We were all clothed in the clothes we&#39;d been wearing before transforming there, and all other physical signs of what had happened there were gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that worked well,&quot; Megan commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... though we do have to rendezvous with the others and Clarissa, you may need to be ready to explain things to your mother,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
Clarissa nodded. With that I got up to head out again.</p>
