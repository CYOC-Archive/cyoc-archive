<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day, there was a knock on the door.  Janice, the two girl&#39;s housekeeper/live-in caregiver answered the door.  She knocked on the doorway into Laura&#39;s office.  Laura was doing some research for a consulting job she had taken on- everything in her office was scaled down for someone of her size (well, sort of, she still needed to sit on an encyclopedia to see over her desk properly).  <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Janice?&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice, a woman in her early 30&#39;s, frowned.  &quot;I...I&#39;m not sure.  There&#39;s a girl here, and she wanted me to get you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell her to come in.&quot;  Laura felt better dealing with people face-to-face behind her desk; bad enough she was a cute little girl, but standing at her normal height put her on the back foot (and sitting in a booster seat made her feel ridiculous).<br />
<br />
Janice nodded and returned a few moments later with a preteen girl with very long chestnut colored hair that cascaded down her back like a wave of water.  The hair was tied back by a pink ribbon.  The girl was wearing a dress a few sizes too large for her, and she was barefoot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Laura, right?  I need to hurry this up, I don&#39;t have much time.&quot;  The girl spoke quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this about?&quot;  Laura wished Ronnie was home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, um, so, this is going to be hard to understand, but I don&#39;t have much time to explain.  This,&quot;  She gestured to a gold ring on her finger, &quot;gives me magic powers.  I used those powers on you and your daughter a few years back.  You don&#39;t really have STS, I did this to you.  I&#39;m sorry, and I want to make amends.  I wish you would believe me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura was just about to scoff, when a wave of...something indescribable...washed over her, and she found what the girl was saying to be completely believable.  &quot;I...but why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;d been a nobody with no power all my life, and once I had the power...I lost control.  I&#39;m better now, but I did a lot of damage...I&#39;m trying to make up for that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Laura frowned.  Did that girl just..shrink, or was she going crazy?  &quot;Excuse me, but...I know this sounds crazy..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I shrinking?  Yes.  It&#39;s a long story, but my girlfriend came up with a way to keep me on a short leash.  She made me use the thing in a way I can&#39;t undo.  Basically, the longer I&#39;m away from her, the younger I get.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m a little short on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura couldn&#39;t help but smile.  &quot;And I&#39;m guessing you can&#39;t just leave.  So if I waste your time, how little will you get?&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl whined a little as she lost an inch of height.  &quot;Two and a half.&quot;  She looked about ready to burst into tears.  &quot;I  know me asking you for mercy is pointless, but please, I don&#39;t mind turning into a little girl, but I hate being that small.  Last time...I wet myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.  I should be a bitch about this, because thanks to you, I&#39;ve gone through that.  And more!  My own daughter had to give birth to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl whimpered as she lost another couple of inches, no doubt a growth spurt reversing itself.  It was fascinating to watch the girl dwindle, her clothing becoming looser and looser on her frame.<br />
<br />
But Laura could see the girl felt miserable, so she relented.  &quot;So how does this work, do you turn me back into an adult?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want.  Some people are happy about what happened to them, save for a minor detail here and there.  Just ask, and I&#39;ll do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was just talking about this with my daughter...say, what&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Teri.&quot;  Said the girl, who now looked about 9.<br />
<br />
&quot;Teri, that&#39;s a pretty name.  Well anyways, a lot of good has come from this, and growing up again...hasn&#39;t been too bad.  But why isn&#39;t Ronnie...my daughter...aging?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that.  Well, she&#39;ll start aging once you&#39;re both the same age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing.  So we&#39;ll end up being almost sisters.  Well..I wish she was here, so I could ask her what she thought, but here&#39;s what I want you to do...&quot;<br />
<br />
Some time later, Ronnie came in from her morning jog.   &quot;Hey Laura, I&#39;m home, gonna take a shower, ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here when you do, I have something interesting to tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Later, her hair still damp, a freshly showered Ronnie entered the office.  &quot;So what&#39;s up, Laura?&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura told her about her visitor.<br />
<br />
&quot;So wait, she said she could fix us?  But we&#39;re still the same!&quot;  Ronnie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know dear, I was just thinking- you really don&#39;t mind being 14, and I&#39;m willing to grow up.  But it&#39;s lonely being women with the bodies of children.  So I asked her for these.&quot;  She produced a pair of Hello Kitty watches.  &quot;She chose the appearance, but she looked barely 6, so I didn&#39;t complain, the poor thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Poor thing?  She turned you into a fetus!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granted, but I believed her when she said she felt terrible about it.  Anyways, these are special watches.&quot;  Laura put on her watch.  &quot;I wish I was three years old.&quot;  Laura shrank into a smaller toddler, her clothing now loose on her body.  &quot;See?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot;  Ronnie grabbed the other watch and put it on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, honey.  Remember if you get older, your clothes won&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;  Ronnie didn&#39;t miss a beat as she undressed right there.  &quot;Ok!  I wish I was 19!&quot;  Her body began to grow taller and she matured in front of Laura.  Her thighs widened, her rear end became more shapely, her face more mature looking, and her hair grew several inches.  Her breasts expanded as well, going from her girlish A cups to round, full C cups.  The process must have been very enjoyable, because Ronnie moaned softly, her hands going to her enlarging breasts.  &quot;Oh...wow...what do I look like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A gorgeous young woman.&quot;  Laura smiled as she returned to age 4.   &quot;But there&#39;s more.  I wish it was feeding time.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was an ache, but not a painful one in Ronnie&#39;s chest as her breasts expanded again, and she knew by the pressure she felt what had happened.  &quot;Oh...oh wow...they&#39;re full of milk!&quot;  She laughed and smiled at Laura.  &quot;You missed that, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.  Do you mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot;  Ronnie walked over to her mother and picked her up.  Laura giggled as she returned to infancy in her arms.  Settling down in another chair, Ronnie put the regressed woman to her breast and fed her.  She had missed the intimacy of the moment as well.<br />
<br />
Later, after Laura had drank her fill, she made herself older, but still small enough to sit in her &#39;mommy&#39;s&#39; lap comfortably.  &quot;Thank you, Ronnie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure.  So any other surprises?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one.  We can use the watches to go all the way, if we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the way...you mean...&quot;  Ronnie gestured to her tummy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep.  And the birth should be painless, from what Teri said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, wait, both of them do that?  So I could...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Laura smiled up at the young woman who was her daughter and her mother.  &quot;If you ever wanted, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hell, can we?  I want to know what it feels like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.  Oh and there&#39;s one more thing.  We can use them on Janice as well.  She&#39;s been so good to us, and I think she would enjoy having a few years shaved off her...or more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ronnie grinned as she suddenly shrank down to be the same age as Laura, leaving them both adorable little girls.  &quot;This is amazing.&quot;  She kissed Laura on the cheek.  &quot;Best present ever.  So...what do you want to do now?&quot;</p>
