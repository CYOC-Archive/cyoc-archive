<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the final bell of school rings; signaling the end of the day; Nate heads to his locker to collect a few items for his third detention of the week. Opening the locker he sees another love note stuffed in his locker.<br />
<br />
‘I Like How Your Werewolf Scent Makes Me Melt With Desire’<br />
<br />
 Nate putting the note in his bag; noticing it is in the same handwriting as the last, but this note had a faint smell of a sweet smelling perfume wafting from it.<br />
‘Well whoever she is,” Nate smiling while thinking to himself; ‘she knows I’m a were, and she must be one as well. Definitely has the hots for me.’<br />
Looking at his cell phone to see Jean texting him the address to her parent’s house and a simple message.<br />
‘It’s just a meet and greet over dinner. Dad won’t let us have fun afterwards. He needs me to help him with council matters tomorrow morning.’<br />
Nate smiles as he puts his phone away. Closing his locker he heads to his detention for an hour of being given the stink eye from some bored teacher.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Standing outside waiting for their ride; Eric, Frieda and Spencer were a little surprised to see snow falling on the ground.<br />
“And I thought we were supposed to get more rain,” Eric looking amused; “think there will be enough for a snowball fight later on?”<br />
“Weather can be fickle even here,” Frieda sticking out her tongue; trying to catch a snow flake.<br />
“If there is enough snow for a snowball fight,” Spencer commenting; “we should build a snowman instead.”<br />
“With pointy ears and a tail,” Eric giggling; “you don’t need one. You got me!”<br />
Frieda laughs; “not only that, your soft and warm and can make me and Spencer melt in pure bliss.”<br />
Eric purrs as he embraces both his lovers; “And you two are sweet. I could lap you up all night.”<br />
“Oooh,” Spencer sighs as she whispers in Eric’s ear; “now that’s something to try later on.”<br />
<br />
The three not caring as the snow falls on them while waiting for Frieda’s uncle to arrive. Eric begins humming and signing<br />
&#9835;I’ll stop the world and melt with you&#9835;<br />
Spencer laughs; “I’m more of a fan of Cure than Modern English.”<br />
“I’ll take the B-52’s and Talking Heads any day,” Frieda laughs.<br />
“What about Tears for Fears,” Eric grinning<br />
“It’s amazing how we know and like these eighties bands,” Spencer shaking her head; “when none of us were born in that decade.”<br />
“That decade had good music. KPXX plays lots of music from that era,” Frieda noticing her uncle’s car pulling up; “our ride is here.”<br />
<br />
Eric, Frieda and Spencer each get in the Prius. With Frieda in the front seat and Eric and Spencer in the back seat.<br />
“Well it’s really started to snow now,” Lance making small talk as he pulls out of the school parking lot; “what do you say we get a bite to eat?”<br />
“As long as it nothing big Uncle,” Frieda answers; “Eric’s mother has rack of lamb for supper.”<br />
“Ahh,” Lance chuckling; “guess we could forgo heading to The Diner and having something big. What do you say to some vending machine pop and chips at the gazette?”<br />
“Frieda and I were snaking on that,” Eric grinning; “while in the library for the afternoon.”<br />
“Why were you in the library instead of in class,” Lance asking?<br />
<br />
Both Eric and Frieda show Lance the scrolls they received form Rachael Gaudet; the were-otter rep of the elder council. “Principal Andrews was there when we were handed these,” Frieda being the first to speak; “and we know of Julie Stovall getting off of her assault charges do to a technicality. It spread like wildfire when it hit social media.”<br />
“Well that’s one less thing to discuss,” Lance sighing; “But we still need to talk regarding last night and a few other matters that cropped up.”<br />
“What’s to talk about last night,” Frieda asking; “apart from Liz Baker causing a scene, nothing bad happened.”<br />
“It’s about you and your future with Eric and Spencer here,” Lance stating.<br />
“Ahh,” Frieda rolling her eyes; “so you are going to have a go at beating this dead horse now.”<br />
“What,” Lance looking agog; “no nothing like that. And if you recall I was there in the hospital as your parent’s finally relented to this relationship you three now share. Dammed if I understand it though.”<br />
“Then what is it you want to talk about,” Frieda sighing.<br />
“What do you intend to do career wise after high school and college?”<br />
“Uncle,” Frieda sighs; “I don’t know just yet. Think you can ask me this in a few years’ time?”<br />
“You know Benton is going to badger you about this,” Lance answering; “he wants you to one day take over his company.”<br />
“If father is expecting me to do that when I turn eighteen or when I finally take the seat you are currently filling on the elder council,” Frieda answering; “then he is living in a fantasy world. If and when I do decide to assume the mantle leadership with Knight Industries, it will be when I am ready.”<br />
<br />
“And what about you two,” Lance asking Eric and Spencer; “do you have plans after high school, other than rutting with each other like crazy?”<br />
“Something with the sciences,” Eric answering; “not quite sure at the moment, in which direction that will take.”<br />
“I might do a few years in the military,” Spencer shrugging her shoulders; “I know my dad wouldn’t object to that career path.”<br />
<br />
Lance just sighs as he pulls up to the Anderson house hold, while he was hoping to talk more; the rest he had to say did was for Frieda&#39;s ears only. Lance just sighs as he decides to discuss the remainder of what he wanted tomorrow in private with his niece. Looking at the three as they are about to leave.<br />
“Before you go inside,” Lance speaking up; ”you should know the elder council intends to stay in session as long as it takes to resolve the matter regarding Julie Stovall. Eric, Frieda, you may be excused from school tomorrow, but that in no way means you should stay up late. You need to be at the council building tomorrow at roughly the same time school starts.”<br />
“Will you be picking us up uncle,” Frieda asking; “also will we be required to stay there for the entire duration?”<br />
“Of course I’ll pick you two up,” Lance answering; “just remember to need to be in your fursona when in front of the council. Don’t worry about needing robes, they will be provided for you tommorow. As for having to stay for the entire session, I’ll talk to Tachibana about that tomorrow morning.”<br />
“Why not tonight,” Eric asks?<br />
“I have my bi-polar testing to do,” Lance answering; “plus I have to head over to the gazette and deal with tomorrow’s edition.”<br />
“Will we wake up to hearing DJ Woof on the radio,” Frieda asking?<br />
“No,” Lance answering; “just so you know, I had to spend my entire morning at KPXX dealing with him and a few other issues that I wasn’t made aware of. DJ Woof will not be on the air anymore. I had him fired.”<br />
“Good riddance,” Spencer speaking up; “that knob was getting on my nerves.”<br />
“You and most of the town’s were population,” Lance answering; “now get going you three. We’ll talk more tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Lance watches as Eric, Spencer and Frieda leave his car into a snowfall that won’t let up. Seeing his niece’s overnight bag that Benton handed to him, Lance races out of the car.<br />
“Frieda wait up,” Lance shouting; “your father wanted me to give this to you.”<br />
Frieda looking at the bag just scowls; it’s the clothes that Benton picked out for her overnight bag for her bi-polar testing last Monday.<br />
“You’ll be spending most of your time tomorrow in your fursona,” Lance looking at his niece; “but there is a Ziploc bag with a few of your were-birth control pills in it.”<br />
“I see them,” Frieda looking at the bag; “I guess that is the most important item to have.” Looking at her Uncle, “I’ll see you tomorrow.”<br />
“Don’t stay up too late,” Lance grinning as he watches his niece rejoin Eric and Spencer as they head inside.</p>
