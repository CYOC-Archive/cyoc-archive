<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mardi Gras generally wasn&#39;t something that Heiya Island celebrated, as only a small portion of the island&#39;s population was even Christian and thus had the potential to want to partake in the celebration. Most of the people, Human or Animalian were not Christian and thus didn&#39;t celebrate it at all in their normal day to day lives. Add in that Mardi Gras also arrived on a Tuesday and Heiya Island&#39;s school, Samurai Prep, was in session. However, with Mardi Gras this year coming after the Year of the Tiger competition ending, there was a fair amount of interest in turning Mardi Gras into a celebration into one celebrating Tuxing&#39;s win in the competition.<br />
<br />
While this all meant for a rather quiet day with very little action or celebration, at least when compared to celebrations in New Orleans or Brazil, it did ultimately mean for some celebrations after the sun went down there came the formal announcement of Tuxing&#39;s win in the race against Liao and then claiming the title for Ms. Year of the Tiger. It was something that brought most of Heiya Island&#39;s residents out to the streets outside of colony&#39;s administration building where Ami came out to stand with a small microphone to speak to the gathered crowd. Among the crowd with their camera phones were the Quasi-Raccoon Cuties with their camera phones to catch the celebrations. A lot of their plans related to all capturing Ami&#39;s announcement and then seeing who had the best shot. The best shot would then be the intro that they posted. From there, they would then chat with some of the others and see what their responses would be. Those responses would then be uploaded following the intro.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope everyone had a good March first,&quot; Ami spoke clearly as she looked to the gathered, &quot;as many of you know, we have entered a new Lunar Year and in the Chinese Zodiac, this year is the Year of the Tiger. That has also meant two of our residents have been competing for the crown. Coming into the last event, the student Liao had a slight lead over Shelly and the master Tuxing. Some of you may already know through the Animalia Ambassadoria website for its live coverage, but for those of you who did not know, the teacher, Tuxing won the &quot;mountain&quot; race and thus claimed the crown of Ms. Year of the Tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was pause before a set of large lamps powered up and then projected light onto the various buildings around that area, including the Chinese and Japanese embassy buildings, the main colony government building, and even the parts of the airport that were close buy. It lit up the ground areas a paper cutout with Tuxing&#39;s stripe markings was then put over the light and essentially then allowing Tuxing&#39;s stripes to be projected for all to see. It wasn&#39;t long before a series of cheers then rose from the crowd and that included the repetition of Tuxing&#39;s name and a couple calling out &quot;Master Tigress!&quot; From there more purple, green, and gold fireworks, and among the crowd the Quasi Raccoon Cuties were there to cover the reactions.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think on the announcement?&quot; Tani asked to the three that were there that likely had the most interest in the results, Huoxing, Muxing, and Jinxing.<br />
<br />
“We’re all happy to Tuxing,” Huoxing said to the other Red Panda Animalian, “it’d represent a line of tradition… Shuixing and Nate won it last year and now Tuxing won it.”<br />
<br />
“Tradition?” Tani wondered.<br />
<br />
“Ignore that part,” Muxing grumbled with a look to Huoxing, “Huoxing is just excited.”<br />
<br />
“Aren’t you?” Tani asked back.<br />
<br />
“I am happy, Tuxing won,” Muxing answered, “that doesn’t mean I need to be hopping up and down.”<br />
<br />
“You can’t do that without legs,” Huoxing teased.<br />
<br />
Muxing only rolled her head in minor irritation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I must ask though...&quot; Tani then moved to finish, &quot;it would seem a bit odd that Tuxing and Liao are not with you, or Nate and Shuixing, for that matter. Are they okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re fine,&quot; Jinxing gave a smile, &quot;though it would appear that they just had some things come up that&#39;s kept them in Lyre/Animalia for a little while. My guess is just celebrating Mardi Gras there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t Tuxing want to be here for the fireworks?&quot; Tani asked.<br />
<br />
Huoxing and Jinxing shared a few looks before Jinxing said, &quot;I believe our sister might be more embarrassed by everyone chanting her name than anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elsewhere among the crowd, Date had maneuvered through the crowd and noted that there were a fair number Samauri Prep students there. It made some sense, in that while it was a school night, it wasn&#39;t late and from some things that the Racoon Dog Animalian had heard, students were following the events when they had time during school. Shi eventually came across two that were absorbed in looking at the fireworks than the cheers for Tuxing&#39;s win in the year of the Tiger Competition. One was a Guinea Pig Animalian who seemed rather excited and happy at seeing all the bright lights as the fireworks burst overhead. The other was a Human who looked a big shyer than her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is fun,&quot; GP commented as she looked up in awe at the fireworks, &quot;this is what Americans celebrate with this? Fireworks?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I think the origin in America relates more to Christian religion and relating to Lent or something like that,&quot; Date admitted, shrugging hir shoulders, &quot;and I&#39;ve seen something that not even every Christian truly follows it for religious reasons. So, for many Americans, it just becomes an excuse to party.&quot;<br />
<br />
Indira said nothing, but GP placed an arm around Indira&#39;s shoulders and smiled to the herm Raccoon Dog Animalian, &quot;well, if it becomes just an excuse to party, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. The fireworks are pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what about the announcement?&quot; Date asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were hoping Liao would win,&quot; GP answered, her smile dropping a little, &quot;but the race looked close online.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully she had fun,&quot; Indira said softly, though just enough for Date&#39;s phone to pick it up.<br />
<br />
The Ringtail Animalian, Naya meanwhile found herself talking with a well-muscled and dark furred male Wolf Animalian and his wife, an almost equally well muscled she-wolf. They were polite, and Nya thought the male often worked with Ami on some things with the colony&#39;s government, but their names escaped her for the moment, and she didn&#39;t want to reveal anything that would escape that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what do you think of all this?&quot; Naya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the colors are pretty,&quot; the female said with a polite smile, &quot;and I&#39;m sure the Elements will be happy that Tuxing won the Year of the Tiger contest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, I&#39;d think it might be better not to call this Mardi Gras,&quot; the male commented, &quot;as... I may not be familiar with American culture, but it would seem that this is more to celebrate Tuxing&#39;s win in the Year of the Tiger competition. And that&#39;s fine... I like that celebration, but maybe we could use a name more original and focused on that rather than stealing an American&#39;s holiday. Like... the Lunar New Year Victory Celebration... something like that.&quot;</p>
