<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat, “Kenna” and Ben the “dog” soon arrive at the park and head straight for the area where all the local dogs meet to play.<br />
<br />
As they approach, and Ben spots all the dogs, his butt wriggles wildly, “MISTRESS, PLEASE! CAN I GO PLAY,” he shouts out of excitement, pulling at the leash.<br />
<br />
Kat chuckles, “whoa, calm down, Ben,” she says, “yes, you can go play, let me get the leash off of the collar first. Sit!”<br />
<br />
Ben sits and Kat unfastens the leash from the collar, “alright, Ben,” she says, grinning, “go and make some friends. Don’t worry, Kenna and I will be right here”.<br />
<br />
“Okay, mistress,” Ben says, and immediately runs towards the other dogs and starts to sniff at some dog butts as some dogs sniff at his, soon Ben is wrestling and playing with all the other dogs.<br />
<br />
Kat watches Ben, grinning to herself, “your brother sure is in his element,” she says, turning to Ken, “he’s pretty good at pretending being a dog, he even seems to convince all the people, no one seems to be bothered that he is just a naked 10-year-old boy!”<br />
<br />
Ken nods his head, “yeah, he’s really good at it,” he says.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “but you are great in pretending being a girl yourself,” she says.<br />
<br />
Ken shrugs, “I mean… it’s not difficult, pretending to be a girl, I mean,” he says, “I have long hair, and my body has a kind of girl-like shape to it”.<br />
<br />
“And even though you are a straight boy, you seem to enjoy pretending being a girl,” Kat says, as they spread the blanket on the grass and start taking food out of the basket.<br />
<br />
Ken shrugs, “it’s just a silly game, but it is a lot of fun,” he says, “I must admit, this is my first time outside the house dressed as a girl. I was nervous at first, but now I feel more relaxed and less afraid that someone might figure out that I am a boy”.<br />
<br />
Kat grins, “yeah, you are doing a fantastic job, Kenna,” she says, gigging, “and once you get your ears pierced, you’ll be even more convincing”.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “I can’t help but feel excited getting my ears pierced”, he says, “I mean, I’m a boy, boys usually don’t wear earrings!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, there are a few boys and even men who wear earrings,” Kat says, “so, it’s nothing weird for you to also wear earrings”.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “you know, Kat,” he says, “you are doing a great job pretending to be my mom! Hehe… if I have to be honest: I think you are doing a far better job at it than our real mom!”<br />
<br />
Kat grins, “aaaw, thank you, sweety,” she says, “I’m having a lot of fun myself at this game!”<br />
<br />
“We ALL are having fun, mom,” Ken says, “look at Ben, he just can’t stop playing with the dogs. Myself, I am simply enjoying wearing girl clothes, and spending the morning with my “mom”, you!”<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “I’m glad you both are enjoying yourselves,” she says, “let’s eat and enjoy some time here, we still have the whole day to head into town to get your ears pierced, and Ben has to see the vets for a check up, vaccination and chipping”.<br />
<br />
Ken tilts his head, “don’t… don’t you think that is going a little to far,” he asks, “I mean… he is not really a dog, he is simply pretending”.<br />
<br />
“Well, I just want the game to be a little more realistic and convincing,” Kat says, “what’s the harm in doing something “outside of the box”?”<br />
<br />
Ken thinks for a while, he then shrugs, “well, you’re the “mom”, so I guess we’ll do as you say, plus… it does make sense what you are saying”.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “good that you understand, Kenna, you are a smart girl,” she then giggles when Ken blushes.<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks… mom,” he says.<br />
<br />
After a while Ben comes running over out of breath, panting hard, covered in dirt and mud, but with a huge smile on his face, “that was fun,” he says, wriggling his butt, “I made a lot of friends!”<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, patting the boy’s head, “I’m happy to hear that, Ben,” she says, “why don’t you get some rest? We’ll be heading into town soon, I’ll treat you to a nice dog-spa, get you all cleaned up, and after that we’ll head to the vets”.<br />
<br />
Ben tilts his head, “the vets,” he asks, “why do I need to go to the vets?”<br />
<br />
“Because, pup,” Kat says, “you are a dog, and dogs have to go to the vets to get checked on, to see if they are healthy. Besides, you need to get your shots, chipped and registered”.<br />
<br />
Ben doesn’t look to happy, “but… but I am not really a dog,” he says, “I… I’m just pretending!”<br />
<br />
“That is true,” Kat says, “but I the game will be more fun the more realistic it is”.<br />
<br />
Ben looks at Ken, who nods, “okay, mistress,” Ben then says, “if you think it’s okay, then I guess I’ll be okay with it”.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “good boy,” she says, this causes Ben to smile and wriggle his butt, feeling somehow proud.<br />
<br />
After packing up the stuff, Ben, “Kenna” and Kat head into town, first they visit a dog salon and Ben enjoys the bath. After the “spa”, they head to the vets, Kat fills out the form and they wait for the vet to call them in.<br />
<br />
“What a strange looking dog,” the vet says, “I never seen such a breed, let’s check him out and maybe we’ll be able to figure out what breed he is”.<br />
<br />
Ben climbs onto the table and the vet begins examining him, touching Ben everywhere, including his privates, the 10-year-old moans as his cock erects, the vet smiles, “at least we know that everything is working normal down there,” he says. Next he listens to Ben’s heart, takes some blood and takes Ben’s temperature.<br />
<br />
“So, doc,” Kat says, “any idea what breed he is?”<br />
<br />
“I’d say he’s a Malinois, which is a belgian shepherd,” the vet says, “I’d say he’s about a year old, and judging by what I see, he’ll make one fine breeder”.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “I like what I’m hearing,” she says.<br />
<br />
The vet smiles, “time to give him his shots,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ben gulps, but Kat soothes him by stroking over his head, “shh… it’ll be fine, Ben,” she says, “it’s just a little prick”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, but still feels nervous as he sees the syringe with the vaccine.<br />
<br />
The vet then takes one of Ben’s arms and the boy yelps as the needle penetrates his skin and feels the liquid being injected into his vein.<br />
<br />
“Well done, Ben,” Kat says, “good boy!”<br />
<br />
Ben feels a little dizzy, but also proud at the praise, “w-whoa… what is… in that st-stuff,” he asks, “I… I feel so dizzy!”<br />
<br />
“You’ll be fine in a few minutes, champ,” the vet says, patting Ben’s butt, “now to inject the chip”.<br />
<br />
Ben doesn’t really notice as the vet pinches the skin between his shoulder blades, the boy winces when he feels a second prick as a second needle penetrates his skin.<br />
<br />
The vet grabs a small white device and touches the area between the boy’s shoulders, the device giving off a peep, “the chip is activated and Ben is now officially registered in the system”.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “see, Ben,” she says, “wasn’t so bad, was it?”<br />
<br />
“I… I guess not,” the boy says, still feeling a little out of it, “so… now I am officially your dog, mistress?”<br />
<br />
Kat nods and smiles, “of course you are, Ben,” she says, “but only when we play this game of pretend”.<br />
<br />
Ben nods, “of course, mistress,” he says.<br />
<br />
After the vets, they head to a place to get Ken’s ears pierced, soon they emerge from the jeweler’s with Ken now wearing little diamond earrings in each ear, the boy smiling proudly, “thanks, mom,” he says, as they walk home.<br />
<br />
Kat smiles, “you are welcome, sweety,” she says, ‘hehe… it’s so fun messing with these two,’ she thinks to herself.</p>
