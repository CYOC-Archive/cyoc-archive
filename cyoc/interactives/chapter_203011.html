<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">End of the summer<br />
<br />
Spark sighed as she now gazed into the mirror inside her room. Their was no denying it anymore, she was certainly younger.<br />
<br />
After months of growing closer to Connor, the fairy was now much closer in physical appearance to Connor. Gazing over her body, the fairy noticed her waifish hips, smaller breasts, and round face. As crazy as it seemed she now looked closer to 15 than an adult. The idea of physically looking younger than both Gloria and Caleb was almost mind boggling.<br />
<br />
Still, this is what Spark had wanted. She had fallen hard for Connor and was now physically closer in appearance to him. Even better for Spark was the fact that she would get to stay at the Moreland home while Caleb went to college.<br />
<br />
It was a surprise when the Morelands had learned that their eldest son would be attending Providence with Gloria. Spark had a mixed reaction to this idea, liking the idea of checking out the college scene while also feeling sad about being separated from Connor. That all changed when Caleb gave her permission to stay behind.<br />
<br />
 Jacob and Nina would have their hands full. Despite a semi truce with the vampires, their were some rogue elements that remained. Couple that with Ninas pregnancy with twins (Jacob had cast Spark a dirty look when that became apparent. He felt she had jinxed it when she said something at the baby shower) and Connor would have his hands full. Spark would be needed here rather than college.<br />
<br />
While excited about having Connor all to herself, there was one drawback. Connor was only 13, meaning that any date the two had would have a chaperone. While that wasn&#39;t so bad with Caleb, it was a bit awkward with either Jacob or Nina. This is what led to Sparka brilliant idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how does this work again,&quot; Connor asked as he stared at a vial of purple liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its simple,&quot; Spark smirked. &quot;All you have to do is smash it and poof. Everyone will think your 15 instead of 13.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it will make me older and alter reality?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Make US older,&quot; Spark corrected. &quot;The spell connects us and no one will be the wiser. Besides, this way you only have to wait 6 months to get your license instead of 2 and a half years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know Spark,&quot; Connor mumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me eight grade is overrated,&quot; Spark said quickly. &quot;And Freshman year? Ugh pass. Do you really want to get picked on by giant seniors looking to stuff you in a locker?&quot; Connor shuddered, that wasn&#39;t very appealing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And besides,&quot; Spark smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be going to high school with you. Trust me, we&#39;ll absolutely own the Sophomore class this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Connor nodded, taking a breath as he now shattered the vial. Spark and Connor now coughed, blinded by a cloud of purple vapors. As the smoke began to clear, Spark quickly examined herself before smiling.<br />
<br />
It was a teenage her, at least a human version of her. A petite blond with small B cup breasts, waifish hips, and shoulder length green hair. While she could still assume fairy form, she would be spending alot of time as a human in the future. Admiring herself, Spark had to admit she was cute, in a teenage punky way. &quot;Not bad. How you doing Connor?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sparks jaw dropped as she now stared ata now 15 year old Connor. Obviously the young teen had gone through a growth spurt, standing around 5&#39;8&quot; instead of his usual 5&#39;2&quot;. It also appeared that his body was growing too, Spark noticing a decent amount of lean muscle on the teens body with a boyishly handsome face that was losing the roundness of childhood. Gawking at the handsome boy, Spark couldn&#39;t help but get excited at the prospect of dating an absolute teen hunk.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do I look,&quot; Connor asked.<br />
<br />
Spark grinned, planting a passionate kiss on her boyfriends lips. If she had to relive high school, she was definitely going to make the most of it.<br />
<br />

<br />
After watching Wyatt&#39;s ascension, Hannibal now took his leave. Making his way towards the rear of the mansion, Hannibal now walked towards the woods, awaiting Donovan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannibal turned, his face stoic as he gazed at Donovan. Despite Donovan&#39;s ability to resurrect he now sported a rather ugly scar that divided his face. &quot;Our new lord appears to be making quite the impression Donovan,&quot; he said. &quot;With Casssndra and Kyra by his side I feel he can lead us to prosperity. Especially considering the alliance he was able to broker with the liches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what of Ken and Ann?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Both are recovering from their injuries,&quot; Hannibal stated. &quot;It is only a matter of time before they return to full strength. Although I am interested to see who Wyatt chooses to replace Duncan as a member of the Five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which brings me to our next question,&quot; Donovan stated. &quot;What of our old master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannibal paused, gazing out at the blood moon in contemplation. &quot;Despite Lord Miro being vanquished we both know it is only a matter of time before he returns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what then,&quot; Donovan asked. &quot;When Miro returns do you believe he will try and usurp the throne from his adopted son?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannibal shrugged, unsure of what the future held. If and when Miro returned, the two old vampires would have to decide where the allegiance fell. &quot;Let us hope Miro does not return,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;I fear a civil war would destroy everything we have built.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Duke took a deep breath, letting out a contented sigh as he gazed out at the rural countryside before him. After a bit of digging, and a little help from his estranged half brother Wyatt, the damphir teen was finally able to find the gravestone of his mother. Looming at Sasha, he noticed her give him a warm smile as he now approached with a bouquet of flowers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey mom,&quot; he said quietly as he lay the flowers on the tombstone. &quot;Sorry I haven&#39;t visited. You know why though. Dad, well, Dad wouldn&#39;t exactly let me come.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke sighed, a smile forming on his face as Sasha squeezed his shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m doing great by the way,&quot; he continued. &quot;I&#39;ve made some great friends, really smart friends too and a demon hunter if you can believe it. He and his girlfriend are going to Providence for college if you can believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke sniffed, touching his mother headstone as he continued to talk. &quot;I finally made some friends mom just like you wanted,&quot; he said. &quot;I only wish they weren&#39;t going away. Naomi and Diane are going to art school in Massachusetts. Jackie is going to Cornell. Even Felicia and Adam are going far away. University of Michigan. I&#39;m going to miss Adam. I never met an athlete like him, especially one that treated me well and accepted me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So when you going to tell your Mom about me,&quot; Sasha smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Duke blushed. Squeezing Sasha&#39;s hand he now stood, squeezing her in a tight embrace. &quot;I want you to meet Sasha mom,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;We&#39;ve been dating for awhile. I think you&#39;d like her. In fact the two of us are staying at her house. Going to school and working. I&#39;m hoping one day to be a nurse or an EMT. Helping people, like you did mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Duke now bent over, placing a kiss on his mothers headstone as he took a step back. &quot;I promise I&#39;ll visit again soon mom,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I love you and I miss you. I hope wherever you are your watching...and your proud of the man I&#39;ve become.&quot; Turning to Sasha he now placed a gentle kiss on her lips as the two returned home, wondering what the future held for the two of them.</p>
