<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After leaving the garage, Paul sends a message to a mysterious figure: &quot;It&#39;s done. I gave that guy plenty to be distracted with. I&#39;m guessing he won&#39;t be continuing with putting his team together.&quot;<br />
&quot;Excellent, good work&quot; They reply. &quot;Keep an eye on things and make sure he won&#39;t cause us any troubles.&quot;<br />
<br />
John sat in his make-shift office, his mind racing. He had to figure out how to handle this situation. The interview was supposed to be about finding members for the community hero team, not getting a surprise dick enlargement. He had to admit, though, it was an experience he never thought he&#39;d have. He shifted in his chair, feeling the weight of his new cock head, and his mind began to wander to the possibilities. Maybe, just maybe, Paul was onto something.<br />
<br />
He decided to take a break from his thoughts and headed to the local gym. The gym was a place where he often found clarity, especially when he needed to work through problems. As he walked in, the regulars nodded at him, recognizing his consistent presence. He made his way to the locker room, feeling the stares of some of the other men as he passed. It was hard not to notice the bulge in his gym shorts.<br />
<br />
John took a deep breath and changed into his workout gear, trying to ignore the uncomfortable pressure of his enhanced package. He started with his usual routine, pushing the weights, sweating out his frustration. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror, and for a brief moment, he couldn&#39;t help but admire the new size. It was absurd, but there was a strange sort of power in it.<br />
<br />
As he moved from the weights to the treadmill, a group of young guys in the corner of the gym couldn&#39;t help but whisper and point. John&#39;s gym shorts had ridden up slightly, revealing a bit too much. He felt his face flush with embarrassment but pushed it aside, focusing on his run. He had to get his mind off of his dick and back on the team.<br />
<br />
The pounding of his feet on the treadmill helped to clear his thoughts. He began to think more strategically about how they could potentially use Paul&#39;s power. Maybe it could serve as a non-lethal takedown in certain scenarios. He chuckled to himself, thinking of the sheer shock on a criminal&#39;s face when their pants suddenly bulged out.<br />
<br />
As John ran, he felt a strange sensation growing within him. The constant movement was causing his enlarged cock head to bounce and smack against his thighs. It was oddly...stimulating. He tried to ignore it, but it was difficult. The gym&#39;s air conditioning didn&#39;t help either, making him feel even more aware of his aroused state.<br />
<br />
Determined to get his mind back on track, John decided to hit the showers. The cold water was just what he needed to calm down. As he walked into the locker room, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the glances of the other gym-goers. It was a mix of envy and confusion, but he brushed it off, heading straight for the showers.<br />
<br />
The water washed over him, the cold spray hitting his shoulders and running down his back. He closed his eyes and let out a sigh, the sound echoing off the tiles. He washed away the sweat and the day&#39;s events, trying to focus on what was important: the team. He knew he had to be careful about who he brought in. Superpowers could be unpredictable, and the last thing he wanted was for someone to get hurt.<br />
<br />
As John lathered up, he couldn&#39;t help but feel the weight of his new glans size. It was strange, but it also made him feel more... dominant. He had never been one to flaunt his body, but now he couldn&#39;t help but feel like he had something to be proud of. The water beaded on his chest and abs, trickling down to his enhanced groin. He couldn&#39;t ignore the fact that his cock was now the center of attention, even if it was only in his own mind.<br />
<br />
John took a deep breath and stepped out of the shower, wrapping a towel around his waist. He looked at himself in the mirror and made a decision. He would keep Paul&#39;s alteration a secret for now. He needed time to think, to figure out if this was something that could work for the team or if it was a liability.<br />
<br />
Drying off, he sent a text to Dave, his burly, hairy friend with super strength. &quot;Hey man, gotta hand over the team recruitment to you for a bit. Something&#39;s come up that I need to sort out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave responded almost immediately, &quot;No prob, buddy. What&#39;s the deal?&quot;<br />
John took a moment, considering how much to tell him. &quot;I&#39;ve got a... personal situation. Nothing serious, but I need to handle it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The lie felt heavy on his tongue, but he couldn&#39;t bring himself to explain the truth. Dave knew about John&#39;s telekinesis, but the last thing he needed was his friend visualizing his swollen cock head. Plus, the potential for embarrassment was too high.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I&#39;ve got it covered,&quot; Dave texted back, &quot;Monday it is.&quot;<br />
John breathed a sigh of relief, tucking his phone back into his locker. He quickly changed into his street clothes, the towel barely hiding his newfound endowment. The fabric clung to him like a second skin, broadcasting his condition to anyone who cared to look.</p>
