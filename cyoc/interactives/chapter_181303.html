<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She’d fucked Mason dry.<br />
<br />
There wasn’t a drop of cum left and whenever her lips brought his dick back to attention he just whined that it hurt. So much for getting what she wanted out of him? He’d lasted a lot longer than most guys but the weekend was hardly over and she wanted a bit more cum in her. It was what she lived for, if Mason couldn’t keep up that was his problem, Janette would just have to find it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
She was hydrating in the kitchen when one of Mason’s roommates returned, a fat smelly dweeb who looked exhausted from walking up the stairs. He stared at her, completely nude by the sink and blushed hard. A tenting appeared in his pants at the sight of her before he entered his bedroom and shut the door behind him. He was the dork with the computer and anime wall posters. No doubt her rocking figure would make him start jerking off, spilling his cum on some bedsheets or in a sock. Now that was a waste. If Mason couldn’t give her the fucking she wanted she’d have to get it elsewhere.<br />
<br />
That guy squealed in shock when she thrust his door open. True to her thoughts he’d stripped down and started jerking off to some anime crap. She didn’t bother shutting the door, she walked up to him and pressed her nude body against his. Her breasts pressing into his rolls of squishy fat.<br />
<br />
“Don’t go spilling that, I’m thirsty,” she purred before bending down and clamping her lips around his dick. The guy was in shock but she didn’t care. Cum was cum, it didn’t matter where it came from. By the time she was done with him that virginity would be long forgotten and he’d be spent too. Hopefully someone else showed up by that point.<br />
<br />
“W-who are you?” He groaned before filling her mouth with his seed. She drank it all happily and once he was hard again she pushed him back on the blankets.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t matter, you have what I want,” she told him before lowering herself down onto his dick. Sure it wasn’t as impressive as Mason’s but it was big enough. She rocked her hips on him while he blushed and moaned, so oblivious that she could guide everything. All this loser probably fucked on the regular was an anime body pillow. That made her laugh.<br />
<br />
As she thrust though, something strange started to happen. She suddenly felt lighter, weaker, as if everything under her skin was nothing but feathers. It was getting harder to rock up and down on this loser’s dick, in fact he was taking control.<br />
<br />
“What is?” She asked but didn’t get to finish, her mouth sealed shut and she felt a wave of panic. She stood up straight and watched as pale fabric began to spread from her skin, moving out from her arms and turning pure white. She stood there, trapped in a square of white fabric. She was... she’d become... she’d turned into a pillow. She was a life sized pillow. Her front visible and her back, two separate images printed on the pillowcase. She floundered for a few seconds before her limbs were pulled into a meek sexy pose, front and back, one side displaying her hot breasts and the other her beautiful backside. She felt more images of her form, empty pillowcases in the closet, one fully clothed and another in her underwear, then there was one in formal wear and another in a wintertime outfit.<br />
<br />
She couldn’t move, her entire body was an image, and that image began to simplify. Her colours becoming more uniform, her eyes becoming bigger, and her breasts and ass more stylized and bigger. She turned form an image to an illustration, an illustration of an anime girl version of herself, looking down on her owner Stewart lovingly. No! She’d just wanted his cum, not to be some weeb’s Waifu.<br />
<br />
She had no muscles so she flopped down on Stewart, he wrapped his legs around her and began to hump her pillow body. She was getting her wish. Cum stains formed on her pillowcase body, times Stewart had unloaded on this version of her. It was her bedroom dorm, the one no one but her owner saw.<br />
<br />
His humping got more and more rapid, Janette silently panicked before with a spurt cum splattered all over the part of her image where her breasts where. She would have loved that if she’d still been flesh but she was nothing but a pillowcase surrounding some virgin’s fuck pillow.<br />
<br />
“Oh Janette, that was wonderful,” her owner panted while she tried her best to move. She couldn’t move, she was just an object now. Cum slowly soaked into her breasts and all she could do was smile sexily at him. He gazed at her before turning her around where her ass lay. A devious smile spread across his face before he pressed his dick into her backside and started humping again like he was actually mounting her. Stupid virgin. No! This was her reality now! She was a fuck pillow in this form, a girlfriend in another, and a confidant in one of her other forms. She was now and object and he was her owner.</p>
