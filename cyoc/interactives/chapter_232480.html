<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Researching rare and extinct horse breeds was fun when writing this chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maggie was the first to awake from her blissful slumber. Dreaming of running in an endless field with the other foals along with Epona; the newest centaur filly got up on her hooves, effortlessly and with a smile as she examined her new lower equine half. True to what Epona said, that their forms in the dream would be what they wake up to; Maggie practically whinny in delight as her equine half had stripes like a Zebra; her mane and tail matching her natural red headed look, she couldn’t help herself but prance and trot in the room in celebration.<br />
“Wake up Cindy,” Maggie sliding a curtain open, to allow the sun light to fill the room. Maggie’s room mate and friend groaned as she wanted a few more minutes of sleep. Getting up to see Maggie’s exuberance soon infected her as she turned her torso to examine her equine half.<br />
<br />
“Akhal-Teke,” Cindy instinctively knowing the breed her new centaur frame is based on. Running a hand along her cream colored fur, she notices that her mane and tail dark in color stands in contrast to the shiny, metallic characteristic that the horse’s coat is known to have.<br />
“Your legs have dark fur,” Maggie chuckling; “like a permanent set of socks.”<br />
“I like the look,” Cindy taking a few steps; ginning at how confident she feels walking on hooves; “Lets wake up the rest!”<br />
<br />
It wasn’t long before Cassie, Beth, Eve and Kyra, were soon woken up with the giggling laughter from the two youngest fillies. As the they slowly left their room it was clear that Epona was continuing with the theme of diversity. Cassie who had her brunette hair in a pixie cut now had the lower half of an American Cream Draft Horse. Her champagne-cream-colored coat along with matching mane and tail made her a stunner, despite the fact that she was still by definition to the centaurs a yearling.<br />
<br />
Beth who had some Latino ancestry, looked at her new equine half and nickered as her tanned skin transitioned into a coat of charcoal black fur. Typical for a Dales Pony; her mane and tail taking on the same color as her hair, which is black in color.<br />
“I feel strong,” Beth admiring the muscles rippling under her fury half.<br />
“We all do, Cassie commenting as she yawns and stretches after waking up. Unlike everyone else her blonde hair was an absolute mess; in need of a comb before she could even step outside; but she paused her attempt to make herself presentable as she examined her new centaur self.<br />
“An Eriskay pony,” Beth looking at her bunkmate for the night; “they were native to the Hebridian Islands of Scotland.”<br />
“How do you know that,” Cassie responding; admiring how shiny her coat is despite the low light in the common space of the bungalow they were temporarily housed in.<br />
“Instinct,” Beth shrugging her shoulders; “I just know. Just like Eve and Kyra here both became Sorraia centaurs.”<br />
“And where is that horse breed from,” Kyra looking at her head scarf and deciding to leave it behind; Eager to let her raven hair that falls to the middle of her back flow freely in the wind; it stands in stark contrast to the light dirty brown fur and auburn mane and tail. Eve was a similar coloration save for her brunette hair in a shoulder length bob tied together with a green scrunchie.<br />
“The Iberian Peninsula, primarily from Portugal,” Maggie being the quickest to answer.<br />
“You think the boys are up,” Eve buttoning up her shirt; having the sense to take it off as before going to bed to keep the buttons from popping or tearing off the fabric.<br />
“No sense in hiding in here,” Cassie opening the door; “I want to feel the sun on my new body. Plus I need to pee.”<br />
<br />
*************<br />
<br />
“Oh what a dream,” Xing waking up as a sliver of light hit his face; the Chinese American and oldest of the boys yawned as he sat up; his equine frame shifting so he was resting on his lower belly. Taking a moment to sniff his shirt, wondering if he needs to change it before pulling it off of him. He noticed in his dream that he shared with the other foals or yearlings as his new instincts tell him that he was based off of a Suffolk Punch Horse. A rare draft horse from England; his chestnut brown fur with subtle amber highlights made him look regal as he galloped on the plains. Deciding that the shirt was too dirty, he grabs his backpack that became a make shift pillow and pulls out a black t-shirt with a white skull printed on it. An old shirt from a famous Wrestler, Xing looks at his bunk mate, Malcom. The only African American among the group of Boy scouts, now a Caspian Centaur. Xing laughed as the dark skinned boy had a greyish furred body for his horse half that had white highlights spotted throughout the fur.<br />
“Wake up you wanna be rapper,” Xing getting up and giving his new herd brother a few pokes with a hoof; “and help me get the others up.”<br />
<br />
Malcom grumbled as he slowly stirred; feeling the prodding from Xing’s hoof was not how he wanted to be roused from a peaceful slumber, but the day needed to be met and he was not going to be allowed to sleep in. Getting up the newest centaur looks at himself and at Xing and couldn’t help but smirk at Epona’s whimsical sense of humor.<br />
“Did she purposely make us rare breeds or was this just random chance,” Malcom stretching; “not that I’m complaining mind you.”<br />
“But you were hoping to be more unique than everyone else,” Xing heading to the other rooms to rouse the rest of the boys up.<br />
“Well more unique than Maggie,” Malcom recalling the dream of chasing the red headed girl who was a plains Zebra as they slept.<br />
“Let the young filly have her moment,” Xing seeing Zack and Adam slowly get up. Noticing that Zack became and Old English Black; common during the Norman conquest of England during 1066, the species died out due to interbreeding. Zack’s fur coloring was a pure jet black along with matching mane and tail, flowing wildly and mixing with his short black hair on his head. Adam was based on another extinct horse breed. An Abaco Barb; native to the islands of the Bahamas. Adam’s fur was pure white save for a single large brown spot on his left flank.<br />
<br />
“I wonder if Tim will be a handful today now that he is a centaur,” Adam yawning as he quickly gets up on his hooves. Finding the task easy despite his new mass, as he walks to the common area; walking around the central fire place as he rubs the sleep from his amber eyes.<br />
“Blessing upon Epona, the young immature boy shouts as he trots out of the bedroom he shared with Jeremy. He was just as unique as Maggie with his new centaur self. His horse half based on the Tarpan; a wild breed of horse that roamed the Eurasian plains before dying out due to being hunted for their meat and pelts. Jeremy soon walked out looking larger than most thanks to being a breed of the Turkoman horse. His glossy coat of chestnut brown fur giving off a metallic sheen as it passed by the light shining through the curtains covering the windows.<br />
“Shit,” Xing commenting how big Jeremy became; “your dad is going to be bowled over by how big you got.”<br />
“I can’t wait to see him,” Jeremy pawing the ground in excitement; “you all want to get out of here and make some noise?”<br />
“Bathroom first,” Malcolm feeling the need to do his morning pee; “then we stampede about the place.”</p>
