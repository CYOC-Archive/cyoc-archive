<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Mary slowly emerged from her slumber. She didn't know what time it was, but the sky outside was a deep blue. She could see a few stars beginning to appear. She stretched her arms and legs, but didn't get up off the bed. She was still feeling very full, and her body was strangely warm. She looked at her arms to see the black fur that had covered them. With a clawed hand, she felt her furry face and large round ears. She smiled and rolled onto her side. Her tail swayed around on the bed as Mary pulled her blanket tighter around her.
<P>Then she remembered she fell asleep on TOP of the blankets.
<P>She looked down into the large collar of her blouse. It was way too big to even be a collar, yet that's what it was. She lifted her head and saw that her shirt had grown over twice its size. Mary bolted upright, but her stomach gurgled and an unusual weight made sitting up much more difficult. Her collar dangled off of one furry shoulder as she pulled and pulled on the fabric until she had hoisted the bottom of the shirt over her head. The bra had come off with her shirt, but her legs had become entangled in her panties. Aside from this, fur was all that covered her body. It was jet black everywhere except for a large white section which went from her neck, over her breasts and down to her overlarge stomach.
<P>"What the hell?" she screamed, shocked at the sight. Fur, okay, but that gut was impossible. She had a real decent pot belly going, and it was heavy. "Did I eat an entire pig in my sleep?" She thought it over for a minute, trying to calm herself down and find an explanation. Then she remembered her shirt. She shuffled over to the side of the bed and carefully dropped to the floor. She was barely taller than the bed! She leaned against it as her balance shifted. Her belly sagged and gurgled, and her tail tried its best to find a proper position to keep her balanced on two legs.
<P>Her legs were changed. Now they were the complete hindquarters of a skunk. Her large paws had claws that dug into the carpet. Mary trudged slowly to her full-length mirror to examine her entire body. Her face had a white streak that went from her black nose and up into her hair. She turned around and saw two white stripes go down from her head all the way to the tip of her large, fluffy tail. Her face had a small skunkish muzzle, and her hair had changed color. It was now snow white, with two black streaks going down the length of it.
<P>She would have admired herself a lot more, but the pressing matter of her height weighed as much on her mind as her gut weighed on her body. The long walk down the giant hallway gave her plenty of time to think about it. Obviously, the shrink vial was still affecting her, but why the belly? Maybe the huge amount of food that she had eaten afterward wasn't being affected by the vial? That would mean that, as she got smaller, that pot belly of hers would get even bigger.
<P>She arrived at the wall scale she had drawn earlier and measured herself at one foot, nine inches. Who knew how much more she would shrink? She lugged herself and her massive belly over to the table where the vials were, but there was no way she was going to be able to jump up there in her current state. She was way too heavy.
<P>There was a chair nearby. She could climb onto that and then climb onto the table, but first she needed to get it closer. She took a long time dragging it across the rug, and when she finally had it in position, she had already lost a couple more precious inches. She jumped, grabbed the wooden platform and held on with her claws. It took a minute, but she finally got herself up onto the chair. She rested for a little bit, panting. "I hope I'll be able to work all of this extra weight off," she gasped. When she was ready for the next climb, she knew it would be even harder. The distance between the chair and the table was a little less than between the chair and the floor, but she had already shrunk enough to make that difference moot.
<P>With another jump, she grabbed the edge of the table and tried to hoist herself up. She knew she might not get another chance if she fell now, but she wasn't sure she was strong enough to pull herself up this time.</p>
