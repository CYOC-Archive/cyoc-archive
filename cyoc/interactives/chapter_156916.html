<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elizabeth held the phone to her ear as though it was the only thing in the world that mattered.  She had tried to balance the phone on her middle shoulder between 2 heads, but the risk of it falling off was too high, so she held it up to the left ear of one of her left heads.  Her other torso was squeezed up as close as possible to the phone - her breasts were pressed tightly through her black tube-top into the side of her other torso, but she didn&#39;t care.  She held her breath 4 times over listening to the ringing on the other end.  The seconds went by painfully slowly.  <br />
<br />
In a rare moment of clarity, Elizabeth decided that she wanted to funnel all of her mental focus into the head listening to the phone.  A part of her expected her quadruple vision to fade out and her other heads to start to act autonomously... But it didn&#39;t happen.  Even with all her mental focus funneled on the phone, she was surprised to find that she was still thinking about other things.<br />
<br />
A part of Elizabeth wondered if maybe her family had a magical backstory of some kind.  Something that would interact with the vials she bought in such a crazy way to change reality.  Another part was concerned about Gina.  Despite trying to filter it out, Elizabeth&#39;s 8 ears could clearly hear Gina suffering in the bathroom.  Another part simply worried.  Worried that something irreversible had happened, that something had gone wrong, that something had gone right in a wrong way, that someone had some vendetta out for her, and so on.<br />
<br />
Ring... Ring... Ring...  And then... &quot;Hello?&quot;  Elizabeth instantly recognized the voice of Devianne, the shopkeeper from Spellcast Magic Supplies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you have no idea how happy I am that you&#39;re there!&quot;  Elizabeth suddenly realized that she had spoken with all 4 mouths and took a moment to collect and calm herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, okay.  The connection isn&#39;t very good, I&#39;m getting some crazy echoing.  You might need to speak extra clearly.&quot;<br />
<br />
With the mental focus of a brain surgeon, Elizabeth responded with only the head actually up against the phone.  &quot;Ssorry. That wass me.  I visited your sshop earlier today and bought some transsformation ssetss.  The Zodiac oness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, I remember you.  Sounds like you might have ussssed it.&quot; Devianne intentionally dragged out the s a few extra seconds to get her point across.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yess.  That&#39;ss actually the problem.  Uhh... My BookFace page hass picturess from lasst month of me looking how I am after I drank the vialss.  But I wass normal then.  And my roommate ssaw me and didn&#39;t sseem to notice.  Well sshe ssaw me but sshe di-&quot;  An audible sigh from the phone interrupted Elizabeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie... Did you read the card?  Not the business card, but the other one.  The legalese one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth&#39;s torso that wasn&#39;t on the phone pulled back from her other torso and turned back towards her room.  One head looked straight ahead towards the door and the other looked down at her sizable snake tail.  Her eyes traced the tail from where it connected from her waist to the point where it joined with her other torso&#39;s tail into the singular rear 2/3rds of her naga body.  Dual sighs echoed from her lips.  <i>Oh, if only my torsos weren&#39;t joined so closely to the front of my body.  I&#39;d be able to reach the boxes if I was joined closer to the end...</i><br />
<br />
At the same time, and without losing a beat Elizabeth&#39;s other torso responded on the phone, &quot;Well uhm... No.  I got a little caught up in the excitement and forgot about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A small chuckle from Devianne gave way to another sigh, &quot;Okay sweetie.  Do you at least still have the card?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yess.  I jusst can&#39;t reach it from the phone.  Ssorry, I&#39;m on a landline.  Uhh, it&#39;s complicated.  I can go get it if you want.&quot;  Despite knowing full well that she couldn&#39;t reach where she had hidden the boxes in her closet, Elizabeth slithered her other torso as far towards her bedroom as she could.  Impressively she was able to make it to the bedroom door and see inside, but couldn&#39;t get any further without backing away from the phone.  She longingly stared towards the closet.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, that&#39;s fine.  Before I explain, promise me that you&#39;ll read it the whole way through before you do anything else, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth nodded enthusiastically with all 4 heads for a moment before remembering to audibly confirm.  &quot;Yess!  I will!  Promise!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sweetie.  The short version is: You&#39;re fine.  You&#39;re a recreational magic user, so you&#39;re protected by the veil.  It makes it so people who don&#39;t know about magic won&#39;t &#39;notice&#39; things changed by magic.  It&#39;s called a bunch of different things.  Probably the only name that would make sense to you is &#39;normalization&#39;.  No matter what you do to yourself with that set of vials I sold you, people who don&#39;t know magic will see you as being &#39;normal&#39;.&quot; Devianne&#39;s calm voice soothing explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... What about my BookFace page?  My old picturess were changed!  Iss thiss permanent?&quot; Elizabeth struggled to hold back as she felt 2 of her heads start to hyperventilate.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s likely a part of the vial&#39;s magic.  Not all transformative magic behaves the some.  Some of it changes you in the moment, some of it changes you across all of time and space at once.  Sorta.  I don&#39;t fully understand it.  Some mages will talk your ears off about the benefits of one over the other, but the TL DR is: One changes your old photos and videos, and the other doesn&#39;t.  That&#39;s pretty much it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!  Sso now I wass a naga growing up too??&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiiiiiinda.  But also not really.  It&#39;s weird.  Magic gets weird.  Do you remember your childhood?  Do you remember being a naga?&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth focused, trying to remember the earliest thing she could.  <i>There!  Riding a swing in the backyard... With legs!  And then Bob threw a ball at me and I fell off and skinned me knee.  OUCH!</i><br />
&quot;Uhh.  Yeah,  I remember ssome thingss.  I wass normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then don&#39;t worry about it.  It&#39;s <i>pretty damn hard</i> for a recreational user to get permanently stuck using over-the-counter transformatives.  Has been since they cracked down on it in the late 1700s.  Salem was a bit of a pitchfork to the ass, if you catch my drift.  Stop me if I&#39;m getting too crazy, but have you <i>tried</i> to reverse your change?&quot;<br />
<br />
4 faces simultaneously blushed.  In that instant, Elizabeth was glad she was talking over the phone and Devianne couldn&#39;t physically see her faces.  &quot;Uhh... No.  I panicked.  Ssorry...&quot;<br />
<br />
Devianne&#39;s giggle was muffled, but still audible.  &quot;Aww, the first time&#39;s always a doozy.  So, you gotta tell me, what did you do to yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Elizabeth&#39;s torsos turned to each other and her 4 heads looked over her other torso.  From a distance of 40 feet.  Her gazes shifted down to the sizable snake tail covering that distance, and going beyond.  One of her far torso&#39;s heads giggled at the absurdity of it.<br />
&quot;Well uh... Sso I&#39;m a naga now.  About ssixty feet long.  And I have two upper bodies.  Or torssoss.  Joined about twenty feet down my tail.  Uh.  Each torsso has 2 headss and 4 armss.&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth waited, a little worried as the silence on the line felt deafening.  Devianne&#39;s breath caught in the phone as a faint &quot;Wow&quot; snuck through the line. &quot;So <i>that&#39;s</i> why I liked you.  Holy crap girl, I wish I could see you.  Hey, next time you&#39;re in the mall, if you haven&#39;t changed back to normal, stop by and show me what crazy form you&#39;ve got, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Relieved, Elizabeth let out a small giggle.  &quot;Okay, deal.  Though I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d do going out in public like thiss.  Hey, while you&#39;re here, I have a quesstion about the vials... The Gemini one.  If I drink all of it, will it make like... a different me.  Someone else with the same body?  A clone, I guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t know how, but she could practically hear Devianne&#39;s shrug through the phone.  &quot;Hard to tell.  Usually magic like that has its own internal rules of consistency.  Best advice I can give you is to experiment.  Besides, making new people is some heavy duty magic.  I&#39;d be very surprised if it was able to make a new person.  Usually when you see magic that clones a person, it sticks in a magic version of one of those automated phone systems.  Very specific responses to specific events, no real thought.  And a whole bunch of cloning magic doesn&#39;t even do that.  Just an empty shell.  So yeah, experiment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, okay.  Was jusst curiouss.  So uh... I&#39;m good to sshow the vialss to my roommate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Read the legalese card sweetie.  It&#39;s not bad, I promise.  I gotta go, customer just walked in.  Remember, next time you&#39;re in the mall drop in.  Bye!&quot;<br />
<br />
Elizabeth let out 4 sighs of relief she didn&#39;t know she was holding.  She hung up the phone and immediately turned to slither as fast as she could back to her bedroom.  With how close one of her torsos was to the door, in just a second she was already in her bedroom.  And not only that, but she was slithering on top of her tail, which she had never pulled out of the bedroom when she went to talk on the phone.  Not painful by any measure, her tail was pure muscle, just an interesting sensation.<br />
<br />
She reached the clothes hamper in her closet that she had hidden the vials behind at the same time that her other torso reached her bedroom door.  The physical duality of her form intrigued her, and she couldn&#39;t help but wonder if she wanted more.  Her torso in the closet pushed aside the clothes hamper and looked at the 2 boxes of magical vials sitting there on the carpet.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth finished slithering her tail into her room, closed the door, paused to think, and then...</p>
