I shook my head to cancel the dizziness I was having. Note to self fast-forward five years or more will leave you disoriented. I calmly collect myself and let my new memory sink in before looking around. There were many adults as well as kids walking around with the kids playing while the adults were talking. The oldest kid that I can spot was Becky, Brad’s sister who is 11 years old at the moment. The youngest kid that I can see was probably around six years old, but I knew that along with Betty as well as Bessie’s and Ashley‘s younger half sibling, they were probably four or five-year-olds running around too.<br />
<br />
Same as before, I looked down at my body to confirmed and I’m looking at my eight year old body. I knew I was potty train at this point so I was wearing underwear, some blue jeans, and an orange shirt. I looked at my right hand again and sure enough the ring was still there. A figure came up behind me and hugged me surprisingly.<br />
<br />
“Guess who?” Ask a familiar voice. I turned to look behind me and the person  who was hugging me was a 15-year-old version of Monique wearing a red tube top that covered her chest, which is obviously a B-cup and pants. The only problem is I knew this was not Monique so I struggled and got out of her arms and the hug. I turned back to glare at her.<br />
<br />
“Not funny Nadia.” I said clearly, not comfortable being around her. She just gave a frown and snapped her fingers.<br />
<br />
“Damn how are you able to always tell us apart?” Nadia said, and I knew that we were drawing a crowd so I decided to embarrass her. <br />
<br />
“Monique’s is bigger.” I said, patting my chest. Nadia flush red as everyone laughed at her. She then let out an indignant growl before stomping off. Everyone including me stop laughing, and while everyone returned to their business, I decide to walk around. <br />
<br />
I knew not everyone was in the living room or the dining room because there were so many of us. That’s why I made the wish to encompass the mansion and property so I knew some of them are probably in the backyard playing. As I walked around, I noticed something odd about the group kids that I know to be the freshman that was invited to the party. <br />
<br />
Is that there were a few more than what was invited. Also there is the fact that I didn’t recognize them and I took time to memorize the faces all the freshman that came to this party. Two of them is an 6 year old African girl and a Pakistani boy I never seen before, but what was odd about them is that they share the same facial traits. It was almost as if they were half siblings. I then spotted Mrs. Brockman talking to an African woman and a Pakistani woman. They were dress in normal attire but if my memories are correct, they are or were part of Mrs. Brockman’s maid staff.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Mrs. Brockman for not firing us all those years ago. It’s really an honor that you allow us to stay as part of the staff and helping us. You even allow our kids to be here despite you know.” The African woman said.<br />
<br />
“It’s all I can do after that oversight of allowing that bastard into this house, especially since he had a child. To think that he would come back after taking his child home that night and follow one of you to the maids dormitory. For the next couple months ambush and rape all of you.” Mrs. Brockman said what a sigh of regret before continuing.<br />
<br />
“Not only that bastard cheated on his wife with another mother from the party causing two divorces. But your testimonies allowed us to charge that bastard and throw his ass in jail. If I’m honest, you’re the brave ones while the rest of my staff at the time chose to have abortions you and a few others kept your children. It’s even brave for coming to this party and bringing your children, here, especially since <i>his</i> son is here.” Mrs. Brockman concluded.<br />
<br />
“We are proving that our kids are products of nurture, not nature. Besides his wife took custody of their son. You can’t honestly say that he shares his behavior.” Said the Pakistani woman. With that Mrs. Brockman look like she drifted into thought.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know she said that he always had an anger issues, and their son is showing the same type of issues.” Mrs. Brockman pondered out loud. Oh a bit of drama also something to correct. So one of the fathers around the time that I was a baby, practically raped Mrs. Brockman’s staff and now has a few illegitimate children. I guess when I return to 17 years old and continue on with the rest of the show; I have to do something about that. Maybe find a way to get rid of the legitimate child whoever that can be.<br />
<br />
Deciding that I had enough of being indoors, I went outside to the backyard. I can always spot the kids playing on playground equipment that wasn’t there before. I was kind of surprise no one was in the pool. Then a familiar 15-year-old girl came up to me and I knew this was the real Monique. She was wearing a similar outfit to her sister, but she was wearing a white tank top.<br />
<br />
“Hey Joey.” Monique said as she got down a bit to give me a good hug which I returned. As soon as we broke it off, I looked up to her.<br />
<br />
“Hey Monique, is everything fun out here?” I ask as any eight-year-old child would do. She simply nodded and I went to join the others. I sat down in a swing and was about to start when I heard a sound coming next to me. I turned in time to see Bessie (in a white dress with dark spots) pushing down a boy in front of her while behind her was another boy wearing jeans and a Star Wars T-shirt.<br />
<br />
“Get out of here!” Bessie yelled. The boy on the ground turn around and start running.<br />
<br />
“Fine you deal with the freak.” The bully said as he ran. Bessie gave a sigh as she turned around to address the other boy.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay?” Bessie asked. The boy nodded at his head and Bessie relaxed before talking to them again. “Why does he call you freak? You look like a normal boy to me.” The boy all of a sudden straighten up and look like he was offended.<br />
<br />
“It’s because I’m a girl.” Now identified girl that said and I did a double take. This girl didn’t had any characteristics that would say that she was a girl at the age of eight. I wasn’t the one doing a double take.<br />
<br />
“Really? Cause you don’t…” Bessie started to say before the girl interrupted her.<br />
<br />
“I get that a lot even my own family cannot distinguish that I’m a girl unless I drop my pants. It also doesn’t help that I like wearing boys clothes. I’m Alexandria, by the way Alex for short.” The girl said, extending her hand. Bessie took it and shook it.<br />
<br />
“Bailey Jackson nice to meet you. Let’s get along.” Bessie said and I smiled at interaction. However the fact that Alex prefers boys clothes over girls clothes made me think of a trick to perform once we get back to normal. Well I think this is been enough as an eight-year-old so I mentally made my wish to fast-forward to the next birthday party.</p>
