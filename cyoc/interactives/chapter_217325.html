<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">If someone told Andrew years ago what his life would be like today, he would think they were completely insane. The stark contrast between his two lives was more than he could have imagined. Years ago, he had a human family. Jeff was a good boy, even he hasn&#39;t had a girlfriend. He had a loving, if sexless marriage with his wife. Andrew was relieved his wife loved him even after he realized he was gay and he loved her back, not just not with any sexual attraction.<br />
<br />
Now he was not a lion man, back in his prime and far stronger than he ever had been before. And he not one, but <b>two</b> lion wives that he was having regular sex with. Andrew found it a little surprising that he had a more sexually-active marriage than before. After his conversion, he expected to start dating one of the other gay Animalians. Kinjara had only been there to help him deal with his new leonine instincts and his bisexuality. Maybe it was because he lived his life as a straight man before he realized his homosexuality. But he found himself falling in love with Kinjara and marrying her.<br />
<br />
Andrew had thought himself a content lion before, but then Maybanke entered the picture, or Ruby as she preferred to be called now. Kinjara had been quite welcoming to Ruby joining their pride, overeager even. And Ruby was quite different from Kinjara. Not only did the conversion made the centenarian into a curvaceous amazon, but she had a lot more experience in doing housework than the uplifted Kinjara. Ruby was becoming an increasingly dominant figure in the household, which Kinjara didn&#39;t seem to mind. Perhaps leonine instinct made her submit to an obviously superior queen.<br />
<br />
For instance, the two of them were currently discussing plans for cubs, though Andrew felt more like a spectator than a participant. &quot;We should Jeff has his own place with his mates,&quot; said Kinjara.<br />
<br />
&quot;How much longer would that be?&quot; asked Ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Jeff and Zoe can marry whenever they want to. I don&#39;t think her parents have much say in it,&quot; said Kinjara, &quot;It&#39;s Lena who requires waiting for. Her parents still aren&#39;t used to her being part of Jeff&#39;s pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not as easy for humans to grasp,&quot; said Ruby, &quot;I&#39;m glad I&#39;m a fast learner. Still, I&#39;m sure Lena&#39;s parents will come around eventually. And they&#39;ll have such fine cubs.&quot; The two lionesses gave each other broad grins. Andrew felt a little uncomfortable when they lasted after their stepson. Oh, they wouldn&#39;t act on it, but he had a feeling they fantasized about it when we wasn&#39;t around. Andrew may admit in his idler moments that he think about Zoe and Lena a little sexually, but he had more self-control. Unless he and Jeff started a joint-leadership of their pride and shared the lionesses between them, which was very unlikely, they would never touch each other&#39;s lionesses.<br />
<br />
Kinjara them brought them back to the present and said, &quot;But still, as Andrew&#39;s first wife, I should be the first to have his cubs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s fine with me,&quot; said Ruby, &quot;I&#39;ve already had more than a few children. Not to mention <i>their</i> children may take issue if I have any cubs.&quot; Yes, her eldest grandson had not been happy to learn his grandmother was not only younger and far less likely to pass away anytime soon, but now she was part of a new family who&#39;ll also be getting part of her fortune. Though the look on his face as he wrapped his head around the idea was absolutely priceless.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Ruby didn&#39;t invite <i>all</i> of her family to her show. Her primary target was her grandson, who had been demanding the lion&#39;s share of the inheritance. Well, she was going to show him exactly what the lion&#39;s share looks like. It took Ruby a little time to learn the routine of &#39;The King&#39;s Tribute&#39;, though it&#39;s not a particularly difficult act to do. It wasn&#39;t hard to dress Ruby so scantily, though the trick was making sure she wasn&#39;t <i>too</i> scantily. And unlike Kinjara, she had long human hair that she could put into decorative braids with beads woven in.<br />
<br />
It was quite possible that her family may not have recognized Ruby like this. Indeed, there was little resemblance between the old woman they&#39;ve known their whole lives and this busty, muscular lioness who was shamelessly flaunting onstage. Ruby&#39;s invitation was vague enough to not immediately tell her family about what she had become. But Ruby added a bit of narrative to the act to make her identity clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;My great king, I wish to console your wisdom,&quot; said Ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;What troubles you?&quot; asked King Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have had many clubs, most of them are fully grown. But the eldest has grown greedy. He demands all the lands of his ancestors for himself and the bounty they contain,&quot; said Ruby.<br />
<br />
&quot;And he would share none of this with his family?&quot; asked King Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nay, he demands the lion&#39;s share of the inheritance for himself,&quot; said Ruby, giving a sideways smirk towards the audience as she said that. If that didn&#39;t make her grandson twig about what was going on here, he&#39;d have to be thicker than she thought. But she caught the look of shock on his face, and she knew he knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you should redivide the bounty among the rest of your family,&quot; said King Andrew, &quot;I&#39;m sure it has grown larger by now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it may grow larger still,&quot; said Ruby, &quot;If you would allow me to join yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am intrigued by your proposal, but you will need to show you are worthy of becoming one of my wives,&quot; said King Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I shall show you I am most worthy,&quot; said Ruby before going into a rather titillating dance.<br />
<br />
That night was definitely one that Ruby&#39;s grandson, let along the rest of her family, would never forget. It was better still when Ruby introduced who else would be added to her revised will. Jeff is usually a respectable young man, but this time, he was at the Meat Market dressed like a rapper, including dark sunglasses, fake gold necklaces, and baggy pants that revealed his boxers. To top it off, both Zoe and Lena were also there as Jeff&#39;s arm candy, wearing what essentially amounted to crop tops and miniskirts. Lena was a bit worried about her parents finding out about this, but the others assured her that the designated victim was Ruby&#39;s grandson. Lena&#39;s parents wouldn&#39;t have to hear about what their daughter was wearing...unless she really wanted to prove how much she wanted to be with Jeff.</p>
