<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You're Rick, you're thirty-six years old, and you need some money since you're between jobs right now. Looking at the ad you think that this would be just about perfect. From the way the ad is worded you guess that they have several things they need human test subjects for. Perhaps you'd get one that lasts awhile and pays big money. But you're a little cautious about it. All there is is an address. It sounds like some sort of scam. After weighing the options you decide to go and see. If it is a scam at least you shouldn't be harmed by it having protected your identity already.<br />
<br />
Arriving at the place you find that it isn't what you expected. It looks like a doctor's office but it feels different. It must be the mystery surrounding the tests. There were already some people around the waiting room. Some of them were filling out some forms while others were waiting. You walk up to a pretty receptionist and hand her the ad saying, &quot;I'm here to be a test subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; the receptionist says taking the ad. &quot;You need to fill out these forms in their entirety and truthfully to be considered for the testing,&quot; she said handing you a small stack of forms.<br />
<br />
You take the forms and a pen and go sit down. The first few forms are pretty standard asking for your name, birth date, social security number, sex, what illnesses you recently have and have right now, whether you're allergic to anything or not, that type of stuff. The next forms asked some random questions and you answered truthfully to each one. Though some of the questions were weird like one that asked, &quot;If you could would you become a little girl?&quot; This had to be some sort of psychological test. You guessed that they had to weed out some of those that might not be able to mentally handle what their testing. Then you came to the non-disclosure agreement. You read over it very carefully to make sure what you could and couldn't do. From what you were able to gather you couldn't even mention that you were a test subject if selected. Doing so before the tests became public knowledge could get you thrown in prison for life and your memory wiped. you thought back to an interview you had heard on a radio show where a guy had been working at a top secret base. He had blabbed about something there and when he went into work the next day he just remembered getting on the bus and then getting off. He couldn't remember what he did that day between those times. Could they be testing some top secret research here? You looked over the non-disclosure form again really thinking about whether or not you wanted to continue. This wasn't about the money anymore. Your life could be ruined if you let one little thing slip. At the same time you had to wonder what they could be testing. You read over the agreement a couple more times.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
In a back room the doctors were looking at the camera feed from the waiting room. &quot;What do you think of him?&quot; one of them asked. &quot;Do you think we might be able to use him for our black secret test?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He seems to be taking this very seriously,&quot; another said. &quot;He's been looking over the non-disclosure agreement very carefully and is obviously thinking it over. Most of the others just signed it evidently not thinking anything about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; a third said. &quot;But we don't know what he answered on the questionnaire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He gave a lot of thought on that too,&quot; a fourth said. &quot;I'd say he's the best candidate for it from what we've seen so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
All the others murmured their agreement then the first doctor said to the fourth doctor, &quot;If he signs you can go out to get the forms Morgana. He's to be given top consideration for the black secret test. We'll just have to see how he answers the questionnaire.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
You thought about this one more time. You were curious but could you handle having your life potentially ruined. You figured you could keep a secret so what did you have to lose? You decided that it was too good of an opportunity to pass up so you signed your name and took the forms up to the desk. As you approached the desk a woman in a white coat came out and said, &quot;I'll take those sir. If you'll have a seat we'll go over these forms and decide if we can use you as a test subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you said as you handed the forms to the woman and went to sit back down.<br />
<br />
You waited for a good hour before the woman came back out and came up to you. &quot;Rick, I'm Doctor Morgana,&quot; she said as you stood up. &quot;We've decided that we can use you so if you'll follow me we'll get your height and weight checked and draw a blood sample.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you said following Dr. Morgana.<br />
<br />
Once you had your blood taken and you had your height and weight measured Dr. Morgana took you to a room and said, &quot;Wait here. I'll be back in a few minutes.&quot; With that she left and you looked around. It looked like any ordinary doctor's examination room. Something in the back of your mind told you that this was just a stop. After a few minutes Dr. Morgana came back in and said, &quot;Before we go on we're giving you one last chance to back out of the testing. If you don't think you can keep what test we've picked for you say so now and we'll send you on your way with one thousand dollars for your time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does the test involve alien beings?&quot; you asked smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell you what the test is or what it involves until you answer my question,&quot; Dr. Morgana said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured as much,&quot; you said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will tell you that we have tested it on animals and it's been a success,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;So there's not much to worry about with your safety.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think you were mad scientists anyway,&quot; you said smiling. &quot;You're too pretty to be one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Morgana laughed at that and said, &quot;Thanks. Now are you going to go forward with this?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smiled and said, &quot;I'm prepared to see this through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was hoping to hear you say that,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;Now if you'll follow me we'll go to the lab.&quot;<br />
<br />
You did follow her asking, &quot;When are you going to tell me what I'll be testing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;So far you're the only one that has qualified for what we're going to test on you. Though there's a young lady in the waiting room that seems like she might also qualify. If she does you'll be able to meet her.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod thinking that this had to be something good. It just had to do with some sort of alien technology. You were surprised when you came to an elevator which required Dr. Morgana to swipe a card, submit a hand scan, a sample of blood, and a retinal scan before it opened. Once inside she had to go through the same procedure and this time you had to too. She then gave a series of code words too fast for you to keep up with. After all that the elevator started to descend. It took a few minutes for it to come to a stop and when the door opened Dr. Morgana led you along a corridor with armed military personnel almost everywhere. You were getting more convinced that this had to do with aliens and the government. You also knew that from this day forward your life would never be the same. At the end of the hall there was a door which when you went through it locked behind you. You were now in some sort of airlock and you heard a humming sound. Dr. Morgana wasn't worried about this as she stayed still so you didn't worry about it as much as if you had come here by yourself. finally the other door opened and you walked into the lab.<br />
<br />
You were amazed at the size of it. It looked like something out of a science fiction movie. There were tubes running everywhere connecting various vats of liquid. There were computer monitors everywhere. But the only ones that seemed to be in here were you and Dr. Morgana. &quot;Isn't there suppose to be someone else here?&quot; you asked looking around.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be later,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;For now we have the lab to ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this some sort of sex experiment?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends on how you look at it,&quot; Dr. Morgana said cryptically. She led you over to one of the tables and said, &quot;This is what we'll be testing on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at the screen and saw that the test involved...</p>
