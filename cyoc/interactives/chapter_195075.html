<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He could hear his heart pulsating wildly in his ears. Gathering whatever little dignity he might have left, Ethan ran into the locker rooms, hands gripping his crotch tightly, not that there was much to hold on to but he couldn’t risk anything slipping out. The roars of laughter may have diminished within the barrier of concrete walls, but the heat rising within his cheeks refused to dissipate.<br />
<br />
Ethan caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror. Had there always been so many goddamn mirrors in this school? He almost didn’t recognize the reflection looking back at him, the boy may have had the physique akin to that of Olympic medalist Adam Peaty, but somehow he appeared small, in more ways than one. All Ethan could see was a scared cowering child. The fear seemed to have subdued his erection and Ethan watched mesmerized as the satisfied nub between his legs retreated so far inside the body that it looked like a second belly button, a thin layer of cum circled around the front hole like a glazed donut.<br />
<br />
A crescendo of footsteps snapped Ethan back from his daze, there was no time to stall and he needed to cover up fast! He almost jumped both legs into his skinny jeans and managed to zip up the fly just as the whole swim team walked in.<br />
<br />
“I’m pretty sure this is yours dude” Greg tossed a red Speedo at Ethan which promptly made a loud, wet, whack sound as it slapped across his face. An apology from Greg was followed by a chorus of laughter.<br />
<br />
“That was fucking hilarious!” one teammate exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“The way you just zoomed out! Are you trying out for the track team too?” jested another.<br />
<br />
A couple of slaps on the back and a few more benign jokes later, everyone just went on with showering and changing back into their casual clothes. It was safe to assume that no one had seen the offending member ‘How would they? I’ve got a tiny sleeping turtle down there’ Ethan thought chuckling to himself, as the image of his reflection that he saw merely minutes ago emblazoned in his mind. He could joke about it now, the worst was over.<br />
<br />
Jared comes in last, looking absolutely annoyed “Coach is pissed” he says, swinging his locker door open.<br />
<br />
“What else is new?” Greg scoffs, wiping his chiseled arms dry with a hand towel.<br />
<br />
“Some idiot TP’ed the pool or something”<br />
<br />
“What?” Ethan said, though it comes out an almost whimper. It was happening again, the pitter patter building up in his chest.<br />
<br />
“There’s like, a lotta pulp clogging the filters right now” Jared went on “He’s probably gonna grill everyone”.<br />
<br />
Ethan lowered his gaze down to his toes. ‘It’s like I can’t catch a break’ the voice in his head echoed, ‘I really should have thought things through before lending Eric my stuff… and letting him hang on to the ring was just reckless!’ his eyes made it’s way to his, yet again, flat crotch ‘Coach is going to wring it out of me and then everyone will find out’ and just like that he could feel the turtle head trying to peek out of it’s shell ‘For fuck’s sake!’<br />
<br />
“Ugh, we were here all afternoon, none of us could have done it” Greg groaned.<br />
<br />
“Was you wasn’t it?” Jared stated, clearly trying to start shit “Did your stuffing fall out, baby dick?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck off Montgomery”.<br />
<br />
The anxiety was beginning to be too much for Ethan to handle and he tried to leave but Greg suddenly grabbed his wrist. Ethan looked up at him with raised furrowed eyebrows. He holds up Ethan’s Speedo.<br />
<br />
“Dude, don’t forget your…” Greg’s voice trailed off when his eyes adjusted to the white speck against red nylon; there was a bit of toilet paper stuck on the inner rim of the leg opening.<br />
<br />
Ethan hastily grabs his swim gear “Thanks” he managed to mutter before turning around to leave.<br />
<br />
“No problem dude” Greg said, his eyes lingering on Ethan’s back as he walked away.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Cycling through the neighborhood, Ethan could feel the warm summer breeze prickling his skin playfully. Mother Nature must have been teasing him, blowing a gust through the space between his toned thighs. He bit his lip to stop himself from creaming in his tight skinny jeans, because although the material was thick, his previous junk had always rubbed against both thighs, therefore distressing the denim enough to leave tears on the inseam.<br />
<br />
In the state of panic earlier he had forgo putting on his underwear; it was probably still lying abandoned on the floor of the locker rooms.<br />
<br />
The wind had been blowing into the holes in his pants for the whole ride home, dancing around in the gaps and tickling him relentlessly. Ethan imagined this must be what receiving fellatio from a ghost would be like. Was he ever this sensitive before? No, he couldn’t recall a time he ever was, not like this; this sensation must have been unique to Eric, it strangely made him a little jealous.<br />
<br />
The trip home felt like it took forever from all the edging, but surprisingly it went by faster than it typically would. Ethan figured in the end that having miniscule equipment made him a faster biker too. Ethan sluggishly tossed his bike on the side of their front porch, regardless of the unexpected pros he has had enough for one day, it was an interesting albeit nerve-wracking experiment and it was time to put things back to where they belong.<br />
<br />
When he walked in through the front door, he could instantly spot his little brother sitting on the sofa adjacent to the open kitchen counter; even from here the tent pitched in his crotch was visible and Ethan could not help but fix onto it. Eric’s lips stretched from ear to ear, beaming like it was Christmas day.<br />
<br />
“I take it things went well?” Ethan asked, picking up empty beer bottles as he made his way to the counter, dropping them all off into a nearby trashcan.<br />
<br />
“It was AWESOME!” Eric exclaimed. Ethan felt a sweat drop down his temple, the kid was ecstatic; it may be difficult to get him to switch back without dimming that light. Ethan rubbed his hands together and propped up a chair opposite Eric, back to front, resting his crossed arms on the top rail.<br />
<br />
“Everyone kept staring at me today” Eric started, hands waving in the air, “ Pointing and calling me a crotch stuffer behind my back and ugh, I really wanted to just flash everyone on the spot, but you know… that’s dumb and I didn’t want to get into trouble” Ethan nodded in agreement, “But THEN this boy Matt, you know Matt?”<br />
<br />
“Uh remind me” Ethan sucked a bit of air through his teeth, trying not to make it obvious where he’d been looking.<br />
<br />
“Thinks he’s better than everyone, biggest dickhead in class, well used to be the biggest” Eric grinned.<br />
<br />
“Ha ha… right that Matt”<br />
<br />
“He came up behind me during lunch and did the job for me!”<br />
<br />
Ethan did a double take, “Wait what?” he leaned in a bit closer.<br />
<br />
Eric slowed down the tempo of his speech to emphasize his next words “He pulled down my pants and the WHOLE school saw my monster meat!”<br />
<br />
Ethan’s jaw dropped, talk about an Uno reverse card. No wonder his little brother was all giddy. He was happy for him, yet in the corner of his mind a minor nuance kept nagging, ‘Doesn’t he mean MY monster meat?’ It was unsettling how casually Eric had said it…but also, was pantsing someone a really common thing in high school? Greg got pantsed today too.<br />
<br />
“Holy sh-” Ethan began but was almost immediately interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Yeah and that’s not even the best part!” Eric’s face lit up even more, holding back laughter, he inched closer to Ethan, “He was kneeling behind me, so when I turned around to face him my cock and balls just swung and SLAPPED him in the face!” Eric proceeded to slap his hands together, reenacting the force, “I literally yeet his stupid face across the floor with the goods!”<br />
<br />
Both brothers guffawed uncontrollably. What a story, something to tell the grandkids no doubt! Throughout the day Ethan had been feeling regretful about his decision, but it seems as though everything went swimmingly for Eric and that was the most important thing, it was after all, the whole point of this transaction; this should be a good time to bring up the elephant in the room.<br />
<br />
“Asshole…couldn’t… even… look at me… during our Swimming unit!” Eric spurted in between gasping for air from laughing too much.<br />
<br />
“So ah… may I see the ring for a sec?” Ethan asked timidly.<br />
<br />
“The ring?” Eric’s eyes widened, he quickly jumped off the sofa “Oh no the ring!”<br />
<br />
“What? What about the ring?! You have it don’t you?!” The horror in Ethan’s voice was evident in how many octaves it went up. He could feel his entire body shiver as it tensed and he was sweating profusely.<br />
<br />
“Its right here…I was just…kidding” Eric reached into his pants pocket and showed Ethan the magic ring, his gaze falling down due to the guilt of making his brother worried.<br />
<br />
“Oh…Ha ha” Ethan laughed through gritted teeth, that was not at all funny to him, but Eric was just a kid. He took a deep breath to quell his…anger? Excitement? Ethan didn’t even know anymore, he was just so exhausted.<br />
<br />
“Ethan…?”<br />
<br />
“Ha ha you got me” Ethan raised his hands up in defeat.<br />
<br />
Eric motions his head to where he was looking. Ethan squints before his eyes gradually followed the direction downwards. Slightly viscous, yet clear fluid was dripping out of the hole on Ethan’s jeans. He had his legs wide open this whole time, a man-spreading habit developed from having had the biggest appendage in town, operative word- had. When Eric had pranked his older brother, the 17 year old had jolted his back up so fast it widened the tear on the inseam, which left everything in full view. Not only was Ethan positioned awkwardly more or less as if he was intentionally presenting himself,- hands up in the air on either side of his face and knees so far apart they were like wings in flight-  the shock had made him ejaculate for the second time in one day. Ethan sheepishly brought his legs together and Eric couldn’t help but see his big brother’s ears turning a bright shade of red.<br />
<br />
“I guess… I wasn’t the only one who had a good time?” Eric tried to make light of things, but failed.<br />
<br />
“Yeah well, fun-time’s over” Ethan said, in the most monotone voice Eric had ever heard come out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
Ethan stands up and Eric hands the ring over to him. Ethan began to unbutton his tattered skinny jeans but hesitated, then decided to pull his shirt off instead and passed it over to Eric who looked at his person, patting his torso, before pulling off a sock with Dick Grayson as Robin imprinted onto it and giving that up as an offering. He pulls Ethan’s shirt on over his head, it was so oversized, he had to grab on to the collar just to keep it on. Ethan put on the ring and stretched the small sock over his left hand.<br />
<br />
Both boys felt a familiar warmth in their crotches. Whilst the skinny jeans got tighter, Eric’s eyes wandered off to the side, unable to look down at his crotch or up to meet his brother’s face.<br />
<br />
The silence was extremely uncomfortable, what was there to say? What could Ethan possibly say to make things better? He had just ejaculated in front of his little brother… with his own dick no less!<br />
<br />
Ethan swallowed spit, hoping to get the ball in his throat down, when that failed he leaves for his room upstairs while Eric just stood there, frozen as if it would have stopped time and let him live out his fantasy just a little while longer.</p>
