<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Branch: Jeff stays a jeep and get disassembled by shop class<br />
After they all calmed down, Jeff&#39;s dad said, &quot;well there&#39;s not much we can do about this tonight. Jeff – looks like you&#39;ll have to be a jeep at least for a couple of days. Greg – go get him some fuel so at least he&#39;s not hungry.&quot;<br />
Greg hopped in to Jeff the jeep, and took him down to the corner store.<br />
&quot;Hey – as long as you are still my jeep, we might as will continue the modifications.&quot;<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Jeff replied. &quot;What if that makes it harder for me to transform back into a human?&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m confident that we will get the Chronivac fixed&quot; Said Greg. &quot;And I think that you will be bigger and more bad ass than you were.&quot;<br />
&quot;I am not comfortable with that&quot; said Jeff.<br />
&quot;OK-&quot; said Greg. &quot;At least can I still drive you to school until you get transformed back?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; replied Jeff. &quot;It beats sitting bored in the garage. Plus – I like all the people admiring my new tricked out body.&quot;<br />
After he got home, Greg parked Jeff in the garage and turned off the key. &quot;Just to be safe,&quot; Greg said, &quot;I should probably take the keys in so that you can&#39;t be stolen.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait – don&#39;t do…&quot; Jeff&#39;s radio went silent when the key was removed. It shut off all of his main power, and put him in a drowsy mode. He soon fell asleep, and had dreams of racing in the desert.<br />
The next day, Greg jumped into Jeff the jeep started him up with the roar. Jeff went from asleep to fully aroused in the turn of the key. &quot;Well good morning to me!&quot; said Jeff.<br />
&quot;Since you&#39;re going to miss PE, let&#39;s give you a work out!&quot; said Greg.<br />
Greg plowed through the same farmers field he went through the night before. It had rained a little, so the entire field was muddy. Jeff got completely coated in mud and debris from the field.<br />
&quot;Hey – that&#39;s not fair!&quot; said Jeff. &quot;Now nobody can see my new paint job and new chrome.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; said Bill. &quot;I&#39;ll park you by the shop, and will use their washbay to clean you up before we go home.&quot;<br />
&quot;You promised no more body modifications-&quot; said Jeff.<br />
Greg replied, &quot;Don&#39;t worry – Mr. Osborne has promised that you&#39;re off-limits today.&quot;<br />
Greg parked Jeff in one of the open auto bays so that Jeff can stay out of the sun. He did not want him to get too hot.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you after school,&quot; said Greg. He shut Jeff off, and took the keys for safekeeping. On second thought, he put Jeff&#39;s key on the key rack so that he could be moved if one of the classes needed the auto bay.<br />
Jeff got bored pretty quickly, and started to doze off.<br />
Meanwhile – Coach Dodds entered the shop office. Mr. Osborne would be out for the day, and coach had to cover his classes. Mr. Osborne left a note saying this will be an easy day today: have all the beginner classes disassemble one of the junkers in the auto bay. We will spend the next week rebuilding them.<br />
When the first freshman class rolled into the auto pay, Coach Dodds had them gather around Jeff the jeep.<br />
&quot;All right class, settle down. I&#39;m subbing for Mr. Osborne today; and he basically scheduled you a free day. All of you need to work together and disassemble this vehicle so that you can learn how all the various parts go together. Don&#39;t tear anything up; make it a clean disassembly.&quot;<br />
It was like ants surrounding a piece of candy. The students picked up various tools, and swarmed around Jeff. Jeff awoke with a start when he felt various pieces of him being touched all over.<br />
&quot;Hey! Jeff thought. &quot;What are they doing to me?&quot; Without his key, Jff had no power to start to play his radio. Since he was unlocked, the students had full reign over his entire body. His forehead of a hood came off first, followed by his wheels and fenders. They put Jeff up on blocks to make it easier to get underneath him. They pulled his rosebud muffler off and tossed on in a pile with his crumpled intestines of a tailpipe. Jose accidentally ripped his gas line out of his tank. Ouch! It felt like someone ripped out his throat. Unbolted items just felt like they disintegrated off him; broken item felt like wounds. Jeff realized he could feel air on all his insides as his skin was completely off. He could faintly still feel all the removed parts; but the connection was fading fast. He wished Greg- even Danny- was there. ARGH- one of the students drop and broke one of his headlights.<br />
Other students started working on his interior. They quickly pulled out his radio and instrument panel, and started pulling out his seat and completely disassembling them. Off came Jeff&#39;s dash, exposing most of his control center circuitry.<br />
Jeff started to panic – what would happen to his consciousness if he was completely torn apart? Was he a ghost in the machine, or did all the mechanical parts contain him somehow?<br />
One of the students, Brad, went to work on his shifter. After jerking it around, he unbolted it and proceeded to dry hump himself with it. This got a big laugh out of the class.<br />
&quot;This is humiliating,&quot; Jeff thought.<br />
The students pulled his engine block out, and started to take it apart piece by piece. Jeff could feel his organs coming apart into every little piece.<br />
Brad asked Joe,&quot; do we need to label where these things came from?&quot;<br />
&quot;No –&quot; replied Joe. &quot;Mr. Osborne will show us how to put it back together. Just dump all the extra bolts and parts in the supply bins.&quot;<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Thought Jeff. How would they be able to find all of his original parts? The original upgrades were few and discreet. He was now being disassembled by every nut and bolt. Jeff hoped that Greg would stop by to help with the freshman class as he usually does. Little did he know, though, that Greg was a new celebrity with his friends because of his new Jeep.<br />
By this point, the students had completely stripped Jeff&#39;s interior down to the frame – and had started to look at the electrical circuit wiring.<br />
Brad asked, Hey – what does this do?&quot;<br />
&quot;That looks like the main controlle,&quot;r Joe replied. &quot;Rip it out so that we can see how it works.&quot;<br />
Oh no! thought Jeff. I wonder if the controller is my brain. I hope they don&#39;t…<br />
Jeff&#39;s mind suddenly went blank. Brad was holding the controller and its wiring harness – Jeff&#39;s brain and spiral cord– in his hands. He cracked it open to look at the circuitry, to see if he could tell how it worked. He pulled a couple of the circuit boards out; looked them over, and then jammed them back in.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a bit over my head,&quot; replied Brad. &quot;Hope I got them back in the right spot.&quot; He tossed it into the pile of random electrical parts. By the end of class, Jeff has been completely disassembled into all this component parts. His body was strewn all across the auto shop.<br />
Coach Dodds, who had been sitting in back reading a magazine, realized what a huge mess it was.<br />
&quot;All right class – Mr. Osborne probably won&#39;t like this being left such a mess. Why don&#39;t you bin all the parts you can in the supply room and pile up the rest of the random parts in the corner. I don&#39;t see how he will get this junk back together in one piece, so it might as well be used to spare parts.&quot;<br />
The students hurriedly picked up all that they could, and tried to sort them in the supply room. Since they were freshmen, they didn&#39;t get it quite right. Jeff&#39;s engine bolts got mixed in with trim features, and electrical wiring got mixed in with all the hoses. A lot of his gaskets and wiring just got thrown away as they had been ripped during the removal process.<br />
Coach Dodds picked up a fender, and noticed the new paint job. &quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; he said. &quot;It looks like this was a nice jeep under all the mud.&quot;<br />
Greg walked in after lunch, going to check on Jeff. At first he thought his senior buddies were playing a trick on him; and had moved Jeff somewhere else. Then he noticed the pile of random parts on the corner.<br />
This looks like just parts! How could this have happened?<br />
Greg rushed into Mr. Osborne&#39;s office, only to find the note for the teacher sub. Greg panicked – how would he ever find all of Jeff&#39;s component parts? And – did the disassembly kill Jeff?<br />
He pulled out his phone and immediately called his dad.</p>
