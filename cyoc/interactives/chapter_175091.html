<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I am going to do it.” Announced Kat as she looked at the holographic image of Amanda who still floated in her hand. She downed her last of her whiskey and shock her head. “Amanda is there, and it is a world where lesbians are treated as equals.”<br />
<br />
She then laughed a bit.<br />
<br />
“Hell knowing me, I will find something to protest against?” said Kat as she began counting on her fingers. “I think I have been arrested 7 times for protesting different things mostly those damn oil companies and offshore drilling.”<br />
<br />
“What about your family?” inquired Angelia <br />
<br />
“I came from a family of religious freaks like Amanda and I was disowned by them when I came out.” Stated Kat “so screw them, they will be happy to hear that I am dead, just like Amanda&#39;s folks will be once they learn she is a lesbian.”<br />
<br />
“I am going as well.” said Karen as she looked at Angelia with some sadness in her eyes. “I lost my husband, I will not lose my daughter. I will lose everything else on land, but I will not lose my daughter.”<br />
<br />
“What about you?” inquired Kat<br />
<br />
“I…I don’t know.” said Angelia as she wondered how she would be able to pass on the message that Rose is fine to everyone back on the land. She wasn’t sure what to do now, if she said no, they said they would return her to the shore and remove her memories about what happened but then she would have to explain how two people died/gone missing and she was still around. On the other hand, if she said yes she would be losing her family whom she loved along with her whole life on land. Still Taylor and Rose where basically sisters to her and closer to her then her actual sister but not by much. Karen was like the Aunt she never had. As she weighed her options one thing became clear…she could not do it. She had too much to lose on land and while being with her friends in a magical world seamed great, she wasn’t going to give it up.<br />
<br />
“I can’t do it.” said Angelia as Karen nodded and pulled her into a hug. <br />
<br />
“I will miss you so much, but I can’t leave my daughter.” apologized Karen as Angelia shook her head and with tears in her eyes.<br />
<br />
“I will miss you.” Said Angelia as she waved toward Amara who floated on the other side of the magical bubble of air at the bottom of the sea. <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Said Amara as stuck her head in, the water flowing around her like it was a waterfall.<br />
<br />
“The two of us.” Said Kat as she pointed at herself and Karen. “Are going to become mermaids…Angelia wants to go back to the land.”<br />
<br />
“Very well…Angelia do you wish to record a message to Rose and the rest of your friends before we send you back?” inquired Amara <br />
<br />
“Yes…thank you.” said Angelia as Amara pulled out a small disk which looked like a copy of the one which had the message from Rose and handed it to Angelia. <br />
<br />
“Hit the square button and it will start recording.” Explained Amara as she looked at Karen and Kat. <br />
<br />
“So how does this work? Do you wave your hands and we become mermaids?” inquired Karen<br />
<br />
“No.” said Amara before grinning a bit. “I will wave my hands and open a portal; you will be taken through and the process of becoming a mermaid will begin. It isn’t a painless process…”<br />
<br />
Over a small amount of time Amara explained the basic idea of the process, the joining of the holy animal and the merging of it with their bodies. That the changes will take a few days, both women who had agreed to become merfolk where not happy to hear about the painful part of the transformation but agreed to it either way. <br />
<br />
“Done.” Said Angelia as she handed the disk back to Amara who took it and put it into her pouch. “Now what?”<br />
<br />
“Now we send you back…with some cover to explain how these two disappeared.” said Amara as blue energy began to gather around her hand before she touched the side of Angelia’s face.<br />
<br />
Water was crashing against her as she felt a pair of strong arms pull her out of the water.<br />
<br />
“CALL 911.” Yelled a male voice as Angelia groaned a bit as she was lied down on the beach.<br />
<br />
“Miss…miss are you alright?” inquired the same male voice as Angelia looked up into the dark sky. <br />
<br />
“Ah…what happened?” inquired Angelia, her head was pounding and her whole body was wet and tired like she had been in a fight.<br />
<br />
“You where trying to save a life and almost died yourself.” answered the man as Angelia looked up to see an older man with his family behind him. <br />
<br />
“Yes…we saw it, you tried to save both of those women.” said the wife of this man as she was holding a cell phone up to her ear. “Strangest thing both where just walking into the surface saying they needed to join their loved ones and one bashed you on a head with a bottle.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Angelia as she touched her hand to her head. For a moment she felt pain but also came a voice, a voice of her friend Rose filled her mind, “everyone is fine.” For some reason that voice was more real than the bump on her head and a small amount to blood which came from a cut on her head. <br />
<br />
Just within sight of land, Amara had her head above water as her hands stopped glowing as the small illusion, she had put up ended. The illusion of Karen and Kat doing suicide was not something she really liked doing but it was the easiest way to explain Karen’s and Kat’s disappearance. Grief stricken people who had lost so much ending their lives. With that done she pulled her head under the water to see the guards and aids waiting for her. Karen and Kat where already transported to their world and likely already have already started the process of becoming mermaids. <br />
<br />
“So Princess what is next?” inquired a guard</p>
