<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a very ungraceful way Jillian Haze wiggled into a pair of pantiehose before digging out a wedgie from her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is such fucking bull shit.&quot; she thought to herself having been in this form for a few days.<br />
<br />
Jillian Haze used to be Gillion Haze. An adjunct English professor at Immersion University from before it was Immersion U. They had worked there for 5 years and were close to finally getting a full position as a real professor and not just an adjunct professor. Gillian was in his early 30s and was very good looking and decently fit man. He used to play lacrosse when he was in school and didn&#39;t work out too much anymore, but all those years of being fit growing up lead him to have a bit of a dad bod now. It only really added to his older hot professor vibe that he had been going for. He was for sure one of the favorites of the female students on campus and even some of the other staff. There was also a lot of rumors he used to sleep with some of his students in some of his classes. They were all true of course having slept with a handful of students to boost their grades or get a recommendation. What made this even more despicable is he had a long time girlfriend for the past four years who was really hoping he&#39;d ask her to marry him soon. He really wasn&#39;t looking forward to this whole immersion thing, but he really wanted the added money of being a full time professor and he would be up for the job next year when he knew an opening was coming up as one of the professors in the English department was set to retire.<br />
<br />
He had come in two weeks ago to get their pass. He had only seen the administration office staff around and didn&#39;t know what kind of pass he was going to be getting, but all of the old women who normally worked in the office were now a bunch of identical looking milfs in various outfits. He wondered if he would get changed in a similar way, but as a man of course. As he got there and spoke to the admin office, and she gave him a sexy once over before she typed away. She then looked surprised, then smirked a moment looking almost smug before handing him his ID and then directing him to go, and he was told he was getting the pass all adjunct professors were getting. She asked him about his office hours and he shrugged.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Just leave them open I tell all my kids to just email me when ever and I get back usually within a day.&quot; he said with a nod. This kind of thing wasn&#39;t too uncommon since most professors kind of set their own rules.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Really?&quot; she seemed to almost be holding back a laugh as she typed something in and then printed out a new ID for him to activate. Moving over to the Immersion Booth he slide the ID in and felt a tingle run over and it a picture was now shown on the ID along with the name Jillian Haze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what?&quot; she heard her voice looking down and gasping a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what!?&quot; she looked around trying to find her reflection in the large office windows, before she realized she was looking at her new self. Gone was his 6&#39;2&quot; masculine frame and handsome face. Standing there now was a short 4&#39;11&quot; woman. Her skin pale and bordering on pasty. Her hair was light brown and waving only being shoulder length. She had a cute face but the thick glasses and the beak like nose on her face kind of lowered her overall looks a good bit. She was wearing a white blouse and grey skirt along with some nude pantyhose and some grey heels. Build wise she was pretty thin, but not fit having a bit of a soft pudge around her front belly, but it still looking mostly flat. Curve wise she had no real hips and very small bust and butt. She also looked a good bit younger maybe 23 or 25 at most. She nearly fell down as she stumbled back not noticing how she was effortlessly able to move in heels.<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what... what...&quot; she kept saying completely stunned. The woman at the desk suddenly busted out laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bhahaha!&quot; she moved her hand to wipe one of her eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.. its just... the girls wont believe this when I tell them.... hahaha!&quot; she said laughing again seeming to enjoy seeing the formally cocky Professor Haze reduced to this tiny mousey woman. The women then went on to explain and eventually argue with Professor Haze as they demanded to change back and she explained how their pass worked.<br />
<br />
They have some autopilot mannerisms to help them that never go away, but once the semester starts there would a bit more autopilot during her classes and office times. Unlike some other professors who have limited set office hours and are able to turn back when off campus her pass would stay on since her hours were all the time. The only thing that was deactivate was some of the mental and autopilot settings when she wasn&#39;t working, but would kick in when on the phone or writing emails if she was responding to work stuff. She asked and then demanded and then begged to let her change her office hours, but the woman seemed to enjoy saying that they cant change them until next semester at the earliest.<br />
<br />
Eventually she stormed off heading home. She had spent the past week hiding in her apartment and having to spend some of her own money on some new clothes and various other things for her current situation. Even more then the upcoming first day of school today what she was most dreading was how to tell her girlfriend. She had managed to avoid her the past two weeks, but she was getting more and more fed up.</p>
