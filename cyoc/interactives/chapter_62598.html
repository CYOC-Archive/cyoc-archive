<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica amused herself manipulating the picture a little, testing out the different slider bars and entering different values in the options.  Whoever had made this program either had a twisted sense of humor or was a bit of a perv because she could do some pretty outrageous things to the figure on the side of the screen.<br />
<br />
She leaned back in her chair, looking at the figure on the screen.  Her mind wandered back to Brian, the guy who had dumped her.  Sure, he was a prick, but he was a hot prick.  Just thing about him got her frustrated.  Enough that she decided to make the figure on the screen into a hot guy.  If she couldn't have the guy she wanted, at the very least she could make a fantasy guy she could relieve a little pressure to.<br />
<br />
She set to work, clicking first to switch the figure to male.  The female figure she had been messing with changed into a male one instantly.  She browsed over the options carefully, 21 years old sounded good to her.  She adjusted the body type to be athletic, then with a sly grin slid the body type bar a bit more, watching as the muscles on the figure bulged outwards.  She slid the height bar until it read 6'2&quot;, the figure on the screen stretching a little.  Zooming in on the face, she began to mess with the features.  She wanted something nice and masculine, a strong jaw.  Bright blue eyes and pitch black hair in a spiked buzz cut.<br />
<br />
She zoomed back out to the full body view.  There were a whole series of body hair sliders.  She normally didn't go for guys with hair, but since she was just messing around for something to look at she decided to mess with those.  She gave her creation a nice covering of dark chest hair, and a trail going up his abs.  She also made sure to give him arm and leg hair, and a not too dense pubic bush.  Though she left the back and shoulder hair options alone, still she couldn't resist adding a little bit too the ass.  She had to admit the hair looked good, maybe she should give guys like that a chance.  She gave him a bit of stubble, and a bit more scruff on his chin.  Then she found the final set of sliders, the ones that controled the cock.  She slid first the testicle bar until the figure had a pair the size of lemons hanging from his crotch.  She slid the cock length next, letting it grow to what the program said was a foot long flacid cock, a full fourteen inches hard.  She clicked the option for uncircumsized, and a foreskin appeared over the head.  She'd never be able to take that in real life, but it was just a fantasy, and she could pretend whatever she wanted.<br />
<br />
She had to admit, her creation was hot.  Simply looking at it she could feel the heat rise in her, her hand sliding down her pants to lightly stroke at her slit.  As her finger slid inside her she leaned her head back and gave a soft moan.  She placed her other hand on the desk, her finger accidently brushing a key on the keyboard.  She didn't notice the screen display the message 'Transformation Initializing.'<br />
<br />
Her jeans began to become uncomfortably tight.  She undid the fly, and tugged them down so they pooled on the floor around her ankles.  She slid her fingers inside her again, but this time they met against resistance.  After a few seconds, her slit had completely disappeared.  Panicked, she looked down on her own crotch, only to notice a small fleshy bump sticking out from her groin.  Curiously, she touched it, shivering as a tingle ran through her much like when she played with her clit.  She began to rub at the flesh as it grew outwards, and after it had reached a few inches she wrapped her hand around it, her previous worry overridden by the pleasure this growth caused.  It began to take on the familiar shape of a cock, hard and rigid and still growing in thickness and length, soon the tip peeked out the top of her closed hand.  A strange tingling between her legs brought her hand down to beneath the new shaft.  A wrinkled bit of skin had formed down there, and as she felt it it grew larger.  That continued to grow along with her new cock until a large wrinkled sac hung beneath her, then with a sudden strange feeling she felt two balls drop out of her bosy to fill the sac.  They were the size of golf balls, but as she cupped them they continued to grow.<br />
<br />
Her eyes widened as her new cock started growing past six inches, dwarfing her already dainty hands.  Though that seemed to be changing.  Her slender fingers grew thicker and larger as her finely manicured nails turned plain and short.  Her hands grew wider, a couple inches of her cock disappearing inside her new larger hands.  A bit of dark hair dreq on the backs of those new hands.  A look further down her body revealed similar changes to her feet.  Once small and feminine they were now big size fourteens, a bit of dark hair on their tops.<br />
<br />
As her cock reached eight inches, even her larger hands had trouble keeping fingers touching around the new girdth, the heavy balls in her hand still swelling.  The changes moved up her arms and legs.  Thin and slender, they began to swell with new muscle.  Her elbows began to stick out further to the side as her arms lengthened, and she could feel her heels slide against the floor as they were pushed further away by her larger legs.  A tingling started around her wrists and ankles, her normally fine arm hair was growing thicker and darkening, spreading slowly up her arms to just below her now strong biceps.  Though the hair growing in on her shaved legs didn't stop just past the knee, it continued growing up her thighs, a tingling on her ass telling her some had grown back there as well.<br />
<br />
As her cock neared the ten inch mark, plum sized balls heavy in her hands more parts of her began to change.  Her hips shrank, while her waist expanded, loosing her slight hourglass figure to a more masculine v shape.  She shoulders pushed her arms away from her body even more.  The tight shirt she had been wearing stretched and finally gave a loud rip as the seams gave way, exposing her expanding chest.  A burning in her face brought the hand from her sac up to her face.  She felt the planes of her features change right under her fingers, strong masculine traits developing on her face.  A heavy jaw and a strong nose, even her brow felt heavier.  A twitch in her new cock brought her hand back soon enough.  The long blond hair that had been in her view began to turn dark black even as it pulled back into her head.  The weight of her long hair vanishing as it pulled itself into a spikey short trim.<br />
<br />
The cock in her hands had by now reached twelve inches.  Her breasts began to recede into her chest, her nipples shrinking as they did.  Soon her chest was flat with no sign she had ever even had breasts, though soon her chest was pushing out again, though this time with the hard muscle of pectorals.  Her already taught stomach gained more definition, a clear six pack showing under her skin.  Her pubic bush became hairier as more dark hairs began to creep their way up between her abs, a thick dark treasure trail working its way up towards her chest.  Dark hairs grew in around her nipples, a few more growing in between her pecs.  An itching all along her jaw was what she could only assume was facial hair growing in.<br />
<br />
The fourteen inch cock in her hands was straining hard, thick around as a beer can, and her balls hung full and heavy between her spread legs, large as lemons.  The muscles all over her body began to expand, moving her past the lean athletic frame she had a moment ago.  Her biceps bulged, pushing out the veins in her arms.  Her pecs were to hard plates of muscle, a tight eight pack beneath.  Her legs were strong and muscular, bursting with power, even her ass was dense with hard muscle.  The hair on her chest grew outwards, the bit in the center meeting with that around her nipples and connecting to her treasure trail.  Soon her pecs were covered in a thick patch of curly dark black hair.<br />
<br />
She through her head back, and with a deep baritone shout, shot a thick stream of cum right into the hair on her chest.  It kept coming, shot after shot of thick cream shooting into her body hair as the orgasm swept over her.  Going slack in the chair, it was a few minutes before she could open her eyes again.  Her cock lay heavy and flacid between her legs, a foot of meat with a foreskin hiding the red glans.  She got to her feet, moving over to the full length mirror on her closet door.  Staring back at her was the figure she had made from the program, with the addition of thick amounts of cum drying in his chest hair.<br />
<br />
Jess grinned to herself, or was it himself now?  He certainly felt like a guy now.  Perhaps he could have some fun with this new body...</p>
