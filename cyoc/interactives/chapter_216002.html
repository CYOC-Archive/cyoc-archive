<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scarlet had been driving for what seemed like forever in her car as Tanya looked over at her from the passenger side and looked away with a blush. Tanya had been wanting to say something to the woman for a while now since Scarlet hand &quot;thanked&quot; her early on Valentine&#39;s Day. Scarlet had told her that she knew a place that Tanya would love to see, only she couldn&#39;t say anything to her about where they were going just yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re practically driving out to the middle of nowhere. Please tell me you&#39;re not taking me to see your family and that they&#39;re all bloodthirsty hillbillies.&quot; Tanya joked and begged at the same time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay first of all, that&#39;s a very old movie trope and I&#39;ve met plenty of country folk in my line of work. Secondly, no, I&#39;m not from the country at all. I grew up a suburban girl. Dad was the human, my mom was the succubus, but she did from a country family, but moved to the city. So I guess I&#39;m partially a country girl, but I&#39;ve always preferred city life.&quot; Scarlet explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why...the work?&quot; Tanya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I had planned on moving a few years back. But I became great friends with Bella and...Trixie. Trixie was the one who introduced Bella and me to each other. She was the one who helped pick us up when the two of us were down. The three of us became like sisters and I couldn&#39;t just leave my sisters, I was waiting for something to change my mind about leaving.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An opportunity?&quot; Tanya asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I suppose you could say that, or something that changed my views on life.&quot; Scarlet said as she then noticed a &#39;Dead End&#39; sign on it with a red marking on it and turned down the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, you realize you just went down a dead end road, right? There&#39;s literally nothing this way.&quot; Tanya commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, there&#39;s something.&quot; Scarlet said as she drove further down the road and the daylight became harder to see as the trees looked like they were almost closing in.<br />
<br />
Scarlet finally stopped in front of a tree with one of the largest trunks that Tanya had ever seen. Scarlet stepped out and began looking around the tree feeling around every inch of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet, I don&#39;t want to say that you&#39;ve completely lost it, but I think that you&#39;ve....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Found it!&quot; Scarlet said as she had her left hand on one side of the tree that was on the opposite side of where the car was parked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just, put your right hand on the other side close to where mine is and you&#39;ll see, trust me.&quot; Scarlet said holding Tanya&#39;s left hand gently.<br />
<br />
Tanya put her right hand on the tree close to Scarlet&#39;s and suddenly there was a rumble below where their hands were as a small doorway large enough for both of them to crawl through appeared. Scarlet motioned for Tanya to follow her and she did and crawled through following her. When Tanya came out of the other side, she noticed she had changed into her succubus form without realizing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet, where are we?&quot; Tanya asked looking around at their surroundings to see that they had emerged into what looked like an oasis, but there was an open sky above them and Tanya smelled the air and it smelled fresh and lively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya, welcome to...&#39;Nirvana&#39;. This is a secret paradise that only those who are a succubus can reach, well, a succubi and their special someone.&quot; Scarlet said gently holding Tanya&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Scarlet then pulled Tanya excitedly to the lake in the middle where they jumped in and splashed to their hearts content. They then teased each other by following the other underneath a water fall. After drying themselves off, they ran together through a field of flowers feeling the grass between their toes. Tanya pretended to trip, then when Scarlet came over to check on her, she cheekily pulled her in close for a kiss. They lay down together on the grass and looked up at the sky, it was full of white clouds and she couldn&#39;t hear anything in the distance of vehicles of any kind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet, how can a succubus or succubi have made a place like this?&quot; Tanya asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they didn&#39;t do it alone, I can tell you that. I can&#39;t tell you exactly how it started, but there&#39;s an old children&#39;s bed time story passed on from succubus to succubus about a succubus from an early age falling in love with a powerful witch/sorcerer. The story changes as to whether the two were of different genders or the same gender, but either way, they created a place for the succubi to go that was a paradise for them, instead of a stripper&#39;s club or brothel.&quot; Scarlet explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, if more people in the supernatural world saw this they would....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They would do what many have done, they&#39;d take a place like this and ruin what makes it special to us. It&#39;s only meant for us, because we see so much violence in the world, that we want a picturesque moment of peace.&quot; Scarlet said.<br />
<br />
Tanya wanted to argue with her, but she knew she was right that many beautiful places in the world have been colonized over time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides being a witch, what else did you want in life?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, I was still kind of young when I was killed. I thought it would be kind of fun, when I started possessing this woman&#39;s body because I could act like the adult instead of my mom. But as long as we&#39;ve been here, I&#39;ve kind of been feeling sad about it. My mom never got to see me grow up, I never got to grow up, I&#39;ll never have a family of my own. These magic users we&#39;re associating with, they have family and loved ones and that&#39;s something I&#39;ll never have now.&quot; Tanya explained sad.<br />
<br />
Scarlet thought for a minute and helped her up to her feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have another loved one: me.&quot; Scarlet said holding Tanya&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya, my time here is still limited. Once my mother and I complete our mission, we go back to the after life and our souls can rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but you can still take something back with you. My love for you.&quot; Scarlet said as she and Tanya embraced in a kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanya, thanks to you, I know what I want to do. I want to live my life to the fullest. I&#39;m going to leave strip clubs and all that behind me. I know where I&#39;m going, a place like this. There&#39;s beautiful country sides and I want to find one where I&#39;ll fit in just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you preferred the suburban lifestyle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do, but I want something that will always remind me of you.&quot; Scarlet said holding her close.<br />
<br />
&quot;If there&#39;s an afterlife, can you grant me a request from the other side?&quot; Scarlet asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you reincarnated into a woman like the one I&#39;ve grown to love. It doesn&#39;t have to be you exactly, but someone like you. Just someone who&#39;ll come sit down next to me the town&#39;s local bar and ask me: &#39;Is this seat taken?&#39;&#39; Scarlet requested.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but we&#39;ll see what the future holds in store.&quot; Tanya said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What should we do now?&quot; Scarlet asked as Tanya smirked.<br />
<br />
In an empty field, in a hidden forest of nirvana, two women shared their passion together for what felt like a life time just saying &#39;I love you&#39; until reality called them back.</p>
