<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark found a vial deep within the crate that was separate the vial was  labeled as “Bunny Anthro: experimental ” Mark always has a thing with bunnies their fluffy tail, long ears, and buck teeth to eat delicious carrots, but an anthro bunny he couldn’t believe it. <br />
<br />
Without question he soon began to drink the orange liquid in the vial and began to wait for his transformation to begin. After about a few minutes he began to lose hope that he will transform and began to feel hungry. He soon walked to his kitchen and opened his fridge to see if there was anything good to eat. As he searches through the fridge he came across a bag of baby carrots which he used for his salad when he had to diet. It oddly gave out a rather nice smell as Mark’s mouth began to water, soon snapping out of a trance-like state he wiped his mouth and grabbed the bag and sat on his bed still naked.<br />
<br />
Mark began to munch on the baby carrots which tasted absolutely extraordinary, before Mark always ate the baby carrots last, at least tiny bites of it as it tasted horrible. Then he just throw it in the trash never to be seen again. Now Mark could devour the carrot like it was his favorite food. As Mark was enjoying snacking on the delicious baby carrots he didn’t realize that his two front teeth began to elongate to better suit his carrot eating habit. Mark was slowly but surely becoming a anthro bunny....female.<br />
<br />
As Mark was finishing the last of the baby carrots his body soon became very slender more feminine like as he soon wanted more of that delicious carrots he soon started to put on his clothes oblivious as he given up on transforming into an anthro bunny although it was very loose as his pants fell to the floor which he didn’t question as he was thinking about his yummy baby carrots. <br />
<br />
Mark then walked to the fridge and opened to find an unopened bag of  baby carrots which he screamed to himself as he began to tear into the bag and munch the sweet baby carrots inside, as he bit into the carrot he was overwhelmed with tastes, each bite was a slice of nirvana, like a cloud full of flavor. Mark busy with eating, was also oblivious to his crotch as his penis and balls began  to merge together, soon turning orange as it simply popped out soon revealing a cleft as it soon became a giant carrot. Mark looked down to see a giant carrot by his feet but more importantly a giant cleft to where his penis was supposed to be he soon began to touch the rim as he felt the strong sensation sweeping over him. He gasped and fell back in awe, the inital shock was then filled by overwhelming happiness. <br />
<br />
Mark soon ate more carrots as he knew that was the cause as he ate, his butt and chest were soon growing. His butt began to feel amazing as it became rounder and more feminine before growing out a white bunny tail which he touched. Soon his chest began to burst as 2 mounds formed under his shirt which soon began to grow to at least a DDD cup which now Mark was now a her, she soon gripped her breast in awe a a wave of sensation hit her. Mark...no Mark is a guy I’m a girl I will be called Mary as she enjoyed herself.<br />
<br />
Mary soon stopped playing with herself as she sniffed the baby carrots soon eating it as she ate her hair soon became longer before changing into a blonde tone as her skin soon starting growing fur. She was becoming a full bunny anthro as white fur soon began to spread from her tail as she was being covered her feet soon began to change into that of a bunny elongating as his main toe soon shifted to the middle of his foot and his 2 smaller toes soon merge to create 4 toes as it became covered in fur as she felt the sensations her face began to change a little bit as her face slightly stretched into a muzzle as her nose soon became pink as she was getting covered she was slightly growing taller. When she was finished with the baby carrots Mary was a full anthro rabbit but as she forgotten her shirt was stretched to its limit. Her breast were as big or slightly bigger than the shirt as it wasn’t doing very well as covering. She soon admired herself until she looked at what was a big carrot which was her penis. She soon sniffed and wanted to eat it but soon held herself back wanting to try another vial.</p>
