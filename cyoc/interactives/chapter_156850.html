<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia waited on her chair in the sitting room as her last client of the evening had yet to arrive. This one unlike many of the others had insisted on the late hour and anonymity, at least in name. As time slowly ticked past, she yawned feeling the edge of boredom creeping ever closer. She could start up the game and continue from where she had left off but that might just summon the client forth as it started. So as she eyed the console nestled in its once friend, she sighed and rolled her eyes. Next came the tapping... Tap... Tap.. Tap. Her finger impatiently counting the time faster and faster until at last, the knock came at the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Send them in Marina...&quot; Selicia said as she straightened herself in her chair. Couldn&#39;t let them see that side of her after all. She appraised the rough looking man as his eyes wandered from window to chair then lingered hungrily on her collection before those predatory eyes fell on her. This at a glance could be noted as not the kind of man one would want in their home and much less uninvited... A mop of unkempt dirty brown hair hung over those deep set eyes so full of hunger. His rickety grin that he may have thought passed for a welcoming smile did nothing to save his appearance. Above all was his abhorrently unattended wardrobe, likely he lived on the streets themselves... A mental note was made to have that couch -thoroughly- cleaned as he lounged atop it. <br />
<br />
Clearing her throat, Selicia transitioned into the business at hand before her judgment got the better of her. &quot;So, Sir... What has brought you to me? Is it betterment?&quot; She went straight for that remark considering his condition. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s something you desire? Maybe even... Someone?&quot; She held her business face well as the man scratched his chest and kicked his foot onto the sofa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want just one thing, girlie. Power. Plain and simple, you can give it to me... Can&#39;t ya?&quot; He eyed Selicia with vague disinterest as if he were the one in control here.<br />
<br />
Power... How very... Bland... Oh well, let&#39;s see what we have to work with here, Selicia thought to herself. &quot;Power? Power to do what exactly? It may be within me to do so.&quot; She bridged her fingers on her lap to keep them from slipping too soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple, I want revenge on a certain someone but, I want to do it myself... After that? I want to use it to have my way with the world?&quot; His rickety grin widened into one dripping with barely contained malice. &quot;So... Can you do it? Or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Admittedly, her last few encounters for her work were... Uninspired... To say the least. Maybe giving someone else the reins would chase off some of the doldrums. However, she couldn&#39;t just let that person go unsupervised in HER territory... With a mental shrug, she let a smug grin cross her face and her eyes fill to the brim with haughty air. &quot;Of course I can, you doubt me?&quot; With a snap of her fingers, thin purple lines flowed through the air from her hands to his. &quot;A simple enough request, now be a dear and be on with it.&quot; <br />
<br />
His chest swelled as the magic flowed into him from those lines. A look in his eyes told Selicia that he&#39;d become drunk on just that amount. He stood flexing his hands and gave her a sharp evaluating look before wisely deciding not to try. &quot;I&#39;m going to make that bitch pay for ruining my life...&quot; His grin fled into a nasty glower before he remembered where he was. &quot;Thanks Lady, I&#39;ll be in touch...&quot; He waved nonchalantly and wandered out of the door on his own accord.<br />
<br />
Waiting for what felt an appropriate amount of time, Selicia stood and brushed off her dress with her hands. Stepping out of the room, Marina was on standby just to the other side as always. Slipping her shoes on, Selicia regarded Marina as she straightened once more. &quot;Marina dear, I&#39;m going out for a while. Don&#39;t expect me back for some time, so hold my appointments until I return.&quot; With an affirmative nod from Marina, Selicia stepped out into the dark and disappeared behind the closed door.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cera Petrov is 25 years old and stands at a height of 6&#39;2&quot; with raven black hair kept in a bob cut. She suffered from the commonly known condition of resting bitch face which was not helped by her piercing blue eyes. She kept her figure under wraps figuratively and literally as it was a point of contention for her. On the one hand, she was graced or cursed with sizable E cups but, the rest of her body was firm with muscles and she was even getting a faint six pack. Considering that the majority of men went for the soft and petite type, at least that was the Internet&#39;s opinion, she felt self conscious about it. This led to binding and showing as little skin as possible especially in the form of long sleeves and pants.<br />
<br />
She had an impressive track record of cases closed thanks to a family history of similar professions and her physical fitness. Sitting in her office she has reopened a file that she had thought was closed for good. Alex Forger had escaped from prison and was once again on the loose. That being said, he must&#39;ve been laying low since no crimes following his particular MO had cropped up since then. It didn&#39;t help her settle considering that at any time a poor woman could be taken by him at any time. Reading through the file to find any possibility of a hint to where he may be hiding, she was drawn out of thought by a knock at the door. As she approached the door, she saw a slip of paper had been shoved under the frame and a quick examination outside showed noone to be around.<br />
<br />
Opening the paper that had been delivered, she was met with the atypical cutout print. &#39;COme tO thE AbaNDoneD FaCtORy @ 9Pm AlONe&#39; She knew who it could be from almost immediately and felt only mildly concerned he&#39;d been right on the other side of her door. It wasn&#39;t terribly concerning since her office address was publicly advertised but, if she&#39;d been just a little faster... Oh well, nothing could be done about that now, she&#39;d just have to spring the trap and bring him in once again. Alex wasn&#39;t exactly what you&#39;d call bright and certainly not athletic but, he had a way of getting the jump on people. Knowing that, she waited until the time had come to leave and strapped on all of her gear. Handcuffs, taser, pepper spray, the works... Even her pistol just in case he got the balls to attack her. With all her preparations settled, she locked her door and marched into the obvious trap.<br />
<br />
The old factory sat at the edge of the town and was a relic of bygone times. It sat abandoned even before she was born as the owners followed cheaper labor elsewhere. Keeping her eyes on the shadows and head on a swivel, she entered the old shipping yard when she saw a silhouette enter the light of her flashlight. Sure as it was, there was Alex standing with the exact same smugness he had before she caught him last time. Straightening to her full height she kept her free hand over her pistol and the light trained on Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, you really should&#39;ve picked your battles... Coming straight for me? What do you think this is? Some kind of old detective movie? Look, just give yourself over to me and we&#39;ll call this a night without another futile chase.&quot; She took a few steps forward and then stopped as she saw Alex standing his ground, something was different this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady, I came to you first because I wanted you take responsibility before I got back to work. I -really- didn&#39;t appreciate getting sent to jail, ya know. Too many men, not enough women... Anyway, I can tell you this isn&#39;t going to happen like last time, ya see I got better. Much better, in fact, you could say I&#39;ve got the power.&quot; With that last statement purple lines faded into view from the darkness and into his hands.<br />
<br />
Cera felt a prickle in her skin as the strange phenomena unfolded before her and instinct told her to open fire. She would have, except she&#39;d suddenly found herself handcuffed and suspended off the ground by a tall post that&#39;d come from nowhere. Looking over her shoulder, she was dumbfounded by the sight of a larger than life set of scales. The handcuffs were looped over the top of the pillar and held up by the balance beam. Snaking downward from the cuffs was another section of chain that reach her ankles forming a second set of cuffs. A cry of pain and surprise snapped out of her as the chain sharply retracted forcing her legs behind her forming a &#39;C&#39; with her body. <br />
<br />
Helplessly, she watched as demented glee was awash on Alex&#39;s face, the magical glow enough to illuminate it. Her flashlight had fallen out of her hand and come to a rest at the base of the scales. Alex approached her, licking his lips as another change took place on her body. Her clothing and gear started to blow into dust on an unseen wind until was left presenting her nude form to this vile man. Once he was stood before her, he grimaced as she stared down at him with what little defiance she could muster in this state. He tapped his chin thoughtfully as he took in the sight of her prostrated body before speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is just amazing, it&#39;s just missing a few things though. For one, I feel like you&#39;ve still got too much fight in you. Let&#39;s fix that first...&quot; He held out his hand and the magic coalesced into a long sword of all things!<br />
<br />
Terror finally struck deep into Cera&#39;s heart as Alex leveled the sword below her vagina. Here she was helpless and about to be quite literally skewered! Before she could open her mouth to make a plea, he thrust upward. Cera screamed as the sword parted her vaginal lips and spread wide the opening as it traveled upward. As painful as it was, she could feel her insides shaping around the blade until the hilt was pressed against her roughly. Likely due to the magic, she was now no more than a glorified living sheathe for the sword thrust inside of her. She panted heavily and dumbly as her tongue hung out of her mouth letting drool dribble onto her breasts.<br />
<br />
As she started to regain her wits, she was met with another sight straight out of the story books. Alex was growing in size before her eyes, for a short time they looked levelly into each others eyes. It wasn&#39;t until she had to look up at him that her muddled mind realized that it was she that was shrinking. Her size stopped decreasing as she reached a height where she stared directly into his shin. His huge hand wrapped around the base of the scale and lifted her up before his face where that dark glee had taken a horrifyingly new perspective. Holding the scale up with one hand, his right hand loomed in and rubbed her once sizable breasts under it&#39;s index finger. Mustering her defiance for one last blow against she bit his giant finger moaning through her teeth as the ridges of his finger tip ground her tiny nipples. Her defiance was met with a growl and the finger retracted for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still a feisty little bitch are ya? Well, we&#39;ll fix that yet.&quot; A malice soaked grin accentuated those words as the fingered pinched the hilt of the now tiny sword. Barely a second later, the sword was thrusting inside her without being fully drawn. Her mind began to swim again despite her best efforts to hold against the sensation. After a few minutes, the thrusting stopped following a mind numbing orgasm. Fluid pattered to his left hand as she hung limply off of the scales. The fingers returned to her body and face smearing her fluids over her body while a booming chuckle sounded through the haze. There was a glow of purple light and starting from her feet her body started to feel hard and cold. <br />
<br />
The sensation crept slowly and almost sultry up her calves and thighs, fluid steadily dribbled out of her as it reached mid thigh. Reaching her vagina, the feeling caused her to gasp as the cold over took the sensitive region. Once it reached just under her breasts, she glanced numbly downward to find that her body was taking on the green color of oxidized copper. She wanted to panic or struggle but, she&#39;d been left drained after being toyed with at the hands of this evil man. So she stared into those gleeful eyes and waited for a miracle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That just won&#39;t do... Don&#39;t look at me like that, you deserve every bit of this after all. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll fix this now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another flow of purple light and Cera was left in a world of darkness. A cloth had appeared over her eyes blindfolding her to the change overtaking her breasts. She gasped again falling off into a moan as the hardened nipples felt the sharp bite of the cold change. As she hung her head in defeat, she thought about what she&#39;d been through over the years. All that success, just to end up some scumbag&#39;s trophy, literally... The change stiffened her chin as it rose to her face and before it got any further. There was a clink of metal on metal as the sword snapped outward and back into its new sheathe. So as much as she&#39;d have preferred to appear dour in her final moments, she moaned loudly. Her face froze in that final moan as the change finalized, her entirety was now a decoration on the symbol of justice. Just as she thought her mind would slip into oblivion bringing her an end, she felt the warm ridges of a finger tip rub her hardened breasts. Mentally she writhed, moaned, panted, and orgasmed under that despicable touch, her mind awash with ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Holding the fully shrunken and transformed detective in his hand, Alex allowed himself to revel in fondling her metal form. It wasn&#39;t quite as satisfying as he&#39;d have hoped for but, one thing was for sure. The bitch was out of his way and for good. Holding the scales in front of him, he made his decision. &quot;Ya know, if it wasn&#39;t for you putting my away like that, I&#39;d have enjoyed you more. Seeing as you made me suffer for so long though, I think I&#39;d rather put you where you really belong.&quot; He took her fallen flashlight and walked over to a pile of left behind refuse. &quot;Enjoy your new life, Trash.&quot; Tossing Cera&#39;s small form onto the pile, he turned and left the shipping yard full of new schemes.<br />
<br />
Hours had passed but, for Cera it had meant nothing. She couldn&#39;t quite form a straight thought at the occasional cold breeze ran across her sensitive exposed form. Suddenly her body felt warm as a soft hand wrapped around her body. Pleasure poured forth rocking her mind back into the haze but, before she was lost completely, she heard a feminine voice speak. &quot;Right where the note said it would be. Alright, time to get it where it needs to be.&quot; With that, the grip of that warm hand sent her mind reeling in euphoria.</p>
