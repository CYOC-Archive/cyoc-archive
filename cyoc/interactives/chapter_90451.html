<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thinking of what she can be, Janet decided what she wanted to be for a long time. She had tried out for the track team, but couldn’t pass it. She didn&#39;t have the drive, confidence, or strength to do well in sports. Well now, she could change that! She&#39;d be sporty, confident, and strong! Another reason why she never made the team is that she was too girly for that kind of stuff, so maybe she could be a tomboy too? Not only that, but it might be fun to change races, cause a white girl wouldn’t scream strong and confident.  Maybe she can be of African decent, they have the strength necessary.  She thought of her ideal track start: sexy, tomboyish, strong and confident. The amulet shined bright, and her transformation began!<br />
<br />
Once she got the vision of her ideal tracker self, Janet shuddered as the changes started. Her shirt felt a little bit tighter as her breasts began to expand. Her hair became a slightly darker color, and shortened as well. As her hair shortened, so did her skirt and stockings. Her skin began to darken, now looking tanned. The changes felt strange for Janet, but really bad.  She wondered why?<br />
<br />
Suddenly, and without warning, all of Janet&#39;s clothes disappeared and she was stalk naked! All she had left were her girly blue panties! Fortunately, it was now easier for her to see her changes in the mirror. Her hair got shorter yet again, and her bangs were now cut, though they looked quite rough. Her breasts continued to expand while her skin darkened as well. Janet was in a panic as she shrieked like the girl that she is, “EEEK!  This isn’t what I want!  I don’t want to be naked like this! This is so embarrassing!”<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s previous fear began to turn to anger.  “This amulet must&#39;ve been perverted or something!” she said as her mood changed into that was a rugged person, “When I find that store owner that gave me that necklace, I’m going to beat him up!”  Her body became much more muscled, as it now exemplified perfect physical fitness. Her hair changed style becoming much more rough and tumble. As her breasts continued to grow, very low cut jeans appeared around her waist. “This is so frustrating!” she said as her changes escalated her mood, “I’m so angry, I could just...run?  Yeah, that’s right, I’ll run.  Running did always make me relax, right?”<br />
<br />
Janet sighed in relief. Her sports bra appeared over her chest, covering her upper nude body.  Her hair changed styles, becoming more spiky and boyish. Her pants seemed to grow longer, though they still showed off nearly all of her legs. She felt far more confident now. Sure, she wasn&#39;t a girly girl, but she was pretty damn sexy! Not only that, but she knew how strong she truly was. She could take care of anything!  She could dominate anything she can put her mind to it.  Maybe she could even qualify for the track team after all.  All she needed to do is to let the changes finish washing over her and she’s good to go.<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s hair became even shorter, giving her a boyish cut that still looked great. As her hair darkened in color, her skin followed suit. If it wasn&#39;t obvious before, she was clearly of African descent. Her pants legs grew larger, making her feel more comfortable. Unfortunately, her breasts became larger as well, annoying her. Sure, there wasn&#39;t anything she could do about it, but these large breasts were a pain in the ass!  They got in the way of her running, and it was always hard to find shirts in her size. She didn&#39;t let the large weights on her chest stop her though. In fact, she just trained harder instead.  And the more she trained, the stronger she has become.  Soon she’ll be ready and once she entered the track team, she will conquer anything that throws at him.<br />
<br />
Janet&#39;s transformation was now complete! Her skin darkened further, looking very dark. Her shorts got even longer, now reaching her knees. A T-shirt just barely covered her massive breasts, but she still put it on. The breasts were certainly annoying. Still, it gave her a surprisingly sexy look. Her confidence though was now outstanding. She felt like nothing was impossible if she tried hard enough! After all, she was the ace of the school track team, and none could beat her at running. She wasn&#39;t a &quot;girly girl&quot;, but that didn&#39;t matter! Her energetic and friendly personality let her get along with anybody. She loved not having to wear lame dresses like most of the girls. Janet would surely be happy as a sexy, tough, fit, and confident tomboy!<br />
<br />
The world around her altered, as she wasn’t in her house anymore.  It looks like she was in an apartment complex in the Bronx and was filled with trophies.  Looking to one of them, she noticed a plaque on it that said ‘Jaha Holmes: 1st place’.  She was surprised that she now has a new name, but then her memories begin to alter as she was remembering being born in a bad neighborhood, that track and field is the only thing that can get her out of trouble, that all the training started to help her reach the top of the ladder, and became a professional track runner.  Seeing her body, mind, and world changed, Jaha was pleased with the results.  Sure, she’s not a black woman with a bit of a sour attitude, but she can participate in track now.  Looking back at the mirror, she wondered what to do with this new life.</p>
