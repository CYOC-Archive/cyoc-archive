<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate and Alex ultimately found both Peyton and Shelly Ramsey in their kitchen cleaning up after their own family dinner. Both were fully transformed and Nate actually noticed that both were wagging their tails to the beat of some sixties rock music that was playing on a small radio. It too him a little while to spot the radio, a small red colored digital radio that looked like it was up on a stand next to the toaster. The volume was up high enough that the music could be heard over the water running in the sink and was enough that neither of Alex&#39;s parents heard Nate or Alex coming into the kitchen. However, Nate did notice one of Peyton&#39;s ears twitch, and figured that perhaps the older male werewolf caught Nate&#39;s scent and was moving to refocus his hearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, mom, dad,&quot; Alex announced his and Nate&#39;s arrival, &quot;Nate&#39;s back if you wanted to go over the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peyton and Shelly both turned and gave a small smile as they saw Nate. That gave Nate some reason feel happy and even proud. He&#39;d long had friends and people he identified with while growing up in Minnesota that he had plenty in common with. But with things relating to his parents marital troubles in Minnesota hanging over things, he&#39;d been to afraid that his parents would reject him if he told them he was gay and that soon also prevented him from finding real love with anyone while in Minnesota. In that, the move to Moon Lake had been a great blessing in that not only did his parents find out and accept that he was gay and approved of Alex, but he&#39;d also found himself getting the approval of Alex&#39;s parent&#39;s as well. It was something that Nate never would have predicted, but he loved it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good... good,&quot; Peyton gave a friendly smile and moved away from the sink, &quot;let&#39;s take the conversation to the living room, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how did your parents take the idea of keeping an eye on Alex?&quot; Shelly asked with a friendly smile and actually sounding rather playful as she turned off the radio and the group moved over into the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they are perfectly fine with me hanging out with Alex and keeping him out of trouble,&quot; Nate answered with a small smirk. He decided not to mention their hesitancy over the idea of moving in with Alex after graduating from high school. That would, after all still be two years away and they could get used to the idea by then. &quot;If that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for.&quot;<br />
<br />
The result was a hard pat on the shoulder by Peyton and then a warm hug from Shelly. Nate looked to Alex, who only smirked to him. He eventually figured that this was all part of the acceptance of his sexuality and friendliness that Nate had found in Moon Lake. He eventually returned the hug to Shelly and then moved to sit beside Alex when she let him go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;ll be good,&quot; Peyton said with a smile, &quot;As Alex needs someone to keep himself focused...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sometimes, I think it&#39;s Alex that keeps me focused,&quot; Nate commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... he is a smart boy,&quot; Shelly commented, &quot;but it&#39;s been more in the sense of giving him someone he can truly be with. As we&#39;ve told you... and as I&#39;m sure as Alex has told you... there aren&#39;t that many gay/lesbian werewolves and thus when a Normal comes to Moon Lake who is gay... Alex has been the one that they often come to to do the transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And since I was never able to really hit it off with those I turned... I didn&#39;t anything quite like what we&#39;ve had so far,&quot; Alex said to Nate, taking him by the hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I with you,&quot; Nate smiled back to his boyfriend. The two focused on each other for a few moments, simply smiling to the other and holding the other&#39;s hands as they did so. Nate was still in his human form and he was partially intrigued and amazed at the size difference between his human hand and Alex&#39;s paw like hand in his transformed state. While he had grown a bit bigger when he became a werewolf, which included his human form, he was still smaller than the size he attained when he transformed. Holding Alex&#39;s hand in the way that they were gave him some indication as to how much of a size difference their was between his human and wolf form. A deep &quot;ahem&quot; soon caught both of them out of looking to each other and they turned back to Peyton and Shelly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we are both pleased that you&#39;ve both found real happiness,&quot; Peyton spoke, &quot;and it&#39;s that sort of thing that Shelly and I wish to protect.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s why we think it a good idea that you and Alex keep an eye on the house and so on,&quot; Shelly added, &quot;though we do have some rules we&#39;ll ultimately hold BOTH of you to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alex said something about no wild parties...&quot; Nate commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one thing,&quot; Peyton commented with a glance to his son, &quot;a small gathering is perfectly fine so long as you clean up afterward... but we don&#39;t want things getting out of hand or accidentally broken, you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;though, I&#39;d also say that right now the only party I&#39;ve been thinking over going to has been the Halloween party.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m STILL waiting to know what you&#39;re going as,&quot; Alex commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as I said, it&#39;s a surprise and something wolfy,&quot; Nate replied. He then turned back to Peyton and Shelly, who had watched the exchange with very amused smiles, &quot;anyway... I don&#39;t think you have to worry about there being any wild parties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both then nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The other big things is that you&#39;re also respect your curfews and stay on top of your homework,&quot; Shelly spoke, &quot;we do want you to succeed and be able to move on. Getting good grades is part of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can do that,&quot; Nate and Alex chorused together.<br />
<br />
Peyton and Shelly then focused to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;And remember Alex, on days when we&#39;re not here, you&#39;re to check the mail on your way home from school,&quot; Peyton said to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;And Nate, be sure to remind him,&quot; said Shelly, &quot;and make sure Alex doesn&#39;t get too carried away trying anything in the kitchen...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I don&#39;t do too bad,&quot; Alex protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which I am very proud of,&quot; Shelly smiled, &quot;but it&#39;s still MY kitchen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s okay, may I could invite Alex over for dinner some times when you guys are out,&quot; Nate offered, &quot;that way your kitchen is safe and Alex and my folks can swap recopies and ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peyton and Shelly both smiled at that. Eventually, Peyton finished the run down on the rules, &quot;Well... I think we&#39;re set there. Just remember to stay within the rules and you&#39;ll both be fine.&quot;</p>
