<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was happening again!  There was a thrill of joy.  She was going to be able to relive being a mermaid.  Maybe her boyfriend would be able to get the pictures he wanted.  It must be the spandex and the water that were the triggers.  With just one or the other she remained human but with the two combined ...<br />
<br />
Everyone would see her!  There was a flash of panic.  She could not allow herself to become a freak before so many people.  She would get in the pool and her legs would form a tail and her body would be covered in spandex.  Everyone would see and everyone would freak out.  There would be running or screaming.  And she would not be able to run and hide from everyone.  All she could muster would be a little flopping.<br />
<br />
Then people would question her.  How did this happen?  I don't know, magic maybe.  Why did you do this?  I didn't.  Take off that stupid costume right now.  I can't.  Why not?  Magic made it my skin.  That's silly.  I can only take it off if I fuck my boyfriend.  Don't be crude Lydia, we demand an explanation.  I have none and even if I did it's my body and I like it.<br />
<br />
Lydia gritted her teeth.  If that was her decision she would stick to her guns.  It was not be choice that she was going to be a spandex mermaid.  But darn it, she was going to like it anyway.<br />
<br />
The loud speaker droned again in a way that no one could hear over the echos and noise.  Lydia was motioned by her coach that this was her race.  The one that she was going to beat Monica in and show the whole world that she was a mermaid.  She did not care what the fall out would be.  This would be the last race she ever made.  From now on she swam for herself.<br />
<br />
Lydia kicked off her deck shoes and stepped onto the starting platform.  The rough plastic coating was damp with pool water and she could feel the magic tingle up her body.  Her suit, or the part of her body that was merged with the suit, seemed to tighten with apprehension.  In a moment she would completely immersed in the clear liquid.  How far would she get before she had to kick with both feet together rather than separately?<br />
<br />
To her left Monica stepped up too.  &quot;This is it Lydia.  Care to make a bet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lydia was too distracted by a new thought.  Just how fast was this transformation?  The race was only going to be a lap or two.  At her best speed that was like two minutes tops.  How long had she been in the shower yesterday before she even noticed the changes?  The rain had soaked her but it must have been a few minutes before she could dry her body off.  Swim fast, jump out, towel off; do it quick enough and no one would know.  She could win the race and keep her secret.<br />
<br />
Crouched and ready.  Wait for the tone.  Leap!<br />
<br />
Lydia swam with a determination that she had never had before.  Her motion through the water was heavenly.  Her body slick and smooth slid between the turmoil almost effortlessly.  Her mind was focused.  All attention was on finishing the race faster and faster.  There was too much noise and splashing for her to focus and everything happened in a practiced manner.  Touch the wall, kick, swim.  Lydia had no idea where anyone else was.  She had no idea what her body was doing.  She was consumed by getting to the end.<br />
<br />
Boom!  Her hand touched the wall ending her run.  She sought for the edge of the pool and pulled her was out of the water.  Delighted she still had feet Lydia made her way to bright white rectangle of absorbent fabric that called her.  It was out of the ordinary that a swimmer got out of the pool so quickly.  There were screaming and yelling but Lydia paid them no heed.  Goggles came off, swim cap came off and the towel was around her body taking away the water in moments.<br />
<br />
As the adrenaline of the race cooled in her blood, Lydia took stock of her body.  The spandex had moved.  The neckline had grown closer to her throat but had not started its run up her neck.  The arm holes had closed over her shoulders but had not moved down her arms.  The leg holes had descended only a short way down her legs and now formed a chic pair of hot-pant cut on a level with her crotch.  Her breasts had also swollen more.  As she huffed for breath she found them bouncing noticeably but without visible nipples it seemed as if her suit did not support them in a way that it should.  Normal enough for the moment.<br />
<br />
Looking up she found her team around her clapping and hugging and cheering for her.  She had won.  She had beat Monica and had set a school record.  Lydia joined in with their happiness then.  But for her it was because she had kept it secret.<br />
<br />
Dry enough now to slow the process to a crawl, Lydia stayed on the side deck cheering the rest of her team.  No one even seemed to notice the change in her swim suit.  And Lydia was struck by the thought that if the spandex was now her skin she was technically not wearing any clothing.  So, she stood, among the crowds of people, naked except for her deck-shoes.<br />
<br />
And a damp towel around her waist, as the red and white fabric ever so slowly crawled down her body.</p>
