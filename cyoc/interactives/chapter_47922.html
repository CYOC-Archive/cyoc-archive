<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carrie gushed, &quot;Oh John it's a wonderful idea! Just imagine when we get back and tell our <br />
friends how we celebrated Christmas in July!&quot; <br />
<br />
The shop owner merely stood there smiling. John finally noticed she wasn't human but a <br />
humanoid fox wearing a retail uniform with the name tag 'Foxy Dame.' <br />
<br />
John shrugged again, &quot;Well, they said it would be less trouble to get a hotel once here than <br />
try to book one ahead of time. So it's not like we're dedicated.&quot; <br />
<br />
The retailer clapped, &quot;Good-good! Now just try them on and you can on your way in no <br />
time yip!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So... which costume is for-oh.&quot; John didn't have a chance to guess as Carrie handed him <br />
the rubbish mouse costume. 'Never mind.' <br />
<br />
Foxy Dame happily gestured like a 50's TV Mom at a couple drawn drapes. &quot;The changing <br />
booths are right over there right next to each other so no need to be shy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ever so gentle and ever so sublimely John and Carrie were push along to their respective <br />
booths (though there didn't seem to be a gender sign next to either). <br />
<br />
Inside John found a large wall sized mirror, an a little sign that said 'removing of clothing <br />
optional.'  &quot;Well I won't have to worry about my stuff being stolen if it's underneath a <br />
costume.&quot; John said simply, thinking how silly he'd look in the gray rubber mouse <br />
costume, but, he doubted he'd get any odd stares. <br />
<br />
John put open the costume's back, the inside looking much like the outside. Honestly now <br />
wondering how he'd look like with it on he put in one foot, and could have sworn he <br />
actually felt the carpet right through his shoe and the costume like he bare footed!  <br />
Surprised, John wiggled his toes and was surprised again when the toes of the costume <br />
did the same. He pulled his leg out and saw, that yes, he shoes was still there. &quot;That's a <br />
relief.&quot; John still wasn't sure how this was supposed to work he didn't want his shoes <br />
ruined due to some gag that wanted him naked after he took the costume off. <br />
<br />
John put his foot back into the costume leg, and again felt the carpet like it was against <br />
his skin. John put in his other leg, and felt perfectly through his clothes and the costume.  <br />
He looked down to see three big toes on his gray feet, pudgy and rubber. He hoped it <br />
wasn't cutting off his circulation, because he couldn't feet half his toes inside the costume. <br />
He bent his legs experimentally a few times and everything seemed okay. He pulled up on <br />
the costume and felt a wave of confusion as he brought it up to his waist.  He felt like he <br />
was missing something very important and felt a completely smooth front, 'Guess we'll <br />
have to take these things off to enjoy our honeymoon nights...'  He also didn't see any sort <br />
of slit or put away for using the bathroom either 'hope these things are easy to take off.'  <br />
<br />
John was so distracted by this that it took him a moment to realize that he felt his spine <br />
being suddenly extending away from his body and rising in mid air behind him. He turned <br />
around and saw the pink mouse's tail, he tensed his muscles and saw it twitch. <br />
<br />
John felt the air conditioning now across his entire lower body, giving him the sense of <br />
being naked from the waist down even though he was wearing his clothes and a costume.  <br />
He felt his rear and felt his hand touching his rear and was fairly relieved his felt no <br />
opening, reminding himself that indeed that was a costume ultimately. <br />
<br />
Now satisfied and feeling more confident John slipped on the arms of the costume, for a <br />
moment worried about circulation again when he couldn't feel his little finger but figured if <br />
his toes were fine than his fingers were fine, though he couldn't feel his wedding ring. <br />
<br />
 He now felt the air slowly moving across his entire body as he slipped on the body of the <br />
costume, leaving only the head. He looked in the mirror of the booth and saw himself in <br />
the rubber mouse costume, just plain shinny rubber.  He took the head and pulled it onto <br />
his face, now some odd things did happen. He could swear he was hearing from the top of <br />
his head rather than the sides, and his sense of smell was coming from further away on his <br />
face.  He blinked a few times looking in the mirror, seeing his eyes looking back at him <br />
from the costume. Reaching behind, he took hold of the zipper with agility in his limbs he <br />
didn't know he had and pulled it up. <br />
<br />
John shuddered as he felt a wave of feeling wash over his body. Shaking his head looked <br />
himself over, there wasn't a single fold or hang in the costume, it was perfectly fitting.  He <br />
felt his body over, feeling it all. But, did the costume's hands look, duller? Like they had <br />
less detail, and there was a black outfit around them no matter what way he looked at <br />
them. He looked at the mirror, was surprised when he saw his eyes looking out at him <br />
from a cartoon mouse's head, his eyes looking Clutch Cargo style on the celluloid head. <br />
Looking at everything he saw the drabs also looked like celluloid, but the walls, the bench, <br />
the carpet, all looked like a static watercolor background. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whao!&quot; He heard Carrie say in surprise and amazement in the booth next to him. <br />
<br />
Turning away from the mirror John reached out and pulled at the celluloid drab and saw <br />
the entire store was now watercolor backdrop, except of course for the retailer who was <br />
now a celluloid fox woman. <br />
<br />
Outside the windows, John saw more celluloid toon characters, but also human beings who <br />
looked photo realistic and were as normal looking as the person you see on the street. <br />
<br />
The other drab opened and John turned to see a painted celluloid reindeer step out <br />
awkwardly. It had cloven hooves for feet that stepped like high heel shoes. It's fingers <br />
were counted as eight total, which ended in large thick dark brown almost black nail. <br />
<br />
 John realized that just as he couldn't see as contours of his muscles underneath the <br />
costume, he couldn't see any underneath Carrie's (that's the only person it could logically <br />
be).  Her figure had wide hips which became thinning legs, her lovely bosom was the same <br />
size as before, but now was a singular joined mass outwardly on the costume, her <br />
cleavage filled in.  Carrie's eyes looked out from the costume at everything in amazement. <br />
<br />
Her face was a long muzzle with large antlers atop her head, proving once and for all that <br />
this was very much a cartoon, female deer don't have antlers in reality. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything, everything is a cartoon!&quot; She said in absolute amazement. <br />
<br />
The retailer smiled and nodded, &quot;You're now seeing this world as it truly is. The portal to <br />
your reality creates a small bubble around itself to prevent cartoon physics  from leaking <br />
into the real world, which would cause a feedback loop that might wipe out time and <br />
space. But now you're seeing existence, our existence, as it actually is.  To sum it up, your <br />
expectations of reality were simply too realistic before.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This... This is amazing! John this is totally amazing! Isn't it amazing?!&quot;  Though John was <br />
wearing a long sleeve shirt under the costume, he felt the hand hooves of Carrie's <br />
costume took his shoulders as she grasp him excitedly. <br />
<br />
John was pushed out his normal laid back calm attitude and admitted, &quot;Yes, yes it is <br />
amazing...it guess cartoon physics really do apply here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed they do!&quot; Said Foxy dame in a upbeat tone. &quot;Now then, there was that christmas <br />
district of toon world I told you about! I can assure you you'll fit right in!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We should pay you for the costumes now.&quot;  Said Carrie and felt her hips, &quot;Uh, maybe I <br />
should have take out my credit card before putting on the costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
Foxy Dame waved off, &quot;Oh don't worry about it! The money is just to make you feel more <br />
at home. While we have cash and credit, we don't take it all too serious! Well, most of us <br />
don't. As far as I'm concerned, you don't owe me a thing! You coming here and interacting <br />
with, and you merely being here is more than payment enough!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you keep the economy from crashing?&quot; John asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Anti-lock breaks!&quot; Foxy dame said proudly. <br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you avoid deflation?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Steel belted tires!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay I'm starting to get the idea.&quot; John replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good! The sooner you do, the better off you'll be!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So how do we get to the Christmas district?&quot; Carrie asked getting used to walking on <br />
what felt like stilts almost. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that's easy, when you leave the store, there should be a sign that'll point you in the <br />
general direction, just start walking that way, then after one or two scene cuts you should <br />
arrive just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carrie and John looked at each other but said nothing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, how do we go about getting a cottage?&quot; Carrie continued. <br />
<br />
Foxy Dame put one hand on her elbow and another on her chin, &quot;First and foremost -<br />
don't- get reservation... you two a couple right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just married.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;-Definitely- don't get reservations! You'll just end up getting booked for the same cabin <br />
at the same time as some people you know in real life who you detest or some hillbillies <br />
or rich snobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then how do we get a cottage? Wander about for one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... as long as you stay out of the borders of Fairy Tale Theater district that'll actually <br />
be rather safe and effective, doing it there gets you a wicked witch or bridge with a troll or <br />
a mushroom fairy ring... Oh never mind that! Don't worry The Plot will take care of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Plot?&quot; John blinked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes The Plot. Since you're crossing over from the Disney/Warner Brothers district to the <br />
Christmas district you don't need to worry about one of those hash 'unhappy christmas' <br />
parodies. But if you're really wanting a cottage...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU suggested it remember?&quot; John pointed out. <br />
<br />
Foxy dame put her hands up in defense, &quot;Oh right! Sorry! Once you reach the christmas <br />
district you should find in the center of the place some signs pointing towards cabins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that really safe?&quot; John has to ask. <br />
<br />
Foxy Dame shrugged, &quot;No ones dies in these sort of cartoons.&quot; <br />
<br />
Carrie and John looked at each other and nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, thank you for everything and the costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My pleasure.&quot; Foxy Dame bowed. <br />
<br />
Carrie and John turned together to walk out of the store. The fox at the same time reached <br />
at their back and peeled off the zippers throwing them in the garbage. <br />
<br />
Carrie and John staggered for moment wavered. Their eyes before Clutch Cargo style on <br />
toon faces became ink and paint and expanded becoming black center in really large white <br />
circles perfectly making the rest of them now.  <br />
<br />
 Shaking their head together for a moment they continued on their way out of the store <br />
their motions now perfectly more fluid all traces of awkwardness and clumsiness in <br />
controlling their limbs utterly gone. Carrie moving with a skip in her step like a ballerina <br />
while John arms and legs moved to-and-froe like they were all joints his tail wavering <br />
behind him. <br />
<br />
The door proved just large enough for Carrie's antlers to fit through with John besides her.  <br />
The couple looked to their right saw that very much so there was a green and white sign <br />
with candy cane trim pointing in a vague direction with the words written 'Christmas-<br />
District.' <br />
<br />
Carrie and John looked at each other (not noticing any change in the other in the least), <br />
held up their arms and shrugged. Taking each other hand in hoof they moved the way the <br />
sign pointed, flowers blooming in the married couple's wake.</p>
