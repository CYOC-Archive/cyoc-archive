<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carrie and John returned to their hotel room with a cartoon duffle bag in hand, said bag loaded to the brim with all sorts of toys from Stretched-Out Sam&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Once inside they quickly undressed and set the bag on their springy bed. With a swift zip the bag opened up to a black void. John with some hesitation reached his hand into the bag then his whole arm, toon rules took some getting used to. After fishing around he felt the first item they were looking for. He pulled out a oil drum with a hand pump screwed onto the top. As he did the 50 gallon drum weighed light as a feather until it was fully out of the bag, at which point the full weight sank in and the drum crashed to the hotel-room floor.<br />
<br />
Winded John stepped back, leaving Carrie to strut to the large cylinder and wobble it into the corner label facing out to read &#39;lube-e-toon, industrial sized toon lube&#39;<br />
<br />
Back at Sam&#39;s Carrie had told Sam that she was a size queen and asked to see the largest toys she had in stock. Sam instead offered her a bottle of this very lube, a specialty item they made in house. Carrie questioned how it was made, but thought it better she not know.<br />
<br />
&quot;So this lube really makes anything it&#39;s applied to fit inside you?&quot; John asked, still a little skeptical. <br />
<br />
&quot;According to Sam yeah.&quot; Carrie replied with a shrug. She for one was very excited to try it out. Since in her experience truely enjoying her fetish was a serious time commitment. Some people think you just grab the biggest dildo you can find and ride it, but you actually need to slowly increase the size, slowly stretching yourself out, building up to your prized toy.  <br />
<br />
Carrie of course enjoyed the journey as you should, but the idea of just jumping up the latter was too fun to pass up!<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright honey,&quot; Carrie said to John, &quot;what&#39;s first?&quot; As she crawled onto the bed, arranging pillows so she could recline and spread her legs wide open, revealing her shaved woman hood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figured it best we play it safe n make sure this works.&quot; He said as he pumped some lube onto his hand and began rubbing it in, coating it evenly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humf!&quot; Carrie pouted crossing her arms. &quot;You always tease me too much, it&#39;ll be fine!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what you said about the &#39;american dream&#39; dildo and we had a scare, running to the ER...&quot; He shamelessly reminded her as he crawled onto the bed between her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;One time! One time I go to the hospital with a sex toy and I never live it down!&quot; She complained  <br />
<br />
&quot;I calm down we&#39;ll have out fun.&quot; He said slowly fingering her with his lubed up hand, two fingers to start. Carrie gave a cute &#39;mmmhm&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can go a little faster then that John.&quot; She said with a quip. In response John made a knife hand with all 5 fingers and with surprising ease slid his whole hand in, feeling Carrie&#39;s warm walls clamp around his wrist and she gasped in shock at the sudden rush of being stretched so suddenly!<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn Carrie,&quot; he said bewildered &quot;it&#39;s like you sucked me right in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmmmm...&quot; She moaned, &quot;its like my insides are putty, keep going!&quot; She cheered, clearly enjoying herself<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, alright.&quot; John got up pulling his hand free from carries pussy. it gaped briefly with a wet plop before folding back to its original size. John then fetched more lube, rubbing it down his arm then got between his wife&#39;s legs again. He formed a fist and pressed it to her pink neither lips they spread wide as he fisted her in one smooth thrust up to his wrist again then his forearm.<br />
<br />
Carrie gasped in pleasure and moaned when John pulled his hand back to the wrist then thrust clear to his elbow! Carrie couldn&#39;t help but throw her head back in a cry. When the shock of pleasure passed she looked down, seeing her husband&#39;s arm buried between her legs to the elbow and bulging her stomach impossibly. She should be in crippling pain with organ damage, was her womb even supposed to be there? <br />
<br />
The two were dumb founded by the toon logic that presented itself in this moment. While none of it made sense Carrie knew two things;<br />
1: it didn&#39;t hurt, and 2: it felt really good!<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep going...&quot; She faintly asked. Not wanting to disappoint his wife John pulled his arm out then gently thrusted it back in. Carrie again clamped down on his arm as though he were fucking her the tradition way. She gasped n moaned all the while, cupping her breasts and stifling screams until she couldn&#39;t hold back an more and came from john&#39;s fisting!<br />
<br />
John felt carrie&#39;s vaginal canal quiver around his arm and girl cum suddenly flood the now unusual space between his wife&#39;s legs.<br />
<br />
As Carrie rocked from her climax basking in the after glow John withdrew his arm from her stretched out pussy. The gap between her legs was as wide as a softball, the pink sensitive flesh briefly visable before the &#39;magic&#39; of toon world compressed it back to its proper size. <br />
<br />
John enjoyed this as much as his wife, often watching and helping her take on bigger and bigger challenges. So while she was occupied with her after glow, John decided to have some more fun.<br />
<br />
While Carrie caught her breath she faintly knew John had gone to wash his arm off, the sound of running water came from the bathroom or somewhere in the room. She wasn&#39;t sure, her head was swimming from that last orgasim, having almost all of johns arm in her was unreal and she daydreamed of all the other ways she could contort herself for even bigger hurdles! <br />
<br />
John for his part was deeply satisfied with the experience, he&#39;d not climaxed sure, but having Carrie so vulnerable, and being able to wield her body like so was a huge turn on. After he&#39;d washed off, not wanting to keep the strange lube on his forearm at the moment he made his way back to the duffle bag filled with entertaining things for some more fun.<br />
<br />
Basking in the after glow of her mind blowing orgasim Carrie only felt the bed shift as John returned. She felt his hand  gently brush the inside of her thigh. Then she felt something smooth and cold against both her thighs? She looked down still in a bit of haze to see a large round green and white object between her legs and johns hand behind it! Before she could react John thrusted the overly ripened watermelon covered in lube against her spread open pussy! Her feminin lips (for lack of a better word) gasped open stretching over a foot wide as the huge round fruit entered her! Carris head was thrown back as she screamed in ecstasy, bucked her hips and arched her pelvis up as John continued to push the watermelon up and into her womb!<br />
<br />
Carrie had just climaxed again from the experience and felt a satisfying pop as John withdrew his hand from Carrie&#39;s quivering libia. She spasms a few times, riding the high down utop her nest of pillows. Looking down once the worst of it had passed she saw her stomach bulging obseenly as though she were nine months pregnant! It was slightly oval in shape, pressing up to her ribs more then expected. It was also cold, like she&#39;d swallowed a gallon of ice cubes. It wasn&#39;t un-pleasant, far from it, but worth observing.<br />
<br />
&quot;What. the. FUCK John!&quot; She yelled at him! She tried to sit up but soon had to take in a breath of air as the melon pressed on her chest from moving to quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry hun, I just couldn&#39;t resist!&quot; He said with a grin. &quot;I just had to see what happens!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Well...&quot; Carrie huffed as she sat up, one hand cradling the new mass in her body with some difficulty. &quot;Damn, if this is what it&#39;s like to be knocked up I&#39;m never having kids... Hay, help me here&quot;<br />
<br />
She flailed an arm at John who helped her sit up cross legged, stacking pillows behind her to help prop her up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit John...&quot; Carrie sighed after settling into her new posture, the round orb of her belly resting firmly between her legs. &quot;How do we get it out...&quot;</p>
