<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey there limp-dick!” Ethan tipped an imaginary top hat to his reflection in the mirror. He picks up the measuring tape from the floor to put it back into his toolbox.<br />
<br />
Opening the toolbox however, one of his screwdrivers caught his eye. It had a rubber handle, shaped conspicuously like a certain human body part… a certain human male body part.<br />
<br />
Ethan’s right hand cusps one of his buttocks, his index finger gingerly went over between his cheeks…<br />
<br />
Suddenly a loud bang is heard throughout the house, emanating from downstairs followed by the bellowing of an intoxicated man “Ericcc! Fffffucking sccchool cawlled! Get yerr ashh down hewr! Whazz dis bout you fffucking eshposin yerrrshelf in scchool?!” It was their father, Eduardo and by the sound of things, he was in one of his awful moods.<br />
<br />
A switch flicked on inside Ethan’s mind and he instinctively gravitated to the source of the commotion without a second thought.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, the insufferable drunk shot a barrage of words at his terrified 11 year old child.<br />
<br />
“Did you rubh yerr dich on nother boyy’s faaashe?!” Eduardo yelled, pointing a hand that was holding a half- empty bottle accusingly at Eric “For fu.. For fuuch’s shake Ewic dat’s what shick *hic* shick people dew! Arrr you shome kinna nuttt *hic* nuttcashe? Perverdded pieshh of shit! SHIT!” He throws the beer bottle to the floor and it shatters into a million pieces.<br />
<br />
Eric flinched “I didn’t- I didn’t do it on purpose! Matt-“<br />
<br />
In his drunken rage, Eduardo cuts him off “WHAT?! Arr you fuchhing tawking bachh at ME?!” he approaches Eric like some fairy tale’s bogey man. Eric shuts his eyes, too scared to speak.<br />
<br />
Ethan comes down the flight of stairs buck naked and as if it were nothing he walks across the glass strewn floor, glaring down at Eduardo.<br />
<br />
“Whadde fuchh?” Eduardo wobbled. Ethan had never faced his father in the nude before, in what situation would that ever be called for? But he didn’t care, he was working on auto-pilot, no one harms his little brother.<br />
<br />
He observed his father’s bewilderment and the red blood-shot eyes darting up and down. Ethan had seen this particular expression on other people before, in fact he had seen it on himself earlier today at school.<br />
<br />
Eduardo was involuntarily measuring Ethan up and scaling the masculinity between them. Growing up with this drunkard, Ethan had seen him passed out with his dignity compromised several times.<br />
<br />
Even though Ethan couldn’t get hard anymore, this cock’s flaccid state towered his bastard dad’s thin erect excuse for a dick;  his new found appreciation and acknowledgement of the power of sizing up was giving him a more brazen strength.<br />
<br />
‘That’s right’ Ethan signaled via his intense gaze, ‘Feast your eyes on this monster, feel inadequate, cower in shame and run’.<br />
<br />
“Go to your room and stay there till you’re some kind of sober” Ethan ordered in a calm and quiet voice.<br />
<br />
Enraged, with his inhibitions momentarily destabilized, Eduardo comes up to Ethan. Their faces were inches away from each other. Eduardo scoffs at Ethan and lifts his hand, bringing it down to strike, but the teenage boy stays silent and unmoving standing his ground.<br />
<br />
Eduardo’s hand slows down and lands on Ethan’s left cheek weakly, his hand clumsily smearing the teenager’s face with the stench of alcohol. He grabs Ethan’s hair instead and pulls on it. There was still no reaction from the young man, he didn’t even flinch. Eduardo looks Ethan up and down. Despite being in a compromising position, Ethan stood there like a lion, the king protecting the pride.<br />
<br />
The intimidating monster cock was even closer now, so close Eduardo could feel its body heat and in turn he could feel himself retreat “Big maAAn awe ya? I’m shhooo scawedd” Eduardo slurred mockingly before looking back and forth between Ethan and Eric “You shhhhitzzz ain’t even worth it”.<br />
<br />
Eduardo shoves his shoulder against Ethan’s as he stumbles up the stairs into his room. Ethan turns around immediately to check up on his little brother.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay, did he hurt you anywhere?” Ethan asked as he inspected Eric for any physical scars or bruises. Thankfully there were none, but he was sure that any more emotional abuse could result in dire psychological problems.<br />
<br />
“Ethan…y…your feet…” Eric stammered, pointing to the bloody footsteps Ethan made walking around on shattered glass.<br />
<br />
“Right, don’t move, I’ll clean this up first” As Ethan went to get the Hoover, he winces with every next step, “Ha ha… it’s nothing”.<br />
<br />
“Don’t say that” Eric cried, still very much shaken, he doesn’t think he’d ever get used to the worst of his father’s random outbursts and Ethan hopes Eric will never have to feel the need to get used to it.<br />
<br />
“Eric… Eric look at me” Ethan placed his hands firmly on his little brother’s shoulders, “Just one more year, remember, just one more year and I’ll be 18 and I’ll get us out of this place and we’ll never have to deal with his shitty… shit…shit! Okay?” Ethan shakes his brother’s shoulders, “No more shitty shit shit”.<br />
<br />
Eric repeats the phrase nodding in agreement “No more shitty shit shit” He looked so small, smaller than usual and vulnerable. Ethan curses his father under his breath, tomorrow morning that bastard will most definitely forget everything and start gaslighting them, Eduardo’s brain may be a blank slate but his children were the ones constantly dealing with the aftermath.<br />
<br />
Ethan stares at his little brother, he had to be ‘The Man’, Eric needs someone who can provide for and protect him, god he was so scrawny and having had exchanged parts, there was no doubt in Ethan’s mind that his brother was unfortunately quite under-developed. Will Eric always be this small and helpless?<br />
<br />
Ethan catches Eric’s eyes dart down to his crotch, and that’s when he had an idea, it may not be the best time but it might help him in the long run and the earlier the better.<br />
<br />
“Hey Eric?” Ethan tires to get his attention; he raises his right hand indicating that the magic ring was still on his finger.<br />
<br />
“What?” Eric asked timidly.<br />
<br />
“You wanna try something a little crazy?”<br />
<br />
“W…What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
“You’re kinda small, you know that? Even for your age…”<br />
<br />
Eric’s eyes widened, his nostrils flared, but Ethan tried to keep the focus, by moving his hands onto Eric’s cheek and raising his little brother’s chin so that they were looking straight into each other’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“I think you don’t have enough testosterone” Ethan started “and we don’t really have the money to spend on treatments”<br />
<br />
“Tell me something I don’t know” fumed Eric.<br />
<br />
“But we do have this” Ethan rubbed the magic ring with his thumb “and… this.” He kept his eyes on Eric, as his right hand made its way down to his crotch and underneath the humongous schlong, “I’ll give you my balls and you give me yours, my testosterone will probably kick start your growth and…” Ethan’s voice trailed off, thinking ‘…and I’m limp-dick Ethan, I can’t even get hard anyways’.<br />
<br />
“And you’re already over-grown anyway!” Eric finishes his brother’s sentence enthusiastically, eyes widened, Ethan could see the light returning to his eyes as he fully grasped what his older brother was proposing. Eric was still wearing Ethan’s shirt, so all Ethan had to do was prop Eric up on a char and grab the other Dick Grayson sock. Ethan put the sock on the cock this time.<br />
<br />
“Why’d you do that?” asked Eric.<br />
<br />
“I dunno, just thought it might be funny, you know Dick… Grayson” Ethan gave his brother a goofy smile, which prompted the younger boy to roll his eyes. Ethan knew how to distract and recover his brother from fear; he was relieved these tactics still worked. “Besides, it kinda looks like a superhero mask” Ethan grabs the covered cock and starts playing with it like it was a puppet “No worries Eric, Ethan Morales Boy Wonder will always be here for you, always!”<br />
<br />
Eric chuckled but rose his eyebrow just the same “Aren’t you getting a little too old to call yourself that?”<br />
<br />
“Never”<br />
<br />
Eric grabs a hold of the Super-penis and lifts it up, while he pulls his pants down to his ankles.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” asked Ethan.<br />
<br />
“I just want to actually see it happen this time” Eric said.<br />
<br />
The brothers stare into each other’s eyes momentarily before a familiar warm feeling spread through their crotches.<br />
<br />
Eric was mesmerized by the feat happening before him, Ethan’s lemon sack testicles didn’t just seem to retreat into his body, visually the wrinkles of his scrotum smoothed out like some kind of real-time air brushing and the hairs regressed like watching the natural growth happen in reverse.<br />
<br />
Eric moved his hand down to touch the scrotum while it was in the midst of shrinking down, from the size of lemons to large chicken eggs, to quail and less, even the texture of the skin, mid- transition, almost felt similar to the feeling one would get when your leg falls asleep, but instead of ‘white noise’ electricity, it were their perspective skin textures, where the black and white grains were Eric and Ethan respectively, all jumbled up and coming together to form a clear picture.<br />
<br />
Eric drops the Super-dick, since the evening was getting pretty cold, the tiny testicles went up to where Ethan virtually only had a tube down there. With one hand, Ethan’s thumb lifted the dick out of the way while the rest of the digits felt for those miniscule quail eggs. He felt them tight against the root of the cock. They were soft and definitely felt more sensitive, but all the same, no hard-on ‘Oh well’ Ethan shrugged ‘It is what it is’.<br />
<br />
On the other hand Ethan had viewed Eric’s transformation with a sense of longing, he watched as the little acorn-dick poking out seemingly sunk deeper into, what he could only describe as, quicksand made of skin.<br />
<br />
The quail eggs expanded like water balloons, suffocating the little nub and forcing it to retreat deeper into Eric’s body. When the testicles finally reached the size of lemons, the skin sort of quickly dropped down and swung like a pendulum, back and forth.<br />
<br />
Its heavy weight made it look like there was a long sack hanging on for dear life between his little brother’s legs. The sheer weight of those balls had pulled the skin above the already retreated dick, creating some sort of stretched out curtains that concaved into the hole where one would normally expect a penis.<br />
<br />
Ethan didn’t think that thing could get buried even more than it already was, but the added layer of skin being pulled down proved him wrong… Eric’s crotch now looked like a cross breed between a Neapolitan Mastiff and a pug, where the saggy skin of the Mastiff completely covers the squished face of the pug. After the transformation was complete, he observed that very pug like dick, pushing away the folds of skin and peeking through, Eric had an erection, but the massiveness of Ethan’s original scrotum and balls have buried it more, making it appear even shorter.<br />
<br />
For the second time, Ethan felt jealous.</p>
