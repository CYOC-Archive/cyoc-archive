<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Conner laughed at their efforts to gain the upper hand against the other to suck his cock. But it didn´t help his wish, so he commanded: &quot;Stop that fighting. It’s nice to see you both so eager to suck me, but let’s make it the following. As Tony had already some of my cum now Alex will suck me. And then you will switch each time I want one of you to suck me. The other can play with the sucker in that time, understood?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Alex and Tony nodded before Tony played with Alex nipples while Alex sucked on Conner. They both couldn´t fight Conner´s commands. Conner enjoyed the experience, but already planned ahead for more changes. Alex had good ideas how his pet should look and act like, but Conner was sure he could do better, and he had two pets to work with. Maybe even more if he got them all?<br />
<br />
Alex and Tony lived in this house with their two younger brothers, Oliver, twelve-years-old, and Yanis, nine-years-old, and their father, Daniel, a forty-six-year-old lawyer. Since their mother died six years ago, he was their only parent. That was why Alex often had to watch for his younger siblings. Tony had been independent enough for some time, but both Oliver and Yanis needed him some times. Tony had also watched them, sometimes together with Conner, so that Alex could go out and have some fun.<br />
<br />
Grinning, he asked them: „Where is the rest of the family right now? And answer truthful.” While Alex continued to suck him off, Tony answered hesitant between licks to Alex nipples: “Oli is with one… of his friends…, they went swimming… with their family…, and Yanis went along. But… they should be home… around four in the evening….” Conner´s grin got wider. That would mean they will be back in around twenty minutes. And if Daniel came home on his normal time, he would be here at five as far as Conner knows.<br />
<br />
“So, I have time to adjust Alex a bit more before the other´s come home. Good.” Conner had seen that while Alex was now built similar to Tony, he was still older looking, and had no fur parts like his brother. When Conner scanned the change log he had found in the program, he had seen all changes already made and laughed a little. That he could use. Lucky for him that changing himself into a pet had erased Alex earlier input that only he could change Tony. But the idea was good, better safe than sorry. So, Conner reenacted that input, only for himself instead of Alex and for both Alex and Tony.<br />
<br />
Another look down at Tony´s fur got Conner thinking about having various different pets and not just one kind. So, while both Tony and Alex had a butt-plug with a dog-tail right now, and the box Alex had brought had even more dog-butt-plugs, Conner decided on changing them to fit other animal tails.<br />
<br />
Grinning, he made a small adjustment to Tony first. A quiet yelp alerted him that Tony has noticed that something was happening to him. Beside having fur on his chest, his empty groin, his knees and elbows, as well as the tail-butt-plug, Conner had changed Tony´s ears to look more dog-like. They now were floppy and higher on his head than before. <br />
<br />
He also had his hands and feet adjusted. The hands weren´t exactly paws now, but something in between. His fingers had gotten shorter, around half their old length, with the exception of his thumbs, which had remained their old length. So, they were now all equally long. His nails had turned into short, but blunt claws on the tips of each finger. He hadn´t gotten paw-pads, but the back of his hands was now covered in blond fur. His feet were more looking like normal dog hind-paws, but still attached like human feet. So, Tony could still stand normal on them, if not for the missing strength in his muscles. The paws had also short, blunt claws and blond fur, but unlike his hands had gotten small, black paw-pads on them.<br />
<br />
Conner loved the look of desperation Tony shot up at him, and petted his head while Tony still licked Alex sensitive nipples. Conner moaned as he came into Alex mouth seconds later, and just like Tony before Alex couldn´t keep it all in, as it dripped out of the corners of his mouth. After releasing Conner´s cock, Alex looked up at Conner, dripping even more cum down his body. “Alex, you will lick me clean of the cum, while Tony can clean you.” Conner ordered after the glow was over.<br />
<br />
As both brothers started to clean, not able to fight the command off, Conner switched to Alex profile and started editing what he decided. When all was done, he looked down at Alex to watch the changes.<br />
<br />
Alex yelped louder than Tony had when he felt the changes happen. Black fur started to grew from the same areas as Tony had, his chest, groin, elbows and knees. Also, the back of his hands and his feet got covered, deforming them just like Tony´s had. But instead of appearing as paws fitting a dog, Alex got the look of a cat instead. His feet were slenderer than Tony´s, and his claws, while also blunt, were retractable. The paw-pads on them were pink instead of black.<br />
<br />
His hands grew slimmer, his fingers shorter like Tony´s had, but were still usable mostly normal. Then his ears reshaped into triangular cat ears on top of his head, a bit hidden by his black hair. The fur of the tail on the butt-plug grew tighter, as instead of a bushy, black dog tail it became a straighter cat tail instead. With a final shudder, Alex shrunk smaller as he regressed into an eleven-year-old, making him a twin to Tony age-wise. But he was half a head smaller than Tony now.<br />
<br />
“You turned out just as cute as your brother, Alex” Conner said as he now petted Alex, while he still licked Conner´s legs clean. Tony had finished the bit of cleaning from Alex body, and now squat next to them, waiting. He couldn´t do much to fight all this. A quick glance at the clock showed Conner they still had a couple of minutes to spare, and he was sure the other´s wouldn´t be on time. So, with a bright smile, he knelt in front of Tony and Alex and hugged them both close. Both moaned in pleasure as their sensitive nipples rubbed against Conner´s chest, while on the inside they both were horrified how strong these arms took hold of them.</p>
