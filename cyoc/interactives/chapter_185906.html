<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After third period, Darren started hearing rumors around the school; that it was somehow “heartbreak season”. Apparently this was because all of the men in Darren’s class who had had girlfriends were abruptly breaking up with their girlfriends. Rumor had it that even sexy gym teacher Mr. Karl was separated from his wife. It would only be so long before they realized that their little high school had more gay men than average.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to remedy this growing population imbalance, Darren made it a small project to turn the ex-girlfriends of the guys in his gym class into lesbians. Soon this high school would be known as an LGBT hub. <br />
<br />
The next day, some of those girls had started tentative relationships with one another. Any guy who Darren caught or heard about objectifying these girls was immediately turned gay. Darren found himself asking for a lot of bathroom breaks to use the Sexuality Tablet to this end.<br />
<br />
It was Thursday and Darren was sad that it wasn’t a gym class day. There really wasn’t another time that he was surrounded by men to take full advantage of the tablet. He got through the school day, balancing his homework, classwork, and secret tablet project. <br />
<br />
About 1/8 of his school’s students were now gay. It didn’t sound like a whole lot, but compared to the measly 8-10% before it really was a lot. It was already becoming socially acceptable to be gay, more so than ever before. The sight of boys holding hands with boys in the hallway made all of Darren’s hard work worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Darren headed over to his longtime friend Timmy’s house. Timmy was one of the boys at school who Darren had not turned gay. He was already accepting and loving of gay people and had respect for women, so as far as Darren was concerned, he was fine to stay straight. Besides, Darren had no interest in Timmy. Timmy’s older brother Cain, however, was hotter than lava.<br />
<br />
Cain was 24, 6’1”, with blue eyes, mid-length brown hair, and with a body that looks like it chops wood as a hobbie. In the days when Darren, Timmy, and Cain used to play slip ‘n slide out on Timmy’s lawn, Darren had seen Cain shirtless. He was a very smooth man in the chest, only some hair around his nipples and a happy trail below his bellybutton. <br />
<br />
There was no question that Cain was a world class hotty in Darren’s eyes, but the problem was that Cain had been away at college. It was still worth visiting Timmy though. They always had fun together.<br />
<br />
When Darren arrived on foot at Timmy’s house, his eyes lit up. There was Cain’s car! He must’ve been home on a break. Darren was about to knock on the door but Timmy open it right underneath his knuckle.<br />
<br />
“Shhhhhh,” whispered Timmy, “My dad and Cain are fighting. Just sit down in the living room, I gotta use the john.”<br />
<br />
Darren obeyed but couldn’t unglue his ears to the conversation between Cain and his dad. Apparently, Cain wasn’t home on break, he had dropped out before finishing his bachelors. When Darren had passed them on his way to the living room he noticed that they were having this argument in their underwear. Darren remembered that Timmy’s dad worked weekends and had a couple of days off during the week. Their dad, Arlo, must’ve been mad that Cain was lounging around too, with no job and being a recent college drop out.<br />
<br />
Darren didn’t feel that Arlo was bring fair to Cain. He felt that Cain should have some leeway to decide what he wants to do. Breaking out the Sexuality Tablet, Darren altered Arlo. “interested in: specific only: son, Cain” typed Darren. He also boosted Arlo’s libido and lowered his sexual inhibitions.<br />
<br />
After hitting submit, Darren had to sneak a peak to see how this would play out. He put his head ‘round the corner and watched Arlo lose his train of thought.<br />
<br />
“And another thing young man, you have to start being more responsible and thinking about your fu—,” Arlo stopped, realizing how deliciously attractive his son Cain was. He had been poking his pointer finger in the middle of Cain’s chest as a threat but now moved the position of his finger such that it was poking Cain’s nipple instead. He found himself rubbing Cain’s nipple with that finger and quickly Arlo’s cock became erect in his boxer briefs.<br />
<br />
“Eww dad, you’re hard! Can we finish this conversation some other time?” Said Cain, confused by why his dad was suddenly looking at him like he was a piece of meat.<br />
<br />
“You’re damn right we will,” said Arlo, moving his hand to cover his erection, “and give me your phone, you’ve lost that privilege.”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Cain forked over his phone. He headed towards the living room. Darren had ducked back behind the wall before Arlo or Cain had seen him watching them.<br />
<br />
“Oh hey Darren,” said the polite Cain, “Sorry if you had to hear any of that.”<br />
<br />
“Hey no sweat, families argue, right?” Said Darren, rhetorically.<br />
<br />
Cain turned on the tv, and while he was distracted watching, Darren booted up Cain’s profile.<br />
<br />
“Cain Turningway: 24, single interested in: men 18+”.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” thought Darren, “Cain is already gay! Well I can lower his standards a bit.”<br />
<br />
Darren changed Cain to be attracted to men 16+, and lowered his inhibitions.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Arlo came back downstairs in a rush sporting his 4.5 inch hard-on from earlier, “Give me the password, now,” he said to Cain.<br />
<br />
“Jeez dad, what’re you gonna do, jerk off to my nudes?” Asked Cain, defiantly.<br />
<br />
“None of your business. I’m the one who pays for this phone,” said Arlo.<br />
<br />
“Atta boy,” said Arlo when Cain had finally put the password in, “Now if I could just get you to obey me without the extra lip.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t count on it,” said Cain under his breath.<br />
<br />
“What was that?” Asked Arlo, his boner twitching angrily.<br />
<br />
“I said happy to help,” said Cain.<br />
<br />
Arlo stomped away, going to do exactly what Cain had accused him of and jerk off to his son’s nudes before his wife got home. Darren was in awe at the power of the Sexuality Tablet. It could even make a father desperately attracted to his own son.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Cain, I’m a bit cold, do you think we could cuddle on the same couch?” Asked Darren in a coy voice.<br />
<br />
Cain was about to say no, but when he looked over, he was seeing Darren in a new light. “Sure, I guess a little male bonding could do us some good,” said Cain, not wanting to sound too interested, but not wasting this opportunity.<br />
<br />
Darren walked over and sat right down on Cain’s lap. “Jackpot,” thought both of them. As they watched the program that Cain had put on, both of them formed erections. They put a blanket over their lower bodies to make it less obnoxious for when Timmy was back. And just in time too, Timmy was finally back from the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Gross, my best friend and my brother are an item?” Asked Timmy.<br />
<br />
Both Cain and Darren blushed.<br />
<br />
“I was just helping him to warm up,” said Cain meekly.<br />
<br />
“Well what if we were? You love both of us, right? So it’s no different,” said Darren.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess you’re right. I should be congratulating you on catching an older man but it’s just weird that it’s my big brother. But I’m happy for you guys. I’m gonna give you guys some alone time and go hang out with Ginny (his girlfriend), we can have friend time tomorrow,” said Timmy.<br />
<br />
Neither Darren nor Cain had objected. Guess that made them official on some level. Darren couldn’t believe his luck. With Timmy gone, the two of them started to make out on the couch. Darren let the larger man feel up his whole body. It was amazing to just let go and let Cain explore him. They took it up to Cain’s bedroom.<br />
<br />
Once on the bed, the boys got in the 69ing position and started to such each others’  cocks. Darren couldn’t even fit the length of Cain’s impressive penis in his throat. The two continue on like this for a while when suddenly Darren felt a new sensation. The older boy’s tongue was pressing into his hole, actually penetrating it about an inch deep, and spinning around and wiggling. Darren wasn’t very sexually experienced and being eaten out like this made him moan and lose his load. Cain laughed a bit a how cute that was.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry, I didn’t make you cum yet,” said Darren.<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize, I’m having a great time. You’re so cute, I don’t know how I didn’t notice before,” said Cain.<br />
<br />
“Well you’re handsome as fuck, but I can’t say I didn’t notice before,” said Darren. Cain kissed him passionately as a thank you for the compliment.<br />
<br />
“Holy fuck, your dick stays hard after you cum?” Asked Cain, marveling at how Darren’s cock was still rock hard.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I guess it’s just a quirk,” said Darren.<br />
<br />
“Well it’s a quirk that comes in handy. You might be able to get me off yet,” said Cain.<br />
<br />
He lubed up Darren’s cock and squatted over it. Darren couldn’t believe it, he was about to fuck Cain!<br />
<br />
Cain’s hole responded to the pressure from Darrens cock and it opened up, allowing the full length inside him. As he bobbed up and down on Darren’s dick, he jerked his own big dick. Even though Darren had already cum, the sensation of having his fuck-stick used was pleasurable.<br />
<br />
Cain rode him like that for a half an hour. He let go of his dick and hands free orgasmed, splashing Darren’s face and chest. Darren came again too, shooting a blank up Cain’s ass as they both moaned.</p>
