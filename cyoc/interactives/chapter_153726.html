<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While I was waiting for this kid&#39;s mom to come pick me up, (he apparently lives in the same neighborhood I do, as he goes to that middle School in my neighborhood according to the ID I looked at earlier. Which easily kills two birds with one stone: I&#39;ll know where this kid&#39;s house is, and I get a quick and easy ride back). I sit there in the office studying this medallion. <br />
<br />
We must have switched immediately upon contact. I was already falling on top of myself immediately right when he ran into me. Soooo.....maybe all I have to do is touch someone while holding it? But who to do it with? His mom? Well, she&#39;s an adult and a woman. So I&#39;ll have that going for me. But to put that poor woman into her own son&#39;s body seems a bit too unfair. So, what then? Maybe go back to the house and break in while he&#39;s sleeping as me? Try and do it then? But if Vin wakes up and catches me, as a teenage boy, breaking into the house at night, that might not be too good......<br />
<br />
....or maybe it&#39;ll be perfect? Maybe I could switch bodies with him. It&#39;s wierd to imagine myself as Vin. And Vin would become this teenage boy. He&#39;d be really confused and freaked out, and it might take me a while to explain it. But together, we could trap the little twerp who stole my body and put me back into it. ....but then, that means he would then be Vin, and he could probably overpower both of us by himself. <br />
<br />
How about Vin switches with him, putting that kid in his rightful body, then Vin and I could switch back to ourselves from there? Yeah. That could work! It&#39;s a bit roundabout, but it would ensure T<br />
this Michael punk wouldn&#39;t get in possession of Vin&#39;s powerful frame.<br />
<br />
I sat there, my mind coming up with these incredible plans while looking at the medallion in the palms of &quot;my&quot; boy hands in the security office waiting for his mother to come pick me up. <br />
<br />
About 15 minutes pass, when a woman enters the security office. <br />
<br />
&quot;Michael James Bennett! You have some explaining to do on our way home!&quot;<br />
<br />
She thanked and apologized to that mall cop and scolded me some more. I decided to just keep my mouth shut and my head down while I followed her out the door, like a defeated lost little puppy. Which is what I basically was, in the most degrading terms imaginable.<br />
<br />
His mother wasn&#39;t pretty, but neither was she ugly. She was short, like this kid was. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that&#39;s where I get it from?&quot; Only vaguely aware of what I just thought and the significance of that thought. <br />
<br />
She was dark-skinned, with shoulder-length dark curly hair, and a nose slightly too large for her face. She...we....were either Jewish, or Italian. I never could tell them apart. Similar kind of features that Vin has. Except Vin was really handsome, and his large nose fit just right on his face. <br />
<br />
Anyway, we walk outside then climb into a silver Subaru. A decent enough of a car, so they were apparently not poor. But neither were they rich. On the ride back to their house, I said nothing while this mother berated and scolded me. My mind was wandering, as seems usual ever since our irritating switch. I started becoming aware of the snake in my jeans once again, when she said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you hear me Michael? Are you even listening!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, mom.&quot; I said. Mom? &quot;Mom&quot;!? I said that without even having to think about it! Keeping my horror to myself, I was now more determined than ever to seek my body out. No way, was I going to be one some 14 year old BOY!<br />
<br />
14? I now know the age! And in 8th grade! <br />
<br />
Ugh, I don&#39;t want to be stuck as a 14 year old boy stuck in the 8th grade! Feeling my &quot;thingy&quot; a little more intesnley, I started getting itchy to get to the house. I tried my damndest to not squirm around.<br />
<br />
Luckily, it didn&#39;t take us very long. Our neighborhood wasn&#39;t too far away from the mall. About a 10 minute drive altogether. <br />
<br />
We pull into a back alley, then into a small dirt driveway. A fenced-in yard. A white shed in serious need of a new paint job and a structural facelift. A yard with an old metal swing set, with bushes down by the driveway along the inside of the fence. A small tree in the left-center half of the yard, and further up, a row of three medium-sized bushes. <br />
<br />
We walk through the gate, up the curved sidewalk, towards the back porch. My heart racing out of nervousness for being about to step into someone else&#39;s house as an occupant of said house. &quot;Mom&quot; unlocks the door, opens it, and steps through the threshold. <br />
<br />
With nervousness and a bit of apprehension, I follow her into the home. We step into a kitchen. It wasn&#39;t &quot;nice,&quot; like I&#39;m used to. But neither was it a sloppy mess. It was clean with new carpeting . Not my style. A wierd grayish color. A large table in the middle with an old 80s-style four lightbulb chandelier hanging over top of it. <br />
<br />
To the left as we walk in, the refrigerator. To the right, a dishwasher with wood paneling, followed by a double sink with a small window that looks out to the back half of the wraparound porch. Along the same wall, was a row of cupboards, both too and bottom. On the far wall to the right, a kitchen range/stove unit next to a door on the right of that, on the same wall as the dishwasher / sink. <br />
<br />
To the left of the stove, along that far wall, a large, long, rectngular window that looks at the brick wall of the neighbor&#39;s house. A radiator in front of the window with a bunch of junk piled on top. The only mess in that kitchen. Finally, along the left wall, was a rather beautiful hutch holding some rather ugly brown dishes. Which I assume, probably strangely holds some value. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, get up to your room young man, and finish your homework!&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait. &quot;Homework!?&quot; Ugh! Stupid kid has &quot;HOMEWORK!&quot; How....DEGRADING! I haven&#39;t had &quot;homework&quot; in close to a decade! I&#39;m a professional woman, for chrissakes!<br />
<br />
Catching myself, I said &quot;FINE!&quot; In a teenaged petulent manner. That came out all too naturally!<br />
<br />
I take off towards the doorway to the stairs in the corner between the large picture window, and the hutch. Turn left, and immediately is a steep set of stairs with a window at the top. <br />
<br />
I begin to climb those stairs. Not fully knowing which direction to turn at the top. Either left or right. A small hallway. I didn&#39;t have to worry, as I instinctively went left. A door in front of me. A brown one. &quot;The bathroom,&quot; something said deep inside &quot;my&quot; brain. Make another left, another door. A white one. Miss-matched doors. Ugh! But that door must be...*gulp*...this boy&#39;s room....*MY* room...<br />
<br />
The door was a mess. Missing a doorknob and the latch. It was heavy, and was &quot;stuck&quot; in it&#39;s door frame. I instively lifted up slightly in the hole where the knob should go, and pulled it open towards me.<br />
<br />
Now, I&#39;m about to enter the gross world of a teenage boy: his bedroom! I wasn&#39;t far off from my assumptions. There was a faint musky smell to the room! Crinkling my nose up, I proceed to step inside.<br />
<br />
The foot of the bed was immediately to the right along the wall the bedroom door is on. Two dressers along the far wall facing the bed. Maybe 4 feet between the bed and the dressers. A desk and a wall immediately to the left. A tall narrow window to the left of the head of the bed that looks out into the back yard. It&#39;s a hell of a small room!<br />
<br />
A blue ratty carpet that was actually thick. Just gross looking. Stains. I particularly notice a heavy yellow stain just inside the door. Now, my penis....&quot;MY&quot; penis, I realized I thought! Really stirred awake! <br />
<br />
My hand drifted down towards my belt buckle. Started undoing the belt. &quot;Oh god! No, no, no!&quot; I thought with disgust.<br />
<br />
I bent down to undo my shoe laces. I tug off the shoes. Feet slightly smell, but not overbearing. Socks are slightly wet. &quot;Gross! My feet were inside like this the entire time!&quot;<br />
<br />
Closing my eyes and pinching the tip of my right sock between thumb and forefinger, I begin to slowly pull it off. It comes off, and dangles between my fingers. I drop that sock, and proceed to do the same with the left one. <br />
<br />
I stand there now, barefoot. The feel of the gross old blue carpet on my feet. With my penis completely wide awake and getting really hard...my very first erection!! I feel the intense need to both pee, and to....uuuhhh...masturbate! <br />
<br />
Standing there, looking down at this foreign body of mine, feet mostly covered by the jeans, I have the strong urge to rip them off and just go at it.<br />
<br />
Instead, I head to the bathroom. I walk in. It&#39;s small. A doorless closet that connects my room with the bathroom  immediately on the left. Followed by, also on the left, the shower/bathtub. On the right, a radiator a hamper, then the sink with a large mirror. <br />
<br />
Behind the wall of the food of the tub, the toilet with a window that&#39;s a twin to my bedroom window, looking upon the back yard.<br />
<br />
I proceed towards the toilet, while slowly stripping off my gross white t-shirt. I pull it up over my head as I stand in front of the mirror. Even though I knew I was now a young teenage boy, I was STILL half expecting to see myself staring back from that mirror. It took my breath away to see a young teenage, dark curly-haired boy with a small smattering of freckles across the nose and fading into the cheeks below the dark eyeballs, with a very slightly pudgy, mostly flat stomach and chest, staring back! I stood there, trying to catch my breath and hold back the tears. That....that was now....ME! I&#39;m staring through those dark chocolate puppy dog eyes. <br />
<br />
I reached up and grabbed a small spring of dark hair on the forehead, and pulled it down. It was short. I let it go, and it sprang back into place. <br />
<br />
I really had a strong need to piss! The penis was demanding a huge amount of attention.<br />
<br />
I reached down and pulled down the jeans. Underneath, revealed a pair of gray briefs, perfectly fitted to this boy&#39;s form. A large lump sticking straight out.<br />
<br />
Heart pumping, I take a big breath and pull down those briefs. A really long, really erect, pale penis bounces out with a long greenish-blue vein on its underside. Carefully, I touched the thing. I actually *FELT*it! I felt the sensation of touching it, though that thing! It really *was* mine right now! I touch it again, and felt the Sparks fly through my head! <br />
<br />
Still standing there, looking down over my young male body, I grip the penis between thump and forefinger and lift it up. I inspect the &quot;THING.&quot; A large, long blue vein on the underside along the shaft. Two small round balls hanging beneath it! I touch those, and they slightly bounce and wobble. <br />
<br />
Mouth drooling, tears beginning to roll, I grip the shaft in my left hand and squeeze while tugging. Suddenly, bolts of electricity flew up to my brain while glob after glob of teenaged male sperm pumped out of the mushroom-shaped tip! I was utterly frozen solid for a good 15 - 20 seconds. The really strange intense feeling made my right eye twitch while this was occurring. <br />
<br />
At the end of this ordeal, the thing was VERY sensitive, and continued to bob up and down! I&#39;m breathing very heavily, and sweat begins to drip from my forehead. I look back into the mirror, and see a dark curly-haired teenage boy with a droplet of sweat coming off that boingy spring of black hair I touched a few moments earlier. The boy in the mirror with a strange look in his eyes, breathing heavily and slightly bent over. The exact pose I was in! <br />
<br />
Now, the need to piss was overwhelming! Forgetting very quickly about being a boy with this sensitive, pulsating thing between my legs, I instively sat down to piss. I didn&#39;t know I had to make sure that the penis was supposed to be &quot;tucked&quot; downward, pointing towards into the bowl. I let loose like a firehose. And it FELT like a firehose should feel too. And a strong stream of yellow boy piss flew between the seat and the bowl! <br />
<br />
&quot;W. T. F!?&quot; I tried stopping it, but it was too late for that now. FAR too late! <br />
<br />
A panic-stricken series of &quot;oh god, oh god, oh god! Stop it! Please!&quot; Escaped my lips with the sound of a teenaged boy&#39;s tenor! <br />
<br />
But relief was coming fast. That was the most important thing at the moment. As the loss slowed to a trickle, the penis finally began to deflate. Somewhat. A couple of bobs of the appendage, several more squirts of piss. Much of it STILL squirting between the seat and the toilet. All over the floor between my legs!<br />
<br />
That done, I stood up, penis shrunken, and now balled up between my legs. A lake of yellow piss on the floor in between my feet, spreading rapidly. <br />
<br />
Sighing, i got to work in cleaning it up. No wonder guys stand while pissing! What a fucking nightmare! I stand back up after finishing cleaning the piss-covered floor.<br />
<br />
Now, to attend to cleaning MYSELF! I felt completely disgusting. I have the body of a teenage boy, which is just gross! And no amount of scrubbing will change that! But regardless, I could scrub this body anyway. <br />
<br />
Turning around in this small bathroom, I sigh. The tub is not at all to my liking. Just a regular old tub/shower combo. Not my nice, luxurious hot tub/shower combo that I earned! But whatever. This will have to do. For now.<br />
<br />
I turn on the hot water. Unfortunately, the house&#39;s boiler must also be low-grade, as it takes several minutes for the warm water to begin flowing out. I then adjust the temperature before climbing in. The whole time, careful not to look &quot;down there.&quot; At my new equipment. An embarrassing, funny little thing that&#39;s now attached to me! Marking me as a male! Ugh!<br />
<br />
So I begin cleaning myself. I go to pour out a lot of shampoo into my hands. I used what must have been his mother,&#39;s. I didn&#39;t want to touch the male shampoo which was probably his. I&#39;m already male enough as it was. <br />
<br />
I go to scrub my hair with the pile of shampoo in my left hands. Fully expecting to feel my full head of longer hair, I only felt the medium-short mop of course, curly hair with entirely too much shampoo for that job. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uuugghhh...that&#39;s right! Boy&#39;s hair and haircut!&quot; <br />
<br />
I just scrub my scalp. Then proceeded with the conditioner. Again, I&#39;m used to using a certain amount and over did it. But. Oh well. This kid has very thick, very curly hair anyway. It could use quite a bit of conditioner. <br />
<br />
Now. For the body.....<br />
<br />
Leaving the conditioner in my hair for now, I look down.  Begin to study the body, beginning with the....uuuhhh ....penis.... It&#39;s little, compared to Vin&#39;s. Paler. Baby-smooth. The balls haven&#39;t completely dropped yet. Still round and up tight like a boy&#39;s. Above in the public area where hair will one day sprout, a couple of very light hairs.<br />
<br />
I look under the armpits. Also quit smooth, but with a tiny light little patch of hair under each arm. I resist the urge to shave. Boys don&#39;t shave, and I&#39;ll have to try and get used to that.<br />
<br />
Legs have a very fine dusting of hairs, mostly down around the ankles. The feet are long, with long goofy-looking toes. I&#39;m guessing the kid will be going through a growth spurt some day. <br />
<br />
The hands, I&#39;m still getting used to. They look completely different from my own. Not as petite and pretty. No nails to speak of. All raggedy and chewed up. Jesus! <br />
<br />
Well, time to end this shower and brush my current teeth. I step out, grab a towel from the rack and dry off. I go over to the mirror, ands all fogged up. Great. Their bathroom vent doesn&#39;t work so well. I instinctively went to wrap the towel around my upper body, but quickly realized I have nothing to hide. It&#39;s all flat! That&#39;s right! I&#39;m a boy! A boy, dammit! So I mimic Vin, and wrap it around my waste. Then I open the door and the window in order to vent all the steam quicker. Doesn&#39;t take very long, and was nowhere near as cold as I thought it would be. Matter of fact, I&#39;ve been warmer than normal ever since this annoying switch! Dammit, which means I&#39;ll end up sweating more. Ugh. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the mirror cleared up quickly enough. I step in front to study my face again. Unmistakably boyish. Pale skin (not ghost white, but paler than I was.) Thick, black hair that is already tangling up into curls. Dark eyes. Broad, bulbish nose. Dark eyebrows. A light coating of freckles across the bridge of the nose that soreads to and fades out onto the cheecks underneath the eyes. Several light moles on the faces, two on the side of the chin, and one underneath the nose. Definitely neither fat, nor skinny. Thick lips, though. <br />
<br />
I feel each feature with a hand as I stare at it in the mirror. I then open my mouth, and am elated to see a great set of perfectly straight, perfectly white teeth. Front teeth big and long like they&#39;re supposed to be for a kid this age. Nice incisors. <br />
<br />
All-in-all, the kid actually is pretty cute. Cute, in a puppy dog kinda way. Besides, he has great hair, great eyes with great eye sight, great teeth. Great to know my mouth isn&#39;t dirty, and I don&#39;t feel any cavities anywhere. I smiled, and he has a great smile. I frowned. He has an intense look with low dark eyebrows and with a certain luster to the dark eyes. A look of defiance withba fighting spirit. <br />
<br />
Despite being small for his age, this is the sort of kid that would have friends in practically all social groups. He looks nice and kind, not at all a bully. Maybe a bit mischievous. He looks defiant enough where bullies would leave him alone. Maybe even have inroads with the athletes. And he could be friends with the wierdos in band. Also, a little bit of a momma&#39;s boy.<br />
<br />
I feel much better, at least, about the body I&#39;m currently occupying. Despite some of the troubles his mother was yelling at me about, hes overall a good kid. Average to slightly above average in every way. Except for the height issue. In that department, he&#39;s definitely below average. A short kid who probably doesn&#39;t get picked on. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I proceed to brush my teeth and gurgle some mouthwash. Then I head into the bedroom to check out his clothes and out something clean on.</p>
