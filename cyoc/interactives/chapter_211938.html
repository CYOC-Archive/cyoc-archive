<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alice Miller stood outside the shop and stared fixedly at the door. She had been standing in this exact spot for nearly an hour now, trying to work up the nerve to pull the handle and enter. She knew what she wanted could be found inside. This was a magic shop. It was full of items that could satisfy the desires of anyone in the entire world, no matter how outlandish. Alice&#39;s desire was certainly out there. Her classmate, Heather, had told her about this place. Neither girl had divulged what exactly it was they wanted from a shop like this, but Alice had been assured that no matter what it was it could be found here. Swallowing her anxiety, Alice pulled the heavy door open and slipped inside.<br />
<br />
A bell jangled in the distance, one of those old ones that sound like they&#39;re made of cheap tin. Alice ignored it and ducked down one of the aisles. Heather had given her the basic layout. She made a beeline for the costume rack, thinking that she would likely find her prize there. Twenty minutes of searching turned up nothing. She did find a costume that almost fit what she was looking for, but a careful reading of the tag showed that she would have to remain in the full suit to get the desired effect. Alice definitely didn&#39;t want to wear it. She crept towards the accessory section instead. Here there were several promising finds, but they all had undesirable side effects. At a loss, Alice wandered aimlessly in the hopes that maybe she could find her prize by random chance. A polite cough startled her. She whipped around.<br />
<br />
Her meandering had brought her to the back corner of the shop. A long counter stood in front of her and behind it sat a rather large old man. His hair and beard were long and a little unkempt in shades of grey and white. He wore a rather grubby bathrobe over a leisure suit and the feet that stuck out from under the wooden counter were clad in a pair of worn and faded bunny slippers. The man gave another polite cough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help you find anything, miss?&quot; He wheezed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I&#39;m just... just browsing.&quot; Alice stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looked more like you were searching for something specific. I can help you know. It&#39;s what I&#39;m here for. Tell me what it is you want and I can get it for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice blushed and bit her lip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah,&quot; the man said knowingly, &quot;One of those ones. Young lady, I have been in this business for several of your lifetimes now. There is nothing you could ask that would honestly surprise me. I have heard requests that would turn your stomach, and fulfilled worse. So go ahead, tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice told him. He raised his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Strange.&quot; he muttered. &quot;Not the strangest though. I have heard very similar requests from others in recent years, though none with the specifics you require. Let me see now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man turned and rummaged through some boxes on the shelf behind him. He pulled out several strange looking tools, bits of metal, a length of leather strap, and a small pink gemstone. He arranged the items on the counter in front of him and began to work. Alice tried to watch what he was doing but his hands seemed to move in impossible ways that made her eyes water. She swore that at one point he had several more than he normally should, and several times they seemed to pass through each other. She never knew how the various bits assembled themselves into the collar he eventually held up for her inspection.<br />
<br />
It was made of black leather, which was odd because the leather he chose had been brown. The shop&#39;s lights glinted off the polished silver buckle and glittered in the pink gem that hung from it. The whole thing seemed to glow darkly in his hand. Alice reached out to take it, but the old man held it up out of her reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast my girl. This is a powerful magical artifact. I have made it to your exact specifications, and while I see you have thought most carefully about how it will function there are certain limitations to my own abilities. While wearing this collar it will certainly function exactly as you desire, but the instant you remove it its enchantments will come undone. No one will remember what had truly transpired while you wore it, but they will see you clearly without it. Be prepared for this, or you might have some extremely difficult explanations to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand.&quot; Alice breathed, her eyes locked on the shimmering leather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you?&quot; the old man replied, his voice dripping with skepticism. &quot;One last time I will warn you. Be careful where and when you wear it, and especially careful where and when you take it off. I bear no responsibility for what might happen to you. Now, that will be 50 gold sovereigns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t... have any, um... sovereigns.&quot; Alice stammered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have then?&quot; the old man asked incredulously.<br />
<br />
Alice pulled out her wallet and counted the contents.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have about 200 dollars, a handful of quarters, and a Starbucks gift card.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; the old man sighed and covered his eyes with a hand. &quot;I seem to have gotten myself mixed up at some point. My apologies, miss. 75 dollars should be equivalent.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice handed over the money. The old man took it, counted it carefully, and slipped it into a large metal chest beside his seat. Then he took the collar and placed it into a wooden case which he wrapped in brown paper tied off with twine. He handed the package to Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last warning.&quot; he said as she took it. &quot;This collar has been attuned to you and you alone. Do not let anyone else try to wear it. I cannot guarantee that there won&#39;t be any... unpleasant side effects for them. Or you for that matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice nodded and clutched her new purchase tightly to her. She half ran out of the shop and didn&#39;t slow down until she had reached the bus stop. She spent the entire ride home paranoid that somehow, someone might find out what it was she was carrying. When the bus reached the stop nearest her house she nearly knocked down several other riders as she barreled out the back door and sprinted down her street. She didn&#39;t stop until she was safely in her bedroom with the door locked securely behind her. She had done it. She had it now. This would make all her perverse little dreams come true.<br />
<br />
She started as she felt something run down her inner thigh. She lifted the hem of her skirt and looked down. Her panties were soaked through with her arousal and a single drop of her juices had escaped. Alice couldn&#39;t believe how wet she was. It looked almost as if she had pissed herself. Just the thought of what this collar could do had her more aroused than she had ever been in her entire life. She carefully placed the wrapped box onto her bed and dropped her skirt to get a better look. The wetness had soaked into every inch of fabric she could see. She turned to look at her backside and saw that it was worse back there. She picked up the discarded skirt and found a noticeable wet patch on the back from where she had been sitting on the bus. She wondered if anyone had seen it as she had rushed off. She decided that she didn&#39;t care. She needed to try the collar out. Now.<br />
<br />
Alice quickly stripped out of the rest of her clothes. She kicked her sandals off while pulling her shirt up over her head. Her bra followed immediately after. Her panties stuck a bit as she peeled them off, strands of lubricating slime stretched from skin to fabric as she pulled them away. She threw them into her hamper where they landed with a muffled splat. Now naked, she ripped the wrapping off of the box and nearly tore the lid off in her haste to get it open. The collar lay inside, nestled in the satin that lined the boxes insides. She lifted it out carefully, hands shaking in anticipation. She carried it to the full-length mirror hanging from her closet door and watched her reflection as she fastened it on.</p>
