<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff took another look as his tyrannosaur mate. She might not be fully-grown by saurian standards, but she was magnificent to him. With her raw brute strength and his superior intelligence, they would be unstoppable. They could truly be the king and queen of dinosaurs. The eggs she will be laying later on would certainly hatch into strong offspring that would be the beginning of a mighty clan.<br />
<br />
But despite that, Jeff found the prospect a little hollow. What good was having a mate if they couldn&#39;t really speak to each other? When her intelligence was barely more than that of an animal? Was she really his mate or was she basically a pet? Well, yes, she will be laying his eggs, but the mother of his children ought to be more than a savage predator. But if she were a sapient like, imagine her power, her mind, her body...<br />
<br />
The last one was enough incentive to make Jeff start up the Chronivac. It only took a moment to find the Chronivac&#39;s scan feature and scan the tyrannosaur in front of him. Looking at her specs, Jeff could see that she impressive stats in terms of strength, endurance, and speed. Her intelligence and agility were obviously not nearly as good. The first thing he did was go to where it said &#39;Feral&#39; and replaced it with &#39;Sapient&#39;. That immediately changed her specs very considerably. But there was more to be done here.<br />
<br />
He adjusted her stats in several ways, making her closer to his ideal mate. That included making her smarter than the average sapient, though not as much as Jeff himself. After all, Jeff had the advanced knowledge of a human teenager while sharing his brain with an adult Tyrannosaurus who had 20 years&#39; experience surviving in this savage land. He also made it so that she also had a secondary stomach meant for digesting plant matter.<br />
<br />
Once he had set up her new profile as extensively as he could think of, Jeff hit enter. But immediately after that, a warning appeared on the screen.<br />
This extensive change will consume all available power. Chronivac will go into hibernation mode until charge is fully restored. Estimated time to restore all power: 12 hours. Do you wish to continue?<br />
<br />
Jeff had to stop and consider that one. This one extensive change will be the only change he’ll be able to make today. The Chronivac may not even be fully charged before sunset so he’d have to wait some time the next day before he can make any new changes. Well, considering the enhancements he’s already made to himself and with Jahff there to help him survive, he should be able to make it 24 or so hours without the Chronivac. Especially if he’ll have better help from his mate. That would definitely make it worth it. With that, Jeff hit enter.<br />
<br />
The female let out a moan as she crouched to the ground. Jeff watched with concern as her form started altering. The most obvious difference was that she was shrinking. While not a full-grown tyrannosaurus, she was still bigger than Jeff. Her body was diminishing as she got closer to Jeff’s size. There were noticeable changes to her shape as well. Her torso was starting to collapse, losing its barrel shape in favor of something slimmer. With a grunt, the female fell onto her knees, something Jeff wasn’t sure was anatomically possible before. Her legs were changing as they became more proportionate to her smaller body, though not looking less muscular or shorter because of it. There was a meaty crunching and squelching sound as her forelimbs suddenly surged in size. Soon her claws touched the ground before they reshaped a lot. Her two fingers were doubled before a thumb extended from the side. Her new hands were equipped with sharp claws like Jeff’s, but yet they still looked slimmer than his. The arms they were connected to were also muscular, and yet more slender compared to Jeff’s.<br />
<br />
Just after the arms were finished, there was a sharp crack as the female lurched backwards. The groan she let out was still saurian, but noticeably female. The reason for the sudden shift in position was that her hips and spine had realigned. Her body would no longer be held parallel to the ground, now she would stand upright. Her torso collapsed down onto a more humanoid frame, her shoulders and waist becoming more clearly defined. Then she shrank down further to a more feminine frame, her waist becoming narrower as her hips widened for egg-laying.<br />
<br />
But his mate’s most feminine characteristics were yet to form. Beneath her tail, her ass was beginning to swell with muscles and extra padding. A pair of brown spots appeared on her chest, scaly areolas forming before her nipples pushed out for the first time. Then she let out an unmistakably female moan as her flat chest started swelling out. Cones formed before swelling out into mounds, then orbs. The female’s head had shrunk down to fit her new body, her skull reshaping to make room for her larger brain. Her scalp darkened as new follicles took root before extending. Raven-black tresses descended down from her head, over shoulders, trailing down her back until they got to her ass.<br />
<br />
When the female opened her eyes, new intelligence shown in them. She wasn’t a mere feral anymore, she was as sapient as her mate. Putting her feet under her, she stood up easily. Looking at her mate, she saw that she was now a little shorter than him, being 11 feet tall now. Though while she admire her mate’s strength and cunning before, how she could how truly handsome he was.<br />
<br />
Jeff was admiring his mate’s new form quite a lot as well. Like him, her body was built for strength, with toned muscles apparent under her leathery hide. But she was also built for beauty, with a curvaceous body and large breasts that were proportionately about a DD-cup. It might seem like an odd idea to put breasts on a reptile, but there was a reason to back that up. Sapient hatchlings require a lot of nutrition and calories, something that their parents might not always be able to bring back home. The mother’s mammary glands provided for much of the nutrition they needed when hunting and gathering is scarce. Likewise, she also had a secondary plant-processing stomach in case there’s a lack of meat to eat. Her brain was also an evolutionary asset, each generation of sapients becoming smarter than the previous one. Her hair…ok, Jeff admitted the hair was mostly aesthetic, but he still had his own.<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” asked Jeff, his words still intelligible to him seven if they came out in growls and hisses.<br />
<br />
The female was also able to truly understand his speech for the first time, not just the general meaning. “Irae,” she said in a deep, raspy, but feminine voice. Her name. The word came so simply to her. There were so many new words she had now. But there was one in particular she was interested in. She walked over to Jeff, her hips swaying and breasts bouncing in a new way. She put a clawed hand on his chest and asked, “Mate?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I’m your mate,” said Jeff, putting his hand over hers.<br />
<br />
Irae move closer to him, pressed her breasts on his chest. “Mate?” she repeated.<br />
<br />
Ah, that wasn’t just a simple inquiry of confirmation, that was an open invitation. Jahff had spent a lot of seed before the hunt, but he felt his dick rising to meet her request. “Yes, mate,” he growled.<br />
<br />
Irae grinned, showing her many sharp teeth. She then turned around and lifted her tail. She certainly had a very fine ass now, that couldn’t be denied. But Jeff didn’t want to just rut like an animal now. “I’ve got a better way,” he said. He gently lowered Irae to the ground before flipping her onto her back. He crouched over top of her, keeping a hand on his dick both to keep it hard and aim it properly. He nuzzled at her snout before drawing her into a kiss. Irae was quickly to pick up on the concept and Jeff was glad his saurian lips were still capable of that. And while they were in the midst of kissing, Jeff aimed his dick and plunged down into her cloacha.<br />
<br />
Irae let a moan as she felt him enter her again. “Feels good…” she moaned as he started thrusting into her. He started slow at first. This wasn’t just about mating, this was for enjoyment. And he knew how to make her enjoy it more. He reached up and grasped her breasts in his large hands. Irae gasped as she felt Jeff molding them around in his palms before he put his mouth to one nipple and stated sucking on it. “Feels better…” moaned Irae.<br />
<br />
Now that she was stimulated, her womb would open wider for him. Jeff started thrusting with more earnest. The female beneath him moaned as she began bucking against him. She lifted up her strong but shapely legs to wrap around Jeff and pull him closer. Jeff gladly pushed in harder, his knot tapping at her entrance before pushing in. Irae’s moan hit a higher pitch as she convulsed on the edge. Before long, the two tyrannosaurs let out another mating roar as Jeff shot another load of virile seed deep into her.<br />
<br />
This time, Jeff was content to just lay on top of Irae, who was hugging him close. When his knot untied, they’ll be free to go hunting again. Perhaps they should start looking for better shelter. He recalled seeing a waterfall yesterday. Perhaps they could go seek it and establish a more permanent home there. They would need to build a nest for the eggs that Irae will be laying in a few months.</p>
