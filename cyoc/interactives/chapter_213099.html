<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah peered out her bedroom window at the dirt road just outside her house, anxiously tapping her fingers against the window-sill is she waited for her friend Marta’s signal. It was already deep into the night, the whole village was already asleep, preparing for an early day of farm work – just like any other day. In the distance, a gleam of polished metal and plastic shimmered in the night as it slowly made its way down the road. It was a car – a device so ubiquitous in the surrounding towns but absolutely alien-looking in the humble little Amish community that Sarah called home.<br />
<br />
The burbling engine of the vehicle slowly sounded louder and louder as it approached, making the nineteen-year-old girl leaning against the windowsill all the more nervous. She never told anyone in her family she was regularly hanging out with an outsider and, to say the least, it was generally frowned upon to get too close to someone outside the community. Marta was a friend that she’d met on one of her rare trips out of town. She worked at a beauty store that Sarah had bought some shampoo from who seemed fascinated about her modest lifestyle. Sarah hadn’t the faintest idea why.<br />
<br />
Life here seemed like it was two hundred years behind everywhere else. The outside world seemed much more exciting, filled with all sorts of interesting things and experiences. Marta just seemed so much more worldly than her even though she was a year younger and Sarah envied that deeply. She still wasn’t even sure why Marta had insisted upon visiting her in the dead of night in the first place. She figured Marta would be driving her somewhere fun, but she didn’t say much… just something about something called ‘Yiffr’.<br />
<br />
Sarah caught the car’s headlights flash several times just outside her house before the engine’s growling suddenly ceased. That was the signal to meet her outside. She grabbed her bonnet and set it on her head, snuffing out the candles in her room one by one until she reached the one next to the picture of her fiancé, sitting just next to her copy of the Bible. She winced a little as she stared at the man in the photo, wondering how he would feel about staying up late and making off with Marta. She shivered, already feeling ashamed of herself for sneaking out.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, Jed.” Sarah sighed, tipping the picture frame facedown so she didn’t have to stare at her future husband while she walked out the door. With that, she snuffed out the last candle on her nightstand and tip-toed outside her family’s old farmhouse towards the dim car.<br />
<br />
“Umm.. h-hello?” Sarah squeaked, peering inside the sedan’s tinted passenger-side window before knocking on the door. “Marta, are you there?”<br />
<br />
The teenager flinched as the door on the other side clicked open, the girl’s head jolting up as she saw Marta on the other end smiling at her.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Sarah. Come here!” Her friend greeted her with a hushed shout, sliding over the car’s hood and embracing her tight, delivering a quick peck on her cheek. Sarah tensed up in the younger girl’s grasp, blushing as she realized she hadn’t any clue how to respond to getting kissed! Marta lived just a dozen miles away, but it seemed like the two were from different planets. While Sarah’s dress was the sort modest and antiquated black-and-white apparel common to all woman in her village, Marta’s was anything but. In the faint moonlight, the teen could vaguely make out the outfit her friend was wearing. The feeling of a rough leather vest chaffed against her arm. The outfit opened up with a zipper in the center, proudly displaying Marta’s cleavage that was loosely held by a loose-cut black top. She wore tight-fitting denim jeans hemmed in by a studded belt around her waist and there were more studs than just the ones on the belt. Her nose and lower lip each bore a shimmering silver piercing while her ears each shared an even number of steel studs. There was even another piercing just above Marta’s eyebrow - Sarah didn’t even know it was possible to even have one there!<br />
<br />
“H-hello, Marta.” Sarah stammered, blushing as she waited for her friend to release her. “It’s… nice to see you again.”<br />
<br />
“Nice to see your pretty little face too!” The younger girl smiled back before letting go of her embrace. “Oh! Before I forget, I got you something.” Marta swung open backset door and leaned over to rifle through some junk she kept in back, she returned a few moments later, carrying a giftbox. “It’s for you. Check it out!” Still shaken from the sudden physical contact, Sarah shot her friend an overwhelmed look as she lifting the lid off the box to reveal-<br />
<br />
“Oh. There’s bottles with… umm… goo?”, Sarah narrated as she fished through the present, eventually lifting one of the containers to read the label.<br />
<br />
“That’s Aquapure moisturizer, sweetheart. Don’t tell me you’ve never heard of it!” Marta giggled, “It’s the best one out there. I recommend it in all my customer’s routines.”<br />
<br />
“Oh… umm – of course I know!” Sarah lied, “I’m not some naïve Amish girl, you know. I still know how this modern stuff works! I use aqua-gizers all the time!”<br />
<br />
“Glad to hear it! I thought a girl like you working out on the farm in the sun could use some skincare stuff.” Marta smiled, “I thought it would mean a lot to you seeing that your family doesn’t let you go out into town much but I guess underestimated you! You already have a skincare routine down pat, don’t ya?”<br />
<br />
“Heh – yeah.” Sarah choked out a chuckle while thumbing through all the beauty products. “But I do appreciate it all. Really I do. So umm… let’s see here… Which one’s the ‘Yiffr’ that you mentioned? You said you came here to do that with me tonight?”<br />
<br />
Marta snorted out another laugh. “Well you’re not gonna find it in there. You said you used it before, didn’t ya?”<br />
<br />
Sarah blushed again, realizing she made another faux pas. “Yeah! Just joking – I know what it is! I do ‘Yiffr’s all the time too!”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad.” Marta smiled back, the eighteen-year-old starting to quiver with nervous anticipation as she anxiously stared out towards the barn, fishing her phone out of her pocket and handing it to Sarah. “I really appreciate you helping me out like this. Really, I do. This is the first time I’ve ever done this before and changing sounds so exciting… but also really scary. Just having someone who knows how it all works stand by me means so much.”<br />
<br />
Sarah was visibly taken aback as Marta gave her the phone, the Amish girl realizing she’d dug herself into a hole she knew nothing about. “You’ve… never done it before?”<br />
<br />
“Not once.” Marta said with a hint of unease, “But I heard all sorts of good things about it. So… um… do the changes hurt a lot?”<br />
<br />
Sarah averted her gaze from Marta as the other girl tilted her head towards her expectantly. What should she say? Marta had stepped out of the comfort zone of her town to the countryside, and now she wanted her help… but she hadn’t the faintest clue what she was even talking about! The farmgirl swiped her fingers this way and that around the screen, miraculously coming across the answer to one of her questions. “Yiffr” was one of those phone apps. There was a button for it on screen right there. Sarah let out a muffled huff of relief, turning towards Marta and saying with feigned confidence, “Yeah. Don’t worry, it doesn’t hurt at all. You’re safe with me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m so glad, the transformation part always scared me the most.” Marta said with a sigh of relief as she walked in the front of the barn door. “Okay, can you open it up?”<br />
<br />
Sarah obliged, unhooking a lever from the large gate and creaking open the old family barn for Marta. The animals stirred inside as the moonlight swept in from the entrance, the pair of girls walking down the center aisle as Sarah continued to fiddle around with Yiffr, trying to understand what’s got her friend so nervous about it.  The farmgirl figured that phone apps were made to be easy to use, but she couldn’t make heads or tails of it. The words “Marta’s Change” was headed at the top of the screen along with a big button with “Go Wild!” on it. There were also all sorts of pictures of farm animals under a tab called “matches” that caused Sarah’s eyes open wide in shock.<br />
<br />
She knew these animals. And these weren’t just her neighbor’s animals, but also her family’s. From their goats to their donkeys to their loan Clydesdale stallion they use to hitch their buggy to, each and every one was listed there! What the hell was this thing? Did it just sense the animals around them, or was someone spying on her family somehow? Worried but curious, she cautiously pressed the big “Go Wild” button, looking around her to see if something happened – but nothing seemed to.<br />
<br />
“Heh. It’s sure smelly in here. I didn’t realize the smell got this bad.” Marta chuckled nervously, pinching her nose. “I didn’t realize you had so many animals in here. M-maybe I’m not ready for this after all.”<br />
<br />
“Yup, my family has all kinds.” Sarah said matter-of-factly, eyes still focused on the phone. “You’ll get used to the smell. Just think of it like a cold water bath, the more you try to avoid going in, the worse it gets. Just dunk yourself in and take a big whiff of air.”<br />
<br />
“A big whiff?” Marta shot her friend a queasy look before relenting. “Alright. I guess… I have to get used to it anyway, right?”<br />
<br />
The city girl turned her nose upwards and huffed in a big breath of barnyard air. She winced, eyes watering as the stink of manure and animal sweat invaded her nostrils, almost making her gag. But to the girl’s surprise, Sarah was right. It only took half a minute, and suddenly the acrid stink didn’t seem as sharp as before. In fact, it was starting to smell… good.<br />
<br />
In the dimly lit barn, neither girl could see the skin on Marta’s petite nose devolve into a leathery pink, a new sense of smell forming starting to uncover a cloying scent that starting to draw her nose outwards. Marta licked at the new smell, her lips growing fatter as the rogue lipstick she was wearing shed away, leaving an animalistic, fleshy pink hue in their place. Both her nose and lips started to merge together, squeezing out into a small muzzle as that hot bestial perfume entranced the girl, leading her down the aisle towards its source.<br />
<br />
Sarah followed along, still scrolling through the Yiffr app, unaware of what was happening to Marta. The city girl’s chic boots seemed to melt away against the strain of the pressure forming inside them. Black leather stretched like latex before tearing effortlessly, giving way to giant, onyx-colored hooves fit for a draft horse. The heavy disks of keratin crushed whatever remained of Marta’s footwear as her calves and thighs lost any suggestion of girlish subtlety, bulging out underneath her tearing tight jeans as animal muscle and fat piled onto her reshaping legs. Despite everything, Marta seemed both unaware and unphased by the sudden sensation of her knee joints inverting as she took on a distinctly digitigrade gait. The sensation wasn’t unlike walking on high heels, but far more stable – and louder. Ever step produced an echoing clop that sounded thoughout the stable. Maybe Marta would have noticed that obnoxious sound, had it not for Sarah’s Clydesdale stallion eagerly pacing back and forth in his tall, mirroring the clopping of Marta’s new hooves. <br />
<br />
“Neghiihii.. wow… he’s so big.” Marta half-nickered with a dreamy look in her eyes as she leaned against the horse’s stall door, peering up at the massive creature before her. “I bet you’ve had lots of fun with this big guy before, haven’t you, Sarah?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, that’s Brandy. He’s gentle despite his size.” Sarah explained, eyes still glued on Marta’s phone. “But fun? I guess he plays around sometimes.”<br />
<br />
“Nehh… that’s good.” Marta huffed, reaching out a hand to stroke the horse’s cheek. “He… smells really good.”<br />
<br />
The eighteen-year-old just couldn’t explain it. For some reason, the stud just oozed some sort of animal magnetism, drawing her closer and closer towards him. She put more of her weight on the stall’s door as her legs grew longer and bulkier, her jeans tearing as equine fat and muscle bubbled in her rear. That tight, teenage bubble-butt of Marta’s bloated out obnoxiously with wobbly horse flesh. Pristine peach-colored girl skin grew soft, yet firm, a padding of brown and white fuzz painting over both of her butt cheeks as they took on distinctly equine proportions, making her butt look more horse than girl. A long blonde tail “popped” from her tail bone, brushing along the rim of her swollen anus as it too became obnoxiously equine. Her puffy pink tail hole twitched as it shifted to a velvety, black anal sleave perched precariously between her thick buns. Every move of her legs and every wayward jerk of her tail caused her butt muscles to tense and squish that fat black ring between her ass cheeks, sending jolts of newfound bestial lust to the teen’s brain.<br />
<br />
“Hah-… he’s so friendly.” Marta squeaked, unable to pay attention to her changes as Brandy dipped his head down towards her neck, nibbling at her sweaty skin with those plump horse lips of his. Marta leaned in closer to him, biting her own fat bottom lip as she savored the feeling of getting doted on by such a masculine creature, her whole body starting to capitulate to him as the changes flowed down her neck. The zipper on her leather vest undid itself as her torso started to bloat out. Hide matching that of the Clydesdale’s peaked out through tears in her T-shirt as her breasts starting to inflate. Her mammaries throbbed fatter and fatter under her shirt with every teasing nip from the horse above her, those sensitive mounds of feminine flesh beginning to shift and migrate down her belly. The thin layer of fabric covering her chest gave up the ghost as a sudden wave of girth caused Marta’s belly to barrel out, letting her new boobs hang free. Two fat, dark grey balloons of mare leather flopped out, the fleshy bulbs of marehood beginning to inch down towards their rightful spot just below the girl’s belly. Now that her breats were free, it was clear to see that Marta had piercing on her nipples too, two steel studs still implanted in that wobbly mare udder as those udders took their rightful spot on her groin. That pair of sensitive horse teats began to rub up against the wooden gate separating Marta and Brandy, finally making the eighteen-year-old peer down and realize what had been happening to her.<br />
<br />
“S-sarah…” Marta squeaked out terrified a half-whinny from her short muzzle as her hand traced down the leathery skin on her belly to palpitate those hefty udders perched between her legs. Sarah sensed the change in Marta’s voice, looking up from the smartphone only to see something that scared her half to death. Marta looked like she was fused to a horse’s rear from the belly down, her asinine features completely undisguisable from a draft horse! Tears were starting to well in Marta’s eyes as Brandy started to nibble her more aggressively. The girl kept her heavy body propped up against the gate for dear life as she weakly pleaded to her friend, “I changed my mind! I don’t want to do this! Reverse it! Reverse it!”<br />
<br />
Yiffr did this!? Sarah throttled the phone in her hand as she frantically scrolled through the app, looking for a reverse button. All the while, Marta’s voice devolved into whimpering whinnies as more of her body was captured under the sway her bulging equine features. Her torso bulged out as her arms began to shake, those two appendages visibly getting stiffer, longer, and stronger as Marta struggled to keep herself supported on the stall’s door. In a matter of moments, the wooden gate to Brandy’s stall crackled in agony, shredding into splinters underneath Marta’s bulk. Her hands instantly hardened into hooves before she even hit the ground, leaving Marta on all fours, quivering as she tried to hold up her hefty form. Everything but her was now head replaced with that of a Clydesdale mare, the barrier between her and Brandy laying shattered on the floor. Nothing was there to keep the new mare from Brandy, nothing was there to keep Marta safe from that two feet of horse cock eagerly bobbing underneath the stallion’s belly.<br />
<br />
“BRANDY!” Sarah shrieked as she rushed to protect her friend. “Don’t you dare! She’s a human! A person, damn it!”<br />
<br />
The farm girl desperately tried to shove the ton of stallion away from her distraught friend, but it was no use. Maybe she could guide Brandy around when pulling a carriage, but she was simply no match for a horny stallion eying a mare in heat. The giant Clydesdale easily brushed her off, his huge, swaying erection slapping Sarah in the face as he trotted towards the former human trying to make her escape. Marta slinked outside the barn awkwardly on all fours, tears still dripping from her mostly human head as she spot Brandy coming after her. In a matter of seconds, Brandy had already hopped onto her back, hugging her enormous belly between his forehooves as that fat mottled python of stallion lust battered away at her mare butt, sloppily seeking her entrance.<br />
<br />
“NO! STOP!” Sarah screamed, charging at Brandy to try to save her friend. She grasped at his cock to make sure he didn’t hit his mark, but even his dick was too much for her. Brandy’s penis was so big she couldn’t even grasp in two hands, and it was far stronger than her to. That muscular stallionhood flexed in her grasp, the enormous flare slamming against Marta’s plush horse butt, squelching loudly against her as it left gooey strings of precum where ever it slapped the changing girl. Much to Sarah’s terror, she watched as that huge slab of stallion meat slap its inflated glans right between Marta’s butt cheeks, plapping against a still human vagina.<br />
<br />
Somehow, Marta’s pussy hadn’t changed yet – it was still human, even though every inch of flesh around it had changed into a horse’s. Its skin was still a pristine human pink… and much to Sarah’s chagrin, it was pierced too. Sarah tried with all her might to dislodge that bulbous horse cock from Marta’s quivering quim, but Brandy’s sheer strength kept it planted there, precum oozing from the stallion’s cock tip as beast flesh lewdly made out with Marta’s human skin. Brandy’s thick pre-jizz sizzled against Marta’s blushing pussy as the new mare leaked out vaginal juices against that flared tip. That human flesh was no match for that steaming hot rod of stallion lust, blushed pinker and pinker until the color started to darked into a distinctly black animal hue. Her labia bloated out with plush leathery skin, stretching wider as they absorbed every ounce of Brandy’s precum. Those plumpening lips started to slurp and squelch around the stallion’s cock tip as her fattening, pierced clit began to wink needily, betraying Marta’s humanity is it flicked against Brandy’s flared glans. It only took about a minute for Marta’s blushing pink pussy to fill out into a fat gushing mare cunt, the girl’s body eager to get fucked by an animal even as Marta continued to cry out in lust-drenched horror.<br />
<br />
Sarah winced as she saw that steaming hot mottled cock tip sink inside her friend. She wasn’t able to protect her like she promised. She lied to her about knowing how to use the app to try to impress her, and now this happened. Worst of all… Sarah couldn’t even focus on saving her friend, her mind lost in a haze of lust all its own. Watching Marta change - it all made her hornier than she’d ever been in her life. Watching her friend get reduced to an animal… it just made her shamefully and desperately hot!<br />
<br />
Marta squealed out in pained pleasure as an entire horsepower of equine lust slammed against her gaping mare pussy, horse goop splattering all over Sarah as the two animal’s groins madly spanked against one another. Marta was a complete wreck, screaming and whinnying as her face jutted out into a complete muzzle. Fur covered the human skin she’d work so hard to keep beautiful as the flesh underneath became thick and bestial like a horse’s. Her ears pulled up into points and her long hair shifted in a brown mane. Marta kept her blue irises as they too grew into large equine orbs and shifted to the side of her muzzle. She was a horse now… Only her eyes and a few clinging scraps of leather even suggested that she could have been human once, that… and the piercings embedded in her ears, nose, eyelid, teats, and clit.<br />
<br />
Fiery hot heat radiated from the pair of mating animals as the huge stallion introduced Marta to her new life as an animal with a brutal fucking. Sarah kept a lustful eye on her poor friend, watching her ebony pussy lips strain to their limits as they were stuffed full of horse meat. The smell of raw horse sex was singeing the inside of her nostril, the air around the two fucking animals getting so thick with evaporated horse sweat and precum that the barn felt like a sauna. The Amish girl never realized that all this time the horse she’d groomed, rode, and cleaned up after was a sex God – and now Marta knew it too.<br />
<br />
The new mare snorted and squealed with every powerful thrust, drool seeping from her fat rubbery horse lips as her body rocked back and forth to the motion of the stallion’s hips. Those giant, unwieldy hooves of hers clattering against the barn’s cum-drenched floorboards as Marta thrust back as hard as she could, the once terrified girl now desperate for animal cock to sate her first ravenous animal heat.<br />
<br />
The stallion on top of her obliged, bugling out a rumbling whinny as his giant foal factories strained and slapped Marta in the rear, pumping out a deluge of cum into former human to ensure the new mare would become a mom. The mare’s head jolted up as a sudden wave of steaming hot yellow piss evacuated from her rear, drenching the stallion’s cock in her first animal orgasm as Brandy continued to pump inside her. Marta just kept her head down, drooling and snorting as her insides were flooded with molten-hot animal cum, a dumb-look of bliss plastered on her face as she enjoyed Brandy’s warmth filling her. Without any fanfare, the stallion slid off her back, his flared cocktip slopping out of her stretched out rear as a tidal wave of cum oozed out from Marta’s puffy black cunt lips. Sarah watched as that cocktail of horse jizz and mare honey stream down her friend’s legs, the frothy mixture dribbling down her swollen horse udders as it dripped off the tips of her teats.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay, Marta…?” Sarah whimpered, petting the mare along her rump to try to calm her down. As bad as it was, she just couldn’t keep her eyes on that engorged black horse vulva drooling out animal semen. “There’s gotta be a way to reverse this. You said there was, right?”<br />
<br />
Marta didn’t respond. The dumb-and-satisfied look of bestial lust as plastered on her long face as she dipped her head down and began nibbling on the grass below her. The early morning sun was starting to paint the black night sky with a band of red, meaning that there was little time to help Marta before her family got up. What happened to Marta’s phone anyway? In all the horror of her friend changing, she wasn’t even thinking about it… did she drop it?<br />
<br />
Sarah looked down, answering her own question as she found that dark square of black plastic bathed in a gooey sheen of horse goop on the grass. She’d dropped it while trying to help her friend… and now it was covered in Marta’s and Brandy’s…<br />
<br />
“Gross...” Sarah blushed, picking up the wet smartphone that was drenched in her friend’s maregasm.  She tried turning it back on, only to find it wasn’t working, the screen didn’t light up. “Oh no. Why’s it not working? Are you not allowed to get it wet?”<br />
<br />
Sarah tried wiping it clean with her dress and shaking it every which way… but it was no use. The screen stayed a dull black, reflecting Sarah’s flustered expression right back at her.<br />
<br />
“I’ll save you.” Sarah promised Marta as she ran out of the pasture, leaving her alone with Brandy. “I swear to God I’ll save you. I’m so sorry. This is all my fault…”<br />
<br />
The farm girl snuck back into her house and stealthily made her way back to her room. She lit all the candles again, setting the phone on her nightstand and curling up in a ball on her bed. Sarah clutched her copy of the Bible she kept her bed and turned the picture of her fiancé, Jed, right side up again. She needed help, but how could she tell anyone what had happened? Would her father help her? Would Jed? Or would they just hate her…<br />
<br />
Sarah whimpered as her head swam with muddled thoughts. She’d hardly been able to process what just happened… what it meant for Marta to become an animal. Was Marta even still in there? Did the sex… feel good? Did she even have a human soul anymore or did she have a…<br />
<br />
Sarah gulped. “A horse’s soul?”<br />
<br />
What would happen if she died? God wouldn’t treat he like an animal, would he? Maybe that would be for the best because having relations with an animal would surely send her to hell. This was incomprehensibly bad. But then… why was she…<br />
<br />
Sarah gasped a lust filled moan as she peered down and realized she’d been fingering herself, stroking blushing pussy lips with fingers soaked in the same sticky horse sex that covered the phone.<br />
<br />
She hated herself. She was the worst. The worst. Her friend Marta had lost her humanity thanks to her and all she could think about was how arousing it all was. Turning into an animal was so terrifying… but also just so inexplicably hot too.<br />
<br />
 “Please God, I can’t stop thinking about it.” Sarah whimpered, “Help me. Help Marta…”<br />
<br />
The phone suddenly flickered on again on Sarah’s nightstand, startling the shaken girl at first before she grabbed it, hugging it to her chest. “Yes! Thank you! Now bring up Yiffr again!”<br />
<br />
Sarah saw it as a sign from God, for redemption! But unfortunately, the phone didn’t seem to start the same way it did before. “Water damage: Requires Factory Reset.” The screen read, displaying a button reading “OK”.<br />
<br />
“O-okay.” Sarah agreed with the screen, not knowing what it meant. She clicked the button, watching the phone reinstall its OS until a screen appeared asking information on the phone’s user.<br />
<br />
“The User? I’m Sarah. S-a-r-a-h.” She typed into the screen, letting the phone scan her fingerprint to make a profile on her. She heft out a sigh of relief as the phone displayed the same application screen that Marta had on it before – but all the apps weren’t there! Where was Yiffr? Sarah had no idea that the phone’s drives had been wiped and it took her a while to figure out how to reinstall Yiffr using the App Store.<br />
<br />
“Okay. Yiffr’s back… but it’s not right.” Sarah reasoned, “It should say it going to change ‘Marta’, but… it says…”<br />
<br />
“Sarah”, read the top of the app. It shouldn’t have been possible. The app was only supposed to change the phone’s owner but that meant…<br />
<br />
Sarah slammed the phone back on the nightstand, interrogating it with a glare. Yiffr was supposed to change Marta back… but now it wasn’t even her friend’s phone anymore. It was hers… and that meant…<br />
<br />
The farmgirl felt a wave of heat sizzle along her aroused sex once again – the heat of anticipation. She could do it too. She could change just like Marta did. She could be an animal too… if not just for the night.<br />
<br />
Sarah wrestled with the thought in her head, averting her gaze from her the picture of her fiancé, feeling too ashamed to even look at him. They were supposed to get married in a month. Sure, he wasn’t much of a looker, but he was a good man. Her father seemed to like him at the very least since he’d pushed him and her towards getting wed. It was the right thing to do to marry him… she shouldn’t be having these disgusting thoughts about losing her virginity to a feral animal… But…<br />
<br />
Sarah turned the picture back down so she didn’t need to appeal to Jed and set her Bible back on the night stand. Marta could wait. Sarah knew exactly where she was and she’d be safe on the farm until she figured out how to change her back. Jed could wait too. Sarah figured she could just change for an hour, have sex, and come back like nothing ever happened. It was the only way to sate her curiosity, the only way to get rid of these awful thoughts. What Jed didn’t know wouldn’t hurt him, and what she was about to do would hurt him a lot if he knew…</p>
