<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The eco-terrorist when he first learned about the cat virus was pissed off and decided to make a new one. This one was similar to the cat scratch virus but it makes them into a different animal instead. However it was unstable like the cat scratch virus, so when he injected Jason when he passed him after picking him to test it out on. It&#39;s started affecting Jason like the cat scratch fever.<br />
<br />
Jason headed straight up to his room once he got back home. Normally he would&#39;ve gone down to his basement workshop, but he was extremely drained and in no mood for computer repair today. Stripping down to his boxers, he threw on his ratty old pajama shirt, carefully lowered himself into bed to avoid upsetting his stomach, pulled the comforter over himself, and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
It was some hours later when he woke. He was nauseous again, and rushed to the upstairs bathroom, arriving just in time to heave his guts out into the toilet. He waited for a few minutes to make sure it was over, then rinsed out his mouth and headed back to his room,he then heard something hard clacking on the linoleum floor of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Wait, Clacking!?<br />
<br />
Jason looked at his feet. Sure enough, they had become hard and hoof like, his legs had also slimmed down quite a lot and his ankles were now higher up on his legs. Both of his lower legs were now covered in fur. So it wasn&#39;t cat scratch, after all. It was something completely different.<br />
<br />
Jason managed to suppress a yell. There was no sense in waking his mother; she would have to deal with the changes that were happenning to him eventually. But she could do that in the morning, when she wouldn&#39;t lose any sleep over it.<br />
<br />
Jason, on the other hand, had to deal with it right now. He knew from the educational video that if he was going to become a cat-person nothing could be done about it if it had been cat scratch, but that didn&#39;t stop his heart from pounding or his pulse from racing. Realizing that there was nothing to do but get it over with, he made his way back to bed.<br />
<br />
Time passes slowly when sleep won&#39;t come, and very few things keep you awake like the prospect of becoming an entirely different creature over the course of the night. Jason lay on his side, mind racing. What would happen to him? How would his mother react? Would his classmates treat him differently? What about the people in his church? They professed Christian love for the victims of cat scratch fever, and he had always found them to be decent, kind people, but what if he&#39;d misjudged them? Would people still trust their computers to them once he was a whatever he was becoming like they had when he was human? Most importantly, what if he became a girl?<br />
<br />
That, of course, was the single biggest worry, and came with its own little set of sub-worries. The worst thing for male cat scratch victims was the knowledge that the odds were against them remaining male; about three out of every four men changed by it became women, whereas only one out of fifty women became men. Now with what was happning to him this fear and all its attendant concerns - will I like boys, will boys like me, will I have to wear dresses and skirts and act girly - increased and raced through Jason&#39;s head, keeping him awake and nervous even when sheer exhaustion was trying to drag him back to sleep. He finally managed to put it out of his head, convincing himself that it wouldn&#39;t happen; after all, he reasoned, one in four victims is many orders of magnitude better than the odds of winning a lottery, and people won lotteries all the time. Even if he didn&#39;t exactly know what he was becoming he knew it was similar to cat scratch. Thus reassured, he drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
It was very late that night when he awoke again; fortunately, he wasn&#39;t nauseous, he just had to go to the bathroom. He made his way over to the bathroom, taking the opportunity to inspect the changes. Cramming his neck to see behind him he could see that he now had a long black and white tail with a tassel in the end swishing behind him now for one thing, somewhere around 3 or 4 feet long possibly. He could feel it swishing around lazily behind him as he emptied his bladder, then he examined himself further. The changes had reached his navel now; the entire front of his lower body was covered in fur, including his penis, which, he noted to his great relief, was still perfectly intact. His legs and hips had changed even further without gaining any of the telltale curves; he was safe.<br />
<br />
True, there were a few cases with cat scratch where the gender change came last of all, but these were extremely rare, only one sex-switched person in a thousand had that happen. The huge majority of transgender cases had the sex change make its way up the body at the same time as the rest of the transformation; Jason could still recall a chilling candid photo featured in the health class video of a teenage boy, his lower half transformed, staring down into his sweatpants in horror as he realized that he was becoming a she.<br />
<br />
No, Jason&#39;s manhood was safe, and that was the important thing. The only change he&#39;d have to deal with would be becoming an animal person. He idly noted that the fur down the middle of his abdomen, tapering down past his crotch to the underside of his tail, was a black and white pattern. Yawning a deep and exhausted yawn, he returned to bed after undressing and fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.<br />
<br />
Jason awoke late the next morning; a glance at the clock revealed it to be almost noon. What a crazy dream he&#39;d had! He had dreamt that he&#39;d come down with the flu, only it turned out to be something similar to cat scratch fever, and he&#39;d spent most of the night alternating between puking and panicking, only getting to sleep when he finally confirmed that he wasn&#39;t turning into a girl. Crazy, but he didn&#39;t feel even slightly nauseous, so he must have dreamt the entire flu ordeal. He rolled out of bed, stood up, and stretched, placing his hands on his buttocks as he leaned backwards.<br />
<br />
He stopped. His buttocks were curvier than he remembered. His hips were wider. His hair had fallen into his face when he&#39;d rolled out of bed. And there was an unfamiliar weight on his chest, which turned out to be two large fur covered breasts. He couldn&#39;t feel the weight of is dick and balls. he checked and found not only were his cock and balls gone but he now had an unfamiliar weight where they had been, a large floppy pink udder with four teats sat there and since he had an udder he could guess that he now had pussy instead of a dick and balls. His udder was currently hurting a bit but not enough to be painful. Just uncomfortable. He screamed at the sight of his udder before quickly running to the bathroom which was a bit difficult with hooves and his large udder sloshing and jiggling all around to see what other changes there were. <br />
<br />
His face from the nose down had pushed out a bit to form a small muzzle along with his nose changing to one that he recognized was a cow&#39;s, his ears had also lengthened and become covered with black and white fur the same color as the fur covering the rest of his body and reaching up to ouch the top of his head he could feel two small horns poking through. He was covered in black and white fur from head to toe with no skin to be found anywhere. His legs were long and slim ending in a large black hoof, his arms and hands had also slimmed down and with as with the rest of his transformation become feminine. The nails in his hands had become black as well as much tougher and his hands were completely furry like the rest of him. Looking more at his face in the mirror he could see that his eyes were large and cow like, and when he spoke his voice was higher pitched but not quite that high as to be annoying to him. Later on when speaking more or shouting he now she, would now realize that she would tend to Moo a lot. Dreading what he would find underneath his new udder he decided to sit down on the toilet before venturing his hand down there. Slowly moving his hand around his lower body he felt around for a pussy, stifling a gasp when two of his fingers went inside and came out slicked with moisture. It felt amazing.<br />
<br />
He had become a girl, but at least he&#39;s not a cat girl! Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be so bad after all she now thought as she continued fingering her new pussy and mooing in pleasure.</p>
