<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry for the formating error for the quiz-sheets, I hope now it´s better.<br/>
Okay, the side doesn´t take more then one empty space between the _, so I don´t know how to make it fitting better.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty tested how his new ability worked by simply changing things in his room. Another color for the carpet, another type of bed, repairing a cracked board in his shelf. Everything worked as he willed it to be. He even animated a couple of toys in the room for a few minutes.<br />
When he was satisfied with his smaller tests on inanimate objects, Ty developed a plan. He had already seen he could change Dustin, so he guessed the same was true for others. To test this, he looked out of the window, seeing their nosy neighbor in the garden.<br />
First, he let the man, who was nearly forty years old, get older. As Ty watched, the man´s hair got less full looking, and grayed away from the dark brown it normally was. From the distance it wasn´t easy to spot, but his skin got more and more wrinkled, and his posture looked like his back was killing him.<br />
Before the man could do as much as think about what just happened, Ty decided on the opposite way, making him regress back into a five-year-old boy. It was similar to getting older, reversing the former changes. His hair got browner and fuller again, his posture straightened up and his skin become smoother again.<br />
But then he started to get smaller as he got younger than he was before. Ty also could see, through the slipping clothes, that the man had gained some weight, or better he lost it over the years. Soon, their normally forty-year-old neighbor was a five-year-old child, looking confused as to why everything was so big around him.<br />
Ty turned him back to normal, and added that he wouldn´t remember anything that happened to him in the last few minutes. The man returned to his garden work, as if nothing had happened.<br />
“Just one other thing to test” Ty thought, spotting a squirrel running up the tree in front of his window. Suddenly, the squirrel froze on the branch it just reached, and as far as Ty could see, it´s eyes had glazed over.<br />
The squirrel slowly started to turn into a small human, it´s fur receding, legs reforming and getting longer, claws vanishing. When it was a full miniature human, it started to grow a bit, around thrice its old size. That was when Ty stopped it, not wanting the poor animal turned human to break the branch and tumble to death.<br />
Instead of it becoming a squirrel again, Ty turned the now tiny human into a bird. His arms shortened a bit as they were covered in feathers, along most of its body. Its feet hardened into talons, its former small muzzle, as it was now a separated mouth and nose, fused together again into a beak.<br />
In just a few minutes, Ty turned the squirrel first human, then into a small eagle. He let the now eagle gain the knowledge it needed, and seconds later, the bird flew away from its old life as a squirrel.<br />
Completely satisfied, Ty was sure he could make his life better, and punish his foster parents and Dustin for being mean to him. <br />
--<br />
It was later that day when Ty had an idea what he would like to do. And he could simply test it on his foster parents this evening, just now with a set result. Grinning, Ty made his wishes, soon to change the family.<br />
Shortly later, June called him to make their dinner, just like it was normal for them. Ty tried his new abilities for making the dinner be ready faster, which also worked without a hitch.<br />
After the dinner was eaten, Ty started his test by handing out the short crossword quiz to the three of them, Dustin, June and Mark, willing them to just take the test without question. He had made these tests up with the intention of them changing the writer along their given answers, while also making sure they would think the changes were normal, and to not notice changes the others would go through.<br />

Dustin, still in his now underdeveloped body he had gained earlier, was the first to enter the answer (1) “Plump” in his quiz, answering for another word for being fat. Just when the last letter had been written, his frame suddenly expanded outwards, letting his weight double in no time. While before Ty´s initial changes to Dustin, he had a more muscular build, the changes this morning had made them less apparent.<br />
Now, before Ty´s eyes, Dustin´s normally slim line turned round, quickly pushing his too large shirt to its limits. It slipped a little bit up over Dustin´s extending belly, not reaching down to the already strained belt he had used to fix his jeans in position. He had, unperceived by himself, already opened the belt, taking some of the pressure away. While he gained his new weight, Dustin smiled at the easy answer. “It isn´t as if some of my friends call me plump all the time.”<br />
Another easy question was about the answer (2) “Fifteen”, as to at what age someone would be allowed to drive these newer, motorized scooters that had been recently added to the market. It wasn´t any visible change for that, as with the underdeveloped change before his body already looked younger than he was. Just a bit of baby fat was added to his face. Dustin laughed silently at that answer. “That´s easy, as I just turned old enough to use them.”<br />
With the first letter “N” given, Dustin answered the question about the adjective, about a computer loving person, would be given in school, next, with was a (3) “Nerdish” in the quiz. “Just like I´m nerdy, hehe.” To underline this point, Dustin suddenly had glasses on his nose, and freckles all around his face, fitting the classic nerd cliche perfectly.<br />
The longest question in his test was about what was the common term involving both brothers and sisters, written down through the “L” from plump at the third spot. (4) “That´s siblings, just like I have three of them” Dustin thought, his mind shifting to seeing both his parents as his siblings, along with Ty. They were a family of foster siblings, after all.<br />
The last question on his sheet by now had only four letters with one given already. The last “S” of siblings was the third letter of the missing word, the question was about the girlfriend of some singer he only had read about. After thinking a few seconds, he remembered that particular name in question was (5) “Lisa”, just like his foster mother. His birth parents had died in a car crash three years ago. Dustin had ended up in the orphanage Ty had been in before, and as Ty and Mark visited them from time to time, they had quickly befriended the new kid. <br />
Dustin gave the finished quiz to his brother and friend Ty grinning. “That was easy, Ty.”<br />
Ty himself grinned at his now rewired brother. Maybe Ty would let him remember his just overwritten life later, but not now.<br />

June had taken Ty´s test slightly hesitant, thinking it could be something bad. Ty had never given her any reason to belief so, but she feared he would turn out a criminal in the future, and this could be something from the school. She was surprised it was a simple crossword quiz, and had the sudden desire to answer it.<br />
The question about a boy in a story she had read before was easy, as his name was (1) “Simon”, just the same as himself. It didn´t occur to Simon that he just had renamed himself, as Ty, when he made the quiz, thought that he didn´t want a sister in their group. <br />
While Ty watched, June´s body reformed. Her breasts sunk back into her chest until you couldn´t see anything of them anymore. Her form as a whole got a bit more muscular, thickening her arms and legs. As June, she hadn´t done any workout, being rather slender. The changes in her gender beside the chest weren´t visible, so Ty couldn´t see her vagina reserving itself, pushing out into a cock. Her female reproduction facilities turned outside and reformed into a ball sack, properly filled. June was now officially Simon, a young man.<br />
A question about what age you need to get a driver´s license was quickly answered with (2) “Sixteen”, and he giggled when he remembered how happy he was to finally be able to drive. Without pause, Simon begun to get younger, regressing back into a sixteen-year-old boy. The just thickened muscles of his arms and legs shrunk back a bit, as his younger body hadn´t worked out as much as his older one had. He could still be called a jock by someone like Dustin, but it wasn´t that much.<br />
The third question he answered went through both already written answers, taking the “N” from sixteen as its sixth letter and the “S” from Simon as the last letter. It was the same question as Dustin had, not that he knew that, about (3) “Siblings”. A smile went over his face as he thought about his foster siblings Mark, Dustin and Ty. They had been his support when his parents were killed while he was on a camping trip with them. It had been a quick decision that he would life with them all, instead of going into an orphanage.<br />
The question around the “I” of sixteen coughed his eyes next, an important piece of clothing for babies that was disposable. As he wrote in (4) “Diaper”, he got a bit red in embarrassment. He had a kink to wear diapers all the time, something only his parents had known, and that by accident. His foster family didn´t know, beside his brother Ty, as he helped him get them sometimes. Unbeknownst to him, he also was by now dependent of them. <br />
The last question, ending in the “B” of siblings, asked about a term for someone a bit lacking of intelligence. As the letters for the word (5) “Dumb” were written down by him, he felt his mind slipping, his IQ dropping a few numbers. Yeah, that wasn´t hard, the others called him stupid or dumb sometimes, and at least for his siblings, he knew they loved him just for being himself.<br />
With a stupid grin, Simon handed his test back to Ty, before he looked over it again. It wouldn´t do to overthink his answers, it would only end in him getting a headache.<br />
Ty grinned at his now dumber brother, a more fitting role for his former foster mother by far. That she, now he, would be the fittest of the three was a bit ironic, as before she had been somewhat nonathletic and unfit.<br />

As Mark took his quiz from Ty, he was annoyed. All that boy did was being a piece of work for him. Whatever he would get now would only be more work. But just like the other two members of his family he felt he needed to answer the small quiz he had been given.<br />
He started with the longest word in his quiz, the same one as Dustin and Simon had, (1) “Siblings”. His annoying little siblings Ty, Dustin and Simon. Why he thought about adopting them as his siblings and not his kids, he wasn´t sure. Ty had asked him for Dustin when they visited him at the orphanage, and Simon had been their best friend who lost his parents, and he had sprung in and adopted him as well.<br />
The second question was the same as Simon´s about the age needed for a driver´s license. As he wrote in (2) “Sixteen”, his body begun to regress back into his teen years. He grinned prideful, satisfied he got his license on his last birthday. He loved driving, and his siblings loved being driven by him more than by their parents.<br />
The short question down from the second “E” from sixteen was about what you would do with breakfast, and he quickly wrote in (3) “Eat”. It was so like him to now this answer, as he really liked to eat. He wasn´t as plump as his brother Dustin, but also not as fit as Simon. His stomach was a bit round, and he liked it that way. He rubbed his belly unknowingly as it swelled a bit, happy they had just eaten dinner. But he wouldn´t say no to some desserts right now.<br />
The fourth question he looked at, starting with the “G” from siblings, asked about a famous athlete, and he just knew they asked for the name (4) “George”. It was the name of his father, who had willingly adopted first Ty for a brother, then Dustin as another brother, and finally Simon when his family was killed. He was a bit envious at Ty, as his parents loved him seemingly more than him.<br />
The last question, running through the “O” of George, was about what you would call someone who liked to exaggerate much and be also could be said to be big-headed. Mark grinned a little arrogant as he wrote in (5) “Cocky” as the answer, just like he was. At least, if he believed his siblings. To himself, he just loved to show that he was somewhat better than others, but without being mean to them.<br />
With that grin still in place, Mark handed the quiz back towards Ty. “A piece of cake, little brother. Is there some dessert I could get?”<br />
Ty returned the grin as he put cake he had willed to be before on the table. Something to reward his “brothers” for finishing their individual crossword quizzes.<br />
--<br />
Soon after, their new parents walked in, an older couple that always had been good to Ty. Now, they were Mark´s parents, as well as his, Dustin´s and Simon´s foster parents. Ty made sure they would just accept their new role, primary as his foster parents, as he wasn´t sure how long the other three would stay that way. He had to see what his school quiz on Monday morning would turn them out to be, as well as how they would be with him for the rest of the weekend.</p>
