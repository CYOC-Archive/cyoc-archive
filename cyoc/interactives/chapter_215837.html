<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken returns from the shops two hours later, the teen parks his “car” in the garage and steps out, he grins as he gives the car a pat, “good job, Archie,” he says, “you really are a amazing car. I am proud of you, I’m happy I chose you”. Ken chuckles to himself, he then grabs the shopping and heads into the house.<br />
<br />
The teen brings everything into the kitchen and starts to prepare the drinks, snacks and even cooks some food.<br />
<br />
Ken checks his watch, “the guests should arrive soon,” he says, “better get myself ready,” he then heads up to his bedroom and opens his closet. His eyes widen at the amount of designer clothes, “wow,” he says, “hehe… I wonder what part of Jeff the clothes are created from,” the teen picks out a blue suit, a white button up t-shirt, a blue tie, some black socks and some shiny black shoes. Ken then heads into the shower and turns on the water, the teen strips out of his clothes and steps into the shower, letting out a sigh as the warm water hits his body. Ken smirks, “good thing Jeff’s piss has become clean drinkable water,” he says to himself, “hehe… I wonder how Jeff is feeling. I bet he is moaning in pleasure. Man, I am so happy to have decided to transform him into my house, at least he made himself useful for once. Hehe… thanks for volunteering, Jeff!”<br />
<br />
After the shower, Ken gets dressed in his new suit, he steps out of the bathroom, just as the front door bell rings, “cool, the first guests are here,” he says and heads down.<br />
<br />
When Ken opens the door he is greeted by his mother, dad, 10 year-old brother “Nate”, Jeff’s mother, dad and Jeff’s 12 year-old brother “Mike”. Nate and Mike are wearing costumes, Nate has a Tiger onsie and Mike is wearing a fox mask and tail. Ken smiles, “welcome guys,” he says, “Nate, Mike, you both look cute,” he adds, chuckling when both boys blush a little, “please come on in,” he then says and steps aside.<br />
<br />
“Thanks for inviting us, Ken,” his mother says, “this house is amazing! How in the world have you been able to afford it?”<br />
<br />
Ken leads his guests into the living room, “set your gifts just on the coffee table,” he says, he then turns to his mother, “oh, I kinda fell into some fortune,” he says, “you know I like to gamble? Well, I played Black Jack and Poker a few months back, when I visited Las Vegas. I guess I had a lucky stroke”.<br />
<br />
“How much did you win,” his dad asks.<br />
<br />
“Oh, around 1.000.000.000 $,” Ken says, grinning.<br />
<br />
“WHAT,” everyone shouts, “damn,” the two kids add.<br />
<br />
Ken’s parents look at each other, “I hope you won’t push your luck,” they say.<br />
<br />
“Nah,” Ken says, “no more gambling for this teen,” he says.<br />
<br />
“What about school and work,” his father asks, “knowing you, you might just drop out of school and spend the rest of your life chilling!”<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “hehe…,” he says, “nah, I decided I’m done with being lazy. I’ll continue to go to school and get myself a good job. I want to make you both proud of me, after all”.<br />
<br />
His parents smile, “wow, Ken,” they say, “we wouldn’t have guessed that your personality would change to better this quick. That alone makes us proud”.<br />
<br />
“I hope Jeff will one day become more reliable,” Jeff’s mother says, “he is such a lazy kid. By the way, Ken… do you know where Jeff is? Is he also coming to the party?”<br />
<br />
Ken grins inwardly, “I’d assume he’d be with his girlfriend,” he says.<br />
<br />
“That’s what I thought,” Jeff’s mother says, “but she says she hasn’t seen him for at least two days”.<br />
<br />
“Hmm… then I have no idea,” Ken says, “have you tried calling him?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff mother says, “he is not answering our calls, I’m starting to get worried”.<br />
<br />
“You shouldn’t worry,” Ken says, “Jeff is old enough, if he doesn’t turn up in a week, I’d go to the Police and report him missing”.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s dad rolls his eyes, “yeah, and they’ll just tell us: “sorry, we can’t do anything! He probably just run away, that’s normal for teenagers his age!”. And just simply dismiss the report!”<br />
<br />
“It’ll be fine,” Ken assures them, “he’ll turn up sooner or later. Now, enough of Jeff, would any of you like to have something to drink, while we wait for the other guests to arrive?”<br />
<br />
The others agree, Jeff meanwhile, aware of what is going on, is horrified at what an evil slick insane person Ken is. The former teen, now nothing more than an ordinary looking Mansion, screams and shouts, but thanks to Ken’s programming, no one is able to hear him. Jeff also tries to access HIS brain, which is the mother Computer, to send his parents a message, but he just is unable to get pass Ken’s security codes. But Jeff is someone who never gives up, he hopes that Ken becomes reckless and make a mistake, that is when Jeff will seek help… at least that is what Jeff is hoping for.<br />
<br />
The door bell then rings, pulling Jeff out of his thoughts, ‘oh, no,’ he thinks to himself, ‘here come more victims for Ken to mess with. And I can’t warn them!! SHIT!! What the fuck is wrong with Ken?!’<br />
<br />
When Ken opens the door, he smiles when he sees his and Jeff’s friends, all dressed in costumes: Rick, who is wearing a German Shepherd onsie, Darrek, who seems to be wearing a headband with Donkey ears and a tail attached to his belt, Henry, who is wearing a Centaur costume, Dean, who is wearing a horse tail and lastly Thomas, who is wearing a fully body Lizard Costume.<br />
<br />
After greeting his friends, Ken leads them inside the “house” and into the living room where the others are waiting.<br />
<br />
After everyone greeted each other, Ken leads them into the dining hall where he had set up a big table, loaded with all the goods he prepared. “Please,” he says, “help yourselves, there is plenty more in the kitchen,” and smiles when the guests start tucking in.<br />
<br />
“Man,” Ken’s brother says, “this tastes amazing!”<br />
<br />
“I agree,” Ken’s mother says, “I didn’t know you were this good of a cook!”<br />
<br />
Ken grins, “oh, I am full of surprises, mom,” he says. The teen is about to join everyone, when the door bell suddenly rings, “I wonder who that could be,” he mumbles, he then turns to the others, “be right back,” and heads to open the door.<br />
<br />
When Ken opens the door, he sees a group of 6 kids between 10 and 14 and some grown ups, “yes,” Ken asks.<br />
<br />
“Sorry for disturbing,” a man says, “we are your new neighbors and just wanted to come over and say “hi”,” he says.<br />
<br />
Ken smiles, “it is nice meeting you,” he says, “I am just throwing a little party, you are welcome to join”.<br />
<br />
The group looks at each other, “thanks,” a woman says, “but we really do not want to intrude”.<br />
<br />
“Besides,” a man adds, “we saw the people arriving and noticed that they were… well… not as wealthy looking”.<br />
<br />
Ken understands, he chuckles, “oh, you think they’ll have a problem if some rich folks suddenly join?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” they all say.<br />
<br />
Ken chuckles, “don’t worry,” he says, “they are all cool. Your kids can have some fun with my brother who is 10 and his friend who is 12. I promise, they have no issues with rich kids, plus, I have an entertainment room in the basement”.<br />
<br />
The kids looks at Ken, “b-but we have no costumes,” a boy with brown hair says.<br />
<br />
Ken looks at the boy, “doesn’t matter,” he says, “you can still have fun, even without a costume,” he smiles.<br />
<br />
The kids eyes light up, they look up at their parents, “pleeeeeease?!”<br />
<br />
After a while of silence the grown ups shrug, “we can at least give it a try,” a man says.<br />
<br />
“Great,” Ken says, smiling, “please, come in,” he then leads the group into the dining hall. Ken gets everyone’s attention by clearing his throat, “guys, these are neighbors of mine, who came by to welcome me into the neighborhood”.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” they all say awkwardly.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s and Ken’s parents, friends and siblings all smile, “a pleasure to meet you,” they say, “please, join us,” Ken’s dad says.<br />
<br />
The group sits down, “please,” Ken says, “help yourselves to some food,” the kids waste no time and start piling their plates.<br />
<br />
“Boys,” one of the men says, “behave yourselves!”<br />
<br />
“S-sorry,” the boys say, “it… it just smells so damn good!”<br />
<br />
Everyone chuckles, “hehe, looks like every kid is the same,” Ken’s mother says, “no matter if rich or not: can’t wait to tuck into something delicious!”<br />
<br />
After a while the grown up start to talk about grown up stuff, so it doesn’t come as a surprise that Ken, his friends and the kids all start to get bored.<br />
<br />
Ken clears his throat, “sorry to interrupt,” he says, “I just wanted to suggest that we youngsters head down into the entertainment room, while you grown ups discuss… well… grown up stuff”.<br />
<br />
The grown ups all  chuckles, “sure, have fun boys,” they say.<br />
<br />
So Ken leads the group of teens and kids down into the basement, smirking inwardly, ‘hehe… they will not be the same once I am done with them, and with a little reality alteration… most of the parents will leave without their kids,’ he thinks to himself.</p>
