<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How about we go to the dog park!” Josh excitedly suggested. “That way, Fido can get acquainted with other dogs!”<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” Freddy thought to himself. The only thing worse than turning into a dog in front of his family would be changing back to humanity; and in public, no less. He had to be careful not to attempt mating in the dog park. This was going to be a challenge, one Freddy didn’t know if he was ready for. <br />
<br />
“Alright” his father replied. “Let’s go to the park. Come on, boy! We’re going to the park.”<br />
<br />
Freddy’s father continued to tightly grasp onto his leash as they made their way to the park. Fortunately, it was only a short walk back to the house if Freddy needed to make a quick exit. Soon, the sights, sounds and smells began to overwhelm his canine senses as Freddy took in the scenery for the first time as a dog. He had been to this park a number of times with friends who had dogs, but this was a whole new experience for him. This time, he’d be going to the park as a dog. <br />
<br />
As his father and brother led him to the dog pen, Freddy began to feel a sense of nervousness. <br />
<br />
“Oh no” Freddy thought to himself. “Don’t dogs sniff each others butts in order to greet themselves? I’m not looking forward to this.” <br />
<br />
The thought repulsed him, but after initially hesitating in front of the group of dogs, the others took the initiative. One by one, Freddy felt his rear end violated by the prying noses of other dogs. Some had pipsqueak noses like the feisty Chihuahua, while others had slobbery ones like the big St Bernard that spent way too long probing into his butt. <br />
<br />
When it was Fido’s turn to sniff their butts, he hesitated, seeing a confused reaction by the other dogs. When Fido wouldn’t take the lead again, a female German Shepherd took the initiative and stuck her butt in his face. Knowing what he had to do, Fido began sniffing and discovered information about the dog that he never would have learned with his ordinary human one. He could tell, unlike Ellie, that she was spayed so she didn’t give off the secretions that turned him on. The same was true of all of the other dogs in the park, who were either neutered or spayed. <br />
<br />
Fido could also get personal information from their butt flaps, whether it was their previous owners or what they liked to eat. He took in this information, but the part that remained Freddy dismissed it as irrelevant information that would never prove useful. <br />
<br />
After playing around with the other dogs, Josh and his father took Fido out in order to go to a more secluded part of the park. Josh had snuck a ball from the house and held it up to Fido’s snout. <br />
<br />
“I hope you know how to play fetch” Josh said as he rubbed the ball around Fido’s nose. <br />
<br />
“Fetch?” Freddy thought to himself. “I’m not going to play fetch.”<br />
<br />
Fido began to stretch himself out on the grass and laid down in front of Josh. <br />
<br />
“Come on boy” Josh said. “You’re my dog. You have to play with me.”<br />
<br />
“That’s right, Fido” his father added. “Come on, boy. Up you get.”<br />
<br />
After a minute of coaxing from both Josh and his father, Fido reluctantly agreed to get up to get this over with. As Josh yelled “Go get it boy!” and threw the ball a short bit off in the distance, Fido slowly trotted over to where it landed. Upon putting it in his mouth, Fido let out a visibly poor reaction. <br />
<br />
“Gross!” Freddy thought to himself. “Where has this ball been? In manure? Yuck!”<br />
<br />
Reluctantly, Fido brought the ball back to Josh and placed it down at his feet. <br />
<br />
“Good boy!” Josh said as he patted Fido on the head. <br />
<br />
Josh spent the next several minutes tossing around the ball with Fido returning it to him. With each throw, Freddy lost himself in the actions of Fido and soon forgot his disgust with the whole thing in the first place. When Freddy was finally beginning to enjoy this game with his brother, a shift in the wind produced a scent that caught his attention. <br />
<br />
“Another bitch in heat!” Freddy thought to himself as he began to feel a stir in his sheath. “Maybe if I can distract Josh and my lousy father, I can hightail it out of here and try to find the source of the scent.”<br />
<br />
Fido noticed a dog from the dog pen approach with his owner as he formed an idea. <br />
<br />
“Hey!” Fido barked at the dog. “Think you could give me a hand?”<br />
<br />
The dog looked at him curiously, causing his owner to stand still.<br />
<br />
“Think you can bark at my br— I mean, owners for a while?”<br />
<br />
The dog barked an affirmative and began barking loudly at Josh and his father. <br />
<br />
“Ack!” Josh screamed at the top of his lungs. “Make it stop!”<br />
<br />
“Control your dog!” his father yelled at the owner. <br />
<br />
“I’m so sorry” the owner replied as she attempted to scold her dog. “My dog isn’t usually like this.”<br />
<br />
As the commotion was going on, Fido saw this as his opportunity to escape. He quickly did a double take and then proceeded to run as fast as he could towards the source of the scent. Just before he disappeared into the distance, Josh turned around to discover that his dog was missing. <br />
<br />
“Fido!” Josh screamed in anger and sadness as tears began to form in his eyes. “Fido! Where did you go?”<br />
<br />
“Oh no” his father said quietly under his breath as the owner dragged the now quiet dog away from them. “I hope he didn’t run off too far.”<br />
<br />
“Fido!” Josh screamed on a continuous loop as his father joined him. “Fido! Where did you go?”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…..</p>
