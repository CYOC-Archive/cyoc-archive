<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">walking up to him as you stopped to put a hand on his shoulder that you soon told him his punishment to be. he soon stopped and settle down to hear you speak. with fear in his face that he knew he asked for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;ok gator-man, listen up. your punishment is to have same punishment I gave to the bear-man as you&#39;ll train me into a better fighter that once your done and finish with me, you&#39;ll be my second wrestling league fighter starter up back at my place for i&#39;m going to keep you. there may be a third or fourth member that once there, you&#39;ll start building a large structure house for both you to live in, and a place for training and matches. do I make myself clear for you punishment?&quot; you said as his fear soon vanished and lowered his head in shame, just as the bear-man did.<br />
<br />
&quot;if that is what my punishment is which leads me to be, then so be it.&quot; he said. you then curated him to saying boss, sir, or master to you that he soon was understanding what you mean as he acknowledged your meaning and said master to you for you both quickly started on your training for your next match.<br />
<br />
with two matches won now that you had a 50/50 chance of wining the greatest wrestling league match off challenge as your thoughts of being a donkey were now slimmer. you were getting more buff up then before as you were soon ready for you next match that the snake-man and the mistress came in with a bag in hand for she knew what his punishment was while telling him to pack up. she told him that he was fired as she then glares madly at you once more while saying she now lost yet another fighter because of you, yet somehow squeezed in an extra match she made to replace the one she&#39;s now losing to replace the one she just lost to you for you realized she now has an anthro black crocodile man.<br />
<br />
just like before that with a snap of her fingers as she sighed, the gator-man with his pack bag of belongings in hand had vanished. fading from sight as he was shortly at your place while being your wrestling league fighter starter up that feeling the two beast-man were going to be ok back home is where the croc-man simply moves right on in to take the place of the old one. shortly after, they lead you out of the room that she told you to feel lucky on winning half the the match so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;you should feel lucky, now that you&#39;ve won about half of the challenge you made. still, you won&#39;t be turned into a donkey as I said that I can still simply make you into something more fitting for you for you only have two more matches left. sooner or later, your luck&#39;s gonna run out.&quot; she said angerly as she had to go through something for what you had done for the gator-man you somehow let him free from this place, but at the same time that she seemed more happy about your winnings.<br />
<br />
it wasn&#39;t long till they both were leading you back to the ring, were your next fighter of the four challengers was waiting for you in the ring. once again, you get into the ring as you ready yourself for your match. once in the ring that you can see in all of his glory as he was already ready and waiting you in the ring, still thinking about his tail then who you were up against might be something to worry about in the match.<br />
<br />
&quot;here&#39;s your challenger, folks. for those who are just now coming here today with us is where he&#39;ll be fighting our four boys in a four on one round match off that he has won against two of our very own beast-man and gave his punishment as he&#39;s still on a one on one in each match for there are still two more rounds to go. if he should lose, even by default is where the ring mistress here will see what he&#39;ll receive of a lesser prize for if he should win it all that the grand prize is all his. with that in mind, fighters. . . at the ready in your corners.&quot; the MC said that the audience of the crowd was going wild for the match up you once claimed as the crowd roared and quickly cheered on.<br />
<br />
looking back at the corner that how were you going to pull this off without fooling anybody? it was some time later for the MC to start up the third match of the four rounds. as you both prepare to fight that he thanked you for both the bear-man and the gator-man as he showed a hand out while taking it for a shake for he then wished you luck.<br />
<br />
you wished him luck as well, but you needed it the most while hoping to see the out come of this match in one piece. seeing no fear out of him, you knew he wasn&#39;t like the two you fought before as you sent the two boys at your home for there punishment. the MC soon started up again while you wondered why he stalled this time around.<br />
<br />
&quot;is everyone ready?&quot; the MC said that the crowed cheered, but the the MC teased the audience as he left a hand closer to his ear. saying the one line as the MC did this made a louder cheer from the crowed that the MC was stun at how loud some could be.<br />
<br />
&quot;well that&#39;s more like it. still, let the match. . . begin.&quot; the MC said as the bell shortly rang for the match to start that your wrestling against one of the beast-man for you were facing off with....<br />
<br />
(this is a coin flipper that if it lands on heads, you face off with the kangaroo. if it lands on tails that you face off with the T.rex. will you win against one of the two beast man left?)</p>
