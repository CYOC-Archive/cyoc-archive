<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took nearly an hour to sort out, mainly because Mel kept refusing to take on any baby traits.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to be stuck in diapers!&quot; Mel whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to have much choice.&quot; Heather snapped. &quot;We need to balance this evenly or Hillary will be stuck as a drooling infant for half a year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe that wouldn&#39;t be so bad...&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather glared at her friend. Without the diaper&#39;s magic interfering she was now back to her regular strength, and it was considerably more than Mel&#39;s. She never liked doing it, but if she had to she could pin Mel down and force her to cooperate. Mel knew this quite well.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was only joking.&quot; she muttered apologetically.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn&#39;t funny. Try reading a few more of the forum posts. Six months of this starts to get to people, and from what I&#39;m reading, when Hillary snaps out of it she will remember every detail. Other people who have been through similar cases have had major problems coping with that. We&#39;re talking PTSD here. We are NOT doing that to Hillary, and YOU are going to share this burden with us since it was YOUR idea to do a tandem to begin with!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel&#39;s shoulders slumped in defeat. She tapped at her phone screen a couple of times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I&#39;ll wear diapers. Do I have to be incontinent, or can I get away with other people just thinking I am?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked at her own phone. The bar at the top still showed Mel as having the least amount of the three. By a significant margin. She looked at the available options and weighed things out in her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;  she said firmly. &quot;Not unless you want to take on some other trait to balance it. It looks like being unable to dress yourself or being unable to feed yourself would cover it, but I don&#39;t think you want those. You could take a few smaller ones, like only drinking from bottles or needing a pacifier, but it suggest you suck it up and take incontinence. You were more than happy to push it onto me, after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel grumbled for a bit, then tapped a few more things on her phone. Heather watched her bar slide up a few notches.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that still not enough?!&quot; Mel complained loudly. &quot;How are you still higher than me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather scooted herself around until she could see Mel&#39;s screen. She reached out and tapped an option, sending Mel&#39;s bar up until it was nearly at the 1/3 mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Mel said firmly. &quot;Absolutely not. If I&#39;m going to be stuck in diapers for a few weeks, I want to be able to change them myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you better get used to the taste of baby food.&quot; Heather snapped back. &quot;Our options are limited. Look on the bright side though. If I&#39;m reading this right, we should be able to change each other&#39;s diapers. And it&#39;s only diapers. We can still dress ourselves, and get to wear our normal clothes too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel grumbled some more, but didn&#39;t undo the change. She tallied things up, and looked even more frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still short.&quot; She said glumly. &quot;Can&#39;t you or Hillary take a little extra? It won&#39;t make much of a difference.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to spend even more time in diapers? This has to be even. It&#39;s the only way to be sure. Even a couple of points difference could extend the time by weeks. It&#39;s too unpredictable to know how long it would actually be. An even distribution is the only way to guarantee the shortest time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll take the pacifier then, but you have to take it as well! If I have to do this, then I don&#39;t want to be alone in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather didn&#39;t care about needing a pacifier. She had bigger things on her mind. Two of them. she tried to shake the image of her mother breastfeeding Hillary out of her head again, but it was stuck firmly. Since Hillary was her sister, she had insisted on being the one to choose her options. This gave her an excuse to see just how many points breastfeeding would give her without tipping Mel off. It was a lot. Breastfeeding was one of the most expensive traits on the list. She wanted it so badly, but she knew that Mel would notice if she took off any other traits to balance it. She desperately dug through menu after menu, trying to find some way to offset it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you almost done?&quot; Mel asked impatiently. &quot;I want to get this started. The sooner it starts, the sooner it will end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just hold on, alright? I&#39;m trying to figure something out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hurry it up! I need to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I suggest you go now. It will probably be your last chance to use the toilet for a couple of weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel got the message. She took off for the bathroom as quickly as she could. So quick, in fact, that she left her phone behind. Heather saw the opportunity, and took it. She tapped and swiped through menu after menu as fast as she could. She knew there had to be some traits in here that would lower her points if she took them. She finally found them in the very last submenu. The one she desperately did not want to touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; She said bitterly. &quot;Shit. Shit. Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
She glared at the options before her, weighing them up. It wasn&#39;t what she wanted, but it was the price she would have to pay for what she did want. She selected a couple of options, adjusted a few sliders, and jumped back to the other menu to select breastfeeding. She stared nervously at the meter. It was perfectly divided into thirds. She let out a breath she hadn&#39;t realized she&#39;d been holding.<br />
<br />
Mel came back into the room a few minutes later.<br />
<br />
&quot;What took you so long?&quot; Heather asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I decided to take a shit.&quot; Mel said bitterly. &quot;So I wouldn&#39;t have to deal with it in my diaper right off the bat. The longer I can put that off, the better. Are you done yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Heather said, slightly nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s go! I want to get this over with!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather nodded, and tapped the button marked Finalize. Mel did the same. A timer popped up on their screens, counting down from a minute.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is it.&quot; Mel said. &quot;No turning back now. Three weeks, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Give or take.&quot; Heather replied. &quot;It will certainly be shorter than our other options.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel grunted, and stared at her phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should sit down.&quot; Heather said.<br />
<br />
Mel looked up at her, then hastily sat down. Both girls braced themselves for what they knew was coming.<br />
<br />
The timer reached zero.<br />
<br />
The world spun violently, then came to a screeching halt.<br />
<br />
Heather and Mel picked themselves up carefully. The spinning hadn&#39;t been as bad this time, but the loud noise hadn&#39;t been expected and it left their ears ringing. They sat there in a daze for a moment, then looked at their phones.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like... 23 days, 12 hours, 38 minutes, and a handful of seconds.&quot; Mel groaned. &quot;Just over three weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather&#39;s phone said the same. She looked around the room. It hadn&#39;t changed. Her bed was still normal, as was her desk, and the changing table was still there, though it seemed to have gained some extra diapers. Slightly smaller ones, she noted. She looked at her desk again, nervously. Sh had half expected it to be half its size again, with the dreaded toybox next to it, but it was perfectly normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.&quot; Mel groaned. &quot;Why do diapers feel so weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked over at her friend. Mel was poking the bulge that had appeared in her pajama bottoms. It crinkled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Better get used to it. You&#39;re stuck with it for three weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t remind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls were interrupted by the sound of footsteps racing down the hall. Something slammed against the door, the knob jiggled as someone fumbled with it, then the door flew open to reveal Hillary, breathing heavily, and with a look of horror on her face. She was wearing her usual sleeping attire, an old ratty t-shirt and tight pajama shorts, but they just made the bulge of a diaper far more obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;What. The fuck. Was that.&quot; She panted.<br />
<br />
Both teens looked at each other, then began explaining. It took less time than they thought. When they were finished, Hillary just sat there staring at nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I have three weeks of this?&quot; She asked, tugging at her waistband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Mel said. &quot;And so do we, so don&#39;t get pissed off at us. This is partly your fault too,&quot;<br />
<br />
Hillary didn&#39;t argue. She really didn&#39;t have time. Mandy pushed open the door behind her, and poked her head in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bedtime.&quot; She said, looking down at Hillary. &quot;Do you need a change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Hillary said, poking at her diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about you, Mel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m good Mrs. L.&quot; Mel said, poking her diaper as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Hillary, bed. Heather, you come with me for a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel looked stared confusedly as Heather slowly and carefully got up to follow her mom and sister from the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; She asked. &quot;If you need a change we have a table right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Mandy said. &quot;We just need to do our nightly routine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather awkwardly followed as her mother lead her down the hall to her own bedroom. Her awkwardness was three-fold. Firstly, the diaper she wore was thick enough to give her a pronounced waddle. Secondly, it was rubbing against her quite hard, especially her clit. And thirdly, the diaper was holding a decently sized toy in her passage. One with all sorts of little knobbly bits that rubbed her insides as thoroughly as the diaper was rubbing her outsides. She had to suppress a moan with every step.<br />
<br />
Mandy&#39;s bedroom was dimly lit, and exactly as Heather remembered it, with one exception. There was a large rocking chair in the corner. The same chair that had briefly been in Hillary&#39;s room. Mandy closed the door, took Heather&#39;s hand, and lead her over to it. Heather stood in a daze as her mother sat down in the rocker and made herself comfortable before pulling up her shirt and undoing the cups of her nursing bra. She then helped heather remove her pajama bottoms, pulled her oldest daughter into her lap, and guided her lips to a nipple.<br />
<br />
Her first taste of her mother&#39;s milk exploded across her tongue. It was like nothing she had ever tasted before. Better than anything. She suckled harder, trying to get as much of it into her mouth as she could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy there baby girl.&quot; Mandy said, wincing. &quot;There&#39;s plenty of it. It&#39;s not like you have to share with your siblings anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather barely heard her. She was lost in the flavor. But not so lost that she could ignore her other need. Her hips started wiggling and she moaned with frustration.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Her mother soothed. &quot;Give me a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather heard the ripping of her diaper&#39;s tapes as Mandy tugged them free. She felt the cool air of the room on her privates as the front of her diaper was pulled away. Then she felt her mother&#39;s warm fingers as she caressed her bared skin. They trailed down until they found the base of the dildo and gave it a light tug, causing Heather to moan once again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you had this in since I last changed you?&quot; Mandy asked. &quot;No wonder you&#39;re in such a state. Let mommy help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gripped the dildo, pulled it out several inches, and plunged it back in again. Heather would have screamed if her lips hadn&#39;t been locked to Mandy&#39;s nipple. Instead, she moaned even louder as her mother began gently fucking her with the large toy.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go. Is that better, baby?&quot; Mandy cooed.<br />
<br />
Heather couldn&#39;t answer. She was entirely lost in the dual pleasure of her mother&#39;s milk, and the toy assaulting her pussy. This was nothing like what she had felt in any of the scenarios. In there it had been lots of teasing with the occasional explosive orgasm, but this was just a constant wave of non-stop cumming. She could feel her insides gripping and squeezing the dildo as it was pistoned in and out of her. She could feel every bump and knot as they slid past her sensitive folds.<br />
<br />
Then it stopped.<br />
<br />
She whined and bucked her hips feebly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on, baby, I need to switch sides.&quot;<br />
<br />
The nipple was pulled from her lips with a pop and Heather gasped in a breath before the other one took its place. She suckled this one just as furiously as Mandy began toying with her again. Though she was in a state of constant orgasm already, she could feel something building inside of her. Her mother must have noticed something as well, because the toy began moving faster and faster. Heather sucked harder and harder, and her hips rose up to meet the toy as Mandy pushed it in one final time.<br />
<br />
This orgasm was indescribable. The sheer pleasure of it washed all thought from Heather&#39;s mind. Nothing but wave after wave of pure bliss was her entire world. As it passed, the world faded in slowly. She was still in her mother&#39;s lap. The taste of sweet milk was still on her tongue, but the nipple was gone. Her crotch felt warm. She slowly craned her neck to look down. Mandy had grabbed the front of the diaper and was pressing it firmly against her hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;All done, baby?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked blearily up at her mother&#39;s face. Mandy was smiling warmly down at her. The smile of a mother who loved her baby dearly. Heather nodded weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let&#39;s get you cleaned up and back to your room. It&#39;s almost bedtime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mandy pulled the diaper away again. It had been mildly damp before. Now it was completely soaked. The sodden padding was pulled from under Heather&#39;s rear and set aside. Then Mandy gripped the dildo again and carefully pulled it free, causing Heather to squeak as she did so. The toy was bigger than Heather had expected. It had felt big enough inside of her, but to her eyes it seemed absolutely massive. Many set the toy aside as well, then helped her daughter to her feet.<br />
<br />
Heather Didn&#39;t think she could stand after that. Thankfully, she didn&#39;t have to. Mandy pulled a changing pad from beneath the bed and gently lowered her onto it. Her diapering was quick and efficient. Mandy carefully wiped her daughter clean, using several large wipes to do so, rubbed on a generous amount of cream, then taped her into a fresh diaper before sliding her pajama pants back on.<br />
<br />
Getting back to her room was a chore. Mandy had to support her along the way, but by the time they reached her door, Heather had regained enough strength to stand unaided again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, baby.&quot; Mandy said quietly, and kissed her on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night, mommy.&quot; Heather whispered back. Then she slid into her room to find Mel waiting, arms crossed.</p>
