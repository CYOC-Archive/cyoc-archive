<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom finished his drink, gulping it down, and without a second thought he walked outside of the bar with the alluring stranger. <br />
<br />
They were already halfway down the block when he realized that they were holding hands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you...did you put a spell on me?&quot; he asked as a gust of wind blew autumn leaves in their faces. Tom sounded a bit frightened, his voice betraying a deep fear that had never truly gone away. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, dear. Relax. I&#39;m not like Kylie. Unlike her, I value consent. You have nothing to be afraid of.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t even watch Hocus Pocus anymore without getting a little freaked out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziza smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;WandaVision must have been like a horror movie for you then. A witch holding a whole town hostage sounds just like what Kylie did to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s WandaVision?&quot; Tom asked as they reached the motel. <br />
<br />
*Hmm, maybe this dimension never had that series* Aziza thought to herself as she pulled the key to her room from her pocket. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, just a TV show.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never heard of it.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two young adults entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really a sorceress?&quot; Tom asked. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes&quot; Aziza answered as she shut the door behind them. <br />
<br />
The two spent the next couple of others just talking, getting to know each other.<br />
<br />
Tom had wanted to know how she had become a sorceress. <br />
<br />
Aziza said that it had been thrust on her, that she hadn&#39;t really asked for it. Which was the truth. <br />
<br />
Tom wanted to know more, and Aziza told him how the god Enlil had come to her and gave her the responsibility of safeguarding reality, along with her partner. Something about their mindsets made them the best ones suited for the task, which Aziza admitted she still had trouble believing sometimes. <br />
<br />
&quot;As a Muslim, growing up I had believed sorcery to be a sin, but then I saw how chaotic and unreliable reality actually was, and I felt that I had a responsibility to keep people safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever died?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh heavens, hundreds of times. But there are fates worse than death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you&#39;re like...a good witch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmm. You could say that. I&#39;m not a bad witch, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie Perkins was an evil witch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmhmm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s so wild&quot; Tom laughed as he rested on the bed. &quot;Ten years ago, none of this magic stuff seemed like it was real. I never watched The Wizard Of Oz as a kid. It was too girly for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aziza smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that makes two of us. I was never into this stuff either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now magic is everywhere. Kylie&#39;s curse really fucked with everything. I saw a fire hydrant once lift itself out of the ground and chase someone down the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That won&#39;t happen with me. I&#39;m just here to heal people, and fix everything that Kylie broke.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really doing this out of the kindness of your heart? You&#39;re not getting paid for it? You&#39;re not starting a cult for people to worship you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope. Who&#39;s going to pay me, Gandalf?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziza didn&#39;t tell Tom about her relationship with Kylie, but she did tell him how her girlfriend had died recently and how she had dealt with it really badly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; Tom said sympathetically. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s OK&quot; Aziza said back. &quot;We&#39;ve all lost someone. I should have known better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grief doesn&#39;t work that way&quot; Tom replied. &quot;You never know how you&#39;re going to react when the thing you love the most is taken away from you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It took me a long time to realize that. Even sorceresses don&#39;t know everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t judge you for whatever you did, even if it was bad. You seem like you have a good heart.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you. You seem like you have a good heart too, Tom. You&#39;re far from a bad person.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you finally get around to fixing Jennifer, could you tell her that she&#39;s a good person? She really needs to hear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course. Like I said, it&#39;s on the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious&quot; Tom reiterated.  &quot;She&#39;s been doing a lot of soul searching since Kylie happened and regrets how she behaved back then.  She&#39;s changed a lot. She feels really guilty and needs a win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have my word, Tom. I will heal Jennifer. I just need to do a few other things first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK. I trust you. I don&#39;t know why, you&#39;re a total stranger, but I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aziza thought to herself about everything Kylie had told her about Jennifer Smith. <br />
<br />
Kylie had really hated her. Jennifer had humiliated Kyle so many times and made Kyle feel horrible about himself.<br />
<br />
Tom didn&#39;t remember any of this thanks to the curse, but once upon a time, he had bullied Kyle as well, sometimes at Jennifer&#39;s request. <br />
<br />
Pretty much everyone at Glendale High had bullied Kyle at one point or another. <br />
<br />
Aziza had been sympathetic towards Kylie, because she saw how much pain her peers had caused her. She was a nerd too. She knew what it was like being picked on. <br />
<br />
But people can change. <br />
<br />
If Aziza didn&#39;t believe that Jennifer and Tom could change, like she had tried to help Kylie change, she&#39;d be the world&#39;s biggest hypocrite.  <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;So...you said earlier that you weren&#39;t finished healing me yet&quot; Tom said with a lasvcivious grin, holding hands with Aziza. &quot;I hope that&#39;s what I think it means.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t be disappointed&quot; Aziza said, with her own wicked grin. <br />
<br />
With a gesture, Aziza had removed both of their clothes, which were now hanging on a chair in the corner. <br />
<br />
Tom and Aziza were now a pair of naked, young horny pretty people. <br />
<br />
Aziza jumped on top of Tom. <br />
<br />
As Tom groped Aziza&#39;s boobs with his strong masculine hands, as Aziza impaled herself on Tom&#39;s girthy penis and rode his muscular body, Aziza had realized something. <br />
<br />
Her gender identity had been on her mind a lot ever since she had settled down in this dimension. She had been thinking about how much her self identity had shifted to thinking of herself primarily as a woman. <br />
<br />
As she laid on this bed getting fucked by a man, Aziza had finally come to terms with her female identity. She was a woman, in body and soul, and she had finally accepted that. <br />
<br />
Maybe it was because sex with a man felt different. <br />
<br />
Before Tom, the only person that she had ever slept with had been Kylie. <br />
<br />
Kylie&#39;s body had pretty much identical to her own. Curvy. Soft. Smooth. Their lips felt like two pillows pressed against each other. They both knew exactly how to pleasure each other since they shared all the same buttons. <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s body on the other hand was rougher. Stronger. Still wonderful, but different. Almost like Aziza was humping a mountain. <br />
<br />
And of course, getting dicked was something she had never experienced before until now.<br />
<br />
It had made Aziza self conscious, in a good way. <br />
<br />
But she didn&#39;t care who the dominant one was. She was currently lost in ecstasy. <br />
<br />
Tom meanwhile, felt safe and secure and happy for the first time in over a decade. <br />
<br />
For the first time since Kylie, he didn&#39;t feel emasculated. <br />
<br />
Aziza had given him his confidence back which Kylie had taken from him.</p>
