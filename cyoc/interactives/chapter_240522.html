<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> It was a few hours after Anka’s change into a Titanoboa animalian that she first encountered her first hurdle with her new Paleocene based body. She could not fit into the elevator based on her size; so she had to slither down the nearby stairs to the ground floor. Meeting back up with Lord Chumlee and the micro raptor animalian she came to know as Doctor Stein, adjusting her top and the skirt she was provided; both garments were tight for her more voluptuous frame, yet they served the purpose for providing a modicum of modesty.<br />
<br />
“I still can’t believe you became so large,” doctor Stein commenting as Anka effortlessly glides towards the group; “I think we need to do some bloodwork to find out why.”<br />
“No offenssssssse doctor,” Anka speaking as she approaches; “but after ssssssurviving Aussssschwitz, my desssssire to be prodded and probed by more doctorsssss is right up their along with getting involved with politicssssss. Both are not happening,” she hisses. “But I do underssstand the need to figure out if thisssssss is an accident from the DNA usssssed, or if thisss is becausssssse of what wassssss done to me by the Nazi doctors.”<br />
“It will take a few days to arrange transport to Dinotopia if you want,” Doctor Stein nodding at Anka’s reservations; “in the meantime, I’m sure Lord Chumlee can play host for the interm.”<br />
“Ahhh,” the dodo animalian smiling; “so long as you join us for afternoon tea doctor. And we can work on your lisp Anka,” Chumlee turning his head to the massive animalian; “we’ll have you speaking like a proper British lady in no time.”<br />
“I’m Polissssssh,” Anka retorting; her tongue flicking out as she continues to stress her esses. “And I can speak fluent German and Russsssssian along with Englisssssh.”<br />
“A mere figure of speech,” Lord Chumlee doing his best to smile along with a bow. “Now shall we briefly show the world the new you?”<br />
<br />
Anka leaving the private hospital in Leeds didn’t bring the fanfare that Chumlee was hyping up; instead she slithered out of the hospital to a few onlookers who were stunned to see a thirty five foot animalian belly crawling on the sidewalk towards a nearby lorry. A moving truck where Chumlee opened to back to allow Anka to enter.<br />
“My apologies,” Chumlee speaking; “but this is the best I could arrange on such short notice. My usual automobile is not large enough to accommodate you.”<br />
“You think the pubssss at Charring Cross would be thrilled to take my patronage,” Anka coiling herself up as best she could in the back; “I could go for a pint.”<br />
“Not today,” Lord chumlee shaking his head; “let’s not cause too much of a scene just yet. There is still time for you to make a proper splash.”<br />
<br />
The ride to Chumlee’s estate wasn’t long, but the roads were a little rough in Anka’s mind; or it was the truck’s suspension that was barely keeping up to the task. Either way, she felt every bump, dip and rough patch until the truck came to a stop.<br />
She hissed as the door truck door opened and she was soon assailed with a mass of flashing lights from cameras going off. Anka soon deduced that those who saw her in Leeds phoned in to the various tip lines for the British Press and a cadre of paparazzi were soon greeting her at the still under construction colony on Lord Chumlee’s estate.<br />
“Newsssss travelsssss fasssst,” Anka hissing as she slithers out. Her movements getting a bit sluggish as her body makes contact with the cold ground dusted with snow.<br />
“Clear off,” Chumlee shouting; “you’ll get your crumbs soon enough you vultures!” Lord Chumlee glaring at the press trying to get their money shot.<br />
“Allow me,” Doctor Stein looking at the crowd and letting loose a menacing screech that soon silenced the crowd.<br />
<br />
The party soon entered the manor and Anka made a beeline to the nearby fire place to warm up.<br />
“I guess that makes sense,” the doctor taking his coat off and putting down the briefcase he had. “You may have become a prehistoric creature, but as it is a reptile…”<br />
“I am by nature cold blooded,” Anka finishing the sentence; “I was once a sssspy for the Soviet Union.” Anka pausing before speaking. “Ssssssso being ssssslippery asssss a sssnake is second nature.” The last Anka was able to utter without the lisp.<br />
“I read your file,” the doctor nodding as he grabbed a chair and sat down; “you were stuck behind the iron curtain as the second world war ended and had to make due with what Stalin provided.”<br />
“It wasn’t much,” Anka adjusting herself so a section of her body didn’t get overheated being by the fire place. “I was very mistrustful of the Red Army, even if the officers were appalled at what they saw at the concentration camp, they were military and I learned to be wary of military uniforms when I was a child.”<br />
“That was then,” Lord Chumlee chiming in as he entered the parlour wheeling a cart with tea and assorted sandwiches and treats. “Let’s look to the future,” the dodo Animalian speaking as he poured three cups; “leave the past firmly where it belongs; in the past.”<br />
“All well and good,” Doctor Stein accepting the cup of tea but politely refusing any cream and sugar; “but if you don’t learn from the past, you are doomed to repeat it.”<br />
Anka nods reluctantly as she accepts the tea. Sipping it she feels a rush of warmth as the hot water passes down her throat.<br />
<br />
******************<br />
<br />
Days later, Anka made a splash in London as she was seen entering a Harrod’s department store. The employees all had shocked looks on their faces as she asked to see a tailor about getting measured for a new wardrobe. It caused such a fuss with the looky-loos that management had to close the store so as not to interrupt. They were fortunately informed in advance by Lord Chumlee of Anka’s arrival, but they were misinformed of her massive size. While some of the employees were genuinely scared of the Titanoboa with a Polish accent, the animalian soon put most of those fears to rest as she answered various questions politely and didn’t flinch when some of the more braver tailors approached to make the measurements for her new body.<br />
“You understand,” one manager speaking; “that this will take some time to arrange. We don’t exactly have clothing in your size.”<br />
“England is also bereft in stores that cater to animalian’s,” Anka answering back. And with a trade war brewing with America, clothing in my size from the colony in Texas is going to be more expensive for me than what it currently is.” Anka feeling a sense of pride as she is getting the hand of speaking with a forked tongue.<br />
“A fair point,” the manager nodding; knowing what the lady is speaking about as he keeps up with the current events going on. “still, you must be excited for the Year of the Snake games,” the manager trying to change the topic to something more uplifting.<br />
“I might make an appearance,” Anka responding as she signs the receipts for her order. “But don’t expect me to compete; I’m way too big to compete and would ruin the fun for everyone else. I’ll mostly be watching from the stands, or if travel is too cumbersome, from the television at Lord Chumlee&#39;s estate.”<br />
<br />
Anka soon shortly left the store only to be harangued by the same paparazzi that have been following her on the chilly January day. She made a fast dash along the sidewalk towards the truck that Lord Chumlee’s driver was operating. Getting into the back she was about to ask the driver to take her to a bookstore on Piccadilly when her phone buzzed. Looking at the device which looked comically small in her scaley hand, she sighed when she saw the message from Doctor Stein.<br />
<br />
‘Preliminary bloodwork is done. It looks like the virus bonded with a dormant gene that made you massive. I am consulting with a fellow scientist as it is a similar regressive gene that made Polly into a massive polar bear animalian. We are doing more research but will be putting a hold on all future Titanaboas conversions in the meantime. Also because you were ninety years old when you converted, we also advise you to seek a therapist for possible symptoms of regressive hyper sexuality. A cargo plane has been arraigned and is on standby to take you from London’s Heathrow airport to Dallas Texas, followed by a ride to Horizon labs in Dinotopia for a more detailed examination if you consent. Please respond at your earliest convince.”<br />
<br />
Anka responded with a polite thank you and accepted the offer to travel to Texas, but only after the year of the snake games have concluded. She wanted to have the time needed to adjust to her new life and wanted to make a more proper entrance with clothing that fits her properly then the brief foray she made today.<br />
“Driver,” Anka rapping on the truck wall separating the cargo cab with the front. “Back to the estate please. The bookstore can wait for another day. It’s too chilly to be out long for me,” Anka feeling the cold more acutely as she does her best to wrap the large blanket provided around herself as the truck did not have heat for the cargo hold she was in.<br />
Anka looked back to her phone and sees a plethora of messages from reporters for an exclusive interview as wells as several agents interested in hiring the newest Animalian as a new spokes-snake for various products. She hissed as one or two were offers to appear in questionable videos, ranging from the low budget monster flick to the dirtiest sleaziest porno, that borders on a snuff film. Anka rolled her eyes as she left those messages unread while looking more into some of the modelling offers. Knowing such jobs can pay very well, Anka was considering such work despite wanting to maintain a quiet life as an accountant.</p>
