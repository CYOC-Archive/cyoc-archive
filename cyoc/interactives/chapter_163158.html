<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Ty&#39;s power entered the world, there was no doubt that the forces of Heaven outmatched those of Hell in any encounter. An uprising would never have been possible. Angels were the sworn protectors of Earth and Heaven, after all, and could repel any invasion, anywhere.<br />
Of course, that&#39;s only until Ty entered the equation. He was able to summon demons, monsters, and dragons to every inch of the globe, and conquer the greatest civilizations in history in mere days, faster than any angel could possibly stop him. What logic suggests that he couldn&#39;t do the same once more, here in Heaven?<br />
So Ty summoned his power once more. It seemed like a million years ago since he&#39;d been a horny teenager playing with this new ability...but now, he was a horny demon, and the playing he had in mind was considerably more devious. With his mind made up, Ty released his power, imposing his will onto the world before him.<br />
The very foundations of Hell shook. The clouds that made up the ground split apart as a monstrous dragon ripped through, dispersing the angels and slashing at them with his claws. The dragon&#39;s wings beat powerfully as he flew high in the air, hovering above the walls of Heaven. Flashes of light struck his hide- attempts by the angels to protect their city, no doubt- but they did nothing. The dragon&#39;s jaws parted, and fire erupted forth, flooding the gate of Heaven with his infernal heat. The beautiful metalwork stood for a few seconds, but soon wavered and melted, tearing apart beneath the dragon&#39;s onslaught. Several angels cried out and retreated into the city in an attempt to escape further carnage, but the deed was done. Heaven, for the first time in all of time, was open.<br />
So Ty kept working. After a few seconds of concentration, black, hellish portals ripped through space. Clawed hands reached through the portals and yanked them wider open, revealing vast legions of demons and monsters. They began to spill forth, quickly assembling into a huge invading force outside Heaven&#39;s walls. Many of the demons, while unclothed, bore huge weapons, from spiked maces to vicious battleaxes to chained whips, and between every pair of legs was a huge cock, at least half-hard in excitement at the thought of penetrating the land of their mortal enemies. The monsters came as well, hellish minotaurs and centaurs, werewolves, anthropomorphic beastmen, hellhounds, and countless others who lacked definite shape, from blank voids to tentacled monstrosities. Several more dragons came, as well, ripping the portals even wider open.<br />
Once he finished surveying and admiring his new army, Ty raised one hand and shouted, loud enough for all to hear, &quot;Charge!&quot;<br />
The mass of demons and monsters swarmed into the city, and all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
Time lost all meaning in the ensuing war. No doubt existed, however, that it far exceeded any battle by human men. The angels of Heaven fought with resolution, determination, and vindication, and none surrendered from the fight. They were quite fierce warriors, as well. Many could fight several demons at once, spinning spears into tornadoes around them to force all to respect their distance. However, they all fell eventually.<br />
Ty himself didn&#39;t fight much at all. He simply trotted through the battlefield, mounted on his stallion with his slave trailing behind him, observing the greatest spectacle in the history of man. He did take particular interest in the battle of Hanael, the angel who&#39;d attempted to protect the gate from the demonic invasion. He fought off a demonic brute, a minotaur, and a hellhound all at once, deflecting attacks or dodging swiftly thanks to the huge wings on his back. He did, of course, fail. He dispatched the demon, knocking him away with the butt of his weapon, but grew overconfident as he attempted to drive the spear into the minotaur&#39;s heart. The spearhead shattered as it hit the beast&#39;s skin. In response, the minotaur swiftly snatched the spear out of the angel&#39;s grasp and snapped the shaft as well, tossing the pieces aside.<br />
Hanael couldn&#39;t react in time as the hellhound leapt onto his back. The weight proved too heavy for his angelic wings, and he plummeted several meters to the earth. The flaming demonic wolf used one huge paw to pin the angel to the ground while he soon shredded Hanael&#39;s robes between his flaming fangs. The hellhound then thrust his hips forward, burying his monstrous canine shaft within the angel&#39;s asshole. Hanael cried out as his virginity was claimed, and his angelic wings turned gray, shrunk, and withered, signifying his failure.<br />
<br />
The rest of the battle went as such. After it was all over, Ty found himself wandering the ruins of the heavenly city. Most of the buildings were razed to the ground or reduced to rubble. The streets were uprooted. The citizens of Heaven- that is, those who lived good, just lives and earned an eternity of happiness- were captured and treated as whores for the armies of Hell, passed around between demons and beasts alike for personal satisfaction.<br />
As Ty watched a particularly ravenous werewolf fucked some old philosopher or something up the ass, his attention was ripped away by a brilliant, shining light. Ty averted his eyes, but barely took note of a huge sphere of pure white light, descending from the sky into the ruins of Heaven. The harsh light faded as it took the form of a man, perhaps in his fifties, with white hair and a trimmed beard, donning white silken robes.<br />
&quot;Accept my surrender, my child.&quot; His voice was indescribable, ancient, powerful. Ty felt a shudder go down his spine as he looked this man in the eyes. &quot;You have had your fun. It is over. Now, allow things to return to how they once were.&quot; There was a warmth in the man&#39;s eyes, as if he didn&#39;t care about the destruction around him. &quot;I will gladly step aside, and allow you to become God. Cleanse Earth and Heaven of destruction. Create a new world. A better one.&quot; God stretched out one hand, as if offering an olive branch.</p>
