<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I listened to the teacher&#39;s lesson while following the natural instincts. Working my hands alongside the bull&#39;s shaft, while looking up to Mr Holstein. The lecture continuing as he shows the textbook to the rest of the class. Several types of anthropomorphic dogs on display. From a husky, to a border collie, to a staffy. From beefy, to rotund, to thin. All sorts of Shoony&#39;s, and all looking overjoyed. Just seeing their wide smile makes me mimic the expression, tongue lolling out of my mouth as I begin to deeply pant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaah, Jeremy, your hands are quite skilled.&quot; My smile grows from the praise. &quot;Thank you, Mr Holstein.&quot; My newly formed paw pads are a cushion for the teacher&#39;s cock. Nice and soft, as they rub against his mottled shaft. The fur overtaking my arms, it is colorless at the moment, but that starts to change as my minotaur lecturer shows me the page again. <br />
<br />
&quot;My star student.&quot; My heart skips a beat, cheeks bright red. Eager to hear what he wants of me. &quot;Yes?&quot; I respond after not even a second. &quot;What breed of Shoony do you like the best?&quot; He moves a beefy finger from illustration to illustration. There are so many options, my eyes darting between each one. The big, the small, the fierce, the cute.  I was overwhelmed, pointing at the one that spoke to my heart. A slightly chubby golden retriever with a curious look.<br />
<br />
It was almost instantly, the colorless fur turning a bright gold. Not that I noticed, my new paws still stroking my teacher&#39;s cock. Lubricated with his pre, the bull&#39;s balls so ready to spill. But he has a lesson to finish. His voice directed back to the rest of the class. &quot;Does anyone have any questions about these creatures? It will be important in the days ahead when the worlds finish merging.&quot; A hand is raised, a brown furred and black spotted gnoll responding to the teacher the moment he has his attention. &quot;What are they good at? Any big strengths? You said they don&#39;t like fighting. But can they fight? Can they do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr Holstein laughs, turning the pages and adjusting his posture. &quot;They certainly can, if needed. But with their short stature and carefree nature, they prefer not to. They instead ally with stronger creatures and become fast friends.&quot; My eyes keep their focus on the lecturer&#39;s head, the bulls natural menacing visage lessened by his refined voice and soft smile. Drifting down to his beefy chest, slate like pecs with textbook abs underneath. He&#39;s so strong, someone that will keep me safe, and someone that I can keep happy. My moment of appreciation causes my hand to slip away from his cock as I can&#39;t help but let out a whine.  I&#39;m meant to be stroking Mr Holstein, but I screwed up. I look to him expecting anger, but instead he scratches the back of my ears again. With each scritch, my ears deflate, stretching and flopping to the sides. Covered in golden fur which spreads to my forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Jeremy. Would you like to sit with me instead?&quot; Sitting with the teacher? Yes! I follow him to his desk. Watching the bull take a seat down as my tail presses out above my ass and starts to wag. His cock at full length, strong hands lifting my short body off the ground as it starts to become pudgy. A bit of fat over the taunt muscle. Hiding away the warriors build, but still having the strength underneath it all. I&#39;m strong if needed, just heavier than before. Chest pressing out as I wiggle my ass atop the teachers cock. Lowered onto it, fitting like a glove as I rest on his lap. My nose feeling wet as I smell my teachers chest, the deodorant doing nothing to hide his natural musk. The scent ingrained in my mind, it&#39;s something I need to remember.<br />
<br />
I look back to the front of the class. All the students as hard as the teacher. A few stroking to the sight of the two of us. Some others offering a hand to their friends. Mr Holstein clearing his throat, and continues the lesson. &quot;More questions, anyone?&quot; An orc raises his hand. Primitive proportions barely fitting in his desk. Huge hand absentmindedly playing with his foreskin as he asks. &quot;What they cock like? Big?&quot; Mr Holstein moves a few pages in, going over the biology of the creature. &quot;They match their race, dog like.&quot;<br />
<br />
My cock starts to rescind into my groin. I barely notice it. Too happy being filled by my teacher, cuddled by his strong chest, and taking in his masculine smell. But my attention is brought to it as Mr Holstein moves a hand over, rubbing the smooth skin, coaxing out a red and flared dick. Far larger than before, knot forming and being gently squeezed by the minotaur. My teacher wrapping both hands around my chest, standing up, my ass tightening to keep as much of his cock in as possible. Showing me and my dick off as an example to the class, and causing many of the students to hasten their strokes.<br />
<br />
With a thud, Mr Holstein sits back down, and my body slams against his. I can&#39;t suppress a joyous moan, which is music to the teachers ears. Hips thrusting up and down as the lesson continues. &quot;We have time for one more question, anyone else?&quot; My hand raises, I have a question, but it goes down as quickly as it went up. The fur taking over the rest of my face, bright gold with spots of white. Becoming more wild and frizzled as it goes down my neck and greets my chest. Muzzle stretching forward. New fat jiggling with the teachers slams, my lecturer giving me a curious look. &quot;Jeremy, my star student, you can ask any question you like.&quot; He said it again. My smile returning, dick dripping pre and ready to shoot. Legs bending forward, turning to a digitigrade stance. &quot;It&#39;s... it&#39;s off topic.&quot; I say, but he is quick to shut down my protest. &quot;I do not mind, Jeremy. Any question is fine.&quot; <br />
<br />
My breathing quickens, ropes of cum shooting from my dick to the teacher&#39;s desk as I speak between moans. &quot;W-why does your cock <br />
 feeeeeaaaaaaaah.... aaah... feel...... sooo goooooood.&quot; My dumb question is rewarded by being filled with the minotaur&#39;s warm load. Cock pulsating, my ass tensing. Holding in as much of it as I can, his breath hot against my neck. Mouth pressed up against my ear, nuzzling fur against fur, whispering to me. &quot;Because you&#39;re my cute little Shoony.&quot;<br />
<br />
The bell rang, the students pilling out. Leaving me on the teachers lap, as I remember my mission. Crap, I still needed to get on with the day and save Sam and the other Jocks. Mr Holstein lifted me off his cock, his cum leaking out of my ass. &quot;Thanks sir- w-wow.&quot; It finally hit me. My new furred hand, my wagging tail, my short and chubby build. I wasn&#39;t a human anymore. &quot;What did you do!&quot; I was outraged, this was my trusted teacher, but just like everyone else here he worked to turn me into a monster. Was I doomed to be like the other students now? Lose my mind and become something else? <br />
<br />
My Holstein gave me a sympathetic look, putting a hand on my shoulder. We were almost friends, he helped me so much, I wanted to know why he did this. Was he really just another enemy? &quot;Jeremy, there are no humans left. I did not want you to feel alone when everyone else was having fun and embracing their new life.&quot; It was out of compassion? No but, I didn&#39;t ask for this. &quot;B-but I need to be human! How can I save the others?&quot; My teacher pulls me into a hug, comforting me as I feel a sudden sensation of failure and guilt. &quot;Shhh, everyone is happy as a monster. Why don&#39;t you skip the next class and stay with me? I&#39;m sure I can prove this to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
My muzzle quivered; voice low as I responded with...</p>
