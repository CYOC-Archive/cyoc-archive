<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the rest of the class stood up and continued to their next class, Jennifer was still riding the high of having changed the very face of humanity.  All the boys now sported horns of varying lengths, with some being mere nubs while others were already competing with Mr. Wang&#39;s long horns.  They awkwardly navigated between each other, needing to be aware that walking too close to a classmate might catch their horns with each other.  Some even needed to turn their head to get through the doorway.  It was interesting to see the amount of variety, too.  Some had carvings in their horns, while others seemed to have cut them short or ground them down, allowing them to more easily navigate the crowded hallway.  <br />
<br />
Then there were the girls.  Every single one in her classroom had tits ranging from large to massive after Mr. Wang&#39;s lecture on puberty, but even a couple in the hallways had wet spots.  Interestingly, it seemed her alteration of puberty had caused bras to be altered with this in mind, so most of the women didn&#39;t wet their shirts.  This obviously wasn&#39;t true for her class because the growth had snapped them off, and her best guess for the ones outside is that some bras may offer less soak potential, or maybe milk production started randomly.<br />
<br />
She could alter reality itself by just being asked a question.  She had to do it again!<br />
<br />
Looking around, she noticed one other student was taking their time getting out of class: Amanda.  While the goat-girl&#39;s breasts had undergone just as much growth as the rest of the class, her udder apparently scaled up much faster with each round of growth.  Even more unfortunate for her was the milk production, as an udder was able to contain much more milk than human breasts could.  It resulted in a grossly bloated mass that consumed all space between Amanda&#39;s legs down to her knees.  It was apparently heavy enough to force Amanda to slow down.<br />
<br />
A perfect target.<br />
<br />
Jennifer quickly approached Amanda, then stood awkwardly close.  &quot;Amanda...&quot;<br />
<br />
The half-goat looked up with an inquisitive look, but Jennifer simply smiled at her rival.  After a few pregnant seconds, Amanda responded in a slightly agitated manner.  &quot;What do you waaant, Ballsy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just the response she was looking for, but she had to make this question count.  &quot;Before class, you asked me to help you onto your hooves and carry some of your books to the next class that we share.  I said I wanted to rant about some stuff and you said you&#39;d listen, since you consider me such a good friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda&#39;s demeanor toward Jennifer shifted noticeably as her goat hooves now rested on the floor.  She slumped back into her seat and held out an arm, which Jennifer was compelled to grab and lift.  Once Amanda was standing, Jennifer&#39;s body robotically picked up her new friend&#39;s bookbag in addition to her own.  The temporary loss of agency was slightly unnerving, but it seemed she was back in control.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, how could I haaave forgotten?&quot;  Amanda gave her tormentor a genuine smile as they walked out together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You probably got distracted in class by your boobs growing.  You&#39;ve got two rows of them, after all.&quot;  Jen stifled a snicker as Amanda became a four-breasted mutant in response to her statement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe.&quot;  They got into the hallway, and started their way to the next class.  &quot;So, what was it you wanted to raaant about?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A couple people, actually.  But first, that coward Kyle Perkins.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amanda seemed taken aback.  &quot;Thaaat kid with the monkey tail?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Jennifer tried to respond in affirmative, but the words were caught in her throat.  That was the truth now, which means she couldn&#39;t say yes.  &quot;No, Kyle Perkins is the kid with...&quot;  Her mind went over what might be most punishing.  &quot;He&#39;s that half-snake kid, about 3 feet tall and 12 feet long, covered in hot pink scales and speaks with a lisp.&quot;  Let&#39;s see him deal with that body.  &quot;He harassed me this morning, bragging that his breasts were bigger than mine.  While those cow udders on his chest are technically tits, it still pissed me off.&quot;  New memories entered Jennifer&#39;s mind about this conversation Kyle had with her, and she actually felt a distant anger about it even though it never happened.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Amanda seemed to be hesitant about piling on Kyle.  &quot;I know thaaat&#39;s stupid of Kyle, but take it easy on him.&quot;  She lifted her oversized udder.  &quot;While I haaaven&#39;t talked with him much, he&#39;s like the only other person here that&#39;s kind of like me.  Dealing with udders is a mess, and I can&#39;t imagine dealing with four times as many teats as I haaave, every day.  Must suck to be him.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was taken aback.  Amanda had always been a bitch, even to her own friends.  Did the physical changes modify Amanda&#39;s behavior?  &quot;Fair enough.  That brings me to the second person: you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
Perfect.  &quot;There&#39;s just so little that I really know about you, Amanda.  Your udder is so big that you practically have to drag it around and you have to milk it at least 3 times a day, but how did it happen?  How do you milk it with your hoof-hands?  Why did you dye your fur black?  Why don&#39;t you ever wear clothes?  Does it have to do with your tail?  Does any of this have something to do with you being the football team&#39;s mascot?&quot;<br />
<br />
As expected, the changes happened in real time as each statement was made.  Amanda&#39;s udder blimped outward, forcing the goat-girl to walk bowlegged and hunched.  Every few steps required her to rest her udder on the floor for a few moments before heaving it back up to continue forward.  Her hands turned into something between that of human and goat, short digits ending in grotesque, thick nails that looked closer to hooves.  Then, fur covered her body while her clothes melted away.  Jen momentarily lagged slightly behind to verify the tail had grown in, which it had.  While there was no visible reaction to the mascot comment, Jen would have to wait until later to see those consequences.<br />
<br />
The funniest part about all of this was how little Amanda reacted to the situation.  &quot;I waaas born like this, but yes, my udder really grew in when I hit 14.  I don&#39;t milk myself, and my parents can&#39;t get the stupid school to install a milk machine for me.  The dye was a personal choice and has nothing to do with my tail.  Did you think I caaan wear clothes with a body like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing as she was wearing clothes just moments earlier, Jen knew the real answer.  &quot;No, I guess not.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a pregnant silence as the two continued down the school&#39;s halls.  Just a few steps from the class, Amanda spoke up.  &quot;Hey, waaait.&quot;  Jen turned her focus to her &#39;friend.&#39;  &quot;Do you how it feels to carry around an udder like this, knowing you&#39;ll haaave it for the rest of your life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen went pale.  She had to answer the question, but she wanted the current truth to be her answer: no.  She didn&#39;t have much time before the curse forced her to answer, but she had to think of a way to mitigate the full implications of this question.</p>
