<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Axel started to looks at you, then he looks over your body from top to bottom and he smiles at you. &quot;You know Megan, why exactly are you here? The only reason two animals of the same species that are in the opposite gender like us, is to be put together like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel stated as the then walks up to you, eyeing your breasts before they shrank away. You noticed this from what he was doing that you then slapped his face for it. Your slap didn’t do much though for it only made him blush and grin at you that this made you angry a bit as you growled at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! My girls don’t like being touchy with others!&quot; you said, covering your girl parts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you&#39;ve got some fire in you too. Are you in a breeding program? if not, then Why else would you be in here with me?&quot; Axel asked that you quickly blushed a bit as you then looked away from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it matter to you?! I just got here like last night, already I&#39;ve had someone so drunk while trying to grope me that I’m now being hit on by some guy who I don’t even know!!&quot; you snarled back at him.<br />
<br />
Axel paused for a moment as he then smiled at you for this. &quot;Some guys who happen to work around here, knows just how the system works. In other words, I’m basically a guard here as I have to keep myself fit, clean, and prepared for anything that comes my way while on the job. so you see Megan, protocol is what I know around here as I follow them.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused as you then blush away from him at this. at this point though, your male human was now lingering in a distant thought of your head that you were somehow stuck with him. you weren&#39;t sure how, but this new version of you thought about Axel&#39;s role as a security guard here that you then glanced at his body to see it physically fit and muscular, even if he now looks like a feral racoon.<br />
<br />
your body was no different when You looked down at your body as you then took a few steps away from Axel. you turned back towards him and sighed. &quot;Look, I&#39;m not some breeding bitch here, like some kind of goddamn whore, or whatever you want to call me that i&#39;m certainly not even a slut!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Axel realized he saw the pissed off look in your eyes as you glared while snarling at him, yet he only smiled. sighing after words, he then looks up at you with a nod when he later sat down on the ground. &quot;i wasn&#39;t trying to offend you in anyway I know of like so, but you do one hell of a job as a bartender with such a gorgeous body that you also got a sweet sensitive personality which comes with a feisty side. Honestly though, I do like those things in a girl that it also gives me a little bit of thrill such as yourself. So, how about we start this off from the beginning? the name&#39;s Axel, got it memorized? as you can see here that i&#39;m a raccoon, but i wasn&#39;t always like this. I was once a man as I was offered a job here to this very zoo that I guard it to this day, but in the form of a raccoon while becoming this on my stay here during the day. I&#39;m 21 years old that i&#39;m not just yet into my prime. yet in all of my years while living here, I kind of find you to be the most interesting girl in this zoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked away from him with a blush feeling at how calm he was about this then you, realizing that he must have dealt with people like you before during his guard duty. wait, did he just mention that he was once human? looking back at him, You then sighed as this could be your lucky break that you been looking for while begrudgingly telling him your end of the introductions.<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Megan that I too was one a man as I&#39;m 20 years old. I grew up near by here as it takes a couple of miles to get here. the reason why i&#39;m here is because I basically received two free passes to the zoo in the mail that were from 7pm till dawn, hid in a gift shop to stay a bit more when I moved to hide in the jungle bar that started to serve serves to my costermers and later became a raccoon bartender and waitress, and a dame good one too. if I didn&#39;t dealt with pawsy and assholes like them my whole life, I say I&#39;ve would of liked it here to begin with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m not very surprised though to say the least, but I am a bit for you being sneaky enough to slip in and become a dang looking girl you are now. still, I guess that&#39;s where you get the attitude of yours from.&quot; Axel said that he then laughed at this, but this made you growl as you then lunged at him while knocking him down onto his back with you over top of him for you were holding him down by his shoulders.<br />
<br />
It was then Axel was blinking at you when he then blushed as he paused and looked down to see his cock standing fully erect at an astonishing few inches. You looked down at him while blushing as well when you looked to the side and noticed a group of humans all watching you do this, but you didn’t really seem to mind them seeing you act like this at first. Axel then glanced down at your tiny tits that you looked down at him and blushed as you admittedly felt horny right now too as you felt your body was about to go into heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;W...well, we’re in an....interesting predicament now. aren’t we, heh?&quot; he asked that you then leaned down towards him and whispered something into his soft furry ear of his.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re really annoying right now, but you’re turning me on. So, where do you want to meet at? we wouldn’t want to scar any of the human children now, would we?&quot; you said while smiling down at him that you then kissed him on the cheek as the two of your tail swayed side to side, playfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a den in the back that we can be alone in, just behind those doors there. As long as you aren’t shy about your girls, then I’m up for anything you got in mind you beautiful beast. maybe after words, we can talk more about each other. I want to learn more about you and where you&#39;re from, even if you were once a man.&quot; he said with a grin towards you now that you nodded at him while grinning naughtily as you chirped seductively at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;then You and me, in that den, five minutes, got it?&quot; you asked that Axel nodded to this as you then quickly got up off of him and smiled to the humans, before you walked off into the den. Once you were inside and out of sight of both Axel the humans that you then took two of your fingers and plunged them deep into your pussy as you moaned out quite a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh god... what&#39;s happening to me? I haven’t been this horny in awhile. must be because I haven’t seen a real man willing to toy with my emotions like this, let alone being in a female raccoon body that he thinks i&#39;m actually attractive. Dear god, I hate him! But also...I love the way he pisses me off. what am I suppose to do now? my human man mind is stuck in this... cute female raccoon body that i&#39;m starting to think like one. still, i&#39;m going to turn back into my anthropomorphic state by night fall that i&#39;ll be nude. why... why did I tell him to wait five minute for me?&quot; You thought to yourself, chattering as you grabbed onto one of your tit nipples as you toyed with it by pinching it that You growled with bliss for you then looked down and saw a wet streak running down the side of your leg and you chirped happily about it.</p>
