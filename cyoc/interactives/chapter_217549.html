<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Arriving at the school, Steven kissed his daughter on her head between the two horns on her head that were pointing behind her. She then hopped out, unclipping her backpack straps to pull them over her from behind. She then re-clipped them after setting the backpack comfortably between her wings. She waved goodbye as her father drove off before she started looking around to see if she recognized anyone. Before too long, she sees Johnathan sitting on a bench near one of the building entrances. She makes her way over to him, walking by groups of students talking to each other. <br />
<br />
Most people in the town had heard of the dragon girl that lived there, meaning that most people weren’t surprised at the sight of her. Most of the time, if anyone was surprised to see the dragon girl, it was because they were from out of town or little kids that didn’t know better. <br />
As walks up to Johnathan, Tyler opens up her wings to block out the sun and cast a shadow on him. She loved to do this, just to see if he noticed. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Tyler.” Johnathan says without looking up from his phone. <br />
<br />
Tyler giggled as she folds up her wings again and takes a seat near Johnathan on the bench. “I see that you are getting to use to that. You were able to guess even after being gone all summer.” Tyler then smelt the scent of beer in the air. “I also see that your parents are already day drinking again.” She adds with a pout. <br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Johnathan replied. “Mom was passed out when dad drove me here. He himself was probably one beer off.” <br />
<br />
“Well, did you at least have a good time with your aunt up state?” Tyler asks, already knowing the answer. <br />
<br />
“Oh, yeah. A great time. I only spent it either texting with you or playing on the VR set she got me.” Johnathan then takes a deep breath. “Sorry, I just can’t believe that my parents couldn’t make it one summer without going on probation again. They were told that if they were caught with alcohol or under the influence one more time, it would be mandatory jail.” <br />
<br />
“Well, you know that dad would take you in again if that happens.” Tyler replies, taking Johnathan’s hand into her own. <br />
<br />
“I know.” Johnathan replies, shaking his head. “But you know how I feel about that. The last time….” <br />
<br />
“I know,” Tyler cuts off, trying to sound less depressing then Johnathan. “You found out that I sleep nearly nude because of my wings. That the property is much quieter than an apartment complex downtown. Oh, and that my dad has more guns than the sheriff department…” Tyler counts off each subject with her fingers. She then turns her gaze to Johnathan before smiling. <br />
<br />
Johnathan smiles back, “Okay, so it wasn’t that bad. But still, I feel like I am taking away from y’all.” <br />
<br />
“Hey, you are the only person that has ever slept over. So I call that a good thing. Besides, you know my dad loves having you over. Who else is he going to go nerdy over games with. Not me. I barely able to keep from crushing the controllers.” Tyler then pulls out her phone from her pocket. “With that said, I will let him know really quick that you may be coming over after school.”  <br />
<br />
“Oh right, and have my parents call the cops saying that I ran away again.” Johnathan jokes as Tyler sends the text. “They are the ones that sent me to stay with my aunt for the summer and not even an hour after putting me on the bus, they filed a report saying that I ran away. My aunt didn’t know I was even on a bus until your dad called her to give her the warning that the police maybe calling. She was halfway here to pick me up herself. I lucked out that the store she owns was only down the street from her house.” <br />
<br />
The school bell rings and both Tyler and Johnathan get up from the bench and make their way to their first class, Math. Along the way, they continued to talk. “Well, dad can call the sheriff and let her know before hand if a report is filed.” Tyler then clams up before asking, “Um, do you want some of my spray deodorant for the beer smell? It smells like you slept in a keg.” <br />
<br />
“I went straight to the office when dad drop me off. The principal already wrote me a note.” Johnathan pulls the note out of his back pocket. “Apparently, he went to school with my parents back in the day, and they were drunks back then too.” The two then walk in their first class. “Looks like they were asses back then too.”<br />
<br />
The teacher stops Tyler and Johnathan. “I heard some of that conversation from the hallway, so I will let that slide. But please reframe from cursing in my class.” <br />
<br />
“Sorry ma’am.” Johnathan replies as he hands over the note. “I was told to give this to my teachers when I showed up to class.” <br />
<br />
“Let me see.” The teacher replies as she reads the note. After reading, she returned the note. “Sorry to hear that, Mr. Johnathan. If you ever want to talk, let me know.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks ma’am.” Johnathan replies. <br />
<br />
“You can call me Mrs. Benjie.” Mrs. Benjie then looks over at Tyler. “And you must be Ms. Tyler. Your table and chair are in the back row right now. If you want to move it forward, just let me know.” <br />
<br />
“I will be fine if you don’t mind Johnathan sitting next to me. My wings like to block other’s view.” Tyler replies to the teacher. <br />
<br />
“No problem, as long as you two don’t abuse it. Just as a FYI, if you do have trouble seeing the board, just have your parent or guardian email me at the address on the syllabus. If needed, the school would supply the class with tablets to use. Brand new tablets, that sync with the board.” Mrs. Benjie was not too subtle with her statement. She wanted the new equipment. <br />
<br />
“Understood.” Tyler replies before she and Johnathan make their way to the open desks. As they sit down, Tyler leans over to Johnathan. “We can talk more about this later.” <br />
<br />
“Deal.” Johnathan replies. <br />
<br />
The school day went by surprisingly quickly. Tyler’s math class was easy, with Mrs. Benjie opting to do a meet and great for the whole time. During her second class, Tyler had history as Johnathan went off to Shop. Ironically, Johnathan had the same history teacher, just not on the same day. He had also wanted art with Tyler, but his parents signed him up for the shop class saying that he needed to get a job over the summer to support them. They both met back up during lunch, where they ran into some of their other friends from middle school. <br />
After lunch, the two of them went to their JROTC class. They were issued uniforms for the year, with Tyler complaining that the blue Air Force uniforms did not match her pink scales. They then split up again, Tyler heading over to her art class and Johnathan to History. At the end of the day, they met back up to wait with each other to see who would be picked up first. It was not uncommon in middle school for Steven to drive Johnathan home, as his parents were already too drunk. <br />
<br />
This time, as they were waiting, Steven texted Tyler to meet him in the parking lot where he dropped her off at that morning. He told her to bring Johnathan along too. As they make it to the truck, Johnathan takes Tyler’s backpack in the back seat with him as she gets up front. As the doors closed, Steven turned to Johnathan. <br />
<br />
“I am sorry to be the one to give you this news, son. Your parents are in jail again.” Steven says sullenly. <br />
<br />
“What happen?” Johnathan asks as Tyler covered her muzzle with her hands in shock. <br />
<br />
“Well, from what the sheriff had said, your father passed out when parking the car. He crashed through the lower-level apartment that you all live in. I am afraid that he took out most of your stuff with the car.” Steven replies. <br />
<br />
Johnathan looks down at his bag as Tyler reaches around to try to take his hand. Seeing her hand, Johnathan grabs ahold of it. “Do I have anything left?” <br />
<br />
“A little, and it was dropped off at the house already. Your VR set is intact. So is the laptop that your aunt got you a few years back. Other then that, not even your clothes made it out. Now, your mother slept through it all, which is why she went to jail. She was so wasted; she didn’t even know a car hit the apartment. The sheriff also said that they found enough beer to run a small bar.” Steven looks up to see a school official waving for him to leave the parking lot. He pulls out of the parking spot and onto the road before continuing. <br />
<br />
“Now, it looks like your school stuff survived too.” Steven continued, “But we will need to see if the clothes that fit you before the summer that were left at our house still fit. If they do, then I will pick you up some plan clothes tomorrow until we can make a true shopping trip in the city this weekend.” <br />
<br />
“They should.” Johnathan replies, “They are bigger than the clothes I have on now. That’s why I left them.” <br />
<br />
“That was what I thought.” Steven replies. “Now, I had taken out the bed from my office. So for tonight, you would have to sleep on a cot in either the office or in with Tyler. You already know how our house is at night, so I think you would be fine for tonight. Just make sure the two of you don’t get any ideas.” Steven had hoped the joke would make Johnathan feel a little better, but all it actually did was make Tyler give her father a angry stare. “Look, we will work through this. The sheriff has already talked with Child Protective Services, and you will be living with us until your parents get a court date. After that, It will be up to the judge were you go.” <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Johnathan replies. <br />
<br />
“None needed. You are in a bad place. I am just happy to be able to help you with what we can.” Steven looks over to the side of the road, seeing a pizza place. “Let’s get pizza for tonight and we can talk more about this tomorrow after school.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I have some homework already.” Tyler replies. “Mr. Calhoun said we needed to turn in a three-page paper to him over chapter one of our history books by ten tonight.” <br />
<br />
“Crap, he can’t give y’all the first day to get accustomed to high school.” Steven replies. <br />
<br />
“He says that you don’t get time to adjust in the ‘real world’.” Johnathan replies, “I have the same homework.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, he is one of those teachers. Dude probably never spent a day in the real world in his career. I would bet it was straight to college and then teaching the same grade for a hundred years.” Steven replies. <br />
<br />
“Not far off.” Tyler replies. <br />
<br />
After picking up pizza and returning to the property, Tyler and Johnathan make their way to Tyler’s bedroom to do their homework and get change for the night. Johnathan sets up the cot near Tyler’s bed before plugging in his laptop to make sure it worked. At the same time, Tyler takes off her clothes, tossing them in her dirty clothes basket before starting a shower. She calls out to Johnathan, asking him to read the chapter to her while she showers. <br />
<br />
“Do you have to shower at night?” Johnathan asks. <br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Tyler replies, popping her head out of the hallway shower,  showing off her perky breasts. “Dad showers in the mornings and if his legs or back are giving him trouble, then he can take a while to shower. If you want to risk being late because of that, that is up to you.” <br />
Johnathan blushes as he sees Tyler’s free breast. Steven, who happens to be walking by, hears the conversation. Seeing the blushing Johnathan, he calls to his daughter from the hallway. “Don’t mess with him, just shower.” <br />
<br />
“Well, he can at least sit on the toilet and read. It is not like he would be seeing anything while he does.” Tyler snarks back to her father. <br />
“Lord, where did I go wrong.” Steven replies as he waves Johnathan into the hallway bathroom.<br />
<br />
“I heard that!” Tyler replies before starting the water. <br />
<br />
Tyler steps in just as Johnathan walks into the bathroom. He does as he was told by the dragoness and takes a seat on the toilet before opening his history book. He starts to read the chapter, stopping to answer questions from Tyler while she bathes. Surprisingly, the chapter is mostly opinion, and not much actually history. Johnathan closes the book and stands up, preparing to walk out. This is when Tyler turns off the water and grabs her towel off the wall. She wipes herself and opens the shower curtain, her body visible for Johnathan to see.  <br />
<br />
Johnathan blushes once again, but he also starts to feel his pants tighten from the boner he was growing. Tyler sees the boner and walks over to Johnathan. “Like what you see?” <br />
<br />
Johnathan turns his head away. “You know I don’t need to answer that.” <br />
<br />
Tyler giggles as the two of them return to her room, closing the door behind them. She continues to wipe the excess water off of herself as Johnathan takes a set on his cot, brings up a word document to start his paper. <br />
<br />
Tyler then puts on her panties and her PJ bottoms before sitting at her desk. The two type away, asking each other questions on their papers until they both were finished. As they look at the clock, they see that it was already 9:30 at night. The homework took up their entire afternoon. <br />
<br />
“Well, what do you want to do now. It is almost to early for bed, but to late to start a game?” Tyler says as she takes a seat on the edge of her bed facing Johnathan. <br />
<br />
Johnathan shakes his head, “And that is why you always wake up late. We should get to bed.” <br />
<br />
Tyler moans in disagreement, “Your no fun.” <br />
<br />
“Sorry, not all of us can be half nude dragons.” Johnathan retorts. <br />
<br />
Tyler grabs her beasts. “You do like these.” <br />
<br />
Johnathan eyes go wide. “That is not what I said, and you know it. Are you trying to get me in trouble with your dad?” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I would be the one in trouble.” Tyler replies. “But come one. Let&#39;s say you would not get into trouble; wouldn’t you want to touch them?” <br />
<br />
Johnathan looks away, “Well, yes, but…” <br />
<br />
Tyler leans forward, taking Johnathan’s hand into her claws. “Then come here. Here is a freebee.” She says as she forces his hand to cup her right breast. <br />
<br />
Johnathan’s breath skips as his palm covers Tyler’s nipple. He didn’t expect it to be so soft, not with all the dragon scales. He recalls seeing her step onto a wood nail, and the nail being hurt more then her. He lets his fingers rest onto the boob, caressing it. Tyler smiles, “Does this help?” <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Johnathan replies as he takes his other hand on his own accord and starts to message the free breast. <br />
<br />
The rubbing felt so good to Tyler, her tail tip gently plopping up and down off the bed. She reached out with her arms and pulled Johnathan in closer to her. Johnathan gets onto his knees, bringing his head to the same height as the breasts. Tyler starts rubbing her claws gently though Johnathan’s short, black hair. She looks down, seeing the raging boner of Johnathan’s start to peek over his belt loop. She closes her eyes and takes in a deep breath, smelling his sex from high up. <br />
<br />
But then something caused her to open her eyes abruptly. Looking down, she sees that Johnathan took of one of his hands from her breast. In its place was his lips, kissing and sucking on her soft nipple. To his surprise, he is able to draw some milk from the nipple. As the sweet flavor hits his tongue and throat, he pulls back and looks off to the side. <br />
<br />
“Sorry.” He states, before standing up to grab a sheet from Tyler’s closet. <br />
<br />
Tyler stands up and walks behind Johnathan, wrapping her hands around him. “Don’t be. I started it, it was on me. Just don’t feel bad, alright.” <br />
<br />
“Deal.” Johnathan replies back.</p>
