<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ken grinned, watching his perfect girlfriend play with the puppy.<br />
<br />
It had been a week since he last used the Chronivac. During that team, he’d made lead quarterback and had gotten to the top of all his classes. Not out of actual study or knowledge, but because he had the Chronivac and had turned a stray cat into his clone, one that had no knowledge of him and who turned back into a cat after school was out.<br />
<br />
That was fun, but he still didn’t have a car. <br />
<br />
Now that Ricky was out of the way, he didn’t really have any enemies. Everyone at school respected him, now, and since he didn’t even go to school anymore except to play football at night, he didn’t have to deal with bullies. So the question was, who was in his way and needed to become a vehicle?<br />
<br />
And the answer was: No one. Yet.<br />
<br />
He had a program loaded up for when that changed. It was sitting in the Chronivac, waiting to be executed on the future victim. Ken hadn’t liked the haphazard transformation when he turned Ricky into a puppy. He’d had to adjust it a bit, like, three times already as new issues cropped up.<br />
<br />
The vehicle TF was built off of that trial and error. They say wisdom comes from experience. Ken had found that experience is often a result of lack of wisdom. Playing with reality had taught him quite a few lessons. But it also made him want to test things out some more, see what would happen.<br />
<br />
For example: What would happen if his girlfriend became his boyfriend?<br />
<br />
How would people react to the quarterback being openly gay? And what was gay sex like? Ken had never bottomed before, but being dominated by, say, the star heavy weight wrestler (muscles, not fat, he wasn’t ready for that!) might be fun. <br />
<br />
These weren’t just idle thoughts anymore. He could make them reality, truly experience a new life. Sure, he’d be giving up this perfect life, but only temporarily. He could save profiles and TFs to the Chronivac and activate them whenever he wanted.<br />
<br />
Ken could experience any fetish, any life. Be old, young, fat, thin, muscular, geeky, dumb, be a dog or a tiger or an anthro or a dildo or a jockstrap. He was, essentially, a god. And as long as he was careful, he could be anything he wanted for as long as he wanted.<br />
<br />
There were limits. After careful research, he’d managed to find them. He couldn’t REALLY alter the world, like making girls not poop anymore. Which was too bad, because that might have been interesting.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac COULD shunt him into a simulated timeline where girls excrete solely from their vaginas, but it wouldn’t be real. That would always bother him. Or, like, a world where everyone was dinosaurs, but it would still be a simulated world.<br />
<br />
Most importantly, the Chronivac would ALWAYS alter reality in a way that protected its own existence. Not necessarily his personal copy of the Chronivac, but Transdem Industries itself. Their employees were also spared from any shifts in reality and transformations as well. <br />
<br />
That had been in the disclaimer that he hadn’t bothered to read when he first used it.<br />
<br />
They would save him if he screwed up, but they weren’t necessarily obligated to do so. His usage of their intellectual property was at their whim. If they decided he wasn’t someone worth saving…no more Ken.<br />
<br />
The only time they’d intervene was in cases of death or existential erasure. And not of other people, just the contracted user. Currently, that user was Jess. He’d noticed warnings popping up about that. Eventually, they’d change him back into a male.<br />
<br />
So, he needed to beat them to the punch. And, do it in such a way that made it so Jess wanted to do it. Jeff wasn’t gay, though, so he needed to be cautious or the technicians at Transdem would fix that too. The question was, how?<br />
<br />
He’d already sent a message asking for user access and his own test version of the Chronivac, but they said the testing devices were already sent. In other words, all the testers had already been chosen. The guy he had talked to was annoyed because some dude in California kept turning himself into a fly and getting himself and his lover killed in various horrific ways, usually by being squashed.<br />
<br />
Ken had turned up the charm, asking them to turn the guy back and maybe send the Chronivac to him instead.<br />
<br />
It was being considered. <br />
<br />
Ken sighed, checking his e-mail to see if they’d accepted him yet. <br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
Oops, there was another warning e-mail:<br />
<br />
‘Attention, User altered to not use Chronivac. Assigned User must be allowed to test Chronivac or risk violating user code 222.1.3. This is the third e-mail. If User access is not restored in 24 hours, all changes will be reset. Thank you,<br />
<br />
Transdem Industries’<br />
<br />
He scratched his light beard hairs. It was itchy. A new feeling, being able to grow a beard instead of just a few hairs on the tip of his chin.  Ken knew he was just putting off changing Jess back. But she really was perfect. He truly loved her this way.<br />
<br />
Damn Transdem!<br />
<br />
Wait, what if he setup a TF package and simply have Jess press the button? Technically, it was a change she chose. More over, Ken wouldn’t have to worry about her screwing up the transformation. Or, he guessed, using it on him.<br />
<br />
He started typing, crafting the perfect boyfriend package.<br />
<br />
When he finished, he looked it over and double-checked it for errors. None found. He sighed, realizing that once this began, he might actually have to go to school. Ken didn’t mind becoming the center of attention, but he wasn’t sure how well this change in particular would be received.<br />
<br />
Of course, you’d expect a level of politeness since he was incredibly fit and muscular, but you never know. He certainly didn’t want to get jumped for being gay. The possibility that he might not survive it crossed his mind.<br />
<br />
…Maybe a few more fail-safes, just to be sure.</p>
