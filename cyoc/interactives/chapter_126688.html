<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{It&#39;s tough having a retail industry related job in this over hyped and over commercialized holiday season. I will hopefully be back to ALL the Moon Lake stories full time around the first of the year at the latest.—tmw.}<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Impassioned lovers, wrestle as one.&quot;</i>—from &#9835;The Late Lament&#9835; by The Moody Blues.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if I wasn&#39;t pregnant before, I certainly am now,&quot; said Melissa Stovall with a smile as she cuddled close to her husband in their king sized bed.<br />
&quot;Well ma&#39;am. I did my best,&quot; quipped Martin Stovall, before he started gently kissing his way from her rosy lips down her neck.<br />
<br />
FOR THOSE WHO CAME IN LATE...<br />
Attending the annual Halloween party at the high school*, the Mayor of Moon Lake accidentally got a glass of the spiked punch tainted with <i>Love Potion #9</i>, a powerful aphrodisiac that affected weres far worse than normal humans.<br />
So driven by lust and desire for his wife, the were-merman drove his were-mermaid home and started having wild, passionate sex in their fresh water swimming pool, without giving Melissa a chance to take another were-mermaid birth control pill.<br />
Fearing but uncertain at the time that she might be pregnant, when the couple finally had a chance to talk about the situation, they decided they did want another child after all this time, and the were-mers went about making sure there would be a blessed event within the next 9 months.<br />
<br />
JUST A FEW MINUTES&#39; WALK AWAY OVER ON WOOD STREET...<br />
&quot;Yes! <i>Yes!</i> <b>YES!</b>&quot; screamed Julie Stovall, as she felt her fiance and fellow were-mer Eric Anderson drive his hard penis deeper into her hungry vagina until they both experienced orgasmic bliss together.<br />
&quot;Oh, my darling,&quot; cooed Julie, as Eric laid on top of her, spent for the moment.<br />
A smile crossed both of their faces as they kissed again, laying next to each other in Eric&#39;s full size bed within his bedroom at the Anderson&#39;s house.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, my love,&quot; began Melissa, as Martin began orally enjoying her bountiful bosom again. &quot;What are you hoping for?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hmmm....&quot; said Martin, looking up at his wife.<br />
Melissa couldn&#39;t help but chuckle a little as she saw him staring at her with a hard nipple between his lips.<br />
&quot;I asked what are you hoping for. A boy or a girl?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Martin, kissing the spot on her chest where he figured her heart was before laying his head gently between Melissa&#39;s breasts. &quot;We already have a wonderful daughter, so a son would be nice. But what I <b>really</b> want is a healthy wife bringing a healthy baby were-mer into the world so we can watch and raise the new addition to our family together,&quot; he said, before raising his head to kiss her again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know how much I love you?&quot; Eric asked Julie, while staring deeply into her blue eyes.<br />
&quot;At least as much as I love you,&quot; she replied, before initiating another kiss.<br />
Then she stopped and smiled. &quot;Do you realize that by the time we become Sophomores next fall, I&#39;ll be a big sister and you&#39;ll be the doting uncle to whatever my mother has over that summer?&quot;<br />
&quot;I never thought about it that way,&quot; admitted Eric, laying next to her. &quot;With Nate, I&#39;ve obviously got lots of practice being a brother, but I&#39;ve never been an uncle before. Any thoughts on how to go about that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Just be yourself. The man I love and am spending the rest of my life with, and everything will be great,&quot; advised Julie, before kissing him again.<br />
<br />
As Martin Stovall continued kissing his way down his wife&#39;s body, Melissa raised her hips to encourage his actions, although he really didn&#39;t need any encouragement.<br />
&quot;Over all, how many children do you want to have?&quot; she asked.<br />
&quot;Truthfully?&quot; he asked in return, looking up from where he was. &quot;I&#39;ve never really thought about it. Neither of us have hit 50 yet, and the average were&#39;s life expectancy could be as long as 400, so as long as we space them out properly, we can have as many as you&#39;d like.&quot;<br />
&quot;I think, considering our elongated lives, we&#39;re at a decent pace to bring more were-mers into the world. But sometimes I do wonder about those prophecy dreams Julie and Eric had...&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll admit, I was a bit worried about them at first,&quot; confessed Martin, &quot;but Eric IS Julie&#39;s destined mate. There&#39;s no denying how much the two of them love each other. Just like I love you,&quot; he added, before gently kissing her vagina.<br />
&quot;Ohh... yesss...&quot; hissed Melissa, enjoying the moment. Then, when he teasingly paused to blow warm air upon her sensitive spot, she said, &quot;Julie also has a good head on her shoulders. Besides, once Eric was in the picture, I made arrangements with her doctor and the pharmacy to make sure she always gets her were-mermaid birth control pill prescription refilled on time,&quot; before shuddering in pleasure at Martin&#39;s handiwork.<br />
&quot;You sly minx you,&quot; teased her husband, before Martin turned his attention back to what he was doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You haven&#39;t had any more dreams about Eric Junior and Melinda lately, have you?&quot; Julie asked her mate.<br />
&quot;For better or worse, no. You?&quot;<br />
&quot;Afraid not,&quot; she confessed. &quot;I know we&#39;re not going to start our family until after we both graduate college and have our professional careers underway.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t tell you exactly when that is, but I do know there is a couple of years difference between them,&quot; recalled Eric.<br />
&quot;So there&#39;s a lot of parents&#39; night at the various schools in our future,&quot; Julie kidded him, before kissing his nose teasingly. &quot;But when the time is right, wouldn&#39;t you like to have more in our lives than just the two?&quot;<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t that at least as much your decision as mine?&quot;<br />
&quot;You wonderful man!&quot; said Julie, before hugging him tightly. &quot;But seriously, even though we&#39;re so in love and... active, I&#39;m faithfully taking my were-mermaid birth control pill every day. After all, we don&#39;t want to screw up our dreams or the time line and risk our children&#39;s future, do we?&quot;<br />
&quot;Certainly not!&quot; agreed Eric, before snuggling up next to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;There... is... s-so... much life has a-head of us,&quot; realized Melissa Stovall, as she experienced another orgasm courtesy of her loving husband. &quot;And there is no one I want to be with and love more than you!&quot; exclaimed Melissa, as Martin received the tasty treat he was hoping his oral efforts would grant him. &quot;But if I&#39;m going to be out of commission for a while, so to speak, I want to enjoy this moment to its fullest. So get ready buster!&quot; she warned him, before Melissa forced her husband onto his back and mounted Martin.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have such a bright future together Eric Anderson,&quot; cooed Julie, snuggling against him.<br />
&quot;I know, my future Mrs. Anderson, and the only places you will ever find me is by your side and in your heart,&quot; he promised.<br />
&quot;As you are with me,&quot; she said in return. &quot;But before we have to end this joyous moment, let alone get on with the evening, I want you again!&quot; proclaimed Julie, before she turned Eric on his back and mounted him.<br />
<br />
AND OUTSIDE THE CLOSED BEDROOM DOOR OF ERIC ANDERSON...<br />
His father, William Anderson heard every word exchanged between his son and fiance, thanks to his keen vulpine hearing.<br />
Although he was still within his human form, it didn&#39;t require a werefox&#39;s acute sense of smell to know what the two teenagers were up to.<br />
It was basically just the two of them. His wife Martha had driven their neighbor Samantha Twist to the hospital to see if they could discover where Samantha&#39;s wife Frances was** and Nate was still with his boyfriend Alex Ramsey.<br />
William had originally just gone upstairs to check on the young couple, but simply smiled as he realized what was going on behind the closed door.<br />
<i>My boys are growing up,</i> he thought happily. <i>Both in love with wonderful future mates. Moving to Moon Lake was definitely the best thing that ever happened to this family.</i><br />
With that, he quietly went back downstairs to work on his college schedule for the coming week.<br />
Upon entering his study, William decided to leave the door open while waiting for either Eric and Julie to make an official appearance, Nate to come home from Alex&#39;s, or word from Martha about the Twists.<br />
