<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy could hardly believe he had just agreed to try jocking out.  He was already very embarrassed of the thought and worried about the consequences.   Yet he was afraid of reneging on what he&#39;d just said, so he&#39;d probably just have to go along with it now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on boy, open your mouth,&quot; Tyler suddenly said.<br />
<br />
Andy didn&#39;t know what to do so he just opened his mouth wide, looking at Tyler, who padded on over and suddenly popped a jockstrap right into Andy&#39;s mouth.  &quot;Get down on your knees, you nerd,&quot; he said, pushing Andy down.  Will helped pull Andy&#39;s legs up and get him on all fours.<br />
<br />
Andy could feel the sickening taste of the fabric of the jock strap in his mouth -- mostly he just felt the dry taste of cloth on his tongue and on his gums, but he knew he was probably getting gross sweat or whatever other groin tastes were on the strap in his mouth, too.<br />
<br />
Andy could feel his Adam&#39;s apple bulge out as he braced his body against the floor, working hard to maintain his position on his hands and knees that they had forced him into so as to not look like a wimp.  He was scared and couldn&#39;t help but moan and whimper a little, horrified to hear his voice loose its boyish timbre and loosen up into rougher, more masculine grunts.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck!!!&quot; he heard himself swear through the fabric, groaning, shocked that he had just sworn.  He figured he couldn&#39;t really blame himself considering what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
His clothes were starting to pinch and he felt covered with sweat.  &quot;Guys,&quot; he tried to say, hearing it come out in a half grunt as he heard the fabric of his shirt start to rip.  &quot;Guys what are you doing to me, come on..&quot;  His feet hurt so bad and suddenly he felt his swelling feet buckle the material and burst through, sizes too big now.  &quot;Fuck!!!&quot; he said again, uncontrollably.  He was confused and wanted to at least see what was happening to him.<br />
<br />
Will grabbed the hem of his shirt and pulled it rudely over his head, sticking momentarily on Andy&#39;s chin.  &quot;Yeah bro, gettin swole,&quot; Will said.  &quot;This ain&#39;t gonna fit no more.  Look at you ripping out of those jeans,&quot; he said.  Andy didn&#39;t feel any rips, just the fabric tight up against his calves and thighs, and then suddenly he felt the denim rip right across his ass, exposing his white underwear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww yeah, look at that ass, man,&quot; Tyler said.  &quot;Lemme lay my hands on that.  I gotta see that booty up close.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler paced over and slapped one of his big hands on Andy&#39;s exposed undies.  Andy, much to his embarrassment, felt his dick thicken up and twitch slightly with the thrill of Tyler&#39;s hand.  &quot;What are you doing, man,&quot; Andy said, still on all fours but trying to look over his shoulder back at Tyler.   At least he still had his underwear on, but almost as soon as he thought that Tyler said, &quot;Hey, you should take those undies off, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Will helped tear off the remnants of Andy&#39;s pants and get him out of his destroyed shoes, having to flip him on his back in the process so that he could slide his underwear down.  Will stripped Andy&#39;s socks off, too.  Andy was definitely getting some muscle but still enough of a lightweight for Will to manage.  &quot;Aww yeah,&quot; Will said, &quot;starting to get a little hair in those pits!&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy looked over to his bare pit with horror, seeing he was indeed getting a little peach fuzz there where he had always been smooth.  Will had slid his undies off, and he looked down and saw his cock was already getting thicker and longer.  He was sure it wasn&#39;t just his imagination, they were really making him jock up.  His thighs and abs definitely looked lie a teenage jock&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys, I can&#39;t go through with this!&quot; Andy, staggering up to his feet, blurted out in his strange teenage jock voice, and he felt himself blush just hearing himself and standing there naked.  He could feel his bare feet against the cold floor and his hard cock bobbing in the locker room air.<br />
<br />
It felt so wrong, even as much as his did want to grab onto his own dick, mostly just to cover it up and stop it from bouncing.  Andy put both his hands on his groin in embarrassment, but even he had to admit it felt good to have his hands on his dick.  He dick almost even jerked slightly against them with an erotica twitch, it felt like, but he was sweating so nervously that he couldn&#39;t even really process the thought.  He tried to not move his hands and wanted to take them away, embarrassed.  But that might have been even more embarrassing because then he&#39;d just be not even trying to cover up.<br />
<br />
Loudly, Tyler said &quot;Get your hands off your groin, bro, what are you some faggot?,&quot; in almost a roar, mostly just to show off how loud and tough he could sound.  His voice really resonated in the locker room like that.  It seemed kind of cool to Tyler that he could even make his voice sound just like the jocks now if he wanted.  &quot;Yeah I called you a faggot!&quot; he said louder, looking into Andy&#39;s eyes.  &quot;Get down on your knees and give me 40 pushups, nerd!&quot;  Whoa, where was this coming from?  Tyler figured it was worth testing it out on Andy though.  He could now though and it was pretty funny, he knew he was just playing with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tyler, I, I can&#39;t&quot; Andy said, knowing he could barely do one pushup, ashamed to hear the tenor of his new voice come out saying no.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah you can, you bitch, you&#39;ve got muscles now.  Do it!!!&quot; Tyler shouted, getting in Andy&#39;s face with a roar just for fun.<br />
<br />
Andy got back down on all fours, feeling intimidated by Tyler&#39;s screaming in his face, finding he actually could do pushups.  He could feel sweat breaking out across his back and in his pits.  Shit.  That was embarrassing.   He was sweating hard and gasping for air as he finished up his set of 40, his muscles feeling thicker now as he almost stumbled getting back up on his feet to look at Tyler.</p>
