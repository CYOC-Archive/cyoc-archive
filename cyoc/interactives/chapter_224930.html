<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hailey laid in the layers of blankets, still suffering from blood withdrawal, if she didn’t feed soon she would become feral and tear apart these survivors. <br />
She closed her eyes only for a moment but when she opened them again there was light coming from the boarded up windows, it was the next day.<br />
When the door to the bungalow opened she thought she would get burned alive by the sunlight but she saw that the sky was still covered in dark clouds, the sun was shining but no direct sunlight would hit the island.<br />
Jonas was accompanied by who she assumed was James, he was an older man with dusty brown hair and a beard. The two were carrying a long surfboard with a badly injured man on it. They set the man in the corner next to Hailey and tried to tend to his wounds but after a while they had given up, he was dying and there was nothing the small group of survivors could do.<br />
Kelly had broken out in tears, she couldn’t take all these deaths, Jonas escorted her outside and tried to calm her down, James had left to find others, leaving the vampire alone with the soon to be dead man.<br />
<br />
Hailey slowly got up with a surge of energy she didn’t know she had and pounced on the suffering man. She tried to rationalize the act to herself; the man was going to die, and his death would allow her to recover and save any other survivors on the island.<br />
She latched onto the man’s neck with her fangs, this was the first time she had fed on a live person, she’d only ever drunken from blood bags provided by S.P.E.A.R. This was different, the warm rushing blood was like ecstasy to the young woman, she felt the strength returning to her body, she even felt herself become stronger. <br />
The blonde was so caught up with her meal that she failed to notice James who had re entered. He dropped the supplies he’d gathered and looked upon the woman with shock and fear. Hailey stopped feeding and craned her neck to look at the intruder, her pupils were dilated like a shark’s and her previously green eyes had become feral with red sclera. Before he could scream the barefoot woman launched herself at him, sending the two tumbling out of the hut. <br />
<br />
“What the hell?! What’s going on?” Jonas shouted as the two turned to look at the attacker. <br />
<br />
“Is she one of those things?!” Kelly screamed.<br />
<br />
“No. She’s Not.” Jonas replied in shock as Hailey now lunged at them.<br />
<br />
James was lying in the sand, his head practically ripped from his body. Jonas had stepped between the vampire and Kelly. His pointless display of chivalry did nothing to stop the crazed woman from ripping him apart, soaking herself in his blood. <br />
Once Kelly was the only one left, Hailey was on top of her, pinning the human’s wrists with her hands, the vampire’s knee was pinned between Kelly’s legs. Hailey trailed her face up the other woman’s shoulders, leading up to her neck. Her instincts guided her to stroke the woman’s thighs, working her fingers under the human’s crotch. Once her target was aroused and her blood was rushing she slowly dug her fangs into the other blonde’s tanned soft flesh. Savoring the pained gasps as she did so. <br />
The dying man’s blood tasted good but it was sewer water compared to Kelly’s. <br />
A woman’s blood was pure pleasure and sweeter than anything on this earth. She drank slowly and continued to pleasure the woman as she sucked on her neck. <br />
Kelly’s eyes were glossy and her mouth hung open. Her life was being drained from her, a mix of pain and pleasure as she succumbed to death.<br />
When her victim was drained Hailey gently lowered the body onto the blood soaked sand. <br />
Her blood induced adrenaline had begun to feign and tears streamed from her vampiric red eyes. Hailey was just beginning to realize what she had done, drinking fresh blood after never having done so must of driven her into a frenzy. Horrified at her actions she gripped her long blonde hair, it was covered in blood.<br />
<br />
The sound of breaking branches drew the blonde’s attention and her monstrous vampire eyes saw the source; a small group of destitute survivors. She cracked her neck and with a feral scream she jumped at the group, her blood frenzy returning.<br />
<br />
—————-<br />
<br />
Henry was getting tired of this island, he’d encountered and fought against the undead that infested this island. The lycan had determined that a powerful dark wizard was responsible for these monsters and the storm. He was relieved that the sunlight was blocked by the supernatural clouds as his partner wouldn’t be killed by sunlight. The worst part was that none of these zombies appreciated his dry pan quips. <br />
<br />
He was making his way around to the coast when he heard a heartbreaking cry. He entered a clearing with bungalows and his heart dropped when he took in the gruesome scene before him;<br />
His partner was sitting in a pool of blood and guts, sitting the fetal position, softly crying to herself. Her clothes were in tatters and she was covered in blood.<br />
Around her were over a dozen brutalized bodies, he noticed that the women were drained of blood and the men were ripped apart with extreme prejudice.<br />
<br />
He carefully approached the traumatized woman and she looked up at him, her eyes had returned to normal and were streaming with tears, the lower part of her face and mouth were covered in blood, some still dripped from her mouth.<br />
Instantly he took off his black coat and placed it around the barely clothed woman. She held it tight.<br />
<br />
“….I-I-I-I d-didn’t……” she stammered in between sobs.<br />
<br />
“Shhhhh…. It’s alright, it’s alright. I know.” He said and hugged her.<br />
<br />
“T-this wasn’t— I d-didn’t.” She cried.<br />
<br />
He knew she must have been injured in the crash and had no choice but to drink fresh human blood. For a vampire like her that has never done so before it had sent her into a rage, she had become wild and had no control over her actions, her vampire instincts took over. <br />
He couldn’t imagine the pain she was in, she wanted to be good like Marisa, but here she was: standing in the blood of around 20 innocent humans.<br />
<br />
This was bad, they were in hostile territory and zombies were roaming the island. His partner was in no shape to fight and he wouldn’t force her to. He lifted the blonde and carried her back through the jungle, his werewolf strength allowing him to run quickly through the foliage. <br />
<br />
As he carried her all she would do was cry and occasionally mutter random words. She was clearly traumatized and he didn’t know if she would be able to carry on with the mission, at least not in this state she was in.<br />
Henry saw from the tree line that there was a dock with a series of small bungalows at the end of the pier, he used his lycan sense of smell to find that the place was zombie free, at least form now. Henry brought Hailey to the hut at the end and barricaded the doors and windows before getting the shower turned on and placed her inside. He rifled through the dressers and retrieved some fresh clothes for her once she had finished cleaning off all the dirt and blood.<br />
While she was in the shower he waited, his big gun in hand facing the only door he didn’t block, just in case. He thought about what he was going to say to her. How he would comfort her and help her understand that what had happened wasn’t her fault.</p>
