<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Milton was walking around town one afternoon and he came across a gym that had big windows facing out into the street so that everyone could see inside.  There was something growing inside Milton that drew him to want to go inside and work his muscles, and he could not ignore it.<br />
<br />
He ran home and found some old gym clothes that he had stashed away.  Apparently these clothes were a few years old because they were tighter on him, not skin tight, but enough that you could see any muscles in plain view.  Milton made a mental note to go buy some bigger clothes for future workouts.<br />
<br />
When he got back to the gym, he went inside, signed a waiver that was standard for all new people, and changed his clothes.  After he walked out of the changeroom, he was astonished at all the machines and free weights that there were, and also at the variety of people that were working out.  Short people, tall people, small, big, in between, all this was new to him like his new life.  Little did Milton know how much his life was going to change!<br />
<br />
Despite never really having worked out before except when he was forced to in phys ed, he seemed to have a knowledge of what he had to do in order to make his muscles grow.<br />
<br />
He started with the bench press, he didn't know how much to lift, so he just guessed and experimented until he found the correct weights.  His chest expanded with an enormous pump, stretching his shirt almost to the breaking point.  The feeling was exhilarating to Milton, so he worked out every part of his body never wanting the feeling to end.<br />
<br />
Back in the changeroom, he took off his shirt and stood in front of the mirror.  His muscles were standing out in bold relief, red and pumped like they had never been before.  Milton touched his body and felt an erotic shock run through his body.  As he stood there, a couple of other patrons came into the changeroom and complimented Milton on his physique.  He decided right then and there that he would become a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
Pumped yet exhausted from his workout, Milton went home and crashed on his bed without getting undressed and slept the rest of the day.  When he woke up the next morning, he felt something strange, like a draft.  He looked down and saw that his muscles had grown over the night and bust through his clothes.  He thought it was cool, but also worried about what he was going to do about growing out of his clothes.  Suddenly, he didn't care anymore, he just knew that his muscles were growing and that was the only thing that mattered.<br />
<br />
At school he caught up with Ty, who was amazed at the person standing before him.  &quot;Whoa dude!&quot; Ty exclaimed &quot;What happened to you?&quot; Milton just replied that he went to the gym last night and worked out.  Ty was glad that Milton was starting to get over his shyness.  &quot;Good for you man, just don't get all cocky and everything, we need good, decent people around.&quot; Milton promised that he wouldn't change, and he never did.<br />
<br />
Milton went out to workout almost every day.  In a short period of time, he started to look like a real bodybuilder.  His pecs were becoming full and round, his abs became a washboard, his arms were growing balls of muscle being pushed to the sides by his growing lats, his legs thickening, calves growing into diamonds.  He became more muscular, more achingly handsome every day, yet he never lost his passion for helping people.<br />
<br />
People at school were constantly amazed at him, all the sports teams begged him to join, but he just was quite content being a bodybuilder.<br />
<br />
One day after a particularly hard workout, he walked outside and saw a young man looking in the window.  Milton stopped and chatted with the man, finding out that he had just finished a volunteer shift, and was drawn to the view in the window.  This guy wished that he could look like Milton and this broke Milton's heart.  Milton wished that this young guy could have the same opportunity as him, and wondered if Ty would be the one to give him that chance.</p>
