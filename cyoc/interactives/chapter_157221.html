<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Deonna, formally Dale looked around at the prison cells which contained more then a few people she had known as a human male. This was her old home town, she remembered sitting on the now pulled back bleachers watching basketball games or playing kickball during gym class. The gym was now full of metal rods all driven deep into the floor which supported chain link fences which contained the humans. Her mother and father had walked forward toward two pens which stood side by side, she was about to join them when her eyes settled on one cage. <br />
<br />
Two figures remained in the cage; one was a short squat boy with thick rim glasses wearing a shirt which was just large enough to cover his gut. His name was Jeff, he was pale as hell, considering he had spent the better part of his free time either on the internet, playing chess or organizing one card game or another. His arm was in a sling and he tried to avoid her gaze, he had done that with every girl he thought was hot since middle school. Still Deonna remembered the good times, how they would help each other out dealing with bullies, he had gotten the worse of that stick, but Jeff had been the top student in the class since they started keeping track in 5th grade. He was also Dale’s best friend.<br />
<br />
Beside him was an African American man who had a better build then Jeff, which wasn’t hard. Mike had moved to the school at the start of freshman year and he and Dale became friends both playing Trumpet in marching band. Mike wasn’t as smart as Jeff but few people where, but Mike was a musical type he wrote jazz music, nothing award winning but still good and got along well enough with the ladies. <br />
<br />
Deonna could see her father and mother talking about some other human in a cage debating which one of two to get, to join her as their son or daughter. That was a choose for her parents. She moved toward the cell, her high heels clicking on the basketball court as she approached the gate. One of the guards seeing her walked forward.<br />
<br />
“Princess, can I help you?” inquired the demon guard as Deonna blinked for a moment, how did this guard know she was the Princess. She wasn’t transformed live on TV, there was no camera for her transformation. Then she realized she arrived with her mother and father, the Queen and King of hell. It was logical to assume that she was their daughter.<br />
<br />
“Yes, please open this cell.” ordered Deonna as the guard bowed and placed his hand on a glowing seal which unlocked the door. Deonna stepped through along with the guard, he didn’t want to answer to the King and Queen if their daughter was harmed. For their part Jeff and Mike moved backwards against the far chain wall.<br />
<br />
Deonna grinned a bit, showing a little of her fanged teeth as she moved forward stopping a few feet away from her two human friends. They were cowering in fear, Jeff almost pissing himself in fear. She could smell the fear coming off of them as she extended her hand, the perfectly manicured hand.<br />
<br />
“You still owe me $5 from lunch last week, Jeff.” said Deonna as both men, eyes widened in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Wh…what?” inquired Jeff confused as hell as he looked at the demoness before him. <br />
<br />
“You forgot your lunch money and I spotted you $5 for some pizza.” explained Deonna with a playful grin. “I know I look very different now, but you haven’t forgotten that have you?” <br />
<br />
“My God, Dale?” inquired Mike as Jeff’s mouth fell open as Deonna gave a playful smile.<br />
<br />
“I go by Deonna now, but yet.” confirmed Deonna “I am now daughter of Lucifer King of Hell and Lilith Queen of Hell.”<br />
<br />
“So can you get us out of here and somewhere safe?” inquired Jeff<br />
<br />
“And where would that be?” inquired Deonna “Humanity has fallen, the world belongs to us now. What happened to your parents?”<br />
<br />
“House burned down, they died in the flames.” said Jeff as Deonna noticed his arm was in a sling because it was badly burned.<br />
<br />
“Demons already took them, turned them into mindless slaves.” stated Mike “Yours, your human ones?”<br />
<br />
“Ah…they left me to the demons to try to get my brother out, they ended up as a two headed dog and him a mindless slave.” said Deonna with venom in her voice, she wanted to forget about her human parents but not these two people before her, these where her friends.<br />
<br />
“Deonna who are these two?” inquired a new voice as Lucifer entered the cell, outside Lilith stood with a scared looking 15 or 16-year-old girl in front of her. <br />
<br />
“Father, allow me to introduce Mike and Jeff, they are my best friends when I was human.” explained Deonna as Jeff’s plead for her help came to mind. “May we bring them home; they are my best friends.”<br />
<br />
Lucifer consider, but only for a moment before nodding his head.  <br />
<br />
“I don’t see why not.” said Lucifer as he looked toward his wife who nodded in agreement. The Palace, was large enough to handle two more people, considering the palace and the surrounding palace complex was larger than New York city.<br />
<br />
“Please follow us.” said Deonna as she turned and followed her father out the door, Jeff and Mike paused for a moment, unsure what to do but they followed them out with the guard right behind them. <br />
<br />
Another portal opened below them, and they were back in the throne room. The three humans stood dumbfounded as they looked around at the great hall. <br />
<br />
“Now…first you.” said Lilith as she raised her hand and pointed toward the scared girl, Dale had seen her around, but she was a freshman to his senior. Deonna watched as the girl changed, her skin turned red like their father and horns grew out of the side of her head pulling back and out like their mother. Her hair turned jet black like their father as a forked tail like their father and wings like their mother grew in. Her dirty cloths changed into a pair of black jeans and a red top. Her head bowed down as her eyes which were now golden flashed.<br />
<br />
“Mother…father…sister.” said the new daughter of Lucifer.<br />
<br />
“Two daughters.” Said Lilith with joy in her voice as she pulled her new daughter into a hug. Followed moments later by Deonna. <br />
<br />
“Now for you two.” said Lucifer</p>
