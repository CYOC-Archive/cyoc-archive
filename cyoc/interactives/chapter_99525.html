<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lili could not be certain that what was happening was not some sort of weird nightmare, but it seemed real enough.  Even though no one around her had reacted yet, she did not want to draw attention, especially with her fake identity.  Although she was panicking, Lili still had enough presence of mind to realize she needed to get out of the workplace and return to an environment she had control over.<br />
<br />
Reaching her supervisor&#39;s office, she stuck her head in the door, trying to sound as normal as possible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Dan?&quot;  she began, her voice sounding different to her ears.  &quot;I&#39;m not feeling that good, I&#39;m gonna take the rest of the day off and head home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan looked up, then waved her into the office.  Reluctantly, and uncomfortably, Lili stepped in, worried about Dan&#39;s reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay, Lilian?&quot;  Dan asked, to which Lili nodded, eager to get out, but Dan continued.  &quot;Look, I know it&#39;s hard on you being different, but we hired you because of your capabilities.  You don&#39;t have to push yourself so hard to fit in.&quot;  Lili was completely lost, but Dan mistook her blank look for embarrassment.  Leaning back in his chair, he said, &quot;Go on home, I hope you feel better tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grabbing her purse, which still held the TFCams tracker, Lili made a beeline for the building exit.  Not wanting to wait for a bus, she hailed a cab as her physical discomfort continued to grow, including a headache.  Finally reaching home 45 minutes later, Lili did not exhale until she had locked her front door behind her.<br />
<br />
Bart&#39;s wet nose brought her back to her senses, as she realized it was a lot closer to eye level than usual.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Bart, what&#39;s happening to me?&quot;  she nearly sobbed, throwing her arms around his neck.  &quot;I really might have gotten myself into a mess this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not one to normally let her emotions get the better of her, her current state showed just how big a toll the day&#39;s events had taken on Lili.  Still, she managed to pull herself together and went into the bathroom, closing the door.  As she removed her clothes, Lili began to see just how much her body had altered.<br />
<br />
Where she once stood at a comfortable 5 foot 2 inches, her total height now barely reached 4 feet.  Her frame had shrunk proportionally as well, but that was not the only change.  Her chest had completely flattened, and was slightly muscular.  Her skin had passed pink and was now approaching a reddish hue.  Her hair was now black and much shorter, having a wild boyish look.  Her ears seemed to have lengthened to a point, and her teeth appeared a bit sharper, especially her incisors.  However, rather than a fierce appearance, her face had a handsome dignity about it, although its youthfulness had an almost cherubic aspect.  The nubs above her temples had lengthened and turned darker and sharper, and now began to  look more like horns.  <br />
<br />
As she removed her shirt, she also felt a strange protuberance from each of her shoulders, although she could not quite figure out what it was.  Her fingernails seemed longer, sharper, and darker.  Sliding her shoes and pants off, she stared at her once-smooth legs, which were now covered in dark hair, which could almost be considered fur.  Her feet too seemed odd, her toes having taken on an almost black hue.  However, the greatest shock came when she finally worked up the courage to remove her underwear.  Under the dusting of fur was something which clearly didn&#39;t belong, and had definitely grown a bit since she left work:  male genitalia.  But even that paled in comparison to what she discovered upon turning around.  Hanging from the end of her spine was flesh and bone which had begun twitching now that it was freed from the constrainging cloth:  a tail.  <br />
<br />
Shivering more out of terror than cold, Lili grabbed a large blanket and wrapped it around her strange body, then exited to the bedroom where a worried Bart sat and whined slightly.  Sitting on the bed, Lili scratched lightly behind his ears, and said waveringly, &quot;I dunno what to do here, buddy...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just at that moment, a wave of severe achiness racked Lili&#39;s frame. Dropping the towel and groaning as she curled naked into the fetal position on the bed, she felt like her legs and shoulders were being pulled apart.  The painful sensation continued to increase until Lili, exhausted, passed out.<br />
<br />
When Lili came to hours later, it was dark, but she could still see her room and Bart curled up on the floor next to her bed.  Sitting up, her upper body felt strangely heavy, and she assumed her feet must have gone to sleep, as she couldn&#39;t really feel the floor.  The clock on her nightstand said 2 AM.   Carefully stepping across the carpet to the light switch, Lili flipped it on as Bart raised his head to look at her.  Taking a deep breath, and willing the events from the day to have been just a bad dream, Lili walked over to the long mirror in the corner of her bedroom.  Reluctantly, she turned to face it and gasped.  If the face staring back at her didn&#39;t blink at the same time she did, she would have doubted her eyes.<br />
<br />
Long slender horns curved now over her pointy ears.  Turning to a side, she finally understood why her upper body felt so strange:  sprouting from her shoulders was a pair of leathery wings.  Her gender was also now definitely male, and the short tail which she...he....had earlier, had now sprouted into a full-length wiry prehensile tail with a spade-shaped tip.  However, the most stunning change was that from the waist down, he now bore furry legs akin to a goat, right down to his black cloven-hoofed feet.<br />
<br />
Staring at the mirror, the pieces finally fell into place, and Lili realized what the TFCams auctions were all about, even though she couldn&#39;t begin to grasp how they had done it.  For all intents and purposes, Lili was now in the body of an enchanting 10-year-old male demon.</p>
