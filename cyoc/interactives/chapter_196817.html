<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">From the look on Mike&#39;s face the real Sharon immediately understood something was wrong &quot;What&#39;s up Mom? You look as though you have just seen a ghost&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike looked across at his mother, now a same sex twin of his true twin sister Mary. &quot;Um. I just realised that I left my handbag at work. And the car keys and other important things are in it. I&#39;ll have to go back&quot; She emphasised &#39;Important things&#39;<br />
<br />
Sharon immediately grasped what Mike meant. &quot;Yep we had better. We have to go Tom. I&#39;ll see you Thursday&quot; she gave Tom a goodbye kiss. <br />
<br />
Likewise Mary said farewell to Grant. &quot;I&#39;ll give you a call tomorrow&quot;<br />
<br />
Soon Mike and the two girls were walking back to the restaurant as fast as Mike could walk in his mother&#39;s shoes. Her feet were killing her by now. She had been walking in these damned shoes all night. <br />
<br />
The turned into the street where the restaurant was and noticed the lights were no longer on. &quot;Oh No!&quot; Make found herself saying. Her fears were realised when they found the door locked. Mike banged on the door but there was no answer. She realised Tracey must have locked up and gone home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know this Tracey&#39;s number?&quot; Mary suggested. &quot;She must have only just left&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No I don&#39;t&quot; Mike wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no big deal&quot; Exclaimed Sharon, trying to calm the situation. She could see Mike was getting distraught &quot;You must have put the bag somewhere safe. We just come back in the morning when the restaurant reopens. We can catch a bus home&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I put it in a cupboard in the kitchen. Tracey allocated me a space to put my things&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It will still be there in the morning. We have nothing to worry about. Come-on we need to get back to the cinemas, that&#39;s where the buses stop&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Couldn&#39;t we just catch a taxi&quot; Mike bemoaned<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I&#39;ve only got ten dollars left and your the one we both spent all the cash we had. The buses will have to do&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But my feet are killing me&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to my world Mike. They are new shoes, they just need to be worn in. That&#39;s the price of looking good&quot; The real Sharon replied.<br />
<br />
Hours later they got home. One consolation for Mike was that he got to sleep in his mother&#39;s bed. <br />
..........<br />
Next morning Mike, still in his mother&#39;s body let himself be made up once more by his mother, who was insisting she be called Michelle while in her teenage body. At least &#39;Michelle&#39; would be accompanying her back to the restaurant and had found some cash so they could go in by taxi. They had looked up the restaurants website and saw that it opened at 11 so timed the taxi&#39;s arrival so they would get there right on opening.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately &#39;Michelle&#39; also insisted that Mike also dress appropriately. Sharon wanted more shifts and hence wanted Mike to look elegant. This meant she was once more in a skirt and top that showed off her curves and found herself in moderate heels. At least they did not have to walk far. Mike had developed blisters the previous night. <br />
<br />
The taxi stopped around the corner from the restaurant and Mike as the adult paid the driver. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder what has happened?&quot; expressed &#39;Michelle&#39; as Mike got out of the taxi. Mike looked in the direction &#39;Michelle&#39; was gazing. A police car was outside the premises. The two walked to the door. Inside Mike saw the policeman talking to a woman she didn&#39;t know and a man she recognised as Tony, the manager from last night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry we are closed&quot; said the man Mike didn&#39;t recognise upon see the two females walk into his establishment. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright boss&quot; said Tony &quot;This is Sharon the new waitress who started last night&quot; he then addressed Mike &quot;I didn&#39;t realise you had another shift this morning&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike had been rehearsing what she had to say. She was glad to recognise Tony and not have to explain who she was &quot;Oh no. I just came to retrieve my bag. I left it here last night&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh&quot; said Tony. He had a look on his face that didn&#39;t bode well &quot;A brown bag about so big?&quot; he gestured the approximate size. <br />
<br />
Mike glanced at &#39;Michelle&#39; she gave a faint nod. <br />
<br />
&#39;That sounds right&quot; Mike said<br />
<br />
The policeman took over. &quot;That solves one mystery. We found a bag thrown into the foodscrap bin outside. We were wondering who it belonged to&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My belongings?&quot; Mike asked tentatively. &quot;Phone, keys, purse, some jewellery?&quot;<br />
<br />
The policeman looked doubtful. &quot;I&#39;d say the thief took anything they thought had value. No valuables in it sorry. Just make-up and junk&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Could I have a look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My associate has just bagged it. We were going to dust it for prints&quot; he called out &quot;Henry bring that handbag over&quot;<br />
<br />
A second policeman appeared. He was wearing plastic gloves and carried a clear plastic bag. Inside the bag Mike recognised the handbag her mother had given her last night. &quot;That&#39;s it&quot; said Mike. &quot;Can I have a look inside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wear some gloves and touch as little as possible&quot; the first policeman said.<br />
<br />
As Mike put on the offered plastic gloves, she felt herself starting to panic. What if the medallion was not inside? She would be stuck in her mother&#39;s body. She did not hear the policeman talking about the missing restaurant takings. <br />
<br />
Mike searched the bag fruitlessly. She was not the least bit worried to find no car keys or purse but she went all dizzy when she realised the medallion was no longer in the bag. She had to sit down. &quot;Michelle&#39; gave her a comforting cuddle.</p>
