<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at the merging package, he had a very weird idea.  See, Jeff has a sixteen-year-old girlfriend, Sasha Walter, that is an okay girlfriend, but doesn’t have much to offer but her love to him.  She’s part of the cheerleading group with perky B cup breasts, teenage hips, blonde hair in a ponytail, and a pair of blue eyes.  A fair girl, but not so much to show for it.  That’s when he has the idea of merging his girlfriend with someone else.  Someone hotter then her.  That would make his love life more interesting.  The problem is who to merge her with.<br />
<br />
The only person she could think of is his own mother, Irene.  Being a forty-year-old mother of three, she was somewhat hot for an older woman.  She was a somewhat tall, about 5&#39; 10&quot;, only a bit taller than him at 16, and she was a tad overweight, as to be expected from birthing and raising two kids, small reservoirs of fat spread across her belly and backside mostly.  She has breast size that was between CC and D and they were slightly droopy and her waist was showing a muffin top, but gave her curves a bit of a mature field.  Her brown hair was kept shoulder length, functional and pretty, framing her womanly face, barely noticeable dark marks under her green eyes and slight crows feet at the edges, due to the pressures of being a single working mother.  If Jeff can merge his girlfriend with her mother, the ages with even out and it might make her somewhere around her thirties with a hot body.  Seems easy enough…<br />
<br />
He soon started to type down the information he needed to help merge the two together.  He soon skims through the information of the names, age, and occupation of the two.<br />
<br />
‘Target 1<br />
<br />
Name: Sasha Walter<br />
Age: 16<br />
Occupation: Cheerleader, Girlfriend of Jeff<br />
<br />
Target 2<br />
<br />
Name: Irene Morgan<br />
Age: 43<br />
Occupation: Housewife, Mother’<br />
<br />
Looking to the information, he was ready to begin the merging process.  But then, he noticed something underneath the target 2 section.  It is a check box with a title next to it that says, ‘Enter Third Target (optional)’  He blinked and said, “Third option…?  I don’t recall the message saying that you can add a third option.  Maybe it’s something else that the package didn’t mention.”  Clicking on the check box, there is another information section and a pop up message that says…<br />
<br />
‘Congratulations in adding another target to merge.  This is where you can choose more people to merge into one person.  This means that more then two targets in one with ranges from 3 to over a billion.  Just remember that merging too many people could lead to some questionable results.  So don’t merge too many at one time.’<br />
<br />
Jeff read the message and decided to listen to it.  “Okay…  I won’t merge too many people.” he said to himself, “Thanks for the advice.”  Closing the window, he looked t the third option and wondered what to do with it.  So far, he already got his girlfriend and mother to merge into an even hotter girlfriend, but maybe adding one more would do the trick.  But the question is who he’s going to merge next.<br />
<br />
Then the one thing that came out of his head is his young sister, Amy.  Though five years of age, she was cute and innocent with light brown hair done up into pigtails and light blue eyes.  She always looked up to Jeff as a role model and wanted to be by his side.  Just thinking about it, if he merged her sister with her mother and girlfriend, not only will Sasha be both younger and hotter, but also shows some innocence in her.  Seems like the perfect time to experiment.  So getting into the third option, she typed down Amy’s name of occupation and was pleased with what it says.<br />
<br />
‘Target 3<br />
<br />
Name: Amy Morgan<br />
Age: 5<br />
Occupation: Little Sister of Jeff and Alex and Daughter of Irene and Mike’<br />
<br />
Looking at this, he decided to continue on and a new window option opened up and giving him additional choices.  Those choices include, Mental Changes, Clothing Changes, Awareness, Alter Reality, Transformation Time, and Duration.  Jeff’s guess is that these are the options of what he needs to choose for merging all three people to one.  Curious, he decided to mark down all the choice.<br />
<br />
The first one is to turn the Mental Change on for all the minds of the three targets join into one.  Then another option appeared below what she choose, stating, ‘To which mind will dominate one body’.  He figures that if all memories and knowledge of all three targets merge into one, one mind must have full control of the new body both physically and mentally.  And since he wanted his girlfriend to be super hot, he decided to choose Sasha to be the one in charge.  After all, choosing either his one mom or sister would be awkward to talk to, especially with the dream body of his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Next he choose the no for the clothing option, as even if he merged all three people to one, he doesn’t know if the clothing would merge into something a bit more strange.  Besides, his mom has plenty of outfits in her closet and it would fit his girlfriend’s new body pretty well.  And as an added bonus that he would see his new girlfriend’s naked form, which would give him quite a boner.<br />
<br />
Next is the awareness as he needed to make sure that none of the women won’t notice their bodies melting and merging into one.  Doing so will scare them and have a panic attack.  So he decided to put no on the Awareness option just for safety reasons.  And the same will go with the Alter Reality option as he would have his new and improved girlfriend for the night and see how it will go.  That way if the girlfriend he got was something he wanted, he would switch it to yes and alter all reality around them.<br />
<br />
The last one is transformation time and duration.  This one is quite unique as it depicts the how long through the transformation and how long the end result would last.  The thought of seeing the three merge excite him, but he didn’t want it to last too long, just a fair pace just to make it flow easily, to he typed down ten minutes, a fair amount of time during the merging.  Now for duration, he thought long and hard of how long the changes would last.  He didn’t want the effects to last too long, nor does he what it to be short.  So under pressure, he decided to go for a full day, 24 hours tops, to test out the effects and have a really good date with his merged girlfriend.  That way, soon after, he could see if he wanted to make the changes permanent or not.  It is better to play it safe then sorry after all.<br />
<br />
Once he was done putting together the information, he skimmed and scrolled down to see if he didn’t make any mistake.  When he went down, there are two buttons that have ‘Change’ and ‘Save’ on both ends and message above it that says…<br />
<br />
‘Warning!<br />
<br />
You have two options for you to choose from.  If you save this information, it will be automatically stored into the Chronivac and you will merge multi targets at a later time.  You can also continue with this and many other packages on the Chronivac whole the information you saved to merge your targets will remain in the database.  But if you choose change, be warned.  All individuals must be close to each other for it to work.  If they are far away, they would just melt into puddles and must slither from far and wide to rejoin and merge.  So be wise in using this option, otherwise you will have complications in this merge.  So choose wisely…’<br />
<br />
Jeff looked to the choices and was in a bit of a crossroads.  If he chooses to merge his mom, sister, and girlfriend at the same time, they will all melt away and journey to each other in puddle forms.  This could be a bit of a problem as he does not have the reality altering option off and there would be plenty of eyewitnesses seeing this.  Still, he could save it and wait until everyone is together, especially if Sasha would like to go on a date with him, which would be a perfect opportunity.  So thinking this, he wondered what he will do.  Save it for later, or merge the three women immediately?</p>
