<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brendon stumbled into the bathroom, his pulse racing while his hands continued to explore his upper body.  His pants and underwear were growing unbearably tight, so he slipped them off as best he could.  Was his cock bigger?  It was hard as a rock, to be sure.<br />
<br />
Glancing into the mirror, Brendon couldn't help but notice his face was a tad more defined.  A fine five o'clock shadow had appeared, lining his now-perfect jaw.  His nose was less bulbous and his cheekbones seemed higher, while his lips seemed fuller.<br />
<br />
He stepped back to get a better view.  Hair was continuing to engulf his upper body.  His forearms were now considerably hairy, reminding him of a guy at school named Paul whose body in general had a fair coating.  Brendon looked at least as hairy him now, and it was getting worse.  His upper arms were now growing a fine coating of fur, while a twist at the waist revealed a light dusting on his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Brendon mumbled, his own voice sounding distinctly foreign to him.  Looking over his shoulder in the mirror, he noticed the bathroom was getting a bit foggier.  The mist was moving in.<br />
<br />
Brendon suddenly lurched as a deep pain struck every muscle fibre in his body.  Cramped up and leaning against the bathroom wall, he closed his eyes tight and let out a grunt.  Another wave of pain hit him, but not as bad as the first.  Panting with sweat dripping down his forehead, he took another look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
A new development seemed to be wracking his body.  The hair was thicker in most places, but looked like it was slowing.  However, his lean 18 year old body looked bigger to him.  Another pain, another grunt and Brendon almost swore he saw his body expand a little.  His biceps looked larger, his thighs were nearly touching one another.  The waves of pain continued, but they were lessening.  Brendon stood transfixed as his body grew right before his eyes.  Pound after pound of muscle packed itself on, his pecs pushing out while his delts spread his back wide.  His torso was taking on that awesome V shape he's seen on so many professional bodybuilders in so many muscle magazines.<br />
<br />
Granted, Brendon was pleased to see the muscle development within his body, but the hair was getting to be a bit much.  It's progress had slowed, but had clearly not stopped.  His arms and chest were nearing the description of shaggy, evidently the hair growing on them had not stopped growing.  His legs resembled furry tree trunks.  He took another look at his back and saw that his shoulders were nearly covered and a patch of hair was creeping up from his rather hirsute bubble-butt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm goin' sasquatch or something...&quot; he breathed, both fascinated and revolted by his own body.  He was embarassed to see his hard-on had not diminished in the least.  In fact, one glance confirmed it.  He was bigger.  A good three or four inches bigger.  He could feel the weight of his hair-covered balls as they were pushed out by his expanding hamstrings.  All the new sensations washing over him only worsened his lust for his own body.<br />
<br />
The strangest thing was, from the neck up Brendon still resembled a well cut Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model.  But from the neck down he was looking more and more like something out of Harry and the Hendersons.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath and coughed.  The mist was still hanging in the room.  A light bulb suddenly went off in Brendon's head.  He flicked the switch for the bathroom fan and quickly closed the door.<br />
<br />
Slowly but surely the room cleared.  Brendon was uncertain what to do.  The mist was still outside the door, and would most likely continue his transformation.  But he could hardly stay locked inside the bathroom forever!  He wondered if his father had suffered the same effects.  Perhaps he should search him out.  On the other hand, he hadn't had much of a chance to experience his new endowments.</p>
