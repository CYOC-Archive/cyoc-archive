<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I followed Veronica into the kitchen, partly from sheer attraction to her (she smelled and looked SO GOOD) and <br />
partly because I wanted a private tete-a-tete with her. &quot;Make yourself comfortable,&quot; I told Meagan as I <br />
gestured to the couches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mm..mmhmm...&quot; she said, smiling and nodding, then brushing her hair nervously, very much looking like she was <br />
hot and bothered from Veronica's flirtatious suggestion moments earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay, love?&quot; Veronica asked me, casting me a seductive smile with an over the shoulder glance. She <br />
was busily working at the island in the middle of the kitchen, mixing drinks up with a practiced hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah..though I'm slightly confused at how you know all about being a werewolf, but I don't,&quot; I told her. <br />
Perhaps I shouldn't be so openly vulnerable with her, I knew..but it felt like I could genuinely trust her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a theory on that,&quot; she replied. &quot;When you cast the spell that made me a werewolf, it rewrote my <br />
history. I KNOW that I wasn't a werewolf my whole life..but I have memories of it. I can remember my first <br />
change, and my parents preparing me for it. I can remember the first time I killed an animal, a human..the <br />
first time I had sex ..with both a human and the first time with another werewolf. All these details are <br />
overlapping my original memories. Because I practice magic and was at the epicenter of your spell, or wish, or <br />
whatever you want to call it, somehow I've been able to keep them straight, though the new memories take <br />
precedence, and they're overwriting what was. All those other people you affected-they probably don't have any <br />
memory of anything different from what you wished. And you..because you're the one who did it, you exist <br />
outside of the mind-altering effects of the wish. So while you wished yourself into a werewolf, it's <br />
impossible for it to alter your memories. If you'd ALWAYS been one, you wouldn't have made the wish, so there <br />
would be a paradox. But that's really just a theory.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and nuzzled her, not caring that we had a guest and that we might be ignoring her for too long. I <br />
turned her around to face me and leaned my forehead against hers. &quot;You're pretty smart, you know that?&quot; I <br />
asked her with a smile. My hand slid up her leg and parted the robe slightly and my fingers caressed her inner <br />
thigh. I was ragingly attracted to her, and my cock hardened as I could smell her mildly musky scent much more <br />
clearly as I stimulated her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Down boy,&quot; she said playfully, nipping my bottom lip, then pulling me in for a long, wet kiss. &quot;We'll have <br />
time for that soon enough.&quot; She put a couple drinks in my hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;What're these?&quot; I asked her. I sniffed, but couldn't smell any one specific scent strongly enough to really <br />
place it, beyond the artificially fruity smell of the juice she'd used as one ingredient.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tasty and alcoholic. And that's all you need to know,&quot; she said with an impish grin. &quot;Well..there is one <br />
other thing..&quot; She took the drinks out of my hands and put them back on the island. Suddenly her hand was on <br />
my crotch, and her eyes had faded slightly. She squeezed my immediately hard dick through my jeans as she <br />
pressed against me tightly and nipped my neck. &quot;Tonight..I look forward to finally seeing my alpha transform <br />
and FUCK me hard and totally claim me as his own true mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes turned back to their normal bright blue and she smiled in a faux-innocent way at me, the sparkle in <br />
her eyes letting me know that she was feeling rather mischievous. &quot;That's all,&quot; she said, sticking her tongue <br />
out playfully as she stuck a drink in either hand. She sashayed out of the kitchen, giving me another come-<br />
hither look over her shoulder and swinging her tight little ass rather theatrically to further tease me.<br />
<br />
We rejoined Meagan in the living room, where she'd stayed sitting on one of the leather couches, looking out <br />
the window. Veronica handed her the drink she carried, then took one of the two I held for herself. &quot;Welcome <br />
to the pack..to the family, officially,&quot; Veronica said, clinking her glass against Meagan's with a smile.<br />
<br />
Meagan smiled. &quot;Thanks..gosh..tonight's been so weird,&quot; she said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure it's been a bit much to take in,&quot; Veronica said sympathetically. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is..I'm sure it's going to take a bit of getting used to,&quot; Meagan said. &quot;MMmmmmm!&quot; she exclaimed as <br />
she sipped the drink. &quot;This is tasty, what's in it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A bit of this, and a bit of that,&quot; Veronica said, drinking her own. I finally tried a sip, and it was <br />
incredible; I could barely taste the alcohol or pinpoint the mix of fruit juices and liquors she'd used.<br />
<br />
&quot;So..umm, at the risk of asking a stupid question, how does this whole pack thing work?&quot; Meagan asked. She <br />
sounded rather embarrassed at even voicing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not a stupid question, sweetheart,&quot; Veronica said. &quot;I think either of us would rather you ask questions than <br />
act unknowingly.&quot; I nodded in agreement. No need for Meagan to know that I was curious exactly how packs <br />
worked as well. Meagan looked relieved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most packs range between five and seven members. Obviously, they grow as pack members have children, but <br />
usually there's a point where the pack will splinter off into two separate ones, or individual members move <br />
away or break off to form their own independent packs.”<br />
<br />
“So, if packs are family units, why do they split away from each other? Wouldn't a massive super-pack be safer <br />
and more powerful?” Meagan asked rather perceptively.<br />
<br />
“Well, yes and no. Packs are normally ruled by a mated pair,” Veronica said, “Like Joe and me. While the <br />
alphas may listen to advice or requests, they're not bound to anyone else's authority. A pack isn't really a <br />
democracy; it's a dictatorship. A benevolent dictatorship usually, but a dictatorship. But we're these <br />
incredibly powerful creatures, and arguments happen sometimes, and the fights can get ugly. Usually though, <br />
one wolf or two will split off, before things get fatal.”<br />
<br />
Meagan cocked her head to the side quizically. “So what do werewolves get into fights about?”<br />
<br />
“Dominance, usually,” Veronica told her, then paused again for a moment before adding, “Usually sex.” Veronica <br />
took a long drink before continuing. “Werewolves are very sexual creatures, Meagan. The transformation sets <br />
every nerve ending ablaze..and we succumb to passion very easily. Females, in particular, are prone to <br />
bisexuality.”<br />
<br />
“That's not an issue for me,” Meagan said, blushing again slightly, then gulping about half of her drink down. <br />
“I've always been into both guys and girls...probably a little more into girls than guys, if I'm being honest. <br />
That's why working in a strip club sounded like a great idea..I could see my share of naked girls and horny <br />
guys.” She giggled. “Gosh, that probably makes me sound even MORE like a whore..ughh..” She laughed and gulped <br />
the rest of her drink down. “But...yeah, I..go both ways, and well..I really like sex..”<br />
<br />
Veronica smiled. “And there's nothing to be ashamed about either of those things, though you're probably going <br />
to find your sexual hunger to be cranked up a few notches comparatively. It's totally normal. In fact, even <br />
lifetime lesbians have been known to start swinging toward males..and previously straight individuals almost <br />
universally slide bisexual. Males too,” she added, glancing at me. “It's because we end up being SO sensitive <br />
at least when the change is upon us that we..well, we simply can't stop ourselves, particularly during the <br />
full moon.”<br />
<br />
“So the full moon thing is true? I thought that was pure Hollywood,” Meagan said.<br />
<br />
“I'll explain after I grab you another drink,” Veronica told her. She hopped up and took Meagan's glass, <br />
returning a minute later with a freshly mixed drink.<br />
<br />
“You read my mind,” Meagan said with a grin as she immediately started to drink again, but this time, she <br />
slowly ran her tongue around the rim of the glass, pointedly staring at the two of us with a mildly lusty <br />
look.<br />
<br />
Veronica smiled at her, pointedly not avoiding Meagan's gaze. “The full moon does have the expected effect on <br />
us. While we can change at will with practice, we're rarely prevented from achieving the transformation if we <br />
have the means to trigger it. But the moon..when it's full, and shining in the sky, it forces us to change. <br />
It's overwhelming. We have no control. Some of us can hold it back if we're out of view of the moon..but the <br />
moment we see it, even the most experienced of us succumb to the change. And..it's even more intense than the <br />
change you felt earlier tonight.”<br />
<br />
Meagan's eyes widened. “R-Really?” One hand drifted to her chest and lightly rubbed her left nipple. She bit <br />
her bottom lip in a combination of nervousness and excitement. “That's..umm..got to feel overwhelming.”<br />
<br />
Veronica smiled and gave me another sidelong look from the corner of her eye, but remained largely focused on <br />
Meagan. “When you changed earlier..you grew about a foot, and you put on somewhere between fifty and seventy <br />
five pounds of pure muscle. The full moon emphasizes every bit of our animal side...you'll easily gain two <br />
feet, and two HUNDRED pounds of muscle. That happens to ALL of us. We become massive beasts, fully ruled by <br />
our animal natures until sunrise.”<br />
<br />
“Oh wow..” Meagan replied softly. She didn't even seem to notice she was now perpetually rubbing her chest and <br />
even teasing at her nipples lightly. My senses picked up the stronger smell of the wolf starting to emanate <br />
from her as she finished her second drink. Once again, Veronica smiled and got her another one.<br />
<br />
“I'm not sure I need another one of these,” Meagan said with a half giggle. “I'm starting to feel..weird. <br />
Like..good weird, but weird.” <br />
<br />
Veronica smiled a bit knowingly, but said nothing about it. “The other effect of the full moon is to usually <br />
cause us to entirely lose control of every inhibition as we transform and shortly thereafter. It's quite <br />
common for the male to take every female in his pack during the full moon.”<br />
<br />
I was a little surprised at that. I mean..yes, I would definitely have had sex with Meagan now that she was a <br />
werewolf, but Veronica seemed more than okay with it. Meagan looked more than a little shocked, however.<br />
<br />
“Uh, I thought he was your mate?” she asked.<br />
<br />
Veronica shook her head slightly as she finished her drink. “He is..but it's not the way you're thinking.” She <br />
got myself and her another drink, then returned again. My head was swimming already from the potent beverage, <br />
and I was starting to become acutely aware of a growing arousal on my part. Actually, that's putting it <br />
mildly. I was having a really hard time hiding my hard-on. I could smell both girls with overwhelming clarity, <br />
and it was becoming problematic.<br />
<br />
Veronica leaned against me and took one of my hands. She rubbed it against her cheek and kissed it, then <br />
snuggled against me and laid her head on my chest. “He IS my mate. He IS my one. He is the man that soothes my <br />
beast, and the beast that ravages my femininity. He is the one that will father my pups. He is the only one <br />
who will lay with me when I am in heat, and I am the only bitch that he will lay with while she is in heat. I <br />
will support him over all other wolves, and he will support me over all other wolves. We are mates for life, <br />
and will defend each other to the death, if need be.” <br />
<br />
A soft growl came out of my throat as I nuzzled the top of Veronica's head. It was a contented growl, one that <br />
encapsulated my warm feelings for her, and my possession of her, along with her possession of me. It was <br />
entirely unbidden and while it shocked me on some level, it felt entirely natural.<br />
<br />
Veronica kept her head on my chest and lazily ran her fingers along my thigh, even venturing further inward <br />
and rubbing my bulge, sending shivers up my spine. My heartbeat was starting to increase noticeably, and the <br />
room felt considerably warmer. Veronica sat up, smiling at me and laying a long kiss on my lips, and now slid <br />
a hand under my shirt, teasing my chest with her nails. I gulped down the rest of my drink after she broke the <br />
kiss. I was incredibly thirsty. Sweat beaded on my forehead. Meagan watched us, seemingly fascinated. <br />
<br />
“But we are sensual creatures as well,” Veronica said. “Sex in our world is many things. It is dominance. It <br />
is pleasure. It marks our bond, and it marks our claim on each other. Sex is not the same as mating, or being <br />
someone's mate. Do you understand?”<br />
<br />
Meagan's eyes were wide again, like they had been back at the club. Her drink was empty, and one hand rubbed <br />
her chest, while the other was scraping nails down the thigh of her pantleg. “Umm...uhh..y-yeah,” she replied.<br />
<br />
“While we both claimed you by word earlier, we have not claimed you by deed, Meagan,” Veronica said, her voice <br />
soft and hungry as she undid my pants and guided my cock out of my boxers. It didn't even strike me as odd <br />
that Veronica was teasing another girl with my dick, probably because she was slowly stroking it, making <br />
conscious thought very difficult. My heartbeat was through the roof, and my body burned with heat. I felt like <br />
I was running a fever of 105 degrees.<br />
<br />
“No..” Meagan said softly. “You..you..rrrrrrrr...” that soft croaking groan-growl of hers slipped out as she <br />
began to lose control. “You haven't..” <br />
<br />
Veronica smiled and slipped out of the robe, even as her hand kept stroking me. “Would you like us to claim <br />
you, Meagan? Would you like us to claim you with our bodies tonight?”</p>
