<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning began rather calmly, with Melissa shutting off her alarm and sitting up. She reflected on her dream over the night and looked to the bottle of werecow birth control pills that she&#39;d gotten. She had made her choice and figured that if Trevor was to be &quot;the one,&quot; she&#39;d have no trouble with it as he did make her happy and it wasn&#39;t like werecows were ugly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course no were is ugly,&quot; Melissa mused to herself and began to get ready for the day, &quot;and I&#39;d end up bigger no matter what kind of were I&#39;d become.&quot;<br />
<br />
She put on clean clothes before moving to head to the bathroom to do her hair. Though she also made sure that she had clothes laid out for later. She&#39;d want clean clothes for the date, even if it wasn&#39;t something fancy. After all, if she wore on the date what she wore to school and had some sort of stain from something at lunch, that stain would be there. And besides, she&#39;d need to come home after school to make some sandwiches anyway. So she figured she&#39;d come home, make sandwiches and snacks, shower, and get dressed and be ready for her date.<br />
<br />
She made her way into the bathroom and began to brush out her hair a bit. It was a bit tangled, likely from rolling over in the night as her subconscious mind wrestled with her choices. She did admit that a great deal of her reasons for choosing to become a werecow was Trevor. He was &quot;grade A boyfriend material&quot; and Melissa had found her growing love and attraction to him adding to the reasons her mind felt were the best reasons to be a werecow... their great strength in both males and females but yet still having a gentle nature that carried a great deal of kindness to it, the fact that there really weren&#39;t that many werecattle and that she didn&#39;t really want to choose a different were simply because there were more of them, and privately a part of her even liked the idea of being bigger. Now, granted she was only 15, but she&#39;d always been on the small side and being a werecow would let her see things from the larger end of the spectrum.<br />
<br />
&quot;But we are just starting to date,&quot; Melissa silently mused to herself as she brushed her hair and remembered her dream and her father&#39;s urging her to take her time since the fight had resulted in him becoming the Jenkins family were. &quot;If things don&#39;t work out... then maybe a different choice would be better.&quot;<br />
<br />
And that did make some sense. She&#39;d talk to Trevor about her dream on the date, but she was fairly certain he&#39;d be thrilled at being the were to turn her if he was sure that she was sure in her choice. But they were just starting to date, and it wasn&#39;t like she could look thirty years into the future and see how she and Trevor turn out as a couple. If she rushed into it and things didn&#39;t work out between her and Trevor, things could be awkward and the prime reason she had for being a werecow wouldn&#39;t work with her anymore, though Melissa found herself shuddering at the idea of things not working out with Trevor. <br />
<br />
After all, while so much of Moon Lake was so different and &quot;weird&quot; from an outside perspective, Trevor had seemed to make things safe and happy for her. Even while she had been starting to go over her choices for what were to be, the one thing her mind had definitely made itself up on, was Trevor. She wanted things work out between them and that regardless of what were she became, she wanted to date him.<br />
<br />
&quot;And now I have my chance,&quot; Melissa mused as she finished brushing her hair and came out of the bathroom to find her father coming up the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;The chance for what?&quot; Harold asked her.<br />
<br />
Melissa stopped suddenly and blinked, wondering if she&#39;d actually said that out loud.<br />
<br />
&quot;The chance for happiness in dating and heading toward a &quot;happy ever after,&quot; like the way you and Mom had in Michigan,&quot; Melissa said to him after she recovered, &quot;and hopefully like you and Virginia will have here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold gave a friendly smile down to his daughter. A part of him did privately think things were working out fairly well for both of them. It wasn&#39;t quite the way he expected in that he never figured he&#39;d be living in a town full of were-beasts, let alone that he would become one, but it was a new start and had some hope in it. He actually felt rather good in his were form and in his night-time exploring he&#39;d found a couple places that he thought would be a nice place to take Virginia, provided she was cleared of any and all wrongdoing. And while he would do his best to protect Melissa, he did have to admit that she and Trevor DID look rather cute snuggled together on the couch and Trevor had been very helpful in getting their home set up.  In that, Harold felt Trevor did make for a good first real boyfriend for Melissa.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d had friends back in Michigan and there were a couple of boys that she had hung out with from time to time, but things had never gotten beyond platonic friendship with them, or at least as far as Harold had figured. But now, as a weretiger and having the mental sense that in Heaven, Eliza Jenkins approved of Virginia McCoy, Harold actually began to realize just how badly he&#39;d been mourning Eliza&#39;s death. In many ways, he realized that there was a fair amount that he might have missed with regards to Melissa&#39;s wants and interests. Thankfully, things seemed to be working out well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I have breakfast ready for you,&quot; Harold gave a smile, &quot;can&#39;t have a &quot;happy ever after&quot; on an empty stomach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe... but I can look forward to it,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember to be responsible,&quot; Harold spoke to her, &quot;and remember that I don&#39;t want to get phone calls from your teachers saying you&#39;re neglecting your studies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will, dad, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Melissa replied and moved downstairs to get breakfast.<br />
<br />
She went down the stairs with some confidence and was quite eager to get through the day and get to her date. There were some questions and she could even suppose them to be second guesses regarding her choices, but that was probably due to the fact that she didn&#39;t know the future and how things would work out. If Trevor truly was &quot;the one&quot; her choice to be a werecow would have no difficulties and she could be sure to have a happy life with Trevor, but since they were only just getting started with regard to dating there was no need to rush things. She would keep her pills with her, as she couldn&#39;t know on how things would develop, but for the moment that wasn&#39;t exactly in the plan for the evening...<br />
<br />
After all, there was time to make sure Trevor was &quot;the one&quot; and make sure that moment was a romantic one and that both of them were sure in their choice of mate.</p>
