<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At that moment Molly sneezed making her overly graced chest shudder and Mr. Fran too! Seeing even her dull mind that a bookstore dealing in old and rare books the word rare had to do with out of print, not as if naked.<br />
<br />
Aspin around on her high heels and with a wild wiggle to her butt she stepped quickly out of the shop.<br />
<br />
Mr. Fran stood there gawking just long enough for Mrs. Fran to catch him dreaming of his last customer.<br />
<br />
A wack to the back of his bald head brought the aged but not dead yet man back to his present reality.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes dear, I'm just thinking!&quot; said Mr. Fran as he turned to smile at his wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thinking maybe, but of what and who?&quot; chimed the wife back, knowing herself of his long sorted past, and the few times he got out of line.<br />
<br />
Picking up the Tome Mr. Fran took the volume to his actual study found in an old broom closet way to the rear of his store. There he would later inspect the find and see if he'd made a fool of himself.<br />
<br />
7:30, the evening news over and his family book store closed up tight for the night. Now was as good a time as any to check over his purchase.<br />
<br />
Like Doctor Phil did so also Mr. Fran began by opening the first page of this massive old book. Seeing it had something to do with the occult and maybe even magic he was careful not to speak what he read aloud.<br />
<br />
Taking note to pencil notes on some pages he had no way of knowing it was the doctor who wrote them as he delved threw the spells and incantations. As he paged through the volume he took a mental note that the markings stopped at one page and from there he saw not a one more.<br />
<br />
Figuring that the last owner of the book used the spell he too gave it a good lookover. Small writings in open spaces led him to know the last owner was his bowling friend, Dr. Phil. The locally known fact of the good doctor's recent dissappearance now had some light shed on what may have happened.<br />
<br />
Making a note of the ten days marked in one open spot he looked at the calander. Quickly he made a telephone call to Molly's Maid Service as he had some questions for Molly.<br />
<br />
Not able to explain why he was asking her about the doctor, Mr. Fran wanted to know when was her last contact with the Doc? She told him of it being better than three weeks past and then it was a paper and pencil written note. Asking if she still had the note she dug into one of her aprons and rattled it at the phone.<br />
<br />
Asked to read the note she said, &quot;Molly I will be out of touch for a short while. I have written you a check for cleaning this month and expect to be home in ten days or so. Now please do not touch anything you don't know about or understand, just dust and sweep as usual. It was signed and had her monthly check with it,&quot; said Molly.<br />
<br />
Some things were beginning to make some sense but if he used the spell, then where did he go off to? He thought and then remembered the odd situation of the Doc's three cows. A short hunt through back issued of the Town Crier, the once a week paper they had there in town.<br />
<br />
Finding the issue he read about the rescue of three lost Hereford cattle making a mess of doctor Phil's front lawn. Sitting back he thought of how funny the situation was and seeing the photo of Dr. Phil's small cottage home there seemed to be something wrong.<br />
<br />
Now he began a real search for a photo taken by him at the Doc's retirement party two years back.<br />
<br />
&quot;There, yes got it! Wow!&quot; said Mr. Fran.<br />
<br />
There he was next to his friend standing at the end of his dinning room table the cake and its candles lighting the picture enough to make it good. Behind the two of them was that special bay window the Doc had installed just a few years back. As mr. Fran peered through a magifier glass the shape of a large two story home presented itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no home next door to Doc's?&quot; said Mr. Fran as he gaped at the photo.<br />
<br />
As he would learn that even spells and incantations are not totally infallible. as with the spell which changed Jonus and then his parents it wiped away all evidence of them being alive with one proviso. It seemed that photographs were not invented when the Tome of Possibilities was first put in print. Therefore what it could change was present and future events leaving the not so distant past as yet unscared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever happened to Doc also had something to do with his next door neighbors vanishing too!&quot; thought as he reasoned said Mr. Fran.<br />
<br />
A week later Mr.Fran had in hand the address of the farm which recieved the three cattle found on Doc's front lawn. He also got a copy of the S.P.C.A.'s bill of ladding for sending a pure bred Aberdeen Angus bull found on the same street a few days later to Tiffin, Iowa and a breeding farm.<br />
<br />
By now even Mrs. Fran could see her husband was up to something, their town was a buzz with wonder.<br />
<br />
A drive out to the local farm which recieved the three cattle proved to establish an idea firmly in Mr. Fran's mind. He discovered that of the three brought that one day the large steer had been sent to market and no doubt was by then maybe slaughtered. Like the Doctor had asked Mr. Fran wanted to see the two others, a bull and one scared big cow.<br />
<br />
This time the farm's owner brought the cow into the main barn and had the bull taken to a corral.<br />
<br />
Asking for privacy Mr. Fran saw a smirk come over the farmer's face but being he had been paid for this service he left straight-a-way.<br />
<br />
Questioning a cow had to be the most stupid thing he's ever tried to do. Yet as he posted his questions the cow either gave a nod for yes or a shake of the head for a no. This really had mr. Fran baffled about what might have occured.<br />
<br />
Guessing mind you he began to understand some of the puzzle. After trying to talk with the exhuman father now bull, Mr. Fran realized that his lusty ways had degraded his mental ability to that not much higher than a real bull. Now he returned home and began to phone the Double G ranch in Tiffin, Iowa.<br />
<br />
A nice soft spoken man answered the phone and recieved Mr. Fran's many odd questions with a midwestern considerate bit of good manners.<br />
<br />
Told of how mild mannered the big black bull was from his first day there and to the present, it was considered rather uncanny. The time when some stranger was seen in the barn and then they found Ferdinand laying out cold in the pasture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ferdinand?&quot; asked Mr. Fran.<br />
<br />
The farm owner told of his young daughter reading a story about Ferdinand the black bull and since their newest bull was also black of colour they decided to call it that as well.<br />
<br />
Later as Mr. Fran sat thinking in his study the likeliness of this all being caused from the Tome was becoming alarmingly real.<br />
<br />
Making a test of things Mr. Fran put the tome inside his old woody Ford station-wagon, and making up a story about going to a book sale, his wife relented allowing the man his time alone.<br />
<br />
Driving a distance on just one hundred miles from town Mr. Fran set up his test by night. Parking the woody in a side dirt road he left open the tailgate with the Tome laid open to the spell and page in question.<br />
<br />
Standing behind his old wagon he read aloud the spell adding to it the prefered wording he'd like rather than what maybe Doc had tried. Everything was the same with one exception and that Mr. Fran was quite careful to spell and speak correctly.<br />
<br />
The space which might specify allotted time he spoke as forty eight hours. Then where if reffered to being the man had many second thoughts but settled for to try the word Jackass.<br />
<br />
No sooner the speel was said and he began to feel very odd. His head ached but not too bad as shoulders and arms began to twitch. <br />
<br />
Standing away from his vehicle he quickly disrobed and tried his best to climb over a four rail high white board fence. It was maybe the painful agony of dragging a Jackass' sheath and testicles over the top rail that tuned him into what was happening.<br />
<br />
Coarse hairs sprouted like mad as he felt bones shifting, and worse things growing. Ears, a tail, and his maleness being old for a man got bigger and more supple as if that of a two year old Jackass stud.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the sight and seeing of his old time car was something he would rather not even squint to see. Turning instead he found himself standing like a jackass and walking about this was something to behold.<br />
<br />
Couching he soon brayed like a true jackass, Mr. Fran was feeling hisoats and with the rank scent of donkeys on the breeze he lit off on the gallop.</p>
