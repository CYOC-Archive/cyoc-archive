<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie attempted to adjust her shredded swimsuit. &quot;I think new swimwear would be a perfect idea,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Then its settled,&quot; Kellie exclaimed. &quot;Lets go,&quot; The girls payed fro their drinks and began walking toward the swimwear ship. Katie dragged behind not only because of the fear of her swimsuit completely falling apart but to get a better look at her handiwork.<br />
<br />
The outfits the formerly elderly women wore now seemed a little loose around the waist and stomach. Mary Elise&#39;s sundress and Samantha&#39;s one piece were very loose around the waist but their perkier breasts compensated so that their outfits didn&#39;t seem patently ridiculous. Claudia and Mika had actually regained some weight in their transformation. No longer frail old women the two had young and trim bodies. Claudia&#39;s beach robe and Mika&#39;s flowing beach dress however did not look right on the bodies of two gorgeous women. Tricia had undergone the most changes. The formerly obese woman was now a curvaceous beauty whose moo moo now hung on her like a sack. Katie thought about what a continued regression would do to the woman but shook the thought from her mind. &quot;I&#39;ll have time later for that,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
As the seven young women entered the boutique Katie was impressed with what she saw. The shop was not merely a place for swimwear but had summer and spring outfits as well. Cute tops, dresses, skirts, and bikinis lined the walls along with an assortment of sportswear appropriate for the beach. &quot;This place is perfect,&quot; Katie thought. &quot;I can get some new outfits and talk the others into some new outfits as well. Plus grab some other things in case i want to change things up.&quot; The women quickly spread out throughout the store examining everything on the shelves. <br />
<br />
Katie slowly walked over to the counter where a woman in her forties was manning the counter. &quot;Welcome to my shop,&quot; she said. &quot;My names Angela what can I help you with today?&quot; Katie smiled and looked at Angela. Angela was a 42 year old surfer with short brown hair and a deep tan. While still attractive her many years of sun and surf had taken their toll on her skin giving her a weathered look.<br />
<br />
&quot;This place is amazing,&quot; Katie said in awe. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize you had such a wide selection in stock.&quot; &quot;Thanks,&quot; Angela stated happily. &quot;If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned being around the beach my whole life its that sometimes people want more than just swimsuits. It pays to to have a broad selection in stock, help yourself to what you want. I&#39;ll be hear to ring you up when your done.&quot; Katie smiled  and began going through the wide selection outfits available in the store.<br />
<br />
Katie and the rest of the women spent the next 90 minutes trying on outfits and swimsuits trying to decide what would look best on them. Katie convinced them to not only buy new swimsuits and other clothes as well. The women agreed and approached the register with armfuls of clothes. Kellie, Mary Elise, Claudia, Mika, Tricia and Samantha all sported bikinis now and carried armfuls of clothes. Katie had decided on a bikini as well but had thrown on a stylish top, cut off shorts and canvas sneakers as a cover up. Angela&#39;s eyes glinted with joy as the group approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow that&#39;s a heck of a selection you got there,&quot; she stated as she rung everything up. &quot;Your total comes to $3,462.68.&quot;  &quot;Holy Crap,&quot; Claudia exclaimed. &quot;That&#39;s gonna max out my credit card.&quot; :Maybe we should put some of this stuff back,&quot; Samantha added. &quot;No way,&quot; Mika exclaimed. &quot;These outfits are totally cute on me.&quot; The group began to bicker about the price and possibly putting some of there purchases back. &quot;Sorry girls my prices are  not negotiable.&quot; Angela stated glowering at women. &quot;If you can&#39;t afford it try the Goodwill.&quot;<br />
<br />
Claudia and Tricia did not take to Angela&#39;s condescending tone and were about to say something before Katie stepped forward. &quot;Hey girls leave the clothes here I&#39;ll handle this.&quot; The other women stepped outside leaving Katie and Angela alone. &quot;Hope you&#39;ve got the money for this,&quot; Angela threatened. &quot;I&#39;ve got better things to do than waste my time with a bunch of broke college girls.&quot; &quot;College graduates,&quot; Katie corrected. &quot;I&#39;m going to pay you Angela but not that much.&quot; Angela folded her arms across her chest and stared the girl in front of her. &quot;I don&#39;t know what your game is kid but I&#39;m not buying it.&quot; Katie smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t know who you think you are little girl but I&#39;m definitely older than you.&quot; With that Katie&#39;s ring began to glow.<br />
<br />
The changes to Angela were more rapid that previous regressions. As Angela entered her 30&#39;s her skin brightened and the lines around her eyes vanished. She remained oblivious to the changes as she entered her 20&#39;s. Her body toned and the weathered look she had vanished completely. Now an athletic beach beauty with perfectly tanned skin, a cute face and short brown hair that made her look younger than she actually was. Quickly Angela left her 20&#39;s and re entered her teenage years. The athletic build she had prided herself on began to melt away along with a couple of inches of height. Katie decided to stop Angela&#39;s  at 15 and looked at the young teen. <br />
<br />
Angela had a very innocent and youthful face now that made her look closer to 13 than 15. The muscle she had from a lifetime of athletics had faded giving her a skinny look. Her breasts, which had been modest b cups had been reduced to a pair of perky a&#39;s. The girl adjusted her ill fitting clothes and looked up at the older girl in front of her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry ma&#39;am,&quot; the girl stammered. &quot;but there&#39;s nothing I can do about the cost. Maybe you could put this stuff on layaway or something.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ve got a better idea.&quot; Katie smiled as the ring began to glow. <br />
<br />
Angela&#39;s regression was much faster now as she left her teenage years behind. Now only 12 all traces of puberty had left the girl leaving her a skinny preteen. As Angela went from 10 to 9 her athletic shorts slid off her narrow waist and pooled around her canvas sneakers. The now 8 year old noticed this  and stepped out of her shorts leaving her canvas sneakers and socks behind. The 7 year old now dressed only in an over sized t-shirt was beginning to have trouble looking over the counter. As she went from 7 to 6 she was forced to stand on tip toes to be able to see over the counter. When she became 5 she abandoned trying to stand on her toes and looked up at the large woman in front of her. Katie halted the girls regression at 4 and looked down at her.<br />
<br />
The preschooler looked around at her unfamiliar surroundings and was frightened. She didn&#39;t know this place and only wanted to see her mom. Her lip began to quiver and tears began to form in her eyes. Katie felt pity for the tiny little girl and beckoned her to come around the counter. &quot;It&#39;s okay sweety you don&#39;t need to cry.&quot; &quot;Where&#39;s my mom,&quot; Angela cried. &quot;I want my mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;ll be here soon,&quot; Katie soothed. &quot;Can you tell me how old you are?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m 4&quot; Angela squeaked holding up four small fingers. &quot;Such a big girl,&quot; Katie soothed. &quot;tell you what since her such a big girl I&#39;ve got a present for you.&quot; Katie reached into her bag and after some searching found what she was looking. &quot;I want you to have this doll,&quot; Katie said as she gave Angela an old doll of hers. &quot;Really,&quot; Angela squealed. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Little Angela took the doll and began to play on the floor. Katie took this distraction and eliminated the purchase from the register. So that Angela would never know. Before finally leaving Katie slipped a couple of hundred dollars into the register to to make up for the clothes they were about to take. As she was about to leave with her purchase she turned back towards Angela.<br />
<br />
&quot;Angie dear have you ever wanted to be a big girl,&quot; &quot;Yeah,&#39;&#39; Angela exclaimed. &quot;Today&#39;s your lucky day Angie close your eyes and make a wish.&quot; As Angela closed her eyes Katie wished for the girl to be 18 again. Quickly gathering her things Katie left the boutique and joined her friends leaving a half naked and confused 18 year old inside. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you get all that stuff,&quot; Kellie exclaimed. &quot;That woman seemed real pissed.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry everything&#39;s going to work out fine lets go enjoy the rest of the day.&quot; Kellie gave her sister a puzzled look and shrugged. Katie could only smile her adventures were just beginning.</p>
