<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;John Bedford, in the flesh, standing there before me, just on the opposite side of the petting zoo fence!&quot; I thought, and not having seen what was previous to being a donkey, was in fact as me, he had my body, and I was inside his equine self.<br />
<br />
Karen knew him too, she gained knowledge of him from me, and went to confront him, a bold move that added her into the animal kingdom though a physical transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would bet you never expected to see this body ever again, I&#39;d bet, make you a bet!<br />
<br />
And for you there so bold so dumb, as how you ended up becoming a sheep, and a transgender to being a Ram, as golly you got big balls!<br />
<br />
Either of you any good sex lately, I would make bet you both are as horny as a animal could get.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen accepted his bet, as she bold as ever then scrawled in the pen dirt, &quot;WRONG - BRED 172 EWES X 3 EACH - LAST SPRING.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; John said, &quot;As imagine that,&quot; John reached his right hand inside his shirt pocket to retrieve, and hold before us the silver with gold inlays, the accursed Medallion what began for me and so unfortunate for Karen or lives changed to being as animals. Bold as brass, John held the Medallion but two feet distance from my donkey muzzle.<br />
<br />
My reaction time when swatting flies using my tail, a kill one out of three most every time. As I stared at the one item in the world what could do for me a reprieve from living my life time being donkey, that Medallion was the key. So I thrust forward with my donkey head, my muzzle open as was my mouth, as hoped to grab the Medallion with my teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there,&quot; John yelped, as my lips came into contact with touching the Medallion. John withdrew the Medallion in a quick responsive action, as if he planned to slip it back, inside his shirt pocket.  What happened was the two finger-knuckled grip he had on the Medallion was not stout enough for him to retain his grasp of it, and the magical bobble flew from his grasp into the air.<br />
<br />
Karen, was perfectly prepared, I suspect by sheer chance, as the Medallion sailed though air and space, it fell to where she with her muzzle, lips and teeth grabbed it with her sheep jaw. The Medallion held in her teeth and Karen bolted for the far side of the petting pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there you damned beast,&quot; John yelled, as said it loud enough to get noticed by several guests and the petting zoo cashier. John dashed around the petting pen fence, as trying to chase but not able to catch Karen, as there was a six foot high fence between us and those outside the protective barrier. Karen then ran to the center of the pen where she meeting me, she transferred the Medallion to me, and carefully transferred into my mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help, hey anybody help, oh ah yes, as by chance a valued silver coin fell from my pocket and the sheep retrieved it, as I want it back!&quot; John said as he complained to the zoo cashier, and she in turn called for Ben to come from him cleaning and busing tables to come quick.<br />
<br />
The petting pen is wide as it is long, and allowed Karen to transfer the Medallion to me, without anyone there, even of John to take note.<br />
<br />
When Ben arrived he entered the petting pen and calling, beckoned the Ram sheep to come. Karen obey dutifully, and when Ben pried her mouth open, he found to silver coin; just gooey sheep saliva.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, nothing,&quot; John exclaimed, as turned and pointed toward me, as made himself look more foolish, he said, &quot;Then he has it!&quot;<br />
<br />
As indeed I did, as with my tongue had worked the Medallion to set between my back molders and the skin of my cheek, where it slid down and set quite snug.<br />
<br />
Ben walked across the pen and as I saw him coming, I played dumb and strolled slowly to the watering trough as began to drink . As Ben arrived he was careful not to lose his fingers by probing inside the mouth of an equine. As if being willing to do what my kind caretaker might want me to do, I opened wide my mouth and shot forth a loud bray.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; said Ben with a shrugging of his shoulders, &quot;As if he had it, he swallowed it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cut him open, and do it right now!&quot; John angry as worried said, as his demand caused a woman to scream and two men to step forward and restrain John from any rash acts, like maybe if he had a gun, he would shoot me dead. The restaurant and petting zoo was in a massive turmoil, or not that John cared, as he had lost something of value to more than him.<br />
<br />
Ben then said, &quot;Please sir calm down, as if either swallowed the coin, give it three days and I should find it lying about, and I shall wash it, now do you have a phone number where you can be reached?&quot;<br />
<br />
Angry, scared, begrudgingly he offer Ben a business card with way of how he could be informed.<br />
<br />
After John took off in a hale of dust, screech tires, and black rubber marks on the parking lot, Karen came close to me and scrawled, &quot;YOU GOT IT.&quot;<br />
<br />
As I replied, &quot;YUP - IN MY CHEEK.&quot;<br />
<br />
The remainder of our day was calm and somewhat fun. When Ben bedded Karen with me in our box stall, he looked at me, and me at him, &quot;I&#39;d make a bet that you took it from the ram!&quot;<br />
<br />
To hearing Ben as make a bet was to the Medallion of a human making a wish, and wishing was what got me to being a donkey, foolish a wish that it was for me. I backed away, what drew Ben to want to look inside my mouth. I tried to side step his approaching me, but the stall was far smaller a space than the petting pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, you donkey, living the life, as maybe horny, but never working, content with what you are as have. Come here, quit your dodging me, please, oh come..., darn missed you again, I&#39;d bet if I were a jennet donkey you&#39;d come to me... OUCH!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was like a bolt of lightning, as I staggered back and tripped, I fell on my butt. &quot;Hey, hey, Karen do you see, oh Ben, I am sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
What I never thought could happen, happened, as Ben in chasing after me in the stall, he began to fantasize, and betting, turned his imagination to making a wish. A wish what caused the Medallion in my mouth to react. Just as it had happened before with me, it did again between me the donkey and Ben the human.<br />
<br />
I stood up and began feeling of my human self, or of what was Ben&#39;s self and body.<br />
<br />
Ben then the donkey began jumping, bucking, swinging his tail, kicking up his hind legs and shaking his head all as violently done.<br />
<br />
Karen shied away lest she get kicked or tromped on, being shorter.<br />
<br />
As with shaking his donkey head, from out his mouth the Medallion was flung into the air, and by luck, I caught it.<br />
<br />
Ben then as my donkey self, he calmed quickly and looking at me for a minute, he stepped up close and pressed his donkey face snug to my chest. &quot;I am sorry, as I shall try to find a way to return you to this body, gee, I am sorry!&quot; I told Ben, as he was but just graduated high school, maybe 18 or 19 years of age. As when I traded bodies with the donkey I was in my fifties.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a sad situation,&quot; I said, as then Ben bolted past me and ran from the barn to the petting pen.<br />
<br />
Karen followed her donkey as I chased after the two of my best friends.<br />
<br />
Ben stood calm as if happy, he then with his left fore hoof did scrawl in the pen dirt, &quot;OK - SAW YOU AND SHEEP WRITING - GLADLY - ACCEPT - MY BEING - A DONKEY.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;You like or wanted to be a donkey?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ben wrote, &quot;YES - THANK YOU - EVEN IF BY CHANCE.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;To let you know, as much the Ram would inform you, her name is Karen, and she has a story worse than is mine. Now, let me then bed you two down for the night, and in the morning I will begin working you job!&quot; I said, as Ben did a head nod, as Karen began making sad Maa..., cries.</p>
