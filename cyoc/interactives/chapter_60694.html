<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waiting with the wardens took awhile for animal control to arrive and remove the animal that the two ranchers had shot and the live animals they had in a corral closer to their ranch house. It was cool, but I was able to tolerate it. We were fortunate not to have many animals coming to investigate the dead cow. Most of them were ravens and crows, and the largest was a coyote. They however, kept their distance when then noticed me standing guard over the carcass.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe someone would do this,&quot; the first warden commented, &quot;I got an uncle who is into ranching. He would never just kill one of his cattle out in the field. I think he had to once, but it was because the animal was sick with something that could have taken the whole herd. I don't understand why someone would do this. His goal should have been to keep this animal alive to sell to market.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My presence may be the reason for that,&quot; I sighed, &quot;ultimately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; the second warden.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the ranchers in this area has a grudge against my wife and I because we won't do what he says,&quot; I explained, &quot;and so, he's organizing all his friends and people he has influence over into a small hate group called R.A.M., Ranchers Against Molly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly?&quot; the first warden asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My wife's name,&quot; I sighed, &quot;she was the only tiger person at the time when the group got its name. And the rancher hates my wife and I with a passion. He likely paid those two to do this to create a situation where I or Molly could be framed for the attack... and most likely Molly... and then we could be legally done away with.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two game wardens looked at me curiously. I half wondered why. All I had was my own suspicions, but with no proof, I couldn't act on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Molly?&quot; the second asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because Officer Howard has remained in my corner through the problems they've thrown at us, while the school district's superintendent has sided with the rancher,&quot; I explained, &quot;and Molly is working as an aide in the local elementary... or pre-school. The teacher she is with there supports her, but the school principal and the district superintendent are against her. If these two had succeeded, any legal accusation against me wouldn't go, because the witnesses wouldn't bend. But the principal and the superintendent would not hesitate to lie and say that Molly didn't come straight in, attacked the cattle and then returned, and then fired her accordingly to allow her to be arrested...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if the teacher tried to defend her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They'd flat out tell the judge that the teacher was lying,&quot; I answered, &quot;this rancher has decided what he wants, and will not rest until he gets it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't believe this,&quot; the first warden gasped, &quot;this conspiracy of yours is far to fantastic to believe! Someone would actually orchestrate something as complex as this to get rid of two tigers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simply shooting us was made illegal,&quot; I answered, &quot;not without just cause, which Molly and I haven't given them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Neither warden answered as animal control arrived with a trailer to take on the dead cow.<br />
<br />
&quot;And much of it is true,&quot; I sighed, &quot;even if you can't believe it... but a lot of this is merely suspicion and resentment against their mistreatment on my part... so unless I come across proof in a legal manner, my hands are tied.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As they should be,&quot; the second warden commented, &quot;if you're law enforcement, you can't just violate the law to deal with bad guys...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not to mention that there is no law against hatred,&quot; the first warden answered.<br />
<br />
I could only nodded and we then began helping the animal control officers load the dead cow. In terms of moving it, that is where I came in handy. The cow was rolled onto a tarp, and I held onto two corners and pulled while they pushed. Once it was on the trailer, I managed to move it all the way to the back fairly easily. This left the animal control officers amazed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We could use more of you, if you're that strong,&quot; the female animal control officer answered, leaving me to chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad to have been of help,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you have our thanks,&quot; the animal control officer answered, &quot;but I think we can get the live cattle easily... and I think your partner was coming in behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and let them go about their work. The area was secure and the two ranchers were arrested. The two wardens were also on their way back to the driveway where there SUV was parked. When we made it back we found another trailer parked and the live cattle being loaded into it. The truck pulling the trailer that we had loaded the dead cow into soon moved to park alongside it. A gate inside the trailer was closed to prevent any cows from messing with the dead animal. I then slowly approached Officer Barnes while the two wardens left, as they had nothing really to do. There was no animal, and the whole thing had been a hoax.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do we stay to make sure there's no problems? Or...&quot; I wondered to Officer Barnes when I reached him.<br />
<br />
He looked over to the front door where the warrant for the animals was now tapped to the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Orders are to monitor things,&quot; Officer Barnes sighed, &quot;then we return to the station and see what the two ranchers have to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, &quot;you read them their rights before we took them to the car, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that's what we're supposed to do,&quot; Officer Barnes commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then here might be their warning of R.A.M.'s activity,&quot; I answered, &quot;the older one said that I wouldn't get away with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The law wouldn't get away with this?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is what he said,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was thirty minutes later when Officer Barnes and I returned to the station. We found Officer Howard waiting for us.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are things going?&quot; Officer Howard asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Animal control has seized the cattle and is taking them to a holding facility,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;they expect to have a civil suit for the custody of the animals in about a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The two wardens dropped off the photos of the cow,&quot; Officer Howard spoke, &quot;it was definitely shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes and I nodded, while Officer Howard lead us to the interrogation room.<br />
<br />
&quot;They've made their one phone call,&quot; Officer Howard spoke, &quot;I don't know who it was to, but from what I could overhear, it didn't sound like they were talking to a lawyer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll see what they have to say, sir,&quot; Officer Barnes answered and opened the door to interrogation room.<br />
<br />
We then went in to find both men seated at the table. They eyed both of us, but their faces betrayed anything but guilt. It seemed to me that they were not ashamed of what they had done.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, hello again,&quot; Officer Barnes began, &quot;I don't suppose you're willing to answer a few questions? Or will you want us to get you a lawyer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We got nothing to say to you,&quot; the younger man answered, &quot;what you're doing is wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What we're doing?&quot; Officer Barnes asked, &quot;my partner and I are enforcing the law. How is that wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you break the law of the jungle, that's when you're wrong,&quot; the older rancher grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the law of the jungle, I have full right to eat the both of you,&quot; I commented, &quot;the law of the jungle is survival of the fittest, and I can tell you now, that I am stronger then the both of you combined.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're an animal,&quot; the old man shot back.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it is to animals that the law of the jungle applies,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;sentient beings live by a different set of laws, now will you answer some questions or are you waiting for a lawyer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can wait for a lawyer,&quot; the old man growled.<br />
<br />
I could only sighed, &quot;do we need to contact one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One is already on his way,&quot; the younger man answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You called him?&quot; Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; the younger man admitted, before being elbowed by the older man, &quot;I mean, yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked at Officer Barnes and then sighed, &quot;then we'll be seeing you when your lawyer arrives.&quot;<br />
<br />
We then left to see Officer Howard, standing by.<br />
<br />
&quot;They won't do anything until they get their lawyer,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;despite the fact that neither of them called a lawyer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we need to provide them with a lawyer,&quot; Officer Howard sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;They said one is already on his way,&quot; I answered, &quot;It would lend to R.A.M. involvement in this. Maybe not in planning it, but they clearly support what these two have done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what makes you think he called Beauregard?&quot; Officer Howard questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who else would you call and get a lawyer without calling a lawyer?&quot; I asked back, &quot;most business owners won't provide an attorney to a criminal, even if their friends. Beauregard has already made his intentions clear when it comes to Molly and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes slowly nodded, &quot;there might be some logic in that, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I never thought something like this would ever happen,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;we're going to have to open a case on R.A.M. and Beauregard to monitor these things. We can't arrest him for racism, but if we can probe into some things... maybe we can get evidence of this conspiracy of yours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt they'd actually implicate the organization,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and to be honest, I don't necessarily want proof of conspiracy. I want them to treat Molly and I with respect. Like they would anyone else. Though maybe with these small things, it'll make it too expensive to keep their hate going.&quot;<br />
<br />
The others nodded.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was nearly twenty minutes before the attorney arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jason Regus, attorney at law,&quot; the man answered, &quot;I understand you have arrested two individuals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, on falsely accusing an officer of killing a cow and wasting police time, and on cruelty to animals,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;we HAVE the evidence to prove their guilt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll need to double check that,&quot; Jason answered, &quot;but we had best begin now. I have a very busy schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
We then made our way back in while Jason moved to sit beside the two ranchers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your lawyer has arrived,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;are you ready to answer some questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They will answer any questions that do not implicate them in anyway,&quot; Jason spoke, &quot;You may ask them when they saw the tiger, how the tiger killed their cattle, and their efforts to try and protect their livelihood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir, there was no tiger there,&quot; I answered, &quot;the prints weren't deep enough in the snow to indicate that a tiger was there, and the wounds the animal suffered were not made by any &quot;animal&quot;. The cow was shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes then pulled a small folder up to show the lawyer which contained copies of the photos taken by the wardens.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we have photographic evidence of this,&quot; Officer Barnes added, &quot;clearly gunshot wounds. And the area where the attack occurred also indicates that the cow was shot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your partner could have used his gun in the attack on the cattle,&quot; Jason dismissed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A handgun does not have the ballistic strength to fire a round clear through the cow's neck,&quot; Officer Barnes countered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I'm not that good a shot that I could hit the same hole multiple times,&quot; I added.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there is also the fact that they directly accused my partner of the act, when he had been with me the entire morning,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;He did the deed before he went in to work,&quot; Jason dismissed it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not according to the call we got,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;when the call was made, we were told the attack was ongoing while the call was made. My partner could not have been the attacker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;His wife then,&quot; Jason answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;The size of the prints there were too large to be hers,&quot; I answered, &quot;and even if they were, the prints didn't sink in deep enough for it to be a three hundred ninety pound tigress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason gave both of us a sour look. It appeared that Regus's job was to reiterate their accusations and was looking for holes in the evidence that we had. As we challenged his attempted efforts to free them and presented the evidence that we had, which was convincing, he looked frustrated, like he would be in for a tough legal fight. But, he seemed to stick with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn she's fat,&quot; the younger rancher taunted.<br />
<br />
I growled back at him, &quot;her weight is MUSCLE. She is easily stronger then you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason then motioned for the younger man to sit back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would advise against name-calling,&quot; he whispered in a low voice, hoping I wouldn't hear, but I could, &quot;their evidence IS convincing and not every judge is part of RAM. And this case will likely go to Kalispell for the actual hearings if it goes to trial. We need to keep this business like until Beauregard can buy off the judge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime,&quot; Officer Barnes asked, &quot;I don't suppose we could inquire as to why you shot your own cattle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My clients will not answer any questions that may implicate them,&quot; Jason answered, &quot;You may stick to what they know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well, we'll see you at the trial,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well,&quot; Jason sighed, and turned to both of the ranchers, &quot;come with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They stay here,&quot; I growled.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? For animal cruelty charges?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And falsely accusing an officer,&quot; Officer Barnes spoke, &quot;until they see a judge and post bail, they stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason then looked down and sighed, &quot;May I have the copies of the evidence to review?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
Jason Regus then departed and we took the two ranchers to a cell for the night. Once that was done, and Officer Barnes and I finally got to go for a lunch break, the &quot;trials&quot; of the day began to wind down.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do have some proof of R.A.M. criminal activity,&quot; I commented as we made our way out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The lawyer whispered something about trying to remain business like,&quot; I nodded, &quot;he admitted to the two of them that our evidence is convincing. He wanted them to avoid making trouble until Beauregard can buy off the judge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bribe a judge?!&quot; Officer Barnes gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what he whispered,&quot; I answered, &quot;though if it's a judge he's friendly with, it'll be a campaign donation, officially... if your local judges are elected here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The evidence is convincing,&quot; Officer Barnes sighed, &quot;we'll have to trust that... but those ears of yours... that might just sink Beauregard's whole little operation.&quot;</p>
