<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It really didn´t take long until someone met the new Johnny. Just as he entered the building and started to head to the entrance hall, Ryan came out of a door in that direction. And before the former gargoyle could say anything to him, Ryan took notice of his clothes, or better, the lack of them.<br />
“Johnny, what the hell? Why are you naked? Where are your clothes?” Ryan yelled, hoping the others weren´t near enough to hear him. He knew that his friends disliked Johnny for being younger, but normally he was rather well behaved around them. He wouldn´t even run around naked at home, so why did he so now?<br />
“Johnny” looked up at Ryan, grinned, and took off back to where he came from, the garden. Without saying anything to answer Ryan´s questions. He had already found one of the other´s, and from what he could guess, this was little Johnny´s older brother. He could tell part of the teen cared for the boy, fearing he would get ill running around naked.<br />
Ryan´s eyes widened at the weird behavior of his brother, but after a second to register that Johnny run outside, still naked, he run after him. He would get the reason for him acting like this. Outside, he needed to look a few seconds to spot his brother, just about to turn a corner at the end of the left path of him. So, he quickly followed.<br />
Unbeknownst to him, the former gargoyle had waited to be spotted. After all, he wanted Ryan to follow him to his brother´s new body, the gargoyle.<br />
After a few minutes of searching for the naked Johnny, Ryan ended up right in front of his gargoyled little brother, looking around. Johnny himself had seen the little thief run by and hide behind him with a grin, and was shocked to see his brother come after him. “No Ryan, not you. Please not my big brother.” He thought as he watched him look around.<br />
Just when Ryan turned his back to the gargoyle, the little thief ordered Johnny: “Grab his wrists and hold him up. Wrap your tail around his legs so he can´t kick around.” And without any chance of resistance, Johnny did as requested by the thief. He had Ryan´s wrist in a second, and yanked them upwards, leaving his brother hanging, before wrapping his tail around his legs by his knees, limiting Ryan´s movements to a minimum.<br />
Ryan, slightly turning at hearing his brother´s voice, had no time to react the unforgiving grab of his wrists, and yelped when the gargoyle held him in the air by them. It was painful to hang just that way, with no control over the point his weight was hanging from. He could easily lift his body with his hands, but his wrists weren´t that comfortable. When the tail wrapped around his knees, he had another point that held his weight, making it slightly less painful, if still uncomfortable.<br />
When the thief walked in front of Ryan, smirking, Ryan asked confused but angry: “Johnny, what are you doing? Let me go, you stone-brain.”<br />
Now the little boy laughed up at his “brother”, while Johnny plead in his head to release his brother. He didn´t even get mad for being called a stone-brain, after all, to his unknowing brother, he was right now.<br />
“I just captured another intruder. Or better, let the first captured get a hold of the second. And it is nice to know that you call your little brother a stone-brain. What for? Being dumb, or being a slow thinker?” the thief replied, grinning. Let´s see how smart this one could be.<br />
Ryan took a second before answering, angry: “I didn´t call you a stone-brain, Johnny. I meant that thing behind me, which you commanded to grab me. But why am I an intruder? Wouldn´t you be one, too?” Ryan took a second to think about that, and then gasped. “You aren´t Johnny.”<br />
The thief boy grinned evilly at him. “Yeah, I´m not who you call your brother. But truly, you just insulted your brother a second time. Are you that dumb yourself?”<br />
Ryan protested while thinking about this little shit´s former words. “I´m not dumb by any means, you little shit. What did you do to my brother? Why would I have insulted him by calling that thing behind me …” That was when he had an idea what he meant. “You didn´t …” and, turning his head around slightly, facing the gargoyle for the first time since it grabbed him: “Johnny?”<br />
The little thief laughed at the horror now on Ryan´s face. “He came here, calling me ugly. I turned him to stone, only for your other friends to ignore us, while insulting him, and by extension, you. But for me to act, I had to switch places with him. I took his little weak body, and your little brother become my replacement. He was an embarrassing view before I ordered him into a proper pose. Now, let´s get this done.” With that, the moving Johnny grabbed a hold of Ryan´s left foot, and started to undo the laces quickly. When they were open, Ryan was quickly robbed of his shoe and sock, before the process was repeated on his right foot.<br />
“What the hell are you doing? Let me go, and turn my brother back, you thief.” Ryan screamed at him, trying to kick him. But with his knees in a tight hold, he could only move his legs so little, it didn´t have any impact on this thing’s doings.<br />
“You are a loud one, much more than your brother was. But to be fair, I just turned him to stone before he could protest much. And didn´t you protest before of me being naked? I haven´t had clothes in decades. And as I destroyed the ones the little one wore as I petrified him, yours will need to do for now.” The thief said while opening Ryan´s belt, before turning to Johnny. “Do me a favor and keep his mouth closed. And pull down his jeans with your tail before grabbing his knees again.”<br />
Ryan´s eyes widened at the prospect of becoming naked right now. “Don´t you da…” was all he got out before Johnny´s left hand grabbed his chin and pushed it up, therefore closing his mouth. And before Ryan could do anything, Johnny´s hand now grabbed around his face from behind, his strong grip pressing his mouth shut. With all his will he couldn´t break his brother´s grip. While Johnny´s thumb and little finger took hold of his chin, the other three were in his hair, pressing down.<br />
With a fast pull, Johnny disrobed his brother off his jeans and belt, and the thief was quick as well to pull down Ryan´s boxers as well, before Johnny´s tail had a firm hold on Ryan´s legs again. All that remained to conceal Ryan´s cock and balls was his jockstrap, but that wasn´t of any interest for the former gargoyle. Even the boxers weren´t important to him. He just needed the outer wear to not run around naked, after all.<br />
Leaving the stripped-down clothes on the ground beside him, he instead ordered Johnny: “Now set him down on the ground, but keep your hands in place for the moment.” And while Johnny did, the thief pulled up Ryan´s shirt and jacket, unable to get them off with Johnny holding Ryan´s hands. “Let go of his head until I have the clothes above it, then retake the hold. Then let his wrists go, and take his arms around his elbows, while I take these clothes off of him.”<br />
The second Johnny´s left hand left his head free, Ryan did the only thing he could think of, scream for help. But it was muffled by his clothes being roughly being pulled over his face, and by the time his head was free of the clothes, the hand was already grabbing him again. Nobody could have heard him.<br />
With Ryan naked beside his jockstrap, and in a tight hold by Johnny the gargoyle, the thief in the body of his brother grinned evilly up at him. “Now that I have what I needed, spray him, Johnny. Make him part of the menagerie that started with you, and will end with your other friends. You can loosen your grip on him after he is sprayed, but keep his mouth shut for now.”<br />
Johnny was mentally crying as he was unable to do anything. He wasn´t able to stop himself from grabbing his brother, couldn´t let go of him, and now he would trap him in stone just like he himself was.<br />
Ryan tried to fight still, but his brother´s stone body was too strong for him to break free of. He felt the cold fluid hit his back and move over it in all directions, but was unable to do much. Even after Johnny only held his head firmly, he couldn´t run or beat down the imposter of his brother, as his movements got slower and slower. Soon any movement ceased, as Ryan was completely covered in stone. The cold air on his privates told him that, much to his horror, his jock-strap was now non-existent as well. It had dissolved under the fluid, just like Johnny´s clothes had done before.<br />
The thief now stood grinning menacing before the brothers. “Gargoyle, release the statue and retake your position you had before. Statue, stay to attention.”<br />
Johnny could do nothing but follow that order, and a few seconds later he stood back in the spot the thief had been before all this, looking as mean and fierce, ready to attack. He was still crying mentally, seeing his brother as a statue had him loose hope.<br />
Ryan stood straight in front of the still naked thief, dreading what was coming next. The only relief he had felt about his position had been his now hanging arms. Being forced to held them up had been uncomfortable.</p>
