<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She had collected Ryan's clothes and fled, not really asking herself what had happened and why the pool no longer called to her. Instead she simply gathered the pile of clothing and hauled ass through the house.<br />
<br />
Finally stopping to catch her breath, she wondered to herself, &quot;Why did we even come here? Ryan's now missing, I've lost my masculinity, I think, and I have absolutely no idea were everyone is.&quot; Dropping the clothes, she placed her hands to her face and began to cry.<br />
<br />
Presently she stopped and looked around. She was in a long hallway, somewhere in the Mansion. Hugging herself, forgetting about the things she'd dropped, Johnny began to wander down the hallway, in a direction she hoped was correct. Suddenly, a door opened and Eric dashed out. Taking one look at her he screamed, &quot;Either stay away from me or help me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not understanding, she looked at Eric, noted that his ears were on top of his head and resembled fox ears and said, &quot;Eric, it's me, Johnny. At least I think I'm Johnny. Things are getting so hard to understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at the girl that claimed to be Ryan's younger brother, Eric barked a laughter, something that reminded Johnny of a fox bark. Eric than asked, &quot;How can you be Johnny? One, Johnny's clearly a male. Two, Johnny is at least seventeen. You look to be about fifteen. Also, what do you mean that it's getting hard to understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Johnny began to retell the adventure in the garden with the gnomes and the pedestal. The pool and how something tried to draw her into it and how it drew her brother into it and he vanished. Nearly close to tears again, she sniffed and said, &quot;I think because of my menstruation and the fact that the longer I remain in this body, what ever magick that changed me, is still working on me. With my monthly, I think it's just hormones and other chemicals.&quot;<br />
<br />
Worried, Eric could see that this woman, who he was slowly starting think was maybe Johnny, was close to crying. Laying a paw shaped hand on her shoulder, he said to her, &quot;You could be in my situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sniffing, Johnny asked, &quot;What happened to you anyway? Why do you look like a fox in the ears and hands?&quot;<br />
<br />
Barking another laughter, Eric sat down and began to tell his tale.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the group split up, Mike with Sei, you going your own way and Ryan and I going different directions, I wandered a bit and eventually became hopelessly lost. Trying doors, I stumbled into what looked like a playroom and there was a little girl sitting in front of a table with a full plastic Tea set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking at me sweetly, she asked if I would play with her. Wigged out I declined. At which point she told me that I could play with her or Brutus.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not liking threats, I tried to explain to her that I was going to leave. At this point she began to first beg and than start to throw a temper tantrum. Before I could leave, I felt something club me from behind and I blacked out.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I came to, I was partially tied to a day bed. Wiggling about, I felt my bonds began to loosen. Just as I was about to escape, the girl came in and told me that I had made Brutus mad and now must suffer the consequences. When I tried to ask what those where, she merely giggled and then told me to hush, for Brutus was coming back with The Kit. He would teach me for not playing with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Brutus turned out to be anthropomorphic gorilla. Grunting, he set The Kit down and looked me over. Grunting some more, he started explaining that my punishment would be to become like him; an anthropomorphic animal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Going through The Kit, he selected Wolf, discarded it for Elephant, discarded that Chicken, discarded that for Horse. This went on for some time before he produced a vial full of a pink and red fluid and announced that a Vixen Kit would suffice; at least than I would be more inclined to play with Angela, the little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Producing a syringe, he than injected me with the fluid and than excused himself from the room. Angela giggled some more, said she was going to play with her dollies and would return when I was ready to play.<br />
<br />
&quot;Figuring Angela was the one that had tied me up, I waited until she was nowhere near and made my escape. Shortly after, my ears began to burn as they transformed. Just before I found you, a tickling sensation crept through my hands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding up his hands, Johnny and Eric could both see that they looked more like a combination of fox paws and human hands, plus there was black fur growing over them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to leave this place.&quot; Eric whined. &quot;It's just to weird. At the same time, I want to find a way to change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing, Johnny said to her distraught friend, &quot;You and me both. I want to get out of here, now more than I want to change back. I'm bothered by the fact I might have to live as a girl, but I'm bothered by the fact that I might be transformed again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So were to we go?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
Looking into the room Eric had come out, she shook her head and closed the door. Looking back the way she had come, Johnny realized that she had lost Ryan's clothes. Not wanting to go look for them and certainly not wanting to go back the way she had come, Johnny pointed down the hallway and said, &quot;Let's try this way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before she could move, a loud ripping noise issued from Eric's pants. Looking at him, Johnny could see a fluffy red tail with a white tip twitching back and forth.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to say, Johnny began to walk down the hallway. Every once and a while they would try a door, hoping for a way out. Johnny noticed that Eric was getting worse. He now had black fur that ran half way up his lower arms, he had shrunk down to about five foot tall and had started to rub his chest. <br />
<br />
Asking if there was a problem, Eric shrugged and said, &quot;My chest and nipples feel real weird. Almost like an itching sensation.&quot; And with out warning, he lifted his shirt and gasped at what he saw.<br />
<br />
White fur had began to sprout over the front of his chest in various patches. Along the sides, he had started to grow tufts of red fur. On top of that he had six erect nipples, three on the left and three on the right, growing on his chest. Dropping the shirt, Eric groaned, &quot;Great, I've got teats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not knowing what to say, Johnny continued down the hallway, trying doors as she went. On the thirteenth door, she struck pay dirt. Walking through, she and Eric, who's nose and mouth had started to merge together into a snout, walked into the main foyer. In front of the two figures stood the main doors out of this mansion. Turning to her friend, Johnny asked, &quot;Do you want to wait here or try the doors and escape this nut house to wait outside for the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric, who now looked about ten, opened his snout and barked out in English.....</p>
