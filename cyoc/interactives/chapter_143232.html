<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vect paced in the ready room anxiously for his signal to enter the arena. He had felt brimming with energy throughout the day ever since he&#39;d woken up. His opponent was Gregory Wilson, a student of the mages school, and Vect was eager to see how well their students measured up. As a bell rang out, Vect eagerly ran out through the passageway and to the arena, a smile stuck on his face. As he entered the arena he absorbed the cheers as his name was announced. He looked to the opposite end when his opponent&#39;s name was called and saw..... no one. Confused slightly, Vect walked to the center of the arena to wait.  He slung his sword onto his shoulder and did a few stretches to loosen up a little, but more to have something to do while he waited impatiently. After his name being called several times, and Gregory Wilson not showing. The announcer&#39;s voice rang through the arena. &quot;Due to his absence, Gregory Wilson had hereby forfeited the match. Vectivus Whitewood wins by default.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shocked by this Vect spoke up, barely able to be heard above the crowd. &quot;Could we set my match last of the day? Give him a chance to show then?&quot;<br />
The officials seemed to debate for a moment before announcing their decision. &quot;We cannot give special treatment to anyone. Either the participants show when they are told, or they forfeit. Those are the rules.&quot;<br />
Annoyed, but having no alternative, Vect bowed stiffly and exited. As he left the announcer began the introduction to the next pairings.<br />
<br />
Later in the stands. <br />
&quot;Hey, cheer up. You have tomorrow,&quot; Sara said reassuringly.<br />
&quot;But I felt so pumped up today,&quot; Vect responded gloomily. &quot;I think I&#39;ll head to the fighter&#39;s school training grounds in a little while to burn off some energy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Or how about you meditate with your spirit vessel,&quot; Beverly whispered to him. &quot;You do need to apologize often for not yet going through with the joining already.&quot;<br />
Vect got up and excused himself rather quickly, leaving the arena.<br />
&quot;Hey, anyone seen Celine,&quot; Eva asked looking around after Vect had left.<br />
&quot;I think she said something about wanting to shop around some,&quot; Mai answered.<br />
<br />
Celine had been wandering the market for a while now looking for a particular shop another shop keep had told her about that catered to catfolk especially. Curious, she&#39;d been looking for it for the past 3 hours and was starting to lose patience. Then she felt something tell her to try down a side alley. True enough there was the store. After browsing the selection available, Celine bought some things. As she left, Celine was sucker punched and pulled down a back alley by 3 men dressed in off duty Paladin uniforms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well. Lookie here, a stray cat without a leash.&quot; Celine felt 2 of them hold her hands from being able to cast a spell, with a gag forced into her mouth. &quot;We heard you don&#39;t like all what paladins do. All the sacrifices we make.&quot;<br />
Celine tried to transform, but felt bolts of electricity surge through her body causing her to lose most of her strength. &quot;Can&#39;t have you going savage on us now can we?&quot; He looked to his two cronies, &quot;so how should we deal with this stray?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, strays are usually put down aren&#39;t they,&quot; one answered.<br />
&quot;Oh they are,&quot; Celine heard the sound of a blade sliding from a sheath. &quot;Let&#39;s see if we can make our point.&quot; &#39;Oh gods, I&#39;m gonna die and the last thing I hear is a bad pun. Life sucks.&#39;<br />
Just before the attacker stabbed Celine he felt something break on his back, followed by an intense burning sensation. He fell to the ground, writhing in pain. The pair dropped Celine to face the attacker, only for the 2 to fall to the ground in pain as well. Celine slowly got to her feet and saw the trio covered in bubbling green liquid that her nose told her was alchemy acid. Standing on the other side of the aftermath was a very voluptuous woman dressed in a somewhat revealing dress. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok miss,&quot; the black haired woman asked worridly. In one hand was bottle of more of the acid.<br />
&quot;Yeah, thank you ma&#39;am,&quot; Celine bowed slightly. &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was nearby when I heard these, mention something about jumping a poor girl, and followed. Not exactly a smart idea, but I didn&#39;t know if the guards would arrive in time.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well thank you for your help. Now what to do with these jerks,&quot; Celine&#39;s voice turned to a growl as she stepped around the groaning men.<br />
&quot;They probably would have killed you if I hadn&#39;t come along,&quot; Alyvia said, face a mask of concern, using her free hand behind her back to cast a spell to increase the catfolk&#39;s anger slightly.<br />
&quot;Yes....they would have without a second thought....and they&#39;d probably do it again with someone else.&quot;<br />
&#39;I may not even need magic here,&#39; Alyvia thought, &#39;but I&#39;m on a time table,&#39; and continued the spell. &quot;The guards probably would have just let them go anyway. After all, the paladins are the saviors of the kingdom from all evil.&quot;<br />
&quot;They are loved by the ignorant masses and unenlightened to their true nature.&quot;<br />
&quot;So...what will you do to end this group&#39;s reign of terror?&quot; Alyvia continued to dial up Celine&#39;s already high anger levels, making rational thoughts becoming more difficult. &#39;Do it. Do it, I know you want to,&#39; Alyvia thought as she walked closer.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll see you skinned for this, wretch,&quot; spat the leader. &quot;I&#39;ll have you arrested for assault!&quot;<br />
&quot;You attacked me,&quot; Celine said coldly.<br />
The leader was breathing heavily through the pain. &quot;My word as a Paladin against some nobody.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well? How will you proceed with this,&quot; Alyvia smiled from behind Celine.<br />
&quot;Make them disappear,&quot; Celine held her hand open, palm facing the leader,&quot; who&#39;s smug expression disappeared. She then cast acid splash, pouring all her mana into the spell. The stream of acid completely covered the trio, drowning out their pained screams. Celine&#39;s mana drained and the spell stopped, leaving only a puddle of the acid remaining, but that soon flowed into the sewers and all traces were gone of the attackers. Alyvia caught Celine as she fell to the ground. &quot;Used a little too much mana didn&#39;t we? Come with me, I&#39;ve got a few mana potions at my shop for you.&quot; She let Celine lean on her shoulder as they walked back to her shop. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen an acid stream like that before,you&#39;re quite the mage you know.&quot;</p>
