<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the heavenly song reached the shoreline it washed over the sleeping young adults who where lying next to the dying fire. With unnatural force the song snuffed out the fire plunging the whole island into darkness. The only light came from the sky filled with breathtakingly beautiful stars and the two moons which cast their glow down on the sandy shore. <br />
<br />
The song reached all six of them but found a strong grip on two of the sleeping forms.<br />
<br />
Slowly Lily’s eyes opened as snuggled up beside her, her girlfriend Britney’s eyes also opened up. <br />
<br />
“Do you hear that?” whispered Britney, her voice was slightly off as if she was still asleep or in a daze.  <br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Lily, her voice in a similar state as her girlfriend. “Do you want to go to it?”<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Confirmed Britney as the two of them got up, forgoing their clothes which still lied next to the now snuffed out fire.<br />
 <br />
The two young women moved away from the sleeping group following the song, if they had been fully awake, if they hadn’t been overcome by the power of the song maybe they could have prevented what they did, however to them it felt like a dream. They stumbled a bit, moving like they where sleepwalking and in some way they where sleepwalking but sleepwalking away their humanity.<br />
<br />
They reached the shoreline and moved into the water, the water was strangely warm and as they moved out it actually began to glow around them. Once they were deep enough the water rushed up over their heads and pulled them down. The glow died so none could see anything off from the shoreline.<br />
<br />
“Welcome my children.” Said a warm loving voice as both Lily’s and Britney’s stood at the bottom of the ocean. They were not deep, if they had extended their hand up they would breach the surface but neither of them did. They were strangely calm, hypnotized by the song and the voice they heard.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to the Sea….” Said the voice as the currents surrounded them and gently pressed against their stomach and drew out the very last bit of air from their lungs. The current ran up their bodies between their breasts as both watched the air leave their lungs in stream. “Take in the sea.”<br />
<br />
The stream was reverse as ocean water rushed into their lungs but somehow it didn’t hurt, it felt as if they where breathing. The glowing waster formed a figure before them, it looked semi humanoid but made totally out of water and no visible legs, instead it’s legs was an ever changing mermaid tail.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to your new home my children, your friends will join in time along with ours but first you remake you.” Said the voice as it reached out toward them, one hand toward each of them however the arms split off until their where multiple arms coming off each of the single arm that had reached out to Lily and Britney. The hands beginning to remake them, molding them as if they where clay into their new form.<br />
<br />
Both women let out low moans of pleasure as the hands did their work, it was like getting the best deep muscle massage by an expert. <br />
Lily’s long blond hair, a point of pride for herself became richer and fuller as the short bob cut preferred by Britney remained however her brown hair changing into a deep rich purple color. Their faces remained the same for the most part, Lily’s blue eyes becoming a deep bright blue while Britney’s dark eyes became a bright purple. Any fault in their skin was quickly removed as a natural beauty makeup seemed to appear. Any fat that wasn’t required was either removed or moved to a different point across their bodies. Lily’s breasts grew a cup size, the already large C become easily a D cup but remained perky thanks to a series of new muscles which grew in under her now perfect skin. Britney’s breasts grew a cup size becoming a small C to large B but remained looking tiny compared to her girlfriend’s. From the waste up they had become the hottest version of themselves possible with only a small amount of physical changes. <br />
<br />
Now the hands moved down to the real changes, their feet. Their legs where quickly pushed together and fused together. They where also lengthened by around two feet before fins replaced their normal feet. The two feet meant that the normally tall Lily would now almost 8 ft long while Britney was about 7. <br />
<br />
Scales began to appear on their new tails, a mixture of rich purples and blacks for Britney while Lily’s tail became covered with a rich orange with some yellows around her hips and the tip of her tail. It wasn’t a clean break between the tail and the human upper half, small patches of scales grew up above the waistline but none reached up beyond the lower breast line. <br />
<br />
“Welcome to your new life, my mermaid Daughters.” announced the spirit as the hands pulled back as Britney and Lily just floated there. Their eyes still only half opened and their bodies shore and tired from the change.<br />
<br />
They didn’t resist as the hands moved them out of the water to rest them on one of the sandbars which sat only a couple of yards away from the shore line. They where with sight of their sleeping friends on the shoreline but most of their lower mermaid bodies where resting below the water. <br />
<br />
In their sleep the two new mermaids moved together, Britney resting her head under Lily’s neck with her hand resting between her girlfriend’s breast while Lily moved her face into Britney’s new hair and took a deep breath of her scent while her hand moved to rest on the small of her back right by where her human flesh turned into scales. <br />
<br />
There they slept and the spirit had to decide if they wanted to transform more this night or await the sunrise to see everyone’s reaction. </p>
