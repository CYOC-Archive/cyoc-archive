<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle spent most of the class trying to write notes while struggling to do so around his new bodies breasts, the stares settled down to an occasional glance from most of the guys. Kyle found that his favorite porn star&#39;s tits were not only huge, but difficult to deal with, occupying a good portion of the area in front of him, he finally figured out how to deal with them by the time the class was done. <br />
<br />
In the hall guys groped his ass and breasts, girls giggled as they looked at the boy turned sex symbol, he felt the eyes upon him, and what was worst of all, all this attention turned him on. He found his new bodies libido to be intense, just as high as he thought she was, he felt his new sex twitch a lot. In the lunch room, cat calls and laughs, he was asked out a few times by both guys and girls alike, and as Jen walked in she could be heard cackling, she left him to his fate, but it would be only a matter of time until she came over to gloat.<br />
<br />
After lunch the rest of the day was the same, struggling with Miami&#39;s mammoth tits, being groped and prodded, hearing comments not just from students but also the faculty, Kyle was mortified. He hadn&#39;t expected his wildest dream to come true with such big results, but he was in for a bigger surprise. On the bus ride home he felt every bump in his massive tits, and Jarred, usually talkative, quietly tried not to look at his friends new breasts. Kyle got off the bus and started walking home, when he got to the house he saw a pair of black vans with tinted windows, he ran up to the door, fearing the worst only to find his mother sitting in the living room with none other than Miami herself.<br />
<br />
“And here she is!” Miami beamed. “Hey girl, I was just talking to your mom about you.”<br />
<br />
“I never thought that a porn star would be so... normal.” His mom said.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, most of this profession is acting, although to be honest with you, you&#39;d make a great milf on screen.” Miami said.<br />
<br />
“Oh stop, I&#39;m too old for that... but still...” She blushed.<br />
<br />
“Now, we&#39;re taking your clothes.” Miami said and cut Kyle off before he protested. “Don&#39;t worry, with a body like that you wouldn&#39;t be able to wear them, I left you my wardrobe. Again, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s mostly normal stuff, but we were talking about some stuff that needs to be settled out.”<br />
<br />
“Like what?” Kyle finally got to say something, sitting down and feeling awkward around the woman.<br />
<br />
“Well, it&#39;s about some scheduled enhancement surgeries.” Miami began, “See, I&#39;m not sure if you know how big those puppies are right now.”<br />
<br />
“Um...” Kyle blushed. “I... I am a fan, so like... 6K ccs, at least that&#39;s what I read a week ago.”<br />
<br />
“So you are into women like this?” His mom asked. “Well, I can&#39;t say I blame you, being a young man and all, boobs are the best.” Kyle realized that the world was tailor suited to work around this curse now, so he didn&#39;t react.<br />
<br />
“Yep, you are correct Kyle, those are at 6K ccs, my girls... well your girls now are triple Q cups, I was naturally busty before my career. But you may have read some stuff about my ambitions for my girls.” <br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s eyes went wide, he realized what was happening, she had been on the road to beat world records, she had wanted to get to double the 10k record in the next year, he went pale. “So, w...what does this mean for me?”<br />
<br />
“Well, you understand that you have my body now, so those surgeries are yours if you want them.” <br />
<br />
“Well we can&#39;t really afford to do that kind of stuff.” Kyle&#39;s mom came to the rescue.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well you see, they&#39;re all already payed for, business write off you see, the new implants can go up to 20K at full size.”<br />
<br />
“20K?” His mom shouted, “Damn girl, you really are a size queen!”<br />
<br />
“I know, so you should know that those surgeries are Kyle&#39;s if he wants them, they are all payed off anyway, but I can refund them.”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t know if...” Kyle started.<br />
<br />
“So how much do all those surgeries actually cost?” His mother cut him off.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well, all together, new implants, and all the saline infusions, about twenty thousand dollars.” Miami said, “Porn makes big money at times.” Kyle&#39;s mom stared at her for a minute.<br />
<br />
“Maybe I should do porn.” She said.<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t think I want...” Kyle started again.<br />
<br />
“No son of mine is going to let a woman waist her money or time.” His mother said flatly, then looked over at Miami, “I think it&#39;s a fitting punishment for stealing your body, after all, he&#39;s got the goods, he may as well continued with your ambition. But how big would those bras be? Do they even make bras that big?”<br />
<br />
“No, I was planning to just use pasties after the surgery, being that they estimated those babies would be a little over twice as big as they are now.” Miami said.<br />
<br />
“Twice as big?” Kyle&#39;s mom looked at him, trying to imagine the size of the breasts he would soon be sporting. “Well, that&#39;s quite the ambition, I bet your relieved that you won&#39;t have to deal with them now.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, I was looking forward to it, but having a sex change for free is kinky in it&#39;s own right, so I&#39;m complaining, and Kyle gets to enjoy what I was going for now.” Miami smiled.<br />
<br />
“Well honey,” Kyle&#39;s mom looked at him, “Sounds like your all set, soon you&#39;ll be having fun with the boobs you always dreamed of.”<br />
<br />
“And since you&#39;ll be getting those surgeries, I&#39;ll happily help with your new clothes, after all, I&#39;ll be making mint with your body and clothes soon.” Miami laughed. <br />
<br />
“And when are those scheduled for?” <br />
<br />
“The first one is next week actually.” Miami said, “You may want to keep him out of school for a while, they&#39;re going to be tender.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, with breasts that big, you bet I&#39;ll probably get him into home schooling, he won&#39;t fit in the desks!” His mom laughed, Kyle didn&#39;t really pay attention to the rest of the conversation, feeling clammy and numb as he realized he was doomed, after Miami left he walked back to his room and took his heels off. He expected that his body would soon try and rip him off of it, but instead it lifted it&#39;s hands and laughed at him in sign language. Kyle sat down and tried to figure out a way out of this, and realized that he was screwed, he couldn&#39;t even swap his body out.</p>
