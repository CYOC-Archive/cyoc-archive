<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Chris undressed before stepping into the shower, his clothes felt oddly tight across his chest and shoulders. Taking off his shirt, he examined his college gut, which was looking smaller than he remembered. He frowned as he prodded his somewhat leaner stomach. He must have burnt off a few pounds at the gym, and gained some muscle to boot. Not much, but noticeable. <br />
<br />
He also felt that his body hair looked a little thicker, the sparse coverage of dark hair on his chest looking darker and more mature. He had read somewhere once that it wasn&#39;t unusual for men to continue growing more body hair into their mid-twenties. So, he wasn&#39;t too worried. <br />
<br />
He stepped into the shower, adjusted the temperature so the water was somewhere between freezing and scalding, and proceeded to soap up. He couldn&#39;t help but notice that his body felt strange. Leaner, broader, like he developed muscles without realizing it. Looking down, his arms did look more jacked than he remembered them being. The hair on them seemed darker and thicker than before, as well. <br />
<br />
Chris stuck his head directly under the shower and blasted his face with the water. He must still be tired. This weird Chronivac thing was messing with him. He just needed time to wake up properly. Have a coffee and a smoke, then he could go to work. <br />
<br />
He stopped. Smoke? Work? He was a full time student, and had never touched a ciggarette in his life. The most he&#39;d worked since attending college was manning a table for the Theatre Club&#39;s bake sale for fifteen minutes when one of them had to use the bathroom. Still, Chris couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that he shouldn&#39;t stay in the shower for too long, or he&#39;d be late and the chief would rip into him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shit...&quot; Chris muttered as he rubbed his eyes vigorously. He must&#39;ve been more out of it than he thought. Then he caught a glimpse of his hands. <br />
<br />
His hands now seemed calloused, thick, dark hair on the backs of his hands and down his arms ran in dark rivulets, soaked from the shower. <br />
<br />
Chris slammed open the shower door and stumbled out into the bathroom. He immediately noticed his lean, athletic, but not overly muscular torso, all of which had a decent layer of dark, wet hair. He even saw a few scars dotted here and there. Chris ran his hand over one that looked suspiciously like a bullet wound on the left side of his waist. <br />
<br />
Chris slapped his face in an attempt to snap himself out of this weird hallucination he must be having. That&#39;s when he noticed something else now seemed to be off. He reached back into the shower and shut off the water before grabbing his towel and wiping away the thick fog that had covered the bathroom mirror. He stood in complete disbelief at what he saw.<br />
<br />
He was broader, and even a few inches taller. There was the wide hairy chest, defined abs and the muscular arms and shoulders. There were also his thighs and calves, which also seemed to have become a fraction larger with muscle. He didnt look body builder size, but someone who was in good shape. Most of his chest, legs and forearms were covered in dark hair, still wet from the shower. As he glanced down, he finally laid eyes on his cock. <br />
It was roughly the same length as before, but also seemed thicker, somewhat rounded in shape and now had a full foreskin. His balls were definitely larger, hairier, and hung lower then before. Chris was curious to see what it looked like hard, but the nagging thought of being late stopped him. Pushing it out of his mind, he leaned on the sink in front of him, suddenly noticing his face. <br />
His once-thin boyish face was now angular, with a defined chiselled and a wide square dimpled chin, giving him a strong masculine look, and his once clean shaven jawline had now grown a rough stubble too. <br />
As he took it all in, Chris noticed a few specks in his stubble. he leaned in close, noting the lines at the corners of his eyes and etched in his forehead, making his skin look rough and weathered. A few of the hairs in his stubble seemed to be grey, in contrast to the surrounding dark. As he watched, he noticed the hairs on his sideburns were changing colour, snapping from black to grey in front of his eyes. As he leaned back, he saw his brow looked more prominent than before, his eyebrows becoming thicker, his nose had reshaped too, becoming more roman in shape. Even his eyes had changed colour,  from there usual brown, to a steely grey. Chris’s hair seemed like it was longer on the top as well. Still slicked down from the shower, the grey hairs appeared to be spreading up his sideburns. Chris scowled at the reflection, deep frown lines appearing. He looked somewhat like his first girlfriends dad. <br />
<br />
Chris realized he was still holding the towel. He quickly rubbed it in his hair to dry it out, slicking it back into a sleek professional yet rugged style, a few hairs framing his forehead. He&#39;d better hurry, the chief would chew his ass if he was late on the scene. <br />
<br />
Why did he keep thinking about work? He should be freaking out right now! Sure, he was freaking out a little bit, but not nearly as much as he should have. <br />
<br />
Then it struck him. The Chronivac. He&#39;d told it to apply the 43 year old detective package to him. He&#39;d assumed it was some sort of simulation. But what if it was real? What if he was becoming a grizzled, chain smoking, whisky drinking, middle aged cop. <br />
<br />
He heard a sharp beep from the other room, the Chronivac&#39;s timer finishing. And here he was, a 43 year old detective, not wanting to be late for work, and also dying for a smoke. <br />
<br />
He pulled the towel away from around his neck, as he finished styling his hair, before picking up a bottle of cologne and spritzing his neck. Smelled okay, if not a little cheep. <br />
<br />
He finished drying himself off, discovering that his body hair was surprisingly dark even when dry, 5 for the odd salt and pepper grey. Naked and a bit damp, he made his way back to Anthony&#39;s computer and looked over his new stats. Most notable was his new age, 43, height, 6’2, and weight, 181lbs. He again felt the urge to get himself to work, lest he be late. This was problematic as he didn&#39;t actually have a job and so he didn&#39;t know where he could possibly... <br />
Chris then saw a black notepad on the desk next to the computer, an address written and underlined. ‘153 King St. Apt 5’. Chris furrowed his brow, which felt more natural every time he did it. <br />
“Crime scene. Should check it out” he said aloud, before immediately pausing. His voice had changed <br />
“The hell...” he spoke again. He sounded gruff, and incredibly gravelled. Like both Solid Snake from Metal Gear and Geralt from the Witcher combined. And also like those characters, Chris also noticed he was talking to himself aloud. Shaking it off he picked up the notepad for a look. <br />
“I need to get going” <br />
One problem, he was still naked, and he was sure none of his clothes would fit him any more as he was broader, and nearly a whole 4 inches taller then before, but maybe... <br />
<br />
No. This was crazy. The device was between jobs right now, and he could easily just change himself back and go to class. <br />
Wait... If it worked on him, did that mean he&#39;d actually turned Anthony into a suburban dad? Chris had to see that in person. Perhaps he should change himself back and try to find him. That would be hilarious. Then again, Chris was now a badass detective. It might be exciting, more so then a boring 2 hour lecture. He could always find Anthony later, although he had no idea what Anthony now looked like. <br />
Either way, he needed clothes. <br />
He crossed the hall to his room and opened the wardrobe and pulled out a pair of jeans that should be just about long enough. Although he’d need a belt, given his now trimmer waistline. He sat on the bed and pulled them over his legs, before standing up to pull them up and put on the belt. <br />
Chris then re opened the wardrobe, picked up an old t-shirt, and shut it. When he looked back in the mirror, he stared at his reflection confused.  His ill fitting blue jeans were now a pair of brown tailored pinstripe slacks, and a brown leather belt. Chris turned to examine them, before shrugging. <br />
“Guess I don’t have to worry about my clothes not fitting...” <br />
He then pulled on the t-shirt, but as he finished pulling it over his head, he looked in the mirror to see he was wearing a worn white dress shirt, untucked, half unbuttoned, sleeves rolled up. Going with it, he tucked his shirt in and did the buttons up, leaving the last one undone. <br />
“Hmmph” Grunted Chris, before crossing the room to pick up his college hoodie and sneakers. When he returned to the mirror, he saw he was now wearing a dark red and salmon striped tie, loosened slightly around his neck, along with a silver watch. <br />
Carrying on, Chris knelt down to put on his shoes, to find his socks where now black sheer dress socks, and his sneakers had become leather brown oxfords the second he looked away. He put the, on, noticing how they resized to fit his larger feet. He finished tying the laces, before standing up, picking up the hoodie to put it on. He pulled his arms through and began to zip it up, only to find he was now buttoning up a matching brown fitted pinstripe waistcoat instead. He examined the look before giving a half smile. <br />
“A little old school... not bad though” <br />
He picked up his backpack and headed out into the hall. <br />
“Better keep this in case I wanna turn back and head to class” said Chris, pulling the straps on. He then noticed it felt oddly light, and looked down to see it was now a brown leather shoulder holster. <br />
“Or not... should’ve seen that coming” <br />
It then dawned on him, what was a holster without a...<br />
“Well shit...” said Chris, taking out the revolver. It was even loaded. He wanted to freak out, but for some reason he couldnt. Chris assumed it was because it was normal for a detective to have a gun. <br />
But he couldnt walk about with a gun in clear view, could he? Chris didnt even know. Just in case he took his leather jacket off the hook and pulled it on. However, the second he looked away, it became a worn trench coat. Chris raised a cynical eyebrow. <br />
“Really? A little on the nose don’t you think” <br />
It was at that point Chris decided not to put on a hat in case it became a trilby. He patted himself down looking for his wallet, keys and cell phone. Feeling something, he pulled it out to find an open packet of Marlboro Red and a lighter. <br />
“Figured that’d show up at some point” <br />
Chris remembered he’d left his wallet and keys and by the computer. When he found them, he realised they had changed too. His phone was now an old flip phone, and his wallet was bigger. It contained a police badge and ID. <br />
Chris looked at the ID, that now read ‘Detective Christopher Greaves’, along with his photo, birthdate, Police id number etc. <br />
Chris stuffed the wallet and cell in his pants pockets, before picking up the notepad. <br />
“Probably need this” <br />
Chris then headed out the door. Almost by instinct, he reached into his pocket, pulled out a ciggarette, put it between his teeth and lit up. He took a puff and exhaled deeply. <br />
“Okay.... what now”</p>
