<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was an uneasy silence in the lounge for several long moments, broken only by the crackling of the fire. Finally, Sally sighed – and stood up. She nodded.<br />
<br />
“I’ll be…honored…to make you both my pack mates. And I’ll also meet this pack with you guys.” Sally’s voice shook, as she stepped forward. Karl and Alice breathed a sigh of relief, and they hugged their lycanthropic friend and thanked her. Sally brushed aside her tears. <br />
<br />
“Let’s check on how the dinner’s cooking. I’d rather get my teeth into that beef joint and the rest of the meal, before nibbling on you pair,” she joked to lighten the mood. “Oh, and I rather get the washing up out of the way first, too!”<br />
<br />
“You mean…you’ll bite us tonight?” Alice gasped.<br />
<br />
Sally bobbed her head. “I’ll be honest. I have wondered how things would be if we were…of the same kind. But I didn’t want to ask you – I was too afraid of ruining our friendship!”<br />
<br />
“You won’t,” Karl assured her. “Now, let us all help out with the cooking and enjoy this special evening together!”<br />
*     *     *<br />
<br />
With the meal and cleaning up all sorted, the trio of friends started to feel nervous again. Karl and Alice decided to toss a coin to see who went first – and the coin selected Karl. <br />
<br />
“Where do you want to bite us, Sal?” Alice put to her.<br />
<br />
“Around your thigh muscles – plenty of flesh for me to get my jaws around, instead of me crushing any bones or damaging any organs. Head for the bathroom, Karl – and take off your jeans,” Sally instructed.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Karl took off his shoes and socks. Then he pulled down his jeans, folding them on the edge of the bath. He took a moment to forcibly compose himself as he faced his reflection in the mirror. His heart pounded as he waited for the knock at the door. The moment soon arrived.<br />
<br />
“Come in, Sally. I’m set,” he called out.<br />
<br />
The handle turned and the sandy-blonde furred wolf woman stepped into the room on the balls of her hind paws, her nose twitching from the fear in the room that Karl was trying not to emit further. Sally was the same size in her lycanthrope form as in her human one – athletic, whilst being of average height. But her muscles were more defined after the change from human to lupine huntress – and unlike the first time he saw her like this, Karl was not shocked and horrified, but struck by the wild, supernatural beauty of his friend. Whilst not as sleek as a true wolf, Karl had learnt from Sally that she had learnt from experience how to be a successful predator, tracking down small animals and the occasional deer by scent, hearing, and night vision. Learnt how she built up her agility and speed as a werewolf to the point that she was faster – as well as stronger – than as the human jogger she had been before being forced to join the werewolf race. <br />
<br />
Now Sally slowly approached Karl, and - trembling slightly – he reached out his hands to stroke her rough, but wonderful, pelt and the mane-like cranial fur. In turn, Sally gently licked his face – making him laugh.<br />
<br />
“Last chance, to change, your mind,” Sally half-barked, holding his gaze with her intelligent amber eyes.<br />
<br />
Karl shook his head. Nodding, Sally then slinked behind him, and squatted on the floor. Holding him in place with her firm arms, she licked the back of Karl’s upper leg – before angling her jaws and slowly and carefully biting down until she broke the flesh. Her ears twitched as Karl gasped in pain – but she maintained her bite grip, passing on the saliva forming from within her muzzle. Using her tongue, Sally willed her nature into Karl’s bloodstream – then, releasing her jaws; she licked the blood away and backed away, so that Karl could apply a bandage.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Alice was pinning a bandage over her own bite mark as Sally slipped her furred arms off her friend. Then, whilst Alice began to slip on her pants, Sally surprised her by transforming back there and then in the bathroom. Her bones, muscles, ligaments, and joints all changed in unison, amidst several ‘cracks’ and ‘pops’ – whilst the sandy blonde fur receded into Sally’s skin like a time-lapsed film of grass growing, but being run in reverse. The pointed ears shrank to human proportions as they returned to the sides of Sally’s head, and her nose and muzzle gradually flattened themselves against her now-pink face with a series of crunching noises. Panting as she got her breath back, Sally Yeller rose upon her human feet. She folded her arms against her breasts.<br />
<br />
“Sorry if I startled you, Alice… I figured you need to get used to the idea of seeing the transformation in me in reverse, as well as from human to lycanthrope form. And you shouldn’t feel put off by my nudity – because during the next full moon…”<br />
<br />
“…you, me, and Karl will disrobe and change together…” Alice smiled, nodding. “Hopefully, I will be as beautiful as you, Sal. And Karl… He will be gorgeous as a wolf man.”<br />
<br />
Sally smirked. “I envy you. He’s a good man – and before long, you’ll literally be able to sink your claws into him!”<br />
<br />
After Sally jogged back to her bedroom to get re-dressed, the re-clothed Karl came upstairs and entered the bathroom. Seeing a frown on Alice’s face, he asked her what was wrong.<br />
<br />
“I was considering. It’s good that we’re taking the plunge together – but… There’s still the chance that either you or me will be one of the few who have proved to be naturally immune to the werewolf condition.” She sniffed and rested her head against Karl’s chest as he comforted her.<br />
<br />
Karl sighed and gently turned her to face their reflections in the mirror. “Don’t think like that, sweetheart. See that couple looking back at us? They are two special people who are going to have to get used to the idea that they are now slowly becoming more than human. They are now werewolves in waiting. And they are going to do all they can to improve human-werewolf relationships. And that journey is going to start with a measure of faith, as well as love.”<br />
<br />
The ends of Alice’s lips plucked up. “Yes – you’re right. We’re now werewolves in waiting… But let’s not make it official to this pack yet. Not before the next full moon.” She tilted her face upwards, enabling her and Karl to share a long, tender kiss as they embraced.</p>
