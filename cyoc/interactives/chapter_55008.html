<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cletus returns and tosses a copy of the cologne he gave you yesterday. You open the can and proceed to spray it all over your body, especially at your crotch. Cletus steps back and waves his hand in front of his nose. &quot;Peeeee-u, boy,&quot; he groaned, &quot;I think ya sprayed on a bit too much.&quot; You don't seem to agree as you shake the can and spray more under your shirt. Once finished, you toss the empty can over your shoulder. &quot;Shucks Cletus, why do I ‘ave ta go ta school?&quot;, you barked as you scratch your belly under your shirt, &quot;I was fixin' to enjoy tha rest of the day here wit ya's.&quot; &quot;No whinin',boy,&quot; lectured Cletus as he leaves the room, &quot;Besides, I’m goin’ wit ya.” You smiled in joy.  You thought as long as you’re with Cletus, who cares where you go? “Now git yer tailhide 'n rear an' let's roll.&quot; You faithfully follow his order, but tumble around as you try to get used to your new weight. Nevertheless, you manage to follow Cletus outside the raggidy ol' shack. Upon reaching outside, you feel something around you was off. It felt as if you were missing something. &quot;Hey, Clee. Did I leav' sumthin' outside her' last night?&quot; Cletus turns his head but finds nothing. &quot;You on sumthin'? Looks tha same to me.&quot; You scratch your head as you ponder what was missing; however, you give up as you just couldn't remember. You put your hand over your gut as your bladder starts to act up. &quot;Wait a sec, Clee. I'm gitting tha runs,&quot; you announced. Annoyed, Cletus taps his foot and sighs. &quot;Well fuc', at least toss tha keys over so I can git yer truck started.&quot; You reach down your pocket, toss Cletus your keys, and then proceed to run towards the nearby tree. You quickly undo your pants as you turn and squat against the bark. You usher a loud fart and release a wide load onto the ground. A slight sense of relief overcomes you just before another one begins struggling its way out. You clench your fists tightly as it drops to the floor. You rise and take a breather as the stress on your legs was really starting to build up. &quot;Done yet boy?,&quot; yelled Cletus as he continues to start your truck. &quot;Almost, Clee.&quot; You pull several big leafs from a nearby bush and proceed to wipe your rear; you grab and use some more to further clean your hole. Finally ready to go, you pull up your pants, lift your belly, and proceed to buckle your belt. Cletus finally starts the truck then scoots over to the passenger seat. &quot;Fuc', you know ya couldv' jus’ used the can in mah house,&quot; he smirks as you jump in the truck and slam the door. &quot;O' well. I reckon'd it was faster to use it there anahways,&quot; you reply as you spit the last of your chaw out the window. You lift your arm behind the seat and slowly back the truck down the hill. Cletus hands you another can of chaw and smiled as he could tell your common sense was dropping.<br />
<br />
After 15 or so mins out on the road, you began to ponder about something yet again. &quot;Hey Cletus, where those friends of yers disappear to?&quot; you ask. &quot;Ya mean Lester and the boys? They hit tha road last night after u feel asleep. We’ll meet when we git to school,&quot; he replies and points ahead, &quot;Hey, keep ya eye on tha road.&quot; You turn your eyes back towards the road. &quot;Man, this shure is a long route for school. Yer bus comes all tha way out here or somethin'?&quot; &quot;Naw. Buses don’t run out these parts. My boys gives me ‘nough transportaysheun.” “Ah, I see.” You let your left arm hang out the window as you drive and chew. Wanting some action, you decide to flip the radio and old bluegrass music comes on. Cletus gets real excited and slaps his thigh. “Ouwee, boy! This here’s real music!” he yells while twisting the volume up to its highest level. You glance cheerfully at Cletus as he sings along as loud as he could. You follow suit and start to hum with him; however, not too long afterwards, you start to sing just as loud as he. By now, you knew everything about the song; all the lyrics, who wrote it, even when it was made. Knowledge of many more songs seemingly entered your head.  It was as if you were always a bluegrass and country fan, a very proud one at that. You could no longer imagine yourself listening to any other kinds of music, especially that god awful pop you use to listen to. After the strings of songs were over, you proudly spit a large black out the window and bellow a loud “YEEEE HAWWW!” “That’s what I’m talkin’ bout, boy!!” laughs Cletus loudly as he slaps your shoulder, “You’re born to be one of us!” “Watcha talkin’ bout Clee? I’ve always been one of yall!” you happily reply as you fix your cowboy hat.<br />
<br />
After a long drive, the 2 of you finally arrive at school. Across the way, a couple of class-skipping Jocks see the 2 of you get out of the truck. “...And here comes the Beverly hillbillies,” one jock says. “Ugh... Let’s go, man. You know how they smell,” says another as he closes his phone.  They both grab their stuff and walk away. Back at the truck, you usher out a big relieving moan as you stretch yourself from the ride. Cletus scratches his armpit and silently wheezes out a rancid fart. “Fuck son, we’re late. First class already started.” “Man fuc’ class Clee,” you moaned, “How ‘bout we mosey ourselves back in mah truck. I’m hootin’ to see mor’ of yer… ridin’ lessons,” you implied as you licked your mouth. “Heheh, calm down there soldier. Be a good boy and I’ll give ya as many lessins ya want tonight,” counter implied Cletus, “Now let’s git ourselves to class.” “But what ‘bout our boys?” “Who knows? Maybe we’ll catch them at lunch.”<br />
<br />
As Cletus goes to his class, you spit out all your chaw at a random trashcan and decide to stop at your locker. Once there, you open it and slide your hat in. You end up forgetting what you were doing in class today so you just randomly grab a notebook and pencil, then proceed to slam the locker close. As you approach the door, you just now thought to yourself, “How are they going to recognize you?” You try to think of a plan or something to say, but you just couldn’t get your mind off your chaw and Cletus’s dick. Frustrated, you open the door anyway and casually walk in. Everyone, including the teacher, instantly halts all actions and words upon your enter. You can feel the of eyes everyone staring directly at you as you nonchalantly walk to your seat. The other teens, as well as the teacher, moaned in disgust as they covered their noses as your presence walked by. “Pardon me sir, but I think you have the wrong class,” prodded the teacher just before you sat down. “Uh, it’s me… [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]. Sorr’ ‘bout comin’ in late, but this here IS my seat,” you reply. “Seriously sir, if you don’t leave I’m calling security.” “Wai-Wait a sec teach! I know I looks a bit differen’ n all, but I’m tellin’ ya, I’m [INSERT YOUR NAME HERE]!” The teacher ignores you and darts for the phone while you run out the room, scaring everybody. You run into the first bathroom you see and flush open the last stall; however, you end up finding a girl giving head to a very nice looking guy. “I’m conductin’ business here! You mind?” asks the guy. “Par-Pardon me,” you say as you blush, shut the stall, and quickly run out the bathroom. “There he is!” yells the teacher just as you exit. You run; however, security quickly catches up to you and pins you to a locker. “DON’T MOVE,” screamed one of them. As they arrest you, memories of how you previously looked flashed within your head. You knew you shouldn’t have gone to school today.</p>
