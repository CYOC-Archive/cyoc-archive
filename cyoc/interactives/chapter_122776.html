<br />
&quot;Say, what&#39;s going on over there?&quot; asked the werewolf disc jockey over his equipment. &quot;Did someone decide to start another party and not invite me?&quot; he asked, wondering what all the applause was about.<br />
&quot;SHE SAID YES!&quot; shouted Joy and Ife Talbot at the same time, as their cousin Peter and his new fiance Karen Yuletide were lost in their own little world, hugging and kissing each other as he laid prone across the gym floor with her on top of him.<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot; repeated the werewolf, before realizing what the girls meant. &quot;Then let&#39;s get the happy couple over here so we can all give them a big round of applause.&quot;<br />
<br />
It took a couple of moments for the girls to bring their cousin and their future in-law back to &quot;reality&quot;.<br />
When they finally realized what was going on, Karen and Peter reluctantly stopped what they were doing and got up off the floor.<br />
Brushing each other off, each nodded to the other before they grabbed their future mate&#39;s hand and walked to the far end of the gym where the disc jockey had set up for the Halloween dance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t they make a cute couple?&quot; Virginia McCoy asked her fiance Harold Jenkins.*<br />
&quot;This isn&#39;t conceit or ego, but I can think of one better,&quot; replied her weretiger, before he hugged his weretigress and gave her a kiss on the side of her furry muzzle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay you two. Who do I have the honor of addressing?&quot; asked the disc jockey, before holding his microphone out to the happy couple.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Peter Talbot, and this is my fiance Karen Tal-, I mean Yuletide,&quot; he said happily, standing close to Karen.<br />
&quot;Talbot? You mean...&quot; began the werewolf, knowing the name but not recognizing him in his normal appearance, since Peter currently wasn&#39;t displaying his werelion fursona.<br />
&quot;Please. I don&#39;t stand on ceremony,&quot; requested Peter, starting to get embarrassed.<br />
&quot;Okay. Well, have you two set a date yet?&quot; asked the disc jockey.<br />
Peter, unable to answer that question, simply turned his head and looked at Karen.<br />
&quot;What do you think of Valentine&#39;s Day next year?&quot; Karen asked him in return.<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t soon enough for me, but whatever you want darling,&quot; replied Peter, before kissing her again.<br />
When their lips finally parted, the werewolf asked, &quot;So, he just popped the question and you said yes. Right?&quot; to which Karen simply nodded her head affirmatively, because she wouldn&#39;t stop looking and smiling at Peter.<br />
&quot;So, where&#39;s the ring?&quot; asked the disc jockey.<br />
&quot;Ring? What ring?&quot; asked Peter in return.<br />
&quot;The engagement ring,&quot; explained the werewolf.<br />
&quot;Err... can we have a moment?&quot; Peter asked, before turning to face Karen.<br />
<br />
The disc jockey stepped aside and turned off his microphone for a moment while Peter positioned himself so his back was to the crowd, blocking their view of him and Karen.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I didn&#39;t get you an engagement ring,&quot; he confessed to her. &quot;With all our conversations about weres in general and werelions specifically, I got you something that I hope shows you the depths of my love and feelings for you,&quot; added Peter, before pulling out of his costume&#39;s jacket pocket the bottle he acquired.<br />
Karen looked at the object he gently placed in her hands.<br />
At first she was confused, even upon realizing that it was a bottle of werelioness birth control pills.<br />
Then she saw that the prescription was made out to Karen TALBOT and not under her maiden name.<br />
&quot;When?&quot; was all she asked, holding the bottle close to her heart while smiling at him.<br />
&quot;That is a matter best discussed in private,&quot; Peter whispered in her ear.<br />
&quot;Okay, but this Cinderella costume you rented for me doesn&#39;t have any pockets, so you should hold on to it for now,&quot; said Karen, handing the bottle back to him.<br />
<br />
Then she turned to face the disc jockey, who took the hint and came back toward them with his microphone on again.<br />
&quot;The only ring I want from my future husband is the one he&#39;ll place on my finger come Valentine&#39;s Day next year. But you are definitely looking at the future Mrs. Karen Talbot,&quot; she said with a smile, before turning to kiss Peter again.<br />
&quot;There you have it guys and gals and football fanatics,&quot; said the werewolf disc jockey, getting back into character to reflect who he was dressed up as. &quot;Cinderella has found her Prince Charming, and this ball has a happy ending for these two, because I seriously doubt there&#39;s a pumpkin waiting outside to whisk her home by midnight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to tell the others!&quot; realized Joy Talbot, but Ife Talbot was already on her cellphone.<br />
&quot;Uncle Leon? Guess what?&quot; said Ife. &quot;Peter and Karen are getting married!&quot;<br />
<br />
At one end of the dance floor, Alex Ramsey was holding his boyfriend Nate Anderson close as the crowd began to cheer and applaud again.<br />
&quot;Someday,&quot; Alex whispered into his lover&#39;s lupine ear.<br />
&quot;Someday,&quot; Nate whispered in return, before the werewolves kissed.<br />
<br />
At the table they shared, Eric Anderson looked at his fiance Julie Stovall sitting next to him.<br />
The two were-mers simply smiled at each other as they continued to hold webbed hands.<br />
<br />
Sitting across from Eric and Julie, Melissa Jenkins* looked at Trevor Tyson and smiled demurely at him before turning to look back at the proceedings on the dance floor.<br />
The werebull stared at the red hair of his date, who was still a normal human being.<br />
For now.<br />
<i>I do love you Melissa Jenkins, but we both know neither of us is ready for that kind of commitment yet. I&#39;m still waiting for that special moment when I can openly declare my love for you and welcome you into were society.</i><br />
Trevor reached out and tenderly put an arm across Mel&#39;s shoulders.<br />
Mel simply looked at him and smiled again before leaning against his taller, more muscular werebull form.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Since their arrival in the woods surrounding the crescent shaped body of water the town of Moon Lake was named after earlier this evening, Harold Jenkins and his new wife Jennifer Harper-Jenkins had been enjoying their honeymoon the best way weres knew how.<br />
With lots of hot and heavy, passionate and romantic sex.<br />
The werefox and his werevixen knew that they would have to go back inside the lake front cabin the Skulk had loaned them before dawn to avoid being in violation of the public were laws**, but until then the couple planned to continue physically expressing their love for each other under the stars.<br />
At the moment Harry and Jenny were within the classic 69 position, each orally pleasuring the other, when Jenny suddenly stopped licking her husband&#39;s hard vulpine cock and looked up.<br />
Then a smile crossed the werevixen&#39;s muzzle as she realized what it was that made her pause.<br />
&quot;Honey, is everything all right?&quot; asked Harry, briefly managing to tear himself away from the tasty treat before him.<br />
&quot;She said yes!&quot; happily replied Jenny.***<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
&quot;Karen said yes to Peter&#39;s wedding proposal.&quot;<br />
&quot;Now how do you—&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain later,&quot; promised his new wife, before Jenny resumed sucking on his hard penis, looking forward to another taste of Harry&#39;s werefox cum in her immediate future.<br />
Harry, uncertain exactly what was going on, went back to enjoying the werevixen cream leaking from Jenny&#39;s furry vagina.<br />
____________________________________________________________________<br />
*The Jenkins at the Halloween dance are from our companion <i>Moon Lake, Jenkins</i> series.<br />
**No were can be seen in public displaying their true form during the day except during life threatening<br />
 emergencies or at officially sanctioned events.<br />
***Tachibana no Akane knows, and no one else suspects (yet?), that the blonde furred werevixen possesses &quot;special&quot; abilities, because a naturally blonde furred fox is seriously rare among the Skulk.—tmw.</p>
