<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen quietly drove home in the late afternoon after finishing all her related job hunt tasks with regard to filling out the paper applications for the positions that she had found in the paper regarding getting back into the work force. There were a few positions and things to look into in Seattle for the moment, but with the aftermath of Lionel Ulysses&#39; arrest and death still in her mind and in the news in some way shape or form, she figured to let that sit for now. That situation would likely blow over fairly soon, but Jen didn&#39;t want to test things until after that had happened, and it wasn&#39;t as though the positions in Moon Lake that she&#39;d applied to were bad. With her work done, she was on her way home.<br />
<br />
She arrived only to notice a small gathering of people walking up to the front door of the house. She recognized the two younger ones as Amy&#39;s brothers, Jay and Leon, and figured the older two were Amy&#39;s parents. As she parked her car in the garage, she figured that they had to be here with some concerns over their youngest and their first transformation. Tad had made some mention to her that he had been offering some help based on the things that she and Jeff had done to help him through his first transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be proud of him,&quot; Jen thought to herself as she walked out and around to approach them at the front door. As she approached, she addressed them, &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Jen Decker. Is there something I can do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gary Howler,&quot; Amy&#39;s father introduced himself, &quot;You must be Tad&#39;s mother?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jen nodded, &quot;his father was a werewolf, but we had a very happy marriage until... well until his passing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re sorry to hear about that,&quot; Gary said slowly, remembering something Amy had said about Tad&#39;s father being killed and that was what brought Tad to Moon Lake, &quot;my wife, Elizabeth, and I are actually here to talk over some things with your son... things that relate to new beginnings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen looked down to the two thirteen year olds who stood close to their parents and gave a warm smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know if Tad is home, but why don&#39;t you come in and tell me about about what happened,&quot; Jen offered, &quot;after all, if this relates to their first transformation... I am just as good an expert on that with regard to Tad&#39;s first transformation as Tad is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen watched as Elizabeth and Gary gave her some mildly puzzled looks as she moved past them to open the front door. Guessing they had some puzzlement over the fact that they and Tad were werewolves and she was a werecat she decided to finish her comment.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this isn&#39;t something that is species specific,&quot; Jen spoke, &quot;the things my husband, Jeff, and I did to help Tad would work with ANY were, regardless of their species.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The ride home from his grandmother&#39;s home was calm and even fun. Tad was privately grateful that his grandmothers didn&#39;t decide to raise any embarrassing stories about Tad the way they had with his mother when he&#39;d first met Vivian and Karen Teller. They seemed to approve of Amy which Tad felt was good and that was really all that mattered. They arrived at the Decker house to find it quiet, but Tad noticed that the garage door was open and there were some lights that could be seen on inside the home.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess your mom had some adventures,&quot; Amy commented to Tad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably putting things in order to get a job,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;Tad will be going to college after High School, and with all of us being weres, it&#39;ll be centuries before we&#39;re actually old. She&#39;ll need work for the immediate future at least...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unless the secret comes out and we&#39;re accepted,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;though...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unlikely,&quot; Vivian commented, &quot;while the acceptance of weres is certainly possible, the nincompoops in government don&#39;t want tax dollars going to pay for benefits to Normals who will be lucky to see one hundred. It&#39;s therefore impossible for them to agree to pay for a were that can potentially live four hundred years, depending on their lifestyle and what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s not get into THAT, dear,&quot; Karen chided to her wife as they parked and let the engine idle to let Tad and Amy out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the ride, grandma,&quot; Tad said as he came up to the driver&#39;s side window.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Karen smiled, &quot;say hi to your mother for us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nice to see you and to meet your girlfriend,&quot; Vivian commented, &quot;you picked yourself quite the looker.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tad managed a blush which made Amy giggle a bit when she noticed it. Karen and Vivian waved to both and then backed out of the driveway to head back to their own home. With that, Tad and Amy moved to head inside. From there they could start on their homework and Amy could make her way home for dinner or when her parents wanted her home, though she hadn&#39;t gotten a text message from them yet on when that would be. They entered the Decker house together and found that text messages weren&#39;t necessary. Sitting on the couch were Gary and Elizabeth Howler with Jay and Leon on the floor near their feet. Jen was seated in a chair to the right of the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I took Amy to grandmas&#39; after school... let them meet her,&quot; Tad slowly toward his mother, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m late.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen blinked, &quot;You&#39;re not late... and I&#39;m sure my moms were both thrilled to see you meet with those you&#39;ve made friends with...&quot;<br />
<br />
She then paused and gestured to Jay and Leon, &quot;And it would appear that these two began having the pre-transformation dreams last night...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jay and Leon looked down, shying away as Amy gave them a concerned look. She knew that Tad had offered to help and had provided ideas that would help them make their way into were society without turning to sex and thus allowing them to grow up and find out who they were attracted to in their own time. Tad&#39;s offer of help had given both Amy and her parents assurance that her brothers wouldn&#39;t decide to essentially do it with each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while it will take a few days for those dreams to fully manifest... likely by this weekend,&quot; Jen commented, &quot;it will be a good idea to start putting a plan together for it.&quot;</p>
