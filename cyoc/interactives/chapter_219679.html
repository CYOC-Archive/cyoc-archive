<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a few minutes of crying, Jenny managed to control herself, sitting up straight on her bed and wiping away her tears. She was not done trying yet, her persistence pushing her forward.<br />
<br />
She stood up, losing her balance for a split second due to her new center of gravity, and went to the Chronivac. She unplugged it from the computer before replugging, hoping that it’ll fix itself. Not seeing results, she then did the same for the computer’s power cable.<br />
And the Chronivac turned on.<br />
“Yes!” Jenny yelled as she opened the app on the computer and managed to see her stats.<br />
And, as suspected, they were just like what she made for her sister Emily (she didn’t realize that, but Emily’s original name was actually Jamie, changing in one of the malfunctions and affecting the memories of both). Which eventually turned into her now brother Emile.<br />
Jenny’s stats were indeed, like what was done with Emily’s, a 10 year old girl with a head fit for her age but otherwise with stats of an attractive 20 year old woman - 5’5, DD cup breasts and a curvy body to match.<br />
And Emile’s stats were like Jeff’s original, of a fairly average 16 year old boy.<br />
<br />
The young girl with an adult body tried to change her stats, but failed to do so.<br />
“Alert, Chronivac damaged”, the computer screen read. “Unable to apply changes. May stats be reverted for ___ ‘Jenny’___?”<br />
“Oh come on!” The girl cried. “It’s not fair!”<br />
And now she was conflicted. That broken “fixing” is what brought her into this mess in the first place. Was she really going to risk it to try and hopefully get back to normal?<br />
Yes, she was.<br />
<br />
Approving the reversion of the changes, Jenny watched in horror as another message appeared. “Error. Data corrupted. Filling gaps on original form with former changes”.<br />
Although scared, as the girl started inspecting the updated stats she was going to turn into, it didn’t start off too bad.<br />
The age was 12. It may not be her original 16, but it’s still closer than 10 years old.<br />
The frown returned when she saw the gender as female. She won’t be turning back to Jeff…<br />
“Wait, what the…” Jenny saw the rest of her stats constantly changing. And then, a large message popped on the computer screen, one that prevented her from doing anything in the Chronivac. “Warning! Applying changes! Outside interaction with app temporarily disabled”.<br />
<br />
“Shit” was all Jenny could say before she felt the tingle go over her body once more. Her breasts ballooned in size while her ass tried to keep up, her curves became more extreme and her height rose as her legs and torso got longer. With her point of view and her curves changing so quickly, she ended up falling on her huge breasts - as they continued to get larger.<br />
After the changes finished, the Chronivac shut off once more.<br />
<br />
“Nooooo!!!” she nearly cried once again, barely holding herself. She fought against the weight of her new titanic tits, using arms that felt far too long to push herself out of the floor, and then stood up… and up… and up… far more than she expected.<br />
“What the hell? How tall am I?” She asked herself as she stood up straight. If she had to guess from the close proximity of the ceiling, her height was probably around 7 feet tall. Maybe even more…<br />
Trying to look down at her body, her view was obstructed by the giant pair or breasts, stretching out her struggling dress while showing an amount of cleavage that shouldn’t be possible.<br />
Even without seeing it, she felt that the rest of her body bellow the boobs changed, becoming even bigger and sexier. And her legs felt long. Really really long…<br />
<br />
Looking around her room, Jenny saw that it changed, not just because of her elevated point of view. The pink paint was replaced with a plain white and most of the dolls and toys disappeared. The bed meanwhile was replaced with one far longer. It looked like one for an older girl. Was she now 12 like the Chronivac said it will “fix”?<br />
<br />
She had to see herself.<br />
Jenny started walking towards her parents’ room, slowly and carefully due to all of the jiggling from her curves. Only to end up hitting her forehead on her own bedroom’s doorframe… She fell backwards, landing on the cushioning of her giant butt, and felt as her titan tits jiggled wildly, moving so much that she heard her a tear from the dress, further opening the window of cleavage and showing that the boobs were even larger than she thought. But somehow it didn’t feel that painful. Maybe even slightly pleasurable?<br />
“What the hell is going on with my freak of nature body?” Jenny asked herself as she slowly stood back up and carefully went to her parent’s bedroom, this time bending down under the doorframes.<br />
<br />
Finally reaching her destination, the mirror, the girl found out that she was so tall that while standing straight, she only saw her body up to her gigantic breasts. Each of those tits probably had more than double the breast flesh than both her boobs had combined before this change.<br />
And now, she saw that said boobs were indeed a part of an insane body. A body that looked like someone’s overexaggerated wet dream.<br />
Bellow her boobs she had a very slender waist and an extreme hourglass figure. It shouldn’t have been possible for such a skinny body to hold such titanic boobs. But here it happens…<br />
While not as big as the globes on her chest, her ass was still enormous and far bigger than before. Her torso was long, but her limbs elongated even more so… her legs were at least four and a half feet long.<br />
<br />
Bending down, finally looking at her face, the Jenny was greeted by a face that didn’t match her oversized and oversexed body. The face looked older than it did before - like a 12 year old’s, which meant that the new age stated in the Chronivac before it shut off again was probably correct.<br />
“I may be a giant freak, but at least I’m not a 10 year old giant freak…” She tried to assure herself. “But not 16 either…” She was on the verge of crying, but she managed to prevent it, presumably because of the older age.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, Jenny started heading back into her room, still trying to get the hang of her new balance with boulders for breasts and stilts for legs. As she moved through the hallway, she noticed someone going upstairs, approaching her. She recognized him as her new older brother Emile, formerly her younger sister Emily. He looked so short from her new point of view, despite his stated height from the Chronivac earlier being 5’10…<br />
“Jenny, are you alright? I heard a lot of noises from downstairs”. He asked. But he didn’t just look at Jenny in the eyes. His eyes were constantly darting between her face and the two bags of flesh at his eye level, unable to avoid looking at the huge boobs despite them belonging to his “little” sister.<br />
“Ye…yes, I’m fine…” she answered. “Nothing to worry about” she lied.<br />
“If you insist…” he replied. In his mind, she was already 12. She didn’t need to be watched 24/7. “I’ll be back downstairs if you need me”.<br />
<br />
After Emile took some distance, he turned back once more for a glance before leaving, and during said glance Jenny noticed how his pants were tight… he was turned on by her looks, as much as he tried to hide it in shame…<br />
“Great… so I made my little sister hot to ogle at her and ended up being the little sister in the equation, except even more sexualized…” She quietly said to herself. “Perhaps I deserve this…”<br />
<br />
Entering back into her room (bending down through the doorframe), Jenny saw that her printer actually printed something. Carefully bending down to grab the paper, making sure to not fall due to her giant breasts, she picked it up with her long and skinny fingers. It read:<br />
————————————<br />
Chronivac report:<br />
Malfunction shut app down. Emergency mode printing used to show user changes.<br />
<br />
Following changes done in __Reversion Mode__:<br />
- Age reverted to earlier stated stat - 12. Body altered accordingly.<br />
- ERROR: Repeated physical changes of previous use in __height__ and __bust__<br />
<br />
(Statistics)<br />
<br />
*Note - Text can only be read by subjects with the awareness setting set to active. All other beings see a blank paper.<br />
————————————<br />
<br />
Jenny read the note in shock, realizing the situation she got herself into.<br />
Her age was changed to 12, presumably because it was one of the results of an earlier malfunction. But despite being originally edited as such, her lower body wasn’t regarded as 20 years old - it was regarded that as of a ten year old with a far too developed body.<br />
So the Chronivac aging her up ended up extending the growth relative to what she already matured until then, with height and curves that shouldn’t be possible for that age.<br />
And then it added even more to the height and boobs to make it nearly impossible for any human being…<br />
<br />
Looking at her new statistics on the paper, the oversexualized statuesque girl noted the two main insanities:<br />
“Height: 7’2” she read in shock. “No wonder the everything looked so short…”<br />
“Cup size: 30N. What the hell…” She touched her titanic tits, and ended up feeling slight pleasure from it. “And to be so big yet so young my body must have been pumped with too much growth hormones. Which is probably what made these far too sensitive…”<br />
<br />
Tears ended up once again filling her eyes, as she threw herself on the bed. Her giant breasts jiggled for what felt like forever afterwards, a mix of pain and pleasure. Her legs were so long that they reached past the end of the bed.<br />
“I’m a freak. A huge sexy freak…” she started crying once again. At least not as badly as last time…<br />
“Am I stuck this way now?”</p>
