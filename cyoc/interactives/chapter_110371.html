<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Principal Andrews call an emergency school assembly once we and his faculty received the Were-Alert on their phones. Seeing every student in the gym bleachers, minus those that were officially absent; Principal Andrew begins to speak.<br />
“For those that are familiar what was just sent to your phones; you know what to do. For the rest that are unfamiliar with what a Were-Alert means, I’ll give you the short version.” Principal Andrews pauses to see were and normal alike assemble listen to his words; “No gatherings of any kind, no extracurricular activities. Any activity that that’s place outside is cancelled. Until the were-Alert has been lifted, school is being called off and you are being let out early.”<br />
<br />
A large sound of applause and cheers can be heard from the student body; Yet Principal Andrews was not going to let the celebration continue. With a shrill whistle through the microphone to get everybody’s attention he continues.<br />
<br />
“You WILL head straight home and you WILL stay inside. Your parents if they are able will be assisting the Sheriff Cooper and his deputies in tracking down the rogue were.”<br />
“Who is the rogue,” A student shouting.<br />
“Julie Stovall,” Principal Andrews answers.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
“So that is what a Were-Alert means,” William reading the pamphlet he received from Samantha Twist back when they first move to Moon Lake. “A rogue were is on the loose.”<br />
“Do you think we will have to help track this rogue down,” Martha shouting while in Eric’s room collecting the belonging that Spencer and Frieda left behind.<br />
“We’ll find out after we head to the council building,” William answering; “don’t forget to get a change of clothes for Eric while you’re up there. No reason for Eric to head to school tomorrow, wearing what he wore today.”<br />
“That’s assuming there is school tomorrow,” Martha running back downstairs with several bags full of belongings. “Do we know who the rogue were is,” Martha asking?<br />
“No,” William looking at his phone; “I got no particulars. But let me text Nate, I want him to head straight home. Forget dropping of Spencer’s stuff at the Knight Estate. She can collect it tomorrow.”<br />
“Sensible ideal husband,” Martha shoving the bags in the back seat; “You don’t think he is going to join the search party now do you?”<br />
“Not if I have any say,” William getting in his car; “he better head straight home just like I texted. I don’t want him to come to any harm or getting into any trouble.”<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Nate just getting into his car as school was let out early. Not having to be in detention for his Friday hooky stint was a plus as the students were rapidly ushered to the buses a sent home. Seeing the text from his father just as Ben and Alex pile in makes him feel somewhat relieved.<br />
“I won’t be heading over the the Knight estate,” Nate speaks up as he starts driving home.<br />
“Why were you planning to go there,” Ben asking.<br />
“Spencer left her stuff in my car as she had a bit of a freak out this morning,” Nate answers; Her phone, keys and what ever else is in her purse.”<br />
“Oh yeah,” Alex speaking; “I heard of what happened this morning. Want to shed some light on it?”<br />
“All I know,” Nate sighing; “is it has something to do with Spencer feeling Eric and Frieda in some form of distress and a compulsive desire to be with them.”<br />
“Woman’s intuition,” Alex looking perplexed; “is that what you’re saying?”<br />
“It’s what I know,” Nate sighing; “and it’s not much.”<br />
“Well with this were-alert,” Ben grumbling; “I guess our catch and release hunt is called off.”<br />
“And I was looking forward to seeing you chase down a buck,” Alex placing a hand on Ben’s thigh.<br />
“Can you two wait to fondle each other after I drop you off,” Nate blanching; “you can screw each other senseless at Ben’s place for all I care, just don’t start your disgusting memory in my car.” Nate smiling; “I’m saving this piece of shit for my own rutting memories.” <br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Back in the council reading room; Eric, Frieda and Spencer were having another bout of love making. This time Spencer was feeling, Eric’s barbed feline shaft in her vaginal tunnel, all the while she was eating Frieda’s sex out. Enjoying the thrusting, from Eric as he mounts her; Spencer just buries her muzzle in Frieda’s leaking snatch, while Frieda is busy licking Spencer’s juices as the traily down Eric’s furry scrotum. With each taking pleasure in each other’s ministration’s; it wasn’t long before the three exploded in unison with their respective orgasms. Tails thrashing about as they purred and growled in pleasure; sharing in each other’s afterglow.<br />
<br />
“So is that your favorite sexual position,” Benton announcing himself; “or did you just discover it?”<br />
“Father,” Frieda looking surprised as she is stuck underneath Eric and Spencer; “when did you get here?”<br />
“You father and I,” Amanda also witnessing the love Frieda had with Eric and Spencer; “came as soon as we received a Were-Alert.”<br />
<br />
Pulling out; Eric illicited another moan from Spencer as his barbs still dug in spencer, stimulate her some more. Helping Spencer up to a chair as his member is still on full display to the were-panther Knights, as Frieda gets up to stare at her intruding parents. <br />
“Really,” Frieda huffs; “did you not hear us, you could have waited before barging in.”<br />
“Tell that to your mother,” Benton shaking his head.<br />
“My statement was for both of you,” Frieda not amused.<br />
“Fine,” Amanda sighing; “next time we’ll knock.”<br />
<br />
“Frieda and Spencer like to alternate being on the bottom and in the middle,” Eric answering Benton’s earlier question; “but yeah it is a favorite sexual position for us.”<br />
Amanda stares at Eric Anderson; seeing that he is what Benton said. A pure white were-panther with just a subtle hint of brown on his head; the green eyes that he has, made the young were look menacing if the situation warranted. But seeing no anger in the eyes, Amanda looks to stare at Spencer Lawson. Seeing she has the same green eyes; but getting that confusing scent of werewolf/panther/feline hybrid from her. Amanda stares at the black furred hybrid a little longer before looking at her daughter once again. Frieda a grey furred were-panthress with russet highlights. Noticing her daughter also had the same shade of eyes.<br />
“Even father thought it was spooky,” Frieda smiling; “when he saw us together in our fursonas.”<br />
“Children of the Dammed spooky,” Benton remarks; “I won’t deny that your new eyes are unnerving. Is this part of that bond you three have?”<br />
“That and we can sense each others emotions,” Spencer speaking up.<br />
“Yes,” Amanda sighing; “Tachibana filled us in after you had a feeling? All the way on the other side of town?”<br />
“Amanda,” Benton sighing; “let it go. We agreed to it. Yes we’ll never understand it, but what’s done is done.”<br />
“Fine,” Amanda giving Benton the look; “but don’t you think your parents will find it odd that their granddaughter is in a three-way relationship?”<br />
“Hey,” Frieda speaking; “I’m right here. If you intend to have a conversation about me, you better dam well include me in it.”<br />
“Mom and dad would just laugh,” Benton grinning; “especially if they see you cringe in discomfort when you hear these three rutting later tonight. You know how they won’t pass up a chance to bust your chops.”<br />
“Joy,” Amanda rolling her eyes; “can we change the subject now?”<br />
<br />
“I’m afraid that won’t be possible,” a werewolf attendant speaking; “Eric and Frieda’s presence is requested in the council chamber. A verdict has been reached.”</p>
