<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beryl could barely contain her excitement at school.  Now here was the chance to live out her fantasy, and grow into a tall beauty.  <br />
<br />
She thought that she really should thank Kyle in some way when she got home.  Well, in addition to curing him of his curse.  Kyle was such a worrywart. Even with his curse, as long as you knew the rules, you could use it to your advantage and really improve yourself.  She thought about swiping some clothes from one of the jocks at school, so Kyle could get a buff body.  Or maybe some underwear from Jeff, the kid with the large dick.  Yeah, she thought, Kyle might change his mind about his curse if he got a cock like that.  She decided that she just might do that to thank him.<br />
<br />
Beryl&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of her boyfriend, John.  She dearly loved John - he was great guy, with a hot body.  But he was tall.  Kissing him was a chore, as she had to stretch up, while he had to stretch down.  She had tried making out with him, but it had been uncomfortable.  Now, she hoped with a little more growth, that might not be a problem.<br />
<br />
Beryl wasn&#39;t sure exactly how tall she wanted to get.  That was part of the reason she wanted to go to school, rather than stay at home and just use Jeff as her source of growth.  She wanted to test her new height in action, and see how tall she needed to be to feel comfortable in a social environment, like school.  But seeing her tall boyfriend bending down awkwardly to kiss her once again, she knew she wanted to be taller than 5&#39;4&quot;.<br />
<br />
This time when she made contact, she felt herself change.  It wasn&#39;t an all powerful, overwhelming sensation.  Just a slight tugging and pulling, like stretching a muscle before you exercise.  It was over in just a few seconds.  John looked at her oddly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that was different, &quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? &quot; asked Beryl, innocently.<br />
<br />
&quot;That kiss felt different.  Did you learn a new trick or something?  You haven&#39;t been practicing on any other guys have you? &quot; said John, jokingly.<br />
<br />
Beryl blushed, and looked up at him.  Their height difference was smaller, but she still wanted more.  She needed to be taller.  John looked at her with a strange expression on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something different about you?  You look different somehow, but I just can&#39;t put my finger on what it is, &quot; said John<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t have time to get properly dressed, so I had to borrow some of my brother&#39;s clothes, &quot; said Beryl.  She had expected to grow a lot more, and didn&#39;t want to destroy any clothes.  So, she borrowed one of Kyle&#39;s shirts, and was wearing a pair of his shoes.  He didn&#39;t have any pants, so she had to settle from some of her Mom&#39;s large sweat pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the matter?  Don&#39;t you find me attractive? &quot; she said coyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.  Whatever you&#39;ve done, I like it.  I just can&#39;t shake this strange feeling that I am missing something, &quot;said John.<br />
<br />
Beryl grabbed him by the shirt, and pulled him in close for another kiss.  &quot;Well, maybe this will jog your memory, &quot; she said, as she closed her eyes and gave him another kiss.  Beryl felt the change again.<br />
<br />
When she opened her eyes,  she was happy to see that their height difference was now much smaller.  It would be much easier to kiss him now.  But she wanted even more.  She was about to kiss him again, when her friend Sarah showed up.<br />
<br />
Sarah was a good friend, but Beryl was very jealous of her.  She was tall, almost as tall as her boyfriend John, and she secretly resented her for it.  She was always complaining about the problems with being so tall - how hard it was to find clothes, to find a nice guy - and frequently told Beryl how lucky she was to be so short.  It made her sick, but since she was a loyal friend, she never said anything about it to her.  Now, she was aggravated by her interruption.  She needed to keep changing, but she didn&#39;t want her friend to notice and screw everything up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, guys, what&#39;s up? Getting started early, I see, &quot; said Sarah, smiling at their kiss.  She looked at them, strangely.  &quot;Hey, is there something different about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I was saying, &quot; said John.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am wearing baggy clothes, &quot; said Beryl.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.  I meant John.  Something looks off about him, &quot; she said, examining him closely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, come to think of it, my clothes do feel baggy, too, &quot; he said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Sarah didn&#39;t smile, just continued to stare at him.  Then her eyes suddenly widened, as she realized what the difference was.  &quot;John, you look shorter.  I used to have to look up to you.  Now, we are eye level.  Look, &quot; she said, as she stood in front of him, looking eye to eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, &quot; said John. &quot;You can&#39;t shrink.  You must be wearing heels.  Or maybe you had a growth spurt last night.  Maybe you&#39;re the one that changed.  What do you think, Beryl?&quot;<br />
<br />
John and Sarah looked at Beryl, and saw that she was pale white. <br />
<br />
&quot;Beryl, are you okay?&quot; asked John with concern.  He moved forward to hold her hand, but she jumped back when he came near.  John was surprised by her reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, just feeling a little sick to my stomach.  I think I need to go to the nurse, &quot; she said, as she took off away from her friends.<br />
<br />
The truth was that she was horrified.  She now knew exactly how the curse worked.  Kyle had said that she would gain one inch in height from every person she touched. She had thought that she would simply grow one inch every time she touched someone.  Now she realized that she would actually take one inch from someone if she touched them.  Kyle had stayed the same height because he was wearing Beryl&#39;s pants. Every inch she stole from him, was immediately retuned to fulfill the demands of his curse to be an exact duplicate of Beryl.  <br />
<br />
Now, she realized the full implications of what she had done.  She had gained two inches, raising her height to 5&#39;6&quot;, but at the cost of shrinking her boyfriend John by two inches.  She was beginning to think that maybe Kyle was right - the curse is too dangerous to play around with.  Maybe it was time for her to go home.</p>
