<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking at this book, Josh soon realized that by writing this book would turn imagination into reality.  Think of the possibilities.  He can alter the world into whatever he likes.  He can turn anyone to what he dream of.  He can even change himself into what he wants to be.  After thinking about his options, he came up with a real good one.<br />
<br />
In history, Josh’s favorite part of it was the one about the Fountain of Youth.  From what he could understand, an explorer named Ponce de Le&oacute;n was in charge of finding the fountain in the 16th century.  Though he set out on his exploration, he didn’t return.  Some people said that he died trying to search for it.  Others believe he had found it and made a settlement there, never to return home again.  Other then those assumptions, Le&oacute;n’s search for the fountain would go down in history as a legendary story.<br />
<br />
As he remembers that, an idea hits Josh in the head.  What if the fountain was real?  What if someone besides Le&oacute;n discovered it?  What if that someone revealed it to the world and instantly the world was youthful without any fear of dying from old age or disease?  What if it’s Josh and his family?  Thinking all of this, Josh had always dreamed of a world where everyone is young and beautiful.  Where people will never age past thirty or die of old age.  Where they can decide how young they want to be, whether they want to be young adults, teenagers, children, babies, or living inside the womb.  It would be a dream come true.  Knowing what he should do, Josh took out his pencil and began writing.  This is what he wrote down…<br />
<br />
‘I wish this world would be a youthful world.  That the Fountain of Youth exists today.  And that my family would have discovered it and reveal it to the world.  The world would have areas like Fountain of Youth spas and Youth water bottles so they can relax and let the years melt away.  There will be some details about the Fountain of Youths effects.<br />
<br />
For example, bathing in the youth water and drinking a youth bottle might have some different changes.  When you bathe in the Fountain of Youth, you would loose a year every half an hour depending on how long will you stay in it.  Drinking the youth water is entirely different.  For instance, one gulp of the water will make you loose a month.  Drinking half the bottle will let people loose a year.  But if they drink the whole thing, they will loose two years.  So depending on how many bottles they bought, they have to be careful on how many bottles will consume.<br />
<br />
Another great example would be to a rule in the world involving when be young again.  See, there will be an age range between zero, which is newborn status, and thirty.  And no matter how old they really are, they need to be between that aging range.  If anyone reaches the age of thirty, they could either head to the spa or drink a bottle of youth water.  They could even us both those things even between the age range just so they can feel a little younger.<br />
<br />
There will be other things to add on as well.  Like for the older people, they will still attain their memories and education from their adulthood.  So even though they might be in their teens or childhood, they will still keep their jobs cause they will still have the knowledge and behavior in their minds.  Of course, if the older people regress past sixteen, they aren’t allowed to drive.  If they are going to go to work, they need to take transport with Ids telling the driver that they have regressed passed that age, or have someone in the family drive them to their job.<br />
<br />
One more thing I need to add before I finish this.  As far as families go, any wedded couple will have two children either by pysical birth or adoption.  But the one thing that would be different is that they won’t make out or have sex to create a baby.  See, if people have sex, more babies will appear and the population would be over pact.  So instead, they will give birth to someone who wants to regress to the point they are pass birth.  If they can accept it of course.  First they need to sign a petition that explains why he or she wants to regress past birth, any family or friends that need to know about it, any job he or she works for, and how far back he or she wants to go back through pregnancy.  There will be a wing in every hospital involving regressing the person but to bring him or her past birth and into her future mother, complete with tubs filled with youth water.  But unlike the spas, the tubs water has been alter and would make the person regress one year every five minutes.  Once he or she reach newborn status, the future mother will enter the tub and the newborn baby would go into the womb and remain there until they are reborn again.  Same goes with adopting.  They need to sign the same petition and take the baths in the hospital wing to regress to whatever age is the youngest, like between the ages of one to ten.<br />
<br />
As far as that is concern, what I truly want is to live in a youthful world.  A world where everyone won’t grow old or die due to age or sickness.  I want to live in this world and live in it for the rest of my life.  Please…  Make my wish come true.’<br />
<br />
When Josh finished writing what he needs to say, he slowly closed the book.  The moment he did that, something strange just happened.  All around him, he saw posters of authors and actors in recent years growing younger until they were young adults in their mid twenties.  All around him, he saw professors and families with children grow young around him.  Most look like they were in their twenties wearing suits and blouses that match their ages.  Others were teenagers that were enjoying their youthening spirits.  Hell, he saw one father and son at the age of ten, look more like twins.  He sort of finds that a little hilarious.  But there was one thing that caught his attention and that was the librarian.<br />
<br />
She was a very old woman in her 80s with gray and white hair in a beehive style.  She was also wearing an older conservative blouse and vest with a long tube skirt that go down her knees and old women’s glasses to see.  She was very old school and wasn’t much sexy.  But that all soon changed as she started to regress right before his eyes.<br />
<br />
Downward she went as she through her 80s, 70s, and 60s.  Her really skinny body began to plump up and her hair was looking less white and grayer.  55, 50, 45, 40…  She was slowly regaining all of her youth.  Her body went from skinny to really chubby, being that she uses to gain some weight during her middle age.  At the same time, her breasts, which were completely deflated, were beginning to pump up and was regaining its luster.  The wrinkles on her face seem to get less and less and the jowls look a little less flabby.  Her hair was completely gray with no white to come while her beehive began to unravel.  38, 36, 34, 32, 30…  All of her elderly features were immediately disappearing.  She was now beginning to loose weight, but in a good way.  Her muffin top slowly deflated and her curves were slowly returning.  The varicose veins on her arms and legs were disappearing and her skin went from rugged and rough to completely smooth.  Her breasts were expanding completely and rising higher and higher until they were set just right.  Her face was youthening by the second to as her wrinkles turned into faint lines around her eyes and mouth.  Her eyes were looking less tired as the circles around them began to fade away.  Even her hair was making drastic changes as more strands of gray turned to blond, her original hair color.  Her beehive was completely unraveled as her hair grew long and went down the middle of her back.  28, 26, 24, 22…  After five minutes, the Liberian turned from an old woman into a sexy young adult around Josh’s age, which was twenty.  Her body was completely busty in all dimensions with a round butt, a curvy hourglass, athletically toned arms and legs, and a pair of CC cup breasts that were round and bouncy.  Her face was at her prime with no wrinkles to speak of, brightly blue colored eyes, kissable lips, and a smooth complexion.  Even her hair was sleek and shiny with no gray hair anywhere in the blonde tresses.  Her clothes remain conservative, but it has been alter to match her younger body.  Her blouse was so sexy that there was a V-neck on the top to show off her huge breasts.  Her skirt went way over her knees and it’s to short that you could actually see her panties as she was sitting.  The short skirt also showed off her legs as she crossed them back and forth.  Even her long blonde hair, which went down close to her rear, had a lower pony tail to make her look a little more professional, if not sexy.<br />
<br />
Looking at her, Josh was impressed by the metamorphosis and was happy with the results.  Looking down at the book, he awkwardly kissed it and thanked it for the wish.  He also decided to keep the book incase someone else finds it and use it for their own endeavors.  So he picked the book up and placed it in his book bag, making sure no one didn’t see him taking it.  He then walked up to the librarian and was about to reach the exit.  But as he was about to reach it, the librarian turned to him and said hi.<br />
<br />
“Hey there Josh.” she said in a sultry voice.  Josh turned to her and was a little nervous being that he has the book with him in his school bag.  He then waved to her and said, “Uh…  Hi there Ms. Watson.”  The librarian cocked an eyebrow and said, “Please…  Ms. Watson makes me sound like I’m old.  I mean, I am 84 but I now have a youthful body of a young adult.  So please, call me Jane.”  Josh looked at her and smiled saying, “Oh of course Ms. Wats-  Er-  I mean Jane.”  With that conversation out of the way, Jane asked him for a favor.  “So Josh, are you going to take me out for tonight?  I’m off work early and I thought that maybe we go out together to the movies or something.  I mean since you and your family discovered the Fountain of Youth, you are the ultimate playboy.  So what do you say?  You want to have some fun?”  Josh was feeling a little nervous, but he could tell that she wanted him so badly.  So he responded in a kind manner, “Hmm…  I would love too.  But I need to study for class.  Don’t worry; I’ll let you know if I finish early.”  That brought a smile to Jane’s face as she said, “That sounds great.  Now you know the library’s phone number.  Call me when you are done early.”  With that said, she put her lips on her hand and blew him a kiss.  Josh felt a little flushed as he waved back at her and left the library without her knowing he took the book from the library.<br />
<br />
As he left the library, he looked around the outside and was amazed by everything around him.  All over the streets, he saw children, teenagers, and young adults walking around, driving, working, enjoying their meals, and shopping, but no sign of the elderly or senior citizens.  In fact, he saw a billboard that was advertising a bottled water that says, ‘Drink away all you years.  Try Youth Spring Today!”  Josh was pleased with his wish thanks to the book and wanted to know how much the world he created changed.  So what did he do first?</p>
