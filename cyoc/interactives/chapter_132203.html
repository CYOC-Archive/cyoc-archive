<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa was calmly enjoying her breakfast and she continued to eat her cereal and slurp up the milk that she&#39;d poured in the bowl as she did so. In many ways it was a normal morning. The only thing that was different for either of them was that her father had become a weretiger and she had recently become a werecow. There was some concern on her father&#39;s part over the fact that Alice Decrux had drugged her with Love Potion Number Nine and over whether or not Trevor was a gentlemen or not. However, the were issue aside, that was actually pretty normal with regard her dad protecting her, though now that he had Virginia McCoy in his life, he seemed happier again and protecting her wasn&#39;t coming off as over protective. That actually made Melissa happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;re good with me and Virginia getting married at say... the end of the coming week?&quot; Harold asked slowly looking across the breakfast table to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly fine,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I might need some bigger formal wear... though over the next few years, and until I turn eighteen... I may grow out of a lot of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold slowly nodded. He&#39;d grown out of a lot of his clothing after becoming a weretiger with much of what he&#39;d had when they first come to Moon Lake only barely fitting him and wasn&#39;t really comfortable. And while he might not have his own classes starting until the Spring Semester, it would make sense to have clothing he could wear that would fit him and was broken in by that time, particularly as he&#39;d probably need to get his office set up and have his lecture schedules ready. He really didn&#39;t want to be breaking in new clothes while trying to give lectures at the same time. <br />
<br />
And he remembered that Trevor in his fursona looked to be about as Harold did in his. This would mean that Melissa would likely grow a lot when she transformed. Now, it seemed as though the Tyson Family had provided Melissa with some everyday clothes, which was perfectly fine, and they&#39;d need to thank them for doing so, but Melissa would still need some formal wear for the wedding. As he looked to his daughter, Harold was soon also reminded that she was only fifteen and wouldn&#39;t turn sixteen till next spring, and with the knowledge that cattle were bigger than tigers in mind, he soon reasoned that Melissa likely wasn&#39;t done growing. But, in a way, that was a normal thing to handle. Melissa had outgrown many clothes over the years, and trying to get her into the things he and Eliza had dressed her in when she was five would be ridiculous. The only thing that would be different now would be the sizes of the clothing Melissa would need.<br />
<br />
&quot;That may mean a trip out to Seattle to see if they have some formal wear at their stores there... if any are open on a Sunday,&quot; Harold said slowly, &quot;If not... that may mean doing it after school during the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhh!&quot; Melissa answered in a teasing voice, &quot;an excursion.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know that tone,&quot; Harold rolled his eyes, &quot;we won&#39;t be going store to store to store for random stuff. It&#39;ll be strictly to get what you&#39;ll need for the wedding and to come back, especially if the trip ends up being on a weekday, as you&#39;ll have homework.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa only chuckled and shook her head. She could hear a slightly humorous tone in her father&#39;s voice there and enjoyed it. She took it as a sign that he was coming out of the mourning that he&#39;d been in for her mother. She understood her father&#39;s mourning, as she loved and missed her mom too, but that didn&#39;t mean she wanted her dad to live his life being unhappy. And while becoming a weretiger wasn&#39;t the expected cure, Melissa wasn&#39;t going to complain. She liked Virginia and was happy that Virginia made her father happy, that was all that mattered.<br />
<br />
As she finished her cereal, she noticed her father standing up. He walked around the breakfast table for a moment and patted her shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;ll remember to keep your focus on school work and so on?&quot; Harold asked to her, his tone of voice serious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, dad,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and I&#39;ll remember my pill too. You don&#39;t need to worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold&#39;s only answer was to ruffle Melissa&#39;s hair that earned a protesting &quot;hey&quot; before continuing on. He glanced over his shoulder to see Melissa straightening her hair and said, &quot;Good girl... anyway... I do have a surprise for you. Wait there and I&#39;ll bring it down.&quot;<br />
<br />
That actually intrigued Melissa greatly. She&#39;d had a great interest in Trevor, at least as a friend, though that had been quickly blossoming into romance and they&#39;d essentially made it official with her entrance into were society, but she didn&#39;t think that her father would have anything ready for that. She figured it had to be clothing related, as the only real shopping trip that her father had made recently had been to get clothing that would fit him more comfortably, which would mean that he got anything for her it would be clothing related. Her dad wasn&#39;t the sort to go out and pick up things at random. Now, he tended to be a bit less flashy than she was, but it wasn&#39;t though he had terrible taste in fashion. In this, she was extremely curious as to what it was as she heard him go upstairs and then a few moments later come back down.<br />
<br />
She turned in her chair to see her father returning with a large shopping bag in his arms. Her eyes happily focused on it as he approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I never got to wrap it and things got a bit... out of hand,&quot; Harold began as he handed the bag to Melissa, &quot;but I figured with how close you were getting to Trevor that it would be likely that at some point you would take the proverbial plunge as it were... so I thought this might be necessary.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa stood up and pulling out a large bathrobe from the bag. It was a soft crimson color with a soft and shiny material that actually glistened a bit under the kitchen lights. It wouldn&#39;t go to the floor in either her human or were forms, but it would wrap around her and keep things &quot;covered&quot; in her were form as it were. This was something that ultimately would be of use. Smaller weres like werefoxes and werecats could go to Awareness and by clothing that could stretch and &quot;change&quot; with them. It worked whenever they had to go into areas where they were in their were form but couldn&#39;t be naked, for fear that someone driving on the roads through Moon Lake might see them However, larger weres, like weretigers and werecattle, because of the great size differences between their human and were forms couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
The answer that larger weres took was an oversized robe. They&#39;d have the size to cover everything while in were form for basic modesty and would allow larger weres to be in their fursonas and be in some more public places. And Melissa actually twirled a bit as she looked at the robe as she looked at it. It might actually be a bit big on her human form at present and might even be a bit big on her in her were form, which might mean that when her dad bought it he&#39;d had something closer to her likely adult form, though that could only be a guess.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love it!&quot; Melissa declared, &quot;It&#39;s so soft and smooth!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got it when I was getting my clothing,&quot; Harold answered, &quot;and since I ended up needing a robe for me... should the weretiger meetings be in an area where a naked human might be a bit improper... I figured you might need something similar should you and Trevor end up having dates in a similar sort of situation..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After I&#39;d become a werecow,&quot; Melissa finished for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harold gave a small smile as he watched her spin with it and actually holding the robe up above her head, &quot;and I got it at a size that you may have to grow into... but I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t be a major problem...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa stopped and then paused to drape the robe over her arm. She smiled and looked to her father before turning to give him a warm hug. She held him to her and gave a gentle squeeze that she knew he could take.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; Melissa said to him, &quot;and don&#39;t worry... there WON&#39;T be any problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harold only hugged her back and gave a fatherly smile. Both of them had found themselves going though a great many changes, but at the same time, some happiness at those changes wasn&#39;t a bad thing. At the same time, there was also some happiness at the comfort with which they had with their respective changes, which was a good thing.</p>
