<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The dragons quickly ate their food, finishing it almost at the exact same time, Vrackie was seductively licking hir lips in attempts to seduce Anija. In a cold and spiteful way, the angelic dragon rolled his eyes as he looked at his rider silently eating from his plate, just like Karyu, Anija also had romantic feelings for his rider, at first before he met Vrackie, he quickly became close with his rider unlike other dragons, by just spending about ten years with him, Anija could feel his mind almost being flooded by erotic desires, most of the time he would cast multiple hypnotic spells on himself to erase those thoughts from his mind, but barelly after just a single day, those thoughts would reappear by just seeing Vaestro.<br />
<br />
Although Vrackie didn&#39;t like the idea of being some form of fae mixed with the form of a dragon, it did come with some unique powers, such as the ability to shrink hir size to microscopic levels, the ability to instantly become invisible, the ability to generate a fog that instantly makes anyone inhaling it fall into a deep sleep, the ability to create fake clones to instantly escape sticky situations and last but not least, the ability to read the thoughts of other dragons.<br />
<br />
Vrackie instantly read Anija&#39;s thoughts, hir mouth fell open for a while as it quickly shifted into a scaly smile, Anija attempted to hide his blush, by just seeing Anija covering his snout with his puffy tail and hearing Vrackie giggling, Karyu instantly got a confused look, &quot;What the hell is wrong with these two...&quot; thought Karyu.<br />
<br />
Eventually the riders finished their plates and someone quickly knocked on the door, Luka slowly got up and opened the door, it was a royal guard, &quot;Lady Luka, his highness needs you at this instant.&quot; the guard said, before leaving quickly, Luka sighed in sadness, she wanted to spend time with her children, she wanted to spend time with Karyu, but her work as a dragon rider kept her away from these things, &quot;You heard him, let&#39;s go.&quot; said Luka as she left the room, Karyu quickly followed her.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds of walking through the castle, Luka and her crew reached the throne room, where Adam,Elisa and another individual unknown to the crew were talking, &quot;Perfect timing!&quot; exclaimed Adam as he saw Luka&#39;s crew slowly heading towards them, &quot;So what&#39;s the mission now boss?&quot; asked Vaestro as he crossed his arms, while also looking at the other man in the room, &quot;My name is Izack.&quot; the man said with a deep bow, &quot;I&#39;m the general of a kingdom not too far away from here.&quot; said Izack, by hearing this Vrackie quickly inspected the outfit of Izack, it did look like the outfit worthy of a general, &quot;And what brings you here Izack?&quot; asked Vrackie with hir adorable voice, &quot;I came here to ask for help.&quot; said Izack sharply, &quot;The kingdom is corrupt, our leader is foolish and is listening to those damned cultists.&quot; continued Izack, &quot;At first they wanted to kill me, but my dragon made a deal to instead of imprisoning me, they would imprison her.&quot; finished Izack as he looked down in sadness, Anija being an angelic drake felt the pain of Izack as if he was spiritualy linked with him, &quot;Don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll help.&quot; said Adam, the entire crew and Elisa smiled, when the two siblings finally reunited after a long time, Adam had a drastic change, he quickly became a king who also felt the pain of others, just like Anija, it was all thanks to the clarity Elisa and Anija gave to him, Adam quickly made himself sure that his kindom would become as strong as intended, without death or suffering of its citizens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could you tell us more about the kingdom?&quot; Politely asked Luka, &quot;The constructions, the guards, the citizens even.&quot; said Luka, by hearing this Izack quickly nodded, &quot;The buildings are tall, some of them are almost at the size of skyscrapers, the guards barelly get any hour of sleep, so most of them might be sleeping during their work or the time it will take for them to notice any spy or intruder will be relatively short, meanwhile the citizens and the dragons are extremly unloyal to the king, some of them won&#39;t even bother reporting you to his highness.&quot; said Izack, everyone looked at Vaestro, &quot;Although it does sound easy, the fact that some cultists might be inside the kingdom gives the possibility that i could be recognized and instantly be imprisoned.&quot; said Vaestro, &quot;But i will do it any-&quot; started Vaestro, &quot;Oh the hell you won&#39;t!&quot; said Anija,Luka and Avelia, rudely interrupting Vaestro in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; Exclaimed Vrackie as shi stretched hir mariposa-like wings, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; asked Avelia, although fae dragons have proven themselves to be excellent spies, Vrackie only entered a spy mission once in hir life, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Vrackie is a fae dragon, sneaking and stealth are always present in a fae dragon.&quot; said Karyu, when hir species changed, Vrackie instantly tried out hir new abilities, mastering them almost instantly.<br />
<br />
After careful planning, Luka and her crew went towards their airship, aboarding it as they flew towards the kingdom of Valarius.<br />
<br />
While the crew was aboard the ship, Anija,Vrackie and Karyu were inside the ship silently talking.<br />
&quot;I saw you stare quite a lot at your rider, do you have secret feelings for him?&quot; Asked Vrackie, with a sassy voice, this made Anija blush a little, he tried to think of a possible way to get out of this situation, but he couldn&#39;t, he sighed in defeat.<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, i do have... Romantic feelings for him.&quot; Said Anija, his scaly lips trembled most of the time causing a stutter.<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you confess it?&quot; Asked Karyu with a kind voice, he was always willing to help his friends in any way possible.<br />
&quot;Yeah! Confess to him your feelings, then you two can have some fun time in private!&quot; Said Vrackie, by just turning into a hermaphroditic dragon, Vrackie became much more lustful.<br />
&quot;...Vrackie, the fact that dragons with the same gender can mate together, dosen&#39;t mean that humans would enjoy having intercourses with the same gender!&quot; Protested Anija, although what he said was true, Vrackie still had ways to convince him.<br />
&quot;You could always switch back into a hen.&quot; Mentioned Vrackie, as shi gave an annoyed look on hir visage.<br />
&quot;What about our children then?&quot; Responed Anija with a question, &quot;What would they do if they didn&#39;t have a father to accompany them?&quot; asked Anija again, waiting for an answer.<br />
&quot;During my species change, your seed was....&quot; Paused Vrackie, thinking of a fitting word, &quot;Let&#39;s say that it was absorbed by my organism, so the offsprings barelly had any time to develop.&quot; said Vrackie, during the intercourse between hir and Anija, shi was the one rutting Anija, the angelic drake didn&#39;t expose the fae dragon with his seed at all, &quot;And i expected from a scholar dragon like you to know that most of the matings between dragons were made by a hermaphrodite and a female!&quot; finished Vrackie, although hermaphrodites did have female and male reproductive organs, it was common that herm dragons took the role as the male.<br />
At first Anija didn&#39;t know what to say, &quot;Well... What if he dosen&#39;t like the idea of mating a dragoness then?!&quot; suddenly asked Anija, his face almost completly red in emberassment.<br />
&quot;You can always switch from a quadrupedal to a bipedal form.&quot; Mentioned Vrackie, with a giggle.<br />
<br />
At this point, Anija gave up, Vrackie had the upper hand against the conversation, this made Anija sigh in defeat, &quot;Love has no boundries.&quot; said Karyu suddenly, this made Anija smile, &quot;Plus, Adam would be more than happy to have more Kinins in the kingdom.&quot; said Karyu, another method to create Kinins was if a male or female bipedal dragon mated with a female or male human, the idea of having children both with Vrackie and Vaestro made Anija more emberassed then he was, &quot;F-Fine, i&#39;ll confess to him my feelings.&quot; said Anija, this made Karyu and Vrackie smile.<br />
<br />
Eventually the crew reached the kingdom of Valarius, during the voyage, Vaestro changed his appearance, he dyed his long hair with a silver color, he also shaved his mustache to make himself sure he won&#39;t be recognized by the cultists that were possibly inside the kingdom, Avelia already changed her appearance before aboarding the airship, meanwhile Luka didn&#39;t need it since she didn&#39;t kill or attack any cultist as a female, the biggest problem would have been Karyu, luckily Vrackie used hir new powers to mask the presence of the dragons, including hir from the eyes of the citizens in the kingdom of Valarius, the only ones who could see them were their riders.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking through the busy streets of the kingdom of Valarius, Luka and her crew rented a private room in a rich inn, there were no neighbours nearby the private room.</p>
