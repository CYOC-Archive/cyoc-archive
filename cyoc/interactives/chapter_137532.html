<br />
---------<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be Slar.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slar, with lightning fast speed turned around and whipped out his shotgun, aiming directly at the monster’s head before it finished speaking. Mary was beside it, appearing to be completely unharmed and had a slightly annoyed look on her face, most likely because of the monster holding her prisoner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who said that?!&quot; That voice couldn&#39;t belong to Mary. And monsters don&#39;t talk. Then who said...<br />
<br />
&quot;I did.&quot; To Slar&#39;s shock, the monster spoke. It&#39;s unnatural muzzle opening and closing to match it&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the?!... Oh. I get it. Step out from behind that monster whoever you are!&quot; Slar demanded. Monsters can&#39;t speak... At least not in the books he read.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no one behind me,&quot; The monster assured, it’s muzzle visibly moving as words came out.<br />
<br />
...It took a moment for Slar to process what&#39;s happening.<br />
<br />
How did it know his name? It can&#39;t be because Mary told it his name. Why would she? In fact, she should be in tears, begging him to rescue her by now. More importantly, the thing can speak?...<br />
<br />
Slar’s head was hard at work processing this world shattering phenomenon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I get it.&quot; Slar said for the second time as he kept his aim steady at the monster&#39;s head. &quot;You&#39;re one of those sentient guardians!” He proudly declared.<br />
<br />
The guardian blinked. A moment of stunned silence passed. Then it let out a heavy sigh. &quot;Listen. I don&#39;t know your reasons for coming here, or what you intend to do, but the owner of this mansion wants us the leave her property as soon as possible. She already knows our names and I can tell that she is an extremely powerful magic user who must not be angered. You must leave this place as soon as you can.&quot; It urged.<br />
<br />
Slar stared at the guardian as coldly as possible. &quot;Funny you should say that!... I was just about to leave myself!” He bravely and loudly announced in the guardian’s emotionless face. After all, he already had found what he was looking for. A bottomless magic vacuum is not exactly what he expected as a dragon slaying weapon, but he&#39;s lucky he even found that much. <br />
<br />
But despite his gallant facade, The brave mercenary recognized the weight of the guardian’s words. Judging by the rumors around the mysterious owner of this place and the unnatural atrocities he already witnessed here, he’s inclined to believe the rumored old cloud woman is more capable then just memory erasure.<br />
<br />
Yet... He kept his gun pointed at the guardian’s face for dramatic effect...<br />
<br />
Amazingly, Mary seems unharmed. The guardian could have beaten and tortured Mary for information on it’s way here. Yet, it seems that it didn&#39;t. It’s just a hunch, but perhaps this thing has more sensibility then he initially thought. That, or Mary is a very formidable fighter for being able to defend herself from the guardian all this time. Either way is a eyebrow raiser for Slar. <br />
<br />
Maybe the guardian is like Thunderstein, that one fictional man-made monster that actually cares for life.<br />
<br />
Slar let out his rehearsed hero’s smirk. Perhaps he can save Mary after all if he can trick it to let her go?<br />
<br />
The guardian stood there for a few long moments watching Slar go though many thoughtful hero poses without saying a word. (Slar thinks best while doing hero poses.)<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were about to leave, then why not leave with us?&quot; The guardian finally mustered.<br />
<br />
Slar made sure his body language showed the beast that he already won the battle. ”I didn&#39;t say I&#39;ll be leaving with you. The only ones who will be leaving here is me and the girl. Now break those chains holding the girl hostage! If you want me to trust you even by a droplet’s length, then show me that you care for the girl’s safety.“ Slar&#39;s eyes left no room for argument.<br />
<br />
It just stood there for a few more moments of silence as if it&#39;s taking Slar&#39;s obvious attempt at tricking it seriously.  <br />
<br />
Then as if out of no were, it abruptly grabbed hold of the red chain and tried to pull them apart as hard as it could. Slar could practically see it&#39;s unnatural viney flesh snapping from the strain. It looks as though it&#39;s arms are going to fall off if it pulls any harder! How can it endure the pain of it&#39;s own flesh ripping apart! But despite how visually strained the monster seemed to be, the red chains wouldn&#39;t budge.<br />
<br />
The guardian eventually stopped. It’s body was torn in places from the strain yet they were quickly regenerating as soon as the pressure stopped. However, none of the chain links from the red cuffs were snapped. W-what are those cuffs made of!?<br />
<br />
The guardian looked Slar in the eyes. &quot;Are you satisfied now?&quot; The guardian asked.<br />
<br />
Slar totally didn&#39;t expect the guardian to listen to him. But despite the guardian’s glowing eyes looking super creepy and unnatural, Slar dealt with enough liars to recognize sincerity in someone&#39;s or something&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
But a part of Slar couldn&#39;t accept that. Slar couldn’t  stand the idea of a loose end that he can’t tie up quickly. Or in this case, a chain he can’t break. Even on the off chance that the guardian won’t hurt Mary, he can’t just let her stay here. It’s his fault that she’s chained to the guardian in the first place.<br />
<br />
...But regardless... There doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to free Mary from the magic cuffs without the key...<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know were the keys for the cuffs are?&quot; Slar desperately asked the guardian.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It&#39;s possible that the keys were never made.&quot; It answered quickly.<br />
<br />
Slar doesn&#39;t sense that it&#39;s lying...<br />
<br />
Damn!<br />
<br />
 He’ll just have to try to convince this guardian to leave it’s post and come with him for now...<br />
<br />
After a long moment of reluctance... Slar lowered his gun.<br />
<br />
It’s hard to tell with the armor and muzzle, but the guardian looked visibly relieved.<br />
<br />
Slar was on the verge on giving up on freeing Mary from the red cuffs for now...<br />
<br />
...Until a desperate idea flew into his noggin.<br />
<br />
Slar raised his gun again as he aimed towards the guardian from a distance.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-what are you doing!&quot; The guardian exclaimed in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Stay still. If neither of us can break that thing, then I’ll just shoot your arm off. It’ll just grow back.” Slar explained, aiming his shotgun with only one hand.<br />
<br />
For a few tense moments, the guardian once again stood there silently without saying a word. It’s face was unreadable. It’s eyes clouded in thought. The frost on it’s face building up.<br />
<br />
 It must be trying to figure out  another way to get rid of the cuffs. Well, Slar isn’t gonna wait for the guardian’s response. He and Mary doesn’t have all day to come up with theories.<br />
<br />
He took aim at it’s chained arm and...<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Isaac thought furiously in this cautious silence.<br />
<br />
If Isaac could let out a cold sweat, he would. But as it stands now, the best he could muster was the growing frost forming on the surface of his dark armor. <br />
<br />
In his time, he faced many corrupt monsters without, prepared for the possiblity of losing hisself in the coruption.<br />
<br />
But for once in a very long time... Isaac is scared.<br />
<br />
Isaac doesn’t mind getting his arm getting blasted off if it means freeing Mary. That’s actually a good idea. But what if that isn’t enough to gain Slar’s trust?<br />
<br />
He may have the stronger body, but he&#39;s also sure that the metal gun is strong enough to can blast a hole in his body in seconds. With that much power, it&#39;s possible for Slar to blast him beyond regeneration as well. What if Slar changes his mind and decides that his arm isn’t enough?...<br />
<br />
 Isaac felt trapped in a corner.<br />
<br />
Slar doesn’t seem to be the listening type. Regrettably, Isaac&#39;s body is not fast enough to to prevent Slar from blasting him to smithereens. Isaac may have survived being blown up by the air dragon, but that was only because Ilivir was there gather his remains together in order for him to regenerate. That last time was a miracle and he has no intention to test his ability to regenerate from near death again if possible. There&#39;s no guarantee that Mary would have the opportunity and foresight to put him back together again if Slar decides to blow him up. <br />
<br />
Isaac doesn&#39;t want to fight, but considering Slar’s behavior so far, there may be no way out of it...<br />
<br />
‘Dark Isaac was right. You don’t see the many options available to you. Why listen to this specimen when you can just absorb him? You might also gain his memories that way. You don’t need him. But his power might prove be useful.’ Sera advised.<br />
<br />
...Just a few days ago, Isaac would do just that. Back at the crypt, it was more beneficial for him to just kill or assimilate any creature that comes his way and just move on.<br />
<br />
But this time, he doesn&#39;t want to treat life as tools to empower himself or as something he needlessly needs to kill. <br />
There are other ways to handle the situation other then violence. He’s done it before. He scared those bandits away instead of just absorbing them simply by listening to that gut feeling of his.<br />
<br />
 Yet there are other times when he didn’t listen to that gut feeling like how he didn’t do anything about Azaviel until it was too late. He assumed that Ilivir’s constant masturbation sessions were just his way of suppressing the lust demon. He should have noticed the signs and check for the demon&#39;s presence in his body. Isaac knew that suppressing him in the first place was just a temporarily solution...<br />
<br />
But he was too worried about his own problems to check.<br />
<br />
Dark Isaac is right. If he just took the time to think and follow his gut feeling, he would have found ways to prevent many problems before they happened. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s time to act now. <br />
<br />
He has a vague idea on how to gain Slar’s trust and possibly prevent a fight. It’s risky and there’s no guarantees that it will work, but it’s a opportunity for a peaceful solution nonetheless. It’s better then just let events to escalate by itself.<br />
<br />
‘Hello? You still listening to us?’ Rieletta asked.<br />
<br />
But Isaac’s thoughts was far from Rieletta at the moment.<br />
<br />
Isaac steeled himself for what he&#39;s about to do.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
...Before Slar could pull the trigger, the guardian suddenly grabbed it’s own arm. <br />
<br />
What? Does it expect to protect it’s chained arm by covering it with it’s other one? Doesn’t realize that he can just shoot both of them off?<br />
<br />
But the resolve in the gaurdian’s face says otherwise. Slar has a feeling that it’s about to do something stupid.<br />
<br />
“No need. I’ll do it myself.” It said.<br />
<br />
And without even hesitating, the guardian grabbed hold of it’s chained arm and effortlessly ripped it off in an instant. Thousands of frozen plant fibers clouded the air in all directions as the guardian’s disembodied arm flew through the air.<br />
<br />
Slar totally didn&#39;t’t expect the guardian to do it itself. Perhaps it really did want to free Mary from the red cuffs?<br />
<br />
The sheer force of Isaac&#39;s arm suddenly shooting through the air caused Mary’s arm to jerk with it.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhhh!” Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Mary!” Slar shouted in concern.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Mary internally winced, not because of the intense yank on her arm... but because she could feel her own arm getting ripped off... Even though her arm is perfectly fine besides from the initial yank... Is it possible that she just felt all the pain Isaac felt when he ripped off his arm? But she tried her best to not show the pain.<br />
<br />
The severed arm landed on the ground with a thump. The red chain attaching Mary to the severed arm faded away, leaving the severed arm alone on the floor.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m free? Just like that?” Mary muttered. She does doesn&#39;t feel any different. But she can no longer physically feel the red chain on her hand anymore.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Slar opted to seize the opportunity in front of him.<br />
<br />
Before either the guardian or Mary could react, Slar grabbed Mary’s hand and rushed towards the exit. Good thing that the guardian is just standing there like a idiot.<br />
<br />
But before they can escape through the tunnel, Mary’s arm was yanked as if it was still chained, forcing the duo to stop.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong?! Let’s go!” Slar urged.<br />
<br />
Slar looked back to see Mary’s arm being pulled back in the direction of the guardian.<br />
<br />
It took Slar a mere moment to realize what’s wrong...<br />
<br />
Even though the red cuffs has faded away.... some invisible force is keeping Mary from getting too far away from that guardian.<br />
<br />
“It seems that even though the red cuffs were cut off, it still remains in a different from. It may has lost it’s physical form, but the bond it formed between us still strong as ever.” The guardian theorized.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Mary had a thoughtful expression on her face.<br />
<br />
Slar on the other hand casually put his gun back on the straps on his back, unarming himself in the process...<br />
<br />
But before the guardian could look relieved again, Slar armed himself with that magical vacuum he found earlier.<br />
<br />
“If taking off the cuffs won’t free Mary, then the only other thing I can do is getting rid of what she is anchored too!” Slar shouted his intentions.<br />
<br />
He knew his material pellets wouldn&#39;t be enough to kill the guardian, so instead, he discreetly prepared his new weapon, the bottomless vacuum.<br />
<br />
The guardian looked panicked. “Slar please, there is no need to fight! I am willing to cooperate in order to free Mary from the magic cuffs! With enough time, I’m sure we will eventually find away to break the red cuff’s bonds! Killing me isn&#39;t necessary.” the guardian exclaimed, it’s voice gravelly, like hard cloud chunks grating down a mountain.<br />
<br />
“Sorry bud, but there’s not enough time to stick around and ‘figure it out’ when the kingdom is in danger. I got to fix this problem now.” Slar coolly explained, making sure to give the beast his classic cold eye. The vacuum was ready to suck.<br />
<br />
“Slar, you don’t need to kill him, please calm down!” Mary pleaded, her voice tinged with a hint of annoyance.<br />
<br />
Slar pretended to not hear her. Mary seems trustworthy enough, but he only just met her, and he doesn&#39;t’t know her enough to be sure that she won’t try something. Slar knew she hadn&#39;t fully committed herself to joining the Gang, which meant she would probably look for any opportunity to escape. He’ll try to free her regardless. He’s not that heartless after all. But he better watch what she says and make sure she doesn&#39;t make a run for it once he kills the guardian. After all, she might be the girl the boss is looking for...<br />
<br />
So like what any true hero would do, Slar pulled his gun back out in a split second and pulled the trigger before the guardian could react, his hand jerking slightly as he delivered a mist scatterer blast aimed directly at the monster’s head. The loud noise ringing in his ear as the bullets directly hit home, not that it matter. <br />
<br />
Although the guardian’s head burst like a balloon, he could already see it start to reform back.<br />
<br />
Seizing the chance to suck in the gurdian&#39;s organs, Slar quickly put the Mist Scatterer away and activated his vacuum. However, his unfamiliarity with the device cause him to make a slight mistake. Instead of pushing the “Suck” button, Slar instead pushed the “Blow” button, and in a second, Slar realized his whole body was jerking around as the vacuumed thrashed around in his hand, barely under his control.<br />
<br />
Shooting out all of the lab equipment, materials, and experiments in an outward torrent of wind, Slar watched as Mary grabbed a discarded gem embedded shield on the floor beside her, using it to protect herself whilst the monster could only lift up his four arms and ready it’s black armor to protect itself.<br />
<br />
Slar grinned as he watched the monster take the brunt of the force whilst Mary, using her superior cloudfolk dexterity and shield, managed to get through with only a couple scraps... the monster however, had a much less pleasant experience.<br />
<br />
Slar could only feel pride as the vacuum thrashed around in his hands like a wild beast, the flow of items and equipment flying around like a swarm of bees as he watched the monster get assaulted by all manner of objects. Dangerous looking lab equipment stabbed into his body, sticking out and piercing into the softer parts of his body, whilst strange liquids originally contained in now broken vials and beakers burned away at the harder parts of his body, causing Issac to screech in pain as the numerous chemicals reacted together, causing parts of his body to ignite in a green chemical fire that consumed and even melted parts of his body. Other strange substances that didn&#39;t ignite or react to each other, simply soaked into the creature&#39;s body. Slar could even see a couple of parasites and strange organic things dig into him. He wished he didn&#39;t see some disembodied cocks stick to the gurdian&#39;s body though.<br />
<br />
Slar mentally patted himself on the back for using the vacuum as the guardian gave out a satisfying roar of pain.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Mary defended herself as she stood there and watched as Slar fired his strange weapon at Isaac. A part of her wanted speak up before the situation escalated to violence. She might have stopped Slar from hurting Isaac. Instead, she just stood there in silence as she took her time figuring out how to speak to Slar without revealing her mission. She’s not necessarily sure were Slar’s allegiance lies. But She hesitated, and as a result, she put Isaac in danger. And she hates herself for it.<br />
<br />
She must make things right. But she doubt Slar will hear her voice over that loud machine in his hands. So instead, she opted to do what she can do.<br />
<br />
And that is to protect Isaac.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
To Slar’s surprise, Mary yelled out with concern and ran to the guardian&#39;s aid, lowering her shield and she went to work by using a nearby cloud cloth to put out some for the fires, doing her best to wipe away the chemicals and pulling out any pieces of lab equipment she could as well and stabbing and removing any of the strange organisms using her fencing sword and Slar&#39;s dagger.<br />
<br />
Slar was shocked that Mary would leave herself defenseless while she got pelted by some unknown substances and debris despite the pain.<br />
<br />
In a split second, what was a satisfying scene of Slar saving the girl from her imprisonment, became a horrific one were Slar’s the one hurting the girl! He made a mental note to not include this embarrassing blunder on his resume.<br />
<br />
Slar wants to run to Mary and make sure she is okay... But his body wouldn&#39;t respond. He just stood there and watched in confusion... why would Mary help some monster living in a mansion?... was she under some sort of mind control? It was a possibility. Slar had heard many stories about the mansion’s owner. Memory erasure may not be the only thing she is capable of...<br />
<br />
Regardless, Slar could see that the guardian was starting to recover. All of the chemical fires had been put out and wiped away whilst most of the guardian&#39;s body was already starting to regenerate, pushing out pieces of lab equipment stuck in its body. Slar couldn&#39;t let that continue. He had to end this quickly or else he would be back at square one. Perhaps he could persuade the guardian to give up it’s life for Mary’s sake? It does seem to care about Mary’s well being.<br />
<br />
Slar couldn&#39;t help but shudder as the sight of Mary&#39;s wounds were small debris were ledged in her flesh and liquids soaked in her body. She might not be showing it, but Slar can tell she is hurt. He will have to tend to her wounds soon. It is his fault that she got hurt...<br />
<br />
But first he must deal with the guardian first.<br />
<br />
“Now if you think that’s all I have to offer, then you’re wrong. I will do whatever it takes to save Mary.”<br />
<br />
The guardian only groaned in reply as it tried to stand up, Mary doing her best to support it&#39;s weight.<br />
<br />
When the guardian gained enough strength to stand, it only barley did on its own. Mary turned to face Slar. Drawing out her royal fencing sword, Mary with a face of true genuine annoyance and borderline anger asked aloud with a cold voice “Slar, will you wait until he at least can speak? Let him be and calm down, if only for a moment!”<br />
<br />
“No can do, you are tied to this guardian! If my hunch is correct, then it can’t leave this mansion without risking the wrath of it’s master. Until I kill this thing, you will be trapped in this mansion, chained to this guardian. It seems this guardian wants to free you too, so please let me kill it. ” Slar stated coolly, cautiously moving the aim of his shotgun to Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary gave a look of confusion for a moment, as if unsure what she had heard before realization dawned on her and her annoyed face came back with full force.<br />
<br />
“Slar, please don’t tell me that’s what you came up with?!” She asked, her voice sounding exasperated.<br />
<br />
“It’s my fault for getting you chained up by those red cuffs in the first place! Please let me make that up to you.”<br />
<br />
Mary gave another look and was about to speak, before calming herself down, taking a deep breath before speaking again.<br />
<br />
“Slar, you are a writer are you not?” She asked calmly.<br />
<br />
“What’s that got to do with anything?” Slar asked, keeping an eye on Mary as he spoke, unsure of what Mary could be planning to do.<br />
<br />
“Tell me... what kind of writer writes a protagonist who shoots first, jumps to conclusions with no tangible evidence, and is unwilling to calm down and have a peaceful talk without pointing a weapon at someone?” Mary stated.<br />
<br />
Slar realized that he was still holding the magic vacuum and it was currently aimed at Mary. Yet he didn&#39;t’t lower it, even as he saw the guardian rise up. Although it’s body was mostly healed up, it was still clearly in some amount of pain, it’s upper arms clutched its head, visibly shaking as it inaudible mumbled to itself, as if in its own private conversation. Parts of its body had still not fully recovered.<br />
<br />
Mary briefly looked at the guardian with concern in her eyes before turning back to Slar.<br />
<br />
“Now please, put down the weapon and let’s talk for at least a moment. You can use your weapon on us all you want later, but please give us a chance to talk without whatever that thing is aimed at us.” Mary pleaded.<br />
<br />
Slar kept his focus on Mary, deep in thought about what to do. He was shocked, for some reason he was actually considering putting down his weapon. Is it because Mary’s words had actually struck a cord with him and he was beginning to realize that he was unnecessarily escalating a situation far higher than it needed to be? Could it be that he was wrong?... He wasn&#39;t sure if he wanted to admit that yet. But even he can realize that things are going nowhere with how they’re currently are. Like it or not, it’s probably best if he at least listens to what they have to say.<br />
<br />
With a deep breath, Slar accepted that he must change his approach with the situation, before slowly lowering his magic vacuum.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what does it matter?&quot; Slar turned his attention to the guardian. &quot; Even if you do take us to the mansion’s front door, Mary is still going to be stuck to you. And I doubt your master will let you leave this mansion and go with us.” Slar shouted to the gurdian with defeat clearly in his voice.<br />
<br />
The guardian looked confused. &quot;What gave you that idea? The owner of this mansion is not my master. I&#39;m Mary&#39;s traveling companion. That’s all.”<br />
<br />
Slar didn&#39;t want to believe what he was hearing. Believing means accepting that he was wrong. How could THIS thing be one of Mary’s traveling companions?! Then again, Mary was alone when he decided to use her as a hostage in case the mansion’s owner was around. (Once he realized that the owner wasn&#39;t’t around, he made a point to protect Mary for her trouble. He made it a personal rule to make sure hostages are safe once he’s done using them.) He didn&#39;t’t bother to check her campsite to see if there was more then one sleeping bag. So it’s possible that her other traveling companions were simply somewhere else at the time. But why would she travel with... that thing? It seems a little too good to be true. That thing looks right at home in a supernatural place like this. Yet... If it didn&#39;t originated from this crazy mansion... then were did it come from? Did it came from that raiding area?<br />
<br />
“Just traveling companions? Like I’d believe that. Tell me what you are really after.” Slar demanded, making sure that his weapons are fully visible.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slar. We have to leave. We can talk about this later.&quot; Marry urged, leaving no room for argument.<br />
<br />
Regardless, if they are telling the truth, then there’s still a chance for Mary can go with Slar to the Cloud Crawler Gang&#39;s hideout. But for this monster to be traveling with Mary...<br />
<br />
Slar isn&#39;t happy in the slightest. He doesn&#39;t like a situation out of his control. “...Fine... I&#39;ll play along for now... But if it turns out that you’re lying... I WILL kill you.&quot; He reluctantly consented. <br />
<br />
The guardian nodded in satisfaction. &quot;That is fine. Let us go now and speak later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Slar dudn&#39;t answer. Instead he just replied with a grumpy, &quot;Harrumph!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three of them turned to leave the strange laboratory...<br />
<br />
...when Mary suddenly knelled down in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh!&quot; Mary exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Mary suddenly started rubbing herself as something strange was happening to her body.<br />
<br />
Slar immediately pulled out his Mist Scatterer again and took aim at the gurdian&#39;s head once again. Isaac in turn looked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do to her!?” Slar demanded in a dangerously calm tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t do anything!&quot; The guardian exclaimed. <br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Isaac and Slar watched in horrid fascination as Mary underwent her strange transformation.<br />
<br />
As she rubbed her skin, her skin was bubbling up as it started to become more solid. Not rock solid. The cloud flesh was starting to form a firm texture like that of human skin. Isaac and Slar watched in horrid fascination as Mar&#39;s smoky white body was being covered in human pigment that only Isaac would recognize. Mary&#39;s hair changed and solidified as it went from misty wisps to black hair follicles. Next, Mary&#39;s nails would form, her eyes changed to a more human black color.<br />
<br />
In moments, Mary&#39;s sudden transformation was complete.<br />
<br />
With her balance changed, Mary fell to the ground.<br />
<br />
It took moments for Isaac and Slar to process what just transpired.<br />
<br />
In Isaac&#39;s eyes, it could have been worse. At least the transformation from a cloudfolk to a human wasn&#39;t as drastic as the corrupt transformations he seen in his years. In Slar&#39;s eyes however... she changed species. He never seen someone transform before. To him, Mary suddenly became a mysterious alien whose body works in unnatural and unknown ways... But she was still Mary at the end of the day, and he will do whatever he can to change a fellow cloudfolk back.<br />
<br />
In the blink of a eye, Slar ran up to Issac and pressed the end of his gun against the side of the paladin’s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Change her back or I’’ll kill you.” He stated, his voice eerily calm, and his trigger finger only needing the slightest twitch to fire.<br />
<br />
But Isaac wasn&#39;t paying attention. He was staring at Mary as she reacted to the sensitive touch of her human skin to her &quot;wet&quot; cloud clothes with a surprised expression. Isaac had his suspicions before, but looking at her in her human body reminds him so much of himself. Her build, her facial structure, her height, her hair color, her skin color... everything about her human body reminds Isaac of himself. She looks like a twin sister he never had. He suspected that she might be his cloud plane counterpart before, but looking at her now further confirms Nathan&#39;s counterpart theory.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! I&#39;m talking to you!&quot; Slar yelled out as he butted his gun against Isaac&#39;s head again to get his attention.<br />
<br />
Isaac turned to Slar&#39;s angry face. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to change her back. I don&#39;t know why she became human.&quot; He answered honestly.<br />
<br />
Slar glanced at Mary as she examined her new body. &quot;Human... so that&#39;s what she is...&quot; Slar mused to himself. But why would that monster know about these...&#39;humans&#39;?<br />
<br />
 Isaac watched Mary examine herself. The mystery substances she was hit with most definitely transformed her. But what was in the substances that turned her into a human? More importantly, why was she transformed first? He was hit by the potions before her. <br />
<br />
Unless... The effects of the potions doesn&#39;t happen instantly or all at once. What if they happen at random? What if the potion&#39;s effects triggers at random intervals? Do they have specific tigers or do they just take time for their effects to show? Well... It&#39;s probably best to keep these theories to himself for now. How can&#39;t say how the potions work for certain.<br />
<br />
Isaac turned to Slar.<br />
<br />
“Let us leave now before even worse fates struck us. There’s no telling what will happen to us if the owner of this mansion decides to punish us for all this damage. “ Isaac waved towards the wrecked room.<br />
<br />
Slar wanted to argue, but even he agrees that it’s probably best to save the talking until they are far away from this creepy mansion and it&#39;s mysterious owner. He&#39;s lucky to not have his memories erased yet.<br />
<br />
Slar reluctantly nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Mary was having a hard time to stand up in her unfamiliar body, so Slar went to help her up. Isaac was going to do the same, but Slar stared at him with deathly daggers. Isaac reluctantly kept his distance as Slar helped Mary walk by holding her by her shoulders.<br />
<br />
Instead, Isaac went to pick up Mary&#39;s dropped belongings. Namely her fencing sword, Slar&#39;s dagger, and the shield Mary used.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me those!&quot; Slar shouted as he snatched Mary&#39;s equipment from his hands, and slipped them in the bag strapped to his back. The same bag he used to keep the vacuum and his other belongings. It&#39;s most likely his loot bag.<br />
<br />
As the group walked towards the room&#39;s exit, Isaac couldn&#39;t help but notice that Slar (who is walking alongside Mary in order to help her walk on her human legs) is making a point to walk behind Isaac. Most likely to shoot him in the back just in case.<br />
<br />
Isaac was disheartened that Slar still wouldn&#39;t trust him.<br />
<br />
But then again, Isaac wouldn&#39;t trust a monster either.</p>
