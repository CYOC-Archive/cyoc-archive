<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Do people read chapters this long? Should I split it in two?</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a bit scary how fast he got carried away by these new sensations, but Adrien wanted to try the entire skin on. After all, the shopkeeper had boasted about instincts and powers or something like that. He loved how his body had changed into a pink skinned dream. But he wanted to be a complete sex demon and that meant the blond needed to be ready for everything, like those strange tendrils. Oddly, he didn’t feel any tendrils on his body at this point. <br />
<br />
Regardless, the young man wanted to first make sure he was in control of the situation and not about to trap himself in some magical body. Thinking about that caused him to snort. When he got up this morning he certainly didn’t imagine that getting lost would result in him stumbling across something supernatural!<br />
<br />
His red nails checked the pink skin on his back, looking for a gap or slit but were finding nothing but a few spots that would enjoy a massage. Frowning Adrien decided to check his neck and there, too, the skin was perfect and blemish free… for a few moments until it parted obligingly. And just how it hasn’t forced itself on him, it now didn’t resist his efforts to take it off. Not that it needed to, because the 18-year old didn’t actually want to take it off and let go of the edges.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long and the perverted teen could feel that the skin was sealed around him again and so he continued to pick up the gorgeous head. Unlike the skin, the head wasn’t deflated or distorted in any way. He led his new fingers slip through the long, silky hair, happy with how nicely it framed the heart-shaped face. Would it really look this good once he put it on? Well, he wouldn’t know unless he tried, right? <br />
<br />
Turning the head, he could clearly see where the neck would connect with the head. The opening, however, wasn’t very flexible and thus a lot smaller than would be necessary for him. He brought it closer to his eyes. Maybe he had overlooked something? <br />
<br />
Once it was only a few inches from his face, the back of the head split open, pushing its long mane to either side and gave Adrien both the opening he needed and a solid fright for good measure. The teenager immediately and predictably yelped and dropped the head. <br />
<br />
“So much for ‘being ready for everything’”, he mumbled sheepishly to himself.<br />
<br />
The second the head was more than a foot away from Adrien’s face, it closed up again, while it was still in flight. Now aware of how to put it on, the succubus-bodied teen picked up the head again and brought it close to his face.  <br />
<br />
Immediately, the back split again, giving Adrien a look inside. Like before, there was a distinct lavender scent emanating from it. Because the lips of the head had been closed, this was the first time he could see the teeth and tongue. The teeth were perfectly even and utterly white, like those teeth from toothpaste commercials. The tongue, however, wasn’t so normal. It was strangely long and somewhat thinner than a normal human tongue. <br />
<br />
It was at this point that the tendrils started to grow out of the walls grasping for Adrien’s head. And frankly, this time they were very welcome because Adrien had no idea how to properly put the head on and align its features with his. <br />
<br />
Without fear, he pushed the head against his face and let go. Instantly, the tendrils began to reach out. They enveloped his head and he could feel the succubus skin sealing shut around him. The young man - or was it woman now? - was a bit anxious at the speed. It was at this point, with the head securely in place, that the entire inside of the head came to life and it dawned on Adrien that now the real work began.<br />
<br />
He could feel the material tighten around him, while at the same time something slimy from both the body and the head connected at the neck. An elegant hand reached up and traced the quickly disappearing gap between the body and the head. As that was happening, other tendrils coaxed open Adrien’s mouth and invaded there. It was strange, but not painful or distressing and he could breathe normally. His tongue was tightly gripped and something was pulled over it at the same time as something covered his lips. Right after, tendrils entered his nose and his teeth were also engulfed in something, presumably the head’s pearl whites.<br />
Slowly, head’s interior calmed down and he started to regain his sense of touch. Especially the flowing hair was making itself known as it cascaded down his back. His ears settled into place and what few noises there were registered properly again. <br />
<br />
When everything else felt settled, a couple of tendrils affixed themselves somewhere down his throat. It itched somewhat and caused Adrien to clear his throat, immediately noticing his changed voice and along with it, Adrien started to feel a bit off.<br />
<br />
Surprised, he finally opened his eyes and something like contacts was pressed gently into them. Adrien blinked a couple of times to get rid of irritation, but only then realised that he could see again. Looking around, he was still in the same room and once his eyes fell on the large mirror he could see him- or rather herself.<br />
<br />
The mirror showed a lithe and athletic pink-skinned woman with long blonde hair going past her shoulders. Adrien walked closer and could see the woman’s hips sway seductively with every step in the mirror. Gravity seemed to have only a token grip on her nicely round and firm breasts and they looked enticingly perfect on her slim body. The darkly purple horns on her head gave her a regal appearance, like an elaborate tiara might.<br />
<br />
As Adrien stopped right in front of the mirror, there was no doubt in his mind that this body looked gorgeous and the face was heart-meltingly stunning. Adrien smiled and his new ruby lips reacted like his old ones would. The result was alluring and sweet and immediately he tried for a more seductive look, which seemed to come naturally to him. His new red eyes set in black sclera only served to emphasize the expression and he started to feel a heat fill his body. <br />
<br />
Remembering the strange tongue, Adrien stretched his new one out and was delighted by its length and flexibility. He couldn’t just touch his nose with it but also quite easily his forehead.<br />
And naturally, he tried to just that, making his new face take on a look between silly and suggestively naughty. That made him snort, then giggle and finally laugh out loud. <br />
<br />
He dropped into the nearby oversized sofa stretching his entire body across it, still laughing. His laugh was melodious and he loved it. He snuggled further into the comfortable cushions of the sofa and his hands started to wander and caress his body. Each touch highlighted how sensitive his new body was. HIS new body? As one hand groped a breast and another had wandered between the legs, Adrien couldn’t help but feel like a woman.<br />
<br />
No, that was wrong, too. The desires inside her screamed for all with the ability to comprehend only one thing: Succubus!<br />
<br />
With heat inside her growing, the longing for another’s touch grew alongside with it. Her delicate fingers started to pinch her nipple, while her left hand was rubbing her nether lips. Already Adrien could feel her new vagina ache for attention. Attention that she was only too willing to provide.<br />
<br />
As she gently played with her clit, strange sensations and feelings made themselves known. She could smell that people had had sex on this sofa. She could see the magical power of this place hazily in the air. She could hear echoes trapped not far beyond the door to the shop. And as her mind wandered beyond this place, to all the men and women that were in Adrien’s reach, she simply grew wet at the thought of such an open buffet. <br />
<br />
These fantasies were nearly exclusively Adrien’s own but now guided by the demonic instincts of the skin. She knew she had to take the edge off of her growing cravings. Without thinking much about it, one finger slipped between her folds and immediately Adrien started to moan. Already, the newly created succubus imagined how good a proper cock must feel there. Another finger joined and despite being in her new body only mere minutes, the moaning blonde can already feel an orgasm approaching.<br />
<br />
Her legs were spread, with one hanging over the backrest and the other dangling over the edge of the cushions. The succubus saw her tail thrashing between her legs and got an idea. With a wicked smile, her fingers left her cunt and both hands started massaging her tits. She focused on her tail and it immediately stopped moving. It was an odd and unfamiliar feeling to control it, but she managed regardless. It felt a lot more powerful than she had imagined when she saw it in the box. Back then it seemed quite thin, but it was now clearly thicker, probably reaching about two inches in diameter.<br />
<br />
It didn’t take more than a few heartbeats for her new appendage to clumsily move above her honey pot. Her fingers went back between her legs and diddled her clit to the edge. With one last thought, it thrust inside, setting off the demoness and causing her to arch her back in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Adrien lay there in her afterglow for a few minutes, twirling and pumping her spade-tipped tail to prolong it. She considered going at it again but knew that she shouldn’t get carried away. She jumped from the sofa to her feet, testing and liking the strength and dexterity her inhuman body held. There was one problem, however.<br />
<br />
Nearly everything that she just experienced was down to her body or her instincts. She had yet to actually use special powers. Then she remembered the glowing eyes and went back to the mirror. <br />
<br />
She stared at her red eyes and tried to make them glow, glitter or do anything. First, nothing happened, but the more she focused the clearer she could feel an odd flow within herself. Once she was aware of it, directing this flow to her eyes was easy and immediately they lit up and Adrien could feel the draw they now exuded. Of course, now the gaze was her own and she knew that it wouldn’t work on her.<br />
<br />
Happy with her first trial, she figured that as a succubus she should be able to change her appearance so that she wouldn’t immediately cause a panic. She focused her flow - her magic as she now understood - throughout her body and imagined taking on a human shape. The mirror showed that it didn’t work perfectly. While her skin took on a healthy tan and her horns and tails disappeared, her eyes were still quite clearly red in black. She focused more on them and first her sclera cleared up and finally, her eye colour shifted uneasily to brown. It was more difficult than she had imagined, but it felt like she could hold this form if she needed to. Though having sex in it was, for now, way beyond her. She released her form and noticed that using her powers actually tired her out. That surprised her because she figured that mental exertion wouldn’t impact her so much.<br />
<br />
But she wasn’t done yet. Next, she decided to go for something more tangible and tried to focus the flow into her hands. She held them up in front of her and the power flowed there as easily as in her eyes. A tiny dark green ball of energy formed there. Her eyes allowed her to see the unfocused and undirected power in her hand and she knew that this thing was quite dangerous, like an animal knew that fire was dangerous. Adrien had to strain to keep it in her hands, but it soon grew unstable and threatened to flicker out.<br />
<br />
The succubus, however, wasn’t finished yet. She dug deeper inside herself and focused more into the ball, stabilizing it. She wanted it to grow just a tiny bit, but it seemed like she would soon be running on empty. Closing her eyes she focused on herself.<br />
<br />
There!<br />
<br />
Deep inside her very core, well hidden from her own senses, was a spark. No, more than a spark! A small star burned within her. She reached out mentally and was immediately shocked by the raw power it held. Fearful of the magnitude present, she didn’t try to direct it. Instead, Adrien merely opened herself up to the star, like connecting a house to a river with a pipe. This worked like a charm and she felt like the sun had risen inside her. The power was flowing freely through her and when she opened her eyes she could see her entire eyeballs blazing in a pure green light. The green orb in her hand was now the size of a baseball and she wasn’t even doing anything but keeping it stable!<br />
<br />
Exhilarated by her success, she tried to take control of this new source. And at this point, it all went wrong. The moment she ‘touched’ it, pain surged through her entire body. Adrien started to have convulsions and it was more and more difficult to keep the orb stable. Lightning sparked from it throughout the room, leaving behind marks where they hit. Her eyes, overflowing with power, felt like they were burning up. The orb was growing larger and larger and she was afraid that it would simply fry her if she ended the connection from the spark.<br />
<br />
With pure force of will, Adrien tried to drain the orb of its power, even as her legs gave way under her and she dropped to her knees. The orb’s energy now channelled back into her hands, worsening her agony. Just staying on her knees and keeping her arms up was arduous, but slowly the orb got smaller and smaller until it vanished. <br />
<br />
The second it was gone, the demon closed any and all connection to the spark. It was like the strings to a puppet were cut. Adrien dropped to the floor, body and mind utterly exhausted. Every muscle hurt and every single heartbeat was torture.<br />
<br />
This was not how Adrien imagined things would go.</p>
