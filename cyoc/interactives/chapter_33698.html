<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julie opened her eyes to see what she had done and gasped as she saw Kenan, a big smile on his face.  Julie was stunned by her failure and Kenan easily removed the wand from her limp grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bravo, Julie.  Very nicely done but you made a few critical mistakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Julie asked, surprised that Kenan isn't angered by her betrayal.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was very good, using your wing to pick up the wand and distracting me with your little wish to be turned back to a human.  You made a couple of mistakes.  Your first mistake was your poor planning, trying to use the wand on me now.  You should have waited till after I was done screwing you.  Then you could have looked for the book and linked yourself to the wand while I was sleeping.  I told you at the beginning, that the wand only works in connection with the book.  Foolish of you not to remember that.  Your second mistake was revealing your ability to threaten me with something that won't kill me.  Clever for you to figure that out but now I'm going to have to fix this.  I do have to admit that I didn't think you had it in you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Julie asked, cold sweat beading on her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean that during the entire time that I've had you as my bodyguard, after my first demonstration of my control over you haven't done a thing.  You didn't join in with the troops in taking the village.  You didn't protest my treatment of the villagers nor tried to argue with me over my plans.  You knew that I would go through with it all but you were silent.  I thought that you were quite worthless until you stopped that assassin.  So I decided not to kill you or send you home as thanks.  I asked myself what I could do with you and concubine just seemed like the logical alternative.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know your sick don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, now, don't interrupt.  I'm explaining why your not going to be just a concubine anymore.  With your desperate act to save your own life at the expense of my own.  Using anything you could get your hands on to strike back at me, I think I'll keep you as my bodyguard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This was all a test?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, and now one more just to give you a little hope that this will all end.  The way to break my power is to break the wand.&quot;  Kenan put the wand back into Julie's hand.  Julie knew that this had to be a trick.  Kenan had always thought he was so smart so why would he give the wand back?  If Julie broke the wand then she would never change back, never go home and see her family again.  Making one of the hardest choices in her life she snapped the wand and threw the pieces at Kenan's feet.  &quot;I don't care if I never change back, just as long as you lose your control of me...&quot; Julie trailed off as she saw the broken fragments mend themselves back together until the wand was as good as new.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, did I forget to mention, the wand is linked to my life force and will regenerate itself as long as I'm alive.  Sorry Julie but you can't stop me.  It's nice to know that you have some excellent qualities, even heroic qualities, and I've always found heroes have an amazing ability to survive what ever is thrown at them.  You will too Julie. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie wanted to break down and cry as her last spark of hope was extinguished.  Kenan was right, she could not stop him.  The compulsion on her prevented her from causing or allowing harm to befall on Kenan.  There was nothing she could do that would stop what was going to happen tonight.  The only consolation she could offer herself was that maybe she would find some other way to stop Kenan.<br />
<br />
&quot;For your proper villainy behavior, I will reward you.  First, you may change into a human but you will find it an uncomfortable form from now on.  Second, you may feel whatever you want about me but when you are in this demonic form you will be in a state of arousal.  Third, whenever you are having sex with me, you will enjoy it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie looked at Kenan and licked her lips hungrily as she looked at his erect dick.  Julie tried to fight it but a powerful urge was coursing through her body.  Thoughts of fighting Kenan were fading away and she just loved the look of Kenan's cock.  Like it was made to fill her, to feed her needs.  Julie felt nervous and very hot.  Knowing she couldn't hold out much longer she asked,&quot;This demonic form?&quot;  Kenan sat down on the edge of the bed and grabbed her wrist.  He pulled down and Julie didn't even resist.  Julie came down on top of him and straddled him.  Wanting something that showed off her tits better, Julie changed her black tank top into a sheer black negligee` and her black skirt into a black thong.  Panting lightly she placed a hand on Kenan's dick and her other hand on his chest and came down and kissed him on the mouth.  <br />
<br />
They were like that for a little while till Kenan rolled over so he was on top.  Julie spread her legs wide and gasped as Kenan penetrated her.  Her wings stretched out wide before curling around to press against Kenan and push him further into her.  Kenan grabbed onto one of her horns and tilted her head to the side so he could start kissing her neck as he pumped into Julie again and again.  Julie's whole body shuddered and she started panting over and over and as she peaked Kenan released himself in her and fell to the side.  <br />
<br />
Gasping he smiled, tired as Julie got on top of him and began rubbing up to him, her hand massaging his limp member until it was stiff again.  Julie twisted around and wrapped her legs around Kenan's neck.  Her tail curled around Kenan's head and pulled it in close to her ass. Kenan, seeing an opportunity, bit down on the full cheeks. He then began to kiss the tender area and Julie shivered. Now in proper position, Julie licked Kenan's member.  Her eyes glittering with excitement as it turned a dark red and Kenan moaned.  Placing her mouth over Kenan's cock, Kenan was unable to hold it in and ejaculated.<br />
<br />
Julie released her hold on Kenan and twisted back around until she was side by side with Kenan.  Kenan could tell by Julie's puffed cheeks that his sperm was still in her mouth when her cheeks deflated and she swallowed his seed.  Kenan panted and felt himself getting hard again at the sight.  Julie licked faint drops of white that clung to her lips, savoring the very taste and moaning with pleasure.  &quot;You taste delicious. Please sir, may I have some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kenan grabbed hold of Julie and kissed her hard.  When he finally let go he said,&quot;You taste delicious too.  The night is just beginning and world domination can wait a night. Now service your Dark Lord.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As my Dark Lord wishes.&quot;</p>
