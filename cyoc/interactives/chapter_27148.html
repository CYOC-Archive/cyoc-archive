<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>After the excitement of Amy's change, none of the girls felt like sleeping. They watched two movies before starting to nod off, and just as they started the third one, each girl slowly drifted off to sleep.
<P>Amy dreamed that she was flying through a blue sky with soft white clouds. She zoomed through them one by one. Her horns pierced their cottony forms, leading the way for the rest of her body. After a while of feeling the wind on her fur, she settled down on a plush cloud and peered over its edge. She could see cows grazing in a field below her, and before she knew it she was diving toward them. Some of them looked up at her, and she could make out the faces of Lina, Jessica, Geoffrey and Mrs. Henderson through their bovine features.
<P>She startled awake when Lina snapped her fingers close to one of her large ears. "Mom's got pancakes," Lina said before bounding out of the living room. Amy slowly picked herself up. She was in loose pajamas, which felt fine on her, although her tail felt a little restricted. (She hadn't bothered to poke a hole in the seat.)
<P>When she took a seat at the table she had to shift the tail around inside her pajama bottoms so she wouldn't sit on it. Lina's mom asked her what she wanted to drink, offering the usual choices of orange juice and milk. Amy surprised herself by answering "Milk, please," when in her mind she would have preferred the juice. A nagging feeling the back of her mind didn't want her to gulp down citrus.
<P>After a filling breakfast, Lina's mom went upstairs, leaving the three girls alone. Jessica brought up the topic of Amy's transformations.
<P>"When will it happen again?"
<P>"Any time," Amy said. "It happens about twice a day, but not at specific times."
<P>"You said you got that tattoo at a store?"
<P>Lina and Amy explained all about the CYOC Store. They failed to come up with a meaning for the abbreviation when Jessica asked, but they did tell her all about Amy's exploits. Jessica gave them her undivided attention, her expression changing from fear to delight to uncertainty.
<P>"You want to go, don't you?" Lina asked deplorably, as if Jessica was considering a sex change.
<P>"How could I pass this up?" she responded. "I can already think of a hundred things I want to try."
<P>"Okay, just give us a few minutes to get dressed--"
<P>"I'm all dressed. I'm done eating. Just tell me where it is."
<P>"We should probably go with you," Amy cautioned. "There's a lot of weird stuff in that place, you shouldn't just start picking random things up."
<P>"I'll be fine! Just tell me!"
<P>Seeing that they couldn't talk her out of it, Amy told her where to find the store. Jessica grabbed her purse and took off, thanking them before slamming the front door. Lina was cross.
<P>"You shouldn't have told her. What if she--?"
<P>"Stop talking, hurry up, and let's follow her before she does!" Amy shot out of her chair and went for her clothes. It took her a few extra minutes, since she had to cut a fresh hole in her shorts for her tail. She also tried to put her shoes on over her hooves, but quickly realized it was a futile effort and that her hooves were as good as shoes anyway.
<P>Just as she was walking to the door with Lina, something felt odd. She stopped, prompting Lina to ask what was wrong. "My chest...it's tight," she said as she tried to undo her bra. It felt much smaller than just a few seconds ago. It was difficult to get it off now that it was embedding itself into her back, but she finally managed. Her breasts drooped and she felt immediate relief. As she slid the bra out from under her shirt, she felt something else just below her breasts. The skin there was tender and a pressure was mounting. She felt the area with her other hand and gasped as her fingertips ran over two bumps. They were very sensitive, and felt like they were in the middle of something larger.
<P>"L...Lina? I think I'm growing more breasts."
<P>Lina's jaw dropped open as her eyes dropped to the growing bulges in Amy's shirt. Her breasts were huge. She could see the form of their large nipples even through the fabric. And she was growing MORE of them?!
<P>When Amy's hand slipped out of her shirt, Lina could see the second row very clearly. They grew to the same size as her original pair. They weren't monstrously large by any means, but they had increased at least a full cup size and looked slightly disproportionate for a girl her age.
<P>Amy cupped her hands under the bottom row. "They're heavy," she said in wonder. She didn't sound happy about this latest development, but she wasn't sounding disappointed, either. When she turned to Lina, her face was red. "I hope that store's got bras for this."
<P>Lina was at a loss for words. Seeing her fear, Amy continued. "I'm not sure how to feel about this, either, but right now there's nothing we can do. I...well, part of me likes this, but part of me thinks you were right about taking this too far."
<P>"Well, finally you're starting to make sense," Lina sighed after a moment's thought. "Okay, let's go. Can you walk with those things?"
<P>Amy took more steps toward the door. It was more difficult than before, but it wasn't because of their weight, it was because of their moving around. The intense feeling of each breast rubbing against the other wasn't anything she was prepared for. They weren't bouncing like balloons, they were simply swaying and shifting. A lot of their weight was explained by the feeling of milk filling each vessel. For a second, Amy wondered what it tasted like, but immediately disregarded that thought. "Let's get going," she said, finally opening the door and stepping outside.</p>
