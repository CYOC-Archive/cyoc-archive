<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark had one wish on his mind, something he always wanted. And as crazy as it could be, with Aidan it could happen. And if it didn´t work, well, Mark would find another use for him. He turned to the chronivac and typed something into Aidan´s profiles text input. The second he saved the change, Aidan vanished, leaving his clothes fall empty to the ground. He laughed at the thought what Aidan would do now, at least if he could.<br />
Aidan didn´t like the gleam Mark´s eyes had as he turned back to the laptop. Shortly later, he felt something pull him, and a second later he was standing in an open field, and was naked. He tried to hide, or even to move his hands to cover up, but beside turning bright red in embarrassment, nothing happened, as he was still frozen in place.<br />
Mark turned over to his own profile after editing that the laptop, and therefore the chronivac, belonged to him and not Aidan. In his own profile, he made a similar input in text-form as for Aidan, minus ending there naked but adding that the laptop would move with him before saving. Like Aidan, Mark felt a pull, and in the blink of his eyes he stood right in front of Aidan on the field. He laughed at him as he saw how red he was.<br />
Aidan was surprised when Mark appeared right in front of him a minute or so later, but he still was fully clothed. Whatever Mark had planned, he could now guess he would grow really big.<br />
Mark didn´t waste much time after he had laughed at Aidan. “Aidan, let´s test the limits of this. You will become a big, two-story house, complete with a garage, a cellar and an indoor-pool.”<br />
Aidan´s first thought was that Mark was crazy thinking that was possible, even with the chronivac and his command. That was, until he felt himself falling to his knees growing rapidly. His feet and legs then sunk into the ground, quickly filling a good part of the field underground. His body covered the surface above his legs, folding and rearranging everything so it fits to its new tasks.<br />
Aidan felt his body hollowing out, forming the needed rooms for his new house body. His legs grew into one big, empty cellar first , which then broke into several rooms, parted by his bones turned walls. The biggest of them, forming in the center where his feet have moved when they rearranged, gained a big indoor-pool like Mark had asked for. The water inside was provided from Aidan´s balls, so the water inside the pool had been his cum beforehand. His balls themselves turned into a pump to keep the water moving and fresh, while his kidneys were used to keep the water clean.<br />
Above the cellar, the inside of Aidan formed many different rooms. His bladder turned into a bathroom, complete with a shower, a bathtub with a whirlpool function, a toilet and a sink. The plumbing was formed out of Aidan´s digestive system, with the outlet being his cock, connected to the nearest sewer. As that connection was made, Aidan would have cried in pain, as his cock-head was welded to the sewer pipe.<br />
His stomach expanded into the kitchen, including a large storage room and high-end equipment. His rip-cage formed into a spacey living-room, also equipped with many high-end entertainment options. His lung turned into an ventilation system for the whole house, while his heart turned into a central heating, located in the cellar, with his veins turned into the pipes spreading the heat through the house.<br />
Aidan´s head, the upper floor of the house, turned out to be various bed rooms. His eyes had multiplied and turned into windows in all rooms in both the ground and the upper floor. His mouth separated into pieces. His lips stood open, turning into the front door frame, with his teeth as the door itself. The inside of his mouth beside his tongue had become the second floor bathroom, equipped similar then his former bladder, also connected to his plumbing.<br />
His hands covered the areal to his sides, the right one turning into the garage, while the left one ended up as a big terrace. His still red skin from being embarrassed had become a red brick-front of the house, his hair ending up as the black roof tiles. Out of his nose formed a chimney on the roof, connected to both the flue as well as the fireplace in the living room through his former throat. <br />
His tongue expanded, covering every floor in the house in either carpet, tiles or laminate. His ears had moved inside his body and also expanded, quickly becoming the wallpaper or tiles covering the walls and ceiling. The final part, a big staircase connecting the cellar and the upper floor to the ground formed from his spine. And at its very upper end, right under the roof, a small room with Aidan´s brain had formed, the brain itself becoming a central computer for the house.<br />
Mark watched in awe as Aidan turned into his dream of a house right in front of him. When he thought Aidan was finished changing and he himself was satisfied with the looks off the outside, Mark approached the door and opened it, using the key set in the door, also one of Aidan´s teeth before.<br />
Inside, Mark admired everything. Aidan´s inside was completely furnished, each object part of Aidan´s flesh or muscles. After looking through all the rooms, Mark was more than satisfied with the result. “You have turned out marvelous, Aidan.”<br />
Aidan himself was not happy with this outcome. While most of the change had not been painful, it wasn´t so pleasurable being locked in place with rearranged body-parts. Then Mark entered him. He felt him walk over his tongue, tasting everything fro Mark´s soles. Mark looked in every room, opened every door, tested some pieces of furniture, and Aidan felt it all as a violation of his very body. He also could watch him move around and hear his comments, as if he was present everywhere.<br />
Mark looked into the room with Aidan´s former brain, and a small suggestion relocated it into the cellar, to keep it cool, as he said. It had been the only thing Mark hadn´t liked, as even with the cooling system a computer shouldn´t be under the roof.</p>
