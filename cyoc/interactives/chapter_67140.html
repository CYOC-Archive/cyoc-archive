<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, look,&quot; I said. &quot;It sounds like your mind's made up that you want to stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, pretty much,&quot; Runt replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;And there's really no chance of me changing your mind,&quot; I went on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; said Runt. &quot;I like it here. It's a cute little dump.&quot; He flopped down on the soda, still nude,put his hands behind his head and gazed up at me with a grin on his face. &quot;The furnishings are a little cheap-looking, but it's all part of the charm. It's a fixer-upper, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I rolled my eyes. &quot;Are you seriously complaining about my furniture?&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Runt, &quot;I meant you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, that brings me to my next point,&quot; I said. &quot;You can stay here if you absolutely have to. I know I can't stop you, or you'll turn me into God knows what.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably a talking dildo,&quot; said Runt. <br />
<br />
&quot;So in exchange for me letting you stay, just promise you won't change me into anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt laughed. &quot;You're trying to bargain with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it's more than fair,&quot; I said, trying to sound firm and hoping my nervousness didn't show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, is it?&quot; said Runt, a little too sweetly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. You get a place to hide out, I stay out of your way and make your life easy, and if you so much as change one thing about me, I'll ...&quot; I trailed off as I realized I was about to threaten him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll what,&quot; he smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'll ...&quot; I didn't know what to say. I just sort of raised my first in what I hoped looked like a persuasively menacing gesture. <br />
<br />
He laughed again and blew on my fist from the sofa. And with that, I realized that I couldn't move. I was frozen. <br />
<br />
Runt stood up and walked over to me. &quot;I'll tell you what will happen,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm going to stay here. I think you're cute and I like having you around in my new place. Maybe now and then I'll even let you touch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He walked behind me and I couldn't even turn my eyes to follow him. Smack! He slapped me on the ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;You'll behave yourself and be a nice little boy,&quot; he went on. &quot;and every now and then, I'll expect you to have one of these little outbursts. I look forward to them. It'll give me an excuse to come up with a fun punishment.&quot;<br />
<br />
He crossed in front of me. &quot;got it?&quot; he said, and gave me a big long kiss on the mouth. I could feel his tongue licking all around the inside of my lips, and across my tongue. <br />
<br />
Suddenly I found I could move my tongue. At first my reaction was to try to push him out of my mouth -- but then I realized I'd better play along. I slid my tongue back against his, still unable to move the rest of my body, still with my fist held stupidly in the air. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; said Runt. &quot;So, you understand how it's going to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed, now able to move my mouth. &quot;Yes, I suppose so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't be glum,&quot; said Runt. &quot;It'll be fun. You enjoyed that kiss, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, then caught myself. Wait -- I did? Yeah, I guess I did enjoy it. That's weird. I've never been gay before. &quot;Oh, no, did you turn me gay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt laughed. &quot;I'm just helping you enjoy yourself,&quot; he said. He kissed my upheld fist and suddenly it could move again. I dropped it to my side. He kissed my other shoulder and elbow and arm and then my left side could move again too. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to admit that feels pretty good,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm glad to hear it,&quot; said Runt. He turned and started to walk away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; I said. He turned. &quot;What about ... You know?&quot; I gestured to my legs, still rooted to the spot. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, what would you like,&quot; Runt smirked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Could you ... Kiss the rest of me?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And where should I start?&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um,&quot; I said. I reached down as best I could, my lower torso still stiff. I pushed my boxers down. I cod feel my cock, frozen and rigid but in a flaccid state. It was the weirdest thing -- like I was plastic below the waist. <br />
<br />
&quot;You want my mouth on your cock?&quot; Said Runt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said. <br />
<br />
&quot;How much?&quot; asked Runt. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really really want it,&quot; I said, and I did. Not just to unfreeze me. I really wanted him to touch me. &quot;I need it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you're not just gay,&quot; Runt smiled. &quot;You're a gay little slut, aren't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; I mumbled. &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt sauntered back over. He tapped my rigid penis with a finger, then crossed behind me again. He wrapped his hands around my plastic cock. From behind me, and I could feel his real dick pressing against my rigid ass crack. Fuck! It felt so good. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know there's one part of you that isn't frozen solid,&quot; Runt whispered in my ear. &quot;I made one part of you extra stretchy and rubbery. Do you know what part? I'll give you a hint. It's a hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to fuck me?&quot; I whispered back. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're a gay slut, aren't you?&quot; said Runt. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I whimpered. &quot;A slutty bottom. Please fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Runt gave a sharp thrust of his hips and suddenly his entire huge cock was up my ass. I gasped. It felt amazing. No pain -- just a massive boner inside of me. <br />
<br />
I could move my legs now, and I bucked back and forth on his dick, milking it with my ass. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good boy,&quot; purred Runt. &quot;What a perfect little fuck toy. Ready to take some demon cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I gasped. He squeezed me tight and I felt his dick throb hugely inside of me -- and then he came. <br />
<br />
My core bulged as he unloaded his seed -- it was like a fire hose, must've been gallons in just seconds. My sides ballooned out, my gut inflated, my ass cheeks swelled like yoga balls. He released his grip and pulled out, surveying me. <br />
<br />
I looked down. From my chest to my knees, I was nearly spherical. My arms were pushed out to the sides, resting on my giant round torso. My dick poked out at a silly angle from the balloon of my body, still hard. <br />
<br />
Runt laughed at me. &quot;Ready to cum?&quot; he asked. I nodded. <br />
<br />
Runt grabbed my dick and yanked. Like a balloon, suddenly all the air rushed out of me and my gut shrank smaller, smaller, smaller ... It was just a rush of air blowing out of my cock, no fluid. My ass shrank back to normal size, my round sides subdued, and finally I was back to my old shape. <br />
<br />
Runt gave one move yank on my cock and at last a spurt of jizz shot out, straight up in the air. &quot;Catch it,&quot; he said, and I quickly stuck out my tongue and swallowed my load as it came down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Enjoy yourself?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; I said, regaining my senses. &quot;What did you do to me? I can't be ... I can't be...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A slutty bottom?&quot; said Runt. &quot;You can when I want you to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, you've made your message clear,&quot; I said. &quot;Am I back to my old self?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now,&quot; said Runt. &quot;Until the next time I want to have some fun. Or when you want to have fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Allright, I'll be good,&quot; I said. &quot;now I know what happens when you want to punish me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that wasn't a punishment,&quot; said Runt. &quot;That was just fun. THIS is punishment.&quot; Abd he reached out and grabbed my wrist.</p>
