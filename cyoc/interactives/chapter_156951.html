<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie grinned and flexed her fingers and her toes, she ran her hands over her transformed body. This was it! She was growing up! She was finally becoming a big girl. No, an adult.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big girl is what the old me would say,&quot; she thought to herself. &quot;I&#39;m in sixth grade now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instinctively, new thoughts and understandings came into her head as she said that and she found herself surprised at the knowledge that the ring imparted. A full education up to a fifth grade level, all the education she would have, but there was the conspicuous void of the actual memories of being in school, meeting friends and just growing through those years in general.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the ring can give me the knowledge, just not the memories...but it does change mom&#39;s somehow.&quot; She thought to herself. &quot;Maybe because she is unaware, and I am aware.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie thought to try it out. She waited patiently until her mom had pulled into the parking lot at the beach and then silently made her wish.<br />
<br />
Katie could feel another growth spurt coming as her height jumped to three to four inches. But she could see other changes on her body that takes her straight to womanhood. The small mounds on her chest started to grow as they look like pointy cones. Katie saw them sticking out and could feel her hormones ramping up as the nipples started to look erect. Her hips started to flare up a bit and were gaining a bit of curves around her waist. Her arms and legs stretched as her skin was toning up and darkening in a glazed like tan. Looking to her review mirror, she could see her face maturing as she was entering her teens. Her head was looking shaping from a round to oval, her nose grew bigger and thinner, the freckles continue to fade bit by bit, and her eyes were getting smaller and more mature. She flinged a few blonde strands back as her hair slowly grew down her neck. Looking down at her feet, she could see her worn out sneakers looking new again and adjusted size to fit her growing feet. The thirteen-year-old was enjoying this as she was starting to grow out into her teen years. <br />
<br />
She could feel her body growing again as she could feel another growth spurt happening, shooting up another couple of inches. Her body then continued to mature further as her cones upgraded to size A cups, small but round. She could feel her hips expanding as her waist gotten a little curvier then normal. Tracing her finger to her hourglass, she was amazed at how shapely she’s becoming. She then spotted her fingernails and noticed that they were extending while her hands grew big and dainty. She could even see the nail polish on her nails as the pink began to sparkle. She looked at the polish as the sparkle reflected on the shine, feeling amazed by it all. She checked her face again and could see its journey through adulthood. Face looking so much oval like, nose getting longer and thinner a faint freckling on her nose, and eyes smaller and less childlike. She also noticed her lips puffing with cartilage and darkening to give her something to be kissed with. Her hair started to grow longer as it brushed past her shoulders and was getting brighter by the second. Her floral print bikini shifted to match her body as it changed into something more mature at the floral designed faded and replaced with a navy blue color. Her sneakers shifted a little more as the laces vanished and the top opened up a little, turning into teenage flip-flops. Then her surfboard grew a little to match her age and looked like ones for teenagers. Katie watches it all as the 14-year-old stretched a little, enjoying her changes bit by bit.<br />
<br />
The 24-year-old Kellie looked to her little sister for a bit and asked, “What are you starring at shrimp?” Katie turned back and said in a polite tone, “Nothing… I’m just happy that you can take me to the beach today.” Kellie nodded and gave a deep sigh. “Thanks sis, it’s the least I can do. After all, this next case I&#39;m supposedly working&#39;s gonna be a bit of a drain. Man, I really need to start finding a nanny to keep watch for you when I’m at work.” Katie was a little hesitant and said to her sister, “But I’m fourteen! I’m too old for a babysitter!” “Well unless you want to get stuck with me in the office, I don’t know what else to do.” she said feeling a little aggravated over this. Katie though decided to ignore her and watched on as more changes happened to her own body.<br />
<br />
She now felt her body growing more pronounced as she raced through the teen years. Her growth spurt got to a couple of more inches and she could feel like she was rising on the elevator. Her chest started to feel heavy as she looks down to see the mounds growing bigger and looking like AAs. Hips widening and curving as she had the hourglass of a young teen. Katie crossed her legs as she could feel them growing longer and shapelier, letting her free foot dangling as she moved her dainty foot to the beat. Her legs took the same direction as well and grew longer with muscles swelling to young surf girl status. Her skin darkened a little more of a golden color as she looked to her hand to see it changing shape with fingers getting thinner and longer and her nails extending further. Katie decided to look at the dashboard mirror and see if the face has changed much. So far, she could see it maturing more, as her cheeks look less puffy, her nose thinning to a sleeker shape, lips puffy a little bit, and her eyes and ears growing smaller. Starring at herself, she was starting to look like such a beauty. Just as she was looking at herself, she could feel a little discomfort in her mouth. Opening her mouth, she noticed braces appearing on her teeth. Katie was surprised by that and wondered how that got there. That’s when she remembered her memories altering. She remembered that she needed braces to help straighten her teeth. That could explain why she had them in the first place. She then noticed the skin on his face as saw a little dot on the cheek. Was that a pimple? She heard of teen girls getting them, but she never thought it was possible for her. Guess it was a price to pay when growing up.<br />
<br />
“Looking at yourself, sis?” The twenty-five year old peeked to her fifteen-year-old sister and smirked saying, “Still feeling worried about your looks?” Katie felt a little nervous and said, “Yeah… The braces hurt and I swear I could see a zit on my face. I feel embarrassed going to the beach looking like this.” Kellie gave off a bit of a laugh and let the poor girl know that it’s all right. “It’s cool girl, I understand. I was like that when I was your age. I too was a little embarrassed at the fact that I looked like the teenage version of the ugly duckling. But as years passed, my ugliness faded and I have become the ravishing gal that I’ve grown to be. Give it a few years and maybe you can become as perfect as me.” Katie smiled and knew that Kellie was right. With her memories altering, she remembered the Kellie was going through a gawky teen phase and in a matter of years, she looks completely hot. Perhaps in a few years, she can be just like her too. Or to be more precise in Katie’s view, a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Katie could feel another tingle as she grew another couple of inches, reaching four. Her maturing body continued its crossover through adulthood as she could see her body shaping very finely. Her breasts expanded a little more, shaping into a pair of perky B cup breasts. Her hips and waistline curved up some more, as the hourglass shape was looking well defined. Her arms and legs stretched further and her muscles grew to athletic proportions. Her face matures even more as her freckles faded out of existence, replaced with multiple pimples spread throughout most of her face. Her hair was now at her upper back and was getting shiny and wavy. Katie could also feel her swimsuit shifting again to help accommodate her aging body. It darkened to solid black and started to look a little bit skimpy with her cleavage starting show. Same goes for her flip-flops as they opened up more and turned into just straps, leaving his regular style sandals. And her board shifted a little more into a much more professional style board teens like to go on. Katie looked to her sweet sixteen self and could tell that she was a little bit ugly. But she knows that it’s a matter of time before she has a beautiful face.<br />
<br />
Katie then turned to see her mother/sister and could tell that she was feeling more energized then ever and felt like she was ready to take on the world. She even noticed the car their in shifting around as she could feel the seat getting more snuggled and the gauges and dashboard went from being old fashioned to almost digital. She could even feel the car going faster then normal as the engine shifting into something more powerful. Brushing a few of the radiant hairs out of her face, she begins to wonder what to do at the beach. “You know,” she said with a little sultry sound to her voice, “I could go to the bar after I surf. I mean I am legally twenty-one, right sis? I should treat myself with a little alcohol in my life.” Katie chuckled up and could tell that Kellie was entering the alcohol phase of her life. She then said in a coy voice, “Sure think Kel… Just don’t drink too much since we need to head back home.” The older sister look to her younger one and said, “Oh come now Kate. Just going to have one bottle and that’s it. It’s not like I’m going to have a drinking binge or something.” The two laughed it up, as Katie was amazed of the mental progression her former mother&#39;s opinion of her is going through. Normally, she would’ve teased her because of her being a little sister, but now that she’s getting older, they’re relationship is getting closer then ever.<br />
<br />
Tingling again, Katie could feel herself growing into a teen of seventeen. She’s inching closer to the five-foot mark and was near the adult size. She took a deep breath as she her body matured into a young adult status. Breasts now grew to BB and his hips flared more and more, getting curvier by the second. With her arms and legs stretching, the muscle tone expanded and toned to the point of athletic status. She could feel her face maturing more and more as her cheekbones were looking a little high and there were fewer pimples dotting her face, leaving most of the skin really smooth. Other changes of her face took place with her eyes getting smaller, nose thinning and getting longer, and lips getting a bit puffy. Her hair lower down her upper back and was reaching midway through. She crossed her legs very womanly and could feel her body language changed. Once she was all preppy and happy as a young girl, now she was turning into a mature woman with the strength and ability of a surfer girl. Her brain kept on filling with high school knowledge as history, math, English, and social studies felt easier for her. But her athletic knowledge continues to dominate more of her brain as memories of her taking on karate, track, and volleyball now entered her mind. The teen watched on and was amazed by how her body has grown and developed. <br />
<br />
“Hey Kate, can you do me favor and put that surf board of yours in the back. I know you like to keep it with you, but it’s getting too big to keep in the front.” Katie turned to Kellie and realized something and saw her surfboard growing bigger and shapely, providing with durability and increase in speed. Seeing how big it’s getting, she looked to her and said, “Oh! Right! Sorry sis! Guess I get a little too attached to my board. I’ll get it to the back.” She then picked the board up and gently slides it to the back over her head. Sensing another tingling coming, she sat back and felt her body growing a little bit faster. <br />
<br />
Going over five feet, Katie could feel the sensation wash all over as she left her teens and entered her twenties. Her breasts now grew into a C cup as her hips expanded further and her rear inflated bigger. The muscles on her arms and legs grew thicker and harder and although they are not body builder level, she does show that she was very athletic. All the remaining pimples on her face disappeared as well, leaving it smooth and flawless. She could even feel her braces magically removed from her teeth as she opened her mouth partly to reveal her teeth looking all evened out and pearly white. Along the way, she could see no trace of her childish innocence anywhere. Her face left childhood completely as her skin as clear and shiny, her nose was very elegant, her lips puffy and defined, and her eyes looked sultrier and less innocent. Instead it was a complete beauty with lips to kiss, sultry eyes, and an elegant nose. Her hair grew longer and was at the middle of her back and was shining a blonde hue. Her bathing suit shifted a little bit and was looking more scantily, yet moderate. It now looked like a black strapless bikini top and a thong like panties with a really thin string. Katie never thought that teens could wear something like that, but she is a surfer girl and those type of girls like to look sexy in the beach. She could even feel her sandals shifting a little, as the heel was getting a little higher. Her mind matures as well as knowledge and memories were changing incredibly. Most of which involve sports as she now knows how to do the hurdles, light weight training, and yoga to make her feel flexible. At 21 years of age, Katie was amazed to see how grown up she looked. She might even make Kellie jealous of her body. As Katie looked on, she could feel the wind from above her. Looking up, she noticed the roof of the car opening a hole and growing, exposing more of the warm air. She looked around and noticed that the car is continuing to change to match their age. It was changing to a sleeker, more durable, and fast model as the engine was sounding that it had a whole lot more horsepower then ever. Almost like the car is changing into something teenagers like to drive. they&#39;ve T car went from being an old, raggedy Honda Civic to a sleek and cherry red Jaguar F-Type sports car with the wind blowing through their hair and two surfboards strapped to the back. It was one of the prizes she won in a surfing competition and in Katie’s memory; it was the greatest prize of them all.</p>
