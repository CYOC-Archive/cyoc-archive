<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You were wondering what was going to happen next as you pulled up your panties, and struggled fasten your bra. It was then that Janice walked up to you and asked,&quot;Need help with that hun?&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused then nodded blushing and Janice walked behind you and helped you strap on your bra. &quot;Don’t worry Tammara, it was hard for me too starting off.&quot; Janice said reassuringly, and then Jessica walked up to the two of you and said,&quot;Excuse me, but it’s almost time to report to Master. You two should get going before too long so he isn’t worried.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don’t worry, I&#39;m just helping Tammara with her bra, then I’ll guide her to where she needs to be myself.&quot; Janice exclaimed then Jessica nodded to her and she exited the room and the other concubines soon followed behind her except for you and Janice.<br />
<br />
&quot;So uh...Janice, what exactly is going to happen after this?&quot; You asked feeling slightly worried.<br />
<br />
Janice finished up with your bra and walked around to see you eye to eye then she said,&quot;Don’t worry, Master is nice and considerate when it comes to our services.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh..okay then, so...what are the possibilities?&quot; You whimpered still feeling shy about the situation at hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don’t worry, believe me each of our duties is specific to us, and yours will be no less unique. Now c&#39;mon before Master gets worried about us.&quot; Janice said then before you could say anything else she took paw in hers and guided you out the door and into the halls again.<br />
<br />
As you walked with Janice, or rather being dragged by her, you noticed the many eyes of various people staring at you, and you couldn’t help but feel embarrassed. Eventually you reached another door and it opened up into the back entrance to a large throne room.<br />
<br />
There was marble pillars, and floors lining the way to a gold plated throne that also had a red carpet leading to it. Then sitting right behind the throne was a small open spherical area with purple pillows, and cushions behind his seat. Overall the room looked like the inside of a cathedral, and it felt majestic to stand inside of. <br />
<br />
Then there he was, the Prince, your Master, as he sat atop his throne he looked out to the rest of the room. You watched as his ears swiveled around as you entered and he turned to see you and smiled. &quot;Ah, Janice and the lovely new Tammara, how have you been?&quot; Karther asked and he stood up from his throne and walked up to you in the same attire he wore before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...fine, I guess.&quot; You said and blushed as your eyes glanced down towards his sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfectly wonderful Master, just helping Tammara here look the part.&quot; Janice said with a smile on her face and her tails wagged happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;I’m glad to hear that Janice, now like usual your duties are shortened because of your...maternal duties. As for Tammara here, I would like to have a talk with you. Janice, you are dismissed to your duties now.&quot; Karther said then Janice nodded obediently and she left the room leaving you alone with Karther.<br />
<br />
Once you were alone Karther looked at you from top to bottom and nodded then said,&quot;I see, they did a good job on you. Here, walk with me Tammara.&quot; <br />
<br />
You hesitated to respond then you nodded and you walked with Karther up to his throne and he sat you down behind his throne on one of the cushions. &quot;Uh...um...what&#39;s going to happen....uh...Master?&quot; You asked cocking your head to the side unsure if you should really call him the way the other concubines do.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren’t as rebelliously defiant as you were before. You can calm yourself Tammara, or at least for the time being.&quot; Karther said and you nodded to him and tried to keep calm.<br />
<br />
Karther then knelt down to you on one knee then he said,&quot;What exactly have the others told you about me? Gossip is an evil thing sometimes, and when it spreads it has the potential to destroy kingdoms.&quot; <br />
<br />
You paused then you nodded to him and said,&quot;Th...they said that you never mated with them, and that some of them have mates and families. They also said you were...looking for a mate, but I&#39;m still unsure about this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karther nodded to you and looked into you eyes then he said,&quot;Then it is common knowledge among them now. Both of those things are true, and as for me well...I admit that I maybe a bit...desperate. But you should not worry, because I am a fair ruler that considers the ideals of the people too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused looking into his eyes then let out a small whimper and asked,&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do not feel threatened, I do not intend to force myself upon anyone, especially you. I just want to explain that I am not considering mating with a natural vixen, but rather a concubine of my own. I am young in my immortal body, and I have concluded that if I were to mate with a concubine of my own creation then I shall judge her based on her personality instead of beauty. All I ask is...if we were in a relationship, would you consider me...a possibility as a mate. Answer honestly with the memories of your past but the instincts of your body please, and your loyalty to me now shouldn’t affect that decision.&quot; Karther explained and his words sounded as honorable as he could have possibly put them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...you mean that you&#39;ll....mate with me if I....&quot; You whimpered<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you don’t want to, I am an honorable prince and because of that I promise to take the time to get to know you. I apologize for making you uncomfortable but it is rather difficult to be professional about this.&quot; Karther said and you noticed him blushing slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...well...what would my normal duties be?&quot; You asked blushing too<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally you would do what you skill in doing. Cooking and cleaning are mere examples, so there are many other options such as tailoring, gardening, even the basic study of magic is considered serving me for it can assist in the future.&quot; Karther explained <br />
<br />
You took a few moments to think about this, wether to be his mate and get to know him better, or not and take up the duties of a regular concubine. You weren’t quite sure if the feelings you had towards him were of lust or affection, but eventually you were able to reach of decision and you gave him your response, &quot;Oh, well.....I would like to.....&quot;</p>
