<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan’s phone screen went insane as it zoomed up and down the page, the keyboard popping in and out and making clicking sounds as buttons were pressed, his phone acting on its own to adjust his profile much faster than he could process it. Suddenly, the screen went black for a moment, and Ethan found himself staring at his home screen. He snapped back to reality, “Stupid fucking app.” He said to himself, embarrassed that he fell for it.<br />
<br />
Still, he found himself relatively hopeful that something would work. He clicked the app again, and was met not by the splash page, but by a red screen and a loading bar. A rapid calmness overtook him as he found himself quickly enamored in the screen again, paying the world around him no mind as his focus went undivided into his phone.<br />
<br />
After loading, a bold logo appeared at the top of the screen, stylized blue text with a bold black background: MenFootFetishApp. Two text boxes appeared for the entry of a username and password - Ethan’s phone acted on its own by entering a string so rapidly that Ethan wouldn’t be able to read it even if he weren’t in a total trance. The screen locked for a moment, a circle spinning indicating that something was loading, and shortly several boxes appeared on the screen of what appeared to be profiles.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it was the sheer shock value of what he saw on the screen which broke Ethan out of his zoned-out state. He stared in disgusted horror at the pictures in the profiles. Mostly men in their early-to-mid twenties, huffing shoes or licking socks or feet. A few scattered profiles in the group had tough looking men standing above the camera with the focus on their feet. Ethan was horrified, this was disgusting! He questioned why the app would ever match him up like this. It had to be a prank, he reasoned.<br />
<br />
All the reasoning in the world couldn’t explain his fear as his pointer finger moved on its own to click the profile button in the top left corner of the app. The screen loaded again, and sure enough there was a profile filled out for him - full and complete first and last name, location, age, height and weight, and shoe size. A prompt quickly appeared: “Your profile picture is out of date! Would you like to take a new one?”<br />
<br />
A sudden wave of horniness washed over Ethan as he enthusiastically clicked yes. The selfie camera popped open, and he instantly set the timer for twenty seconds before mounting it against his headboard, then moving to the other end of the bed. He quickly stripped off his shirt and flung it to the floor before adjusting his pose in the camera. He moved around, trying to get his entire socked foot in the photo and the upper part of his body with his middle finger up. He broke out into a scowl just before the photo took.<br />
<br />
He eagerly grabbed his phone and saw the message “Success! New photo uploaded!” and quickly, likes started coming in on his photo and his profile. He smirked, the attention he was getting felt great. His phone suddenly buzzed with a notification from an app he didn’t recognize: “New donation from FootfagMark1993”.<br />
<br />
He clicked the notification, warping back to reality and trying to figure what the hell was going on. It brought him to a list of donations from various users with similar kinky usernames, from small ones up to hundreds of dollars. Ethan was appalled at seeing all of this. People were willingly throwing away their money to him for fetish content? But he had never produced anything!<br />
<br />
A new comment appeared in a bubble at the top of the page with a $50 donation. “Master, your feet make me so horny. I wish I could be under them, sir.” To Ethan’s bewilderment, the comment pulled itself down, revealing a textbox where the keyboard auto-typed a reply: “Keep dreaming faggot. You’re more than lucky enough to get to worship a master like me.”<br />
<br />
Ethan was mortified, he didn’t want any of these horrible messages to be going to or coming from what was supposedly his account. To make matters worse, he felt the strain of a huge erection in his pants, his arousal conflicting with his thoughts. He had to do something quickly, he figured, as he tabbed out of that app and back into the first one. As he did, he felt his spare hand reach into his underwear through his jeans and start stroking his cock.<br />
<br />
The touch of his erect penis felt incredible, and Ethan was having a hard time staying focused. He clicked back to his profile and saw himself giving the camera the finger behind his huge socked foot. As he looked at the image, he started fondling the top of his penis, and moaned out loud with pleasure. He scolded himself promptly and spoke aloud: “No! I don’t want to be some fucking foot freak!”<br />
<br />
The next message that he received was a mockery of that statement - a private message from FuckingFootFreak. “hi master, ive been one of your loyal boys for ages and want to buy a pair of your sweaty socks after you’ve blown your load in them.. its so fucking hot and im so horny thinking about it. your post this morning was so fucking sexy btw”<br />
<br />
Ethan’s cock got harder than ever at reading that comment as he started to curl his toes in his socks. He started typing out a reply with his free hand, lost in the pleasure of being serviced by this total loser. “Fucking pathetic faggot.” he typed out, the irony completely lost on him. “It’s faggots like you that keep my wallet flowing, you know? That makes me a fucking horny master. Of course I’ll ship you my spunk in my sweaty size 15 socks, for the right price.”<br />
<br />
“oh master, please” replied the man on the other end, “id do anything for your huge sweaty socks and alpha jizz”<br />
<br />
As the man and Ethan described Ethan’s big feet over text, reality grew to match their description. They grew with every message sent to the very respectable size 15 that they were discussing. Elsewhere in the room, out of sight and out of mind to Ethan, his sock drawer started to fill with far many more pairs of socks than he had before, in many shapes, styles, and colors, and in his closet appeared a new shoe rack with many pairs that he’d bought with his worshipper’s money.<br />
<br />
Ethan finalized his transaction with the man, agreeing to ship the cum-stained socks out within the next day. He decided he might as well make a video of it to show all of his fans what the best servant looked like. He stood his phone up on a nearby desk and started taking a video. He stuck out his feet towards the camera and started speaking. “This is your cash master Ethan here, faggots, and a very good servant just ordered a pair of my sweaty socks off my huge alpha feet after I jizz in them. Take notes, faggots, you should all aspire to be like him and worship your master.”<br />
<br />
He leaned forward and peeled off the wool sock from his foot, wiggling his toes and exposing his bare soles on the camera. “This is what a real man’s foot looks like, faggots.” He said, before pulling his sweatpants down and stuffing his sock over his engorged cock. He rhythmically started to pump his shaft with the sock overtop, and rubbed one out, occasionally making eye contact with the camera to snarl and insult his infatuated audience.<br />
<br />
He wrapped up the video and saved a copy of just the first part, teasing to release the rest to his fans after they donated a certain amount. He looked at the post he made, sharing it to Twitter: “One of my fucking faggots wants to own a pair of my sweaty fucking socks! You can too with Cash Master Caleb on MenFootFetishApp #findom #alpha #cashmaster #paypig”<br />
<br />
He submitted it, happy with his work knowing that new donations would be coming in soon. His phone vibrated again, and Ethan looked at it, surprised that he was getting content so quickly. It was something else though, as a Match4Match notification popped up. “Profile Synchronization at 98%, entering final phase.”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, it all came back to Ethan. He ripped the jizz covered sock off of his quickly softening dick and threw it across the bed. He felt so disgusting that he had fallen right into whatever the hell nightmare that this app had given him. He looked over his body, and it seemed normal. His huge, size 15 feet stuck out of his sweatpants. He kept running the tour up, his abs were clearly visible from all of his time spent working out. He opened the selfie camera on his phone and saw his face, a cut sharp jaw, with a stubble goatee under his chin. His eyebrows were thick and pushed his face into a natural sneer.<br />
<br />
He made a grin in the camera, looking as douchey as possible. “Fuck, Caleb.” He said to himself, “Those faggots are going to be all over you. What a fucking stud you are.” He winked at his camera and closed the app, his boner back to where it came from. He pulled his right leg up to his groin and started giving his big, sexy, foot a rub. Caleb reflected for a moment. Getting into findom was weird, it was like constantly playing a character and he kind of fell into it. Having a gay foot fetish was one thing, but it wasn’t any fun unless he was on a power trip while doing it. And if there were plenty of men willing to submit to him and pay, he had no issues with making a lifestyle out of it. Hell, it even turned him on, he thought, moving his free hand to his cock again.<br />
<br />
He wasn’t paying attention to it, but a second notification appeared on his phone with no buzzer this time. “Synchronization complete. Assigning match.”</p>
