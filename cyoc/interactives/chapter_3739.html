<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary wanted with all her heart to make it back home and start life anew. She was tired of the sexual mayhiem to Pleasure Island. Even as the guards watched her drive out of the park's exit she felt her lack of human abilities. Driving the truck which Steve had used when he picked up Bob and the kids. Shifting, clutch, gas pedal was very difficult with goat legs and cloven hooves.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say she was relieved beyond words as the truck got closer to home. At last she drove into the driveway. Backing the truck to the garage door she planned to take Bob inside first.
<br />

<br />
Bob bleated wildly as Mary unloaded him from the truck's rear gate. Much tugging was needed to get the subborn buck goat into an unfamilar enclosing such as the oily garage.  Mary pulled Bob thru the side door and let him loose inside the garage.
<br />

<br />
As Bob bleated Mary stood at his old workbench and carefully opened the first vile of pink liquid. As Bob stood shaking of goat's fear Mary stepped over and poured the vile into his mouth. Bob's goat tongue went searching the lips and teeth at the taste of the potion.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly the wild bleating stopped. Bob stood very quiet, his eyes changed color from square yellow pupils to a bright round blue. His muzzel began to shift back to a flater and somewhat human nose and mouth.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Mary, is that you Mary, asked Bob as the human intellect was refreshed into his mind. &quot;It's me Bob, I'm here, I'm a goat now and have been I think for some time!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Mary kneeled down as best she could and hugged Bob's long neck. &quot;We are free of that terrible sex place, we're home and soon able to live a normal life again, I love you Bob!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bob just stood there, still complete goat he was not able physically to hug back. Yet Mary felt a lack of joy as she sat back and asked, &quot;Dear are you not happy to be home? I gave you a vile of potion that will in two days change you back to your old self.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bob walked in a circle and then looked Mary straight, &quot;I got used to that wild beastly lifestyle! I'm not sure that living and working as a human is possible after such a release of all morals. I do love you and Todd, Ann, but I felt truly wanted by each of the nanny's I mounted. I had a purpose, a physical useful porpose. Even if it was primal in it's nature the feeling of giving and the joy the nanny's had as they recieved the semen gave me fulfillment I never really had before.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You stupid ole' goat I went thru Hell and rape to get you three home. I, I wanted our home to be a home for our kids... children to grow up and make something of themselves. I don't want them to sex slaves in a breeding farm for goats!  The should go out and do something useful for themselves and humanity, not fucking day and night so Madame' Illusua can retire in Florida!  Can you really tell me that you would rather be fucking yourself stupid as a dumb beast back there rather than live as a family, asked an angry Mary?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bob's face was by now back to looking very human as were his shoulders becoming human as well.  Bob shook all over as his body shifted more to human as they talked.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Mary, Mary, Mary, how can you think that I wasn't happy being a sex driven beast. The very thought of enjoying those days gives me a ahrd just remembering, said Bob softly.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Conditioned response, in other words your body made sensual and different than what you had lived as for fourty plus years, was then free of morals, clothing, and any sense of wrong doing. In fact you were as evil as that woman!  I can't believe we are having this discussion. Bob, if I loaded you up right now in that truck and took you back there, you'd beg to be a buck goat for the rest of your life?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Mary, I could not speak, I did not feel wrong, I had a feeling of purpose, I knew what I was doing and I enjoyed myself. Even as the beastly animal exsistance took control I remembered each beautiful nany that was mounted. Their scents, the touch, my pressing into their flesh each was different and unmistakable. My life was simple, sex, eat, sex, sleep, sex, feeding, sex, sleep, sex, grazing, sex, grazing, sex, grazing, sex, grazing, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex......!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Bob, BOB, do you hear yourself! That is just what I was talking about. Three things in you life, food, sleep, and SEX! Sex, mounting, thrusting, seeding all was based on one thing sensual sex! You talk of having purpose, but sex and more sex was the only reason for them keeping you from the meat packers. In fact I was told that you were expected to wear your self out in two years and then become a fine line of Greek meats, is that what you look forward to become?&quot;
<br />

<br />
He was now uncertain about the delights of animal life. Bob was by now sitting on his flat butt as his human torso became as before. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;I don't know Mary the farm attendant kept talking to the bucks and reminding us of our usefulness. I heard him time after time and soon I didn't doubt it. I was doing their bidding and using up my life to fill their pockets. Oh Mary I've been a fools fool!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Mary smiled as she downed her vile of pink liquid.</p>
