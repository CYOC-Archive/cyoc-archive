<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun was just peeking over the horizon when Trepeeset woke up again. Remembering <br />
that he was angry with Chotsalak because he stole the medallion, Trepeeset got up to <br />
check if he had returned. His teepee was still empty. His angry face softened into a face of <br />
concern. Chotsalak was gone nearly all night. What if something happened to him? Where <br />
(or what) was he?<br />
<br />
Concerned, Trepeeset walked briskly towards the lake, the place where his father met his <br />
mother. Passing the tree where Chotsalak had his first Change, Trepeeset looked around <br />
for his friend, and also on the ground for his magic medallion. He made it to the lake, <br />
seeing nothing except the rising sun, reddening the sky around it. Trepeeset frowned. A <br />
red sky in the morning usually meant bad luck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chotsalak!&quot; Trepeeset called. &quot;Where are you?&quot; There was no answer. He walked along the <br />
lake, continuing to call Chotsalak's name. There was an eerie quiet to the morning, there <br />
was not even much noise or rustling by the animals in the forest. Trepeeset felt helpless <br />
without his medallion and best friend.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset walked past the small pasture where the horseman kept his horses. The <br />
Weecoosak people only had a few horses, but the horseman took good care of them. With <br />
worry on his mind, Trepeeset glanced into the horse pasture. Two paint stallions stood <br />
inside the fence, heads down and eating the grass. There were some brown mares behind, <br />
as well. Trepeeset kept walking ahead, wondering where on earth Chotsalak was.<br />
<br />
Wait...<br />
<br />
Trepeeset dashed back a few steps and stared at the horses. Was he seeing things? The <br />
Weecoosak people only had one stallion in their horses, but there were two paint stallions, <br />
the same size and with identical markings!<br />
<br />
&quot;Chotsalak!&quot; Trepeeset hollered. &quot;Is that you?!&quot; One horse and then the other slowly looked <br />
up at the stunned Trepeeset. Both then continued to eat. One horse walked away.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset hopped the fence to inspect the stallion. He rumbled a warning and stamped the <br />
ground as Trepeeset approached. The horse was called Galk'hay, meaning &quot;arrow&quot;, for one <br />
of the blotches of orange-brown fur on its otherwise white body which looked like an <br />
arrow. If this indeed was Chotsalak, he was clearly lost to the strong instincts of the horse. <br />
He was not wearing the medallion. If he had it on his neck when he changed, then the <br />
hemp string surely would have broken around his massive neck.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset cautiously stroked the horse. He wasn't even sure if this was Chotsalak, but the <br />
horse allowed him to pet him, his flank quivering in sections as the beast contnued to eat <br />
the grass. There was only one Galk'hay yesterday, so one of the stallions in the pasture <br />
must have been Chotsalak. But they were both acting like horses! Trepeeset knew that once <br />
Chotsalak touched the medallion again his human thoughts would return, but where was <br />
the medallion?<br />
<br />
Trepeeset had an idea. He decided to let himself relax by taking a few deep breaths. Then, <br />
he tried to connect to the medallion mentally. He was trying to tap into the essence of the <br />
medallion, trying to feel its magic. Trepeeset felt a strange pull in a certain direction. He <br />
began to walk towards the mares and the feeling became stronger. The mares scattered as <br />
Trepeeset walked amongst them. <br />
<br />
The sensation that he was feeling was like a beacon from the medallion. When it was at its <br />
strongest, he looked down and spotted the medallion, standing on its side inside a rut. <br />
Trepeeset pulled it out and brushed the dirt off of it. Heart beating, he cracked it open and <br />
spotted a long hair, unmistakably a horse's.<br />
<br />
Trepeeset sprinted back to the paint horse closer to the fence. When he got there he held <br />
the medallion against the horse's rear. A shudder went through its great body and it kicked <br />
its back legs. Trepeeset ducked out of the way just in time. &quot;Hey! Chotsalak, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The horse's head snapped around, bending its neck completely around, to look at <br />
Trepeeset. Wide-eyed, it nodded its head. Then, it closed its eyes and began to shrink. Its <br />
long muzzle pulled back into its face and its white and brown hair dissolved back into soft <br />
human flesh. Chotsalak's arms grew shorter as his hooves softened to hands and feet. The <br />
last thing to change was his long tail disappearing, shedding the long hairs as the bone <br />
pulled back into his body. Chotsalak stood there naked, throwing his arms around <br />
Trepeeset.<br />
<br />
&quot;My friend! I am so glad to see you! You have saved me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset shoved Chotsalak away. &quot;Why did you steal my medallion?!&quot; He demanded. &quot;So <br />
reckless! You could have been lost forever if I didn't find you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears began to form in Chotsalak's eyes. &quot;I am sorry, my friend. I was wrong to take your <br />
medallion.&quot; He heaved a very long sigh. &quot;I...I always wanted to be a horse, alright?&quot; <br />
Chotsalak wiped his eyes. The scowl disappeared from Trepeeset's face. &quot;I always <br />
wondered what it was like to gallop through the meadows. I would often look at Galk'hay <br />
when I walked by here and I yearned to be him.&quot; He looked Trepeeset in the eyes. &quot;I just <br />
wanted to know what it was like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should have asked,&quot; Trepeeset said gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Chotsalak sniffed. &quot;But I was embarrassed.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a long silence. Trepeeset soon showed a crooked smile. &quot;How was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chotsalak grinned. &quot;Great,&quot; he said. &quot;I had so much power. I could run so fast and breathe <br />
so deep. But I didn't know that the medallion had fallen off. Soon the horse took over and I <br />
was lost. I don't remember most of the time I was a horse. Where was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a ditch. It was strange, I could sense where it was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's lucky.&quot; The real Galk'hey trotted over to Chotsalak. He scratched him under the <br />
head. &quot;Hello, friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset tried to tie the broken string on the medallion into a knot to repair it. He then <br />
wrapped the string around his hand and held the medallion in his palm. &quot;I've always <br />
wanted to be a horse too,&quot; Trepeeset told Chotsalak. &quot;And now we both have the <br />
opportunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trepeeset began to pet the horse with the same hand that held the medallion. The horse <br />
shook its head and then stared at Chotsalak. All of a sudden, the horse began to Change! <br />
Trepeeset and Chotsalak backed away in surprise as the spotted fur was replaced by <br />
tanned human flesh, and the elongated head shrunk into something more compact. After <br />
mere seconds, the large stallion was gone, and a copy of Chotsalak was in its place!<br />
<br />
The former horse made a whinny sound, which sounded strange indeed from a human <br />
mouth. Trepeeset and especially Chotsalak were gobsmacked. Chotsalak stared into the <br />
eyes of his clone. &quot;Did the horse become...me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
The former horse stared at his new body, feeling himself with unsure hands. It bent its <br />
fingers and looked in wonder behind itself at its bare butt. It was obviously dealing with <br />
the influx of human intelligence quite well. There were two naked Chotsalaks in front of <br />
the speechless Trepeeset. Trepeeset stared the ex-horse in the eyes as it said &quot;What you <br />
do?!&quot;</p>
