<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Corbin walked down the golden hallway, he enjoyed a good puzzle and decided it would be the least dangerous out of the three and possibly have the least amount of changes. The halls were beautiful, the cielings were lined with freshly cut marble and the walls with this glistening gold which transfixed the eye it was majestic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly in IRL, he got a knock at his door. He looked in horror as the door unlocked. Walking through the door was his best friend John. He dropped whatever he was holding and made to scream. Corbin grabbed him and stopped him. But before he could knock him out the game suddenly beeped loudly. <br />
<br />
-Do you want to add another player-<br />
<br />
Corbin realised this was perfect, with some more help he could definitely take back these changes. &quot;There&#39;s no time to explain John...I need your help in completing this game then I&#39;ll change back&quot;.<br />
<br />
John was confused &quot;Dude...why would you want to change back&quot;. Corbin sighed loudly &quot;Just help me please&quot;. John nodded and he plugged in a second player. Unlike Corbin John didn&#39;t change. <br />
<br />
&quot;So umm what do you need help with&quot;. Corbin looked a the screen, &quot;I&#39;m not sure yet&quot;. John saw his avatar appear, it was just him in real life. Corbin sighed he wish that happened to him. John quickly adjusted to the controls, saying they were a little stiff and they explored forward. &quot;This place...is cool&quot; John said slowly. <br />
<br />
The room they came into was beautiful with golden statues, ruby embers and bountless treasure. It was unimaginable. John looked around the room while Corbin looked at the pedestal in the middle. He walked up to it and saw a book, he opened it slowly and read it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome Weary Traveller to my test, this test will examine your ability of thought what ails your mind. In this room are an abundance of treasure, golden coins and rupees you name it, however only one is of my own, can you guess which one&quot;.<br />
<br />
Corbin looked around at the treasure, there was so much of it. Searching it could take hours, time which they didn&#39;t have. Corbin knowing their pursuer was getting closer starting looking through the coins and trinkets. &quot;Quickly we need to find biblio&#39;s coin&quot; Corbin said. John who had now looked at the pedestal looked solemnly at Corbin, &quot;Great...just great&quot;.<br />
<br />
So they both looked for some symbol, but each coin was different making it harder to find it.  &quot;Theres no time quickly&quot; but then Corbin heard it the footprints of the monster coming up to the room. &quot;Umm...what is that!&quot; John said looking down the dark golden corridor &quot;Something bad&quot; Corbin replied now with fear in his voice.<br />
<br />
John grabbed his weapon and stood in front of Corbin &quot;Just find the treasure and lets get out of here&quot;. Corbin kept looking and looking. Until the monster was finally there. Corbin could see the light shining on the minotaur&#39;s body, he was now 5 times bigger than he was before his body twitching. Corbin could see he had longer claws and his face was more monstrous and less human. But then he also saw the place were he injected the minotaur was now spasing out fast. His hands were clenched, he was holding back the transformation at least for now. <br />
<br />
He threw down his hammer and it barely miss John who was now fighting it. Corbin thought for a moment. This wasn&#39;t a test...It can&#39;t be. He tried retracing his steps and then it hit him. What Biblio said about his ability of thought and what ails in his mind. Corbin had to guess. He picked up a coin he felt strongly about and threw it into the pedestal. There was a clink and then the door at the end of the hallway opened. <br />
<br />
Corbin grabbed John and they both rushed towards the door. However suddenly Corbin saw something rise from the coins, and there wasn&#39;t only one of them. They looked like snakes and they bolted towards them. They tried to make it towards the door but then one of them wrapped itself around Johns leg, the rest pulling him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhh Corbin help me&quot; Corbin with all his strength tried to push him back, but he realised he couldn&#39;t stay or they would both die. The minotaur was now approaching John. Corbin let John go and he screamed. The minotaur bent down onto John and to Corbins horror he saw John twitch violently as his legs started to get absorbed by the creature &quot;AHHHH CORBIN HELP&quot;. John looked In horror as his body started to twitch and grow In size, he was melding to the monster and he couldn&#39;t escape. His legs ruptured in minotaur legs and so did his entire body. He groaned in pain. But then he felt it...like some warm sensation wafted over him. He was taking over control of the minotaur, he moved his right hand and it was the minotaurs. He now had the power. He groaned in pleasure as the rest of his body was absorbed. The minotaurs face now resembling his friend Johns. &quot;Ooooh the power!&quot; he said flexing his muscles &quot;Join me corbin...it feels so good...make me stronger&quot; the monster was now five times bigger than corbin and advance towards him. Corbin looked around He ran towards the door, now the monster was chasing him &quot;Don&#39;t...r-run corbin!&quot; he said John. But luckily Corbin got away in time.<br />
<br />
IRL corbin stopped playing and looked at John, he was lying on the floor violently shaking, rubbing his cock. He was now increasing in muscle mass too. Corbin was panicking, he couldn&#39;t let this happen. Suddenly he heard the computer beep, he looked and it said...<br />
<br />
-Do you want to simulate your player two-<br />
<br />
Corbin saw the wire disconnect from Johns controller, he looked at it for a second completely confused and then realised what he had to do. John was increasing in muscle mass fast now, he groaned louder. Corbin grabbed the sparking wire and slammed it down on Johns chest. John screamed as he disappeared into the wire. Into the game. <br />
<br />
He sat there...all alone again and looked at the screen.<br />
<br />
-This will happen to you...if you don&#39;t play by our rules. We will simulate you and you will remain a monster just like your friend John- <br />
<br />
Corbin was shocked. He just lost his best friend, he continued forward anyway.</p>
