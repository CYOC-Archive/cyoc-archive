<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric was relaxing at home, kicking back on his bed in his room. He couldn’t help feeling a bit bummed out. He had intended to continue working on his auto-fellation technique when he got home. He had gotten it down to a near art form. As he lay on the bed upside-down, his back curved against the headboard, and his feet dangled past his head. <br />
<br />
What captivated his attention was the tiny dick that throbbed with need, but no matter how he contorted himself, there was no way Eric was getting it into his mouth. He sighed with annoyance as he stared up at the ceiling after giving up. “Man, I wish I still had my dick,” he told himself unconsciously. <br />
<br />
Then he froze and caught himself. With a wry smile, he contented himself, “well, at least Ethan’s putting it to good use. I mean, it is HIS dick anyway. He might as well be able to blow enjoy it.”<br />
<br />
The front door slammed closed, making Eric jerk on his bed. He rubbed his hands together with a sly smile. “Bet that’s Ethan. I can’t wait to hear how he fucked Haylee into next Tuesday.”<br />
<br />
His older brother stormed into his room, Eric’s smile flat-lined as he considered a few things that popped his expectations. Ethan looked tense, with bunched-up shoulders and eyes fixed in a tight glare, ‘why wasn’t he relaxed?’ Eric wondered to himself. The guy’s hands were balled into fists as he stomped in. He unloaded like a verbal salvo, “dude, what the fuck?”<br />
<br />
Eric sat up in bed, pulling up his slim-fit briefs to cover the bit of ‘manhood’ he currently sported. “Hey, you’re the one who barged in without knocking.” Eric defended himself. <br />
<br />
Eric took a deep breath and then asked in a coy voice, “How are things?”<br />
<br />
Ethan growled in response as he crossed his arms. “Could have been better. Haylee dragged me into the supply closet for a quickie.”<br />
<br />
Eric frowned as he responded, “that’s good… Then why do you seem so pissed about that?”<br />
<br />
Ethan rolled his eyes as he stood there, temporarily lost for words. Then, finally, he explained with deliberation, “Haylee wasn’t the problem. She was amazing. She was giving me the blow job to end all blow jobs. I thought my body was going to explode.” <br />
<br />
Eric jumped onto the good news and insisted, “awesome; she must have gotten such a kick out of seeing that impressive man-meat grow out of your crotch,” he added with a sly wink. However, when he said that, Ethan noticed a few things. First, Ethan looked as if he’d slapped him across the face. Second, rather than exuding confidence at nailing the sexy girl, he looked crestfallen. <br />
<br />
“Are you kidding me?” Ethan grumbled with blue-balls frustration. “She was blowing me when you swapped out MY dick.” Eric’s eyes widened at the possessive way Ethan talked about the tiny dick that his little bro currently sported between his legs. “I nearly choked her with it when it started growing; she started hitting me to let her go. And when she pulled away, she looked at me like I was, I was, a freak. I tried to get her to stay. I thought I could use it to satisfy her. But she practically ran out of there screaming and crying.”<br />
<br />
Eric frowned as his brain caught up with Ethan’s story. “Wait a minute, are you telling me that you had that nice dick in your pants, and you DIDN’T get laid?!”<br />
<br />
Ethan bristled as he snorted, “I was about to get laid till you messed everything up.”<br />
<br />
Eric scoffed in disbelief, “you mean you didn’t blow a load with Haylee, with?” His eyes glanced down at Ethan’s impressively stuffed crotch.<br />
<br />
“She ran away from me as if spooked,” Ethan fumed. “To be honest, this thing is more trouble than it’s worth. At least I could get off reliable with my err… I mean the other dick.” He corrected himself this time. “I haven’t gotten off with this thing,” he gestured to his crotch in annoyance, “once in two weeks. I-I…” Ethan looked up at Eric, focusing on this crotch with a look of longing before he blushed in embarrassment and looked away.<br />
<br />
Eric frowned as he got up from the bed and slipped out of the briefs. Ethan watched him in confusion as he pulled out one of the larger boxers. He stood there in nervous anticipation as Eric pulled up the roomy boxers around his waist and considered the golden glint around his ring finger. “Eric?” Ethan asked with hesitation, “what are you doing?”<br />
<br />
His little brother looked him square in the eyes as he explained, “I thought I was doing you a favor by agreeing to swap back with you, to share our dicks. I mean, that big thing WAS your dick after all.” He emphasized the word, was, causing Ethan to jerk. “If I were in your position, I’d be flaunting my stuff in everybody&#39;s face. Hell, I’d put it to use. I DID put it to good use. But I figured I’d do the brotherly thing and give it back since YOU asked. And yet, for some reason that I can’t understand, you’ve developed an attachment to the little guy.” Eric patted his crotch, which caused the bigger guy to blush with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
“So here’s the situation, BIG bro. You want this undersized pecker for whatever reason, and I’m not even going to pretend to say the last two weeks with THAT dick,” he pointed at Ethan’s crotch, “in my pants weren&#39;t the best in my short, sexually aware life. So, let’s set things straight.” <br />
<br />
Ethan watched his little brother with widening eyes as realization dawned on him, “Eric…” he barely managed to croak before he froze. His eyes were slowly drawn down to his junk. He watched as the impressive tent in front slowly deflated, as if someone let out the air from a balloon. Or more accurate to say, Eric was letting out his manliness, causing the package to go from impressive, to average, before settling somewhere at mediocre, at least for a seventeen-year-old on the cusp of manhood. <br />
<br />
Despite knowing what waited for him, Ethan slowly unbuttoned his jeans, peeked into his tight underwear, and blushed as his dick, which had been utterly soft in its large form, went rock-hard as it settled at its new size. <br />
<br />
Ethan looked up at watched as Eric’s boxers slowly tented, inflating in the front. The impressive hard-on refused to be contained as it punched under the button in front and slipped through the gap in the fabric, blossoming into an impressive display of manhood. <br />
Ethan pulled down his briefs and watched his tiny dick throb. If asked, Ethan wouldn’t have been able to decide what pushed him over the edge. Maybe it was watching Eric’s dick grow to its impressive size, or the feeling of his tiny pecker, throbbing happily to be reunited with him, or some combination of the two. Regardless, Ethan found himself overwhelmed, bowling over slightly before cumming a pathetic load onto the ground.<br />
<br />
When Ethan finally got around to looking back up, he found Eric cumming like a fire hydrant, swamping the little spot of cum he had just made on the floor.<br />
<br />
Eric looked at the mess the two of them made with approval. He stated in a firm voice, “I want to switch dicks with my bro.” Ethan blinked and waited… and waited. He looked down and realized that the little guy was still there. Eric shrugged as he slipped the ring off his finger and placed it on the bed before walking past his brother. He shimmied out of the boxers, now a perfect fit, and walked toward the bathroom. He stopped on the way out as he considered aloud, “I guess I don’t want to switch back anymore,” he smirked to his bro before strutting into the hall with a hint of confidence.<br />
<br />
Ethan stepped up to the ring with hesitation before putting it on his finger. He stripped out of his briefs and stepped into the boxers, which he now had to hold up by the hem to keep from slipping down in front. He mumbled as he stared at his crotch, “I want to switch dicks with my brother.” Somehow, not surprisingly, his tiny dick refused to grow more than the two inches it had strained to achieve. <br />
<br />
Despite this, Ethan smiled to himself as he blushed, his conscience in the back of his head whispering in a satisfied voice, ‘that’s a perfect little pecker.’ His little guy throbbed in agreement, causing Ethan to moan with need, embarrassment, and satisfaction.</p>
