 Special Skills<br />
Passive Skill: The Cursed Hero: You will level up quickly, but luck is not your friend, and evil will be attracted to you.<br />
<br />

Appearance<br />
Alex is currently a 6 foot 2 human male, 18 years old with a muscular, shaved smooth frame, tanned skin, short brown hair, blue eyes and a visible 5 o’clock shadow.<br />
Alex has a circumcised penis. 5&quot; flaccid, 9&quot; erect of average girth. He has average sized balls.<br />

<br />
Alex ended up sleeping inside the guard barracks, a game prompt encouraging him to stay to avoid missing the initiation. Waking in the morning, Alex rolled over, his semi erect cock tingling from the friction between the unfamiliar scratchy sheets. Gasping slightly, Alex found his hand reaching downwards, before the sounds of horses outside reminded him he wasn&#39;t at home.<br />
Looking around the barracks, he saw that none of the other recruits were awake, so he quickly dressed, heading out to the courtyard to see if there was time to find his brother David before the ceremony.<br />
Arriving at the barracks command office, Alex found Paladin Terydevos standing patiently at attention. <br />
&#39;I guess some game characters don’t need to sleep.&#39; Alex mused as he approached the Paladin.<br />
&quot;Initiate SteelShield, perfect timing. Follow me and we shall conduct your initiation.&quot;<br />
Alex followed the tall imposing figure, a a flight of stairs and into a large garden courtyard, where several other Paladins where waiting.<br />
Alex mentally skipped most of the following discussion around the heroics of his actions, of how highly the public and the trade merchants were speaking of the order, and of Alex specifically. He felt that in games such as these the usual fake platitudes about endless potential were a waste of his time.<br />
Then came the part to accept his vows. The knights offered forth the tenets of devotion, the common vows taken by those of the order, yet an in game note popped up, telling Alex to chose another path.<br />
Reading the note he realized he had received an in-game message from David, detailing how he should proceed.<br />
&quot;Honorable knights, while the path you walk is just, I have my own path to walk and my own oaths to make.&quot; The audible gasps from the four knight around him surprised him, but Alex remembered what he really was doing this for. <br />
He was playing this game, and this character to help his brother, in exchange for help with essay writing skills. If he didn&#39;t pass his English literature courses this year, he could kiss college goodbye. He needed to keep David happy, and with that thought, Alex dropped to one knee, placing his sword before him.<br />
&quot;I pledge my blade, my mind, my soul for my calling. Let me strive top be known for my deeds, not words.<br />
 Let me face each challenge and hardship with indomitable will, overcoming each test, as that is all those challenges really are. <br />
I pledge to hone my body to its full potential, to towards and embrace my destiny as set out for me by my patron, and the forces of good, truth and justice. <br />
So may it be.&quot;<br />
Alex arose, his body flowing with energy as he leveled up again, his holy skills losing their weakness, and the ability to call on divine magic forming inside his mind. Hi body was enhanced and he knew with certainty that no disease would ever afflict him.<br />
He stood, suddenly feeling powerful as he felt the questioning gazes of the other paladins upon him. One stepping forward.<br />
&quot;You have sworn your oath and so you have chosen the path you will walk. A path of adventuring and shifting paths. It just so happens that an opportunity for you to walk that path has already arisen. A young hunter by the name of David Shadowseer has asked for assistance with clearing the local forests of several dens of overgrown beasts. Wolves, spiders, goblins, and strange shambling giant mushrooms. This seems like the perfect task to deploy you on. Especially as it will help reduce the number of threats to the newly established trade routes you were so instrumental in forming.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded and excused himself, heading down to the barracks to find his younger teenage brother David, pacing nervously by the front doors.<br />
&quot;Alex! Are you alright, I heard you met Tarith Oren last night. He&#39;s notorious for messing with low level players in this town.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well yes and no, I guess. I can&#39;t really remember everything that happened...&quot;<br />
&quot;Damn it. He&#39;s a mid level spell caster but he&#39;s not getting stronger very fast because he is to busy trying to ruin other players experience of the game. Tell me what you remember.&quot;<br />
Several flashes of memory flooded Alex&#39;s mind causing him to squirm on the spot slightly.<br />
&quot;I-I don&#39;t want to say.&quot;<br />
David sighed as looked Alex in the eyes. <br />
&quot;If you don&#39;t tell me then I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t want my help with your essay writing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Fine! Yesterday there was a fire......  and I ended up inside this giant bathhouse......... took a quest to help the owner keep a diplomat happy.........turned out to be Tarith Oren....... He-he made me, he made me, --- I can&#39;t quite remember.....&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you cum?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wh-what?&quot;<br />
&quot;Did you cum?&quot; David asked bluntly, watching Alex struggle with his memory before giving a silent nod.<br />
&quot;Just great. Open your class analysis page and set it to share.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alex mentally walked through those steps and showed David the page, both noticing the red flagged marker. OATH BREAKING BLIGHT.<br />
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Alex asked, genuinely surprised and angry.<br />
&quot;Tarith tricked you. You agreed to take on a quest and for paladins that&#39;s an Oath. If you break an Oath you end up with blights which can cause problems with your class skills or even force you to change class.  You agreed to help the bathhouse owner but you broke the oath by allowing your own pleasure to get in the way.&quot;<br />
&quot;But he made me do it!&quot; Alex moaned.<br />
&quot;But YOU were the one who did it, choosing pleasure over the quest. No wonder he was hanging around here, he targeted you knowing that it would interfere with your class. Lets find a cleric that can absolve you for your broken oath. If you ignore it without repenting there will be bigger problems in store for you.&quot;<br />
&quot;Cleric? absolve? what are you on about?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you spend some time doing a task of repentance then the blight will disappear. You could normally approach the order  but since you are newly knighted they might strip you of your knighthood for sullying your oaths DURING their initiation.&quot;<br />
Alex silently nodded as they walked through the market place. David taking the time to ask questions. Alex watched his brother. At only 15 David was only just starting to really mature. He was 5 foot 8, very slender and a lot paler from his time inside studying and on games, compared to Alex. They both had the same colour brown hair, but David allowed the top to grow longer, combing it over all the way over to the other side, making him look a bit preppy in Alex&#39;s eyes. Yet he couldn&#39;t deny his brother was smart, very smart. <br />
Alex allowed his eyes to drift over Davids body, the slender figure wrapped up in what appeared at first glance to be a standard hunters garb, a short bow on his back and a quarrel full of arrows, but a small glimmer drew Alex&#39;s eyes in further, letting him see that the garb was actually a spell casters robe, adjusted to have legs like pants, and held tight around the waist with  a leather belt lined with small bags. <br />
<br />
David had finally found a priest who could absolve Alex of his blight, a feat made complicated by the specific oath David had made him swear.  As they walked to the temple they chatted briefly, David telling Alex about his tutorial mission, where he had taken the occupation of hunter to gain skills with a shortbow. The few powerful magic users in the game had drawn a lot of bad publicity and so many players took great pleasure in removing low level magic players, helping other classes out. <br />
David had started in the woods, and working with another player, a ranger, had helped a wood nymph remove some poachers, David finding his first spell tome within their possession. Normally the players would have split up, but David knew that low level magic users were being targeted, their quest points being watched and monitored, so decided he should gain experience along with Alex and his new ranger friend, ShadowGawker, before chasing those quests for equipment.<br />
Alex laughed at the name ShadowGawker, which David agreed with, but he had made sure their first names were the same so they could find each other easier.<br />
Arriving at a large manor at the northern edge of town, Alex looked the building up and down before turning to David. <br />
&quot;This doesn&#39;t seem like a temple.&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a secret temple. I made your oath quite strict for the benefits to your character, but I didn&#39;t think of how that would affect blight removal. I didn&#39;t expect you to get one during your tutorial mission.&quot; <br />
David hung his head low, tears welling up in his brown eyes. <br />
&quot;Hey, hey there. There&#39;s no need for tears little bro. it&#39;s not your fault. It was just some dick messing with low level players. If we level up fast enough we can take-&quot;<br />
&quot;SHHH!&quot; David shushed Alex while they hugged, before David led Alex to the front door.<br />
&quot;This is a temple to Slaanesh, an eldritch being that focuses on pleasure.&quot;<br />
&quot;Pleasure! That’s what got me my blight in the first place. How will coming here remove it?!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, their philosophy is similar to the individual oath of heroism you made. They hone their bodies to be perfect for pleasure, they don&#39;t like to talk about what they do, they would rather show inquisitive people. They embrace their pursuit of pleasure wholeheartedly and that each sexual encounter is a challenge to draw forth the most erotic energy.&quot;<br />
&quot;How is this allowed in a game with players under 18?&quot;<br />
&quot;Lots of areas are &#39;level gated, class gated or age gated&#39;  meaning that after they scan your body they will mark what areas you can and can&#39;t enter. I just happen to be a good programmer, so don&#39;t say another word about me and lets get this over with.&quot;<br />
<br />
Entering the front door, a women in her mid forties, wearing only panties approached to greet the two young men.<br />
&quot;What do we have here. Two young, virile...&quot; Inhaling deeply through her nose the women smiled. &quot;...just of age, handsome and untouched men.&quot; <br />
The women licked her lips as Alex blushed, not sure where to look and mentally trying to suppress the urge to look at her large breasts, and to stop his twitching cock from hardening.<br />
&quot;How can I help the two of you? Would you like me to show you the pleasures Slaanesh offers?&quot;<br />
&quot;We need to speak with one of the priests, Father Donnahan, I believe. We seek absolution.&quot; David spoke up, Alex watching the dice roll numbers appear in their shared message box.<br />
(Charisma DC 15, roll 9, FAIL)<br />
&quot;Father Donnahan has cloistered himself away in his room for the last 3 days, and We do not interrupt the priests solitude for just anything. However, I&#39;m sure I can keep you both entertained while we await for him to emerge.&quot;<br />
Alex cleared his throat and stepped forward.<br />
(Charisma DC roll 15, roll11 smooth talker choose CON modifier +5, result 16 SUCCESS)<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry my dear... sweet woman. We have plenty of time and .... Endurance, so we can conduct our business after. Unfortunately, our message for the Father has a short time limit.&quot; Alex paused between words, letting the woman&#39;s hand rest against his chest plate, feeling the metal warmed from its contact with him.<br />
&quot;I suppose I could let you in to see him... if you promise to come see me afterwards.&quot; The woman purred as David nodded, allowing the woman to take his hand.<br />
She led them up to the top floor where she led them to one of the central rooms, knocking heavily on the door, before leaning in and whispering. Imparting some of Slaanesh&#39;s influence into the door. The wooden framed opened, and the women made a show of rubbing herself against David and Alex as she sauntered back towards the stairs.<br />
Entering the room, Alex was immediately hit by the warm humid air in the room, his nostrils filling with the smell of sweat. The room was large, with a bed, a bookcase, several tables covered with all sort of sexual instruments all lined up along the sides. In the centre, surrounded by several dangling chains was a middle aged man, approximately 6 foot tall, wearing only a black leather thong. His frame was muscular, his abs barely visible under thin layer of fur that covered his chest, stomach and legs. His head was shaved to a short, dark stubble and turning to see the boys, his eyes were a deep dark brown, that contrasted to the slight reddish brown of David&#39;s eyes.<br />
&quot;What brings you to disturb me?&quot; <br />
The man asked with a hint of anger in his voice.<br />
&quot;Forgive us father, but I seek absolution for my friend here. He has sworn an oath of heroism this morning, but last night he was tricked into breaking an oath he didn&#39;t understand.&quot;<br />
&quot;yes, yes, very interesting, but why would I be interested in fixing a blight against his holy character?&quot; Father Donnahan raised his voice more, agitation growing.<br />
&quot;You can read the recent sexual past of others, even if they cannot remember it themselves. Just read his and you will see.&quot;<br />
Gruffly the priest ushered Alex into the centre of the room, having him stand in the centre of the chains before grabbing some green coloured powder from a bowl on a nearby table.<br />
<br />
Throwing the powder to the ground, Alex and David watched as it turned into mist, shifting and swirling as it formed a magical circle around Alex&#39;s feet, light emanating up through the mist before suddenly it shifted, swirling into a small dense cloud that floated towards Father Donnahan&#39;s opened palm. As the orb of green smoke rested in the priests palm, he inhaled deeply, small wisps of green smoke flowing from the orb into his nose.<br />
&quot;Interesting! I see potions. Potions of obedience, of lust and of sexual sensitivity. I see you being overdosed on the sexual sensitivity potion. I see hands, many hands running over your manly form, more smoke, glowing purple eyes and building lust, lust kept under control of another, lust wanting release but denied until you decide you don&#39;t wan&#39;t anymore. Finally, I see, Ohhhh.&quot; <br />
Father Donnahan groaned, his hands dropping the orb of green smoke as one hand twisted and tweaked his nipples, the other groping the leather encased cock.<br />
&quot;You want absolution because you were made to climax in detriment to your quest, the promise you made on unwitting oath to fulfill?&quot;<br />
Alex nodded glumly as the priest stopped fondling himself, stepping forward.<br />
&quot;I can help you, but it will take anywhere from 2 -12 hours and cost you 50 gold for the magical materials I will be using. Once we start, we can&#39;t stop until we have absolved you of your blight. Agreed?&quot;<br />
&quot;Agreed. Alex do you have the 50 gold?&quot; David answered, causing Alex to go fumbling through his knapsack for the gold.<br />
&quot;Very well. Lets begin. First you need to remove all your equipment, and then return to the center here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex looked doubtfully at the priest, but obliged, slowly shedding his armor and clothing until he was standing in just his white loincloth.<br />
The priest looked his body up and down, nodding approvingly before raising his hands high and then clapping them together three times rapidly.<br />
Large leather cuffs appeared around Alex&#39;s ankles, thighs and wrists. Black tendrils of shadow wrapping around his torso and solidifying into a leather harness. Then without warning Alex was suddenly lifted of the ground, the chains suddenly drawing in and connecting to the different cuffs and harness, leaving Alex spread eagle at a 45 degrees angle as Father Donnahan stepped forward, slowly removing Alex&#39;s loincloth.<br />
(1d12 roll, result 7 hours)<br />
(Hourly constitution check, DC 15, rolls made with +5 CON modifier but -2 Sensitive penalty. Results by hour 16,14, NAT 20,21,5,11,6)<br />
The first hour (Result 16 SUCCESS)<br />
Alex was helpless as Father Donnahan reached forward and started rubbing his body, his coarse hands trying to emulate the massage Alex had received the day before. However the priest lacked the skill and chemical support that Billy had on his side, and combined with Alex&#39;s embarrassment about his body being on display to his brother, including his 5 inch flaccid penis, Alex was able to resist getting hard.<br />
&quot;Very good, resist as mush as you can, just know that I will continue under the magic underneath us fades and the chains release you. As I said, it will be anywhere from 2 - 12 hours. Lets see how long you last.&quot;<br />
The priest replied with a sadistic grin.<br />
Hour two (14 FAIL)<br />
As they entered the second hour, the priest had already tried rubbing, massaging, blowing cold warm air all over Alex&#39;s skin, spending very little time on Alex&#39;s unresponsive genitals. However a clock chime rang out from the darkness, causing Father Donnahan to look up into the darkness and grin, before switching to using his tongue, lapping at every inch of exposed flesh starting from Alex&#39;s toes, all the way up to his neck, yet still avoiding his groin and mid line. Alex was perturbed by this, yet he was also confused at how pleasurable the rough tongue lapping at his body was, the older man seemingly enjoying the taste of his skin and sweat.<br />
The entire time David was watching, although he was also exploring the room, eyeing up different tools on the tables, and even taking several tomes from the bookcase to rifle through, clearly trying to distract himself from Alex&#39;s nude form being groped and molested. <br />
The second hour was nearly up when Father Donnahan&#39;s tongue finally reach Alex&#39;s nipples. The small pink circles slightly hard despite the warm air. The sensation of the rough tongue on them was a shock that caused Alex to gasp, and then unsuccessfully stifle a moan as the Priest focused all his efforts on licking, sucking and swirling his tongue around Alex&#39;s hypersensitive nips.<br />
With red faced shame Alex felt his dick slowly bobbing to life, the priest laughing triumphantly as he continued to abuse the poor teens exposed nubs.<br />
The third hour. (result Natural 20, CRITICAL SUCCESS)<br />
Alex&#39;s cock had just reached maximum hardness as another chime rang out in the distance. The priest pausing for a moment while he waited to see if the chains would release Alex or not.<br />
Alex stared down at his defiantly hard cock, swaying gently, the head just in his view as the priest started to gently nibble on his nipples. An out loud gasp of combined pleasure and pain caused Alex to look up, locking eyes with David who had lifted his head from the tome he had been reading for nearly half an hour.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at me, little bro. Don&#39;t look at me.&quot; Alex pleaded, a tear in his eye, as his brother nodded his understanding and forced himself back into his tome. The shame and humiliation of being made turn on by a middle aged man in front of his little brother sent Alex&#39;s mind into overdrive. His mind fought now, fighting against the pleasurable sensations as he willed his cock down.<br />
He was unsuccessful, but he was not quite as aroused, his eyes looked onto his brother, his mouth repeating the words. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me little bro, don&#39;t look at me.&quot;<br />
The fourth hour (result 21 SUCCESS)<br />
As the next chime rang out, Father Donnahan switched tactics again, moving his head down, slowly brushing his hand and blowing gently on Alex&#39;s exposed cock head, his free hand still twisting and pinching Alex&#39;s nipples while the muscular brunette continued his little mantra, distracting himself with David&#39;s activities and making sure his brother didn&#39;t look at him for more then a second.<br />
He watched David scour through several tomes, before selecting one  and bringing it to a table covered with potions, vials of clear glass but filled with glowing fluids, swirling like miniature galaxies inside. David read through several pages, before switching two of the blue potions positions. lifting one and after checking the priest wasn&#39;t paying him any attention, slowly chugged it, being careful to place the empty bottle at in the middle of the selection where it wouldn&#39;t be seen among all the other illuminated bottles.<br />
Finally David placed the tome back, picking up another one to read where he sat next to his satchel.<br />
The hour was almost up, and Father Donnahan was starting to lose patience, clearly expecting the spell to run out soon, and had progressed to using his fist to alternate between fast and slow rhythmic strokes along Alex&#39;s still hard shaft. The priests mouth returning to Alex&#39;s defenceless nipples. Alex&#39;s continued his babbling chant the entire time.<br />
<br />
The fifth hour (result 5 FAILURE)<br />
Another chime and the priest escalated his efforts again, this time dropping to his knees and slowly engulfing Alex&#39;s hard meat into his mouth, one hand pulling gently against the overstimulated teens churning balls, the other reaching up and continuing their nipple onslaught.<br />
Alex tried to keep his eye contact up, but as the priest lurched forward, noisily gagging on his long meat, Alex saw David look up. The shame of being seen with his hard dick in another man&#39;s mouth was too much, and Alex couldn&#39;t maintain eye contact with David any longer. Shamefully dropping his head he looked down at the priest, expertly worshiping his cock. It felt incredible, and the sight combined with the incredible warmth cause flashbacks of his cock inside Tarith&#39;s mouth the previous night.<br />
It was all suddenly became too much. Alex didn&#39;t know where to look, he couldn&#39;t move, his arms and legs were slowly becoming tired from hours of struggling and his balls were filling up. <br />
He couldn&#39;t hold it back any longer.<br />
&quot;No, oh fuck, no, no ,NOOO!&quot; Alex cried out as his cock erupted, filling the priest eager mouth as the older man lurched forward, shoving the full length down his throat and swallowing every drop, carefully sucking every single remnant of cum from the hard shaft as he drew back.<br />
Alex looked up, his face flushed and tears forming from disappointment and shame and saw David staring at him, wide eyed. He felt like he had failed, in the biggest way possible.<br />
Then a sudden friction against his tender cock head pulled him from his self misery. Looking down, Alex saw the priest holding a closed fist around his shaft, while rubbing his open palm over the top of his vulnerable cock. <br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it over? Didn&#39;t I fail?&quot;<br />
The priest laughed, a deep thraoty laugh as he sped up his polishing, causing Alex&#39;s to writhe and cry out.<br />
&quot;Only a little. But what you are doing is honing your body against such attacks in the future. Plus no one ever leaves MY bondage without cumming at least once.&quot;<br />
&quot;No. NO. LET me down, I can&#39;t take any more!&quot;<br />
Alex cried out, pausing as the priest released his overtired genitals, standing up and looking him in the eyes with a gentle smile.<br />
&quot;The chains will release you when they are ready and not a moment longer. You are not finished being tested. It is as Slaanesh wills it.&quot;<br />
Snapping his fingers, a red ball gag appeared in his hand, which the priest promptly used to quiet down Alex&#39;s complaints. His words devolving into drooling and muffled groaning as the large muscular man dropped to his knees again.<br />
Hour Six (result 11 FAIL)<br />
The next hour was torture for Alex. His cock and balls ached, forced to remain hard at the constant manipulation of the muscular older man. Pausing only briefly to coax and tease him. He was covered in a thin layer of sweat as drool trickled from his mouth down onto his exposed chest. The priest taking great pleasure in his his own spittle as lubricant for his nipple torture, or even licking up some of the long strands to help lubricate his expert oral ministrations.<br />
Alex was losing a battle of wills, to drained to focus on any specific thing. The ball gag removing his ability to speak his mantra clearly, and as a result it no longer helped hold back the growing pleasure. Alex had barely noticed that David had left the room for a few short minutes, returning quickly and adjusting the table of potions slightly, before returning to observe the  perverse abuse of his own brother between reading pages of tomes.<br />
The end of the hour was approaching, although Alex had lost all sense of time, when suddenly the priest stopped, a tight fist wrapped around the base of his cock while he stared up at Alex, the muscular mans face red and shiny with spit and sweat.<br />
&quot;There is one final thing that I&#39;m sure neither of you knew about the absolution of Slaanesh, something quite important. The first ejaculation is expected and forgiven, but for those trying to resist, every ejaculation after is punished, hehe.&quot;<br />
Alex tried to cry out a protest, but the priest wasn&#39;t listening. Sliding a large black band over Alex&#39;s cock and then gently guiding his balls through, Alex found his cock hardening from the cock rings placement. <br />
A sadistic grin from Father Donnahan sent a shiver down Alex&#39;s spine as suddenly the priest sped his tempo up rapidly. His tongue swirled around Alex&#39;s cock head between the fast and deep bobbing of his head. His throat muscles squeezed and massaged the aching member. One hand had stopped abusing his nipples but was just circling closely. Teasing in a way that made Alex gasp, almost wishing the fingers would just renew their assault on his sore, expectant nipples. Then the final hand started to massage and stroke Alex&#39;s taint, placing even more mental pressure against the mentally drained man as his body was suddenly passing the point of no return.<br />
Alex&#39;s body shuddered as he came a second time. Father Donnahan leaning backwards and pumping each shot of cum onto his chest and face, smiling in triumph.<br />
Alex finally slumped feeling beyond defeated as the priest continued to tease him with slow languid strokes. Surely it was enough, he had virtually nothing left.<br />
Hour Seven (result 6 FAIL)<br />
The clock chimed through but the sound was suddenly deeper, louder, and sent vibrations running through everyone in the room.<br />
Father Donnahan stood tall, leaning his cum splattered head forward close to Alex&#39;s face. Neither noticing David standing close by directly outside the small central circle.<br />
&quot;The first punishment will come into effect when you are released. A full ten days of magically enforced chastity. Hopefully that will help you build your &#39;heroic&#39; resolve, having to focus on other things, but we have just under an hour and I think we can get one more load out of you.&quot;<br />
Alex shook his vigorously begging through the slobbery ball gag, the words not forming coherently but the look in his eyes unmistakable.<br />
&quot;Absolution always comes at a price.&quot; <br />
The priest grinned as he ducked behind, kneeling behind the exhausted man. David watched with wide eyes, not knowing what the priest was going to do, but morbidly curious to see it for himself.<br />
Alex felt the first lick like a lightning bolt up his spine. The second and third caused him moan loudly, more drool escaping around the ball gag as he writhed unsuccessfully, attempting to pull his body up and away from the invading tongue, but his strength was spent.<br />
Collapsing backwards Alex&#39;s had no choice but to endure the priests tongue licking and probing his exposed virginal ass. Alex had never had anything in there, but had shaved his ass along with everything to avoid any potential complaints about smell from the girls at his high school.<br />
Shit! He was so tired he couldn&#39;t even remember the name of the girls he was trying to impress.<br />
Instead Alex had to endure his ass being tongue fucked by a perverted expert, the mans rough hands lifting, kneading and pulling his ass checks to alternate access and rub the mans beard and head stubble against the teens smooth shaven flesh.<br />
The tongue fucking was a complete mind fuck for Alex, who knew he was straight and had thought there was no way his ass could make him feel good in any way, yet right now this tongue was driving him wild, his cock slowly bobbing back to life.<br />
Alex&#39;s entire body was shivering, his hips gently swiveling in a small circle as his found his body responding against his will to the invading tongue.<br />
His orgasm was approaching the climax building as he groaned and moaned. David watching with wide eyed anticipation as Father Donnahan&#39;s pace built, the intensity rising as Alex&#39;s face twisted in exquisite agony, his teeth chewing on the red ball gag as his overwhelmed mind marveled that he could be brought to orgasm from a tongue licking his asshole.<br />
The cum bubbled forth, the first two shots weakly launching forth from his achingly tired cock. A chime rang out through the air, indicating the hour way up, the cuffs, ball gag and harness evaporated as Father Donnahan guided Alex forward, his muscular frame slumping forward onto his knees, his cock still tricking cum as the priest continued his onslaught, not stopping until the small flow of cum ceased, the brown haired teen collapsing on the floor, totally spent.<br />
Yet the priest wasted no time, dragging Alex onto his knees before reaching for the nearest potion on the closest table. Grabbing the one that David had subtly made sure would be the first within reach. Popping the cork out, Father Donnahan lifted the bottle to Alex&#39;s lips, the young teen too stung out to comprehend what was happening just starting swallowing the sweet tasting liquid. <br />
Then the priest grabbed another bottle and gulped it down rapidly, his other hand groping his bulging package.<br />
David smiled as he pulled his cock out through a gap in his robe. The moment he had waited all day for was happening. <br />
Alex felt another tingling in his cock and groaned as he looked down dumbly at it. His cock was back to full hardness, 9&quot; long inches, yet something was off. With each heartbeat it seemed to be pulling into himself, like it was deflating but not going soft. the tingling had spread to his balls and Alex&#39;s found his hand fondling the average sized orbs as the slowly shrunk as well. Looking up at the priest in confusion, Alex&#39;s saw the priest rubbing his own groin in confusion, the sly smile gone.<br />
David on the other hand was grinning widely. The 2 inch micro dick that was the curse of his 15 year old life was growing, extending as the two marble sized balls filled out their pouch. <br />
(Rolled 1d8, result 5)<br />
Alex stared at his dick at as it finally settled at around four inches, just a little longer then his index finger. His mind should have been panicking but he was so tired he had no capacity to process such an outrageous event. His balls had shrunk as well, and felt lift two small tender cherries in their little pouch. Before Alex could do anything further, the black cock ring that had not disappeared along with the other gear, suddenly enveloped his groin in shadows, solidifying into a cold steel cock cage, preventing his newly shrunken dick from being able to get even slightly hard.<br />
Raising his head back up, Alex saw the rising anger in Father Donnahan as his whipped out his impossibly thick 8 inch cock, angrily slapping it against his palm and willing it to grow.<br />
On their side, David had watch the little AA battery in his pants stretch, inflating slowly to a respectable 7 inches, his balls growing to a normal size as he gently stroked his no longer embarrassing member. His plan had worked, after reading through several tomes over the last 7 hours. His time had not been wasted. <br />
Tucking his new size back into his pants, David quickly helped Alex get dressed as the priest&#39;s anger at his own cock grew and grew. Finally he looked up at the two dressed men.<br />
&quot;YOU!&quot; His voice roared as his eyes locked with David.<br />
&quot;You have defiled MY ritual,  inside MY OWN SANCTUM.&quot;<br />
David calmly turned around, his calm response already prepared.<br />
&quot;As is the will of Slaanesh!&quot; <br />
A crack of thunder echoed within the chamber as a sinister feminine laugh echoed around them, the priests anger fading as realization sank in. Slowly turning into a wicked smile as the two boys fled. He understood what had occurred now, and what his patron had willed.<br />
