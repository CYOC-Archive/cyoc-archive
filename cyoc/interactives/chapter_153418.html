<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave and Luke heard a voice call from the long hallway &quot;Dave? Doko ni imasu ka?&quot; Dave would recognize that voice anywhere. In fact, even Luke could identify it now that he had the same accent. It was Dave&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crap, we need to change you into someone else! We can&#39;t let my dad see you like this&quot; Dave said in a hurried, yet quiet voice.<br />
<br />
Luke nodded, &quot;Okay, can you bring me someone else&#39;s clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t have enough time for me to check another room, my dad is gonna be in here any second. You&#39;ll need to make do with what&#39;s in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But there&#39;s just the sumo stuff in here, won&#39;t your dad find it suspicious if there&#39;s a sumo in your house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s less suspicious than my dad having a doppelganger! Just get changed, I&#39;ll figure the rest out&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke wasn&#39;t happy about it, but Dave was right. He ran and grabbed the Mawashi of the rival of Dave&#39;s ancestor. He was hopeful that the rival&#39;s form would be a bit more appealing than his appearance as Dave&#39;s ancestor. He quickly stripped behind the Shoji and put his legs through the mawashi, activating the medallion.<br />
<br />
Luke felt that bloating sensation again, letting out a few burps. He was gaining weight much more rapidly this time. His swollen gut was of course the center of attention. It could have easily doubled his weight already. It was jutting out proudly, looking like it was going to outgrow the large mawashi Luke was wearing. He poked his stomach thinking it would be squishy, but the car ball was taut like a taiko drum. Luke could tell he was growing larger than Dave&#39;s ancestor, and it wasn&#39;t all fat, there was also muscle. This was most obvious on his arms and legs, which had a body builder&#39;s level of mass. With the strength of his pecs, his moobs were firm and showed no signs of sagging.<br />
<br />
 Next his ass ballooned outward, adding balance with his previously front-heavy body and competing with his gut for how much it could stretch out the mawashi. The force of this bloat caused Luke to let out a thundering fart. There wasn&#39;t much room left in the mawashi, yet Luke&#39;s dick managed to grow in both length and girth, with a heft pair of balls to match. The constraint of his dick against the mawashi gave him an oddly pleasurable sensation, and he was sporting an erection.<br />
<br />
His jet black hair was styled into a sumo chonmage, and he grew thick sideburns down to his jaw which framed his stern face. Though it was very plump, he had very handsome Japanese features. One could tell he had a powerful jaw under his fat chin. Luke had once again become a sumo wrestler in his 30s, and just in time for Dave&#39;s father to enter the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;David, anata wa koko ni imasu ka?&quot; David&#39;s dad asked in his stern accent as he entered the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Dad, I&#39;m in here&quot; Dave replied. Dave&#39;s father went silent. He was caught in awe of the sight of his son standing next to an enormous sumo wrestler. With the awkwardness in the room building, Luke thought their rude failed until Dave&#39;s dad suddenly bowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Irasshaimase!&quot; He said respectfully. Luke simply stood, not knowing how to respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, bow back&quot; Dave whispered to Luke. Luke had to spread his legs and squat in order to maintain his balance, but managed to bow back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thank you. You know, you can speak in English if you want to&quot; Luke said awkwardly in a thick Japanese accent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Dave&#39;s dad was clearly surprised that someone who looked and sounded like Luke would request to speak in English, &quot;welcome to our home. It is an honor to host a rikishi such as yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rikishi?&quot; Luke whispered to Dave.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a term for a professional sumo wrestler&quot; Dave whispered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the honor&#39;s all mine! It&#39;s nice to meet you, I&#39;m Lu-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ryuji!&quot; Dave interrupted, &quot;Yamazaki Ryuji&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Inokawa Daizo and this is my son, Inokawa Dave. What brings you to our home, yamazaki-zeki?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... well Dave told me you had this shrine full of sumo stuff, I just had to see it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes&quot; Daizo walked up to the display holding his ancestor&#39;s mawashi &quot;This is one of the many prides of the Inokawa family. Long ago our ancestor wore this very mawashi. I&#39;m sure he would feel honored to know a fellow rikishi was here. Hmm, there is suppose to be another mawashi displayed here as well. It actually looks much like yours&quot; Daizo chuckled. Luke was sweating bullets at this comment. &quot;Dave, could you please look for that missing piece? Oh, and while you&#39;re at it, please look for a yukata for Yamazaki-zeki. I don&#39;t want him getting cold.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Dad&quot; Dave nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait!&quot; Luke leaned down to whisper in Dave&#39;s ear, &quot;You can&#39;t leave me alone with your dad. I have no idea how to act like a sumo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Luke, splitting up is actually the perfect opportunity. You can keep my dad distracted while I find some new clothes for you to transform with. My dad really respects sumo wrestlers, maybe even loves them, so just show him the same respect and you should be fine.&quot; Dave bowed to his father and ran off on his errand.<br />
<br />
&quot;My son may take some time. Would you like to see the garden?&quot; Daizo offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure uh, but I don&#39;t know how we&#39;ll get there. I can&#39;t fit through the halls.&quot; Luke hoped Daizo wouldn&#39;t notice that it wouldn&#39;t make sense for him to fit on the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is alright, we don&#39;t need to use the halls to reach the garden. We can use the entrance you came through&quot; Daizo grabbed a seemingly random part of the wall which turned out to be a sliding door and opened it. &quot;Since this room holds a display dedicated to sumo, I installed this door so that a proper rikishi could enter. I simply had it hidden to keep the room&#39;s aesthetic&quot; Daizo mentioned while leading Luke down the short but wide hallway which led to the backyard. It was a perfectly maintained Japanese garden, with lush green cut by a gentle Creek. &quot;The Inokawa family must be loaded to pay for the landscaping on this place&quot; Luke thought to himself. He was also thinking of topics he could talk to Daizo about. He tried to remember anything interesting from when he took Daizo&#39;s form.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice tattoo, is it koi fish?&quot; Luke asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you noticed that...&quot; Daizo&#39;s embarrassment staining his voice, &quot;I hope it did not offend you.&quot; He instinctively grabbed his suit sleeve, attempting to hide it. The two stopped at a bridge over a pond full of koi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I be offended? I think it looks cool on you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Daizo rolled his sleeve up and rested his tattooed arm on the bridge&#39;s railing, watching his tattoo and the koi swimming beneath. &quot;When I lived in Japan, people who saw my tattoo would guess that I was, well... I was young, rebellious, and made a few dumb choices. Eventually I didn&#39;t want that life anymore, but it was hard to be a regular salary man with my tattoo. So the kids and I moved to the States.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s stupid. If you didn&#39;t move here, I never would have met Dave! Oh, um, and you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too kind&quot; Daizo chuckled, &quot;honestly, when I was a boy I had dreamed of becoming a sumo wrestler just like my ancestor, just like you. I wonder where fate would have taken me if I had chosen that path.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we would have met in the ring. I&#39;m sure you would be great at it, maybe you could even win.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Yamazaki-zeki.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey don&#39;t mention it. And no need to be so formal, Daizo. You can just call me Ryuji.&quot; Luke clamped his strong hand on Daizo&#39;s shoulder<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Ryuji&quot; Daizo blushed and patted Luke&#39;s back in return, lightly grazing the wrestler&#39;s love handles. The skin was tender there, sending waves of pleasure rippling through his body and teasing his already erect cock. &quot;Man this sumo thing is tight! It feels like it&#39;s constantly rubbing my dick&quot; Luke thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;You seem tense, Ryuji. Is there anything I can do to relieve the tension?&quot; Daizo asked.</p>
