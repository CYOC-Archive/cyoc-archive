<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tim was cooking on the stove top with a fry pan, having placed some bacon into it. When the bacon had crisped some, he was going to start some eggs. As he turned to ready the eggs, he felt an odd tingling across his body and a distinct pressure in his crotch, making him let out a small groan of pleasure. This was soon followed by another, stronger wave emanating from his croch and causing him to moan out loud and making him grab the counter top. As the wave subsided he tried to regain some composure before another wave of pleasure hit him, but soon found the next wave upon him was stronger than the two previous and caused him to feel tight in the crotch of his pants and to groan even louder as he couldn&#39;t hold on to the counter top and fell to the ground with his groan. Tim watched as a rather impressive tent formed in his shorts as he felt himself growing hard. <br />
<br />
“What… Uhh.” Tim mumbles as another wave of pleasure hit him. He scrambled for his zipper, wondering what was happening to his penis when suddenly his khaki cargo pants shifted, shrinking into shorts before the zipper vanished and the cloth shifted to a black mesh that now allowed his much larger tool enough space to be fully erect, but was now supported by a nicely sized and well accommodating jock strap that Tim wore whenever he was wearing his gym shorts--which was frequent. At first Tim thought it all was absolutely strange until the next wave of pleasure washed over him and he felt his legs stretch out and plump up with muscle, and his gym shorts to feel tighter as his glutes swelled to accommodate for his longer and stronger legs--and growing feet--his sneakers shifting from narrow All-Stars to wide supportive basketball shoes. Tim no longer felt things were so strange--he&#39;d been running, squatting, and stretching his leg muscles for well over a year now--it&#39;s what made him so good at Track in the spring.<br />
<br />
Another wave of pleasure came from his crotch--keeping his rod strong and straight within the jock. Tim&#39;s flat and thin torso stretched a bit longer and then his shoulders pulled a tad wider, and then he felt his muscles begin to plump up and define themselves--stretching out his once baggy t-shirt until it too transformed, now into a football jersey that now just fit him... rather tightly, leaving very little to the imagination with how tight it was, allowing him to display his pecks and abs through his jersey. Tim&#39;s arms then stretched a bit to match his growth in height and then his biceps and triceps swelled and his hands expanded and grew a bit calloused until his athletic build and memories of throwing footballs around since elementary school, and did some volunteer work on a local farm, now flooded his mind.<br />
<br />
The last part of Tim to transform was his head and neck, as a last wave of pleasure released from Tim&#39;s crotch, his neck swelled with some muscle and his adam&#39;s apple grew to be fairly prominent, giving his voice a lower more rumbly register. His face became a tad sharper--though not completely--and his dark brown hair darkened to black--across his entire body, and a dusting wisp of a mustache appeared on his top lip as Tim groaned out in complete ectasy. He could contain himself no longer, and so Tim stuck his large paw of a hand down his shorts and into his jock and wrapped his hand around his straight rod and began to pump. He pumped away until he came in his jock--not the first time he&#39;d done that, but he&#39;d have to clean up when he got home.<br />
<br />
Tim was brought back to reality to the smell of burning bacon, and quickly scrambled back up on his feet and took the smoking bacon burnt to a crisp off the burner and turned it off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit,&quot; he muttered. Well, it wasn&#39;t the first time he&#39;d proven himself useless in a kitchen. After all, he hadn&#39;t had time to learn how to cook what with football, swimming, basketball, and track practices all keeping him busy year round. Not to mention all the studying he had to do in order to keep his grades up in order to be on all those teams. It was a wonder he had a social life at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Tim is something--wrong?&quot; asked Alice as she came down and stared at him. Something she&#39;d been doing more often since he&#39;d been tasked with being the freshman&#39;s tutor. He recognized that look, he&#39;d been a freshman with a crush once too--though he&#39;d lusted after a senior girl, who&#39;d taken one look at him and used him to make her ex jealous after her ex suggested that perhaps they choose to separate since they&#39;d be going to separate schools. Tim had thought it was love, but had been in for a rude awakening as to Jess&#39;s true feelings once arriving at Prom, only to find his date kissing her ex in a darkened corner of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to own a restaurant when I graduate--that&#39;s for sure,&quot; joked Tim.<br />
<br />
&quot;You burnt the bacon?! But you always cook it so well,&quot; said Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for the vote of confidence, but cooking was something I never was all that good at--too busy with sports and my studies,&quot; said Tim with a laugh as he scraped the bacon off of the pan and into the trash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... sure... do you have something you want to... um ask me?&quot; asked Alice with a knowing grin. <br />
<br />
Tim restrained himself from rolling his eyes. The girl, while cute for a freshman, and clearly having a crush on him, was just like a little sister to him. It was something he&#39;d tried to make clear to her over the past few weeks, but something she clearly hadn&#39;t been picking up on. The news he had now, though, should kill all thoughts of that... for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, do you think I should take Erica to the movies and then dinner this afternoon or dinner and then the movies this evening?&quot; asked Tim, as though he were asking a sister. The look of shock in Alice&#39;s eyes was immediately noticeable.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-who&#39;s Erica?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s a girl in my grade who I just asked out after the football game last week. You&#39;d like her.&quot;<br />
<br />
The look of heartbreak was immediate, but it definitely was better for her to be heartbroken now and let down easy this way, before she&#39;d made a fool of herself publicly throwing herself at him like he&#39;d done with Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re grade? But I--aren&#39;t we... uh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I know I&#39;ve been helping you out a lot with your homework these past few weeks, but try to remember that I&#39;m a whole year older than you are, and a whole grade ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t forget, I just... don&#39;t laugh at me! Oh... shut up!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tim couldn&#39;t help but laugh as Alice shoved him, barely moving him, which seemed to surprise her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, we both know that math isn&#39;t your strong suit, but I thought we&#39;d at least mastered simple addition,&quot; he teased her.<br />
<br />
Alice blushed in embarassment and contorted her face in fury all at once.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I just some dumb kid to you?!&quot; asked Alice<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not dumb, and not a kid, per se... more like a little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I--I&#39;ve got to fix this!&quot; said Alice, seemingly fighting back tears with a determination or anger--Tim couldn&#39;t tell, as it seemed both emotions mixed too well with one another in this instance.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean, Alice?&quot; asked Tim, but all he saw was Alice turn to rush out of the kitchen, and with his improved reflexes he grabbed her wrist before she could go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, look... I know you&#39;ve had a sorta crush on me for a little while now... I didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings. I was trying to let you down easy--seems I fumbled that. Any guy would be lucky to be with you... it&#39;s just, well I don&#39;t see you that way, I&#39;m sorry. I know it hurts--believe me, I&#39;ve been there, but that doesn&#39;t change the way I feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Through this, Alice had remained still and listened--even with having her back turned to him. Now that he was finished, Alice broke his grip on her wrist and hurried out of the kitchen.</p>
