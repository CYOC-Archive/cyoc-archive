<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You arrive at the fairly large dentist office, where a anthropomorphic cartoon rabbit smiling holding a large toothbrush can be seen on the sign and windows of the place, causing you to roll your eyes in its cheesiness while Zoe scowls in regret for coming to a place like this.<br />
<br />
You and your family then step inside, noticing that the front reception was manned by what appeared to be a rabbit woman, her long gray hair spilling behind her matching the color of her fur, similar to that of Eric and Luke. She looked like she had some make up done even on her furry face, though it was limited to eyeliner, her curly lashes, and a bit of cherry red lipstick just barely making contact with her non-furred parts of her lips.<br />
<br />
Your mum walks up to her but before she could say anything, the rabbit lady was already looking up at her, flashing a friendly buck tooth smile. &quot;Ah, you must be Whitney! Dr. Peter has been expecting you and your family this afternoon! Please, follow me!&quot; she says, her voice as bubbly as her smile. With that, she gets up from the small reception and leads all of you down the hall. You look her over as she passes you, noticing her cute, lithe body, a bit reminiscent of Eric if he were to wear dentist scrubs. Her chest was a little bit flat, but all that served was to accentuate her tight, bubble butt as it clung onto her pants.<br />
<br />
Before you could fawn over her appearance anymore, she leads you to a large room where you could see rows of dentist chairs set up neatly with everything needed in a clean, orderly fashion. &quot;Wow, they must expect a lot of people to get their teeth done here!&quot; you comment, looking around the amazing layout of the place.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to pat myself on the back too hard, but it is impressive, isn&#39;t it?&quot; a voice behind them says before walking in front to reveal a rabbit man in doctors scrubs followed by a few others and their own assistants in scrubs. &quot;My name is Dr. Peter and I&#39;ll be happily overseeing all of your check-ups today! Please, if you will sit down and relax. We&#39;ll also be providing full teeth cleaning for all of you. Free of charge, as thanks for being our first customers.&quot; he introduces politely as you all are lead to the five prepared dentist chairs.<br />
<br />
You lay down on the chair, noting how soft and comforting it felt, almost like plush fur. Your mind sinks into the soothing sensation as Dr. Peter walks over to your head with tools prepared in paw hands. It doesn&#39;t even occur to you that he should be wearing a mask as he motions you to open your mouth, but it didn&#39;t matter too much, as it was kind of nice to see up close how plush his brownish gray fur looked on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see what these teeth need...&quot; he says as he does a usual check of your teeth with a mirror and light. Although, you couldn&#39;t help but blush at the few times he decided to go in real close, close enough than needed to the point of feeling his warm breath huffing through his twitching nose. &quot;Okay, I see what we need to do. It&#39;ll take a little bit of extra work, but it&#39;ll be worth it, I promise.&quot; he says as an assistant brings over what appears to be a standard tank of laughing gas. &quot;Just relax and breath deeply...&quot; he says as he puts the mask over your mouth. With every breath you huff in, you mind begins to numb and drift off into pleasant thoughts.<br />
<br />
As he starts to work on your teeth, you vaguely realize that he seems to be working on the teeth other than the ones that were aching in front. What you didn&#39;t realize was that it was indeed true, as he was using a drill not on your larger front teeth, but on your canines, shaving down the teeth until they became flat and better fitted for grinding leafy greens apart.<br />
<br />
After flattening out every single pointed edge, he put the drill away and, with an assistant, finally looked at your two front teeth. You could only barely think to yourself at the strange oddity of the assistant massaging your upper lip while Dr. Peter was doing something else to your teeth, all the while feeling absolutely nothing. Of course, you couldn&#39;t see that as the rabbit assistant rubbed their furry paw hands on your upper lip, they were also molding the skin as well, bunching them up into larger mound while separating it down the middle, causing a split line to appear, just touching the bottom of your nose. In the meantime, Dr. Peter was carefully tugging at your front teeth, pulling them out further and widening them until they looked just like an anthro rabbit&#39;s, like his and their neighbors.<br />
<br />
Soon, the gas eventually worn off, but by then, they were already moving to clean your now rabbit like teeth. It was only then did you barely hear the sound of a song fading that you didn&#39;t realize all of you were listening to while your minds were under the gas. As you spit out the water your used to rinse your mouth for the last time, the dentists then raised your chair back up, along with the rest of your family, revealing all of you now had identical rabbit upper lips and teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m happy to say that there wasn&#39;t much wrong with your teeth! You all have beautiful buck teeth like anyone else would!&quot; Dr. Peter says proudly, holding up a mirror to your face as the other doctors did the same to your mum and sister. You look at your teeth and lip, admiring how cute they look, but feeling as though they were supposed to look different somehow... But you shook the thought off. If the professional rabbit dentist say everything was fine, you should listen to him! Besides, he&#39;s a professional and he even said it looked beautiful!<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankth Dr. Peter!&quot; you say, your tongue hitting your buck teeth as you talk, causing a lisp to your &#39;s&#39; sounds as you still weren&#39;t subconsciously used to having larger front teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! And be sure to tell all your friends about us!&quot; he says bubbly as he leads us to the front. The receptionist is there, looking at something on her computer before quickly closing the window out and smiling happily at us, a bit flustered at our sudden appearance. She appeared to be hiding something underneath her crotch of the scrubs but you don&#39;t think much of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of courthe! Thee you netht time Dr. Peter!&quot; Whitney says happily as we wave goodbye walking out the door. Even Zoe seemed a bit more cheerful, but you jokingly thought it was because she was still under the effects of the gas. The drive home was uneventful, as it seemed everybody, including you, was too distracted with sensually running their tongue over their clean rabbit teeth, unaware of the drastic changes that had taken place.</p>
