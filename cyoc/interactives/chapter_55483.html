<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Rick was walking down the halls towards the lost and found. He was a normal 
seventeen year old sophomore guy. Well not all that normal. His only friends were girls 
and he had a secret longing to be a girl. He thought that it was nice to be a guy but 
he just had this feeling that he was supposed to have been a girl. Even his mother 
said he was supposed to be a girl from the way she carried him and dreams that she 
had. Well he was born a boy but then when his sister came along his mom's dreams 
turned out to be accurate. His sister was named Annabelle and she was sixteen. By 
some weird fluke she was born on the same day and even the same time. People 
joked that they were supposed to be twins but he was too anxious to come to this 
world and was thus born a year earlier. They did look a lot alike too with the same 
brown hair and green eyes, the same build, and almost the same face. The only 
difference was that Annabelle's hair was down to the bottom of her ribs and she had 
breasts and curves.</p>
<p>A group of girls passed in front of Rick and he sighed inwardly. <i>"I know it can't 
happen but I really want to be a natural girl,"</i> he thought. <i>"Sure there's surgery 
but it's not natural. I know Mom, Dad, and Annabelle would support me if I decided to 
go that route especially since Annabelle dressed me up that one time and Mom and 
Dad walked in on us."</i></p>
<p>He thought back on that time. Annabelle and him were playing cards. Before they 
had started they had made a bet. If he won she would do his chores for a week. If she 
won he had to let her do whatever she wanted with him excluding anything sexual of 
course. Well he had lost and she immediately dragged him to her room where she 
pulled out an entire outfit and dressed him in it. It even included panties and a bra. 
She even put a wig on him that she had from a friend who had cancer and died. 
Everything fit and he looked so much like a girl that he could hardly believe it. The only 
problem was that he didn't have any breasts but Annabelle stuffed the bra with a lot of 
tissue and it was soon remedied. She had decided to name him Isabella and then set 
to work on a little makeup. Their parents had come in just as she was done applying 
the makeup. Instead of being mad though they said he made a good girl and should 
stay that way for the rest of the day. Well he did and he enjoyed it. It was a little nerve 
wracking when they went out to eat but no one seemed to have noticed that he was a 
guy in girl clothes. Since that time he has taken to becoming Isabella on a pretty 
regular basis though not in school.</p>
<p>He came back to the present as he opened the door to the lost and found. A 
chubby senior was sitting at the counter. "Hello Daisy," he said with a smile, "I'm here 
to get my sister's ski stuff."</p>
<p>Daisy looked up from the assignment she was doing and said, "You know where 
the box is. It's hard to believe that she could have lost all of it."</p>
<p>"Well it was all in a duffle bag and it was lost apparently," Rick said shrugging as 
he went on through. One of the things that he thought should be changed was who 
manned the desk of the lost and found. Most of them weren't bothered about making 
sure people only took what was their own stuff or what they were picking up for 
someone else. Daisy wasn't one of those and he would need to sign for Annabelle's 
stuff and show his school ID. He found the duffle bag right on top in the box so he 
grabbed it and headed back out.</p>
<p>"Ok let's check to make sure everything is there and nothing else," Daisy said as 
Rick put it on the counter. Daisy unzipped it and started to take out the items checking 
it against a list as she said, "Thermal underwear... check, socks... check, ski pants... 
check, ski jersey... check, ski gloves... check, ski mask... check, ski goggles... check, 
emergency GPS beacon... check, and duffle bag... check. Well that's everything so I 
need you to sign this and I need to see your school ID."</p>
<p>Rick did as he was instructed while Daisy put everything back and he left the lost 
and found. <i>"Annabelle will be so glad to have these back and not have to buy new 
stuff,"</i> he thought. <i>"It's strange that it had become lost in the first place. I'm sure 
we had left it in the car this morning. If she hadn't have had that cheer contest today 
we wouldn't have known it was missing until it was too late. Well at least we have it 
now and she should be back any minute then we can drive up to meet Mom and Dad. 
They should have the cabin decorated by now."</i> In his musings he never noticed 
the tingling that was running through his body. He barely noticed a couple of the jocks 
run past him eager to start the Christmas Break.</p>
<p>Annabelle pulled up a few minutes later and was glad her duffle bag had been 
found. As they drove away Rick still hadn't noticed the tingling in his body and wouldn't 
have known what changes wouldn't have known what changes would occur over the 
break even if he did.</p></p>
