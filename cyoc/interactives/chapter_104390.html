<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was miserable at the moment, he glanced back at his brother as the two headed into the house. Aaron&#39;s suffering looked even worse.  Mike hated hangovers and he hated cleaning the barn. That morning could not have sucked any more.  The hangover had made cleaning up the animal crap a million times more unpleasant than it normally was.  The putrid smell that hung in the air had a force of its own, it invaded his nose and his mouth gagging him.  It had been too much for Aaron, who threw up more than once while trying to finish the job as quickly as possible.  They hadn&#39;t set any records for speed or quality that morning.  Mike had watched from the barn as Ryan left and returned to the house.  What a jerk.  He glanced back at Aaron, he would never have abandon his brother like that, and he knew Aaron would have helped him too.  Mike was mad at Ryan.  He didn&#39;t understand how his youngest brother was so different from him, in a lot of ways the polar opposite.  Mike walked down the hall towards the ladder up to his room.  Ryan was weak and un-athletic, and didn&#39;t show any desire to improve himself.  Farmers have to be strong, Mike thought to himself, but then again Ryan more than likely wouldn&#39;t be a farmer.  Ryan was by far the smartest member of the family, he wouldn&#39;t be trapped into a life of farming; he&#39;d leave Bucktail and never come back.  This thought didn&#39;t do anything to help Mike&#39;s anger towards Ryan.  Mike climbed the ladder quickly and near silently, years of sneaking in and out had perfected his technique. He made it to the top just in time to see Ryan turn from his backpack towards Mike, naked from the waste down.<br />
<br />
Mike finished climbing into the room.  &quot;Well well well,&quot; Mike chortled, &quot;What&#39;s going on here?&quot; Ryan was mix of shocked, embarrassed.  He was too scared to move.  &quot;Noth, nothing&quot; Ryan responded weakly.  &quot;Looks like tiny Ry-guy has finally started to take after the family&quot; Mike said gesturing to Ryan&#39;s exposed penis, &quot;its about time there&#39;s some proof you&#39;re actually related to us at all.&quot;  Mike watched with glee as Ryan turned beet red, it made him smile. It made up a little for Ryan going off and having fun while the he and Aaron struggled in the barn.  He was not expecting what happened next, &quot;Its bigger than yours&quot; Ryan spat out.  Mike was shocked, it took him a moment to recover his wits,&quot;What the fuck did you just say?&quot; He locked his eyes on Ryan and took two steps towards him, Ryan broke eye contact and stared at a spot on the floor.  Mike was disappointed, what was wrong with Ryan? He had finally stood up for himself and now he was going to backdown.  Less than two inches separated the two boys, &quot;What. the. fuck. did. you. just. say?&quot; Mike repeated emphasizing every word, just as Aaron climbed up into room.  &quot;Whoa, what&#39;s going on here?&quot; a clearly confused Aaron asked, trying to get his bearings.  Backup had arrived, Ryan was going to get it now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Aaron,&quot; Mike started with an exaggerated matter of fact tone, &quot;it would appear that Ry Ry has been checking out his big brother&#39;s dicks and has made an opinion about whose biggest.&quot;  Aaron took in the entire scene, looking around the room once before taking a step towards the two and taking a look at Ryan&#39;s cock and then the cum on Ryan&#39;s comforter.  &quot;Is that so Ryan?&quot; Aaron asked, &quot;are you some kind of sick fag who gets off seeing his brothers naked, like some kind of animal?&quot; Mike could hear the anger in Aaron&#39;s voice, and he was sure that Ryan could hear it too. The fear was plain in Ryan&#39;s eyes. &quot;You know how we teach animals a lesson, don&#39;t you Ryan,&quot; Aaron continued, &quot;when a dog makes mess in the house you rub his face in it.&quot; Mike knew what his brother had planned, he moved quickly to get behind Ryan and lock his arms behind his back. Ryan put up a pathetic fight, he didn&#39;t have the strength to defend himself.  Mike turned Ryan towards his bed, and Aaron stood on the other side across from them.  Mike raised Ryan&#39;s hands, bending his back towards the puddle of cum.  &quot;Stooooppp, please&quot; Ryan pleaded.  Aaron put both of his hands on the back of Ryan&#39;s head and forced his face into his own jizz, moving it back and forth making sure it got all over.  Aaron took his hands off of Ryan and let him raise his head.  There were tears in his eyes, &quot;Ryan we&#39;re your brothers and its our job to make sure you&#39;re not a sick fuck&quot; Aaron hissed, &quot;So go clean the spunk off your face and if you want to see what a real man&#39;s dick is like just ask don&#39;t be a sneaky fag and steal glances or next time I&#39;ll smack you around with it.&quot; Mike let go of Ryan and he fell onto the bed.  The two boys laughed at their little brother before he grabbed his backpack and stormed out of the room.</p>
