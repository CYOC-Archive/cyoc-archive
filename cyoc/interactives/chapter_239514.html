<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Go now! Turn your brothers and sisters, and devour your parents! In two days&#39; time, the Alpha and I will hold a mating celebration in the town square! If there is even one clothed, normal human remaining in this town at that time... you will be punished!&quot;<br />
<br />
The words from his alpha rang in Matt&#39;s soul as he pulled up in his beat up Dodge Intrepid to the loading lane at the Middle School a few blocks away from the school. The urge to rip off gym clothes and run free again as he had just several hours prior gnawed at him, his fingers tapping the gray faded steering wheel. Yet he needed to keep up appearances, atleast until his father gets home.<br />
<br />
His father was an ass hole and a drunk, he had told himself that it was the death of his mom that made it that way, but he was seeing clearly now. His mother had shielded he and his sister from the worst of it, he could remember the screaming and the fighting, things he had blocked out of his mind as a young child. With his mom gone, his father had turned his abuse toward him, and he knew from the way his father looked at his budding young sister that some day he would abuse her as well. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know you don&#39;t have to pick me up, I could have walked home with Taylor.&quot; Ashley slid into the car breaking his thoughts. She was a young freckled face red head that Matt was always fiercely protective of, he had taught her how to beat up larger boys than her by second grade, and by sixth grade he knew she had gained a reputation.<br />
<br />
His nose flared as her scent filled the car, he had never thought of her as a woman or a girl before, but as he took in her slender build, her tiny nipples pushing against her shirt, the way her red haired was tied back into a pony tail and graced her neck. He could see that she was starting her journey into puberty. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah well, Dad is going to be late tonight, I thought we could watch a movie, maybe even a rated R movie!&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes lit up and Matt pulled away from the school, within thirty minutes he had &quot;The Howling&quot; DVD in the player, and was preparing popcorn while Ashley quickly finished her homework. &quot;Now if Dad asks what we did this afternoon what are you going to say?&quot; He asked, dipping his fingers into his pants and coaxing some pre from his aching penis. <br />
<br />
&quot;That I did my homework and we watched a Disney movie.&quot; She repeated from the other room in her sarcastic monotone voice while Matt dipped his glistening fingers into the glass of soda he had prepared for her before wiping them off quickly and loading the tray. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, it&#39;s movie time.&quot; He settled into Dad&#39;s chair in the living room with the tray of cola and popcorn. &quot;Lets see if you like a werewolf movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werewolves are so lame.&quot; She rolled her eyes as Matt scooted over so that she could fit into the chair next to him. &quot;Vampires are what&#39;s hot right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt smirked and watched her take the cup, taking a sip from it before grabbing a handful of popcorn, &quot;Things change you know, maybe after the movie you will feel differently.&quot; He retorted, grabbing the remote and pressing play. He could feel Ashley move in closer to the nook of his arm, her breathing becoming relaxed as she took another sip from her cola. <br />
<br />
&quot;How old is this movie.&quot; She muttered after a while, becoming slightly more engrossed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno, like 1970s or something.&quot; He shrugged as he took in a breath, he could smell something different in her scent, it was a bit of a earthy scent, a wild scent, the scent of a budding wolf beginning to grow in her soul. &quot;Are you enjoying it?&quot;<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t take his eyes off of her now, he watched as her ears became pointed, her button nose slowly becoming upturned, every time she reached in to grab popcorn her fingernails would lengthen to sharper and sharper claws, claws that would rip through their father&#39;s flesh. He could even see the beginning of fur starting to peek around her shirt collar. &quot;Or would you rather see a real werewolf?&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked away from the TV, her eyes turning gold as her nose darkened. He moved in for his moment, kissing his virgin sister on the lips, stealing her first kiss as he tossed the popcorn to the carpet. He couldn&#39;t take it anymore, but even more the beast that was now prowling his soul couldn&#39;t take it anymore. With sharpened claws he ripped his own shirt off, letting the auburn fur flow down his body as his face crunched into a muzzle. His legs popped and his gym pants were ripped to shreds as his tail flowed free. He may not have been an alpha like the football players but compared to his 11 year old sister, he was a God. <br />
<br />
&quot;Does your brother look lame now?&quot; He growled softly, pinning her to the chair. He could hear her heart hammering in her chest, and he could smell the earthy wolf scent growing stronger with each beat, her face had grown just as flushed as her fiery red hair. while her claws tore into the chair. <br />
<br />
Ashley took a moment to gulp as fur crept up her neck and began to appear on her cheeks. &quot;No..&quot; She whispered and opened her mouth, her tongue unfurling out as she thirsted for another kiss. Matt gave it to her, his muzzle meeting her lips, his tongue slowly entangling with her&#39;s as he used his claws to rip down the back of her t-shirt, tossing it away to expose her perky pink nipples, along with six more that were growing in on her stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wolves dont wear clothes.&quot; He grabbed her shorts, ripping them down the sides along with her panties, revealing her damp vagina, just in time to see it become engulfed in red fur, it&#39;s soft pink color changing into a deep black as it twisted to become more like a proper wolf&#39;s vagina. <br />
<br />
&quot;I waaaaaaant thissssss..&quot; She whined as her muzzle jutted forward to completion, her paws gripping at his sheath, rubbing and pushing at it until the pulsing red tip of his cock came out, a color that seemed to only match the red of her fur. &quot;Waaaaaant.&quot; She whined as her tail unfurled behind her. <br />
<br />
He grabbed her by the furry shoulders and turned her around, pushing her face into their father&#39;s chair, letting her claws rip into the old leather that their father loved so much. &quot;You&#39;re mine Ashley..&quot; He pushed his canine cock against her folds before shoving forward centimeter by centimeter into her. He could feel her squirm and growl as he gripped her hips, pushing deeper forward. &quot;Only your brother&#39;s mate.&quot; <br />
<br />
He rocked back and forth, going faster as she began to loosen, ever few seconds he went in a little deeper and a little deeper, her insides were pulsing and hot, clinching his wolf hood as if it were a vice. He leaned forward, grabbing her by the scruff of the neck, his jaws clamping hold tightly as his cock pushed as far in as possible, there was no way he would be able to knot her, not yet, but one day. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mine.&quot; He howled as he felt her whole body shutter, the wolf that was his sister orgasmed for the first time in her life. He filled her, sending thick hot semen deep into her, marking her in a unholy way that seemed to satisfy the darkness in his soul. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mine.&quot;</p>
