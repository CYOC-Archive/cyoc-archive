<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob left his new size 13 wrestling shoes on the floor of his room. The teen glanced at his bedside clock and saw that it was already getting pretty late. As he got ready for bed, he barely even gave the shoes a passing thought. He put on a pair of pajama pants and climbed into bed without a shirt. Little did Jacob know, as he slept, the well-worn, large wrestling shoes next to his bed began to glow. The power within them was starting to work it&#39;s magic on the sleeping teenage boy...<br />
<br />
The boy slowly gained consciousness and wiped the sleep from his eyes and he woke up. How long was he out for? The morning light peered in at an angle that made it seem quite late in the morning. The first thing Jacob noticed was an immense pressure, tightness, and a wetness around his crotch. This startled the boy, causing him to open his eyes to see what was causing the strange sensations. He turned on the bedroom light, lifted the covers, and peered under. He gasped at what he saw. His pajama pants were obscenely tented by a massive boner. His rod was sticking straight up, pushing very hard against the confining fabric. His boner was sticking out at least 8 or 9 inches now?! What? It looked so much longer than before. When he went to bed, Jacob&#39;s erections topped out at jus under 4 inches! Had he grown overnight? He could feel how hard his boner was and how hard it was pushing against his pants; he had to get it out, it was painful being so cramped! His boner was sticking so far out and tenting the pajamas so much, that the waistband was pulled away from his body. He could see a ton of brown hairs nestled above his penis! What? He had pubes too? What was going on!  On top of that, his crotch was wet and damp with something. Did he pee himself? Oh gross! He must have wet the bed last night!<br />
<br />
Looking down at his crotch and his new pubes, he saw something else that startled him. The dark brown pubes didn&#39;t stop with his crotch. A dark line of hair crept up from his groin all the way to his belly button. What? He had grown a happy trail overnight? He reached down and experimentally tugged on the hairs. Ouch! Yup, they were definitely his. They were thick, too! Jacob got out of bed, now fully awake, and ran towards the mirror in his room. His erection still pounding erect and sticking out in front of him almost comically; however, Jacob didn&#39;t know how to make it go down, so he ignored it for now!<br />
<br />
Getting to the mirror, he froze at his reflection. He looked.... different! He looked like a teenager now! He had somehow grown several inches overnight! He was about 5.10 or 5.11 now! He saw his pajama pants riding up his legs, showing off several inches of his leg (which he saw, were now covered in brown hairs!). Looking down, past his very stiff boner, he saw his feet had also grown several sizes too. They weren&#39;t big enough to fit in the wrestling shoes, yet, but they were getting there. He lifted his new feet experimentally and noticed that some brown hair had grown on the tops of his feet and his toes, as well. Where was all this hair coming from?! He had heard about puberty but this was ridiculous! And it didn&#39;t happen overnight like this!<br />
<br />
His eyes trailed back to his torso and the dark line of hair going down from his belly button into his crotch. Standing in front of the mirror he saw that he had the very beginnings of abs on his stomach! Likewise, he had small, but hard, pecs! He looked like his body had packed on some lean muscle overnight, as well.  Standing a few feet away from the mirror, he saw what looked like dirt on his face. &quot;What?.....&quot;, he muttered to himself when he noticed what it was. It wasn&#39;t dirt! He was growing hair on his face! Brown facial hairs were starting to sprout from his cheeks and above his upper lip. They were still thin and wispy, but still in need of a shave! This was crazy; he would need to learn how to shave now? Like a grown up?!<br />
<br />
While feeling the dark hairs on his upper lip, he saw a flash of something dark under one of his arms. Confused, he lifted up his arm and gasped at what he saw. He had a big bush of dark hair under his arm! &quot;Whoa, armpit hair?!&quot;. His underarm was full of dark hair, and it was clearly visible in the mirror! He put his arm down and he could clearly see the dark curls sticking out, even with his arms stuck at his side. He lifted the other arm; Yup, he had hairy armpits now! Very hairy armpits! He had seen some of the high school seniors in the locker room with hairy armpits, but none of his friends had any that he knew of. Now he had some pretty hairy pits! Jacob gulped as he scratched one of his pits experimentally, not used to all this hair. <br />
<br />
He noticed a strong musky smell. He sniffed one of his armpits and was hit with quite a stench. It smelled like a dirty, sweaty locker room. Gross! His pits stunk, too! He had never had to deal with BO before, and was quite embarassed by this new development. Putting his arms down, he gazed at his changed reflection in the mirror. What in the world was going on? This was so strange and utterly shocking. He had aged several years over night it seemed! He had all this hair now, and big feet, and he was muscular, too! Looking down, he could see his throbbing erection hadn&#39;t gone down at all. And his penis was so much bigger too! There was still a huge wet spot on the front of his pajamas that Jacob was thinking less and less was a pee stain!<br />
<br />
Jacob still stared at his reflection in the mirror in shock. What was he going to do? Was he still going to change more?! Giving his armpit a sniff again, the new hairs tickling his nose, he realized that taking a shower might not be a bad idea.....</p>
