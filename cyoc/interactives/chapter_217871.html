<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Hank wandered south by east, knowing the general were about of the Pale Valley farm; but by his being a roving pony animal, he wanted to remain as unnoticed from the local population. Natural instincts and personal urges caused him times of distraction away from his intended goal as he stopped often to graze. He noticed a difference from when cursed; to being a donkey, and forced to live his daily lifestyle, as would a truer beast of burden. His being changed, made a pony by way of the Tome and he as the specific owner and second time use of it, the Tome preferring to create a champion worthy animal.<br />
<br />
Quite unlike when he, Hank endured the bland bodily existing being a donkey, his present self gifted him a sense of stylish aura of personal pleasures. Even if his maleness was slightly smaller, as not the equally long to what a donkey owns, Hank felt a sense of manner to his walking, trotting gait and how he held his head up high.<br />
<br />
Hank knew the devil-familiar would come after, looking for Hank and wanting to do some manner of devil justified retribution. Whatever, as if an instinctive note, Hank felt a notion that the Tome powers what held him being then a pony animal would triumph, win over anything the devil-familiar might wish done. Hank considered his being a different if rare breed pony would set him apart from the commonly bred pony; as he because of his Norwegian family heritage did guide the Tome with his transition to make him a Fjord breed pony. The occasional high held tail and a desire to prance, as would a show pony offered Hank a new sense of personal pride.<br />
<br />
Granted, as Hank realized he was again of the form being an animal; he being property for any human to own. The thought and comparison of being a free willed human with legal rights he had given up, thrown away; preferring the bodily form and lifestyle of an animal owned. Owned, as a born animal might realize the bettered sense of comfort, maybe; but a human, rational thinking individual being an animal would appreciate the housing in a barn rather than being cattle, herded to exist in the open range and all manner of weather. <br />
<br />
The third new day of his pony self experience, Hank discovered a lusty scent, and he following it came to find a pet pony mare. She being to Hank’s vision capability a but dark hue, but she seeing and scenting him knew he was all male. The cute mare stood held by a short, three rail, PCV plastic fence; was an easy leap for Hank to jump. When Hank jumped the fence, his mare became more as skittish, nervous, though she held her tail high while whisking it to flashing about her scent.<br />
<br />
Hank knew the equine style etiquette of stallion to mare courting, and to test or quell the apprehension about their mating, a practiced male coaxed the mare to stand and accept his sensual fornicating. As Hank caressed his chin along the mare, her spine, he ducked her flagging tail to bringing his muzzle, as nostrils to bear close to a winking vulva. Carefully, and with showing his intention, Hank sniffed in her scent and mildly snorted, giving her sensitive vulva lips a blow-job to stimulate her fortitude.<br />
<br />
Hank did, as would any stallion, he too flagged his tail from feeling excited. His sheath allowed the cock to drop, and swell, unfurling long before stiffening, as stouter of libido than what Hank recalled of when as a donkey breeding. When the mare took a half step forward, she spread wide her hind leg stance to better her bearing the weight of her stallion.<br />
<br />
A mild snuffle from the mare as she lowered her head, a sign Hank knew of her willing submission to him then beginning the breeding.<br />
<br />
The leap up with the forelegs was an abrupt jolt to any mare, as the weight of a stallion settled his manner of stance bearing down onto the mare. Once mounted, Hank raised his cock with that wondrous style of equine libido, as he blindly prodding, poked his cock’s blunt end; he seeking to feel a wet as inflamed pair of lips winking, wishing to grab his cock and ushering it deep into her lustier self.<br />
<br />
Hank slid with remarkable ease, his smooth, silken cock skin entered the mare vagina and proceeded, unfettered, sliding past his medial ring, to him as sheath deep; a sensation from when a donkey mating he never enjoyed. Seven highly sensual thrusts, and Hank sadly felt his balls stir earlier than when he would like, as his tail rose with every gushed spewing of four mighty ropes of glorious semen.<br />
<br />
Their mating completed, and saddened Hank as he struggled to remain aboard, while the temporarily satisfied mare did walk forward, summarily dragging Hank from off her semen seeping backside.<br />
<br />
Equine habits prevailed, and the mare with her stallion peacefully began to graze.<br />
<br />
The first glimmer of daylight brought the two passionate ponies to accomplish a second mating; but of a much longer time when held together, offering a happier feeling thrill for a hearty, appreciating stallion. Hank was standing as still lovingly set cock deep and offering the young mare his slow manner of thrusting, when both ponies jerked alert when they heard a harshly exclaimed yell; as from a teenage, human owner seeing a rouge stallion hardily breeding her pet pony mare.<br />
<br />
One concerned father of the teenage girl owned more knowledge about equine breeding habits, as voiced his opinion about the mating as but once was unlikely to impregnate a mare. As twice or several times would then cause a pregnancy; same as with human horny boys with teenage girls. The fatherly remark caused Hank to chuckle, what came as heard by all he whinnied aloud his personal agreed sentiment.  <br />
<br />
Unexpected by Hank, the young girl went to doing her chores as offered fresh hay and unto each pony a two-cup ration of mixed grains for their breakfast. A reluctant owner said nothing, and to Hank’s surprise, he felt as adopted, owned, and given his reign to continue mating with the mare.</p>
