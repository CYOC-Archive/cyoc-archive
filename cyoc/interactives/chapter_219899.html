<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the foreign serum flowed through Lucas’ body, it began to change him. He watched as his previously human hands began to form black paw pads on the tips of his fingers and on his palms, a striking contrast against the pure white fur that swiftly sprouted across his hands. His nails became longer and began to curve, turning into sharp, retractable claws that glistened in the lights surrounding him on the spaceship. Lucas finished the tube as his eyes widened, watching the fur extend further up his body, covering his arms in a thick fluffy coat of white fur. Feeling himself becoming warm under his clothing, he took off his coat, revealing more of his new vulpine form to the galaxies around him. His eyes shifted downward, as Lucas kicked off his boots, only to see that his feet and legs met a similar fate, as his legs were enveloped in soft, insulating layers of snow-white warmth, while his feet morphed, growing tufts of white fur as his toes reshaped into dexterous, digitigrade paws ready to navigate icy landscapes. He felt his body become smaller, becoming more compact to keep in warmth in a frozen world.<br />
<br />
Lucas’ new fur would cover his body, traveling towards his neck and head. Lucas ran his new paws along his neck, feeling the softness of the snow-white fur that now coated it. Lucas then started to feel his head change. His ears, once shaped like round seashells, reshaped and migrated upwards, settling atop his head as triangular, exquisitely furry appendages. His eyes took on a sapphire blue color as Lucas began to feel his face stretch out, his nose gradually forming itself into a wet, ebony snout, one more fit for an anthro vulpine. His jawline pushed outwards, as it formed a furry muzzle equipped with sharp, carnivorous teeth and delicate whiskers that bristled with sensitivity, much like Lumina had in front of him. Finally, a magnificent, bushy tail emerged from the base of his spine, poking out above his snow pants. it swayed gently, signifying the completion of his transformation. Lucas took a look at his new, furry form, left in awe by the astonishing fusion of human and vulpine traits that now constituted his being. <br />
<br />
Lucas looked down at his new body. &quot;Wow, thanks Lumina, I&#39;m a badass alien fox now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t refer to ourselves as &quot;foxes&quot;, Lumina corrected him. &quot;We are the Nalli, the advanced inhabitants of Tuoni.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, so what brought you to Terra? specifically that part of the Planet?&quot; Lucas asks with a grin and striking blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Lumina chuckled softly, appreciating Lucas&#39;s enthusiasm. &quot;I can appreciate the enthusiasm in joining our kind. As for what brought me to Terra, I was there for a broader exploration mission. Nalli have long been intrigued by where we had originally come from. My expedition focused on studying Terra&#39;s unique ecosystem and its potential for symbiotic relationships with Tuoni.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas listened intently, captivated by Lumina&#39;s words. His curiosity was as bright as his new fur as he found himself eager to learn more about both their worlds and the connections they shared. &quot;Tell me more about Tuoni, Lumina. What makes it so special? And how did your ancestors come to be uplifted by a higher being?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lumina&#39;s azure eyes gleamed with a mix of pride and reverence as she delved into the history of Tuoni. &quot;Tuoni is a world of wonder, Lucas. We have built a rich and thriving civilization in its frozen landscape. Long ago, our ancestors, the Arctic foxes, inhabited the vast landscapes of Terra, facing the challenges of survival in a frozen world. But Terra, as beautiful as it was, also held its perils, and the Arctic foxes faced threats that put their existence at risk. Our way of life became unsustainable over time. It was then that a higher being called Kohota, discovered the Arctic foxes. They bestowed us, along with many other Terran creatures with advanced cognition and a bipedal form. The Uplifter then dispersed them across the cosmos, the Nalli were given a home on Tuoni.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas nodded, absorbing every detail. &quot;I could see why Lumina, It’s a pretty chill place after all.&quot; He quipped.<br />
<br />
“What were you doing in that part of your world?” Lumina returned a question to Lucas,<br />
<br />
Lucas took a deep breath, his voice carrying a hint of reminiscence as he shared the story that led him to the Arctic. “I was on an expedition of my own, heading into the uncharted wilderness. I wanted to study the unique ecosystem of the Arctic and document the wonders hidden within its icy realms, but, I became lost after a heavy windstorm, and it left me stranded in this tundra with no sign of life. Then, I found your ship, and look at me now,” he gestured to himself.<br />
<br />
“I see,” Lumina replied, she then pointed towards her home planet, Tuoni, or what Lucas called until now, Pluto.”<br />
<br />
Lumina turned her attention to preparing Lucas for their arrival at the spaceport. She understood the importance of acclimating him to the customs and etiquette of their home planet, being a stowaway and all, she knew she would need to make sure he wouldn&#39;t end up detained upon arriving there. Lumina began to explain some ground rules to Lucas.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lucas, when we arrive at the spaceport, it&#39;s essential to observe a few protocols to ensure a smooth transition,&quot; Lumina explained firmly. &quot;upon our arrival on Tuoni, it is crucial that you assume a new identity to avoid being suspected as a stowaway. The Nalli are firm on the security of our planet, and blending in seamlessly will be essential.&quot; <br />
<br />
She continued, outlining the key aspects Lucas would need to consider. &quot;First, we will need to give you a new name, one that aligns with Nalli naming traditions. Let&#39;s choose a name that embodies bravery, a common thing Nalli pride themselves on.&quot; Lucas listened intently, as he would need to take this seriously.<br />
<br />
 &quot;How does “Riku” sound?” Lumina suggested, “It sounds like a name that blends in seamlessly into Nalli society.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucas’ cobalt blue eyes shimmered,  &quot;Look, I just don’t want to end up detained on some alien planet, I’ll take any name you give me.” he answers, with an anxious tone in his voice <br />
<br />
Lumina nodded approvingly, acknowledging his apprehension. &quot;Good. Now, we must craft a convincing backstory to explain who you are on Tuoni. Let’s say that you are a novice intergalactic explorer, using your experience in the expedition to Terra&#39;s Arctic region as a solid foundation. We can also include that you hail from a distant part of Tuoni, which is why not many Nalli know you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lumina&#39;s guidance provided Riku with a sense of purpose, as he embraced his new identity as a young explorer with a passion for understanding the wonders of the cosmos. Together, they worked on refining the details, ensuring that he would get through customs without a hitch.<br />
<br />
As the spacecraft neared Tuoni&#39;s spaceport, Riku sat beside Lumina, nervous to embark on a new life on a new planet. <br />
<br />
<i> “Everything is going to be just fine.”</i> he anxiously whispered to himself as the spacecraft descended on the spaceport of Tuoni’s capital city…</p>
