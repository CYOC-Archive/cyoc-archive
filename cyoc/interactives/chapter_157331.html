<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;What the hell, I&#39;m only going to get one shot at this anyways that it Might as well go all the way with it.&quot; Les thought as she clicked on the feline option, ignoring the large red warning that was flashing right before her while she scrolled the choices forshe had something in mind and was eagerly searching for it. She looked everywhere for the most powerful creature ever imagined as it had unyielding strength wrapped in a tight lean body, but couldn&#39;t find on option for it that she was about to give up when she saw an option which seemed similar- smilodon.<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t exactly sure what a smilodon was, but she vaguely remembered that it was a big, furry, and very strong cat. Thinking about the smilodon more as she couldn&#39;t quite recall what it was, till she remembered what the name really was from her hystory class that it was what she so desired - a sabertooth! She wondered why though as a sabertooth, an ice aged cat would be called a smilodon that she did thought of them in a time era when dinosaucers onced lived on planet earth.<br />
<br />
Clicking on her choice, she was immediately assaulted by another large warning as the computer screen was flashing red. Being shown by this, she quickly clicked out of the warning and continued to examine her own opinions that she didn&#39;t bother on reading the message it read. Leslie was soon given a list of settings, which were already set to the default options.<br />
<br />
Subject: Jeff<br />
Feature: Body (Human)--> Body (Smilodon)<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Dimensions:<br />
Length: Error! Cannot compute (see Error Code 4206 in Manual for help)<br />
Weight: Error! Cannot compute (see Error Code 4206 in Manual for help)<br />
Body fat: Error! Cannot compute (see Error Code 4206 in Manual for help)<br />
Morphing duration: 1 hour<br />
Pleasurable: N<br />
Alter Reality: N<br />
Aware: Y<br />
<br />
<br />
Leslie frowned as she realized that this was going to be a lot more complicated than she had hoped. Looks like it was going to require some work then she first thought, instead of just clicking a few buttons here and there to be done with it. Apparently, she had a bit more work to do on the computer screen.<br />
<br />
First of all, she saw that the subject was wrong as she wanted to change herself, not Jeff. She clicked on his name to see a full 3D model of his nude body that this surprised her, while slowly turning on the screen. She chuckled a little at the size of his penis showing on screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, I think you might have gone a little more then too far this time here.&quot; She thought with a smile as she briefly toyed with the idea of messing around with Jeff. Thinking about making his penis disappear entirely to the point of even turning him into a girl did cross her mind, but she knew her time was short that she still had a lot of work to do.<br />
<br />
Seeing a small icon in the lower left hand corner of the screen that she clicked the link for it was labeled as &#39;Scan new subject&#39;. After a brief pause, her name now replaced Jeff&#39;s that even his image was now replaced with her own nude anthro-horse body over the picture screen.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s more like it. Now then, Damn! I do look good like this anthro horse, but I think that I can look more good as an anthro saber tooth tiger. I wonderhow it knows my name though?&quot; She thought with a smile while examining the picture more closely.<br />
<br />
Looking at the next option that she considered on leaving the selected option as male. True it might be fun to try out being the dominant gender for a change, but she absolutely loved the female form as she wanted to be able to enjoy it. So, what better way to enjoy it than to remain one herself that she switched the option to female.<br />
<br />
The errors were confusing as this included lengh, weight, and body fat that she tried clicking on them, but nothing happened. Looking for some kind of manual that she couldn&#39;t seem to find one anywhere near the computer.  She decided to skip them for now and start working on the next option.<br />
<br />
Trying to alter the morph duration to less than 1 hour as the was a little eager to enjoy her new body, she didn&#39;t want to wait that long. However, she couldn&#39;t decrease it less than 1 hour as she was able to increase the time limit. Thinking that it was the minimum time the device needed to complete her complex transformation, so she left it be.<br />
<br />
The pleasurable option was a difficult choice as she was intrigued by the thought of being aroused like Cindy was with her transformation that when she tried to change it, the computer flashed yet another red warning. Saying this one-hour long orgasm may cause some long term mental damage that she didn&#39;t like the idea of being lost in an orgasm for 1 hour, helpless and in a daze. Thinking that the program was probably right that she decided to leave it as it is and continued on, even if it meant to leave the altar reality and awareness alone.<br />
<br />
Shortly after, she heard a door open downstairs that it was followed by some excited shouting. Leslie lookedat the clock to realized that she had been working much longer on this than she thought. As she was having some fun on it that she had lost track of time on when they&#39;ll be back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it! Jeff and Liz must be through with work already. They&#39;ll probably noticed that I destroyed their door. God, I don&#39;t have much time here.&quot; She thought in a panic.<br />
<br />
As if On Cue to the response in her thoughts, she heard heavy hooves thundering into the house and rushing up the stairway that without a second thought is when she quickly clicked the start button. Hoping the program would begin, despite the errors that another red warning flashed. Trying to click past it that demanded a percentage to be input, before it could proceed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Percentage? What percentage?&quot; She thought as she clicked through the warning so quickly for she hadn&#39;t even bothered to read what it was talking about that the only percentage she could think of was her muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what it wants? Dose it want to know how lean I wanted to be? If so, than what percentage of my body should be muscle?&quot; She thought as she began to type it in quickly.<br />
<br />
Typing in a number percentage to only now hit enter, the door opened as Elizabeth stomped angrily into the room. Little did Leslie knew, the percentage was actually referred to on how far her transformation would go - what percentage of her body would be like a saber tooth tiger (A.K.A. a smilodon) for That was the reason for the errors. The program could not calculate any measurements until she had specified as to how far she was willing to go, But now that all the input had been entered is when the program whirred up to life while starting to complete the required request it was given.</p>
