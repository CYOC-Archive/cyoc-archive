<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The awake Janet drowsily stared at the male Victoria. &quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm.&quot; Victoria hesitated. She wondered for a second if she should say the truth or make up an excuse. Janet might not believe the truth, but on the other hand, did she have any other choice than to try to convince her? &quot;Janet, it&#39;s me Victoria.&quot; Victoria said in a baritone. Her own voice catching her off guard.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Janet grunted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Victoria, and somehow I turned into a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am like way too hungover for this.&quot; Janet groggily replied.<br />
<br />
Janet didn&#39;t seem to believe Victoria, but at least she hadn&#39;t freaked out or anything. She was remarkably calm considering what looked like a stranger was in her bedroom. Victoria tried her best to figure out what she could tell Janet that might convince her. Was there a shared secret she could tell? Or maybe if sh- Victoria&#39;s thoughts were interrupted by Janet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck happened here?&quot; Janet exclaimed, gesturing at the double-sized bed she was sitting in.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know either.&quot; Victoria answered.<br />
<br />
Janet narrowed her eyes as she looked at the male Victoria. &quot;Hmm.&quot; she mused skeptically. &quot;Whatever.&quot; Janet picked her phone up from her nightstand.<br />
<br />
Janet just sat in the bed and browsed her phone. Victoria stood there watching awkwardly. Her stress levels were high and she couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Victoria, I believe you.&quot; Janet suddenly proclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;For real?&quot; Victoria was so relieved. Though, she did wonder what suddenly changed Janet&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Check this out.&quot; Janet turned her phone around. Her phone showed a picture of Victoria and Janet together, not the female Victoria, but the male Victoria and Janet. They were sitting next to each other at what looked like a bar. The male Victoria&#39;s arm hang around Janet&#39;s shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just this picture.&quot; Janet explained.  &quot;All my pictures, and everywhere I looked on the net, you&#39;re like replaced with this guy version of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that possible?&quot; Victoria asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think like last night, I talked about what if you were a man and stuff. Like, what if you were born a man instead. I made a wish and it came true I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you wished me like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just a theory. I guess I could try wishing again.&quot; Janet suggested &quot;Ahem.&quot;  I wish Victoria was a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Victoria hoped she&#39;d transform back, but her hopes were dashed. nothing happened. Even as they waited some seconds, still nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well.&quot; Janet shrugged. &quot;We&#39;ll figure something out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Victoria was disappointed, but at least she had Janet to support and help her. She was much calmer now. She wasn&#39;t alone in this.<br />
<br />
Victoria&#39;s attention shifted away from herself and unto Janet who stood up from the bed. No longer was the bed blanket covering her torso. Janet&#39;s breasts were on full display. Victoria had seen them before. Janet always slept topless. Usually she didn&#39;t care, but this time, her eyes were drawn to Janet&#39;s chest. They looked so... nice, tits, small and pert. Wait. Stop. Victoria turned her head away. She wasn&#39;t supposed to look at her friend like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a shift soon.&quot; Janet casually said. &quot;So I&#39;ll have to leave soon. I&#39;ll just freshen up first.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Victoria replied. &quot;I had a lecture, but there&#39;s no way I can go out like this. I don&#39;t really like skipping it, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Vicky Chill. Like, you study so much. Don&#39;t worry about missing a single fucking lecture. Just relax and take it easy.&quot;  Janet advised.  &quot;Like once I am back from work and I am less hungover, we&#39;ll look into this. We can fix this.&quot;<br />
<br />
She smiled warmly at Victoria. Janet&#39;s smile had a soothing effect,<br />
<br />
After a quick freshen up, Janet waved Victoria goodbye, leaving Victoria alone in the apartment for now. Victoria wondered what she should do. She usually studied around this time, but she didn&#39;t feel like it now. She then remembered Janet finding an altered picture on her phone. She had to check this out herself. She grabbed her phone. As she grabbed it, she noted how the phone felt much smaller. Of course the phone was the same size. Her hands were just larger.<br />
<br />
Victoria browsed on her phone. She looked over the files on her phone and also various social media. There was no trace of Victoria. Instead, it was replaced with the life of her male self, who was called Victor. So her name was Victor now. She kept on browsing, seeing what was different and what was similar. Apart from the obviously different things, like being a different gender, a lot was similar. Victor was studying the same subjects as Victoria and they seemed to share the same group of friends. It pleased Victoria. Even if she were to be stuck as a man, she wouldn&#39;t have to say goodbye to all aspects of her original life. <br />
<br />
One picture in particular caught Victoria&#39;s attention. It was a photo of Emily, a friend of Victoria. She was posing on the beach, dressed in a string bikini. This wasn&#39;t the first time she had seen the picture, but it had never caught her attention like this. Victoria felt a pressing sensation in her groin. She realized she was getting aroused by her friend. It felt weird to look at her friend like this, but she didn&#39;t want to stop. She&#39;d been horny plenty of times before, but this was such a strong drive. Victoria looked at her bikini-clad friend. A pale freckled face, a cute button nose, light blond hair and big boobs. The last part, her boobs were the interesting part. Victoria never got why boys liked boobs so much, and here she was drooling over a pair of tits. Even now she didn&#39;t understand why she liked Emily&#39;s boobs so much. She just did. Victoria felt her erection grow harder. She touched it, her penis. It was hard and oh so sensitive. She moved her hand across the shaft, gently handling it. She felt the pressure grow. The sensations grew stronger and stronger. She gripped her dick. Images of Emily flashed in her head. This is it. The pressure was released. It all came out, covering her thighs and boxers in cum.<br />
<br />
Victoria&#39;s head was instantly cleared of all the sexual thoughts. Now she felt a little icky. She&#39;d objectified her friend. Emily was a sweet girl, but instead of caring about that, Victoria had just been thinking about her boobs. On the other hand, it did feel good. Amazing in fact. That must have been the strongest orgasm she&#39;d ever experienced.</p>
