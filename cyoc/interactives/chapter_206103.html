<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan touched his belly, heart skipping a beat. It felt empty, longing to be filled, gurgling, hungry. <br />
<br />
Nodding, he walked off, ass swaying towards the door, trying to keep it together, but failing. As Dan passed through the door his spinning vision made him stumble, holding onto the stand by the front door. He closed his eyes and breathed in, the first conscious breath of his new body, feeling the air rush past his lips, up his dainty nose, sobering him.<br />
<br />
Two great breasts dominated the vision beneath him, pearly white and smooth and just the hint of veins, a slight sway as his heavy breath made his chest expand. He could feel them. He could actually feel them, always and every moment, the slight strain every intake of air created against the tight outfit, the excessive mass pulling on his shoulders and skin, their momentum, their softness, their sensitivity. It was a lot to take in, but it at least served as a momentary distraction from the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
Dan, now Dani, was all curves, all ass and tits, weight and heft, power and elegance. Just moving his hands felt different, felt freer, felt stronger and swifter. Having lived with it all his life, he never really noticed his pudge and generally lack of muscularity, so normal he had never even needed to inure to it. This, however, brought all of it into stark relief. Under the skin, masked by the plushness, was a lot of power, so strong the table beneath his hands felt brittle.<br />
<br />
While the dizziness could be traced back to many things, not least the change in height, a large part of him was very excited. He caught a feint reflection, in the white plastic on the front door, smiling at what he saw.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
In the bathroom Dani found a floor-length mirror where normally the shampoo stand should be, all that transferred to racks inside the shower. He was looking at himself for the first time, looking at themselves so fully it brought back the dizziness, but this time they remained confidently on two feet. Smiling again, they struck a pose.<br />
<br />
They were looking at the same eyes, same hair, and - in some abstract unquantifiable way - that cheeky grin felt like his, but that was where the similarities stopped. They could just about see the muscle tone, hiding beneath the modest level of fat. That fat was concentrated on their hips, and - of course - their overspilling breast, bulging towards the boob window. He openly wondered what cup size they were, until the mirror itself brought their stats to the fore.<br />
<br />

<br />
Jesus, he thought, looking back down at them, holy fucking jesus.<br />
<br />
>O++E, empty<br />
<br />
They prodded the symbol on the left, curious about it. It looked like the female symbol on it&#39;s side, with an extra bar on the line, ending in an E-like fork. A prompt told them that it was a symbol for people that had wombs that were hyperproductive, and could get pregnant to just about any inseminating material. <br />
<br />
>Flavourless colostrum, sedatives, 750g/d<br />
<br />
Tapping again revealed that this was her milk stats. His milk stats. Either way, those tits were not just for show, and that was nearly a kilogram of milk they were about to produce. What she about to produce? They? Fuck! D looked at it for a moment more, before pulling away and sitting on the edge of the tub, dizzy once again, focusing on breathing once again. <br />
<br />
What have you gotten yourself into, a thought spoke.<br />
<br />
There was text at the top of the mirror that didn’t quite resolve itself, often edging towards a solution, before breaking back into distortion. It was supposed to display pronouns, but it was detecting such internal conflict it couldn’t even pull up an N/A. <br />
<br />
‘He’ was out. ‘He’ was long since out. ‘He’ might have even gone before the transformation, if the victim had a modicum of self-reflection, but that victim was not quite ready for ‘she’. The eyes, crowned by that messy pixie cut, told them they were a they, though that still felt off, especially with that other alien weight, and other non-human features. Behind those lips was a leviathan, writhing with every thought. The excitement was incomparable, far and beyond anything they had experienced, tinged with only a slight fear, and a decent heap of body horror. Their womb groaned in response, as they stood up and walked to their room.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
The room was an oasis of normal in a sea of strangeness. It was a little bare, as always, the walls needing a whip, the floor needing a sweep, and a small pile of fresh laundry needing folding and organising, but it was all still theirs. They flumped onto the bed, next to the laundry, holding a shirt to the light above them. They had wanted to maybe throw something over those melons, but there was little that they owned that now fitted her. While They were like this, very few clothes in general would fit.<br />
<br />
Dani wondered if there was a way to adjust it all via the Chronivac or if he was going to have to go out like this just to buy something less excessive. The little shoes and thigh highs were cute though, they could stay.<br />
<br />
Dominating their mind’s eye was the image of them not just ion their apartment, but striding down the street, curves jiggling, centre of everyone’s attention. Everyone with the most distant interest in girls would have eyes for them, would be salivating over them, would be hungry for them. Hell, that mental image was hot, and it came with logical conclusions that spilled out in every direction. <br />
<br />
They thought about teasing guys, they thought about teasing girls, maybe getting drunk and a club and doing both. Maybe they could kiss a girl, and like it, but they could do it without ironic detachment. Why tease, they thought, when there was much more satisfying feelings they could create.<br />
<br />
Their pussy fluttered, uterus hungrily calling out for seed, collapsing that little fantasy.<br />
<br />
Ah, they thought, that’s why.<br />
<br />
Regret pooled in their head, worries about clothes and pads and carrying around baby weight, even with the new power behind their fat. It gnawed away at the excitement, toxifying the moment, though having the hottest woman on the Earth on Dani’s bed softed his worries. Dani lay there for a moment, letting the reality of the situation settle in their mind, letting themselves come to terms with reality as much as they could. As they lay there - however - impulse drove their had to their chest, cupping their massive breast and giving it a jiggle. They didn’t even want to do it - though they weren&#39;t going to complain about it - their mind just made it happen without their input, like it was a natural state.<br />
<br />
Well, Dani thought, when in Rome…<br />
<br />
They played for a moment, pushing them apart, jiggling them, sinking their fingers into them, then pushing them up near their face. It hurt a little, something they weren’t expecting, but it was outweighed by the low hum of sexual gratification it induced, especially when their mind ventured south. Their pussy twitched, hot and needy, a shot of moisture slivering out. <br />
<br />
As they looked down they realised it was too far below them to be seen, but that there were other things to be concerned about. Dani’s nipples had leaked, creating two small patches on their chest. It was odd, almost inexplicable, but with it came a wave of pride, a hand touching the wetness on her chest. She moved her little fingers over it, as her other hand slid off, heading south.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Siya wants you to come back downstairs.” A smooth if unfamiliar voice breathed. “She also asked you not to flick the bean, and wanted to say that she could see. Like, the device tells us what’s on your mind, and we know what you are thinking about.”<br />
<br />
“Tha’sss…” Dani curled their tongue back into their mouth, focusing. “That cweepy.” They said at last, lulling their tongue out to look at it. It was so long it could touch Dani’s forehead, so prehensile it didn’t need assistance.<br />
<br />
“It is what it is, now come on.”<br />
<br />
Liam was standing by the door, hand on their new hip. They were much smaller now, smaller even than Siya, chubbier and bustier than Dani too, dark voluminous curls stretching back behind them. They wore a similar outfit, only theirs was strapless, Liams toits on a shelf. They shared a look, smiling at one another, both realising what was about to happen. The regret and fear washed from Dani’s brain, replaced with a much stronger emotion; horniness.<br />
<br />
Walking without a dick felt inherently sexy, the empty space only drawing Dani’s mind to their aching pussy, obfuscated only by a universal jiggle. Liam held them close, putting a hand on their hip, the two bodies jiggling their way into the living room again.<br />
<br />
Siya was bright red, conspicuous cushion on her lap. <br />
<br />
“Wah I up der wong?” Dani asked, they shrugged, Dani concentrated. “Wass I up there long?” Siya shook her head, as Liam sat them beside her, kneeling in front of them both. <br />
<br />
“So, things are a little different.” Liam smiled, full lips forming out each breathy word. “Siya only wanted to change one thing, one very important thing, but we learnt that if we did we couldn’t change it again for almost a day, and that made our Siya a little conflicted. She wanted to go all out, become something extreme, but she also felt that it would be a lot to ask of us, and we needed a little build up.”<br />
<br />
Dani looked between the two, Liam’s grin a touch malevolent. Their heart was beating in their ear again, their pussy heating as images invaded their mind.<br />
<br />
“At first we thought we might just give her just a regular cock, let our pussies sort out the rest, but Siya really wanted to go a little kinky.” Liam smiled up at our Siya, hand on the pillow, Siya’s incessant blushing breaking into a smile, trying to avert her gaze as the pillow began to shift. Dani slid off the sofa, at her brood sister’s side, aching with anticipation<br />
<br />
“Wow, you really are that thirsty? Well, for real though, I had a lot of influence on this. I asked myself in what way can I make her cock kinkier so that it isn&#39;t too much of a burden on us, so I came up with something.” Liam patted the pillow, the pillow responding like it was floating, the rising mass from the blushing girl pushing the pillow out of the way. Dani looked at it, then at her companion, her moistening tongue liclking at her plump lips. “I think it&#39;s pretty cool, and I wanted to explain it, before I finished off my change, when our tongues become unhelpful.”<br />
<br />
Dani’s eyes glew, as Liam hit a key on the keyboard. She paused, jaw agape, her tongue snaking out dripping and steaming. In terms of length it was less impressive than Dani’s, but no less intimidating. She curled it, hand pressing onto the pillow again, rubbing the new cock through it, Dani’s hand moving to join it. <br />
<br />
Siya let out a gasp, finally looking at the two of them, as her arm of meat pushed the pillow over, the prize landing on it&#39;s pedestal.</p>
