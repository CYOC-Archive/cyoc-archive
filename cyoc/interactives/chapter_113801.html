<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tired of his little game, you interrupt his sick daydreaming. &quot;Look Kyle, can we just get this over with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;re no fun. But okay.&quot; Kyle points at the stiol and my legs walk over completely under his control. I sit down and the stool instantly starts to glow in a golden light. While still holding me, it starts to bend and reshape until its has become a golden dentist&#39;s chair. It has much more cushion than average and what&#39;s more disturbing is that the bottom of the chair has split in two, spreading me open for all to see. I squirm trying to break free, but Kyle and I both know there&#39;s nothing I can do. And he&#39;s enjoying it immensely.<br />
<br />
As soon as the stool started to reshape, he started circling around me with an evil grin on his face. He loves the power he has over me. It becomes really obvious how much loves it when on the last turn he makes, a serious bulge is showing through his jeans. I roll my eyes and he looks down. Instead looking embarrassed, he chuckles. &quot;Eh, so what. Being in control is a major turn on. But you know all about that, don&#39;t you Queenie.&quot; He leans forward and traces his fingers down my face, my neck, and lets them dance around my breasts before giving them a little slap. He practically giggles as he watches them bounce around and straining my shirt. &quot;Stop that, you creep. And stop calling me Queenie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re in a place to negotiate here, Queenie. And jeez lighten up will ya? You&#39;re about to spend the rest of your life barefoot and pregnant. That basically was your plan to begin with right? Hook up with Captain Jock for the long run, get married, pop out some puppies, and just stay home playing mommy. I&#39;m just saving you time. And dignity.&quot;<br />
<br />
He starts to undo his belt buckle and unzip his pants. I close my eyes. The sooner this is over the better. But Kyle has other plans. &quot;Nuh-uh, Queenie. I want you to watch me fuck you. Open them up.&quot; And once again my body reacts under his word. Kyle has his pants already down and his dick is standing at full attention under his underwear. He slides them down, never breaking his stare on me. Unable to look anywhere else, I look at his dick. It&#39;s nothing impressive but at least an average five inches. He slowly walks up to the chair enjoying every single antagonizing step. Kyle walks inbetween my spread legs, dick inches from me. He puts his hands on me again, this time finding hold on my hips. His dick bobs around my vagina teasing me. I don&#39;t want it to but I can feel the curse reawaken, making me feel more and more turned on. Holding on to whatever hatred I can muster, I glare at Kyle obviously disgusted. Instead he just clicks his tongue at me, like the way a school teacher scolds a little kid. &quot;Come on now, Queenie. Is that any way to treat your baby daddy?&quot; And plunges deep inside me.<br />
<br />
I hate it. But almost as much as I hate him, I hate myself for liking it so much. <br />
<br />
Kyle keeps his dick fully holstered in me for a few moments before the chair starts to change again. This time it picks up Kyle with it and leans back. His face is buried in my chest but I know he&#39;s smiling that evil smile. &quot;Just like a recliner, huh Queenie?&quot; He moves his hands up my sides until he&#39;s resting on his forearms.  Pulling out of me a little bit, Kyle moves up my body and kisses me hard on the lips before going back down into me. I hate it but once again it feels so mindnumbingly good. I accidentally give him a little tongue while he kisses me and pulls away. &quot;See Queenie. I told you you&#39;d like this. Just give in. There&#39;s no way out of this so enjoy yourself. I am.&quot; He goes back down to kiss me again while grinding our interlocked hips together. I don&#39;t want to, but with every second of him making out with me and pumping himself deeper and deeper into me, its get harder to hold on. My stomach is tingling and my heart is beating a mile a minute. His hands are creeping closer to my sides till he is squishing my breasts in his hands. It sends waves of pleasure through my whole body but still I hold on. Just when I think I might actually maintain a scrap of dignity through all this, he cheats. Kyle moans  into my mouth.<br />
<br />
Something about hearing and feeling him grunt inside me feels so animal, so wild, that instinct takes over and I start kissing him back hard. At first he seems surprised with my sudden participation but then Kyle runs with it, grabbing the back of my neck to pull my mouth further into his. He pulls on my hair a little but it just adds wood to the flame. My giant breasts are crushed underneath his body but the rubbing on my sensitive new melons makes it worth. The chair glows a little more and it adds a neck piece to hold my head up to his so his hands can go back to work. Kyle goes back down to my hips and reaches behind them with one hand cupping my ass and pulling me even closer to him. Instinctually I wrap my arms around his neck breaking our kiss but giving him some more leverage to work. I&#39;m so into getting screwed that I don&#39;t even realize that I moved. Kyle moves his other hand to my bare leg under my skirt. His hot and sweaty hands rub the biggest, juiciest part of my thigh and gives it a slap. It stings a little but at this point he has me so lovedrunk it makes me want him more. I lift my legs from the chair locking them in place behind Kyle&#39;s back, again not realizing that I moved from the chair. We stay like this for a few more thrusts, grunting like wild animals into each other&#39;s ears before I orgasm. It hits me like a bucket of refreshing cold water, washing away every bad thought  with nothing but the pure joy of release. I slowly come down from my high with Kyle still thrusting to get his. I completely snap out of it when I feel him come inside of me. He gasps for breath in my ear as his juices, his semen flows deep down into me. All feelings of pleasure are wiped away once I&#39;ve fully realized what I had done. His breathing becomes more and more steady over time and he even lifts himself up onto his forearms to look at me. For a moment, the shame hits me but then I see twinge of annoyance on Kyle&#39;s face. I look where&#39;s he&#39;s looking and feel instant relief. &quot;My boobs! They didn&#39;t grow! I&#39;m not pregnant!&quot; My arms and legs snap back into place on the chair, but I don&#39;t care. &quot;Sorry Kyle. Looks like your little game didn&#39;t work put after a-.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the middle of my taunting, I start to feel my chest warm up. &quot;No, no, no No!&quot; And just as soon as I though I had won, I had lost everything. Sensing what&#39;s about to happen, Kyle lifts himself up onto his hands just in time to watch my breasts suddenly burst out of my extremely low v neck at least two cups sizes bigger than before. Kyle&#39;s turns from one of defeat to his evil grin of power. He moves in closer to give me a kiss, but at the last minute turns and licks my cheek and squeezes my massive bare breasts in his hands. Kyle&#39;s won and he knows it. Keeping silent, he pulls of out me and gets off the chair turning it back into its basic split leg dentist chair form leaving me feeling confused, angry, and most of all, dirty. Kyle walks over to his pants on the ground and slides them on, not even bothering to grab his belt or his underwear. He claps, summoning the two bimbos from before that I honestly forgot were there, to his side and lets them walk him to the double doors of the gym. Before he leaves however, he turns to me still with that disgusting smile on his face. &quot;Congratulations Queenie. You&#39;re pregnant. See you when the kid&#39;s born in a few days.&quot; He turns back to his girls who have opened the doors to the hoards of guys waiting in the hallway. He yells &quot;Next!&quot; before leaving me in the gym alone with my shame before the next &quot;suitor&quot; walks in through the door.</p>
