<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It wasn&#39;t that George hated Danny, per say. In fact, he rather liked the guy and his easy smiles. Danny was the chill dude on campus, with good grades and a good body. Most people liked him. And when he got assigned to work together with Danny on one of their physics&#39; project together, he&#39;d been ecstastic! <br />
<br />
They had worked well, gotten an excellent grade and now George was part of Danny&#39;s study sessions. <br />
<br />
He had just hoped he could get invited to one of Danny&#39;s parties. <br />
<br />
George frowned a little as he stared at the screenshot on his screen. It didn&#39;t seem like a photoshot, and Danny&#39;s skills with computers weren&#39;t that great, he probably wouldn&#39;t do this much work just for a ten minutes prankcall. That... that was Danny&#39;s actual dick. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d had so many wet dreams about that dick. And there it was, casually shown to him as part of a study session. The things he would do to Danny... He&#39;d have him begging to become his boyfriend, no, better, his sex toy! He&#39;d said someone at the frat party had used a camera to transform him into his own dick. George had to get his hands on that. And Danny. With the camera, he could reverse-engineer it and become rich, and with Danny as his faithful sex-toy, he&#39;d live the perfect life! <br />
<br />
Contrary to Danny, George WAS a computer expert, almost at genius level. Hacking had been one of his hobby growing up. So, with a determined look at the screenshot of Danny&#39;s dicked body, George pulled out the signal from Danny&#39;s computer and started triangulating. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Hugo ran a few calculations on his tablet, entering the measurements and various stats of the dicks he had acquired at the party. <br />
<br />
He had ended up deciding on a numbering system for a few of the cocks. Steve had been labeled as #0 and was currently being teleported to Donshel. Hugo had emphasized the importance of convincing his superiors of keeping the experiment going, and Steve had only been too eager to help. Hugo had quietly listed a few of Donshel&#39;s weak points when it came to human dicks, and crossed his fingers. Steve might get his wish of staying dicked forever if he succeeded.<br />
<br />
Danny had earned the Model #1 monicker, less for his status as the first man dicked, but for his cooperation and nonchalance. Hugo wanted to encourage that behavior amongst the rest of the dicks. There weren&#39;t any reason to panic. Hugo planned to let most of them be transformed back into humans... if they still wanted to after his experiments concluded. <br />
<br />
Model #7 -- Perry -- had been carefully isolated from all the other cocks when Hugo allowed them to talk. So far, #7 didn&#39;t suspect the lie. Of course, Hugo knew that even a minute with some disobedient model like #4 would undo all his hard work. He had been tempted to ask Danny to perpetuate the lie -- as a prank, he would tell Danny -- but the risks seemed too great. <br />
<br />
Hugo contented himself with using #7 as the standard in his tests as often as possible. Just this afternoon, Perry had been jerked off, massaged, put into a containment tank for a rejuvenating bath, and rubbed against a silenced Dave. Hugo&#39;s computer had a very large sample of Perry&#39;s DNA by now, good enough to clone a few extra dicks (though that would have to remain a simple thought for now). <br />
<br />
The best surprise of the experiment so far had been Jacob. Hugo&#39;s biggest model *loved* being his own cock. It seemed every other minute, he was getting hard again and moaning. If Hugo touched him at all, Jacob would beg to be jerked off, often on some of the other dicks. It didn&#39;t make him very popular with some of his frat bro-dicks that always ended up covered in cum, but Jacob shut them up every time by virtue of his size. He had taken to requesting being registered as the Alpha Cock. Hugo had agreed with some minimal protest. Good test subjects were hard to come by. As an experiment, Hugo had left him lying on top of Bryan, and from his sheer dominant streak alone, Jacob had gotten Bryan to cum. <br />
<br />
Since then, Bryan had taken to listening to almost everything Jacob said. It was almost cute how Bryan had become so submissive to the massive cock that was Jacob. Thus, it seemed only logical to label as #10 and #10,5. Ten inchers and his subordinate. <br />
<br />
It was a shame that William (model #9), his second biggest at 9,5 inches, wasn&#39;t nearly as cooperative. William repeatedly insisted that he be let go everytime Hugo ajusted the volume of his communication chip. His boyfriend had to be getting worried by now, he kept saying. Little did he know Donshel&#39;s subliminal messages had started to block memories of the missing frat guys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should try to repeat Model #7&#39;s experiment with Model #9,&quot; he mumbled to himself. Perfecting the technique would surely come in handy later. <br />
<br />
Well, he should probably wait a bit more. At least perfecting Perry&#39;s treatment. With a gentle smile, Hugo picked up Perry and Dave and walked toward the testing area. The big white room had a long table right in the middle covered in mechanical contraptions imitating human culture -- sexual culture, in this case. As a second thought, he merely shoved Dave inside a cock cage. If after that, Dave still didn&#39;t try to *talk* instead of shouting and yelling obscenities, then Hugo would leave him there for another day. Even his patience had limits. <br />
<br />
For Perry though... <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, Model #7, are you ready for an endurance test?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Perry said, sounding like he was trying to gulp. <br />
<br />
Hugo hooked him up on a strap and jerked his shaft a few times, enough to get Perry hard and slightly slick with lube. With that, he aligned the machine with a transparent fleshlight. Its insides were coated with a fine nutrient-rich aphrodisiac, the same as the one in the containment tanks. With it, a dicked man would cum continuously until its rejuvenating properties were all used up. <br />
<br />
Perry&#39;s dickhead spurted out a few drops of precum as he understood what the test would be like. Hugo grinned to himself and aimed Perry&#39;s dickhead with the entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, talk me through your sensations as the experiment proceeds,&quot; Hugo reminded as he pulled out his tablet. <br />
<br />
And he pressed on the &quot;start&quot; button. <br />
<br />
The mechanical frame hissed and started moving back and forth, thrusting much like a human male would, when copulating. A dicked man could be fitted exactly where their penis would usually be on their body. It was the perfect perspective flip. Mint had been particularly proud of his work on the pseudo-man toy. <br />
<br />
Perry&#39;s dick body was thrusted in slowly through the fleshlight&#39;s folds, then pulled back with a wet &#39;schlop&#39;. Then, again, faster, pulling Perry&#39;s foreskin completely. Perry&#39;s seven and a half inches were pushed in completely, bulging, visible through the fleshlight&#39;s transparent walls. In and out, several more times in complete silence, if not for the faint moans and the wet slap of flesh against synthesized flesh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sensations, Model # 7,&quot; Hugo chided.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... &quot; Perry moaned weakly. &quot;It&#39;s...&quot; <br />
<br />
The machine pulled back, and Perry&#39;s entire body shivered from the cruel lack of friction. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, no! Please, shove me back in! I, fuck, I was just looking for my words. It&#39;s great! It feels warm, and wet, and-&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo activated the machine again, chuckling. He had only meant to tease his confused model. And make him want more dicked sex. He watched proudly as the dick stammered words of pure lust. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... f-fuck, it&#39;s amazing-&quot; his balls slapped against the fleshlight&#39;s cushioned rim. &quot;Oh fuuuck! Fuck, fuck.&quot; -- Hugo discreetly increased the machine&#39;s rythm -- &quot;I, my whole body, cock, FUCK,&quot; -- Perry&#39;s voice shook --  &quot;my cock&#39;s like, fuck, faster, it&#39;s so hot, so good, I&#39;m going to... I&#39;m gonna...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you understand now, Model #7?&quot; Hugo hummed, amused, and, more than a little aroused himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; Perry shouted, quivering inside the fleshlight, &quot;I&#39;m a dick! I&#39;m just a dick! I&#39;m Model #7 and I love being a dick!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo smirked to himself, and wrote down a few things. This time, Perry hadn&#39;t even needed to be coaxed into what he should be thinking. Positive reinforcements would help him decide that being reduced to a penis was the best thing that happened to him. At this rate, perhaps Perry could be told the truth sooner than later. The projection had been at least two more weeks of subtile manipulations. But as he watched Perry shoot milky white strings in the fleshlight, Hugo decided to adjust his estimations a little bit. He could up the intensity of his tests and the reinforcements.<br />
<br />
Wouldn&#39;t it be an interesting scene if Perry learned the truth and decided to thank Troy for getting him transformed? He would certainly have the chance, Troy (Model #5) was requesting to get played with almost as much as Jacob.<br />
<br />
Hugo slowly approached the pseudo-man and dialed down the speed to lazy levels, letting Perry twitch and cum further. The fleshlight&#39;s walls were almost completely white at this point. Perfect. Hugo unhooked the contraption and pulled Perry out. The poor dick was still twitching, his shaft covered in seed and yet his balls were still clenched and pumping out more cum. Hugo held him out proudly and put him back down on the display table, where he huffed out a few breathless pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have to say,&quot; Hugo commented mildly, &quot;I&#39;m quite proud of your performance, Model #7. Our scientists truly surpassed themselves with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The dick beamed with pride, chuckling. &quot;Eh, t-thanks, I do my best... to cum... buckets...&quot;<br />
<br />
Just as Hugo was about to reply, his tablet chimed in with a little &#39;beep&#39; and a flashng red window popped up. <br />
<br />
Intruder alert? Hugo thought as he reread the message. How could there even be anyone capable of bypassing his lab&#39;s security measures?<br />
<br />
Curious, he pulled out a video feed of the front porch, and noticed the slight opening of the front door. Someone had tricked his computer??</p>
