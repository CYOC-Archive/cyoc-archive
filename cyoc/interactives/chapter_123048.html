<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Not far from the house was the gym; it was after school by now, and Ty and Dustin decided to race there to meet their friends. Due to being taller now, Ty&#39;s legs were now longer, allowing him to run faster than Dustin. When they got to the gym, they ran into a handful of their friends: Peter, Allan, Steven, Jake, Mason, and Damion. Needless to say, they were surprised to see how tall Dustin and Ty were now.<br />
<br />
After explaining the power Ty got on his birthday two days ago on Saturday, and the game the two had been playing all day--thus explaining their &quot;elevated status&quot;--the two waited to see how their friends would react to this. Actually, their friends were not freaked out; they wanted to become taller as well. Using his powers, Ty set up a special basketball game for them: each person who makes a basket gains six inches in height. Naturally, the gang accepted. Dustin&#39;s team consisted of Steven, Mason, and Jake; Ty&#39;s team consisted of Peter, Allen, and Damion.<br />
<br />
The game started, and it&#39;s a little obvious as to what happened. As they were the tallest players to begin with, the teams mostly tried to throw the ball to Ty and Dustin; Dustin took a few shots so that he could grow up to Ty&#39;s height, but Ty thought he was tall enough already and wanted the others to catch up. When one of the shorter guys did shoot the baskets for himself, he enjoyed getting an extra six inches. After a while and several baskets, the teams gathered at their benches and compared their new heights. Peter was at fourteen feet, Allen at twelve, Damion at fifteen, and Ty at seventeen. Steven was at thirteen feet, Mason at eleven, Jake at fifteen and a half, and Dustin at sixteen feet. Dustin was looking forward to being as tall as Ty; all he had to do was make two more baskets and he would be seventeen feet tall as well.<br />
<br />
The game resumed, and the teams began to become equal in height. The main goal was for all members of each team to become an equal height by the end of the game. They were mostly alternating turns with shooting baskets. Though quite a few shots missed, they were beginning to even out. After a while, the teams took another break, and compared their heights again. Peter was sixteen feet high, Allen was fifteen, and Damion and Ty were seventeen. Steven was seventeen, Mason was sixteen, Jake was sixteen and a half, and Dustin was finally seventeen. Dustin was glad to have finally become as tall as Ty, and he would not have minded if he grew a little taller since he was a year older than Ty, but he would be satisfied if his teammates caught up to him first.<br />
<br />
The game resumed, and there could be no more breaks--all of a team&#39;s members had to make it to equal height within five minutes. Naturally, the competition began heating up. Allen made a basket, and grew to fifteen-feet-six. Then Peter managed to make one and reached sixteen-feet-six. Peter and Allen were closing in on Damion and Ty&#39;s seventeen feet. That&#39;s when Jake made a basket, and his height grew six inches, right up to Steven&#39;s and Dustin&#39;s--Mason had to make only two more baskets before their entire team was at equal height. On Ty&#39;s team, Allen and Peter had to hurry before Mason grew anymore. With their long legs dashing across the court, the two made sure to get their baskets while keeping the ball away from Mason at all costs. With two more baskets, Allen made it to sixteen, while Peter reached seventeen--Peter&#39;s height had finally matched Damion and Ty. All that reached was a showdown between Allen and Mason--each had to make two more baskets, and the first to make it won the game for their team.<br />
<br />
Allen made the first basket, and stretched to sixteen-feet-six. Mason then managed to make his, and he grew as well. Whoever made the next basket would reach seventeen feet and win for their team. Naturally, the two tall teens fought over the ball, and then in the last few seconds, the unbelievable happened. Allen prepared to dunk the ball, and Mason came up behind him, prepared to throw the ball down himself. When the two dumped into each other, all four hands grasping the ball, it fell into the basket--still held in their hands. After both guys grew to seventeen feet, Ty explained what had happened: since both guys were holding the ball when it went in the basket, it meant that they had both made the basket, and therefore they had both grown--and matched their teams&#39; heights together.<br />
<br />
The teams were a bit upset that neither had won or lost, but they were happy and impressed with their new &quot;elevated status&quot;. Their torsos, legs, and arms had all grown with each basket they had made, but none of the guys were any wider than when they had begun to grow--only their heights had changed.</p>
