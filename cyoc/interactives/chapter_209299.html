<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you woke up, you saw immediately that you were now in a bed, alone and naked.  You found yourself in a strange room, as the walls and ceiling were stark white and the floor was so glossy that you could perfectly see your reflection in it. There was nothing else in the room but the bed you were in, not even windows.  All the lighting came from electric lights and in this situation you had no way of even knowing if it was day or night.<br />
<br />
You got up and went to the door to try to see if you could see what was on the other side, but it was just an ordinary door and it was unlocked. You opened it and looked outside, but you came across a hallway similar to the room you woke up in, and through it there were more doors.  At the end of the hall there were stairs going up and down, which meant you were in some building and not on the first floor. <br />
<br />
You were very worried about Helen, your girlfriend, and you decided to try looking for her. Your first attempt was the door directly in front of the room you woke up in, this one was also unlocked, you opened it and entered. It was another room exactly the same as the one you woke up in and you felt lucky to see Helen, who was still unconscious, lying on the bed.  She was also naked and with her back to you. You woke up your girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you.  It feels like I fell asleep before the movie started, I&#39;m sorry about that. Thank you for bringing me to my house.&quot; Helen said, but then she realized she wasn&#39;t in her room and turned around, jumping to her feet. &quot;This is not my room.  Where we are?  And why are you naked?&quot; she asked, but your attention was already between her legs.<br />
<br />
You were shocked to see a huge cock, at least twice the size of yours, hanging between your girlfriend&#39;s legs accompanied by an equally large ballsack.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is this?  Why do I have a dick now?&quot; Helen asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, but we have to find out.  Let&#39;s look for a way out and look for an answer.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, we have to get dressed first.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t.  There&#39;s no clothing here, in fact, there&#39;s nothing in this building as far as I could see.  We have no other option but to go out naked.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
Helen was embarrassed, but she accompanied you.  You went to the end of the hall and down a flight of stairs.  The sight of the big cock dangling between her legs, mainly because she ended up getting hard halfway through, made you couldn&#39;t stop looking at her, and you also came to doubt that she really was Helen, even if everything was exactly the, except for the member between her legs.  Your girlfriend became more embarrassed, especially since you saw her getting a hard-on.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can stop, I&#39;m not going out like this.  Being naked is one thing, but with an erection... This is totally wrong, I&#39;m a girl, I&#39;m not supposed to be having this kind of problem.&quot; Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;Just stop thinking about it and focus on something else and the erection will go away.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;It might work for you, but I&#39;ve never had a dick before and the feeling is very strange to me.  I just can&#39;t forget about him. I&#39;ll wait here until it passes.&quot; Helen said and opened a door next to her, entering another room in which she intended to stay until her erection passed, but there was already a naked girl sitting on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t think there would be anyone else here.&quot; You said looking away from the girl, but Helen kept looking at her shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do not believe that.  Look.&quot; your girlfriend said and turned her face away, forcing you to look at the girl, and thus making you understand what shocked her so much.  The girl sitting on the bed was the exact Helen you knew, one who didn&#39;t have a dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Helen in bed questioned the other next to you, and you repeated the question afterward.  Seeing the normal version of your girlfriend made you sure that the one you were with was an imposter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Helen, you have to believe me.&quot; the shemale said looking at you and the Helen on the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not going to fool anyone you imposter, you&#39;re a trans trying to impersonate me, but you&#39;re not fooling anyone with your show cock.&quot; the normal Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;But I... I&#39;m not lying, I... I&#39;m totally confused right now.  Am I not who I say I am?  But I remember everything I lived through as Helen until I fell asleep in the theater, but when I woke up I had a dick.  Now someone looking the same as me and claiming to be me, but... What the hell is going on here?&quot; the shemale said<br />
<br />
Suddenly a voice can be heard.  The voice was clearly computer generated and played from hidden speakers. &quot;Hello, we can see that everyone is finally awake.  This is just a warning to make you aware of your situation. People pay a lot for certain porn content online, and many like things out of the ordinary. Due to the amount of orders we cloned a couple that we selected,  creating a perfect copy of the man and the woman and for we made more copies of them, and all the other copies have mutations and other things that are considered bizarre, from slightly weird to extremely bizarre. A detail of this experiment is that all clones have all the memories of your originals until the moment we collected the material. You will live here being filmed and being able to be watched 24 hours a day on a deepweb page.  Do not think that someone will rescue you, as your originals were never captured and continue to live their normal lives without knowing of your existence. You may have noticed that you don&#39;t have clothes to wear, this is because we want you to be naked all the time and for you to have sex frequently, if you don&#39;t we will give you a little push.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they say that and that I&#39;m not the real Helen?  Am I just a copy?  This cannot be true.&quot; normal Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;At least you&#39;re fine since you&#39;re the perfect copy, but look at me.  From what has been said and my memories so we are both the same person but look at the dick I have.  Not to mention that apparently there are more copies of Helen here than us and probably with worse mutations than mine.&quot; shemale Helen said<br />
<br />
&quot;And it&#39;s not just Helens here, there&#39;s more of me too.  Look.&quot; You said and pointed to the bedroom door you had left open.  There was another you, but this one had no head and his face was in his crotch, where there was no male or female genital.</p>
