<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been one week now since Damon had become a dragon, as well becoming Thoren&#39;s mate. Damon never thought that he would lose his virginity to a hulking reptilian beast, all of his life he saw dragons as beasts. However, now that he was Blackfire he saw things differently, and he now had at least some experience as a dragon now. One night Damon even contemplated on confessing his identity as a prince to Thoren, but ultimately he didn’t have the heart to tell her.<br />
<br />
Damon now within a new lair with Thoren as his new mate. Since they met the two decided to get to know each other more, it was Thoren&#39;s idea. Damon of couse had to tell a half truth to keep his identity a secret, but he was truly considering committing to being Blackfire now. Damon had learned that Thoren hadn’t had many reactions or relationships with other dragons, and she had grown up alone. Thoren wasn’t too social, and she seemed especially shy now that she was female, and destined to lay the eggs brought upon by Damon&#39;s seed.<br />
<br />
At this time Thoren slept with Damon curled around her, and cuddling her closely. Damon was awake, but he felt committed to Thoren and protective of her now that she was his mate. The other dragons seemed to all have mates now as well, but unlike Damon they mates with their lovers constantly, and almost relentlessly. Damon had only mated with Thoren once, and every time he&#39;s with her in public and the others all brag about how great they felt while fucking their mates, Thoren had a look in her eyes that looked thankful that Damon didn’t do that to her.<br />
<br />
<br />
Today, Damon thought that he should do something to commemorate the one week anniversary he has had with Thoren, but he didn’t know what he should do for it. It was then Thoren began stirring, and Damon glanced over to see her head rise and yawn. In response Damon licked her face lovingly, and she looked to him and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Blackfire,&quot; Thoren yawned once more,&quot;have you been stirring long?&quot; Damon felt his heart warm up with feelings that he could only link to feelings of passion when Thoren spoke to him, and he gladly replied,&quot;Not very long, how are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren stood up for a moment to stretch her body, and then she laid back down and replied,&quot;Just fine, why do you ask dear?&quot; Damon was silent for a moment as he knew this would definitely be a touchy subject, and he was a bit hesitant to bring this up in conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I was wondering how you&#39;ve been since we got together. You know after the uh.....alternative intercourse option?&quot; Damon asked and Thoren paused once she heard this and looked down towards her slit. &quot;Well, I never really thought about that before. I guess I feel....weird being like this. The first few days made me feel uncomfortable, especially around Skyining and Fel’Hiren. How they always just.....talk and go into detail about how hard and how much they fucked their mates. Sometimes it just seemed like it was a competition between them, and it was....unsettling. I’m just glad you aren’t like them Blackfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon smiled at this and he nodded then said,&quot;I didn’t want to hurt you when we mated either, and we haven’t done that since the night we first met. I was wondering how you felt considering how...uh...they’re always claiming such things. Personally I’m glad they didn’t include me in their pissing contest, or cumming contest in their case.&quot; Damon then paused for a moment to wonder if that’s just how dragons were, and if Thoren would notice his difference.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn’t hurt me....well too much anyways, but it was a good pain to feel when we did it together.&quot; Thoren said with a whimsical tone to her voice, and Damon looked at her inquisitively and asked,&quot;Really? Uh, is it okay if I ask how it did feel for you? I mean you can probably imagine how it felt for me then, but...you used to be male.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren heard this and she looked up at Damon and gave him a look of uncertainty for a moment. &quot;Well....I guess it wouldn’t hurt, and it would help, I guess.&quot; Thoren exclaimed and she paused then cleared her throat and went on say,&quot;Well, how do I put this...? I guess it felt like an unbearable and excruciating amount of heat was between my thighs, and the only thing to put it out was the cooling embrace of your seed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon paused and blushed once he heard this and said,&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Thoren giggled a bit and added,&quot;I know, it’s odd considering what we are, but it felt that way okay?&quot; Damon nodded to Thoren understandingly and she then went on to say,&quot;Anyways when your cock entered me it felt like a battering ram breaking down the doors to a fortress, except all of that force gave me unbelievable pleasure. It was an enormous rush for me, and when we climaxed together it was like the flames within my womb were extinguished! Mmmmm....I think I&#39;m getting a bit horny just thinking about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon paused and blushed then watched as his large draconic member became erect at her description, and it prodded against Thoren’s rear. She looked back and saw it of course then she smiled at Damon again and asked,&quot;Am I turning you on big guy?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon blushed a bit harder and he nodded to her and said,&quot;Your words are like poetry to my soul, Thoren. W....would you mind if we...?&quot; Damon paused to see Thoren roll onto her back and spread her legs to present her moist pussy to him once more, and she nodded to him and she grinned and growled to him seductively,&quot;As long as you don’t go telling the other boys what we do, I&#39;m perfectly fine with taking you on again, Blackfire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon smiled at this and then he stood up, and over Thoren once more with his erect draconic member. He placed it at the entrance to Thoren’s needy cunt and thrusted forward to hear her moan in pleasure once more. The feeling was incredible to Damon as it was before, like his vile acts to this female creature was what he was made to do since birth. As Damon thrusted again to hear Thoren moan, he knew this feeling was instinct down to his very core in his heart, and the instincts in his draconic blood called out to continue.<br />
<br />
With one final thrust the two dragons roared out, and Damon’s seed spilled into Thoren’s unprotected womb once more. Damon was about to pull out of Thoren, but suddenly he felt her clit clamp tightly down on his cock, and Thoren growled,&quot;Let’s stay like this a little longer, shall we?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon&#39;s has dropped at this, and he was unresponsive until Thoren swung body to the side and knocked Damon to the ground. The two beasts were still bound by cock and cunt, and Thoren gave Damon a sinister smile and said,&quot;I didn’t get a chance to do this last time Blackfire. I felt that I could, but I didn’t, and I regretted it back then. So, how does it feel to be stuck in me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon blushed a bit and replied,&quot;I&#39;m just shocked that you’re acting so....dominant all of a sudden compared to back then.&quot; Thoren smiled then she leaned in and gave Damon a huge French-style kiss on his mouth, and at first he hesitated but then leaned into it and kissed back.<br />
<br />
Their tongues interlocked with one another as the two got a new taste for one another. When they stopped they looked each other in the eyes with a newfound fire in their souls. &quot;Thoren, let’s do something special tonight, something romantic.&quot; Damon growled, and Thoren smiled and nuzzled his chest and replied,&quot;That sounds lovely! Where are we going?&quot; Damon then smiled and replied,&quot;Anywhere you want, I&#39;ll make it happen for us my beautiful beast!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoren smiled once she heard this, and she blushed at Damon’s sudden expression of pride. &quot;Hmmm....you know I have been around here awhile, and I think I know exactly where we can both have a wonderful time with each other.&quot; Damon’s smile grew wider with Thoren&#39;s confidence as she spoke then she opened her mouth and said,&quot;I&#39;d like to go to.....&quot;</p>
