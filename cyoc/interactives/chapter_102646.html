Skipping ahead…<br />
<br />
The rest of Friday went along without a hitch. Samantha and Frances had patched things up between them, and rejoined their friends inside for quite the breakfast. Even if it was close to eleven by the time they actually got around to eating. <br />
<br />
Eric and Spencer only hung around for fifteen or so minutes before going back to the Lawson’s house. And before they left Evan gave his daughter a stern reminder to make sure that when Mike returned, to keep an eye on him. <br />
<br />
“Dad, what’s Grandpa going to do? Build a nuclear reactor in our basement?” Spencer seriously doubted the old man would cause much trouble. He just liked to have fun, and annoying Evan was fun. <br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t put it past him.” Evan said. Spencer was about to say more when Eric quickly pulled her away. <br />
<br />
“No point in arguing. Your dad is just worried.” <br />
<br />
“Ya, that’s like the only thing he ever does. Worry, worry, worry. Guy deserves a trophy.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
“Well, we can’t all be as perfect as you.”<br />
<br />
“You know Slugger, I appreciate the compliment, but maybe you want to ease up on the gravy.” <br />
<br />
“Guess that was a little cheesier than I thought it would be.”<br />
<br />
“Cheesy, gravy, we just ate. Is it true what they saw about teenage boys, the only things on their minds are food and sex?” Spencer smirked. Eric shrugged in response. He make a point to reach up and pet the back of Spencer’s neck, and then slowly move up to her ears. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The Twists went next door to check on Ben and Alex, and to have their “private time”. The Andersons and Lawsons understood, Frances discreetly explained why Samantha was having such a hard time with thing. <br />
<br />
William felt especially guilty about Samantha’s insecurities, as it appeared their weekly “parties” had started this all. <br />
<br />
“Don’t blame yourself William. This problem has been brewing, in a manner of speaking, for a long time. I didn’t know about it, you didn’t, no one did really.” Frances said. <br />
<br />
“I remember her moms hitting a rough patch around that time when we were in school. They’d never show up to functions together. Samantha never said anything, and after a year or so they appeared to have worked things out.” Maggie recalled that summer being very odd. <br />
<br />
Samantha was unusually withdrawn, and shy, especially around their male classmates. Even more so around the male werecats. Maggie assumed it was because it was that awkward age where guys suddenly didn’t have cooties. But then, Samantha had always known she was gay, and she wasn’t shy about telling people. <br />
<br />
“I probably should have realized something else was going on other than teenage crap. But then, I never was good at feelings and stuff. Maybe Elle knew.” Maggie thought. <br />
<br />
The Twists left shortly after, leaving the remaining two couples to their own devices. While Evan was busy pulling his hair out over his father, Martha pulled William aside to ask if he’d spoken to Nate at all. <br />
<br />
“He sent a text.” William held up his phone for Martha to read, because it was just too funny for him to say aloud.<br />
<br />
GREETINGS PARENTAL UNITS. I’M ALIVE. LIVE LONG AND PROSPER. <br />
<br />
“I didn’t think he liked Star Trek.” Martha smiled as she pulled back from the phone. <br />
<br />
“Considering how much Eric watches it, guess Nate just picked it up at some point. And besides, I’d be willing to bet my left kidney that most of the country understands THAT reference.” William said. <br />
<br />
The two moved into the kitchen to clean up after their breakfast. Maggie joined them, saying Evan was trying to call his dad. <br />
<br />
“Lord knows Mike will probably just send it straight to voice mail.” Maggie sighed as she heard her husband growl in frustration. <br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Onto the evening with Nate and Kenya… <br />
<br />
Nate himself was busy playing “cooking master” to Kenya. After their own breakfast, he’d started teaching Kenya a few of the tricks he knew about cooking. There weren’t a lot, but letting Kenya know that simply putting an egg on a pan would make it burn certainly was a top tip her. <br />
<br />
It was close to six now, and Kenya had an early morning tomorrow (or so she said to Nate). It was the best excuse she could think of to keep him away for the next twelve hours. Though she was thoroughly enjoying her cooking lesson, it had to come to an end if she wanted to have enough time to change and get ready for her “date” with Jack Ashford. <br />
<br />
“Didn’t you take Home Ec. in school?” Nate asked while the two washed dishes. <br />
<br />
“Well yes. But I didn’t pay much attention. School was always so boring to me. I understood the material sure, but had little interest in it.”<br />
<br />
“What are you interested in? Aside from the sex.” <br />
<br />
“Mmm…” Kenya actually had to stop what she was going to think about that. Her life had been so consumed by her inner panther’s lust, she never had time for a hobby. She rarely ever watched TV, or went out to do “fun” things. After her first transformation, she fought to keep her desires at bay.<br />
<br />
“Did I spend twenty years of my life in bed?” Kenya wondered with shock, because she really had. <br />
<br />
“You know, I’m not sure. I guess I’ve been too career oriented for too long.” Kenya finally says. <br />
<br />
“Well that’s going to change. I promise, after I teach you how to cook edible eggs, I’m going to find out what you like doing. Again, aside from the sex.” Nate said. <br />
<br />
“And I look forward to that challenge. But, as much as it pains me to end our day together, I should get some sleep. We only got an hour or two last night, and I have to open the bank tomorrow. Most everyone else will still be away, or won’t be back until the afternoon.” Kenya said, glancing at her wall clock again. <br />
<br />
“6:15” it read. She was due at the pickup spot in forty five minutes. And she was still in her “around the house clothing”, which consisted of a pair of cotton shorts and a large “MOON LAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE” t-shirt. <br />
<br />
“Kiss goodnight?” Nate leaned in and gave her a puppy dog eyed look.<br />
<br />
“Of course. Are you sure you’ll be alright getting back home?”<br />
<br />
“Ya, Ben and Alex said they could swing ‘round and pick me up. I’ll be fine. Or is this just an excuse to get me to stay?” Nate grinned. <br />
<br />
Kenya locked lips with her werewolf before the two said their goodbyes. Nate shouldered his backpack, and started to walk towards the curb. He looked back at Kenya’s house, watching as it shrunk the further he got from it. <br />
<br />
He couldn’t understand what had happened. About midway through the afternoon she’d suddenly remembered she had to work early and couldn’t spend the night with Nate? That didn’t make much sense to him. <br />
<br />
“Could this have something to do with those phone calls? No, she promised me she’d stop doing that stuff.” Nate thought. </p>

He trusted her, he knew Kenya. Didn’t he?</h3>
