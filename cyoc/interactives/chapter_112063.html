<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thomas suddenly noticed his arms felt heavier and his muscles on his upper arms and chest ached. He ran to a nearby mirror to see, unconsciously scratching his belly on the way. He got to the mirror and saw that his biceps did indeed seem bigger; you could actually see muscles, unlike his pathetic twigs earlier! He also saw that his shoulders seemed a bit broader as well, and his pecs were sticking a bit out. He glaned down and saw that he was getting a small gut, but he didn;t even think about it; all the other changes were too awesome!<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so COOL!&quot;, he said, and stopped; his voie was much deeper. &quot;Hello, hello!&quot;, he said, testing it. It was indeed a bit deeper! Cool!<br />
<br />
Thomas&#39; feet started to cramp, so he left the mirror and sat down on the edge of his bed, and removed his shoes. He saw why they were ramping; they were about 3 sized too big for his old shoes now! They were size 12 now, but gettig bigger and bigger. They finally stopped at 14s. &quot;Whoa! They are huge&quot;, he said, noticing his voice was even lower and more gruff. He slid his socks off and saw they were indeed huge. He was surprised to see brown hairs coating the tops of his feet and his toes, making them appear more masculine. Thomas also noticed a bad foot odor wafting from his bare feet. he crunched up his nose. &quot;Uggh, I have smelly feet? Oh well, it is a smell price to pay for this&quot;, he said in his newly masculine voice, as he cupped his now huge cock in his jockstrap. He smiled as he saw it must have grown again, as the jockstrap was bulging. He saw thick brown curls of pubic hair sticking out in every direction from undernieth the jockstrap. Thomas also saw that his legs were longer than before, and they were also covered in a thick coat of brown hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I&#39;m becoming a fur ball!&quot;, he said, his voice even lower. He rubbed his hairy legs with one hand as the other went up to his throat to feel his adams apple push out, finally settling his voice into a final deep tone.<br />
<br />
As he lazily scratched his stomach, he noticed he was getting quite a gut. he ran back to the mirror and was again shocked by the changes. His face had taken on a chisled appearance, complete with early to mid teenage scruff. His shoulders were now very wide and his chest was huge. He saw he also had a small beer belly. Thomas was concerned; Sean at school didn&#39;t have a gut!<br />
<br />
Thomas scratched one of his ass cheeks though the fabric as he leaned in closer to the mirror; he watched as thick brown stubble slowly pushed themselves out of the pores on his face. He felt it, noting it felt like sand paper. &quot;This is so cool!&quot;, he said to himself.<br />
<br />
He started scratching his chest again when he noticed something else; he felt hair all over his huge barrel shaped chest. He looked down and saw tons of thick brown hair curling out of the top of his tank top. Thomas lifted the tank top off his body and gasped. His chest and his stomach were absolutely covered in a thick rug of brown hair. It came up from his pubes in his jockstrap and went in an unbroken rug to his stubbly neck and face. He rubbed the hairs in disbelief. <br />
<br />
Just then, Thomas noticed a bad smell from somewhere. He thought it was the clothes at first, as they stunk, but the smell he was smelling was much worse and stronger. It smelled like really bad body odor. He scratched an armpit, thinking bout what it was, until he stopped. His fingers felt a huge bush of hair in his pits. He lifted his arms in front of the mirror and gasped; he now had huge thatches of hair in his pits! It was a ridiculus amount. Thomas couldn&#39;t believe it; just an hour ago he had been totally smooth, and now he was covered in hair! The smell got worse and worse, until Thoma pinpointed it. He stuck a nose in his newly sprouted pit bush and instanty recoiled; his armpits stunk to high heaven! Ugggh! It was seriously worse than Sean&#39;s!<br />
<br />
At this point, Thomas began to get worried; he had much more body hair than Sean, he had worse BO, and he had a pretty large, hair covered beer gut now. Thomas looked in the mirror and saw sparse, but thick hairs growing on his upper biceps and shoulders. &quot;Enough is enough&quot;, he said, and took off the jockstrap. His huge cock flopped free, shooting droplets of precum all over his legs and floor. With the jockstrap off, a new scent of unwashed balls, sweat, and musk wafted up to his nose. He cringed, knowing his new body now produced suh offensive scents. He looked at the huge veiny hose leaking fluids everywhere, his sweaty bush, and huge hairy balls, and started to regret his change; this was a bit too much. He glannced behind him and saw his huge fat ass was covered in nasty thick hairs. Uggh.<br />
<br />
However, removing the jockstrap did nothing, the changes kept occuring. He looked in the mirror and saw he looked to be about in his mid twenties, and totally covered in hair and muscles, with a huge beer gut. Suddenly his head started hurting and he grasped it in his hands. He began to feel fuzzy in his head, and Thomas suddenly realized he was losing his intelligence!<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot;, he yelled as years of study left his head. He was feeling duller and duller. Suddenly his surroundings started to spin. His bathroom was disappearing, being replaced with something else. Thomas realized where he now was; he was in a dirty, stinky trailer. Dirty clothes, old pizza boxes, dirty jockstraps, and used, wadded up tissues full of what Thomas could on;y guess appeared all around him.<br />
<br />
Even with his intelligence leaving, Thomas knew what he had done; He hadn&#39;t picked the quarterback&#39;s jock and tank top like he had thought, he had picked a slobby redneck&#39;s clothes by accident. The intelligence was rapidly leaving his head. &quot;Oh God!&quot;, he said in fear and disgust at this realization. He had to do something to reverse this, or he would be a stupid hairy trailer slob for the rest of his life!</p>
