<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;..the world was more like a Shonen Anime. Hints of Hentai maybe, but mostly just full of action and super-powers and such.&quot;<br />
<br />
I realized that this was quite possibly the vaguest wish yet, but since I'd set up the reset wish just a few seconds ago, I wasn't too worried about the world suddenly going crazy. Of course, that's basically what it did.<br />
<br />
The first thing I noticed was that my clothes changed into something more fitting for a main character. A big red jacket covered in zippers and a pair of black jeans. Other people's clothe changed as well, but what was more interesting to me was that most of the men became women. Stunned by that change I still noticed that the city I lived in was becoming more fantastic, rope bridges overhead, and lots of neon signs. There was also a preponderance of extreme hairstyles.<br />
<br />
The change ended as soon as it had begun and I wondered just what was going on. I looked around and saw that there were maybe four or five times as many women as men here, and that some of the women wore collars. I shrugged and figured I'd find out soon enough and was just about to wish my way home when I heard a shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;James!&quot; I turned, just in time to see one of my best friends, Amy, running toward me, trip, and headbutt me in the stomach, making me double over as she fell to the ground. As I wheezed for breath and she stood up I noticed she wasn't wearing a collar. &quot;Hey James!&quot; Amy said and I nodded, still trying to catch my breath. &quot;Sorry about that, but listen, are you going to watch the big tournament at your house?&quot; I blinked, and the confusion clearly showed, &quot;Don't tell me you've forgotten again! The lifebond tournament your cousin Sam is in!&quot; I nodded dumbly and she sighed and said, &quot;Come on,&quot; and she grabbed my hand and took of towards my house. <br />
<br />
It wasn't far, but my house had changed, with a wall around the garden, and the house itself was in the middle of the city, two enormous apartment buildings pressing in on either side. I grinned slightly at the sight and went inside. No one was home, but then, my mom was probably over at Aunt Cathy's helping Sara take care of her. Sam turned on the TV and pushed me down into the sofa, then went into the pantry and I could hear her rummaging around.<br />
<br />
On the TV I could see an enormous stadium packed with people and three small figures on either side. Two men, and four women. One of the women was my cousin, Sam, who was blushing and looking out of place at the commotion. I was stunned to see her wearing a collar as well.  Sam was a college student, but still very shy. I couldn't imagine what she was doing there. She was wearing red, along with a statuesque raven haired woman and a surly looking man. The other three people wore blue.<br />
<br />
The announcer came on and introduced them all, but that was mostly drowned out in a torrent of crashes from the pantry as Amy pulled the pots and pans down. I shrugged and watched as the announcer yelled for the match to start, then something amazing happened. Light emanated from the mens' hands and struck the women and all four changed. Sam started to swell, clothes shredding as she grew in size to ten, twenty, thirty feet tall, thick dark fur covering her body as well as her face lengthened into a vicious muzzle and her nails turned into tearing claws. Giant and wolf-like but for her tail, which was reptilian and ended in a cluster of needlelike spikes. Her team mate also changed, but her changes were subtle. Her skin turned marble white and she stiffened, arms flung back as if she was crucified, and she began to float off of the ground, rings of metal appearing and orbiting her body.<br />
<br />
The other two women changed, the one into a triceratops like creature with some kind of organic cannon embedded in it's back, and the second one's arms turned into enormous claws made of some kind of blue crystalline material that spread over her body like armor.<br />
<br />
I stared at the TV, mouth open, as they clashed and fought, shouting out move names like &quot;Thousand Sins Torrent!&quot; and &quot;Impossible Wretched Evisceration!&quot; The women did most of the fighting, but the men appeared to be doing some kind of magic as well and were clearly playing a key role. &quot;I wish I knew what was going on.&quot; I muttered, and suddenly I did. I'd forgotten about wishing for a second.<br />
<br />
In this world, the gender disparity was much greater. 90% of people were women. But that wasn't the only difference. Men were a valuable resource not only for reproduction, but also because they could preform a ritual and bond a woman to them, which ended with the woman &quot;collared and bound&quot;. It made the woman stronger and fitter, and the man could use various mystical seal techniques to transform the woman into forms that reflected their true selves. The women gained enormous power from this, but they relied on the man to survive, and had to stay within a few miles of him or start to wither and die, and had to engage in sexual activity every few days or the bond would become brittle and cause them constant pain. The bond could not be broken or released once created, only transferred through a complex ritual, typically used by the victor to take a &quot;collared and bound&quot; female in certain duels or if the victor felt the loser was mistreating his bound female. <br />
<br />
I blinked again after that immense infodump but then grinned. I liked the way this was going. On the TV I heard the man in red shout, &quot;Inevitability of Fate!&quot; And saw enormous metal rings lock down on the triceratops thing, her partner defeated, and then Sam slammed into it and tore into her, chunks of bloody gore flying until I heard the man in blue shout his surrender.<br />
<br />
Amy clapped behind me, &quot;Awesome! Sam's going to be in the finals!&quot;<br />
<br />
I turned and looked at Amy, and then I decided...</p>
