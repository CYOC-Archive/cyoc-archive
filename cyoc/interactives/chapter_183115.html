<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexis looked down at his hands, he wondered to himself if this was real life. If he really had these powers or he was simply dreaming. Maybe he should pinch himself.<br />
<br />
Punch!<br />
<br />
Alexis grabbed his arm quickly and looked to his left. He saw another one of his best friends, Michael. Michael had been a recent addition to his friendship group, but still remained one of his closest,<br />
“Alexis! I didn’t see you this morning!” He said, crossing his arms and cocking his hips, “you know I never forget birthdays,” he with a smug look on his face,<br />
“I know, I know,” Alexis replied, smiling whilst rubbing his arm, “it means a lot. Seriously,”<br />
They both laughed as they made their way to the library, where the group usually spent their time.<br />
Michael and Alexis were both from the same area and had vaguely known each other, usually from a passing ‘hello’ or ‘hi’. But once Michael joined the school, they found out that they had a lot in common and quickly became very close friends, to the point where Michael joined Alexis’ group.<br />
<br />
They spoke as they walked, talking about what Alexis had planned for his birthday. Alexis never liked celebrating his birthday, usually taking the opportunity to spend time with family and friends, but never asked for gifts. Alexis managed to avoid any conversation about the previous class with Michael, as he would obviously have to lie about it. Alexis was not a fan of lying, but as with life, it was sometimes necessary. Speaking of which, Alexis soon realised that he was going to have to give Justin, his friend from the previous class, a realistic reason as to why he went into the girls bathroom with Justin’s Ex girlfriend for the entire period.<br />
Alexis’ nerves quickly spiked, his mind racing with potential reasons that didn’t involve outright lying to one of his best friends in front of the rest of his best friends. Alexis started to notice something odd, however, while walking alongside Michael. Michael started slurring his words, as if being distracted by something. Alexis took his mind off of his panic to look at him. Michael looked a little flustered, similar to how Alexis looked whilst talking to Markus before first period. Alexis and Michael hadn’t passed any particularly hot guys in a few minutes, and this pretty sudden. Alexis started to wonder if this was something he did unconsciously, was it his nerves influencing his powers to make Michael suddenly flustered.<br />
Alexis stopped, Michael stopped with him, a little confused,<br />
“E-everything good, Alexis?” Michael asked, still not quite there,<br />
“Yeah. I was gonna ask you the same question,” Alexis hesitated before asking, “you look a little... off..?”<br />
“Oh! No, it’s uh- nothing! I’m just a little tired is all,” Michael said, biting his lip for a split second. He failed to make any eye contact with Alexis, still in his own head.<br />
Alexis was almost certain it was something to do with his powers and emotions. He took a deep breath, and let his mind focus on something else.<br />
“Do you think anyone got me a gift?” Alexis asked,<br />
“W-wait... you always said you hated gifts,” Michael responded, it seemed like he was coming back to reality,<br />
“Yeah I know,” Alexis said, studying Michael’s emotions, “I-I mean I still do! I just... wondered,” Alexis said, shuffling his feet, “Barry and Brie bought me a book,” he said, shifting the subject slightly,<br />
“Really!?” Michael said, hitting the back of his hand against Alexis. He was back. “Damn, if I knew I would’ve bought you something!”<br />
<br />
Alexis and Michael had a pleasant walk to the library. They arrived, finding Barry, Toni, Brie, Wilson, and... no Justin to be found. Odd.<br />
“Happy birthday!” They all said to Alexis as he walked in. Alexis smiled, thanking them all. He said hello to Barry and Brie, but proceeded to accept hugs from both Toni and Wilson.<br />
Toni was a short Asian girl, she didn’t have an accent, born in the U.S., but was one of the most genuine people Alexis knew. However, she did get a little too excited and tended to go a little overboard in places. For example, she got very drunk at a group party and broke her leg. Luckily, she was too drunk to notice, but her parents put an indefinite ban on alcohol for her.<br />
Wilson was a white boy with dirty blonde hair. He had two defining features that made him known around the school. The first being his weight. Wilson was a little more than chubby, sitting in the fat category. He wasn’t obese, but wasn’t slim enough to hide his size. However, of course, this didn’t affect how the group saw him. At heart, he was a kind, smart, and brave kid who would stand up for any of his friends in any situation.<br />
Secondly, his most defining, would be his hot older sister. She was only a little older than him, and lucky for half the school, she was kept back a Grade. Ironically, she was in the same friendship group as Monica, the girl from Alexis’ Chemistry Class. Her name was Brianna. She was 6’0 (the same height as Alexis), pretty curvy and slim, and had the same dirty blonde hair as her brother. As mentioned before, Brianna had admittedly had a crush on Alexis for a few years. Alexis, being the good friend that he is, didn’t reciprocate these feelings as he didn’t want to betray one of his closest friends. Then again, he did just get a handjob from Justin’s Ex...<br />
<br />
Toni and Wilson sat back down. Everyone was looking at Alexis, which confused him a little. He awkwardly said,<br />
“Well... I didn’t prepare a speech, so I’m sorry to disappoint,” which everyone chuckled at,<br />
“Don’t worry,” Brie said, “we all just wanted you to know how much you mean to us, dude,”<br />
“Yeah!” Barry said, resulting in his twin kicking his shin, “what did I say!?” He complained afterwards. Everyone laughed.<br />
<br />
The next period was spent talking and enjoying each other’s company, but quickly it became time for lunch. Alexis didn’t feel like eating, so he decided to sit alone as everyone made their way to the cafeteria, which the group understood.<br />
Sitting alone, Alexis stared into silence. Unable to think about much other than his powers and what had happened in the bathroom. He couldn’t ignore it, it was real, this was real. As cool as these powers were, he had to talk to someone about them in a serious way. The person he opened up to the most was his dad. Ever since he was a child, he talked to his dad about everything. He always helped Alexis understand and make sense of his issues, whether they be issues with dating, friends, powers capable of altering reality itself.<br />
Alexis whipped out his phone and began typing a message to his father,<br />
‘Hey dad. I apologise that this is short notice but I need to talk to you about something that happened this morning.<br />
It’s kind of weird, but if anyone will understand it’ll be’<br />
Alexis stopped typing, he could hear something from behind him. He quickly closed his phone, not risking anyone seeing his message. He looked up and saw...</p>
