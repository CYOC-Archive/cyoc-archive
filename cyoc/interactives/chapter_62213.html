<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Nate walked out of the store, he had several shudders course over his entire being. He wasn't sure of what was going on, but he didn't 
mind it to be completely honest. For some reason, the shudders felt good, like a part of him was more alive than it had ever been. As Nate 
started heading toward the party, he felt as though walking upright on two legs would take forever and wanted to test this new makeup to see 
how far he could actually push it. Slowly, Nate got onto all fours and felt this was an even more comfortable stance to take. What was even 
more surprising was the fact that he could actually feel the ground beneath his hands and feet... as if he wasn't wearing any sort of device. 
Testing them, he felt that they were as sturdy as his own appendages. Wanting to take the next step, Nate took one step forward, then another 
and another quickly behind it until he found himself running down the street at blustering speeds and Nate got to his buddy's house before he 
knew it.</br>
<br><em>Man... whatever Colin did to me is awesome! I can't wait for everyone else to see me like this!</em></br>
<br>As Nate trotted toward the front gate, he slowly rose onto his two hind legs and found that they were easier to move around in. He just 
chalked it up to having broke in the new devices like brand new shoes. Nate simply shrugged it off, but suddenly... something happened that 
Nate wasn't expecting. Something new, something foreign wafted into his nostrils and he sniffed around to find the source. Off in the distance, 
behind the nearest window, Nate could actually see and <strong>smell</strong> the food. Scratching his head with his paws, he realized he 
had felt his own hair and even stranger... his pointed ears. Thinking back, Nate didn't remember Colin putting any pointed ears on him, but 
thought nothing of it, thinking that he must have missed that part.</br>
<br>Nate went into Charlie's home, spent a little bit of time at the party, getting more and more accustomed to his werewolf self, which won 
him best costume... of course he won, it was all thanks to Colin. Thinking of Colin made Nate want to go back to the costume shop and thank 
him. After all, it was the least he could do for the guy who not only helped him win, but did it for free. Saying goodbye to Charlie, Nate plopped 
down onto all fours and hurried back to the shop. Just as he got there, he saw Colin locking up.</br>
<br>"Hey there Colin! Man... thanks to you, I won best costume!"</br>
<br>"Aww man, that's great! I am glad you are happy that you won and I really hope that you enjoy the new you!" Colin said with a grin.</br>
<br>"The new me? What do you mean... the new me?" Nate asked with a slight amount of concern in his voice.</br>
<br>"Yeah... the new you! You are a werewolf now... permanently." Colin said as he turned the deadbolt to the locked position.</br>
<br>"Um... I am not sure what you are talking about Colin... I am not a real werewolf. You put this makeup on me and I look like a real 
werewolf, but I am not one... am I?" Nate asked with a slight bit of questioning in his own voice, thinking about everything that led up to that 
moment.</br>
<br>"Yeah... you really are one now and I must say, you are probably my best work yet! I had always wanted to create a werewolf up until now. 
My mom wouldn't let me, but I finally convinced her just before you came into my shop the other day. You are a werewolf, you will turn back at 
some point today and you will be able to go back and forth between forms at your own desire. Cool huh?!"</br>
<br>At first, Nate didn't know what he wanted to say. This was all quite a bit for him, but he knew that Colin couldn't have been lying. The 
increased speed, the new senses... even feeling the ground beneath his pads. It was all true... he was now a full blooded werewolf and Nate 
could not have been happier.</br>
<br>"So... what now?" Nate asked, getting up onto his hind legs.</br>
<br>"Well... you can go live your life, albeit it is going to be unnatural and you will have longevity far beyond that of any mortal. In fact, you 
are immortal and you will never age past the appearance of your mid thirties..." Colin said, trailing off, as if he wanted to add something but 
dared not mention it.</br>
<br>"Hey Colin... it seems like there is something else you wanted to say. I can see it in your eyes, so don't try to lie." Nate said 
confidently.</br>
<br>Colin smiled while scratching his head. "Well... yeah... there was one thing. You remember how I told you that I love werewolves?"</br>
<br>"Yeah... I remember that, why?" Nate asked, slightly confused.</br>
<br>"Well... the thing is... I have always wanted to be one myself. I am forbidden to use the skills on myself for one. Another thing is that 
mama just would not understand. The third thing is... well... I kinda want to be attacked and forced into being a werewolf. It's kind of a fantasy 
of mine." Colin said, his face turning a bit red and you knew there was something more to it that he wasn't telling you, but you decided not to 
pry. You knew that it would come out in this conversation at some point, sooner or later.</br>
<br>"Ok... that's cool man! We all have our fantasies... so how do you want to be forced into being a werewolf?" Nate asked with a new sense 
of curiosity... seeing exactly where things could lead.</br>
<br>"Well... I could run away from you, but you would have to do something to scare me first. You could tackle me to the ground, then bite or 
scratch me..." Colin said, trailing off once again.</br>
<br>"Come on man... I know there is something else that you aren't saying, now spill it!" Nate said with a slight growl and a full snarl at the 
end, his wolfish nature starting to take over his mind.</br>
<br>Before Colin could even utter a single word, a new smell wafted into your nose, smelling sweet like cologne. Curious as to what it was, 
Nate moved closer to where he thought the scent was coming from... that was until Nate was nearly wolven to human chest with Colin. As Nate 
stood there, he looked down to see that not only was Colin sporting some wood, but he was leaking too. Taking in a huge whiff, the smell was 
extremely intoxicating and Nate knew that Colin was extremely aroused. As Nate looked Colin in the face, he could see that Colin was bright 
red from a bit of embarrassment.</br>
<br>"Yeah... there is that too... damn it! I wish..." Colin started to say, but Nate put a clawed paw finger to his mouth.</br>
<br>"Say no more! I know exactly what you want because I want it too. The thing is... I am going to let you make the next move." Nate said 
with a wolfish grin.</br></p>
