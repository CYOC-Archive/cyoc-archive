<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nellie stayed fairly close to Martha as the two finished their shopping and Martha did privately smile as she couldn&#39;t help but feel Nellie&#39;s eyes on her and her purchases earlier in the day. For the moment, neither knew about the events that were going on that involved the second agent coming to Moon Lake from Alabama, but neither were they worried about that sort of thing. The two were old friends who had both come to Moon Lake and joined the local were population and in discovering that their old friends had become weres, Martha and Nellie had learned a fair bit about each other as well.<br />
<br />
Martha&#39;s mind in fact focused on the knowledge of what Nellie was paying attention to with regard to her purchases. For some things like the clothing she picked out that would be good for a gym class that would be able to move with her and would look as professional as possible, it wasn&#39;t too much, but Nellie&#39;s noting on the sizes for the sports bras and underwear that Martha had collected were enough to make her blush a little. Back when they&#39;d been growing up and going through college and Martha had been suppressing the occasional urges that drew her to women as much as they drew her William because that was what she was expected to be, the attention would have made her nervous and second guess herself. Now, as a werecat, she felt calm and confident and willingly open to recognize that women could be just as attractive as men and she actually enjoyed the attention. The fact that the attention she had was from an old friend from Minnesota was a surprise, but that didn&#39;t mean that Martha didn&#39;t like.<br />
<br />
Martha quietly swiped her credit card through the store&#39;s reader and followed the appropriate instructions that the device displayed. The cashier&#39;s register made a few buzzing sounds and the man there turned to the register and pulled a small slip of paper off and presented it to Martha. He instructed her to sign one and the other would be for her own records. Martha signed and thanked him before turning to join with Nellie, who had also paid for her items at a different check-out isle. The two met near the doors to the store and began to walk out together.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s strange to have run into each other again after so long,&quot; Martha found herself commenting as she looked for something to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... but it is nice,&quot; Nellie smiled as they made their way across the parking lot. &quot;And learning your bi was also a pleasant surprise... very pleasant.&quot;<br />
<br />
The way her voice trailed off at the end gave a bit of a hint at what the two of them had planned to do with the rest of their afternoon. Nellie was obviously looking forward to it, and as a werecat and by agreement in a now open marriage, Martha had to admit that she felt fairly eager as well. Nellie was never ugly, but in becoming a were, she had filled out very well. The only thing that Martha was curious over was what Nellie had said about wanting to be more than a friend with her. Now, they had the plan to be more than friends, but Nellie had made the mention that Nellie had had those feelings since high school. As they approached a fairly nice looking but slightly older Ford Taurus Martha found she had to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nellie... you said you wanted to be more than friends since high school?&quot; Martha asked as she heard Nellie unlock the doors to the car, allowing her to set the bags in the backseat of the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nellie said with a weak smile, &quot;You were cute, smart, funny, and fun to be with. In a way, you were someone that I felt I could bond with... And I&#39;ll admit that I followed you to college and as an aide in Minnesota in the hopes of being more than friends one day... but at times you were distant and seemingly confused over something, but wouldn&#39;t say and then you fell in love and married William... At the time, I didn&#39;t want to get in your way. I found John, and we&#39;ve been and still are very happy together and settled for just being friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then moved to sit down in the front seat of the car. As Nellie started the cars engine, Martha leaned across the center armrest between them and kissed Nellie&#39;s cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said earlier... high school and college were fairly rough for me with regards to who I am,&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;My folks and sister all felt being strictly straight was the way to go and constantly talked down about lesbians, gays, or those who were bi... It wasn&#39;t hatred, but more like they were disappointed in those who were and my family simply couldn&#39;t be bothered to interact with them any more than they might absolutely have to. A live and let live sort of deal, though not necessarily cordial.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch,&quot; Nellie sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it lead to me repressing that I was bi when I began having thoughts that included women in my fantasies as well as men,&quot; Martha sighed, &quot;Now... my love for William is real and since we&#39;ve become weres... I LOVE having my werefox at night... But as a werecat, I&#39;ve also realized that I was repressing a part of myself and accepted fully who and what I am. It was rough for me through high school and college... but I&#39;m better now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; Nellie commented as she glanced to her old friend, though she also did her best to focus on Martha&#39;s breasts, which were covered by the shirt she was wearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;And since you&#39;ve long been in an open marriage and William&#39;s and my marriage had to become open so I could become a werecat to his werefox,&quot; Martha continued with a knowing smile, &quot;we can be MORE than friends now and still be happy with our respective husbands... Me and my Red Fox and you and your...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;European Mink would be the exact species,&quot; Nellie answered, &quot;but simply saying Mink will be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded, &quot;Me and my fox and you and your mink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nellie smiled at that and drove along and began to head back in toward the center of Moon Lake. As she made the turn to leave the K-Mart parking lot, she asked the main question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay now... I texted John while we were in the store and he&#39;ll pick up our girls at school on his way home, so we&#39;re free for the afternoon,&quot; Nellie commented, &quot;All we need now is the directions to where you and William have settled in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded and gave Nellie the address where her family had moved to, and even described the route she&#39;d used to walk to the K-Mart. That earned a smile and a thank you as the to drove on with thoughts of very adult fun going through their minds.</p>
