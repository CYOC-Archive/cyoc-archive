<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Karen was a bit surprised by the kiss. Admittedly, it wasn&#39;t a romantic or sexual one. It was more a soft peck on the check that one might associate with either a parent to child or with an older sibling comforting a younger sibling. However, that effort at comfort didn&#39;t completely help as Karen&#39;s body began to tremor again. She felt warm all over and could feel a growing need for Rich build within her. The sun had just sunk below the horizon and it seemed like her body was responding to it, building to what had started when she got the idea to play around with Rich the previous night. She thought she might have a bit more time, and hoped for it, since Rich never came back to the cabin, but he&#39;d apparently gotten a flat tire was delayed. Karen was thankful that Olivia had offered to help and wasn&#39;t angry with Karen over both the blowjob or the fact that now Karen needed to be with Olivia&#39;s boyfriend to complete the transformation that was now starting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything will be okay,&quot; Olivia promised to Karen, &quot;Right now though... we got to get you out of those clothes...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrrrrrich,&quot; Karen gave a groan and hearing a cracking sound as her face began pushing forward. She ran her tongue along the inside of her teeth and could feel that her canine teeth were already lengthening and her molars were far sharper and thinner, as if more to interlock with each other and slice through meat rather than crush food the way human teeth normally did. She could also feel that need for Rich growing firmer and firmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Olivia spoke, catching some scent of arousal growing in Karen. The teen was starting to change and it was happening with a vengeance. Karen&#39;s face was pushing forward into a tiger&#39;s rounded muzzle with her nose becoming a pick triangle at its front. A downy coat of orange fur was slowly starting to grow on the bridge of Karen&#39;s nose.  She could hear some footsteps in the distance, and hoped that was Rich, because Karen was changing and would need to complete her transformation, but that didn&#39;t change the need for Olivia to make sure that Karen didn&#39;t destroy her clothing transforming. &quot;And he&#39;ll be here soon, but right now... you&#39;re already changing. We need to get you out of those clothes. We can return them to the cabin after your transformation is completed... but right now...&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen managed a slow nod and began to shimmy out of her shoes, which were only loosely tied. As she managed to kick them off, one might have accidentally hit Olivia in the knee, but the Olivia didn&#39;t seem to respond to it. Karen looked down and felt the sticks and tree needles a bit rough at the moment, and found that while her toes were beginning to grow orange fur on top of them and her toenails were lengthening and narrowing into claws, her feet hadn&#39;t begun to lengthen, yet. She managed to slide her sweatpants down and found that more fur was also growing across her legs. On the outside of her legs the fur was orange and on the inside it was a snow white color. And banding around her legs and running down her legs, just as she&#39;d seen on Mrs. Saxon were black stripes.<br />
<br />
Olivia then carefully helped Karen out of her shirt, revealing more of Karen&#39;s changing body. She could see Karen&#39;s muscles twitch and swell with almost every spasm. From what Olivia could see, Karen&#39;s weretiger form would fit most weretiger coloring with her underbelly, the underside of her arms, and her inner legs being white fur, along with two patches above her eyes, while the rest was orange fur with black stripes. Olivia could also tell that Karen&#39;s transformation was also progressing faster, and she would truly need Rich quite soon.<br />
<br />
Karen couldn&#39;t help but shake and shiver a bit as her body continued to change. The shivering was not due to cold. In fact, her body still felt very warm as her fur grew thicker around her. The shivering was coming from the growth that her body was going through. She could feel her muscles growing larger and more lithe. By now, the ground wasn&#39;t bothering her feet as much as thick pads formed underneath her toes and the balls of her feet and they were starting to lengthen as well. It was something that put them into a more digitigrade stance as she seemed to feel like she was rising into the air. However, the biggest thing that she felt was the growing need for Rich. She could smell her own arousal now and could feel her nipples begin to push through white fur on her now growing breasts. It was getting to be too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;RRRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriccccccccchhhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot; Karen let out a growling moan when she finally heard a male answer from behind her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know... and I&#39;m here,&quot; came Rich&#39;s voice making Karen turn from Olivia and over her shoulder, where she could see Rich making his way through the trees. He was fully transformed with his tail slowly swishing behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You came...&quot; Karen slowly managed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rich answered, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect the flat tire... and it took a bit longer than I expected. Sorry, I&#39;m late...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need you,&quot; Karen breathed feeling herself quiver in anticipation and began to stagger toward him. She tripped a little as she came forward, as she was trying to adapt to her new digitigrade feet. But her growing need was so high that she really didn&#39;t care about anything else. She didn&#39;t notice Olivia collecting her clothing and shoes. She didn&#39;t notice feeling of her ears moving through her hair to the top of her head. She had the burning need to finish her transformation, finish shedding her humanity. She needed Rich for that, and his presence and his scent only added to that burning need. It made her wet and drove her on, as she approached him. And then she saw his shaft begin to rise out of his sheath and that drove her forward. &quot;I need you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Rich answered, privately glad that that he wasn&#39;t too late. He may not have been there &quot;on time,&quot; but neither was he too late. The whole situation had been one that frightened him a bit. Moon Lake&#39;s public school system included various means to provide measures to help young weres understand how the were virus worked and how it could effect others. To a certain extent this included the warnings that the virus was active in all weres, even those too young to have had their first transformation. It was something that Moon Lake stressed that young weres were to be very careful around normal humans. Holding hands wouldn&#39;t spread the were-virus, but open wounds, cuts inflicted by were, or any sort of sexual contact would spread the virus, and while being a were wasn&#39;t a bad thing, Moon Lake held forcing someone to become a were to be the biggest crime after murder.<br />
<br />
Rich may have skipped a few grades when he went through elementary, middle, and high school, but he still learned the lessons that all Moon Lake students learned. And Rich had felt that these laws were important and tried to make it his life&#39;s mission to avoid any sort of uncontrolled situation. For an incomplete transformation could be psychologically taxing on a new were, and he could remember his own parents discussing the effect of what Yvette Smith had done with a fellow student at the college. There was fear that that would leave the new werefox mentally unstable, and Rich didn&#39;t want be a part of any situation like that. And then came the present situation with Karen. He really shouldn&#39;t have let her get as close as she did with him, and while he didn&#39;t claw her and got her off of him before he came the previous night, she&#39;d apparently gotten enough of him to come into contact with the were-virus and brought about the transformation happening before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please...&quot; Karen gave a growling moan as her eyes focused on Rich&#39;s now erect shaft, the thing that had brought about the new her. She needed him badly and she practically ached with it. She didn&#39;t even notice that despite him being in his fursona that the pair of them stood on near equal terms. Rich might be a bit bigger than she was, but not truly by all that much. All that mattered was completing what had been building all day.<br />
<br />
Rich came to her with a nod, moved carefully to position his penis so that he would do Karen no harm. He wanted to do his best to be as gentle as she could while reaching to caress her now wider furry hips, and her fur was soft, just as Olivia&#39;s was. He didn&#39;t haver get much option to look to Olivia to assure her that this was only in relation to completing Karen&#39;s transformation when Karen took the initiative, and reached forward toward his backside and literally pulled herself onto him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I NEED this,&quot; Karen gave an almost impatient growl as she felt her lower lips being filled to the brim. With as aroused as she&#39;d become with the first transformation hitting into high gear, she felt there was no need to worry about Rich&#39;s girth and was driven to push herself forward. And to feel his penis stretch her inner walls and some of the blunter spines on the sides of his shaft tickle her vaginal membranes was so good, that Karen seemed to lose all concern on nearly everything around them. It felt good and she thrust her hips forward to get more. She ignored as her tail in alternating orange and black stripes stretched out behind her. The only thing that mattered was completing her transformation and now that Rich had finally arrived she would do just that.<br />
<br />
And it felt good. Karen loved it, especially as Rich answered her thrusts with thrusts of his own and holding her to him. It felt good and satisfied the need growing in Karen since her transformation had begun just as she&#39;d stumbled onto Olivia while looking for Rich. It felt even better as Rich ran one hand along the curve of Karen&#39;s butt and pulling her onto him. At one point one of Rich&#39;s fingers brushed at the base of her newly grown tail and that sent shivers of pleasure through Karen&#39;s body, though if Rich did that deliberately, Karen couldn&#39;t tell. Some of the questions on whether it was deliberate soon vanished as Rich brought one paw-like hand up to softly cup Karen&#39;s left breast, which had grown into the D range, slightly smaller than Olivia, but Karen had the sense that she still had a bit more natural growing to do before she was fully mature.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th... tha… thank yooooooooooouuuuuuuuuwwwwwwwwwwww, Rich,&quot; Karen managed a pleasure filled moan as she felt her body fill with pleasure as he began to piston himself in and out of her and she answered every thrust of his with of her own. She barely noticed the actual volume her voice had reached, as she was too caught up in the pleasure of everything and the sense of &quot;completeness&quot; that was slowly beginning to replace the more animalistic need she&#39;d had when her transformation started.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... ohhhh...kay,&quot; Rich managed as he began to feel his penis half twitch inside Karen. He was getting close, and he guessed that so was Karen. In this he increased his pace as best he could, mostly slowed down a bit by the fact that both of them had engaged in this while standing up, but both managed to keep their balance and Karen seemed to be rapidly catching on. And his success at this soon became audibly apparent for miles around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Rich... I&#39;m... I&#39;m... gonna...&quot; Karen began as she felt everything build up in her and then as her body clinched in orgasm and gripping the spines at the base of Rich&#39;s penis tightly and released her first full roar, &quot;AAWWWWWRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rich joined her in a deeper roar he erupted with in her shortly after. There followed a brief moment of silence as Karen recovered from everything and a lot of her conscious mind came back. She felt complete and free, and was the weretigress she&#39;d always wanted to be. True, the stripes on her arms and legs weren&#39;t like the way they were drawn on Marvel&#39;s heroine, but at the same time, weretiger had always sat highly on her list. And besides, Mrs. Saxon was right in that comic artists and cartoonists drawing anthropomorphic tigers often drew things that would make sense to someone standing erect, but wouldn&#39;t make since on all fours. Her stripes were there to help obscure her outline among the trees and the grass, confuse prey on what was shadow and what was her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Rich,&quot; Karen managed as she looked over her muzzle to his, &quot;the exact path to this may not have been the one that I would have wanted... Particularly with regard to not wanting my parents to get scared over things and forbid me from being our family&#39;s were. But the end result was what I wanted, thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you do make a beautiful weretigress,&quot; Rich spoke politely to her, &quot;and I&#39;m sure that Peter Brooks should have nothing to complain about.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoughts of Peter danced through her head at the mention of the weredog&#39;s name, and that brought a small smile to Karen&#39;s lips. He&#39;d done so much to help her, when in pure theory he didn&#39;t need to. Especially after her mother had essentially put down his mother over things. She wasn&#39;t sure if it would be anything more than friendship between her and Peter, but if it was to be something more, now there was nothing that could truly stop them. As both were weres.</p>
