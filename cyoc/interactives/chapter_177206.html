<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Breakfast work done, Todd and George headed back to the cabin for a little rest before they had to go down to the obstacle course. It was sure to be a busy day for the two of them as the course was pretty popular with the young critters as it was all climbing and jumping and swinging from ropes. Basically a glorified playground with an entrance and an exit.<br />
<br />
George eyed Todd walking at his side. &quot;You don&#39;t find this weird?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Find what weird?&quot; Todd asked, sounding genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
George just sort of waved about him. &quot;This.. all this.. yesterday we were.. were..&quot; George found his mouth couldn&#39;t even form the words to say they were a couple of businessmen stranded on the side of the road and now they were playing camp counselors without even thinking about it. In fact George had to concentrate hard to think of himself as anything other than his current rabbity self. He couldn&#39;t even recall his old face, or his old family for that matter.<br />
<br />
&quot;First day of camp is always weird.&quot; Todd said with a nod, missing the point completely.<br />
<br />
George eyed Todd again, wondering if the monkey had given completely in and stopped fighting. Why was he still fighting? Was it really all that bad? And if this was just a weekend camp, maybe it would all be back to normal in a day or two.  Todd held the cabin door open for George, then gave him a firm slap on the ass as he walked by, causing the jock rabbit to yelp a little. It didn&#39;t hurt, it was just surprising.<br />
<br />
As Todd stepped in and let the cabin door close behind him, George fixed him with a bit of a glare. &quot;What was tha.. mmmph..&quot; His words were cut off as he suddenly found himself locking lips with Todd. Along with the disconcerting sensation of having to lift a bit on his feet to meet those lips. George was quite a bit shorter than he used to be, after all. He felt the bulge in Todd&#39;s shorts pressing against his own. A hand slipping under his shirt to caress at one white-furred pec.<br />
<br />
This was wrong. Todd was married with kids! George was painfully straight! They hated each other! And yet George wanted this more than anything right now. As Todd kept caressing his chest he felt his leg vibrate, his foot pounding out a rapid thump-thump-thump on the floor. Before he knew it, clothes were coming off and being tossed haphazardly about the cabin. George reached up to take off the red scarf but Todd stopped him. &quot;Leave that on.&quot; Todd still had his own wrapped around his neck.<br />
<br />
They fell on one of the bunks in a tangle of limbs. Todd was laying on his back with George straddling him. Both were completely lost in the moment, but George paused briefly when he felt the tip of a cock pressed between his cheeks. He knew this is what he wanted. His old self would be horrified. Not only about to have sex with a guy, but as the bottom? George was an alpha, he was the guy in charge, he was the one every other guy was jealous off. He was taking Todd&#39;s dick with a soft moan and another vibrating thumping of his leg.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Todd had his hands on George&#39;s hips as the rabbit began to ride his cock. George was something special, not small and frail like most rabbits, he had a heavily muscled body that drove the monkey crazy. A mix of cute and hunky he couldn&#39;t get out of his head. He brought up his tail and wrapped it around George&#39;s cock, stroking it off as the bunny rose and fell on his cock.<br />
<br />
George especially seemed to like this. Smiling as he looked down at the tail wrapped around his manhood. He couldn&#39;t believe this was the same grumpy asshole he had been around all week. Though that thought was only in passing, surfacing and sinking back down like all his memories of his old life were doing. He knew George was fighting it, but Todd didn&#39;t want to.<br />
<br />
He was young again, horny, and if the looks he was getting were anything to go by, sexy. Todd was happy to give in to this weird world and take George along for the ride. He wanted to deny the feelings for the rabbit at first, but why? Why should he when they seemed so perfect together.<br />
<br />
He felt his cock twitching between the rabbit&#39;s soft-furred buns. With a soft moan, George planted himself completely on Todd&#39;s twitching manhood, the rabbit&#39;s nose twitching violently as he came, spurting globs of cum across Todd&#39;s stomach and chest. The squeezing of George&#39;s cheeks on his own cock causing him to fill the rabbit with his own seed, a low deep groan coming from his throat as he did.<br />
<br />
George rolled off of Todd. The bunk had just enough room for them to squeeze in side by side, though a bit uncomfortably. They both just stared up at the wooden rafters in the cabin ceiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;That happened?&quot; George asked, sounding disbelieving.<br />
<br />
&quot;That happened.&quot; Todd confirmed, shifting onto his side, leaning forward to get the rabbit pulled into another kiss. &quot;And I wouldn&#39;t mind it happening again, later though.&quot; He looked down at himself and the mess George made on him. &quot;For now, I need to take another shower before we have to be at our station.&quot;<br />
<br />
Todd crawled over George and out of the bed, pulling on some shorts as he grabbed his towel for the second shower of the morning and headed out of the cabin.</p>
