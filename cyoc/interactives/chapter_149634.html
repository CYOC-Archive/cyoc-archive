<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The entrance into Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall was relatively quiet and there really weren&#39;t too many people there. However, from what John could hear, there seemed to be a lot of commotion going on. He looked over to a large window area that was set up as an entry point and likely where people coming in to City Hall would then go regarding various administrative functions and questions about the city&#39;s finances and so on. That was where most of the commotion was and was combined with ringing phones and a small handful of answers to them. From what he could overhear, it sounded like some pushback against the City Council meeting from the previous night, which John half expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on,&quot; Ginger gave a gentle tug on his arm, &quot;the city&#39;s courts are on the other side of the building. And if that&#39;s who you said Huck Jenkins is going to... he&#39;d head there. There&#39;s a central hallway that we can follow. It will take us all the way in to that side of the building.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; John said slowly and then followed along after Ginger as she lead him along.<br />
<br />
He was a bit nervous as to whether or not they were allowed in, as normally small town city offices often kept hours that would mirror many businesses in that staff wouldn&#39;t be in on a weekend unless there was an emergency. And while the results of the meeting to ultimately reveal weres to the world might qualify for Moon Lake, John couldn&#39;t be one hundred percent sure if that truly would apply. However, no one stopped them as they made their way down a fairly narrow hallway that went straight down the building&#39;s center line, which made some sense. From the angle that John and Ginger had come up on the building, it actually appeared rather narrow.<br />
<br />
His focus though was waiting to see if he could hear Huck&#39;s voice. From as far as John knew, Huck and Betty had planned a more low key affair than what Jenny and Harry had. Possibly because of the life-long friendship that the two had had and that Huck had never noticed that for Betty, more than friendship was desired. John didn&#39;t know all the details, but to a degree that really didn&#39;t matter as Huck had been kind and helpful to him. In fact, Huck was one of the few people he&#39;d actually told about some of his questions on &quot;who he was&quot; and Huck had been quite understanding and helpful. And as such, John rather liked Huck. Like the rest of the Jenkins family, Huck provided some sense of &quot;family&quot; that James Harper Senior could never provide. Thus, if this was the wedding, John didn&#39;t think saying &quot;congratulations&quot; was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
About half way through the building the tile actually changed color, which John figured signified meant that they had actually gotten into the half of the building that was connected to the city court system. That was further confirmed when he heard a voice drifting from nearby door. It was Huck&#39;s and John noted that the door was left open just a hair which let Huck&#39;s voice drift out into the hallway as John and Ginger approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you... this means a lot!&quot; was what John and Ginger heard as they approached the door, &quot;with all the stuff going on... I was nervous that there would be no room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While there may be a fair number of civil cases in line,&quot; came the answer, &quot;Judge Thompkins is free at the moment. If you wait out in the court entry area. I&#39;ll let Judge Thompkins know and he&#39;ll be out to see you shortly.&quot;<br />
<br />
The door then opened a mere moment later as Huck and Betty came out into the hall, leaving John and Ginger looking back as both sort of blinked in surprise. Huck and Betty were a bit surprised as they didn&#39;t actually expect a run in with anyone, as he knew that his parents and Betty&#39;s family had known both of them for quite awhile and had seemed friendly toward them. Thinking back on it at times, Huck even wondered if there were times when he and Betty had been hanging out and her parents had something that indicated some of Betty&#39;s romantic interest in him. It was one of those things that made him wonder how he could be so dense as to miss that. That was really why their planned ceremony was to be small, quick, and private. And as such, he didn&#39;t expect to run into John with a weretigress leading him. John was also a bit surprised, though much of that was also the fact that the whole thing had purely been by chance. The result was that both of them sort of stood silently for a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... John... what brings you here?&quot; Betty spoke up, while holding Huck&#39;s arm, &quot;not rushing into anything, I hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
John glanced to Ginger and couldn&#39;t help but blush and then looked down for a moment, though Betty&#39;s question did finally break the ice. He eventually looked up and answered, &quot;No... Ginger was just showing me around town. The high school, sites to see... we were actually on the way to see the lake when I saw you come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn&#39;t mean to intrude,&quot; Ginger added.<br />
<br />
&quot;But if they could... I wanted to be able to say congratulations,&quot; John then finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s very thoughtful,&quot; Huck gave a small smile, &quot;and since you&#39;re in the area... I suppose you might as well hang around. Judge Thompkins does appear to have time.&quot;<br />
<br />
John nodded as Huck and Betty continued to walk along until they came into a sort of circular room at the end of the hallway with two sets of stairs running along the edge that lead up to the second level. These stairs were stone and looked hand carved with wooden railings. The thing that caught John&#39;s eyes the most was the tiled mosaic of a sort of religious figure on the floor with a series of animals around him and look up to the figure. Ginger caught this and commented to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s Saint Francis of Assisi, the Patron Saint of Animals,&quot; Ginger commented, &quot;and to Moon Lake&#39;s Catholics... the Patron Saint of Weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even with all the legends...&quot; John began slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legends don&#39;t necessarily mean that certain beliefs die away,&quot; Huck commented, &quot;and a fair number of normal families that moved to Moon Lake came in Christian... or Jewish... or Hindu... or Muslim... Becoming a were didn&#39;t necessarily remove their religious beliefs. There&#39;s been historic concern about politicians trying to use religion to preach some measure of fire and brimstone, but that doesn&#39;t suddenly make people atheists.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in a way... many weres that are more spiritual would assert that their abilities were gifts from God,&quot; Ginger added, &quot;to give us the strength to protect our friends. The comradery to stand by their side. The sympathy to empathize with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Interesting...&quot; John commented and looked down at the mosaic again and then looked up to Huck and Betty who stood together, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if we interrupted anything or...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nothing...&quot; Huck said raising a hand, &quot;a lot of this on our part has been more to get things ready... As now that I&#39;m fit to move again, and found someone who&#39;s very lovely and loved me even when I was too blind to see it... for years... we&#39;re looking settle things quickly and without too much of a fuss. Nothing quiet or noisy. Especially after all the hoopla that went on with what was done with your sister&#39;s wedding. Something low key and private... but that doesn&#39;t mean some congratulatory well wishers aren&#39;t welcome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is a good thing, as you will need witnesses,&quot; came a male voice from the top of the stairs making them look up.<br />
<br />
Coming around from the upper floor was Judge Thompkins, presently dressed in a pair of black pants with a blue shirt and a red tie. For the moment he wasn&#39;t wearing his judicial robes, but then the time for marriage ceremonies were a bit different from major court proceedings. He came down and looked to John and Ginger and then looked back to Huck and Betty.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when I say witnesses... I mean legal witnesses,&quot; Judge Thompkins spoke, &quot;I cannot say on the boy... but the girl is too young to serve as an official legal witness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are age limits on that?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To provide for legality... yes,&quot; Judge Thompkins nodded, &quot;now, I&#39;m sure we can pull in a pair to witness things if you so wish, and the wait won&#39;t be too long. But we will need a legal witness.&quot;<br />
<br />
John looked down for a moment, though he did get some reassurance when Ginger gave a soft squeeze of his hand. Huck and Betty shrugged and then nodded in acceptance. They had been eager for this, though perhaps a bit too eager  and had overlooked the fact that a legal witness would be needed. As then nodded, Judge Thompkins patted both of them on the shoulder and then assured them that things would be fine as he walked back to the hallway where the group had come from on the ground floor. John watched him walk for a few moments and stood by quietly. A part of him noted how quiet things were in this part of the building when contrasted with the other end and the noise that likely related to the results of the City Council meeting. It wasn&#39;t too long before more footsteps on the tile were heard and he looked up again to see Judge Thompkins returning with a pair of secretaries. Huck recognized them from the docket office that he&#39;d made the request at and noted that each of them carried a small form with them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The court secretaries can handle the witness duties,&quot; Judge Thompkins spoke, &quot;It will mean that your wedding certificate will be a bit... generic... legal... but nothing special.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Betty said to him, &quot;So long as things work... I&#39;ll be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judge Thompkins nodded and there followed a bit of placing the party so that things were arranged in a way that would work. The judge stood before the doorway that lead to the hallway in the center of the building&#39;s axis. Huck and Betty stood before him while John and Ginger stood a little way&#39;s away with the two secretaries who held two form letters that would essentially fill out the marriage certificate. As everyone was placed, Judge Thompkins then began.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are gathered today in the entry area to the legal section to Moon Lake&#39;s City Hall to join Henry Jenkins Junior and Betty Timid in legal matrimony,&quot; Judge Thompkins spoke with the witnesses of...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stacy Hillz,&quot; the first secretary spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vera Theropod,&quot; the second secretary then spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... I&#39;m John Harper... and this is Ginger O&#39;Toole, and &quot;Henry&quot; is the son of the man who owns the house where my older sister and her husband live, Jenny and Harry Jenkins,&quot; John spoke nervously, and thinking he was supposed to explain himself. As he&#39;d never been to a wedding not delivered by a preacher. &quot;We happened to be in the area and hoped to congratulate &quot;Henry&quot; and Betty and wish them well. They&#39;ve been very kind to me since my younger sister and I were transferred to my older sister&#39;s custody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it you have no objections?&quot; Judge Thompkins gave a chuckle and a small smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; John nodded.<br />
<br />
Judge Thompkins then turned to Huck and Betty, &quot;Now... marriage will see many legal obligations that will fulfill the bonds of love that should last a lifetime. And is nothing to be rushed into. And given the status at this time... Henry Jenkins Junior, did you use your status as a weredog to coerce Betty Timid into accepting any advances or the proposal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Huck answered, &quot;I love her dearly... and I would never force myself on her if she did not want the attention.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Betty Timid, do you recognize that as a normal human woman... any sexual contact with Henry Jenkins Junior will result in you becoming a weredog?&quot; Judge Thompkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Betty answered, &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it... to have and to hold... till death us do part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And will you both vow to honor these vows and love and cherish each other in a way that will honor and respect both parties?&quot; Judge Thompkins asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do,&quot; Huck and Betty said together and taking each other&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then by the powers invested in me by the State of Washington and the City of Moon Lake,&quot; Judge Thompkins pronounced, &quot;I hereby pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride.&quot;<br />
<br />
John could only watch and smile as Betty wrapped her arms around Huck&#39;s neck and kissed him. He was happy for both and hoped they would be happy together.</p>
