<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I wonder what the first change will be,” Valerie says.<br />
<br />
“I have no i…,” Jeff starts when he suddenly feels his cock twitch, quiver and slowly becomes erect, at the same time he also can feel his balls and sack start to grow.<br />
<br />
Seeing this causes Valerie to snort, then she bursts into laughter, “really? The first thing to change is your cock and balls?!”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s face is redder than a tomato, “I… it’s not MY fault,” he says, “I can’t control the transformations and choose what the first change will be!”<br />
<br />
Valerie grins, “now I know where the saying “hung like a Horse” comes from,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff doesn’t respond, the teen just stares down at his stiffening cock and growing sack, “feels weird, having an erection without feeling aroused,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Well, Stallions have sheaths,” Valerie says, “so I assume your cock is going to become the sheath while the head will become the actual cock”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods, “I can feel the head already changing,” he says, “god, it feels so weird!”<br />
<br />
The transforming boy then starts to slowly grow, his new genitals adjusting to his new size, next Jeff feels an itch starting all over his body as white fur sprouts from him. His short hair changes color from black to a beautiful, almost blinding, white as it takes on a mohawk style cut and grows down his neck, which seems to lengthen and thicken. Jeff gasps when suddenly a white tail, in the same blinding white, shoots from just above his back and starting to swish around, the boy looks back at the tail, “I… I can feel and even control it,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Well, duh,” Valerie says, “it is YOUR tail after all. You already look amazing! I love the white, it looks as if you are glowing! Although you look like some miscarriage or mutant, I must say you do already look pretty majestic”.<br />
<br />
“Majestic enough for a “queen”,” Jeff asks, he then starts to groan when his face pushes out into a muzzle, his teeth becoming large Equine teeth and his ears become pointy and move to the top of his head.<br />
<br />
Valerie grins, “so far,” she says, “I’d say “yes”. You look so big, strong and powerful!”<br />
<br />
Jeff opens his new mouth to respond but is only able to let out a neigh.<br />
<br />
Valerie smirks, “I guess there goes your voice,” she says, “don’t look so horrified, Jeff, Horses don’t talk!”<br />
<br />
Jeff narrows his eyes and lets out a snort as if to say, “oh really? I wouldn’t have guessed!”<br />
<br />
Valerie laughs, “and there go your hands,” she says.<br />
<br />
When Jeff looks down he realizes that his hands have become fists and have turned into white hooves with horseshoes nailed into them. The former boy suddenly lets out a surprised whiney when he feels himself falling forward and lets out a huff, which sounds like “humph”, as he catches himself with his front hooves. Looking back he notices what caused him to fall onto all fours, his legs have become digitigrade and his feet have become white hooves with horseshoes nailed into them.<br />
<br />
“Is it over,” Valerie asks.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods his head and lets out a neigh.<br />
<br />
Valerie opens the door to the stall and steps inside, “stay still, I want to have a good look at you,” she says.<br />
<br />
Jeff obeys and lets Valerie check him out, the former teen feels powerful and full of energy, he feels the urge to want to run, and that he could run for miles without getting tired.<br />
<br />
“What a majestic creature you have become,” Valerie says, “I truly love what I’m seeing! You are the most beautiful Horse in the whole universe”.<br />
<br />
Jeff can’t help but feel proud at Valerie’s comment.<br />
<br />
“Let me take a few pictures of you,” the girl then says, when Jeff tilts his head and looks at her questionably, she adds, “well, I assume you’d like to see how you look, and I want some pictures of MY Horse”.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods his head and stands still, what he is unaware of is that Valerie has opened the App and has scanned him, the girl smirks inwardly, ‘I’ll make a few changes when I leave, but he won’t notice since I’ll turn off his awareness, at least for the changes I’ll be doing to him’. Valerie then snaps a few pictures and shows them to Jeff, “so, what do you think?”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes widen when he sees the pictures of himself, he lets out a loud neigh and jumps a little.<br />
<br />
Valerie giggles, “I take that as you loving the way you look?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods his head.<br />
<br />
Valerie chuckles, “you seem to be full of energy,” she says, “would you like to do a few laps around the abandoned Ranch before I lock you up for the night?”<br />
<br />
Jeff again nods and neighs, so Valerie grabs a mouthpiece and leash off the wall and uses it to lead Jeff outside. Once out in the open, Valerie unhooks the leash from Jeff’s mouthpiece and gives the “Horse” a light smack, “off you go, Faith,” she says and with a loud neigh, Jeff bounds off, “damn! He’s fast,” the girl exclaims.<br />
<br />
Jeff gallops and gallops, ‘shit! I am fast as lightning,’ he thinks to himself, ‘this feels so freaking AMAZING!’<br />
<br />
After two or three hours, Jeff returns to Valerie, “well, tired yourself out enough?”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods his head, “then let me lead you back to your stall,” she says.<br />
<br />
When Jeff is back in his stall he walks straight for the water and food and without thinking he starts to drink and eat.<br />
<br />
Valerie smiles, “I’ll be going, Faith,” she says, “I’ll see you tomorrow. I’ll come around before school to fill up your food and water, and after school, I’ll ride you. Sounds good?”<br />
<br />
Jeff looks over at Valerie and snorts as he nods his head.<br />
<br />
Valerie smiles, “then, have a good night,” with that the girl exits the stables, grabbing Jeff’s belongings, his clothes and phone, stuffing them into the former teen’s school bag. Once she’s out the stables, she closes, bolts and locks the door, she then takes out her phone and opens the App, then opens “Faith’s” file, grinning evilly as she starts typing.<br />
<br />
The pink haired girl changes Jeff’s name to “Faith”, his gender to female, and makes sure “she” is fertile, she also changes the duration of two years to 22, which would cause Jeff/”Faith” to be a 26-year-old mare, since Jeff is currently a 4-year-old mare. Valerie grins evilly when she realizes that the changes she had programmed will cause Jeff to start desiring Stallion cocks. Satisfied she turns off Jeff’s awareness and confirms the change.<br />
<br />
Valerie smirks evilly, ‘hehe… I can’t wait to win many horse races with Faith,’ she thinks to herself as she walks away, ‘hehe… and mares who win get bred! Hehe… I think “Faith” will be a great mommy and birth lots of beautiful foals and fillies! Hehe… I even noticed that Jeff forgot to activate the reality alteration, that’ll mean, his family and everyone who knows him will either assume he has run away or is dead! Hehe… he’ll never know, because, once he’s back to normal, I’ll make him immediately transform into my little sister! Man… I LOVE being so evil! HAHAHA!’<br />
<br />
The girl’s mind is buzzing with evil ideas, what no one, not even her own family is aware off, Valerie has extreme mental issues, which started when she was six. The girl, for some unknown reason, started to develop the idea that everything in the world should belong to her, that every human being should bow before her. The day, when she run into Jeff when he was Cornelia, was, in her mind, the best day in her life: not only did she make Jeff have no choice but to obey her, thanks to the loser, she now owns her own “magic App”.<br />
<br />
Valerie decides to pay Jeff’s family a visit, after all, her “little sister”, once “she” is made, need’s a wardrobe filled with cute outfits.<br />
<br />
The girl opens the App, knowing that Jeff and Cornelia both have the App too, and not wanting to risk either one of them try anything, Valerie uses the App to make herself immune to any Chronivac-device.<br />
<br />
Valerie smirks evilly, ‘now no one will be able to stop me,’ she thinks to herself, ‘this world and the whole universe is MINE,’ then the girl gets an idea, ‘since I am the goddess, I better make myself immortal and unable to age,’ and that is exactly what she does.</p>
