<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Handsome, formerly Mark, could not have enjoyed his life more. Of course, it was not perfect, as being a father did mean more responsibilities, but being a satyr sure was great! Merlin had not lied to him. Of course he helped within his community, building huts when needed, gathering food, making alcoholic beverages and preparing banquets, but as children were raised mainly by the whole community, it was easier for all. The leader of the community, a large faun whose name was Winelust and very much respected by all because he was such an understanding and just person, was very happy that Handsome had stumbled upon their camp first. He had integrated so well! And he had produced a babe as cute as can be on his first try with a maenad. Never one to be jealous, Winelust was pleased at the result. In spite of constant enthusiasm at the fun to make children, the overall population had at best stagnated, more often even dwindled. So Handsome was a credit to his little community! He had fathered five other children after his first one and all were perfectly healthy and a joy to have around the village, just as any children. However, his first one, Aran, was a bit different. Not in a bad way, but with two parents as his were... Well, his five other siblings had turned out to be as fun-loving and merry-dancing as their party-loving parents. All had talents for dancing and cooking incredible banquets. It was too early to introduce them to full-blown drunkenness and the pleasures of love-making, of course. Aran was just,... different. With other qualities, no doubt. Also, Handsome seemed to fully realize that because he kept his first-born close and had developed a close connection with him. From the start he was very attentive to Aran. More than most fathers, who were still very caring, in their way. But nothing wrong with being a watchful father! Like everything, it had its own advantages for sure! After all, it allowed Aran&#39;s maenad mother to go on to see other males or lovers and have more fun while Handsome carried his baby everywhere and made sure he wanted for nothing.<br />
<br />
As he grew up, Aran had turned out to be a very shy little satyr. Actually, except for his tufty tail, tiny horns and goat ears, he looked very human. And his bleating as soon as he discovered his dear daddy was out of his sight. He loved nothing more than to snuggle in Handsome&#39;s arms and hide behind his goat legs when he was scared, which was very, very often. Amazingly, Handsome did not appear to be annoyed at this. On the contrary, for some reason he seemed to revel in his son&#39;s actions. But it did bot stop him from being a good friend and productive member of his community so these details were certainly unimportant. He was extremely patient with his little son. He encouraged him in what he liked doing. Oh yes, a most supportive father indeed! Aran in his early years, just as he could merely toddle around, loved music. He really wanted to be a musician and now, at the age of eight, he was listening assiduously to his teachers. Inventing new recipes for meals at banquets was another great passion of his. Already as a mere babe, suckled milk ravenously, from any mother&#39;s chest he could find or from bottles that he gulped, a sign of a good healthy appetite which showed in his taste for pies and cakes too. His little belly expanded but it was so cute. During communal baths, anyone could see his privates stayed very small but had not reached puberty yet. And why did it matter in the end? All satyrs knew that size was one thing, and technique was another, more important. And as the expression went: &quot;It&#39;s good to have a small key because it enters all locks.&quot; Aran was just a child, years and years from concerning himself with adult matters. And he showed such promises as a musician and cook! Everyone was liberated here, and free to be themselves. Handsome was very happy about his son&#39;s talents and interests. He obviously took much interest in his education and was elated each time Aran did something a bit different and not considered virile enough by ignorant humans. Aran was very shy and scared of his own shadow but it would fade away with time. Probably. But it was not important if the child developed other gifts and talents. It would compensate any so-called flaws, like for anyone. His father in person did not care in the slightest. Well! It was extremely pleasant to see such a supportive father who loved and looked over his progeny so much. A more than decent addition to his community indeed, in more ways than one! Winelust could not wait to see the adult Aran would grow up to be and he was certain Handsome felt the same. The leader of the satyr community could not imagine how right he was...</p>
