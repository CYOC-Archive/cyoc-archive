<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Twenty-Two year old Mitch Zanden slumped back in his chair, waiting for the hellish quarter to be over.  His friend, Karissa, had talked him once again into going to the opera last night and even now he regretted it.  It had been his hope that spending the afternoon with his friends watching the big game would make up for any strange encounters with wizard actors he had experienced the night before.  Instead, the group moaned and groaned as their state team fell further and further behind… and as the game goes, so does the party.</p>

<hr>

<p>Giant TV or not, the game going so bad meant the party wasn't going well… and because of that, Mitch had received more than his share of friendly gibes.  It didn't help that as he was carrying a giant tub of popcorn into the living room when a pain shot through his ass with such force that he stumbled and landed on the floor, flinging half the bowel up into the air.  There was an immediate uproar of laughter at Mitch's expense, but still a few jeers related to the buttery popcorn that was now over the floor instead of prepared for his friend's bellies.</p>

<p>"Oh God," Mitch squealed to himself like he'd been kicked in the crotch as he grabbed his groin and rushed down the hallway towards the bathroom.  More laughter chased him then, but he cared not.  There was a rushing pain that felt like a dripping water sensation back behind his penis to a point lower inside his body.  At each moment the 'drip' touched his flesh below his balls, there was another bleeding feeling of pain outward.  Slamming the door behind him, he reached up to lock the it and just barely did so before I felt like he had to drop an oversized brick.</p>

<p>Pulling himself up off the floor, his hands trembled as he tried to get his belt undone quickly.  Pulling it apart, and his pants, his zipper undid itself as he had yanked so hard the button on his pants ripped off and shot into the air.  He pulled down his underwear and sat back onto the toilet, letting out a whimper as the same pain continued up right under his balls.  Straining over the john, he reached forward to hold onto the countertop to the sink in front of him as he tried to push out whatever was trying to crawl out of his ass.</p>

<p>"Dude, are you OK!?" came the voice of Kevin with a knock at the door.  Mitch's reply came as pained yell as he forced something long and hard out his backside.  "Shit, man.  This ain't funny," he said as part of Mitch's brain realized that nothing was coming out his <i>asshole</i>… no! There was something being pushed out his <i>tailbone!</i>  Quickly he jerked his head to the side, sweat beading off his face, as he could see something that looked like a little furry animal curling around from his backside.  It was white and orange and brown and seemed to figget as he strained to push again through the pain.  "Do we need to call a doctor!?" came the voice again.</p>

<p>"Maybe!" was all Mitch could quickly yell out in pain, unwilling to give at even this moment a 'yes' as a sign of additional weakness to his jock friends.  He could almost taste the sweat sliding off his face, and the red hot pain that seemed centered behind his balls as he slowly began to whimper.  A moment later, he could feel what must have felt the last push out his backside… and the relief of <i>that</i> realization was followed by a happy wagging of his new collie tail.</p>

<p>Pain between his legs or not, Mitch's eyes went wide as he quickly looked back at the 'little furry animal' that was now a full-sized dog tail.  It was long enough to reach the backs of his knees and was thick with long orange, white, and brown fur.  A mild, startled yelp from this realization came as Mitch <i>tried</i> to move it and <i>succeeded</i>… its ease of use was like a new arm he'd always had.</p>

<p>Enough moments had gone by that Mitch was crying softly to himself on the can but no longer straining… and the burning pain he felt seemed to reached up from behind his balls to his asshole and under to his new tail.  Biting his lip in fear of what he might find, Mitch reached down his front to lift his testicles up and feel what was behind them.  What he found was hair that hadn't been there, piled on top of two fleshly lumps.  Without making the connection at first, he reached his fingers towards and in between those new lips and into his newly formed canine vagina.</p>

<p>A quick yip of surprised as Mitch's fingers exited there and he felt back between his legs.  He now had a dog's tail, asshole (and the scent glands there of), fur up under his legs, and a new doggie vulva up under his still human nutsack.  The pain lingered quietly away by now, but made itself known up inside of the area behind his crotch as changes unseeable to him occurred.  He grew in a bitch's womb, and felt a slight tingling behind the skin of his belly.  Quickly grabbing up his shirt to peak under it, he now watched as his decently defined abs each sprouted a single small nipple to them, all aligned with his human upper two but each looking like a dog's teat instead.  No fur, he was glad, but still freakishly inhuman an unnatural.</p>

<p>"Dude, that kid finally came back with your dog," came the voice of one of Mitch's other buddies from the living room.  <i>Reginald</i>, Mitch realized, but then felt an unfamiliar warmth and need within his body and centering in his new organs.  <i>I feel this for him…?  Why?</i>, he asked himself, fearing the answer.  Tom continued: "Says the leash is broke, and sorry for being back late.  What'll we tell him?"</p></p>
