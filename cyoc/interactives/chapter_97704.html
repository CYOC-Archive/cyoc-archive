<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey Matt&quot; I said, &quot;I hear you&#39;re looking for a second job.&quot; Of course I used an amulet to cause Matt to take everything I said as fact even though he wasn&#39;t looking for a job.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, it&#39;s been hard trying to find a job that works with my schedule.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I just got word today the SRU is hiring. They&#39;re looking for a living mannequin. Didn&#39;t you work as a living mannequin two years ago?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, It was the worst job I ever had. That&#39;s why I quit. I never want to do that again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;d do it again because you want the extra income.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, of course. Besides, it was a nice job not having to do anything except stand around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, come down to SRU with me tomorrow and we&#39;ll get you set up.&quot;<br />
<br />
I had arranged this with my boss, Henry. He was going to get a little pleasure playing with Matt too.<br />
<br />
Matt asked Henry, &quot;So I assume I&#39;ll pose for twenty minutes at a time with breaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Matt, since you&#39;ve already signed the papers, I can tell you that we do things differently here. We use magic&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry and I agreed that it would be funner to let Matt in on the secret of magic for the time being. We can make him forget about it again later.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic, you&#39;re kidding me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. As we&#39;re speaking, the potion we slipped in the cola we offered you should be taking effect. Do you want to reach into your pants to confirm that I&#39;m telling the truth?&quot;<br />
<br />
The look on Matt&#39;s face was priceless. I&#39;m sure he felt something and realized that he was changing. It took a moment before his fear of transformation overcame his modesty and then he reached down his pants and forgot all about modesty. In panic, he stripped off his pant showing both of us a good look at his smooth groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to my dick. You erased it. What are you doing to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
He was about to fight or flight so I used a calming amulet. &quot;Easy there, It&#39;s just part of the job. During working hours, you&#39;ll be a living mannequin and then you&#39;ll return to normal when your shift is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
That worked too well. I was hoping Matt would continue to protest but he accepted that it was just part of the job. He also agreed that as a mannequin, it was okay for him to be seen naked so he stripped off his clothes and we put them on a shelf. Although he was smooth, we did set the potion to accentuate his bulges. His butt looked amazing. I reached in to check and discovered he had no hole but other than that, he had the ass of a porn star.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey hands off.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry buddy but we have to touch you. You enjoy it don&#39;t you?&quot; I didn&#39;t use an amulet this time.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I don&#39;t want to be touched.&quot;<br />
<br />
I continued to touch him. One of the things I enjoyed about Matt was that, no matter how loudly he protested to being touched, he never did anything to stop it. His body said yes even though his lips said no. I did use potions to keep him responding that way or he would have eventually either given up and stopped protesting or he would have mustered the courage to do something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t&quot; We led him to the storefront where we wanted him to pose. I continued to play with his ass the whole way. &quot;It&#39;s bad enough that I&#39;m naked. Do you have to play with my ass in front of customers?&quot;<br />
<br />
The potion continued to make him look more and more like a mannequin, a very hot, sexy and realistic mannequin but still a mannequin. He even developed joints so we could separate his arms and legs if we wanted.<br />
<br />
We got him dressed finally so that we could fool customers into thinking he was a real mannequin and Matt stood perfectly still. He fooled everyone into thinking he was just a mannequin except that periodically Henry or I would grope his crotch and he&#39;d complain shocking the customers who would then laugh.<br />
<br />
That was fun but the real fun was for after work. When Matt&#39;s shift ended and he returned to normal, or at least he thought he returned to normal, he walked into office where his clothes were and started to get dressed. Henry and I stopped him for a moment.<br />
<br />
Matt looked like a normal human being again so in a way, we had told him the truth. Then Henry reached down and took his cock and balls off leaving his groin smooth. &quot;See there, you got your cock and balls back again just like normal. See, I&#39;m holding them in my hand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha, ha, very funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I slipped an amulet in Matt&#39;s ass to help us continue the fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, give me back my genitals.&quot;<br />
<br />
I used an amulet. &quot;Sorry but it is best this way. For as long as you continue working as a living mannequin, you&#39;ll find it easier to stay partially transformed. In fact, why don&#39;t you drink a tiny bit more potion now so your body can get used to being smooth.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt agreed but this potion was a little different. We let him keep his asshole and he still looked human but other than that, he was as smooth as a mannequin. Then we let Matt finish getting dressed.<br />
<br />
Just as we were leaving, Henry started stroking the cock souvenir he took from Matt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t play with my cock sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
Henry didn&#39;t stop and we knew that Matt could feel it. Matt and I left and sure enough, after some time Matt had an orgasm right there in the passenger seat of the car. He tried to pretend like nothing was happening.<br />
<br />
We got home and no one was around yet so I decided to have more fun. I convinced Matt to strip naked and stay naked but in his mind, he thought he was dressed. I also set up some trigger words that whenever Matt heard me say, he would strike a pose and hold perfectly still until I released him. One pose was to have him bend over and spread his ass cheeks.</p>
