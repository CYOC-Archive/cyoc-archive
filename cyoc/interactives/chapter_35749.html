<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Curiosity had always been part of who Jamie was. He knew that part of this park's vacation package was about stepping out of an old life and stepping into another; even if it was for a short time.<br />
<br />
Weighing the options carefully, he chose to ignore the Therianthropic door and moved toward the door marked female. Pushing the door open, he stepped inside and peered around at room he had just entered. It was exactly like the last room, except there was a table in the center and three more doors to choose from.<br />
<br />
Walking up to the table, he saw that there was a pile of clothes on the table, a pink and blue pill and a note.<br />
<br />
Opening the note, he read: Thank you for choosing the female door. If you are a male, please put on the clothes and take the pill presented before you. If you are a female, you make skip the pill. Afterward, you may choose one of the doors. Don't forget to pick up your luggage on the way through.<br />
<br />
Pausing, he looked up and noticed that the doors read Log Cabin, Farm House with Animals, Farm House with No Animals and Mansion. Between the two doors leading to Log Cabin and Farm House Animals, Jamie saw a girls purple, pink and white backpack.<br />
<br />
Looking down at the note, he continued to read: A person may request that they remain in the form they have chosen. In order to that, they fill out form nineteen dash B and pass a test stating they can survive in the form. Therianthropic will live from that day forth in the park. Others have the option of continuing to live in the park or returning to their old lives in the new form. Warning to all men who assume the female form; you will menstruate. You can find the appropriate sanitary napkins in your luggage. You also run the risk of becoming pregnant if you so chose to engage in sexual activities.<br />
<br />
Wondering about how serious this all was, Jamie shrugged, folded up the note and crossed the room. Picking up the backpack, he found a zipper in front, undid it and placed the note inside. Zipping it back up, he carried the backpack to the table and set it down next to the pile of clothes.<br />
<br />
Next he stripped down, having never really been ashamed of his naked body, and picked up the clothes.<br />
<br />
They consisted of a pair of tight black shorts that went down to his knees, a pair of white tennis shoes with purple and pink shoe laces that had white hearts on them and a white t-shirt that read 'Princess'.<br />
<br />
Pulling on the shorts, he noticed that they were tight, especially around his private region, which left a bulge in the front of the shorts. Next was the shirt, which he just barely got on. He didn't even want to try the shoes, seeing as they were size three and he wore a size nine.<br />
<br />
Taking the pill, he dry swallowed it. The moment he had taken it, the secretary walked back in and not even acknowledging his presence, set a glass of what appeared to be strawberry milk down on the table and left.<br />
<br />
Picking up the glass, he sniffed at it. Noting that it smelled like strawberry milk and these people were probably not into poisoning guests, he drank it down; finding it to not taste like strawberry milk, but something sweeter.<br />
<br />
The moment it came in contact with his stomach, he doubled over in pain. A strange tingling sensation went through his feet, up his legs, across his groin, then his abdomen and chest, down his arms and up his neck. As it passed through his head, he just happened to glance at his arms and noticed the muscle mass slowly vanishing, the hair on his arms receding and his hands becoming more slender and petite.<br />
<br />
The whole experience lasted for a couple of minutes and when he found he could stand again, Jamie noticed that it wasn't just his arms that had changed.<br />
<br />
The bulge from his shorts was gone and the shorts were bigger. Grasping the tie, he tied it before his shorts fell down. His shirt was larger and when he looked down it, he saw two pert B cup breast brushing up against the smooth cotton fabric. Something in his mind that he was now about fifteen years old.<br />
<br />
But he had no time to think on this as he noticed his waist, hips and butt had also underwent a change and now resembled something more feminine.<br />
<br />
From there he saw that his legs were now slightly longer, hairless and also feminine in appearance. Gazing down at his feet he noticed that they were smaller and would now fit in the shoes.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the floor, briefly noting the strange sensation of the shorts brushing against his vulva and shaved crotch, which brought about a feeling he had never experienced before, seeing as he had never been a girl, he thought as he tied his shoes, &quot;Guess I'll have to think of myself as a she for the next three months.&quot;<br />
<br />
Standing, she felt a tickling at her neck. Reaching around, she pulled a strand of shoulder length dark red hair around. Gazing at it, Jamie was amazed at the fact that her hair had changed colour. Walking over to the table, she reached out to pick up the backpack. <br />
<br />
Jamie stopped as she noticed that she was shorter. Glancing down, she figured her height was now about five foot one. The other thing that came to her attention was that the backpack weighed more. Figuring it was due to the fact that her masculine muscle mass was gone. Shrugging, Jamie walked toward the doors.</p>
