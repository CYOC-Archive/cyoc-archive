<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex considers Poundcake’s idea of staying like this longer and having more fun as an animal. Besides, it would be nice not to have to worry about school. With his perfect attendance, he deserved a vacation anyways. Before he could respond, the door to his room abruptly swung open and his slightly older sister, Molly, strode inside. “Alex? I thought I heard you talking to someone. Do you have a friend over or something?” His sister’s form was absolutely titanic from his new perspective! She was like a skyscraper as she scanned the room from side to side looking for him, but to no avail, and crossed her arms pointedly. “Alex? Are you gonna jump out and scare me again? I’ll kick your ass again if you do. It’s not funny.” Eventually her gaze settled on the black cat perched studiously on his desk next to the abandoned homework as if he was waiting for her attention anyways. Molly has always considered herself more of a cat person, but there was something off about her brother’s cat since he brought it home. There was something especially judgmental about the way it looked at you and met your gaze. It was just creepy. But now, the cat bobbed its head at attention cutely, tail swaying, and inviting her over with a, “Mrrr~?” <br />
“Oh what the hell.” She said to herself, approaching the feline with a hand outstretched to strike its inky black fur. But just as her hand was about to make contact, a white mouse jumped out from under the cat! “AAAAAAHHH!!” She screamed, scrambling backwards to get away from the rodent, inevitably tripping over herself and crashing to the floor like a giant redwood tree. Poundcake jumped down and over to her, rubbing against her side and head butting her affectionately, but impeding her ability to clamber back to her feet. “I thought you were supposed to catch and EAT the mice! Not PLAY with them!” She shouted at the cat as it doted on her. That’s when her head began the spin, and the world around her quickly exploded, then grew dark in a flash as if Alex had tossed a blanket on her from behind. She could not have been more wrong, as she found herself walking out of the sleeve of her shirt on four tiny pink mouse paws, a feline of epic proportions looming over her new form. Her heart raced as she attempted to spin around and dart away, but she was too clumsy, scrabbling in place on the floor until the warm, wet, maw of the cat came down on her and… and…. Lifted her up tenderly, like a newborn kitten? She felt like flying as the cat leaped up onto the desk with her and gently set her down. She was frozen, like a deer in the headlights, still processing her near death experience and transformation. The other mouse approached her excitedly, squeaking joyfully. The gears in her new small head were turning, until something clicked into place, and suddenly the squeaks turned to plain English mid sentence. “-and you’ll never believe what else Poundcake can do!! Molly? Molly…? Are you okay?” The other mouse walked in circles around her new form, inspecting her and waving a paw in front of her now beady eyes as she stood still as a statue, save for her rapid breathing and heart palpitations. Eventually she recognized the voice of the other mouse was familiar. She blinked a couple times and shook her head, ears flapping. “…Alex…?” Molly questioned, meeting her brother’s eye contact. Alex sprung up and embraced her. “Oh good, you are okay! I know this is probably a little strange. But you’ll get used to it in no time!” He chirped at her, bouncing back, pink swishing excitedly. “How am I supposed to get used to being a MOUSE?! I HATE mice! And how did this happen anyways? Why are we mice? Did you do this to me?” She interrogated harshly, taking a small rage-filled step closer to her brother. His big pink ears swiveled backwards sheepishly. “N-no, no! I didn’t do this to you. It was the cat! The cat is magic or something!!” As if on cue, Poundcake lowered his head gracefully to the two arguing mice. “Hello.” Poundcake greeted coyly. “It can talk?!” Molly exclaimed. “Sure, the talking cat is the weird part about this. Can you just chill out so we can…” Alex trailed off, bobbing his head in short bursts, sniffing the air, tasting it almost. It smelled sweet, but sort of oaky… a little musky. His eyes sort of glazed over as he examined the smell, as if to let his feral mouse brain take the wheel as he quested for the source of the smell. “Alex, what’s your damage? What are you do- OH!” Suddenly his pointy pink nose collided with her neck as he huffed her fur, chittering wildly. “Better watch out little mouse, male mice aren’t known for their abstinence.” Poundcake purred, crossing his paws as he lay down to watch the inevitable unfold. Alex felt drunk, groggy even, and felt like a spectator as his body inspected his sister’s mouse form, nose trailing lower, and lower, until… he was met with resistance as a small paw deflected his nose’s path. “Hey! Cut it out, Alex. You’re still my- UNFF!” She ground her new buck-teeth as she was tackled by her brother. He wasn’t listening. He was a wild animal now, a slave to his instincts. She continued to struggle back until her nose twitched. Her whiskers vibrating as she picked up a smell. Like cologne, in a weird way. Woody. Spicy. Salty. Soft. Warm. The warmth… she was intoxicated by the smell and felt a growing warmth between her legs and up and down her abdomen. She didn’t notice how many sensitive pink nipples she had until just now as they brushed the cold surface below her, and they quickly became firm and pert. She reached a paw down to stroke them and see how real they were, electric waves pulsing through her body. Just then, she felt a hot tongue probe at her rear, her ropy tail hiking up in response to allow access to her mate. Alex the mouse drunkenly lapped at her tiny, hot sex with his tiny maw, both of their senses in primal overdrive as their murine bodies acted without control, the siblings only passengers to the ride they were about to experience. Molly’s back arched, her breathing becoming quick and deep as the tongue lapped and probed her furred sex, teasing her birth canal, causing the floodgates to open. Her legs splayed, and she looked like a tiny bearskin rug. Poundcake craned his neck forward to nudge Alex to the next stage of courtship, his maw now matted with the sticky sweet fluids of his mate. He stumbled forward, his tiny tapered hot rod sliding out of his fluffy sheath and quickly gaining mass, his massive pink balls painfully tight, desperate for release. Molly was screaming internally, not wanting to mate with her brother, but the mouse part of her was telling her to embrace it, to swell heavy with his litter, to pass on their genes. Alex’s tiny paws grasped her plump sides and he clumsily probed for her entrance. After a few missed jabs, his hot poker met his target and Molly squealed helplessly as it sank deep. Alex immediately began jackhammering away, his plump mouse  balls plapping wetly against her rear like giant water balloons. As he pounded away, Poundcake lowered his head and began licking Alex’s back sensually, sending him to nirvana as the giant cat’s tongue pushed him closer to his sister’s warm little body with each lap. Molly’s body rocked in tune with Alex’s, her rear rising to meet him, pressing into his groin. She couldn’t wait to meet their children. She wanted this… no, needed this. Her body was begging for release, to be filled to the breaking point with hot mouse spunk until she looked like a fuzzy ping pong ball on four legs. Her tight walls clamped and pulsed around Alex’s prick, massaging him in ways Poundcake’s urethra couldn’t. This was pure ecstasy. Fireworks went off as he reached a crescendo, his rhythmic humping coming to an abrupt stop as he finally felt his balls tighten and squeeze load after load into the waiting reservoir below him, ensuring a pregnancy as his sperm gushed into Molly’s womb, racing to each egg. Molly saw stars as Alex jetted inside her, painting her white, sending her over the edge. Their exhausted bodies lay like that for what seemed to be an eternity, Alex’s little prick occasionally pulsing inside her and dumping more of his load in. Molly could practically feel the sloshing inside her. Her tears were all swollen and red as they grazed the wood grain of the table. She couldn’t wait only imagine how many little mouths would be suckling from her soon as she nourished and cared for them. The fog in Alex’s mind lifted first as he began to realize the severity of his actions. Did he just… did they just… did he just knock up his sister…?</p>
