<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(minor error in last chapter:  wrote riley instead of Kylie at the end)<br />
<br />
Then as she was scheming all sorts of diversions and manipulations, she realized(with the virus&#39;s help) that there was one very simple solution:  She could change them after all.  She wouldn&#39;t turn them into bimbos mind you, or even into women, but with her ability to reconfigure the virus she could change them into anything.  She could make them into super stud male versions of herself, and then when they too had this incredible need for sex, they&#39;d understand, and they wouldn&#39;t stand in her way.  In fact they&#39;d all probably oblige her themselves.   All she had too do was get them alone one at a time...<br />
<br />
She went after Ryan, the guard, first.  He was likely in the watchtower, looking down on the rest of the camp.  That made him nice and isolated, and while up there she&#39;d have a bird&#39;s eye view to know when they were truly alone.<br />
<br />
Minutes later, Ryan heard a cute voice from behind him.  &quot;Hey Mr. Withers, mind if I join you?&quot;  He looked around to see the adorable blossoming young teen beaming at him.  She had her hands clasped behind her back as she leaned in with a big smile.  It was a decidedly feminine pose, and strange to see it so naturally adapted by someone who&#39;d been a boy a short time ago.   The look in her eyes was innocent enough, but as she leaned in she ended up giving him a view of her cleavage.  He frowned, and pushed THAT thought aside; she was far too young, though he found it more difficult to banish the thought than he should of, and did he smell something funny?  &quot;Kyle? or, uh, Kylie I guess?   Look I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a good idea.  Isn&#39;t it past your bedtime anyway?&quot;  <br />
<br />
Suddenly she turned the puppy dog eyes on full force.  &quot;Please?  I can&#39;t sleep.  It&#39;s just been, well, a crazy day, and I don&#39;t want to be alone right now.&quot;  Ryan looked at that adorable face and found it impossible to resist.  Of course, that was in part due to the pheromones she was putting out, though he didn&#39;t know it.<br />
<br />
  He sighed.  &quot;Alright kid, get over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yay!&quot; she said with a giggle as she practically bounced over and gave him a little hug.  Ryan blushed as he felt her new breasts pressed up against him.  Why was he thinking this way about a kid though? But he couldn&#39;t seem to help it...  &quot;So what&#39;s it like up here every day?  pretty boring I guess?&quot; she asked as she released him and looked down at the camp, perhaps a little too intently.  She seemed to have no sense of personal boundaries though, and kept bumping or leaning into him.  Trying to get away from her Ryan sat down in his chair, but to his surprise she just planted her barely clad bottom in his lap with another giggle.  &quot;Mind if I sit here?&quot; she asked  &quot;There&#39;s no other chairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah...um...ah&quot; Was all Ryan could say.  The feeling of her perfect little butt pressing into his groin was too much, and it didn&#39;t help that she wouldn&#39;t sit still, so he was struggling not to get an erection.  &quot;Kylie I&#39;d rather you didn&#39;t..&quot;<br />
<br />
The puppy dog eyes came back.  &quot;Aw come on.  It&#39;s not hurting anything.  I&#39;ll be a good girl, I promise.&quot;  The teasing way she&#39;d said THAT had sounded way too adult, but while Ryan SHOULD have been alarmed by it he just became more turned on.  Despite devoting every ounce of willpower to resisting it, he was soon poking her in her cute little behind with his manhood.  He turned beet red at the sensation.  Kylie smiled.  She had him now.  The pheromones were doing their work well, and what little resistance he had left would soon be washed away.  &quot;Well, I must be being a REALLY good girl.&quot; she said as she looked up at him with a seductive smile.  <br />
<br />
As it became at last undeniable that she was trying to seduce him, Ryan&#39;s last bit of willpower reasserted himself.  &quot;Kylie, this isn&#39;t right.&quot; He said as he tried to push her off, but she was surprisingly strong...<br />
<br />
&quot;mmm feels right to me.&quot;  she purred, herself becoming caught up in the passion as she grinded her ass into the second penis she&#39;d ever encountered with glee.  &quot;mmm you&#39;re a lot bigger than Nick.  Guess that&#39;s the difference between a boy and a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned in pleasure, pleasure heightened by pheromones so much that it took every ounce of will he had not to come right there.  &quot;Kylie...&quot;   he muttered, but it wasn&#39;t so much a protest as it was sheer passion at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss me.&quot;  She commanded as she looked up at him, and Ryan gave in completely.  He locked lips with her in a few moments of utter bliss as her hands snaked up into his hair, but then she grasped him firmly by the head and refused to let go.  His eyes widened as pink goop fired right down his throat, and she held him there with superhuman strength until he was forced to swallow.  She kept their lips locked afterwards, not wanting him to scream for help, and Ryan began to change.  The beginning signs of middle age fell from his body as perfect youth was restored.  His facial features grew chiseled and perfectly masculine, giving him the visage of a greek god.  Soon the body of one followed, as rippling muscle covered his body and he grew to nearly seven foot.  He was far stronger than her now, but as he changed his desire only increased, so that with a roar he took command and lifted her into the air with one hand.  With the other superhumanly deft hand he tore her skimpy shorts from her body, and she squealed in delight as the cool night air hit her dripping pussy and her juices decorated his now foot long cock.  She&#39;d won, and she&#39;d have what she wanted now.</p>
