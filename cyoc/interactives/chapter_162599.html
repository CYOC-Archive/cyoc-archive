<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have something here, a letter as written by a young man, it was from Daniel writing to his parents about becoming a pony stallion. Hear this please,&quot; The Professor said to Jen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, lets hear what he had to say, as maybe I could write to my mother,&quot; Jen replied, as she was wondering how to explain her situation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daniel wrote, Dear Mom & Dad,<br />
<br />
It&#39;s been a real drag here at the university. The people are all in clicks and the professors are even worse. <br />
<br />
I had great plans of doing as Dad wanted for me to become a teacher, but my hopes were dashed by the English Lit Prof. He&#39;s the world&#39;s biggest ego trip jerk! <br />
<br />
He wants those not in frat houses to brown nose him at every turn, expecting free Beaner coffees given to him before the start of a class.<br />
<br />
Although my grades are still acceptable, I thought of looking around at some part time jobs. The pay scale offered is mostly lousy and even worse the schedule the restaurant owners expect. As by chance I saw a note posted at the student union.<br />
<br />
A Professor Haun offered to hire paid volunteers for his Gene therapy experiments. The whole thing sounded like some evil plot from an old 1950‘s &quot;B&quot; movie, but I called and applied. Upon my first interview the Professor and his assistant asked me dozens of questions about my family background. I soon could tell where the conversations were going. The two of them were worried of complications and wanted understudies&#39; who had either no next of kin or were foreign exchange students.<br />
<br />
I told them a long story about being brought up in as an orphan. My story almost made the interviewing assistant cry. After the interview I was sent a contract and my first check of one thousand dollars, really!<br />
<br />
It was a Thursday afternoon when I went to the Laboratory for my physical. I don&#39;t have classes on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays, what tended to thrill the Professor, allowing then of their testing could be more intense and allow me time to rest after each episode.<br />
<br />
It was odd how things worked out as one of the questions asked made me to think back when we still owned Grandpa&#39;s farm. As I remembered the animals, the horses, ponies, cows, and the bull. Professor Haun thought I was the perfect volunteer, as he made an offer I, could not refuse. <br />
<br />
I was asked to join the science project, as a long term test subject, and to continue my studies, as arranged by the Professor with my other college professors, as the assignment were brought to me at the Lab. No class work and boring pointless lectures, and better yet I increased by wage to $3,000 per month.<br />
<br />
The special test was named, Homo-Equinus-Dartmoor. I was told that the gene-therapy originated if England, sent from the Dartmoor Society. The basic idea was to marry young human male cells with those of a Dartmoor equine. The resulting culture would then be processed by the Professor&#39;s D.N.A. splicing theory. A final serum he expected to generate, which when injected would give an animal embryo the genes gifting the foal more mental ability.<br />
<br />
I feel proud to be a part in this experiment and all was going very well until this past week. <br />
<br />
James Hullen, the assistant was doing two injections of my Antibiotic drug when the professor noted that one of the syringes got drawn from the wrong vial, and was filled with the H.E.D. serum. I was suddenly thrown into a type of drug shock and passed out. <br />
<br />
When I came out of my coma like sleep after five weeks as during the Professor had me moved to a swing room where Nurses, pretty ones, kept watch over me until all my readings became as stablized?<br />
<br />
The Professor came to check on me several times each day, he checking my vitals and then oddly, he began to measuring my toes, feet, and shins. I lay around for several days after that as felt really fine.<br />
<br />
It was on the Tuesday of the second week since I revived, as it was noted that my skin looked very tan. Each day after that my skin color darkened one shade, until by the end of that week even my skin texture was showing as changing.<br />
<br />
I asked the Professor but was ignored as he would change the subject. I knew then that the injection was making some changes and the Prof. didn&#39;t either know what to expect, or was looking forward to whatever might happen.<br />
<br />
I was moved from the swing room to a room without windows, and no visitors, except Prof. Haun and another man named Justin. My first day in that room noted no mirror on any wall. The bathroom mirror had been removed as well. While my skin color continued to change, becoming as darker; and after another week all my skin became as a deep black and felt thicker. I had no shaver but my whiskers which Dad says is peach fuzz began growing at a very fast rate. Some of the hairs grew out three inches. The long ones felt like almost feeler hairs what Grandpa&#39;s horse Buster had, do you remember?<br />
<br />
It was a bad morning when I woke up one morning, and discovered my eyes were covered with thick gauze and also my hands and arms. I was strapped to the bed, a cathode jammed up my pecker, and another sort of suck pipe up my butt.<br />
<br />
Justin told me it was due to a drug interaction and that for a day or two, I needed to lay quiet. I was stuck, couldn&#39;t move, and they did not want me to walk around or even feel my face. The following Sunday when most of the staff was off for the day, that the Professor Haun and Justin came to release my bonds. The result of their visit is why I&#39;m writing you this note of explanation.<br />
<br />
During my many days while stuck in bed I experienced such leg cramps that I know I screamed. My back ached and even my groin felt weighty, as if swollen. Hands and arms seemed strange and worse of all my sense of smell and hearing became so acute, it hurt when the Prof and Justin would speak.<br />
<br />
They insisted I lay very still as the gauze was removed and straps were let loose. Doing as told I waited for a chance to sit up and or stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, sit up and remain calm,&quot; said Professor Haun!<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes to what had to be the most terror filled moment of my entire life. Like when you about to die, my whole life&#39;s memories poured out in a flood of emotion. I saw first my legs, they were very dark, actually black! <br />
<br />
My toes are gone, well changed, as had merged into a single solid toe. Hair, black in color grew out of my feet and they are very much longer than my size 13&#39;s. My shin and upper leg now look more like the hunched legs of Grandpa&#39;s horse, being that different for when I walked in here some months back.<br />
<br />
Please Mom don&#39;t cry, I&#39;m told this isn&#39;t permanent. I was even more afraid when I saw a four foot long hair tail hanging over the bedside. My butt is very much that of what Buster had, but smaller. My maleness has changed to look every bit like that of a pony stallion. A leathery sheath has attached to my lower abdomen reminds me of Buster&#39;s, only smaller. My testicles have increased to be those of a full grown male pony. <br />
<br />
I feel bad or sorry but Doctor Michaels circumcision done to me is all gone, and the end of my pecker is flat like a horse has!<br />
<br />
The skin or hide as the Professor calls it is a dark saddle brown my hair covers my back and chest up to my neck and all over my head. The tail and my mane is long flowing and jet black. My shoulders are still my own in form as though my neck in much thicker, and becoming daily more like that of what Justin told me was as a Dartmoor pony; as all caused by the serum which was injected by accident.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m sorry to report as this letter must be very long, but in waking today my head is now changing along with those boyish shoulders. I see my toe-hoofs have grown bigger on each foot. My fingers are doing what my toes did and I expect by the time you read this letter, I&#39;ll need to be standing on all fours.<br />
<br />
I asked Justin to finish the writing of this letter, and he enclosed the signed contract, and including of a large bonus check from the Professor to cover any future expenses of my required boarding. <br />
<br />
He says you can keep the money if now due to this, my situation that you don&#39;t want me to ever come home; as I would understand not wanting me back. <br />
<br />
If so, and because I have as physically become a pony, he, the Professor is prepared to ship me to joining the Dartmoor society, me permanently as a pony stallion, and used for Stud at a Devon, England breeding farm. <br />
<br />
I know it might be difficult, but please let me go to England, I do want to stay as I am, please!<br />
<br />
Yours still in heart,<br />
<br />
Daniel<br />
Now that was a heart warming letter, and since then much has happened to elate Daniel, he became a willing stud!&quot;</p>
