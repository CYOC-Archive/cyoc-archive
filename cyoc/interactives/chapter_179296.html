<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the doorbell rang Melissa and Robert walked their daughters over to the door to let Jenny look through the peephole.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who is it?&quot; Mary asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Mrs. Garcia!&quot; Jenny announced to the household<br />
<br />
&quot;Tatiana? She must be wondering where I am. Let me handle her ok?&quot; Gabriel asked.<br />
<br />
The conjoined family members made way for Gabriel, allowing her access to the door as the visitor continued to ring the doorbell. The dragoness swung the door open. Before Tatiana could react to the sight that lay in front of her, Gabriel turned and wrapped her tail around Tatiana&#39;s waist and pulled her inside. Robert and Melissa lunged towards the door and Mary closed it, preventing Tatiana&#39;s screams from drawing attention outside.<br />
<br />
Tatiana was struck speechless when she saw what had become of four-fifths of the family, she was having trouble even comprehending what the creature was. Before she could get her thoughts in line and start screaming again, the dragoness that was holding Tatiana turned towards her or as towards her as possible while still holding her with its tail.<br />
<br />
“Honey its me, Gabriel. I know that might be hard to believe, but I&#39;m willing to give you any information only I would know to prove my identity”<br />
<br />
Tatiana looked into Gabriel&#39;s eyes and her expression softened, despite the fact that Gabriel&#39;s face was completely different, in fact it wasn&#39;t even human anymore, she could still see the person she married in the dragoness&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
“No, I believe you already, I have no doubts that you&#39;re my Gabriel, just explain to me how you, and everyone else for that matter, got transformed.”<br />
<br />
Gabriel then released Tatiana from her tail and everyone sat down together as the dragonesses explained what had happened with the candies once again.<br />
<br />
“When you changed, did it hurt?” Tatiana asked once the explanation had concluded<br />
<br />
“Just the opposite, it was one of the greatest sensations I&#39;ve ever felt!” Gabriel proclaimed<br />
<br />
Tatiana began to think, the implicit offer to join her partner by eating one of the candies was there, but the woman had reservations about losing her humanity. She glanced over at the four-fold conjoined dragoness, particularly at Jenny, who still had a human body despite the fact that she was fused with her parents and sister. According to their story, that was caused by someone else eating one of the black candies before touching someone.<br />
<br />
“Jenny, how does it feel to be fused like that?” Tatiana addressed the dragon-taur&#39;s living figurehead<br />
<br />
“It feels amazing, I&#39;ve never felt closer to my family then I do now” Jenny replied.<br />
<br />
After a brief moment of thought, Tatiana looked Gabriel in the eye and made her decision.<br />
<br />
“Alright then, I want to be fused to you like Jenny is, not necessarily in the same way, but I want to remain human. At least for the time being. I&#39;ll let you decide how we fuse, that is if you even want to.”<br />
<br />
“I would love to fuse with you, there&#39;s no one else in this world I would love to become one with more than you.” Gabriel gushed.<br />
<br />
Their decision made, the couple stood facing each other as Gabriel took a moment to think about how she would fuse with her wife, before eating a black candy. The dragoness wrapped her tail around Tatiana again, this time just below her breasts. Once the section of tail around her began to sink into her torso, Tatiana realized what Gabriel wanted, and laid down on the floor, pressing her legs and feet into the tail in laying in front of her. Her entire body front the chest down, was slowly absorbed by Gabriel&#39;s tail, the appendage swelling out from all the excess mass it was taking in. As she became one with Gabriel&#39;s tail, strange new sensations began to arrive in Tatiana&#39;s mind, she felt her partner&#39;s draconic body like it was her own, since it WAS now her body as well.<br />
<br />
Once she no longer felt any traces of her legs, Tatiana looked down at her new position. Her body had remained the same until just below her breasts, where she was now entirely a draconic tail, the  thick appendage stretching for approximately four feet before connecting to Gabriel&#39;s body, her legs  having grown thicker and more muscular in order to carry the added weight of Tatiana&#39;s tail-body. Deciding to test how much control she had over her body, Tatiana attempts to flex the muscles across her form. She is able to move her arms and neck easily enough, but she finds she also has control of their tail as well. Lifting herself up with the muscular tail she wraps her arms around Gabriel&#39;s neck and kisses her on the cheek.<br />
<br />
“This feels amazing dear, It&#39;s wonderful to be together in such an intimate way” The living tail joyfully shouts.<br />
<br />
“Yes, already I can&#39;s imagine you as anything but my tail dear, it feels incredible to share a body with you” The dragoness replies before pulling her wife into a passionate kiss on the lips.<br />
<br />
Tatiana then reached down and started groping Gabriel&#39;s four breasts, revelling in the shared sensations. As her wife was pleasuring her up top, Gabriel reached down and began rubbing her slit, adding another host of sensations arcing through their body. The two spouses didn&#39;t last long before the multiplied feelings from their masturbation brought them to climax.<br />
<br />
As the two came down from their orgasm, they saw that their neighbours had been watching them, now clearly flushed with arousal from the show. Once she realized that Tatiana and Gabriel were done, Robert got everyone&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
“Alright, we&#39;ve got a huge supply of candies now so we need to start using them. The way we are now it will be hard to get food and other necessities without causing a panic, so we need to turn enough people into dragons, or parts of dragons, that we can at least secure a supply of food. So I propose that Gabriel and Tatiana, being the only ones of us that still has a humanoid shape, head out and start converting the rest of the neighbourhood. It&#39;s dark enough outside that, with large enough coats and some hats, people might think your human from their windows. Meanwhile, the five of us will check on the candy delivery to make sure everything&#39;s in order, and then maybe blow off a bit of steam.”<br />
<br />
Everyone agreed to Roberts plan, even if they didn&#39;t need to turn people into dragons out of necessity, they would do it anyways to share the joy the candies brought them. Tatiana and Gabriel donned the largest coats they could find in the house and put on some wide brimmed hats before stepping out into the dark with the half-empty tub of dragon candies. Side by side as they were, they almost looked like a normal couple walking down the driveway, if it weren&#39;t for the fact that one of them lacked legs.<br />
<br />
The conjoined couple walked over to one of the neighbouring houses, the one that wasn&#39;t their own, and rang the doorbell. This house belonged to Helen, a divorced woman who lived there with her adult son Kyle. According to Helen, she had caught her husband cheating on her with one of his coworkers, and had gotten sole custody of their only son in court. <br />
<br />
When Kyle looked through the peephole in the door, curious as to who would be at the door this late at night, he saw the face of Tatiana who looked normal enough through the fish-eye lens with Gabriel hiding out of view. As soon as he opened the door however, he saw the dragoness and her living tail standing outside. Before he could make a sound Gabriel put a clawed hand over his mouth as Tatiana reached into the tub.</p>
<hr/><h3>
What do they do to Kyle?</h3>
