<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, there's something you don't see every day.&quot; Zack commented, observing, like the other huskies, the various guests, ninety nine percent of the guests totally oblivious to the husky's presence. Ironically, the only husky to get expelled from the pack, wasn't over being too rough or talking back to Naomi (which most of the pack thought of as either suicidal or stupid).  The exile had been a husky who had been recording the love making of some of the guests and posting it on his personal web site 'furrylove.org.' The husky had been drummed up with everything from breaking the nondisclosure agreement to posting the videos without the guests' permission or consent. And had been the birth of the increased strictness on what the huskies could have while employed by the park. However, it had -not- brought an end to the huskies looking at guests whenever they pleased. Ironically, it was this lack of privacy, that had resulted in there being no rapes within the park's history. The huskies had been fully versed on when 'no meant no and not yes.' Combined with their ninja-like reaction time and ability to appear almost out of nowhere, had successfully put the fear of God into some who would have otherwise succumb to temptation. <br />
<br />
Doth, it was easy to understand why the huskies knew it wasn't really anyone's fault when the new she-panther had finished hunting, and seemed more comfortable with herself, when the trouble started. Another of the great cats (dang they were popular this time of year, must have recently been an anime con somewhere), a an unaltered straight male, had placed a hand on her shoulder. She had screamed bloody murder, and had broken his arm and dislocated his shoulder before running several miles in a panic. The confused panther boy was now in a shoulder cast (his injury wasn't life threatening and thus didn't require the need of the tissue rebuilder option), but would recover. The other great cats had quickly made a point to stay away from the 'new girl.' Which to be honest, suited her just fine. Not to mention Kenpo and Kick-Boxing were both something no 'natural' unevolved four legged cat would ever do, and being on the receiving end of such had thrown perceptions of her out of wack, again the way she liked it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guess not everyone is about to embrace the 'wisdom of the female side' after all.&quot; Zack commented. It annoyed Naomi whenever one of the former males in the park decided they didn't want to be permanently departed from their Y chromosome.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Guess so. Heh.&quot; Said one of the twins, &quot;This is the first time I think we've been a guy actually become a Tom Boy after their change, most either act gender neutral or play act the part for kicks.&quot; With stunning exceptions such as Jackie, Hannah, and Leticia of course. Though these exceptions (for both genders), were becoming a bit too regular. <br />
<br />
&quot;So did you hear? Harry and Katie finally did it.&quot; Said the second twin. <br />
<br />
&quot;For the last time, no we didn't!&quot; Katie snapped, the exceptional hearing her modifications had given her letting her pick up the discussion easily. <br />
<br />
Katie and Harry were across the room, calmly chatting with their work station. Harry in pants, Katie in her dress. <br />
<br />
It dismayed some of the huskies that Katie had managed to pull Harry into her 'cult' of clothing. Still, both were doing their jobs just as well, so the others had no right complain. <br />
<br />
Naomi herself considered clothing a necessary evil her kind would need to wear outside the park to be properly respected in society, (&quot;Naked people have little or no influence.&quot;). So she never understood why Katie insisted on hiding herself among her fellows, or how she had managed to drag Harry into her school of thought. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Before leaving Hannah to Marth, Su Yin had one last piece of discussion to give her friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hannah, before anything else, I want you to know I'm sorry.&quot; The mask of the cool calm and collected was removed to show the emotion underneath.<br />
<br />
Hannah was in the dark however. &quot;Sorry? For what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was the one who encouraged you, no, -ordered- you to go back to Marth. And if that hadn't happened, you wouldn't have been there to talk sense into Lord Jeremy, and wouldn't have been targeted by Madam Maggie... don't say 'no harm, no foul.' The point is my choices almost killed you.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hannah's ear wilted. &quot;Su Yin.... don't blame yourself. Maggie attacked me, not you. And... thank you, for not letting me give up on Marth. It means a lot to me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Then you forgive me?&quot; The doe asked hesitantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's nothing to forgive Su'.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... All right. If that's your decision then I won't weight myself down on it. You're welcome for Marth, and thank you.&quot; Su Yin bowed, took one last look at the books, and left.<br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;That's just the thing.&quot; Marth said, &quot;To me, Leticia and Larry will always be the same. Or maybe it's Marth whose in love with Leticia and it was Maria who was in love with Larry. My feelings are the same either way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the more reason to accept, you know you have to move on. And you -know-, that it's not right for you to miss the biggest day of Lady Leticia's life.&quot; <br />
<br />
Marth stared at one of the four blank walls of the room. So alien to him, even after such a short time. Was Maria that distant now? He surprised himself when he shuddered at the idea of wearing a dress. <br />
<br />
Marth nodded. &quot;Okay Hannah, I'll accept.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Robbie was a little surprised to learn that Jenny and Spike would have to stay in the park for at least another six months. Heh. He wondered when Spike's birthday was. He hoped it was earlier in the year, or the poor kid was gonna miss out on cake. <br />
<br />
Robbie left the park the same time as the rest of the herd (with the exception of Boss Man Jeremy and Boss Lady Leticia of course). He knew that the park was normally strict about stay times. Jenny must have risen up a storm to get Spike and herself to stay as themselves. Themselves? Yes, themselves. <br />
<br />
Robbie had entered this park, and still had no desire to go through life with antlers. Still, Jenny had gonna be a doe on the outside with Spike.... maybe some time as a monkey again would be good... a chance to get his head on straight, and decide (without the instinct driven attraction), if Jenny was the right girl for him. <br />
<br />
Still, could he leave her and Spike alone for six months? Well, the rest of the herd with a grudge against Spike was going to leave at the same time as him, so there was no danger. And as lovely as the idea was, Robbie knew better than to force Jenny to look after Spike, and to try to have another child in the mean time to ... Oh boy, did he have it bad! <br />
<br />
Yeah, maybe some time away from antlers and fur would be a good idea, to just make sure what he was feeling was real. Besides, it wasn't like the gene splicer wouldn't be waiting for him after those six months had come along and Jenny and Spike stepped out of the park with Hannah. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Flowers?&quot; Hannah asked surprised. <br />
<br />
Lateisha laughed,  &quot;Oh! That's right you've been in here the whole time! Let me tell you! A couple of huskies just the other day presented us all with a bunch of bought white flowers for Leticia and the bride maids to wear during the wedding!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Hannah was stunned, wondering if this was a act of trust by the managment, or perhaps Juanita doing the guests a favor. Hannah laughed, &quot;The bucks are gonna feel naked.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
To note, as a rule, while many morphs had bigger or more slender builds, all of them were human sized. Thus, Father Tyminski of course wasn't the size of an actual raccoon, the bucks combined with their antlers just made them rather tall figures. But regardless of height, Jeremy's stature overshadowed every buck. For better or worse. <br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think? All black?&quot; Jeremy looked at John, showing off his colored body. <br />
<br />
John struggled to give his honest opinion to his herd leader. &quot;No, I don't think that it really looks good on you, sir. You should go with just the black markings, not your entire fur sir.&quot; <br />
<br />
After some creativity, the bucks had managed to make some black body paint, after some comical attempts at cloning a tuxedo, it was decided to go with finding the best body pattern. <br />
<br />
John meanwhile, wondered, after hearing the news about Lady Jenny, wondered if he was gonna see the human Robbie ever again. John had already decided 'from the monkeys he had come, and to the monkeys he would return' as the slogan had become among morphs fully intending to go back to their normal life after their stay in the park was over. <br />
<br />
While it was improper for the bride and groom to see each other before the moment, John already knew that he was gonna have to discuss things with Lateisha about getting the bucks' patterns and the does' flowers to properly compliment each other. <br />
<br />
Oh well, maybe they could use Marth and Beauty Queen Hannah as models when figuring it out. <br />
<br />
Marth was still an odd ball in the park, he hadn't decided on his pecking order yet, which he would have to do when they decided on seating arrangements. Oh well, first things first. His heard leader have given him a job, and John fully intended to fulfill it.<br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything seems to be working out for the better.&quot; Katie commented. <br />
<br />
Harry said, &quot;Yep. Too bad we can't sneak in wedding rings under the budget radar like we did the flowers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe not... but...&quot; Katie abandoned her post and ran, nearly blaspheme among the huskies. <br />
<br />
However, Katie managed to avoid being detected by Naomi, putting all her stealth and skill to their ultimate test. Harry wondered what the heck she was up to... until she returned with two rather large metal golden colored bands. They weren't rings, they were too big to fit on human fingers, but they could...<br />
<br />
&quot;Some large earrings from my locker.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How did you...&quot; Harry was a gasp. &quot;Those are supposed to be off limits until our contracts expire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They never thought of bothering to make the security husky proof. I'm pretty sure Spike won't mind being a ring bearer... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Those are... real gold? Katie are you really sure about this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This park screws over people way too much as it is with their weird policies and whatever agendas they have that we're all secondary to. So I figured, meh, why not? You only get to be married once.&quot;</p>
