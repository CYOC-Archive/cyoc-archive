<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Note: I took some ideas from the suggestions from the first page<br />
<br />
Miss Mona read the prompts. Her spell made them think that these transformations were normal, and even encouraged them to desire the them, but it did nothing for their imagination. No, these answers the students submitted were 100% their own imagination. <br />
<br />
Some of these kids had interesting out of the box ideas. While the general theme of transformations had been statues, some had expanded the definition to things she didn&#39;t immediately consider, and even included paintings as well. <br />
<br />
Miss Mona paired them up and had them start working. A boy carried in a large pot and a bag of dirt, courtesy of the enchanted supply closet Miss Mona had. His partner took off her socks and shoes, and rolled up her pants legs before stepping into it. Miss Mona was curious about the logic behind that considering the nature of the transformation but the logic of someone under a rationality change spell was often strange. The boy began burying her feet while she talked about how exciting it would be to become a tree.<br />
<br />
Another stylishly dressed young lady with beautiful brown hair and wearing an expensive looking white sweater and a beret (were they allowed to wear hats?) took a pose. With her hand on her hips and a serious look on her face, Miss Mona thought she was probably imagining herself on the cat walk. &quot;Perfect!&quot; Her friend told her. &quot;Hold that pose Sasha.&quot; The girl dipped her brush in flesh colored paint, and applied it generously to Sasha&#39;s face. It left behind a smooth surface with a plastic sheen, with no hint of the serious pout the girl had previously worn. <br />
<br />
While the mannequin was finished up, Miss Mona turned her attention to a pair cutting up construction paper, and place it in a bucket. One girl was a pretty blonde in a cheerleader uniform. The other was a classic nerd, but she had potential to pull off the sexy librarian look in a few years after she matured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this isn&#39;t going to hurt?&quot; The nerd asked sounding concerned. That wasn&#39;t right, none of the students should be worried about any of this. Miss Mona moved closer to watch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its fine Tabbie.&quot; The cheerleader assured her. &quot;Have you ever heard of a piñata getting hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I ever heard of a piñata being made from a person.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Its pretty popular in Europe I think.&quot; She continued cutting up the paper. &quot;Kathy is going to love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; Tabbie said wryly. &quot;What girl doesn&#39;t want to smack her older sister with a bat on her 12th birthday.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly! &quot; The blonde appeared to miss the sarcasm. &quot;Which is why we are giving her a safe way to do that.&quot; She finally noticed Miss Mona&#39;s approach. &quot;Do you think this will be enough Miss Mona?&quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Mona studied the bucket. It sat on the table but if put on the ground it would probably reach a person&#39;s knees. Its circumference was much wider than the girl&#39;s shoulder width. Despite not working long, they had it almost filled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Samantha, I think this will do nicely. Do you mind coming to the front of the room so the class can see?&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha beamed at this. &quot;Of course!&quot; She nearly shouted. Miss Mona loved how cheerleaders were enthusiastic and ready to be the center of attention. <br />
<br />
Samantha and Tabbie followed her to the front where the Venus de Mona was previously, now it was placed by the desk where she could admire it while inputting grades.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen up everyone!&quot; Miss Mona called. &quot;I love the work you have put into this so far. Lilly, Sasha makes a fine mannequin, and Rayna, Bobby looks stunning as a recreation of The Thinker. However as Chris and Erica already discovered,&quot; she gestured to the girl in the pot was was buried half way up her calves. The boy had returned with a watering can. &quot;There are other ways to transform someone besides just the paint brushes. Tabby and Samantha are kind enough to show us one that will be a bit quicker then growing a tree.&quot; She turned toward her students. &quot;Samantha please take a pose.&quot;<br />
<br />
Samantha had brought her pom-poms up with her. She spread her feet apart and placed one on her hip and the other in the air. She gave the class a dazzling smile.<br />
<br />
Miss Mona brought a chair for Tabbie to stand on. Once up there, Miss Mona handed her the bucket if confetti. &quot;Now be careful to get only Samantha and not yourself&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabbie nodded and lifted the bucket. &quot;Wait!&quot; Samantha said in a harsh whisper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tabbie gave a sigh of relief. &quot;Finally change your mind?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Samantha responded as if Tabbie was being ridiculous. Which is the response she should be having. Tabbie on the other hand continued as if only under half of the spell.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then what?&quot; Tabbie pleaded<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me do a count down.&quot; Samantha requested. <br />
<br />
Miss Mona arched an eyebrow. &quot;A count down?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its called showmanship. Samantha responded. <br />
<br />
Miss Mona smiled. &quot;Sounds wonderful.&quot; She stepped out of the way so the class could see her clearly.<br />
<br />
Samantha began shaking the pom-pom above her head, creating their signature rustling sound. &quot;Three!&quot; She shouted as Tabbie lifted the bucket above her own head to reach Samantha&#39;s outstretched arm. &quot;Two!&quot; Samantha continued as Tabbie began tipping it over her. &quot;One!&quot; Tabbie spilled the confetti over her friend and the cheerleader was briefly cut off from view by the colorful pieces of paper. While hidden the rustling pom-pom was abruptly cut off and went silent.<br />
<br />
Once the paper fell to the ground, the class could see the life size cheerleader piñata that had replaced Samantha. The plastic ends of her pom-poms had been converted to paper with the rest of her skin and her green and white uniform. Her wavy hair had gone stiff as it was now apart of the paper mache head. Her face appeared painted on and the dazzling smile was now a cheezy grin showing off a mouth and teeth tha6 were unrealistically big. Her blue eyes were also painted on, and also overly large.<br />
<br />
The class stared in stun silence. Then the applause started. Miss Mona had to hand it to her. While a piñata may not be as lovely as a marble statue, Samantha knew how to sell it. That earned her bonus points.<br />
<br />
&quot;Smantha will be used by her little sister at her birthday party this weekend. This unfortunately means you won&#39;t see her cheering on the sidelines this weekend at the game, but her mother has agreed to send us a recording of the the performance she will be putting on instead at the party. Thank you Tabbie for being willing to help demonstrate.&quot; Tabbie nodded uncertainly. &quot;Alright class, please continue with your assignments. &quot;<br />
<br />
Miss Mona looked around the room but kept an eye on Tabbie. Something was odd about her, but she was a teacher and had other students to help. Another student appeared to need help with...</p>
