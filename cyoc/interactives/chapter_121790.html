<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benton turned the television off; while maintaining a stony façade, Benton was positively elated at the news off Jack Crawford in jail. The footage of him being dragged from his condo building and placed in a federal vehicle; Benton could barely contain himself.<br />
‘As soon as Frances leaves,’ Benton thinking to himself; ‘I’m breaking out that bottle Don Perignon. To hell with the promise I made to Amanda about no more alcohol; this is cause for celebration.’<br />
<br />
“Benton are you paying attention?”<br />
Benton looks up as both Amanda and Frances look at him.<br />
“Sorry,” Benton answering; “my mind was else were. What were we talking about?”<br />
“Yours and Amanda’s relationship,” Frances answering.<br />
“What are you a marriage counselor,” Benton retorting.<br />
“Not by trade,” Frances smiling; “but I did help Martin and Mellissa Stovall keep their marriage together while their daughter was going through her issues.”<br />
“I thought it was because Mellissa was pregnant,” Amanda answering. “Personally, if Benton cheated on me; I would have divorced his ass and taken him for every penny.”<br />
“Would that be before or after you scratched my eyes out,” Benton looking at his wife incredulously.<br />
“Try and find out,” Amanda looking serious; “Frances, our marriage is not a fairytale. Benton and I do have our difficulties.”<br />
“Mostly due to Frieda’s scheming,” Benton chiming in.<br />
“Oh no,” Amanda turning her gaze to Benton; “you are not foisting our daughter on the top of that mountain. You are just as guilty with the scheming and double dealing.”<br />
“I think not,” Benton snapping back; “when was the last time I went back on a promise or a deal with you?”<br />
<br />
Amanda just grins as she gets up; disappearing from the room and leaving both Benton and Frances guessing. It was a few minutes later when she came back placing a bottle on the table.<br />
“You think I wouldn’t find this,” Amanda showing the bottle of champagne Benton was thinking of earlier. “After Saturday, you swore no more alcohol.”<br />
“I was saving this bottle of Don Perignon,” Benton rolling his eyes; “for a special occasion. Jack Crawford’s arrest,” Benton removing the foil off the bottle; “seems appropriate.”<br />
“Really,” Amanda looking at Benton; “you think this is a champagne moment?”<br />
“I was going to wait after Frances here left,” Benton popping the cork; “make it a romantic moment for the two of us. Head back upstairs,” Benton looking coy; “and have a midday romp.”<br />
<br />
Amanda just glares at her husband, seeing the foam from the bottle spill over. Him pulling out a couple of fine crystal champagne flutes and watching him pour the golden bubbly liquid into the glasses.<br />
“Perhaps,” Frances stepping in; “we should circle back to a prior issue that is bothering Benton.”<br />
“And what would that be,” Amanda staring at the champagne.<br />
“Benton clearly showed his displeasure earlier,” Frances rechecking her notes; “in regards to the three puppies you adopted. You said there was going to be discussion about getting them?”<br />
<br />
“I promised Frieda,” Benton sighing; that we would talk about it. I had no idea that Amanda would just go to the local shelter and pick up three without consulting me.”<br />
“Frieda did raise a valid point,” Amanda chiming in; “after Saturday, we need to have guard dogs. And don’t forget,” Amanda pointing to her husband; “after the deputy came by last night, asking if we seen anyone prowling about.”<br />
“What,” Frances interrupting; “you had a deputy come by last night?”<br />
“It was during that whole manhunt for Frederick’s shooter,” Benton answering; “he said that the man who shot Frederick had a laptop with this estate’s address on it. I believe the deputy also mentioned your address as well,” Benton looking at Frances.<br />
“You changed your tune about the puppies,” Amanda grabbing a champagne flute; “after that deputy visited us. Which reminds me,” Amanda downing the champagne in one gulp; “we promised to talk to the sheriff around noon.”<br />
“Oh shit,” Benton swearing; “can we reschedule that?”<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…..<br />
<br />
Douglas Cooper and Joan were at the local grocery store, shopping for fresh food as the cupboards at Douglas’s were literally bare. After having a long day at work; a shift that didn’t end until after the capture of Jose, Douglas made it clear that he was not going to be in until later that day. Finding out that  a deputy promised the Knights that he would be available to talk to them in regards to Jose; Douglas rolled his eyes at why the deputy would make such statement. Instructing the duty sergeant to handle the manner tactfully; Douglas quickly finishes up his call just as Joan approached him. <br />
“Which is better,” Joan hold two different gourds in her hands; “butternut squash or spaghetti squash?”<br />
“Get both,” Douglas responding; “a soup with one and a pasta dish with the other sounds tastey.”<br />
“Will Darrell eat either,” Joan placing the squashes in the cart.<br />
“Orange soup and pasta,” Douglas chuckling; “he’ll think the soup is made of cheese and the pasta? Well Darrell does enjoy food that makes a mess,” Douglas pushing the cart; “anything else we need in the produce section?”<br />
<br />
Back at the Knight Estate……<br />
<br />
“Is there any issues you are having with your medication,” Frances writing down the last of Benton and Amanda’s answers.<br />
“None that I can think of,” Benton answering; “although, I’m still not thrilled that some of the pills I have to take multiple times a day.”<br />
“But you are taking them,” Frances looking at Benton; “you know the risks if you stop taking your medication.”<br />
<br />
“I’m aware of the risks,” Benton remembering the various prophetic dreams he had. One in which he was locked in a cage; snarling and raving like a wild animal. Only pausing when Frieda steps forward to show him his granddaughter. The second dream was just as grim; being hunted in the woods as he tries to get away from those hunting him. Fellow weres, as he went feral. The third dream was witnessing his daughter give birth his granddaughter. Holding the newborn baby in his hands as both he and Amanda look on joyously.<br />
“Just making sure,” Frances responding; “bipolar disorder is a serious condition for a were. Left untreated; it will result in a were going feral.”<br />
“We know,” Amanda responding; “I’ve seen him take those pills on a regular basis.”<br />
“Well if that is everything,” Frances looking at the time; “I should be going. I do have an appointment with another patient at the hospital.”<br />
“I’ll show you out then,” Benton getting up; escorting Frances to the front foyer, where George was already waiting for them.<br />
<br />
“Before I leave,” Frances turning to look at Benton; “you still seem to be letting the stresses of your job and family issues keeping you anxious and on edge. You need to learn to let them not control you,” Frances continuing; “they are not helping your already tenuous mental state.”<br />
“And I said before,” Benton recalling the prior talk on stress; “easier said than done.”<br />
“You need to make the effort Benton,” Frances reminding the large man; “in fact, you should make today a mental wellness day.”<br />
“A what day,” Benton looking oddly at Frances.<br />
“A day where you do nothing but take care of yourself,” Frances elaborating; “no calls, no work and most importantly, no fighting.”<br />
“I can’t spend the day doing nothing,” Benton sighing; “I need to keep busy or I’ll go stir crazy.”<br />
“Talk to your wife about that,” Frances grinning; “I’m sure she will have an ideal or two.”<br />
<br />
“So what did Frances had to say as she left,” Amanda putting away to bottle of Don Perignon.<br />
“She said for me to take a personal mental me day,” Benton sighing; “or some such nonsense.”<br />
“Its not nonsense,” Amanda answering; “you do have a tendency to overwork and neglect your other responsibilities.”<br />
“She said you’d have an ideal or two in how to keep me busy today,” Benton sighing.<br />
“Oh I have a couple thoughts,” Amanda smiling; “while I’m spending the day taking care of these three puppies, you can spend time doing some maintenance to our swimming pool. The filters need replacing and the water&#39;s PH needs adjusting. Later after that is done; you can pick up Frieda from school and spend the day with her. Help her with her homework,” Amanda placing the bottle of champagne in the fridge; “afterwards, when its time for bed, we can celebrate with the bottle of bubbly you got.”<br />
“Oh,” Benton mildly curious to what Amanda is suggesting; “so you are not upset over the champagne I got?”<br />
“Oh I’m upset,” Amanda looking at Benton; “but at least it isn’t hard and vile as that Bourbon Whiskey you like to drink. And just so we are clear,” Amanda glaring at her husband; “don’t think for one moment that you can hide a bottle of booze in our house and not have me sniff it out. Plus,” Amanda noticing the timer on Benton’s phone beeping; signaling he had to take his medication; “you are not supposed to mix alcohol with your pills.”</p>
