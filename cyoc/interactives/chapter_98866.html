<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I caused the six guys to have different schedules so it would be easier for me to control them. I scheduled them in such a way that I could play with all six of them at once or pick only one or two at a time while the others were out of the house. The next morning was one of the days I had all six guys in the house and I wasn&#39;t in the mood to play with any of them so I let them all go about their morning routine getting ready for work. All the guys got to see Matt the mannequin wander into and out of the bathroom but I cast spells so they would all go along with it the same way Travis had the night before.<br />
<br />
Yes, I was allowing Matt to move. I wanted him to go out into the world and try to live his life as a mannequin and I&#39;d cast a spell later to see what that life was like for him.<br />
<br />
Spencer took a different more creative approach than Travis had. When I cast the spell on Spencer to make him go along with Matt the mannequin, he didn&#39;t simply dismiss it as a costume.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking good there bro. You finally took my advice and tried those skin care products I suggested. I have to say they did much more for your body than they did mine. Your skin is so smooth and shiny.&quot; Spencer openly fondled Matt&#39;s mannequin ass.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s why I liked keeping Spencer around. I could always count on him to cross the boundaries and add just a bit more humiliation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spencer, I&#39;ve told you, quit touching my ass. It&#39;s just for work. I&#39;m not trying to turn you on.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s why I liked toying with Matt. He had just the right balance of resistance and submission. I could always count on him to protest but not stop the fun. I could tell that if I planted the idea in Spencer&#39;s head I wouldn&#39;t even have to cast a spell to get Spencer to stick his dick up Matt&#39;s ass but that was an idea I decided to wait on and explore another day. I had other plans. In fact I didn&#39;t do anything else with Matt for the rest of the week which brings us to today.<br />
<br />
I told you how earlier today, some idiot turned me into a dick. Well to change back, I needed to orgasm. It&#39;s hard for a dick to masturbate itself and Matt was the only other person in the store that wasn&#39;t busy so I cast spells to make him think I was his dick and make him need to whack off. I even made him put me in his own ass just before I shot my load. I returned to normal with my dick still in him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Matt. You&#39;re a good friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I didn&#39;t orgasm. How&#39;d I whack off and not have an orgasm?&quot;<br />
<br />
I let Matt continue to think I was his dick but sent him back to work as a mannequin while I returned to my job as cashier.<br />
<br />
We don&#39;t often get customers looking for costumes. It&#39;s a seasonal thing and we&#39;re not a costume shop. However, when customers want costumes out of season, they do come to us. I had two customers who were talking about a costume party.<br />
<br />
They were confused. I used a spell to find out what kind of party it really was and it was a masquerade party which is not the same as a costume party. But I decided to play on their confusion for my own fun. I suggested to them that their might be a prize for the wildest costume and used a spell to make them believe my suggestion was absolute truth.<br />
<br />
Landon suggested, &quot;We could go as conjoined twins. That would be wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan said, &quot;No, we&#39;re not twins and I don&#39;t want to share a costume with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want to share a costume with you either but think about the prize money. Wouldn&#39;t that be worth it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Conjoined twins isn&#39;t that wild anyway. What if we get there and find eight other people in conjoined twin costumes. We really need something that sets us above the others or it&#39;s not worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;I&#39;ve got the perfect idea. You could go as the Jack of Hearts.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took them back to our costume section. We didn&#39;t have costumes on hand. We had cast a spell on one of our racks to produce costumes whenever anyone in the store mentioned a costume idea and the new costume would stay on the rack for months unless bought. The rack would read the minds of everyone in the store and let everyone&#39;s ideas shape the costume. Sure enough, on the rack was a royal shirt in red, blue and gold with matching red crowns.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a playing card costume, good. When you suggested it I was afraid it would just be a piece of cardboard with cutouts for our faces.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no. We always have high quality costumes. Matt come over here and show them.&quot; I quickly cast a spell to keep the customers from freaking out. &quot;Our mannequin is actually Matt wearing a costume. Matt, strip and show them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do I have to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to make a sale? I&#39;ll split the commission with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt stripped revealing his whole body. He even flexed his muscles which wasn&#39;t something I thought of but loved. If this had been Travis, he wouldn&#39;t have thought about flexing his muscles.<br />
<br />
I pulled his arms off and handed one each to Landon and Logan.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the wildest costume ever. How&#39;d you pull off that trick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We are a magic shop. We have our secrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The costume is wild but I don&#39;t think I want to share a costume with him. Wouldn&#39;t one of us have to be upside down the entire time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can take turns. One of you upside down for part of the party and then switch places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if one of us has to pee? It looks like we&#39;d have to strip completely out of that costume to pee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we think about that problem too when we design our costumes. Feel Matt&#39;s ass. You&#39;ll find he has an asshole so he doesn&#39;t have to remove anything when he needs a bathroom break.&quot;<br />
<br />
I used a spell and both guys stuck their fingers in Matt&#39;s hole. Matt groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s not wearing underwear under his costume. I don&#39;t want to go commando while sharing a costume with a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think with this costume that it doesn&#39;t matter. You can keep your pants on.&quot;<br />
<br />
The guys agreed so I took them to the changing room. Our changing room is more literally a changing room than most stores. I had them take of their shirts and everything from the waist up. Then I had them lay on the floor as they slipped into the royal shirt. The spell activated and their pants deflated as neither guy had legs anymore to fill them. They both tried to stand up at the same time and wound up standing on all fours with both their heads down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take turns. Which one of you first?&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan said, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll take bottom first.&quot;<br />
<br />
They stood up with Logan looking like he was doing a handstand.<br />
<br />
&quot;My arms are your legs. This is wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. Somehow your arms feel like my legs and I don&#39;t feel any strain like I would if I was standing on my arms. Let&#39;s switch and try it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They cartwheeled so Landon was down.<br />
<br />
&quot;When we switch, my arms become your legs. I still don&#39;t feel any strain. It feels natural to be standing on my arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
I reached down and touched Landon&#39;s head. Logan commanded, &quot;Hands off pervert.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea hands off. Don&#39;t touch his privates. Wait, my head is his privates. Let me out of this costume.&quot;<br />
<br />
Logan agreed and they quickly stripped off the costume completely naked. From the waist up, each looked normal but at the waist, they smoothly blended into each other. They shared one belly button between them.<br />
<br />
They were angry and they attacked me. I was surprised at how coordinated they were together. They cartwheeled into action with their arms easily switching from kicking me like legs to hitting me with fists. I was caught off guard and they managed to land some hard blows but they were only using physical violence and I had magic. It was fun but I then hit them with a spell to stop the attack.<br />
<br />
When they realized how helpless they were, they bent at the waist and hugged each other, comforting each other. Occasionally, they would even pat each others head but then pull their hands away when they realized it felt like they had just patted their own dick heads.<br />
<br />
I knew that before I let them out into the world this way, I&#39;d have to cast some more spells to make people go along with it but for now, it was too much fun watching them struggle with the idea that they had now become each others dicks. Even when their heads touched, it was like they were frotting together.</p>
