<br />
After the altercation, Nyx and her sister were together in their room with Chase. Chase was with Andromeda but assured her sister that she would stay with her if she wanted.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m fine, really sis. You and Chase can go somewhere else if you want.” Nyx said putting on a brave face.<br />
<br />
“A-Are you sure? I mean, Aaron seemed pretty upset—“ Andromeda said.<br />
<br />
“I’m fine. I don’t care what he said. He just needs time alone, you know?” Nyx reassured.<br />
<br />
Once her and Chase were satisfied, Nyx was left alone in her room. Once the door was closed she slowly slid to the floor and cupped her hands over her face. She couldn’t let anyone see her cry, especially not her sister and her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
She cried leaning on the door before getting up and rushing over to her bed, wrapping herself in her black bedsheets. Then she felt a presence hovering above her, then a hand touched her back. The vampire Princess emerged from her sheets to see her great-great aunt Hanako.<br />
<br />
“W-What do you want? If you or the five had done your jobs and protected my father none of this would have happened! Then Aaron wouldn’t hate me!” She cried.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure he doesn’t hate you.” The black haired woman assured.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m not s-so sure…you weren’t there, you didn’t see their fight…you didn’t hear h-his howling. H-H-H-He t-told me himself: he blames me for what h-happened to Caleb…h-he never wants to see me again.” Nyx cried.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be foolish. Remember back at the arena? That boy was nearly ripped apart—an inch from death—all to prove his love for you.” Hanako said firmly.<br />
<br />
“Then why did he leave?” Nyx cried.<br />
<br />
<br />
——————————————————<br />
<br />
A portal ripped through the Kitsune forest. Aaron was thrown out and stopped his momentum by digging his claws into the ground. He looked around and his instincts told him exactly where he was. He didn’t care why, he couldn’t think about it anything but Caleb and Nyx. He knew he fucked up, he didn’t know what to do, who to turn to. He simply began walking through the forest, eventually coming along a dirt road.<br />
<br />
As he walked he kept running that night’s events through his head over and over.<br />
<br />
‘There’s no way I can go back right?’ He thought to himself, ‘Nyx probably thinks I hate her…I shouldn’t have said I blamed her for what happened…it was my fault…Caleb…I’m sorry.’<br />
<br />
Aaron didn’t know how long he continued to walk the road, he only took notice when he came upon a village. The kitsune there seemed to enjoy a quiet peaceful life. Though there were signs of the recent civil war; some buildings were being rebuilt, fields of rice were craters being filled in again.<br />
<br />
He walked up to one of the kitsune and asked how to get to the capital. Aaron only received vague directions and he was clueless on landmarks or the names of places in this realm. He thanked the man and turned to leave but ran into someone. The sound of clanging metal rang out and Aaron turned to see a black and white vixen. She had two tails and wore a simple light red kimono with her sleeves tied back. Her white hair was half tied up in a half<br />
<br />
“G-Gomen’nasai. I should have looked where I was going.” The young fox girl said scrambling to pick up the ingots.<br />
<br />
Aaron kneeled down and gathered the remaining metal bars before helping the girl up.<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize. It was my fault. Let me help you, where are taking these?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“I-I’m just taking these steel ingots to the blacksmith. I’m delivering them as well as other materials to help with the reconstruction.” The vixen said.<br />
<br />
The girl looked almost guilty but Aaron pushed those that aside and helped carry the metal back to the market. Once they arrived at the blacksmith they unloaded the rest of the materials and were thanked by the blacksmith.<br />
<br />
“It’s the least I could do—I-I should get going now.” She said with a bow.<br />
<br />
Then they headed back to the girl’s cart.<br />
<br />
“Arigat&#333;gozaimasu.” She said getting on.<br />
<br />
“Oh, you don’t live here, miss…?” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
“Uh—H-Hina-chan. And no, I don’t live in this village. I was making a delivery from the capital.” Hina explained.<br />
<br />
“That’s perfect—I mean, I don’t suppose you could give me a ride there. I asked for directions but I’m afraid I’m not from around here you could say.” Aaron explained.<br />
<br />
“H-Hai.” Hina replied.<br />
<br />
“Thank you. I’m Aaron, nice to meet you.” He said.<br />
<br />
Aaron climbed on the cart and sat next to her, kicking his foot up on the footrest. The two tailed girl gave the horses a coach whip and they began to leave the town. They rode in silence before Aaron decided to speak.<br />
<br />
“So, are you a blacksmith’s daughter or something? No offense but I doubt you’re a traveling metal merchant.” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“I-I…hai. I’m a blacksmith’s niece. We live and work in the Royal city. I wanted to help out at his shop but I’m afraid I’m not much of a sword maker.” She revealed.<br />
<br />
“He sent you all the way out here by yourself?” He then asked.<br />
<br />
“Hai, I can handle myself and…I wanted to help those affected by the war.” Hina answered.<br />
<br />
“Was pretty bad. I had some siblings fighting in the civil war.” Aaron replied.<br />
<br />
“O-oh…are they…?” She replied quietly.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know actually, I’ve been kind of preoccupied lately…I’m starting to think I should have joined them in the fight.” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
“Why didn’t you—if you don’t mind my asking, Aaron-san.” Hina asked trying to hide her guilt.<br />
<br />
“It’s…complicated. I guess you could say I was preoccupied with a girl…it’s complicated but love always is I guess.” Aaron said.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t know. I’ve never loved anyone before.” Hina replied quietly.<br />
<br />
“Is that so? I was sure a pretty girl like you would have guys tripping over themselves for you.” Aaron said with a smirk, trying to be kind.<br />
<br />
“That’s kind of you to say but the truth is…I don’t think anyone could love me.” Hina said, her hears turning downward.<br />
<br />
“You sound like my girlfriend…at least I hope she’s still my girlfriend.” Aaron replied ribbing his furry face in exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Hina didn’t want to press further, clearly the red kitsune was tired.<br />
<br />

<br />
Back in Andromeda and Nyx’s bedroom, Nyx was still wrapped up in her bedsheet crying as Hanako tried to think of something to cheer the poor girl up. Finally, an idea came to her mind as she gave a little smile and put her hand gently on Nyx’s shoulder.<br />
<br />
“You know, I know a love story that I too didn’t think would have a happy ending, but I promise you it does.” Hanako said reassuring her. “Would you like to hear it?” Hanako asked as Nyx sniffled her nose and nodded towards Hanako.<br />
<br />
“Okay, so: once upon a time long ago in the land of Japan, long before your father ruled the vampire realm or anything else you know of today. An outsider arrived in Japan to get away from the problems he faced in his homeland. He tried to make a life for himself there, but he was a stranger, and strangers tend to not do too well away from their home land. He was beaten, robbed a few times, but he never let it get to him, he just told himself that it was something that happened everywhere.” Hanako said.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, is this leading to a happy ending? Because this guy sounds like a bit of a loser.” Nyx remarked as Hanako gave a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
“It gets better. So the man was walking to his home in the rain one day, when he saw a woman he’d never seen before getting assaulted by violent men. He came to her rescue, and the woman was very grateful to the man. She offered him food for the night at her house. He politely declined but insisted that he come. She introduced him to her parents when they arrived and they were just as grateful to the man if not more for protecting their daughter. The man and woman would see each other more after that, day after day, night after night they saw each other. The woman told everything about herself to the man, but the man was hesitant to tell the woman everything about himself in fear of what she would think of him.”<br />
<br />
“So what did he do?” Nyx asked with her bedsheet off of her head. Hanako saw her little solution was working and continued.<br />
<br />
“He left without saying a word to her. The woman was sad for many days, she cried because she had fallen so deeply in love with the man and worried she had said or done something wrong that might have offended him. But one night, the man returned finally to her surprise and he revealed to her what it was that he had been so hesitant to say before. Do you know what that might have been?” Hanako asked Nyx who was sitting on her bed facing Hanako very invested in her story now.<br />
<br />
“He said to her something she never expected to hear: ‘I am Alucard Tepes, son of Dracula. I am a vampire, that is why I left before, because I thought you would fear me for what I am.’” Hanako said as Nyx gasped realizing her great-great aunt had been telling her the story of her parents.<br />
<br />
“But to his delightful surprise, the woman replied: ‘I care not for what you are, I care for who you are. You are my savior, and you are the man I fell in love with.’ They both embraced each other that night and that was how Jun Ashida met her husband Alucard Tepes. Many months later, I was born to them. So you see little one, men can do great things, but men can also do silly things because of the ones they love. Do you understand?” Hanako asked as Nyx nodded getting the gist of what Hanako was saying.<br />
<br />
“Good. Now don’t you worry about, Aaron was it? I’m sure he’ll come back when he’s ready, and he’ll tell you how much he loves you, just as I do.” Hanako said as she handed Nyx her stuffed vampire cat and kissed Nyx on the forehead before going to the bedroom door.<br />
<br />
“Thank you Auntie Hanako.” Nyx thanked, even though she knew Hanako didn’t like the term.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome child.” Hanako said before leaving Nyx alone on her bed hugging her stuffed vampire cat.<br />
<br />
—————————————————-<br />
<br />
They arrived at the capital the next morning, Aaron had fallen asleep next to Hina who was still driving the cart. The Royal city’s walls were in various states of repair. They were let through the gate when they saw his companion, they must know her well enough to let her through on sight.<br />
<br />
They rode up to the Royal district, it was barely touched by the civil war and the people carried on like the war had never happened. Eventually they arrived at the Royal Blacksmith’s shop. He couldn’t believe it, she said she was the niece of a blacksmith in the capital. But he didn’t ever think it would be Chisai’s shop. He was confused, he didn’t know Kiko or Takeo had any children, was this vixen his cousin he didn’t know he had?<br />
<br />
As she hopped off the cart she unloaded supplies while Aaron went in the shop to speak with his uncle. He couldn’t find Chisai but he did find Takeo.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Uncle Takeo. Didn’t think I’d see you working the front desk.” He said walking in and embracing his uncle.<br />
<br />
“Aaron-kun! Great to see you. I’m surprised to see you here. And no, I’m not working the front desk. I’m here to see my brother about some parts I need made. I’m helping with rebuilding the defenses—and adding some new ones. After Ayasa’s forces were defeated we got our hands on their siege equipment, amazing stuff! It’s way more advanced than the mortal realm, I’m thinking that—“ Takeo’s rambling was cut off by Aaron.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay. I don’t need a whole lecture. Where’s Chisai?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“Finally decided to get yourself a sword? Either way he’s down at the outer walls helping with repairs.” The three tails answered.<br />
<br />
“I’ll wait till he gets back.” The red fox said.<br />
<br />
“Do you want me to call the palace and tell them you’re here?” Takeo asked.<br />
<br />
“No, no. I rather they not know I’m here…it’s a long story.” The kintaro replied quickly, “by the way, who’s that two tails you got working for you? She said she’s the blacksmith’s niece but I know you or Kiko don’t have any kids.”<br />
<br />
“Yea…u-uh it’s kind of a long story as well. Hina-chan’s not your cousin. She’s a war orphan I guess…Chisai and us took her in after the war.” Takeo explained.<br />
<br />
Then Hina walked in, she placed firewood next to the door and walked up to the two.<br />
<br />
“Takeo-Ojisama, I finished stocking the forge with more wood.” She said with a bow.<br />
<br />
“Yoi. Kiko-chan gave me a list of some things she needs for dinner tonight.” Takeo said.<br />
<br />
“Wait. Kiko is cooking?” Aaron asked in disbelief.<br />
<br />
“Don’t let her hear you say that. You can go with and help Hina-chan.” The orange kitsune said and walked them to the door.<br />
<br />
Aaron sighed, the last thing he wanted to do was go shopping but Chisai wouldn’t be back for a while and didn’t feel like arguing with his uncle.<br />
<br />
They walked through the market, Hina would guide them to various shops and pick up produce and ingredients that were on Kiko’s list. Aaron silently walked beside her with his hands on his coat pockets.<br />
<br />
“So I assume you’ll be helping Kiko with dinner later?” Aaron said disinterestedly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, uh no. I’m afraid I’m not a very good cook.” Hina said.<br />
<br />
“You can’t cook, you can’t make swords. You must be important somehow if they decided to take you in.” The kitsune pondered.<br />
<br />
“Chisai-san is very kind. I try to be helpful.” The black and white kitsune replied.<br />
<br />
As Hina and Aaron went through the market to collect the ingredients, Aaron overheard a few people talking to each other about the end of the war.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m telling you, I saw a human boy beside a tigress and a kitsune, I&#39;d heard from others that they&#39;re related to the great Fukushu himself.&quot; A female kitsune woman said to three two other kitsune women who looked to be middle age at most.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ve seen that boy around the palace before, I&#39;d heard rumors that a human boy was related to the great Fukushu, but I never expected it to be true.&quot; Another female kitsune said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s nothing, I heard from my husband that he saw the boy on the battlefield become a wolf, he even wielded a sword, can you believe that?&quot; The third woman said.<br />
<br />
&quot;After the last few days, I&#39;ll believe anything.&quot; The first woman said a her other two friends nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, come on, we need to get these supplies back to Chisai-san before nightfall.&quot; Hina said as Aaron snapped out of his trance. <br />
<br />
Listening to the women gossip, he almost couldn&#39;t believe it! His siblings were being hailed as war heroes, and apparently Mason could become a wolf now? Whenever he went back home, whenever that was, he would have to ask Mason about that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Hina, may I ask how you came into came int Unc....your uncle&#39;s shop? I was asking about you with Takeo.&quot; Aaron asked hoping the subject wouldn&#39;t be too sore to bring up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I....I am afraid I do not wish to say too much. But after....that...woman declared a civil war, many children were left without their parents who had either gone off to fight in the war, or been a victim of the war. Mine were....of the latter. But Chisai-san, Takeo-San, and Kiko-san have been very kind to me, I was worried no one would take me…” Hina explained.<br />
<br />
“Because of your age you mean?” Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
“Uh…y-yea.” She replied looking away from him. <br />
<br />
The Hunter didn’t press her further.<br />
<br />
“The last few days, they have shown me such kindness and love that I thought would never be seen again after the war.&quot; Hina explained as she gave a slight smile on her face.<br />
<br />
Aaron and Hina were coming back to Chisai&#39;s shop, he knew they would probably tell Hina who he was either soon or in due time. Either way, even if she wasn&#39;t related by blood, it would be nice to have her as part of the family, she seemed very kind and she definitely needed love after what she had gone through.</p>
