<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well now that we have that option out of the way,&quot; Tabra began, &quot;Who wants <br />
to take options-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Erica interrupted. <br />
<br />
Everyone looked at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I-I, I volunteer! For option three! You want me! You got me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Keiko looked at Erica in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did give you that option.&quot; Tabra said simply. She wouldn't ask if there was <br />
anyone else, she'd wait until after Erica had joined her and Luna. &quot;Are you <br />
sure Erica?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More than sure.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you scared?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of my wits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart young lady.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica actually let out a laugh. &quot;Heh, I remember, before Karther changed me, I <br />
was middle aged. So I'm not exactly young.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honest too. You ready?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can't be if I don't know what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then find out.&quot; 'I'll handle this one Janice, you've done enough for this part.' <br />
<br />
Then Tabra got surprised again. <br />
<br />
'No. I can handle it. Let me help. It's easier with two of us right?'<br />
<br />
 'Yes, it is.' <br />
<br />
To her credit, Erica stayed as rigid as stone as the senior angelic fox put her <br />
hands on her knowing from Luna to expect pain the likes of which she <br />
couldn't imagine. She was right.<br />
<br />
What amazed over half of the remaining vixens, was that after seeing Luna's <br />
change, that -anyone- would be willing to go through that themselves, <br />
regardless of their reasons or the possible rewards, and knowing that they'd <br />
be going now to fight against things that wanted them again as will less <br />
slaves or simply dead. <br />
<br />
For Erica the change was unlike anything she had ever felt, or wanted to feel, <br />
she felt the pain of course, and she screamed.  Some vixen's ears still sore <br />
from Luna's change felt anew as Erica underwent the same transformation. <br />
<br />
For Janice, she realized it felt easier this time, yes it left her weaker, like after <br />
a giving blood, but, she felt better for it, and she felt her strength rising up all <br />
the faster to compensate. Like somehow giving up part of this power, actually <br />
made her even stronger! It was illogical, totally, but then again, then again, <br />
Tabra did say this was based on emotion, and emotions were hardly logical. <br />
She could undo her own lock more quickly, and undid Erica's with more skill, <br />
and with less help from Tabra. Rather odd when she thought how hopeless <br />
he had been in retrofitting their body armor to their new shape. <br />
And after the angelic essence had finished being absorbed by Erica's spirit, <br />
Janice closed the doors and locked them perfectly. She actually, well, felt <br />
good about herself. Though she did feel like she had just run a mile.<br />
<br />
'How many more times can we do this?'<br />
<br />
'Not sure, not a ton, that's for sure.'<br />
<br />
'What if all my sisters chose to stay?' Janice thought hopefully.<br />
<br />
'Then we -will- be back at zero power like we were when we teleported away <br />
from Karther if not more. Though it'll take it less time than before to recharge <br />
since we've really just given the power to another rather than used it up.' <br />
<br />
Erica meanwhile, looked at the world around her with new eyes. She rubbed <br />
her forehead and felt an amethyst upward oval shaped gem. She knew what <br />
color it was by sheer instinct, as she knew her eyes were no violet. Looking at <br />
her fur, she quickly saw she was silver, a silver fox. Out of tradition rather than <br />
any sense of modest she folded her wings around herself, only then realizing <br />
she had them. She loved with very much the same grace and beauty as Luna, <br />
but at the same time... different. If Luna was the moon, then Erica was the <br />
moonshine. <br />
<br />
 She breathed in deep and told Janice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't thank me for anything.&quot; The angel fox said. &quot;You're going into a battle, <br />
and even afterwards, you'll never -ever- be able to go back to your old life or a <br />
normal one for that matter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erica just nodded. &quot;I understood that already.&quot; She said formally. <br />
<br />
Lisa chose to speak up, tripping over her own voice for a second, &quot;I, I'd like to <br />
hold on deciding until the very end.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Same.&quot; Viki spoke. This surprised Janice and the other vixens, Viki was <br />
normally the decisive one, it was unlike her to be hesitant in her choices, <br />
maybe she was just thinking this decision required a lot of thought. <br />
<br />
Tabra wished more people were like that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse.&quot; Keiko spoke out, &quot;What you said before, about, well, leaving it all <br />
behind, becoming well, what did you call them? Village deities? I think, I'd like <br />
to take on that role.&quot; <br />
<br />
Janice blinked, she didn't think for a second that anyone would want to take <br />
on -that- role, it just seemed so much like, giving up to her, even more so than <br />
going back to their loved ones, at least then they were still facing life. She <br />
always knew Keiko was a bite on the quiet side, maybe due to the japanese <br />
cultural idea that women were somehow supposed to be submissive. But <br />
didn't figure her for a quitter. <br />
<br />
'She was pulled into this, she didn't ask for this, she has every right to walk <br />
away and go the direction she choses.' Tabra told Janice. <br />
<br />
Anna put an arm surprisingly around Keiko's shoulder which surprised the <br />
japanese vixen. &quot;I'd like to join her on that!&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone looked at her. Anna waved her other arm. &quot;Now, don't go thinking <br />
I'm doing this out of sympathy for you Keiko, or I think you need watching after. <br />
But while I wasn't too happy about having my self being taken away, it was <br />
still, well, -fun- being with Karther, and now that I'm well, me again, I don't <br />
think I want to return working at a video store and being a weekend warrior.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabra didn't want her thinking this was a game, &quot;You'll have responsibilities <br />
no matter where you go in life, that's the way of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I know, but hey, I figure that -these- responsibilities might make my life <br />
more interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Keiko said, &quot;There is a curse about living in interesting times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's a curse I don't think I'll mind Keiko.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tabra said, &quot;I won't ask what your reason is Keiko, since it's only my business <br />
that you aren't doing this whim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Anna said, &quot;But for me, I'm just going with the one that sounds the <br />
most interesting, and.. sorry guys, but I think I'm just a coward. I don't want to <br />
face those monsters again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're smarter than you look then.&quot; Tabra commented. &quot;But you won't be able <br />
to return this to the store like you would a video game you've maxed out. Is <br />
this really what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Closest thing to it.&quot; Anna said simply. She then touched her breast feeling it <br />
up. &quot;Besides, I've already lost what made me a guy and a human being, might <br />
as well go all the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Keiko? Are you -sure-?&quot; Janice asked, not wanting any of her sisters to leave. <br />
<br />
Keiko just silently nodded. <br />
<br />
'I'll do Keiko while you do Anna if you wish.' Tabra offered.<br />
<br />
'Alright.' Janice agreed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd say this is going to hurt, a lot, but I'd be lying through my teeth, you'll barely <br />
feel anything unpleasant at all.&quot; She looked intently at them. &quot;Anna, let go of <br />
Keiko, both of you, please sit on the ground.&quot; <br />
<br />
Both vixens complied. <br />
<br />
'What now?' Janice asked. <br />
<br />
'Listen to my thoughts and memories. We bring the kitesune Karther put in <br />
them to the surface.' <br />
<br />
'And inside us?'<br />
<br />
'Not really, my angelic essence fused with the magic in the clone of Tammia's <br />
body she had made mine into, your soul got pulled out of hers into mine like <br />
skin from a badly removed bandage while your lifeforce remained in her <br />
body, basically eaten by it.'<br />
<br />
'So we really are one body with two souls rather than two persons in one <br />
body.'<br />
<br />
'Actually person and soul are the same thing, but that's besides the point here. <br />
And right now... we need to do as Keiko and Anna wish us to do.' <br />
<br />
'Do I have to?'<br />
<br />
'I can do it all by myself while you just watch, but it might make it harder for us <br />
later on.'<br />
<br />
'You're playing me...'<br />
<br />
'Actually I'm being honest. Playing people is what Opposite Number does.' <br />
<br />
Keiko looked scared but firm, while Anna looked expectantly, both of them at <br />
her. <br />
<br />
'Okay.' <br />
<br />
Tabra put her right hand on Keiko's forehead, while Janice put her left hand <br />
on Anna's. <br />
<br />
'Push your hand further, not physically, don't picture it, merely will your spirit to <br />
move in deeper into theirs, there you'll find it, feel it, virtues, sins, memories, <br />
feelings, instincts, conscience, all those things that make up a soul and bind it <br />
to a body. There, there that it's it! That's the one. The glowing sphere with a fox <br />
head and glowing tails, yes, it is familiar, it's what your body looked like just <br />
before Tammia devoured you. No, don't break your concentration. Relax. <br />
Relax. Calm. Gentle. Careful. Careful. Don't rip it out. Guide it out so it'll come <br />
out on it's own. Yes those pieces of sand around it are cracking, breaking up, <br />
dissolving into nothing, there, that's done. Now guide that part of them <br />
upwards, closer to the surface, don't break anything, don't damage anything, <br />
Don't try to force it past anything that it doesn't want to go through, steer it <br />
around it, gentle now! Like a living glass ball with tongues, yes Janice, yes <br />
that's perfect!'    <br />
<br />
 'Now don't hurry, almost there. Yes it's closer to the surface now, you're <br />
almost done, don't worry, just relax, keep your spirit on what you're guiding, <br />
don't let it get lost. You're it's light in the darkness, you're what's lighting the <br />
path for it, don't stray too far ahead now. Yes, good Janice, very good, you've <br />
just about done it. It's right below the surface, now let it get there the rest of the <br />
way. Now let it get settled in, let everything else find it's new niche. It's settling <br />
in, back out slowly, don't strike anything on your way out, now good, good! <br />
Just about, -done-.' <br />
<br />
'Well done Janice.'<br />
<br />
Janice started a bit. 'What just happened?'<br />
<br />
'You were able to tap into my memories without forcing it, -very- good. It's like <br />
a dad teaching his son how to ride a bicycle, I just needed to get you focused <br />
enough, the rest was all you.' <br />
<br />
Janice looked down at the True Kitesune that now lay in front of her, that had <br />
been, still -were- her sisters. <br />
<br />
Keiko and Anna had both felt someone kindly and politely enter their souls, <br />
properly greeting themselves first and walking in rather than barging. Then <br />
they had felt he presence have a nice look around, avoiding looking at <br />
anything that was mark private, and kindly asking for directions around the <br />
place. Then the presence had gone into the basement, and had come out <br />
holding a glowing white ball with a fox head and a bunch of little cute tails and <br />
had handed it to them. <br />
<br />
Keiko felt herself giggle it felt fuzzy, funny, warm, kinda happy too, rather like a <br />
child. She felt like a great weight had just been lifted off her. Her spirits felt so <br />
much lighter. <br />
<br />
Keiko didn't think she needed any lessons in her native language, but the <br />
slight variants, and nuances, of different regions poured into her mind and <br />
found their place alongside her other memories.<br />
<br />
 Anna received a full fledge language course of all three main variants of the <br />
japanese language, child, adult, and formal, along with the different kanji and <br />
figures of speech, it became as natural to her as english, even more so as <br />
English suddenly felt more like her second language. <br />
<br />
Both girls felt rituals, their meanings, purpose, and styles fill them. Of what <br />
people feared about kitesune, what they hoped of them, and what, (they both <br />
giggled at this) what they didn't have a clue about! Both girls also realized <br />
they wouldn't mind some saki while they were at it. Of course Keiko was <br />
thinking of enjoy it, while Anna was thinking of downing it and enjoying the <br />
after effects. <br />
<br />
Keiko thought of the nice things she could do for people when their heads <br />
were turned, while Anna thought of the games she could get kids to play with <br />
her and on each other. <br />
<br />
But while both knew the mystique a minor deity needed, both knew they <br />
wouldn't be content to sit in some shrine as humans came to bargain with <br />
them for favor, they, would walk among them whenever possible, in disguise <br />
or otherwise. <br />
<br />
Keiko felt a feather tickle the inside of her chest, she giggled again, doubts <br />
and fears melted from her mind, and for a moment, she forgot fear.  Anna <br />
pictured woods, mist, no DVD players, no video games, no TV, no cell phones <br />
signals, no internet, and... and... she... she realized she didn't mind. <br />
<br />
The four remaining vixens were expecting a light show like with Erica and <br />
Luna, instead, Keiko and Anna glowed ever so slowly, almost goldenly. <br />
Before their eyes, more tails grew from their hips, their breasts pulled inwards <br />
as extra nipples formed on their chests. Their heads became more sleek, their <br />
sand armor just, vanished, along with their weapons. Their hands became <br />
like their paws, and their tails grew larger even as their bodies lost mass. <br />
<br />
When it was over, what they saw weren't just foxes with extra tails. these were <br />
majestic creatures, with a shine to their fur no mundane animal could have, <br />
their fur and tails moved with an invisible breeze. Their golden and amber <br />
eyes opened and they showed an intelligence and intent complex and <br />
inscrutable. One wore a slight smirk and the other a slightly mischievous grin. <br />
When they moved, it reminded the vixens of a leaf on a breeze. They both <br />
bore no less than five tails. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heh... heheheh.&quot; The kitesune who was Anna giggled. &quot;I finally get it.&quot; <br />
<br />
No one asked what it was she finally got. <br />
<br />
The kitesune who was Keiko stood on all fours and looked up at the senior <br />
vixen. &quot;I'm not scared anymore. I'm... excited.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;'Bout time!&quot; Anna shot back at her. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was half expecting them to come out barking.&quot; Charlene thought out loud. <br />
<br />
Anna turned and swayed closer to Charlene. &quot;I wouldn't be much of a magic <br />
mythical fox if I couldn't spout out cryptic obscure words of mystery now would <br />
I?&quot; She raised an eye brow. <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't think they'd become four legged foxes.&quot; Barbera said her eyes a little <br />
wide. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; The senior fox angel said in a slightly stern tone. &quot;Did you think that <br />
kitesune really looked like the fox women on all the yiff sites?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Said Anna with a perfectly straight face with no hint of malice or anger <br />
or agitation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not really.&quot; Replied Keiko formally, the two kitesune looked at each other.</p>
