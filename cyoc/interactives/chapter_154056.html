<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The same pain woke her up moments later. However it was finally waning and Jen sat up as quickly as soon as she was wake up. She felt the hot pain radiating from the inside of her mouth. She felt around her mouth with her tongue, but gasped loudly and whimpered as suddenly she felt an unfamiliar sense of inside of her mouth. It felt more vertical and more narrow. Moreover, also her tongue felt so swollen, filling the enlarged space. Even her teeth were bigger! Their sudden growth, along with the jaw bones must have been what made her pass out with pain. <br />
<br />
She clasped her hands on her cheeks, eyes filling with tears and fear. She felt the unfamiliar shape of the face with her palms, her fingers feeling the almost sunken cheeks, but significantly prolonged face, her actual mouth protruding almost 1 cm beyond her face. It was grotesque, nobody has ever looked like this, not even with all the plastic surgery. Her lips still felt the same though, so that was a relief. But not for long - as she felt all this in a moment after she woke up, but the process still continued. She watched, shocked, as her face continued to change, with slow growth over what seemed like an absolute forever, but was actually closer to 15 minutes. <br />
<br />
Jens mouth continued to grow, prolonging and enlarging with no more bone supporting them and started to droop downwards, swelling. Her jaw stopped prolonging, but made up for it with swelling and thicking, her teeth getting bulkier also. She started somehow losing her lips, their original texture and color disappearing. It was as if her whole mouth started losing color and it spread. As she still considered this to be a sudden illness or mutation or whatever, she didn&#39;t recognize the resemblance of animal she was cursed with - but the slight shiver of her nose meant she was about to receive a painful clue. <br />
<br />
Her nose first swell, as she crossed her eyes, bulging them, staring at it. It enlarged slowly, but forcefully. She felt the inside flow bigger better as it grew bigger. Her nasal cavity was getting more wide and allowed more air flow, almost getting her hyperventilate. Even through her panic, she forced herself take slower breaths. As her nostrils almost got 5 centimeters wide and her nose was swelled significantly, it started to slowly droop with its own weight! It rested on her new big lips and she felt as they slowly started conjoining, the seam between them disappearing. The nose grew more and more to all directions, past her mouth, merging with the lip wholly.<br />
<br />
She sobbed quietly and helplessly, still with hands on her face, feeling how her own body betrays her and changes. The more she tried pushing on her face, trying to make the growth stop, the more the feeling of the flesh made her realize that this was actually happening. Her nose was prolonging, now at proud 10 centimeters, hanging from her face. She felt its weight and how it was rocking slightly. And she breathed trough it. Her nose...trunk? Nose! Oh my god - <i>nose</i> kept growing, thicker and in length. She saw how it got more and more desaturated and how also her mouth kept adapting to support the top of her...trunk. <br />
<br />
Jen froze as she realized she not only felt all the external sensations from her the new lower part of her face, but she also started to feel its movement and that she could even control it. She flexed the unfamiliar muscles and the trunk started slowly lifting. When she tried to move her nostrils, they did, same as before, but the movement was bigger and..farther. As Jen lifted the <i>trunk</i> fully in the level of her eyes, it&#39;s length around 20 centimeters, she <i>watched</i> her nostrils move, the whole big mass of them - she could fill her one hand with them. Her hand shot out and promptly did, she held the thing in her grasp. Her mouth stayed open when her nose was held up, as there were now no human lips to keep it close, her bottom lip swollen and hanging freely. The skin was getting thicker and more rough and longer hairs started to appear.<br />
<br />
Finally, two of her her teeth painfully surged ahead and left her jaw bone. It made her cry out loudly, the walls returning her desperate wail, jumping out on the floor, but still sitting. <i>They got massive</i>, long and thick, maybe 1,5 cm in diameter. Her gums felt insanely hot and sensitive, but kept on adapting the her new bone structure, still pushing her two new *tusks* forward. They got around 10 cm long, starting to arch upwards. She felt as their top got enveloped in the top park of the trunk, now massive and hanging from her face as she let it go, now dangling.<br />
<br />
Jennifer now saw what it actually was, now without any doubt. A trunk on her face. No, the trunk <i>was</i> her face. Her nose was a trunk. This couldn&#39;t have possibly ever happen and yet it happened right now. She started at it, eyes still wide, breathing through the tube. She was sliding her hands along it and moved the trunk slightly against them, feeling the new skin on its full length. She gripped it, the top hand not even encasing its circumference. She was touching it, but still with terror. She realized that this must have been caused by the ridiculous curse said by Kyle. Kyle <i>did</i> this to her. Kyle made her grow a trunk - this was insane.<br />
<br />
She had hoped that at least this was the worst of it - could even some time in the future become manageable. But this size was still possibly proportionate to the size of the human face. Unfortunately, Kyle made sure that never happened. Her new foreign lower half of face kept growing.</p>
