<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When “Faith” awakens it’s early morning, ‘I feel much better,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I don’t know what was wrong with me yesterday, but I feel like myself again. I wonder when my owner will arrive, she does need to fill up my food and water, and let me out onto the pasture for the day’.<br />
<br />
Just as “Faith” finishes thinking this, the door to the barn opens and Valerie enters, “morning, Faith,” the pink haired girl says cheerfully, stepping up to the stall, “I hope you had a pleasant night, let me take you to the pasture. I’ve already filled your drinking trough and you can eat some nice fresh green grass!”<br />
<br />
“Faith” lets out an exciting neigh, causing Valerie to laugh, ‘looks like “Jeff” is no longer himself, he is 100% MY Horse, hehe,’ she thinks to herself, ‘good thing I’ve fixed the pasture and used the App to conjure up a drinking trough filled with water. I can’t wait to ride her after school and start training her for all the Horse races’.<br />
<br />
Valerie leads “Faith” onto the pasture where the “Horse” immediately starts gracing, the girl grins and simply walks away, needing to get to school, ‘I wonder if anyone is already missing Jeff,’ she thinks to herself.<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, “Luis” awakens, the “child” stretches and yawns, sitting up in bed and looking around, an evil grin on his young face, “mmm… this body fits me perfectly,” he says to himself, “hehe… thanks Luis, I’ll promise to take care of your family… especially your brother-turned-mare… hehe!”<br />
<br />
“LUIS, GET YOUR LAZY ASS OUT OF BED,” he then hears his “dad” call, “YOU’LL BE LATE FOR SCHOOL… AGAIN!!”<br />
<br />
“Luis” smirks, ‘he… no school anymore for this “boy”,’ he thinks to himself, “COMING,” he then calls, then jumps out of bed and hurries into the bathroom to get himself ready and enjoy his naked human form.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile at Jeff’s school, Valerie is sitting in class, no one seems to be missing Jeff, ‘he… I guess they are all simply assuming he’s skipping school,’ the girl thinks to herself, ‘hehe… if only they knew!’<br />
<br />
Back at the Ranch, “Faith” is enjoying the warm weather, ‘this is the life,’ she thinks to herself, ‘but it is so lonely, I wish there were other Horses around to keep me company’.<br />
<br />
“Luis” meanwhile has been dropped off at his school by his father, the boy waves his dad “good-bye” as the man speeds off in his blue Corvette, “what a show off,” the “boy” mumbles, grinning, ‘now, I have some place to be. A certain “mare” is waiting to get knocked up by a handsome Stallion! Hehe,’ he thinks to himself and with one snap of his fingers, the “boy” vanishes, reappearing at the entrance to the abandoned Ranch. The Demon smirks, “good thing we Demons have such powerful magic, especially a Demon who is as powerful as me, hehe… which is only thanks to the people who have conjured me and the years of absorbing negative energies of the humans who once lived here! Hehe! Now, as a human, I am even more powerful! Nothing and no one will ever stop me! I think I need a talk with that Valerie girl… if she really is as evil as I assume she is… hehe… we’d make the perfect rulers of this world and the universe! For now though: I’ve let “Faith” wait long enough to, time for some fun,” with that the “boy” walks up the path and towards the pasture, following the “Mare’s” energy.<br />
<br />
When “Luis” Arrives at the fence of the pasture the “boy” grins, ‘looks like this Valerie girl has fixed up the old pasture,’ he thinks to himself, he then jumps over the barbed fence, which, if he’d been a normal boy, wouldn’t have managed, but since he’s a Demon he is able to do anything, even in his young human form.<br />
<br />
Once inside the pasture, the “boy” wastes no time and strips out of his clothes, the now naked “child” then gets down onto his hands, bending his legs and standing on his toes. “Luis” eyes then start to glow red, the “boy” grins evilly as black fur starts to grow from his body. The boy’s black hair takes on a mohawk style and grows down his neck which lengthens and thickens as his face pushes out into a muzzle. His ears become pointy and move to the top of his head, a black tail slowly grows from his behind as his body starts to grow, his muscles becoming bigger, his arms and legs taking on a more Horse-like appearance as his hands and feet become hooves with horseshoes nailed to them, the eyes of the “Stallion” stop glowing and take on a nice hazelnut brown. Grinning evilly to himself, the Stallion says, “now to find “Faith”! Hehe,” with that he trots across the pasture towards “Faith’s” energy.<br />
<br />
“Faith” is eating some grass when she hears something moving towards her, when she turns her head she sees an magnificent, almost majestic, black Horse trotting towards her, ‘hu? Who’s that? I’ve never seen him around, but… damn… what a handsome stud,’ she thinks to herself, ‘did my owner get a new Horse to keep me company? Why hasn’t she told me? Maybe… maybe she wanted it to be a surprise?’<br />
<br />
Thanks to Valerie’s editing, Jeff doesn’t remember who he truly is, he totally believes that he had always been a mare.<br />
<br />
When the “Stallion” approaches “Faith” he starts to sniff at her curiously, like a normal Horse would do, “Faith” herself sniff at the Stallion, when they lock eyes the “Stallion’s” eyes start to suddenly glow red, and before “Faith” has any chance of reacting she finds herself unable to look away.<br />
<br />
The “Stallion” grins, ‘what a weak mind,’ he thinks to himself, ‘she still has her human mind, but I can sense that she thinks she had always been a mare. Let’s keep her human mind, but I should at least give her the instincts of a real mare and cause her to go into heat. I’ll also make her be affected by male Horse pheromones’.<br />
<br />
“Faith” suddenly feels weird, her body starts feeling warm and her virgin pussy starts to itch, quiver, swell and become moist, these feeling only become worse when she starts inhaling the “Stallion’s” pheromones.<br />
<br />
The “Stallion’s” eyes stop glowing and he grins, knowing that the “Mare” is ready, ‘then, let’s pop your cheery… JEFF! HAHAHA! Getting fucked by your baby brother as a Stallion! HEHE! I bet you never thought this day would come, eh,’ he thinks to himself, before walking behind the “Mare” and wastes no time as he jumps onto his hind legs and wrapping his front legs around “Faith’s” waist.<br />
<br />
“Luis” then starts to hump, after a few failed attempts he and “Faith” both suddenly let out triumphant neighs as his cock finally plunges into the “Mare’s” hot and needy pussy and the “Stallion” starts thrusting in and out of her in an animalistic way.<br />
<br />
As he thrusts in and out of “Faith”, the Demon lets out nickers, which sound almost like laughter, before he says, “how does it feel, “Faith”? Getting fucked by such a handsome and strong beast? I bet it feels amazing… HAHAHA,” he thrusts wildly in and out of the “Mare”, who is totally overcome by the huge pleasure rippling through her body, “thanks to you and your friend Valerie, I finally have found a way to not only hide in plain sight as a “human child”, but I’m also able to have females, animals AND humans, birth my demonic offspring! Haha… soon, this world and the whole universe will belong to me AND my queen Valerie! And YOU, just like all the other weak humans, will be nothing more than our good little obedient toys! Haha!”<br />
<br />
“Faith” isn’t paying any attention what the “Stallion” is saying, all she can think off is that amazing huge Horse cock thrusting in and out of her, ‘f-fuck… he’s so big,’ she thinks to herself, ‘it… it feels amazing! A part of me though seems… to not like it… but I do, and THAT is what counts!’<br />
<br />
The Demon himself is in heaven… or rather hell… as he enjoys the feeling of the “Mare’s” pussy clench around him. “Luis” grins as he feels himself getting close, “get ready, “Faith”, to take my seed,” he says, thrusting faster and harder into the “Mare”, “MY children, who you WILL birth, will all have powers equal to mine! Like me… they’ll be able to shape shift, transform anyone and anything into what THEY decide suits, whoever they curse, the best and they’ll be unstoppable, like me and… hopefully… my QUEEN Valerie! Hehe… you’ll help me create an army of demons with unlimited powers! Now… take my cum. ALL. OF. IT,” with one final thrust, “Luis” rams his cock deep into “Faith”, BOTH neighing in triumph as BOTH cum.<br />
<br />
When “Luis” finishes, he dismounts “Faith” and walks to her side, grinning when he notices the “Mare’s” eyes fogged over from the pleasure. The “Stallion” leans in and whispers in her ear, “good girl, “Faith”. You’ll make a great mother to my children, no matter if you’re human or animal! I promise, my dear, as long as you play by MY and Valerie’s rules, you’ll have nothing to fear. Me and my children will protect you and keep you safe from any harm,” he then give “Faith” a lick, “I’ll see you soon, my dear,” he then says, and with a evil grin the “Stallion” turns and walks away, leaving a dazed “Mare” standing alone in the pasture.<br />
<br />
It takes a while for “Faith” to regain her senses, ‘wh-what happened,’ she thinks to herself, ‘I feel as if my mind has been shut off, and that I missed something. Oh well,’ with that “Faith” gets back to her grazing.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, “Luis” has transformed back into a 10-year-old boy and put his clothes back on, “that was fun,” he says to himself, “fucking “my” “big bro” as a Stallion! Hehe! Now, what damage can I do next? I could go to “school” and have some fun there, or I could head to a church and have some “fun” with a priest. I also could seek out that Valerie girl, hmmm… how should I decide?”</p>
