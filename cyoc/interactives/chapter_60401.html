<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Around 7:30P.M, somewhere within the back compound lays Isaiah in a small yet cozy room still unconscious from earlier. Alongside him sits Lester on watch as ordered by his father. Lester, being a big fan of manga, decides to pass the time by catching up on the latest chapter of his favorite shounen. Eventually, he grew tired of reading and decides to liven up the atmosphere. He takes off his brown leather jacket, puts on some gloves and begins to air box within the room. Although not the most athletic of people; he inspires to shed a few pounds before his senior graduation. Left, Right, Left, Right; Lester manages to build up quite a sweat within a relatively short period of time. He begins to get really engaged and starts weaving around as if he were really fighting. However, being as clumsy as he is, he ends up tripping onto the couch where Isaiah rests and falls to the ground.<br />
<br />
“FUCK! Dag Nabbit!!” he yells in pain while shaking his hand. Apparently while falling, his fist ended up smacking against the hard coffee table.<br />
<br />
The pain of being crushed by a 210lbs male causes Isaiah to finally come to. Seemingly suffering from a headache, he clutches his head and begins to moan loudly. <br />
 <br />
Lester notices Isaiah and gets off the floor while continuing to shake his hand in pain. He then makes his way over to his jacket, pulls out a can of special chaw from one of the pockets, and then grabs a small plastic cup from a table before handing both to Isaiah. “Here.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah squints his eyes open, looks up at Lester, then turns his head over to the cup and can. “nnhuh…? What?”<br />
“Look fella, jus’ take the can and cup. You’ll be needin’ thems now.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah feels his chest beginning to churn again as he eerily glares at the can. Lester drops it on his chest and Isaiah slowly twists it open. The minty scent of a freshly opened can of chaw lingers under his nose and retriggers Isaiah’s lust for tobacco. Without a moment’s hesitation, he sits up and shoves some of the contents into his mouth. It took no time for the minty flavor and nicotine to spread throughout his system as he grinds the leaves against his teeth.<br />
<br />
“Here’s yer spittin’ cup,” says Lester as he sets the cup on the coffee table. He then retrieves his jacket and book. “From now on, that there’s yer own chaw.” Lester swings his jacket over his shoulder and makes his way to the door. “Don’tju dirty up this floor wit’ yer juice heer? Ah’m headin’ off to tha can.” <br />
<br />
Isaiah didn’t utter a response. He continues to look down at the floor in sadness as he slowly chews. <br />
<br />
Lester looks back and pauses for a bit before leaving the room. Once he left, the dismal teen gaze heavily at the small can in his hand. “This stuff? This is mine?” he thought as he turns the can a bit. “Why? Why do “I” need “this”? Why am I craving this so much now? I should just throw this shit across the room but… I can’t. No; it’s more like I won’t. Why won’t I!? Somehow, it feels like something deep in me is telling me no. Something big and fierce; something like…-” An image of that guy he dreamt about flashes within his head. He clutches the can and begins shaking in fear. “I… I need to get hell outta here. Something’s goin’ to happen to me; I know it…!”<br />
<br />
Isaiah closes the can, puts it in his pocket, and begins putting his socks and shoes on. He was so focused on leaving that he neglects to realize he spat his juice directly into the cup beside him. It wasn’t until he got up and grabs it that he noticed. <br />
<br />
He rushes out the door, turns the corner, but then accidentally bumps into someone. “Hey, watch where your-,” he pauses as he looks up to see’s Monty’s angry face glaring down. <br />
<br />
“Outta tha way!” he yells as he easily punts Isaiah aside. Monty is completely bare but had a large elaborately designed towel wrapped around his waist. He’s also dripping wet and looks as if he just got out of a shower. Isaiah couldn’t help but eye the hairy tattooed man from head to toe.“Eh!? Ya askin’ fer a death wish or sumthin’ punk? Git!”<br />
<br />
Isaiah snaps out of his trance and continues down the hallway where he ends up in a very spacious gym. He stops and views the few males around him exercising. “The hell…? This place some kind of fitness center or something?” As he skims around, his eye catches upon a smoothly toned guy bench pressing a heavy set of weights. His train of thought ceases as he gawks at the man’s great display of strength. He looked to be in his late 20s and was perspiring heavily as his gray t-shirt was drenched in sweat. He shook his head and really starts to worry as he somehow feels aroused. “What the hell’s with me…?,” he ponders as he looks back at the guy. “I-I really need to get away from here.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah catches the exit across the gym but then sees the scruffy guy who gave him his chew coming his way. He searches around for a hiding place but was too late as the guy calls for him. “Oh hey!” he shouts as he approaches Isaiah. “So this where ya been at. Whatcha doin’ out heer fer?”<br />
<br />
“I… uh, um… Look. I really need to go find my friends.” Isaiah tries to bypass but is stopped by the guy.<br />
<br />
“Woah uh uh, no can do. Pops told me ah havta keep an eye on ya ‘til he gets back.”<br />
<br />
“Hey, just lay off of me!” he yells which catches the attention of a couple of guys around him.<br />
<br />
Lester wraps his arm around Isaiah’s neck and forcefully moves him back into the hallway. “Shhh! Hush now dangit! Ya tryin’ ta make a scene or sumthin’?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah was really getting irritated.<br />
<br />
Lester sighs. “Right... Listen heer fella, yer body’s  goin’ thru sum stuff right ‘bout now and if’n ah let ya leave this place, yer gunna end up knockin’ on devil’s door.”<br />
<br />
“What does that mean!? Is that some kind of threat!?” <br />
<br />
“Keep yer britches on pal, I ain’t meant it like that.” Lester crosses his arms. “Hey, me an’ pa’s gunna help ya out tha best we can ahright? Yer jes’ gun’ haveta put sum trust into us… okay?” <br />
<br />
Isaiah didn’t reply and just stood there with a grim look on his face. <br />
<br />
Lester then pats the worried teens shoulder. “Don’tju worry now, eveh’thang’s gun’ be ahright. Ya hav’ mah word.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah spits in his cup and takes a deep breath. “…Okay, but can I at least call my mom please?”<br />
<br />
“Shure thing, c’meer.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah follows him to a phone on the wall and begins dialing. Although his mom didn’t pick up, her VMS came on. Isaiah recalls his mom saying she had to work over tonight. He leaves her a message telling her where he is, that he’ll be home late, and then finishes up by saying “I love you.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah sighs before turning back to Lester. “So now what…? You gonna tell me what’s going on, or are you just gonna stand there with that dumb grin on your face?”<br />
<br />
“Geez, sumone’s ill as a hornet...” He puts his hand out in gesture. “Tha name’s Lester Maxwell. Ya ahready met mah pa earlier. Ah’m his lil’ boy.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah hesitates for a bit, but eventually reaches out and shakes Lester’s hand. “Name’s Isaiah and… I’m... OW!” He thrusts away his hand in pain.<br />
<br />
Lester had gripped Isaiah’s hand a little too tightly. “Haha! Sorry ‘bout that. Jes’ checkin’ ta see how strong ya are.”<br />
<br />
“Right…,” mumbles Isaiah as he gives him a nasty look, “So out with it; what’s happening to me and what does your dad want?”<br />
<br />
“Pa said he be needin’ ta ask ya sumthin’ real important. He ain’t here though, so he wanted me to take care o’ ya til he gits back.” Lester glances at a poster of a sauna on the wall. “Hey, how ‘bouts we hit sum steam together while we wait fer mah pa. Ah’ll tell ya all tha rest afterwards.”<br />
<br />
“Steam?”<br />
<br />
“Y’know, a bathhouse pal. Geez.”<br />
<br />
“Why is there a bathhouse all the way out here…?”<br />
<br />
“Heh, do ya need ta ask?” he implies. “Mah pa is one loaded ol’ man. He don’t know what to do wit’ all his money,” he replies. “C’mon, we might as well git to know each other sum til’ he gits back. Lester motions for Isaiah to walk ahead of him making sure he doesn’t try to escape.<br />
<br />
While walking, Isaiah happens to remember all those rumors he heard about gays bathhouses. He begins having second thoughts before coming to a complete stop. “Naw, forget it. I ain’t going. Don’t take it the wrong way, but goin’ to a gay bathhouse doesn’t sit too well with me.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, one o’ them fellas huh? Relax buddy, I ain’t gunna bite. ‘Sides, it’ll help gitch yer mind off things.”<br />
<br />
“Look, can we just go somewhere else?,” he asks angrily. <br />
<br />
Just then, Isaiah sees the man he was watching from before approach from behind. A towel hangs around his neck while he carries a Nike duffle bag and slurps on a large Slushee.<br />
<br />
The man’s bag accidentally punts Lester in the back as he makes his way through. “Hey! Watch it,” says Lester.<br />
“Ah my bad man,” apologizes the guy as he continues walking. Telling by his voice, Isaiah knew he must’ve been from the city.<br />
<br />
The man’s sweaty musk fills the air as he walks pass which causes Isaiah to catch a whiff of his scent. He became mesmerized by his odor and beams closely at the man’s rear as he walks off. Lester glimpses over, chuckles, and softly punches his shoulder. “Heheh. Caught yer eye on sumthin’ buddy?”<br />
 <br />
“Huh?” replies Isaiah as he comes to. He couldn’t believe he actually stared at that guy’s behind in such a way. <br />
<br />
“Anahways, ah guess I can’t help it. Ah ain’t gun’ force ya ta come if’n ya don’t want.” Lester begins walking off in the opposite direction. “Let’s wait fer mah pa in that one room then.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll… go…” mumbles Isaiah.<br />
<br />
Lester turns around and scratches in his ear. “Eh? Didn’t hear ya.”<br />
<br />
“I said I’ll go alright…! Just promise you won’t try to hit on me!”<br />
<br />
“Hm? Ah promise but why tha change all ‘o sudden?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah sighs as he was starting to get a migraine. “Fuck man, I don’t know...,” He places his palm on his forehead and shakes his head. “Everything feels so weird right now.” Hoping to calm himself, he pulls out his can of chaw, twists it open, and stuffs more tobacco in his mouth.<br />
<br />
“Well ahright, les’ keep at it then,” says Lester as he turns around and punts Isaiah to go ahead. <br />
Soon after, they arrive at the front desk of the bath house. Lester keeps ringing the bell for service while Isaiah sits on a bench and scans the surrounding area. Figuring he would find lots of gays everywhere, he was surprised to see the place was actually pretty barren. There wasn’t much bear memorabilia around and if it wasn’t for the lube and condom concession stand, the place could pass as ordinary. He hears Monty and that guy from before laughing as they chat about sports in the locker room.<br />
<br />
“Dangit, where tha hale’s service ‘round here!?” yells Lester as he rings the bell once again.<br />
<br />
“Hold on. Hold on. I’m coming,” echoed someone as they entered the room behind the counter.<br />
<br />
Upon noticing the attendant, Isaiah eyes instantly widen and he gasps. “Holy shit, a woman.”<br />
<br />
Lester laughs. “Whadya think? We only hire guys?”<br />
<br />
“But she’s the ONLY one I’ve seen here!”<br />
<br />
“Lemme ask ya, do ya REALLY think that there’s a woman?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah caught the hint and didn’t know what to say.<br />
<br />
“I heard that!” she yells as she threw a pen at Lester’s head.<br />
<br />
“Heeey! Been a long time Suzy. How’s yer daddy doin’?”<br />
<br />
Suzy crosses her arms. “Aren’t you going to ask how I’ve been doing!?”<br />
<br />
“Ah would, but zoo animals tend ta keep to their cage and don’t really do much.”<br />
<br />
“HA. HA. Bravo!” she says in a highly sarcastic tone. “Which website you steal that lame joke from? Y’know what? I don’t care; fuck you. I really hope you didn’t come here for a room ‘cause you’re not gettin’ one.”<br />
<br />
“Aw’ c’mon babe! Ah’m jus messin’ wit ya! Ya know ya ahways been mah shugar dumplin’!”<br />
<br />
“Pfff, please!”<br />
<br />
“Wait---,” interrupts Isaiah. “You 2 were actually a couple?”<br />
<br />
“As bad as ah hate ta admit it, yep.” Lester puts his mouth up close to Isaiah’s ear. “Jus’ between you an’ me, she’s the reason why I became gay.”<br />
<br />
“Oooh---”<br />
<br />
“There you go, talking about me in front of my face again. Who’s the cutie pie there next to you anyway; your next victim?”<br />
<br />
Lester wraps his arm around Isaiah and forcefully pulls him close. “Awe---! You jealous? Sorry gal, butcha can’t have him!”<br />
<br />
“What!? Get off me!!” shouts Isaiah as he slips away from Lester’s grasp. “It ain’t like that!”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I didn’t know you were in to black guys like that. I thought you hated them?”<br />
<br />
Lester’s joyous front instantly shifts into a complete 180. “Look woman. Jus’ shut yer mouth and gimme a damn key!”<br />
<br />
“Ouuu. Someone’s a little touchy.” She walks to the back, grabs a key, and tosses it to Isaiah. “Here cutie, that key is YOURS. Don’t you dare give it to this cow here alright?” <br />
<br />
“Um, okay…”<br />
<br />
Lester kicks the counter, grabs some towels, and then motions for Isaiah to follow so they can change. Isaiah was bothered by what Suzy said and wonders if Lester’s super friendly attitude is just a front.<br />
<br />
Before entering the Locker room, Lester stops and turns around. “Hey, don’t listen to anythang that golddigger says. I’ma be truthful wit ya, theres been a time where I did felt that way, but ah’ve learned not to judge fellas by their skin color. It’s another them aspects in life I really regret. Yer one o’ mah buds now, and ah treat all mah pals tha same way heer?” Lester balls his fist and sticks it in front of him.<br />
<br />
Although a bit straightforward, Isaiah felt really impressed by Lester’s show of honesty and starts to respect him a bit. He seems committed to the fact that he’s seeing him as who he is and not by his skin color and that relieves him quite a bit. Isaiah smirks and bats Lester, fist to fist.<br />
<br />
“Well, thanks for bein’ honest about it I guess. To tell you the truth, I’m still a bit uneasy hangin’ wit’ ya. Although, I’m startin’ to see you’re a pretty swell guy.”<br />
<br />
Lester grins. “Psh stop it, yer makin’ mah cheeks red.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah chuckles slightly and then spits more juice into his cup. “Anyways, what’s with that laugh of hers…?”<br />
<br />
“Sheit, ya figger that was bad? Wait ‘til ya here her squeal in bed.”<br />
<br />
As they enter, Isaiah catches Monty and that one guy being awfully rambunctious as they argue about football. In fact, they were so entwined in their conversation; they didn’t seem to notice the 2 of them as they sat on the opposite side of the locker room. Lester tosses a towel to Isaiah and begins kicking his shoes off. Isaiah on the other hand couldn’t take his eyes off the guy arguing with Monty across the way. He watches in marvel as the man slowly discards his t-shirt and reveals his chiseled pecs and abs. Unlike Monty, his chest was smooth as a baby’s bottom while his abs sports a light brown treasure trail. Isaiah starts to get highly nervous as he can feel his member slowly erecting. “Hey Lester, is there a place where I can change with some privacy?” <br />
<br />
“Pf, don’t be such a wuss. Ain’t no one gun’ look at ya. Shucks, them 2 muscle-heads over yonder’s the only ones here ‘sides us.”<br />
<br />
“I know, but…-” <br />
<br />
“Fer cryin’ out loud… Look, there’s a restroom wit’ stalls behind me if’n ya ain’t man ‘nough.” <br />
<br />
“Tch. If you put it that way, I’ll stay.” Isaiah turns around and begins discarding his clothes one by one onto the floor. As Isaiah discards his shirt, he couldn’t help but flex his right arm and smirk. “Of course I’m man enough,” he says confidently. While pulling down his jeans and boxers, Isaiah incidentally stares at that guy again. No matter how hard he tries, Isaiah couldn’t take his eyes off that man as he casually removes his boxers and unveils his gorgeous tight rear. To Isaiah, it was as if the clouds had pass to reveal the light of the full moon. Unlike his chest, his bottom coats a full display of exquisite brown fur. Monty smacks the guy’s rear with his towel causing the man to hiss in pain, turn around, and curse him out. Isaiah caught a small glimpse of the guy’s rod but quickly turns his head away and blushes as he could take no more.“Dammit, why am I actin’ like this...!? I ain’t gay!” Isaiah discards his boxers, looks down and glimpses upon evidence that supports quite the contrary. “Naw, fuck this!” shrieks Isaiah as he backs up and cowers himself against the wall.<br />
<br />
Lester discards the last of his own clothing, turns, and sees Isaiah in a state of panic. “Hey buddy, what’s tha matter?” <br />
<br />
Isaiah looks in horror as the 210lbs bear approaches him. Not only does Lester exhibit a full spread of chest hair, he even has hair along his shoulder pads as well. Isaiah felt disgusted yet also enticed by the amount of body hair Lester has for someone his age. “Stay back! Don’t come near me!” shrieks Isaiah as he eyes Lester’s plump member freely swaying between his thighs. <br />
<br />
Although very concerned, Lester is surprised to see Isaiah sporting a fully erect penis; it was even dripping with precum. “Uuuwee,” whistles lester,“Black fellas shure are blessed.”<br />
  <br />
Monty and his friend walk over to see what all the commotion is about. “Ha! Well sheit, if it isn’t tha lil’ punk from before,” observes Monty as he laughs and softly kicks him.<br />
<br />
Now surrounded by 3 naked guys, Isaiah could no longer control his mixed emotions and flees into the restroom.<br />
“Woah, what’s his problem?” asks the guy. <br />
<br />
Lester punches Monty in the shoulder. “Tha fuck’s wrong wit’ you man? Whyja do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Monty retaliates by shoving his hand atop Lester’s head and then roughly shuffles his hair. “Oh hey! Didn’t see ya there lil cus’. Why’s that punk in here fer?” <br />
<br />
“It ain’t none of yer business,” replies Lester as he knocks Monty’s hand off him. He then pushes him aside and follows after Isaiah.<br />
<br />
Monty sneers and wipes the dirt off his chest. “Psh! Whatever…”<br />
<br />
“Ha! You see the boner that kid had bro?” mentions the guy, “He must really like your cousin or something.”<br />
<br />
“Psheheheh!,” Monty laughs conceitedly. “Tha lil’ runt thought he be all tough by callin’ me a fag, but ends up bein’ a faggot himself.” Monty picks up Isaiah’s clothes off the floor, walks back to his gym bag, and stuffs the clothes inside it. <br />
<br />
The guy follows Monty and asks, “Aww Dude. C'mon...”<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong? I’m only jus’ takin’ his clothes fer a bit. ‘Sides, ain’t nutin’ wrong bein’ bare-skinned in this bathhouse.”<br />
<br />
The guy shakes his head and sighs. “Oh well… I’m hitting the showers man. See ya.” He then grabs his towel and walks off.<br />
<br />
In the restroom, Lester looks under the stalls and sees Isaiah’s feet inside the one at the far end. Lester had a good idea what Isaiah was concerned about; however, he didn’t know what to say. He walks to the last stall and knocks on it. “Hey ‘saiah, ah can explain alright.”<br />
<br />
“I’m becomin’ gay, aren’t I…?,” grieves Isaiah.<br />
<br />
“Um yeah, but ya see it’s-…”<br />
<br />
“Why!? How’s  this shit possible!? Don’t tell me it’s because of that chew!”<br />
<br />
“Uh actually… it is.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah recalls his first experience with the chaw on the way to the bar and everything became clear to him. Those sharp pains that boiled in his chest; that awful dream he had as that gay brute; the abnormal way he craves tobacco; everything, all because of that atrocious little can! Isaiah closes his eyes and clutches his head.<br />
<br />
“Now ah don’t know how, but ya ended up tastin’ sum of our VERY speshul brand and-”<br />
<br />
Isaiah cuts Lester short by kicking open the stall and then ferociously pushes him against the wall. “….Where’s the cure!? I want the cure RIGHT NOW!!”<br />
<br />
“Uh um… “<br />
<br />
“Quit your fuckin’ stuttering and tell me!!”<br />
<br />
“Dammit, there ain’t no cure!!”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing his confession, Isaiah instantly grew quiet and backs away from Lester.<br />
<br />
“Hate to break it to ya, but yer gay like tha res’ ovus now. Yer jus’ gun havta accept it an’ move on.”<br />
<br />
Isaiah remains in shock and doesn’t respond. He collapses upon the restroom counter and clutches his head in despair as any hope he had instantly diminished. Lester took heed of Isaiah’s situation but scratches his head trying to think of something to say.<br />
<br />
“Ah know this alls a lil’ much, but once ya start acceptin’ yer change, ah promise you’ll start feelin’ better. Really!”<br />
<br />
Isaiah shakes his head as he couldn’t bear it anymore. “Just leave me alone, alright…?” <br />
<br />
Lester continues to look at Isaiah in his pitiful state and figures enough was enough. Knowing nothing he says will help cheer him up, Lester decides to take it to the extreme. He approaches Isaiah, forcefully turns him around, and punches him clean in his cheek causing his friend to stagger in pain and fall to the floor. Isaiah rubs the point of contact with his palm and hisses in pain. “WHAT THE HELL!?”<br />
<br />
“You ain’t tough, yer jus’ sum lil’ wuss. So what if ya like dick now!? Grow up and be a man!”<br />
<br />
“Shut up! You know 2 shits about what I’m goin’ thru right now!!”<br />
<br />
“’Course ah do! Cause I-,” Lester instantly stops himself and turns his head away. “L-listen, things’ will fall into place as long as ya will it to. Open yerself up to the changes; ya might even start enjoyin’ it!”<br />
<br />
Isaiah had to admit that Lester was kind of right. Still though, all of this seems so sudden. Who in the world would believe that a can of tobacco made him gay? On that matter, WHY does a can of tobacco chew (of all things) have such an effect? Isaiah began to think that there’s more to this situation than meets the eye. He became set to find out more about this gay-changing chaw and its relationship to this venue. However in order to do so, he’ll have to continue to gain Lester’s trust. Once he finds out more; maybe (just maybe) he’ll stumble upon something that’ll change him back (or at least put these guys to justice).<br />
<br />
Isaiah lifts himself off the floor and brushes himself off. “I’ll admit… ya got a point, but there’s 1 thing I gotta say.”<br />
<br />
“Hmm?”<br />
<br />
Isaiah forcefully approaches Lester and backs him up against the stall. “You hit me like that or call mahself a wuss again, ah swear Ah’Ll FuCkInG TeAr ThAt SkIn OfF yEr FaT hInD AND FLESH IT ON ONE THEM CLOTHES HANGERS!! YA HEAR ME BOY!!?” yells Isaiah very loudly.<br />
<br />
Lester was scared shitless and couldn’t believe how hick Isaiah’s accent is. There was no way his changes could be advancing this fast; could they!?<br />
<br />
“Haha! I’m just playin’ man,” laughs Isaiah in his normal voice as he backs away from Lester.<br />
<br />
“Sh-Shure, okay…” Lester was wondering if that was truly the case.<br />
<br />
“Seriously, I hate it when people call me a wuss or some shit ‘cause I’m not.”<br />
<br />
Lester chuckles slightly and opens his mouth to say something but was quickly interrupted by Isaiah.<br />
<br />
“Don’t get me wrong though! I still don’t like this switch and all, but… I guess I’ll give it a shot.”<br />
<br />
Lester places his palm on Isaiah’s forehead to see if anything is wrong with him.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
Lester thought he was worrying too much and pats Isaiah on the back. “No no, yer fine. Ah’m jus’ glad mah buddy’s  feelin’ better. That’s all! Let’s go before someone sees us here.”<br />
<br />
With that, Isaiah and Lester walk out of the restroom together. Meanwhile, Monty (with Isaiah’s clothes in his bag) exits the back compound and makes his way towards the house across the way.<br />
<br />
“Ah! So there ya are Vermont.”<br />
<br />
Vermont turns his head and sees Maxwell and 3 other big guys in black suits approach him. “Hm? Whadyu want unc?” He looks over his uncle’s shoulders at the 3 guys behind him. “Who’re these fellas?”<br />
<br />
“They’re just sum friends o’ mine from Arctos. Y’know, our employers,” he replies. “Follow me home boy. Me an’ you needs ta have a talk.”</p>
