<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">AN: A little late for some but, Happy Holiday and a Happy New Year to all from Kyto. <br />
<br />
Carol is the youngest sister at the age of 19. She does however tower over her older sister Krystal at a height of 6&#39;3&quot; and a full figure to match. Curly dark brown hair cascades down over her shoulders framing bright green eyes and full lips. Her personality leaves her to lacking as she&#39;s easily drawn into her sister&#39;s plans every year. More often than not she can be found wherever Krystal has set out to be. <br />
<br />
Krystal is 22 years old and the stature of a young teen at 5 foot tall and barely any figure to speak of. Her blonde hair is kept short and straight barely reaching past her ears. Her face is sprinkled with freckles and keen blue eyes set around a button nose. Setting aside her own personality one might consider her cute until it bubbles to the surface. She often drags Carol on every single one of her &quot;missions&quot; throughout the year. When December finally makes its way back around again she fancies the nickname of Krys and calls her and her sister &quot;The Kringles&quot; <br />
<br />
Every year when the calendar finally turns over to December the Sanders sisters don their Christmas cheer and go out on the town. This year, Krystal and Carol are on the prowl for someone who isn&#39;t showing the necessary amount of Christmas Cheer as they should be. So, there they sat in a coffee shop as Krystal kept watching out of the large front window, Carol demurely nursed her hot chocolate. She was never one for the harder drinks in life be it alcohol or even just coffee. As she took another sip from her cup, she eyed Krystal&#39;s untouched cup of black coffee. Just looking at the pure black fluid in the cup was enough to put a bitter taste in her mouth and so she followed that immediately with another sip of her cocoa. It took several more minutes of silence between the two of them for Carol to break Krystal out of her concentration.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... What are we supposed to be doing again?&quot; Carol asked as she sat her half empty cup of cocoa on the table.<br />
<br />
Krystal didn&#39;t take her eyes off of the street as she continued to look for just the right target for her scheme. &quot;You remember that movie? The one called &#39;A Christmas Carol&#39;?&quot; She waited for Carol&#39;s reflection in the glass to nod before continuing. &quot;Well, I figured we&#39;re going to do something like that this year. We&#39;re going to find someone who&#39;s well to do and show them the meaning of the Christmas Spirit. Maybe, just maybe we&#39;ll get a gift from them too. Whadoya think?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Seems kinda da...&quot; Carol was interrupted by Krystal&#39;s outstretched hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I found the perfect one. You see that woman all dressed in black and ignoring everyone she passes?&quot; She pointed toward said woman as the woman waited to cross the road on the other side of the street. &quot;Looks like a perfect candidate for our Scrooge.&quot; She grabbed her coffee and drained the contents between a few breaths. Taking one final deep breath she grinned and motioned forward. &quot;Let&#39;s go Carol, can&#39;t let her get lost in the crowds.&quot; Krystal was already in motion toward the door while Carol carried her cup of cocoa out the door behind her.<br />
<br />
Out on the street it didn&#39;t take very long for them to catch up enough to tail the woman in question but, it took longer than Krystal would&#39;ve liked. Ever in a rush she was when the game was afoot. Nodding to Carol, she moved ahead to come alongside the woman. &quot;Nice day isn&#39;t it, Ma&#39;am?&quot; She put on her best smile while the woman didn&#39;t even spare her a glance. Why was it always the rich, pretty ones that had the worst attitudes... Sidling up just a bit closer she tried again and again it was to no avail. The next maneuver earned a cringe from Carol as Krystal sped along and stopped abruptly in front of the woman, spinning around to meet her face to face. &quot;Merry Christmas!&quot; She shouted throwing her arms out to the sides barring the woman&#39;s passage forward. She saw a flicker of acknowledgement in those bright blue eyes and prepared her speech now that she had her attention. <br />
<br />
Pulling Carol around and into her left arm, she smiled her best smile once again and began her act. &quot;Let me introduce ourselves, we are &#39;The Kringles&#39; This is my YOUNGER sister Carol Kringle and I&#39;m Krys Kringle herself.&quot; She said with a showy little bow. &quot;We&#39;ve elected you as our subject on this wonderful time of year. What do I mean you say? Why, we&#39;re going to show you how to truly spend the merriest time of year. No need to be shy, come along now.&quot; She reached out and grabbed the woman with her right hand without noticing the flash of concern in Carol&#39;s eyes. She thusly began marching onward toward the town square. <br />
<br />
Carol had seen what her sister had not, that spark of irritation in the woman&#39;s eyes as she was grabbed. Preparing herself for the worst, she was surprised when the woman allowed herself to be pulled along. Taking another sip of her cocoa, she noted that the woman didn&#39;t have any drink of her own and offered her some. Again a surprise as the woman&#39;s eyebrow cocked and she accepted the cup taking a swift sip of it. Carol smiled softly and apologetically as they arrived at their destination. The largest tree in town sat in the center of the square surrounded by large yet fake presents(They found out a few years ago.) and nestled beneath it was the large red chair for Santa Claus. A line of parents and children was already wrapped around the plaza to see the &quot;Real&quot; Kringle. She always did love looking at that tree every year though.<br />
<br />
Krystal turned to regard the two of them once more with her hands on her hips. &quot;Well, whadoya think? Pretty snazzy yeah?&quot; She puffed up as if she had set up the tree herself. The deflation of her pride followed promptly as the woman said nothing. &quot;Tough nut to crack aren&#39;t ya? That&#39;s okay, we had a feeling that might be the case. Well, there&#39;s more where that came from.&quot; Over the next hour, she pulled the woman and her sister around the town hitting up every point of the holiday season. Nothing, nothing at all had made the woman crack even a hint of a smile. &quot;Well, I have to admit when I&#39;m beat... You win, Lady. Sorry for wasting your time but still, have a Merry Christmas from the Kringle Sisters&quot; She pulled Carol close with her best smile once more as they watched the woman turn to walk away.<br />
<br />
Carol sighed having seen that the plan Krystal had come up with had failed. She put a hand on her sister&#39;s shoulders and almost got to say what was on her mind when Krystal grabbed her hand. &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot; Krystal said quietly as she once more tailed the woman in question. This time they didn&#39;t come close, staying about half a block back from the woman. The woman never even looked back as she moved through the crowded streets with seemingly no resistance whatsoever. A few times, the crowd got so thick that they almost lost sight of her. After a half an hour of tailing the woman, she walked through the gate of an expensive looking manor. Carol saw the gleam in Krystal&#39;s eyes and knew they were in for a long night.<br />
<br />
Krystal was no stranger to trespassing though, she never did any breaking and entering... Did she have a record of being where she wasn&#39;t supposed to be? Maybe... That&#39;s not the point right now however. Staying in another coffee shop a few blocks down until it closed for the evening, Krystal finally told Carol the plan. &quot;So, we&#39;re going in there and we&#39;re going to see what we&#39;re really working with... I&#39;m thinking she&#39;s got that place frigid and dark inside.  Ya know, all miserly like. We&#39;re just going to go in find out and if we have to, sprucen it up ourselves later.&quot; She nodded to herself since she knew Carol would go no matter what. &quot;That settles it, let&#39;s go.&quot; <br />
<br />
The manor grounds were sparsely lit beyond the front drive and walkways. Carol followed her sister through the dark by holding onto Krystal&#39;s shoulder. She had terrible night vision and relied solely on Krystal&#39;s ability to get around. They came along a lit window on the ground floor and she set Krystal on her shoulders to boost her up. Krystal pat Carol on her head to signal her to put her down and she relayed what she saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s some kinda sitting room. There&#39;s a really weird statue in one of the corners by a TV... I thought it was a real woman for a minute until it didn&#39;t even blink. Anyways, this might be our in. Boost me up again and I&#39;ll check the window.&quot; <br />
<br />
Krystal reached for the window and pushed gently until the window swung inward. Pulling herself up and through, she leaned back out and helped her sister climb up in as well. Once the window was closed she immediately crept over to the statue she saw. It really did look like a naked woman but, there were a few other items on its shoulders and nestled in its breasts was a nude stuffed doll. All of it was so incredibly detailed it was borderline creepy. She pulled herself away from the statue to see Carol frozen in place with a look of fright. Looking over toward the door, she almost jumped out of her skin. There stood the woman from earlier and this time she was smiling. She really didn&#39;t like that smile on her face...<br />
<br />
&quot;You again... I was wondering who it was that was meandering through my yard. I suppose you&#39;ve come to make up for earlier, hmm?&quot; The woman crossed her arms and waited exactly the same amount of time for a response as Krystal had before she waved toward her. <br />
<br />
Within a short amount of time the room around Kystal had started growing in size. That might have been the thought if her clothes were getting baggier by the second. Her fight or flight instinct kicking in, Krystal chose to run for it as her collar fell around her foot tall body. Two steps was all she got when her legs gave out and she fell back onto them, so there she was kneeling before this now giant and apparently magical rich woman. She really screwed up this time, maybe she could work her way out of this...  Damn, it was getting cold in here, hadn&#39;t they closed the win... She looked to the window to see it had been closed, so why did she feel so cold? Looking down she her body had been turning into glass. Arms wrapped up under her breasts and becoming glass just as quick, she lifted her head to scream for help. It might&#39;ve worked if the change hadn&#39;t frozen her open mouth in glass. <br />
<br />
Walking over to collect the empty Krystal shaped jug, the woman picked it up and regarded it calmly as it filled with a viscous off white fluid. She carried it over to Carol fondling the body until once she was in front of Carol, the face no longer displayed fear more of an intense sensuality. &quot;A sip for a sip.&quot; The woman said as she put the lips of the jug to Carol&#39;s own. Fearing what might happen if she didn&#39;t, Carol took a sip and shivered as the hard liquor rode the sweet taste of eggnog down her throat. Next came the coughing as her throat protested the alcohol and her mind reeled from having drank from her sister. She met the woman&#39;s eyes to see a hint of pity in them.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a shame you know, you having to pay for her misdeeds and all. However you did trespass on my property all the same so... I have to punish you as well.&quot; She turned away as Carol started having the same experience her sister must have. Everything around her grew rapidly in size and her clothing ballooned around her. Soon she was even shorter than when her sister had finished, standing at maybe 4 inches tall. The woman gently scooped her up after she&#39;d turned around holding a transparent glass mug with no handle. &quot;The handle broke off just this morning and well, you&#39;ll just have to do, Darling. Hold this in your hands now.&quot; <br />
<br />
With the command from this woman, Carol put her hands where she was instructed. She was even made to sit flat on her held out hand with her feet pressed against the glass mug. The change then crept out from the mug turning her arms and legs into glass. All she could do was watch as the change swept into her and she could see straight through herself to the woman&#39;s hand. She shed a single tear as the change overtook her neck and saw they woman&#39;s consoling expression. The last words to enter her ears was from a soft crooning tone. &quot;Now now, no tears, remember it&#39;s MERRY Christmas.&quot; <br />
<br />
Selicia held the completed mug by it&#39;s now crystalline woman handle. It was a perfect match for it&#39;s sister, the Crystal bottle holding a hard egg nog mix inside. Settled into her chair over by the fire, she turned on the TV. Moments later, her favorite game was booted up to its last save, the mug was half full of egg nog, and the bottle was -firmly- corked. A deep sigh of relief left her lips as she regarded the once woman bottle one more time. &quot;You really make a better headache relief than you do a headache... Oh, and Merry Christmas~&quot;</p>
