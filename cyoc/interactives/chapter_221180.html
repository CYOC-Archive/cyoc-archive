<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ted Vaughn did not know what he was looking at when his mom brought him that weird box from his even weirder uncle&#39;s place. Uncle Lukas was selling the place, and had to get rid of some stuff, but he was strangely insistent that this particular item went to &quot;Ethan and his family&quot;. Dad didn&#39;t seem all that enthused about it. But the box looked pretty ornate, and could probably impress some folks. In as far as their families, Lukas Vaughn had always been the less successful sibling - whereas Ted&#39;s father Ethan went into business and became a prominent local leader, Uncle Lukas became known as the curio guy. He always spent more of his time collecting all this weird shit.<br />
<br />
And honestly, Ted didn&#39;t mind it all that much. Some of the stuff from Uncle Lukas&#39; shop looked like it could make for a crazy party trick. Ted had always, despite dear old dad&#39;s dislike for his less successful sibling, went over to hang out at the shop. Weird could be funny. And while the old timer had been adamant about Ted not using any of his things for party tricks, he bet it was just some kind of caution about his stuff.<br />
<br />
Ted however did take after his father in one particular way: Much like his father, and his father before him, Ted was involved in high school athletics. And in fact just this year turned 18, being one of the most promising athletes on both the football and wrestling teams. As a linebacker and as a heavy weight tier wrestler, Ted was pretty much the epitome of large and in charge. Tall, tan skinned, Ted tipped the scales at close to 275 lbs, though not entirely muscle mass. His gut pushed out substantially, though this was by and large the only &quot;soft&quot; thing about Ted. His pecs were powerfully built, shoulders broad and wide, and arms he swore were close to 19 or 20 inches. <br />
<br />
Ted&#39;s messy, thick straw blond hair and baby blue eyes gave him a certain charming aesthetic, one he was eager to enjoy the advantages of. After all, these days, it wasn&#39;t often you got to date the total package All American Jock Dreamboat. And not many girls had complaints about his heftiness when he brought his stamina to the occasion. His jaw was strong and cleanshaven, and most often he wore a polo shirt and jeans with his letterman jacket.<br />
<br />
Such was today, for example. He&#39;d been planning to go out with his current girlfriend and some of his friends from school. After all, he and his girl had just made back up. Ted had admittedly gotten a little curious about life on the other team, so to speak - and for some reason she just didn&#39;t like his &quot;I was just curious, I&#39;m not even gay&quot; excuse. After all, hadn&#39;t he been giving it to her whenever she wanted...? Eh, he didn&#39;t get it sometimes.<br />
<br />
But now he was wondering about this little box.<br />
<br />
He figured he had time to get over there. His Toyota could get him anywhere in this sleepy little California suburb. Opening the box up, Ted was left looking at a box, and a small piece of paper. It had writing in red pen and, as Ted looked at what the message was, he tilted his head in confusion; <i>To my ever so daring and brash nephew, I give something that should bequeath many interesting days and nights. A ring to bring you your desire as you see fit. Reshape your self and your form as needed. Have fun, but be responsible now. -Uncle Lukas.</i><br />
<br />
Ted chuckled as he looked at the ring. While he didn&#39;t get what Uncle Lukas was trying to say, he could appreciate a nice looking ring. Crumpling up the piece of paper and tossing it by his TV in the living room as he took a seat on the couch, Ted examined it closely. The ring had a series of green, smaller inlaid gems surrounding the central bright red gemstone. He didn&#39;t know if this was actually really ruby and emeralds or something, but fuck if it looked nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man my uncle sure knew how to find this stuff. Wonder where he always went to find it.&quot; No answer from his dad. As soon as he delivered it, he left the situation entirely. As little as possible to do with his brother as usual.<br />
<br />
Ted shrugged and figured he could at least try it on.<br />
<br />
As he did so, he noted that the ring, despite having initially looked a little small for his wide fingers, was now a perfect fit. Easily able to be removed, but snug to his ring finger. As Ted looked it over some more, considering what the message might&#39;ve meant, he got a text message from his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
<i>From:Nat</i><br />
<i>I got done early with the homework. Can you be over sooner? You sure the party&#39;s on today?</i><br />
<br />
Well, he could try and give this a further look into later. Duty called. He had to pick up his girlfriend, then pick up Toby and Jack from their places, and head over to Seth&#39;s place for the party. And so as Ted headed out and into his car, he thought about something as he started the engines and began driving out to his girlfriend&#39;s place. And as Ted&#39;s desires and wishes started to idly be indulged in as he drove over to his girlfriend&#39;s place, that desire would cause the ring to light up.<br />
<br />
Little did Ted know exactly what the ring his uncle found was capable of. While worn, any sufficiently and repeatedly dwelled upon desire would start to influence Ted&#39;s body. And so indeed as Ted drove, his desires were...</p>
