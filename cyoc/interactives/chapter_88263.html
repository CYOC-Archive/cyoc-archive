<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">So Jesse drove his car to the Ski Lodge, and decided to finally meet his idol Mark Connors, once and for all.  He wanted to play it cool, and not squeal like a fanboy or anything, but he wanted him so bad because he was attracted to him.  But Jesse made a promise to himself that he wouldn’t be weird, at least in the open.<br />
<br />
Jesse said to himself, “Calm your nerves, Jess, calm your nerves.  Just be a little straight boy.  You can do it, mister.”<br />
<br />
Before checking in, he went to the men’s bathroom, where it was empty.  He adjusted his crotch, to make sure his strapon STP penis packer was in place beneath his hip-hugging jeans, and made sure that his chest was bound securely under his black shirt.  He proceeded to wash his hands when he received a text from his best friend, Jenny.<br />
<br />
It read: “YO GURL…I mean, boy.  LOL.  Hey, boy Jessica.  &#9786; Hope your ski trip will be fun.  Wish me and Amber were with you there.  From yo homie, Jenny.<br />
<br />
Jesse smiled, and left the men’s restroom, as he proceeded to sign into the Ski Lodge.<br />
<br />
There were two clerks, one male and one female, as both of them smiled at him.  <br />
The first clerk smiled benevolently at Jesse and he said, “Hello sir, welcome to the Miller Ski Lodge.  It’s one of the world’s finest ski places you’ll be at.  Are you here to ski, to check into the Future Skiers of the World event hosted by Mark Connors, or both?”<br />
<br />
Jesse smiled meekly, as he said sheepishly, “Both.”<br />
<br />
The second clerk replied graciously, “Mark Connors is one of the best skiers in the world.  I’m sure you can learn plenty of neat tricks and tidbits from him, and he’s hosting an after-party just for handsome young men like yourself.  You must attend this event.”<br />
<br />
Jesse replied coyly, “Oh, perhaps I will.”<br />
<br />
With that, Jesse signed his name, and signed up for the event to join Future Skiers of the World.  It was actually a pretty long event, as there were several keynote speakers and professors talking mostly to young men and women that were mostly skiers, but some students, and a few older adults and kids in the audience.<br />
<br />
Jesse had been dozing off as he was starting to enter a deep sleep, when a professor called upon him.<br />
<br />
The professor said to him, “You in the black shirt.  What’s your name and age, young man?”<br />
<br />
Jesse replied timidly, “Jesse Wilcox. 24 years old.  Attending college in Massachusetts.”<br />
<br />
The professor said, “Sir, what do you want to be when you grow up?”<br />
<br />
Jesse said, “A skier, I guess?”<br />
<br />
The professor replied, “Correct.  At Miller Ski Lodge, we will turn young men and women into the finest skiers in the world.”<br />
<br />
The professor lectured on, and Jesse received a vibrating text from Amber.<br />
<br />
It read: Hey Jess, it’s yo gurl, Amber.  Let’s hang out as soon as you get back.  BTW, I want some of that fresh tuna of yours, if you get the hint. Let me know if you’re interested.  &#9786;<br />
<br />
 Jesse quickly shut it off as the professor suspected someone’s phone going off.  The professor wanted to know whose phone it was, but he got no response, so he kept going.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, a girl slipped Jesse a note.  Jesse received it, and when he looked over his shoulder, a skinny brownish-blonde haired Hispanic girl waved and winked at him.<br />
<br />
It read, “Hey boy.  Don’t know you yet, but I will.  Name’s Francesca.  I’m 19.  Let’s fuck.”<br />
<br />
Jesse decided to sneak off to go to the bathroom as he had to go real bad, but he wasn’t sure if he was interested in his attractive stalker.  Jesse was sure he was into guys, but hadn’t really taken much of an interest in girls before.  <br />
<br />
But he was far more into Amber than Francesca, as he didn’t really know Franny, and had an emotional connection with Amber, who is one of his best friends.  Plus, he was afraid that if he started to get into with Franny, that his hidden secret would possibly be found out.<br />
<br />
On the way to the men’s bathroom, Franny saw the thin, attractive young man, as he looked to almost be too pretty to be a guy.  The young man did have a slight goth look to him, and he looked so hot to Fran.  But she wanted to know more about the shy young man that had blonde, brownish hair in a short crew cut.  There was a certain toughness that the young man projected, and she liked that about him.  So Franny decided to make a move on him.<br />
<br />
Jesse was being approached by Francesca, and suddenly Francesca stopped him in the doorway of the men’s bathroom.<br />
<br />
Franny said, “Hey there, young man.  I got the goods, wanna fuck?  Right now or tonight?”<br />
<br />
Jesse stammered discreetly, “I uh, have to use the bathroom.  Sorry ma’am, maybe later I guess.  I am interested, but right now may not be the right time.”<br />
<br />
But right there, Franny pulled her face to his, and kissed him!  Jesse was shocked.  Right there, he saw his crush, Mark Connors walk by.<br />
<br />
Mark Connors walked by as he was roaming the hallway preparing for his speech, as he said to Jesse, “Right on, dude.  Right on.  That’s how we roll, young man!”<br />
<br />
Francesca laughed as she said to Jesse, “Okay sweetie.  Just freshen up, and let’s continue tonight!”<br />
<br />
Jesse was starting to like his predicament, and pondered if maybe he should transition full-time to be a guy.  He wondered if he should go through with having Francesca as his girlfriend for the weekend, if he should spend all of his efforts to get to know Mark Connors, better, or both.  <br />
<br />
Jesse was pretty sure that he would be a gay guy this week after spending his first 24 years as a girl, but with multiple potential suitors, he was left pondering his next move after making a rest stop.</p>
