<br />
Hinata gasped, sitting upright as she grasped her chest. One moment she found herself at Fukushu&#39;s mercy, awaiting the fearsome nine tails judgement. The next she found herself wrapped with pain, watching as her body slowly vanishing out of existence. That was when everything went black.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, you&#39;re awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata turned quickly, still trying to catch her breath as she gazed upon the sullen, vulpine features of Choon Hee. Confused, she quickly scanned her surroundings, noticing she was once more within the Normal HQ.<br />
<br />
&quot;Choon Hee?&quot; she asked, still dazed from her experience. &quot;What happened? What am I doing in med bay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I brought you here.&quot; the kumiho replied. &quot;Judging by your face you&#39;re confused. The last thing you remember was that kitsune impaling me before turning to you.&quot; Hinata nodded, she did remember Fukushu attacking, driving her to her knees before impaling Choon Hee from behind. After that, everything was a blur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll give you the cliff notes version,&quot; Choon Hee continued. &quot;Fukushu had us dead to rights. It was over. Then, for better or worse, the Boss interfered.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Boss?&quot; Hinata asked, still confused.<br />
<br />
Choon Hee sighed, a forlorn expression on her vulpine face. Something bad happened and Hinata needed to know what. Slowly, the kumiho now reached put gently taking Hinata’s hand. &quot;He&#39;s dead,&quot; Choon Hee said softly. &quot;And he tried to erase the kitsune from existence.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata felt her head was spinning as Choon Hee explained everything that happened in the Boss’s final moments. After breaching the kitsune realm, the Boss used the Hourglass in a vain attempt to erase every kitsune from existence, including Hinata. The Boss though was defeated and presumably killed by Darren McKenna, a teenage wizard from the future and the Catalyst; a wizard of such immense power that they could shape the course of human history. With the Boss now gone, a power vacuum now existed within the Normal.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been unconscious for two days,&quot; Choon Hee said softly. &quot;Since then Casseus has maneuvered his way into a position of leadership. Rick is dead and Demeter is in the process of fleeing to the second timeline with the Boss’s daughters. Anyone not willing to bend the knee to Casseus is going to find themselves just as dead as Rick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata was speechless. Betrayed by the man she had pledged her undying loyalty too, only to find the only home she had ever known divided amongst two warring factions.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it is,&quot; Choon Hee said sadly. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m here. Dr. Eastly asked that I help you escape with her and Dr. Chapman.&quot; Hinata raised an eyebrow. Escape? Escape to where?<br />
<br />
&quot;Eastly told me you ran into some kitsune when you were scouting the realm,&quot; she said. &quot;Is that true Hinata?&quot; The young vixen nodded. During her travels, she had run across a northern kitsune tribe that had pledged loyalty to the Asaya during the Kitsune Civil War. Upon her return, she went to visit Dr. Eastly, gushing about the simple beauty of the northern city. As Hinata described it, she felt as if she found somewhere else that could feel like home.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was beautiful,&quot; Hinata said softly. &quot;I have always felt that the Normal was home. However, I never felt as if I belonged. With the Shimizu though, it felt as if I had finally found a missing piece of myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Choon Hee stated. &quot;Far better than anyone else. That is why you should go. Go and take Eastly and Chapman with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata balked. Leave the Normal? This was all she ever knew. This was her home. This was where Captain Cassidy raised her to becomes the warrior she was today. &quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because there is no place for us here anymore,&quot; Choon Hee said sadly. &quot;It is only a matter of time before Casseus either bends you to his will or destroys you. Leave, while you still have a chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata shifted nervously, her emotions conflicted. This was all she ever knew yet these were the same people attempted to destroy her as well. How could she trust someone who cared so little for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I&#39;ll do it. Tell Eastly and Chapman to meet me here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Choon Hee nodded, turning to leave before Hinata called out. &quot;Wait,&quot; she said, the kumiho turning slightly. &quot;You should come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sad smile now crossed the kumiho&#39;s face as she shook her head no. &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; she stated. &quot;Even if I still possessed my free will, I am bound to the Normal. I can not leave. Instead, I am compelled to serve the Boss’s descendants. His daughters and Demeter are my master now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Hinata replied sadly. &quot;But why help me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Choon Hee smirked, taking Hinata’s hand and squeezing it tightly. &quot;When I was a child,&quot; she said. &quot;I often followed my father out to sea. He was a fisherman and I wanted nothing more than to be as he was. Then one day, a storm came. Our boat was smashed, my father with his dying breath placed me on the wreckage of our boat. I drifted for days until one day, a merchant ship found me. The kitsune on-board rescued me from a watery grave and returned me to Korea. Those kitsune...were of the Asaya clan and I swore that I would one day repay their kindness. Now that debt has been fulfilled.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata balked, uttering a simple thank you as Choon Hee now departed. No matter what the future held, she would always be thankful for the kindness of the kumiho.<br />
<br />
17 years later<br />
<br />
&quot;Lady Hinata.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata turned from her reports, watching as her six tail second in command, Ryoma, entered the room. &quot;Report.&quot; she asked firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lady we have secured Lord Yudai and Lady Hana,&quot; he stated. &quot;Very good Ryoma,&quot; she replied. &quot;Have them brought to my command tent. I will speak with them there.&quot; Ryomo nodded, turning before pausing. &quot;Lady Hinata a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak freely Ryomo,&quot; she said. &quot;Is this in regards to Yudai&#39;s army?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is my lady,&quot; he said. &quot;The battle was difficult. They sustained heavy loses. Perhaps 60 percent of his forces remain. Are you sure you wish to offer them leniency?&quot;<br />
<br />
This was the common question Hinata received throughout her campaign. Upon her arrival 17 years ago, the four tail vixen returned to the Shimizu clan with Dr. Eastly and Chapman in tow. At the time, she was searching for sanctuary for her friends and the Shimizu were some of the few she could rely on.<br />
<br />
Thankfully for Hinata, Lord Zentaro was a kind and just lord. Taking Hinata’s companions into his domain, the elderly eight tail promised them sanctuary. With that secured, Hinata then bid the elderly kitsune goodbye.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I am to understand our people then I must travel the realm,&quot; she said. &quot;For too long I have been away, residing within the mortal realm and concerning myself with mortal needs. If I am truly the celestial your people believe, then I must prove it and understand our people&#39;s concerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are quite wise for someone so young,&quot; Zentaro stated, before hugging the dour tail vixen tightly. &quot;Be safe in your travels. We anxiously awaiting your return.&quot;<br />
<br />
For 10 years that is what Hinata did, travel. At first she found it difficult, moving between various cities, penniless and alone. During this period, she observed the kitsune, studying not only its people but its rulers.<br />
<br />
Despite the so called benevolence of the royal family, Hinata discovered that the further away one moved from the capital, the less tolerant the rulers were. Kitsune lords and ladies operated by their own standards, sometimes selfishly. These rulers grew rich, Hinata observing poor kitsune farmers and merchants giving over much wares to keep the lords fat and happy. The only time things seemed to change was during the royal inspections.<br />
<br />
Hinata could tell when these visits were coming. A month prior, the various minor lords would go out of their way to make the populace happy. Prices would be lowered, money would be given away, festivals would be had. This was done to make the people happy, to give them no reason to inform the royal family about what was occurring so far from the capital.<br />
<br />
Once the inspection was over, things returned to how they were. The lords grew fat and happy, the common folk struggling to get by. While it was not all the lords, it was enough that Hinata began to resent these leaders. They saw themselves as above those they were supposed to care for. Their subjects were their to serve them, not the other way around and any who questioned this logic were branded radicals or thrown into prison.<br />
<br />
As time passed, Hinata did everything she could to help those less fortunate. Food, wealth, whatever it took to ease their suffering. It began to resonate with the common folk. Tales of the merciful vixen whispered amongst the people. Those whispers growing louder until the very lords she shunned began to notice. They branded Hinata a radical, someone going against a system that had existed for millennia. It made Hinata dangerous, and a threat to their rule.<br />
<br />
These rulers began to pursue Hinata, without the capitals knowledge. They viewed this &quot;Messiah of the Poor&quot; as a threat to the order of the realm. It both angered and terrified them, a single vixen that challenged the status quo.<br />
<br />
Upon returning to the Shimizu Clan, Hinata found that Lord Zentaro was on his death bed, despite Dr. Eastly and Chapman&#39;s best efforts. Hinata was saddened, the elderly kitsune had such faith in her and now he was about to pass. Zentaro, though, was serene as he faced death. &quot;I can pass onto the afterlife happy,&quot; he said softly. &quot;Because my faith has been rewarded. You are the promised God our people our people fought for. Now, go...let others learn what I have learned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zentaro&#39;s words echoed through Hinata’s mind as Lord Yudai and Lady Hana were led to her in chains. The pair of seven tail kitsune were the types of leaders Hinata despised. Taking advantage of their people while offering their allies and sycophants a life of luxury. Even now they maintained an air of arrogance as they glared at Hinata.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t get away with this,&quot; Yudai exclaimed, his roundish face skewed in anger. &quot;Tatsu and Shizen shall send the army to quell this peasants rebellion. Then...you will face the judgement of the Angel of Vengeance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata frowned, shaking her head as she glared at the two elite kitsune. Overweight, arrogant, and lacking all humility, the pair of orange foxes had only disdain for their people. &quot;For too long you have ruled your people with an iron fist,&quot; she said softly. &quot;No more shall they go hungry as you grow fat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata now turned to a pair of her soldiers, the duo prepared to execute the disposed lords. &quot;Empty their stores,&quot; she said. &quot;Give the money to the people of this city. Divide the rations amongst our army and provide the rest to the citizens. No one in this town shall go hungry tonight save these too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what shall you have us do with these two,&quot; Ryoma asked. Hinata glared at the pair, noting the arrogant expression on Yudai&#39;s face, his wife Hana though had some sense. For the first time in her privileged life, she was fearful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Place them in the stocks in the center of town,&quot; Hinata stated. &quot;Let their people decide their fate.&quot; Ryomo nodded, motioning for the guards to now drag the former rulers away. &quot;And what of the army Lady Hinata?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow me,&quot; she said, beckoning Ryomo to follow. The silver six tail nodded, trailing behind Hinata as she approached the stockade.<br />
<br />
The battle against Yudai&#39;s forces was brutal. For someone like Yudai, he maintained power by establishing a well trained, well armed military force. The army fought with honor, most refusing to surrender until overwhelming forces made victory impossible. By Hinata’s order though, the army was not massacred. Instead they were taken prisoner, shunning the traditional code of fighting to the death. As Hinata approached, she could see kitsune ranging from two tail to seven tail wearily watching.<br />
<br />
&quot;I come here today to give you a choice,&quot; she proclaimed. &quot;You have fought with honor. Defended your home, fulfilled your oath to the lords who have taken your service for granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
A low murmur now stirred amongst the defeated army, unsure of what the vixen would say. &quot;I have not come to destroy your home,&quot; she continued. &quot;I have come to free your families. Free them from those who would put themselves above the needs of their people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We serve the true gods,&quot; a defeated five tail proclaimed, rising to his feet as he angrily stared at Hinata. &quot;We will not bend the knee to a false god!&quot;<br />
<br />
Two of Hinata’s soldiers scowled, unsheathing their weapons as they looked to strike down their defeated foe. Hinata simply raised a hand, indicating for her men to stand down.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say you serve the true gods,&quot; Hinata stated. &quot;Yet, where were Tatsu and Shizen in your hour of need? It is time to face a hard truth. The celestial kitsune you hold with such reverence have lost their way. At one time, they may have cared for you, but they have grown far too complacent. Letting petty and cruel lords rule in their stead.&quot;<br />
<br />
The kitsune soldier who stood, raised an eyebrow. The last thing he expected was for the usurper to let him speak without repercussions.<br />
<br />
&quot;I come before you now to beseech your help,&quot; she continued. &quot;For too long the peasant and the soldier have been exploited. Used to prop up those that care only for themselves. I humble myself before all of you, to join me in our cause.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would sooner commit sepukko,&quot; a seven tailed vixen exclaimed as she too now stood. &quot;If i choose to betrayed my lord or die with honor. Then I choose honor!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;By right that is your choice,&quot; Hinata said sadly. &quot;And I would ask that you would allow me the honor of helping you preserve yours and quicken your end without pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You would help a common soldier,&quot; a three tailed kitaune exclaimed. &quot;Why? We are but foot soldiers? Why would a victorious general help a defeated foe preserve their honor?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because none have you have lost your honor,&quot; Hinata replied. &quot;All of your actions today are worthy of praise. None of you are lesser for defending your homes. You all deserve to be honored, even in defeat, for your actions this day. If I am to be a force for change, a force to better our people. Then I must be willing to help preserve the honor of those who feel their death is the only answer for a perceived defeat.&quot;<br />
<br />
The defeated army now murmured amongst themselves, shocked by Hinata’s actions. That someone of her standing would take the time to honor a common soldier went completely against tradition.<br />
<br />
Hinata watched as a few kitsune now stood, bowing their heads. These kitsune would rather choose death in defense of the old ways. Surprisingly though, the three kitsune who stood before, now kneeled, bowing their heads in reverence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Lady Hinata,&quot; the seven tailed kitsune replied. &quot;We promise to serve you with honor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hinata nodded, watching as her guards led the few who refused to yield away as the remainder of the army chanted her name. After fulfilling her duties and helping those who refused to yield retain their honor, she would move on. Hopefully, when she finally dethroned the celestials and assumed the mantle of ruler, she would usher in a golden age.</p>
