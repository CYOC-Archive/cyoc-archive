<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Get it looking good, Milo. I wanna make him jealous when he sees what he’s missing out on.”<br />
<br />
Dare was lying on his belly naked (naturally), calling back instructions to Milo as the boar carefully combed, brushed, and conditioned Dare’s tail. With the addition of his tail, Dare was done changing, fully a beautiful skunk in every sense of the word, and he quickly found that he adored his bushy new tail, from its delicate curl at the tip to its unbelievably soft and fluffy fur to the perfectly straight stripes that went all the way to its tip.<br />
<br />
He did <i>not</i>, however, enjoy all the brushing required to keep it from looking like a dead rat was hanging off his ass. Luckily for him, Milo <i>did</i> enjoy the brushing. <i>Just another reason we were meant to be together</i>, Dare sighed as he relaxed with his textbook while Milo did all the hard work, relishing in the gentle tugging on his fur and the soothing feeling of the brush’s bristles tickling his skin.<br />
<br />
“You’re really going to talk to him? Maybe I should come along to-“ Milo started to say, only to be silenced by a gentle <i>thwap</i> across the snout by Dare’s tail.<br />
<br />
“To keep me from caving his skull in? Please, what do you take me for?” Dare snapped, turning the page in his book without even looking back. “I said I’m going to talk, and I’m going to <i>talk</i>. That’s it.”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m aware of what you said. I’m afraid of what you’ll <i>do</i>, skunk,” Milo sighed, giving a sharp tug of his brush to untangle a knot in Dare’s fur. Dare let out a yelp and spun around on the bed, the fur on his back standing on end in irritation at the sudden jolt. “There you go, looking great. I still think this is a bad idea, but at the very least you <i>look</i> good.”<br />
<br />
Dare let out a huff of indignation and rolled out of bed with his bushy tail waggling behind him seductively. Milo couldn’t keep his eyes off the waving black beauty, and for the first time in his life he realized he must have a kink for long, fluffy, tails. Milo was glad that he had become a boar, all things considered, but once he saw that tail he almost wished he’d been a skunk instead. Or a squirrel, or a chinchilla, or a red panda, or anything else with a long and bushy tail. <i>Well, at least I get to touch it whenever I want. That’s a good enough consolation prize, I suppose</i>, he thought to himself as he watched Dare getting dressed for the day. The skunk pulled on a mesh shirt on before putting on a lightweight vest, then he pulled on a pair of shorts and threaded his tail though the opening in the rear. Dare checked himself out in the mirror, fixing his hair (Head-fur? He still wasn’t sure what to call it, though he was thinking about dying it blond again to make it stand out more), and making sure that his piercing was covered up. He was growing quite fond of the little green pleasure-button stabbed through his nipple, but he was still a little embarrassed of letting anyone other than Milo see it.<br />
<br />
“There, how do I look?” Dare said, spinning around and nearly knocking everything off of Milo’s desk with his tail in the process.<br />
<br />
“Stlll look good. And I still think this is a bad i-”<br />
<br />
“Great. Love you, pig, see you later,” Dare replied, giving Milo a deep kiss before running out the door.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“This was a bad idea…” Dare sighed as he heard the sound of basketballs thudding against the floor ahead of him. He had been lurking around the campus athletics center for the past hour, glancing into the weights room and trying not to look too suspicious as he walked though the locker rooms in his search for Keith. He finally made his way to the outdoor basketball courts and heard the sound of the bear’s voice in the distance, and he knew that he had finally found who he was looking for. And that is what stopped him dead in his tracks.<br />
<br />
<i>Dare, this is what you’ve wanted for days. Hell, you’ve wanted it for </i>years<i>! Go in there and give him a piece of your mind, and if he really, really, </i>really<i> sounds like he’s sorry… You know what? Fuck him. Don’t let him off the hook. Let him stew in it. Let it make him feel as bad as he made you feel.</i><br />
<br />
“What’s even the point…?” Dare muttered, slumping up against the nearest wall and sliding down to the ground, hugging his tail for comfort. Feeling his own fur between his fingers triggered all sorts of memories, some of the saddest moments in his (new) life, but he couldn’t make himself let go.<br />
<br />
“Come to finish the job, then?”<br />
<br />
Dare looked up and saw Keith’s boyfriend Terry standing over him, a smug and slightly buck-toothed smirk spread wide across the squirrel’s handsome face.<br />
<br />
“Nice tail, by the way,” Terry added off-handedly. “Mine’s bigger, but…”<br />
<br />
“But mine’s cuter,” Dare shot back, and both men shared a snort of amusement. Terry walked over and leaned against the wall next to Dare, and they were silent for a few minutes until the squirrel finally spoke up.<br />
<br />
“You know… He’s been acting weird for the past week or so. Keith, I mean,” Terry said quietly. “Moody, distant, that sort of thing. I figured he was cheating on me until I finally managed to wring it out of him. He said he’d started remembering his old life again, how he’d been an asshole to some guy in high school. That sorta stuff usually stops happening after a couple months, but it started happening to Keith again, and it was bothering him...”<br />
<br />
“He was more than just an asshole to me, so you’d better not start making excuses for him,” Dare mumbled.<br />
<br />
“Let me finish, freshman. God, add that to the list of shit I hate about freshmen…” Terry sighed, his tail twitching angrily before settling down after a few moments. “Anyway, he’d never told me anything about who he’d been before, but now he starts opening up and laying all this heavy shit on me. About how he&#39;d been kissed by another guy, how he’d made a fucking ass of himself and ruined that guy’s life… You know the story, obviously.”<br />
<br />
“Obviously. Do you have anything to add, or are you just dredging up the worst memories of my life for fun?”<br />
<br />
“Column A, column B, to be honest,” Terry laughed, giving Dare a smug smirk before continuing. “But here’s where it gets interesting, so pay a little attention. He told me that the guy he was bullying back then… Keith didn’t remember him as a human. He was a skunk. And Keith was a bear. Now, I don’t know how all this weird shit works ‘cause I’m from this side, but to me, that sounds like neither of you are going to just be able to sit back and let yourselves forget about what happened. What happened is part of your lives no matter where you go, so you’d better learn to live with it. And to be honest, I’d rather Keith get over what happened, too. ‘Cause when he gets moody it’s like fucking a dead fish, know what I mean?”<br />
<br />
Dare burst into laughter at that, already liking Terry a lot more than he thought he would. “So, I should forgive Keith for your sake, then?” Dare replied, standing up and looking off toward the basketball court in the distance, catching a flash of brown fur through the chain-link fence. “What’s in it for me?”<br />
<br />
“Fuck you, that’s what. I can get pissed off and clock a guy too, you know?” Terry chuckled, waving one of his tiny fists in front of Dare’s face. “Do whatever you want, skunk. Just remember that you’ve gotta live on this side with Keith <i>and</i> me, so choose wisely. Now, get going already.”<br />
<br />
Terry shooed Dare away, and Dare slowly began to walk off while feeling a bit better about what he was going to say to Keith. Terry rolled his eyes and lit up a cigarette, relaxing as he heard Dare and Keith’s muffled voices in the distance after a few minutes, hoping he wouldn’t have to pull the skunk off his boyfriend by the time they were done.<br />
<br />
“Fucking freshmen… Coming over to this side and expecting all their problems to get solved for ‘em. Don’t they have any fucking therapists over there?” he sighed as he puffed on his cigarette. “…I’m gonna have to give that kid my favorite tail conditioner, though. He looks like he’s got roadkill stapled to his ass.”<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“So, that’s it? You two are best buddies again?” Terry teased as he watched Keith getting changed in the locker room.<br />
<br />
“Don’t make fun, Ter. I hurt him a lot, and you can’t expect that to get patched up with a little chat,” Keith said as he stripped off his sweaty shorts and boxers. “But… I think we’ve come to an understanding.”<br />
<br />
“What kind of understanding? Anything I’ve got to be worried about?” Terry joked, strutting over to Keith and standing on his tiptoes to kiss his boyfriend on the lips. “Wanna know something funny? I was talking to Guy and his new boyfriend the other day, and you know what Guy said? He said that I reminded him of that skunk! I mean, what the fuck, right?”<br />
<br />
“You and Dare? I don’t see it,” Keith laughed as he toweled off his sweaty fur. “Maybe ‘cause of the tail, but other than that you’re completely different!”<br />
<br />
“Seriously! I mean, we’re alike because we’ve both got big tails? I dunno, that sounds a little racist to me, not gonna lie.”<br />
<br />
Still chuckling to himself, Keith started walking off to the showers to get cleaned off, but then he felt a paw grabbing him by the fur on his back and pulling him back.<br />
<br />
“No way, big bear. You worked up a <i>really</i> sexy musk earlier, and I’m not gonna let you waste it,” Terry snickered, undoing his pants and kicking them off to the side. He slid his paw along the waistband of his boxers, slowly tugging them down and letting his surprisingly big cock out into the air. “Now, bend over the bench and get that slutty little tail of yours up in the air in three seconds.”<br />
<br />
“T-Ter, what if someone-“ Keith gulped, glancing at the locker room door nervously.<br />
<br />
“I locked it. Two seconds,” Terry said, and the authoritative tone of the squirrel’s voice immediately made Keith’s cock stiffen with excitement. The bear quickly dashed over to the nearest bench and braced himself, reaching back and spreading his ass wide for Terry’s enjoyment.<br />
<br />
<i>Honestly, I’m nothing like Dare</i>, Terry thought smugly as he lined his thick cock up with Keith’s tightly muscled ass and roughly shoved it inside, making Keith let out an echoing growl of pure pleasure. Terry knew exactly how to make his bear squeal, and he wasn’t going to let his submissive boyfriend cum until he’d squeezed him for <i>all</i> the details of Keith and Dare’s little ‘understanding’. After all, he didn’t want his adorable little teddy bear getting the short end of the stick, did he?</p>
