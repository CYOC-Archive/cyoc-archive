<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Derrick was still pumped over the changes when he left Hermes and headed back into the main spa, so much so that he forgot to get dressed.  It wasn&#39;t until he caught admiring glances and some chuckles that he remembered, and dashed back to grab his clothing.  Except it was gone.  Hermes was waiting with a grin and held out a large flap of soft cloth that has a kind of waistband.  &quot;Here.  I can see you aren&#39;t ready for total exposure.  This will cover you, at least in front - when you are standing still.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But I can&#39;t...&quot;  Derrick was torn by ingrained modesty and the excitement of showing off.  It wasn&#39;t as if he would be the only one in the buff - but he wasn&#39;t quite ready to let it all hang out uncovered.  Once he got the loincloth in place, he discovered it didn&#39;t really hide much, the soft cloth bulging rather prominently.  The garment also did nothing to hide the back view, but he could live with that.  With the loincloth in place, he strode back out just in time to see his parents and sister coming back in from the tour.  He waved and called out automatically before realizing his parents might not be so thrilled with his changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Derrick!?&quot;  His mother was scandalized, looking around and then averting her eyes from his prominent manhood.  &quot;What have you done to yourself?  And how can you walk around like that?  You&#39;re practically naked!&quot;  His dad was a little flustered, but was also stifling a grin.  &quot;Looks like you got right to it, son.&quot;  He sister just thought it was funny and giggled.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, Derrick stood his ground, even though his cheeks were heating up.  &quot;Well, lots of guests are going naked, and this is supposed to be a place where you can do anything.  We only have two weeks.  Anyway, you guys said we could do what we wanted while we were here.&quot;<br />
<br />
That got his mom flustered even more, but his dad nodded and patted her arm.  &quot;He&#39;s right.  We both read the brochure, and it looks like their claims of making anything possible are true.  It&#39;s just for a couple of weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
His sister nodded enthusiastically.  &quot;Yeah!  Like, what&#39;s the point of being here if we don&#39;t take advantage of everything we can?  And Derrick&#39;s right - lots of folks are naked here.&quot;<br />
<br />
In truth, most of the nude beings were probably employees, minotaurs, satyrs, and centaurs mostly.  But some appeared to be normal humans of different ages who were also suspiciously trim and handsome, as well as well-endowed.  Now that he looked closer, there were some humanoid animals spotted around - a man who looked to be part lion, a boy and girl who were at least half chimpanzee, and a woman who was obviously part deer or gazelle.<br />
<br />
The receptionist called them over, giving Derrick a reprieve.  &quot;We have you rooms ready.  I actually have some choices here.  There is a suite with three bedrooms so you can all stay together.  But I also have a grand single suite available, with private accommodations not far away for the kids.  It would give you all some privacy, and I have to add that the grand suite is very luxurious. The kids can choose their own themes as well, which usually makes the vacation more fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
John, Derrick&#39;s father, looked at his wife and grinned.  &quot;Well, we are here for a getaway.  And maybe its better if the kids have some independence.  We don&#39;t want to limit their fun.&quot;  She did not looked convinced, but Derrick and his sister both were excited by the prospect.  The receptionist gave his mom a wink.  &quot;The grand suite comes with room service, a private masseuse, nd its own indoor pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough to push his mom over the edge, and she sighed and nodded.  &quot;OK.  But you both need to be careful.  Just because you can do something crazy...&quot;<br />
<br />
His dad patted her arm and cut her off. &quot;Whatever they do is only for two weeks.  It doesn&#39;t matter if Derrick ended up as one of the minotaurs - he&#39;ll be perfectly normal again by the time we have to leave.  Isn&#39;t that right?&quot;  He asked the receptionist.<br />
<br />
She chuckled and nodded.  &quot;Oh, we guarantee that everyone is perfectly normal when they leave.&quot;  But Derrick heard her softly mutter &quot;Whatever they happen to be.&quot;  No one else picked it up, and he realized his hearing was somehow enhanced.  The receptionist seemed to catch his expression and flush slightly, but Derrick grinned and said &quot;I like that last part.&quot;  The rest of his family thought he meant the guarantee of being made normal, but the receptionist&#39;s surprised grin and wink told him she understood exactly what he meant.<br />
<br />
A burly minotaur - spectacularly naked - carried his parent&#39;s luggage and led them off to their grand suite.  Julie, his sister, was assigned a green-skinned girl who must be a dryad, and they went off giggling together.  The receptionist looked at Derrick thoughtfully.  &quot;You&#39;ve obviously been to see Hermes.&quot;  Derrick heard a clatter and turned to see a young centaur approach.  Looking to be in his late teens, the centaur was glossy black all over, animal hide covering his entire body except for the broad nostrils.  Up close, he was a lot horsier in the face, yet Derrick found the look very attractive. The centaur was ripped, with muscles bulging in his arms and chest, and grinned with a startling bright smile.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I can put you in a private room, give you a stall in the animal stables, or set you up as Champ&#39;s roomie.&quot;  She indicated the centaur.  &quot;This is Champ, and he tends to be very. uh, friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Champ chuckled.  &quot;My roommates usually end up as stallions or mares in the animal stables, but there are some centaurs and equids who used to stay with me, too. We still spend a lot of free time &#39;together&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick flushed again, understanding exactly what the centaur meant, and finding the prospect both appealing and scary. He also caught the fact that it sounded like all of Champ&#39;s former roommates were still changed.   Hermes must have done something inside Derrick&#39;s head as well, and even though he was aware that this could be permanent and he could end up as a monster or even a normal beast of burden, Derrick wasn&#39;t really concerned about any of the options.  &quot;Um, if it&#39;s my choice, I&#39;d like to...&quot;</p>
