<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But then IT happened. Our next impossible scientific breakthrough. We confirmed the existence of parallel dimensions.  We had fired up the Hadron collider once more, and this time, we&#39;d caught sight of another earth. It had only been for about ten seconds – like most theoretical science things, the first discovery was only a brief glimpse.<br />
<br />
It took about three months for us to figure out how to trigger the doorway into the other dimension on demand – that was one of our greatest strengths as a species and a united planet. With little to no argument or bargaining, we could bring together teams of the absolute best people in any field in relatively short order, and set them to work on a problem.  <br />
<br />
When we found out they were unchanged, we as a species found that our lycanthropic instincts were suddenly on fire with a hungry desire we had never experienced before. This was territory we could expand into. We could uplift the humans, making them more than they&#39;d ever been.  We could fuck them, turn them, and if they fought us...we could kill them. Even our youngest wolves would be able to literally conquer whole battalions of human soldiers – and we knew this because we&#39;d been those same people. This new dimension would one day be just as we were. And the best part was that we had already opened short term doors into ten different parallel earths. We could continue this infinitely. <br />
<br />
We weren&#39;t so foolish as to go in blind, however. We knew that some reconnaissance would be necessary, no matter which dimension we chose to start our conquest with. Five dimensions were selected, with each being assigned a team of three infiltrators. That&#39;s where I and my triad came into this whole story.<br />
<br />
In my old life, I was military, as was my wife, Tabitha, and our lover, Kyra. Kyra worked in the cryptography division, and had been working for the NSA when the great changing happened. I&#39;d settled into life as a police officer, after years of being in the infantry of the army. Tabitha had been a combat medic, though once she&#39;d moved into the private sector, she&#39;d worked as a virologist for the CDC. <br />
<br />
We&#39;d been selected due to our connections – I&#39;d actually gone to high school with one of the men who ended up heading up the research on the dimensional door. He was beyond brilliant- his brain operated on a level that I couldn&#39;t even comprehend, even in high school. He and I had become friends in our senior year, after I&#39;d protected him from an ass-kicking, because he was somewhat awkward, and very gay. We&#39;d remained friends despite our differences, and despite how differently our life paths had turned out. <br />
<br />
He&#39;d personally campaigned for me to be on one of the teams, and it was later decided that both Tabitha and Kyra would be perfect for the mission as well. My females were as eager as I was when we got the final debrief, standing in front of the dimensional door.<br />
<br />
“We&#39;re going to make every effort to bring you back safely,” Jerry told us. “We&#39;re going to open this door for three minutes each day, at the same time and location. That&#39;s the plan, at least.” He shifted his weight a bit uncomfortably and looked a little nervous. “You guys realize that uhh..something can go wrong, and..it..uhh..might make it impossible to get you out, right?”<br />
<br />
The gravity of the situation hung in the air. We were leaving our pack in the interest of exploration. I wondered if this was how the first astronauts felt as they sat on the launch pad.  “Yeah, Jer..” I said. “We understand.”<br />
<br />
“Your mission this time is really simple though,” he told us. “Just get a handle on the situation on that earth. As best we can tell, based on our educated calculations, this door&#39;s gonna open in the US, and judging by a soil sample we gathered from the drone we sent through a few nights ago, it&#39;s in Texas. So there..uh..shouldn&#39;t be a language issue or culture issue..if that earth is as close to ours as we theorize. But we uhh..we don&#39;t..we don&#39;t know.” His expression was slightly grim, and his worry was apparent for anyone to see.<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s no way to be sure, hun..” Kyra said, reaching out and touching his forearm lightly to reassure him. Prior to the great change, this would have been beyond inappropriate. We would have been obsessed with rank and regulations, particularly on such an important and groundbreaking mission. But now we understood the importance of the mental state of people. “That&#39;s why we&#39;re going in the first place. But we&#39;ll be fine, and..we&#39;ll be home before you know it.”<br />
<br />
Her touch calmed him instantly, having the desired effect. “I know you guys will,” he said, his posture and expression projecting the confidence a project lead should have. “So, yeah. We presume that this world is very close to our own, possibly almost identical. For all we know, this world is only a parallel due to a small and unnoticeable difference between ours. One thing we can&#39;t tell is where it is on the timeline. We have two competing theories, about whether all the parallels are on the same timeline, meaning that today here is today THERE, or if you might end up at a different point in time. So we need to, if at all possible, ascertain the date.”<br />
<br />
I nodded. “Shouldn&#39;t be an issue if their world is anything close to ours, or even our recent history. It&#39;ll just be a matter of finding a newspaper or something similar.”<br />
<br />
Jerry nodded in agreement. “Yeah, and if you can acquire things like a newspaper or a magazine, try and bring them back.  Or nonfiction books, etc. Anything we can get our people on, for deeper analysis to find out what that world&#39;s geopolitical situation is like.”<br />
<br />
Tabitha spoke up quietly. “What about..interactions with people?”<br />
<br />
“Right now, try to keep anything too complex to a minimum. Remember, we&#39;re outsiders, even if they don&#39;t know it and we seem like regular people to their eyes. You shouldn&#39;t have an issue with the moon; we&#39;ve already ascertained that the moon phase is the same, thanks to a camera drone we flew in at night. So there&#39;s no reason to worry about that this week, since we&#39;re only at a quarter waxing right now. We realize that you might have a situation where transformation is the only option, but that particular surprise is our biggest strength when we eventually decide to move on this dimension. So if any natives find out what you are, they must be killed or turned.”<br />
<br />
I found myself drooling slightly at the idea of turning one of them; the thought of tasting blood was enticing.  New instincts asserted themselves in my mind, and I knew that my fangs or my cum would bring these other ungifted humans into the pack, if they faced me. My feral side was eager for an opportunity to let go in a world of unsuspecting prey.  My eyes darted to Tabitha and Kyra, and my nostrils flared as I caught their heightened scents. They&#39;d arrived at the same conclusions I had, and had the same desires.<br />
<br />
“Guys..uhh..” Jerry said. His hand shook a bit, and he wiped some sweat from his brow. His eyes glanced down at my crotch and he licked his lips in a combination of nervousness and mild arousal.  “Get a handle on yourselves..we..we don&#39;t need to lose control here, and you don&#39;t need to lose control over there.” He and I had been intimate a few times when the full moon rose, and I smiled at him, remembering just how good his mouth could feel on my cock. <br />
<br />
“I think we&#39;re ready, Jer..” I said, keeping the smirk on my face. “Unless you can think of a compelling reason for us to stay longer.”<br />
<br />
“N..no..” he said, pushing a button on the tablet in his hands. The crackling hum of energy started, and the empty doorframe in front of us filled with an image of the other earth. It was strange, looking at the soft rolling hills, when we were literally standing inside a building.  “Come back safe,” he said.<br />
<br />
And so, we stepped through the doorway.<br />
<br />
It wasn&#39;t an immediate emergence into the other earth. It felt like we were almost treading in place, taking five or ten steps to bridge the gap. We could feel static electricity, or something like it, tingling across our bodies, and our hair stood on end. And then that sensation ended, and we were standing in the same scene we&#39;d surveyed a minute earlier.<br />
<br />
We turned, glancing back at the doorway, and saw the proud, yet concerned faces of Jerry and the rest of the support staff as they watched us. We saw them applaud in unison, but we couldn&#39;t hear them; apparently sound didn&#39;t travel through the doorway.<br />
<br />
And then the door disappeared. “Set an alarm for ten minutes ago on your phones,” I said. Tabitha and Kyra nodded. “That way we&#39;ll be early for any extraction.”<br />
<br />
And so, our true adventure began.</p>
