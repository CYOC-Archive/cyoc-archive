<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I went to room 311 and knocked, hoping that Lara would answer. I remember she didn&#39;t feel well and likely wanted -er needed my help. Well, to be perfectly honest I knew she wanted sex, and strangely enough so did I. Even though I had filled Charity about a dozen times, my balls still felt bloated and heavy and my libido still hadn&#39;t tapped out. Whatever positive thoughts I had about Lara as my mate were being replaced with worry. Girls staring at me with nothing but carnal lust in their eyes, my unnatural ability to fuck so quickly within such a short amount of time, what if all this got out of hand. Already there were five girls vying for my attention, three of which I hadn&#39;t fucked yet, and two others who can&#39;t seem to get enough. Having knocked several times I finally abandoned my mission and returned to my own room next door, expecting to see her there sitting on my bed all casually. Yet, as I opened the door... nothing... no one. I flicked on the light half expecting Lara to be smiling from somewhere in the shadows. I was wrong. This was odd. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara,&quot; I called in the dark room. No reply. I suddenly felt a deep anxiety wash over me. Holy shit, where was she? Was she in trouble? Did she use too much magic? &quot;Lara, Lara!&quot; I called out repeatedly, steadily raising my voice hoping that she would reply from somewhere, anywhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right here, honey,&quot; came a giggling response. I looked around, the voice sounding very close but she didn&#39;t seem to be around me unless she was playing some twisted joke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where, I don&#39;t see you,&quot; I replied, now even more worried. <br />
<br />
&quot;Up here,&quot; she laughed again. I looked directly up to see her curvaceous form hoving in the air, her back touching the ceiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara,&quot; I gasped, wide-eyed. &quot;What are you doing up there? Are you stuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Stuck? Of course not, silly,&quot; she giggled before dropping- well, more like floating gracefully to the floor, her tip toes halting her descent. Honestly by the way she moved I could have sworn she were an angel. &quot;I&#39;m just having a little fun exploring my new powers,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Look,&quot; she exclaimed as she seemed to push off the floor and rise majestically into the air. &quot;I can fly now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I stared dumbfounded, realizing how truly different she was from us humans. &quot;Wait, couldn&#39;t you always? I mean, you have wings right?&quot; I asked, feeling incredibly ignorant. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... well yes we&#39;re born with one set of wings, primarily used in combat, but there&#39;s another set that can only be acquired through evolution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what you&#39;re like a pokemon?&quot; I chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do I look like any pokemon you ever met?&quot; she scowled, shoving my face into her massive boobs, barely allowing me to breath through her cleavage. I shook my head no to which she smiled and floated backward. She seemed so weightless, as though we were in a zero gravity environment and she had forgotten to magnetize her boots. &quot;For us, evolution is like a metamorphosis. We gain sexual energy and it eventually changes us from the inside out. For example,&quot; she waved her finger and from her back appeared opague membranous wings comparable to that of a butterfly or fairy- wait... at that moment I remembered what she had said when we first met. Succubi were more like fairies. So... this is what she meant. I admired her newfound wings, their aquamarine tint matching that of her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what do you think? Pretty?&quot; she asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Majestic,&quot; I whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, baby, you do know how to flatter a girl.&quot; She descended back to the ground right in front of me and got very comfortable, pressing herself against my body while wrapping an arm around my head and kissing me deeply. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for worrying you,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was obvious by the way you were calling out for me, besides, I can tell most of your thoughts before you even speak them,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Just like I know you were a naughty boy letting Su and Aubrey jerk you off.&quot;<br />
<br />
I froze, feeling like a husband caught cheating. &quot;Lara listen I&#39;m-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hush, I&#39;m not upset with you. I&#39;m just disappointed none of them mounted your cock, especially after I used the last of my magic on your balls. I was hoping it would at least convince Aubrey to spear herself on you. I can&#39;t get sexual energy if you don&#39;t actually have sex you know,&quot; she lectured. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, trust me, you&#39;re not the only one disappointed,&quot; I huffed, feeling a sort of sting as I said it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well it wasn&#39;t a complete loss, you made out like a bandit with Charity,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Can&#39;t wait to siphon that from your dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, if nothing I did helped you gain power yet, then how are you okay? You were weak when I last saw you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Sophia was a generous donor,&quot; Lara grinned. &quot;She tasted so good. I think I may have turned her lesbian, though. Oh, well, we&#39;ll have you spear her and then she&#39;ll be fucking you as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, about that, don&#39;t you think these changes are getting a little... too much?&quot; I asked, not really wanting to. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you ask? Is something wrong?&quot; she blinked, alighting on the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just that every human with ovaries looks at me like I&#39;m a ribeye steak,&quot; I muttered. &quot;That and I don&#39;t think the amount I&#39;ve cum in one day is natural, nor the fact that I still want sex after pumping Charity full of cream a dozen times.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;17,&quot; Lara corrected. <br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I stammered, hoping she wasn&#39;t referring to what I thought she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;You came in Charity seventeen times. I counted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?&quot; I gaffawed. <br />
<br />
&quot;I told you: psychic connection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s true, does it only work one way?&quot; I asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;For now. I can&#39;t have a change that drastic happen instantly, so I slow down the connection. Don&#39;t worry eventually you&#39;ll be as connected to me as I am to you. In the meantime, flesh is far more maleable than the mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... well what all do you plan on doing with my flesh?&quot; I asked, uncertain I wanted to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, how about making you a bit... bigger,&quot; she smiled as I felt my balls grow again. I looked down as the bulge in my pants began expanding. &quot;That&#39;s it baby, get nice and big for Lara,&quot; she smiled. I felt the pressure as my sack outgrew its home, the growth finally stopping. Curious I pulled down my pants to see the new gargantuan me. Each testicle was the size of a ping pong ball and felt heavy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Lara, what did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why, increased your load capacity... and multiplied its thickness. You&#39;ll be shooting ropes the next time you cum,&quot; she grinned. &quot;But what&#39;s a rope without a nice big stake?&quot; I felt a pressure again, my dick growing to full erection before thickening and pushing an extra inch out. &quot;Charity loved you at seven inches, imagine how much fun she&#39;ll have with eight,&quot; Lara smirked as the growth stopped. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, honey, that won&#39;t be all for changes, just enough for now,&quot; she smiled, touching my cheek. &quot;For now, I want you to fuck me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I smiled and reached for her, the other giggling as she moved away. &quot;Not like this, silly. Like this,&quot; she grinned. A sparkle seemed to surround her as horns grew from her temple curling down around her head points coming back to their roots. A spaded tale popped out from just abover her big ass and her ear that had remained largely hidden by her red hair were now growing upward, the points becoming more distinct. Just as I thought she was done she began to get smaller. <br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait, Lara, what are you doing?&quot; I asked, wondering if her shrinking was planned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; she giggled as her frame fell to five foot even, then four and a half, then stopping at four foot even. &quot;Have you ever wanted to fuck a fairy?&quot; she laughed. &quot;Perhaps I should be a little smaller for you, though. Perhaps just the right size for a cocksleeve. I can do it you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks,&quot; I smiled. &quot;I&#39;d rather not break you in half with this massive member you gave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lara smiled, grabbing her tit and playing with it while giving me a lusty look. &quot;I want you to dominate me, Jethro. Make me feel small... and weak... like you own me.&quot; <br />
<br />
I looked down at her tiny frame, my erection somehow getting harder. She wanted me to what? I saw her shrink an extra inch, now only three foot, eleven. &quot;I&#39;ll keep shrinking until you do,&quot; she teased, decreasing another inch. Not wanting to wait any longer I grabbed hold of her narrow waist and hefted her up, practically tossing her on the bed. She laughed as I knelt down and began sucking at her tiny clit and slit. She looked like a voluptuous woman that had been zapped by a shrink ray. I wondered if she would break but her moans of lust dispatched all my internal misgivings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lara,&quot; I muttered, &quot;I&#39;m going to put it in.&quot; She didn&#39;t reply but instead looked up with great andticipation as I brought my rod to bear. She smiled, daring me to penetrate her, so I did. She gasped, gripping the sheets in reply and letting out a squeel the likes of which I had never heard. Damn she was tight, her miniaturized pussy spreading with my large cock. I didn&#39;t give her time to settle but commenced to thrust inside of her. Just as she was getting used to it, a fun thought popped in my head. Grabbing her by the waist I lifted her up, bouncing her up and down on my manhood. She moaned and giggled, leaning in as close to my larger body as she could. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck Jethro, I wish you&#39;d take the lead more often,&quot; she sighed as I increased her pace. I shoved her down violently, not worried about hurting her as the greater force seemed to be appreciated. &quot;Are you close?&quot; she asked. I ignored her but she asked again to which I replied in the affirmative. &quot;Let it out, Jethro, fill me with everything you&#39;ve been saving up. I&#39;m ready.&quot; That was all I needed to hear, her encouragement like a trigger as I suddenly came, stronger than ever before. She said I&#39;d be cumming ropes, and it sure felt that way. I looked down to see Lara&#39;s expression filled with ecstacy and then, it grew. Right before my eyes her belly became distended, growing out from her further with each spasm I experienced. She looked like a rapidly growing expecting mother. The thought and sight brought with it more ropes as I came hard and fast. After several moments I was finally done, removing Lara and placing her on the bed. <br />
<br />
&quot;So much cum,&quot; she cooed, rubbing her bloated belly. &quot;I almost want to just keep it in here but... I need the magic,&quot; she smiled. Just as fast as her stomach bulged it began to flatten again until all signs of it had given way to her taught middrif. &quot;That was fun,&quot; she giggled, growing back to full size. &quot;Round two?&quot; she asked. I chuckled, having to decline, my stamina already seeming to have been borrowed from the night before. &quot;I know,&quot; she sighed, while cuddling up to me. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, though. You&#39;ll start to get used to it really soon.&quot;</p>
