<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cameron looked down and saw a chest absolutely rippling with powerful muscles and bristling with soft, brown fur. “Whoa… Dude, this is fucking trippy,” Cameron muttered, feeling unfamiliar and at home in this body at the same time. He looked at one hand and saw… his ordinary paw, claws clipped down to fit in his mitt comfortably. Nothing weird about that, right?<br />
<br />
Cameron blinked, then realized that he had just thought. ‘His mitt’? Cameron hadn’t played any sports since gym class in middle school, damn it! But this body seemed to disagree. He ran one paw up and down a thick, muscled arm, which was ripped with muscles and made even thicker by the soft fur covering it. His legs were like steel rods, not ridiculously thick but able to carry his huge body around the bases with almost no effort. The perfect body for a sending home runs out of the park, with big strong paws perfect for gripping a bat or pitching a flawless curveball.<br />
<br />
But it wasn’t just his physique that was strange. His face had become a long, furry muzzle, like an animal’s face but still retaining a resemblance to his human self. Atop his head was a crop of wavy, blond hair, with a pair of slightly rounded ears peeking out. A band of cream-colored fur around his chin gave the impression of a well-trimmed beard that contrasted nicely with the dark brown on the rest of his face.<br />
<br />
Cameron could only stare at the powerful animal person in the mirror, a solid 5’10” of sculpted muscle. “I’m… some kind of dog…” was all he could mutter to himself, feeling his new ears and muzzle as new memories started to force themselves into his head.<br />
<br />
No, not just a dog. A raccoon dog. A tanuki. His dad, a former pro baseball player in the Japanese league always insisted on ‘tanuki’ instead of ‘raccoon dog’. Cameron had inherited his dad’s physique, so it was only natural that he start playing ball from a young age, getting a full ride into college on a sports scholarship.<br />
<br />
“No… I don’t… I already graduated… Computer science…” Cameron muttered, gripping his head in one of his paws, steadying himself against a nearby dresser.<br />
<br />
“Damn it, kid! Get a hold of yourself!” the piping voice of his roommate popped up behind him, and Cameron felt a wave of annoyance fill him, sending his old self into the back of his mind for a moment. Who’s that pipsqueak calling ‘kid’!?<br />
<br />
Cameron spun around, feeling a heavy weight around his waist flop around and smack into the little mouse behind him. Cameron looked down and saw the trademark attribute of the tanuki; an absolutely massive pair of furry balls, along with a thick cock that was still half-hard from staring at himself earlier. Looking at his massive package made Cameron chuckle as he remembered all the jokes about ‘balls’ that he’d gotten from his teammates in the locker room…<br />
<br />
“You fucker, did you just teabag me!?” Patrick shouted, interrupting Cameron’s reminiscing. He was rubbing his face and still staring at the tanuki’s huge balls in shock.<br />
<br />
“No helping where these guys go, little buddy,” Cameron joked, hefting his nuts playfully before grabbing a jockstrap from the dressed and pulling it on to keep his junk under control. “But, a cute little guy like you probably enjoyed a faceful of a real man’s meat.”<br />
<br />
Patrick was trembling in anger hearing that, his hairless tail whipping around as he tried to come up with a comeback. “Y-you… you damn brute! Calling me cute isn’t going to make me forgive you for that!” he sputtered, despite feeling his unimpressive little dick start to harden as he continued to get an eyeful of his roommate’s sexy body…<br />
<br />
“No! Damn it, what the hell’s going on here?” Patrick said, tearing himself away from Cameron’s body in frustration. His chest was heaving as he tried to come to terms with everything that was going on. Why was he a mouse? Why was he some wimpy kid, barely even 18? And why couldn’t he stop staring at the muscular tanuki he was apparently sharing a room with… God, just the thought of being mere feet away from that sexy bastard made his cock start drooling…<br />
<br />
Cameron looked at the little guy having what appeared to be a panic attack in front of him. A new memory started to wriggle into his consciousness, of Soren sitting Cameron down for a chat the night before. “Patrick… he’s s little guy, and he really wants to be here for the kiddos,” he remembered Soren saying in his deep baritone. “But, I’m not sure he’s up to the task, physically speaking. Could you stay with him and keep him from pushing himself too far?” Cameron remembered being annoyed at the request, but put up with his request because he respected the big bear so much.<br />
<br />
Cameron suddenly became aware of all the strange new memories flooding into his mind, and realized that something very, very strange was happening. He dropped his confident posture, becoming as meek and nervous as he had been the night before. “L-look, Patrick…” Cameron stammered, suddenly feeling embarrassed about how he had been flaunting his body in front of the mouse. “I’m really sorry… W-we need to figure out what’s going on, right? It’s like… Like I keep turning into someone else.”<br />
<br />
Patrick looked at the huge yet nervous tanuki man, and realized that despite their very different physiques, they seemed to be in the same position. As much as he hated to admit it, Patrick realized he couldn’t do much heavy lifting in this little body, so maybe having a big guy around would help, in case things went badly at camp.<br />
<br />
Patrick started to look around for anything to cover up his slim, effeminate body, digging through the dresser. “Tell me if you find my cigarettes,” he said, despite feeling like his lungs were clearer than they’d been in years.<br />
<br />
“Those things will stunt your growth, squirt,” Cameron quipped, earning a furious glare from the little mouse as they got ready to head out for the day.<br />
<br />
“Shut up. Let’s just get out of here,” Patrick snapped as he pulled out his counselor’s uniform, which was so small it could almost be mistaken for a camper’s version. “Ugh… this is gonna suck.”</p>
