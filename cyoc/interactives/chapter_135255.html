<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Off to your side, a man calmly strides out into the clearing.  He seems like he&#39;s just awoken from slumber, blinking as his eyes adjust to the light and stretching his arms and legs.  However, as he stretches, the light catches his arms, and you see the glitter of rubbery, golden scales running down the length of them to very lizard-like hands.  They still posses 5 vaguely human digits, if you disregard the scaly texture, but at the end of each are viscous talons.  He continues idly working his limbs, apparently not yet aware of your presence.<br />
<br />
“Oh, well this guy probably isn&#39;t who you&#39;re looking for, but he&#39;s definitely not the worst we could do.”  Tex whispers, hiding behind you.<br />
<br />
“You know him?”  You ask.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that&#39;s Treks.  Don&#39;t ever call him that.  He hates that name.  In fact he hates most humans, or anything he considers weak and beneath him.  Quite the ego on that one.   That&#39;s why we tease him with the nickname, old &#39;king lizard&#39;.  You know, like the dinosaur?”  Tex explains.<br />
<br />
“If he hates people, then isn&#39;t he bad news?” <br />
<br />
“It&#39;s not the killing or eating kind of hate.  Just the &#39;not worthy to address me&#39; sort.  He may ignore you entirely, but if he engages you, just be very respectful.  But also be firm!  Don&#39;t kowtow to him and he&#39;ll like you better, but definitely definitely definitely don&#39;t do anything to insult him.  Oh, he&#39;s looking this way.  Aaaand he&#39;s approaching.  Well, uh, good luck!”  And with that encouragement, you hear her flutter off  into the trees behind you.<br />
<br />
As &#39;Treks&#39; casually strides towards you, you realize that he&#39;s a bit larger than a normal human, easily seven or eight feet tall.  Scales cover his whole body, running up his arms and down his chest and torso to his legs.  Stripes and tiles of slightly different colors create intricate patterns across his skin.  His torso looks more or less human in shape, rippling in taught muscle down to a crotch that is devoid of genitalia as far as you can see.  At the bottom of his ankles are very reptilian feet, with four toes extending forward and one back, each tipped with a claw.  His scales end at the base of his neck, where his skin gains more of a fleshy texture, if not color.  Most striking however, is that instead of hair, the scales start again and run along his scalp where they extend out into a second, very lizard-like face on the back of his head.  Bright green irises stare down at you as he seems to examine your trunk and elephantine ears.  His voice is deep, but somewhat clicky on certain sounds as he addresses you, only moving the one human mouth.<br />
<br />
“Well then, the feast has only just begun and already I meet what appears to be a unique human.  I sense that you&#39;ve found yourself some spoils in what must have been recent combat.  Tell me, how have you fared so far on this evening of the great dawn.”<br />
<br />
You look up at him in awe for a moment before awkwardly answering “I fare well I suppose, all things considered.”<br />
<br />
“A reasonable answer as any.  These are not easy times for prey, and they will only be getting harder as more of us awaken.  Yet you seem to be rising to the occasion.  Even the valor of the weak is to be admired, just as the dimmest flame shines brightly in the darkness.”  He beams down at you.  “Do you seek to struggle against more of the beasts?  If so, I can aid you on your quest.  There are plenty more rewards to be won.”<br />
<br />
“I, er, no.  Not presently at least.  I barely got out alive from the first one, and I&#39;ve seen others who weren&#39;t so fortunate.  Right now I just want to survive before any, uh, conquest.” <br />
<br />
Treks considers your response.  “Well, a bit disappointing, but I suppose it takes time to nurture the fire.  I wish you well on your travels and hope one day you burn in full splendor.  But for now, if not glory, what <i>do</i> you quest for?”<br />
<br />
You think for a moment, unsure of how to respond.  “Well, I suppose I first seek to restore my human features, but after that--” you&#39;re cut off by a snarl.<br />
<br />
“Restore?!  What do you mean RESTORE?  You unshackled yourself from hindrance of your nature, seizing a higher form from those above you and you speak now of RESTORATION?!”  He twists his head back and forth in anger.  With another snarl, he turns it impossibly far, and it continues twisting until the lizard face from the back now stares down at you.  A tail sprouts out from his lower back and his torso leans forward as he crouches into a more predatory stance, his feet raising up off their heels.<br />
<br />
“I gave you the honor of addressing you personally.  <b>ME</b>!”  His voice is now much more raspy and hissing.  “And then you spit on the nature of your victory?  Of the potential power given to you?”<br />
<br />
“I... It&#39;s just” you try to stammer out.<br />
<br />
“No, there is no excuse for such blasphemy.  If you desire weakness so much, then it will be granted to you.  But you will come to appreciate your blessing.”  With that, his hands deformed and shifted, re-solidifying into two giant snake heads.  His arms now suddenly bending and flexing in a serpentine manner both raise back and open their mouths, ready to strike.  You raise your hands in front of yourself in defense.  They lunge in tandem.<br />
<br />
Rather than biting, the snake heads each open their mouths wider as they approach.  Each one targets an outstretched arm, taking your hands into their mouths.  They move further, quickly snaking their way up your arms until each maw rests open on your shoulders.  Then they begin to shift again.  For a moment, both of your arms are completely enveloped in a swirling mass of golden liquid latex.  You feel it surging around them and squeezing them tighter and tighter.  Then you feel nothing.<br />
<br />
The latex slows down and begins to retreat back to reform into Treks&#39;s arms.  As it does, it leaves empty air behind.  You dart your head back and forth in panic, your trunk and ears flopping as they lag behind the motion.  Your torso now extends straight up your sides, rounding off at a pair of reduced shoulders.  There&#39;s no trace left of your arms or even your shirtsleeves, for that matter.  You crane your neck to see a flat patch of skin roughly where your armpit just was.  You look back up at Treks in terror.<br />
<br />
“What have you done?!”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ve helped you get exactly what you want.  There&#39;s nothing more human than helplessness.  You want to be prey?  Now you&#39;re all the more easy to prey upon.  You didn&#39;t like your trunk before?  Now it&#39;s the only arm you have left.  Your ears?  You&#39;ll need them all the more to hear danger approaching so you can hide like the weakling you are.  Maybe you&#39;ll learn.  I won&#39;t hold my breath.  Farewell, <i>human</i>,” he finished, emphasizing the word with utter disgust. He then turned back towards the trees and stalked off into the night, walking in a distinctly more reptilian manner than when you first saw him.<br />
<br />
 You stood there, continuing to examine the space where your arms used to be.  Realizing the truth of what Treks just told you, you realize that you need to learn to control your trunk and fast.  You cross your eyes and peer down its length.<br />
<br />
“Just curl it up a bit.  You saw elephants at the zoo do that.  It can&#39;t be too hard.  Elephant 101. Okay.”  You concentrate.  You manage a twitch.  You focus harder.  Two twitches. <br />
<br />
“Aaargh!” you exclaim in frustration, shaking your head back and forth.  This only causes your trunk to whip around, further annoying you that it&#39;s far more movement than you&#39;re capable of otherwise.  “I don&#39;t have time to learn like this!”<br />
<br />
You hear a flutter behind you as Tex returns from hiding.<br />
<br />
“Human, what did you do?!”<br />
<br />
“What does it look like?  Apparently, I insulted him.” you shoot back angrily.<br />
<br />
“Well, we need to work on your listening skills, then.  But all things considered, it didn&#39;t go too bad for a first attempt.  At least you have a trunk left, which can kind of work like a replacement arm.”  You just sigh at her in exasperation.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, so I&#39;ve heard.  But I can&#39;t even move the damn thing, so I don&#39;t see how that helps!” You give it a twitch for emphasis.<br />
<br />
“Well, you can twitch it.”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s not exactly fine motor control.”<br />
<br />
“Well, can you control where it twitches?”<br />
<br />
“I-- hmm.  I guess I haven&#39;t tried that yet.”<br />
<br />
“You gotta walk before you can run, Human.  Here, try to twitch towards me.”  She flies down next to where the tip of your trunk hangs, hovering a few inches away.  You focus and manage to make it jolt roughly in her direction.<br />
<br />
“Hah!  Good!  Now this side!”  She circles around it.  You jolt your trunk a few inches towards her again.  “See?  You&#39;re already making progress.  Now try to see if you can flex this bit.”  She flies up to touch a portion of your trunk that you focus on moving.  <br />
<br />
The two of you continue like this for several minutes, focusing on activating specific muscles.  By the end, you feel like you&#39;ve gained a bit more control over the strange appendage, and the focus helped take your mind off what just happened.  Now that you&#39;ve calmed down a bit, you ask Tex, “Alright, we&#39;re still out in the middle of this forest, and I&#39;m no closer to regaining my humanity.  What&#39;s our next move?”<br />
<br />
Tex thinks for a bit before answering.</p>
