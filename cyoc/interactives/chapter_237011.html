<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ryan stood in front of the mirror in the sneaker store, staring down at the green and white Air Jordan 4s he had just slipped on. Something about them felt… right, even though they were far from the kind of shoes he usually wore. He had hesitated before buying them, his mind racing with doubts—he wasn’t the type of guy who wore Jordans. He wasn’t the type of guy who wore anything cool. But here he was, and something inside him told him that these shoes were different.<br />
<br />
He turned to walk out of the store, but as soon as his foot hit the floor, a strange sensation shot up his leg. It started at his toes—a tightness, like the shoes were gripping him too hard. He paused, frowning, trying to shake it off, but the feeling only grew. It wasn’t just his feet. The tightness spread, crawling up his calves, into his thighs, pulling at his skin and muscles. He gasped, reaching out for the wall to steady himself, but his hand slipped against the smooth surface as his whole body convulsed.<br />
<br />
A sharp pain exploded in his feet, and Ryan doubled over, staring down in horror as his toes began to stretch, his feet growing within the Jordans. His shoes, which had fit perfectly just moments ago, now felt suffocating. He tried to yank them off, but his fingers fumbled, unable to grasp the laces. His feet continued to swell, the bones cracking and shifting, muscles bulging as they pressed against the leather. The shoes seemed to stretch with him, groaning under the pressure but never giving way.<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned, a mix of pain and something else—a strange, building pleasure—coursing through him. His legs began to bulk up, calves swelling, growing thick with muscle. His once-skinny jeans were now struggling to contain him, the fabric pulling tighter and tighter until the seams began to pop. He gritted his teeth, feeling the denim rip at the knees, the tears snaking up his legs as his thighs expanded, filling out the space where there had once been only skin and bone.<br />
<br />
His breath came in ragged gasps, his chest heaving as the transformation surged upward. His torso expanded, ribs widening, shoulders broadening as new muscle rippled across his body. The hoodie he’d worn for years—oversized, baggy, a security blanket in its own way—stretched across his chest, the fabric protesting loudly before splitting down the back. The once-soft material tore away, exposing the hard, chiseled muscles beneath.<br />
<br />
Ryan’s arms jerked, his biceps swelling, triceps pushing against the remnants of his sleeves until they, too, burst open. His arms, once weak and narrow, were now thick and powerful, veins snaking across the surface like ropes. His fists clenched involuntarily, knuckles cracking as his hands grew to match the rest of him.<br />
<br />
He was panting now, his heart pounding as the pleasure overtook the pain, each tear of fabric and pop of bone bringing a wave of satisfaction. His stomach tightened, abs pressing through the skin, hard and defined, like they had been carved from stone. His baggy shirt was gone, shredded to tatters around him. He caught a glimpse of himself in a nearby mirror—his chest heaving, a sheen of sweat coating his new body.<br />
<br />
His reflection was a stranger’s. His face, once soft and unremarkable, was now sharp, angular, his jawline prominent, cheekbones defined. His hair, once a mop of unruly strands, had styled itself into a perfect, casual quiff. Even his eyes had changed—there was a new intensity in them, a confidence he had never known.<br />
<br />
But the change wasn’t just physical. Ryan could feel something shifting in his mind as well. His thoughts, once filled with awkwardness and insecurity, began to blur. Memories of being the quiet, nerdy guy, always overlooked, faded like an old dream. His mind filled with new desires, new instincts—confidence, swagger, the urge to be seen, to dominate every space he walked into.<br />
<br />
He let out a deep, guttural groan as the transformation finally slowed, the last of his old self melting away. Ryan—no longer the awkward, skinny kid from Brooklyn—stood tall, broad-shouldered and muscular, a smirk playing on his lips. His clothes had been completely torn apart by his growing body, leaving him nearly naked in the middle of the store.<br />
<br />
And then, as if waiting for him, he spotted a pile of clothes nearby. They weren’t the kind of clothes he would have ever picked out before, but now, they seemed perfect. He walked over, his footsteps heavy, filled with a newfound weight and confidence. He grabbed the slim-fit ripped jeans, sliding them on with ease, feeling how perfectly they hugged his muscular legs. Next came the black graphic T-shirt, tight across his chest, showing off every ridge of his abs and arms. A sleek bomber jacket went on over the shirt, the leather cool against his skin, completing the look.<br />
<br />
Finally, he saw the G-Shock watch sitting on the counter, its matte black face calling to him. He snapped it onto his wrist, the perfect accessory to his new persona.<br />
<br />
Ryan took one last look in the mirror, admiring the stranger staring back at him. The shy, invisible nerd was gone. In his place stood someone powerful, attractive, and effortlessly cool. His old self was a distant memory, replaced by a man who exuded confidence and strength. Smiling to himself, he adjusted his jacket, ran a hand through his styled hair, and strode out of the store, ready to take on the world.</p>
