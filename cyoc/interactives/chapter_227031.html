<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hurry up Jason my folks will be here any minute,&quot; Lisa Turner called. After a bit of drama involving her parents becoming magical teenagers, Lisa and her sisters decided on a night out. For Lisa, Kellie Pendragon, and Ann alcohol was a solution to this latest wrinkle in their lives. &quot;So who&#39;s going to be there,&quot; Jason called.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kellie, her ex Jack,&quot; Lisa answered. &quot;And Ann and Jackie. Ann is still a bit thrown off by the whole, &#39;my mom is some magical girl from Japan thing or whatever&#39;, not to mention finding out my dad was in Vietnam or that she got pregnant at her freaking prom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are we sure about that last one though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um almost 100%,&quot; Lisa countered. &quot;Mom and Dad got married in 70, Kellie was born early in 71. Mom kinda hid the fact she graduated that year. She kind of let us believe she graduated in 69, a year after Dad. Chances are Moms Senior Prom was a special event, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I know,&quot; Jason called back. &quot;Just surprised you seem so casual about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m very good at putting up a front,&quot; Lisa smirked. &quot;But that&#39;s why the O&#39;Toole girls are getting drunk tonight. And it&#39;s why my folks are babysitting tonight, they owe me.&quot; Jason simply glanced out from the bathroom, giving his wife a nod as he continued to brush his teeth. Lisa and her sisters had certainly been thrown for a loop with the amount of secrets her parents had been keeping. Martin and Marilyn had seemed like a perfect couple, the responsible albeit boring adults that their daughters just couldn&#39;t quite live up to. That they had experienced so much hardship, dealt with as much drama as they had in their youth was shocking. The sound of the bell ringing now drew Lisa&#39;s attention. Making her way towards the door, the 44 year old woman woman now raised an eyebrow as she gazed at her parents.  &quot;You gotta be kidding me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Greetings mame,&quot; Marilyn proclaimed. &quot;I am Solar Guardian Mars! Protector of love and justice throughout the Solar system. My fires of love and passion will burn away the evils of the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I am the Solar Sentinel,&quot; Martin proclaimed. &quot;Earth bound Protector of the pretty Soalr Guardians. My shield shall block all evil from harming the Solar Guardians on their mission of love.&quot; Lisa simply raised an eyebrow, staring at her parents. Both Martin and Marilyn appeared to have transformed before arriving, the pair of teens adorned in their magical outfits as well as looking far, far younger than Lisa was accustomed too. &quot;I don&#39;t have nearly enough alcohol in the house to deal with this,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Just get in here before the neighbors see you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marilyn giggled, grabbing her teenage husband&#39;s hand as she skipped into the Turner home. &quot;Thank you mame,&quot; Marilyn proclaimed. &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t recommend consuming alcohol. It can cause you to look far older than you appear to be.&quot; At Marilyn&#39;s quip, Lisa turned red with anger, scowling at her teenage mother. &quot;Just for that I&#39;m locking the liquor cabinet,&quot; she grumbled, stomping her way out if the room. &quot;And I better not catch you two making out on the couch!&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin and Marilyn couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. Marilyn had come up with the idea to transform into their Solar forms before arriving. After so many years of Lisa messing with her, a part of Marilyn wanted some payback. &quot;Okay you two,&quot; Lisa grumbled, narrowing her eyes as she glared at her teenage parents. &quot;Lynne is watching a movie in her room. When it&#39;s over, make sure she brushes her teeth then head to bed. Careful with her though, she has a tendency to procrastinate when it comes to bed time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont worry Lisa,&quot; Martin smiled. &quot;We can handle it. It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve babysat.&quot; Lisa wanted to say something, considering her parents looked like a pair of teenagers on their first job. Instead she simply grunted, casting Marilyn a sour look before exiting. &quot;Dont worry mame,&quot; Marilyn called. &quot;We&#39;ll make sure your daughter is well taken care of.&quot; Closing the door, Marilyn could see her husband stifling a laugh.  &quot;What Martin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you&#39;re having too much fun at your daughter&#39;s expense,&quot; Martin smirked. &quot;Was all that really necessary?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Considering how much of a wild card Lisa was as a teenager absolutely,&quot; Marilyn replied. As the couple made their way towards the couch, Martin watched as Marilyn now slipped out of her red heels, the young teen now rubbing her feet. &quot;Geez I forgot how painful heels could be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it probably has something to do with you being so much younger,&quot; Martin shrugged. &quot;I mean, you weren&#39;t wearing alot of heels when you a teenager.&quot; Marilyn simply nodded, the girl now stretching her legs, much to Martin&#39;s delight. No matter what age, Marilyn had always had fantastic looking legs. &quot;See something you like Sentinel?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin blushed, noting the coy look on his teenage wife&#39;s face. As he tried to stammer an answer, Marilyn could only giggle. It amazed the pair how sometimes they appeared to mirror their teenage appearance emotionally. &quot;Okay yeah you caught me,&quot; Martin sighed. &quot;But it&#39;s not my fault. You always had great legs Marilyn and I always thought you were the most beautiful girl in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was Marilyn&#39;s turn to blush, the teenage girls cheeks turning as red as her outfit as she shyly averted her eyes. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said softly before grunting in frustration. &quot;Ugh this is so annoying sometimes. Why do we feel like awkward teenagers when we look like this?&quot; Martin simply shrugged, the teenage boy inching closer as he now gently held Marilyn&#39;s hand. Both teens could feel their cheeks burning as they lovingly gazed into eachothers eyes. Slowly the pair moved closer, exchanging a tender kiss.<br />
<br />
For Marilyn and Martin, this simple, closed mouth kiss was more electric than any other gesture of love the pair had experienced. They hearts pounded, their minds racing, for the pair it felt like they were sharing a first kiss of true love. &quot;Well it does have some advantages,&quot; Martin grinned, the pair now giggling nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grandma? Grandpa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin and Marilyn turned, watching as their 4 year old granddaughter now slowly made her way downstairs. The girl curious as to  the pair of teenagers on the couch. Circling the pair, Lynne&#39;s eyes began to grow wide as she realized what was happening. &quot;You got magic too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats right,&quot; Marilyn smiled, the teenage girl jumping to her feet. &quot;What do you think Lynne? How do grandma and grandpa look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty,&quot; Lynne squealed, the preschooler jumping up and down excitedly. Martin now leaned back, watching grandmother and granddaughter play. It was odd yet satisfying for Martin. Usually Marilyn would be too tired to do anything more than bake or color with their energetic grandchild. Now though, Marilyn was a girl of nearly 16. Martin watched as the barefoot teenager happily ran and tumbled with her granddaughter, casting harmless spells and laughing. He had never see Marilyn so excited to play with Lynne before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lynne did you know grandpa is magic too,&quot; Marilyn exclaimed. Lynne looked at Martin, her eyes wide with wonder. &quot;You see that shield? Grandpa uses that to protect me. In fact, I bet grandpa could even deflect some of your biggest spells.&quot; Lynne&#39;s mouth was gaping in wonder, she rarely had a chance to show off her magic to her grandparents. &quot;Um dear what are you doing,&quot; Martin asked nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh quit being a stick in the mud Martin,&quot; Marilyn scoffed. &quot;Have some fun with your granddaughter.&quot; Martin now stood apprehensively, casting Lynne and Marilyn a concerned look as Lynne began to conjure a spell. Slowly a ball of fire the size of a basketball formed in the child&#39;s hands, Marilyn giggling as she encouraged the child. &quot;Cmon Lynne bigger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lynne giggled, the ball increasing in size much to Martin&#39;s chagrin. &quot;Bigger,&quot; Marilyn exclaimed happily, the ball reaching yoga ball status. &quot;Bigger Lynne! The Sentinel can take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Mars,&quot; Martin said nervously, looking at the ball of fire. Lynne had certainly outdone herself as the ball was close to 10 feet in diameter and still growing. &quot;Maybe that&#39;d big enough?&quot; Marilyn brushed off Martin&#39;s concerns, so caught up in the fun that she was having with Lynne. Martin though, was beginning to worry as the ball grew larger, now almost brushing the ceiling of the loving room. &quot;Marilyn?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay let it go,&quot; Marilyn exclaimed happily. With a girlish giggle, Lynne now released her spell, Martin bracing himself as the ball of flame the size of the living room barreled towards him. Grunting he now braced himself, the ball of fire colliding with his shield and slowly pushing him backwards. The heat was like a blast furnace, Martin beginning to sweat. With a yell, he now pushed back, causing the spell to break, and knocking everybody back with its shockwave. Marilyn gasped, quickly racing to her husband&#39;s side as he lay prone upon the living room floor. &quot;Oh my god Martin are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin blinked, gazing up into the worried teenage girls face. &quot;Are my eyebrows cinged,&quot; he asked. &quot;Maybe a little,&quot; Marilyn blushed. Martin nodded, a mischievous smile crossing his face he reached out, grabbing Marilyn&#39;s ankle and pulling her down. &quot;Maybe tone it down a bit from now on,&quot; he smirked. Marilyn nodded, blushing before she and Martin began to chuckle nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again! Again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin and Marilyn turned, noting the excited 4 year old now jumping up and down. As much fun as it was being magical teenagers, Martin and Marilyn would need to tone it back with a girl as powerful as Lynne.</p>
