<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Colin woke up after having some of the most pleasant dreams he had in a while. He could enjoy them without having the intrusion of Tom and the complicated mix of rivalry and old friendship that played a part in their modern dynamics. A deeper than usual yawn heralded Colin moving from the bedroom in toward the bathroom - his usual morning upkeep called. Colin didn&#39;t think of himself as a particularly vain man, but he did enjoy using a few products to make sure he didn&#39;t end up having to deal with acne or any unsightly blemishes.<br />
<br />
He pulled himself out of bed, clad in a pair of tighty whitie briefs that hugged his ass tighter today than they usually did. &quot;Oof...do I need to get some new underwear...?&quot; Colin contemplated as he tried to pry the underwear off, noting it was almost skin tight. He grumbled about it just figuring his underwear would shrink in the wash. Not yet noticing anything might be changed or even just not so normal about himself. He was after all just freshly awake - not even having drank any coffee yet.<br />
<br />
He checked his phone and sighed as he saw a message on his chat from Tom. It seemed he&#39;d realized Colin might&#39;ve been in a bad mood leaving the weight room yesterday and, being the guy he was, Tom had sent him a message; <i>Hey man. It&#39;s Tom. You&#39;ve been seeming kinda frustrated lately, and I&#39;m probably not helping with all the social media shit. How about we hit the gym tonight at 6:00, but no selfies or toks or anything. I&#39;m SO sorry - I must&#39;ve come off like an arrogant prick.</i><br />
<br />
Can&#39;t even be as arrogant openly as Colin thought he was... Well, he saw no reason not to. <i>It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s fine. You do you, Tom. I&#39;m game for a workout whenever.</i> <br />
<br />
Colin then walked into the bathroom, and got the first of many surprises that day.<br />
<br />
When he saw himself, Colin almost had to rub his eyes to make sure that he wasn&#39;t still dreaming, or seeing things. His lean body, usually trailing so far behind Tom&#39;s, was now puffed up with muscles in a way that reminded him of that sudden and inexorable growth that it seemed Tom so quickly underwent. His biceps now flexed at about 18.5 inches, fighting any effort to sleeve them up, and his triceps bulged outward like a horseshoe. His brawny shoulders seemed to look like great, perfectly proportioned round boulders, and the pumped up chest Colin now owned pushed his nipples out to the sides. Directly under was a set of six muscled abs, skinny boy abs no longer. <br />
<br />
Colin groped at his abs and the corresponding cut obliques, reaching up to his new pectorals and cupping them just as well. The sheer size was astonishing. And that was how he saw how wide his lats spread, and the width of his back as a whole. He even looked a fair bit more tanned than usual. <br />
<br />
The young man bit his lip and felt at his legs, thumping a muscular, tight bubble butt with one fist and chuckling to himself as he felt it, &quot;...A nice ass...I&#39;ve got such a nice ass!&quot; His hand continued, feeling up his muscular quads and thighs. He could feel the strength in them, knowing his days of lacking a good squat and deadlift were at an end. While he wasn&#39;t quite as huge as Tom on all fronts, he was pushing on it - his arms were oh so slightly bigger than Tom&#39;s, and while he lacked Tom&#39;s insane leg development, there was still room and time to improve now.<br />
<br />
Colin lightly bit his lip and pulled his tighty-whities down, gulping when a manhood that measured about an inch and a half longer than usual sprung up and proudly presented itself. &quot;Ohh fuck...&quot; He murmured, looking at it. At least it seemed like his balls weren&#39;t shrunk like a certain someone else&#39;s. To tell the truth, Colin&#39;s cock tended to bend a bit and curve up when he got fully erect, a fact he was insecure about whenever a woman shared his bed. Though not quite so much as to disrupt his sexual experiences.<br />
<br />
Now, it both had that, but also a good deal more size down there. <i>Nineteen, and I look this good. Hot damn.</i> Not that he could know he wasn&#39;t exactly nineteen any more. At least physically.<br />
<br />
Honestly, Colin was of the mind to just spend a bit of time in his apartment&#39;s bathroom. Looking at his newly muscled body, jerking off at his reflection. He finally felt like he was properly big enough to really challenge Tom - and that got him pretty excited. He just knew he couldn&#39;t keep this to himself. Girlfriend first...<br />
<br />
Not even putting on any clothes, Colin swaggered over to where he kept his cellphone plugged in overnight. He dialed in his girlfriend&#39;s number, and after a few rings he got his girl on the other end. Nicole Lutz was a tall, buxom blonde that he&#39;d met in the course of senior year of high school. She&#39;d helped cook for him, owing to her mother&#39;s job as a cook at a restaurant and the things that her mom had passed down to her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe! You wouldn&#39;t believe the good news I got this morning!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, hey Colin,&quot; it sounded like he&#39;d got her right in the middle of breakfast. &quot;Something going on? You do sound like you&#39;re in a better mood this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just noticed some really good results,&quot; he said as he casually flexed for a window just down the hall, tensing his abs and chest, &quot;You should come over some time soon. Take a look. I got plenty to appreciate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Colin, you&#39;ve always had a lot to appreciate, it&#39;s just you keep comparing yourself to Tom.&quot; She then paused - checking her schedule - and said, &quot;I can be over at...mm, how does 2 o&#39;clock sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that was just perfect. Two would give him plenty of time to let himself get familiar with his physique, he and his girlfriend could probably have as much sex as they could muster, and then later he could hit the gym. Show Tom once and for all that he was actually not gonna be outshined so easily. &quot;Oh that sounds perfect. I&#39;m looking forward to this, babe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so am I. Can you do that---that tiny pair of trunks? The ones that make you look like a Chippendales dancer?&quot; Nicole asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it. See you then.&quot; And with that the call ended, and Colin grinned at his reflection. There was something about his reflection that left him wondering if he was changing in more ways than just growing more muscular. But for now it was too slight for him to really see it. So for now he just figured that the band - obviously the inciting item for these changes - was just giving him a good thing. And he saw no reason to remove it as of yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;You and I...&quot; Colin murmured at his wrist, covered by the band, &quot;Will have quite some fun today, I feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could it make me even bigger...?&quot; As Colin went off to go get his breakfast and maybe enjoy a warm up workout in the morning, he hoped he might see more results like what he enjoyed so far...</p>
