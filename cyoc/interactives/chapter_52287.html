<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It must've been a good omen, Blaine thought when he found a locker <br />
with his name on it. Then he'd opened the locker and been sucked <br />
inside naked.  Now he hung there in the darkness with his legs doubled <br />
over and  the locker ceiling hook jammed into his mouth.  He didn't <br />
understand how it was possible for his forehead to be jammed against <br />
the metal locker roof and folded back against his now apparently soft, <br />
malleable and empty skull.  His whole body seemed to be hollow inside.  <br />
It was like he'd been skinned alive, and hung out to dry, and somehow <br />
his skin retained his mind and soul.  It made no sense.  Blaine's <br />
throat felt dry.  He couldn't close his hooked mouth or even swallow.<br />
<br />
There was a clanking sound, and Malcolm was standing outside the <br />
locker naked.  Dwight Perry and his gang of thugs was with them. They <br />
were all grinning.<br />
<br />
Blaine was confused.  Malcolm's suddenly powerful hands unhooked <br />
Blaine and lifted him out of the locker unfolding him. He held Blaine <br />
up by his shoulders inspecting his hide. Blaine's head flopped <br />
backwards at the neck.  He stared upside down at the row of lockers. <br />
They seemed different now.  The lighting was better. The locker room <br />
was cleaner.  Was it even the same locker room he had been in?<br />
<br />
Malcolm spun Blaine around and examined his backside. Blaine stared at <br />
the so-called jocks standing around watching.  They seemed wrong.  <br />
Their posture and expressions didn't match their physiques or <br />
personalities.  He thought about Dwight's odd behavior recently. <br />
Blaine and Malcolm weren't the first jock and nerd pair that he'd <br />
tossed out those fire doors.  It was a set up, he realized.<br />
<br />
&quot;So? Are you going to put Blaine on or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wanted to make sure he transformed properly.  I don't want him <br />
ripping like Sammy did when I tried to put him on,&quot; Malcolm answered.  <br />
He grabbed Blaine's mouth and stretched it wide.  Then he started to <br />
climb inside.<br />
<br />
This was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or that weird Doctor Who <br />
show he had watched with the hot nerd chick who tutored him last year. <br />
Butt ugly green aliens were capturing humans and turning them into <br />
suits.  He never understood how a hot girl like that could be more <br />
into Sci Fi than she was into him and his sports. He wondered whether <br />
Malcolm was really the nerd Malcolm or if there was a fat green blobby <br />
guy wearing his skin. Maybe he was just a nerd who somehow figured out <br />
how to turn jocks into suits.<br />
<br />
As Malcolm's slimy hard cock left a wet trail over his lips, and down <br />
the inside of his chest, Blaine realized where all the nerds had gone. <br />
Over the last two weeks, the number of nerds at the gym had plummeted. <br />
That was one of the reasons he was hassling Malcolm.  All the other <br />
nerds were gone.  Now Blaine realized that all the nerds were still <br />
there.  They were just wearing Dwight and the other jocks' bodies.<br />
<br />
Blaine felt Malcolm's little hard wiener inside his own big flaccid <br />
hollow cock.  Strangely, it was a perfect fit. Blaine felt his <br />
suddenly rock hard cock extend to is full 10 inches.  He felt precum <br />
oozing out of his piss slit, but he knew it wasn't his precum. His <br />
balls weren't churning.  It was Malcolm's precum.  Blaine had been <br />
reduced to being a nerd's jocksuit.  He realized that everyone would <br />
think Malcolm was Blaine.  All his girlfriends would be filled up with <br />
nerd spunk, and Blaine would basically be a condom in the sex act.  He <br />
wondered if he'd still enjoy it.<br />
<br />
His head snapped shut over Malcolm's head.  Blaine saw his reflection <br />
in the mirror opposite him, but it was wrong.  It looked like him, but <br />
the posture was wrong, the expression on the face was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Blaine, you needn't worry about me porking your girlfriends.  I <br />
suppose I might if I had to, but I prefer guys,&quot; Malcolm said with a <br />
snicker, &quot;And oh, yes, I can read your mind.  I know your combo, and <br />
PIN, and I'm going to enjoy that nice illegal cash bonus that the <br />
Alumni gave you for joining our college's team.&quot;<br />
<br />
How could Malcolm know about that? <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, jocks really are as dumb as they seem.  I just told you muscle <br />
brain, Blaine, that I can read your mind.  So it'll make it really <br />
easy for me to pass as you. Understand?  You're just a suit of clothes <br />
for me now - an exosuit with a read only memory.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, its got write memory too,&quot; Dwight proffered, &quot;Just no <br />
physical control.  I got totally wasted and couldn't remember a thing <br />
last Friday, but Dwight jocksuit was stone cold sober, man it was a <br />
good party.  Haha,&quot; laughed Dwight.<br />
<br />
Everyone laughed.<br />
<br />
Malcolm started to pull clothes over Blaine's body. He could feel the <br />
clothes, but he could feel Malcolm inside him.  He wanted to vomit.  <br />
He wanted to vomit Malcolm out, but he couldn't.  This couldn't be <br />
real?  He must've banged his head and be hallucinating right?<br />
<br />
Malcolm whispered with an evil smile on Blaine's lips, &quot;Oh, it's real <br />
all right, it's real.&quot;</p>
