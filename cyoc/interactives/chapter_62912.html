<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sound of your alarm-clock woke me up. I groaned and tried to shut him down with my fumbling hand. Slowly my memory came back. The <br />
strange power, my wish, these strange world I had created. Was it only a strange dream? <br />
While I was trying to free myself from the blanket I felt an unusual weight on my chest. Finally I got out of the bed and walked to my drawer.<br />
Somehow the floor seemed to be nearer then normally. In fact everything seemed to be taller now. When I reached the drawer I opened it and <br />
put a streak of hair out of my view...<br />
Wait a minute! Since when have I long hair? I look down in the drawer, which normally contained my underwear. Now I was greeted with the <br />
sight of panties, strings and bras, but what shocked me most were the two globes on my chest.<br />
Panicly I looked around in my room. The whole room was now pink and girly, completely with a full-lenght mirror in the corner and a table full <br />
with cosmetics. <br />
Suddenly I heard mother calling from downstairs: &quot;Josephine, come down breakfast is ready. Today is your great day!&quot;<br />
Somehow I know that you were &quot;Josephine&quot; now and suddenly I remember the last part of mx wish. I wanted an unexpected twist in my new <br />
form so that it won't be boring, but that wasn't what I wanted.<br />
I looked at myself in the mirror and was stunned by my view. I've got shoulderlenght bright red hair and a soft feminine face with lots of <br />
freckles on my nose and cheeks. I was now barely 4'11'' and have a soft tanned skin. My hips seemed to be very broad and my bottom was <br />
huge and round, so that my whole shape was very curvy. But what irritated me the most were the two fleshy globes of DD-cup breasts on my <br />
14-year old body.<br />
Suddenly I heard the voice of your father, who shouted up to me in a rather angry tone.<br />
&quot;Josephine Miller, come down here immediately.&quot;<br />
Somehow I felt compelled to follow this order directly, so I walked down still in my pajamas.I suddenly remembered some specific parts of my <br />
wish. I wished that I would act as if I was born in this reality, so I would act like every female in this world. And I also wished that all females <br />
were  very docile and submissive towards men, so must now follow every order given to me by a male.<br />
When I came into the kitchen my parents set already at the table along with my three 14-year old brothers. Right, through my wish for only <br />
rare pregnancies with multiple children I have now three brothers in the same age as me. While I sat down at the table I noticed that my dad <br />
was already in his buisness suit in will go to work in a few minutes like normally, but my mom wore something which looked like a very <br />
revealing maid dress, completely with apron and hat. During the breakfast nothing unusual happened and there were just a bit small talk. Then <br />
my dad ordered my mom to clean the table and do the shopping for the evening when some of his co-workers will come over and then he went <br />
to work. While my mom cleaned the kitchen and my brothers got ready for school, I suddenly asked myself why I didn't get myself ready for <br />
school, but then I suddenly that girls only went to school till the age of fourteen, cause they will never work in a job and only need basic <br />
knowledge for homework, housekeeping and of course sexual intercourse. Also in the age of fourteen the government will assign every girl <br />
with male to live together.<br />
I was so struck in my thoughts that I didn't hear when on of my brothers, I instantly knew his name was Collin, stood next to me.<br />
&quot;Hey sis, how about a last orgy before school. You won't be back for some time after today.&quot;<br />
Before I can answer or ask what he meant, or even show disgust about the thought of having sex as a girl with my own brothers, I just followed <br />
his commands and lowered myself on all fours while Collin lied under me and put his dick in my vagina, which I assumed wasn't virgin since a <br />
long time, considering the nature of this world. But not enough that I had sex with Collin, also my other brother, Lucas was pounding my ass, <br />
while the third, Sam, was forcing me to give him a blowjob. While I was on all four on the kitchen floor with my brothers having an orgy with <br />
me, all my mother did was washing the dishes and saying: &quot;Oh, how nice of you, boys. Giving your sister a last present.&quot;<br />
Again I was wondering what they were talking about, but I didn't really want to know it. I just wanted to wish myself back to my old reality, but  <br />
I couldn't say anything cause of Sam's dick in mouth and suddenly I heard Collin's voice in my ear: &quot;That's right bitch. Be fucked like the <br />
animal, like the bitch, you are. And I know you like it. You will never wish it to be any other way than this. You might be ashamed, but you <br />
can't escape.&quot; With these few simple words, spoken in a moment of sexual domination my own brother doomed me. I felt compelled to follow <br />
is orders cause he was male and even after they went to school, I couldn't wish myself back to a boy or in my old reality.<br />
After the kitchen was cleaned up and was dressed, me and my mother sat down in the den. I wore I a very short denim skirt and a tube top <br />
with bare midriff as well as a g-string and a shoulderless bra under it. I was ashamed of my choice of clothes, but first was my whole wardrobe <br />
very revealing and provocative, and second I felt compelled to dress this way, probably cause my description of these world. My mom wore still <br />
her maid uniform and showed my a letter.<br />
&quot;This letter came this morning.&quot;, explained my mom proudly. &quot;This is the result of your husband assignment.&quot;<br />
Now I know what this talk was all about, my mind fed me with knew informations. A few weeks ago my mom took me to the governmental <br />
facility were a doctor took my measurements and hormone results and now they sent me the outcome and the name of the boy which I will be <br />
&quot;married to&quot;. Right after that I will live in his household, which means I will first live with his family and then in his own house when he will <br />
move out. My mom gave me the letter and I opened it. Actually don't want to know what is in this letter and who will be my husband. I am still <br />
shocked about the outcome of the last hour. My life was now completely top-down and I was trapped in this perverted word, in this unusual <br />
body with this strange habits and all of this happened cause I couldn't control my sexual urges in combination with unlimited power. Somehow <br />
I should have known better than that. Slowly I put out the assignment and began to read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Miss Josephine Miller,<br />
<br />
We are proud to state that your results where optimal for human reproduction.&quot;<br />
A list of values followed, which I didn't understood completely, but I saw that my estrogen level was very high and there was a very high chance <br />
that I will lactate constantly after the age of sixteen.<br />
&quot;Considering your values we found the perfect counterpart for you as a mate with a difference of 0,0037 percent.<br />
Your new mate is Ethan Hendrickson   56 Northfolk Street.<br />
You are ordered to move to his address till 9 o'clock p.m.<br />
He is notified and awaits you there.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Howard McKillian&quot;<br />
<br />
I was still shocked about this outcome, but my mom was unnervingly happy. She only talked about the moving, my results, and what disturbed <br />
me the most, that with this results perhaps I became pregnant sometimes like herself. I sat on the coach still shocked, while my mom packed <br />
my property into boxes for the moving.</p>
