<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, you see, my nightgown is in the laundry for the night and I accidentally ripped my other nightgown, so I'm kinda in need for a new one. I was actually gonna buy one when you called me but... I can wait until tomorrow,&quot; Jade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be your nightgown for the night?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah. Unless you don't want that. I mean, it's your body after all... or at least, it is for now... Gawd, I still can't believe this might actually be real,&quot; Jade says.<br />
<br />
You giggle. &quot;Oh no, I like the idea of being a nightgown. It's just, out of all the things you could own, you ask for a nightgown?&quot; you started laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hush you!&quot; Jade said, joining in on your laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well alright, let's uh... go do this then,&quot; you sid after which you stepped outside the catalog room to find Ashley again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, have you finally made up your mind?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! My friend Jade here will be sleeping comfortably tonight,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see! Well have fun then, you two,&quot; she said after which she proceeded to help out a new customer who just entered the store while you and Jade go to the 'transformation' room. Inside, they were immediately greeted by another girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! Welcome to the TFs-R-US transformation area! My name is Cynthia. Which one of you will be transformed?&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhm, I will,&quot; you said, a little startled by the energy this girl had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent! I take it you will be taking her with you then once it's over,&quot; she said, pointing at Jade who could only nod in return. &quot;Alright! So what will you be transforming into?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I want to become her nightgown for the night... and become normal again tomorrow by uh... 10 AM,&quot; you reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course! That can be arranged. Let's see. An article of clothing for one night only will be 10$ please,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That cheap?&quot; you and Jade both asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's only for one night, so yes, it's not that expensive,&quot; Cynthia replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if it's that cheap for only one night, and it's a great experience... why don't we come back here more often?&quot; Jade proposed.<br />
<br />
&quot;It... does sound very appealing... but let's first get this started,&quot; you said, thinking of all the possibilities and the nearing transformation into a nightgown. You then payed for the transformation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, simply go through that door and tell the man what you want to become and he'll take care of it,&quot; cynthia said and pointed towards a door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jade said after which she nearly pushed you towards the door. She then whispered &quot;that girl's giving me the creeps!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! New clients! Welcome! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Pierre and I will be the one to transform you!&quot; the man said which they you encountered in the next room. You had called up your parents beforehand to tell them of the 'sleep-over' and they thankfully agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it still time to return to Cynthia?&quot; Jade whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, what will these two lovely young ladies be transforming themselves into?&quot; Pierre asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh... only I will be transforming... into a nightgown for my friend here,&quot; you explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, but that is just wonderful!&quot; Pierre exclaimed after which he proceeded to type away something on a computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is he faking a French accent?&quot; Jade asked you. One thing you both agreed on was that this place could seriously use a change of employees, but then again, what did you expect from a company that transforms people. It was bound to attract some wierdos.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, for how long will you be transformed, miss uh...&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Megan... For one day only. Untill 10 AM tomorrow morning,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, excellent! And did you have anything special in mind on what Megan will look like, miss uh..&quot; he asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jade... well, I thought... I wanna have something uh...&quot; Jade then did something unexpected. She walked up to Pierre and started whispering into his ear, to which Pierre only laughed in delight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fantastique! Miss Megan will look fabulous on you, miss Jade! Alright, Miss Megan, if you'd please step into that little room over there? You will need to strip out of your clothes for this of course, but do not worry. I will not look,&quot; Pierre said and then turned around.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-Strip?&quot; you asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why of course! You do not want your clothes to disappear in the process do you?&quot; Pierre replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... o-okay...&quot; you said. You just shrugged to Jade, who in turn, shrugged back and then proceeded to strip your clothes untill you were completely naked. You've never been naked in front of others before. You've been in your underwear in front of Jade before during dress-ups, sure, but this was new. Then again, it didn't feel all that wierd to be naked in front of your best friend. There was nothing to hide, right? You gave your clothes to Jade who was, in fact, very calm about seeing you naked. Nothing new she saw, right? You then stepped into the chamber and waved one last time to Jade while you still could before going completely inaminate for the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow! Or... I'll see your body tomorrow again,&quot; Jade said.<br />
<br />
&quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; you reply and then you close the door behind you. You look behind you to see Jade and Pierre talk to one-another, but you could not hear what they were saying. All you knew was that you only had a few moments of free movement left! You take a last look at your body, knowing that it'd soon be nothing but silk.<br />
<br />
Then it hit you. A wave of pleasure washed over you as you feel your body starting to tingle. At first it was just a small tingle but it quickly spread and intensified across your body. you look at your legs as you notice they get shorter, as if they are being pulled back into your body. Yet with every inch they withdrew, you only felt better and better. At last, ever your feet withdrew into your body, leaving your completely legless, yet filled with pleasure. You did not fall over though as the machine kept you floating. Next, you noticed your arms withrew into your body as well, making you completely limbless. Your lower body extended a little and for the first time, you see that your body is actually turning into silk. You notice how the bottom of your body is reforming into a skirt-like piece of clothing. It became all frilly and, to be honest, pretty short too, making it so its wearer wouldn't leave a lot to the imagination. Next, the silk spread higher, turning her entire lower body into purple silk. It passed her belly button and was now transforming her breasts into silk. You could feel your body litteraly becoming hollow while your pleasure only intensified. That's when you noticed that you stopped breathing. At first you became scared, but then you realized that your lungs had just disappeared too, so there was no real reason to breath anymore. objects don't breath. Why would they need to?<br />
<br />
Finally, the transformation reached your head, and you could feel your head retract. First, she felt her mouth disappearing, followed by her nose and then her eyes, leaving her completely in the dark. Yet she could still feel everything. She could feel the rest of her head transforming into silk and she could feel exactly what she looked like: a short, purple, frilly nightgown that Jade was going to wear for the rest of the night. You then fell down to the floor as the machine came to a halt, but you felt no pain. You were just a piece of clothing. objects don't feel pain. The realization of what had just happened washed over you. You had liberately given up on your body for one night to become nothing but a nightgown. Yet you felt no regret. If anything, this felt amazing! You could not move at all, yet this only strengthened your pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Et Voil&agrave;! Your nightgown is ready, miss Jade!&quot; Pierre said, opening up the door again. Once inside, Jade found nothing but a nightgown. She could not believe it. Her best friend Megan had actually turned into a piece of clothing!<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this... really Megan?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is! Now, I hope that you will enjoy your friend as much as I loved making her this way and I hope to see you soon. I'd say, you would make a lovely pair of socks!&quot; Pierre said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I'll think about it,&quot; Jade said and then proceeded to pick you up, making you feel very good about her touch. Her touch on you felt so amazing that you couldn't wait to be worn by her. You felt yourself getting stuffed into her bag together with your own former clothing and you felt the bag then getting picked up and leave the room. At one point, you were taken out again, probably so Ashley could see you, but then you got shoved in the bag again. Though you couldn't see or hear anything during all this, and your only world consisted of Jade's bag at the moment, you felt content. You were just an article of clothing and you were being treated as one. Just a nightgown in a teenage girl's bag.</p>
