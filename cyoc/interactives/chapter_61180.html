<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk back up to Bandhavgarh Cabin was a fairly quiet one. Part of me wondered if I had done the smart thing, as neither Molly nor I knew how to handle or raise cattle. We might be able to keep them alive long enough to hunt them, but that isn't how ranchers kept their cattle. They raised them to breed and produce more cattle to raise and sell off at the highest bid to the slaughter-houses. This allowed them to buy replacement cattle when they couldn't get enough cattle through breeding... or all of the female cattle in the herd were related to the bull in the herd.<br />
<br />
I knew that the only way the decision would work was if Frank Rhoer and his family agreed to run the operation. They could handle the day to day operation, and I was quite willing to let them have any and all profits from the sale of individual animals. It would give them some hope for a future, since it was unlikely that they would be able get any of Beauregard's land and animals.<br />
<br />
And what would happen to Beauregard's ranch was uncertain. None of the charges that Beauregard was likely facing had anything to do with the treatment of his animals, and the city couldn't just seize his property and animals that easily. The only way that could be done was if the tests on the traps Beauregard had were able to prove that the wolves were trapped outside of the hunting season that had been set for wolves, and that was likely the local game warden's job. Not the Columbia Falls PD's.<br />
<br />
If the city didn't seize the property it would likely go to whoever Beauregard had named his heir, and he wouldn't accept the Rhoers as workers, when they learned exactly the circumstances that lead to Beauregard losing his land.<br />
<br />
However, the speed at which I walked back up toward the cabin was long enough for Albert and his son to get their trailer to wherever Michael York could hold them for awhile. As I made it up to the front door, I heard the sound of wheels on the dirt road coming up toward the cabin. Albert and Joshua Ames got out of the truck as it came to a stop. The trailer was still attached to the truck's hitch.<br />
<br />
&quot;A nice looking place you have here,&quot; Albert commented as he looked up at the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; I answered, &quot;I only just arrived a moment or two ago. I'll still need to go in so that I can pay you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Albert Ames nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to use the garage for?&quot; Joshua wondered as he looked at the posts that had been put in for the garage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ultimately as my own private slaughter house, so Molly and I can properly process the deer we catch during the hunting season,&quot; I answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a shop downtown that does it,&quot; Albert commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run by a R.A.M. member,&quot; I answered, &quot;Molly and I found out that they have strict no live animals policy... and no animal lovers policy... so we make do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Albert grumbled, &quot;he didn't turn the whole town against you did he?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone from the butcher to the school district superintendent,&quot; I answered and went in.<br />
<br />
The checkbook was easily retrieved and I made out the payment to Albert Ames. Once that was done, I returned down to Albert and Joshua Ames as they strolled about the driveway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go, sir,&quot; I said to Albert as I handed him the check when I returned to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you thought about what your brand would look like?&quot; Albert then asked, &quot;we can help you by getting it forged, if you can come up with a design.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hadn't thought about it, really,&quot; I sighed, &quot;that may actually take me awhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Try to be quick,&quot; Albert advised, &quot;it will take time to make the branding iron and it won't be good to leave the cattle in the little area they're enclosed in for long.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then handed me a small scrap of paper, with his address on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can find me there,&quot; Albert finished, &quot;or somewhere on the property.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; I nodded, &quot;I'll try to come up with something.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I finished many of the small tasks I had started before Michael York had called in the rest of the morning and early afternoon. When that was done, it was getting close to the end of Molly's work day and I made my way into town. As I did I tried to think of away to explain the bought gift of the cattle to Molly. I wasn't all that confident with what I had come up with, but I figured I didn't have much choice but to go ahead with it.<br />
<br />
I arrived at the school just as the final bell rang. I stood quietly as the kids came out to greet their waiting parents. A few took pleasure in tugging at my tail as it slowly swished behind me. This lead to a series of amused chuckles coming from from around the door. I then looked up to see Molly standing there trying to stifle her chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose you find this to be funny?&quot; I asked her in a teasing voice as she finally began to approach me and the children let go to go to their parents.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, maybe a little,&quot; Molly smirked, &quot;it is interesting that they use someone other then me as a furry jungle gym.&quot;<br />
<br />
We stood their quietly for a moment before Molly snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you looked positively hilarious with the &quot;trying to enjoy it&quot; face you had on,&quot; Molly snickered again, &quot;what are you going to do when we have cubs? Our tails are going to be their prime playthings. You know that... don't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's different,&quot; I answered her, which only made her chuckle more.<br />
<br />
We then made our way along the sidewalk in front of the school. The goal of our journey was Frank Rhoer's home, in the hopes to settle the differences that were between us. As we did so, I decided to try and work in how the day had gone for me, so far.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was your day?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went well,&quot; Molly sighed, &quot;at least as well as it could. The principal made a point of coming into the room before the children came in to inform Mrs. Fitzpatrick and myself that the report requirements were still in place, despite Beauregard's arrest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; I grumbled, &quot;his dogs still bark, even though the master is no longer in control... but as more details come out, their tune will change... and if not, Beauregard was not without his own enemies here. Some of them have their own games to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know that Michael York resents Beauregard, and in that sentence, the word &quot;resent&quot; is being rather polite,&quot; I told her, &quot;right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. York was not the only Columbia Falls rancher that Beauregard had angered,&quot; I answered, &quot;as I learned today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's gone on? No one attacked you, did they?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no attack,&quot; I replied, &quot;a gift, actually.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A gift?&quot; Molly looked at me puzzled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember that the city took possession of the Smith's land and animals after they were found guilty? I told you about that, right?&quot; I asked and waited for Molly nodded, &quot;well, the winner of that auction had the &quot;great&quot; idea to give the cattle he had won at the auction to you and I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Molly's voice nearly reached a full roar in surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;He gave the cattle to you and I,&quot; I repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, we know nothing of ranching,&quot; Molly said, &quot;we've never lived with it, never grew up with it... and the only thing our instincts can tell us about cattle is to tackle them and hold them by the throat in our jaws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; I said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you accepted the idea?&quot; Molly gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;They wouldn't take no for an answer,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and at about this time, I got the idea of letting your Uncle take care of them...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uncle Frank?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I sighed, &quot;Beauregard is looking at life imprisonment for assaulting an officer with a deadly weapon, and conspiracy to organize murder, and likely connected with the crimes that gang committed in Peoria before turning themselves into Pit Bulls. Either the city or Beauregard's heir will take over his ranch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe Uncle Frank will buy part of the ranch then,&quot; Molly guessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;He told us he didn't have the money for that,&quot; I reminded her, &quot;and he told me at the scene that he only stayed with Beauregard because he was the only one who would hire him. He can't afford to buy the ranch from the city at auction, and Beauregard's heir likely won't keep him on the payroll. Your Uncle and cousins are looking at unemployment because of Beauregard's crimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly gave me a look that made me nervous. It screamed, &quot;you're in trouble, George Wayne&quot; and the last thing I wanted was to be in trouble with my wife.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thought that since we are trying to apologize for the bad blood that's been between us and your Uncle when R.A.M. was first formed, we might give him an offer that wouldn't make him suffer for Beauregard's mistakes... and besides, I owe him for saving my life,&quot; I continued to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what was this deal you had thought of, George?&quot; Molly questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;We let your Uncle and Cousins raise cattle, and even let them keep whatever funds the operation earns, since you and I will do well on my salary and your wages,&quot; I said weakly, &quot;that way your Uncle can do what he knows and we don't have to worry about our lack of ranching knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Molly commented, &quot;and do you think Uncle Frank will agree to it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I admitted, &quot;I got caught in it and couldn't get out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That much is obvious,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;but if it works... I suppose you have a point.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
We found Frank, Nessie, and Meredeth Rhoer loading boxes into the back of his truck. Frank slowly paused in his work when he saw us coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, George, Molly,&quot; he said calmly, &quot;what brings you to my door this afternoon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully to set things right, Uncle,&quot; Molly said, &quot;George told me you saved him from being shot by Beauregard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Frank Rhoer nodded, &quot;how did your partner make out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He was alive,&quot; I answered, &quot;he spent a lot of time in surgery, but the doctors in Kalispell were able to put him back together again... as it were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer nodded, &quot;I'm sorry for all Mr. Beauregard has put you through... I never thought he would take things as far as he did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That should all be behind us, now, Uncle,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;and let bygones be bygones.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pardon...?&quot; Frank Rhoer wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We want to say we're sorry for the way things ended between us,&quot; I spoke, &quot;Molly's safety and happiness has always been my main concern... and well, I suppose I over reacted to Beauregard's threats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were probably right though...&quot; Frank Rhoer sighed, &quot;Mr. Beauregard was the only one who would hire me... and he even took on Meredeth and Nessie as they grew up, and I let myself get pulled in. It doesn't excuse the way he treated the two of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no it doesn't,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;but did you agree with him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;No... Molly, you are the only real family outside of Meredeth and Nessie that I have. I never had all that much contact from your parents... particularly when I settled out here with your Aunt Raining Cloud, God rest her soul. The few times I got to be with you growing up made me very happy... and I was also pleased to hear that you would be moving out here, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No &quot;buts&quot; about then,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;we both made mistakes. We are family. Let's start over as family. Put all the mess Beauregard caused behind us and start over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could,&quot; Frank answered, &quot;but the city has taken Beauregard's land and will hold onto it until the end of his trial. His ranch is presently a crime scene, and with Mr. Beauregard likely going to prison, your Cousins and I have no job, and because no one else would hire us, we must move on...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Molly gasped, &quot;but you own your house...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Without the work, I can't afford the mortgage, nor the taxes I pay on the land,&quot; Frank Rhoer sighed, &quot;I've already called your parents in Peoria, Molly. They're willing to let us stay until I can find work...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'd go all the way to Illinois?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't drift like I used to, Molly, dear,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied, &quot;Meredeth and Nessie are grown... and could live on their own, and they're free to go where they may. But I can't, and I don't have the money to move into some other town and start looking. I'll go to Peoria until I can find a good job I can do... maybe there's a farmer down there looking for a hired hand...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When are you planning to leave?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;As soon as we load everything, I intend to go down to the bank to sign the house over to the bank,&quot; Frank Rhoer said, &quot;and then it's on the road again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll probably be stayin' around here for awhile, anyway,&quot; Meredeth said as she came to take her father's hand, &quot;it'll be hard, but I'm sure Nessie and I can find work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you haven't done anything formal to sign over the house and the land it's on?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; Frank Rhoer answered, &quot;that won't happen until I make my way out of town.&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced to Molly, who looked nervous beside me.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I could offer you a way to remain here?&quot; I offered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not familiar with police-work,&quot; Frank Rhoer replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, in ranching,&quot; I answered, &quot;as I'm sure you know Ebenezer Smith's property was seized when he fabricated the charge that I killed one of his cattle.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank Rhoer nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The city has recently held the auction for the property and the animals,&quot; I continued, &quot;and the man who won the cattle at the auction has essentially given them to Molly and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But George and I know nothing about running a ranch,&quot; Molly cut in, &quot;George had the idea that you could take care of the animals given to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me...&quot; Frank Rhoer gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't pay you the way Beauregard did, but Molly and I are doing fine with my salary and her wage as a teacher's aide,&quot; I answered, &quot;you would be more then welcome to take the profits from the sale of the animals that are sold at the time you sell them. It'd give you something to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Uncle Frank,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;so we can start over...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Frank Rhoer said slowly, &quot;I'll need to see where they're being kept, and then we can go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was unable to do anymore as Molly then pulled him into a hug. I meanwhile found myself being eyed by Nessie and Meredeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you certainly filled out,&quot; Meredeth quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;I trust you make Molly happy... you know... in bed?&quot; Nessie teased a bit too.<br />
<br />
&quot;I try to,&quot; I said nervously.<br />
<br />
The two sisters came a little closer when they were stopped by an icy glare from Molly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is MINE!&quot; Molly gave a low growl.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're just jokin' with him!&quot; Meredeth said quickly, &quot;you can have him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Molly replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does he have a brother?&quot; Meredeth decided to add Molly into their game.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm an only child,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuts,&quot; Meredeth sighed.<br />
<br />
I then turned to find Nessie standing beside me.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is good that your partner will be okay,&quot; She told me.<br />
<br />
&quot;He probably owes a lot to you helping him,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;As my father said, we played no role in what Mr. Beauregard did, and we had no idea that he would go as far as he did,&quot; Nessie answered.</p>
