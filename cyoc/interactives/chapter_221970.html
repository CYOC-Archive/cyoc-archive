<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The TF relates more to the developments that would relate to pregnancy.<br/>
<br/>
The adult content warning is more for the mention of certain things that would be explicit, but not actually happening in the chapter...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucy&#39;s emotions ran high and in many different directions as she drifted off to sleep. She&#39;d had boyfriends before, and going into her Senior year in college, it wasn&#39;t as though she still had her virginity. However, most of her relationships had often proved to be short term. Either the boy moved away, and they agreed to part because of that distance and that things hadn&#39;t really progressed to a point where a long-distance relationship could be tried or there was some other issue. The biggest of these issues was often that Lucy found out the boy she was dating was only interested in her D cup chest and wanted to get in her pants and nothing more, which then irritated Lucy and she broke the relationship off. <br />
<br />
But Melody just felt different, and it wasn&#39;t just because Melody had been a Slug Woman all her life and Lucy had become one recently. The physical attraction Lucy had felt might have started with her transformation into a Slug Woman, but Lucy was never one to truly strike up a relationship based purely on physical desire. She&#39;d never done that as a human and her opinion on &quot;being herself&quot; kept things pretty firm against some of the base instincts that were now there in the back of her mind as a Slug Woman, and this included some thoughts that Megan and Jenny weren&#39;t hard on the eyes, either. And while it was likely that Edward Cupple had enslaved both of them, and thus their actions at the Chapman home weren&#39;t their own, that didn&#39;t change her opinion on the actions taken, which in turn kept Lucy fairly firmly at wanting anything to do with them in anything close to a &quot;sexual&quot; way. Lucy&#39;s mind was certain on keeping things &quot;platonic&quot; with those two Slug Women once they could be freed from whatever mind control that Cupple was using.<br />
<br />
But Melody was still different, namely because Lucy had seemed to be more emotionally drawn to Melody. It wasn&#39;t just physical looks. It was that Melody was smart and provided the sort of explanation that assured Lucy more and more that even as a Slug Woman, Lucy would remain Lucy. It put Lucy&#39;s mind at ease and assured her that Melody wasn&#39;t just acting out of lust. And it had been some of the recent conversations where Lucy learned that Melody might have acted out of love and interest in a way that was quite touching, buying a painting that Lucy had painted in college, and allowed the college to sell as part of its programs, and wanting to meet and thank Lucy for some of Lucy&#39;s other efforts. It was something that brought out real love and made the sex that the two Slug Women had before falling asleep possible. It made Lucy happy...<br />
<br />
However, happiness was an emotion and while the blooming love was beautiful, Lucy wasn&#39;t fully prepared for it. For she and the rest of the Chapman women had missed out on taking their birth control pills as a result of all the antics that had gone around regarding Megan and Jenny&#39;s visit and then the Chapman family becoming Slug People, one after the other. It left both open to biology and something that between what Lucy remembered from school in discussions on Slug People and what Melody and her father had shared about the origins of Slug People, was something that if Lucy was still conscious she&#39;d be nervous over. For Slug People were developed by wizards to be able to breed prolifically to provide wizards with natural familiars that could help the wizard they were partnered with in a very real way. And in this, by having unprotected sex with Melody and where both Lucy and Melody filled the other with their seed, they were essentially doing what Slug People were originally designed to do, breed.<br />
<br />
For all Slug Women were highly fertile when it came to what their eggs would be fertilized by. There were reports that a Slug Woman could be impregnated by a human, even if the Slug Woman never used the ability to transform that human, and sex with a Slug Man would almost guarantee a pregnancy, which hinted that a Slug Woman could be stimulated to ovulate through sex and the fact that Slug People were mostly female, and Slug Women were hermaphrodites allowing for a potentially high population growth rate. The only limiting factor here was that a Slug Woman&#39;s sperm were not as virile as a Slug Man&#39;s sperm. Slug Women could breed together, but that wasn&#39;t a complete given, and that things like condoms and birth control pills were actually found to work as a means of birth control among Slug People as technology advanced and the things that may have killed them in prior centuries became less and less of an issue. And had Lucy not been as caught up in the blooming feelings of love, she would have made some effort to assure that she and Melody had taken some birth control before the two of them slipped their penises into the vagina of the other.<br />
<br />
Now, as Lucy and Melody dreamed, they could only hope that their first act of love wouldn&#39;t raise the risks and dangers that Lucy knew that she and her family faced because of the actions of one evil wizard. But neither Lucy, nor Melody, had any control over biology and how their bodies would respond to their blooming love, and there as the hours of night progressed, it would soon become apparent that the lack a birth control pill being taken was a problem. It wasn&#39;t immediate or rapid, and Lucy smiled and dreamed of a happy future with Melody and even having a family. Ironically, that family was already forming as the hours of night passed. First Lucy and then Melody&#39;s midsections began to push forward underneath the cocoon of slime the two Slug Women had wrapped themselves in when they mated.<br />
<br />
And the swelling of their wombs wasn&#39;t flab. It remained firm and taught as they pushed forward. Eventually, Lucy&#39;s swelling womb had swelled up to a point where it was pushing against Melody&#39;s. It forced Melody to roll a bit in her sleep so that her womb was angled upward and that it would rest on top of Lucy&#39;s and let their slowly growing gravid bellies sell with the passage of time and without truly pushing either Slug Woman away from each other. It let Melody wrap her arms around Lucy in her sleep and only aroused a small and happy sounding chirp from Lucy as she snuggled Melody back and as the precious cargo of the next generation of Chapmans... the egg or eggs that were growing within Lucy and Melody... were forming. But with both of them asleep... they didn&#39;t know that this was happening.</p>
