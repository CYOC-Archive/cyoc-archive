<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff decided it was time to focus on another part of his body: his ass.  Jeff worked out here and there, so his body was lean and toned.  However, he had a totally flat ass.  <br />
<br />
Jeff lived in a town full of hockey players.  All of them had  big, round hockey butts filling out their pants.  Jeff was very jealous of these guys.  Every pair of pants he owned, even the slim fits, sagged in the back.  No matter how much he worked out, he was never able to get his ass to look anything like those hockey players.  If he could swap his flat ass with a nice, round bubble butt he would be much more satisfied with his appearance.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t need to think for long about who he wanted to swap with.  Luke was the captain of the high school hockey team and had the juiciest ass in the town.  No matter how baggy Luke&#39;s pants were, his ass was always straining the stitching.  When Luke walked or ran, his ass bounced around like the tits on a lifeguard from Baywatch.  It was hypnotic and Jeff wanted it for himself...badly.<br />
<br />
Jeff furiously typed the info into the Chronivac.  After a few moments of searching, an image of Luke appeared on the screen with a list of info and stats next to it.  The image on the screen was incredibly life-like, as if Luke was standing completely still in front of a high res webcam.  Jeff found that he could rotate the image, turning Luke around so that he could ogle Luke&#39;s gorgeous ass.<br />
<br />
Luke&#39;s avatar was wearing very dark yoga pants which, combined with the fact that Luke was standing perfectly still, was preventing Jeff from seeing anything in great detail.<br />
Jeff saw a &quot;clothing&quot; option next to the image of Luke, which currently had a small check mark next to it.  Jeff clicked the check mark once and it vanished, along with all of Luke&#39;s clothes.  It happened instantaneously, no loading time at all.<br />
<br />
Luke was now completely nude from head to toe, his proud rear end on full display.  Jeff leaned in close to the computer monitor, scrutinizing Luke&#39;s ass intensely.  As far as Jeff could tell, it was completely perfect.  It was blemish free with a slight dusting of light blond hair, the same colour as the hair on Luke&#39;s head.  Jeff&#39;s mouth started to water as he fantasized about grabbing a fistful of those fleshy globes.<br />
<br />
Jeff rotated Luke&#39;s avatar so that it was standing in profile: that glorious rear end was pointing to the right while his front was facing left.  Jeff was astounded at the shelf like bubble butt jutting out from Luke&#39;s back.  Luke could seriously balance a glass on his ass, it was pushed out so far from his body.<br />
<br />
Jeff also quickly had a peak at Luke&#39;s dick.  It was fairly average, probably 3 inches soft and he assumed around 6 hard.  A quick scan of the stats in the Chronivac verified that.  It was uncut, which was something Jeff hadn&#39;t considered before.  He, Jacob and Matthew were all cut so he hadn&#39;t really thought of getting an uncut cock before.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s cock (well, it was actually Matthew&#39;s cock) was now straining against his boxers.  Enough was enough.  Jeff needed that ass and he needed it now.<br />
<br />
With a few keystrokes, Jeff had everything ready for the swap.  Soon Jeff would have a crazy bubble butt and Luke would have Jeff&#39;s flat ass.  Before Jeff hit enter, he noticed a &quot;preview&quot; option next to Luke&#39;s image.  Intrigued, Jeff pressed the preview button.  Jeff saw Luke&#39;s avatar shimmer for a moment before it&#39;s ass started deflating like a balloon.  It only took a second, but Luke&#39;s ass was now totally flat.  In fact, it was practically concave.  The rest of Luke&#39;s beefy hockey bod was unchanged, except for the ass which looked comically out of place on him.<br />
<br />
Jeff then noticed a tab above the image of Luke with his own name on it.  He clicked on the tab and the image of Luke was replaced with an Avatar of Jeff&#39;s own body.  The image was also nude and facing completely forward.  Jeff rotated the image to the side and gasped in amazement.  Jeff&#39;s ass had blown out to a ridiculous proportion.  The image was completely ludacris.  It looked like a bad photoshopped version where someone just clicked and stretched his ass five inches out from his body.  It was even more ridiculous with his twiggy legs sticking out from that fat ass, which made them look even skinnier.<br />
<br />
Repulsed by the thought of looking like some sort of plastic surgery reject, Jeff returned to the image of Luke and made a quick adjustment.  He changed the swap parameters from just Luke&#39;s ass to Luke&#39;s entire bottom half.  Everything from the crotch down, front and back, would be swapped.<br />
<br />
Jeff hit the preview button and watched with glee as Luke&#39;s entire lower half quickly dwindled away.  Luke&#39;s avatar now had a large, beefy chest and arms sitting atop thin, toned bottom.  The image moved suddenly, spreading its legs apart so as to keep from falling over.  Luke&#39;s avatar looked uncomfortable somehow, like he was straining with his skinny legs to keep from toppling over.<br />
<br />
Jeff switched over to his own profile and saw his lower half filling out.  His thighs and calves rapidly thickened to match the bulbous globes he had already swapped earlier.  He was also rather pleased to see his avatars cock stretch out a few inches and watched as the foreskin stretched to cover his cock head completely.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn&#39;t wait any longer.  He switched back to Luke and clicked &quot;swap&quot;.<br />
<br />
Jeff immediately felt his lower half rapidly expanding outwards.  Pleasure turned to pain almost instantly as Jeff&#39;s underwear was stretched beyond capacity.  Jeff cursed his stupidly as he stood up and clawed at the taught material cutting off the blood supply to his crotch.  The material was stretched so tight that it was impossible to get a hold of.  <br />
<br />
Desperate for relief Jeff did the only thing he could think to do: he flexed his legs and ass as hard as he could and squatted down as low as he could go.  A loud tearing sound echoed throughout the room, mixed with Jeff&#39;s sigh of relief.  Jeff felt the cool air hit his ass cheeks as he assumed the material of his boxers had split right up the middle.  Jeff stood up and looked down to see his underwear hanging from his waist in tatters.  Not only had the material split into shreds but the elastic had also snapped.  <br />
<br />
Jeff reached down and tore the shreds of his underwear from his body and dropped them to the floor.  He grabbed his cock, which had gotten hard during the swap, and pulled back his new foreskin as far as it could go.  Jeff was amazed at the sensitivity of his cock.  It was much more sensitive than his own cut cock.  Jeff rubbed a finger along the swollen glans, the sensation quickly overwhelming him.  He gave his cock a few pumps but had to stop as he could feel himself quickly coming close to shooting his load.  <br />
<br />
Jeff let his cock go and it slapped loudly against his abs.  He twisted his head back, straining to check out his new hockey ass.  It wasn&#39;t difficult to see, it stuck out so far from his backside.  He reached back with both hands and grabbed each of his butt cheeks.  Jeff moaned in pleasure from the sensations he was feeling.  Luke&#39;s ass was surprisingly sensitive.  As he massaged his new ass he felt tiny ripples of pleasure radiating throughout his body.  Jeff was already close to cumming, and this was pushing him even  closer.<br />
<br />
Jeff rushed to his closet and opened the door so he could check out his new appendages in the full length mirror.  Standing directly in front of the mirror, Jeff could see how wide his lower half was compared to the rest of his body.  His thighs and calves were huge.  In fact, it almost looked like each thigh was as thick as his waist!<br />
<br />
Jeff was standing as he normally did with his legs pressed tightly together.  He hadn&#39;t realized how uncomfortable that was until he saw how awkward it looked in the mirror.  He shifted his feet away from each other, widening his stance until he felt more comfortable.  Jeff thought he looked incredibly sexy.  He seemed more confident somehow with his wide  stance.<br />
<br />
Jeff took a deep breath and turned to the side.  His ass looked even bigger than it did on Luke, with his thin waist sitting above it.  Jeff caressed his behind again, watching his reflection intensely.  Jeff gave his ass a light slap, his cock twitching as he saw the flesh of his hockey butt ripple.<br />
<br />
Jeff massaged his ass with one hand, reaching down to jerk his uncut cock with the other.  Jeff was getting close to cumming, but he tried to hold it back as best he could.  His fingers slowly moved towards his hole, the anticipation pushing him closer and closer to orgasm.<br />
<br />
Jeff took the plunge and reached between his plump cheeks hoping to probe his new boypussy.  Instead of hitting soft, supple flesh Jeff instead felt something hard and flat.<br />
<br />
Jeff was stunned.   Something was in his ass!  Cold terror gripped Jeff&#39;s chest as he wondered if something had gone wrong with the swap.  What if he had selected some crazy option that he could never reverse?<br />
<br />
Jeff turned his back to the mirror and leaned forward, his gaze locked on his ass crack.  He used both hands to spread his cheeks to see what he had lodged in his hole.  Jeff saw a flat, black disc stuck to his hole.  Jeff reached out and ran a finger across the disc.  His eyes widened as he recognized the feeling of rubber and finally realized what was happening.  He had a butt plug jammed in his ass.<br />
<br />
Jeff had never once put anything besides his fingers in his ass in his entire life.  He had always wondered what it would feel like, going so far as to visit a sex shop and hold a few different models of butt plugs in his hands.  He had always chickened out, though.  Now he had one already jammed in there.  How could this have happened?<br />
<br />
The realization hit him like a ton of bricks.  Luke must have had the butt plug there when he swapped!<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned loudly with the idea of the hockey team captain shoving a butt plug up just tight, bubble butt.  He instinctively flexed his boypussy and watched as his hole tightened around the edge of the plug.  Jeff closed his eyes and focused on the feelings emanating from his ass.  He flexed and unflexed his hole and, with each flex, he could feel the fullness of the plug in his ass.<br />
<br />
The sensations from his ass suddenly became too much.  Jeff moaned loudly as he felt the oncoming orgasm wash over his body.  Shot after shot of cum launched out of his dick, spraying all over the floor.  With each spurt Jeff&#39;s hole clenched around the butt plug, causing the most intense erotic feelings he had ever experienced in his life to rattle his brain.  Jeff&#39;s moans turned to loud yells, each flex of his boypussy causing him to get louder and louder.<br />
<br />
After a full minute, and more than a dozen shots of cum spraying out of his ass, Jeff collapsed onto the floor.  His face was resting in a puddle of cum and his ass was sticking straight up in the air.  Jeff was panting with exertion.  He could taste Luke&#39;s cum in his mouth; it was sweet and salty.<br />
<br />
This was the best thing that had ever happened to Jeff.  He was exhausted from the exertion of his incredible orgasm.  He couldn&#39;t wait to have more fun with his new ass.</p>
