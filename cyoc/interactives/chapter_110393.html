<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your &quot;camp&quot; wasn&#39;t much. You cleared a patch of forest floor against a steep embankment, protecting you on one side. You then used your new inhuman strength to heft two felled trees over to the spot and set up a rough triangle perimeter with the hillside. On these, you had the boys scatter dry twigs so that anything moving over them would jostle and break the sticks, alerting you to danger. You didn&#39;t know about other demons, but you felt the system would work well against animals and people. <br />
<br />
Aldritch and Bailey seemed to be more or less over their defeat and more concerned with not being caught off guard in the woods at night. Once the site was prepped and a fire smoldering into existence, you started to ask them about the forest and pretty much anything else they could tell you. You needed to learn about this new world if you wanted to survive long enough to leave it.<br />
<br />
They informed you that these woods were pretty much unregulated, though passing knights might dispense their own brand of justice if they saw something they didn&#39;t like. Cities like Castrumiel were islands of order in a wild sea of chaos. Out in the Wildlands, man and beast were free to act as they pleased due to the fact that no one was there to stop them from doing so. Animals were abundant but so were other creatures like monsters, fairies, demons, and humans who disliked the confines or laws of the cities. <br />
<br />
You were currently on the major path between Castrumiel and the next-closest town, Havengard. It was the same road you had arrived on which slowly transitioned from paved road to dirt path to barely distinguishable grass tract. You had made the rookie mistake of traveling directly on the road alone, making yourself an easy target for thieves such as the brothers. Unless you were well-armed or part of a large group, this was a quick way to wind up penniless or dead. <br />
<br />
The white mage you sought lived between the two towns, closer to Havengard, but his hut was protected by arcane sorcery which no one dark-of-heart could penetrate. If you continued to lose control as you had previously, you may never be able to ask for his help. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Aldritch,&quot; you reply once he had finished speaking. &quot;I hope our previous incident is behind us now and that we can make peace between us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah. I guess since you&#39;re not a real demon it&#39;s not really your fault. But if you ever tell anyone what happened I&#39;ll slit your throat without a second thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
He seemed to be settled with the matter, but you noticed Bailey was still very quiet. His face betrayed confusion and inner conflict, but he refused to admit to you or his brother what was wrong. Eventually you both gave up and curled up for the night, the fire now crackling over the sound of crickets and night frogs.<br />
<br />
You awoke to the feeling of something pressing against your stomach and saw that the younger boy, Bailey, had furtively pulled up your shirt and was feeling your muscular stomach. Normally, you would have jumped back in surprise, but for some reason you found yourself compelled to pretend you were still asleep.  Was it still evil if you weren&#39;t the one doing it? Your conscious told you that it was, of course, but yet you still did not move.<br />
<br />
You watched the boy brush aside his unkempt, golden locks, nervously glancing around to make sure no one was watching. You closed your eyes until only a sliver of vision was left so that he wouldn&#39;t notice you were awake. Bailey, confident he was still being furtive, then bit his lip hesitantly as he untied your codpiece and revealed the bulge in your drawers. He gently moved your hose away from your &quot;hose&quot; and gingerly cupped your junk in his hands through your drawers. The boy then pulled his hands back to his face and inhaled deeply, taking in your masculine musk. He pulled down his own trousers to unveil his adolescent member. He looked back and forth between your bulge and his crotch as if comparing them, either curious or upset that his was so much smaller. Bailey then made his decision to unleash your member from its linen confines and your loins stirred to attention. <br />
<br />
Your demon instincts began to take hold and you found yourself closing your eyes and focusing; then you left your normal senses behind and inhabited your penis fully. You saw through your snake&#39;s eyes, felt the young supple hands caressing your body and bringing you to life, and tasted the flavor of your pungent seed coating your mouth. It felt so bizarre to be your own penis, but as far as your new life went it seemed more the norm than the exception. As you continue to grow with the lifeblood coursing through you, you loosen up and free yourself from the compacted form of a penis to your full serpentine length. You look Bailey in the eyes, a forked tongue flicking in and out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
He is hesitant at first, but allows you to rub yourself against him. You lick his face softly before making your way south, wrapping your shaft around his thin waist before inspecting his endowment more closely. Still a child on the brink of puberty, Bailey&#39;s cock is no more than a few inches long, though it is straining to it&#39;s full length. He is uncircumcised, his foreskin still taut around his glans. Just above the base of his shaft are a few small hairs, showing that he will soon begin blossoming into adulthood. You take the tender flesh into your maw, coating it with the juices you secrete. He whines loudly, making the both of you look towards Aldritch. <br />
<br />
His body remains still, only rising and falling slightly with his breath. Bailey then looks at your unconscious form, but you pull away from his member and use your snake head to turn his face back toward you. When he looks, you see lust beyond his age glowing in his eyes in the nearly dead fire light. You lick at his lips and he opens them, allowing you to press inside. It&#39;s still a strange feeling for you to be outside of your own body (or at least the somewhat normal part) but now you are putting yourself into another creature. His soft mouth suckles your head eagerly, the touch orgasmic on every inch of your skin. You open your mouth and release the building juices into his stomach, filling him up with your mere pre-cum. Bailey drinks it happily while caressing the rest of your exposed length. You feel like you&#39;re about to throw up, but in a purely erotic way. You choke back the wave, knowing what it meant, but wanting to save it for something else. <br />
<br />
Pulling yourself out of his mouth, you see Bailey&#39;s face drop with disappointment, but you only smile and return to his nether regions. You slide your tongue across his member again as you pass, but that&#39;s not your destination. He seems to understand—though more likely from the influence of your pheromones than any experience—and leans back against your sleeping body&#39;s leg. You press your snout against his opening and drool your slick liquids across his hole. He shivers at the touch and squirms anxiously. You decide to give him what he wants and begin pushing inside him. <br />
<br />
It is immediately clear you shouldn&#39;t be able to fit in there, his virgin entry tight around your snout, let alone the rest of your massive head and shaft. Somehow though, you manage to squeeze in inch by ecstatic inch. His gut bulges out with your mass as you force your way inside him. You can hear Bailey breathing heavily and even crying, but his hands are wrapped around your body and trying to help push you in further. You find his sweet spot and wriggle about, making him spasm in pleasure as a hot gooey feeling showers the part of you still outside him. You made him cum without either of you touching his dick: he came only from the pleasure of being entered.<br />
<br />
You begin to notice that you are going much farther than should be possible, but continue going through him, twisting and writhing within his intestines. Your head pushes through a few contraction points against his body&#39;s will until you break through one and find yourself covered in a hot, acidic pool; you&#39;ve reached his stomach! This should be impossible, you should be melting, he should be dead! Then again, you shouldn&#39;t be a demon with a snake penis. So the only thing you could think to do was keep going. The stomach acid is harmless to your body as you swim upwards and break the surface. You open your mouth slightly and the sour acid gets in, but it tastes good to you rather than burning your tongue off. You lick the acid away and keep pressing on. You feel Bailey wretch as you are expelled forward and pop out of his mouth. You turn around to face him and, when he realizes what has happened, he passes out from shock.<br />
<br />
You decide to pull out before anything else happens, but it&#39;s too late for that. Your mind is forced back to your own body and you briefly see your penis impaling the young boy before it shrinks back into his mouth...and detaches from your crotch! Before you can even react, your serpentine member slithers into the boy, disappearing just as another black snake grows from your crotch to take its place. You push your demon lust aside out of fear that you have killed Bailey. You bolt upright and support his limp body against you, checking for a pulse. For one terrifying moment, he is as good as dead. But then, amazingly, he gasps awake, coughing and sputtering violently. He lets out a pitiful squeak before blinking awake.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck did you do to him?!&quot; Aldritch demands in terror, suddenly standing over you, retaking the dagger and grabbing you by the throat. <br />
<br />
His adrenaline gives him strength enough to throw you away from his brother and against the hill, stunning you. He leans over Bailey, who is still recovering, when you notice something odd: you can feel everything the boy is feeling. As Aldritch checks him for injury, you experience every touch the older brother gives the younger. The realization dawns on you and by the time Aldritch asks Bailey if he&#39;s alright, you speak through an adolescent mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, I&#39;m fine!&quot; you say with Bailey&#39;s voice from Bailey&#39;s mouth. &quot;He wasn&#39;t hurting me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! What are you saying? I woke up and heard you choking, and he&#39;s crouched over you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something crawled in my mouth while I was sleeping,&quot; you think up a lie surprisingly quick. &quot;I started choking and he helped me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aldritch looks between the two of you sceptically. &quot;Then why are your pants down?.....Oh my gods! You&#39;re covered in semen! You were having sex with him! What the fuck is wrong with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, fine!&quot; Bailey admits, as you slowly lose your control over him.<br />
<br />
You can still feel everything he does and know what he&#39;s thinking; but you also sense that he&#39;s not really Bailey anymore. He is a mixture of Bailey and your demon side, full of lust for carnal pleasure. He is now loyal to you, completely corrupted by your possession of him and, as he begins speaking again, you can sense that the snake is still inside him, merging itself into his mind and body.<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about earlier,&quot; he explained, which was the truth. &quot;I snuck up on him while he was sleeping and began sucking him off. And you know what? I loved it! It was amazing! I got carried away and took too much in. I started choking on his dick and he woke up and tried to help. He didn&#39;t do anything to me I didn&#39;t want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aldritch is dumbfounded by this, disgusted and ashamed by his brother. But your pheromones were still strong and now Bailey was emitting his own. He couldn&#39;t help but become erect as Bailey crawled closer to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t fight it, brother! It&#39;s really fun! I know it seems wrong, but it feels so good! I want to keep feeling this way, and I want you to feel good too! Join us, Aldritch!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re.....you&#39;re crazy.....&quot; he chokes out nervously. &quot;He&#39;s turned you, corrupted you. You&#39;re not my brother.....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Then why are you so excited down there?&quot; Bailey asks, reaching for his brother&#39;s pants. Aldritch, though appalled, doesn&#39;t stop him...can&#39;t stop him. &quot;You know you want this, deep down inside. Give in to your desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears stream down the elder boy&#39;s face as his younger sibling pulls down the band of his trousers and takes his member into his supple mouth. You watch in a fascinating mixture of horror and arousal as Bailey rapes his helpless older brother, all the while his body changing, transforming into a more demonic form. The boy becomes even more muscular and his equipment grows to proportions larger than most adults, let alone that of a child. Small horns sprout from his head and his canine teeth become menacing fangs. He opens his mouth to kiss his brother and you see the black snake has taken the place of his tongue as it forces itself into Aldritch&#39;s mouth. <br />
<br />
You know that if you let this happen, you have truly given into your own dark side. Once Bailey&#39;s transformation is complete, you will never be able to go back, and you may never want to. You will continue to corrupt anyone you can, unleashing chaos and lust on this land. All of this your demon side informs you, teasing your emotions and making you mad with lust. Your last rational thought is to stop this and save the boys from your own evil. It&#39;s now or never. You force yourself up and slowly crawl over to the young thieves not sure what you will do next.</p>
