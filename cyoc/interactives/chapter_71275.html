<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Tech slowly looks over the scans and rubs his face in confusion, &quot;This . . . . well I am not sure what this is . . . I don’t understand what the hell I am looking at. I'm a technician, I do the scans, and they get sent to a doctor. What I can say is that there is a shadow on the scan which shouldn't be there. It is clouding around the mind, and also seems to be around the upper chest. I didn't scan the whole body, but from the look of it, this is throughout her whole body.&quot; While the scanning was working, you quickly locked the MRI door, making sure to move a few things in front of the door while the technician was busy. Hoping you have secured the door enough, you walk back over to the bewildered technician and look towards the monitor. There is the image if what you think is the brain, it seems normal to you. . . but then you notice that there is a moving black cloud around, and the other monitors which show the upper chest also have similar black cloud moving around. “Is that normal?” You ask the tech, who grants you a shake of his head. &quot;No, it isn't normal. It is as if there is something affecting the magnetic resonance, and normally that doesn't move like this is. What the hell is going on?&quot; He looks at you, confusion written all over his face. You look at the monitors a moment, and then back at the technician, not sure if he will believe you or not. &quot;Some type of virus, like a plaque of some type. I escaped it once, but Eva here also has it. She has now given it to the Doctor who was looking after her, and in turn, he gave it to the security guard.&quot; &quot;A virus doesn't do this to the MRI scans; MRIs are not designed for scanning viruses, well at least this one isn’t – it isn’t sensitive enough to pick up viruses.&quot; You point to the scan monitor, “Then what is that?!” you snap. “Tell me, have you ever seen the scanner do that before?&quot;“No.” The technician replies, also looking over the monitor. “What made you come in here? I would have thought anywhere else would have been better.” “I don't know, I didn't know what a MRI did, I just thought I needed to get her somewhere, and here was as good as anywhere.... and I needed to get her help.... I need help, the Doctor who was helping her has fallen to the virus, and god knows who else it is affecting out there.&quot;“The virus is loose in the hospital?” The Tech walks over to the phone, and you raise your mace again, “If the virus has broken out, I need to let the main office know so we can start outbreak procedures.”You think about it for a second before nodding, “Okay, but we have a carrier right here, we can learn about the virus here, in safety.”&quot;Well, MRI scans don’t help understanding the virus, but . . . we are going to need a doctor to help understand this, and different equipment. Trust me, I don’t know what the hell is going on, but I have been at this job for many years, and what I am seeing on the scans really makes me realise there is some crazy shit happening. So trust me . . . “You pause a moment, trying to read if he is lying on his face, and really you can’t tell. Sighing you nod your head, at which the Tech picks up the phone and dials a number . . . and waits.“Okay this is strange, I have dialled the emergency line and nothing is happening.” He puts the receiver down, then picks it up and tries the number again . . . again nothing.“I think I’m going to go look what the hell is going on in the office.” “No! You go out there, and you could just get effected like the rest of them.” You snap, “Then what do you want to do. . . just stay in here and let your friend possibly die?” The Tech snaps back, making you look towards the monitors again. You know he is right, you could bunk up in here, but either Eva would die, or, she will finally wake up and that would mean you were locked in the MRI with an infected person. Finally you nod, “Okay let’s get her out of there, and find a doc...&quot; Just as you were about to finish, there is a loud bang on the door. You spin around as you see a woman through the door's small window, her face full of lust. She once again bangs on the door, trying to open it, but your lock of the door holds. &quot;What the hell, I will tell her to leave.&quot; The technician starts to walk towards the door, before you grab his arm and stop him. &quot;No! You don't understand . . . the virus, it makes people into mindless . . . best word for it is Bimbos. Sorry, not technical, and I know it sounds like something out of a fantasy story, but this is true. The doctor, the security guard, so many people before, they all changed into female sex starved bimbos, looking for sex. And anyone they had sex with ended up being just like them.&quot; &quot;Are you trying to tell me that the Doctor had sex with this woman?&quot; &quot;No . . . that woman is probably the former security guard. The Doctor was infected by just Eva spitting on him, and god knows what he is now doing.”The Tech walks up to the window, and looks out of it, and you notice his face grows pale. “Oh my god!”You walk up beside him and look out the other small window, getting a full glimpse of men and women making love in the corridors, some of the men in the middle of their transformation into the mindless bimbo stage of the infection. “See, what did I tell you!”The Tech stares at the insanity outside the MRI door, as the woman keeps banging on the door trying to get in, her lust full glaze eyeing you both up like a prize piece of meat. “And that woman in the MRI is infected like these?” The Tech finally asks, looking back at the scanning room.“I believe so. Slower than it appears to be happening out there, but yes, she infected the doctor.” You reply back to the Technician as you watch more of the men changing.“Then I think it might be a good idea to gag and tie her up again.” The technician stated as he turns from the door, and powers down the scanner. You watch him a moment as he again tries the phone, only to slowly put it down.“I think we have to assume that since the alarms are not going, the virus has quickly infected the office and security staff, so we need to get out of here – and we need to get to another hospital right away to see if they can help.” “Okay, but we can’t get out there, I know what it is like, those girls will be over us in seconds and we would be joining them, like them, in a matter of minutes.” You reply.“There is a back door. . . It goes to an emergency lift which we can use to get to the basement. From there, we get in an ambulance and we are off.” The Tech states as he finishes powering down the last of the MRI equipment. “Now, we get your friend, and prevent her infecting us.”You both walk into the scanner room, pulling Eva out of the machine. The Tech pulls out a couple of badges and ties them around Eva’s mouth, making sure to wear gloves at the time. Then you both quickly bind her back to the gurney.</p>
