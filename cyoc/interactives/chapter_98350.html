<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Over the course of the next three months, both Amy and Jess each continued to develop. Dr. Ross had been right. The next week, the girls had their first period, and, the following month Amy&#39;s training bra was no longer sufficient to contain her obviously swelling mammaries. The following month she proudly switched to a B-cup for both uppen and lower pairs... Only to make a somewhat confused return trip to the mall a mere month and a half later to upgrade when they discovered that her bottom set had swollen into a C-cup, while the upper pair had now expanded to a full D... And then, within another month after *that*, the family was left a bit dumbfounded when Amy&#39;s chest had outright blossomed yet again to sport a DD-cup pair or tits on her lower chest, while her upper set was now an incredible DDD-cup! Both Amy and Jess, who had initially been estatic that they now had a chest to start showing off to the boys, were now actually getting slithly intimidated by the rather awed stares that their now-much-shaplier frame was rapidly starting to draw both at school and while they were out and about. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jes, in her own way, was rapidly starting to develop even more dramitcally than her sister, if such was possible. First, within a few weeks, the lump that apeared at the base of her neck had swollen and developed enout that it could actually be called a true &quot;penis&quot; of her own, and, much to her delight, it, indeed was soon capable of passing their body&#39;s urine from its terminal end rather than Jess being forced to pass it from her mouth as she had had to for her entire life up till that point. Jess was on cloud nine for days after they learned that. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so awesome!&quot;, exclaimed Jess as the girls finished taking an experimental piss into the toilet with it. &quot;I bet, so long as everyone knows that I keep brushing and using mouthwath regularly, I can even convince some boys in class to kiss me within a month or three!&quot;, she said gleefully.<br />
<br />
However, very soon after that, it soon became very clear that both the new penis and Jess herself were far from done developing. Within another two weeks, it had first become apparant that Jess was undergoing another growth spurt. While a short time ago, she had been 24 cm soft and 32 erect, now she was 33 soft, and 39 erect. She was slowly getting thicker in girth too, and as well as the overall size of her  head itself, though the growth of both her girth and head was not as dramatic in comparison to the exxpansion of her length. More than that, the new penis that she had had begun to develop six, odd, frond-shaped nodes about its head, and to the girls shock, two more small lumps of flesh had begun  to develop on Jess&#39; body at the base off the new dick as well. Concernedly, the family arranged a new visitation with Dr. Ross. Before they got in to see her, it soon became more obvious even from casual observation that , not only was Jess new cock growing longer itself at its own rapid pace, but the &quot;fronds&quot; about the head of it were developing into what seemed like flexible tendrils, and the cock itself seemed much more flexible itself, and now seemed more responsive to Jess&#39; desires.<br />
<br />
&quot;It almost seems...&quot;, said Dr. Ross, when the girls finally got into see her. &quot;... like your penis is also deveoping into something like a functional arm of your own, Jess.... Or, at least something like a tentacle. The fronds at the end seem to be acting like manipulatory fingers for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, I thought it was a penis. We even used it to pee with.&quot;, asked Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it still *is* one at that...&quot;, replied Dr. Ross. &quot;It&#39;s merely that, very soon, it&#39;s going to double as a tentacle arm for you as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An... An arm of my own?&quot;, said Jess in wonder. &quot;That&#39;s amazing... But... but why can&#39;t I seem to quite control it, yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, its still developing, along with its nervous system. But, so long as everything stays healthy... and, from what I can tell, it seems to be... then, within the next few weeks, you should start developing more and more concious control over its motions... It&#39;s never going to be quite as strong as Amy&#39;s arms, backed up with their skeletal structure, but, it should still be more than strong enough to pick up and manipulate smaller, lighter things, like pencils... Pens... Silverware... Open doors on your own...<br />
<br />
&quot;Do... Do you think I could use it to use something like a computer on without holding a stylus in my mouth, or having Amy help me?&quot;, asked Jess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure! I could only imagine so. Especially if it features a touch screen... You might likely still need your mouth-stylus for certain functions, but it should still be more than possible, and much, much easier a task than it would have been before.&quot;, Dr. Ross answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what about the other bump&#39;s she&#39;s growing now? The ones on either side of her penis...arm?&quot;, asked Amy, concernedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, believe it or not... It&#39;s breast tissue.&quot;, repied Dr. Ross. &quot;Jess, Amy&#39;s not the only one of you two who&#39;s growing breasts now... Very soon, it looks like you&#39;re going to have two of your own as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My...My own breasts?&quot;, asked Jess, once again marvelling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m super happy for you, Jess. I really am...&quot;, said Amy. &quot;But, if your breasts start growing like mine have, we&#39;re going to have to definitely get all of our pants totally redesigned.... That is, if we&#39;ll be able to wear pants at all.&quot;, she said, as Amy ran her hands over the swell of her own tits, which were in the midst of their rapid climb through the alphabet of cup sizes from where they had been just mere weeks beforehand<br />
<br />
&quot;Well. They definitely are growing...&quot;, Dr. Ross interjected. &quot;But, while you girls might, indeed, need a new design for your pants in time, I doubt you&#39;ll wind up needing to forgo them entirely. Or, at least, you shouldn&#39;t have to switch to anything worse than a revised dress. Your breasts aren&#39;t developing at near the same pace as Amy&#39;s are, Jess. In time, you might wind up with breasts larger than average than girls with &quot;traditional&quot; body types, it&#39;s doubtful that you&#39;re going to match anything near your sisters... I suppose it&#39;s up to you whether to take that as good or bad news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... Considering that just yesterday, I didn&#39;t really think I&#39;d ever have brests of my own at all, It&#39;s still probably good...&quot;, said Jess, blushing. &quot;Golly... Both a new arm and new breasts of my very own...&quot;, Jess mused. Suddenly, she couldn&#39;t wait to gain full control of her penis-arm fast enoush... She desperately wanted to seewhat it felt like to massage her new tits with her new tentacle hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot;, Amy began to ask, remembering one final thing. &quot;What about Jess&#39; body growing? ...Is that normal too?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Ross folded her arms. &quot;I can&#39;t give you a definitive answer on that, quite yet. As you both know, Jess has, up till now, has held a rather diminuitive body size in comparison to your own growth development, Amy. But now, with puberty startin to hit the both of you, it seems that, overall, she&#39;s sort of &quot;catching up&quot; in her own way to you... But, I can definitely assure you both... and Jess herself, in particular, of course... that she definitely seems very healthy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess and Amy exchanged glances at each other and each sighed, relieved. Amy laid a comforting hand on the side of her sister&#39;s face, who, in turn, leaned into her palm. &quot;That&#39;s good... That&#39;s good!&quot;, said Jess, smiling. &quot;...but, how big do you think I&#39;ll eventually get?&quot;, she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t precisely say, for certain. The answer to that is up to time and your body to answer.&quot;, replied Dr. Ross.<br />
<br />
By the end of six months of changes for the girls, it turned out that the answer to that question would be &quot;...At least three full feet in length.&quot;. Jess continued to grow roughly a centimeter every few days, until she had reached a length of 94 centimeters soft, and 120 erect. She now had a head roughly half of the  size of Amy&#39;s compared to the mere third it was at the birth of the girls. Despite her greatly increased length, Jess now found that the muscular action of her neck seemed much more adept, and she could now support crane her head about somewhat like a giraffe or long-necked dinosaur.  Now able to support her own weight, she was not in danger of being tripped over or bumped into things nearly as much, and it did not strain Amy to support her sister, as well as booting Jess&#39; own sense of self-confidence. Jess&#39; own penis had now fully developed into a flexible tendril and was, itself, now approximately the length of her neck, albeit only half of the thickness. What had been mere fronds at the start had thickened into long finger-like growths emerging from under the cap of her foreskin, and able to clutch and manipulate objects several inches away from the head of her cock. Jess had complete control over this limb, and, unlike the rest of their body, Amy could not &quot;pull rank&quot; and subvert control of it from Jess, as se could with other limbs... It seemed Jess&#39; cock was Jess&#39; alone to control. Jess&#39;s new breasts had actully managed to overshoot Dr. Ross&#39; estimate by a small margin... They had now blossomed into a DD-cup breasts, with one situated to each side of the base of Jess&#39;s neck. Just like Jess&#39; neck and face, both girls felt arousal and pleasure whenever Jess&#39; breasts or her dick-arm were stimulated. Of course, Dr. Ross was still right about Amy&#39;s breasts development being hard for jess to catch up with... Amy&#39;s tits now  had grown into DDDDDD-cup (or I-cup) monsters on top and only somewhat less intimidating DDDD-cups (G-cups) for the set she sported on her lower chest. Jess&#39; new favorite hobby while the girls were relaxing was lying back and snuggling the length of he neck amidst her sister&#39;s bosoms, and lying her head alonggside of Amy&#39;s on the pillow... Jess mused her position as the girls watched T.V.... Jess could now actually look at things at her sister&#39;s level or look Amy and her parents directly in the eye... It was such a strange and marvelous change from how things had been just six months beforehand for her.</p>
