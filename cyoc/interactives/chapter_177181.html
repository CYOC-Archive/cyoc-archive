<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You had lost track of how long you&#39;ve been Prince Karther&#39;s anus.  For certain, it has to have been at least a couple years.  Probably not quite five, yet.  You had initially thought to keep track of your days within the kitsune&#39;s cheeks, but you had lost count, and nobody seemed interested in reminding you.  Not even the Prince.  Though he initially took pride in taunting you, especially as you were being used to expel his waste, he eventually lost interest.  It had been so long since the last time he spoke to you, you wondered if he even remembered you were in there.  Nothing but a regular anus to him, only deserving of attention when in use and cleaned.  Certainly nothing that should be acknowledged as a person.<br />
<br />
At this point, though, you were not only used to this life, but you had accepted it.  Prince Karther made it clear from the start that this would be your life from now on, with no hope of escaping.  A spell so strong, not even HE could undo it.  The Prince no doubt intended you to be miserable for the rest of your living existance.  And initially, you were.  Your body felt so alien, transformed into the tight pucker that it now is.  Trapped in darkness, barely given the chance to see the world outside the kitsune cheeks, which shift around you constantly when he walks.  No movement of your own, but a passenger in another being&#39;s body.  The warmth and smell of your prison.  And especially the taste of poop that you now had to endure on a daily basis.  Even once cleaned off, there was an aftertaste that just woudln&#39;t go away.  The Prince taunting you at every opportunity.  It was all awful.  And you hoped beyond hope that you would wake up and find it all just a dream.<br />
<br />
But that wasn&#39;t the case.  You&#39;d wake up the next day, still an anus.  Still along for the ride.  Still getting a taste of the Prince&#39;s stool.  The next day arrives, and you&#39;re still an anus.  And then the next, and the next.  By the start of the second week, it had become clear that this was your life, now.  Nothing was going to change it.  You couldn&#39;t change back.  And you couldn&#39;t end your life, either.  And so, you decided to accept it.  The Prince wants you to be miserable?  You&#39;ll show him.  He wants to mock your position?  Joke&#39;s on him, you LIKE your position!<br />
<br />
Well, not at first.  Everything about your new life, especially the taste of poop, took some time to get used to.  In a way, though, you were thankful that you couldn&#39;t ease your way into this life.  If you were going to get used to life as an anus, this was the way to do it.  Even as the toilet bowl loomed below you, and that pressure built behind you, you tried telling yourself, &quot;How many people get to experience life as a Kitsune Prince&#39;s anus?&quot;  It may not be a pleasant life, but by golly, it was an experience like any other!<br />
<br />
And over time, you did get used to it.  The persistant taste of your anus body, you never noticed it anymore.  To you, it was no more noticeable than the taste of your human mouth.  You also noticed the varying taste of Prince Karther&#39;s poop.  Each day, it would taste a little different, depending on his meal.  Certainly rancid.  But after a while of tasting nothing else, the rancidness just became a normal part of the flavor.<br />
<br />
Over time, the worst part of being an anus was no longer your function, but the boredom.  Outside of being used to expel waste, there isn&#39;t much for a kitsune&#39;s anus to do.  With your home being the Prince&#39;s cheeks, draped over by his many tails, you never got to see the world outside your new home, outside of the toilet and bath.  (The latter was a silver lining for you, as you were indeed well taken care of.)  And though you could still hear, the conversations were often too muffled for you to make much sense out of.  Sometimes it seemed the Prince left his palace, interacting with the people of his kingdom.  And on occasion, you heard Janice&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
You are still not sure what happened with your once-friend.  Was she really brainwashed?  Or was life as a Kitsune Prince&#39;s concubine just that good?  Though you have accepted your life as an anus, you do sometimes feel regret.  Had you submitted to Karther&#39;s offer, you would still be a person.  Female, and no longer human, but at least you&#39;d have an anus instead of be one.  Oh well, best not to dwell on it.  You have no way of communicating with Prince Karther, and he couldn&#39;t release you even if you could.<br />
<br />
And so, here you are, another day as a kitsune&#39;s anus.  A little bit ago, you had just been used once again to release Karther&#39;s waste.  This one was one of your favorite meals to expel.  A shame you didn&#39;t know what it started as.<br />
<br />
Oh, well.  Now it seems the Prince is in one of his regular love-making sessions.  If being pooped out of was the hardest part of this new life, the Prince&#39;s love-making sessions were the most awkward.  Even muffled, there was no mistaking what was going on outside your prison.  The way the kitsune&#39;s cheeks moved around you, and the occasional sounds that you would catch.  If you could cover your rears (or heck, leave the room), you would.  But, you are part of Prince Karther&#39;s body.  Where he goes, you go.<br />
<br />
You briefly wonder how your neighbor is doing.  A few weeks ago, there was a commotion.  Someone had gotten Prince Karther incredibly mad, for reasons you couldn&#39;t quite hear.  What you did hear, was the loud command of &quot;You do not deserve to feel pleasure of my penis!  Instead, you shall become what houses it!&quot;  If you understood correctly, this means that someone is now living as Prince Karther&#39;s sheathe, much like you&#39;re living as his anus.<br />
<br />
You had hoped the absorbtion of another person would mean you&#39;d finally have someone to converse with.  Unfortunately, much like you have no way of communicating with Karther, you have no way of communicating with his newly-sentient sheathe.  The poor soul probably doesn&#39;t even know you&#39;re here.<br />
<br />
The event did make you wonder, though, if anybody else had been absorbed into Prince Karther before you.</p>
