<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A series of squawks and flapping wings suddenly erupted as Vicky reached into a nearby birdcage. Inside were three crows, though Vicky’s hand was clearly hunting for a particular one as it tried to hop away in the confined space. However, the terrified bird wasn’t able to evade Vicky for long as she expertly darted forward and grabbed it tightly in her hand.<br />
<br />
“There we are dear,” Vicky said with a smile as she brought the bird out of the cage, “what an adorable birdie you make; so feisty and in denial about your new purpose in life.” The crow cawed out angrily as it tried to peck at Vicky’s arm. “Ah, ah, I would stop that if I were you, after all you don’t want the rest of your family to suffer for your bad behaviour.” Upon hearing this the bird quickly quietened down, though it still stared at Vicky with pure hatred in her eyes. “That’s better,” Vicky said as she brought the bird over to you, “now Tracey, say hello to Princess!”<br />
<br />
You and the crow locked eyes with each other for a few moments, though neither of you made a sound. You guessed that, like you, she was hunting for the telltale glint of human intelligence that revealed a formerly-human animal. As a result, the crow’s expression softened slightly as you got the feeling that she was feeling sorry for you. You couldn’t help feeling the same as the anger in the crow’s eyes started to shift into one of sadness. Clearly she had already been through hell and yet she still had the willpower to keep resisting.<br />
<br />
Regrettably, Vicky didn’t seem at all phased by the bird’s obvious distress as she smiled down at her sadistically. “Hmmm… I suppose I had better explain where I got such a gorgeous bird. Well, Tracey here used to be one of our neighbours. She and her family used to live in a sweet little cottage just down the road from us. At first we were happy to leave them in peace, but sadly Tracey and her husband decided to make things difficult…”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she slowly walked over to another cage that was stacked against the wall. Then, still holding Tracey in one hand, she deftly reached her other hand in and pulled out another terrified-looking creature. Soon, you could see that it was a fluffy white rabbit, who was busy kicking and flailing uselessly as Vicky held it up by its ears.<br />
<br />
“Here we are,” Vicky said as she presented the rabbit to you, “this adorable bunny of mine is Tracey’s former-husband Bille! Of course she used to just be known as ‘Bill,’ but when she made the change from a human man into a female rabbit we could hardly keep her old male name!” The rabbit seemed visibly angered by this until Vicky shot her a threatening glare. “Now then, I’ll let you two have a little reunion while I tell Princess your story. But if either of you tries anything then it won’t just be you that suffers for it.”<br />
<br />
With that Vicky gently placed the crow and rabbit on a nearby table. The two animals instantly moved to embrace each other as best they could with their new animalistic bodies. Seeing this touching scene made you feel truly sorry for the unfortunate couple as they looked at each other with a mix of both love and despair.<br />
<br />
“Now then,” Vicky continued, “let me continue my little story. Well, you see Tracey and Bill used to be perfectly decent neighbours, that is, until the complaints started.” As she said this Vicky moved to loom over the two animals as she smiled down at them evilly. “At first it was just minor things, like hearing a bit too much noise or being stuck in traffic that we apparently caused. Gradually though, the complaints grew more serious and started to sound more like threats. Soon they were claiming that they had a legal right to our land and that they had filed an application to get us evicted. Plus, they also tried to blackmail us by threatening to tell the world ‘what we were really up to.’ Well, as I’m sure you can imagine, we simply could not allow any of this to happen.”<br />
<br />
Vicky paused briefly after saying this as she continued to watch the rabbit and crow nuzzling each other affectionately. “Alright, I’d say that’s enough you two. Now roll over, and make sure Princess has a good view of your new and improved bodies!” The two animals exchanged a worried look but, with Vicky’s threats still hanging in the air, both of them did eventually slump to the floor and roll over onto their backs. Following this, Vicky beckoned you to come closer as she placed a hand on each of the animals’ chests. Then, you watched in morbid curiosity as Vicky slowly ran her hands further down both animals until her fingers ended up reaching their more intimate areas. Then, a squeak and a squawk suddenly echoed out as Vicky’s fingers found Billie’s vagina and Tracey’s cloaca respectively. Soon, Vicky was slowly rubbing both sex organs as she relished the humiliation she was inflicting upon the unfortunate couple.<br />
<br />
“That’s it, such good little pets of mine. You both like that, don’t you girls?” Both animals stirred for a moment but were unable to make a noise as the unwanted pleasure of the moment stole their breath away. Instead, they could do little more than squirm around on the table as Vicky seemed to know exactly which spots to target.<br />
<br />
“Now then, where were we?” Vicky asked as she continued to tease the crow and rabbit beneath her. “Ah yes, I was just getting onto the good part: the night we dealt with Tracey and her troublesome family.” Vicky then paused dramatically before continuing. “Well, my parents and I decided to use a little bit of blackmail of our own to put an end to Tracey’s threats. First, we lured her husband and three sons to the farm, on the pretence that we wanted to come to some sort of agreement. Of course, being the headstrong men they used to be, they failed to see the danger until it was too late. I’ll never forget the look on Bill’s face as he watched his three proud sons being turned into a trio of dumb, smelly animals. Indeed, those three were some great acquisitions; now we have a nice fat sow, a productive dairy cow and a rather horny jenny, all of whom still serve us to this day.”<br />
<br />
Strangely, as Vicky said this she seemed to get noticeably excited. Something about transforming people and then treating them like animals almost seemed to turn her on. As a result of this, a louder series of pleasurable noises rang out from Tracey and Billie as the fingers teasing them now slowly pressed inside their tight sexes. Soon, the two animals were crying out in delight as Vicky began pressing in and out of them right up to her knuckles.<br />
<br />
Vicky continued like this for a few moments before she resumed her story. “And so, having seen his sons being reduced to livestock, we all escorted Bill back to his house. Then, after a brief conversation with dear Tracey, the couple agreed to cancel all of the lawsuits they had brought against my family. Of course, we then determined that the two of them had already seen too much to be released. For this reason we decided that it would be best if we looked after them; and so they became the pathetic animals you see before you...”<br />
<br />
As Vicky said this she abruptly stopped her teasing of the helpless crow and rabbit. Both seemed somewhat relieved as they lay panting and gasping for breath. However, it soon became clear that Vicky wasn’t done with them yet as she slowly grabbed Billie by her waste and carried her over to where her wife was lying. “Now Tracey, you keep that beak up for me; I think it’s time for you two lovers to have some more fun together…”<br />
<br />
With that, Vicky slowly lowered Billie down towards his wife. As instructed, Tracey kept her beak pointing straight up as her expression remained largely dulled by the lust that was now coursing through her. As a result, Vicky continued to lower Billie towards her wife with a smile on her face. Then, a loud squeal echoed around the building as Billie’s tight vagina connected with her wife’s vertical beak. This garbled cry only got louder and more needy as Vicky continued to press down, causing Billie to slowly descend over the crow’s beak. Soon, Billie was effectively sitting on Tracey’s face as her vagina now enveloped the entire length of the bird’s beak.<br />
<br />
“Now then Billie,” Vicky said as she locked eyes with the lust-addled rabbit, “I want you to ride that beak inside you like the dirty animal you now are!”<br />
<br />
There was a brief pause after Vicky said this as the former-man seemed to hesitate. However, this moment was only fleeting as Billie obediently started to slowly move her hips, causing her to rise back up the beak inside her. Then, the rabbit let out another squeal of delight as she shoved back down suddenly, causing the beak to spread her wide as it sank deep into her furry body. Soon, Billie was busy repeating this process, as she eagerly started to ride her wife’s beak as if her life now depended on it.<br />
<br />
As Billie started to get used to her new routine, Vicky moved one hand up to hold the rabbit’s floppy ears so that she could help her move faster and harder over her wife’s beak. In the meantime, Vicky moved her other hand back between Tracey’s feathery legs. Then she promptly resumed playing with the helpless bird as she stuffed two fingers straight back into her slick cloaca; after which she started rapidly blasting her digits in and out of the startled bird as she squawked and rolled around in unwanted pleasure.<br />
<br />
As things progressed, you could only watch the debauched scene in shock as Vicky continued to violate her two victims. Soon, any hint of shame or regret was gone from the two animals as both cried out and squirmed from the pleasure coursing through them. The whole thing was disturbing to watch as Billie occasionally stopped to hump and grind on her wife’s face, while in return the crow parted her beak so that her husband’s pussy was stretched even wider. Soon, it was obvious that this strange orgy was about to end as the calls of both animals now shook the building.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Billie forced herself down the beak one last time before her whole body began to tremble in release. From where you were standing you could clearly see a splatter of wetness erupting over the crow’s face as her husband came hard above her. Following on from this, Tracey also finished not long after as a loud caw reverberated from inside Billie’s stuffed vaginal passage. As a result, you could now see juices coating Vicky’s outstretched fingers. Vicky then nonchalantly wiped these two digits off on Billie’s fur before she pulled her off Tracey’s beak.<br />
<br />
With the action having dramatically ended, Vicky turned to address the two panting animals as they lay together. “Wow, that was fun wasn’t it?! As a reward I must remember to let you see your three daughters again. However  I must warn you, they may be harder to recognise than on your last visit. All three seem to have taken to their new lives, so much so that they may not even recognise you. After all, why would they need their old family when they can happily make their own? In fact, I think I’m right in saying that all three of them are now pregnant again, so I guess you two can look forward to having even more grandchildren in the not-too-distant future!” <br />
<br />
The rabbit and crow simply groaned upon hearing this, clearly too tired from their ordeal to really protest.<br />
<br />
“And on that note,” Vicky continued, “I think the two of you also have some more work to do. Tracey, I want your next clutch to be an especially large one; and as for you Billie, I am providing you with three more mating partners in the hopes that you can, as the saying goes, start breeding like rabbits…”<br />
<br />
Again the two animals could only groan in dismay as Vicky deftly scooped them up and carried them back over to their respective cages. You whinnied in shock as Billie was dropped into a cage alongside two other rabbits. Then, you watched in horror as she was instantly mounted by one of her cage-mates, who began eagerly humping away as Billie let out more cries of unwanted animal passion. <br />
<br />
However, things only got worse for Billie when Vicky brought over another cage, which was filled with three more excited-looking rabbits. Then, as promised, Vicky carefully unloaded Billie’s three new breeding partners before she shut the cage and left the outnumbered female at their mercy. <br />
<br />
As the male rabbits continued to take advantage of the lone female, Vicky turned her attention back to Tracey. The crow cried out pleadingly as she watched her husband being violated inside her cage. However, Vicky only chuckled back to the horrified bird as she unceremoniously threw her back into her birdcage. There was then a great deal of squawking and flapping as the cage started to swing from the commotion going on inside. However, the upshot of this was that Tracey was soon also being violated as she squatted down with one of the other crows now resting on her back. <br />
<br />
Regrettably though, and in spite of her initial protests, Tracey’s cries of panic quickly turned into caws of joy as she felt her sensitive cloaca grinding against that of her mate. Before long, both she and Billie were totally overwhelmed by their mating instincts as they now eagerly worked with the males on their backs to satisfy their powerful primal urges.<br />
<br />
And so, with her story having now reached its cruel conclusion, Vicky left Billie and Tracey to it as she declared that it was time for another story. With this in mind she began pacing around the small building as she started hunting for her next victim.<br />
<br />
After inspecting a few of the various cages and glass tanks Vicky seemed to have made her selection. Meanwhile you could only watch in stunned silence as Vicky reached into one of the containers and introduced you to yet another one of her family’s unfortunate victims...</p>
