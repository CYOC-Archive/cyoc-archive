<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maurice and Snowy had mad it clear, Daniel, the scientist, would have to make it clear that he was wanting to amend for the wrongs he did to people so they had set up a video conference which would be viewed by the Italian government, the United Nations, and all of Janice. He stood up there nervous as one could be, afraid that people would form a lynch mob to hang his hide. But he went on. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen. I am Dr. Daniel Streigt. I am responsible for the insect breakout in the Vatican. I come forward to appoligize for my crime. I didn&#39;t mean for it to end in violence, and I certainly did not mean to cause anyone harm. Mrs. Charlie Wise, forgive me for turning you into what I did, and you to Mrs. Brent Wise. Mrs Sally Wise, my creation wasn&#39;t ment to rape nor harm you. I didn&#39;t add the lust part into my formula. But I will do what I can to find out. That I promise. The scorpkats were ment to become guardians to those like yourself and myself. Never to cause harm, nor rape, nor forcibly turn someone.&quot; He paused for a long time as he was thinking, then continued. &quot;Right now, as we speak I am working to help create the ultimate Vaccine that will topple any and all virus&#39;s. I am making it where all can take it, be they human or kat. Not only will this stop the kat changes or prevent spreading from one kat to human, but it will also stop all known illnesses that man suffers, be it cancer, aids, hiv, heppetitus, eccetra. I have been put under house arrest by the Janice Sheriff&#39;s department, and will not leave until these outbreaks are done and gone. From this day forth I will create a scorpkat serum which can be taken willingly by any man, woman, or child that wishes, but it will lack the lust part. I ask for your forgiveness, citizens of the Vatican, Rome and the whole of Italy. My crime is unforgible but I will write the wrongs I&#39;ve done should I be given that chance. Thank you.&quot; After that Daniel walked off stage and right over to Raul who was watching him. <br />
<br />
An hour later Maria Heroud was sitting there as her phone rang. &quot;Yes sir, thank you, chief.&quot; She smiled and looked at Daniel. &quot;Good news, you&#39;ve been given your second chance.&quot; She looks. &quot;Don&#39;t fuck it up, for if you do, I will personally put a bullet between your eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded. &quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; He walked over to Sally and looked at her. &quot;Miss, I truely am sorry for what they did. I didn&#39;t aim for the Scorpkats to do what they did. Your mate, I used my own formula, but I don&#39;t know why shi reacted differently than the others. As I said, I will help make the perfect vaccine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doc, I can&#39;t be anymore mad at  you than I could with Maurice, however, if you do keep to your word, you will have a new friend. But, considering you appoligized for what you did, I can forgive you. Give the benifit of the doubt so to speak. However, should you do that again, a bullet would be the least of your worries.&quot; Shi said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I wasn&#39;t aiming to tear your family apart, if I&#39;d kown, I&#39;d&#39;ve used anot....&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally laughed at that. &quot;Tear my family apart? Do you really think that if my mate would&#39;ve stayed as a scorpkat, it&#39;d tear us apart? Even if it was permanent, my love for hir would&#39;ve remained. Sure it would&#39;ve taken possibly three years to adjust, but in time I would&#39;ve grown to accept it. I love Charlie, and would never, ever, turn on my love. If anything what you did, is made our family stronger.&quot; She poked the scientist with a claw, meaning every single word of what shi said, though the three year period, it would&#39;ve been longer, but she wasn&#39;t going to admit that. It was fear that held hir when Charlie was a scorpkat, but shi had made a dessicion that no matter what, when they got married they had to be there for each other, no matter what. So shi realized what that ment. Regardless of Charlie&#39;s form, shi had to love hir, for that&#39;s why drove hir to want to be back.<br />
<br />
Shi walked up to Charlie, noting the change had triggered Charlie&#39;s heat. It had been awhile since they made love and knew what they had agreed on, but knowing the terrorists, they&#39;ll wait for a long term for another outbreak. So shi took Charlie home. &quot;Love, I want to appoligize.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For what, Sally?&quot; Shi was a bit confused, but noticed what shi wanted to do. &quot;Sally, we can&#39;t. We pro....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh. I wanna mate with my mantikat.&quot; Shi said. &quot;Don&#39;t pry me of that.&quot; Shi kissed Charlie on the lips. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s been six years since we have had fun.&quot; Shi walked up behind Charlie and mounted hir, cock ready. Charlie was wanting this as much as Sally, so shi allowed it. Sally began thrusting into hir mate, who wrapped his tail safely around hir to prevent stinging Sally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you really have stayed with me if I were still a scorpkat?&quot; Charlie asked hir.<br />
<br />
&quot;Love,&quot; Sally said, &quot;you underestimate our love if you think my wound being reopen would ever, ever change the way I feel about you. I would&#39;ve wanted time alone to heal after the Vatican. I will admit, had me and Jess....&quot; Shi paused as shi thrusted into hir mate, &quot;Not nearly gotten raped, I&#39;d love to have you fill me with eggs.&quot; Shi teased Charlie as she kissed hir neck, thrusting hard and fast.<br />
<br />
Charlie moaned at the pure pleasure of their love making as Sally went deep into hir. &quot;Hmmm... oh god Sally.&quot; Shi lowered down to give Sally better penetration, which did help. &quot;I missed this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As did I, my love.&quot; Shi thrust, picking up the pace, rubbing Charlie&#39;s furry breasts. &quot;Grant it, you having two sets, I&#39;m surprised the others haven&#39;t bound and raped you yet.&quot; Shi teases Charlie&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
After about a half hour of mating, Sally fills Charlie&#39;s womb with hir seed. As shi did, Raul walked up behind. &quot;Uh... Sa....&quot; He rubbed his head. &quot;Sorry, you two.&quot; He looked as Sally dismounted and looked at Raul.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Raul. Been a while since you visited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you two are breeding.&quot; He said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well....&quot; Sally started.<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave your word that you&#39;d wait.&quot; He walked up. &quot;Nevermind that, it&#39;ll just mean you&#39;ll have to stay here for the next mission.&quot; He pointed. &quot;You two are lucky we&#39;ve got enough people. Especially with Jess sidelined.&quot; He pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know. So what&#39;s the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re going to go talk to the UN, me and Maria. We have to get armies into North and South Korea to prevent what is going to happen. Even if it means taking over the small nations.&quot; He said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sounds like a plan.&quot; Charlie looked out. &quot;What the hell?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s David. He decided to become an insectkat. Particularly an ant. Not a bad choice either. I rather loved ants.&quot; Raul smiled. &quot;Just giving you two a heads up. I got to go tell the rest what&#39;s up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright.&quot; Sally smiled and snuggled hir mate.</p>
