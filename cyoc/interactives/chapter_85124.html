<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Anubis, Janace, and Talia had begun searching for what seemed like hours. No trace of what they were searching for. Not even the cave where Sally and Jess had found their mother due to the heavy snow fall. Anubis was over sniffing around trying to find clues to where Talia&#39;s sister could be, which brought out a giggle from Janace. &quot;Anubis honey, what are you doing? You do realize that her scent would&#39;ve been gone ages ago, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I.... I&#39;m only trying to keep my mind off the cold, Jan.&quot; Shi would say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Well, go ahead, then.&quot; Shi loved him and all his quirks.<br />
<br />
Which the way shi was looking at hir brought a giggle and comment from Talia. &quot;You two are so cute together.&quot; They walked around until they finally stumbled on the cave where Janace was. There they decided to rest their feet. Janace though was wanting to know why this, in the middle of the Antarctic, was so warm. So shi decided to explore deeper, and thanks to hir new eyes it was possible. Shi smiled looking around until shi found something that intrigued hir. I seemed to warm up. But it also appeared someone lived here. Shi knelt down and examined a bowl and then continued on deeper. &quot;Hmmm.... I wonder.&quot; Shi then stopped when shi felt it getting colder. Shi looked around and seen this was like a room. This cavern, shi don&#39;t know why shi never searched it before, but now shi is.  Eventually shi came to what shi was looking for. &quot;Talia, Anubis, I found hir.&quot;<br />
<br />
That brought the two running. Talia started to flash back to the times they were growing up.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to win this time Talia.&quot; Shi giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no way Ailat. I&#39;m going to.&quot; The two were racing in the air, no older than fifteen, the age of man was fairly young. Early 3,000 B.C. to be exact. Shi and Ailat, a way their mother named them, they were reflections of each other. Challenging each other to do better. Ailat had colors that matched that of a tiger while Talia had that of a lion.<br />
<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another time Talia and Ailat decided to part ways and teach humanity, year 200 B.C. Ailat in Athens, and Talia in Cairo. Both working for the same thing. They taught children most of all in hopes that they would become parents.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Even further back to 4,010 B.C. Talia and Ailat are children of ten years. They were on a ship bound for a new home. Their old home was going to be gone. Them and many others like them. Their mother had put them into cryo tubes. A note reading: Help those that you can to become what they dream. Ailat and Talia were ment to go to different worlds but Ailat slipped out and went to Talia&#39;s tube. They were sisters, and intended to stay together. At least 150 other species would head to earth, and millions to other worlds. Their cryo pod launched and headed to earth. A map was on the note. Five years later they land on earth. Their they are taken in by the Pharaoh of Egypt and taught everything they can, while teaching what they could as well. The pod they were in, it became a mobile land mass when combined with the others. The land mass later became Atlantis. Hidden from all view, even the Atlantians. When it formed was when they decided to teach others about technology.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
Talia ran, realized the way to save all the kats was given to them. The numbers were great but Atlantis wasn&#39;t complete just yet. They would have to gather the pods. Shi knew that. And in order to do so, shi would have to have Ailat&#39;s help. Shi smiled as shi stopped and found hir sister, frozen in ice, but not just Ailat. Two of their long time friends. Crucho and Marosa. Both sisters and both would come with as well. Talia smiled as shi would look. &quot;Okay, look, we have to thaw them out, but first get them to the meeting place. Does anyone have a way to contact the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do.&quot; Janace smiled. &quot;Can anyone hear me?&quot; Shi got a response. &quot;Where are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Atlantis, Janace, go towards Mt Erebus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got ya. We&#39;re on our way.&quot; They looked and knew the only way to get them out would be to dig, fortunately it was nothing but snow up top and they had food and water, and a warm place until they got them out.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------<br />
<br />
It was a whole week before Janace, Talia and Anubis had the large ice chunk out. They decided that with Talia pregent, shi would not pull, but strapped Janace and Anubis and they started pulling. Fortunately this came rather easy, unless you count the twelve times they had to clear build up snow in front of their giant ice cube. However it still was rather easy. They followed the smoke for Erebus, using it as a sign. Talia looked &quot;What about the plane?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, if where the other three are is Atlantis, then we just need to keep going.&quot; Janace smiled. &quot;The plane can just stay here for all I care. I&#39;m never coming back.&quot; Shi giggled pulling. Talia decided that to make it faster shi&#39;d grab a rope and pull hirself. It was hir sister after all. Eventually they managed to make it. When they did they spotted a whole new problem. The ground ahead was no longer ice. The ground met with Atlantis and became rock. How would they pull it then.&quot; <br />
<br />
Midnight was waiting but stopped. &quot;Hmm... Oh yeah.&quot; Shi looked and spotted Christopher. &quot;Chris, can you come here.&quot; Shi grabbed a beam and Chris grabbed the other end. &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll put this here.&quot; Shi said. The two then ran and got what looked like wheels and put on each end. Janace, Anubis, and Talia then pulled it onto the beam.<br />
<br />
Midnight and Chris went to get another as Sammy and Gloria arrived. &quot;How can we help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Grab a beam and put it behind the giant cube.&quot; They put another in front as Sammy and Gloria did so. In time they had the cube in the center as Chris looked. &quot;Okay, time to go steer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Steer?&quot; Janace asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this island is on a track that is the Fault lines. If I&#39;m not mistaken we should be able to reach Miami by morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, I think he means by Morning in three weeks.&quot; Gloria said as Chris went and vanished in a hole. Soon they island was moving away from Antarctica.Soon as it did however, to their surprise the ice became steam, revealing rocks. Note, this is the area in a fifty mile radius of Antarctica, not the whole continent.<br />
<br />
Chris smiled. &quot;Why not we go to LA. It&#39;s closer Plus, it&#39;s the only direction we can go right now.&quot; His voice came.<br />
<br />
----------------------------<br />
<br />
The journey took longer than they thought. They were just one hundred miles from Los Angeles and Midnight and Talia were laying down on the island. This had taken a lot out of the two of them. Midnight knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before they&#39;d have their little ones.<br />
<br />
Janace smiled. &quot;You know, a lot&#39;s happened in the past few weeks. Your sister is about to become queen of France, you about to become mom, and Talia is going to be reunited with not only hir sister, but a couple of hir friends as well.&quot; Janace smiled.<br />
<br />
The ice having melted some on the three. As they other two were relaxing, Sammy received a call. &quot;Sammy, it&#39;s me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this is a....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No time. Look, we are low on staff, do you think you can come back to Sydney to help in the zoo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t explain, but you may wanna bring either Snowy or Maurice. Perhaps they can explain.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, once I get back I&#39;ll talk to them.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shi looked over as Midnight sat up. &quot;What is it? Another outbreak?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, just something&#39;s up at the zoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia looked. &quot;Can you call him, or her, or hir back and ask...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Shi made a phone call and smiled. &quot;Hey, do you know the source?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s some kind of weird machine, I&#39;ve seen only two, one here and one at the big rock thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Got ya. Can you send me a picture?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly.&quot;<br />
<br />
In moments shi recieved the picture as Talia smiled. &quot;Hon, that&#39;s a piece of Atlantis, when all the pieces are assembled, they make an ark. An Ark that can take us kats to a new world where we&#39;ll be welcomed freely.&quot;<br />
<br />
Midnight smiled. &quot;So the hunt for this giant puzzle&#39;s pieces begins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got it.&quot; Talia smiled as they soon arrived in L.A. Chris stopped outside the city where all could care less. Talia then instructed that there should be a cloaking switch that will enable only those on board to see.<br />
<br />
As they got ready to find a truck for the ice cube, it had already melted. The Sphinx coughed up water and breathed as Talia ran to hir. &quot;Ailat.&quot; Shi hugged and hir two friends joined in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Talia.&quot; All three chimed.<br />
<br />
They had decided that for the best, the four would fly, with Midnight making five. All Five had a pair of wings, the other two were Racoonkat and Foxkat like sphinx. Chris, Janace, Anubis, Sammy and Gloria decided to go by train and eventually the team was home finally.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once everyone was home, Talia called for a meeting, Talia explained that once the outbreaks are done, there is a new matter to resolve. Everyone involved in the outbreaks were all there. And to make sure they weren&#39;t planning Timothy breaking hir agreement, so was the council of the state of Colorado.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, listen, we have to expend all resources we can to end the threat of outbreaks.&quot; Talia began. &quot;For we have a new mission on our plates with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raul looked. &quot;Talia, what are you saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What shi&#39;s saying is, my sister and I aren&#39;t from this world. As are our friends. We are from another world. We came here to teach yours what we know. Now that the potential threat of Kats over populating your world is eminent, I will say this. We need to find the pods that brought us here. Various places that outbreaks have hit, and some that haven&#39;t, are locations of our pods. They are pieces to an ark that can take us to a new world large enough for our population to grow beyond what earth has. We will still keep some kats here, but your families will go as will you should you choose. You won&#39;t be forced to leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia then turned her attention toe the Colorado State Council. &quot;Look, I wasn&#39;t kidding that we need to expend all resources, and Timothy is one of those resources. Is there a way you could let him use the aiding in future outbreaks as community service to pay for hir fines?&quot;<br />
<br />
The council spoke and looked at hir. &quot;Look, he... er excuse me, shi committed a crime against the state.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janace looked. &quot;That wasn&#39;t hir fault, it was mine. It&#39;s what I said to hir that made hir do what shi did. We all make errors. Shi&#39;s under those rules until hir fines are paid, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s correct, Miss....?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janace, Janace Cain, I&#39;m surprised you forgot an old partner James. Should I remind the council of what crime you and your partner did to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No ma&#39;am.&quot; He shook his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Now I have the funds to cover all hir fines. And will pay them in full right now.&quot; Shi looked and took out a check book and wrote the check. &quot;Here.&quot; Shi handed it to the council who looked it over.<br />
<br />
They looked at Timothy. &quot;Well, Mr. Chakat, consider yourself a free kat. All charges are done and paid in full.&quot;<br />
<br />
The council left considering they had no real reason to be there anymore as Janace sat beside Anubis and smiled.<br />
<br />
Talia continued talking of hir plans to find these parts. &quot;We already know where two are. They are in Austrailia, one at the zoo in Sidney, and the other is Uluru. Austrailia&#39;s big rock formation in the Norther Territories.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could it be possible that these formed islands too?&quot; Charlie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. There is a large potential they did. That is why you have many theories of Atlantis.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris looked over. &quot;I think I may have an idea where two more are, but I&#39;ll have to be gone for a few weeks to find out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Talia smiled. &quot;Alright, Chris, in fact search all waters you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you. Christine, you coming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You bet your sweet slippery ass.&quot; The two left as Talia finished up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, keep an eye out for them when you&#39;re doing your outbreak missions. Atlantis is outside LA right now.  It&#39;s cloaked so no one can get to it and use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
That closed the meeting and all went off in their own direction.</p>
