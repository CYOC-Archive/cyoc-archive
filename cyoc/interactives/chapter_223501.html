<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus, panic rising, pleaded with Dennis to hand over the gel, fearing the consequences of tampering with his age. But Dennis, wearing a mischievous grin, had other plans. He swiftly pulled off his shirt, revealing his thin frame, and in a daring move, he decided to ingest the gel rather than apply it externally, believing it would work faster this way.<br />
<br />
As the viscous substance slid down Dennis&#39;s throat, an incredible transformation began before the eyes of the group. His body seemed to pulsate with newfound energy, and his muscles expanded rapidly. First, his arms bulged with strength, veins coursing across them like rivers of power. His chest broadened, and his abdomen tightened into a chiseled six-pack. Each of his legs grew thicker and more defined, and his height shot up dramatically.<br />
<br />
Dennis, once a lanky 15-year-old just past 5&#39;4&quot;, now transformed into a hulking, muscular 23-year-old man standing at a towering 6&#39;4&quot;. His skin glistened with sweat as his body underwent this astonishing metamorphosis, and he radiated an aura of confidence and power that was impossible to ignore. Marcus and Oliver stared in awe, their eyes wide with shock at the incredible change that had taken place right before them.<br />
<br />
Dennis, now the physical embodiment of strength and maturity, looked down at Marcus with a smirk. &quot;Well, Marcus, looks like I&#39;ve upgraded a bit. Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ll be sure to make good use of these extra years. Maybe I&#39;ll see you in a few years when you catch up, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus stood there, his mouth agape in shock and disbelief. He couldn&#39;t fathom what Dennis had just done, nor could he grasp the fact that his brother&#39;s friend now loomed over him like a towering giant, his body transformed into that of a seasoned bodybuilder. It was as if Dennis had stolen not only the container of years but also Marcus&#39;s very identity, leaving him feeling small and powerless.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dennis, you... you can&#39;t just do this!&quot; Marcus stammered, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and anger. He took a step closer to his now-much-taller friend, but he felt utterly dwarfed by Dennis&#39;s newfound stature.<br />
<br />
Dennis, however, seemed more enamored with his own transformation than concerned with Marcus&#39;s protests. He flexed his newly bulging biceps, admiring the impressive definition in the mirror-like surface of his muscles. A deep, resonant voice rumbled from his throat as he spoke, reveling in the newfound power of his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, this is incredible!&quot; Dennis exclaimed, his eyes locked on his own reflection. &quot;I mean, look at these muscles! And this voice! I sound like a freaking man now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus&#39;s frustration grew as Dennis continued to marvel at his own physique and voice. &quot;Dennis, this isn&#39;t right!&quot; Marcus insisted, his voice gaining some strength despite the overwhelming circumstances. &quot;You need to fix this. You can&#39;t just take my years and become... this!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis finally tore his gaze away from his reflection and turned his attention to Marcus. He grinned smugly, flexing his newly acquired muscles once more as if to emphasize his point. &quot;Why would I want to fix it, Marcus? I mean, seriously, I&#39;m a man now! Look at me, and look at you.&quot; He looked down at Marcus, who felt smaller than ever. &quot;I&#39;m in charge here, buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. Dennis, his brother&#39;s friend, had taken advantage of the situation in the most audacious way possible. &quot;Dennis, you can&#39;t just decide to become an adult like this. It&#39;s not right,&quot; Marcus protested, his voice filled with desperation.<br />
<br />
Dennis took a step closer to Marcus, his height advantage more pronounced than ever. He flexed his muscles once more, making his point clear. &quot;You know, Marcus, you shouldn&#39;t have used that machine if you didn&#39;t want to be a little kid again. But you did, and now I&#39;m a freaking man!&quot; He chuckled, reveling in the deep, confident sound of his own laughter.<br />
<br />
Marcus&#39;s frustration turned to anger. He had never felt so powerless in his life, and Dennis was thoroughly enjoying every moment of it. &quot;Dennis, you have to understand that this isn&#39;t fair,&quot; Marcus implored, his eyes welling up with tears. &quot;I just wanted to play a game, not give away my years to become a kid again. You have to give them back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis shook his head, his new, imposing physique making him look even more resolute. &quot;Sorry, Marcus, but that&#39;s not gonna happen. I like being a man, and I&#39;m not about to give it up.”<br />
<br />
Dennis couldn&#39;t contain his excitement as he bounded back into the house. His newfound physical prowess was intoxicating, and he couldn&#39;t wait to explore it further. With each step, his larger, more muscular frame seemed to fill the space around him, and his voice resonated with a newfound confidence.<br />
<br />
He rushed up the stairs to Marcus&#39;s room, eager to get a better look at himself in the mirror. Once inside, he wasted no time in stripping down to his boxers, which he now found a snug but perfect fit for his enhanced physique. He admired himself in the mirror, flexing his bulging biceps and tracing the definition of his newly acquired muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; Dennis muttered to himself, a cocky grin spreading across his face. &quot;I look incredible.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reflection staring back at him was indeed that of a powerful, confident young man. His chest was broad and sculpted, his abs chiseled, and his arms looked like they belonged to a professional athlete. Dennis couldn&#39;t help but feel a surge of pride as he took in his new appearance.<br />
<br />
He turned away from the mirror and spotted Marcus&#39;s dresser. Curiosity got the better of him, and he decided to check out what kind of clothes Marcus had. He opened a drawer and found a pair of boxers that caught his eye. They were snug, just the way he liked them, and he decided they were a better fit for his newly muscular frame than his old ones.<br />
<br />
Dennis slipped into the boxers and felt an immediate sense of comfort. It was as if they were tailor-made for him. He smirked, thinking how much he liked Marcus&#39;s taste in underwear.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, Marcus and Oliver were still reeling from the shocking turn of events. They watched in disbelief as Dennis strutted into the living room, shirtless and exuding an air of newfound authority. Marcus couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of envy and resentment as he saw his friend flaunting his transformed body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dennis, this isn&#39;t right,&quot; Marcus protested once more, trying to regain some control over the situation. &quot;You can&#39;t just take my years and act like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis, standing taller and more imposing than ever, crossed his arms and regarded Marcus with a condescending smile. &quot;Marcus, you gave them to me fair and square,&quot; he replied, his voice dripping with confidence. &quot;And now I&#39;m the one in charge here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver, who had been silent until now, chimed in. &quot;Dennis, come on, man, this is going too far,&quot; he said, his voice tinged with concern. &quot;We were just playing a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis turned his attention to Oliver, his newfound dominance extending to him as well. &quot;Oliver, you saw what happened. I won fair and square,&quot; he declared, flexing his muscles for emphasis. &quot;I&#39;m not a kid anymore, and I&#39;m not about to give up being a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus couldn&#39;t believe how quickly things had spiraled out of control. Dennis, once a friend and an equal, now seemed like an entirely different person. His arrogance and newfound physicality made Marcus feel smaller and more vulnerable than ever.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dennis, please,&quot; Marcus pleaded, his voice quivering with frustration. &quot;You have to give me back my years. This isn&#39;t right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis approached Marcus, his imposing presence casting a long shadow over him. He placed a hand on Marcus&#39;s shoulder, but it was no longer a gesture of friendship. It felt more like a reminder of his newfound dominance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Marcus,&quot; Dennis said in a patronizing tone, &quot;you made your choice when you used that machine. You wanted to be a kid again, and now you are. I, on the other hand, wanted to become a man, and look at me now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver, still trying to mediate the situation, spoke up. &quot;There has to be a way to reverse this, Dennis. We can&#39;t just leave things like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dennis shook his head, his confidence unwavering. &quot;I&#39;m not giving up this body,&quot; he stated firmly. &quot;I&#39;ve got strength, confidence, and a whole new future ahead of me. And I plan to make the most of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Dennis continued to assert his newfound authority, Marcus and Oliver exchanged worried glances. It seemed that their friend had changed in more ways than one, and they were left grappling with the consequences of a game that had spiraled out of control.</p>
