<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">     Some sort of monk. Wearing intricate dark green robes that stood out against the crimson red of the fleshy breeding pits, the monk was left undisturbed by the tendrils around him. Instead, the monk continued to grin at Varron.<br />
<br />
    Whoever this was, they must be the cause of all this chaos, causing a loyal slave to be unfucked. How else would Vaimrol continue to produce it’s unholy army? Every second that he was left undrained of his semen was another second wasted in the breeding process. The tendrils seemed to still be fully functioning, so somehow this stranger had either persuaded or enchanted the tendrils to leaving the both of them alone.<br />
<br />
Varron wasn’t quite sure what to do, there was no way down from his station to the floor of the breeding pits, and after a millennia breeding he wasn’t exactly practiced at his magic anymore. Which didn’t bother him as much as it should have, after all, why would a breeding slave need magic anyways?<br />
<br />
None of the other slaves seemed to notice the stranger, although that in itself was hardly unusual, even when one of the Demonlords visited to entertain themselves with one of the slaves, the others hardly noticed. They were all far too busy being fucked through every opening to care about anything else.<br />
<br />
“Who—ahem—- areee youu?” Varron rasped, having to clear his throat, his voice crusty after centuries of not needing to speak. It was a wonder Varron even remembered how to, something that did slightly disappoint him.<br />
<br />
Varron heard the intruder give a soft chuckle, which only served to increase Varron’s irritation.<br />
<br />
Just as the hyena was about to speak again, he saw the stranger in robes suddenly stand still for a mere moment, before, as if being pulled by strings, began to rise up into the air. His movements were jerky and sudden, yet the robed stranger gave no signs of visual discomfort as he rose up to meet Varron on his balcony.<br />
<br />
Varron, confused and on guard immediately back stepped away from the balcony opening, baring his teeth and claws as he watched the figure gently land on the fleshy railings of the balcony.<br />
<br />
“Varron Ethera… yes I believe that is your name… please excuse me for the sudden and most undoubtedly surprising visit, but I wish to speak to you.” The stranger said in a strange voice, their voice oddly almost hollow and airy, as if they were somehow speaking through a flute.<br />
<br />
Ethera… that did spark a vague light of memory within Varron’s mind, but he paid no attention as he stared down the stranger, watching with his claws ready as the stranger unveiled his face to reveal the face of a demon, reptilian in nature, with a multitude of horn like protrusions sticking out from both his head and jaw. <br />
<br />
The demonic nature of this stranger did at the very least comfort Varron, he relaxed his stance, if only slightly, still on guard but more calm now as Varron spoke.<br />
<br />
“I hope you have a good reason for interrupting my duties, I’d imagine by now at least three fertile women could have been bred by now.” Varron huffed with annoyance at the reptile.<br />
<br />
“Ah… yes… I can see how that would concern you, but I have different matters I must attend to with you. Not that you asked, but you may simply refer to me as a Conduit.” The reptile replied.<br />
<br />
Conduit, another name for a demon that has forsaken all personal free will and identity in service of a higher power, usually a demon lord. Most often acting as their dark priests, or in some cases direct vessels. So Varron was speaking to a member of the clergy then… Varron was slightly disappointed in himself for knowing this, after all this time he had hoped that all knowledge he had prior to his corruption would have been fucked out of him, yet strangely even after all these years some things still seemed to stick in his mind.<br />
<br />
“And who are you a Conduit of? And what matters do you speak of? Speak reptile, you may rank higher than me but disrupting the breeding process without good reason is a high crime to all of demonkind.”<br />
<br />
The Conduit chuckled at Varron, which only served to annoy the hyena further. “Yes, yes, yes, forgive me, I’ve forgotten how ah… impatient your kind are like. Very well, I shall get straight to the point. Dear Varron, demon of the breeding pits, my master is Ziroth… God of Evil.” The Conduit waited for Varron’s reaction, which was nearly instantaneous.<br />
<br />
In an enraged howl, the Hyena lunged at the reptillian demon, claws aimed at the Conduit’s neck, ready to kill. Yet instead of sinking into the Conduit’s flesh, Varron instead collided with a sudden wall of pure mana, tinged with a deep crimson red. The Conduit stood on the other side of the see through mana wall, clearly amused at Varron’s actions.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Traitor! Traitor to all of demonkind! Why have you shown your reviled face in these corrupted pits of carnal depravity! Worm back into the unknown pits in which your cowardly fool of a god lurks!” Varron screeched, clawing at the mana barrier like a maddened cat.<br />
<br />
“Yes, as expected of you… ah, Varron, you must understand, that this is an incredibly difficult situation for both of us. Normally, I simply would have plucked you out of your little breeding pit and used you as I saw fit, but this particular situation requires a bit more… open ended honesty…” The Conduit said with a hint of disgust at that last part.<br />
<br />
“If you think I will willingly aid you, then you must be as much of a fool as your god! How could any demon ever willingly aid you ever since your ilk betrayed the very darkness itself? Betrayed the god of darkness in all his majesty?” Varron hissed, his voice raw with rage.<br />
<br />
“I know my masters… sudden departure and lack of aid towards the god of darkness’s goals was a… controversial decision indeed, but I assure you my master did everything he did for a reason… and that reason is simple… balance…”<br />
<br />
“Balance? Balance?!? What is your master one of those extinct druids from long ago? Preaching about the virtues of moderation and inner peace? About the divide between mankind and nature? Be real, your master is a simple betrayer, it is in his nature to betray and deceive, all whilst maintaining the illusion of a guise that he does it all with some grand master plan in mind.” ranted Varron. He was trying to enrage the Conduit, very aware that the god of evil was most likely listening through his Conduit, yet Varron’s insults had no effect on the reptile at all.<br />
<br />
“You’re partially correct there… but Varron, consider this… this world… all of it, has been corrupted. Every single inch has been infused with darkness and sin, there is no goodness here, all have fallen into the deepest pits of depravity imaginable… so tell me… what is the point of corruption if there is nothing else to corrupt?”<br />
<br />
“I… I don’t follow…” Varron said, unable to lash out with another insult or retort as the Conduit’s question had thoroughly confused him.<br />
<br />
The Conduit sighed “You haven’t seen the outside of these pits in quite a long while have you? Likely not since your original corruption. Here, hilariously enough, is the safest place you can ever be in this world. The world has become too saturated with evil, there are no paladins to fall from grace, no mortals to tempt and seduce, and little light to create shadow. Outside of these fleshy pits is nothing but a self destroying chaotic world, goodness has already been wiped out, and with it, evil will have no choice but to destroy itself, leaving nothing, do you understand Varron? The tiny amount of light this world receives is only barely keeping us afloat. Like a snake that has run out of food, all it can do is to begin consuming itself. Without goodness, evil is doomed.” The Conduit explained.<br />
<br />
“And? So what of it? Let our self destruction come! Let us be devoured by our own darkness and depravity! If that is what must be done to create a world where all light has been purged from existence so be it!” Varron snarled angrily. This Conduit truly was a madman. They claimed they were the servant of Evil and yet here they were suggesting that the light should be brought back? Infuriating, if Varron could, he would have torn out their scaled throat by now, but instead all he could do was leer through the mana barrier, shooting daggers at the reptilian who only sighed at his response.<br />
<br />
“Disappointingly expected, but I suppose one should not fault one for obeying their nature. Nevertheless though, my master has stated that you are critical in restoring balance to this world, have no choice but to… persuade… you in another way…” The Conduit trailed off.</p>
