<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel woke up like he usually did, doing his morning routine. while watching the morning news he realized something was off, normally there would be a woman doing the morning news cast. As Gabriel watched the news to figure out what was going on the news anchor then ask his partner what was the likely hood of encountering of a parasite to work was, the other anchor said that there was a high likely hood of many guys getting a succubi tail attached to them and becoming succubi. Gabriel after hearing this then went to check the info using his cell.<br />
<br />
Gabriel quickly found that there wasn&#39;t any female humans only male humans and that the succubi tail was the only way for human men to continue to be born. Reading more on it Gabriel found that only once every year there was a large scale invasion of the parasitic tail and that once men are infected, they will be quickly taken by a special police unit to the Succubi city nearby. Men can come and go to the Succubi city freely in order to have sex with the Succubi and attempt to have her bear a child, apparently succubi need to be filled with cum atleast 10 times in order to bear one male human child.<br />
<br />
The Succubi city is of course domed, to prevent the succubi from leaving and raping men. Thankfully it seemed that the Succubi has created their own society in the dome and have accepted what they became, further more it seemed they made it so that only one of them will give birth to the parasitic tails, in order to prevent all of the men becoming succubi. Succubi still gave birth to a tail every so often, which is why there was a danger report every morning, but the Succubi have a ritual of selecting one Succubus to give birth to the tails that will make up the yearly invasion of the human city.<br />
<br />
Gabriel further read up on Succubi biology and found that men knew nothing on them other then they are immune to diseases and can live up to 200 years, which is why men try to have as many children as they can with as many succubi as they can to even things out.<br />
<br />
Gabriel finished his reading and prepared himself to avoid the tails as best as he can. Gabriel made it to the bus stop without incident, the bus was one time for once so he quickly hopped on. He found an empty seat and took it, he was halfway to work in the bus when his luck ran out and he felt a sharp pinching sensations on his ass. Gabriel did his best not to panic and hoped it was nothing but his imagination. He made it to his stop and got out, with nobody saying anything as he did he felt that the pinching sensation was indeed his mind playing tricks on him. That thought disappeared as he made it into the reception area of the office building he worked in and made his way into an elevator to get to his floor. <br />
<br />
The moment Gabriel felt his shoulders bump into the other passengers, his body gave a pleasurable shudder. His hope of not being infected quickly disappeared as his short hair lengthen, starting to get in the way of his eyes. The other guys in the elevator quickly ran out as soon as the doors opened and called security. Gabriel&#39;s body felt hot and he felt like he was hit by the worst cold imaginable. He was very delirious and didn&#39;t notice when security came and carted him off. When he was lucid he found his head resting on the lap of a lilac skinned Succubus, who was 5&#39;4&quot; with DD-cup breasts, thick thighs, a pudgy middle, black ass length hair, glowing hot pink slitted eyes, thin 3 inch black horns that came out straight from her temples, small black bat like wings coming out of her lower back, a cute heart shape ass, and just above it a short thin black smooth tail ending in a flat 5 pointed star.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there young one, my name&#39;s Chelsie, I&#39;m going to be your caretaker and help you during your transformation, as well as after.&quot; <br />
Gabriel felt his body still burning when Chelsie said &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see if the tail consumes your lower half and turn you into a Lamia Succubus.&quot; &quot;huh, what&quot; Gabriel moaned out. &quot;oh ya, you men don&#39;t know. The tail can consume your lower-half and turn you into a Succubus-Lamia or is it Lamia-Succubus, well it doesn&#39;t matter I just can&#39;t wait to see what you look like/what type/kind of succubus you turn into. OH I know if you become an Amazonian type I will introduce you to the mayor.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Anna come and put his dick to use before it disappears!&quot; Gabriel heard Chelsie yell, he then saw a succubus that looked like she was 16 with pink skin, white ram horns, and shoulder length black hair. Gabriel saw Anna make her way to his crotch, she then went on all fours and began sucking his cock. Gabriel came within a few seconds. Anna with his cock in her mouth said &quot;ddddoommmm&#39;t wwwwoorrrmmmry i&#39;lllmmml keeemmppp mplamying wimmmth yourmmm crommmmtttch eveennmmm ammmmfter immmmt turmmmms immmmto ammm pummssy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel felt his body began to change, he wondered what he would look like as a succubus/what kind/type of succubus he becomes.</p>
