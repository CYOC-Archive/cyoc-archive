<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle hobbled over to the dresser. His ass bounced heavily behind him, his thighs slapping together with each step. Pushing his massive cock out of the way, he dug through the drawers. Nothing was where he remembered it being. He couldn&#39;t find his pants. All he could find were torn short shorts, old leggings with massive gashes in the inner thighs, and what at one point was probably underwear, reduced to but a stretched string of fabric. He blushed at the idea of going entirely nude from the waist down, so he had to wear something.<br />
<br />
Pulling one of the thongs out, he held it in front of him. It was loose, and hanging on by a literal thread. He leaned over, barely able to reach his hoof. Lifting it up to get one side on, he almost fell as his weight shifted onto his other hoof. Catching himself, he tried again, and again. The last thing he wanted to do with his new body was fall, even with all of his new cushioning, but on the fourth attempt he managed to get it under his hoof. He repeated it with his other leg, catching himself on his dresser once. His hip dug into it painfully before he managed to right himself, heart racing from the exertion. All of his new fat shook and rippled behind him for a few seconds. He sighed, fighting back tears, and started pulling the thong up. It caught on his knees, so he leaned back to pull it up a bit. He felt it rub along his thighs, clearly a bit too tight. His hips almost caused it to snap, especially when he had to dig it from under his ass cheek. He sighed from relief, sweat beading down his brow. He was breathing heavily from this workout, to his embarrassment.<br />
<br />
The thong dug in uncomfortably between his cheeks and on the left side of his crotch. He felt it pull up a bit on his ass crack, and looked behind him in the mirror. To his surprise, he felt pleased, and gave his ass a slap. In the back of his mind he was screaming.<br />
<br />
He then hobbled back over to his dresser, finding his upperwear similarly changed. He had plenty of crop tops now, and even some sports bras. He didn&#39;t question it at this point. His instinct guided him towards a fishnet undershirt and a pink crop-top hoodie. Looking in the mirror, he felt cute. His hair was a bit longer. He caught himself thinking of tying it off, but he settled on a beanie instead. He pushed his way into the bathroom. There, instinct guided him once more. Shoving his hyper cock between his thighs and the sink, he pinned it down so he could see in the mirror. It hurt, and his sheath felt strained, but he told himself he didn&#39;t have to hold it like that for long. Opening the medicine cabinet, he pulled out some makeup and a bottle of nail polish. &quot;Where the hell did I get this?&quot; he thought as old Kyle pushed through, but he shrugged it off. He settled for a bit of eyeliner and some black nail polish. Now he really felt cute, though he couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Being a scrawny nerd, he&#39;d always been insecure about his masculinity, but seeing himself completely forgo it... as liberating as it felt to him now, part of him couldn&#39;t believe what he was doing.<br />
<br />
He pushed back through the door into his bedroom, his hips catching on both sides. It stung a bit, but he was used to it. He heaved his way into the hallway and down it, to the kitchen, where his mom was waiting. He waddled over to the counter, once again pushing his cock out of the way to grab a bowl and some cereal. He had to push it over with one hand while leaning the other way to see what he was doing directly ahead of him, much to his early-morning disgruntlement. His mom appeared next to him. &quot;Have a good day, sweetie,&quot; she said while he was pouring cereal out, and she gave him a kiss on his forehead, and patted his ass a little. It wasn&#39;t sexual, he knew, and he was embarrassed as his cock stirred a bit in front of him. No way to hide it. She didn&#39;t seem to notice as she turned around and grabbed her keys. &quot;Byeeee, Mom!&quot; he called out as she left, struck by how effeminate he sounded. His voice felt a bit higher. He noticed as he poured the cereal out that his arm hair had thinned considerably, and he remembered he didn&#39;t feel the need to shave this morning, either. Even as a natural blond, he&#39;d still had to do that at least every few days. Not anymore, apparently.<br />
<br />
He grabbed some strawberries from the fridge and added them to his cereal, taking two seats to sit down at the table. They groaned under his new weight. His balls rested on the ground, and his cock pushed out ahead of him. He sighed, pushing it out of the way again. It was getting annoying already. Just as he settled down to eat, he heard a series of loud honks, clearly meant for him, right before Jarred charged his way into Kyle&#39;s kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEYYY KYLIE!&quot; he beamed. &quot;Wow, you look great!&quot; he said, pouncing on the poor nerd-turned-hyper-femboy. His keys dug into Kyle&#39;s expansive hips as he was hugged, leaving a mark. Letting go, Jarred stepped back, hands on his hips. &quot;My curse really did a number on you, huh?&quot; he said. His keys dangled off his belt loop. What has gotten into him? Kyle found himself staring at Jarred, trying to sort out what he was thinking. Part of him wanted to punch him, part of him wanted to sit on him, and part of him wanted to get fucked by him. A large part of him. Kyle shook his head. Why was Jarred so... masc all of a sudden? Still clearly a nerd, it&#39;s like he&#39;d gotten a second wind on being a human being.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, you spilled something on you,&quot; he said, grabbing a napkin and dabbling at the exposed base of Kyle&#39;s sheath. Sure enough, there was some milk along it. Kyle blushed. &quot;You&#39;ve got to watch out! And you put on a thong! Just for me, or?&quot; he said, excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-uh...n-no, I just didn&#39;t th-didn&#39;t want to be naked, that&#39;s all!&quot; Kyle said nervously. Jarred pulled on it and let go. It snapped loudly against Kyle&#39;s ass, causing him to yelp. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be in my truck when you&#39;re done feeding this thing,&quot; he said, and blew a kiss towards Kyle. It took him a few seconds to realize it wasn&#39;t towards him, but towards his cock, which had engorged slightly. Not enough blood to supply it even now, he&#39;d never been able to get hard, he remembered. Only heavier, as it sagged. He pushed back from the chairs, as it sagged forward and pulled even heavier on his torso. He tossed his dishes in the sink and threw his backpack on. He waddled as fast as he could to Jarred&#39;s pickup, his cock swinging ahead of him like a limp, 200 lb battering ram. Clambering into the back, the suspension sagged. He knelt down, surprised by how much padding his knees now had, and sat back onto the cushion of his balls and ass. His cock was pinned underneath him, unable to harden further. He stuck his head through the opening in the rear window. Not before noticing the two kissing stags sticker on it. What the hell was going on? Didn&#39;t he drive a compact?<br />
<br />
&quot;Did... did the curse, like, change you, too?&quot; Kyle asked. &quot;You&#39;re different than I remember.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, yeah, well, apparently changing the world like that has some... knock-on effects,&quot; Jarred explained as they got going. Every little bump jostled Kyle&#39;s exposed rear, but he tried to ignore it. &quot;For instance, when I said for you to be my dream guy, the curse took it a bit further. I have two sets of memories, before and after, and in this universe... we&#39;ve been together for a few years. How<br />
 that changes things, haha,&quot; he said, laughing a bit to himself. &quot;I&#39;d been one of your... loner types before, I guess? I don&#39;t miss that at all. But seeing as we&#39;re totally different people now, from that universe-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-But we&#39;re not, I&#39;m not!&quot; Kyle interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you?&quot; Jarred asked, looking at him in the mirror. &quot;The Kyle we both knew would have balked at makeup, torn what you&#39;re wearing off the second it was put on. He was a gross, greasy nerd, with too many band t-shirts and not enough deodorant. Is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle sniffed his pits. Strawberries. It was not.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, neither is that me, here. I guess a few more years of social interaction got me in tune with a different side of myself. We&#39;re both better off, and all because I got a bit jealous back there. Sorry about that, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll grow to like it.&quot; Kyle wasn&#39;t so sure, but he kept his mouth shut. &quot;Anyway, we&#39;re here!&quot;<br />
<br />
They pulled up into the parking lot. The truck lurched to a stop, sending waves through Kyle&#39;s hips. He clambered out as gracefully as he could, which was not very with this cumbersome body. He could have sworn he heard the truck sigh in relief as his hooves clacked onto solid ground. His tail tossed back and forth as a familiar jolt went through his lower half, and he was reminded of his new life. 3 more inches, and a bit more growth on his hips. Was he a hair taller, too, or was he just imagining that? No matter, as Jarred handed him his backpack, and the two set off into the school building. Not before finding the wheelchair ramp, since there was no way Kyle was navigating stairs with his new body.</p>
