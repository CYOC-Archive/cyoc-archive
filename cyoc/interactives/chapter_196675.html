<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steven had been living on the crown of the massive tree for months now. He was stung by a bee back home and the next thing he remembered was sleeping on a huge leaf.<br />
<br />
On one side of the tree he had his little hut on a branch. It was built for him by...anthropomorphic bees which lived on the inside of the tree. <br />
<br />
Back in his world he loved bugs and even was a beekeeper for a while before his colony caught a disease, so seeing these bee-people flying around was one of the most exciting days of his life. <br />
<br />
Sometimes he wished he could bee one of them. (yes he was hilarious.) He wanted to fly, to smell with hypersensitive antennae, build things with four hands and be a fluffy bug-person. <br />
<br />
To the Bees he was a rare curiosity and most of his first month here was spend exchanging information for food and shelter. <br />
<br />
The colony had took a liking to him and he even made friends with the queen and a male called Bark. <br />
<br />
Poor Bark had apparently not gotten to mate last breeding season and now he was the only other man here as all his friends left to build new hives. Some offered to take him in as a secondary male for their harems but Bark didn&#39;t want to only be there to spice up someone else&#39;s sex-life or to be pitied. So now Bark was waiting here, on this mountain of a tree, for the next time all the reproductives would have their passionate day.<br />
<br />
That would be in 4 years. <br />
<br />
Steven understood how it was to feel lonely so when the lone male told him his story Steven offered him friendship which was greedily taken and cherished by the Bee. They grew closer over the months till eventually Bark would hug and cuddle him and as strange as it may sound they even slept in the same bed. <br />
<br />
The thing was, while Steven was bisexual and definitely felt something for Bark, the Bee was actually fully straight. <br />
<br />
For Bee-people, regardless of gender, it was normal to cuddle and even sleep in the same bed as their best friend. It didn&#39;t have any connotations. <br />
<br />
He knew that he would never be loved by Bark in that way, unless a miracle happened. <br />
<br />
Steven pushed the thought into the back of his head. <br />
<br />
He was currently sitting on a branch, which was multiple meters in diameter, looking at the morning sky. <br />
<br />
It was rather cool, actually. He could see for dozens of kilometers in every direction. He saw towns and even some of the other hives in the distance. He saw rivers and lakes and what could have once been another giant tree in the distance. When he asked the Bees about it they just mumbled something about, &quot;Remember Blackwood&quot;. <br />
<br />
Soon he heard the familiar buzzing of Bark as the Bee sat down besides him, pulling him into a hug with one arm. <br />
<br />
His antennae wiggled nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot;, Steven asked. <br />
<br />
Bark tapped his foot-claws against the wood,&quot;So,...last week you told me you wanted to be a Bee...&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven nodded, asking himself where this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;What If I told you that that&#39;s a possibil-&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?! HOW?! I WANNA BE A BEE! I will do anything!&quot;, he answered <br />
<br />
Bark gulped and asked, &quot;Anything?&quot; <br />
<br />
Steven rapidly nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then I just need you to trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Bee put his upper pair of hands onto Steven&#39;s head. The Human felt a tickle as two yellow lightnings lefts the Bee&#39;s hands and entered his head. <br />
<br />
Two antennae started sprouting. Bark grabbed them and coaxed them to grow till they reached full size. Being touched by him like that made him tremble. <br />
<br />
Steven moved his new antennae downwards so he could see them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, look how they wiggle! I love them already.&quot;, Steven exclaimed. &#39;Its really happening!&#39; <br />
<br />
But as Bark once again touched Steven&#39;s new appendages he started to feel a deeply satisfying, soothing feeling spread through his body. It was like nothing he ever felt before. He metaphorically melted into Bark&#39;s hand as that one continued to massage him. Steven closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling. <br />
<br />
The other three of Bark&#39;s hands would now start to do the actual work. <br />
<br />
Steven didn&#39;t notice as the Bee pushed in his adam&#39;s apple, making it disappear. The hands traveled down to his shoulders causing them to become less broad and more femenine. <br />
<br />
Another thing Steven didn&#39;t notice was his shirt dissolving into thin air as Bark got to his torso, reshaping it. It only felt like a massage to the blissfully unaware Steven. His waist carved in as the Bee held it. Soon another pair of arms would grow out of his side. This one though was black, yellow and chitinous with fluffy, golden fur around the wrists. <br />
<br />
Bark held his hand in from of Steven&#39;s chest, causing it to grow and rounden till Bark&#39;s hands were filled and the nipples disappeared completely . The Bee tapped his spine, causing him to arch forward, becoming more shapely in the process. <br />
<br />
Soon Steven&#39;s pants would too dissolve at Bark&#39;s touch, leaving him almost naked. <br />
<br />
The Bee continued massaging his torso into shape while Steven shut his mind off from the outside world except for the sensations in his antennae. <br />
<br />
Soon Bark touched Steven&#39;s member, causing it to slowly recede. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know that you can&#39;t really hear me right now, but I will say it anyways. Steven, you are the greatest man I have ever met. You have given me comfort, appreciation and joy...yet you yearn for me in a way I cant reciprocate...but I can change that in a direction which will hopefully satisfy both of our wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that Bark pressed Steven&#39;s privates against his crotch till all that remained was a slit which would soon also be touched and molded to Bark&#39;s desires as black chitin started covering that area. <br />
<br />
Bark put his hands a couple centimeters behind the now female Steven&#39;s butt as it too expanded to perfectly fill his hands. He gave a light squeeze eliciting a moan Steven wasn&#39;t aware of. <br />
<br />
Black chitin started covering her thighs and hips as they thickened, feminized and expanded. Steven&#39;s legs were becoming shapelier and shapelier. <br />
<br />
Steven&#39;s shoes would be the last article of clothing to go and Bark reshaped her feet into two claws each. <br />
<br />
Moving further up again Bark completed her torso. He caused the creation of a collar of more golden fur around Steven&#39;s neck which he would hopefully one day nuzzle his face in while cuddling with her on romantic nights. <br />
<br />
Next were her original arms which would soon give in under his touch. <br />
<br />
The face would be the next destination as Bark cupped her cheeks, causing her face to become rounder. Bark pushed in her nose and massaged her ears into non-existence.<br />
<br />
He pressed into her closed eyes, causing them to grow and become bug-like. <br />
<br />
Next he put a hand above her butt. Rubbing there caused a insect abdomen to develop which would grow to the size of her entire upper body under his gentle touch. <br />
<br />
Next he rubbed her back, making translucent wings, the complex patterns of which he would hopefully loose himself in for hours. <br />
<br />
He did some last, literal, finishing touches as he grabbed her hair, turning it golden and lengthening it down to her shoulder blades. And at last, he grabbed her tongue, lengthening and broadening it. <br />
<br />
And now, there she was, the most beautiful woman he had ever laid his eyes on, conforming to his desire and her wishes. <br />
<br />
Now he only had to hope for a positive reaction. Slowly he stopped massaging her antennae, bringing her back to reality <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was wond-&quot;, Steven stopped as she heard her new voice and opened her eyes, readjusting to the numerous small pictures morphing into one.<br />
<br />
She looked down and her jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
She stared at her four hands and slowly started exploring her body, touching her chest, stroking across her thighs and grabbing her own butt in complete silence, making Bark nervous. <br />
<br />
She flapped her wings and curiously looked back as she shook her abdomen. <br />
<br />
Finally she blushed through her chitin as her hands found her new sex. She got flustered even harder as she touched it, pleasure pumping through her veins. <br />
<br />
She looked up at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;I...am a Bee-person now...a female one...&quot;<br />
<br />
She melted into his touch as he put a hand on her cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bark chuckled, &quot;I always knew that you liked me both romantically and sexually. But I am a straight dude. I don&#39;t want another male&#39;s member anywhere close to my holes. So, when you told me that you wanted to be a Bee I remembered an old tome I found which would allow me to mold any Human into a form pleasing to me.<br />
<br />
So now you can both bee a Bee and bee my lover! Is that not what you always wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steven was flabbergasted. Every part of her new self was so...pretty! She had shapely legs, some divine thighs and such a fluffy chest! <br />
<br />
Four arms just ment better hugs! <br />
<br />
She spread her wings, looking at the patterns in aww. <br />
<br />
Her bug-abdomen was rather light for it&#39;s size, as if there were empty spaces, waiting to be filled with something. <br />
<br />
And her voice, oh lord! Anyone attracted to women would get instantly turned on the moment she spoke in her seductive, low tone. <br />
<br />
She realized, this beauty she was seeing, feeling and experiencing was herself! This was her beautiful new body! She felt...sexy and beautiful! A new sense of pride at herself filled her. <br />
<br />
And exchanging manhood for being a beautiful Bee-person and a chance for love she never thought could be hers was a trade she would agree to in a heartbeat. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day her new vagina would be just another hole for a shaft to enter. Sure, womanhood would probably be a journey in and off itself but still, she would get to be with Bark! <br />
<br />
&quot;THANK, YOU!&quot;,she exclaimed, hugging him and pulling him in with her four arms. She planted a deep kiss on his cheek as her antennae were basically punching his into submission. Her legs crossed each other behind his back, encasing him as she looked into his eyes.  Pheromones indicating both of their needs spread through the air. <br />
<br />
Now it was Bark&#39;s time to be surprised. <br />
<br />
&quot;You...are taking this much better than I thought you would.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck, dude. You just gave me everything I wanted and more!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was time to use her new, seductive tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let us go back to my place.&quot;,she purred into his antennae. <br />
<br />
He agreed as she stood up, needing to find her balance. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh, yeah this will take some getting used to. My legs are like stilts. You made me a tall gal!&quot;<br />
<br />
He grabbed her before she fell of the branch and she used him as a crutch as they walked over to Steven&#39;s hut. <br />
<br />
Now that she thought of it, a name change was in order. <br />
<br />
She concluded that Bevesta sounded nice after rearranging, removing and adding letters to her name for a while. She declared her new name to Bark  who liked it a lot. <br />
<br />
When they entered Bevesta threw him onto her spidersilk-bed. <br />
<br />
Butterflies filled her stomach as she took off his pants and his erect member shot forth. <br />
<br />
Bark squirmed as she squeezed it with all four of her hands. Both of them wanted this so badly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I will take you in my mouth. Take it as another thank you from me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bark gulped as Bevesta put her lips on his tip, sucking on it. <br />
<br />
She shuddered. Why did this feel so good? <br />
<br />
&quot;You know...when I transformed you I made it so that when you are turned on, every part of your body becomes a pleasure zone.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave him another thanks in her head as she took him all the way in. The chitinous texture was strange, but pleasant. Her tongue danced along his member. <br />
<br />
She went down all the way to the base of his shaft, which was rather easy with her new biology. Her tongue felt like there was alwas supposed to be a male rubbing against it. <br />
<br />
She went up and down on him. His legs were crossed between her head, pushing her deeper into his crotch. <br />
<br />
He started thrusting, putting a hand on her head, pushing her down. God this felt soooo goooood. <br />
<br />
They continued till Bevesta realized that Bark was about to orgasm. He squirmed again as she removed her mouth from it.  She looked into his loving face. <br />
<br />
Her new tunnel yearned to be filled by his member so she climbed on top of him and slowly slid down. Her  cave tightened, lubricating itself with a honey-like liquid. <br />
<br />
Both of them moaned as he penetrated into her tight hole. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, fill me with your love!&quot;, she moaned in a animalistic frenzy. <br />
<br />
They kissed and touched each other all over, cupping butts, grabbing legs and their antennae intertwined. <br />
<br />
This new sensation between her legs of something thick sliding in felt sooooooooo nice. Her walls rubbed against him, not wanting to let go as he drew further and further in,parting her folds which made her stick her tongue into his mouth. <br />
<br />
They rubbed against each other, losing themselves in the moment as chitin touched chitin. <br />
<br />
Bevesta loved womanhood already and looking at her lover, he loved her womanhood too as he fondled her. She wanted to be touched so badly. <br />
<br />
Soon she became even tighter as her pleasure became greater. <br />
<br />
Bevesta got very vocal as she reached climax after climax till Bark eventually busted and his hot seed was shoot deep into her womb, making her give him a last moan. <br />
<br />
She slowly got him out of her as Bark was spent for the day, breathing heavily in a state of post-orgasmic bliss. <br />
<br />
They kissed, swearing their love to each other till they fell asleep with both of their dreams fulfilled.</p>
