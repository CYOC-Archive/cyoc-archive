<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty walked up and down pushing the mower. Getting even with Dustin was fun, but Mark, that was.. &quot;Stupid stupid stupid!&quot; Ty banged his fist on the mower handle. He shut it off and sat down with his back against the fence, staring at the house.  All he'd ever really wanted was a family he could belong in.  One where his parents loved him and wanted him around and to spend time with him.  Maybe if he'd been put in their care when he was younger, and if Dustin hadn't been born first...maybe it would have turned out alright.<br />
<br />
Ty blinked and looked again at the house.  Mark's tackling dummy and other football crap was gone from the yard.  There was a big deck and a hot tub where Mark had made him run around so Dustin could tackle him, and a lot of the yard he'd just mowed was taken up by an in-ground pool.  Tyler stood up and brushed himself off.  The dried blood was gone from his t-shirt.  He glanced around.  The neighbors' houses all looked the same, it was just his house that was..  &quot;changed.  I wanted it to be different, and it changed!&quot;  Ty felt his chest and flexed his arms; yup, still kinda ripped.  He didn't grope himself out where anyone could see him, but did check his enlarged package in the shed after putting the mower away. For some reason his pubic hair was trimmed to a short stubble.<br />
<br />
Ty hesitated as he climbed the steps to the new/old deck.  He could see plenty of scratches and dings and a few scorch marks, no way this thing was brand new, but he remembered it not being here minutes before.  He glanced at the hot tub and deck chairs.  Had he really changed his own history?  But if so, why couldn't he remember it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty honey? all done with the lawn?&quot; June called from inside.<br />
<br />
Climbing the last few steps Ty looked through the sliding doors into the kitchen.  June was working at something on the center island.  As Ty stepped inside he saw she was frosting a layer cake and, humming?  Tyler couldn't ever remember his foster mother humming before, and she looked, kinda hot?<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoah!&quot; Tyler stared at June.  His June, the old June in his memory, had been pale and running a bit fat.  She went to a lot of volunteer meetings where she sat around and drank too much sweet tea.  Her teeth were stained brown from it, which had always made Tyler a bit embarrassed, even if she wasn't his real mom.  The new June was tanned and looked like she worked out.  She was wearing a sundress that revealed a lot of shapely leg, and cleavage?  Tyler swallowed and blinked, yeah, she certainly had it going on..<br />
<br />
June looked up and smiled at him.  Gleaming white teeth, definitely not a tea-drinker.  &quot;No tasting your cake before it's ready.&quot; She said waving a well manicured finger at him.  &quot;Are you going to do your laps before the party, or give swim practice a miss today?&quot;  She laid down the tube of icing and walked over to Tyler, finger-combing his hair. &quot;I wish you'd grow this out a bit, you have such lovely soft hair.&quot;  She pulled Tyler's face down to plant a kiss on his forehead.<br />
<br />
Tyler found himself staring down his mother's dress. Nice tits, no bra in sight, some pale marks, maybe from nursing? Ty pulled his head up and looked away as June pulled him into a full-body hug. <br />
<br />
&quot;To think my little boy is all grown up and turning 15!&quot; She stood up on her tiptoes and tucked her chin on Ty's shoulder, then rocked them from side to side. Tyler was very aware of the breasts she was rubbing against him, even if she was his mom.  June slid her hands down his back and pulled their bodies tightly together. &quot;And you've grown so big!&quot; Tyler returned her bear hug desperately willing himself not to get an erection.  Eventually June released him and stepped back.  Her nipples were tight, and if anything her breasts looked bigger than they had been a minute ago.  Tyler fought his eyes back to her face to see she was blushing slightly, or maybe flushed?  Clearly she'd been as aware of his body as he'd been of hers. &quot;Well, cat got your tongue?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh, no. No swimming.  I thought I'd go grab a shower and, um, watch some TV until the party?&quot;  His parents were actually throwing him a party?  With a cake and everything?  Even with June looking all cougar-tastic, he was even more shocked and excited to actually be getting a birthday party for once!<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.  Off with you, smelly beast, just be ready by 11:30 to start greeting guests.&quot;  She waved him towards the stairs. &quot;And you might help Dustin with his algebra, if you get a chance.  I know your father'd appreciate a break from homework duty.&quot; She smiled again and Tyler gave a two finger salute as he turned and headed to the stairs.  He stopped and glanced back as he heard June--Mom?--begin humming again.  She picked up the icing tube and returned to making decorations on the cake.<br />
<br />
Tyler climbed the stairs slowly, taking in the pictures hung there.  Was that him?  He squinted, it certainly wasn't Dustin in a swimcap and speedo sporting some medals. A step up and there were the medals all mounted in a shadow box: all state boys champion freestyle, relay, breastroke? Speaking of breasts here was a photo of him in the hot tub with June, in a fetching little bikini, and hey, that must me Mark!  Not as dumpy as he'd made him before, but definitely not the jock asshole he remembered growing up.  Still with the glasses and receding hair though.  Ty wondered if he still had the undersized package--that might explain June's rubbing up against him, if Mark wasn't satisfying her urges... but who took the picture?  Ah!  here's one of him Mark and a skinny little runt holding up a line of fish they'd caught.  Dustin looked about like he'd made him this morning, only now he apparently really was a couple years younger than Ty--taking Algebra would make him a freshman to Tyler's junior.<br />
<br />
At the top of the stairs Tyler automatically turned left and started to step into his room before he realized it wasn't his room any more.  His posters of Miley Cyrus, bookcase full of hardy boys books, and the old desk of Dustin's with the hand-me-down TV were gone.  At a fancy new desk Dustin and Mark were going over some papers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Ty, Happy Birthday!&quot; Dustin said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks kiddo!&quot; Tyler replied, bemused by this new friendly younger brother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yard finished already?  We'll get started on the decorations once Dusty finishes these problems.&quot;  Mark smiled at him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, yeah.  Mom asked if I could help Dusty with his algebra--after I finish my shower.&quot; Ty backed out of the doorway. The friendly family bit was taking a bit to get used to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; Dustin was practically glowing, hero worship much?  <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright you, let your brother go and let's take another whack at solving #23 for Y.&quot; Mark said, ruffling his son's hair.<br />
<br />
Ty hurried to the next door that used to be Dustin's and stepped inside.  Swimmer posters, some bikini model posters, there were his books!  And a lot of other books as well!  Tyler was glad he was still a reader, but apparently either Mark and June--Dad and Mom--were more supportive of the habit, or he had a much bigger allowance.  The room didn't seem as big as he remembered Dustin's room being.  Tyler glanced around again, taking a change of clothes out of a slightly bigger closet.  Beside the closet door was another leading to a small bathroom. His new family must have remodeled the upstairs at some point.  <br />
<br />
Tyler smiled and striped down before hopping into the shower.  Star athlete, hot foster-mom, younger brother who idolizes me, and Mark doesn't seem too bad either.  Now if only he could remember what he was supposed to have experienced in this reality...</p>
