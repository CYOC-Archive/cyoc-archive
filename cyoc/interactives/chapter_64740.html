<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Officer Barnes and I made it through the parade with no problems and our driver proved very friendly. He even drove us back to where our car was parked after the parade.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” I said to him as Officer Barnes and I climbed out.<br />
<br />
“No problem,” our driver for the parade answered, “had to come back this way anyway to return the Jeep.”<br />
<br />
He then backed up the jeep as Officer Barnes and I moved away and toward our own vehicle.<br />
<br />
“Have a happy Fourth!” he called to us s he drove away.<br />
<br />
And with that, our driver for the parade was gone. Officer Barnes and I then quietly got into our own vehicle and began the drive back to Columbia Falls.<br />
<br />
“Well, that was fun,” I commented as we got rolling again.<br />
<br />
“Yes, yes it was,” Officer Barnes nodded from the front seat, “say, I think I saw Molly among the spectators.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, she came to watch the parade,” I answered, “I told her we’d be in the parade and she decided she wanted to come. Probably to relive childhood events. I’m pretty sure her folks took her to see the parade in Peoria when we were little.”<br />
<br />
“And I’m sure the fact that you were in the parade had nothing to do with it,” Officer Barnes quipped, “Did you know her when you were little?”<br />
<br />
“Know her personally, yes,” I responded, “though we didn’t actually start dating until we were in college.”<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes nodded as we drove along, “still… I’m sure you were part of the reason why she came.”<br />
<br />
I nodded, “Yeah… we’d actually agreed before hand that she would come to watch the parade. So, I was actually looking for her in the parade.”<br />
<br />
“And so it was all good times,” Officer Barnes replied as we made it out of Kalispell’s city limits, “You two have any plans for the rest of the fourth?”<br />
<br />
“We’ve been invited to a barbeque with the Choirs this evening,” I answered, “and we’ll probably watch a “Capital Fourth” on PBS when it comes on.”<br />
<br />
“The one that the guy who played the Mayor on Spin City used to host?” Officer Barnes asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s hosted by the guy who played Lieutenant Dan in “Forest Gump” now, but yeah,” I nodded.<br />
<br />
“Megan’s seen some adds for it on TV,” Officer Barnes commented, “they’re supposedly going to do a tribute to  the nation’s Animal People this year. She hopes they show you.”<br />
<br />
“Molly’s seen the ads too,” I nodded, “I’m very curious about seeing this tribute they’re planning.”<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The ride back to Columbia Falls went quietly and Officer Barnes and I returned to our station at about one fifteen PM after having lunch in a fast food restaurant along the main road going into the town from the south. We were met by Officer Howard as we came in.<br />
<br />
“So, how did it go?” he asked as approached.<br />
<br />
“Very well, sir,” Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
“The kids all seemed to enjoy the candy,” I added.<br />
<br />
“Don’t all children?” Officer Howard replied with a laugh.<br />
<br />
“Not ALL children, sir,” Officer Jenkins spoke up from her place at the desk.<br />
<br />
With the front part of the station now rebuilt, the front area was now back in use again. We had the better radios that were part of the station’s main equipment and the car radio that we had been using while waiting for the repairs to be completed was returned to the car it had been borrowed from. It also meant that Officer Jenkins was able to resume her duties from the post she was supposed to do them from. It meant she could easily overhear the conversations held in the station’s front area.<br />
<br />
And she did overhear and had to point out the truth that we all knew. All kids liked the taste of candy, but for Megan Jenkins, that indulgence was impossible for her. Things like chocolate and candy were now health risks for her. It was physically difficult, if not impossible for her to digest candies, particularly those that used a large amount of artificial flavorings and ingredients. It was so far, Megan’s biggest complaint about being a tiger-person.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure she’d want to eat some if she could,” Officer Howard replied, “but I understand.”<br />
<br />
Officer Jenkins nodded in response.<br />
<br />
“How did our team do?” Officer Barnes asked after a few moments.<br />
<br />
“As far as I know, they’ve only just started,” Officer Howard answered, “though don’t get any ideas…”<br />
<br />
“Of course sir,” Officer Barnes answered dutifully.<br />
<br />
“Anyway, as this is the Fourth, you have the right to a shortened day today,” Officer Howard answered, “At three, you’re free to go home… though you’ll all be “on call” as it were for the rest of the day. So should anything happen after three and before the time that our nightshift comes on duty, you’re to hurry to the scene.”<br />
<br />
“Of course, sir,” Officer Barnes and I acknowledged the orders.<br />
<br />
“Have a happy Fourth,” Officer Howard then said with a smile and headed back into his office.<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes then quietly nodded and placed the tub of candy that was left over from the parade and we were allowed to keep. I couldn’t eat it, but I was sure the other officers would enjoy it.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The rest of our day went quietly with little problem. Officer Barnes and I ran one patrol before being allowed to go home. The worst we had to deal with was a guy who had indulged in one too many at some party he had been at. He didn’t commit any crime beyond “public intoxication” and he would likely only stay at the station until he sobered up.<br />
<br />
When my day ended, I then quietly made my way to Bandhavgarh Cabin. Things were quiet there as I arrived, but given how warm it was, I had a good guess where Molly was. And she was there. Swimming slow laps around the pool was Molly in the pool that we owned.<br />
<br />
“Staying cool?” I asked as I approached.<br />
<br />
Molly pivoted in the water when I spoke and moved into a position where she was crouching in the water. She smiled as she made her way to the edge of the water.<br />
<br />
“Of course I’m staying cool,” Molly answered with a half teasing smile, “unless you prefer me well done…”<br />
<br />
I chuckled at her joke and slowly nuzzled her. Her fur was wet, but I didn’t mind.<br />
<br />
“You’re home fairly early,” Molly commented.<br />
<br />
“Officer Howard let me come home early as it’s the Fourth of July,” I answered, “Though I’ll still be on call should anything happen.”<br />
<br />
“Do you think anything will?” Molly inquired.<br />
<br />
“At the moment? No,” I told her, “would you mind if I got changed and joined you before we go up to the Choir’s?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t mind,” Molly answered, “hurry back though… it’ll take us a little while to dry our fur.”<br />
<br />
I nodded and headed in. I removed my uniform and put on a pair of shorts that would easily function as bathing shorts and readied a set of cloths to wear when Molly and I headed up the Choir’s for dinner. I also retrieved an extra towel to use and returned to the backyard. Molly had resumed slowly swimming around the pool’s edge as I returned.<br />
<br />
“Ready for me to jump in?” I joked as I set my towel down.<br />
<br />
“No jumping!” Molly answered, “we’d break the walls pulling that sort of nonsense.”<br />
<br />
“And flood our first floor,” I commented as I climbed up onto the large stool we had to climb into the pool.<br />
<br />
Entering the pool gave me confirmation of why it was a good idea to have the pool. The water was cool. I could easily feel it through my fur as the water soaked all the way through. Against the summer heat, it felt good.<br />
<br />
“Eerrrrrrrrrrrrrmmmm,” I gave a low rumble in contentment, “the cool water feels good on a hot day.”<br />
<br />
“Of course it does,” Molly managed to nod as I lay back to simply float on my back in the water.<br />
<br />
And so we lay there in our pool, letting the cool waters remove some of the body heat that had built up over the day.<br />
<br />
“What did you think of the Parade?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“It was wonderful,” Molly answered, “almost like the ones they put on in Peoria… did you go to them?”<br />
<br />
“My mom and I did,” I answered, “dad was in a good many of them… he probably still is.”<br />
<br />
“And now it’s your turn,” Molly smiled, “the only problem was that not enough packets of meat were thrown. It wouldn’t hurt to have thrown some salami, bologna, or summer sausage.”<br />
<br />
“They’re expecting us to please kids, Molly,” I chuckled.<br />
<br />
“I know, and it isn’t a big complaint on my part,” Molly then laughed a little.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Our fur was mostly dry when we made our way up to Dave and Tabby’s home. We walked past the rows of grape vines and that lead to the front lawn. As we got closer to the home, the scent of cooking meat drifted to us. I found myself licking my lips. Hot dogs weren’t that filling, but taste good. I managed to stop licking my lips once we reached the door.<br />
<br />
“Hello, George, Molly,” Tabby greeted us after ringing the bell.<br />
<br />
“Hello,” Molly and I said together.<br />
<br />
“Things are getting started,” Tabby announced, “Dave is cooking some hot dogs right now. They should be ready pretty soon and we can eat them while the real steaks are cooking.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Tabby,” Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
Tabby nodded and lead us in. Inside, Veronica was watching television, and specifically PBS. She looked over to me and Molly as we entered. She smiled and hopped up. She then came over and gave me a hug.<br />
<br />
“Thank you for the candy,” Veronica said with a smile.<br />
<br />
“You’re welcome,” I answered politely, “what are you watching?”<br />
<br />
“The Fourth of July party,” Veronica answered, “the one where they celebrate you guys.”<br />
<br />
“I think they’re celebrating all the Animal People,” Molly told her.<br />
<br />
“You’re the only two I know,” Veronica replied and then moved hug Molly.<br />
<br />
Molly and I gave a low chuckle as Veronica lead us to the couch. We ended up sitting there with Molly between us. As we sat down, I looked up to the television and saw the program going through the introduction of the various segments that would be part of the show.<br />
<br />
“I’ll go and help Dave with the hot dogs,” Tabby spoke, “we’ll join you shortly.”<br />
<br />
Molly and I nodded. The program went well with various patriotic or pop songs being sung or played for the enjoyment of the people there in Washington. It was all fairly nice, but my curiosity was still waiting for this “celebration of Animal People.”<br />
<br />
“Here you go, George,” Dave spoke when he came in, getting my attention.<br />
<br />
I turned to see him hand me a large plate of hot dogs. Tabby handed Molly a similar plate and then a smaller plate to Veronica. Veronica’s hot dog had a bun and mustard and ketchup.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Dave,” I answered, “I’m mostly waiting to see what this celebration of Animal People is about.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I’m not sure who organized it, but if it means humanity can accept Animal People,” Dave replied, “I’d think it would be a very nice gesture.”<br />
<br />
I nodded, “Maybe it means we aren’t as far gone groups like R.A.M. would lead people to believe.”<br />
<br />
Dave nodded and took a bite out of his hot dog, while I did the same with mine. And the screen the show’s host stepped forward.<br />
<br />
“America has always been a leader in the sciences,” the host began, “we have come up with new theories that reshaped our world and our understanding of it. We have invented new technologies that have kept us light-years ahead of the rest of the world. Recently, science has created a serum that has reshaped how our world is made up. Created by accident, the Animatrix Serum has changed the world. Humanity is no longer the only sentient and sapient species on this world. A host of different species of Animal People have appeared because of it. Some as victims of a greedy man seeking a quick profit… some because of their own desire to be different.”<br />
<br />
He host paused as if to sigh for a moment before continuing.<br />
<br />
“And their trials and tribulations have not been easy,” the host continued, “they have faced the same prejudices that every American minority has ever faced… but they have also seen the open hearts of many, and many of them have managed to succeed in their own lives. Which is a clear sign that America’s society is open and far better then the worst of the prejudices that we have seen or anyone else has seen. And the Animal-People have overcome the worst… and God willing… they will overcome the rest. And our country may continue to show the world what it will always be… the shining light of the world.”<br />
<br />
They then began playing a series of Civil Rights era songs, most notably “We Shall Overcome” with a collage of photographs of Animal People as well as the few television news clips of Animal People that were there. Among them was a photograph of me and Officer Howard leaving the Helena courthouse during Beauregard’s trial, and a news coverage clip of Molly and Leona leaving Changes’ trial.<br />
<br />
“You’re both in there!” Veronica cheered.<br />
<br />
“It appears we are,” Molly answered with a nod.<br />
<br />
“I want to be just like you when I grow up,” Veronica added.<br />
<br />
Molly and I only chuckled.</p>
