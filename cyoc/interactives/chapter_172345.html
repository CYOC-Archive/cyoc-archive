<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Trent grabbed his shovel to start mucking, Pappa yelling in the distance, &quot;Don&#39;t get any of that muck n&#39; slop on ya, it will dirty you up like you&#39;ve never seen boy!&quot; He slightly jolts up as he hears the farmer, but barely catches what he says. Naturally he wouldn&#39;t want any of the contents of these stalls on him, didn&#39;t need an extra warning for some common sense.<br />
<br />
His job was difficult enough for a normal person, but with his current stature using a shovel was painfully difficult. He&#39;d stir it into the stall, brushing straw away and getting all the gunk pushed to the sides. It should&#39;ve only taken him 20 minutes at most, but it the chore was easily sapping his energy and drew out the time it took. Luckily he was in the shade, but it was still hot and built up a sweat as he worked. The pig boys oinking periodically as the lazed in their pen while he toiled through his chore. They weren&#39;t the only distraction, his sensitive member was still partially erect and caused it to drag against the rough denim of his overalls. Trent wishing he could have some underwear at least, though with how things are run around the farm he doubt a pair even exist on location.<br />
<br />
The boy letting out a huff as he manages to finish the final stall, setting the shovel off to the side neatly with the collection in a wheel barrel. He relaxed a little with his task completed, walking over to the pig pen to give the pig boys a bit of his pity. They didn&#39;t seem to be as intelligent as himself or others on the farm, likely an affect of the magic cast on them by Pappa, but it was impossible to tell. He could feel a bit of pressure in his bladder as he looked on coming to the conclusion he may as well relieve himself while he&#39;s here. He gave a quick look around for any prying eyes or even Pappa before unbuttoning his overalls and leaning into the edge of the pig pen. He was sure they wouldn&#39;t mind, lining his miniature pecker up and releasing the stream into the mud as he leaned forward on the pen looking off in the distance for Pappa. He shivered some as the flow continued for a moment, closing his eyes and enjoying the momentarily relief.<br />
He doesn&#39;t notice a couple pig boys toddling over until they&#39;re pressing their dirtied snouts against his groin, smearing the mess on him. He gives a jolt and falls backward as the flow ebbs, his bits slathered in the foul smelling mix, &quot;Damnit, just fantastic.&quot; He hobbles over to a convenient  towel hanging nearby and begins to wipe the muck away from his groin, it&#39;s oddly sticky and smears easily. He grunts and continues to clean at the area and manages to get it near spotless save for the lingering smell. Trent inspecting his groin more closely as he&#39;s not quite accustomed to being so small and so smooth no less. Though he finds a long curly lingering pubic hair sticking from the very head of his penis, &quot;Gross, must be from the pigs.&quot; He brushes at it and jostles his member a bit, but it&#39;s stuck firmly and in fact their were a few more hairs sticking out over his groin, &quot;Huh, I guess his magic isn&#39;t perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trent noticing a few more and poking out over his shaft and scrotum, in fact, it swears he can see them growing. They were even sticking out from the head of his shaft, lightly pulling at them and wincing as they grew from the sensitive organ, &quot;What the hell, that isn&#39;t right..&quot; The folicles pushing through more rapidly and forcing him to scratch at his groin vigorously,  &quot;D-damnit, this really itches.&quot; His bush starting to reform around his groin and thickly as he was forced to continue to scratch at the area helpless to the growth. He peeled his hands away to look at the forest of pubes multiplying from every point of his groin, starting swallow up his small boyhood in that growing bush. <br />
<br />
Granted he was already small down there the excess hair didn&#39;t help, covering every little bit of his bits in curly hairs. He could only watch as his groin soon covered itself in a dense canopy of hair, that miniscule member hardly visible any longer. He combed through it some and winced as he easily caught some knots that pulled at his sensitive glands where more pubes had been rooted. He looked around for some kind of help, but of course there was none. Though surely if Pappa caught him like this he&#39;d get in trouble. He could only pull his overalls up and secure them, though at the very least he wouldn&#39;t need underwear for the time being.</p>
