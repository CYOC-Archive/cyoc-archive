<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I realized that I was straining. My muscles, and bones all felt like they were carrying around three hundred pounds, and my lungs seemed to strain with any attempts to heavy breathing. &quot;I need release,&quot; I answered, Lara kissing and rubbing my dick. &quot;I need you to take it all at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, that&#39;s exactly what I wanted. Now, sit very still and try not to panic,&quot; she warned, standing upright. <br />
<br />
&quot;Panic, why would I pa- oh, shit!&quot; I yelled as Lara raised her hand, palm towards me. I felt a rush, like all the energy and pressure was moving south, concentrating into my groin. Sure enough my balls began to inflate even bigger. I felt like a water bottle being pumped into a water balloon. They continued to grow, pressing against my thighs until I could stretch no farther. They were golf balls now, my manhood appearing small in comparison. Now they were pool balls, my erection twitching as they seemed to press it against my stomach. They reached the size of tennis balls the rest of my body starting to feel normal again. Finally the procedure stopped as my testicles were now the size of a baseball each. &quot;Holy shit. Is that-?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All the sexual energy you earned last night, concentrated in one. massive. load,&quot; Lara grinned, licking her lips and moving sensually towards me. I saw her hips sway, her tongue licking her teeth. I was already about to cum between the pressure in my balls and the feeling of so much power concentrated there. I felt like a beast, like a prize stallion in heat. I felt myself begin to ejaculate until-<br />
<br />
&quot;No, not yet, baby,&quot; Lara smiled, gripping the base of my shaft to stop the load that was primed to erupt. &quot;Not until I&#39;ve wrapped my moist, soft lips around you. Then you can cum all you want.&quot; She lifted me up to standing then backed up towards her bed and laid with her legs up. &quot;Now fuck me,&quot; she ordered. I shuffled forward, my balls no longer allowing for my usual gate and I desperately did not want to cum too early. I feared that once I started I would not stop until I was empty. After what seemed an eternity I finally made it to her, slamming my cock into her awaiting pussy. She gasped as I began to thrust in and out. She felt different from the other four girls. I know that each woman has their own uniqueness but... there was something warmer, more familiar, and more comforting about hers. I hadn&#39;t felt it in the others, and somehow instinctively knew I never would. She cooed and huffed as I pushed in and out with greater force. I was going to cum and it would be the best one I had. With that thought I plunged into her one last time before suddenly exploding. It didn&#39;t feel like a rope, this was a stream. I twitched once, then twice, then several times rapidly. I couldn&#39;t stop, twitching so hard and feeling like I was ejaculating a lifetime of sperm into her. A symbol on her abdomen appeared, Lara smiling as her stomach began to bulge and grow, bigger than what I did with Aubrey the night before. Her belly swelled bigger with every twitch and she was loving it. Meanwhile my balls were shrinking as she began counting aloud. &quot;18, 19, 20, 21, 22,...&quot; She was counting the number of spurts as her belly stretched and began to look pregnant. <br />
<br />
The relief was too much, I could feel my consciousness slipping. The last number I heard was 38 then everything went black. Next thing I knew I was laying in Lara&#39;s bed as she stood at the door fully clothed and as perfect as ever. She was talking to someone who I couldn&#39;t see but recognized one of the voices as Charity. There was a series of giggles and Lara closed the door quietly, turning back to me to see me awake. I blinked, her boobs looked considerably larger, reaching into F cup range.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re awake, I&#39;m sorry about you passing out, I guess it was a bit too much for you,&quot; she giggled offering me some steaming tea in a china cup. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll... say...&quot; I muttered trying to sit up. My head was still spinning as though I&#39;d been asleep for a day. &quot;How long was I out?&quot; I asked taking the tea. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just a few hours. I brought you some breakfast but it&#39;s closer to lunch. The Venus Girls showed up looking for you. I said you were resting. Apparently yesterday was a mad success. Sophia and Su no longer seem so shy or stuck up anymore, and I could tell Charity was already wanting more action with you. So I guess this may become a weekly thing,&quot; she grinned. I gave her a look that said &#39;oh please no,&#39; to which she laughed. &quot;Don&#39;t worry I told them you had to rest up and that last night was hard on you. They promise to go easier next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you promise that as well?&quot; I asked, sipping the tea which was sweet and rejuvenating. <br />
<br />
&quot;Next time, you won&#39;t need us to go easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I could barely handle cumming inside you after all that, what do you mean next time I won&#39;t need you to go easy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger,&quot; she replied. &quot;You managed yourself well. Next time you&#39;ll do better. Sex, like anything else, requires practice. Virgins cum quick and often when they first have sex but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s good. They need to practice, learn, and figure out what works and what doesn&#39;t. So okay, maybe you went a bit overboard this time, but now your body is already used to holding in so much energy and summarily releasing it. So next time it&#39;ll be different. Don&#39;t underestimate yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah, nice boob job by the way,&quot; I sneered, half meaning it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so you want them to stay this size? I can arrange that but this was a temporary fix.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fix?&quot; I looked up at her. <br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t answer but simply concentrated as I watched her breasts shrink and belly distend again like before I passed out. By the time she was done she looked to be five months pregnant. &quot;I wanted to just absorb it right away but... well it&#39;s much more exciting to have you watch. So with that said...&quot; She groaned a bit as a light shown from within her stomach and the cum that had built up within her began to dissipate, her stomach flattening once more. The curved lines appeared again, Lara cooing as her eyes flashed pink. &quot;Just reached another tier. You really are the best,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Now that that&#39;s all settled, there&#39;s one last piece of business,&quot; she smirked, getting closer to me. I groaned internally, secretly hoping she did not want more sex. I know, a guy not wanting sex. What the hell right? Still I dreaded anything sexual. My body felt like it had fallen apart and been put back together with toothpicks and chewing gum, and I really couldn&#39;t see myself even managing an erection. Just as I began to feel a shudder run up my spine she kissed me. <br />
<br />
Yeah, that&#39;s it. She just... kissed me. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I was no stranger to her lips but usualy her kisses involved tongue and groping. This time it was just passion, softness, and warmth. Her plump lips pressed against mine and her hands remained behind her back as she simply maintained a single point of physical contact between us. It was electrifying. She held her kiss for a minute or two before opening her eyes and looking dreamily into mine. &quot;Lunch?&quot; she asked in the cutest softest voice I&#39;d ever heard.</p>
