<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Weeks passed in this glorious new reality that Bill had found himself in. No more bully problems (one of said bullies now being his extremely attractive girlfriend), three days left until graduation and the freedoms of being out of high school...Even Tom&#39;s life was better due to Joanna using her own girl squad to counter Gloria&#39;s bullshit and eventually redeeming the teenager in the eyes of the entire school! Things had simply gone so right, so fast that the strange stone had simply slipped Bill&#39;s mind and laid dormant at the bottom of his backback, which was currently sitting precariously on a chair in the Strasserman living room.<br />
<br />
And now, on a lazy, rainy, mid-May Sunday afternoon, Bill lay on his bed listening to the rain hit his bedroom window. Well, listening was the wrong term. Joanna was draped across him, her bare incredible breasts pressing up against him, a long, toned, mostly naked leg slowly stroking his own as a slender hand caressed his chest as soft lips repeatedly met his. Luckily his parents were out at a movie and while he did have to watch Kimberly, Bill had made the most of the free time. This woman, and Joanna certainly was a woman, truly completed him. She giggled as he teased at her panties, slowly stripping them down her legs as one of her powerful yet gentle hands slipped into his boxers and grasped the hard shaft that was waiting in the darkness. They had more than enough time, and Kimberly was more than taken care of at the moment.<br />
<br />
And Kimberly? While she was a bit of a brat and she and Bill often fought over...everything for little reason at all, they shared one thing in common: Video games. It was Kimberly&#39;s &#39;dark&#39; secret that she liked something that was popular with &#39;stupid boys&#39;. And she wasn&#39;t very good at them, but it seemed to be the one thing that brother and sister could do that didn&#39;t erupt into a sibling fight. They&#39;d played various video games together in co-op, but with Joanna now in his life, Bill had been letting Kimberly play some of his more mature single player games. Much like she was this afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; Kimberly gasped as she wandered down the streets of Karnaca, city in the video game Dishonored 2. The pre-teen marveled at the colorful buildings and the fantastic art design the game had, her young mind immersed in a world that had been so meticulously crafted that it felt alive. &quot;This is so cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kimberly had had her doubts with the opening level, the dull, colorless streets of Dunwall and the oppressive atmosphere of the polluted, troubled city. She&#39;d blazed through the level, dying several times and killing most of the guards due to not fully grasping the concept of stealth or the binary nature of the game&#39;s morality system. But then the comic-like cutscene and the weird space level where the skinny guy had given her magic powers? That had kept her interested enough to make it to the next level where Karnaca&#39;s tropical beauty had simply pulled her in and never let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love this place so much!&quot;<br />
<br />
But at the apex of her joy the skies above the Strasserman house simply to split apart as the flash of lightning filled the entire house, the breakers popping and the power going dead as the loudest thunder Kimberly had ever heard shook the house and everything in it. Kimberly screamed, but it was all gone in a second, the rolling thunder fading away to the sound of heavy rain once more. Shaking her head, Kimberly picked up the console controller and tried to power everything back up, eager to resume her adventure in that amazing world...But nothing happened.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay Kim?&quot; Bill&#39;s shout came from upstairs. So long as she wasn&#39;t dead or something, Bill had more important things to worry about. The power would come back on in a few minutes anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but the power is out and the Xbox won&#39;t turn back on!&quot; Kimberly screamed back as she furiously pressed all the buttons on the controller and the console itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;The power will come back on, just go color a picture or something!&quot; Bill yelled before turning back to Joanna, who had a very impatient look on her face. &quot;Sorry, brotherly duties&quot; He grinned sheepishly, and was rewarded with a eye roll and a deep kiss as Joanna slowly slid guided Bill&#39;s cock towards her slit.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, downstairs Kimberly was mad. She paced the living room and said every bad word she knew while she waited for the power to come back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not freaking fair!&quot; She grumbled, &quot;I bet the characters in the game don&#39;t have to worry about this!&quot; She was so consumed with her childish, petty desire to continue playing the game that she hadn&#39;t noticed that Bill&#39;s backpack and been knocked off of it&#39;s precarious perch by the thunder, it&#39;s content spilling all over the carpeted floor of the living room. It had largely just been papers and stuff Bill had cleaned out of his locker, most just piling halfway out of the backpack as it lay in a pile on the floor.<br />
<br />
But one item of note had managed to fully escape from the pack: A deep green stone. It, despite it&#39;s shape and the carpet, had somehow managed to shoot halfway across the room, right in Kimberly&#39;s path. It caught the faint light just right, shining weakly and drawing the girl&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; Kimberly asked no one as she reached down and picked up the pretty gemstone. She marveled at it&#39;s design and how the light seemed to curve around the gold teardrop in the center. &quot;Where did this come from?&quot; She wondered before her mind instantly starting making connections back to the game that she had been denied. The pre-teen clenched her hand shut, grasping the gemstone tight as she went back to her private tantrum.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why isn&#39;t the power on!? I want to play my game!&quot; She whined somewhat loudly, hoping Bill would hear her, but she had no idea that Bill wasn&#39;t hearing much of anything outside of the heavy breathing that was currently filling his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;This sucks so much! I bet in the game they didn&#39;t have to deal with this! That place looked perfect and so pretty! Not like this stupid place with it&#39;s stupid weather!&quot; Kimberly continued to rant on, unaware of the green-gold glow escaping from the cracks between her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet if I lived there I&#39;d be a princess and I could just make them fix the power right now! I wish that...&quot;</p>
