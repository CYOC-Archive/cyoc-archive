<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Dave checked the time again, it read 17:15.  <br />
<br />
Damn.  He’d been putting so much focus on the job that Janet had given him that he’d lost track of time.  Quickly putting everything away, some into his briefcase to take home with him, and locking up the drawers, he put the pen along with his notepad into his pouch before putting his coat on again, leaving it open for the time being, as he locked his office shut before heading to Ross’s office at a brisk pace.  <br />
<br />
Once there, he signalled for Ross, who turned up in his navy-blue cape.  <br />
<br />
“Ross?”  Dave began, “I need the permissions and keys for the Office, since I’m needed to work here on Sunday to complete a report I was given earlier today.”  <br />
<br />
“You’ve cut it rather close then.”  Ross rumbled in annoyance.  <br />
<br />
“Yes, well, I did get a little too stuck into it.  And sort of lost track of time.”  Dave reasoned with him, not really a lie.  <br />
<br />
“Wait here then.”  He rumbled again, but without the annoyance that Dave had detected.  Perhaps his changing his work ethic had made it so that his explanation was one he could easily accept.  <br />
<br />
In any case though, moments later, Ross had returned with a set of office keys and some forms to be filled in.  <br />
<br />
“Sign in the required places.  And remember, anything happens here during Sunday, will be your responsibility.”  Ross reminded Dave of the legal requirements as he signed his name into the appropriate places with the pen that Ross had supplied for this small task.  <br />
<br />
“Alright, everything is in order now.”  Ross responded as he checked the paperwork.  “Here you go then.”  Dave was quick to deposit the keys into his pouch and close it securely as he nodded his thanks.  <br />
<br />
Once he left the office building, he closed his coat to hold back the wind and began a brisk stroll to the nearest bus stop.  True, he did have a car of his own, but there was only one between himself and Ashlee, and her workplace was further away, so she used the car while he took the bus.  As he walked to the stop, it occurred to Dave that he hadn’t used the pen’s power for a while, since he’d been rather busy with his work and hadn’t given it much thought.  Oh well, there would be plenty of opportunities for using it later.  <br />
<br />
But he still had one thing he needed to do first, pulling out his cell phone, he punched in the Speed Dial for Ashlee, and waited for her to pick it up.  <br />
<br />
“Yes, Ashlee?……..I meant to call earlier, but the work kept me from that……Had to work in a bit, so I’m going to be late home……Okay then, see you when you get back……Love you, bye.”  Now that she was aware of his late day, there wouldn’t be any major questions for a while.  <br />
<br />
Now though, he had reached the bus stop, and just in time too as his bus was just approaching.  Waiting in line, Dave presented his pass to the driver, a middle-aged woman who looked to be about 200 lb, before taking a seat at the very back and on the left.  He found that he needed to wrap his tail around down his leg, but fortunately for him, it wasn’t too uncomfortable.  <br />
<br />
As it left, Dave knew that it may only be about a third-full right then, but it would fill in the next three stops as other commuters boarded to return to their own homes.  This, Dave realised, gave him an opportunity.  <br />
<br />
With a travel time of close to 45 minutes, it would be a long wait to his stop, and even though he was used to it, it did seem to drag on from time to time.  But today, with the pen and something to write on, he could easily make things very interesting, and very quickly.  <br />
<br />
Opening his coat again, and bringing his scaled cock into view, he pulled out the pen and notepad, before reaching into his briefcase to get a book, both to read and hide his actions.  The moment he was ready, he wrote:  <br />
<br />
‘The driver will become an anthropomorphic panther while the woman to my right becomes an anthropomorphic lioness with her breasts doubled in size.  The driver will keep her work uniform other than her bra and underwear, whereas the woman next to me will be dressed only in her heels and overcoat but will keep her handbag and any accessories she might have.  Nobody will notice me looking at them unless I explicitly call their attention to me.’  <br />
<br />
He kept his attention on the woman opposite himself, watching her hair recede into her as tawny fur sprouted on her head.  Much the same thing happened to her legs (that Dave could see) as her trousers faded away to show her furred legs and feet, bare other than the heels which remained, as her new tail slid out from the bottom of her emerald-green overcoat.  Its thickness made it impossible for the casual observer to know if she had anything on underneath, but Dave did see that it was pushing outwards to compensate for her enlarging bust, the new shape allowing a good amount of cleavage to be seen.  And in all that time, all she’d done was turn a page of her own book that she was reading, oblivious to the change she’d undergone.  <br />
<br />
Looking ahead for a moment, Dave could make out the back of the driver’s head.  Thick with jet-black fur, her covered back, indicating that she had kept her clothes as he’d spelt out.  <br />
<br />
At the next stop, the bus filled up to a little over half-full, and Dave wondered about what to do next.</p>
