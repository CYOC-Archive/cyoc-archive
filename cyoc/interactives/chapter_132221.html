<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden did always really like how demons looked in his video games he played. His favorite character to play in his online game was a rather slender one that was black and white and could fly.  Aiden quickly knew what he wanted to do. <br />
<br />
Aiden moved the pleasure sliders back to where they were when Geoff set them and left his room. He then made the changes to his body&#39;s shape so he would be incredibly slender and agile but also decided to balloon out his butt a bit more. If I&#39;m going to be a sex doll forever I might as well be a twink. He thought to himself and wanted to blush as he thought of how good it felt when Geoff pounded him on the bed. Aiden then added a super-tight pair of rubber boxer shorts to his body for decency purposes when he had to go outside that could be rolled down onto his legs but were otherwise completely unremoveable from his body so he wouldn&#39;t ever loose them. he made the waist and leg bands crimson red and the main part jet black with no pouch in front and went for a thickness of 1.5 mm on his shorts. Aiden then gave himself some jet black rubber spiked bracers and shin guards both for protection of his limbs and for their style. Done with is clothing choice, he moved on to designing his head.<br />
<br />
Aiden decided to go with a younger looking head for his twinkish body and up-scaled it a bit so his appearance would better match his actual age. He gave himself solid black eyes and a pearl white skin for his whole body, and black eyelashes. he decided to modify his hair to be latex rubber and flow down to his ankles before turning it jet black with blood red highlights to match his shorts. He then decided to give himself jet black hard plastic claws instead of fingernails and toenails on his hands and feet so he could defend himself a bit better having so little strength. Aiden then gave himself two massive jet black rubber wings and a valve in between his shoulder blades that could inflate them separately and gave himself a plastic zipper in his back so that his wings could be folded into him. <br />
<br />
While picking the zipper option, Aiden caught his eye on having his body have an inner cavity for someone to be able to step into him and wear him like a big inflatable rubber suit, like someone would a mascot, his rubber body would stretch to fit them perfectly if they stepped into him. With an aroused smile, he turned on the option. After clicking yes, Aiden saw a second option pop up for lubricating sweat for when he was aroused or overworked, that would keep his plastic and rubber body from dry-rotting indefinitely and polish him to a fine rubbery shine and would also act as a easy slide lube for when people put him on or shagged him. Aiden quickly clicked Yes to the option before continuing to program his changes. <br />
<br />
Aiden gave himself a slender and 4 and a half foot long black rubber tail with a spade head barb on it made of solid jet black plastic and two big inflatable horns on the top of his head that smoothly curved back that were about a foot in length he then added 5 jet black rubbery curved spikes to petrude from his spine to match is black horns. He then added some solid jet black plastic demon teeth that could hide in his rubbery lips before choosing to change the inside of his mouth blood red and keep his tongue. A pop up suddenly flew open again asking if he would like the taste of cum and piss and other bodily experiments as well as desolve them once swallowed. he clicked yes. then another pop up asked if he would like for his mouth to give suction when taking dick. He again clicked yes and also ticked the same for his anus. <br />
<br />
Now focused on his more private areas, he decided to make his dick 12 inches when fully inflated and kept the internal valve that would let his dick be able to inflate by sucking air or other substances into his ass and kept the orgasm it out function. Aiden also added the functionality of his ass to act as a second entrance to his inner cavity when worn or if his zipper was down, so his lucky wearer could get fucked with him when he takes an anal barrage again. A pop up asked if he would like to do the same with his mouth. he clicked yes and auto-condom his wearers anus, mouth and penis with his own rubbery parts. He clicked yes. <br />
<br />
Finally Aiden moved onto his overall body, he moved his primary air valve to his belly button and turned on auto-inflate option and lowered the setting to the shortest time possible after no activity to 30 minutes and on-command so he could trigger it when he wanted and made the auto-inflate for his penis 30 seconds after no activity and on command. A warning popped up saying that auto-inflating of his body wouldn&#39;t work unless he had room to do so. he clicked OK. Aiden then enabled bodily vibrations so with every movement his body would vibrate and let out faint tight rubbery squeaks with every physical activity he did. he then added paper thin powerful vibrators to his ass, penis and mouth that were to be enbedded into his latex skin. Speaking of latex, aiden turned every part of his body into 3mm thick latex besides his teeth, claws, tail barb, and air valves. before turning his primary skin pearl white. Aiden turned up the thickness of his latex hands and feet as well as other parts of his body that would often receive physical contact to 4.5mm thick. Aiden then turned on the latex squeaker in his mouth but made it only for medium to heavy impacts. And lastly gave himself latex vocal cords that would work when he pulled air though his nose and blew it out of his mouth which would give him a functional squeaky rubbery human-like voice, unfortunately his airway meant going through the squeaker, so any attempt to scream would result in a dog toyish squeak. But he was ok with that. Aiden then decided to make himself exactly 6 ft tall from the top of his head, excluding his horns to the bottom of his feet. he then removed all body hair from his rubbery skin, the only hair he would have is his flowing latex locks. lastly, aiden raised his elasticity to the highest the cronivac would let him go, 1000% of his length width or height in any dimension of his body parts. A pop up flew up to ask if he could be over-inflated to reach this size, Aiden thought for a moment then clicked no. the cronivac chirped saying that his elasticity was set to being stretched by non-inflationary outside sources only and he could not do it on his own. With a bit of a sigh, Aiden clicked ok. Then turned his rubber body&#39;s durability all the way up to maximum so he would last for as long as possible, if not hopefully forever.<br />
<br />
Aiden then checked then double checked over his options one final time before clicking the big green OK button. The final pop up showed up asking for the duration of the change and the duration of the transformation. Aiden took one deep breath before clicking, PERMANENT for the duration of change, and instant for the duration of transformation. Finally he checked the box for NO ADDITIONAL CHANGES ALLOWED. Then squinted and pressed ENTER. <br />
<br />
Aiden suddenly felt his body expanding and warping instantly into the rubbery demon from his games he always drempt of with a tight twisting and loud rubbery squeak and ending in a plungery POP! Aiden fell out of the chair as his body launched up into the air as his wings forced him out of his seat and unfurled, allowing him to softly float onto the bed. his body landed and rubbed against the sheets which instantly tingled his entire being, his body landing with a faint squeak. He gasped to the sound or a long rubbery stretch and a faint squeak from his squeaker. Aiden then tried moving his arms and hands to check himself once over with rubbery creaks and moans coming from his super-tight skin. Aiden let out squeaky rubber belches of moans as he rubbed his hand over his torso and down his thighs before reaching around and grabbing his ass checks and with a sharp toy like squeak gave them a squeeze. Aiden instantly arched back and pushed his groin high up in the air and let out loud rubbery moans that sounded like a twink boy mixed with stretching of many rubber bands. Aiden felt his body quickly spiraling to high arousal as his skin started to secrete gloss.<br />
<br />
He let go of his ass and let himself calm down as he flopped back onto the bed with a bit of a bounce and more rubbery squeaks. He then sat up on the edge of the bed, his body creaked loudly as he sat up. &quot;Every single thing i do feels like an orgasm! I love this new body!&quot; Aiden screamed with his tight rubbery voice. &quot;only one last thing to do now... Escape!&quot; He said getting up onto his feet. <br />
<br />
His inflatable rubber body surprisingly was able to hold him up with extremely good balance. He squeaked his way over to the Cronivac and unplugged it. &quot;Sianara!&quot; He said picking it up. &quot;Now what to do with this miserable piece of shit.&quot; Aiden looked around the room and saw the door Geoff locked and a window he could try to crawl out of to escape, and the large closet he could hide in. No way to get the door open but he might be able to pick it with his claws, who knows? The window would be the best option to escape and he could drop the Cronivac from a great height and watch it smash to pieces now that he could fly, but someone would definitely see him if he left right now and it still being daylight. But if the hid in the closet, Geoff would find him with his machine but he&#39;d have to unlock the door first to get in and he might be able to escape....<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, what to do, what to do, got to think of something quick...&quot; he said rubbing his chin with his squeaky rubber hand. Aiden pondered for a moment before making his decision and then took one good look into Geoffs wall mirror to admire his rubbery form. &quot;Damn I look good, If I&#39;m gonna be stuck like this forever, then I&#39;m going to enjoy every last second of it completely once I get out of here.&quot; He said smerking with his squeaky rubbery voice and making his aroused latex rubber body stretch and creak posing in the mirror before moving on with his plan.<br />
