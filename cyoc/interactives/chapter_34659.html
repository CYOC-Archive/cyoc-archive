<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Imagine myself smaller...what the hell are you talking about, Guy??  What is going on?  I can't see anything, my pecs are too big!&quot;<br />
&quot;PLEASE, Cray, just try!&quot; Guy said, exasperated as his body pumped up another 10 pounds in a single breath, forcing Guy to adjust his stance yet again as his engorged thighs pressed into one another fighting for room.  Guy was still trying desperately to regain control of his subconscious and halt the immense growth of his muscles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit!&quot; Guy exclaimed as he felt his rock hard abs suddenly bow forcefully outwards, making way for the start of what looked to become a large muscle gut, or at least thats how it would look if Guy had been able to see over his gigantic, shelf-like pecs.<br />
&quot;If you say so!&quot; Cray said, still unsure of what was going on.  Cray concentrated hard, repeating over and over again in his mind, 'I want to be 280 pounds, I want to be 280 pounds!'  After several moments, Cray began to feel lighter.  It was working!  Guy was right!  Soon he felt himself able to move his elbows, then his neck, then his knees, and finally his waist, as his body slowly shrank down to a more manageable, but still VERY large 280 pounds.  Cray pushed himself up off the floor into a sitting position and looked up at his growing friend.<br />
<br />
He was IMMENSE.  Starting at his head and chiseled face, Cray moved down Guy's titanic, and still growing body.  Guy had virtually no neck to speak of, as it was quickly disappearing into his wide and thick traps, which rose up to his ears.  His shoulders looked as if two large watermelons had been inserted under the skin, and were several feet wide, much too wide to fit through any average door frame.  Guy's arms were equally impressive, with biceps the size of most heavyweight bodybuilders' quads, and still growing, with forearms that were nearly as large and still growing.  Guy's pecs were practically brushing his chin, and the crevice between the two mountains of meat looked to be several inches deep.  His rock hard stomach bowed out, but not as much as Cray's had, and featured the chiseled 8-pack that even the most hard-core bodybuilders envy.  Beneath that were Guy's straining boxer briefs, pulling hard against his crotch and showing off his bulge, while tightening across his ridiculous bubble butt, which popped out from his back like a shelf.  The legs of the boxer briefs had ridden up Guy's mammoth quads, much like Cray's had done, making it appear as though Guy was wearing briefs, or a pair of crumpled posing trunks.  All this sat upon two gargantuan tree-trunk legs, chiseled and rock hard, pressing hard into each other, while growing out several inches away from the front and sides of each leg.  Guy's calves were also immense, looking like two over-pumped footballs sticking out the back.  And all of this was still blowing up larger with every breath Guy took, reaching, and surpassing 450 pounds, already 50 pounds heavier than he had ever been, frankly, Guy was surprised at his ability to move as much as he was.<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Cray whispered.<br />
Guy, not wanting to collapse to the floor as Cray had done, looked at the couch.  &quot;Dude, I gotta get to the couch before I can't move any more and fall over like you did,&quot; He said to Cray, &quot;you gotta help me!&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Cray jumped to his feet, nearly loosing his stretched-out boxers, which were now nearly too big for him.  Cray grabbed a hold of Guy's humongous left bicep with both hands, and still was barely able to get a grip around the basketball-sized slab of beef.  &quot;Alright, ready for your first step?&quot; Cray asked.  Breathing heavily out, Guy said, &quot;yea, I'm ready.&quot;  Slowly, Guy lifted his massive, and still swelling left leg, and carefully rolled it around his other and equally massive right leg, taking care to firmly plant his foot on the floor before shifting his immense weight onto it.  &quot;Wow.  That was hard!&quot; Guy said.  &quot;Your telling me!&quot; Cray replied, &quot;If you start to go, there's no way in hell I'm strong enough to keep it from happening!  Now just one more step and your there!&quot;  &quot;Right.&quot; Guy said, and now, with much greater difficulty, lifted his right leg, tried to roll it around his left, however, he had forgotten to take into account he was still growing, and that he needed to lift it higher than last time to account for his newly accumulated muscle, nearly stumbling as his oversized thighs collided with one another, he took one heavy step, cracking the wood floor beneath him, and fell onto the sofa with a loud 'BANG!'  The sofa cracked in half under the enormous weight as Guy settled into it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great...&quot; Cray said, &quot;now I'll have to get a new coffee table AND a new sofa!&quot;  Ignoring him, Guy breathed heavily as the last 200 pounds piled onto his already immense and engorged physique, locking his joints into place and rendering him immobile as Cray had been only moments before.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank god,&quot; Guy said, &quot;it's over...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and since you won't be going anywhere anytime soon, would you mind telling me just WHY I, then you turned into an immobile muscle monster?&quot; Cray asked, with a hint of anger in his voice.</p>
