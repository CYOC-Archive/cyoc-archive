<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Keep him in line?&quot; I asked curiously turning to my mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should know your father well enough by now to know that the &quot;teen&quot; in him has not fully grown up,&quot; Polly Wayne replied, &quot;and to our knowledge, this is the farthest Jackson has gotten with anyone. So I'm counting on you to make sure he doesn't bring some barmaid home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you tell him not to,&quot; I pointed out, &quot;it'd be odd for me to command him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not supposed to know about this, George,&quot; Polly Wayne winked, &quot;I'm supposed to be having a calm night taking with your Uncle-in-Law. So, I'm counting on you to keep your father in line.&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave a nervous gulp as my father came in the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there, George, have a good day?&quot; Jacob Wayne asked as he came in and then kissed his wife on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe so,&quot; I answered, &quot;Molly and I got everything done that we needed to. Vaccinations and all. All that is left really as an errand for us is to restock our igloo with rare meat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That can wait a day or two, can't it?&quot; Jacob Wayne asked, &quot;I had thought to bring you on a guy's night out. Mr. Rhoer is welcome to come, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll stay here,&quot; Frank Rhoer slowly, &quot;I'm still a little frustrated with the argument I had with my brother. I wouldn't be good company.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as it was only an argument,&quot; Jacob Wayne replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was... though I'm sure your neighbors had reason to complain,&quot; Frank Rhoer said weakly, &quot;I'm afraid we weren't that quiet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob Wayne only shrugged and then turned back to me.<br />
<br />
&quot;So it's just you, me, and a few others from the station,&quot; Jacob Wayne commented, &quot;You can regale the group with how your department does things in the wild west.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The &quot;wild west&quot; died a long time ago,&quot; I commented, &quot;we aren't that different from any other police department.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh go on, son,&quot; Polly Wayne urged, &quot;He seems to be excited about something. Probably to help Jackson out before the wedding. Have a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen to your mother,&quot; Jacob Wayne said with a smirk and ushered me out the door he had come in.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
I climbed into the backseat of my fathers car and lay across the seat while Jackson sat quietly in his seat. Jacob was quick to sit down behind the wheel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jackson, you remember my son?&quot; Jacob Wayne spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We did meet briefly when I had to bring Leona up to Columbia Falls,&quot; Jackson said slowly, &quot;still as big as he was then...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like I'll shrink in the wash,&quot; I quipped from the backseat, &quot;and you have my congratulations for your coming wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jackson said slowly, &quot;and you are still with Molly, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nodded, &quot;she's here to be a &quot;bridesmaid&quot; for Leona.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson nodded as my father backed up his car.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as important as that is,&quot; Jacob Wayne commented, &quot;tonight is to let Jackson celebrate his coming marriage and enjoy his last days of freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea, dad?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't all my plan,&quot; Jacob Wayne shrugged, &quot;the whole department put it together. And it won't be like anyone will be taking the &quot;wrong&quot; person home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly is going to kill me,&quot; I grumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if you don't tell her,&quot; Jacob Wayne replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Mom?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She doesn't know about this,&quot; Jacob Wayne replied.<br />
<br />
That I chalked up to my parents' long marriage to each other. How my mother knew about this bachelor party, I don't know, and I wasn't going to go into that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And we'll be fine,&quot; Jacob Wayne then continued, &quot;there should be no nudity in this adventure, so Molly has no room to complain about you cheating on her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would never...&quot; I began to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, son,&quot; Jacob Wayne smirked, &quot;you're too decent a person to do that... but that doesn't mean that there will be suspicions.&quot; He then flashed me a knowing smile, &quot;trust me. I gave a woman directions once, and your mother caught it. The woman had a larger bust line then your mother and I ended up in the doghouse for about a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How'd you get out of it, sir?&quot; Jackson asked slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;To put it simply, I begged and begged until Polly forgave me,&quot; Jacob Wayne sighed, &quot;George was born nine months later. True story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom doesn't tell the story that way...&quot; I warned.<br />
<br />
&quot;George, just because one has class does not mean that what one does is not begging,&quot; Jacob Wayne laughed, &quot;You'll probably learn this as you and Molly move toward your next great adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly isn't in heat right now, and won't be until the winter,&quot; I groaned, earning a snicker.<br />
<br />
This was going to be harder then I thought.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The party went far cleaner then I had anticipated. It was held at a local Hooters, but there was no nudity involved. Jackson had quietly let me out when we arrived.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said to him as I got out.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is no problem,&quot; Jackson said with a somewhat resigned tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you're willing to go through with this?&quot; I asked, &quot;Leona has told Molly and I about your idea to help her get her instincts in order.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't know what she's struggled with,&quot; Jackson then said, &quot;when it started between us... I suppose it was pity... but I found her to be incredibly intelligent and a just person... regardless of her fur. I'm not entirely too keen on becoming a lioness... but if it helps Leona, I'd do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sort of reminded me of how I thought of Molly. I would do anything for her. However, I wasn't asking Jackson about his devotion to Leona.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was referring to being here,&quot; I commented glancing toward the restaurant's trademark sign, &quot;I mean if everything goes well, you will be female with your own breasts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Jackson sighed, &quot;I suppose it is odd that this is where the others decided to go... but for the moment your dad and one or two others are the only ones who know what I want to do to help Leona.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're okay with it?&quot; I asked quietly as we entered and met by a young woman in the Hooters uniform.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; Jackson sighed, &quot;and besides... they're doing all of this special. Might as well let them have a good time after all the work they've done to set this up.&quot;<br />
<br />
I could only shrug as we followed the waitress to a large round table with several other officers seated around. Some of them I recognized as people who had worked with my father, most of the rest I didn't know.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here he is, the guest of honor... and our security blanket,&quot; one man smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Security blanket?&quot; Jackson asked, glancing between me and the man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who do you think is going to mess with a tiger?&quot; the man quipped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not many,&quot; I replied with a smirk of my own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ordered yet?&quot; Jacob Wayne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we were waiting for you three,&quot; a different man answered, and then turned to a passing waitress, &quot;excuse me, I believe we're ready now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she nodded, &quot;what can I get for you gentlemen... and tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orders then went through. The side dishes varied from person to person, but we ended up with on main course dish. Hot wings, and enough of them were ordered to make sure that there was enough meat for me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, George,&quot; Jacob Wayne whispered to me, &quot;this is on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
While we waited for our orders to arrive, the officers that were waiting for us congratulated Jackson, though some of it sounded forced. A few others asked questions of me, mostly curious about how I manage to function in Montana. I replied honestly and let things go fairly well, while drinking from a glass of water placed in font of me.<br />
<br />
And despite being surrounded by women in tight clothing, I did not have the rise that some of the other officers there seemed to be getting. Not that they were physically unattractive to the eye... they were... but I realized they lacked something that my mind was attracted to. They lacked a tigress's scent. It surprised me to find out that my libido now focused more on scent then it did visual stimulation, but scents were important to nearly every animal And as the discussions flowed, part of my mind wondered if Molly thought I smelled attractive.</p>
