<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Terry picked up the young boy, caring him into the other room and sitting in front of the television. “Okay Duke,” Terry said sternly. “I want you to sit here and stay out of trouble.”<br />
<br />
“No fair,” Duke whined. “I want to play mister.”<br />
<br />
“No buts young man,” Terry frowned. “Stay here and don’t touch those lots anymore or your going to be in big trouble.” Duke frowned as Terry now exited the room. Hopping off the couch Duke stuck his tongue out at Terry. “Stupid grownups,” he thought. As he glanced out he could see Terry readying himself for someone’s arrival. Although Duke couldn’t quite remember who was coming over, it appeared Duke would be left by himself. Already feeling bored the boy looked over to where Terry had placed the lots. An impish smile now crossed his face, if Terry didn’t want him to touch them then they must be fun.<br />
<br />
Quietly Duke now tiptoed out of the room, glancing over at the front door as Terry now greeted two women. Duke stuck out is tongue in a mock retch as he could see Terry talk with them. Terry was probably going to kiss them or do something gross like that. As he reached the shelf where the lots were located he looked up. Even standing on tiptoes Duke would have a hard time reaching them. As he looked around for something to help him he noticed an umbrella sitting close by. Duke could use that umbrella to easily knock the lots down. Then he could have fun with them. Grabbing the umbrella Duke now began sweeping the shelf trying to get the lots to fall. A smile now crossed Dukes young face as he saw the lots fall, clattering to the floor.<br />
<br />
Terry was still trying to explain his appearance to both Sarah and Jessie. While both women were astounded that Terry appeared 10 years younger, they wanted to know where Duke was. Terry was still unable to explain his friends absence. As he was about to speak he suddenly shuttered, a feeling of warmth overcoming him. “Oh fuck,” he moaned. Grimacing and moaning in pleasure Terry turned towards Sarah and Jessie, noticing their eyes growing wide.<br />
<br />
If Sarah and Jessie hadn’t viewed this with their own eyes they would never have believed it. Terry was growing younger. The 32 year old mans face was becoming smoother, more youthful with each passing second. Terry’s muscles seemed to swell, becoming bulkier and more defined as he aged backwards. The maturity of his face vanishing as he became a young man of 24. “Terry what the hell is going on,” Jessie exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“Um nothing,” Terry said quickly, his body still trembling from the experience. “It’s like I said. I found some lots that make you younger.”<br />
<br />
“But your still growing younger,” Sarah whispered. “You look like your in your early twenties.”<br />
<br />
“That’s impossible,” Terry lies, knowing that somehow the lots were still affecting him. As Terry tried to speak again another wave of pleasure enveloped him. The young man groaning in ecstasy as he grew younger once again. Terry’s body was rapidly leaving his 20s now. The bulk and definition of his muscles slowly being eroded as time raced backwards. Terry’s already smooth face began to round, giving him an almost boysih appearance. Terry was now just a boy of 18 again, his face smooth with no lines and no trace of stubble. As he breathed deeply, trying to recover he smiled. “So what do you think,” he grinned, not seeming to notice the youthfulness of his tone. “You two want to come in? Maybe try the lots yourself? Maybe do something else?”<br />
<br />
“Terry,” Jessie stated in almost motherly tone. “Look at yourself, your a kid now. You look like you belong in high school. Why would we roll the lots and why would we want to do anything with a kid?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a kid,” Terry replied indignantly. “I mean yeah I might look a little younger but it’s still me. Cmon Sarah, Jess, you guys were coming over to you know...” <br />
<br />
Terry trailed off a bit, blushing slightly as he looked at the two adult women. Why did they seem so much older? Also why were his clothes so much looser on his body? Terry’s shorts seemed to be quite baggy around the waist now, the boy having to adjust them regularly to keep them on his narrower hips. As he tried to talk again he gasped.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Jessie watched as the 18 year old boy began to grow younger yet again. Terry was trying to say something as he grew younger, the boy stammering as his body began to youthen. Terry’s muscles were shrinking yet again as the boy inched closer to childhood. The two women watched as Terry began to grow smaller, inches slowly melting off his body as his muscles became smaller. Now a stocky but strong boy of 14 stood in front of the two women. Terry blinked as he gazed at Sarah and Jessie. “Hey wasn’t I taller than both of you,” he said in a cracking pubescent voice. “How come we’re the same size?”<br />
<br />
Terry turned around in confusion before locking eyes with an 8 year old Duke. The blond 8 year old was giggling as he gazed at the 14 year old boy. “Hey what are you doing,” Terry whined. “Stop that, somehow got is happening to me? I’m...I’m getting smaller.”<br />
<br />
Terry’s mind was jumbled. Hadn’t he been bigger? It was hard to remember. Looking between the girls and duke he tried to put things together. Wasn’t he suppose to be going on a date with them? The idea made the boy blush, he had only kissed a couple of girls, noe of which had been grownups. Watching Duke laugh he had a feeling the young boy was doing something to him. A thought crossed Terry’s rapidly regressing mind, Duke was turning him into a little kid.<br />
<br />
Duke giggled as he looked at the teen, he had been shocked to see Terry grow younger. Now that Terry was only a teenager he hoped that maybe him and Terry could play. All Duke needed to do was roll the lots again. <br />
<br />
“No,” Terry whined as he saw Duke throw the lots once more. The feeling overcame Terry once more as his body began to youthen once more. Terry’s muscles began to shrink again as his height dwindled once more. Looking at Sarah and Jessie he watched horror struck as he saw the two women seeming to grow taller than him.<br />
<br />
“Make it stop,” the 12 year old Terry whined. “I don’t want to be little, I don’t want to be little.” Terry began to cry softly, his voice losing any adult tenor as he descended into childhood. Sarah and Jessie watched as Terry grew younger, puberty abandoning the young boy as he shrank from 12 to 10 in almost no time. Terry’s muscles seemed to vanish, his height diminishing as he grew younger. Wiping his eyes the child looked up at Sarah and Jessie, his face becoming cherubic as he entered single digits. Terry was now a slightly chubby boy of nine, tall for his age but a child none the less.<br />
<br />
Terry continued growing smaller, his age and height continueing to diminish. The third grader quickly became a second grader, then a first grader. Terry was now a slightly chubby seven year old, his face round with a round none muscular body. Terry’s massive shorts and T-shirt seemed to swallow the young boy as he cried and reached up for Sarah and Jessie. As the regression completed Duke approached. Terry now turned his head, finding he was shorter than the now older boy.<br />
<br />
“Cool your little now,” Duke said. Terry sniffed as he looked first at Duke before turning towards Jessie and Sarah. “Here lady you can have these,” Duke said as he placed the lots in Sarah’s hand. “I’m going to go play with Terry.”<br />
Duke now took Terry’s young hand as he guided the boy towards another room. As Terry gazed back at the two women he had the strangest feeling he was supposed to be a grownup like them. For now though playing with a bigger kid seemed like a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
Sarah and Jessie said nothing as an 8 year old Duke and 7 year old Terry now disappeared. The two adult men they knew had been reduced to a pair of young kids. Now holding the lots Sarah and Jessie tried to decide what to do.</p>
