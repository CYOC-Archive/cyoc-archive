<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#39;Whoa! Somethings happening&#39; Jeff heard Mark somehow talking to him. <br />
<br />
&#39;The girls are probably getting ready to go to bed&#39; suggested Jeff. &#39;We&#39;ll soon find out&#39;<br />
<br />
They could feel the swaying motion of movement once more. whoever had picked them up was carrying the purse. Then very close by Gabby spoke: &#39;I&#39;ve got some new lipsticks and eye-shadow. Anyone want to try?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Show me&#39; said a nearby voice. That sounded like Millicent. She was the daggy girl in the group. She was slightly overweight and had a pretty awful pimple problem. <br />
<br />
The bag was unzipped once more and giant fingers fingers enveloped Jeff. He was lifted out. It took a few moments for his vision to adjust to the sudden brightness, not that he actually had eyes anymore. However he did appear to have vision in all directions. &#39;I have cherry, blueberry, caramel, apricot and lollipop flavors&#39; Gabby said. Jeff was in her apparently huge hands. He was excited by her touch. Gabby&#39;s head filled his view. <br />
<br />
&#39;Could I try the Caramel?&#39; asked Susan&#39;s voice. <br />
<br />
&#39;And I would like to try the blueberry&#39; asked Maria<br />
<br />
&#39;Sure&#39; said Gabby. Jeff was momentarily placed on a hard white surface. He realised he was on a bathroom bench. Now to one side he could see 5 girls squeezed into the bathroom and their reflections in a mirror. He watched as Gabby deposited 5 other lipstick tubes beside him. He realised he was a silver lipstick tube with a red lid. The other lipsticks were also silver but with different coloured lids. <br />
<br />
To Marc he somehow communicated &#39;I&#39;m the red tube. Which one are you?&#39;<br />
<br />
Marc replied &#39;I have a light brown lid&#39; Jeff quickly located the lipstick tube which Marc had changed into.<br />
<br />
They watched as a dark brown lidded tube was picked up. The tube was given to Susan who took off the lid and twisted the tube. From it emerged some dark brown lipstick, matching the colour on the lid. Susan applied it to her lips. &#39;Mmm I like the taste but I&#39;m not sure about the colour&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Let me try the pink one&#39; said Linda &#39;The colour will go with my dress&#39; The boys got the first glimpse of Linda&#39;s dress. It was bright pink and hung to her curves, She did look like a sex goddess, a giant sex goddess from the boys perspective. They watched as the tube that had been between the two boys was picked up and Linda applied it to her lips. <br />
<br />
Jeff now had a good view of Marc. &#39;Wow! We are tubes of lipstick. I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s you. How can we see? We don&#39;t have eyes&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I agree it&#39;s weird. But we got here. We are at the girls slumber party. I told you I would find a way to get here&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m not sure the experience so far justifies the effort&#39; said Jeff &#39;Time goes so slowly when you are locked up in a purse&#39;<br />
<br />
Suddenly a voice boomed again. It was Gabby. &#39;I&#39;m going to try the apricot. I&#39;ve never seen apricot lipstick before&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Looks like I&#39;m up&#39; said Marc. He was picked up. Gabby took off his lid. &#39;Oh that&#39;s different&#39; said Marc &#39;I&#39;ve been separated. Half of me is now on the bench. I can see myself&#39; <br />
<br />
Then Gabby twisted the tube and the light brown waxy lipstick that was now Marc emerged from the tube. &#39;Holy shit! That felt wonderful&#39; Marc&#39;s thoughts felt so loud to Jeff who was still lying on the bench watching what was happening. <br />
<br />
Gabby began to apply Marc to her lips. &#39;Aaargh! Aaargh! I think I&#39;m cumming!&#39; Marc clearly was doing the equivalent of ejaculating. The noises coming from him were over the top. As Gabby&#39;s lips began to get coloured light brown the thoughts coming from Marc degenerated into guttural sounds. Jeff could not shut them out. It was a relief when Gabby was finished and Marc was twisted back into his tube and his lid put back on. A still heavily panting Marc was placed back beside Jeff.<br />
<br />
&#39;That was the most awesome experience of my life&#39; said Marc between heavy breaths. &#39;Sorry Jeff. I know you have always fancied her but I&#39;m now in love with Gabby&#39;<br />
<br />
Gabby now spoke. &#39;The colour is actually okay, I think it goes with my hair but I&#39;m not sure about the apricot flavour. It&#39;s pretty weak&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Can I try one?&#39; This was Millicent. Who had just squeezed into the room.<br />
<br />
&#39;Go for the cherry&#39; suggested Gabby.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh no&#39; said Jeff &#39;Trust my luck. What do they say about lipstick on a pig?&#39; Jeff knew that Millicent had a hard time and he shouldn&#39;t be rude about her. But all the popular kids were always rude to Millicent. She was a girl who was generally ostracized at school. She had a short boy style haircut and everyone at school called her a leso.  Her hair was only short as some of the bully girls at school used her head as a place to deposit their used chewing gum. It was only that Linda&#39;s and Millicent&#39;s Mum&#39;s were best friends that Millicent had scored an invite to the party. <br />
<br />
However being in Millicent&#39;s grasp actually felt good to Jeff. When she took off his lid it felt really strange. Suddenly he could see himself from different perspectives. He could see part of himself back on the bathroom bench and from that part watch the rest of himself still in Millicent&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
Millicent gave him a twist and Jeff appeared from his silver plastic tube. To Jeff it felt like getting a sudden huge erection. He gasped in pleasure. &#39;Wow!&#39; <br />
<br />
Then Millicent bought Jeff to her face. Jeff got a closeup view of the pimples on her chin and smelt her bad breath. &#39;What had she been eating?&#39; But that wasn&#39;t enough to stop Jeff from being excited. When he was touched to Millicent&#39;s lips it felt like he was ejaculating. Not that Jeff had ever experienced sex but it was like the wet dreams he often had, only better, much better. He jazzed his red colouring all over Millicent&#39;s magnificent lips. He realised he was moaning uncontrollably. And it went on and on. Every time Millicent withdrew him from her lips to pucker at the mirror, he was momentarily disappointed. He needed to get back to this magnificent woman. When she resumed applying him Jeff would ejaculate some more red colouring to her lips.<br />
<br />
Jeff was totally exhausted by the time Millicent put his lid back on and lay him on the bench. Like Marc earlier he appeared to be breathing so heavily. He admitted to Marc that Millicent now had his undying love.  It felt even better when he heard Millicent&#39;s lovely tones explaining &#39;I love it. This is the best lipstick I have ever tried. Where did you buy it from Gabby? I want to get some&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;They were on special at K-Mart, but don&#39;t bother. You can keep that tube&#39; replied Gabby.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh thanks Gabby&#39; Jeff&#39;s angel replied. He felt himself being picked up once more then squeezed into Millicent&#39;s jeans pocket. It was a very tight fit and he found himself back in the dark, next to a snotty tissue but he didn&#39;t care, he was with his love.<br />
<br />
&#39;Okay we have done the lips. What are we going to do with our hair? Could you braid me Gabby?&#39; Jeff heard Susan ask as he slowly recovered his awareness. <br />
<br />
&#39;Marc? Can you still hear me?&#39; Jeff asked<br />
<br />
&#39;Barely. I&#39;ve lost sight of you and Millicent. I think she has left the bathroom&#39; Marc sounded a million miles away.  &#39;That was pretty disgusting dude. Did you really get so excited about being put on Millicent?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Shut up Marc. Don&#39;t dis my woman&#39; Jeff replied.<br />
<br />
&#39;Each to their own&#39; Marc&#39;s voice was barely audible now. <br />
<br />
Indeed Millicent had gone back to Linda&#39;s room and was retrieving her handbag. She wasn&#39;t staying the night. Jeff remained in Millicent&#39;s pocket as he heard her saying goodbye to the other girls. Then it appeared Millicent&#39;s Mum picked her up and Jeff found himself between Millicent and a car seat. At least he could still hear Millicent&#39;s voice as she told her Mum about the party. He was particularly pleased when Millicent mentioned that Gabby had given her some &quot;really nice&quot; lipstick.<br />
<br />
At one stage Millicent farted and Jeff heard her say &#39;excuse me&#39; to her Mum. <br />
<br />
Jeff enjoyed being encapsulated by his loves aroma&#39;s. He couldn&#39;t believe it when Millicent&#39;s mother replied &#39;That&#39;s disgusting&#39;<br />
<br />
Once back at Millicent&#39;s house he accompanied his woman to her bedroom. It felt like the jeans he was in were left on the floor but he didn&#39;t care. He was Millicent&#39;s now.<br />
<br />
He listened all night to the sounds coming from her bed. To Jeff the steady rhythm of her snoring felt like an aphrodisiac. He couldn&#39;t wait until the next time that Millicent would apply him to her lips.</p>
