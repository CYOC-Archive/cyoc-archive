<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After skimming the instructions, the product contained within the box made Jacob intensely curious. Even if it was just a hoax, the instructions were way too elaborate not to at least play along with.<br />
<br />
Jacob glanced at his computer monitor, where he had his work queue pulled up remotely. No major incidents, not so much as a peep out of the mail server. He hadn&#39;t so much as been late in half a year; he was well within his rights to take a half day--or a full day if it needed to happen.<br />
<br />
He drafted up a quick email, claiming a headache that he hoped to get under control by lunch. And with that, he logged into his &quot;detonation chamber&quot; computer. He nicknamed it that because he would put just about anything that may be virus-ridden on there, to be completely purged and reformatted later. If this ended up being legit, he could easily migrate it out to his main computer. There was even a section in the instruction manual regarding transferring the software licenses.<br />
<br />
After all the preparations were complete, he progressed through a rather generic setup flow. He was a bit disappointed. ||Maybe this is a hoax after all?|| he thought to himself. After it installed, it cautioned that it may take a few minutes to finish setup, as it was &quot;gathering environmental vectors&quot; whatever that meant. Jacob was used to random mumbo-jumbo spewed by these programs trying to act stylishly or cutesy to pander to their nerd-centric audiences.<br />
<br />
It launched and presented Jacob with a launcher window. He was met with a single prompt with two options: &quot;Self&quot; or &quot;Others&quot;<br />
<br />
He decided to click &quot;Self&quot; and watched as the program loaded up. Two windows appeared, one with a list of categories, and another with a nude 3D loadout of his body with his arms extended outward T-Posing. He would be lying to himself if he didn&#39;t feel a little perturbed; there was no webcam hooked up anywhere near the detonation chamber. How did it get such an accurate nude model? Right down to every strand of hair. Despite the photorealism, the basic graphics card in this machine didn&#39;t seem to pay it much mind. ||More importantly...is this for real?|| He decided to consult the manual.<br />
<br />
Before becoming serious about his career in IT, Jacob had been a console QA tester for one of the larger companies. It was a thankless job, but he had picked up many good habits in regards to exploring unknown features of a piece of software. Especially in cases when provided with such a thorough manual.<br />
<br />
After about 30 minutes, Jacob had a good idea of what he could do--or at least what he wanted to test.<br />
<br />
He was curious about a few of the advanced parameters, especially &quot;Reality alteration&quot; and some of its sub-options. So he decided to set up a test. Without hesitation, he pulled off his pants, and snapped a quick dick pic of his average member. For his first test--as conservative as he was going to be--was still going to be rather major for most people.<br />
<br />
Without delay, he selected the &quot;Genitals&quot; category and began making a few changes. He decided to shorten his pubic hair by about 70%, leaving just a bit of fuzz. He also changed it to be a little less course. Next, he toggled &quot;Male&quot; to &quot;Female&quot; and was met with another prompt. &quot;Do you want to apply female body presets?&quot; Jacob clicked &quot;No&quot; He had a specific plan. Near the &quot;Apply changes&quot; section, there was a whole section regarding affecting reality. Things like globally applying the change--everyone would have the same body changes--to whether or not Jacob would remember his member.<br />
<br />
He decided to alter it so that reality would know/accept him as always having been this way, but his body would remain largely unchanged. Well, aside from his downstairs plumbing. It likely wouldn&#39;t last long--depending on the outcome. He made it so that while he would remember his original form, he would also have memories easily accessible of his life in the new reality. Had to avoid any awkwardness. This would likely become the default setting he&#39;d use going forward; unless he was feeling adventurous.<br />
<br />
He turned off pregnancy and the ability to catch STD&#39;s--just in case. He wasn&#39;t sure what the butterfly effect would look like for this change. Jacob hit &quot;Apply&quot; then sat in his computer chair with his legs splayed. After a few moments, he didn&#39;t notice any changes. ||Oh well, guess I got trolled. Wonder who took so much time and effort to make something like this?||<br />
<br />
Jacob got up and stretched, scratched his stomach, and felt the unmistakable call of nature. He meandered his way to the bathroom, a little bummed that he hadn&#39;t felt any grand transformation. As he got to the bathroom, he opened the lid to the toilet and spread his boxers as he sat down. She spread her dainty pussy a little so that he wouldn&#39;t have as much drip on the rim of her lips, and began relieving herself.<br />
<br />
||Wait, my dainty pussy?|| Jacob would have jolted if she really didn&#39;t want to piss all over the bathroom. ||I-it&#39;s real?!|| he almost couldn&#39;t believe it, if he didn&#39;t have both sets of memories, nestled snugly next to eachother. While she was finishing up, she pulled out her phone and looked at the most recent image. Sure enough; Jacob&#39;s penis had been replaced by a vagina!</p>
