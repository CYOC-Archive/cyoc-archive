<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sphinx looked at her reflection in the pond. She was certainly beautiful, at least that&#39;s what she thought of herself. Most humans would see her winged lioness body as something monstrous. Her human face was still beautiful, especially with her exotic feline features such as her cat&#39;s eyes, lioness ears, and catlike nose. Her long dark hair had an exquisite sheen and reached all the way down to cover most of her breasts. And her breasts were as full and perky as she had seen on any woman so far.<br />
<br />
Though as captivating as her new form was, she wondered if it could be enhanced any further. Even as a sphinx, curiosity was still a large part of her nature. She knelt down and started taking another drink from the pool. This was a little more awkward than before. For one thing, her human mouth wasn&#39;t built to lap water like before, even if her tongue remained as rough as before. Also, the way she crouched pushed her new breasts into the ground which caused some distracting sensations. As she was drinking, she noticed something shiny at the bottom of the pool. There were many jewels and nuggets of precious metal at the bottom of the pond. For rocks have often been knocked into the water and while rocks lack any ambition or any other kind of emotion, the pond was able to bring out the potential that lay within them and brought out the minerals and ores inside. The sphinx&#39;s interest was piqued and she reached in and scooped out a large gold nugget.<br />
<br />
It was not long after that she felt the tingle again. She sat up, inadvertently rubbing her nipples across the ground as she did. The tingling in her breasts was separate from the tingling in the rest of her, but the sphinx found it very enjoyable. She reached up with her forepaw and started rubbing at one breast. While it felt good, she soon became frustrated with her clumsy paw. In answer to that, her paw started changing. The toes became longer and thinner while her paw pads changed to a more appropriate shape. Her dewclaw slid further down her wrist before growing out into a new digit. What was once a clumsy lioness paw was now a humanlike hand that was able to grip and tweak her nipples far more easily.<br />
<br />
The sphinx looked as her other forepaw also became a hand, still retaining its claws, pads, and fur. The foreleg connected to it became slimmer like a woman&#39;s arm, though still covered in fur. She sat up straighter to get a better look, which prompted her spine and hips to alter themselves. Being upright felt more natural as her hips adjusted to a bipedal stance. Her hind legs changed to support her body, becoming stronger but also thicker in the right places.<br />
<br />
Her torso, which had retained most of its feline shape, started shrinking in on itself. Her shoulders became less broad, though still broad enough to accompany her wings. Her waist tapered in as more bare skin was exposed and her extra nipples disappeared. Her hips widened not just for better support, but to make a pleasing shape. The rear she was currently sitting on also plumped out into a beguiling shape. The tingling intensified in her pussy, which made the sphinx plunge her other hand into it. She moaned as she fingered it, feeling it become more universally accepting of other species. She had mated with tomcats before, but now she was craving something much bigger. A vague image of a man fucking her came into her head, which soon helped the sphinx go over the crest. She made a very human moan as she came for the first time as a higher creature.<br />
<br />
The sphinx looked into the pond again to see how much she had changed. Her head had remained unchanged, but everything below it was different. She was still a sphinx, but now a much more humanoid one. Beneath her lioness fur, she had the body of a comely woman. There was actually less fur as her stomach was now uncovered to reveal a trim midsection. Her feet remained mostly leonine, though better adapted to standing on two legs. Her arms were mostly human in shape, though they retained their fur. Her hands had pads on her palms and the underside of her fingers, which ended in retractable claws. As the sphinx posed and preened, she could see she wasn&#39;t just beautiful, but quite sexy as well.<br />
<br />
Of course, the second drink didn&#39;t just change her body. Her mind has been filled with more information, mostly about human society worked. And that knowledge told her she couldn&#39;t possibly just walk into town in her current state. It was less about her supernatural form and more about her undisguised nudity. But at a thought, the sphinx wrapped her wings around herself, which created a sufficient cloak around herself. Of course, she&#39;ll need to get proper clothes to cover herself. She looked at the nugget she had fished out of the pond and picked it up. Pure gold like this would be more than enough to buy clothes as well as fix up her hair. The sphinx was discovering she had a good amount of vanity and rightly so. She was a beautiful and exotic being now. And once she had the proper attire, she would be going to one of those magic universities to expand her knowledge.<br />
<br />
And she knew of a city where there would be tailors, hairdressers, universities, and banks to store her gold. And certainly some men who&#39;d give her the fucking she was just imagining. With a smile, the sphinx unfurled her wings and took off. There was a rush of excitement as she left the ground. There was certainly a lot of cold air passing over her bared skin. She&#39;ll need to wrap herself up in her wings as soon as she landed. But right now, it was off to the city.</p>
