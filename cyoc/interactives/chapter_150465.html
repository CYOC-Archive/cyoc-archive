<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was the first week of school and there was a lot of activities going on all over the school grounds. The various sports teams had been notified of their new team mates and were meeting them for the first time. Due to the recent reorganization of the school district,  many of them were new to the school due to the reorganizing.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Sandi Cobi was one of those recent transfers from a different school within the district. Being new to the school, Sandi was getting the-lay-of-the-land. Looking at the room assignment sheet, that was sent to her, it didn&#39;t surprise her that they had gotten her name wrong… again. The school district had reversed her name and had her first name as Cobi and her last name as Sandy, with a &quot;y&quot; not a &quot;i&quot;. <br />
<br />
Everything was new to her and now she was completely lost. In her old school she was quite the athlete. Somehow she had ended up at one of the schools locker rooms in the gymnazium. If she had been more observant she would have noticed the &quot;MEN LOCKER ROOM&quot; sign above the door.<br />
<br />
Still invisible, Ty and Dustin turned around when they heard the door open. They spotted a person entering the locker room, making a mad dash for the restroom. Ty and Dustin only had a brief glimpse of the figure as it turned the corner. The person was of average height at around 5&#39;6&quot;, with medium length blonde hair . Ty and Dustin didn&#39;t know much about the person, other than that they wore the school jersey and played sports, but the persons’ body was not the greatest, though a bit on the small side.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Sandi headed for what she thought was the restroom area of the locker room. The facilities were of very generic in design. Neither gender was represented in the restroom in the gymnazium due to the visiting sports team could be of either gender. After &quot;using-the-facilities&quot; Sandi headed out into the locker room area. She stopped and opened one of the lockers, to check out its size, and saw that it had a mens clothing in it. That is when she realized that she was in the boys locker room. However, once she opened the locker the spell went into effect on her, and began to randomly change her before she could leave.<br />
<br />
First, age. The spell had chosen to age Sandi by one year, which didn&#39;t really do much, though she did gain two inches of height. She grew from 5&#39;4&quot; to 5’6” in height.<br />
<br />
Sandi felt a tightening of her pants and reached for her belt and undid it by a few holes, the second part of the spell had gone into effect making her waist grew thicker. When she did so she turned to face the center of the locker room. Ty and Dustin were shocked to see that person changing in front of them was a girl!<br />
<br />
The two inches of gained height that the girl had gotten was instantly tripled, as she shot up 6” inches to an even 6 ft. The girl stumbled a bit from the sudden growth, but managed to stay standing. Her jersey, which previously hung off her body now was several inches shorter and exposed her belt for all to see. Her slim fit jeans looked much tighter and shorter as well, though they still remained fairly intact, they now looked like they were painted on. <br />
<br />
Looking down, Ty saw that girl&#39;s feet had grown in the transformation and had ripped through her shoes. So that must be the source of the ripping he had heard. Ty quickly amended the wish so that clothes would grow as well as the person, and watched as the girl&#39;s jersey, shorts and shoes all mended themselves as they all grew several sizes larger to accommodate the now 6 ft female… for now.<br />
<br />
The final part of the wish then went into effect, and it randomly choose 3x as the amount to boost in the genitals. The girl&#39;s jeans began to bulge out as a cock began to reel out of her groin, and balls, that dropped down behind it, began to inflate larger and larger. By the time the girl&#39;s cock finished growing, Ty was sure that she had no less than 17 inches of soft cock curled up  her underwear behind the extremely large and noticeable bulge in the front of her jeans. Her balls were equally impressive, each the size of a small softball.<br />
<br />
The estrogen in Sandi’s body was being replaced testosterone. She could feel her body changing into something she did not want. She fought like hell to keep herself as she was. She could feel her body growing stronger as her muscles grew bigger. Her “B” cup breasts began to deflate until she was flat chested. As she hyperventilated from the shock of her loss her chest began to increase in size with each breath. She thought she was getting her breasts back but these “mounds” were hard not soft like the previous ones. Her entire body was changing and there was nothing she could do about it.<br />
<br />
Both Ty and Dustin were amazed at what they were witnessing. A girl was changing into a boy, a very “big” boy, right before their eyes. She/he was beginning to freak out and started to scream very loudly. Ty had to act quickly before  someone else came in.      <br />
<br />
“FREEZE!” Ty shouted.  <br />
<br />
She/he froze in mid scream with her/his mouth wide open.<br />
<br />
“You will remain frozen until the transformation is completed,”  Ty said to the person in transition.“I am still new at this and I don’t think I can make anymore changes until the current transformation is complete. Do you understand?”   <br />
<br />
She/he was able to shake her/his head yes.<br />
<br />
Sandi was unable to move several more minutes.  Her body was changing into a male and she was beginning to like it. Her muscles grew bigger and bigger. She was growing a cock that any man would love to have. His body became stronger and more muscular minute by minute. Testosterone flowed through his body feeding his muscles to their max. The bulge that grew between his legs was bigger and longer than any other in the school. He was late for the tryouts before he got to the school. He was about to leave the locker room when two boys interrupted him.<br />
<br />
“You must be the new transfer from another school.” Ty was the first to speak as Sandy began to move once again.  He had read her mind while she was frozen and found out who she, now he was.<br />
<br />
“Ah… Yeah.” Sandy stood there for a moment, gathering his thoughts. He had come into the locker room for something but forgot what it was.<br />
<br />
Ty had made a wish while Sandy was froze and put him into an outfit more befitting his new body. A tank top that exposed the larger muscles of his upper torso and a loose fitting knee length nylon shorts that did little to hide what had grown in the jock underneath.<br />
<br />
“You better hurry up and get out to the field before the new Coach comes looking for you again.” Dustin said to Sandy.    <br />
<br />
“Yeah, thanks for the warning.” Sandy said as he picked up his stuff, still not noticing his changes, and headed for the door. He hit his head on the doorframe as he walked out, but didn&#39;t seem to care or notice. Ty and Dustin burst out laughing as soon as Sandy Cobi was gone.</p>
