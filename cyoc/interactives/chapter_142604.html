<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amber and Madison stare at the wall for a second, before refocusing on one another.<br />
&quot;...why&#39;d you get me diapers?&quot; Maddie asked. &quot;Thanks for trying to help, but it&#39;s really no big deal.&quot; She says as she stands up from the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, they&#39;re not diapers, technically, they&#39;re pull-ups...&quot; Amber retorts, looking at the package.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah but, I&#39;m not peeing that much and it&#39;s not going to last that long.&quot; Madison replies, rinsing her bowl out and putting the cereal box away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you already wet yourself standing up just now.&quot; Amber says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, really?&quot; Madison looks down; a big dark spot in the middle of her pants. This was the first time the girl had wet herself this badly since she was four-years-old (so half her life ago), but she is flowing with false memories of this having happened constantly for a while.<br />
&quot;Oh, well whatever. I&#39;ll just change my pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maddie...&quot; Amber whimpers. She stands up and gets a little more confrontational. &quot;You can&#39;t keep getting your pants wet all the time. Look, there&#39;s nothing wrong with wearing protection. It&#39;ll save the whole family a lot of stress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison looks up at her sister.<br />
&quot;Fiiiine.&quot; She sighs. She looks over at the table. &quot;Thanks for getting me both pink and blue. I&#39;ll take the blue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Awesome!&quot; Amber says, congratulating her. &quot;Danny&#39;ll take you up to your room and can get you changed into one right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madison glares back at her.<br />
&quot;Daniel? Daniel won&#39;t put me in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
~Yes I will.~<br />
<br />
&quot;Why is DANIEL going to put me in a pull-up? That&#39;s weird!&quot; She exclaims.<br />
<br />
~It&#39;s not that weird. You&#39;re mostly fine with it.~ You get the scenario moving along, but while still getting to enjoy Madison&#39;s slight discomfort.<br />
<br />
Maddie turns over to you in a harrumph.<br />
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s go...&quot; She says.<br />
<br />
You grab the bags, take her hand and guide her up the stairs.<br />
<br />
“So how are you gonna do it?” She asks as you close the door behind her.<br />
<br />
“Just lay down.” You say, taking a towel from the bathroom and putting it on the bed.<br />
<br />
She jumps on and lays flat on her back.<br />
<br />
“Okay, spread your legs a bit.” You say, taking hold of her ankle.<br />
<br />
You reach over and undo her wet pants. You slide them down a bit, get her to maneuver around so you can pull them off, slide them down her legs and out from between her feet. Her pants were wet, but her underwear is soaked. Nonetheless, you roll her over on her side and take a firm grip on the back, pulling the underwear clean off her bottom. You return her to her back and slide the panties down her legs and off her feet.<br />
<br />
“...are you sure you’re supposed to be doing this?” Maddie asks, blushing and holding a bit of blanket up to her neck.<br />
<br />
“Mhm. It’s important.” You answer, opening the package of baby wipes. “I need to do this, so you can be sanitary.” You say, beginning to wipe her pelvis.<br />
<br />
“Aah!” She softly yells. “That’s cold…”<br />
<br />
“I know. You’re just gonna have to get used to it.” You tell her, dragging the wipe down to her privates.<br />
<br />
“Mrgh.” She grumbles. “This is really embarrassing! You’re kind of a weirdo, you know that? Weirdo.”<br />
<br />
“Mmhm?” You mutter back rhetorically, grabbing and lifting her ankle. “Hey, this weirdo has to wipe your butt. Move over.”<br />
<br />
You clean her up in the back with a second wipe, then lay her back down once again. You pop open the little tube of barrier cream and dab it on your finger.<br />
<br />
“What’s that for?” She asks.<br />
<br />
“It’s to keep your skin healthy and dry.” You lower your finger down between her legs.<br />
<br />
“You mean you have to touch me even more??” She whines.<br />
<br />
“Yep.” You answer.<br />
<br />
Once the cream is applied, you tear an opening in the Boy’s Goodnites package.<br />
“You said you wanted the blue, right?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah… I don’t like princesses.” She answers.<br />
<br />
You reach in there and yank a Goodnite from the tightly compressed package, stretch it out and lift it up along her legs. You get her to move her butt up so you can yank it up nice and firm. You then retrieve a new pair of shorts from her dresser, and put those on her in the same fashion.<br />
<br />
“Alright, you’re done!” You say, pulling up her zipper and doing in her button. You reach out and take her hand, lifting her up to her feet on the floor.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, Dan…” Maddie says, folding her arms together and biting her lip.<br />
<br />
“No problem, kiddo.” You reply.<br />
<br />
She opens the door and heads out into the hallway. You notice that Amber is in her room with the door open.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Maddie says, waltzing in eagerly.<br />
<br />
“Hey.” Amber replies. “Well how’d it go?”<br />
<br />
<br />
“The diaper thing?” Maddie leans against the wall. “No problem. No problem at all. I’m protected now. No worries of pee. Yep.”<br />
<br />
Madison still sounds really embarrassed and at a loss for words.<br />
<br />
Amber sighs, partly in relief that Madison is finally getting the help she needs, and partly in frustration that she’s still in a stage of denial about it. She invites the two of you to hang out in her room a while. You chit chat, badger and bloviate a good hour or so. You talk about school; brownies; mountain climbing; skydiving; hurricanes; HBO; ear wax… until the dialogue was bookended by a mutual burst into laughter. For a moment, it was nothing but a quality bonding experience between the three of you. A moment later, Madison suddenly stops laughing, and thrusts her hands between her legs--clamping them closed.<br />
<br />
“What’s up, Maddie? Did you have an accident?” You ask, putting your hand on her thigh.<br />
<br />
“...yeah.” She mutters.<br />
<br />
“Come on, let’s see.” You say, taking her hand and helping her to her feet. You pull her shorts down and spread her legs a bit, examining the wet spot.<br />
<br />
“Mmmmrrr…” Maddie grumbles. “Why you gotta do it with Amber watching??”<br />
<br />
“It’s okay with me.” Amber says, crossing her legs. “I’m not gonna judge you. I wet the bed when I was your age.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah but you didn’t wet the… the DAY, did you?” Madison retorts as you pull her shorts completely off.<br />
<br />
“No… and it didn’t last long, they never gave me pull-ups to wear… but it was still embarrassing!” Amber says, still really bad at being comforting.<br />
<br />
“Alright, go to Amber’s bathroom over there and pee in case you have any left.” You say, patting Madison’s bottom.<br />
<br />
“Okay…” She sighs, walking to the bathroom, pantsless.<br />
<br />
“Speaking of, I’m going to take a shower in a bit.” Amber says.<br />
<br />
“Actually, let’s take a bath.” You interject.<br />
<br />
“A bath?” Amber says.<br />
<br />
You make sure you are within earshot of both of them.<br />
“Yeah, let’s all three of us take a bath together.” You say.<br />
<br />
~You see nothing wrong with this proposal and fully agree to it.~ You command.<br />
<br />
“Okay, sounds good.” Amber nods.<br />
<br />
“Fine. I guess I am a bit sweaty.” Madison replies, sitting on the toilet with her Goodnite pushed down to her ankles.<br />
<br />
You hear Madison handling the toilet paper roll.<br />
~You don’t use toilet paper if you’ve only gone pee. The Goodnite will absorb it for you.~ You command, and hear no more of the toilet paper noises.<br />
<br />
The three of you head down to the parents’ bedroom, so that you can use the master bathroom, which features a much bigger bathtub. It’s like a small jacuzzi. Amber cranks on the hot water, pairs it with a little bit of cold, then stands back up to pull her shirt off. She clicks off her bra and throws it down in the same corner of the floor. She unbuttons her jeans and slides them down her legs.<br />
“Hey.” Amber says. “It’s rude to stare.” She giggles smugly as she steps out of her pant legs.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Ahem, sorry.” You reply, realizing you were neglecting to remove your own clothes.<br />
<br />
Madison pulls off her shirt and tears off her blue pull-up and throws it in the trash. You similarly tear off everything you are wearing, your green boxers coming last.<br />
<br />
You each step into the tub as the water ascends. You all moan with satisfaction as the warm liquid crawls up your legs. By the time it engulfs you and Amber’s groins, it has already made it up to Madison’s belly button. The tub is deep and wide, and Amber decides to turn the water off just as it reaches her navel. The water comes all the way up to Madison’s chest; her lower body visible as but a wavy blur from above.</p>
