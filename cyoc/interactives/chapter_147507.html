<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Even with Vito and Marcus caught and arrested, there was still a fair amount to do and check on for Daniel. For the most part it was an FBI plan and the two Gambonis would be their collar officially, but the Moon Lake PD had agreed to allow Agent Baoman and his team access to Moon Lake to set up the sting operation and Daniel Brooks was still their ranking officer and in pure theory had some means of direct &quot;leadership&quot; with regard to handling the entire operation. Mostly because of the fact that the sting would involve both the Moon Lake PD and the FBI undertaking a fair amount of action in a residential area that was well within Moon Lake&#39;s city limits. The FBI would need someone with local knowledge to help run things in the field, while Daniel also knew that Moon Lake would need its secrets kept.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, despite some surprises, Marcus and Vito were caught. Vito was placed in the back of one squad car while Daniel moved Marcus into the back of another. He noted that officer was another Moon Lake officer, not an FBI agent using the car.<br />
<br />
&quot;So the chief got Agent Baoman to allow for added help?&quot; Daniel asked to the driver after shutting the back door and locking a fuming Marcus in the backseat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly just an alert,&quot; the officer answered, &quot;we were all on standard patrols when we were radioed the alerts that these two were moving. Dispatch offered some directions to stay out of the way until they left their car to trigger the sting. It was only then that we got directions to move in on the car.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which in theory was supposed to be after the sting had caught them,&quot; came a new voice making Daniel look up to see both Agent Baoman and Chief O&#39;Hara coming up with the lights from O&#39;Hara&#39;s car on and illuminating the general area.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... technically that did work,&quot; Daniel said slowly as Agent Reed came up from behind him, &quot;though the Gambonis did pull a trick that we didn&#39;t expect...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something on the reports over the radio said gas,&quot; Agent Baoman said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tear gas specifically,&quot; Agent Reed answered with a nod, &quot;they made it up to the back of the Charleston home and threw at least one tear gas grenade through one of the back windows.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least that&#39;s non-fatal,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara commented. Agent Baoman nodded in agreement to that.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it would appear that they had more tear gas grenades in their trunk,&quot; Agent Reed continued, &quot;indicating that they were far more heavily armed than we originally suspected. Thankfully, they never suspected the trap that was laid for them and they lost all coordination when it was sprung. Vito ran one way and made it back here where he was caught by most of the agents that had been moved to back up Officer Brooks and the agents with him while Officer Brooks and I ran after Marcus... and caught him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good work, both of you,&quot; Agent Baoman gave a confident smile to both the Moon Lake officer and the Seattle Field Office agent and then looked to Marcus who glared back through the back window of the car. The young man was clearly angry, but Agent Baoman knew that this time there would be no escape. No loophole that would get Marcus Gamboni a lighter sentence or have the case thrown out entirely, and that gave Agent Baoman some feelings of relief, though he turned his gaze to Officer Brooks, &quot;and what of the casualties?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the chaos and confusion, sir,&quot; Daniel said slowly, &quot;I know they managed to make it out the front door of the Charleston home, but with Marcus running into the woods... I made the call to chase him.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point one of the agents that had been brought in as part of the backup team that came the Brooks home had noticed some of the commotion and came over. He had also clearly overheard the conversation as he gave his answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;The agents that were in the house should be fine... a bit disoriented, perhaps, but nothing that a shower and some rest probably wouldn&#39;t cure,&quot; the agent spoke carefully.<br />
<br />
Daniel breathed a heavy sigh of relief at that. In theory his reaction to the situation wasn&#39;t necessarily &quot;wrong,&quot; in that he did have the freedom to pursue Marcus Gamboni given the situation, but the situation had been a chaotic one and one where there had been plenty that could go wrong. And if something did go wrong, there would be questions to asked on the decisions made. He looked to Chief O&#39;Hara and to Agent Baoman and could guess that there might still be some questions, but with things working out successfully, there wouldn&#39;t be any major urgency to ask those questions.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can shuttle them down to our hospital here,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara offered to Agent Baoman, &quot;let them get a once over and then escort them to the hotel you are all at. They&#39;d be fine and comfortable... and would have the ability to clean themselves up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agent Baoman nodded in agreement, &quot;and while I&#39;d love to have the Gambonis in cell in the Seattle Field Office to await transfer to whichever court claims the most immediate jurisdiction on them... it may be getting a bit late to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can hold them until tomorrow when you&#39;re ready to move them,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara promised, &quot;these two won&#39;t get away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll also need to do something for the Charleston house, sir,&quot; Daniel spoke up, &quot;the broken glass... the tear gas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The Charlestons should have copies of the paperwork signed when the plan to use their house for the sting was set up,&quot; Agent Baoman answered, &quot;we&#39;ll pay for any structural damage as per the agreement. They can send he bill to us... all that paperwork should be with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May be best to leave some of that information with us,&quot; Chief O&#39;Hara commented, &quot;In case they can&#39;t find it... Officer Brooks can relay that to the Charlestons... As for the tear gas... it may be best to get some fans and get them going. The house should be ventilated and thus allow for it to pumped out once the air is moving... But first things first. Let&#39;s get these two the jail and their ride impounded.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Brooks nodded as things moved forward. He moved back to the car where Marcus was still sitting in and climbed into the front passenger seat and sat down beside the driver.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time to get them to jail?&quot; the officer asked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Daniel nodded as he buckled himself in.<br />
<br />
He then rode along as they backed up slightly and then pulled back onto the road. The went forward to the next intersection and made a left there and drove along until they came to the edge of the park area at the center of Moon Lake. Here again the officer driving made a left turn to drive along the outer edge of the park rather than going into it. The route ultimately took them back to the Moon Lake Police Station. Here, the driver moved around the parking lot to get to the back area of the building and pressed a button that was on clip on the window&#39;s sun guard. Daniel and the driver at this point watched as the large garage door lifted up and revealed the opening into the department&#39;s main garage. It was a feature that allowed them to move prisoners into the cells without risk of exposing them to the elements or providing an easy means of escape. Marcus soon figured this out and was ranting as Daniel and the other officer practically dragged him out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man this guy has a mouth on him,&quot; the officer answered with irritation clearly in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t get away with this!&quot; Marcus vowed, &quot;I want my lawyer! When my father finds out...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see your lawyer in due time,&quot; Daniel spoke, &quot;for the moment, we&#39;re just holding you. The Feds have the higher jurisdictional claim on your arrest... so... once you get to an FBI cell, then all the formal stuff will begin. Until then... you&#39;ve been given your Miranda Rights. You have the right to remain silent. I suggest you use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus struggled a bit, but between Daniel holding one arm and the other officer holding the other, he didn&#39;t accomplish much. They stood there for a moment as the second car came in with Vito sitting in the backseat. Agent Reed got out with that officer and soon helped him get Vito out. Unlike Marcus, Vito was quiet as he was moved. Once the garage doors were shut, the two pairs of law enforcement officers moved their prisoners. Vito quietly moved along as they moved from the garage area to a door that took them into a hallway that passed a series of old style cells. <br />
<br />
Many police units were now moving towards various forms of security doors that went away from the classic cinderblock walls with barred metal doors. Moon Lake&#39;s cells weren&#39;t like that, and Vito was also quick to see that these bars were also much thicker than what was normal, as if they were designed to contain something or someone far more powerful than a normal human. The cell doors were opened and Vito was placed in one cell while Marcus was placed in the other. As the cell doors shut with an audible clack and clink, Daniel let out some sigh of relief, knowing that the Gambonis and the threat they posed was effectively over. Moe and Nichole might have some home repairs thanks to tear gas grenades breaking a window, but the threat to their life was effectively over. There would still be things like the trial and all that, and that would take time, but Daniel had the sense that Moe and his family would be safe, just as he promised... and THAT was all that mattered at the moment.</p>
