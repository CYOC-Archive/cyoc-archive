<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">   The battle at first started with both Issac and Sagittarius going into their battle stances. Issac&#39;s was purely defensive while Sagittarius began hovering about ten feet in the air, his majestic wings gently flapping in the wind.<br />
<br />
      Readying all four of his arms to cover all sides, Issac was already preparing to spit a ball of dripping acid that he had inherited from the basilisk, he wanted to make this quick and painless for both of them. He had a feeling Sagittarius was thinking the same thing.<br />
<br />
  Then without warning, as agreed, Sagittarius made the first attack, or rather first several attacks. Neighing a battle cry, re alpha began channeling his image air magic and within seconds multiple spears of swirling air formed around him, instantly shooting off towards Issac.<br />
<br />
  Issac knowing that with his body&#39;s speed, he had no choice but to block them as much as possible, feeling the sensation of what felt like being hit by a truck several times over as each air spear crashed against him. Several chunks of granite, ice, and magma, feel from his arms and his body tried to regenerate quickly from the damage.<br />
<br />
   Sagittarius flying around Issac now, shooting more air spears at any undefended areas of his body was now hurling spear after spear, wasting no time. Issac managed to last against each impact although not even a minute after the duel had started, Issac was already suffering from several wounds that his body could not regenerate fast enough.<br />
<br />
      He&#39;s keeping away, if I manage to grab him, his chances of winning are over. Issac thought, trying to strategize as Sagittarius kept hitting him like the giant immobile target he was.  For now this will have to do, Issac said in his mind. <br />
<br />
    With all four fists, channeling the Corrupted icy magic that layed within his body, Issac slammed all four arms deep into the cloudy ground, roaring as a dome of ice started to form around him. The dome quickly formed, crackling with ice as it was made.<br />
<br />
  Within a second a dome of pure ice completely surrounded Issac, protecting him from any air attacks. The ice buckled and cracked against Sagittarius&#39; repeated air spears but held its ground, Issac doing his best to keep regenerating it.<br />
<br />
     Sagittarius stopped his onslaught, surprised at the sudden ice sphere that was now sheltering Issac.<br />
<br />
    Hearing several gasps of surprise from his herd only proved to irritate Sagittarius slightly, by he brushed those thoughts away. Interesting. The Pegasus thought, putting all his focus on Issac. This barrier would only give him time to regenerate. A close up battle would only give him the upper hand. However desperate times call for desperate measures. Saggitarius grinned before flying even higher up into the air, almost crossing the invisible boundary set up by his herd. Then, he began to spin. Spinning faster and faster until the Pegasus&#39; body seemed to become a gigantic torpedo of air. <br />
<br />
  Marry and Ilvir looked on in shock as the torpedo began sucking up air around it, becoming larger and larger until, in a flash of speed rushed towards Issac&#39;s ice barrier. Crashing against in in a huge boom. <br />
<br />
      Issac grunted as he felt the barrier start to fall apart rapidly as the torpedo drilled away at the ice, not losing any velocity as it looms ever closer to Issac. <br />
<br />
    Crap. There&#39;s only one thing I can do. Issac thought. Preparing all four of his arms, pulling his lower set from the ground, ending his barrier&#39;s regeneration.<br />
<br />
  Without the support from Issac, the barrier crumbled into shards of ice, as Sagittarius sped towards Issac who only waiting to the last second, grabbed the swirling Pegasus with all four arms, feeling taken aback as the continuously spinning force tried to push him to the ground, the cloudy ground beneath Issac giving way as Sagittarius continued his spinning, the air around him becoming a solid shell that still spun even with Issac&#39;s fierce grip. <br />
<br />
      Issac&#39;s body struggled to keep itself together and even Issac&#39;s metal armor was starting to crumple to the force of Sagittarius. Issac felt pain wash over his body in ever increasing waves of pure torment flooded through him. However he kept at it, trying with all his might to slow the spinning pegasus even a little.<br />
<br />
         He didn&#39;t have the focus to use any of his elemental powers nor any divine magic which would only serve to deteriorate his body further, however... there was one last option. Issac despite the pain wracking his body smiled slightly, and without any hesitation, let go of his grasp on Saggittarius.<br />
<br />
    The Pegasus grinned as Isaac did so, having taken that as a sign of submission, however he had an image to give up and he was sure his soon to be body would recover. The Pegasus tore through Issac&#39;s body, easily tearing through his fur, vines, rock, scales and flesh, creating a gigantic gaping hole in the middle of Issac&#39;s flesh. Atleast that&#39;s what he thought.<br />
<br />
   In reality, using his complete control over his body, Issac instead willed his body to expand, creating a void within Issac&#39;s body as his body stretched away from Saggitarius.<br />
<br />
        Saggittarius landed behind Issac, having expected his victory. However shock quickly encompassed the Alpha&#39;s face, as Issac&#39;s body reformed itself, and despite his speed, Isaac &#39;s four arms grabbed at one of Sagittarius&#39; hind legs, preventing him from flying away.<br />
<br />
  The pegasus didn&#39;t take kindly to that, and retaliated, throwing cloven hoof strikes and air spears at Issac relentlessly. <br />
<br />
     Issac groaned at the constant attacks but didn&#39;t let go as, he swung the Pegasus upwards before, slamming the horse onto the ground, the cloud not injuring Sagittarius what so ever but stunned him enough for Issac to flip the horse on his back, grabbing all four of his legs with his arms, and then activated his gaze of lust he had inherited from the basilisk.<br />
<br />
         Issac&#39;s eyes visibly glew a bright pink as Saggittarius not knowing their effect looked right into Issac&#39;s eyes. The effect was immediate as, Sagittarius&#39; thick horse member, almost as big as Issac&#39;s arm swelled out of his sheath. Issac, seeing the huge black cock, drooled as his own members started to harden.<br />
<br />
   Issac forced Sagittarius to keep looking into his eyes, the pegasus&#39; going deeper into his trance. Issac released one of the pegasus&#39;s legs only to grope one of Sagittarius&#39;s big ball, squishing it slightly, noting how full of cum they were. <br />
<br />
         &quot;Wow, you&#39;re really pent up right now, want me to help?&quot; Issac said, his glowing pink eyes giving him a demonic look as he grinned, canines jutting out from his smile.<br />
<br />
  Sagittarius nodded, enraptured by Issac.<br />
<br />
  Issac, without any warning, proceeded to shove one of his purple member&#39;s into Sagittarius&#39; anus, watching the horse scream in pleasure as he was dominated. Issac grunted as the Pegasus milked his thick cock, thrusting in and out as he jerked off the horse. Then when Sagittarius adjusted to one dick, Issac squeezed his other cock inside the Pegasus&#39;s needy asshole, enjoying Sagittarius&#39;s screams of pure joy. <br />
<br />
    The Pegasus orgasmed quickly, coating himself in his white semen, his body starting to look like Issac&#39;s as it beginning to be influenced by Issac&#39;s Corruption. Sagittarius was given no break however, as Isaac plunged two of his vines into the horse&#39;s penis, sending them deep into his dick, touching and feeling the inside of his balls.<br />
<br />
 Sagittarius screamed in pure pleasure as the fuckinv continued.</p>
