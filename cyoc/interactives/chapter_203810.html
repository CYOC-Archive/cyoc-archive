<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Another loud banging on Troy&#39;s front door woke him up. He found himself lying on his bed in a puddle of a sticky mess. &quot;Eww...&quot; he muttered as he tossed his shirt off. &quot;I need a shower...&quot; But then looking at his bed, there were deep claw marks dug into the mattress. A faint smile appeared on his face as he ran his hand over them. Even though he&#39;d have to buy a new mattress, he couldn&#39;t get over the fact that he had fulfilled one of his fantasies. He was about to use the spell again until he heard another loud knock on his front door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang it...&quot; he groaned as he went to the front door. Dustin was on the other side. Troy could almost see the tail he didn&#39;t have wagging. &quot;Come in...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin followed into the living room to see a German Shepard raise its head. &quot;Woah! You got a dog?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Had to...&quot; Troy answered. &quot;Clint told them I had a dog, so I had to use the book to get one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really...&quot; Dustin said. &quot;Trying to replace me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Troy answered without much emotion in his voice. A moment of silence stood between them. &quot;Anyways, you want to shift again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes please!&quot; Dustin clapped his hands together.<br />
<br />
Troy could only roll his eyes as he headed to the bathroom with the book. &quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower, you get comfortable.&quot; Dustin nodded and his attention went straight to Rosco. &#39;Everyone loves that dog more than me...&#39; Troy thought to himself as he grabbed a fresh set of clothes and went to the bathroom. He made sure to say, &quot;Half,&quot; quiet enough so Dustin couldn&#39;t hear him. Then hopped into the shower. But for some reason, Troy couldn&#39;t think of Dustin as a German Shepard. He kept imagining something bigger.<br />
<br />
&#39;No, not a lion,&#39; the animal cycled through his head. He kept going back to Lancer. The big muscular lion man just wouldn&#39;t leave his mind. Seeing those strong muscle bulge and flex under the pressure he was putting Lancer under was too much. He loved that tawny yellow fur. The big mane that wrapped around his masculine jaw. The intense stare that the lion naturally gave off. &quot;Shit...&quot; Troy cursed as he nearly toppled over.<br />
<br />
A sudden thrust from his thoughts and the wet floor nearly made him slip. He rested his hands on the back wall of the shower. The water drained down his back. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he tried to think of the German Shepard again, but could only think of the lion. His sharp claws that dug deep into the mattress. His strong hands that held Troy so gently. The powerful legs he stood on. Another thrust. He bit his lip. A hand had made its way down to his dick. <br />
<br />
How could just a little sleep make him feel so needy? So wanting to be in Lancer&#39;s big strong grasp again. He wanted to feel the strong powerful body under his grasp. Run his hands over those hard, military trained muscles. Pet his fur. Rest on his body. And feel that dick-- <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck...&quot; Troy realized what he was doing. A finger had wormed his way down under his balls to his sensitive asshole. It&#39;d probably only been a couple of hours but the feeling was still there. Just a finger was enough. He grabbed some water and tossed it against the wall to clean the mess he&#39;d made. Then finished cleaning himself in the shower. He quickly dried himself and put on some fresh clothes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, how are we feeling?&quot; Troy asked as he stepped outside of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same?&quot; Dustin stared a bit confused. But instead of a human, he was a massive lion man. Not quite as big and strong looking as Lancer, but still far larger than the average human. His soft furry pecs pressed hard against his blue sleeveless shirt. Thick arms swayed from either side, but there was a good amount of fat on them as well. He clearly had the size of an ex-jock that doesn&#39;t work out any more as a belly had been growing in front of him as well. But he still looked like he was wearing the same stretchy shorts he&#39;d bought all the way back in college. The black with a red stripe down the sides didn&#39;t seem to fit him as loosely as they once did. But Troy figured he appreciated the hole for his tail as the long rope with a tuft of hair at the end swayed back and forth. Most strange were the sandles that he wore on his feet. They almost looked like they fit perfectly to his paws, though sharp claw marks were dug deep into the cheap material.<br />
<br />
&quot;The same...&quot; Troy muttered as he looked at the furry lion face. It was strange how he didn&#39;t look like Lancer in the face either. Dustin&#39;s mane was a bit lighter and not nearly as wild. He&#39;d clearly tamed it to look a bit more professional, or maybe it was just that he wouldn&#39;t necessarily be the leader of the pack. Not to mention how the jaw, still distinctly masculine, also had a bit more of a rounded feature to it. &quot;I&#39;ll fix it... Close your ears.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dustin did as he was told and Troy said, &quot;Half&quot; again. This time extra trying to focus on some kind of dog. His mind instantly went to a wolf dog. The bright yellow fur turned to a more muddy and brown color. It grew longer and far fluffier. The round ears on top of his head grew to massive points each one sticking high up into the air. His maw grew longer, and nose turned black. It shined as a bit of wetness covered it. The broad linebacker shoulders he&#39;d had shrank ever so slightly. It was still a rather imposing build, but not so overbearing. Muscle and fat still seemed to work together to give him the large somewhat athletic look. He just didn&#39;t look so built.<br />
<br />
&quot;Done?&quot; Dustin asked. His tail was already wagging. Even before it&#39;d shrunk into a wolf&#39;s one. He looked over himself again. His sleeveless shirt no longer blue, but instead white. It contrasted his darked furrier fur a lot better. Though the ketchup stain was pretty noticeable. &quot;Did it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
He kept looking over his clawed fingers and toes. The sandles feel off his feet and he inspected his bottom paw pads. &quot;It worked,&quot; Troy confirmed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really!?&quot; Dustin nearly pounced him. &quot;I don&#39;t feel any different, but I do feel good!&quot; A big tongue lapped out of his mouth, licking Troy in the face. &quot;Thank you!&quot; he repeated as he licked his friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome! You&#39;re welcome!&quot; Troy was doing everything in his power to push Dustin off of him. He couldn&#39;t quite handle weight of the big dog man. <br />
<br />
When Dustin was finally done, he stood back up. &quot;So, who&#39;s your new boyfriend?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My... My...&quot; Troy stammered. He could feel his face turning red as his jaw refused to close properly. The large canine smile on Dustin&#39;s face only grew. It took everything in Troy&#39;s power to look away. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Dustin smirked. &quot;I can smell him all over you! Like here,&quot; he sniffed Troy&#39;s shoulder. &quot;And here...&quot; his nose dipped down to Troy&#39;s side. &quot;And most importantly... Here,&quot; his nose buried into Troy&#39;s privates, sniffing like crazy. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; Troy grabbed Dustin by the nose and pushed with all his might. He squirmed under the invasion of privacy. Dustin finally pulled back, tail wagging and clearly proud of himself. Meanwhile, Troy&#39;s redness had only grown more severe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Dustin pried.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s someone I summoned... A Leonin...&quot; Troy answered. &quot;I just wanted to test the book.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like the test was successful,&quot; Dustin leaned in. His furry body rubbed up against Troy&#39;s human one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; Troy smiled but refused to lift his head. His pushing turning more into petting the soft fur brushing up against him. &quot;I guess it did...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure smells like it!&quot; Dustin cheered. He seemed happier than someone should have been hearing about a man having sex with another man. Then quickly looked like he was going to change the subject as he padded his shorts for something. &quot;But here,&quot; he pulled a bright yellow sticky note out of his pocket and handed it to him. &quot;Since our office is a bit out of commission, we&#39;ll be working from home these next couple days? Probably more like weeks. Not like I&#39;m complaining... But we&#39;ve got a meeting tomorrow at 9. So don&#39;t be late.&quot; He wagged his finger. &quot;And make sure you dress up. Doris is going to be a stickler for it. But really as long as it&#39;s waist up it should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... Sure...&quot; Troy nodded as he held onto the note.</p>
