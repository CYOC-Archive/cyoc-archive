<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning soon came. The soothing heat and light of sunlight beamed through the window and onto her face. Jade awoke, feeling a tight and uncomfortable feeling in her udder. Sure enough, as soon as she slowly stood up, milk sloshed into her teats, causing them to leak a bit. Jade sighed. This would take her some time to get used to. <br />
<br />
She got to the troughs and started to eat. The grain tasted suddenly more flavorous than the day before. Had she adjusted to eating it? Probably not. Her new ears were sharp enough to detect footsteps coming from outside the barn. It was Mark. His giddy whistle started as he opened the door to the barn. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; He said. His beaming smile always caught her attention, which also made her smile. &quot;Hey, Mark.&quot; Jade said. Mark placed his hand onto her stomach, feeling it&#39;s thickness even more this time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you are getting big!&quot; Mark exclaimed, rubbing her back. &quot;I-is, that a good or bad thing?&quot; Jade asked nervously. Mark hesitated for a bit. He sighed, his expression worsening a bit. Jade also was concerned on what would the outcome be. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Judging by your size, and, well, my experience, you appear to be, uh.....&quot; he stuttered. Jade waited for an answer. <br />
<br />
Mark took a deep breath, himself already shaking a bit. &quot;....Ready to.......give....birth.&quot; He finally said. <br />
<br />
Both of them, especially Jade, were in shock. &quot;H-HOW???&quot; she exclaimed. The shock nearly gave her a panic attack. &quot;Alright, calm down, this isn&#39;t such a big deal yet.&quot; He said. &quot;Not a big deal?!?&quot; she then asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just hear me out.&quot; Mark then said. &quot;By mid- to late-third trimester when a cow or heifer is considered &quot;heavily pregnant,&quot; she synonymously looks quite like a large, round barrel with a head, a tail, and four legs.&quot; He shook his head slightly. &quot;Which you look exactly like a heavily pregnant cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade was extremely surprised. &quot;Oh my god...&quot; she said. &quot;H-how much time do I have.&quot; Her legs trembled, scared of Mark&#39;s answer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, your udder size determines how developed the calf is, and, well, it&#39;s the largest udder here on this farm.&quot; He said. &quot;Hold on, let me try something.&quot;<br />
<br />
He went down to his knees in front of her stomach, noticing her overbearing udder. He then pushed his hands into her stomach, deepening until he could feel the fetus. <br />
<br />
It was official. Mark gave a worrying sigh. He then leaned his ear into her stomach, too. he could definitely hear a heartbeat. Maybe, two? Mark then stood up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. You&#39;re definitely ready to birth the calf.&quot; He then said. &quot;So, we might be occupied for the next 3 days, especially you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jade was in disbelief. &quot;O-oh...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark didn&#39;t want to spend more time on this topic, so he reassured her that everything would go fine, and that the baby (or babies) would be healthy, at least for his estimation they would be. Soon, Jade could no longer bear the tightness and the sensitivity of her udder, so Mark had to milk her immediately. Jade was still extremely worried about the baby, but somewhere in her mind, she was quite excited. She never felt anything quite like the anticipation of the child. <br />
<br />
Though she was only 3 months pregnant a few days ago,  during her transformation, it might have accelerated her pregnancy, and that might be the reason for the sudden belly growth, and the udder sensitivity. They were just growing in preparation for the baby. Weird. Anyway, After Jade&#39;s morning milking, she was brought out into a pen so that Mark could clean the barn and replace the food. <br />
<br />
In the open pen, She learned that she was able to eat grass, which was very convenient in her case, since she always seemed to be hungry. She grazed on the grass, constantly chewing her cud for the rest of the evening. <br />
<br />
Mark soon came into her pen and opened the gate for her to come back into the barn. When she came back, she noticed that it was a lot cleaner, and more spacious, since Mark took the chance to remove a lot of the things in the barn that didn&#39;t need to be there.<br />
<br />
Jade prepared herself for her evening milking, as she noticed Mark plopping a bucket between her legs. He started pulling on each teat gently, trying to make her let her milk down. He then tugged slightly harder, excreting the juices out of her fat tits. She felt shame for the first few times she was milked, but now, she thought it was completely natural. She thought the milking was like a massage for her breasts. She then remembered Mark saying she had the biggest udders on the whole farm, which is not a lot of competition, but still. She still couldn&#39;t help but feel exposed a bit. Her backside was completely uncovered, pussy and everything, including her breasts. Whatever. She felt tired and didn&#39;t want to deal with those thoughts right now. <br />
<br />
Another two buckets filled, and Mark leaving her for the night, she quickly drifted to sleep, with not a care for the world. While she was resting, though, She felt little kicks in her belly. That surprised her a little, but was sleepy enough to go back to sleep. Her udder tingling as it immediately started filling up again.</p>
