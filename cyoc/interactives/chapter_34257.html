<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Dare!  You twisted little bitch!&quot;  Victor could feel his heart racing, but if he was going out, <br />
then he was doing it on his terms.<br />
<br />
Jenny considered it.  She still wasn't sure the curse would work.  She could dare him to <br />
change his ways, or turn himself in to the police...or...<br />
<br />
&quot;Victor Huges, I dare you to feel all the pain you have ever inflicted on a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
At once, his eyes grew wide, and he started to scream.<br />
<br />
When the police found him, he was rocking in the corner of his basement, crying like a <br />
little girl.  Despite the best efforts of the authorities, Victor Hughes killed himself while in <br />
jail three days later, leaving behind two words, written in blood on the wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Jenny caught up with Kyle later that morning at the train station.  Kyle was snoring lightly, <br />
Jenny's trenchcoat held in her lap.<br />
<br />
Jenny felt a little tug at her heartstrings.  Kyle was so cute and loyal.  She climbed up on <br />
the bench and pressed her lips against Kyle's.<br />
<br />
Kyle was having such a pleasant dream.  It was a warm, sunny day, and both he and <br />
Jennifer were making out.  Her lips tasted so sweet.  Her hands reached down and rubbed <br />
his nipples, which were so sensitive....what?!<br />
<br />
Her eyes opened with the realization that it was Jenny, not Jennifer, kissing him.  &quot;Gah!&quot;  <br />
was all she could think to say.<br />
<br />
Laughing, Jenny pulled away, but fondly stroked Kyle's cheek.  &quot;Good morning, beautiful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jenny, God, I'm glad you're ok...how long have you been here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny grinned.  &quot;Long enough to get you hot and bothered.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle blushed furiously.  It was true, he was horny as hell.  Everything was so different as a <br />
girl, it was enough to drive him crazy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um...that is...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's ok, Kylie.  I know, this isn't really you.&quot;  Jenny sat down next to the girl-turned-boy.  <br />
&quot;This isn't really me either.  I guess having a little girl coming on to you is more than a <br />
little freaky by itself...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked so sad at that moment that Kyle couldn't bear it.  He put his arms around the <br />
smaller girl and held her close.  &quot;Don't talk like that.  Please, don't.  I know it's all my fault, <br />
and I'm so sorry.  I'd do anything to make it up to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked about to reply, but Kyle put a finger to her lips.  &quot;No, not yet.  I have to say <br />
this.  Right now, I'm really confused.  You're not the girl I've known for the past eight <br />
years.  You're different in so many ways.  You're not even the girl I knew when I was a kid.  <br />
You're dangerous, and confident, and so strong.  You can handle anything.  Right now, I'm <br />
confused, I have a different body, and it's messing with my mind.  And the only thing that <br />
keeps me from going crazy is you.  I look at you, and I feel like everything is going to be <br />
ok.  That somehow, you'll figure everything out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle paused a moment to get his thoughts together.  &quot;You're not a little girl.  You may look <br />
like one, but the way you talk, and move, and act, it's obvious.  You're more grown-up <br />
than Jennifer ever was.  I've got a guy's mind and a girl's body, and both of them are going <br />
in different directions at the same time; I feel like I'm being pulled apart.  But the one <br />
thing both sides of me agrees on is that we're in love with you.  You've torn my life apart, <br />
everything is crazy, but as long as I'm with you, it's ok.  I know it's going to be better than <br />
it ever was before.  I love you, Jenny, and if you can accept that, then there's no way I'm <br />
going to let our bodies get in the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny looked at him.  He couldn't tell if she was angry or not.  A lot of emotions were in <br />
those icy blue eyes.  But then she smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kiss me, bitch.  Kiss me like you mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle had never kissed a girl before Jenny.  She wasn't even sure what to do.  Just let go, he <br />
told himself.  Do what feels right.  She leaned in, and pressed her lips to Jenny's...<br />
<br />
It seemed like forever before they parted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot;  They both said it at the same time.<br />
<br />
Jenny punched Kyle lightly in the arm.  It stung, but he couldn't help but smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kylie...I mean Kyle...you're an idiot.  A total moron when it comes to girls.  Which is sad, <br />
seeing as how you are one right now.  But I can't help it.  I like you.  A lot.  I don't know if <br />
it's love, because this part of me...hasn't really known what love is for so long.  Still...what <br />
you just said....makes me very happy.  I didn't really think I could ever feel happy again.  <br />
You've made that possible.  So I'm going to do the best I can to make you the happiest <br />
guy/girl in the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
They kissed again after that, and Jenny lay her head in Kyle's lap, content to let the older <br />
girl stroke her hair.  It felt good.<br />
<br />
After a long while, Kyle finally spoke.  &quot;So what's the plan?&quot;<br />
<br />
And that's when Jenny told him what their next move would be...</p>
