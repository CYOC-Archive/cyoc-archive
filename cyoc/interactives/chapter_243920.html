<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah felt like she was falling down and down like she was on a roller coaster, and she hated those. She turned her head to see her husband beside her falling as well, his hand still holding on to her. On the other side her daughter was falling as well her hand holding on tight to her as well. She strained her neck and thought she could see her son’s arm holding onto his sister’s hand, but she wasn’t 100% and for a mother going through whatever this was that was heart pounding by itself.<br />
<br />
Suddenly the rushing air around her stopped and she felt like she was falling into water, cool welcoming water. <br />
<br />
“MOMMY WHAT IS HAPPENING!” yelled her son Ben <br />
<br />
“Don’t be afraid the transformation will be over soon.” came Elyssa’s voice from somewhere and everywhere at the same time.<br />
<br />
Sarah whole body felt weird, it was both good and bad at the same time. She felt like her whole body was being stretched out like going to the chiropractor but yet it felt like her body mostly her legs were being stretched far beyond what was possible. She felt a build up in her chest at the same time she felt like her legs where being wrapped together.<br />
<br />
Finally, that all seemed to stop as all of them slowed down before bursting through the surface of the water even though they had fallen backwards the entire time. They went up feeling warm tropical sun on their bodies before coming to a rest on soft sandy shore, with sea water wrapping gently in the lower half of their bodies.<br />
<br />
“Welcome.” Said Elyssa as she appeared before them. “Welcome to an adventure and an experience of a lifetime.”<br />
<br />
“What happened?” inquired Sarah before she heard her daughter scream, but it wasn’t a scream of pain or anything like that. The nearest thing it came to was that joyful scream she gave when she got that bike she always wanted last birthday.<br />
<br />
Sarah bolted to a sitting position and turned to her daughter. All four of them where laying in a straight line on some kind of tropical beach, her daughter while still mostly the same had changed, her brown hair was now an impossible shade of pink, her cloths had disappeared replaced with what looked like vest made out of strange fabric and “fish netting” the thing which caused her eyes to widen the most was her daughter now sported a long light red almost pink mermaid tail.<br />
<br />
“I am a mermaid, this is amazing!” yelled Katie in pure joy.<br />
<br />
“Yes, all of you have become merfolk.” added Elyssa as Sarah lifted her head to see her son, Ben. He still looked like Ben however like his sister his short hair hand turned the color blue, similar he had a vest made of the same sea based items over his chest. His tail was a neon blue color. He seamed stunned but a smile was forming across his face.<br />
<br />
Slowly she turned her head the other way, her husband Harold sat beside her in the sand, he was shirtless and her eyes couldn’t help but flick down to those muscular chest. He had never been that muscular before, it wasn’t over the top the body of a swimmer. He also looked almost a decade younger. His hair like both of the children had changed color to a shade of impossible red. A long red tail started at his hips and moved down.<br />
<br />
Slowly to stop herself from panicking, she turned and looked at herself. Her chest had never been that big before and it was all being held back by some kind of corset which looked like it belonged in a lingerie store. Her skin also seamed younger and the streech marks from child birth where gone as well. A bluish white tail started at her hips and moved out as she reached back and pulled some of her hair forward, it was no longer it’s natural color but a kind of pale blue almost white color. <br />
<br />
“Now, let me explain the rules.” Announced Elyssa “You will have one week to enjoy your new bodies and explore the seas, don’t worry none of the creatures can harm you and no time will pass outside it will be the same day, hour and everything as when you left. Food will appear for you all in a coral reef on the other side of the island, sleeping arrangements are also on that reef.”<br />
<br />
She placed down four-hour glasses attached to necklaces.<br />
<br />
“These glasses will tell you when the seven days are up. Now when time has passed return to this island and you will head home, all of you must return to this island by sunset on the seventh day if not this will become your new home for all time.” Explained Elyssa “Now enjoy.”<br />
<br />
With that that she disappeared leaving the now merfolk Jacobson family laying on the beached stunned.</p>
