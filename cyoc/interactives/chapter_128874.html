<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I have seen short and half-baked chapters as of late. The most recent being &quot;It wasn&#39;t Nat&#39;s magic ( which flopped) but the Engine that saved Nat from the Thug&quot;. <br />
<br />
As of now, I am warning the Anon&#39;s that wrote these kind of chapters. [The 1] Explicitly states that no idea is left behind however it is not an excuse to be adding chapters filled with unsuitable (and stupid) ideas that even I find offending. <br />
<br />
Anon&#39;s that wrote &quot;Getting closer to the Castle&quot; I applaud you for such a good chapter. Sooner or later we&#39;ll probably take in your chapter and integrate it into this line as &quot;canon&quot;.<br />
<br />
[The 1] do reach out and bar out really weak and incomplete chapters from going in again. I know its your choice to take in ideas, however remember we are all humans (kinda) and I myself am overwhelmed at the new elements you&#39;ve brought in and integrated seamlessly into the world. However with that much information to keep track of do you think its appropriate? <br />
<br />
{[Linebreak]}<br />
<br />
Heavy footfalls impacted the cloud ground in a fast pace, its owner genuinely worried of the state of his luggage. Isaac felt up Nat within his body, patted and covered with his bramble vines slithering over her body and glowing gold as he applied [Coalesco Sano].<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Nat, wake up,&quot; Isaac speedwalked faster towards the direction of the mansion, his face molded into the visage of a worried titan. He hissed when the holy magics flared through his corrupted vines, some beginning to deteriorate. &quot;Agh! That hurts...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see that you are having trouble there interesting creature...&quot; A sudden voice called out, immediately rooting Isaac to his steps, frantically scanning his proximity for the source. &quot;Who is there?! Show yourself!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish.&quot; Out of nowhere the area near him shimmered and out walked an old lady, haggard as she may looked. &quot;Now, are you satisfied?&quot; <br />
<br />
Seeing her grin Isaac bared his rows of his sharp ice teeth, somehow his corrupted body could &#39;feel&#39; the magics she had played with.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now who is she?&quot; Ilvir asked, suspicious of the new element within Isaac&#39;s vicinity. Dark Isaac remained silent, whatever he was planning of was unknown.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now, don&#39;t be hissy, sweetie. I&#39;m just here to help, that&#39;s all.&quot; She gave a disarming smile. &quot;Isaac you are very impressive! I&#39;ve never seen a human actually be able to be so versatile! You are a being far surpassing other paladins before you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know my name!&quot; Isaac snarled out to her, unconsciously making his ice fur bristle. &quot;Speak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now shush,&quot; Isaac suddenly found himself frozen, unable to move even a single vine. The vines treating Nat was also frozen. Isaac let out a muffled struggle. &quot;You might recognize me as this instead.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was a single moment that the haggard witch became more haggard, and Isaac remembered. The &quot;YOU!&quot; he was intending to scream was muffled to an internal scream of rage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes I apologize for attempting to take your cock, but its so unique!&quot; She smiled a thoughtful smile, &quot;Though its more better now.&quot; She eyed his crotch and Isaac couldn&#39;t help but feel naked. His armor felt penetrated, and transparent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here.&quot; She beckoned and Isaac found himself walking against his will, kneeling in front of her with slight resistance. &quot;Now spit her out, come on.&quot; Isaac felt like he was being treated as a pet. &quot;Kill her!&quot; Ilvir screamed out, infinitely enraged.<br />
<br />
Like an obedient beast his body opened up, and his vines gently placed Nat to the cloud ground with her body still evaporating. However his involuntary action had given her direct view to what he had within him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my... Is that my mirror?&quot; She asked, and a vine willingly gave it to her hand. &quot;I see that you&#39;re the ones that trespassed.&quot; <br />
<br />
She gave a knowing smile, looking on into the mirror. &quot;Now, Isaac and Nat, you do know that trespassing is an offense correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac tried to nod, knowing that he was indeed guilty. Nat couldn&#39;t even reply. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then you must be punished, after I heal her.&quot; she knelt down, touched Nat and chanted a spell even Isaac couldn&#39;t hear. Soon Nat&#39;s body began to mend, the clouds materializing by its own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Isaac tried to say. He couldn&#39;t heal Nat due to his new nature and limited understanding of Cloud People. However the witch nodded, as if she knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, but it still doesn&#39;t let you off the hook.&quot; She gave a glare only an old woman could give and pocketed the mirror. &quot;My name is Alicia Laverna, resident witch of this mansion. What I do is none of your business.&quot; She looked to Isaac and did a slight bow, &quot;Now you are freed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Immediately his body was entirely under his control again, he closed his body. &quot;Argh, that was uncomfortable...&quot; She gave a smirk and he glared. &quot;Names Isaac Wismon, Paladin of King Vernus.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;King Vernus hmm? I remember him. He is a good king I must say.&quot; She nodded at her findings. &quot;Now that the introductions have been finished now its time for your punishment.&quot; She grinned at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see plant man, there are two trespassers within my mansion as of now, one is a female named Mary and another male named Slar. I want them out and you are my agent.&quot; She then pointed to Nat. &quot;I&#39;ll keep her here to heal. Now this is your mission, alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Waving her hand a map appeared into reality and she took it from its float. &quot;Here you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac took the map reluctantly and gave it a look. Upon seeing the two dots on it Isaac&#39;s eyes widened. He stared hard at the witch with his iceball eyes and glowing rings of undead light, and questioned her. &quot;This is Mary and Slar within your mansion correct?&quot; <br />
<br />
She grinned. &quot;Why yes! You are quite smart. Now what I want you to do is go in there, and get them. I don&#39;t care what you do I want you to get them out of my mansion the most amusing way possible. Now entertain me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to follow her Isaac.&quot; Dark Isaac suddenly spoke, hatred welling up. He does not like being controlled.<br />
<br />
&quot;And do not think of disobeying me, I can do a lot of things to you without your will. Taking your cocks are just some magic that required it. Got it?&quot; She gave a grandmotherly glare that made all three beings within one body flinch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got it...&quot; He reluctantly turned, gave a guilty look towards Nat and started his way to the mansion.<br />
<br />
As soon as Isaac was out of sight Alicia Laverna turned to the sleeping Nat, and gave a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Deity of Clarity chose you, huh. How interesting.&quot;</p>
