<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know Kyle, messing around with you and your life is only half the fun when I am the only one that sees it. But I bet I know a person that would really appreciate to also have some fun with you as her plaything. And wouldn’t you love to see Jennifer again?”<br />
<br />
‘Oh, no!’ Kyle thought, aware of the fact that as soon as his sister called her over, Jennifer gladly would join the revenge train and would quickly take the tracks to a punishment against even hell would look like heaven.<br />
<br />
“From your facial expression I can judge that you also really like the idea. I think it’s perfect.”<br />
<br />
Kyle had to stop her from summoning Jennifer, he simply had to. In a quick response he got down on his knees before his sister, folded his hands as if he was praying “Please Megan don’t do it. I do everything- I mean like really, not only because you commanded me so.”<br />
<br />
He wants her to believe him that he surrenders, so he lets himself sink even deeper, stretching out his hands beneath his head and going down all the way to ground, as if he was praising someone like being a god.<br />
<br />
Megan smirked and in an automatic manner placed forward her right shoe, a brown Ugg boot. But not until long since after hearing a snap, Kyle could see that now boot and sock had vanished and only her pale, dainty bare foot remained. She elegantly placed it on the ground with just the toes and the front of her sole touching it because she lifted her heel.<br />
<br />
She didn’t say anything and just grinned smugly, Kyle exactly knowing what she wanted him to do.<br />
<br />
He couldn’t stop to unbelievingly look up at his sisters, who’s lips had almost elated to a laughter. There was no way that he would kiss her feet. All of it, even if it was just in his mind, felt so humiliating,  as if he could already see himself submissively begging his sister from a third person’s view. No! He had to wait. Yes wait a moment until she orders him and then it will feel for him like being great. Why should he embarrass himself for her when he just could wait until his body would enjoy it?<br />
<br />
“Oh Kyle, doesn’t look like you really mean it,” she pulled her foot away from him “I see we will have to start your training first before you understand your new place.”<br />
<br />
She snapped! What did she do? Was Jennifer now here?! Where was she? But then he saw that Megan had just adjusted her two legs to look similar. Not in the manner that he first thought but now both of her feet were bare and stood on the a little dusty ground.<br />
<br />
As Kyle almost sighed in relief he heard his sister snap a second time and the next moment he could see that now two new legs had appeared just alongside his sister ones. But against his first anticipation they were not long, lightly tanned, dainty and feminine but black socked bare legs, hairy and no sign of a tan to be seen. He knew this legs very well, it were his own ones; what now made sense to him. But it also meant one more thing: she is there!<br />
<br />
Up from his own boxers he then could see the hot body of the perhaps most popular girl in school, a girl that every boy turned his head for even 180° if it was necessary to follow her movement. Kyle wanted to take a look at her full boobs but was disenchanted as he had to remember that he no longer was able to appreciate any girl’s sexy torso pillows; his gaze had immediately jumped to Jennifer’s face. Nearly devilish she returned his gaze, then was turning her head to the right, looking at his sister.<br />
<br />
“Oh, hi Megan.” “Hi Jennifer. How’s it going?” “Well, good. You know, Thursday night, not much you can do until weekend begins.” “Yeah right. But nice that you came over sis, it’s so nice to see you.” “Oh yeah, really like being at your house Megan – well mostly – despite of being around your stupid bratty brother.” “Yeah, you right. But that’s why I called you over. I thought we could spend a bit of <em>quality time</em> with him, but I don’t think he will enjoy it much.” Megan evilly giggled.<br />
<br />
They spoke as if they were longtime friends, like being in the same class since elementary school and almost doing everything together. Undoubtedly an adjustment of his sister and her new powers. Powers that just minutes ago were his but now seem unreachably gone.<br />
<br />
“Oh I would love to help you with this Megan, especially since his last action.” “His last action? What did he do?” “Oh, this little fucker just turned me into a cock jerking idiot, having to please his member right where I was, in front of my friends. Not that he was there, but I had that little perv’s legs and he forced my body to do so, I could do nothing against it; and in this moment it didn’t felt like attached to me, just as if I was giving a handjob to a guy and you know I would never give any guy a handjob, especially not your ugly asshole of a brother.”<br />
<br />
Kyle knew that ‘ugly’ here just was an emphasis of her disgrace, because, he maybe doesn’t has the most muscular body of all time, that’s right, but it is quite well-trained and he also takes care of his clothes and hair. So in the past there were a lot of girls that were interested when they saw him; obviously not Jennifer though.<br />
<br />
“What?! Irrrgggh. How did he do that?- I mean-… wait a minute. That was what you meant when you said that you dealt with her, about 15 minutes ago? You ugly little fucker, that is disgusting. But I don’t understand one thing,” she faced Jennifer again “Don’t you had these legs like ever before, so why is there a change just as of for today?”<br />
<br />
“Oh that’s the next thing he did to me with the curse, he made me switch legs when I lie to someone but no one seeing the difference despite of me and him. And what I first thought was a fun idea, as I to stole his own legs from him, turned out to be a huge mistake since he somehow changed my ability; I couldn’t switch legs anymore with anyone and was stuck with his legs. But most disgustingly, for no apprehend reason, I had the uncontrollable urge to pull down ‘my’ boxers and start working. It was horror! And I can’t get the pictures out of my mind.” Jennifer sighed with desperation.<br />
<br />
“Kyle, you disturbed piece of shit, how can you… – irrg, you’re such a pervert.” Megan referred to Kyle before again turning to Jennifer, wanting to know “He also told me that there were some events between the two of you; that you were cruel and humiliated him. Well at least that is his side of the story.”<br />
<br />
“Hah, that’s what he said? That little rat. As if he was the innocent one. Maybe you should know that this was also the reason for him to yesterday call me and to curse me with the spell of this city. As if he had a reason for revenge.”<br />
<br />
“Please do tell. What did he do?” Kyle’s sister asked referred to Jennifer, who with a bit of reluctance was getting ready to reconstitute the story in her mind.  <br />
<br />
“Well, when he came new to our school half a year ago he like always stared at me all the time I was around. Okay, not <em>that</em> different from most of the guys but he really pushed it to the extreme. Than one day he waylaid me and confronted me, telling me that he thinks I’m hot and wants to go out with me. I didn’t wanted and felt quite insulted by his direct and primitive approach. So I went away. Then he started playing pranks on me, first I didn’t know it was him. One extreme one was that he broke into my locker, and I don’t know how he managed to do it, but he placed a lot of table tennis balls and printed photos with exposed woman’s genitals and breasts in my locker. They all fell out when I opened my locker at morning. Everyone around picking up or looking at the photos and laughing at me. Even a teacher came along a told me to pick up all of <em>my</em> photos or I would get some serious trouble.<br />
<br />
Another time your brother took photos of me in a skirt while the rear part was lifted and exposed my only-in-panties ass; sending the picture to everyone in the whole school. Don’t wanna know how many guys now use it as their screensaver. And as I ,awkwardly, asked some of the boys they said that they had it from Kyle. At that moment I knew that he also did all the other stuff.<br />
<br />
That was when I really got angry and wanted to teach him a lesson. One day after training we saw him on the schoolyard and me and some of the girls from the cheerleader training yanked down his pants to knock him off his perch. Even not many seeing it, for that little rat it was enough to again want revenge on me. After a few weeks calling me to give me the curse and with that some malevolent changes to my body.”<br />
<br />
“Now I understand. God, I had no idea how dastardly my stupid brother is, also towards others. What an asshole. - … but I think that this also means that we have a nice chance of giving it back to him, don’t you think?”<br />
<br />
“Oh I would simply love to…”</p>
