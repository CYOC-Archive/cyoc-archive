<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN Dang, accidental power loss meant I had to write half of this over again) <br />
<br />
Back in time a day or two before Julie had made their second futile attempt with the FBI <br />
that would inspire her the day after to finally meet with the one woman she had chosen to <br />
go to last but was actually the one person who could help her and protect her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit.&quot; Kaylee simply said, and the lighter brown of her copies got onto her hands and knees <br />
sideways, as Kaylee placed her rear on her back, shifting about some getting comfortable. <br />
<br />
Hope's body was a replica of Kaylee's, all the same her muscles tensed at her Alpha <br />
Female's weight being weight on top of her. But muscle memory from cheerleading <br />
(however reluctant she had been at it) helped her stay in position at the hundreds of <br />
pounds of weight on her back that would have broken a human in two.  She didn't <br />
complain, she could not complain, she must not complain, her Alpha female had given her <br />
an order, and she had to obey, this truth screamed through her guts and brain. <br />
<br />
As last night, Kaylee sat back and watched Jensen laid on the bed with the two flanking <br />
him. Kaylee planning to join in after she had pleasured herself enough from the spectacle. <br />
And of course drank in Hope's humiliation at being her chair. She placed a hand on Hope's <br />
head as if it was a hand rest, which it might as well have been, Kaylee's other hand going <br />
to between Kaylee's legs. It was proving to be slightly more tricky in this new form than <br />
when she had done so as Kyle, what with her claws and everything. <br />
<br />
Jensen had Darla below him and Fran on top of him like the layers of a sandwich by the <br />
time Kaylee began to feel the heat her tail weaving behind her. Hope merely laid her tail <br />
flat against her own legs. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone see June?&quot; Megan asked wondering about her handi-wolf partner. <br />
<br />
Alexandra answered as Nick was being pulled into the world of his wet dreams. &quot;June said <br />
she was going to be star gazing with Pearl on the roof. They said they didn't feel like <br />
having sex after Zackery.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah. Wish she had invited me along.&quot; Megan thought, but at least she'd have plenty to <br />
keep her occupied very very soon as the she wolves placed Nick onto the bed like he was <br />
an part of an engine about to start revving up. Nick was very confused at first, then <br />
surprised, then... he couldn't resist his grin at all.   With Nicole leading, the she wolves <br />
dove on top of him. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
After the late lunch, nobody really felt like having dinner. This was an unspoken <br />
agreement among the pack that didn't need a declaration by the Master. As a result of the <br />
lazy day with the addition of Mr. P to break up the tiredness of having had to rebuild half <br />
the house from the inside out.  Pretty much none of the pack knew about Jensen's <br />
excursion outside, and those that knew intended to keep it that way. <br />
<br />
Pearl and June sat outside the male's den after having watched the stars, under the <br />
pretense of making sure Zack didn't cause any trouble, in reality they were there to make <br />
sure no one caused any more trouble for Zackery and he could heal in piece. The Big Bad <br />
Wolves seemed to heal quicker than humans, but Zack would still need a bit more time to <br />
recover. <br />
<br />
&quot;So you told Zackery you plan?&quot; Pearl asked in whispers. <br />
<br />
&quot;When I 'escorted him' to the bathroom yes.&quot; June replied in whispers. <br />
<br />
&quot;And?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He think that if Laura was to double dare harmlessly back at us then we could have our <br />
turns restored without anyone noticing. But... now that I think about it, do you think <br />
reducing the number of males here would -really- be a good idea? What if Zackery can't <br />
handle them all with Lawrence added to our numbers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's Zackery.&quot; Pearl said confidently, &quot;He could handle all of us if need be. I'm sure. The <br />
Master will take what he wants and Nick can take the dissenters who won't accept <br />
Zackery.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;He wouldn't have time for much else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's what he and the other males were added to the pack for to begin with right? To please <br />
any female who wanted pleasure but the Master did not have the desire or pleasure for. <br />
It's his reason for being just as Master is our reason for being.&quot; <br />
<br />
The two noticed the dark brown and splash pattern versions of Kaylee headed their way <br />
and put a cap on the conversation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Said Belle, &quot;You're Silver and Pearl right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;June and Pearl actually.&quot; June corrected. &quot;You're Zackery's friends right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Grace asked politely, &quot;We're here to make sure he's okay after whatever happened <br />
between him and Nicole.  Can we come in?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Pearl said, &quot;We're all equals here. Though Nicole seems to think she's the <br />
voice of the she-wolves as a whole.&quot; Pearl did her best to mention this last part as off <br />
handed as she could. <br />
<br />
Grace and Belle looked at each other both said nothing. <br />
<br />
Pearl and June looked at each other, relieved to see that Zackery wasn't totally alone after <br />
all it seemed. <br />
<br />
The two clinks entered without resistance. <br />
<br />
Zackery spotted his two friends whose bodies were now molded into doubles of the she <br />
wolf who used to be Kyle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Howdy.&quot; Said Belle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; Replied Zackery. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay Zylphia I mean Zackery?&quot; Grace asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;How ya'all doing?&quot; Belle asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm doing as well as can be expected... given what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
'So, Nicole is like Asuka from Neon Genesis?&quot; The closet Okatu Belle asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Only without the inner soul crushing insecurity and everyone seem to like her.&quot; Zackery <br />
replied having seen a couple episodes at Belle's place.  &quot;Have you realized that we didn't <br />
remember any of the household's servants except Martha until we became part of the pack <br />
ourselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace blinked, &quot;Now that you mention it yes. I guess it has something to do with the <br />
'erased previous existence' to cut our ties to our former lives.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you're okay Jensen did that?&quot; Zackery asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's worth it to be with Master.&quot; Grace nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's all worth it to be with Master.&quot; Belle added. <br />
<br />
&quot;I see.&quot; Zackery answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;So where is everybody else?&quot; Grace looked around for Lawrence and the other males. <br />
<br />
&quot;Around.&quot; Zackery said totally honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;So how are you feeling? Okay?&quot; Grace asked, &quot;Considering what happened I mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well enough.. but I wouldn't mind just your company.&quot; <br />
<br />
Grace and Belle looked at each other, Master hadn't told them to return when done, and <br />
Master would be busy with the others all the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Zylphia-Zackery.&quot; Grace said, &quot;We can keep you company for the time being.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Zackery replied. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm. I guess Pearl and June already finished with their star gazing, too bad.&quot; Said Sarah <br />
as she helped Ulysses onto the roof top. &quot;I was hoping we could have some company.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ulysses felt a little scared coming onto the roof top, though the fall would be a annoyance <br />
rather than anything fatal. But he had had a slight fear of heights as far back as he could <br />
remember. &quot;Are you sure we should be up here? What if the roof doesn't hold our weight?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Trust me kiddo.&quot; Sarah said warmly, &quot;It'll hold. The Smiths never did believe in cutting <br />
corners on shoddy materials.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ulysses nodded. &quot;Are you sure we should be up here? Alone? I mean, I'm no good as a <br />
male for the females so--&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah scratched him gently behind the ears, &quot;There's more to life than sex kiddo. Trust me <br />
on this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I thought we weren't the only ones who thought coming up here counted as private <br />
time.&quot;<br />
<br />
The purple and lavender wolves turned to see the teal and blue green Terri and Sandi <br />
climb up on the roof from the opposite end. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... Hello...&quot; Sandi finished. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you girls should be climbing up here after all the garbage you carried <br />
around yesterday?&quot; Sarah asked concerned. <br />
<br />
&quot;We'll manage don't worry.&quot; Terri said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like you're still a stubborn guy at hear Terri.&quot; Sarah quipped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't insult me, I'm a she-wolf through and through.&quot; Terri retorted then spotted Ulysses. <br />
&quot;Uh, present company accepted of course.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY!&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone turned to see Jasmine struggling to climb up from the BACK of the house <br />
apparently running into some trouble not of the small kind. &quot;Room for one more?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Regular Star Trek convention Terri quipped as all the wolves present quickly added their <br />
packmate onto the roof. No one bothered to correct Terri on her misuse of the term. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
In the coed den, Lawrence looked at the three females in front of him. &quot;Are you sure this <br />
isn't pity sex?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Look.&quot; The blue pattern Ashley said, &quot;You're bored, we're bored, we all worked hard <br />
yesterday and then some. We could all use something to unwind, and we're all <br />
heterosexuals here. And most of us aren't into masturbation. And sexual inhabitation went <br />
out the window when once the wold ears came in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to if you don't want to.&quot; The dark blue Caroline promised, &quot;There wouldn't <br />
be much point to it if we just forced ourselves on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is SO much irony in that for this culture.&quot; Red-violet Margot responded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Margot we know.&quot; Caroline said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're not just doing this to get back at Zack are you?&quot; Lawrence asked thinking. <br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Caroline said firmly. The two other nodded. &quot;Sarah would be here too but apparently <br />
she wanted to show Ulysses around.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't think she was into that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Margot!&quot; Ashley sounded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Just kiddin'.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was reborn into the pack to service any female who needed servicing.&quot; Lawrence said in <br />
a dutiful voice, &quot;If you want some, I'll give you some. I apologize for not being built like <br />
Nick or Zackery, but I'll try my hardest to please you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then.&quot; Ashley said wrapping her arms around him, &quot;Let's begin.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello again.&quot; Said Alice wearing a night gown laying on the floor in the mirror's reflection. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice!&quot; Abbey greet jumping off the bed in her own night gown. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shush.&quot; Samatha said, &quot;You'll wake mom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sorry.&quot; Alice did her traditional curtsy laying down. <br />
<br />
&quot;So is daddy coming back yet?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes is he? Mom's acting a little funny.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet. Everyone agreed though that yes you guys can get to be with him soon along <br />
with your mother.&quot; Alice said. She was careful not to refer to her as 'auntie.' Being so close <br />
to her cousins but not being able to pull them into the mirror world to become like her or <br />
even say about her relations was slightly maddening, but Alice put a brave face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can we come inside yet?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;We?&quot; Samatha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on sis! I know you're curious too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We... maybe a little...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Curiosity is a fabulous thing.&quot; Alice said. &quot;I can tell you a few things about when you'll get <br />
to join. Once I help you inside, you'll be able to enter and leave mirrors all on your own.&quot; <br />
<br />
Samatha's eyebrows raised at this. <br />
<br />
&quot;Really? Cool!&quot; Abbey said intrigued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is very fabulous.&quot; Alice nodded, Abbey sitting across from her on the floor now like <br />
Alice was Abbey's reflection. &quot;Inside the mirrors you can go anywhere in three steps as <br />
long as there is a mirror there to walk out of.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you use a mirror to go to Narnia?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
Alice thought, &quot;I have not tried to go to Narnia. But I think I can only go to mirrors <br />
connected to this outside world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Outside world?&quot; Samtha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am inside the mirror. It is a world. You are outside the mirror. That is a world. Therefore <br />
it is the outside world.&quot; <br />
<br />
The girls conceded to this logic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you go to the Space Hug-bell tell-lee-scope?&quot; Samatha asked thinking of her solar <br />
system book (which still said Pluto was a planet), &quot;Or the space Voyager probe?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice was surprised by the question, she thought about this really hard and answered, &quot;I <br />
do not know. I have not tried to go to those places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you wouldn't able to breath anyway.&quot; Samantha said off handedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are right, I would not be able to.&quot; Alice said honestly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Have you been in the boy's bathroom?&quot; Abbey asked innocently. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not! That would be highly improper!&quot; Alice said sounding offended. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... sorry, I didn't mean to.&quot; Abbey hugged against the glass and Alice carefully did the <br />
same, not accidently falling out. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what's it like in there?&quot; Abbey asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;You can find out for yourself once you're inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is life without surprises?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
Abbey fumed a little, but accepted that answer, more determined than ever to get a look <br />
inside there once the chance was offered.  <br />
<br />
Samantha knew she'd likely have to come inside too, figuring she'd have to help Abbey not <br />
get eaten by a mirror monster or something. And while Abbey was marking off places of <br />
fantasy she'd want to try to go to once inside the mirror, Samantha was thinking of the <br />
nine planets and the Seven Wonders of the world she could observe from the safety of the <br />
mirror world. The idea was rather tempting.  Both girls were too young to be paranoid. <br />
<br />
Alice was pleased she had stirred the curiosity in her cousins. She under no circumstances <br />
would ever lie to them (that would be the -height- of improper), nor would she give them <br />
false information (which was just lying again now that Alice thought of it). But if they were <br />
encouraged to accept her invite into the world of mirrors by their own conclusions (as long <br />
as they were not incorrect), Alice saw no reason to say anything else.  Alice was. At her <br />
heart after all. A Big Bad Wolf cub and Jensen's child. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-ho, I think mom might be coming!&quot; Samtha said quickly to the two girls near the <br />
mirror. <br />
<br />
&quot;I should speak with her.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Naw! Let's keep it for when daddy comes home! What's life without surprises?&quot; Abbey <br />
quiped Alice's previous statement. <br />
<br />
&quot;Very well. I hope to see you both again soon.&quot; Alice said totally sincere at the idea of <br />
speaking with her cousins again. <br />
<br />
&quot;You too.&quot; Abbey and Samantha said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Goodnight.&quot; Alice curtsy one last time and hurried out of frame, Abbey getting back into <br />
bed before their mother happened by their bedroom door having missed the discussion <br />
between the girls and the mirror wolf and thus heard nothing and saw no reason to enter. <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;And where were you?&quot; Mr. P asked Alice as she came back into frame in the vanity mirror <br />
in the cub's bedroom. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was saying goodnight to my cousins. They'll be joining the pack in a day or two. And I <br />
wanted to let them know everything is alright.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, family should stay together.&quot; Mr. P said simply. <br />
<br />
Jenny thought of a few more things she could do before sleeping as she inched off the <br />
bed. Mr. P growled lowly instantly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, bathroom?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Never try to lie to my face Jenny, you were never any good at it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes grandpa.&quot; <br />
<br />
The wolf cubs laid back in bed, Kevin and Marcy sniggering at Jenny's slight humiliation. <br />
The cubs slept soundly with the gargoyles, Martha, and Mr P, offering three lines of <br />
defenses to their safety in their own way more secure then Jensen and his harem. They <br />
were the pack's future after all.</p>
