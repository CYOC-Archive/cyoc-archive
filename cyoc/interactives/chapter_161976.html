<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I won&#39;t wait any longer!!&quot; John yelled as he rolled the dice and then moved his piece on a plus space. &quot;Excellent!! I&#39;ll show ladies who is the real alpha man on here!!&quot; He eagerly peered into the black circle waiting for a big number. However, a +2 appeared. &quot;Aw man!!&quot; He shouted as he felt his body growing a little, going from 5 to 7 years old. He definitely got taller but he barely changed at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! You look like me!!&quot; Paul said as he stared at his former older brother. &quot;I mean, when I was 7...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just roll the dice...&quot; John told Paul as he crossed a little upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; Paul threw his dice and then he moved his game piece. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s a plus space!!&quot; The waited a little until the number appeared in the black circle. &quot;+5, cool!! I&#39;ll be... 21, 22, 23... 26 years old!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad for you...&quot; John sarcastically told his brother as he watched Paul getting older. Well, it&#39;s mostly noticeable on his muscles and body hair. The muscles bulking up and the body hair thickening. He looked like a model. &quot;Are you expecting us to see your chest hair all day? Put on your shirt!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s torn...&quot; Paul sheepishly said as he watched the torn clothes under his manly feet. &quot;I reckon it wasn&#39;t a good idea after all...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, bro. I&#39;m with you!&quot; Ellis told Paul as he took the dice. &quot;We have to show off these manliness as long as we have it! John is just jealous because his balls hadn&#39;t dropped yet.&quot; He cockily smiled as he watched the anger in John&#39;s face. He threw the dice and moved his piece through the game board. It landed on a minus space. John grinned a little at that moment, but when a -12 appeared in the black circle, his grin turned into a big laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahaha!! That&#39;s karma!!&quot; John mocked as he watched Ellis&#39; chest hair sucking inside his skin. His muscle quickly deflated and his height shot down until he was as small as John, maybe a little bit more smaller than him. &quot;Whose balls hadn&#39;t dropped yet?!! Hahaha!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up John... It&#39;s not funny!&quot; Ellis yelled in a squeaky childish voice as he stared at his hairless thin chest. He lifted his skinny arms just to see that the former thick bushes on his pits were no more. &quot;Really? Not even one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your turn, Bob.&quot; Jack said as he gave the dice to the ginger boy. &quot;If we stop each time someone changes, my father will arrive before we finish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok.&quot; Bob shyly nodded as he took the dice and threw it on the game board. Then, he moved his space. &quot;It&#39;s a plus space.&quot; He said but he didn&#39;t sound excited at all, he sounded kinda scared. He shuddered a little as he waited for the number in the black circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;+8&quot; Jack said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my-!&quot; Bob shuddered again but this time it was because he was getting older. He grew almost a foot taller, his arms and legs lengthened and bulked out with muscle accordingly. His hands and feet as well, but he didn&#39;t noticed it because his shoes got bigger to still fit him. As his back and chest broadened his shirt went from kid to adult size. His pants did the same and, unknown it, his Batman undies got bigger too. When he stopped growing he couldn&#39;t help but moan a little. He didn&#39;t know why but he was very tempted to put a hand on his groin.<br />
<br />
&quot;You grew up pretty good.&quot; Jack told his shy friend. &quot;No facial hair and a lean athletic body.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I feel kinda awkward.&quot; Bob said as he started to scratch his chest and armpits. &quot;I feel itchy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt that way too before I took my shirt off.&quot; Paul told Bob. &quot;Let me help you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait!&quot; Bob shyly stuttered as Paul pull his shirt off.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s better, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Paul said. &quot;Wow! I thought you didn&#39;t have body hair because of your face but your quite hairy instead!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bob looked at his exposed armpits and when he noticed the thick bushes of hair on them he immediately covered them in shame. Then he saw the rug of red hair on his chest and stomach and immediately tried to covered it with his bigger hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, give me my shirt back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! That&#39;s very cool Bob!!&quot; Jack smiled. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to have a rug of chest hair of my own! New rule!! Anyone who gets past 18 will have to go shirtless!&quot; Everybody agrees, although Bob didn&#39;t like it, but he was too shy to say it aloud. &quot;Now it&#39;s my turn!!&quot;  Jack took the dice and began to shake it in his hands. &quot;Come on! I want a +10!!&quot; He threw the dice and moved his piece to a plus space. &quot;Yeeeesss!!!&quot; He cheered with a big grin on his face. However, instead of the +10 he was expecting, he got another +1. &quot;Aww!! Really?!!&quot; He yelled as he slowly grew back to his original age.<br />
<br />
At the end of the second round, John had grown a little to 7 year old, Paul had aged more into a 26 year old young man, Ellis had shot down from 18 to 6 years old, Bob had suddenly become legal as he turned into a hairy 21 year old guy, and Jack had gone back to his original age of 9 years old. After watching the shy Bob becoming into a handsome hairy man, John was eager to get some hair on him, he grabbed the dice, whispered something to it and then threw it to the game board.</p>
