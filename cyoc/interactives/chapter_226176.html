<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You guys have been so good. I&#39;m so proud of you.&quot; Tyler panted as he pulled down his boxer-briefs, the tight red-purple head of his rock-hard cock slapping against his muscular tummy and leaving a shiny wet spot behind. The second he started stroking himself he knew he wouldn&#39;t last long - ideally he&#39;d get off in a more exciting way, but he was desperate and his potential partners were too spent to do anything but act as canvases for his seed. &quot;Just lay back and relax while Uncle Tyler takes care of himself...&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the instruction and despite being completely drained, the boys couldn&#39;t help but sit up in wide-eyed wonder as the teen&#39;s pride sprung free and strained majestically into the open air. Tyler&#39;s equipment was in reality fairly average, but to Mattie and Davie - who were rapidly forgetting that their grown-up equipment dwarfed that of their unexpected seducer - his dribbling rod might as well have been a baseball bat jutting out from his groin and his low-hanging balls might as well have been hairy grapefruits. The astonished teen felt as though his dreams were coming true when the pair stirred and crawled towards his throbbing prick, which somehow managed to grow even harder with two beautiful young boys staring at it from mere millimeters away. Tyler groaned when Mattie and Davie caught a whiff of his teen musk, blushing and snickering and wriggling as their itty-bitty weewees sprung back to life - as their stiffies waggled adorably between their baby-smooth thighs with every little movement they made. <br />
<br />
&quot;You...you can give it a kiss, if you want.&quot; Tyler murmured, afraid that he might bust if either boy so much as breathed too hard on his ultra-sensitive penis. &quot;Like I did for Mattie. But only if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mattie and Davie frowned at one another for a moment.<br />
<br />
Then they simultaneously kissed the head of Tyler&#39;s dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God.&quot; A wide-eyed Tyler whispered. None of his experiences with kids had ever been this wild, this thrilling, this fantasy-fulfilling. Having sampled the teen&#39;s salty flesh, both boys were more than happy to keep kissing him on his thingy if it meant getting more of that enticing grown-up taste. Tyler shuddered and bit his lip to keep from coming when Mattie and Davie advanced from kisses to licks, in doing so getting their first sample of the clear, sticky liquid dribbling down his pulsing shaft. Both boys shivered as the salty, satisfying flavor coated their palates, both knowing immediately that they needed to have more of whatever Tyler&#39;s peepee was producing. Though the mystery liquid was strangely familiar to the cocksucking tots, neither could wrap their little minds around the concept that their tiny hairless marbles had once been as massive and productive as those dangling freely within Tyler&#39;s low-hanging sack. All they were concerned with was lapping up as much of the stuff as much as possible, so much so that both were practically making out with the tip of the teen&#39;s overstimulated prick. Their shared, childish attempt at fellatio was so unbelievably, wonderfully <b>wrong</b>...and their small, hardworking mouths were so hot and soft...and Davie and Mattie were just so cute, so beautiful, so unbelievably sexy with their young, smooth, warm little bodies...and...and...<br />
<br />
It was the orgasm of Tyler&#39;s life. His roar shook the walls of the small bedroom as his pleasure receptors were overwhelmed by input, shaking and shouting and rolling his eyes back in his head as he shot and shot and shot and shot and shot. The moment seemed infinite and Tyler wondered if the entirety of his essence was spurting from the end of his dick, if this is what it felt like to die while making love. Thankfully, regretfully, eventually the crashing, shuddering waves of pleasure withdrew until there was nothing but the steady tide of his afterglow. Tyler might&#39;ve fallen asleep standing up were he not snapped out of his post-coital trance by the bubbly giggles of two naughty little boys. He blinked himself back into consciousness and whimpered when his softening cock twitched painfully at the gorgeous sight before him. <br />
<br />
Tyler had painted both Mattie and Davie with his seed, hot thick strands of the stuff splashed against their thighs and chests and tummies and cheeks. Far from being disgusted by the copious emissions, both were as greedy to gulp it down as they had been with his pre. The five and six-year-old squealed and squirmed as they swiped their fingers in puddles of the stuff and sucked those sticky fingers dry - as they licked each other clean, cooing and sighing as their tiny tongues explored each other&#39;s immature, delicious little bodies. Both were somehow rock-hard once more,  weenies glistening with Tyler&#39;s spunk and making it clear to the gobsmacked teen that they were ready for another round. The sixteen-year-old chuckled and wiped the sweat from his brow, wondering if he had indeed died during his last climax and ascended to heaven. It might be a little while before he could cum again, but he was determined to help Mattie and Davie get their tinglies at <i>least</i> once more in the meantime.<br />
<br />
It was as Tyler considered the most pleasurable way to get these sex-crazed kiddos off again that he was overcome by the strangest feeling, a warm numb blanket that wrapped itself tightly around his sweat-drenched form. Confused, the frowning teen looked down - and his heart plunged into his stomach when he realized that his mighty penis wasn&#39;t getting smaller just because it was softening - it was <i>actually shrinking!</i> At the same time, Tyler&#39;s loose sack was quickly growing tinier, tighter, smoother, the thick coarse hairs that crowned his  manhood retreating into his skin - all the hair on his body, in fact, receding in a bizarre, intense pins-and-needles sensation that made the regressing boy shiver and whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well.&quot; Tyler spun to see a smirking Nate behind him, holding what looked to be a small tablet in his hands. &quot;I come back to get my keys, and what do I find? My boyfriend messing around with my cute little dads. The three of you having fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your...<I>DADS?!</I>&quot; Tyler squeaked, blushing and bringing a hand to his throat at the cracking of his rising voice. Davie and Mattie might&#39;ve been humiliated by being outed had they heard a word Nate had said - both were so fascinated by Tyler growing smaller and cuter with each passing second that the rest of the world had dropped away, both tykes tugging absently on their stiff little nails as they stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed at the rapid undevelopment of his fascinatingly masculine form. &quot;You mean...<i>you</i> did this to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! And since you like kids so much, I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t mind being one again.&quot; Nate&#39;s grin grew hungry as he looked Tyler up and down, as he realized that the one-time stud  was now barely pubescent - skinny and boyish with the barest dusting of hair beneath his arms and a small patch of dwindling curls clinging to his diminished package. The teen&#39;s cock pulsed impatiently against the fly of his jeans at the thought that he&#39;d been the one to strip his boyfriend of his hard-won maturity - that he&#39;d be the one to render him an adorable, hopelessly horny little boy. &quot;The only question is, how young should Ty-Ty get?</p>
