<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Out of habit Jennifer began to &quot;bite&quot; absentmindedly at Michelle&#39;s panties, relishing the sensations it brought her lips and body. Every time Michelle would see a cute boy at the school that oh so wonderful twinge of pleasure and warmth would shock her body before turning into a low constant burn. More boys? More nibbles to the panties. It quickly became her nervous tick like chewing on a pencil or a lock of hair if she was human. Oh gods, Jennifer couldn&#39;t help but shiver as she imagined what a pencil could do to her in this form!! Gods, she just couldn&#39;t take her mind OFF of stimulation, of cocks, of being touched! She still had humanity left? She was a real girl? AS IF!! She couldn&#39;t think straight like this! And who was Michelle of all people to tell her what to do?! She.... she liked this. As disgusting as she would have found it before, she actually liked this and couldn&#39;t think of anybody else she&#39;d rather be a part of. <br />
<br />
Her lips quivered more as she eased off the panties in her lips, clenching and settling in. Yeah... she liked this a lot! It was comfortable! It was so warm and nice, so cozy. She was a perfect fit. The spirit was right, without a doubt she was right! She LOVED this!! It was weird for Jen to think like this. GODS would she normally be so pissed off right now! She&#39;d want Kyle dead right now!! If he thought being pantsed was bad, she&#39;d make his life miserable!! But... she didn&#39;t feel that way, she was actually well... grateful for it? Jen felt a blush wash over her at the thought. As a human she could have had anything she wanted, she had a maid, she had the best in designer outfits, everything was just a call away and yet having everything taken away from her and being forced into being the sex organ of her mortal enemy she was honestly deeply grateful for. Maybe... maybe Kyle even deserved a few of her special kisses for it? Oh man did that make her blush. When the hell did she become so damn cute? Special Kisses? Jen couldn&#39;t help but laugh to herself. <br />
<br />
Seriously? Now she was laughing? She was the pussy of her mortal enemy... of someone she thought was her mortal enemy, laughing, pleasuring her, wishing for her touch, wanting to suck on the cock of the guy who did this to her, and most sickeningly sweet of all she was being adorable!! No, she didn&#39;t want this to stop ever. Lightly she bit at the panties again and began to suckle. It took her literally losing everything and losing who she was to find happiness but here it was... she liked being a part of Michelle more than she the.. well... the kinda horrible bitch she was before. Gods that sucked!! She had her whole life ahead of her and every advantage and what did she do with it? She threw it all away just to be a total bitch all the time, Michelle had practically nothing but somehow she managed to figure out how to at least be liked and popular... even if the bitch was a total slut! GODS what a bitch... hehe, but she was her bitch. <br />
<br />
Jen was so lost in her thoughts that the usual hum of the distant people, the sound of Michelle&#39;s heels, all of that distant noise wasn&#39;t even registering to her anymore. She began wetly smacking her lips and trying to clench so she could crumble up the front of Michelle&#39;s panties so she could straddle them between her lips. Any time Michelle would shift her weight, that pinched length of fabric would run between her lips and clit roughly sending a jolt of pleasure racing through them both! Then, Jen would clench and smack her lips until she managed to get those panties back where they belonged.<br />
<br />
She would spend the rest of her day pulsing, smacking and clenching her lips, and just thinking about her life in strange impulses rather than worded thoughts. Her future was gone, the girl she could have been was gone, and now after that last visit with the spirit she was getting better and just switching off and being. But that being said Jennifer learned that she kinda liked being able to think, being aware of what she was and reminded every time that Michelle&#39;s thigh rubbed against her. <br />
&quot;God DAMN, Jen are you trying to get us thrown out of school or are you just trying to embarrass me since you know we&#39;re stuck together?&quot; Michelle demanded as she all but tore her clothing off and dove to her bed.<br />
&quot;Are you even listening? Jen? Jen are you okay?&quot; asked Michelle as her anger turned to concern at the continued silence from Jen, her hands frozen at her breasts.<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m fine, I was just thinking.&quot; Jen answered in a distracted but amused tone.<br />
&quot;Jen don&#39;t freaking do that to me! You nearly gave me a heart attack or something! Jeez! I thought you like... just faded away or something.&quot; Michelle sighed.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll answer you more quickly next time Mistress. I promise, I&#39;ll be such a good pussy for you.&quot; Jen purred in a strange sensual and sultry way.<br />
&quot;Mistress? Seriously? You&#39;ve been thinking about that old lady again?! I told you already Jenn, you are a girl and need to stay strong. You&#39;re not meant to be my pussy! We&#39;ll figure this out or something!&quot;<br />
&quot;Mmm.. I think I am actually,&quot; Jenn&#39;s lips grew hot and wet a her thoughts<br />
&quot;Jeeeeeen s-stop! You&#39;ve been winding me up all day! This isn&#39;t fair!! I can&#39;t talk to you if you keep this up! I barely made it home!&quot; Michelle protested.<br />
&quot;Michelle shut up! You know, I could be really mad at you! I could be a total bitch and make it so you&#39;d be just a moaning lusty whore for the rest of your life! Making me pee all the time, calling your little boy toy in to tease me, using me to pleasure whoever the hell Jeff even is, fingering me in front of Kyle just to shut me up! YOU&#39;RE the one who was fingering me when that damn spirit contacted me! If there was any reason I couldn&#39;t think straight it would be because you&#39;re so much of a whore that you even finger yourself in your sleep!!&quot; Jen quickly hissed.<br />
<br />
The words struck Michelle rather deeply as she laid there naked on the bed poised to finger and pleasure herself AGAIN. She wasn&#39;t confrontational naturally.... and.... she felt like Jen had a point. true they were enemies but she never would have wanted to rob someone&#39;s life and future away from them. Was that really what happened? Was it her dreams and wandering hands that dashed any chance Jen had to turning back? <br />
&quot;I&#39;m....sorry Jen...&quot; was all Michelle could muster as her breath left her lungs.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be! ...Kyle was right.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wha-AH!?&quot; Michelle tried to ask before Jennifer began to tremble her lips and encourage a growing wave of arousal to race through her.<br />
&quot;Kyle was absolutely right! I&#39;m your sex organ. Stop thinking like I&#39;m someone, stop offering me things, stop telling me to be strong or that I&#39;m a human!! That human girl you&#39;re crying over is a bitch! And that Bitch is saying she&#39;s taking over down here and there&#39;s nothing you can do about!! I&#39;m cozy down here.... I... I like it down here. I chose to be so mean all the time and this is what it got me! I don&#39;t want to be Jennifer the cheerleader anymore!! I want to be Jen, Michelle&#39;s best feature! I want to be your pussy... the spirit was right, I gave that up I actually really really want this! I&#39;m stuck like this anyway so it&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to get rid of me! I like it and I&#39;m staying! So... just stop trying to make me go back to the way things were! Because I don&#39;t wanna! I&#39;m staying right here on a sweet, kindhearted slut and I&#39;m going to make her feel sooo SOOOO good.&quot; Jen began to hum dreamily.<br />
&quot;Jen, you don&#39;t have to punish... MY BEST FEATURE? SLUT?&quot; Michelle reeled as she looked down to her trembling pussy watching as her lips quivered and a giggle echoed in her mind.<br />
&quot;I mean that in a nice way Mistress!! MMmmmm yeah, my owner, my body! Let me make you feel good! Just slip me a few fingers and I&#39;ll make you GLAD that that other me is gone! I&#39;m going to own this thing. Mmmmmroooowl!! You want me to be a good little pussy don&#39;t you? Mmmmmeooooow! Mistress, gods please touch me! I&#39;ve got a lot of things to make up to you. I&#39;ll mewl and purr like a good pussy if you want! Call Jeff, WAIT! NO! Go to Kyle!! Hehehe I want to give him some of my special kisses! I&#39;m going to be so sweet and cute you&#39;ll wanna barf!! I&#39;m all yours Michelle, tell me what you want me to say, what you want to be. Because Michelle, I know you&#39;re just as much of a whore as I am. You can&#39;t lie to me, you enjoy this as much as I do! You don&#39;t have to worry about a thing. I&#39;ll keep my mind, you&#39;re not going to get rid of me that easily! You&#39;re going to have to live with me forever!&quot; Jen panted.</p>
