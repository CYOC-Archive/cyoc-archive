<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A little bit latter that day Bastet was wandering around the multi-verse as a goddess. She wondered how old Serra was doing ever since her fellow gods and The First left. The cat goddess was half assuming the world was just dead, and was kind of happy  to see that living souls were still on the world on her first glance... Then she looked at the school that Katherine was in, and immediately scowled at someone blowing a beast hunting whistle at a cat  girl. This upset her however this had happened before she had left and after having talked to the other gods she generally didn&#39;t let this get her too angry as long as the beast person didn&#39;t have a soul or if the people didn&#39;t know the beast person had a soul. Finally she noticed that Katherine had a Soulbrand on her... and the particular Soulbrand was known as the Eye of Bastet. Really quickly she checked over the world and all she could think was &quot;How many years has it been since people have known beast people have had souls? How many contributions have beast people made to every society?&quot; She sensed around the world and noticed no other gods around. Bastet then thought to herself &quot;Time to flex my power a little... I suppose I should go ahead and help that first cat girl. Have someone young and fresh... This world is so outdated and could use a young priestess with kind hearted ideals. <br />
<br />
Katherine currently was huddled in a corner in an alley while Stan was playing a modified flute away from the alley. That way it seemed like he was practicing the flute while the only beast girl in school was trapped listening to the extremely high pitch noise which she couldn&#39;t do anything about. Emily of course noticed and was trying to explain what was going on to some teachers... although this was kind of tricky to do considering on the surface nothing seemed to be wrong at all, except that Stan was playing one really really long song. <br />
One moment Katherine then stopped hearing the high pitched noise and then started only hearing the bad music, and then a voice told her &quot;Get up, you don&#39;t have to be afraid of that small bug playing music anymore.&quot; Katherine put her hand to her side and stood up. She opened her eyes and then walked right to Stan and then swiped his flute when he didn&#39;t realize she was behind him. <br />
Stan looked and then his eyes widened when he saw Katherine, and then something compelled Katherine to close her eyes and then play a single note for awhile. After a few minutes Katherine stopped playing and then opened her eyes and saw that instead of seeing a boy where Stan was she saw some odd creature... She then recognized Stan as a type of beastman... well a Rat boy.<br />
A concerned but friendly voice called out &quot;Kitty! What happened!?!&quot; Katherine turned and saw Emily... and then her eyes widened as she had shrank a bit, changed her posture a little, grew whiskers and her ears were on top of her head... For one reason or another Emily and a staff member she had brought with her were now beast people... and Emily the cat girl looked  like she was even the same breed as Katherine. Emily ran up to Katherine on all fours and said &quot;Calm down... Your breathing so hard and have a very... furious look on your face. What&#39;s going on with that aura your radiating?&quot; <br />
Katherine looked at her arm and saw that she was radiating some sort of aura and then said &quot;I&#39;m not sure... I was being tormented and then... I just felt compelled to play this flute.&quot; <br />
An ancient voice then boomed from Katherine&#39;s whole body &quot;That was my Boon to you little Katherine. I am Bastet Goddess of the beast people. I have came back to this world and have seen that the  Beast men are treated as poorly as they ever have. So I&#39;ve decided to come back with a new young, kind hearted priestess. That whistle you have blown I have given the name Beast&#39;s Empathy. Whenever you Katherine play that flute anyone who hears it will change into a Beast person, now while I shall leave to go help leave the impression that I have come back I shall leave part of me inside you so  no harm shall come to you or those you love.&quot; A moment latter the aura vanished although Katherine could still feel something inside of her. <br />
Stan was whimpering to himself and slowly backing away to a safe distance. It was kind of understandable considering now he was looking at two potentially predators and his instincts were telling him to run away. The staff member having turned into a falcon quickly flew over to Stan, picked him up, and then quickly flew to the main office where he dropped Stan off and started quickly telling everyone what had just happened. <br />
Emily looking at Katherine then said &quot;Well this is interesting... I think this is the first time I ever looked up to you on level ground.&quot; Emily then finding some courage asked &quot;So did Bastet tell you if there was a way to reverse this? I may not hate beast people, but this body just feels... weird... I&#39;m just not comfortable right now.&quot; <br />
Katherine said &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s reversible. If Bastet comes back I can ask but. I just don&#39;t know... I don&#39;t get what Bastet was talking about by making me a Priestess either.&quot; <br />
Emily then smiled and then said &quot;Well... I guess we&#39;ll figure what&#39;ll happen together right?&quot; <br />
Katherine smiled and then nodded hoping things would turn out well.</p>
