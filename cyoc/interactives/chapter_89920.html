<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, I have to say that I&#39;m more than pleased with this new... present from you.&quot; Joe did look pleased.<br />
<br />
He looked at the magic pen slowly rotating it in his fingers. I looked at it too wondering if I will ever get the chance to get hold of it again, to restore myself to normalcy. The way I felt made me fear that would be much harder than I&#39;d imagined. For every thought of defiance, my new body produced a sinking feeling in the bottom of my stomach. Similar to the one I remember from when I was almost robbed at gunpoint a few years ago. A thought was slowly creeping into my mind that perhaps Danielle&#39;s body was simply to physically afraid of challenging Joe for me to succeed. It wasn&#39;t an optimistic thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;But now let&#39;s get to the reason why I called you here.&quot; Gently, he put the pen down and looked straight at me. His gaze briefly traveled down to my chubbier chest but quickly returned to looking me in the eye. My heart started beating faster, whether it was from my fear or Danielle&#39;s excitement I could not tell.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s past lunchtime now.&quot; He said with a wicked smile. &quot;But our mutual friend is getting a little restless again... Get over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stood from behind his desk pushing his chair behind. I stood up too, just to walk up to him. As I moved I could clearly feel the fatty sacks stuck to my chest wobble.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t lie saying my breasts weren&#39;t heavy. How does one define heavy anyway? Strictly speaking a heavy bag is one you are struggling to lift for extended periods of time. And that Danielle boobs weren&#39;t. That didn&#39;t change the fact that I could, undeniably feel their presence on my chest and it did make me uncomfortable. Their weight, unsupported by any bra was enough to make me feel tugging on the skin around my pectorals as I moved. I knew that was only going to get worse, thanks to Joe&#39;s most recent Magic Pen use.<br />
<br />
Standing right next to upright Joe gave me a sense of my new, diminished height. I had to look up to meet his eye, otherwise I&#39;d have to stare at the upper part of his tie. My guess was he had around 8 inches over me. Perhaps even 10 considering I was wearing heels. Before my transformation I was a hair taller than him...<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have long to ponder on the new height differences as a sound of a belt buckle being dealt with and a harsh &quot;On your knees!&quot; got me to the ground before I had the chance to even think about what was happening. Joe reached into his pants and pulled out his already semi hard cock. Slightly bobbing it quickly sprung to it&#39;s full length, pointed slightly upwards and threatening to poke me in my neck. It was of a pretty average size as far as penises go but as it dawned on me what I was expected to do with it, in my mind it became an enormous monster.<br />
<br />
When I was making myself into Danielle I was kind of aware this might happen. But that was back before I realized I forgot to put time limits on my position. That was back when I had a choice. Now when I was forced by the circumstances to be where I was I couldn&#39;t imagine how I thought that was anything but a terrible idea.<br />
<br />
And yet... My eyes felt drawn to the organ in front of me and my tongue was already restless behind my slightly parted lips. I felt a twitch and some warmth in my crotch too followed by a strange feeling in my lower abdomen. It wanted, it needed something to happen... I wasn&#39;t quite sure what. I also became slowly aware of the way the fabric of my shirt was resting against my nipples. They felt tighter and I was pretty sure there must have been goosebumps all over my breasts.<br />
<br />
Was that how female arousal felt like? Was I getting aroused at the thought  of sucking Joe off?<br />
<br />
My heart rate went up and I started breathing faster. The sinking feeling of fear returned to my stomach but the way it mixed with the other feeling, the one further down south, made me want to get even more of it. I felt so scared as I raised my hands to grasp Joe&#39;s member. I felt it&#39;s veiny skin under my delicate fingers and something in my groin twitched once again.<br />
<br />
I have never, ever felt so degraded in my life...<br />
<br />
I pointed it towards my lips, then slouched some so I could reach it when...<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!..&quot; Joe&#39;s voice made me jump a little and let go of his cock.<br />
<br />
Another man&#39;s penis was but two inches from my mouth, ready to be sucked and what did I feel when it was prevented? Relief but also disappointment and intensification of all those feelings in my body which made me reach out for it in the first place.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it, Master?&quot; my voice was quiet and trebling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I an idea, girl.&quot; he bent down to his desk picking up the pen. &quot;Why should you strain your pretty little back slouching when we can do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
I saw him scribble something down and then a shiver run UP my spine from my tailbone to my neck making it feel funny. I moved my head to the sides and around to shake off the feeling. And when I looked straight in front of me again... Joe&#39;s dick was pointing straight at my mouth. And not at my lower neck. I looked up to Joe, his face even further up than it was a few seconds ago. I must have lost another three to four inches in height! Now I most definitely joined the sub-five-foot club. And my guess was not just by a hair. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now do what you are mean to do&quot; Joe threw at me impatient. &quot;And use your hands to play with my balls...&quot;<br />
<br />
Resigned, I was helpless but to comply with his command. In my small hands his testicles felt like large eggs and as I felt the salty taste of his pre-cum on my tongue the pussy between my legs twitched again. I made a small whimper of part-humiliation, part-fear and part-fulfillment when my lipsticked lips closed around the head of his penis.</p>
