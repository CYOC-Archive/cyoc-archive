<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The changes started subtly. The five o&#39;clock shadow on Henry&#39;s face retreated back into his skin. This was followed up one of an opposite nature. His hairline, a front had been on the retreat for the past decade advanced back across his scalp, thickening as it reclaimed lost territory and expanding. Soon enough locks were tumbling down head. The same rough thing happened to the twins as their hair poured down to their shoulders. Not that they paid it much attention besides attempting grab it. <br />
<br />
At that point a common change happened for all of them as their hair pulled itself up and teased itself from simple ponytails and mops. For Linda this was the most subtle as it shortened from an simple shoulder length cut into a stylish short bob that framed her head quite nicely. For Debra a functional ponytail formed itself into a beehive. Rick, Sam and Henry both developed hairstyles which involved large elaborate curls. Normally such dos would require a fair deal of reinforcement by pins and hairspray, but somehow they did fine without.<br />
<br />
All the while the features began to steadily soften on the men of the family. Lips filled out, eyelashes extended and adam&#39;s apples receded. Their voices became more high pitched.  The changes soon spread outward. For Henry this was the most pronounced. He lost a lot of muscle mass and all of his body hair, his shoulders narrowed and his arms became slim and delicate. His waste became wasped, his feet shank considerably, his legs became more shapely and his hips widened. The final change happened in his crotch region as his junk quietly packed itself in. Despite the fact that the idea of this happening to would have terrified Henry Everson if had been explained to him, Harriet Everson remained unaware of the shift as she focused on the road. Nor was it any concern her wife or Debra, Rachael and Sam(antha).<br />
<br />
This stage of the transformation was finished off with a change of attire. Their clothes quickly reconfigured themselves into five broadly similar outfits. Each one of which involved a knee length short sleeved dress with with a belt around the waist and vents, a set of flat shoes and a pair of gloves. Each of the mothers had an white apron added to it. Harriet&#39;s Dress was black with white trimmings, Linda&#39;s had blue and white stripes, Debra&#39;s was pink with white polka dots and the twins both were green. All of them had circular earrings.<br />
<br />
The result of this change turned their family into something that looked out of a romanticized 1950s where LGBT acceptance was normal and if they had been asked about it, they would have said that this was basically had been the case. The three girls had two of the best Gosh Darn moms in the US of A. The only things which was off from this was the car the fact that Debra was engrossed in her Smartphone. But even this state of affairs was just an interim and that little detail was soon corrected.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, to Samantha&#39;s momentary surprise, her cell phone broke down in green bursts of electricity and then somehow be absorbed into her body. &quot;What the hell?!&quot; She said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you kiss us with that mouth?&quot; Linda said in mild reprimand as her ears were enveloped in two polished metal hemispheres which clicked shut. Features which were showing up on everyone in the car, which was beginning to change itself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well my smartphone was...&quot; Debra said as a pair of long antennae began to extend horizontally from her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and what, pray tell, is a &#39;Smart Phone&#39;?&quot; Hatti said as her gloves turned to plastic and fused with her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s a small handheld computer for communicating with people around the world with radio.&quot; Debra explained, getting more uncertain with each passing second. As she did so she put her knees together and her legs began to fuse.<br />
<br />
Linda leaned over to face her eldest daughter, her eyes now glowing green and pulsing with every word.&quot;Well Jumpin&#39; ENIAC Debby why would you need a &#39;Smart Phone&#39; to do something like that?&quot; As she spoke her face became more glossy and gradually became more and more grey &quot;Just use your apps like everyone else.&quot; She did not open her mouths on the last sentence and the words came out tinny.<br />
<br />
With that Debra realized how silly she&#39;d been. She through up her apps and over her field of vision and got back to using them. She smiled and chortled. It was like forgetting how to pick up a rock or open a door.  She focused on the windows while her face turned into a chrome mask. Her nostrils sealed up while her eyelids became shutters over over her now noticably larger eyes. Her lips became burnished flexible copper while mouth simplified down to a simple affair not to distinct from a ventriquist dummy. It was little more than a cover for her charging port and taking in lube and raw material, but leaving aside a few things like jolt kissing there was generally no reason to open it. Her hairdo solidified into a solid metal form in firetruck red which more closely resembled a B-52&#39;s nose.<br />
<br />
The rest of her body followed suit. Her skin solidified and segmented into metal forms with ball joints, pivots an in some cased rubber gap fillers. A triangular grill formed above her breast. Her wasp waist became a single pivot. Her dress became a secondary layer of plates with few rubber sections here and there to fill gaps and fitted to their bodies with mechanical precision. Their dress skirts were made of steel plates which they could flair open or close as needed. On the inside organs, bones and muscle gave way to circuits, wires, motors and batteries. This rough process had been going all with all five of them.<br />
<br />
While their arms had simply become robotic arms their legs underwent a more radical change. Soon they became one singular limb. At the ends of which their feet turned into holders for a single axle around which grew a single wheel. The pedals in the car had given way to a single one in which Hatti had locked in her wheel. She spun forward to accelerate, backwards to slow down and could do a hard break by pressing down.<br />
<br />
With that their change was done. As far as they knew they had always been a family of fembots. Zipping along the roadway in a car that was half flying saucer and half Ford Falcon hovering a meter above the ground. All of which had a rather pleasant style to it.<br />
<br />
The changes now complete, Rachel decided to give her sister a Wheelie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you two stop it?&quot; Debra yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls!&quot; Linda said &quot;That&#39;s not Ladylike behavior!&quot;</p>
