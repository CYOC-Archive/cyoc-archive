<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A knight? Awesome! A brave, strong, chivalrous hero was exactly what Jeff wanted to be in this fantasy world. But before he could feel any more pleased with himself or imagine the sorts of adventures that he was sure to go on, Jeff felt himself crushed under a tremendous weight, so heavy that he fell our of his position floating in the air and then continued falling, crashing through the thatched roof--although once he landed, he found himself not in the cottage that should have been below, but instead in a stone room, dark but lit by torches, that seemed like part of a castle.<br />
<br />
The weight was so heavy that Jeff could barely stand--in fact, he couldn&#39;t stand, and there was some invisible force keeping him upright since his own rather negligible strength couldn&#39;t manage it. Collecting himself, he found the source of the weight: he was wearing a suit of steel plate armor. The whole deal, breastplate, gauntlets, pauldrons, greaves, and a whole bunch of other pieces of equipment that he had no name for since unlike the other ones they didn&#39;t tend to show up as gear in his video games. The only thing that was missing was the helmet, which wouldn&#39;t have been much good anyway since his head barely made it out of the breastplate, he was so short compared to the armor. He couldn&#39;t see it, but beneath the suit his clothes had been replaced by linen undergarments. As heavy as it was, being made of metal, a lot of it was empty, because it was way too big on Jeff. It was huge, made for someone much taller, thicker, and broader. He felt like a kid wearing his dad&#39;s suit, if his dad had a suit of metal armor, and it was very uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Before he could think about the specifics of his discomfort, though, Jeff began to feel a pulsing sensation, starting in his core and radiating outward, and then suddenly felt a rush of testosterone. He began swelling out, growing thicker and taller to fill out the giant suit of armor. His pecs barreled out to fill his breastplate, and his abs pushed out to join them in a new eight-pack. His biceps ballooned and his shoulders broadened to fit his pauldrons. His legs grew big and beefy to fit his greaves and cuisses (the name for his thigh armor suddenly came to him), helping him to grow a great deal taller as his whole frame shifted and stretched to that of a much larger man. And yes, his dick grew too to fill out his rather large codpiece. But Jeff wasn&#39;t just growing in size. Everything in his body got harder, rougher, tougher, and more defined as he grew older, progressing from his mid-teens to his mid-twenties. He felt a tingle as hair grew across his body. He was unable to see that it was blond, but he could see a new blond lock falling across his face as his dull brown hair grew into a glorious golden mane that fell to his shoulders. An equally blond beard grew across a jaw that squared itself as his face became more mature, angular, and handsome. Finally, his eyes tingled as they turned bright blue.<br />
<br />
Jeff fit his armor perfectly now, a tall, burly, handsome young man who was unrecognizable when compared to the scrawny, unremarkable boy he had been. But although the physical changes were done, he still felt that rush of testosterone and adrenaline. It felt great, like he could take on the world, like he wasn&#39;t afraid of anything. That was it, he was brave. His new feelings were ingraining themselves into his new personality, and new memories were filling into his head. He was never afraid to face dragons, monsters, or even armies in battle as long as he knew his cause was just. And that feeling was also confidence, he knew he was great. He was born into one of the greatest noble families of the realm and wanted for nothing growing up. He remembered the great skill he showed even from the young age when he began his training that only increased as he continued to train through his youth (whenever he wasn&#39;t rolling in the hay, that is). The proudest day of his life was when he was knighted. He was as chivalrous as a knight should be, honest, honorable, loyal, and courteous. His cockiness was tempered by his chivalry, but only by a bit. Of course, chivalry also expected a relative chastity, and--he looked down as his crotch twinged--he sometimes had trouble resisting temptation. His confidence was shaken for a moment, but then he grinned as he remembered how great he was in every other way, as far as he was concerned. He had taken up the adventuring life of a knight-errant, traveling the land alone or with companions seeking adventure and opportunities to fight injustice and the enemies of the realm and its people. That was his duty, after all, to serve the realm and its people. Of course, the other reason for his lifestyle was that he loved the rush he got from adventuring or fighting, which was not unlike the rush he felt now. <br />
<br />
Either way, his adventures had brought him here, to this castle. Jeff began to have a final thought about what he had become, but before he could determine what exactly it was Sir Geoffrey settled into his new mindset and barely realized he had become anything at all. He could still remember being Jeff, in the back of his head, but it didn&#39;t feel particularly important, and being Sir Geoffrey felt natural and right. He easily wore the armor that had been so heavy to his past self, the weight so comfortable that he barely noticed it. Sir Geoffrey felt a final change, the weight of his sheathed sword materializing at his side, and then time seemed to unfreeze, and the heavy wooden door of the room he was in slowly opened...</p>
