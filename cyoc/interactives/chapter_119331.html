<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Pizza, C&H treated Vinnie to their stash of booze, in the old tree house behind Horst&#39;s house.  Vinnie had never had more than a glass of wine before, but was soon downing boilermakers as fast as Horst could pour them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon as I&#39;m legal, I&#39;m getting a job as a bartender.  Drunks are great tippers,&quot; Horst explained, &quot;Hey, be careful, Vin, you&#39;re getting more booze on your lap than in your mouth.&quot;<br />
<br />
At one point, Vinnie almost told them he was still wearing Ryan, but his speech was slurred, and he forgot what they were talking about.  <br />
<br />
&quot;We shoulda dipped Ryan in a bottle of whiskey, he&#39;d wake up with an hangover, and never recall what happened,&quot; joked Carter.<br />
<br />
At that point, Vinnie &quot;accidentally&quot; grabbed the bottle of whiskey and emptied most of it on his lap.<br />
<br />
He was right too. Horst and Carter walked woozy Vinie home, and left him fully clothed on his bed. About 2 am, Vinnie woke up, and took off his clothes except for his jockstrap, and socks.  After he got under the covers, he realized the jockstrap was still damp, and slipped it off.  He was glad tomorrow was a Saturday.  He yawned and fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Ryan yawned and stretched as he woke. He must&#39;ve gotten lucky last night, as he was spooning a nice warm naked body.  He crinkled his nose he reeked of whiskey.  He had quite a hangover.  He sniffed the neck of the body he was next too.  He got hard.  It wasn&#39;t Stacy, she always wore that horrid perfume.  Ryan licked the sleeper behind the ear, and enjoy feeling the warm body shiver against his.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, fuck, it&#39;s dude,&quot; Ryan whispered opening his eyes and looking at the guy next to him, and the room around him.  &quot;Again,&quot; he added with a sigh.  He really needed to quit getting drunk.  He always seemed to wake up in some strange guy&#39;s bed when he got drunk.   He shouldn&#39;t have drunk on an empty stomach.  He didn&#39;t recall eating anything after breakfast yesterday.  Stacy was probably pissed, he had messed up on getting the Valedictorian spot for her.  He was sure of that.  He recalled stealing Vinnie&#39;s jockstrap, and then it was blurry.  But he knew Vinnie passed the jockstrap check, he remembered the snap of the elastic.  Weird.  Oh, well, his hand had slid down the sleepers belly and hit morning wood.   It had only happened four times before, and Ryan knew that the guy would usually keep quiet, if he woke up getting head.  Last time the guy gave him $50 to boot, and asked him to keep it quiet.  But then that guy was a coach.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s head buzzed.  He had the weirdest dream.  He was either tiny or he was with a giant.   He had been draped across a giant stinky foot, and he had started to grow bigger. He felt the warm body next to him, and felt oddly content.  He felt like he belonged here.<br />
<br />
Without looking at the guy&#39;s face, Ryan ducked under the covers, and worked his way around to the crotch.  He felt way too excited by the familiar musky smell.  Maybe this wouldn&#39;t be a one-night stand after all.  He wasn&#39;t ready to come out, but-  He closed his lips around Vinnie&#39;s boner, and started  gently caressing the velvety rod with his tongue.  He felt so comfortable. He never felt comfortable having sex before.  It always seemed like he was performing, but this time was different, he was being.  It was like he was home.  It smelled like home.  Not like his home with Vern the drunk, but home home. He was happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh, oooh, oooh,&quot; panted Vinnie, as he woke up,&quot;Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!&quot;  He blew his load down Ryan Standish&#39;s throat.    Vinnie was sweating, and lay back and sighed.  Ryan was working to milk a second load out of Vinnie.  This was new for him too, but it felt so right.<br />
<br />
Vinnie looked down at the bodyshaped bulge under the blanket.   His head buzzed.  How much had he drunk?  He didn&#39;t remember much.  Being in the tree house with Horst and Carter - he didn&#39;t recall seeing Ryan, but was sure he was there. Oh, how his head throbbed.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh,&#39; he moaned.  He peeled back the blanket, and saw Ryan&#39;s eyes staring up from his crotch.  Ryan&#39;s nose was buried in Vinnie&#39;s pubes, and Vinnie&#39;s cock and balls were completely in Ryan&#39;mouth.  Ryan grinned awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Munning, Winnie,&quot; he mumbled with his mouth full.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, we got really drunk last night,&quot; Vinnie said.<br />
<br />
Ryan stopped his ministrations, and started to open his mouth. He looked like he was embarrassed, and-<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t stop,&quot; said Vinnie, &quot;You&#39;re doing a great job, Ryan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vinnie had nothing to compare it with, but he was enjoying it.  The blow job seemed to drown out the throbbing of the hangover.  Ryan smiled and redoubled his effort.  He managed to suck two more loads out of Vinnie, before he came up for air and started massaging Vinnie&#39;s back.</p>
