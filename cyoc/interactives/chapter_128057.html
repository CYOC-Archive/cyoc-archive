<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I really like basketball!&quot;  John &#39;remembered&#39; he was on the JV team in school, but was one of the shorter players.  He tried football, but it was so brutal - a lot of players got serious injuries.  And he really didn&#39;t like the swollen, bulky look they all seemed to have.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, yes.&quot;  Mercury seemed to think a moment.  &quot;The game with hoops and balls.  It is derived from an ancient Mayan game.  You will need height, agility, and stamina.&quot;  He turned to Allysia.  &quot;How long is this for?  Just the holiday, or permanent alteration?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Permanent!&quot; shouted Johnny, who flushed when he realized he had cut off the woman.  However, she just smiled.  He stammered out &quot;Uh, please.  I want this to be permanent, everything you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allysia nodded.  &quot;Very well.  I will make the necessary family adjustments while Mercury works.&quot;<br />
<br />
That puzzled Johnny - what kind of family adjustments?  But then he forgot about everything else as the room suddenly changed around him.  Allysia was gone, leaving him alone with Mercury in what looked like a college basketball court.  They were both wearing shorts and Mercury was holding a basketball, which he tossed to Johnny.  &quot;Let&#39;s see what is needed.  Start shooting.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hoping to impress Mercury, Johnny took careful aim... and had the ball bounce off the rim.  He scrambled for the ball and tried again, and missed.  Mercury chuckled.  &quot;You are trying too hard.  Relax.&quot;   As he said that, the tension in Johnny&#39;s gut eased.  Something in his head had changed - now he wasn&#39;t nervous at all.  This time, his shot went in after one bounce.  The next one also went in, though he had one bounce out after that.  <br />
<br />
Mercury came over and placed his hands over Johnny&#39;s eyes, then removed them.  &quot;Your depth perception and vision were a little off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blinking, Johnny&#39;s mouth fell open as the world around him was suddenly in crystal focus.  Though he had not been aware of it, his eyes had not been great, giving everything a slight blur.  Taking aim, he tried again, this time dropping the ball in the center without touch the rim.  &quot;Oh, wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercury then had him move back from the foul line.  The further away he was, the harder it was to hit, until he started missing again for lack of strength.  Mercury moved behind him and massaged his arm muscles.  It felt good, and when Johnny tried again afterwards, he had no trouble lobbing the ball to the end of the court.  Flexing his muscles, he saw that he now had the smooth tone that Mercury.  They started moving, a little at first, then faster and further as Johnny&#39;s ability improved.  Mercury started blocking, making Johnny twist and jump to get shots.  The young man&#39;s hands slid over his back, his chest, his thighs, his buttocks as they moved together - it was like a dance, and after each caress, Johnny felt more powerful, more confident.  <br />
<br />
When Mercury finally stopped, Johnny was drenched with sweat.  They must have been playing for hours, but while Johnny could feel the burn in his muscles, he was also ready for more.  He blinked, realizing for the first time that he was looking down on the young man who had been teaching him.  His eyes widened as Mercury grinned and gestured towards the nearest wall.  What looked like painted concrete blocks shimmered and became a huge mirror.  Johnny&#39;s mouth fell open as he took in the reflection.<br />
<br />
Mercury looked the same, not even a drop a sweat on his brow.  However, the sweat-soaked young man towering over him was a total stranger.  At least 6&#39;8, maybe taller, with a lean build that still boasted an impressive ripple of muscles and large hands and feet, the youth in the mirror was maybe 18 or 19, with curly, dark blonde hair and bright blue eyes.  The face was very familiar - it was a slightly younger version of Mercury&#39;s!  Johnny was still staring at his reflection when the basketball court vanished, along with their shorts.  The mirror remained, and with the shorts gone Johnny could see that he was now very well equipped for &#39;other&#39; sports.  His male parts were now the biggest he had ever seen on a human, dark and uncut, at least 10 inches long soft over testicles the size of ping-pong balls.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man!&quot;  Johnny was startled by his voice, a much deeper sound than he&#39;d had before.  &quot;You changed everything!  Nobody will recognize me!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course they will!&quot;  Mercury grinned.  &quot;Everyone knows Johnny Sanders, the basketball phenomenon.  Star center for Notre Dame University at 19?  Favored to be on the U.S. Olympic Team and top draft choice for every franchise in the NBA?&quot;<br />
<br />
Johnny blinked in confusion.  &quot;But...&quot;  He shook his head.  &quot;What was I saying?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercury patted him on the shoulder.  &quot;Just hoping you enjoy the rest of your family&#39;s vacation here at the resort before you head back to Notre Dame.  Big season ahead!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right.&quot;  Johnny grinned and extended a hand.  &quot;Thanks for the workout!  I was afraid I might get rusty if I stayed away from the court the whole two weeks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mercury chuckled.  &quot;No problem - it isn&#39;t ever day I get to play basketball with a famous sports star!&quot;<br />
<br />
That made Johnny beam.  He liked the attention, and it would only get better as he continued playing.  But now he needed to go shower and meet up with his dad and brother.  They were supposed to be enjoying this vacation as a family.  He headed out for his room, still naked and enjoying showing off in this clothing-optional resort.<br />
<br />
Allysia came over and grinned as the teen left.  &quot;New sports-crazy dad and brother are waiting for him outside.  His old family has the bookworm daughter swapped out.  Everyone is happy.&quot;</p>
