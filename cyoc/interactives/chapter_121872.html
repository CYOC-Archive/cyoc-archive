<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next morning, Raul woke up a little bit earlier than usual. The sun was just rising and everything around him was deadly quiet.<br />
For some reason, last night wasn&#39;t as comfortable as other nights. He wasn&#39;t sure how or why but he had a feeling of being watched by someone. What happened yesterday was too weird and sudden that it might involve more than what he knew. He thought a lot about telling his mother but at the time he thought it was such a crazy story that she won&#39;t believe him.<br />
He stood up and walked through the corridor to the bathroom. When he crossed next to his mother bedroom he stopped for a second; how to tell her that he and some other kids on the neighborhood had turned into young men for a few hours yesterday?<br />
He had no idea, but he knew that he needed to talk to some of those kids today. He was sure that Joel wasn&#39;t a very good option and Benny, Johnny and Noah were too young to get something really useful from them.<br />
So, his last choice was Toby, the boy that he met yesterday a couple of minutes before everything happened.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it! He must know something about what happened with us.&quot; Raul thought as he brushed his teeth, but then he realiced that to found him couldn&#39;t be easy.<br />
After leaving the bathroom, Raul went to the living room and stood in the spot where he and Toby were when they began to grow. Under his feet were the old rug that his grandma has given to his mother before she passed away. It wasn&#39;t any special, just a regular reddish brown rug with some stains over here and there.<br />
&quot;Wait a second!&quot; Raul mouthed and he knelt to touch those spots around him. They were solid like glue or... &quot;No!&quot; He gasped ashamed because he had remembered what those spots were. &quot;They are a lot!&quot;<br />
He remembered how aroused he was at that moment. He had been aroused before, specially when he saw some porno pictures on the web; but those moments weren&#39;t any closer to what happened over that old rug.<br />
He remembered how big he was turning, hair sprouting from all over his body and both things happening on his privates at the same time when a week ago he had just began to make stiff his hairless and tiny penis.<br />
Thinking of those things were making him hard which was completely embarrassing for him. He wasn&#39;t that kind of boy who wish to be as big as his dad or his older brothers like Joel. Particularly because he hasn&#39;t any of them. All he had was himself and his mother.<br />
Talking about her, it looks like she wouldn&#39;t awake too soon, so Raul decided to ignore his problem for a while and focus on something else, like making the breakfast, for example.<br />
<br />
As the sun rises and his shining rays entered through the windows, Lucile slowly began to awake, snoring wasn&#39;t usual in her but she had spent last night making some ideas in her mind that she had ended sleeping just a few hours. Writing wasn&#39;t something she enjoyed to do but Priapus Tool had just unlocked a notes function last night that she thougth it was a good opportunity to use it.<br />
Before she left her bed, she skimmed her notes on her phone. She had marked an important thing that she must do today in order to improve her last night experience. She smiled and prepared herself for the big day that was awaiting for her.<br />
At soon as she opened the door that lead her to the corridor, she heard the well known sound of a frying pan being used. That only could mean that Raul had awoken early this morning and was making the breakfast.<br />
He had learnt to cook years ago in a time when she was really sick and he had decided to make her the meals. Since then, he wasn&#39;t afraid of trying new recipes or creating his owns. She must admit that he was very talented for his age and it was another reason to be a proud of him.<br />
When the sentence &#39;Proud of him&#39; crossed her mind she remembered why she was proud of him yesterday. She knew that as time passed she couldn&#39;t be as close to her son like now and she would have less significance on his life&#39;s choices. What to do as he grew, which clothes to wear or how to be a good lover. That last one make her thought about the kind of woman who will share her life and body with him. That mysterious woman must be just a girl today without even boobs. Of course, he also was as underdeveloped as a lot of other kids at his age.<br />
Thinking about those boys and girls who today just had lived around a decade and are cared by their parents turning into a new generation of lusty men and women who enjoyed the secret life that adulthood can offer, make her turn on.<br />
She was getting aroused and she needed to find some way to release it. So, without thinking too much about it, she carefully sneaked through the house until she could see her son. He was using the frying pan like she had assumed and was wearing the same pijamas of last night.<br />
&quot;Those pijamas again!&quot; She muttered as she looked through the options on her phone. &quot;It will last just a second, so I can get over this urge&quot;.<br />
She pointed to her son and zapped like she had made last night. A blinding light covered her for a moment and when she finally recovered the sight the first thing she saw were a well toned and hairy pair of legs lenghtening from her son&#39;s blue pijamas.<br />
<br />
Like every ocassion he has the opportuny to cook, Raul was completely focused on making something unique and special. A few years ago he had discovered a growing love for cooking and he had dreamed of becoming a professional chef like the ones on the tv and internet. When he was cooking everything around him went to a second plane, even his thoughts and worries that didn&#39;t relate with his cook. Today he was trying to create something with eggs and tomatoes and was having a hard time thinking of a new way to cook them. For some minutes the eggs and tomatoes were just in his hand and he was just feeling their big and spherical sizes inside his palm.<br />
&quot;They are really big.&quot; He said. &quot;I won&#39;t waste it in a common omelette&quot;.<br />
After thinking a little bit more about it, he began to cook something on the frying pan and time began to fly away. He was too focused on cooking that he didn&#39;t noted that his mother was watching at him from the distance. She was pointing her phone at him and then...<br />
Suddenly everything felt different, smaller and farther than a second ago. He hadn&#39;t realiced what had happened until he saw a dense bush of hair near to the frying pan. But, it wasn&#39;t just a bush of hair, it was his pubic hair that was protruding from his pijamas.<br />
&quot;What the hell?!!&quot; He yelled in a deeper voice as he stared at the mass of pubes that had grown from where there was nothing before. &quot;What&#39;s just happening to me?!&quot; He sounded more upset than scared and then began to inspect his grown body. Lucile just had a big smile on her face.</p>
