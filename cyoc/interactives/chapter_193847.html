<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Laney had known for a while her marriage wasn&#39;t perfect. Maybe it never had been. She had met Sam in high school, he was the alpha jock of the school and she was the head of the cheer squad. They had been made for each other she thought, he was always tall, handsome, athletic, and she was well.. pretty. Smarter than she let on, but that just made it easier for her to get her way as a teenager. They went to college together, married out of college, had two boys almost immediately, and then things just seemed to go sour.<br />
<br />
Where they had been extremely sexually active as teens and in their early twenties, that faded over time as those youthful urges did. There had always been an awkwardness in bed with Sam, she suspected because he might have thought himself inadequate, he had never been gifted in that department, but his handsomeness and fit body more than made up for it to her. But as time went on it took on another feel. Like they just weren&#39;t compatible. He spent more time at the gym, or out late claiming work, but she knew the truth, being away from home a day or two at a time. He was probably cheating on her.<br />
<br />
The truth came to her when she logged onto his computer looking for a bank document. Then she found the folder of porn, lots of it. But not what she had expected at all. It was all men, some alone some in pairs. Muscular, hairy men, many of them middle aged. Not a single photo of a nude woman anywhere in any of the folders. Then it all made sense. In the earlier years he had been so eager, so adamant, maybe to prove to himself he wasn&#39;t gay, then as the years went by slowly giving in.  More sleuthing uncovered the gay hookup app hidden on his phone. A tracker app put on it showed her his occasional trips to gay bars or seedier motels. No doubt it was only a matter of time until their marriage fell apart, but she was going to come out on top, she needed more evidence. So she hatched a plan.<br />
<br />
It was easy enough to hide the few cameras in their bedroom. She faked a business trip and sent their sons, now 9 and 11, off to her parents&#39; house for the week. He&#39;d have the house all to himself for five days, she was sure he wouldn&#39;t be able to resist.<br />
<br />
Laney sat in her hotel room downtown, sipping from a glass of wine as she watched the camera feed into her bedroom. Sam had just gotten home from the gym and showered, and now he sat naked on the end of their bed, tapping away on his phone. She had a feeling tonight was the night. Despite her anger at him, she still felt a jolt of longing when she saw him. Despite now being in his mid-thirties, he hadn&#39;t let himself go at all. He may not have the taught abs he once had, but he was still more muscle than anything, a broad smooth chest, wide shoulders, powerful arms. A strong clean-shaven jaw with a cleft chin, and thick wavy brown hair on his head. Other than the light dusting on his arms and legs, his body hair was only a well trimmed bush of brown hairs around his slightly below average manhood, his only inadequacy.<br />
<br />
He was smiling as he tapped away on his phone. He certainly wasn&#39;t texting her. He tapped out one more message and set the phone aside. He disappeared from the bedroom and Laney cursed her lack of thought in putting cameras elsewhere in the house. But he came back in a few minutes with a glass of something to drink and sat down on the bed again, this time near his nightstand. Sam opened the drawer and pulled out a bottle of pills. He opened the bottle and tapped out a couple into his hand. She had never seen those before, se squinted at the image, trying to make out the bottle as he downed the pills. He bent over and put his hands on his knees, like he was waiting for something.<br />
<br />
One of the cameras had a good frontal view of him, and she had to blink a few times and tap on her screen. Something was happening to Sam. Brown hairs were growing in on his chest, quickly spreading out along his pectorals and down his stomach. The hair on his arms and legs also began to thicken. A beard grew in on his clean-shaven jaw, short but thick. His body seemed to be swelling, too. His already powerful chest seemed to expand, his arms and legs thickening as well though losing some of their definition. He leaned back a little as his stomach expanded, still not as prominent as his pectorals, but a definite gut. He reached down to adjust his manhood which was also growing, his balls swelling to the size of lemons, his cock becoming thick and long, more than double its old size. Grey streaked his still thick hair at the temples and on his chin as his face seemed to age a bit. He was still extremely handsome, but the grey seemed to add a certain distinguished look to him. He looked to be in his forties, or maybe even a youthful fifty.<br />
<br />
Laney sat wide-eyed, staring at the man that had been her husband. He still looked like himself, in the face at least. But a decade of age and maybe thirty extra pounds of muscle and padding, not to mention the body fur changed his whole look. He got up and stretched, a smile wide on his face as he felt at his pectorals and ran a hand over his furry stomach. He grabbed a robe and pulled it on then left the bedroom.<br />
<br />
Her original plan had been to drive over and confront him, but she didn&#39;t know what to do at this point. She stared at the empty bedroom for what felt like hours but might only have been twenty minutes. Sam reappeared this time followed by a man more like his old self. Thirties, extremely muscular, with a blond crew cut and beard. The younger man began to undress, exposing a well-muscled body with a visible coating of blond hair across his torso and down his legs. Sam shucked his robe and the two men began to make out. She stared in fascination as the younger man began to blow her husband, then in stunned silence as he flipped the younger muscle bear over, lubed up and began to thrust into his blond furred rear.<br />
<br />
She felt jealousy rising in her, and pain. That was her husband, being more passionate with some online hookup than he had been with her in years. The two men came and fell into the bed in a tangle of limbs. She went to bed herself not long after but couldn&#39;t sleep. Instead she plotted in her mind. <br />
<br />
She was up before Sam, and saw him get out of bed. He was still the older man he had turned into, but he went about his normal morning routine. He grabbed not his normal bag of gym clothes, but another from deeper in his closet and left. Laney made up her mind and drove home. She got home before him, hiding her car up the street, waiting until he was returning from the gym. She knew he would take a long shower right as he got upstairs and waited a few minutes then went into the house. She could hear the shower running upstairs and went into their bedroom.<br />
<br />
She had just intended to confront him, but she sat down on his side of the bed and slipped open the drawer. She dug inside and pulled out the bottle. &quot;DILF pills?&quot; She read the label of the bottle, and wouldn&#39;t have believed it had she not seen it in action the night before. What would happen if she...</p>
