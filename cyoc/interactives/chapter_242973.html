<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We high-tailed it out of that forest, as soon as we were sure the coast was clear. As E.B. and I beat our hasty retreat back to my house, the shadows of the trees in the moonlight seemed so much darker than before. The forest, which had been so full of life and noise, was a lot quieter now. Those howling wolves must have frightened all the other prey into silence. I couldn&#39;t believe I had just thought of them as &quot;other prey&quot;, but I knew it was the truth. We were all in the same boat, terrified that those rampaging beasts could cross our paths again at any moment.<br />
<br />
It pained me, all of a sudden, to think that some other innocent rabbit was probably getting chased down and devoured right now, even as I was thankful it wasn&#39;t us. Neither of us said a word until we crawled back into that basement window, which I closed tightly behind us. What would have been a casual hike in a little park for a human had been a long journey for two were-rabbits. Longer than I would have guessed - I could see the first glimmers of dawn outside as I looked back through the glass. I shook the dew-drops out of my fur and turned back to E.B.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a really clever plan,&quot; he told me again as he clambered up the stairs, obviously curious to explore more of my home while he was here. &quot;And I&#39;m not just saying that because I&#39;m getting put up in a luxurious human house for the next few days. Nice thinking, buddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you keep saying that?&quot;, I asked as I followed him, needing to stay on all fours to get myself up the suddenly giant steps. &quot;I mean, not that I can&#39;t take a compliment or anything. But is it really that important?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s as important as it gets,&quot; E.B. said, rearing up onto his hind legs as he reached the top of the stairs. His whiskers twitched as he stared at my furniture, as spartan and basic as it all was by human standards. I hadn&#39;t fully gotten used to everything being so much bigger, so I was only a little bit less awestruck than he was. He shook his head and continued. &quot;We&#39;re rabbits. We might be a lot bigger and a lot stronger than ordinary rabbits, yes. But that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re going to win any fights on strength alone. And those guys are a lot bigger and stronger than ordinary wolves, in case you didn&#39;t notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
He hopped forward, intrigued by the open door of my bedroom. I followed him as he approached the foot of the bed, then climbed up onto the duvet cover. &quot;Our cleverness is our first defense, to keep us out of trouble altogether, and our last resort, to get out of danger when we&#39;ve been cornered.&quot; His paws sank into the soft fabric, and he smiled as he realized how comfortable it was. &quot;If we couldn&#39;t outsmart the predators, we&#39;d never have a chance at survival. So I&#39;m really glad that a human like you can be just as clever as a rabbit can. I was worried your cute little face might be all you had to offer.&quot; A tiny bit of laughter tittered out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
I had barely even caught my breath from everything that had happened out there, and now I felt it sticking in my throat again. I had brought the partner of my dreams, literally, back to my bed and had them calling me cute. If this was a human woman, it would&#39;ve been all I&#39;d ever really wanted. Now, somehow, I was even more attracted than I&#39;d ever been to any of those women. And yet I couldn&#39;t imagine making an advance. I was sure I had to be misreading the situation. Maybe he just didn&#39;t know that the word &quot;cute&quot; means a lot of different things in our human culture. I mean, clearly he didn&#39;t quite understand what a bed was for, even in its most innocent purpose.<br />
<br />
We both slowly sat down on top of the covers, right next to each other. Too close for comfort. I panicked, thinking that I must&#39;ve leaned in to get closer to him without really realizing it. I tried to subtly back away, give him some more personal space without letting on what I was doing. But to my surprise, he wasn&#39;t getting any further away - he kept pushing a little bit closer, just as slowly and as subtly as I was pulling back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot;, he said suddenly, and he stopped inching toward me. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to-&quot; He looked down, clearly embarrassed. &quot;It&#39;s just that... well... it&#39;s been a long time since I had, you know, a companion. I live in a burrow with regular rabbits most of the time, but I don&#39;t exactly fit in when I can do, uh, this...&quot; He gestured up and down the length of his body. Only now, as I followed the movement of his paws across his chest, did I allow myself to glance at his sheath for long enough to notice... It was twitching nervously? Just like mine?<br />
<br />
&quot;And so when I, um, smelled it on you, I thought you must be interested... But I should&#39;ve known... you&#39;re probably just confused, and scared, and waiting for me to figure out how to make you human again... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He sighed, still not willing to meet my eyes with his. &quot;You never wanted this. I forced myself into your human life, and now both of us are in danger...&quot;<br />
<br />
I felt my mouth hanging wide open as I tried to process his words. Smelled it on me? I started to pay attention to what my own nose was telling me - and E.B. looked up just in time to watch it twitching curiously. It was, of course, so much more sensitive now than my human senses had ever been. In the corner of this very room was the stain I had left this morning - while I was thinking about him. And now that I paid close attention to it... it really stunk. No wonder he was getting mixed signals from me.<br />
<br />
But stronger than that, I could smell <i>it</i> on him. Yesterday, I would have had no idea what that scent was, if I even could&#39;ve picked it up at all. And up until a few moments ago, I was too distracted by other thoughts to notice it. But now... Now it was like opening my eyes for the first time to see the writing on the wall. It was all right in front of me. He wanted me as much as I wanted him - if not more.<br />
<br />
Hesitantly, I reached out a paw-hand to him. Watching my face intently now, he took it in his own fuzzy hand with just as much hesitation. &quot;Listen,&quot; I said softly. &quot;I never wanted this, but now that it&#39;s happening, I... I mean... I still want to be fully human again, if that&#39;s possible. But if it isn&#39;t... look, I heard what that one wolf was saying. If he can live a normal human life when the moon isn&#39;t full, whoever he is...&quot; - nice lying there, me - &quot;... then I&#39;m sure I can, too. And as long as we&#39;re here, together, and we&#39;re both in the same form... then yes, I am... interested.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now both of us were leaning into each other. My face - my head - my whole body felt like it was on fire. Every strand of fur was quivering with excitement, particularly the ones on my legs that were starting to rub up against his. He put his muzzle up to mine. The moment our lips made contact, my eyes screwed shut involuntarily. I could see stars buzzing in my vision as I pushed forward into the best kiss of my life. It was a miracle that I didn&#39;t cum right then and there.<br />
<br />
When I had recovered from that trembling, paw-curling sensation enough to open my eyes again, I found him leaning backward on the bed, presenting himself to me. His ears flopped forward as his head hit the pillow behind him and gradually sank into it. He wanted me to take the lead? Not what I had imagined, admittedly, but not any less appealing. What a perfect gentleman. Or - wait... What <i>was</i> he?<br />
<br />
As my eyes fell on his sheath, which was rapidly expanding into a slick red penis - as if it was trying to reach out and touch me all by itself - I suddenly noticed the hole that sat right underneath it. Not his anus - I knew that had to be further back. It looked more like what I would normally expect my human hookups to have down there.<br />
<br />
Not wanting him to think that I was suddenly turned off - for some reason I wasn&#39;t - I scooted forward on my knees and leaned in toward him. But I had to ask. &quot;I thought you were a- a male,&quot; I said cautiously. &quot;What is... that?&quot; I pointed, resisting the temptation to start fingering him right then and there.<br />
<br />
He knew what I meant immediately. &quot;I&#39;m, uh, both,&quot; he said - and yet it didn&#39;t cross my mind to start thinking of him as &quot;she&quot; or anything. &quot;It always confuses the other rabbits. Even when the full moon is gone and I look just like them, in every other way, they never want to mate with me. I always thought it must be a human thing that stuck with me all month long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s... rare for humans,&quot; I said. &quot;Probably not much more common than it is for rabbits.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then,&quot; he said slyly, &quot;how lucky must I be to find the one human who has the same thing going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
I blinked, then hesitantly looked down. I couldn&#39;t see too well underneath my own erection, but if I leaned forward a little bit... There it was. I had a vagina. When did that happen? I was sure I would&#39;ve noticed it if it was there this morning - or yesterday morning, it was getting hard to keep track - so it must have been the very last part of me to change.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t worry too much about it, since my manhood was still intact right next door. To think that I&#39;d been confused over whether all this meant that I was gay. As I thought about it now, in the heat of the moment, gender just didn&#39;t matter all that much to me anymore. We were two compatible creatures who wanted each other badly. What else was there to say?<br />
<br />
&quot;This is actually new for me,&quot; I told him as I relaxed from the surprise discovery and leaned back toward him again to take in more of his scent. &quot;It must be part of the whole were-rabbit thing. For both of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;, he replied. &quot;Well, that makes sense. We need them to lay our eggs, after all. You wouldn&#39;t be much of an Easter Bunny with just a cock.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was a lot harder to take in than the idea of being partly female. &quot;Eggs?!&quot;, I shouted, a little louder than I meant to, in my newly high-pitched and androgynous voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, eggs,&quot; he said, as if it was obvious. He even seemed sort of hurt by the question. &quot;What do you think we do at Easter time? I thought you humans loved those things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They do - I-I mean, <i>we</i> do,&quot; I said defensively. &quot;I just didn&#39;t realize they actually came... out of you. Honestly, until I met you, I thought it was my parents who were hiding them in the yard for me to find.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha!&quot;, he said. &quot;Good one! I bet you thought it was your parents leaving you a quarter when you lost a tooth, too, huh?&quot; That gave him a good laugh. &quot;But seriously, the eggs are what it&#39;s all about. It&#39;s the gift that we&#39;re given, as were-bunnies, and it&#39;s our sacred responsibility to share it with the world. I&#39;ll show you what you need to do, when the time comes. But don&#39;t, uh, knock it until you&#39;ve tried it - I think that&#39;s how the human saying goes.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down at his opening again. It was small and tight, looking almost virginal. It was hard to imagine a full-sized Easter egg pushing out of that birth canal, especially when I remembered that everything looked a lot bigger to me now. It was even harder to believe that he&#39;d been laying them for, what, hundreds of years? But, putting all that aside, I knew very well what to do with a hole like this one. &quot;Do you mind if I... <i>try it</i> right now?&quot;, I said, my hand still hovering just inches away from its delicate lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to start laying- Oh.&quot; When he realized what I meant, I could see his cock throbbing at the very thought of it. &quot;You want to... Yes. Do it,&quot; he said eagerly. &quot;Fuck me, human.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t hesitate. My own member was just as excited as his. I guided the slender, tapering shaft inside with one paw-hand, grasping at his shoulder with the other. As I laid my whole body down on top of his, beginning to pump inside, I could feel his cock rubbing against my chest, caught between our two bellies and absolutely loving it. I wanted to somehow please every part of him at once, but I couldn&#39;t reach his face to continue our kiss from earlier. I settled for nuzzling my nose against his collarbone while I thrusted, just trying to take in a little more of his scent.<br />
<br />
Just when I thought we were both on the verge of climax, E.B. pushed my head up and motioned for me to turn away from him. I was confused - I thought for sure he would be enjoying our embrace as much as I was. But I was quick enough on the uptake to figure out what he had in mind without a word exchanged. Without taking myself out of him, I spun myself around - with a flexibility in my joints that I definitely never had before - and presented my new opening to his begging, pleading, engorged cock.<br />
<br />
And when he started to push it in - that was a sensation I never before would have imagined I&#39;d experience. The moment I felt the tip pressing its way inward, though, I could start to understand what was coming my way. I was a little afraid I&#39;d pass out from the pleasure of having that rabbit cock inside me - every inch better and thicker than the last. This was so much better than just being on the giving end. And I was really glad that I now knew what it was like for him - what I was currently doing to him at the very same moment that he was doing it to me.<br />
<br />
Every thrust that either of us made was pulling double duty, rubbing my aching cock against his walls and his against mine, giving me two jolts of pleasure at once - and I knew that it was the same for him. I couldn&#39;t go half a second without being struck by another wave that made me gasp for air. I couldn&#39;t sweat anymore, after all. Panting was the only way that wonderful, overpowering heat could escape my body. I was grateful that most of it was trapped inside my fluffy fur, even as I struggled to take each shuddering breath of cool air.<br />
<br />
The only way this could get any better, I thought to myself, was if we both reached orgasm at exactly the same time. And then, as if by magic, that&#39;s exactly what happened. I started spurting out my load into him, and I felt the same sticky wetness inside of me. I laid back and caught my breath, each of us pulling out of the other and leaving two messy pools of cum that immediately mixed together on top of the bedsheets. I couldn&#39;t believe what had just happened, and I was especially baffled by how good, and how <i>right</i> it all felt. There was no creeping sense of shame that I shouldn&#39;t have done that - my earlier fears had gone right out the window. That was easily the best sex I&#39;d ever had, hands (or paws) down.<br />
<br />
And now that I was free to move again, no longer caught in that looping position, I was amazed that I still had some stamina, and some of that burning heat, left in me. I would have thought I&#39;d left it all on the field. Now I could do what I had really wanted to do in the first place. I got up and launched myself forward until I was muzzle to muzzle with him again. I pressed my lips against his, greedily, and he was more than happy to return the favor. Soon we were making out just as furiously as we&#39;d been fucking a minute earlier, holding each other as tightly as we could, wanting nothing more than to push into each other until we were totally inseparable.<br />
<br />
We must have fallen asleep like that, cuddling together on top of those incredibly comfy pillows that now seemed gigantic to me. Because that&#39;s the last thing I can remember before... well... let me explain what happened next.</p>
