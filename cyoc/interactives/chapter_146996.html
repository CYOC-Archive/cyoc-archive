<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty spotted a large, overweight man waddling around the mall as he was walking down the wide corridor past all the shops. Right away, Ty could see that the man had a small cock, so he focused his power on the man’s groin, causing the small manhood to swell a bit. <br />
<br />
The large man stopped and wandered over to the steel bench, where he sat down, obviously tired from his walk. When Ty approached him, he recognized the large man as Phillip, the janitor from his high school. So, Ty decided to sit down next to the man. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Phillip! Nice day to hang out at the mall, huh?” Ty asked him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, Tyler… Much better than mopping floors and dusting desks and lockers at the school… I got such a dead-end job…” Phillip sighed. <br />
<br />
“Aw, come on, Phillip. I can’t be so bad!” Ty said, trying to cheer up the large man. <br />
<br />
“Don’t ever make the same mistake I did, Ty! Stay in school! I was stupid and I dropped out. I did drugs and alcohol and I got lazy and look at me now… I’m nothing but one big, fat loser… If I were a kid right now, I would stay in school, I would go to the gym and I would have made something out of my pathetic life!” Phillip uttered sadly. “Much better than mopping floors as the school janitor! Plus, my health is so bad right now… I may die of a heart attack any day now…” <br />
<br />
“Oh, no! I don’t want that! I want you to stick around for a long, long time, Phil!” Ty shouted. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, well… Thanks for your confidence, kid…. I’ll see you in school, mopping the floor after class…” Phillip sighed as he got up and started to walk off. <br />
<br />
“No, no, no, no…. I can’t let this end this way….” Ty grumbled quietly. “I wish Phil would turn around and stand before me!”<br />
<br />
Phil walked off and stopped dead in his tracks before he turned around and walked back to where Ty was sitting. He couldn’t figure out why he wanted to walk back to where Ty was sitting. <br />
<br />
“I wish Phil would regress back to a healthy, young, buff fifteen-year-old kid again who is strong and muscular and who is only interested in studying, staying healthy and working out in the gym, and everybody would find it normal!” Ty uttered. <br />
<br />
Ty was about to witness the strangest transformation ever. First, the large man with the big belly started to deflate! His huge belly began to deflate at an alarming rate. The mammoth stomach shrunk down until Phillip was skinny again! In fact, his large t-shirt draped over his torso like a wide poncho!<br />
<br />
Next, his flabby arms and legs shrunk down tremendously. All the fat disappeared from his limbs as they deflated within seconds. It was as if the fat just melted off his body. A large puddle of water started to form behind the poor man, as he was sweating bullets! <br />
<br />
“Uhhhhh!!!!” Phillip moaned loudly as all the remaining fat melted away from his neck, his chest, his face, his shoulders, and the rest of his body, leaving the middle-aged man tall and skinny as a rail. You could only see his thin limbs and his skinny, lean torso by now. <br />
<br />
Next, Phillip started to regress. He was over 6-foot-4 inches tall, but he lost about 2 inches and shrunk down a little bit. His face became much younger and all his wrinkles disappeared. His skin became very smooth and he lost all the hair on his face. <br />
<br />
Finally, Phillip started to gain muscle! As he finished regressing back to a 15-year-old teenager, his pectorals bulged out and his arms swelled up with large biceps and triceps from working out many hours in the gym. His quads and calves grew as well, and he formed a nice six-pack over his stomach. He morphed into a nice, young, strapping, teenage muscle boy! Thankfully, Ty transformed Phil’s old, baggy clothes so that they now fit Phil’s more athletic body as well. He was no longer wearing old, baggy jeans and t-shirts but tight, Lycra shorts and a tank top with workout shoes. <br />
<br />
“HEY! What--? Oh…. I’m a kid! What--?” he stuttered as he looked on and noticed Ty sitting there. His voice was a bit higher than before as Phillip was now a 15-year-old muscle boy! “OHMYGOSH! I’m a kid again!!!”<br />
<br />
Phillip ran over to the mirror which was hanging from the wall next to the entrance to one of the clothing stores and let out a loud gasp. He felt his muscular chest, his thick arms and his big, thick, muscular legs. <br />
<br />
“I’m not overweight anymore!?? I’m a teenager again! And… I got big muscles! What…. How…?” he stuttered even more as Ty walked up to him. <br />
<br />
“You look much better than the old Phillip!” Ty chuckled. <br />
<br />
Phil turned around and he had to look down because he was taller than Ty. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Tyler!” <br />
<br />
“I hope you like your new body! You’re a student again. I did this to you, so you got a second chance. You don’t need to be a janitor anymore! You’re a student athlete now! So, study hard and go to the gym!” <br />
<br />
“Thank you, Ty! I don’t know how you changed me, but… I’m not gonna blow this opportunity to do things right the second time around! I’m going to the gym afterwards!” Phil grinned as he flexed his arm, causing a huge bicep to swell up. <br />
<br />
“Go for it, big guy!” Ty grinned. “You gotta keep on growing those big muscles, dude!” <br />
<br />
“See ya in school, Tyler!” Phil said, as he walked off and returned to the gym. <br />
<br />
Phil joined the school’s bodybuilding club and became one of the best powerlifters at the school! The high school also ended up hiring someone else as the new janitor. Somehow, nobody remembered what had happened to the old janitor and a new guy was hired the next day. <br />
<br />
Ty decided to check up on Phil now and then and he was happy to see him working out very hard in the gym every day from that day forward. </p>
