<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aaron was in his bedroom laying on his bed.  His thoughts were back on the evening&#39;s previous events.  He couldn&#39;t say what was going through his mind.  The moment he saw Rachel stepping out of the shower, there was some sort of attraction that pulled him to her.  There were these visions going on inside his head as he approached her.  He couldn&#39;t help but lift Rachel up as she wrapped her legs around him.  And once she impaled herself on him, he couldn&#39;t help but thrust until they were knotted.  Had Megumi not stopped by, he was certain that Aaron would have turned Rachel and made her pregnant in the process.  It was at that moment that a knock on the door interrupted his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron-san,&quot; Megumi said as she opened his door.  Aaron winced when she said that as it usually meant trouble.  &quot;Grandmother wishes to speak with you in the den.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron sighed as he picked himself up off of the bed and followed Megumi out of the door.  The two of them walked their way through the Tachibana Estate towards the center of the compound known as &quot;the den&quot;.  Megumi opened the door to see Akane, Tori, and a few other werefoxes sitting formally on mats.  Everyone, including Megumi and Aaron, was in their werefox fursonas.  Megumi sat to the side of Akane while Aaron sat in the middle of the room.  Aaron could feel everyone&#39;s eyes on him.  He bowed to the floor as he said, &quot;Honorable grandmother, I have arrived as summoned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane looked at her grandson, her eyes narrowing as she studied him.  &quot;I understand that you were having...relations with that Rachel Van Direstag girl.  You will tell me what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron&#39;s mouth grew dry as he considered his answer.  &quot;Honorable grandmother, I had started to do the task that you assigned me.  Specifically, informing Megumi and Rachel of the arrival of Richard van Direstag, father of Rachel.  I had caught Rachel in the bathroom as she was stepping out of the shower.  When our eyes met...&quot; he paused as he tried to remember exactly what happened.  &quot;When our eyes met...it&#39;s hard to describe what happened.  She lowered her guard to me and I saw her body.  My mind went blank and these images of...something flashed in my mind.  It looked like...our future lives together.  I saw an image of her and I marrying...having kids...starting a home together...growing old on a balcony.  With each image, I moved closer to her, and she moved closer to me.  When we got close together, our hands kept touching the other&#39;s body.  We embraced and pressed ourselves together.  She lifted her leg around my waist while I picked her up.  She wrapped the other leg around my waist and then lowered herself on me.  I ended up thrusting a few times before we were fully together.&quot;  As Aaron gave his account, he could hear voices murmur in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is when Megumi found you two?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Grandmother,&quot; Aaron responded.  &quot;It was that at that time Rachel and I snapped at whatever was controlling us.  Rachel tried separating from me, but we were knotted together.&quot;  Aaron could hear more loud murmuring when he said that.  &quot;However, with Megumi&#39;s help, I was able to get out of Rachel before I orgasmed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Akane&#39;s eyes narrowed as she glared at Aaron, &quot;Yet, she did not turn?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, Grandmother,&quot; Aaron said.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I escorted Rachel out of the estate,&quot; Megumi said, &quot;she did not smell like she was about to turn.&quot;  The murmuring did quiet down.  Megumi turned to Aaron and said, &quot;You should have been more careful.  Had you knocked or something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Megumi!&quot; Akane said sharply as she turned to Megumi, &quot;That is enough.&quot;  She then turned back to Aaron and studied him.  As she studied him, her expression softened.  She sighed and said, &quot;In a way, Megumi is right.  You should have been careful.  But assigning blame in this case is much like assigning blame for being wet in a rainstorm. It is clear to me that you two had a bond.  While the two of you are still very young, and bonds don&#39;t normally happen this quick, but it does happen.&quot;  She continued to stare at Aaron as she continued, &quot;No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll punish you.  But I will hold you responsible for Rachel Van Direstag.  I believe that what happened is that the werefox bond you two share manifested itself when you two had a mutual sexual attraction to each other.  Once that happened, you two really couldn&#39;t help yourself.  Had Megumi not arrived, Rachel would be a werevixen now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, grandmother,&quot; a male werefox spoke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Tori-san?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I may,&quot; Tori spoke up, &quot;I think it is probable that Rachel-san may indeed turn to be a werevixen.&quot;<br />
<br />
All heads turned to Tori when he said that.  Akane then asked, &quot;Why do you say that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tori shrank a little from the attention, but then spoke up.  &quot;She may have been exposed to the were-virus already when Aaron-san and Rachel-san started to have sex.&quot;  Murmurs could be heard throughout the room as Tori continued. &quot;The reason I say this is because of what Aaron said.  When Aaron knotted with Rachel, I believe he gave her some of his pre-ejaculate.  This exposed her to the were-virus already.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, this hasn&#39;t happened before!&quot; a voice called out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, cases like this are extremely rare,&quot; Tori responded, &quot;Usually by the time a couple gets to the point where they are knotted, they usually complete the act of having sex and reach orgasm.  This allows the male to de-knot from the female.&quot;  Tori took a breath before continuing, &quot;However, for weres, the sexual response cycle is similar to a humans, including releasing pre-ejaculate as well as ejaculation for the males.  The exposure to the were-virus is very high for ejaculate which is why normal humans change so soon after a complete sexual experience.  As we know, the speed and timing at which a normal turns into a were depends on the amount of the were-virus.  The lower the were-virus exposure, the longer it takes for the human to turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has anyone changed this way?&quot; Akane asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me a moment,&quot; Tori replied as he pulled out his tablet and scrolled through various notes.  &quot;Ah, here we go,&quot; Tori said.  &quot;The Charleston case.  This is the only known case where a normal changed after ingesting a weretiger&#39;s pre-ejaculate, but didn&#39;t ingest his ejaculate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think this case is similar?&quot; Akane asked again.<br />
<br />
&quot;In likelihood, yes,&quot; Tori said while nodding.  &quot;It took until sunset, but...uh...&quot; he paused to look through the case file, &quot;But Karen Charleston, the young woman who changed, she started to give oral sex to a weretiger, but was stopped when he started to ejaculate.  The next night, Karen completed her change from normal to weretiger.  And this was from receiving pre-ejaculate from the weretiger in question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait,&quot; Megumi said, &quot;When we checked Rachel, she still smelled like a normal human.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So did the weretigers that were with Karen,&quot; Tori retorted.  &quot;In fact, Karen&#39;s scent change wasn&#39;t detected until later that afternoon.  If these two cases are similar, then Rachel is going to turn into a werevixen tomorrow night.  Probably about sunset.  But we should be able to detect the change in her scent sometime tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there a chance you&#39;re wrong?&quot; Aaron asked.<br />
<br />
Tori took a breath and said, &quot;Maybe.  Like I said earlier, this is something that&#39;s rare among weres, and hasn&#39;t happened to a werefox.  Usually when a werefox and a normal have sex, they complete the act.  And if what you&#39;re saying is right, then I have no doubt that Rachel has been exposed to the virus through you, young man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough,&quot; Akane said, her voice ringing throughout the room.  &quot;We must prepare for the worst,&quot; she continued.  &quot;Megumi, I want you to keep an eye on Rachel-san.  If you think that she&#39;s going to turn tomorrow night, bring her here.&quot;  Akane sighed and said, &quot;We must take responsibility if Rachel has turned.&quot;</p>
