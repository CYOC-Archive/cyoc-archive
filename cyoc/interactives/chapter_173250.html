<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You woke up groggily the next morning, having not had a very settled sleep. The intense horse-filled nightmares had woken you up several times during the night. <br />
<br />
You slowly rose to your four hooved feet and peaked your head out of your stall. You looked around and guessed that it was quite late in the morning. The Stables were already a hive of activity as attendants, horses and doomed visitors hustled and bustled around the premises.<br />
<br />
However, you were soon distracted by a familiar heat between your legs as you started to fully come to your senses. You were once again reminded of your loss of masculinity as you felt your new sex organ sitting wet and swollen beneath your tail. The nagging pain had also resurfaced deep inside you, making the throbbing in your equine vagina even worse than yesterday.<br />
<br />
You were just thinking about relieving the pressure when you saw a familiar figure walking towards you. Vicky was leading a stallion and mare down the barn’s central aisle, presumably taking them back to their stalls. <br />
<br />
You couldn’t help noticing the contrasting expressions of the two horses. The mare seemed happy and content, while the stallion appeared to be seething with barely-contained rage. You inferred from this that the stallion had been human until very recently. Worryingly however, you found yourself feeling coldly indifferent towards the guest’s cruel fate. <br />
<br />
Without really thinking you called out to Vicky. You intended for the noise to be a simple greeting, but it actually came across as more of a desperate cry of need. Vicky turned her head and smiled, clearly sensing the hint of lust in your voice. “Hello Princess, glad that you’re so pleased to see me. I just need to deal with Anne and Thomas here and then I’ll be right with you.” Upon hearing his name the stallion whinnied loudly and tugged at the rope with which Vicky was leading him. However the attendant showed off her experience and surprising strength as she easily kept the big horse under control. “I’d better get this fine stud settled in before he hurts himself. We don’t want to leave our mares feeling disappointed now do we!?”<br />
<br />
Vicky winked at you as she said this, making you feel hot with embarrassment. Why were you so happy to greet your captor? Were you developing some kind of perverse case of Stockholm Syndrome?<br />
<br />
You continued to watch Vicky and the two horses as they walked past. You noticed her whispering something in Thomas’ ear as they passed your stall. You couldn’t hear exactly what was being said, but the fearful look in his eyes told you that it was nothing good. <br />
<br />
More worryingly however, you were shocked to find that you were actually admiring Thomas rather than sympathising with him. Your eyes lingered on his large muscular physique as he slowly clopped past. You also couldn’t help staring at the stallion’s large ballsack as it bobbed slightly with each of his steps. Seeing the two hefty testicles made you shudder slightly as you thought back to your time with Harry by the lake. Being filled with stallion cum had felt so good before, and now your body wanted it to happen again.<br />
<br />
Following Thomas was the cheerful mare that had transformed him. You felt slightly disturbed as Anne looked at you with a sly grin as she walked past. Presumably she had been at the Stables for a long time, and her look told you that she knew exactly what you were going through. <br />
<br />
Worryingly it soon became apparent that Anne was subtly mocking you. Her look of amused understanding was one shared by many of the other horses and attendants alike. As further proof that the mare was taunting you, she made a point to turn away from you and raise her tail. She neighed and swayed her ass slightly as she flashed you her freshly-bred vagina. You were taken aback by this behaviour, but found it impossible to look away as you stared at the mess between the horse’s legs. Everything around Anne’s sex was coated in mare and stallion juices. Even now a slight stream of pearly white cum was spilling out of the dark slit, indicating that she had received a healthy dose of Thomas’ potent semen.<br />
<br />
Anne let you soak in this vivid image for a short while before she finally lowered her tail and walked away. As you watched her go your mind was racing with confused thoughts. Instead of feeling sad or disgusted you were feeling hot and jealous. You saw Thomas not as a lost soul, but as a potential mate that could satisfy the heat in your loins. You knew that you would end up like Anne if you carried on thinking like this, but upon seeing how happy she was you began to wonder whether it would be all that bad…<br />
<br />
‘NO!’ you mentally screamed as you shook your head. You were a man, not some slutty horse. You had to start fighting back against your body’s desires.<br />
<br />
It was as this battle of wills raged in your mind that Vicky reappeared. She was carrying the same riding gear that she had used yesterday, which meant that you would be doing more of the same for Lesson 5. But you didn’t really care about that. All you wanted was the sick ‘reward’ that the attendant would hopefully grant you if you behaved. You knew it was wrong, but in that moment your human instincts aligned with those of your body; both parts of you wanted the painful heat to be soothed as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
To this end you eagerly kicked the stall door and whinnied as Vicky approached. “Well someone’s in an excitable mood this morning!” Vicky then entered your stall and did her typical inspection of your body. You were shamefully excited as you felt her lifting your tail and inspecting your throbbing vagina. You whinnied as, instead of a finger, you felt the caress of a warm blast of air blowing against your eager sex. You felt your organ tensing from the gentle stimulation, making a slight dribble of your juices ooze out of your tight slit.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm… your first heat seems to have really taken hold,” Vicky announced as she lowered your tail and moved back to your front, “the lust inside you must be unbearable by now. In fact based on the way you looked at Thomas just then I would say that you’re desperate to feel a stallion on your back.” You snorted in defiance, despite agreeing with the attendant’s assessment. “Still pretending you don’t want it huh? Well we’ll see how you feel in a few days time. Before then though we need to get you fully trained-up.”<br />
<br />
With that Vicky began fitting you with a saddle and bridle like she had yesterday. As she did this you tried to remain calm. Your body felt hot and heavy as you stood like a coiled spring. Your pussy had started to wink rhythmically as the fire in your loins burned hotter than it ever had before. You seriously doubted whether you would be able to resist if a stallion was brought to you right now.<br />
<br />
“Come on girl, let’s go!” Vicky snapped you back to your senses with a hard smack on your backside. You quickly started walking out of the stall, not wanting to anger the attendant and risk forfeiting your perverse reward.<br />
<br />
You obediently followed Vicky as she led you past the rows of former-humans as they milled around in their stalls. You instantly felt nervous and embarrassed when you sensed a number of stallions watching you as you passed. You fought your urges to look back at the eager males, instead deciding to bite your tongue and avoid eye contact so as not to encourage them. In spite of this though you could feel your tail starting to rise on its own in order to reveal your slick folds as they continued to wink in need. This made you shudder and tense up as you imagined that the stallions were being turned on by the view you were giving them.<br />
<br />
“Do not feel embarrassed Princess,” Vicky said as she patted your neck, “a sexy filly like you is bound to draw the eye of the opposite sex. Do not worry though, I already have several studs that I plan to introduce you to. You are going to make a wonderful mother, I am certain of it.”<br />
<br />
You snorted and tugged against the lead rope upon hearing this. You were a man, not some damn broodmare!<br />
<br />
Vicky chuckled at your reaction. “So feisty and naughty; the stallions are going to enjoy putting you in your place.” You continued to protest until she pulled you in close, now speaking with a much more serious tone. “And if you continue to misbehave I know a particularly… productive stud farm to send you to. Who knows, I may even send Jessica to join you. I hear that old farmer Rogers often likes to let his stallions blow off some steam, if you get my meaning…”<br />
<br />
You quickly quietened down upon hearing this. You had been so caught up in your own selfish worries that you had completely forgotten about Jessica. You desperately hoped that she was coping with this living hell that you both found yourselves in. You knew your best option was to go along with Vicky’s demands for the time being, at least until an opportunity to escape presented itself.<br />
<br />
To that end you bowed your head in apology and let the attendant lead you through the yard. You ended up in the sandy outdoor arena where Vicky prepared to start Lesson 5…</p>
