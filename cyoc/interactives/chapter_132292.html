<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-Maisy-<br />
<br />
She was still running five minutes later, it was like her own fear had possessed her, she couldn’t stop for air. She felt like she would suffocate. Then she comes to an abrupt halt. Shaking violently, she tried to control herself. Lifting herself onto the ground, she covered her face putting pressure against her head. Safe was the thing she was looking for. It was hidden by maze of terror, she just had to find the right source.<br />
<br />
-1 hour ago- <br />
<br />
“Well what did I tell you?” Said Maisy walking out of the drive thru squinting her body to avoid the rain falling on her. Seth looked up at her and sighed “They probably just have no reception”. Maisy scoffed “Erick wouldn’t go anywhere with even less than 1 bar of reception…I think there’s something wrong”.<br />
<br />
Seth looked up and saw the same concerned look on Maisy she always saw on her “Hey…I’m sure it’s nothing. We’ll just swoop by and say hello- “Seth was cut off by Maisy “That’s if anyone is there to say hello”.<br />
<br />
Seth scrambled through her pockets and threw something at Maisy, Maisy caught it, she always did have a good reaction time “I was going to give it to you earlier…but I forgot”.<br />
<br />
Maisy examined what it was. It was a torch, but not just a battery one but one of those wind-up ones which conserve energy. Seth said, “If you ever feel stressed or scared, just wind up this and your hopes and joy will shine out”, Maisy smirked. It seemed more like a joke gift than a genuine one, but maisy held it tightly and looked up “Well…I think I feel a little bit better now…Lets go check on our friends”.<br />
They both got into the car and drove off to the manor unaware that in the shadows of the nearby forest a figure was watching them. <br />
<br />
-Maisy-<br />
<br />
She gripped the present and started to wind it slowly, the clicking noise seemed soothing and hypnotizing. She kept winding it until she knew there was enough energy in there for a while. She turned it on, and a thick glaze sprung from the torch melting the shadows surprisingly making it a lot easier to see. But to her horror, she saw standing in front of her the monster she had met before. The furry beast.<br />
<br />
Maisy screamed and ran in the opposite direction. She heard the monster snarl angrily and pounce after her.<br />
<br />
She pointed the torch in front of her, illuminating her path. She ran around a corner and then through a hallway, she kept running and running and not stopping to see if the monster was still chasing her. To her horror the torch started flickering, the darkness was winning the battle against the light. She shouted “no” and then the light completely ran out. She stood there in silence and blindness. Completely numbed by her greater senses. She waited for her death.<br />
<br />
But it never occurred.<br />
<br />
She turned around, the monster was gone. She cheered in her head. But her victory was short lived as she heard a familiar scream. It was Erick. He was in danger.<br />
<br />
-Ryan-<br />
<br />
The pain was intensifying, he clutched his chest behind Jonathan and Seth. Ryan was confused why it hurt more after the cast was applied. It was this heaving pain which stagnated Ryan’s movements. He looked up and saw both Jonathan and Seth walking in front of him. “Seth…I’m sorry”. <br />
<br />
Seth stopped moving and turned to Ryan “Umm…Jonathan can you give me and Ryan a minute”. This was his chance to spill everything out. Ryan knew there was a slim chance of them living, so he didn’t want to die with this on his chest.<br />
<br />
“Seth I-<br />
<br />
“Look Ryan, I understand why you did it. You wanted to keep your brother as the same person he always was but we can’t decide that for him, he has to chose that on his own”. Seth interjected, turning around. “I guess, I was angry…not at you but myself. How could I just avoid helping him, I stayed away from him I created these boundaries all because of his condition. I’m the one who should be saying sorry you see…not you”<br />
<br />
Ryan slowly walked up to Seth. “We both did wrong…but now perhaps. That Jonathan may live, we all can start over”. Seth smiled, their faces two inches apart from each other. But Ryan saw something, reflecting in Seth’s eye. Dark dilated pupils, with a black retina staring into Seth’s eyes.<br />
<br />
Seth darted backwards, “Ryan…have you been infected too”. Ryan sighed. “You have…why didn’t you tell me!!”. “Because I didn’t know it was this bad”. Ryan dropped to the floor, so Seth could see the damage “You know if Sei was here, she would scold you for not telling us your condition”.<br />
<br />
Seth looked up at him “Did you find anything else at that lab”, Ryan tried to remember, and then he did. There was this extra program which he couldn’t access the last time he was at the lab. “There was something called “Lb47.bin” I’m not sure what that it”.<br />
<br />
Seth walked back, she drew open the book she found and turned to the second page. There was bit missing between the paragraph and the monster images and just like this number it was labelled lB47. “We need to go back to that lab to save you…Ryan”.<br />
<br />
Ryan stood up “We don’t have time we need to save our friends”. Seth looked annoyed “How about we find our friends, get them out and Jonathan and then we go find the cure”. Ryan nodded this was a smart idea. They needed to find their friends.<br />
<br />
Suddenly they heard a loud scream, it sounded familiar a lot like Erick’s voice. “It’s Erick!” Seth said. The three of them ran towards the sound to try to save their friend.<br />
-Maisy-<br />
<br />
She ran to the landing and saw Erick being throttled by what she can only describe as a monster. It was an eight-legged gigantic spider, which had Erick gripped by it’s mandibles. “Erick” Maisy screamed, she ran down the stairs and looked at the spider.<br />
“No…m-maisy!” Erick said. The spider looked briefly at Maisy but kept throttling Erick. Maisy looked around for some way to help Erick. She saw on the ground, a shotgun. She ran towards it and tried to grab it, but then the spider did attack her, knocking her against the staircase and sending her into darkness.<br />
<br />
-Erick-<br />
<br />
The spider let go off Erick, and slowly advanced towards Maisy, it seemed to be cackling. Erick crawled towards the shotgun reaching for it. The spider now nearly on top of Maisy. Erick grabbed the shotgun and pointed it at the spider “Eat lead spider!”. Erick fired it and the spider cried out in pain retreating from the room, towards what Erick assumed to be the attic. <br />
<br />
Erick stood up and walked towards Maisy “M-maisy are you okay”. Maisy was still knocked out, the collision she had more fatal than he thought. “Maisy!”. Erick started to realise.<br />
<br />
“No no no!” Erick said, “Don’t do this to me Maisy, you are strong you can survive this”. Erick checked for a heart rate…but there was nothing, it was a dead beat and Maisy was gone. <br />
<br />
Suddenly behind Erick, he heard voices coming from the opposite end of the landing. Erick closed Maisy’s eyes in a sign of respect and stood up with 2 more shells and ready. He pointed the gun at the door and waited, the door slammed upon and out come a giant. Erick staggered backwards in complete shock. But before he could shoot, Ryan appeared from behind it and shouted, “No wait…that’s Jonathan, Erick”.<br />
<br />
“W-what” Erick said in disbelief. Seth also followed from behind Jonathan “Well you were right about this place Erick…it’s definitely a mystery”. Seth recognised the look on Erick’s face, it was complete grief and terror. Seth with a tear starting to form in her eye “Erick…what’s wrong”.<br />
<br />
Erick moved out of the way, so Seth could see clearly what was wrong. Laying there was the body of their friend Maisy, blood starting to pour from her head, her face already starting to go pale. Seth fell to the floor in complete sadness “No…NO!!” she cried on the floor, and both Jonathan and Ryan were shocked.<br />
<br />
But then Erick heard it, a familiar piano twang coming from the balcony above. Filled with new anger, Erick bolted up the stairs with both Ryan and Jonathan confused of where he was going. Erick made it to the top of the balcony where he saw the monster which use to be sei. But it was different then before. The white stripes on its wooden figure were now crimson red, with its eyes being a bleached white. “As I said before, you are all under my dominion”. Erick pointed the gun at her and said, “WHY DID YOU KILL MAISY!!” <br />
<br />
“If you want to know that…then you’ll need to read my story”. Erick had enough of this and pressing the trigger of the gun let off a round onto the monster. Its head exploded off. Revealing flesh and blood spewing everywhere. The monster laughed and regenerated its head “That’s a second shot you’ve taken off me…and how does it feel to be able to absolutely nothing!” Erick was confused, there was genuine emotion coming out of this monster now. The monster staggered backwards and ran off into the darkness. <br />
<br />
“The book” Erick said confused. “What book?”.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Erick heard a cry from downstairs. He loading the last bullet ran downstairs prepared for the worst.<br />
<br />
-Jonathan-<br />
<br />
Jonathan had felt incredible a minute ago but now felt like death was hanging over him. He looked down at his friend laying in a bloody pile on the ground and he questioned. Did they really deserve all of this? They had let Erick run off, they didn’t know if they would find him again. <br />
<br />
Suddenly Ryan fell to the ground in excruciating pain. Seth waking up from her tear bed looked around started. Ryan violently shaked on the ground “Seth…its happening you n-need to get Jon and Erick out of here”. Seth looked at him with tears sunken in her face “O-okay”. Jonathan didn’t want to go, he didn’t want to lose his brother again.<br />
<br />
“No Seth, I don’t want to leave him again” Jonathan said in speed. Seth looked up at him “He’ll be find…we’ll find a cure for him and we will all get out of here eventually. Erick ran down the stairs “Wha the hell Is going on”.<br />
<br />
Ryan convulsed forward, sweat pouring from his face “I c-can’t hold it for l-long…you need to go.” Erick silently agreeing with Seth took leave. Jonathan looking at his brother said solemnly “We’ll save you…whatever is happening to you, we will save you”. Seth gestured Jon to leave, he slowly walked out not turning his head back. <br />
<br />
-Seth-<br />
<br />
“Pl-please don’t take him back into that l-lab”. Ryan looked at her slowly convulsing on the ground with his fists clenched “I have to I’m sorry” Seth said this in a strange way, Ryan looked up at her “It would have been so easy you know…to just reveal myself to you in that corridor” Ryan with a confused look on his face stared at Seth “S-Seth what are you t-talking about”.<br />
<br />
She knelt next to him “Seth has been gone for about 20 minutes now…you know you should never turn your back on a friend…especially in this place”. Ryan looking into her eyes said, “You’re not Seth…then who are you?”. The woman got closer to him “I got by many names Becky Lambert, Charlotte Frederick and now…Seth Julie…she’s mine and so are all of you, I’ve sent them to my lab, so I can do even more tests on Jonathan and kill Erick…and you know why I am telling you all of this”. Ryan with sweat now dripping off him asked “Why?”<br />
“Because it doesn’t matter, you’ll never be able to tell them my little pet because well you would have changed into my beautiful creation and the best thing is…you already know what your going to be”. Ryan breathed heavily, laying down on the floor losing focus “You are the one…who gave yourself this transformation”. Charlotte laughed manically and kissed him on the cheek. The liquid on her lips starting to cause a stimulus in Ryan’s body “now let’s get this show on the road”.<br />
<br />
She stood up and snapped her fingers, the front doors opened and revealed a white glow from a white circle in the sky. It shone onto Ryan and he screamed as his transformation began and Seth disappeared.<br />
<br />
-Ryan-<br />
<br />
Ryan confused by all of this, started to violently shake as the moonlight seemed to burn his skin. He couldn’t hold back the transformation anymore. He looked at his hands as the bones in them started cracking, and their started growing outwards growing claws as well. Ryan dropped them to the ground as his feet followed the same process violently cracking and transfiguring, the claws in his feet ruptured the shoes he was wearing. He tried to tear them off by he then felt an incredible pain in his dick. <br />
<br />
He growled as his dick started to harden and expand, he felt his voice go denser and deeper. He looked down and saw his dick pushing against his trousers. Ryan cried out in pain, as he pulled of his shirt. His pecs were starting to harden too and grow in size, same with his biceps, triceps and abdominal muscle in his legs. They pushed against his clothes tightening them.<br />
<br />
Ryan then felt this weird sensation fall over him, the transformation was becoming less painful and more pleasurable. He started enjoying it groaning as his muscles expanded, it felt good it felt pleasant. He tore off his clothes allowing his muscles to grow out and expand. He lifted his neck back and allowed a lump to form under there making his voice even deeper than before. <br />
<br />
He threw himself forward and felt his back crack and configure in size. His shoulders pushing out violently convulsing against his rapidly changing body.  Hair was forming across his entire body, thickening his skin and giving him a strong coating. He groaned pleasurably as his balls grew as well.  Finally, he felt his head stretch forwards into a muzzle. His vision grew better and more colourful, he could feel his smell getting better.<br />
<br />
But then he felt it, it hit him right in the head, he trembled as his memories started to fade.<br />
<br />
“Well…let’s just say you were asleep and then you ended up here” I never should have lied to him, this is all my fault.<br />
<br />
“I gave you everything” But then I took it all away again…I’m such a terrible brother.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t tell you…to save you…I’m sorry Jon” I lied to myself and made my brother a monster.<br />
<br />
“Because I didn’t know it was this bad” I should have known how bad it was to not put him in danger.<br />
<br />
“Pl-please don’t take him back into that l-lab” My last hope gone. I would forever be lost in sadness knowing my brother would fall victim to this woman.<br />
<br />
I failed Erick…I failed Sei and Mike…. I failed Maisy…I failed Seth…and even from the start…. I had failed Jonathan.<br />
The monster growled as it flexed its new body. It found only one purpose in life…to continue the cycle. It looked down at Maisy and grapped her to take her to her sanctuary. <br />
<br />
-Seth-<br />
<br />
Seth smirked as she walked down the corridor, she had completed the first task now she would start the next. Walking up towards Jonathan and Erick she said “Now we have to save Ryan”. Jonathan looked down the corridor “Is he really gone”. Seth looked at him and put her hand on his arm “We’ll save him I promise…and Erick we will stop your death”.<br />
<br />
“How can you be so sure” Erick said looking back at her. Seth smiled and brought out the speltstorm horror “Our future rests in my hands”. <br />
<br />
Erick and Jonathan walked first down the basement and Seth stood there at the top. She heard the roar of a monster just barely not enough for the others to hear “Thankyou Ryan…for helping me…and I promise…I will change the future”. She laughed holding the book walking down into the darkness.<br />
<br />
-End of Spelstorm Horror-<br />
<br />
Thank you for reading all the way through my story, I knew its a little convoluted and has way too many characters. But it was fun to write and that&#39;s all that matters in the end. Anyway this isn&#39;t the end of the story....no it&#39;s just the beginning. Spelstorm Horror is just one book of many and now we&#39;ll see the next part. <br />
