<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It had been two weeks since Jeff had been punished. Trapped as a stone gnome statue with a humongous, disproportional cock, Jeff had been exposed to everyone that walked or passed by. The amount of humiliation he’d suffered as every neighbor scoffed or snickered had rattled his brain. He’d never grown used to it, nor the fact that his huge stone cock had been peeing out of his perpetually full bladder. To top it all off, he was at maximum levels of horniness, wishing the whole time that he could pleasure himself, but unable to even move!<br />
<br />
Jeff was beginning to think that there was no end in sight, but one afternoon, his father came and scooped him up from the front lawn. He didn’t speak a word to the gnome Jeff, and just carried the still peeing statue back into the house and up the stairs.<br />
<br />
His brain was rattled, but his heart grew with excitement as he noticed his mother at the Chronivac.“Okay, Jeff,” she said out loud. “I do believe it is time for a change.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s dad quietly placed Jeff in the middle of the floor, where he had been initially transformed. He was still peeing as his mother typed away at the Chronivac, specifying the conditions to Jeff’s transformation.<br />
<br />
“Hopefully,” Jeff’s mother said, “You find this just as embarrassing as you did when you were unfrozen in front of your father. Now both of your parents will watch as you lose control.”<br />
Jeff wasn’t looking forward to that part, but the day finally arrived! He would finally have some relief! His mother pressed enter, and Jeff was once again living and breathing.<br />
<br />
Immediately, a gigantic burst of cum was jettisoned from Jeff’s cock onto the floor. The burst itself lasted three seconds, and the next subsequent spurt lasted nearly as long. Jeff felt all the build up from the past two weeks finally shoot from his balls, and he let out a primal, elongated grunt as it did.<br />
<br />
It was only by the forth or fifth spurt that Jeff realized that his parents were still looking…down at him? His waves of pleasure were interrupted by waves of realization as he realized the hands gripping his cock were still gnome hands, his cock still obscenely oversized. Finally, his orgasm died down, and his face turned bright red as he looked up at his parents. As before, his bladder released it’s piss involuntarily, but this time it was his gnome sized bladder. His pee mingled with the gobs of semen on the floor, until he was finally emptied of juices.<br />
<br />
“What,” Jeff muttered, speaking for the first time in weeks. “What is happening?”<br />
<br />
He was denied an answer as he once again fell on his back and blacked out.  <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
When Jeff woke up, he was no longer in his room. He was laying in grass, the coolness of the earth chilling his naked backside. Looking up, he found himself in his backyard. He was still gnome sized, still naked, but…his cock was gone. He pulled up his tubby gnome belly and found that he was still male, but instead of an oversized cock, an undersized, uncircumcised nub and tiny balls sat between his legs.<br />
<br />
He was a real gnome now, wearing nothing but a tall, pointy red hat on his head. He looked towards the porch, startled to see his father sitting there, just staring at him.<br />
<br />
“I’m sure this is a bit of a shock, Jeff,” his father started.<br />
<br />
Jeff interrupted him, “What is going on?” His voice was a nasally version of his regular voice, higher as well, matching his new body. “How long do I have to stay like this? Why am I still be punished? I’ve learned my lesson!”<br />
<br />
His father smirked, then chuckled. “You’re a lot cuter than I imagined you’d be. Your mom sure did a bang up job getting you like this.”<br />
<br />
Jeff covered his tiny gnome junk. He felt himself blush harder than ever before. “Dad, I don’t see the point in being a naked gnome? Isn’t the punishment supposed to fit the crime? I&#39;ve been in agony for the last two weeks, and I only know that because I counted the sunsets!”<br />
<br />
Dad smiled and shook his head. “This isn’t a punishment, Jeff. This is a vacation! And it was my idea.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was astounded. “Yours? But, mom was the one that wanted a gnome.”<br />
<br />
“You’re right,” Dad replied. “And it was my idea to keep you as one. You see, we don’t really see how we could let you be a human again. After all, you’d probably just find your way back to that computer of yours and turn yourself into something else! So, we’ve decided what you are going to be. I thought you looked quite nice as a gnome. Aside, of course, from that ridiculous phallus. So, I had your mom turn you into a much more suitable version of yourself, bring you to life, and boom! There you are! Cute as a button.”<br />
<br />
Jeff shook his gnome head in disbelief. “What am I supposed to do as a naked gnome? Wander around the backyard jerking off and eating grass?”<br />
<br />
His dad sat silent for a moment, looking around. Then he responded. “Sure. If you want. From the porch to the fence, this backyard is all yours.”<br />
<br />
Jeff realized his father was serious. He looked around at his “new domain.” What was he supposed to eat? What was he supposed to wear? Where was he supposed to sleep? Through all these things, he realized…this was ridiculous!<br />
<br />
“This is stupid! I want to be your human son again! I was just about to leave the house!” Jeff whined in his new gnome-like voice. Even he could admit, it wasn’t very convincing.<br />
<br />
His dad chuckled in response. “You were about to do no such thing. In fact, you were obviously more ready to be literally stuck in your room as a statue than go out and make something of yourself. You have no prospects out in the real world. So, why not try making this your new world? It’s a pretty big backyard, Jeff.”<br />
<br />
“No fair,” Jeff said. “I want to turn back!”<br />
<br />
“We can think about that,” Jeff’s dad said. “Maybe when the summer is over. In a few months, we will have to reassess your living situation one way or another.” Jeff’s dad stood up. “I’m not completely inconsiderate. Come with me.”<br />
<br />
Jeff’s dad stood up and started to walk over towards a corner of the yard, near the garden. Jeff turned, hands still covering his crotch. He started to take his first steps as a gnome and promptly fell over. His father kept walking in strides he couldn’t match.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Jeff yelled, but to no response. He decided to uncover his little nub in an effort to run faster. He now felt like he was wading through truly tall grasses, even though it was just an unmowed lawn.<br />
<br />
Finally, he caught up with his father. “Look,” his dad said, pulling aside the branches of a bush. In a little clearing, a perfectly sized mushroom with a door had been placed. It was tacked to a tree, shaped and textured just like a mushroom. Most importantly, it was just his size.<br />
<br />
“I’m supposed to live here?” Jeff, walking buck naked up to the abode.<br />
<br />
“It would be nice if you did,” his father replied. “I worked on it for a while. Turned random objects into a living, breathing mushroom home. It has only one level at the moment, but is a good starter for you. Nothing too complex, mind you. But you could easily shape those rooms into a living room, kitchen, and bedroom. Didn’t think you’d need a bathroom, since you’re living in the outdoors. But that is up to you.”<br />
<br />
“Dad, I have so many questions,” Jeff started to say. “Am I really supposed to just live out here in the backyard? I get that it is big, and yeah, this real mushroom house is crazy cool. But what am I supposed to eat? Do you expect me to just go naked? And, I swear, mom’s done something to program me to be really embarrassed. It’s like the more I’m around you, the more I want to run away!”<br />
<br />
“That is good to hear, actually,” his dad replied. “We’ve designed this experience to teach you a lesson at the very least, and hopefully enjoyable at most. Hopefully you’ll learn some responsibility in this, but that is truly up to you.<br />
<br />
“You are now in charge of your own survival. You have plenty of resources around you. You can make tools, clothes, gather food, everything you need. There is even a garden that you can take from if you get hungry. Hopefully, you won’t need too much, seeing as you are pretty small. But, we will see.<br />
<br />
“Because we have the Chronivac, we are able to help you out. Every day, you will have the option of leaving a note asking for one thing from us. I’ve already put a notepad and pencil in your home. You’ll leave the note over there, by the bird bath. It’s up to us whether or not we will grant you that thing, so be wise. For instance, we aren’t going to grant you a bazooka or an entire cooler full of food. That would defeat the purpose. If you ask for something and we don’t grant it, then you get nothing for that day.<br />
<br />
“And as you’ve mentioned, you’ve started to feel very nervous around us. That is on purpose. We designed you to be very fearful of humans. As a way to quell that fear, I’ve set up a barrier of pebbles. We will never go past this, so rest assured that you will be safe from us.”<br />
<br />
Jeff noticed the barrier. He had the whole backyard as his world, but his property line was considerable as well. He realized that his dad was inside the line, and was fighting the growing urge to rush inside his house.<br />
<br />
His father continued. “You are also going to remain embarrassed to be naked around humans. Hopefully making your penis into an appropriately sized acorn will help with that. That being said, we have one setback that you will have to face.” His father paused, considering how to address the issue. “We realize that the reason that you got yourself into trouble is your inability to curtail your horny nature. So, you will have to overcome that issue in this form as well. You wont be as horned up as you were when you were a statue, but by tomorrow, you will be abnormally horny for sure. You&#39;ll either have to pull on your little gnome nub several times a day, or if you can conquer your libido, barely at all. If you can curb, curtail, or properly manage your horny habits, you can do anything, my boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could feel his nub harden as his dad spoke. He could feel the little length of penis that he had begin to stick straight up. He shook, his libido and fear climbing to unbearable levels. The little gnome pranced in place. Deciding to make one last plea, he yelled. &quot;Please! Turn me back! I don&#39;t want to do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, son,&quot; his dad replied. &quot;You have no choice.&quot; As his dad started to walk away, Jeff ran screaming into his new mushroom home. Jeff closed the door, and then took his gnome nubbin in between two of his fat fingers. It didn&#39;t take a whole lot of jiggling before he squirted his store of gnome sperm onto the floor, christening his new gnome home.  </p>
