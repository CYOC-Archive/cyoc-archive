<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So, what is teenie greenie wanting with converting more humie elders into goblins?” Jak-Jak asked Kyl-Kyl as they walked around the retirement home.<br />
<br />
“Me just wanting more gobbos in world for to improve and take over it,” Kyl-Kyl shrugged, “This all started when bully cheerleader pantsed me when gobbo was humie, so me turn her into fucktoy gobbo. This cause her turn <i>me</i> into gobbo like her, which led to us wanting to gobbo our families, our friends, and our friends families because gobbos ultimately improve world.”<br />
<br />
“Jak-Jak following,” the kobold replied, scratching his scaly chin, “is probably good plan too, ‘cept gobbo is bound to the witch game curse. Answer question, greenie, is still your turn?”<br />
<br />
“Err… well… no,” Kyl-Kyl answered, facepalming in frustration, “Ugh, and me suppose kobold am has no such limitations?”<br />
<br />
“Jak-Jak have different limit,” he explained, producing a wand with a strange gemstone in the middle, “Master give me this wand for job, ‘cept all it <i>can</i> do is job, that is turn old humies into baby dragons. Maybe if gobbo make wand that retcon humies into gobbos then job easier? Am not hard to make. Just need wood, your blood, and in gobbo’s case an emerald. Dragon wand here use dragon blood and amber instead, see?”<br />
<br />
“Me sees,” Kyl-Kyl said thoughtfully, “Hmm, me think me can do that, just need curse again.”<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
Sam-Sam certainly got a ton of strange looks from the other goths when she went to convene with them after school, but they just as quickly brushed it off. The East Hampton High School goths, being descended from actual witches, were basically immune to temporal anomalies. That went double for any caused by Transform or Dare, seeing as it was their witchy ancestors that created the cursed game in the first place.<br />
<br />
“So you got turned into a horny WoW goblin,” the current head of the group Alexander noted, “no doubt by our great ancestors’ game. Thoughts on your new form?”<br />
<br />
“Aside from the grassy stench?” Sam-Sam replied, “quite honestly liberating. I’m ludicrously intelligent, no longer feel pressured to wear clothes or abstain from sex, and I’m pretty sure my skin is about as tough as iron. Not a bad deal, and also not a bad middle finger to the establishment.”<br />
<br />
“Never would have thought that joining the cheer team would lead to you turning into a goblin,” another girl Myrtle observed, “but I must ask, what do you intend to do next?”<br />
<br />
“As it happens, it’s my turn to use the curse now,” Sam-Sam grinned, “and I figure that if there’s plans to make more goblins, why not stir the creative pot just a little bit?”<br />
<br />
“Ooh, what’s your idea?” a perky goth Beatrice asked.<br />
<br />
“I was thinking of turning the football team into hobgoblins,” Sam-Sam explained, “Six foot tall, strong, yellow skinned, flat nosed hobgoblins. I figure they can be as smart as us small, green skinned fucktoys, but instead of engineering and quantum mechanics and other sciences, they can use their brains for military applications and peace keeping efforts  and so forth. Probably a good idea to make them subservient to us green skinned goblins too, just as an added measure.”<br />
<br />
“Well, go forward with your plan, Samantha,” Alexander nodded, “We intend to watch you and the other goblins with great interest.”<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
“Oh ho! That am our Kyl-Kyl,” the goblin boy’s gram-gram chuckled, “Always braining outside of box he am! Even as wrinkled as me am, gobbo never stops impressing me!”<br />
<br />
“So is Gram-Gram use curse on me? Please?” Kyl-Kyl asked, “It for good of gob-kind!”<br />
<br />
“Why of course, sweet pea!” Gram-Gram giggled, “Transform or Dare?”<br />
<br />
“Dare!”<br />
<br />
“Smart choice,” Gram-Gram nodded, “Okay then, me dare you to give your Gram-Gram a big hug!” Of course he was going to hug his grandmother regardless, but he was glad that it was all she had in mind for him. After giving his granny her hug, he said his goodbye-for-nows to his grandparents and went to continue with his plan to goblin-ize more of his companions’ grandparents.<br />
<br />
“You, golum nurse,” he said to one of the idle nurses, “Transform or Dare?”<br />
<br />
“I sense that you want to transform me into something else,” the nurse said in steady monotone, “I answer with both.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, me transform you into magic wand that retcons humies into gobbos like me and Jen-Jen and friends and so on. You am made of wood and gobbo blood and emerald in the middle. Me dare you to only work in gobbo hands, too.” In an instant, the golum nurse transformed into a wand exactly like Kyl-Kyl described. Now he no longer needed the curse to make more goblins. This wand would make his plan far more efficient to achieve!<br />
<br />
“Now where am other gobbos’ grandparents?”<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Jen-Jen looked at her phone as she had Pearl and Martha tidy the mansion, “It look like Kyl-Kyl figure out how to make more gobbos faster. Gobbo population expand exponentially now, however <i>him</i> doing it. Plus gobbo grandparents have more kids than before, and now there am more gobbo families!” Indeed as she watched reality warp around her, she noticed more emblems and symbols of goblin families line the walls of her manor. More and more goblins could be found outside of Glendale proper than ever before, and all of them were inventing and patenting more beneficial technology. A few examples included sustainable perpetual energy generators from Kim-Kim’s clan, plans for lunar terraforming and colonization from Sue-Sue’s clan, and what looked like infinite wireless internet from a brand new clan that just popped into existence due to temporal fuckery.<br />
<br />
“So Jen-Jen am third-generation gobbo now?” the green skinned girl asked herself aloud as she searched through her phone’s pictures. Unfortunately her grandparents on her father’s side lived abroad on some island paradise, retiring in luxury. Her mother’s side lived in Glendale at least, but Kyl-Kyl hadn’t gotten to them yet. Maybe she’d give him a call later and tell him where her grandparents are later because just then her phone rang. It was Ril-Ril, one of her cheer team friends.<br />
<br />
“Jen-Jen!” the girl shouted down the phone, “You gotta come back to school! Sam-Sam do suffin’ weird to football humies… uh, ‘cept they no humies no more.”<br />
<br />
“Meh, it probably no big problem,” Jen-Jen reasoned, “Sam-Sam probably make football team into more gobbo hunks!”<br />
<br />
“That just thing,” Ril-Ril continued, “They no normal gobbos. They <i>hob</i>gobbos! You gotta come see the dicks on these guys! Me know how much gobbo like big dicks!”<br />
<br />
Jen-Jen’s heart started racing. She immediately hung up and bolted out the door. “Cat-maids hold down fort until gobbo come back,” she shouted, “Me want some fuck!”<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
“And that am last humie grandparent now gobbo,” Kyl-Kyl nodded with one last flick of his wand, “Or at least all ones living here. Me still gotta find ones who live out of town, but me worry about that later. Me can already tell world improving faster and faster.” Indeed as he walked outside he noticed a lot more hover cars on the road than before. He also noticed a billboard that advertised moon colonization was “Coming Soon”. It was nothing short of amazing. That’s when he noticed something strange about a police officer. The woman’s skin was a leathery yellow tint, her ears were somewhat bat-like, her nose was flat against her face, and she had the musculature of an Olympic athlete. And for some reason he immediately recognized this officer as a hobgoblin. He didn’t remember there ever being hobgoblins before, however, so there was only one logical explanation. Someone else had used the curse on her.<br />
<br />
—-///—-<br />
<br />
Football practice had devolved into a full-on orgy by the time both Jen-Jen and Kyl-Kyl arrived. It looked like every other green skinned high schooler was there getting absolutely railed by their taller yellow skinned counterparts. Jen-Jen’s eyes were wide with amazement and her heart pounded in her chest like it was primed to explode. Kyl-Kyl on the other hand was flustered, wanting to know who was responsible for this. The two were approached by one of the free hobgoblin football players, who knelt before them like an obedient soldier.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to our orgy, small masters,” the hobgoblin greeted, “I am Maximilian, although you might call me Max-Max in your tongue. I am at your service, whether that be as a bodyguard, a sexual servant, a soldier, or as an athlete, as are my other hobgoblin brothers and sisters. I am sure you have many questions?”<br />
<br />
“Me have important one,” Jen-Jen asked right away, “is that dick taken?” At that moment, the hobgoblin Maximilian grabbed the goblin Jen-Jen’s hips and immediately started plowing her pussy, much to the green girl’s giggling delight.<br />
<br />
“And you, other master?” the hobgoblin asked unfazed.</p>
