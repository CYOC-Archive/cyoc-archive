<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The cop seemed to find her awkward attempts at reaching for the watch somewhat endearing, allowing that to distract him as the events went on. Officer Hank Blanchford had been a very muscular man indeed, with a head full of thick black hair and light blue eyes, his muscled build basically stuffed into a police uniform. The female officers on the force abbreviated his name to &quot;Officer Hunk&quot; rather than Officer Hank. While he officially told them hitting on him was not within police policy, unofficially, it was an open secret that Hank seemed to sleep around with these very same female officers.<br />
<br />
Not that he was exactly Officer Hunk any more by the time the little girl got her hands on the watch. &quot;Atch! Atch!&quot; Nora finally stopped it from undertaking its temporal manipulation - just in time to stop the distracted officer from regressing any further. As he leaned back up, Hank noticed something was up. His clothes were hanging off of him awkwardly - and his keys had fallen out of his pocket. His eyes widened.<br />
<br />
Recognition was starting to hit. Hank frantically opened up the mirror in the front seat as he slowly felt his heart sink into his stomach.<br />
<br />
Now, Hank had always been a very active, fit young man even going back to his teenage years. Among his class, he had really taken to physical activity and had been a part of his middle school football team - he was even the QB! Fifteen year old Hank Blanchford stared back at him in the mirror - his reduced but still rather toned pecs sticking out of his now much too large police clothes. His smooth, boyish face saw his hat hanging off of his head.<br />
<br />
His pants were billowy and refused to fit - even his underwear was slipping around on him. His thinner arms showed slightly muscular biceps, shoulders and lats displaying but nowhere near as powerfully built as when he was an adult. Hank had just seen all his work to build up his body undone within an instant by the &quot;atch&quot;. He got it near instantly - and screamed about three times before stopping. His eyes wild and looking around. Desperately hoping he was done.<br />
<br />
Yeah, nothing seemed different any more. He was 15 year old Hank Blanchford. With the mind of 31 year old Hank. His seasoned police force mind immediately rationed out what happened to him, &quot;T-The watch! No wonder she was so keen on getting her hands on it. She was trying to stop it from doing that to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank got out of the car, deciding to take stock of his situation. At least the little girl&#39;d be safe in his police car. He looked himself over again in the rearview mirror. &quot;The watch must have some kind of regressive power. It turned me from an adult all the way back to age 15. Fucking dammit...&quot; Hank shook his head as he finished - his voice was squeaking and it seemed he was back in that phase of puberty. Where his voice was changing, his body was growing, and things were just so awkward.<br />
<br />
Hank ran a hand through his hair - his bushy, teenage cut just seemed so unprofessional for how he was as an adult... but then, nobody&#39;d be able to believe that this teenager was once a cop. He could deal with his hair at a later date. He had to find a way to get this kid into custody and hopefully find a way to deal with whatever this watch was up to. Against his better judgement Hank decided to try and call it in on his communications in the car.<br />
<br />
He got back in and got the car working after a moment, &quot;A-Ahem, uhh, 10-24, 10-24, this is Officer Hank Blanchford. There&#39;s a kid here who needs to be picked up posthaste.&quot;<br />
<br />
The response he got was sadly predictable. &quot;Kid, I dunno who you are, but you don&#39;t sound like Hank. We&#39;re sending someone over. This better not be some kind of prank, you got me?&quot; The response was curt, irate and Hank shook his head. Before anything else could happen, Hank got out of the car. If he had to guess it&#39;d be a while before someone got over here. They probably weren&#39;t gonna be taking his condition and the incident out here very seriously.<br />
<br />
Once Hank was out of the car, he took his shirt off and fastened his belt tighter to try to make his incredibly loose pants stay up. At best they were still a little loose, but at least he wasn&#39;t running around more or less naked. &quot;Whew, now that that&#39;s taken care of...&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard someone walking over, and thought he heard one of the neighbors doors swinging a little. He turned his head and gulped. It looked like one of the neighbors was coming over. She was a rather pretty woman, looked like she was in that exactly right part of middle age. Her light blond hair was arranged in a somewhat wavy fashion, her bust standing out against her blouse. Her bust...!<br />
<br />
Hank gulped and the woman looked him over once she was over. &quot;Excuse me, young man, are you...dressing up as a police officer for some odd reason? Is this a youtube video prank?&quot; She seemed to be sizing him up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh, no ma&#39;am. I&#39;m just uhh, trying to help out over here and...uhh...umm...&quot; Hank didn&#39;t know why he was reacting like this. He usually had no trouble talking to women, but he guessed his unstable hormones in his younger state were making him a lot less suave and capable when it came to women.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what.&quot; She said as she beckoned for him, &quot;How about you come over for a moment and we can talk. See what&#39;s going on. Are you hungry?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank saw nothing wrong with that last part as he felt his stomach rumble - it seemed regressing to his teenage years really worked up an appetite. He shrugged, &quot;Sure! I&#39;m feeling pretty hungry. Uhh, just I wanna make sure that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure whatever important police business you&#39;re on,&quot; She said with a wink as if it was some sort of joke what he was doing, &quot;Will get done as needed. Come on in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hank sighed and followed her into her house, figuring he could trust the officers to show up at least eventually. Besides, he really did need to eat. And the house she came out of looked generously large and like it was in good condition. So she probably had some nice food ready in the fridge or something. &quot;By the way, miss, what&#39;s your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Jane Robinson.&quot; She responded as she shut the door on her way in behind Hank.</p>
