<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sybil spent the entire evening crying as the thoughts of her Daniel went round and round in her mind. His own worries over becoming a pony and giving up his human life now seemed to hit home.<br />
<br />
Then too Daniel's deep love for family, his Father and Mother she saw how much their love meant to him. Professor Haun, she wondered what scheme he used to make Daniel think being a pony stallion was just a barrel of fun? She thought of his fear for Randy Fuller when the Professor showed Daniel his good friend changing from teenager to a cow.<br />
<br />
She thought about how Daniel thought of Lilly, and Marge his two favorite mares. The preoccupation he thought about of having sex, mounting, and more sexual pleasures with his friends. All this and more she wondered the night away.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane being a strong willed person and knowing the reasons she agreed to become a part of the animal husbandry experiments, sat reading and rereading the printed matter which flowed out the printer.<br />
<br />
Doctor Virgil Hornaday was busy the evening long with the delivery of four new mares from the Sunrise Research Foundation. It was his position to test them for being fertile enough to produce a foal. The repeat of Marge's experience when she birthed her first, was in fact a almost total human child. The legal problems of getting a birth certificate and normal documents showing both father and mother had to be forged. <br />
<br />
So Virgil remained rather busy leaving his mind occupied and not a worry about Prince Daniel.<br />
<br />
Prince Daniel on the otherhand was like his Mother. He paced about the stall snorting often, shaking his head and mane. Who could say how much of his time being questioned was still going over and over in his limited pony brain.<br />
<br />
Morning came with the standard happenings Daniel had come to accept as the start to yet another day as a pony. A bucket of fresh water placed in his stall and a dishpan loaded with a mixture of raw grain. Daniel loved it when just before any mating session the Doctor would add a dark short beer to his feed.<br />
<br />
Once his appetite was appealed Daniel would stretch his stance and with a partial erection let flow the damned up flood of pony urine. Sniffing the air as it roared out the open end of his flacid pony cock Daniel had found this to be a perfume of sorts.<br />
<br />
One thing done it wasn't long before the bowels had a preasure which needed release. This was still a vile thing to the pony Daniel was. He would move to a corner close to his stall's door and let loose the gates. The resulting pile of hot stinch was then readily at hand for the stable groom to remove on his first round that morning.<br />
<br />
Now Daniel felt ready to meet what came for the day. He would let his human imagination mix with the lusty thoughts of the stallion he had been. The result was several moments of rich sexual passion. In those minutes Daniel's flacid cock would stiffen until rigidly erect. As his memories went round and round he began the ritual of pony stallion masturbation. This act was strange to him when first transitioned into a Dartmoor pony stallion's form. Now though after the year and many months he'd been a stallion pony the act of masturbation was experienced four or five times a day.<br />
<br />
Sometimes Doc Hornaday would come and watch as prince Daniel was lost in a mist of sexual memories and bestial passion. As the moment passed off Daniel would notice his act having been seen and wander into a corner of his stall feeling foolish or maybe as if he was bad.<br />
<br />
Today was again going to be the second day of his brain scan and after two full days cooped up his human thoughts were clearer and readily on his mind.<br />
<br />
Eleven-O-clock found Daniel stuffed into the mating stall, the electrodes attached to his pony skull, and the computer warming up.<br />
<br />
To Daniel's right and left of his face was two chairs. One each for the two real women in his life, Miss Jane, and Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ladies, we are ready to begin!&quot; said Doc.<br />
<br />
Sybil sat to the left chair, while Miss Jane sat to the right of Daniel.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane began, &quot;Daniel no doubt your mind is clearer of the those lusty ways of a pony. Do tell us now of what you feel!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;MOM, MISS JANE, FEEL, DANIEL FEELS SAD FOR GIVING UP HIS PARENTS FOR BECOMING A PONY AND ANIMAL. DANIEL LIED THE WILD FEELING OF HIS CHANGE FROM HUMAN TEEN TO THE STRONG AND AGILE FORM OF A PONY. DANIEL HATED THE PROFESSOR FOR WHAT HE DID TO RANDY, BOB, AND JANET. DANIEL FEELS..&quot; Suddenly Sybil exploded off her seat stopping Daniels thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bob and Janet, Bobby Anderson and Janet Anderson, them too, Daniel!&quot; said Sybil a statement and as much a question.<br />
<br />
Daniel snorted a couple of times and then began again.<br />
<br />
&quot;YES MOM, DANIEL TOLD BOB AND JANET OF HIS BIG PLAN TO EARN EXTRA MONEY IN THE RESEARCH OPENING ADVERTISED BY THE PROFESSOR HAUN. DANIEL DID NOT KNOW THAT BOB WENT DOWN AND APPLIED THE DAY AFTER DANIEL. DON'T KNOW WHEN JANET CAME THERE BUT THE PROFESSOR SHOWED THEM TO DANIEL WHEN DANIEL WAS ALMOST COMPLETE IN TRANSITIONING. BOB WAS BECOMING A AFRICAN GNU GOAT AND JANET DANIEL'S GIRLFRIED WAS BECOMING HIS FEMALE GNU. PROFESSOR HAD THEM SOLD TO A ZOO AS A MATED SET READY FOR MATING PURPOSES. BOB WAS NOT KEEPING HIS MENTAL MIND AND MEMORIES BUT THE PROFESSOR MADE JANET KEEP HERS AS HE WATCHED AN LAUGHED. DANIEL SAW HER PAIN. JANET MY LOVE WAS IN PAIN FROM THE HORRID FEAR OF BECOMING A BRUTE ANIMAL. THE DAY DANIEL SHIPPED OUT TO COME AND LIVE HERE, BOBBY AND JANET LEFT TOGETHER IN BIG WOOD CRATES FOR THEIR LIVES IN A ZOO.&quot; told Daniel his mental thoughts almost weeping tears that as a pony he could not do.<br />
<br />
Sybil turned to Miss Jane, &quot;That explains a lot about what was going on in our town back then. The Anderson family put out a $25,000. dollar reward on information about the two missing children. The money was never collected and the case of the missing kids was never solved, until now!&quot; said Sybil.<br />
<br />
Miss Jane grinned, &quot;Now we have a path to follow and at the end of that path a pair of Gnu's with partial human DNA. As the Professor Beaker presses me and maybe you too for his desires, we on the otherhand will have a crutch to stand on! I will begin a check under Bobby and Janet's names for information on there placement through the research compaies' own websight.&quot; said Miss Jane. &quot;Continue Daniel, what are your thoughts about living here as a pony?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DANIEL CAME HERE AND AFTER A MONTH AS THIS DARTMOOR STALLION THE FEELING OF PASSION, RAW WILD DESIRES, EASY OPEN EXPERSSION OF THOSE FEELINGS AND THEN AFTER MOUNTING LILLY, LILLY, LILLY...OH AFTER LILLY THE LUST TO ENJOY AND FEEL THAT TOUCHING WAS ALL DANIEL COULD THINK ABOUT. lILLY, DANIEL SNIFFED HER RICH SCENT, IT DROVE THE PONY BRAIN INSANE, DANIEL WATCHED IN REPULSE FEELINGS AS DANIEL LICKED THE TONGUE UP LILLY'S RUMP. HER BLACKENED LIPS OF SEX WINKED PINK UNDERNEATH. DANIEL STOOD SHAKING WATCHING THE INSTINCTIVE ACTIONS OF HIS PONY STALLION SELF DO WHAT FOR A HUMAN WAS OUTLANDISH. DANIEL'S TONGUE LICKED HER BROWN JUICES SWALLOWING IT. LILLY SPURTED OUT SOME PEE AND THE SCENT MADE DANIEL GET WILD AS IF IN A MAD FRENZY. DANIEL JUMPED UP DANIEL'S FORELEGS SPREAD OVER LILLY'S BACK. DANIEL'S PENIS, NO DANIEL IS PONY, PONY'S HAVE A COCK, DANIEL'S COCK RIGID, WILD RAGE A NEED, A DESIRE, TO FEEL, TO ENJOY, MALE PLEASURE, DOMINATE, OH THE FEEL. DANIEL MOVED CLOSER DANIEL'S COCK POKED HERE AND THERE TILL TOUCHED WARM MOIST FEEL. PUSH, THRUST, IN DEEP, DEEPER, SHEATH TOUCHED THE WINKING LIPS OF LILLY'S SEX. LILLY TICKLED DANIEL'S SHEATH, GRABBED DANIEL'S COCK, HELD TIGHT SO TIGHT, SO TIGHT. DANIEL PUSH IN, DANIEL PULL BACK LILLY HOLD TIGHT MAKE DANIEL FEEL WILD PASSION. IN, BACK, IN, BACK SEVERAL TIMES TILL DANIEL FEEL BUILDING URGE. DANIEL FEEL EXPLOSION INSIDE LILLY AS DANIEL'S SPERM SPURT OUT LIKE A ROARING RIVER OF HOT HEAT. LILLY JUMP BUT STAY HOLDING DANIEL TIGHT. LILLY RELAX, DANIEL STEP BACK, DANIEL'S COCK SLIDE OUT LIKE LONG SENSUAL SNAKE. DANIEL STAND DOWN AND RELAX BUT LILLY TURN CAME NEAR LICKING DANIEL'S COCK. PASSION RETURNED. DANIEL AND LILLY DO AGAIN AND AGAIN. FEELINGS, PASSION, LUST, DESIRES, ALL GOOD MEMORIES INSIDE DANIEL.&quot; told Daniel though the brain scan computer and printer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suggest we let him rest and eat he can start anew later!&quot; suggested the Doc.<br />
<br />
Sybil in tears and Miss Jane get up and as they walk out of the barn Daniel lets loose a loud whinny.</p>
