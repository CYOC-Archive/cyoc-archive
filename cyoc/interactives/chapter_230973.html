<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nathan took a deep breath as he felt the final wave of energy flow from the medallion and into his body. He felt its powers course through him, transcending him from an everyday, unexceptional guy into something so incredible, so powerful, so much more than human, that he needed a moment to take it all in. <br />
<br />
“Ahhh,” he exhaled as he looked down at his body and what it had become: a complete and sculpted, chiseled, bronzed, perfected specimen. The contours of muscle that rippled across his skin, the levels of masculine hair that had sprouted up from his crotch, across his abs, the forest of brown down his bulked thighs the scattering over his chiseled pecs. He couldn&#39;t believe it! He had become literally everything he had ever fantasized about, everything that he had wanted but had resigned himself to never actually achieving.<br />
<br />
And all because of this one thing. This cold medallion that sat squarely in front of his pecs. It was now comparatively smaller since Nathan&#39;s bulk subsumed it. Nathan briefly touched the cold metal before slowly letting his two hands move down his chest to his abs and across the sides of his body and onto his butt. His nerves felt so much more sensitive, so much more tantalizing, it was like he could feel with more subtlety than he ever could have imagined. He turned to look at his ass as he realized it had become just as toned as tanned as the rest of his body. A dual rock hard bubble had replaced the flab that he used to own. His ass and his shaped quads competed with even the most fit of running backs either at his school or in the pros. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy fuck!&quot; he whispered, spacing his feet apart and continuing to check himself out. He noticed his feet had left a charred imprint on the poured concrete in the locker room floor. His transformation literally burnt the floor. He brought his attention to his dick, a thick, long, beer bottle sized penis that rested so peacefully against his heavy, egg-sized balls. He shivered as he ran his hand across it, realizing that the thing could barely be contained by both of his hands, lunging in weight and girth. But then he quickly remembered the audience that was standing in front of him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; a voice said, Nathan looked up and curled his lips. <br />
<br />
He had forgotten that Craig was standing in front of him, he and the other bullies transfixed on what Nathan had become. It was then that Nathan realized that Craig didn&#39;t even know that was actually him who had transformed! <br />
<br />
&quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot; Craig whispered, trying to sound authoritative but also hypnotized by the perfect specimen standing before him. <br />
<br />
Nathan raised his head further with a wicked smile. As he turned his head, Nathan realized that he could pry open and read Craig&#39;s mind like a book. Craig thought he was just some new student, and despite his attempt to be the Big Jock in the locker room, an innate desire for Craig to be the socially dominate one despite this new jock being in every way superior to Nathan, Nathan could tell that he, as well as Chris and Cameron, was mesmerized by the adonis standing in front of him. <br />
<br />
Nathan pivoted his body from the profile stance that he had to facing them completely. He took a slow step forward toward the jocks. <br />
<br />
As the jocks got a full view of Nathan, they let out a small gasp. They saw what Nathan knew, that he had become perfected. He had become something more. Some so incredibly powerful that he had ascended above mortality. He looked back at the three bullies who had tormented him for so long, and how he finally held the upper hand to them. Not just to them, to every other human on the planet! <br />
<br />
He reflected for a moment that this must have been the single best situation, the single best outcome and the single best place that he had ever been in. These three bullies looking on and intimidated by him! Nathan, now this all-powerful being, completely naked and revealed and proud and attractive and intimidating and present in such a way that he could do anything his imagination would allow him to, and the men in front of him had to bear witness! He couldn&#39;t have imagined a single better circumstance to be in than the one he was in now, and -- best of all, Nathan, thought -- being in his one, true, naked form coursing with the powers he had inherited had made it all the more exciting and pleasurable. <br />
<br />
A sudden urge within him shuddered and he impulsively decided to do something that he never would have imagined doing as a human. But something erupted within him so direly, so dark, so immediate, that he made the decision and made the move without an inkling of a second thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hah!&quot; he shouted and flipped his right arm upward, as he did, he snapped his thumb and forefinger, and a short spark of blue electricity snapped out of his hand and stretched across the locker room and hit Craig. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!&quot; Craig shouted. The electric bolt grew quickly around his body and engulfed him. All in about four seconds, the bolt scattered into a rapid, wounding, tornado of electricity around his body, the bolts knocked off then disintegrated Craig&#39;s towel, leaving him naked, then quickly picked the jock up, as it did, the power dissolved him of his muscle. Every bit of the football jock’s physique shrunk into nothing. Even the masculine hairline that he had on his chest, and the forest of pubes that he had on his adonis incinerated. Immediately after, Craig gasped, made a chocking sound and went limp as the electricity picked up his body and mummified him into a gray, dehydrated husk. The body of the jock went limp as it was eaten by an energy as ferocious as anything anyone would have ever imagined. As the husk shriveled down into a skeleton, the electricity consumed it into a tornado of dirt and dust. The dust itself then faded into a blue glow of energy, and that energy swirled into a wave of blue about 2 meters long and traveled back to Nathan, wrapping around him and then diving into his body. <br />
<br />
Nathan took a deep breath as he inhaled Craig&#39;s lifeforce. All within mere moments, before Nathan even had a moment to regret that he might have actually killed someone, did he realize that he just took the body of his bully and ordered it to flow into his own. Nathan had stolen, possessed, taken, the soul of Craig. He owned it. As Craig&#39;s lifeforce flowed into him, Nathan felt his history, his memories, his personality, his skills, and all of his vices and weaknesses. <br />
<br />
Craig was his. <br />
<br />
Nathan&#39;s body shook with a mild orgasm at the moment of possessing his old bully. Upon realizing what had transpired, and the orgasm his body felt upon taking ownership of Craig&#39;s soul, Nathan realized the extent of his new powers. He just took the life of someone, but now owned it completely! He could choose to resurrect Craig, or morph into him, or create a drone of Craig&#39;s body that Nathan would actually control. It was limitless. Nathan couldn&#39;t believe it. <br />
<br />
Nathan threw his hands up and examined them. His eyes widened. &quot;These powers!&quot; he said, chuckling. &quot;It&#39;s like I can do fucking anything!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan then realized as he moved his hands back down that he didn&#39;t care that he just took the life of someone. No. Not this guy, anyway. Not this bully. Nathan could do anything he wanted! The feeling of being transcended and free from the confines of mortality far outweighed the impulse of corruption, even of evil, to reave someone&#39;s soul. “No,” Nathan told himself, this was far more pleasurable. Far more advantageous. Nathan relished it. <br />
<br />
He turned his attention back to the other jocks and smiled at them once more. Nathan chuckled.<br />
<br />
Cameron was the first to speak, tapping Chris on the shoulder. &quot;holy fuck, holy fuck! Chis, we gotta get out of here, let&#39;s go bro, LET&#39;S GO!&quot;<br />
<br />
They backed a few paces away and rounded the corner from the row of lockers where they witnessed their friend literally disappear before their very eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so!&quot; Nathan ordered. &quot;Stop where you are, you fucks!&quot;<br />
<br />
The bullies&#39; feet stopped moving, effectively trapping them. They wanted to move their bodies, but they couldn&#39;t do it. They were stuck!<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back!&quot; Nathan ordered again, and they found their feet obeying Nathan despite their pleas to run. &quot;NO NO NO!&quot; Chris shouted, &quot;Come on, what&#39;s fucking going on?!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two jocks turned their bodies back to their first positions, turning the corner and walking back to face the god before before them as Nathan crossed his arms. <br />
<br />
“Do you know who I am?” He asked with a smirk.<br />
<br />
“Just let us go, please, bro!” Cameron replied. “Come on, bro, we didn’t do anything to you!”<br />
<br />
Nathan chuckled. “Cam, bro, you did every single thing you could possibly do to humiliate me over these last four years.”<br />
<br />
Their eyes widened. They knew who was talking now. <br />
<br />
“Nathan?” Chris asked. “But dude, how, how did you...how did you??”<br />
<br />
“Silence!” Nathan shouted, and both of them felt their mouths close. “I am the one who gets to say shit now. I’m the one in control!”<br />
<br />
Nathan took a few paces toward them as he contemplated his next move. He could hear more showers shut off down the corridor. More of the guys from class were leaving the showers and toweling themselves off in the corridor next to theirs. Soon, they would be filling the rows of lockers as they got dressed for the remainder of classes. <br />
<br />
Nathan smiled, thinking of something particularly humiliating for the rest of the class to see. Something that would tarnish the bullies’ reputations for years. <br />
<br />
“It’s my turn now, you pricks,” he said. “Drop your towels.”<br />
<br />
Chris and Cameron found their left hands each gripping their towels, unhooking, and then throwing them off. Their eyes widened as they saw that their own bodies had obeyed Nathan and forced them to get butt naked in the locker room. They typically wouldn’t care about being nude in the locker room, it was, after all, their playground to be as dominant as they had wished. But they knew that getting naked alone wasn’t the end of it. Nathan was going to do more. They tried to cover their dicks but Nathan held their minds back from being able to do so. <br />
<br />
“Turn to each other, check each other out. I can read your minds, I know each of you think you’re straight, but I know as much as you didn’t want to talk about it, you have both lusted for each other before.” Nathan said. He was exaggerating a little. The jocks did check each other out, but not to what Nathan was making them do now.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, Chris and Cameron each turned to each other. “Get into it,” Nathan commanded. And they followed. <br />
<br />
Through Nathan’s spell, the two jocks slowly grabbed each other’s arms, feeling their bulked biceps and moving down to their forearms. Their nervousness surprisingly washed away from each other as Nathan continued to push the idea that they were attracted to each other, their minds getting warped further as they touched each other. Each of them closed their eyes and kissed passionately. Chris moved his hands up to Cameron’s chest and gently graced his pecs as Cameron moved his hands down to Chris’s groin, across his adonis and then settling over his crotch, cupping then slowly brushing his fingers against Chris’s balls, inspiring them, tightening them against Chris’s body as his dick slowly raised. <br />
<br />
Chris brought his hands to Cameron’s face and pulled him in tighter. His own dick hardening from the pleasure. They made out passionately for a moment as Cameron moved his hands to Chris’s butt and pulled it against him, causing their dicks to smash into each other. “Mmm,” they each said as they fell into each other, lost in their own lust and emotions. <br />
<br />
Cameron fell to his knees and started kissing Chris’s pubes. A couple of pecks before opening his mouth and directing his friend’s dick into it. He would have never thought he would have become overcome with this desire, but in that moment, he wanted nothing more than to have Chris’s essence shoot as hard as it could into his body. <br />
<br />
Chris meanwhile had his knees buckle as a wave of satisfaction flew over him. His body had never felt so alive, so sparked, so sizzling with desire before. He grabbed Cameron’s head and began to rock it, directing it into a rhythm as Cameron moved faster and faster.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Nathan could sense a group of the football jocks working their way down the corridor. These guys were friends with Chris and Cameron, they were going to be in for a shock of a lifetime!<br />
<br />
Nathan turned himself invisible and waited for the fun to begin. A linebacker, Devon, was the first to turn the corner. <br />
<br />
“Holy fuck!” he shouted as two other jocks, Edwin and Frederick, bumped into Devon behind him. “ What the fuck are you two DOING!?”<br />
<br />
Cameron pointed toward the other row of lockers. “Turn the fuck around, Devon! OH!” he said, his attention getting distracted as he felt his balls prep for an explosion, “I need this mother fucker leave us … mmm … leave us alone!”<br />
<br />
But Devon and the other jocks were so in shock that they couldn’t turn. Not at that moment anyway. “Fuck, bro it’s coming, Cameron, keep going, oh FUUUCCKKK!”<br />
<br />
Chris blew and Cameron took it in. He took the first two shoots of cum right away before getting blown back by the third, the spunk missing his mouth and shooting on the floor right between Cameron and Devon’s feet. <br />
<br />
Devon gagged and backed away, the other jocks followed him. <br />
<br />
Satisfied, the invisible Nathan realized that he had gotten the right kind of retribution that he wanted, and released the minds of the bullies. Still, it took them a moment, in their own ecstasy and exhaustion, to come to terms with what all had happened. The look of pleasure and satisfaction in Cameron’s eyes turned to horror and confusion as he realized what he had done. He spat whatever was left in his mouth and wiped with his forearm as he shakingly stood up and caught his weight against the locker behind him. He took one look at Chris, then around to see if their captor was still lingering. Not seeing Nathan, Cameron quickly caught his balance and ran south toward an ancillary locker room where the coaches and visiting teams usually changed. Chris meanwhile, still gasping from his lingering orgasm, knew not what else to do other than to follow him. The jocks ran away as fast as they could, past their other male classmates who were wondering why two sticky, sweaty jocks with full on erections were streaking around the locker room. <br />
<br />
They open, shut, and locked the ancillary men’s locker room. The invisible Nathan followed them and simply phased through the door, watching silently as they came to terms with what had happened. <br />
<br />
“They saw that! Cameron, fuck bro, they saw you sucking me off! What the fuck!” Chris whispered, tears in his eyes. <br />
<br />
“I don’t know, I don’t know!” Cameron replied looking down at his body, trying to swipe of Chris’s spunk and finding its stickiness more and more challenging to remove. “It was Nathan right? How did he do that to us?”<br />
<br />
Before Chris could respond, Nathan made himself visible to the jocks once more. <br />
<br />
“It was retribution, you idiots!” he shouted, a dark, deep, raspy voice exclaimed directly from his mind and into theirs. They turned in total horror to see the naked god before them once again, but this time he floated a foot above the floor and glowed with a red hue and with dark red, shining eyes. <br />
<br />
They backed into the corner and cowered. “Please, please, just leave us alone!” Chris said. <br />
<br />
“Now hear me, and hear me well, mortals!” Nathan shouted, finding that he was having so much fun role playing as a demon type of character, that he basically felt like he was one. Or was channeling one, anyway. “What you did and what your friends saw is part of my retribution. You shall now face the consequences of your public humiliation. You can choose to go to football practice tonight, or not, you can choose to come back to school tomorrow, or not, but this event is now part of you, part of your history, part of your . . . reputation. Heh heh. I did this so that you can feel what it’s like to be a permanent outsider. It’s up to you how you want to spin the story of your little sexcapade, but it will never leave you.”<br />
<br />
Nathan sat his feet back on the ground and subsided his red aura, figuring he could go back to looking like the human he had become. The jocks eyes remained transfixed on him. Nathan turned and felt them strutting his butt toward the locker room door, and then turned around.<br />
<br />
“And don’t think that anyone will believe you for your story if you tell them the truth.” Nathan paused once more. “And besides, if you do try to tell people what happened, what I had become, I’ll give you the same fate as that shithead Craig. So let’s keep that little secret between us.”<br />
<br />
Nathan conjured the jock’s clothing, ordering them to teleport out of their lockers in the men’s locker room and appear in the room where the three of them were now. “Here’s your clothes, get dressed and get the fuck out of here. And don’t think this will be the last that you see of me.”<br />
<br />
With that, Nathan opened the door and walked back into the main locker room. The other men were getting dressed, with the three jocks who had witnessed their friends’ blowjob confusingly trying to get dressed, wondering if what they had witnessed was actually real. <br />
<br />
Nathan went back to his locker and came to a realization: he had the choice to either continue his life as Nathan, but now with this new body, or start a new life under a new alias. “Hmm,” he thought to himself.</p>
