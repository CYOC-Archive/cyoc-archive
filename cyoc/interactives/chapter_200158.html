<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“So Michael (%MC) you looking forward to school? The rules can make highschool rather ‘fun’ if you play your cards right,” Sam asks walking over sitting next to me, “especially gym.” Sam shudders causing her 34D breasts to flop slightly. Jas looks uncomfortable but heads over to the TV area and sits in a nearby chair, still covering her groin but starting to lax on her 28G chest. “So what does that mean Sam? Seems like a juicy story,” Jas said leaning forward and her breasts sway forward.<br />
“I’ll let Michael tell you after school, more fun that way, plus it’ll make you two closer,” Sam said bouncing into to me pulling at my arm that I’m using to cover my penis, “Ah! So you aren’t shaving down there, neither is Grant, though I tell him most women will like it better trimmed, but you also look to have a good 7” semi there, so it may be enough for some girls. Hey Jas, I assume you groom your groin. Despite the amount of nudity at night it’s still considered ‘the norm’ to shave.”<br />
“Jesus Sam, why are you perving my brother? Like I can get the nudity law thing if it’s real but to be that invested?” Jasmine asked standing up angrily showing off her bush. Everyone looked over and I glimpsed at Grant go red in the face and look back at the TV show, I was stunned having not seen my sister naked since I was really little in changing rooms for swimming, and Sam just casually responded with, “ah, unshaven. Also it’s just to help relax you two. Grant is a little perv, look at his boner and how quickly he looked away, your brother is still staring, and damn Jas, it’s just hormonal sex drive… you don’t have to act on it but to pretend that everyone’s not horny or without a sex drive is just lying,” Sam calmy stood up, turned towards me, grabbed my head and made me look at her groin, “I’m unshaven completely btw. Also I’m going to go to the restroom, I’ll be back, and considering it’s going to be really cold outside I’m going to ask if you two would like to stay the night, mom and dad probably already asked your parents.” Sam walked away as I look to Jas who sat back down, either comfortable, or forgetting, she’s nude, no longer covering herself, “I’m down to stay the night, I hate the cold as is,” Jas says staring at the TV show. “I’m down, it’ll be nice to hang with new friends,” I respond looking at the TV.<br />
“Eh I’m calling your slightly lying and just both just don’t want to see naked mom and dad while also seeing naked Sam,” Jasmine scoffs but settles in laying back, her lower back down now sitting off the chair. Grant, I noticed, keeps glancing over at Jas, his face staying red as he shifts in his seat trying to cover his boner. I still feel a boner off of this whole situation and with how Jas is sitting in the chair helped put me over, but I figure if Jas has adapted to a ‘idgaf’ attitude, the only comments are going to be from Sam, so I just sit there an erection in full view, watching TV while sitting between my sister and friend. The front door starts to open as I hear Sam start talking to her parents, she yells for our answer on staying the night, Jas yells back and then Sam heads back towards us as her parents head up to their room. “Alright so you’ll both be in our rooms appropriately when we want to head to bed, and then also an early for your information, it’s 12 hours curse so naked until 8AM. But until then, let’s watch some movies!” Sam said jumping down next to me, her breasts bouncing slightly, “Ah, so you both are already at the ‘screw it, if I’m nude, I’m nude’ attitude, too bad Grant can’t get over that.” Sam reaches over me, so much so her breast grazed my penis, to hit Grant. I shudder slightly as I notice Jas lazily look over and chuckle at what just happened while Sam just turns and winks before joining Jas in a chuckle.<br />
I notice Grant start to change his demeanor and relaxed as the movie progressed, pretty soon everyone was calm and jovial; watching comedy to action movies, and finally when midnight chimed everyone seemed to agree it was time to go to sleep. We grab our clothes off the floor and head to the bedrooms, Jas and Sam head a bit further down the hall and as we all finally adjourn, “Night you two, see you in the morning,” Sam says closing her room’s door. Grant shows me the air matress his parents must have laid out for me, “here are some blankets, and then bathroom is across from Sam’s room.”<br />
The next morning, around 7~ hours later, I wake up and head to the restroom, door was unlocked and I guess I was still groggy enough I didn’t hear the shower on so when I heard Sam’s voice I jumped, “Oh sorry I forgot to lock the door Michael, it must have skipped my mind, but while your here, can you wash my back? I’ll help with yours.” I start to calm down and weigh my options, I decide I may as well take Sam up on her offer, hop in the shower, put body wash on my hands and start on her back. “A little lower please,” Sam requests grabbing my arms and lowering them to just above her ass, “There you go, now here,” she raises my arms up to her upper back, “great, now one last thing before we swap,” she pulls my hands around to cup her breasts forcing me to quickly squeeze then released my hands, “hello sailor, and sorry, had an erotic dream and trying to calm down still.” I notice I brushed her ass crack with my erection and blush, she turns around and turns me around then starts lathering my back. “I won’t say it’s uncommon to have this happen if we become friends because I’m usually really horny, but I promise I won’t force anything,” Sam says as she starts to continue applying body wash across my body, getting into my butt around my legs, up to my testicles and penis, up my chest then arms all the while, “I just always have been I guess growing up here all my life, but I hope it doesn’t scare you, because you and Jasmine are really cool and next door neighbor friends are always amazing.”<br />
“I’m just getting used to this, I don’t mind how horny you are honestly, I just never have been in a scenario like this, where nudity is common place so to know that it’s accepted is kind of relieving,” I respond, “I do have to ask though, considering how open about this you are, have you ever masturbated in front of others and does it feel taboo to do anything in front of your parents?”<br />
“I have, including in front of my parents, but honestly, Grant is the prude of the family, so my sexual premiscuity is also liken to that of my parents, so for friends of mine, it depends on their family dynamic on how open they are to each other, like after last night, it seems like you and Jas wouldn’t mind in front of one another in time, but not having met your parents comepletely, I can’t say.” She finishes washing my body while I just stood there akwardly, then when the water is turned off, she towels the both of us down, her breasts and my penis getting close multiple times over the last few minutes, “Well I’m going to go make sure Jas is awake, and I think it’s about 8 so if you want to get dressed it’ll be soon,” Sam says leaving me in the bathroom. Luckily a boner helps with bladder control, so I finally am able to piss in peace, head back to Grants room where I notice he is putting on his boxers, “Morning Mike, it’s 8 so feel free to dress.”<br />
I put my clothes on and we both head down for breakfast, when Jasmine comes down topless, breasts bouncing about, “I guess either I forgot my top and bra down here or I’m going to kill Sam.”<br />
“It’s over by that chair honey, it was there when I woke up at 6, so unless Sam snuck down early,” Mr. Adams says sipping his coffee at the dining table. Grant and I sit next to him and start chatting about the most recent [sports game here]. Mrs. Adams occasionally chiming in from the kitchen until a minute later when Sam and Jasmine both head down fully dressed and sit for breakfast. “So Michael, Jasmine, last night go alright? It didn’t get too weird, your parents managed to read the rest of the rules with us last night so they finally got around to being fine with it,” Mrs. Adams asks finally plating the last of the food.<br />
“It’s fine, was weird at first, but once the movies started I forgot about it,” Jasmine said starting in on her plate of pancakes. “Same here, Sam made it easier for sure, but a little akward still for sure,” I reply grabbing for a pancake.<br />
“I could imagine,” Mr. Adams says smiling towards me, “I’m sure Sam mentioned that highschool will be fun.”<br />
“Yea, makes me a bit more nervous with it starting next week,” I state, “but at the same time I’m excited.”<br />
“Well Grant will most likely be in your class since it’s a small school for the area with this rulebook,” Mrs. Adams says, “What are you going to do Jasmine? We were told you do online college, the one in the area has room and has great degrees, also the town still has a bunch of local work.”<br />
“I’m transfering in another week, just based off when my current online credits go through for my transcript, and then depending on all that I love nature so any floral shops or the like,” Jasmine responds sitting up once getting to talking about nature with Mrs. Adams, Mr. Adams listening and chiming in since he worked as an apprentace woodworker; leaving Sam, Grant and myself to chat among ourselves.</p>
