<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Prince Jasper manged to escape the town walls without further incident, before the rebels took full control of the city. The only probelm was that the prince had been turned into a lactating woman and she now had in her arms an apparent newborn babe that had formerly being one of the rebel soldiers. The babe had instinctively attached itself to Jasper&#39;s breast, she found the suckling soothing. Indeed her other breast felt that it was bursting. <br />
<br />
Not long after Jasper was outside the city gate she was offered a seat on a wagon by a man. The wagon was loaded with casks. They driver must have taken pity on seeing the young woman with a babe on her breast, fleeing on foot. He looked kind. There was a boy on the wagon as well, driving the oxen. She gratefully accepted realising that her first task was to get as far from the city as she could. Besides she could always call on the amulet to protect her again if necessary. The wagon was one of many fleeing the city.<br />
<br />
Sitting on the wagon she had her first chance to take stock of her situation. <br />
<br />
Anya&#39;s Amulet had worked as Anya had described. It had successfully disguised the former prince. She somehow new that her new name was Jasmine and that the outfit she was wearing signified she was a wet nurse. The badge on her long gown signified that she belonged to the palace staff. No doubt employed to feed one of the many whelps Jasper&#39;s father had sired. Jaspar had over 15 official siblings and half siblings, but he knew there were many more illegitimate half siblings. He really only mixed with his 2 full sisters and the 2 half brothers birthed by his father&#39;s chief concubine - those deemed worthy of being given the title of prince. As the heir to the throne he did not mix with the bastards. Indeed since he had turned 14 he was no longer welcome in father&#39;s harem and now had no idea how many siblings he now had.<br />
<br />
Jaspar took a moment to contemplate the amulet that was around her neck. It bore a crest. It looked like some sort of dragon holding a flag. Jaspar had to admit she did not recognise the crest. As the crown Prince he had not been the most avid scholar. She new nothing about Anya&#39;s family or upbringing only that she was of witch stock and therefore not potential Queen material. She now regretted not asking more questions of her favorite concubine.<br />
<br />
Anya&#39;s accent suggested she came from the Eastern Hills and to have a crest meant that Anya&#39;s family had to be noble stock. Jaspar knew of a book in the palace library that listed the family crests of the kingdom, but that was now on the other side of the gate. Jaspar looked back towards the city and recognised the glow of burning buildings. The city was no longer a good place to be.<br />
<br />
What Jaspar did recognise was that she had left through the West gate. They were heading west. Away from the city but also most likely away from Anya&#39;s family. That was where Anya would go and Jaspar needed to find Anya in order to regain his male body. She would need to head east but not tonight. The glow from the city was getting brighter.<br />
<br />
&#39;Are you a wet nurse?&#39; Jaspar was taken from her musings by a man talking to her. He looked like a merchant, certainly not a noble. It was the man who had offered her a ride. Jaspar did not know him.<br />
<br />
&#39;Who me?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Of course I meant you. Who else could I be talking to? You wear the garb of a palace nurse. Is that one of the King&#39;s progeny?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Huh?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh dear you are a dull one! I ask if that is a little prince or princess on your breast?&#39; If so you must hide it. I have just heard the town ahead has also fallen. We must go to the rebels and ask for clemency&#39;<br />
<br />
Jaspar finally knew what the man was talking about. She thought about the rebel that the amulet had turned into the baby in her arms. &#39;No, this babe has no royal blood. Look it has black hair&#39; All the kings progeny had red hair. Jaspar pulled the blanket off the babes head to reveal it&#39;s dark hair.<br />
<br />
&#39;But you yourself have red hair I notice. That is rare outside of the nobility&#39;<br />
<br />
Jaspar felt a moment of panic. She had not had a chance to even look at herself. She did not even know her own hair colour. &#39;I am but a humble nursemaid of peasant stock. The palace employed me because of my hair. They like red headed nurse maids so the the royal babies are not contaminated by tainted milk&#39; Jaspar made that up on the spot. <br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm. I have heard that. So that baby is you own. How old?&#39;<br />
<br />
Jaspar had no idea as to the age of the baby. She guessed &#39;3 months&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Hmm that baby is large for it&#39;s age. You must produce ample milk&#39;<br />
<br />
Jaspar didn&#39;t know how to reply to that. Just then the baby gave a large burp and vomited milk over Jaspar&#39;s bodice. &#39;It seems so&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Yes it does. Get rid of that palace badge. I will see you to safety&#39; Saying that the man removed the broach from Jaspar&#39;s shoulder that signified she was employed by the palace. He flung it into the darkness. &#39;If we a stopped you are a new wet nurse I hired in the city. I am taking you home to care for my infant son. You never worked at the palace. My name is Simon. Address me as Master Simon&#39;</p>
