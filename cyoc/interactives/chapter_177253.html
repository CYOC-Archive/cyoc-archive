<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden worked on Mark’s cock for another ten minutes before the big mean growled and came down his throat. Aiden milked every last drop, moaning around Mark’s cock while the man rubbed his hands appreciatively through Aiden’s hair. Mark stood up to pull himself out of Aiden; his eyes streamed as the giant cock was dragged out of his throat. In one swift motion he brought Aiden to his feet and hoisted him over his shoulder, cave man style.<br />
<br />
“Now, c’mon boy. Let’s get ourselves cleaned up.” He said, slapping Aiden on the ass as he stepped from the room. Aiden found himself giggling and blushing despite himself as he stared down Mark’s broad back and admired his firm, hairy ass from above. Mark put Aiden down on the bathroom countertop and started running the water before swooping back on Aiden and to resume making out with him. Aiden enthusiastically met his lips, snickering a bit as Mark’s thick, coarse beard scratched and tickled Aiden’s smooth face. One of mark’s big fingers began drifted between Aiden’s legs and found his pussy, and together they kissed and fondled like that for another few minutes before the steam alerted them that the shower was definitely ready by now. Mark escorted Aiden into the shower, and the two began to rinse themselves in the steamy, hot water.<br />
<br />
As Aiden ran the water through his short hair, he felt Mark approach behind him, pressing his chest against Aiden’s back and beginning to rub over Aiden’s body with soapy hands. Aiden shampooed his hair while Mark ran his soapy hands across Aiden’s chest and stomach, his arms, and he took extra care to lather and fondle between his legs. <br />
<br />
“I think I’m starting to like having a pussy,” Aiden signed as Mark stooped to run his soapy hands over Aiden’s legs.<br />
<br />
“I’m liking it too,” Mark replied simply, standing back up and turning Aiden around. Before he was about to ask, Aiden grabbed the soap himself and began lathering Mark’s muscular hairy chest. He scrubbed between the man’s huge arms, rubbed his hairy belly and laughing when Mark chuckled and moaned a little bit. The Aiden took up Mark’s cock in his hand and began to lovingly wash and clean it. Mark stared down his massive chest and watched as Aiden gently washed under his foreskin, tickling the head of his cock before lathering his hardening shaft. Aiden tenderly washed and caressed Mark’s giant balls, briefly pausing to appreciate their weight and size. Mark pulled him back up to his chest with a laugh and a peck on the mouth before gently pushing him back under the water to rinse off.<br />
<br />
“So, what’s the plan for tonight, Mark?” Aiden asked when they were toweling themselves down. <br />
<br />
“Please,” Mark purred as he hung the towel up, “Call me Daddy, or Sir.” He said with a smile, admiring his new manly body in the mirror.<br />
<br />
Aiden rolled his eyes. “So, Daddy,” he began, trying to ignore the way his heart fluttered when he said it. “What’s the plan for tonight?” he asked, turning to look in the mirror and examine his own reflection.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna stop by Dillions first, say hi to all the boys,” he rumbled. Dillions was a local bar down town. <br />
<br />
“Isn’t Dillion’s a sports bar? I don’t wanna hang out with your bros all night, not when we’re like this.” Aiden complained. He checked his face in the mirror for zits, stray hairs, anything, but his skin was smooth and unblemished and clearer than it had looked in his life.<br />
<br />
Mark laughed, “Don’t worry, baby. We’ll have no problem fitting in,” He said mysteriously. He looked over to see Aiden bent over the counter, still checking out his face and body in the mirror. He gave Aiden’s ass a hearty smack, causing the boy to yelp and jump up with a giggle.<br />
<br />
“Stop that!” Aiden said in mock-anger.<br />
<br />
“Never,” replied Mark, a roguish smirk parting his beard. “Now go get dressed, and wear something sexy to make your Daddy proud.” He commanded, ruffling Aiden’s hair. Aiden snaked out of his grip and giggled, running off to his room to get dressed. He had a warm feeling in his heart and his pussy as Mark’s command rang through his ears; Aiden opened his closet door and looked around as lots of sordid ideas popped into his head.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mark whistled tunelessly as he walked into the kitchen, fastening a silver, leather-banded wristwatch behind his thick, calloused hand. He was shocked at how thorough the changes he made were; while digging through his closet he had discovered a small collection of harnesses, leather clothing, and a hardware box full of toys, tools, and lubricants that had not been there before. His original clothing was all still there, only thankfully adjusted to match his new towering height and broad frame. He wore a black button-down shirt, the sleeves rolled up around his hulking biceps and several buttons left undone to expose his hairy and powerful chest. He chose a pair of dark jeans that fit somewhat loosely around his legs, but showed off his heavy bulge quite nicely. He clomped over to the liquor cabinet in his heavy black boots, grabbing a bottle of Jack and pouring himself a glass. Before the change Mark was more keen on beer; but now, he found himself craving whiskey, bourbon, maybe even something stronger and harder. And he really wanted a smoke, unconsciously finding his way to the coffee table where a little wooden box rested. He opened it up and was surprised, but also relieved, to find the box full of long, thick cigars; he extracted one, grabbing a little clipper with his other hand. Mark ran the cigar under his nose and gave it an experimental whiff. It was dank, woody, earthy; Mark inhaled the aroma greedily, feeling his cock stir. He clipped the end of the cigar and lit the end with a butane lighter that bore a bear paw mark on both sides. <br />
<br />
Mark leaned back on the couch and puffed on the cigar, shocked that he was enjoying the flavor and the action so much. He’d never been much of a smoker but the cigar was making him feel masculine and sexy. He pulled out his phone to screw around, but then noticed Aiden had stepped into the room and dropped it.<br />
<br />
Aiden had dressed in a tight short-sleeve button down with a blue floral pattern just subtle enough not to be garish. His jeans were also tight, hugging his straight, lithely muscled legs and hugging his firm round ass perfectly. His hair was neatly style, and his face glowed as if he’d put on a little make-up.<br />
<br />
“How do I look, Daddy?” he said innocently, turning to give Mark a view of his perfect round butt.<br />
<br />
Mark put his cigar in the ash tray and padded his thighs with his hands. “Come here, pussyboy, and I’ll show you.” He growled with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Aiden eagerly crossed the room and hoisted himself into his Daddy’s lap, resting his crotch on the growing bulge in Mark’s pants. <br />
<br />
“You look perfect,” he said, taking Aiden’s ass in both hands and giving him a deep, hard kiss on his soft lips. He gave Aiden’s ass another slap. “Now lets get going, boy, before I lose control and drag you back to the bedroom.” Aiden found himself wishing that would happen as he got up off of Mark. The big man stood up and adjusted himself, and Aiden laughed and pointed at the obscene sight of Mark’s giant schlong snaking down the length of his jeans and the bulge of his massive balls.<br />
<br />
“The bar isn’t checking for deadly weapons, is it, Sir?” Aiden teased. <br />
<br />
Mark looked down and chuckled. “Oh, right.” He concentrated, and the outline of his cock seemed to retreat as his cock and balls softened and shrank ever so slightly to make a neat, heavy strain against the front of Mark’s pants. “Just enough to let it show.” He said. He took one final puff on his cigar, pocketing a few fresh ones, and grabbed his keys.<br />
<br />
Aiden headed for the door, Mark hot behind him with his hand possessively on his bum. Door locked, they headed for the car; Aiden was looking for Mark’s mustang, but Daddy’s booming voice called out and he turned to see Mark standing by the open door of a big pick-up truck. Mark helped him clamber inside with a hand on his ass before stepping in himself, the truck shaking a bit as he settled his weight in the seat.<br />
<br />
“What happened to your mustang, Daddy?” Aiden asked, admiring the interior.<br />
<br />
“Don’t know, baby,” he said, started the truck. “These were the only keys I had in my pocket.”<br />
<br />
Aiden admired the sight of Mark’s massive frame in the bucket seat, a meaty arm draped casually over the steering wheel as he pulled out into the street and said, “I’m not complaining.”<br />
<br />
The bar was only a few minutes from their apartment. The town they lived in was a little removed from the city proper, but it had a good night life in its own right. The truck came to a stop at a traffic light and Aiden noticed something different about the corner beside them.<br />
<br />
“Hey, there’s a pride flag over the mini-mart!” Aiden said, grabbing Mark’s attention. “The guy who owns that place literally called me a ‘fag’ one time. When did that happen?”<br />
<br />
“He’s probably a lot more open-minded now,” snickered Mark. The light turned green and they turned down Main Street, driving a few more blocks before coming to a parallel stop beside the familiar brick-and-mortar building of the town watering hole, Dillions.  As Aiden stepped out of the truck he was surprised to see a new assortment of flags flying over the establishment: the Pride Flag, the Bear Pride Flag, and the Trans Pride flag all flew over the front of the building, alongside the actual Bear Flag of Aiden’s home state. <br />
<br />
“What the hell?” He wondered aloud. Mark had come around the car and taken his small hand in his big paw. <br />
<br />
“Just wait until you see the inside.” Mark muttered, leading him up to the front door.<br />
<br />
Opening the door, Aiden was shocked to see the bar was packed with a crowd of raucous, cheery men of all kinds and builds. Dillions had been getting pretty wild with the themed-nights lately, but this was no Triangle Night: this place had become a full-on gay bar. There wasn’t a woman in sight, not even a Hag. Only an even mix of big, hairy, burly Men like mark and more petite, slender, and less hairy men like Aiden. A pack of waiters scurried around taking orders and delivering drinks; they were all slim men wearing tight jeans or shorts and skimpy tank tops. Mark took him up to the bar, which was manned by a pair of big, beefy men that looked vaguely familiar to him.<br />
<br />
They sat down and the taller of the two bartenders greeted them with a bushy, bearded smile and a couple of coasters.<br />
<br />
“Mark, what’s up, my man!” he exclaimed in a deep bass, reaching over to clasp marks paw with his own. “Taking your boy out on the town. Looking sexy tonight, Aiden.” He said, winking at him. Suddenly, Aiden remembered who he was: Patrick, the owner of the bar!<br />
<br />
“What can I get for you, sweet thing?” he asked, rubbing his hand over his hulking gut. Pat had been a big guy before, but now he was thick and hairy all over. His beard touched his chest, and his thick, black hair was sleeked back over his head.<br />
<br />
“Um, tequila, on the rocks,” he muttered, and Mark clapped him on the back with pride for his boy.<br />
<br />
“White or dark?” Pat queried. <br />
<br />
“What am I, an asshole?” Aiden snapped back with snark in his voice.<br />
<br />
“I’ll have a Jack. Neat.” Mark rumbled. <br />
<br />
They took their drinks and sipped in silence for a moment, Aiden taking in the scene. He looked at the other man staffing the bar; unlike Pat, this man’s had little body fat to speak of, his muscles hard and clearly defined. His black hair was shaved close, his beard slightly shorter, but Aiden finally started to recognize him as Pat’s brother and the co-owner, Richard. Rick gave him a wink as he poured a colorful cocktail for a slim, platinum blond who was giving the man ‘fuck me’ eyes. <br />
<br />
“So, what did you do?” Aiden finally asked, feeling Mark settle his hand on the small of Aiden’s back. <br />
<br />
Mark chuckled and took another sip of his drink. “I may have made some modifications to our town’s population.” He said, finishing his drink and flagging Pat down for another. “Long story short, for the time being there’s basically only men like me,” he grabbed his bulge, “And boys like you.” He finished. His hand reached lower to slip into Aiden’s pants and caress his ass. <br />
<br />
“You little slut!” he chortled, “You’re not wearing underwear.”<br />
<br />
Aiden blushed and smiled. “You said dress sexy. Daddy.” Mark leaned in and Aiden met him for a strong kiss.<br />
<br />
“Wait, did you change the whole world?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh no. Just the town.”<br />
<br />
“For how long?”<br />
<br />
“For as long as we want. The program makes it so that everyone but us thinks this is just life now.”<br />
<br />
“They all think living in the only “All American City” in the country populated entirely by gay bears and pussified men is just life as usual?” Aiden said, slamming down his drink.<br />
<br />
“Yup.” Said mark contendedly.<br />
<br />
“Wow. Well, God bless computer science. Hey, Pat!”<br />
<br />
They sat there at the bar, enjoying drinks and light conversation while people watching. Aiden recognized a lot of the people at the bar, it being a small town and all, and he was shocked and aroused by how they had changed under Mark’s new adjustments. It seemed like all of the men who were above a certain height and weight had been promoted to some variation of a hirsute, dominant gay man. The other men who were below that threshold seemed to have been modified the way Aiden’s body was. He didn’t know what happened to the women; maybe they had been changed into different men too to fit the pattern. <br />
<br />
Soon it had gotten late, and Aiden was thoroughly and comfortably drunk; to his chagrin he found that his coordination or his stomach integrity wasn’t strongly affected. Mark must have upped his alcohol tolerance as well; although certainly not his bladder volume.<br />
<br />
“I gotta use the bathroom.” Aiden said, excusing himself.<br />
<br />
“Have fun,” mark chortled, turning in his chair to admire his boy’s ass as he walked away. <br />
<br />
Pat slid over to him and poured him another whiskey. “You boys look fine together.” He commented, leaving the bottle on the bar.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, bro.” Mark raised his glass. A new memory came to him, and he asked, “You still getting it from that twink friend of his? Charlie?”<br />
<br />
The big man shook his shaggy head. “Naw, man. He’s going up state for college soon. We broke it off. He promised me he’d ride my cock one last time before he leaves though.” He grinned and snuck himself a quick shot of whiskey.<br />
<br />
“Shame.”<br />
<br />
Pat shrugged. “There’s some good-looking boys here tonight. Besides, it’ll be 11 soon. That’s when the show starts.” He licked his lips and fondled the growing bulge beneath his massive belly. “You two sticking around for the fun?”  he asked, excitement in his eyes.<br />
<br />
Mark himself wasn’t too clear on what the big man meant, but he was intrigued, so he played along. “Absolutely. Aiden’s been excited about it all day.” <br />
<br />
Pat smiled. “You’re a lucky man, to have a sweet thing like that warming you bed every night.” He complimented.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I know it.” Mark replied, with a smile and a swig of whiskey.</p>
