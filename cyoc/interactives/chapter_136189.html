<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Claw Coliseum&#39;s gym was a pretty popular place to go work out. Even those who weren&#39;t signed up for the A-BC were hitting the gym on a regular basis. It was a bit odd how those who previously had no incline towards exercise before, whether human or animal, now make it a daily event when they can. Some of the Horizon scientists hypothesize that since what became the Animalian virus was partially derived from a strain meant to deal with muscle dysthropy, it instilled a subliminal urge to stay in good shape in Animalians. But it wasn&#39;t something to be discouraged anyways.<br />
<br />
Marvin and Stuart had been coming to the gym regularly since they converted into dogs. Part of the reason was to keep in shape and another part is to keep on the lookout for any dog ladies who might be coming to the gym. Since one of the poodle pair was already taken, the two of them had been looking for another female dog they&#39;d be interested in.<br />
<br />
Marvin was currently working on the bench press with Stuart spotting him. Though Marvin was a Welsh Corgi, he wasn&#39;t puny by human standards. Though he did a pale a bit in comparison with Stuart, considering he was a Great Dane. &quot;Ok, give me five more reps,&quot; said Stuart, &quot;The ladies love a man with a broad chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this the actual exercise that makes a broad chest?&quot; asked Marvin skeptically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you need to have any angle covered in case you meet a- Holy cow!&quot; said Stuart, looking towards the door.<br />
<br />
Marvin managed to put the barbell back on its rack and sat up to look. He was partially expecting Stuart to have seen an actual cow. Marvin wouldn&#39;t deny that the cow Animalians were pretty sexy, especially with their big breasts. Even if they were mostly Belgian Blues and were bred more for muscle than milk, their anthro forms were incredibly sexy amazonian builds.<br />
<br />
The lady in question wasn&#39;t a Belgian Blue Animalian, but she could have been mistaken one from a distance. But from a closer range, it was obvious she was a dog Animalian, a Doberman Pinscher to be precise. Though she was much bigger than the other Dobermans that Marvin and Stuart have seen, even Beth. She was as proportionally muscular as the cow Animalians, though not quite as tall. She was as tall as Stuart, which was still pretty big for a dog. Her breasts were also not as big as the cows&#39;, though they were by no means tiny. They looked more proportionate to her frame than the udders that the milk cows had. She also lacked traces so she as an uplifted animal instead of a converted human. And considering she was wearing a sports bra and gym shorts, she must be here to exercise.<br />
<br />
Marvin and Stuart quickly left the bench and walked over to the Doberman. &quot;Hi, you must be new around here,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did join pretty recently,&quot; said the Doberman.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did we,&quot; said Marvin, &quot;I&#39;m Marvin.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The name&#39;s Stuart,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;My owners named me Cammy,&quot; said the Doberman.<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did they have you uplifted?&quot; asked Stuart, &quot;Old age or cancer?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was in good shape, well too-good shape,&quot; said Cammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too good?&quot; asked Marvin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had some sort of genetic disorder,&quot; said Cammy, &quot;I&#39;m not even sure what it&#39;s called. It&#39;s like the opposite of muscle disthropy. It made my muscles huge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound too bad,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;It does if it starts to put a strain on your heart,&quot; said Cammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;d never thought of that,&quot; said Marvin.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was only two years old, so my owners didn&#39;t want me to die yet. They took me to sign me up for Project Phoenix. I think my change surprised everyone,&quot; said Cammy.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Doberman Pinschers had a reputation for being aggressive dogs. They were certainly intimidating to look at. And Cammy, being much more muscled than a Doberman usually gets, could appear pretty scary for those who didn&#39;t know her. However, Cammy had been raised by caring owners who got her used to other people and she was really very sweet. But it was really heartbreaking how her heart was having trouble keeping up with her huge body.<br />
<br />
Cammy followed the scientist into the testing room. He seemed nice and he scratched her ears the way she liked. When he set down the water bowl, Cammy started lapping it up without any hesitation. She didn&#39;t pay attention when the scientist left the room. As Cammy drank the water, she was aware of a weird tingling on her tongue and down her throat. Pretty soon, that tingling spread to the rest of her body. Then she started feeling sore and achy.<br />
<br />
From the observation room, they were able to watch Cammy transform. They had seen plenty of dogs been uplifted to know what to expect. The front paws stretched out into working hands that were soon gripping the table as she stood up onto her lengthening hind legs. Her body was filling out into a humanoid shape, her extra teats disappearing while one pair inflated into breasts. But what they weren&#39;t expecting was how her muscles were also swelling in size. They expected her to be the same body type as other uplifted dogs, though probably more buff. But she was surpassing the muscle size of her species as well as the height. The height she grew to didn&#39;t surpass the largest of dogs, but she was well-above the usual uplifted Doberman.<br />
<br />
Cammy look at her transformed body. Her muscles had been very large as a normal dog, but now she was titanic. In the reflective glass of the observation mirror, she could see she was built like a human, but much bigger than any human she had seen. The very thick muscles of her arms and legs look like she could snap tree branches with little effort and her torso was sculpted into fine detail. But her femininity was not forgotten. Her hips were pleasingly wide and her ass, though as muscled as the rest of her, had just enough padding to not look flat. Cammy cupped her breasts, which easily filled her new hands and more. &quot;Wow, I&#39;m huge,&quot; she said, not particularly surprised by her new voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not the first words we usually get out of uplifted Animalians, but rather appropriate in your case,&quot; said a scientist behind the glass.<br />
<br />
Cammy tilted her head and asked, &quot;Animalians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transformed animals and humans who co-exist in a peaceful society,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;A society you can be a part of.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the other Animalians as big as me?&quot; asked Cammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes and no,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;You are very big for your type, but there are other species that are just as big or even bigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When can I meet them?&quot; asked Cammy, wagging her stumpy tail.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;And after I had my introduction classes, I was able to find work pretty easily,&quot; said Cammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing what?&quot; asked Marvin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Being a mover,&quot; said Cammy, &quot;I&#39;m strong enough and I&#39;m just short enough to get where stronger Animalians can&#39;t. The problem is I kinda break a few things by accident.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having trouble controlling your strength? Don&#39;t worry. Everyone has to adjust to it,&quot; said Stuart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, knowing how much I can lift will probably help me figure out how to control it,&quot; said Cammy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I can help you out with that,&quot; said Stuart before leading Cammy to the weights.<br />
<br />
Marvin could see that Stuart was really attracted to Cammy already. Not that he could blame him, she was a total muscle babe and she seemed pretty nice too. Marvin ought to feel a little annoyed hat Stuart was making the first movie with Cammy. On the other hand, that means Stuart would be less interested in Princess and Marvin would have less competition. That seemed like a pretty good deal to him.</p>
