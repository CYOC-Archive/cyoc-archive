<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“This is stupid. I feel stupid,” Victor muttered to himself as he struggled to pull on the nylon body suit.<br />
<br />
	It had been Pru’s idea. When they’d started talking about what they would do for hallowe’en, neither could decide, except that maybe they go to a couple parties. After bouncing suggestions off each other, Vic had settled the matter by declaring, “Why don’t you decided what we should go as,” which his wife happily agreed to.<br />
<br />
	But now he was regretting that decision as he continued to wiggled into part of the costume she’d suggested a couple weeks ago. When she’d first proposed the idea, he’d thought it had been funny that maybe they could go as a prom couple, with him dressed as the girl and she as the guy. He hadn’t known fully what she had intended, and was now kicking himself for not only not asking, but also agreeing, as he soon found out it would be more than him simply putting on a skirt and pretending to be a girl.<br />
<br />
	Rather, Pru had insisted he go all the way. Which meant he first needed to shave off all his body hair, then shower and bath using her stuff. Next, naked and smelling strongly like a girl, he had to sit patiently as his wife had applied a skull cap over his hair, a wig of real human hair that came down to the midpoint of his back and padding on his face, hips, and butt to give him a rounder, feminine look. In addition to this, she affixed to his chest two fake breasts that she assured him would fill a B cup, and finally a gaff. Feeling ridiculous about the whole thing, especially as the gaff, which looked like female genitalia, came with a catheter that would allow him to pee whilst wearing it, he’d then started to put on the rest of the costume she’d gotten him.<br />
<br />
	The first was the nylon body suit he now struggled with. It was a garment he hadn’t even been aware existed, and was at a loss to explain why anyone would wear a thing. Finally getting it on, he found it covered him from the neck down to his feet, hid that his breasts were fake, the nipples on them caused the body suit to poke outward in that area, had sleeves that covered his arms, and made them appear slimmer, and partially covered his hands with a piece that fit betwixt his middle and ring finger. When he found it was open in the crotch, it took him a moment to figure out this was so that a girl could pee whilst wearing it as he pulled his hair free and he gazed into the full body mirror his wife kept in their bedroom. Unsure how he should feel when he saw not his usual reflection, but a girl looking back at him, he found himself going back to his previous comment of things being stupid as he reached for the dress Pru had gotten him.<br />
<br />
	As he’d never worn a dress before, he wasn’t sure if he should step into it, or pull it on over his head. Wishing his wife would hurry up, he decided, “Fuck it,” as he stepped into it and pulled it up<br />
<br />
	The black garment feeling soft and looking shimmery, Vic took a moment to adjust it, as his wife said he might have to. When he was confident it was on okay, he zipped up the hidden zippers on the side and affixed the hidden hook and eyes on the front. The bodice now pulled tight around his torso, he grimaced as he glanced into the mirror and stared at his reflection. Noting the lower part, which was ruffled, tiered and ballooned out, came down just a little past his knees, whilst the top sat low in back, only came up in front high enough to cover the front of her breasts, left the top exposed, he was a loss how to react when he saw that how tight it was made the breasts look fuller and that it gave him a look of having a cleavage.<br />
<br />
	Unable to stop himself, Victor thought, “Damn. I do look good,” as from the door to their bedroom, Pru’s voice told him, “You look very pretty.”<br />
<br />
	Suddenly embarrassed, Vic shifted about in place, unable to think of what to say. Turning to face his wife, he stopped when he found himself looking at a complete stranger. Gone where her usual feminine traits, replaced by the sharp angular appearances of a guy in a very good looking dark blue suit. Wondering how she had gotten her chest so flat and if she’d cut her hair or if she was wearing a wig, he never got the chance to ask as his wife bid him to sit down at her vanity. Doing as she requested, he sat still as she teased the wig he had on into a plait that that went up the back of his head, with a single lock hanging down alongside his face. Finished with that by adding some pearls and hair pins, she had him close his eyes as she applied make-up. Afterward, she spritzed him with perfume, helped him put on a pair of high heels that added two inches height and had straps to support his ankles.<br />
<br />
	Worried he’d be taller than her, he slowly stood, and was amazed to find that, with the shoes she had on, she was actually taller than he was. Nervous, he whispered, “I don’t know if I can do this.”<br />
<br />
	A smile on her face, Pru drew him closer. And in her best impersonation of guy, she told him, “Babe. You look beautiful,” before she helped him walk back and forth across the room a couple times in an effort to help him get used to moving in heels, something he found would take some getting used to, before they left.<br />
<br />
	The first party they hit turned out to be a bust. Most of the people only seemed interested in drugs, whilst the booze being served was subpar and on level with something that would have been brewed in a questionable bathtub. The next one, set up in an old school gymnasium that had been converted into a dance club, was better, and they decided to stick around for a while. A buffet style table set up to one side provided refreshments that ranged from various foods and drinks, and they soon took to helping themselves regularly along with the other partygoers. When they took to the floor, Victor soon forget about what he had on as Pru led in a slow dance.<br />
<br />
	When the most current song they’d been dancing to ended, Pru said, “I’m going to get myself something to drink. Should be stick around a bit longer? Or try another party?”<br />
<br />
	“Let’s stick around,” Vic immediately replied as he followed his wife toward the buffet.<br />
<br />
	It was almost as if it had waited for these two specific people. Somehow ending up affixed amongst the decorations that ran along the edge of one of the long tables, the Amulet of Zulo was missed by hundreds of people dressed in various costumes as they sampled from the tables. A plate in hand, Pru threaded her way through the packed crowd as she moved along the queue. When she spotted a cup of something she wanted, she reached for, almost dropped her plate, listened as her husband, who was right behind, ask if she wanted him to grab it, and setting down her food, she placed one hand flat on the table, and reached with her other.<br />
<br />
	The cuff of her suit coat brushed against her hand and as she leaned forward, she put her full weight down in order to grab the drink. Something brushed against the coarse fabric and her hand, and she yelped when she felt a prick of something. Several people looked in her direction, whilst Victor leaned closer. Worried his wife might have brushed against one of the hotplates, he inquired, “Are you all right?” as his wife raised her hand and looked at it.<br />
<br />
	“I think there is a loose nail or something,” Pru said after a moment.<br />
<br />
	Concerned his wife might have stabbed herself, Vic peered at her hand, but didn’t see blood or any sign the flesh had been broken. Reaching past her, he started to ask, “Are you sure,” but didn’t finish when something snagged on the nylon that partly covered his hand, he could feel something metallic come in contact with the bare flesh, and then there was a sharp stabbing, almost as if he’d set his hand down on a nail. Yanking back his hand, he cursed as he accidentally pulled one of the decorations off the table.<br />
<br />
	“Someone didn’t attach something properly,” Vic objected as he shook loose the thing stuck to the nylon and watched it drop to the table, bounce to the floor, and roll under the table.<br />
<br />
	Next to him, Pru found herself over come with dizziness. Not concerned with the state of the decorations, she set her plate down and said, “Will you excuse me?”<br />
<br />
	Victor, who hadn’t heard what his wife had said, was too busy staring at his hand. After a moment, he lowered it, leaned forward, and as Pru pushed her way toward the bathrooms, he placed his hands flat on the table and squeezed his eyes shut. Suddenly overcome with a queasy sensation, he pushed away from the buffet. The magick already coursing him, using what was available, converting the silicon padding to actual flesh, starting to work on the fake breasts and turn them into real ones, Vic excused himself as he hurried past party goers and toward the bathrooms. Arriving just as his age dropped from twenty-eight down to seventeen, he didn’t give it a second thought when he rushed into the woman’s bathroom.<br />
<br />
	In the men’s room, Pru rushed into the nearest stall. Missing that she’d run into the wrong bathroom, she hurried to undo her belt and slacks. Pushing them down to her knees, she sat down on the toilet, sure that she was about to have the squirts. As she sat there, waiting to see what her body would do, her genitals began to twist, morph, and push outward. Her vulva fusing together, she grimaced at the discomfort in her abdomen as her ovaries descended and filled the fleshy sack. Dizziness washed over her again and as she breathed heavily, Pru leaned to her right and rested the side of her head against the cool metal of the stall partition, missing as her urethra, clitoris and clitoris hood merged into a thin, pink-white shaft, her height jumped up to five foot eleven, and her weight increased by forty some pounds.<br />
<br />
	His wig and skull cap had fused together, but Victor didn’t know this, nor that it had become his actual hair, as he pushed his way into one of the stalls. Stopping, he took a moment to try and figure out what he should do, before he lifted up the skirt part of the dress and sat down. No longer feeling like he’d puke, he grimaced at the discomfort in his abdomen that went down into his groin. The magick continuing to work, the gaff he had on split at the back and morphed into real flesh as it absorbed Victor’s dick and balls. The now seventeen year old girl’s body become more and more sure it was female, Vic hugged himself and leaned forward as something inside him felt like it popped.<br />
<br />
	Uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries formed, and with a suddenness that cause him to come over nauseous, his body stopped producing testosterone and switched to oestrogen and progesterone. Suddenly aware that something wasn’t right, it took him a moment before he realised he could feel the silky nylon against his breasts. Sitting up, he whispered, “What the…” as he cupped the two round orbs of flesh, squeezed them gently, pushed them one way, then another, and stopped when he saw his hand.<br />
<br />
	Small, dainty, feminine, he noted that his fingernails now were done up and came to a point. No longer feeling like he would need to pee, or be sick, Vic leapt up, started to take a step, but stopped when he became aware of how the nylon body suit rubbed against the area betwixt his legs. Reaching down and up the dress, he eased two fingers between his legs, and feeling the warm flesh, he shuddered at the touch as his fingers brushed against his sensitive clit.<br />
<br />
	“It’s not real. It’s not real,” Pru told herself as she held her erect shaft and again ran a hand that was larger than it usually was.<br />
<br />
	Having become aware of her Neo-privates only moments ago, she was alarmed and fascinated. When she had gotten over her shock, and reach down to touch her penis, she shivered at how realistic it felt and before she could change her mind, she’d grasped it as best as she could and ran her hand up and down it until it started to get hard.<br />
<br />
	Suddenly aware of what she was doing, what she held, Pru pulled her hand away from it. Staring down at it, the now seventeen year old boy, was at a loss to figure out how he’d gone from being a girl to being a boy. Scared, especially as it seemed so right to believe he was a guy, Pru leapt up, pulled his pants up and nearly ran from the bathroom, where he almost collided with his former husband.<br />
<br />
	Vic in almost tears, the new hormones sending her body on a wild rollercoaster ride, stopped when she saw Pru. Thinking her wife looked even more like a guy, she babbled out, “Something’s wrong,” as Pru said, “There’s something wrong.”<br />
<br />
	The two stopped the moment each realised what the other had said and suddenly feeling like she needed to be comforted, Vic hugged herself and said, “I don’t know how it’s possible, but I’ve become a girl,” whilst Pru took a step closer and fumbled a bit before stating, “It’s like this. I’m no longer a girl. I’m a guy,” before he blurted out, “I have a dick. I’m not supposed to have one of those…I think.”<br />
<br />
	Again, the two stopped the instant it clicked what the other had said, and after a moment, Vic asked, “What the hell is going on? What are we going to do”<br />
<br />
	“I don’t know,” Pru replied and before he could say anything else, Vic hugged him and whispered, “This is so fucked up. I don’t want to be a girl. It doesn’t feel right,” and aware how upset the boy-turned-girl was, Pru hugged her back, kenning that Vic’s height had shrunk by eight inches and she was now five foot one.<br />
<br />
	For some time, the two remained where they were before Vic sniffed, “I want to go home, slip into some comfortable pyjamas, curl up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn, drift off as I watch a movie, and forget this whole thing as I hope that, in the morning, I’ll wake up my old self,” and wanting to point out how feminine the girl’s comment was, Pru instead kept it to himself as he instead, “Do you want some company?” to which Vic nodded, told him, “Uh huh,” and, “Thank you,” as they held each other whilst they made there way around the edge of the dance floor<br />
<br />
	Each losing themselves to the sex and gender they’d become, the two seventeen year olds exited the club and headed back to what had once been their house, but was now the home of Pru’s parents. It wouldn’t be until the next morning they would each discover how much their lives had changed. But the one thing neither would figure out was how they had switched sex and gender to become a two teenagers in their third year of high school.<br />
<br />
	Under the table, the Amulet of Zulo remained for a moment longer, almost as if it waited to see if the two would figure it out right away and come back for it, or if someone else would find it. And when Pru and Victor, now Nate and Breanna, left the club, and no one else discovered it, it disappeared.</p>
