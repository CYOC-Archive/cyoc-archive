<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The garage door closes as the three of you finish parking your bikes. You watch as Candy and Muffin unzip each other and slowly peel the super tight suits off. Your lusty stare does not go unnoticed, as Muffin drags out the show, giving you both frequent jiggles of her breasts, butt, and thighs. Candy comes over and gives you a kiss on the cheek as you watch the two naked human females walk into the house, quickly transforming back into their anthro-otteress forms. You follow them into the sofa in the den, where you all sit down facing each other.<br />
<br />
Muffin asks you, &quot;Have you thought anymore about what you would like next?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, &quot;I like how I look. I feel fantastic, and this suit keeps all the jiggly bits in place. That said, I think I would like my gentleman bits back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy asks you, &quot;If you join us, you can have both. That is if your interested. Do you know what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
You ask the two, &quot;Would I be a river otter like you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin nods, &quot;Yes, your base form would match ours, but that would be when your current body expires. In the meantime, your base form is what you choose., with our help. It will take a while for you to learn and control. That&#39;s why your joining us, and not flying solo on this. You need to be sure, as it gets harder to stop and go back once you are on the path.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at Candy and then Muffin, &quot;If you will have me, I accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;Are you alright with not having your man parts for awhile?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How long?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Muffin takes that answer, &quot;Until you learn to make them yourself. That can be a few years. That is one of the rules I found works best. Is that going to be a problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
Today was a good day. You love how you feel and how you look. You embody the essence of young, sensual, curvy, and athletic. The idea of craving to be filled with an engorged penis is not repulsive, but makes you slick between your legs. The idea of going back to your old self is not exciting, as you have already done that. You ended up as an accountant living alone in a house you don&#39;t own. You can revisit the whole living as a man thing later. While you ponder you answer to Muffin&#39;s question, Candy looks at you, waving her otter hand.<br />
<br />
Candy adds, &quot;My friend here and I have one more complication to this mix...life as you know it will change. Going to work is boring. We take a great pride in finding those in need of a change, and giving them a real change. For instance, your lunch friend&#39;s sudden weight loss. Reality doesn&#39;t change for those deeds, as we enjoy the drama of it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hence the playful river otter, or should I say mischievous,&quot; you remark.<br />
<br />
Muffin adds, &quot;Your not wrong about that. So, is that a problem or are you fully committed?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod yes, &quot;Fully committed. So, what next, some sacred ceremony or initiation ritual?&quot;<br />
<br />
Muffin smiles and shakes here head no, &quot;Nothing like that. At some point you will give birth to flesh forms for Candy and I, but your acceptance just furthers you down a path that started when you bought our figurines at the store. It&#39;s just now a lot harder to go back.&quot;<br />
<br />
The firmness of the suit supporting your large breasts, and the snugness compressing your thighs, your body is built to enjoy. There is no going back from this, and that give you a sense of excitement.<br />
<br />
Muffin gets up and sits next to you on the sofa, then reaches her arm around you in an embrace, and is absorbed by your body.<br />
<br />
Candy give a brief chuckle, &quot;She likes you. You are truthful to yourself. Your first blending was quick. Don&#39;t worry, things will be explained in time. For now, enjoy the wonder of discovery. It&#39;s not magic, but the science is quite fascinating.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look to Candy, &quot;So, is it your turn next?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy nods, &quot;Actually, yes it is. But not until we go to bed for the night. Muffin was bound to the figurine, but now is bound to you. Tonight, I will join her being bound to you. That way, when we have to revert to our vessel, it will be you. Anyway...trust me, anything I say will make no sense now, but strangely enough, will later.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod slowly, &quot;I am committed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy gives a muted smile, &quot;There is no question about that. Your dreams will not be your own at night. Muffin is not a fan of english, as her given name doesn&#39;t translate easily.&quot; Candy gets up and comes back with a notepad with some writing on it, it&#39;s a series of symbols that reads &quot;sq&#787;a&#411;&#789;&quot;, and as Candy sits down, &quot;And I always mess up the pronunciation. She is a very old soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at Candy, &quot;So what was your given name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy pauses, then sighs, &quot;Claud Dalrymple, no E on the end of Claud.&quot; Candy continues to shake her head, &quot;But...as you are becoming aware, you step away from the life that was and embrace a new life. Candy fits best.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why me?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;You picked us,&quot; Candy quickly responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Regrets?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;None, ever,&quot; Candy again quickly responds.<br />
<br />
Curious, you ask, &quot;Before I purchased the figurines, when did you last live in this world?&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy is slower to respond, &quot;You will see. We are always around. You will understand. The best thing I can say to you is, Don&#39;t be in a hurry to know everything. Let your discovery be about you. The old lady and I have your back.&quot; Candy gazes at your for a few moments, her eyes soaking in your image, &quot;You do inspire a deep seeded lust. Do you feel any deep feelings or desires?&quot;<br />
<br />
You close your eyes, knowing the answer, and feeling a sense of embarrassment, &quot;Yes, that knot, that sense when it quickly swells, filling me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;Mine is being milked, and being pregnant second. I can say that changing people has a rather erotic charm for me. How about you and I go to a evening hangout, a tavern, or a bar?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod, &quot;Sure, just let me change...,&quot; and your interrupted by Candy.<br />
<br />
Candy shakes her head no, &quot;No need to change.&quot; Candy takes your hand and in a few moments, you see a few tatoos form on your legs and arms. &quot;Pick a place that attracts some trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod and stand up, with Candy right behind, following you to the car where the two of you get inside and leave. You drive to Anne&#39;s Roadhouse, a rather seedy joint across the street from the old apartment you used to rent, a known thug hangout. Candy gave you a rather thug girl look, with long purple hair and black fingernails. You park down the street a few blocks and walk up to the bar. The bouncer smiles, as he leans down to slide his finger along your vagina, and keeps doing it until it slowly pushes the fabric inside you, leaving an obvious cameltoe. Candy&#39;s outfit is a bikini top and a blue jean skirt. The bouncer&#39;s finger goes quickly inside her pussy, where he finds her g-spot and gets a shiver out of Candy. Satisfied, we both get the nod to enter. Inside, we became the only two women who were not with a male friend, and there were many to be had. Candy had told me to follow her lead in the car. It was Candy that scanned the room, walking around, ignoring the catcalls and shouts at us, and honed in on two guys standing who were sitting at the corner of the bar.<br />
<br />
The two guys heard the commotion as we got closer, and were looking at us approach them. Candy did the talking while the two guys kept moving their eyes from chest to chest, as if they were picking. Soon we were walking  out with the two denim clad men to a van parked a couple of blocks away. Once inside, the two men got very aggressive, and stripped Candy first, then were trying to rip my compression suit off when Candy froze them in time. Candy started to disrobe one of the men, then pointed at the man who was grabbing me. Soon, both men were naked in the van, along with Candy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were they going to force themselves on us?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
Candy nods, &quot;Yes. It was in their minds, but it is not a crime to think these thoughts, it is wrong to act on them like they were doing. That fear you felt is genuine. This isn&#39;t the first time these two have done that, but it is the last.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy spent the next several hours with the four of us in the van. I can say I got to watch a master at work. These two were not very clean, so in a matter of a hand wave, their body hair and top layer of skin got flaky and fell off with a light brushing. They were aware of what was going on, and the two were placed where they could see the other. I wanted the one who grabbed me to have a chest like mine. Candy took that two steps further, as form lactating F cup breasts were now on a rather burly,  chubby naked man. This sight rather turned on the other, who&#39;s erection was giving away what he thought of his friend. Candy tapped into the man&#39;s thoughts, and shaped his partner in crime to those desires, except for one. His now female friend was going to be the dominate of the two of them. His friends now very lesbian thoughts were the template for Candy to follow. The two hairless naked forms with firm pointed breasts, bare slits for a pussy, and hourglass shapes were unfrozen to enjoy each other for a while as Candy watched. You turn away and look out of the window for anyone walking on the street. Transformations take time, and body mass.<br />
<br />
Candy taps you on the shoulder as your looking out of the van window, then whispers &quot;Close your eyes and clear your mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
You close your eyes and breath deeply. It takes a few moments, but you feel their lust for each other, left to fulfill their own desires on each other. You feel yourself getting turned on when it goes black.<br />
<br />
Candy whispers, &quot;Sorry...it&#39;s a bit intense in there. I&#39;ve given them a special bit to satisfy each other, a rather special tongue. Aroused, it swells and grows so it can penetrate like a cock, and having the same sensation as their lady button.&quot;<br />
<br />
They look alike now, but the one with larger breasts gave a frightening squeal, as her tongue swelled and moved to stuff his face into his  partner&#39;s pussy. The partner then gave his own cry as his tongue throbbed out of his mouth, and soon both phallus tongues were grinding into the others pussy. The two bald and hairless men, who are now structurally female,  were left by you and Candy in that van.<br />
<br />
Walking back to the car, it was almost dawn, and Candy says, &quot;I had a family once, and pigs like them had their way with them. There are so many of them, I know I can&#39;t find them all and fix them my way, but I will fix those I can find.&quot; Candy squeezed my hand hard as she spoke, then realized it, and loosened her grip. Apologetically, she said, &quot;Muffin says I am wasting my time, but I know if I do nothing someone will be a victim that I could have prevented. Sorry about squeezing your hand so tight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t like how that bouncer touched us,&quot; you complain.<br />
<br />
Candy smiles, &quot;He will wake up with a hungry, hair trigger pussy instead of balls the next time he falls asleep. So when we see him again, you can return the favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Candy restores your body as you reach Conner&#39;s car and you drive back to the house. The ride back was in silence, as Candy was ready for the next night out, you were just glad that next victim was not you. As a man you were never scared about this, but tonight was too close for comfort. That fear made you freeze, you did not try to fight or run, and that bothers you being venerable like that. You stand in the kitchen as Candy goes into your bedroom. You leave for work in less than an hour. You decide against a nap, take off your compression suit, and head to your shower, passing a sleeping Candy on your bed in her otteress form. You didn&#39;t expect an all-nighter, but live and learn, and you know after last night, you have a lot to learn.</p>
