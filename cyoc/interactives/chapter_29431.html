<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You make it to the doctors and ring the bell.. he comes out screaming saying you are the most needy were-fox he knows. you tell him to check out the new were-fox he does some test and says that she is a normal female were-fox. thats when you break the news that she use to be male.<br />
he asked if you used the sheath technique and you say and and begin to tell him the story of the rapist. about this time you go call home and tell your mates that nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
2 hours later the doctor takes many MRI's and decides that he sees something he doesn't like. so he pulls open your penis again and sticks the probe in. the new were-fox has a puzzles and disgusted look on her face and ask about why the doctor would stick a probe in a males penis. <br />
<br />
you say &quot; well your instincts tell you about how were-fox's turn humans into were's right&quot;... and he nodes her head. &quot; well one of the were-fox's i live with found a way to make it pleasurable to him and the  male prize winner or as humans see it, victim, that the males thick there cock in his his sheath and me makes them think that they will turn him into a female fox.his sheath females sort of like a vagina and they stick there dick in and they start to hump there dick into his sheath slowly making his dick smaller making them think they have won. do you understand&quot; she weakly nodes.&quot; well normal right before they turn him into a vixen he turns them over pulls up so that they have there dick almost out and then starts to fuck there dick in his sheath making his dick grow and theres shrink. he does this to the point that there dick pops out of his sheath and then his dick pops out and fucks there dick into a vagina then comes into them and they become were-fox's still with me &quot; she weakly nods again.&quot; basically he uses his sheath as a way to make males into females and gets the most out of it. and if he starts to lose even when hes on top or they turn him back over he starts to lick there neck and nipples which makes them submissive thanks to the instincts in human brains during sex and ends up winning anyways. but when he tried to do it to me he went farther to female than he liked and in a last minuet effort to turn the tables his small nubs of a penis  went inside of mine I pulled back thinking it may have been a hair, and yes it was tank small, and when I slammed back down it there was enough time for his penis to grow back  a few millimeters and when I slammed back down his dick went in my penis and went in i was shocked and he stared to fuck my penis which cased it to evolve into a dual sex penis capable of sex to males and females and even making to possible for me to get pregnant and to make others pregnant.i grew a vaginal passage right below my penis but internal and no opening but though my penis.basically at the end of my penis it grew twice as wide and a flap of muscle grew there, one to my new vaginal passage and uterus and other other to my bladder prostate and testes. And depending on how you stimulate me depends on which one my penis goes too, also my penis grew muscle from the tip all the way down its length and into th vaginal passage making so it can work the penis also it grew pits in it to grab the spines of were-fox's penis.&quot; you say taking a small break&quot; but you sue to be a serial rapist that fucked others guys penis because it gave you pleasure, you must have screw over 100 guys penises but when you fucked mine , well..... it sort of ate your penis and turned you female were-fox.&quot; she nods and then realizes what you just said and starts to cry.<br />
<br />
while she cries you comfort her and the doctor looks at your uterus and as soon as he gets in, which made you shudder in pleasure, he saw her dick going into a new passage and then the passage closing..... like a specter in the digestive tract. he looks at the MRI's again and tells you that you have evolved again and now you have a small intestine going from your uterus to your stomach and that it seems that dick now eats and swallows anything foreign to it that means if your spines on the inside aren't engaged but something is inside that it will most likely try and pull it in... yet it seems to know the difference from your body parts and something not form your body. so you can masturbate both like a male and female as long as its not with something thats spines won't lock into you and also you pleasure would keep on rising till you swallow the offending object also his dick should be out of your body in ... 3 days or so.<br />
<br />
well after this the girl runs off as instincts start to full her and and she tries and ether make he own mate or find one, since she rlly has no human mind she also has no morals and will do it anyone as long as it makes her full inside not like other were-fox's who still have some morals. <br />
<br />
once you get home you make a mold of your male lovers cock and send it into a sex toy company and say you want 3 solid cocks made of a hard material out of the mold and 2 million hollow candy cocks that are like a normal humans. 2 weeks latter you get them for free and you use the solid ones for sex when your male lover is gone to get food natural or is off with the other fox's( he can't have sex with them because after you mate with a were-fox and have babies you get a telepathic link but when you did the other woman you hadn't had babies yet so now you are a 3 pack normal a pack would start within 3 days and have 10 or more in it) but you sue the normal ones to eat the stuff you can't anymore like plants and candy though your dick.</p>
