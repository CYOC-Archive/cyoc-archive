<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Abolith and Shizen talked, Raiden and Sachiko now journeyed with their friends towards their favorite playground. What the two kits didn&#39;t realize though is that their friends had questions.<br />
<br />
It started shortly after Ren&#39;s funeral. Pam recognized far too many of the guests, as well as the home where Ren was buried. The young teen had noticed Sachiko, Raiden, and even Sachikos mother. At the time she had been far too busy but afterwards she began to wonder.<br />
<br />
It couldn&#39;t be a coincidence. A Soul Drive buried on the property Sachiko and her family called home. A property that was supposedly haunted, if the urban legends were to be believed. Pam knew Sachiko lived at the supposed old witches house. She and her friends had been there, they had seen Sachikos parents, a six tailed kitsune and a blue skinned angel. Doing some further research, which Pam and the others considered almost a hobby, they discovered the property belonged to Yuriko Mishimura. Yuriko wasn&#39;t a witch, they thought. Yet, she did live with magical creatures. As did Misaki Nakomoto.<br />
<br />
This is what brought them to Darren.<br />
<br />
Darren&#39;s best friend was Hannah, a Soul Drive. Working at the school the teachers eventually discovered that Darren and Misaki were a couple. Pam had even seen Darren approach not only Yuriko but Sachikos parents as well. Something strange was going on with their student. The teachers curiosity knew no bounds, just like every child their age. Sachiko and Raiden knew something about Darren and they would find out what it was.<br />
<br />
As the group now entered the playground, they began to make their way towards the jungle gym. Although the weather was rapidly approaching spring, there was still a bit of a chill in the air. Drawing their jackets tight, they now made their way to the top, avoiding the muddy surfaces in the process.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what do you want to do today,&quot; Sachiko asked happily as she now hung upside down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Still a little muddy and cold honestly,&quot; Stella shrugged. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for summer.&quot; The group all nodded in agreement. One of the bonuses of being a teenage teacher meant summers off. The teens still resided with their parents, meaning they didn&#39;t have the usual bills or responsibilities of their coworkers. For them summers were a chance to let loose and enjoy themselvess.<br />
<br />
&quot;My parents are thinking of sending me to camp,&quot; Gail stated. &quot;I&#39;m trying to talk them out of it. I want to hang around with you guys. Maybe take a trip to the beach or something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like fun,&quot; Stella replied. &quot;I think we should all go. Its not that far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would we get there though,&quot; Ewart asked. &quot;In case no one noticed, none of us are old enough to drive.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could have one of our parents drive us,&quot; Pam stated. &quot;I don&#39;t know about you guys but my folks are always busy.&quot; The group now turned to Sachiko and Raiden. &quot;What about your parents?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think my parents drive,&quot; Raiden stated. &quot;And I definitely don&#39;t think they would want to go to the beach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mama does,&quot; Sachiko said happily. &quot;I bet she could if we asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
The group nodded in agreement, it seemed like a good enough plan. The teens now exchanged a knowing look between one another. They had had other questions they wanted to ask. &quot;So does anyone else drive at your house Sachiko?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Stella said. &quot;You live at the Mishimura house right? Doesn&#39;t Mrs. Mishimura drive?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Granny Yuriko really doesn&#39;t drive much any more,&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko can I ask a question,&quot; Gail asked. Sachiko nodded, a wide smile forming across her face. &quot;Sachiko is there anything special about Granny Yuriko. Like, special special. Like magically special?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sachikos smile faltered as she turned to Raiden. She couldn&#39;t lie to her friends but she wasn&#39;t sure how much she could say about Yuriko. The white kit now shifted nervously in place as she tried to answer. &quot;Um maybe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko,&quot; Pam said warmly, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. &quot;Listen were not mad but...we&#39;ve noticed things. Supernatural things. We know something is up. We just want to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sachiko said softly. &quot;But its a secret. You can&#39;t tell anybody. And I mean anybody! Cross your heart, hope to die, stick a needle in your eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
The teens all promised, anxiously leaning in to listen. The anticipation to their questions almost causing them to leap out of their skin. Sachiko paused, taking a deep breath before leaning in. &quot;Granny Yuriko is a wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A wizard?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sachiko nodded, explaining Yuriko to the teens. Yuriko was the owner of the Spells R Us store. A one stop shopping plaza for incredibly rare magical items. Yuriko used her magic for good, having friends from all over the mulitverse visiting her from time to time. The teens sat in awe, both amazed and confused by Sachikos explanation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So she&#39;s like a modern day Merlin,&quot; Ewart said in awe. &quot;So what is Darren McKenna doing at her house?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren,&quot; Raiden asked. &quot;You mean the Catalyst?&quot; <br />
<br />
The teens paused, casting a curious look in Raidens direction. Cata what?<br />
<br />
&quot;Raiden,&quot; Sachiko exclaimed. &quot;Thats supposed to be a secret!&quot;  Raiden blushed, offering a meek apology as he lowered his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait hold on,&quot; Neela stated. &quot;What exactly is a, what did you call it, a Catalyst.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how is Darren connected to it,&quot; Pam added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its um nothing,&quot; Sachiko stammered. &quot;And um who&#39;s this Darren guy? I don&#39;t know anyone named Darren. Raiden, do you know anyone named Darren?&quot; Raiden quickly said no, shaking his head vigorously as the teens cast the two kits a dubious look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko,&quot; Gail sighed. &quot;Look, we kinda figured out something was up. I mean Darren was at that funeral at your house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;ve seen him talking with you and Mrs. Mishimura,&quot; Pam added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Plus we figured out he&#39;s dating Misaki,&quot; Ewart said. &quot;So you don&#39;t have to hide it. We kinda figured it out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How though,&quot; Raiden asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re geniuses,&quot; Stella sighed. &quot;Its kind of a blessing and a curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sachiko glanced between her friends and Raiden, grunting in annoyance as she glared at Raiden. &quot;We&#39;re going to get in so much trouble for this Raiden.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was an accident,&quot; Raiden groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sachiko, Raiden its okay,&quot; Neela smiled, placing a reassuring hand on their shoulders. &quot;We&#39;re all friends here and if it helps we were beginning to figure things out. If your parents ask just tell them we found out about it on our own and told you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two kitsune kits still seemed unsure but finally sighed. There was no point in lying, their friends already had an idea that something was amiss. It was better to just let them know than have them investigate on their own.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Sachiko sighed. &quot;A Catalyst is a once in a generation wizard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Darren McKenna is a wizard!&quot;<br />
<br />
The group now furrowed their brows at Ewart, the teen offering a weak apology before quieting down. &quot;Yes Darren is a wizard,&quot; Sachiko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But not just an ordinary wizard,&quot; Raiden added. &quot;He can actually shape the world. Make things better than they should be. Create a utopia based on his ideas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Catalyst comes around maybe once in a hundred years,&quot; Sachiko continued. &quot;Shaping human and magical history for next century to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he&#39;s what some kind of God,&quot; Gail asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not so much a God more like an engine for change,&quot; Sachiko stated. &quot;Thats why they call it a Catalyst. He is the object that brings on change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At least thats the story we&#39;ve heard,&quot; Raiden said.<br />
<br />
The teens now paused, gazing at the kits before turning to one another. They had believed that one of their students may have been involved in something supernatural. Instead they discovered he was a literal instrument for change for humanity. Finding out one of your students was some sort of near god, the teens now asked the only logical question left.<br />
<br />
&quot;So can we meet him?&quot;</p>
