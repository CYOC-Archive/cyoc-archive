<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Filming the last bit for Animalia Ambassadoria worked out well, and Lexia was happy to meet with the new people and have them involved. She remained impressed with Polly, for various reasons. The Polar Bear Animalian was quite impressive in every way but had also shown a lot of intelligence and thought when it came to certain topics that came up with these episodes. Lexia enjoyed that. Though, having Malice show up for some of the filming sessions was still something of a surprise, as the Husky Animalian was officially employed in elements of the show that didn&#39;t relate to the actual filming. And for the moment, though, Malice&#39;s presence worked with some things that ended up as part of the episode.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mrs. Truman,&quot; Lexia spoke and made sure to speak politely. She&#39;d learned that people tended to respond better to respect than things that would come off as some kind of complaint, which Lexia feared what she would have to say would come off as.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Malice,&quot; Malice answered and gave a warm smile, &quot;I mean... I&#39;m sure there is going to be some measure of protocol that says that would be improper... but then, I&#39;m also the sort that wants to be able make friends and be friendly. I had some college professors that could be very intimidating and that isn&#39;t something I&#39;d want to carry on while looking over things for Animalia Ambassadoria.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lexia managed slowly, &quot;Malice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you have to ask?&quot; Malice wondered, &quot;I&#39;m sure you have access to the uploading of the video that we just shot, correct?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I can do that and learned all the upload codes and rules when Miles brought me on, I think after Jen-Jen and some of the others that were on the earlier team graduated before this past summer,&quot; Lexia answered, &quot;this just an update on scheduling and things like that. Just before things get too hectic. As Thanksgiving isn&#39;t too far away and Christmas follows shortly after. I&#39;d image that you will have a lot on your plate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice&#39;s friendly smile remained, &quot;oh, some things well be hectic, but we&#39;ll manage. And much of what I do is actually office work and relates to scheduling and things like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good... because that&#39;s kinda what I wanted to talk about,&quot; Lexia spoke, &quot;given your mention on &quot;going south for the winter&quot; and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice looked up and blinked. While their part of Nevada didn&#39;t get a lot of cold weather, it could still be cold enough that some animals weren&#39;t always out and about. There were plenty of songbirds that came in the spring and roosted near or on people&#39;s homes before going south for the winter. She also knew that some of the various Bird Animalians that were based off of some of these migratory songbirds at least talked about migration to more suitable climates, though that didn&#39;t always apply with Animalians. She figured, though, that since the Yellow-Headed Amazon Parrot was native to the coastal regions of Central America and the farthest north it ranged was just south of Texas, she figured that Lexia would enjoy the opportunity to go where it might be warmer than Nevada in winter. The mention on talking about that, however, had Malice wondering if something like Sophie&#39;s call reminding her of Sophie and Roland&#39;s college related schedules was coming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you not wanting to go south?&quot; Malice asked slowly, &quot;if that&#39;s true... it&#39;s okay. Most of the companies wouldn&#39;t be accepting orders for tickets yet... though, if that is true, I will need to know. To essentially know who to call and what sort of hotel accommodations they would want or need.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mind going south,&quot; Lexia told her, &quot;As my species of parrot doesn&#39;t live in temperate areas. Outside of a species from Australia, I don&#39;t think any modern parrot does. But I am still attending WSA, and I think I have two years before I graduate. In this, I do have to go by their schedule. And while they may excuse some short trips here and there where I&#39;d have a day or two of excused absences, it can&#39;t be something where I leave now and don&#39;t return until March. That&#39;d keep me from graduating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice actually chuckled a little bit, &quot;I&#39;ve gotten some calls from parents on that sort of thing. Polly&#39;s adoptive parents in the Whites aren&#39;t the only ones. But it&#39;s something we can work with, as I haven&#39;t had time to get into the full works yet. So... what would you be looking for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The break that would have the most time would be the Christmas break,&quot; Lexia answered, &quot;as the school goes to break before Christmas and I could fly down and do the report from there. You could even tie it into how any of the new Dinotopians down there are working Argentine celebrations and some of the dietary issues that come with being a Dinotopian... or some other kind of Animalian if those converting didn&#39;t want to go the Dinotopian route. I did something like that in Vilcabamba a couple of years ago on how they&#39;ve combined Brazilian traditions with Animalian forms and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could work out... and could give them more time to get things settled and organized,&quot; Malice warned her, &quot;meaning more to cover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can handle all that,&quot; Lexia answered, &quot;just so long as they are aware of the timing that I&#39;d be coming in a few days before Christmas and would be returning to Lyre/Animalia just before New Years so that I&#39;d be here for the start of the second half of the school year. I just wanted to let you know so that way something isn&#39;t scheduled that would get me in trouble with the school and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice nodded, &quot;I understand... A shame you&#39;d then still have to go through a lot of our winters here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They aren&#39;t too bad,&quot; Lexia reminded her, &quot;and there are plenty of ways to keep warm. Things you and your team covered way back in the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Malice chuckled and nodded. Animalia had led to a fair amount of innovation that enabled for places that would be able to provide climate &quot;safe&quot; areas for the time and year. Specialized saunas and the like that provided warmth in the winter for those more attuned to a warmer climate, and a specialized set of hot tubs that played to some of the geothermal energy that came from some of the mountains that fit the western most part of Animalia and moved toward the California border. There were also areas like the Ice Haus that were set up to keep things cool for those Animalians better acclimated to colder temperatures, though with winter coming, the Ice Haus was closing for the season. Though, many of the Ice Haus&#39;s workers then moved over to the saunas and other hot spots to provide the same services.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Malice nodded with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ll let you know before WSA&#39;s finals week starts so that way you&#39;ll know your schedule and what to expect. You may even have to work in some knowledge on Dinotopians and various fossil finds. Sophie and Roland might be able to give you some tips and I can give you their email if you need it. The best source, though, might be Doctor Ramos down in Dino City. Though, Jeremy Green won&#39;t be too far behind him if you may need some pointers for the segments at the new Dinotopian colony.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lexia nodded.</p>
