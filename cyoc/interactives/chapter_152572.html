<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt didn&#39;t really know why he was following Luke as he slowly made his way out of the basement and into the dorm building. At first, he didn&#39;t even question it, he just felt a sense of belonging to the other man. However, once they reached fresh air and familiar surroundings, more and more questions formed in his head. Questions he hoped he would be able to answer with Lukes help.<br />
<br />
Luke felt a similiar sensation the farther they went. While at first he had a confident stride, doubts brought him back towards his old personality. Since when was he smoking? And what did he just do to Matt? He barely knew that guy and used him as a living ashtray. He was tense as he finally reached his dorm room and hoped that it would give them the chance to discuss what just happened. However, once he opened the door, he almost backed back out again. That... wasn&#39;t his dorm room. Well, yes, actually it was, but it was different. Mainly due to the nicotine yellow color of all his belongings, the stained windows and clothes as well as the occasional bit of ash on the floor or burn mark on the furniture.  Everything stank, no, he corrected himself, smelled of cigarettes. He shook his head. Of course it was his dorm room. That&#39;s what it always looked, right? He knew that smoking wasn&#39;t allowed in the dorm rooms, but why would he give a flying fuck about some non-smoker rules? <br />
<br />
Matt was pretty disgusted at the sight of Lukes dorm room and became annoyed again. That guy surely had issues. He didn&#39;t think there were lots of heavy smokers left in 2019, but Luke was probably due to lung cancer before he turned 40, judging from the room. Nevertheless, he needed answers. So, after hesitating for a moment, he followed Luke in, who let himself plump to the only seating, a small couch. Matt wasn&#39;t entirely happy that the only other place was next to Luke, but seated himself as well, carefully avoiding any suspicious stains.<br />
&quot;So. What... happened down there?&quot;, Matt opened the conversation. &quot;I mean, it was all some kind of a blur, with all these cells and gas and then you... you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;using you as an ashtray&quot; Luke continued. &quot;God, I&#39;m so sorry, I don&#39;t know what came over me! That was a real dick move and I don&#39;t know why I did it.&quot;<br />
Luke really couldn&#39;t understand what drove him to this, which worried him deeply. Automatically, he reached into his leather jackets front pocket and lit another cigarette, inhaling the smoke and exhaling through his nostrils.<br />
&quot;That was just so... unlike me!&quot; He said, while taking another drag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya, everything down there was just strange. I mean, I don&#39;t know why I was caring for your ash to start with.&quot; Matt replied, doing his best to hide his disgust for Luke smoking yet another cigarette next to him. &quot;Sure, you shouldn&#39;t just dispose of your ash on the table or the floor, but into an ...&quot; Matt looked around. Now it started to dawn on him what was missing from this smoker room. Despite apparently being a heavy smoker, Luke did not seem to posses an ashtray. <br />
&quot;...ashtray. Don&#39;t you have any around here?&quot; Matt continued with raising annoyance. It was just not right to just drop it where he stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, no.&quot; Luke answered after a short moment. He remembered stealing one or two ashtrays, but they usually broke or he lost them. He didn&#39;t really care too much about them to be honest. <br />
&quot;I guess I forgot to buy a new one since the last one broke.&quot; He watched the ashy tip of his cigarette get longer as her took another drag, causing the small cylinder to burn up another centimeter. He looked to Matt who just opened his mouth for an agitated reply. It did work before, he thought, and just snipped his ash into the open mouth of his guest.<br />
<br />
Matt originally wanted to lecture Luke about hygiene and, frankly, that he was behaving rutheless, but got surprised of the ashen taste of the cigarette waste in his mouth. Finally, he thought. Finally he&#39;s coming to his senses and doesn&#39;t just ash on the floor. Matt opened his mouth a bit wider, to make it easier for Luke to use him.<br />
He felt dizzy, like there were ants crawling over his skin, his mouth quickly became the center of his attention. The taste, the purpose. That was what mattered after all. He opened his mouth even wider, looking up to the ceiling in order to bring his mouth into a horizontal position. <br />
<br />
Luke relaxed more. Why did he feel so on edge a few moments before? He took another drag and flung his ash into Matt, who was behaving strangely again. He had his head turned all the way back into his neck and the mouth wide open. Unnaturally wide even, and almost entirely round. As he watched lazily, Matts body from the head down seemed to shrink away, Legs and Arms retracting into him and leaving only his head in a pile of falle off clothes on the couch. However, that head had undergone dramatic changes itself. Matts skin hat turned completly black and had taken on a ceramic texture. The whole skull had flattened in on itself, and left only a low black ceramic bowl with nudged for cigarettes. <br />
Luke sighed again, grinding out his cigarette into his ashtray, before placing it on the table before him, wondering for a moment why there were some clothes next to him on the couch. He briefly thought one of his bitches might have forgotten them, but they were clearly dudes clothes - since he wasn&#39;t a fag, it must have been something one of his bros forgot from the last time they came over. Or whatever, he didn&#39;t really care.<br />
His day had been stressful enough, even though the details eluded him for the moment. He stripped down to his boxers, switched on the TV and lit another cigarette. Time to have a relaxed evening.<br />
<br />
Matts world was reduced to a single sensation of taste and purpose. Serving as an ashtray had, right now, nothing disgusting. It was his duty, his purpose to serve and be used. In a way, it was an orgasmic feeling, every time he caught the gray stuff that was his purpose of existence. As the evening went on, that happened often enough.</p>
