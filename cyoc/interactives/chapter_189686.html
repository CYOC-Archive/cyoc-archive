<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa smiled as she snuggled herself next to Trevor as they lay in a rather secluded section of the woods between North Street  and the next street to the west of it. Though, quiet, was probably a rather relative word as there were the sounds that came from other parts of the woods that gave an indication that Melissa and Trevor weren&#39;t the only ones that had come out into the woods to have sex. However, the only one that had her attention was the werebull that lay beside her. He was strong and handsome, but the thing that truly won her over in the brief time they&#39;d known each other before Halloween as calm, understanding, and friendly personality. He respected her and put her first, even at some times when she didn&#39;t quite feel like herself and his coming to her rescue after the Halloween dance proved that to her. That made him worth every bit of pleasure the two had shared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything has been like magic for me since my dad and I moved here,&quot; Melissa mused to Trevor and nuzzled her muzzle to his, &quot;we came here and were nervous... particularly over things related to the Mandatory Were Law... and my dad was still heavily mourning my mother&#39;s death.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded but said nothing as he looked back to the deep brown eyes Melissa had in her werecow form. He ignored the soft velvety feel of Melissa&#39;s left breast pressing against his right arm as she snuggled in beside him, though he did manage to take Melissa&#39;s hand in his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;And while Decrux made a mess of things,&quot; Melissa&#39;s smile remained, &quot;my dad has found happiness with Virginia... and I&#39;ve found you. And since Halloween... I just have the sense that you and I will have many happy years ahead of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mirror friend, I take it?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Possibly... though there are some things with her that just feel hazy, it&#39;s nothing like what Megumi would describe with regard to a werefox&#39;s bond, but there&#39;s... I don&#39;t know... a certain calm confidence about it,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;and something I don&#39;t feel I&#39;d have without you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor happily smiled, as in many ways, Melissa meant a lot to him too. And since werecattle didn&#39;t have anything quite like a werefox&#39;s bond, he could never explain it himself, but there was just something special about her that he&#39;d never lose. When he first met Melissa Jenkins, he saw someone lost and simply in need of a friend who she could talk to and wouldn&#39;t have to worry about &quot;upsetting&quot; anyone. While Trevor had been born and raised in Moon Lake, he could be fairly aware of how awkward it could be for new residents and wanted to be the best friend and &quot;ambassador&quot; Moon Lake could have. But every interaction with Melissa had been wonderful and special in ways he couldn&#39;t explain, and it made him dearly wish that Melissa was right that they&#39;d have many years of happiness together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... if and when you see her again,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;thank her for helping us get together... for as human or were... you&#39;ve made me tremendously happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Melissa answered happily and with a small laugh, &quot;for a lot of it feels like magic. And to a degree... I LIKE that... Though, we&#39;d probably best be getting home. We&#39;ve had a nice walk... a passionate bout of sex... and a part of me wouldn&#39;t mind more, but it&#39;s a school night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Trevor answered and the two slowly got to their feet, &quot;and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re too far from your house. We can just cut through the woods that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa followed Trevor&#39;s arm as he pointed in a largely eastward direction. And while the woods were fairly dark, she was also amazed by how well she could see. Granted she&#39;d never worked with animals and thus didn&#39;t know how well cattle could see in low light, but she hadn&#39;t really expected to see as well as she did. She could see the branches on the deciduous trees and which ones still had all their leaves and which ones didn&#39;t. It was amazing in a way.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never expected to be able to see so well in the dark,&quot; Melissa managed as Trevor lead the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of that has more to do with being a were than with being a werecow specifically,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;all weres can see well in low light conditions. For weretigers, like your dad, it&#39;ll be obvious because tigers are by nature largely active at dawn and dusk and into the night, when much of their prey is the most active. For werecattle... it&#39;s not thought of, because... well, while cattle may be active at night, they&#39;re big enough that not much will attack them and since they are herbivorous animals they aren&#39;t need extreme night vision to see the grass in front of them... But as I said, being a were gives you good night vision.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Might relate on how some stories came about over the years,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;the story of the minotaur in Greece probably came from some traveler&#39;s run in with a werecow or werebull on the island. And supposedly that minotaur was kept in a dark labyrinth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was probably more exaggeration than anything else,&quot; Trevor commented, to which Melissa agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still relates to being able to see well in the dark... and THAT is what I&#39;m most amazed by,&quot; Melissa answered as they walked along and took Trevor&#39;s hand in hers, &quot;it lets me see the handsome, hard working... but above smart and kind young man that won my heart and why I wanted him to turn me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded as the two of them ducked under a low hanging branch as the walked. The maneuvered through the trees reasonably well, but their hooved feet crackled the leaves on the ground, even those that were wet, and there was also the concern that their horns might snag a tree branch which could leave things open stumbles. They avoided that, but that didn&#39;t mean the concern wasn&#39;t there. It wasn&#39;t long before the back door and patio area to the Jenkins home started to come into view to their southeast and they turned toward it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And prepare for the all the happiness that will come for us in the future,&quot; Melissa smiled, &quot;though first would be dad and Virginia&#39;s wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You still want me there?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;you&#39;re practically family and you&#39;ve been on good terms with Virginia. So it wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing to have you there. Dad says it&#39;s at 10:30 AM at the courthouse. You could arrive here by like ten and we could all ride together. After that... dad and Virginia will have their honeymoon... so my afternoon will be free.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;well, I&#39;ll do my best... and I do have some good clothes I can wear... nothing super formal, but still appropriate, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded as they walked around the south side of the Jenkins house to then approach Trevor&#39;s truck, still parked  on the driveway. Trevor carefully opened the door and began to change back to his human form, largely to fit in the truck. It didn&#39;t take long as his tail was pulled back within him, his feet flattened, his fur was pulled back in, his horns withered down while his ears moved back to the sides of his head. It soon left him there standing in his human form, though he was soon hopping into the seat in order to dress himself for his drive back to the Tyson farm.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime... there might be something for you tomorrow,&quot; Trevor spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow... isn&#39;t that your sister&#39;s birthday?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Trevor nodded, &quot;though with you and I together as an item... you could formally join the herd. It&#39;s not huge, and a lot of the extended families aren&#39;t living close enough to Moon Lake to be there... but it&#39;s also not limited to my family here. You wouldn&#39;t need to bring a gift for Anna Bell a lot of it is going to be the formal recognition that you joined the herd and that Anna Bell would be old enough that her first transformation could well be approaching.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t get in the way of anything, would it?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;because... in a way... you&#39;re family.&quot;<br />
<br />
By now Trevor was dressed and he got up to kiss Melissa on the nose before climbing back into his truck and starting the engine. Melissa stood by the driveway and watched him back out and eventually depart. It was only when he got far enough down the street to make the turn that Melissa then turned around and went inside.</p>
