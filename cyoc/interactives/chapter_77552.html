<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan gulped, urging Jack to lower him to the ground, “You did great, pup!  J-just, set me down, please!”  He had not anticipated the chronovac <br />
would make his loads so powerful.  Carefully, Dan slid from Jack’s massive palm into the parking lot.  Dan’s pup quickly brought his head down <br />
as deep as possible, groveling, his bellowing whimpers making the ground rumble.<br />
<br />
“Phew...let’s make you a more managable size first,” Dan eyed the mall, fire engines had started arriving.  With a few quick inputs into the <br />
Chronovac, the damage had never happened.  Jack’s whimpering brought Dan’s attention back...he scanned his new pup.  He kinda enjoyed <br />
Jack at the massive, two-story size...but maybe just start at his original, hulking 10-foot height.<br />
<br />
Jack shrunk quickly, shivering as his size dwindled till he was his original 10-foot height.  Dan reached his hand out, petting at Jack’s bright <br />
red mane.  “Better, pup...you wouldn’t even fit in my house before.”<br />
<br />
“M-Master,” Jack whimpered, crawling closer to kiss and lick at Dan’s feet and calves, “I’m a redhead...the world wasn’t built for 1% of the <br />
population, we barely fit anywhere anyways.”  Jack finished with a chuckle, his face blushing.<br />
<br />
Dan paused...pulling up the Chronovac, he selected population distribution, dialing down by race...  Indeed, barely 1% of the population were <br />
redheaded.  Dan had lucked out with his four submissive pups...but what if redheads accounted for a much larger portion of the world’s <br />
population?  <br />
<br />
“What if the world was built for redheads...”  Dan asked his pup rhetorically.  He had a mischievous grin, tapping through the population <br />
distribution in the chronovac, dragging the redhead population up till it represented 10% of the world.  The air around Dan shimmered...but <br />
there wasn’t any noticeable change.  The mall doors were the same height, his pup would still have to duck low to enter most buildings.<br />
<br />
“More,” he grumbled, dragging the slide to 30%, then, casting inhibition to the wind, 75%, quickly hitting save.  Three in Four people would be <br />
a giant, submissive, hyper loyal redhead.  Dan watched with delight as the world around him changed, cars plumping larger, doorways <br />
doubling in height.  Billboards over the parking changed to advertisements targeting redheads.  “Make your Master Proud, join RedHeads Elite <br />
Gym.”  Movie posters outside the theatre entrance had been replaced...all redheaded protagonists.  Dan kinda wanted to see them...<br />
<br />
The world had been divided into two castes, the brown, blonde and black haired Masters and the gingers whose duty it was to serve them. This <br />
was the way that this world had always been (as far as anybody else knew) and it all seemed perfectly normal. Because there was such a excess <br />
of gingers, it was incredibly common for a Master to collar multiple pups and take them into their household. A Master of the highest status <br />
was one who had many many gingers at his feet, whimpering, begging, attending to his every need. The average Master had two gingers in his <br />
household, a radical minority of Masters only had one.  And yet, there never seemed to be enough Master’s in the world for the abundance of <br />
redheads.<br />
<br />
With such a shortage of Masters, uncollared redheads were in a constant competition to better themselves.  The biggest, most submissive <br />
gingers were collared quickly.  Improving the service of a would-be sub was a multi-trillion dollar industry; gyms dedicated exclusively to <br />
redheads were as prolific as Starbucks in Dan’s old world.<br />
<br />
The largest section in any bookstore or library was the “Redhead Interests” section, which was filled with countless volumes as to how to <br />
develop yourself as a sub.  Romance novels all revolve around the universal redhead experience of being collared.  <br />
<br />
Storefronts were filled with mannequins of titanic proportions, modeling the season’s latest models of harness, cock cage or body jewellery.  <br />
Departments stores were tailored to the pursuit of a Master.  You could never have enough too-short kilts as a ginger.  There hardly seemed a <br />
food item on the market that wasn’t enhanced with protein, extra calories and sexual enhancers.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, if you weren’t a redhead, you were treated like royalty.  Not that all non-redheads were Doms (only half were even tops), but every <br />
redhead viewed them as superior...you never knew when you might find your future Master.  Prospective Masters were always paid better, had <br />
the best seat in a theatre, red heads would fight to hold a door open for you...<br />
<br />
Everywhere a Master went, his gingers would stand proudly at attention behind him, awaiting their orders. Everywhere a ginger went he would <br />
be representing the house of his Master, he had to be on his best behaviour at all time. It would be uncommon for a Master to cover up his <br />
pups all that much, a Master wants to show off his property to the world.<br />
<br />
Dan’s new laws in the new world meant that all gingers were natural titans, growing to sizes of mammoth proportions: having to duck and step <br />
sideways to get through doors, biceps the size of cannonballs were the norm. Almost universally gingers had heavy and ultra thick cocks and <br />
balls which hung at at least down to their knees, if not longer, their kilts leaving nothing to the imagination. It wasn’t even all that uncommon <br />
for a ginger to have his cock and balls drag behind him heavily as he walked. In this world, a ginger lives to serve his Master sexually, he could <br />
only cum with the explicit permission of his Master. Hundreds of generations of selective breeding and training had made this the case, with <br />
each generation redheads matured faster, were more intelligent, grew bigger, were submissive, and more virile.  It was projected that redheads <br />
would overtake the world population in just a few short decades...and by then, the average redhead would be three times the size of today’s <br />
redhead.<br />
<br />
The sounds gingers whimpering for their Master’s attention seemed to be a part of the general ambiance of this world, which seemed to echo <br />
through the city, their need for their Master’s insatiable and unquenchable. <br />
<br />
A ginger’s place in his life is to serve his Master and to obey all of his Master’s orders. A pup served his Master with love, devoting every part of <br />
himself to the one who has claimed him. There is not a part of a ginger which doesn’t belong to his Master. The first thing to be handed over <br />
was his name, upon being collared a Master will select a new name for his pup, and this will be the only name he will respond to. A pup’s body <br />
is an item which belongs to his Master, it is a tool of service, the bigger and stronger he can be get the more honour he brings to his <br />
household, and the more proud he can make his Master. A ginger lives and breathes his service, he barely has a thought that does not include <br />
his Master or about how to better himself for his Master. Even a ginger’s meagre pay cheque would always be given over to his Master as <br />
tribute of his love and devotion.<br />
<br />
Once collared, a redhead’s life finally begins.  Their drive to grow bigger and submit more increasing each day they spend with their Master...a <br />
carnal desire to always prove their worth.<br />
<br />
A thought came over Dan, what changes had happened to Patrick, Angus and Marcus - would they be the same or would they be changed as <br />
well?  Patrick was the Alpha Bear on campus, certainly a difficult title to win in this world, and his twin brother would be just as massive!  At any <br />
rate, he couldn’t wait to see. <br />
<br />
Jack started feeling rather self conscious all of a sudden. In the new world which Dan had created he was smaller than the average ginger, not <br />
only that but as he looked around he saw other gingers around him with heavier and sturdier locks, bold brands above their rumps showing <br />
with no uncertainty who they belong to, their massive arms, chests, backs and stomachs adorned with intricate tattoos - showing proudly the <br />
house they were part of, but also saying a bit about both a ginger and his Master.<br />
<br />
Dan picked up on Jack’s change of mood, his whimpers tugging at Dan’s heart.  “Pup, come along...let’s get you branded to match your <br />
brothers.”  Jack jumped up suddenly, his cock slapping wetly against his swollen muscle gut. Jack emitted an musk of submission and <br />
excitment (it was a unique trait about gingers in this world that you could determine almost exactly how he was feeling simply his smell along)<br />
<br />
“T-Thank you, Master,” Jack began to tear up, his breathing quickening, “I-I know I don’t deserve your mark being as small as I am, but I will <br />
earn it, everyday, I will make you proud, Master!”  Jack’s head hung down, tears of gratitude rolling off his face, down his pecs and becoming <br />
caught in the luxurious ginger pelt on his chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh, redheads,” Dan smiled, going up on his toes and reaching high for Jack’s collar, tugging him along towards the mall.  Other redheads--<br />
both collared and not--stopping in their tracks at the sight of Dan, smitten in seconds, causing them to question briefly their lifelong loyalties <br />
to their Masters.  The mall doors slid open automatically with a loud woosh, they were huge, 30-feet tall, at least, it looked like an airplane <br />
hangar entrance.  A gigantic redhead, nearly twice the size of Jack gasped at the sight of Dan, violently jerking his massive body out of the way.<br />
<br />
“A-after you, S-Sir!”  He stammered, falling to his knees and dropping his shopping bags, a metal cock ring the size of a hula-hoop rolling out <br />
loudly onto the marble floor of the mall.<br />
<br />
Dan turned to where the tattoo salon used to be...but the mall had changed.  Groups of massive redheads strolled casually together, most <br />
dwarfing Jack by several feet. Jack whimpered to himself at his own internalised inadequacies, he was not as strong, as muscular, as tall, his <br />
voice wasn’t so deep, his odour wasn’t even as strong... but what he did have was his Master’s collar. In himself he could not see how he <br />
deserved such a supreme honour, he was just a salesperson at an underwear store.  Being a redhead was so competitive, he never thought the <br />
day would come when a Master would collar him.  He was given this opportunity and it was his duty to  be the best ginger he could be for his <br />
Master, he would do everything in his power to make his Master proud - it was his duty, it was his mission, his only reason for living.  <br />
<br />
Jack could feel his mind rewriting itself...these feelings almost seemed impossible when they were described at Ginger Finishing School, and yet <br />
here it was happening, as predictable as puberty.  The earliest cave paintings in France depicted a redhead being collard...this was a moment <br />
that every Ginger dreamed of.  Though, those memories from Jack’s schooling were becoming harder and harder to access...did he have friends <br />
before Master?  Jack couldn’t even remember the faces of his many redheaded brothers.  Like most redheads of his generation, Jack came from <br />
a large family; thousands of years of selective breeding had creative hyper fertile redheads that reproduced dozens of offspring each year.  <br />
There were dozens of prophecies of the armageddon, when redheads become the dominant race and there is nobody left to serve...even the <br />
news was filled with the exponentially growing population of redheads and dwindling number of available Masters reported in the national <br />
census.  As these facts appeared in Jack’s mind, they would suddenly blink out of existence, gone forever, replaced with thoughts of his <br />
Master.  How perfect he was, how handsome, how gracious to allow Jack to spend his life serving him.<br />
<br />
Jack felt himself choke up his stomach and throat tightened, the tears which were falling from his eyes were becoming a torrent, wetting his <br />
chest hair to his skin. He felt willed down to his knees before his Master, but that hardly felt low enough, not enough to property demonstrate <br />
his love for his Master, he brought himself even lower bringing his face as close to much as his massive gut and pecs would allow them. He felt <br />
his words escaping him, but his musk and his whimpers were doing more speaking for him than he could possibly articulate. Dan felt <br />
overwhelmed by the smell of undiluted need and desperation he was detecting from his pup. He got a whiff of that feeling from every ginger he <br />
encountered, but that seemed somewhat superficial, no, this was different. It was the smell of someone who needed to give themselves over <br />
entirely to their Master for life, of someone who would never be satisfied unless he was with his Master.<br />
<br />
Between his loud whimpers Jack was able to articulate a few short phrases... “I need you”, “Please own me”... “Please brand me”. He kissed his <br />
Master’s feet and ankles gently, but not going any further. He didn’t have permission to go any further. He would wait at his Master’s feet for <br />
the rest of time should he have to.  <br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure, pup. Just show me where the tattoo parlor is?&quot;  Dan asked bashfully. The atten he was getting was overwhelming!  He felt like <br />
everyone in the mall was watching him, taking him in. Indeed, they were. Redheads, both collared and stray watched with baited interest from <br />
behind store displays. It was considered rude to rush a Master beginning to be claimed...you would most certainly be turned down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, Master, thank you, Master!&quot; Jack snapped up to attention standing just behind his Master. &quot;I'm not sure which tattooist you had in mind, <br />
but they're all in the east wing of the mall.&quot; Jack looked over at the Victor's Secret storefront, his manager saw the new collar and nodded <br />
approvingly...Jack had the day off. <br />
<br />
There were at least a dozen different tattoo parlors...it took Dan a few minutes to find the one he had taken Patrick, Marcus, and Angus to get <br />
branded. And there, seemingly still cleaning up the mess of cum from just hours ago, was a redheaded version of Barry. Larger than Dan, but a <br />
scrawny 7-feet tall for a ginger. He had no collar...Dan wondered what that was like, putting a Masters brand on a freshly collard pup, client <br />
after client, seeing the unparalleled bliss in their eyes as he transfer the mark, yet never having a master of his own. <br />
<br />
&quot;Barry!  I've got one more pup to brand.&quot; Dan looked around. It all seemed familiar. Just. Bigger. Much bigger. The table Patrick had rested on <br />
was twice the size...and there was cum everywhere! Much more than before. Geeze, what had happened?</p>
