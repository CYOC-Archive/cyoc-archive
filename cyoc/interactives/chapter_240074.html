<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The more Emily thought about it, the more she liked the idea. Watching as her mom continued to feed her baby brother, she waited until he had fallen asleep and was placed back in his crib before making the adjustments with the remote.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Jeff if only I could be a baby again like you, imagine the fun we could have together&quot; Janet voiced her naughty fantasy aloud quietly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry mom, you will be very soon&quot; Emily grinned as she hit the execute button and a flash enveloped the room.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
An hour later found Jeff slowly waking up from his nap. As he came to he was praying the previous events had just been a weird nightmare. However the moment he saw the looming crib bars around he knew it had all really happened, that he was still a baby who had been breastfeed by his mother who he unfortunately discovered was secretly an adult baby. Remembering her unwanted sexual attraction to him Jeff quickly looked around to see if she was still in the room. However as he did so he noticed his nursery had changed a bit during his nap. The changing table, dresser and rocking chair where still there but there were other smaller changes. The toys were different, appearing to be for older babies and half of the wallpaper on one side of the room depicted cute bunnies. Also there was another crib placed on the opposite side with a stuffed bunny plush laying inside. All these clues gave Jeff a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach. Then he read the name spelled out in colorful letters above the other crib and his stomach dropped.<br />
<br />
Janet.<br />
<br />
Suddenly wanting to get the heck out of here Jeff quickly sat up and crawled to the side of the crib. It took him a moment to realize his new form of mobility and that he was older now. A quick glance proved he was no longer a newborn but a baby around he guessed six months. While it was better then his previous age he was still a diaper dependent baby who couldn&#39;t talk. Returning to the task at hand Jeff started trying to think of a way to escape from his crib, take back the remote from Emily and restore his age. He used his arms to hoist himself into a standing position while holding onto the bars for support when the door to the room suddenly opened. The shock caused Jeff to release his grip and fall back on his padded behind with a crinkle.<br />
<br />
Looking to see who it was Jeff was surprised to see a two year old toddler girl walk in, wearing nothing but a diaper and sucking on a pink pacifier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; he babbled.<br />
<br />
The baby girl took one look in his direction and beamed. &quot;Jeffy yoo awake&quot; she said excited after taking out her pacifier and toddling over to stand beside the crib.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...is that really you?&quot; he asked in a stunned tone. Of course he knew his mother had been regressed back to babyhood too, but seeing it was still shocking to say the least.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet woo are wondering what&#39;s going on&quot; she replied with an unmistakable lisp. &quot;Hold on. Wet me get you out of dat crib first den I xplain.&quot; Undoing a latch on the underside the side was lowered upon which his mother (god could he still called her that) reached in and lifted him out before setting him down on the floor. Once he was comfortably situated did she start talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Big sis Emilwee xplained every ting to me while yoo were taking a nap. She told me bout whacha twied to do and while at furst I was mad, I swoon wealized dat her punishmint for yoo was good ideal. Yoo get ta bee a baybee again and now so doo I&quot; Janet smiled showing off her new baby teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean just wook at me, I weally trulee am a baybee again&quot; she said doing a cute little twirl. &quot;I can pway all day, take naps, dwink from a bottle, and go potty whenever I want&quot; Janet patted the back of her diaper for emphasis. &quot;It fweels so good ta bee back in dem and need dem for weal. I even already went peepee in mine a while ago and our new mommy changed me&quot; she replied while reaching down to rub the front of her diaper with a thoughtful farway look in her eyes. She then looked down at him with a hungry look.<br />
<br />
Jeff realizing with horror that his mom was same horny woman as before, just now in a two year old body sent shivers down his spine. Instinctively he backed up a little, the motion catching Janet&#39;s attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don&#39;t be scared Jeffy, Imma gonna bee the best baby sister eva, you&#39;ll see. I&#39;ll show yoo just how fun being a baybee and diapees can be, twust me you&#39;ll neva want ta grow up&quot; she grinned excited. &quot;Now that yoor awake how about we pway with each other?&quot; Janet replied with a big smile.<br />
<br />
Seeing that his mother had completely lost it and gone over to Emily&#39;s side Jeff did the only thing he could do in that situation, he began crawling away as fast as he could. A childish giggle erupted behind him as Janet laughed, &quot;Yoo wan me to catch yoo, okay Jeffy.&quot; The toddler then proceeded to chase after her new baby brother. She could easily have caught him right away with her ability to walk giving her an unfair advantage. However she pretended to catch him a couple of times then let quickly let him go to resume crawling away once again. But every time she caught Jeff she would rub and squeeze the back of his diaper which would re-energize the baby boy into escaping. It was so much fun and made her feel funny in her own padding!<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the room next door Emily was watching the whole thing unfold on a nanny cam that was installed in the nursery. She was laughing and snickering at her baby brother&#39;s torment while her new baby sister experienced her dream come true.<br />
<br />
Back in the nursery Jeff was starting to lose stream as his crawling slowed. Yet he pushed on as he didn&#39;t want the horny baby girl to catch him for real, afraid the things she would do to him. Looking behind him he saw Janet slowly toddle toward him. Just as she was moving to reach down and grab him Jeff saw her suddenly freeze in place. Her face then screwed up in concentration as she balled her fists and squatted down a little. The toddler let out a few low grunts as the crinkling of expanding plastic could be heard. Tilting his head to the side Jeff saw a lump like bulge appear in the back of her diaper, realizing his mother had just pooped herself. This was further confirmed as Janet stood up and announced, &quot;I mada poopoo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bewildered by this stinky turn of events Jeff was even more surprised by what happened next.</p>
