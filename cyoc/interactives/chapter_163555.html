<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I think I&#39;m going for some clothes...&quot; Steven sighed. &quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do here for now.&quot; He looked down and watched the clothes that scientist put on him. The gray sweats were loose and big even for his new size and the yoga pants were too tight that his new endowment was bulging like if he wasn&#39;t wearing anything. &quot;At least, he didn&#39;t throw me with only a blanket.&quot; He tried to adjust his bulge in his tight pants but he only got a disgusting feeling of holding an adult cock. Although he was aged to his mid 20&#39;s but his mind was still the one of a preteen boy. Feeling such a big thing hanging between his legs was kinda traumatic for him. He felt raped, humiliated and ashamed. He started to walked through the streets, feeling awkward of moving a bigger body than the one he was used to. His feet felt big and clumsy, his legs were too thick that they rubbed each other for a while until he started to walk with some strut. He didn&#39;t want to, it made him felt so embarrassed but it was more embarrassing to crush his nuts with each step he made. As he walked some people glanced at him, he didn&#39;t know what they&#39;re thinking about him but it only makes him felt worse. A unknown man walking without shoes, wearing randomly chosen clothing that didn&#39;t fit him properly, he was glad that there weren&#39;t cops at sight. After walking in the sun for a while, he finally arrived to his home. He made a few step towards thd front door when he thought that if his parents saw him coming in they definitely won&#39;t recognize him and he would be in more troubles. No, he can&#39;t go through the front door. Fortunately, he had another way to come in. His bedroom was upstairs and he always let his window open. He only needed to climb his mother beloved tree and reached it. Carefully, he sneaked to his backyard, paying extra attention to any window where his parents could see him. &quot;What&#39;s that smell?&quot; He heard his mother asking his father and he replied. &quot;It&#39;s smells like my high school locker room. Maybe the neighbors are exercising outside.&quot; &quot;Well, they need to buy a new deodorant, they smelled pretty bad!&quot; Steven was so ashamed to hear that comments about him. He raised his arms and sniffed his pits. &quot;Ugh! I can&#39;t even stand my own smell!&quot; He realized that his clothes were now soaked in sweat, especially his pits, chest and crotch. &quot;I smell worse than a stinky cheese&quot; He tried to ignore the pungent aroma although he needed to raise his arms and smelled it constantly as he climbed the tree. When he finally arrived to his room he landed so hard that the floor rumbled. He was worried that his parents heard that, so he tried to be more careful. It was like seeing a gorilla on a ice rink. His big man feet collided with everything. His bed, walls, nightstands, even a slice of pizza that he regretted not throwing it away. He definitely didn&#39;t need that his feet smelled more like cheese... He looked through his closet and the pile of clothes on his floor but nothing seemed big enough for him now. He soon realized that his only optiom is to take some of his father&#39;s. So, he carefully sneaked out of his bedroom and went to his parents&#39; room. He didn&#39;t want to stay long there. So, he ran to his parents&#39; dresser and looked for his father&#39;s clothes. First of all, he wanted underwear, something that can contain the sweaty fat salami between his thighs. His father had a lot of clean underwear, mostly briefs. He felt uncomfortable of touching something that used to cover his father&#39;s junk. A brief thought of his father&#39;s manhood being as big as his made him shudder. Then he remembered the scientist&#39;s word. &quot;You may even be a dad one day yourself.&quot; and he stepped back. He wasn&#39;t ready to be an adult, he hardly knew how babies are born. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so big? He wondered as he stared at his fat schlong. He ignored those thoughts and tried to put on the briefs that he had in his hands. He hesitated for an instant but he took his pants down exposing his sweaty brawny legs covered in a layer of hair grossly stuck on his skin due to all his sweating. His crotch smelled terrible, almost as bad as his armpits. His hefty balls started bouncing the moment they&#39;re free from their confinement. He blushed for umpteenth time that day before he raised a leg to put it through the briefs hole. He struggled a little with his feet but he managed to put his both legs and then he slowly put the briefs up until it covered his junk or, at least, that was his intention. Because the briefs weren&#39;t big enough and his thick bush of pubes were disgustingly protruding from above. Those hairs were a curse! He thought about looking for another pair of briefs but he feared the same would happen. &quot;I&#39;m going to take my bag, it&#39;s in my nightstand.&quot; He heard his mother saying. She must be close and could catch him in any second. He started to panic. What would he do? He didn&#39;t have time enough to choose the clothes, so he randomly took some pants, sandals and a t-shirt and tried to escape. He made a few step toward the door until he realized it was a stupid idea. His only other option was to jump out of the window. He hadn&#39;t jumped so high before. It was insane! But he was running out of time.</p>
