<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Carrie scanned the park searching for new lives to alter forever on a whim, the rush of power was intoxicating and she was far from wanting a break from her new god-like power. After a short time her gaze fell upon a young, college-aged couple who had recently sat down at a picnic table. <br />
<br />
As Carrie watched the two it became clear that only one member of the pair wanted to be there that day. The woman, approximately 5&#39; 5&quot; with a rather petite build with dirty blonde hair draping down to her waist, was disinterestedly swiping at her phone while her boyfriend, standing fairly lanky at roughly 5&#39; 11&quot; with short brown hair and a clean shave, spouted out desperate suggestions as to how they could spend the remainder of their day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, young love... such a fleeting thing&quot; Carrie snidely joked to the hamster hiding in her pocket, &quot;I think I may have come up with a way of making their relationship more lasting&quot;. Carrie quickly dialed the desired effects into the remote, making sure to turn off public awareness so that any passersby wouldn&#39;t interrupt her little game,  and took aim at the unsuspecting couple, deciding to take care of the overbearing boyfriend first.<br />
<br />
 As the young man prattled on it quickly became clear that something was off. The first thing to go was his voice as it began to crack and shift towards a more feminine tone. The girlfriend laughed, &quot;HAH, I warned you to shut up before you lost your voice&quot;, still unaware as to what was really happening. The man shot back, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m not joking there&#39;s seriously- WOAH&quot;. He was surprised both by the sound of his voice and by the sudden sense of vertigo as he dropped in height, causing him to fall backwards into his now over-sized clothing. His tall, thin form compressed itself until he stood at 5&#39; even, a full 11 inches shorter than he had been a moment ago. As he sat there dazed his body began to change rapidly. His shoulders narrowed while his hips widened giving him somewhat of a pear-shaped body type. Hair exploded from his head falling around his neck in loose curls while the rest of his body hair retracted and thinned out leaving behind soft, smooth skin. His hands and feet shrank becoming much more delicate and ladylike. His entire face seemed to grow younger as he lost his facial hair, his eyelashes growing thicker while what little stubble he had faded away. His chest swelled leaving him with a modest B-cup bust, his shirt chaffing against his new larger nipples. A quick grasp down below and it became clear that he had lost the final thing that defined him as a man.<br />
<br />
As the former boyfriend stood in his now tent of a shirt with his pants around his ankles the two of them entered full panic mode. &quot;What the hell just happened! HOW is this happening!?!&quot; the girlfriend called out, grabbing who could be more accurately described as her <br />
 new girlfriend by the shoulders. &quot;I... I...&quot; the former man was in a state of shock and fear as he stared down at his new form, his new curves being on display as his t-shirt draped over them.<br />
<br />
Carrie could hardly hold back her laughter as she saw the two in a state of disarray but her fun was only about halfway over. Going back to the remote she punched in new settings and took aim at the girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;This must be the weirdest fever dream I&#39;ve ever had&quot; argued the girlfriend, &quot;If its anyone&#39;s dream, it&#39;s MY nightmare. I&#39;m going to wake up any second now.&quot; said the former boyfriend with one arm holding up his pants and the other crossed over his chest trying to hide his erect nipples. &quot;I&#39;m starting to feel like this isnt aaAAAAAH&quot; the girlfriend exclaimed as she quickly shrank and felt enveloped in a massive blanket. From the boyfriend&#39;s point of view the woman had shrank completely into her clothing. What came out next was a piercing scream. The former man quickly dug through his girlfriends clothes and pulled out a small, pinkish baby that couldn&#39;t be more than a few days old.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go,&quot; whispered Carrie to Todd, &quot;A mother-daughter relationship is much more set in stone.&quot; The cries of the newly newborn baby continued to ring out as the former man awkwardly tried to console her. Carrie thought to herself sarcastically &quot;Now this just won&#39;t do, that baby must be vewwy hungwy.&quot; Carrie took yet another shot at the new &quot;mother&quot; with the remote. His breasts ballooned out from a B-cup to an overwhelmingly large pair of DDD-cups that were cartoonish on his small frame. Within moments wet spots began to appear on both sides of his shirt that now hung off the front of his body like a curtain.<br />
<br />
&quot;One last change and these two will be on their way. Let&#39;s see here... clothing change, check. Subject awareness, mostly aware. Reality adjustment, check. There, should be all set!&quot; Carrie exclaimed before pointing the remote at the once couple one last time. Both sets of clothes seemed to spring to life as they quickly cloaked the pair, the former boyfriend now swathed in a cropped tank top + sports bra that strained at the weight of her breasts and tight athletic leggings that left little to any onlooker&#39;s imagination while the former girlfriend was now swaddled in an adorable pink lion onesie. A stroller and diaper bag appeared by the picnic table out of thin air as reality changed to accommodate the new mother and daughter. The mother sat down with a visible look of confusion as vague new memories rushed into her head, though still overshadowed by her memories as a man she would be able to adjust to her new life eventually and with a body as stacked as the one she now possessed it wouldn&#39;t be hard to find a man willing to accept her and her daughter and settle down. The daughter continued to wail as the instincts of her new body were not yet strong enough to subdue her fear and confusion. The new mother strapped the crying daughter into her stroller and assured her that &quot;They will find a way to make this life work&quot; and while that didn&#39;t completely stem the tide of the daughter&#39;s tears it did quiet her down enough for them to be able to leave the park without any more glaring stares.<br />
<br />
&quot;See Todd, I&#39;m not THAT evil, I give *some* people their happy ending&quot; explained Carrie. Todd doubted the sincerity of Carrie&#39;s words.</p>
