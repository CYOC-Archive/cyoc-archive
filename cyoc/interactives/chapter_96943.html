<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">William Anderson stared at his wife, lying on the bed reading. There was a growing tension in his pants as the claw mark on his hip started to burn.<br />
However, the passion William felt was <b>not</b> for his wife.<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; he said, taking off his tie and letting it drop to the floor without a second thought. &quot;I have a wonderful idea. Why don&#39;t I go downstairs long enough to bring back the bottle of wine we have left in the fridge and then...&quot; William left the rest unspoken as he started unbuttoning his shirt.<br />
<br />
Martha Anderson looked up at her husband. The handbook about the community of Moon Lake that Nate brought back with him when he came home from Samantha and Frances&#39; house (after hanging out with Ben) was interesting.<br />
Then again, Martha was feeling a lot more interested in Samantha and Frances than anything else.<br />
They were already becoming fast friends, and if not for the fact that the two women were also werecats, Martha thought she would have given in to her Sapphic urges already. It had been a very long time since her last lesbian foray back in college. Meeting and marrying William, then giving birth to and raising their sons had put a serious damper on any thoughts of experiencing again the sexual pleasures only another woman could give her.<br />
In fact, until moving to Moon Lake and meeting Samantha and Frances, Martha thought that part of her past dead and buried. Was it something about the two women, or their were side that was stirring her desires again? Martha didn&#39;t know. She had always loved cats, and even studied to become a veterinarian until meeting William, and the unexpected development of Nate&#39;s impending arrival changed her plans.<br />
He had done right by her, and her family was happy. <i>But have I been?</i> she wondered.<br />
There was no doubt in Martha&#39;s mind that she loved her sons dearly. Although she had offers in the past from other men, even from some of William&#39;s best friends and co-workers, Martha had stayed faithful to her husband throughout their marriage. Unfortunately he did stray a couple of times, yet they were still together.<br />
<i>Perhaps I still love him,</i> she thought. <i>I&#39;d hate to think I&#39;ve put up with his infidelity just for the sake of Eric and Nate.</i><br />
The fact that her husband was now standing in front of her topless, kicking off his shoes as the bulge in his pants grew larger, peeked her interests.<br />
<i>It will be good for me to get my mind off Samantha and Frances, at least for tonight,</i> she realized, as Martha stood up and started taking off her dress. <i>William can take care of me tonight, and then I&#39;ll see if I still have another itch that needs scratching tomorrow.</i> she thought, privately laughing at her unintentional joke.<br />
&quot;The sooner you come back the wine, the sooner you can drink it from your special chalice,&quot; she said with a seductive smile, while stroking her underwear covered vagina.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; promised William, as he left their bedroom barefoot, just wearing his pants.<br />
<br />
However, once he was downstairs, William forgot all about getting the wine and going back to his wife.<br />
He opened the backdoor to the kitchen and walked into their unfenced backyard, taking off his pants and underwear in route.<br />
William stood there in the middle of the backyard totally naked, waiting, when the bushes near the edge of the Anderson&#39;s property line rustled.<br />
Then Yvette appeared in all her furry werevixen glory. Her breasts heaving with every anxious breath, her curvy hips swaying with every step towards her prey.<br />
&quot;Hello lover,&quot; she said, a furry paw stroking William&#39;s still human cheek. &quot;I see you sensed my presence and came to meet me. Why don&#39;t we go off into the woods and put this to good use,&quot; she added, as her other paw reached down to caress his hard cock. &quot;I can promise you it will be an experience you will never forget, but one that you will get to repeat often,&quot; swore Yvette, as she started kissing him.<br />
William&#39;s only response was to return the kiss with a deep, open mouth French style reply. Their tongues dancing back and forth within each other&#39;s mouths.<br />
Then Yvette the werevixen grabbed William, the soon to be werefox, by one of his still human hands and led him into the woods.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Martha had stripped completely naked and was dabbing a little perfume behind her ears and along the cleft between her ample bosom.<br />
Then she went to close the bedroom curtains, but spied something moving in the backyard.<br />
The light spilling down from the bedroom window showed a naked William a step behind, but following someone away from the house.<br />
The only clues Martha had in regards to who the other person was were the fact that the body shape was definitely female, and that the other woman had a tail!<br />
<b>Why that!</b> Martha screamed, before she fell to the floor in tears.<br />
If Eric and Nate heard her anguished cry, they never came to the bedroom door to find out if she was okay.<br />
How long Martha laid at the base of the window in a crumpled heap, crying, she didn&#39;t know.<br />
When she finally stood up again, William and the other woman were long gone.<br />
Not knowing what else to do, Martha Anderson laid on her bed totally naked, and then reached for the phone on the nightstand to call perhaps the only friends she might have in all of Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
Samantha and Frances were laying in their bed, cuddling after a heated session of lesbian werecat sex, when the phone rang.<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t answer that,&quot; Frances begged her wife while stroking one of Samantha&#39;s breasts with a furry paw. &quot;Let the machine pick it up and we&#39;ll take care of it tomorrow.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to honey,&quot; admitted Samantha, caressing her wife with one hand, as the other reached over to pick up the phone. &quot;But not that many people have our private number, and this late it might be an emergency.&quot;<br />
Truer words were never spoken as Samantha listened intently to Martha Anderson crying, getting what she could of the story between the other woman&#39;s tears.<br />
When Martha finished sobbing, Samantha promised, &quot;We&#39;ll be there as soon as we can.&quot;<br />
Then she was already changing back to her human form as she stood and hung up the phone. &quot;You better change and get dressed too,&quot; Samantha advised Frances as she reached for her clothes. &quot;Your services as a therapist might be needed.&quot;<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; asked Frances, while heeding her wife&#39;s advice.<br />
&quot;Apparently William Anderson just ran off with a were,&quot; revealed Samantha.<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; said Frances in shock. &quot;Any idea who?&quot;<br />
&quot;Martha didn&#39;t know,&quot; said Samantha, before giving her the rest of the story.<br />
When Samantha finished, she was almost completely dressed, while Frances was only about half done. &quot;You do know what will happen if...&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, and I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m torn,&quot; said Samantha. &quot;On one hand, we need to get over there to console our friend. Depending upon the circumstances, this might be the end of their marriage. On the other hand, we don&#39;t want William coming back and exposing Martha to whatever species he was with in case she ever does decide to join us, let alone become a werecat.&quot;<br />
&quot;True. Has anyone announced any interest in the rest of the Anderson family?&quot; asked Frances, as she completed getting dressed.<br />
&quot;Not through official channels, but I can check with the college when I get the chance to see if anything happened there that we don&#39;t know about,&quot; answered Samantha, grabbing her cell phone and house keys off their dresser. &quot;This might be the work of a rouge, and you know how the Elders feel about them.&quot;<br />
&quot;Which is why we have to tread carefully even if we are able to successfully recruit Martha,&quot; added Frances, grabbing her purse off the dresser. &quot;What do we do about Ben?&quot;<br />
&quot;If he&#39;s up, we&#39;ll talk to him on our way out. If not, we&#39;ll leave him a note,&quot; replied Samantha. &quot;Either way, he can fix himself breakfast and catch the bus to school in the morning without us. In any case, we better get over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Author&#39;s personal note: Whether it is me or another contributor who writes that specific episode, while I seriously doubt it will happen in the night described above, I would love to eventually see Martha join Samantha and Frances as a werecat, even if she does stay married to William Anderson the (new) werefox. Thanks in advance.—tmw2015</p>
