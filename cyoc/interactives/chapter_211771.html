<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt washed his face in the sink, trying to make sure he was awake and not dreaming. He was sure it had to be some sort of weird nightmare fueled by the weird Korean snacks they had given him earlier. As he dried his face, however, he was sure he was still awake, and starting to freak out about what was happening. He looked at himself in the mirror, and something felt.... off....<br />
&quot;Was my hair always this dark?&quot; he asked himself, noticing his hair had gone from a medium brown to a dark brown, bordering black.<br />
&quot;It must be a trick of the light since I got it wet&quot; he rationalized, trying not to think about what was going on outside the cramped bathroom.<br />
He sat on the toilet to calm down, as his hair got even darker and started growing thicker.<br />
Suddenly, he was brought out of his mind by a loud ding, accompanied by a loudspeaker announcement that they were soon starting their final descent into Seoul, asking all passengers to return to their seats and strap on their seatbelts. Matt had not even noticed that the announcement was in Korean. However, he did notice the bathroom felt slightly less cramped. &quot;Maybe it just felt smaller because I was nervous,&quot; he rationalized, not realizing that his height had dropped from 6&#39;2&quot; to 174cm (5&#39;8&quot;).<br />
As he looked at himself in the mirror again, he found even more changes. The stubble in his chin was gone, replaced by smooth, even skin. His hair looked much more full and stylish, and his face looked thinner.<br />
&quot;&#47924;&#49832; &#51068;&#51060;&#50556;??&quot; he asked himself out loud. And then his eyes went wide as he realized he was not speaking english.<br />
He looked back at the mirror as his eyes thinned slightly, gaining a more Korean look, and went from his previous green to a dark brown. He clutched his chest as he started hyperventilating, slowly feeling more muscle than he was used to, but panicking too much to think about it.<br />
Suddenly, a loud knock on the door broke him out of his panic.<br />
&quot;Sir, you need to go back to your seat&quot; said the stewardess loudly in Korean.<br />
&quot;&#51104;&#49884;&#47564;&quot;, he replied, getting his bearings.<br />
He lifted his shirt to see strong pecs and washboard abs, noticing his skin tone was clearer and slightly paler. Still, he couldn&#39;t linger, and so he exited the bathroom to face an annoyed-looking stewardess glaring at him. &quot;&#51396;&#49569;&#54633;&#45768;&#45796;!&quot; He quickly apologized as he hurried to his seat.<br />
As he sat down in  his seat waiting for the plane to land, he was still trying to think about what was happening to him. As he was lost in his thoughts, he didn&#39;t even realize as his clothes were changing. He was only dropping his parents off earlier that morning, so he hadn&#39;t really bothered to dress up in anything more than sweatpants, a long-sleeved tee, and some slippers. However, as he anxiously contemplated his transformation and that of seemingly everyone around him, his outfit slowly became more fashionable. from the bottom, the material of the slippers changed from cotton and memory foam into leather, as they crept slightly up his ankles into stylish boots. high-end socks appeared underneath up his shins, and his sweats similarly changed from grey cotton to black denim, clinging tighter onto his stronger legs.<br />
Matt, of course, had not even paid attention to this as he noticed his hair slowly getting lighter. &quot;Is it going back to normal?&quot; he thought, still in korean.<br />
As he was still distracted, his shirt too was changing. as it crept slightly up his neck, the material became darker and softer, and then it split into two pieces. The shirt underneath clung tightly onto his now toned body, as the new outer layer became a baggy red sweater.<br />
As the plane finally made contact with the ground, Matt was shaken out of his distraction as the loudspeakers welcomed the passengers to Seoul. As he was finally making his way off his seat, he grabbed his backpack from under the seat in front of him, as if on autopilot. He didn&#39;t recall having a backpack as he arrived at the airport, but he was certain that this expensive-looking leather bag was his.<br />
Walking through the airport corridors, he notices his reflection on some of the glass windows. His hair was completely blond now, almost white. He wanted to stop and take a closer look at himself, but he knew that he couldn&#39;t stop and block the pedestrian traffic.<br />
Eventually, he made it to the passport control. He pulled a passport from the bag he was now carrying, and handed it over without thinking. He did notice the agent blush, but thought nothing of it.<br />
&quot;Welcome back to Korea Mr. Park. If you can please stand in front of this camera,&quot; she said as she took his picture before stamping his passport and sending him on his way. He looked at his passport and saw a handsome Korean guy staring back at him. The name Park Ji Min glaring at him in Korean letters. he had a small headache as he walked on to the baggage claim area.<br />
Matt? was grateful to find a bathroom as he waited for the luggage to come out. First he relieved himself, confused but not complaining about how large his tool felt in his hands. He went on to wash his hands as a sharp pain rang through his head.<br />
He put his hands on the sink to support himself, noticing his hands looked much more taken care of and his nails were cleanly manicured. He took a deep breath and looked up at himself. He saw pink. Why was his hair pink? He reached up to grab it and noticed something shiny off the side of his hair. That&#39;s when he realized he was wearing earrings too. Before he could dwell on that, an announcement rang through from the speakers.<br />
&quot;Luggage from Korean Air flight 1069 is now arriving at baggage claim 3.&quot;<br />
Ji Mat quickly finished washing his hands and walking towards baggage claim. He saw an expensive looking bag with a priority tag on it, somehow recognizing it as his own, although he doesn&#39;t recall ever seeing that bag before. Confirming it had his name on it, however, he remembered having bought it from one of his favorite luxury stores exclusively for this trip. But wait, didn&#39;t he get on this plane earlier by coincidence? He grabbed his head again, a slight uncomfortable feeling as his hand collided with his sunglasses. No, that didn&#39;t make sense, Ji Mit thought as his headache cleared. He clearly remembered some guy giving him a ticket as he dropped off his parents... and why was there a priority tag on the bag? didn&#39;t he fly regular economy?<br />
Unaware that he had been walking towards the exit, Matt was finally starting to make sense of everything, until he walked out the door and heard loud cheers and squeals. His ears rang as he looked out at his many fans. Matt&#39;s thoughts were slowly disappearing as he remembered that he wasn&#39;t some random american kid but one of the top idols in Korea. His face and body finished adjusting as his mind fully became that of the boyband member&#39;s, greeting his fans as he walked towards the car where his manager would be waiting to pick him up. As he entered the car he was greeted by his manager, the face oddly familiar as the guy who gabe him his plane ticket just hours before. Well, of course it would be his manager that would hand him his ticket, that&#39;s part of what a manager does! Jimin happily laid back on the car, happy that his schedule was clear for the day and he could rest up at his apartment before their next concert. He didn&#39;t notice the smirk on his driving manager&#39;s face as he closed his eyes and dozed off.</p>
