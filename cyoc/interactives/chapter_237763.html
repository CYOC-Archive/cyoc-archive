<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Georges penis must have been quite a grower. When you had first changed into George his penis size was not something you had particularly noticed, however now it felt enormous. You could feel it trying to escape the constrictions of the underwear you were wearing. It was obvious the Colby had noticed the swelling in your groin as well. Her eyes scrutinised your groin and her lips had a playful smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I could do it with my Mom. Maybe you could use the socks and and change into someone else?&quot; you suggested. &quot;I&#39;d be willing to have sex with any other woman&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I&#39;m not your Mom. We are not related at all .... George&quot; she emphasised the name &quot;Surely a young virile teenager like yourself is up for it? We have the house to ourselves. We wouldn&#39;t get a better opportunity. Don&#39;t you want to loose your virginity? I know I do&quot;<br />
<br />
She had a good argument. And she was hot. You had not realised just how much of a MILF your mother was. As much as you wanted her you felt rather uncomfortable &quot;But my mind still thinks your my Mom. No! I&#39;m not going to do it! I think I&#39;ll go and have a cold shower!&quot; You turned from her and headed to the bathroom. You needed to get your mind off of Colby. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re no fun!&quot; Colby called out to your back. You shut the bathroom door without looking at her.<br />
<br />
George&#39;s dick did seem enormous, it had to be at least 7 inches long and close to 2 inches in diameter. Under the cold shower it took less than 2 minutes before you ejaculated into your hand. Troublingly, it was the mental image of your mother/Colby that caused the eruption.    You may not have practiced incest physically but mentally you were very guilty. You tried to assuage yourself that you were not guilty of a crime. Currently you were George and it was his body that was reacting to Colby. Also, Colby was just a beautiful woman who just happened to look like your mother. She wasn&#39;t your real mother.<br />
<br />
At least you were now spent and hopefully could resist temptation for the rest of the evening.<br />
<br />
After the shower, you took your time and examined Georges body carefully. You were now tall and lean with reddish blonde hair. When you pumped up George&#39;s muscles they were actually quite impressive. It was wierd though to imagine that this body was actually now yours. <br />
<br />
You put Georges clothes back on and decided to head to the kitchen. Maybe Colby/Mom was cooking something for dinner? You felt hungry. If Colby wasn&#39;t cooking you supposed you could make something. <br />
<br />
Colby wasn&#39;t in the kitchen. Initially you feared she might have gone out but then you heard the shower running in the master bedroom. You supposed she needed to &quot;Cool off&quot; as well. Although you were not sure how you felt about the idea of your friend masturbating in your mother&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
You spent the next 30 minutes preparing dinner. Having Georges extra inches helped when it came to collecting items from the high cupboards. You made a meal out of noodles, mince meat and canned vegetables. You anticipated George&#39;s body would approve.<br />
<br />
The shower in the master bedroom had stopped long ago but Colby had not reappeared. You set the dining table, before knocking on the door of the master bedroom and saying &quot;Dinner&#39;s almost ready&quot; <br />
<br />
Colby replied in your mother&#39;s voice &quot;Give me another minute&quot; then adding &quot;Do you have any wine? I feel like a glass. I can replace anything we drink tomorrow&quot;<br />
<br />
Your parents did have a bit of a wine cellar, although you were in the habit of raiding it. But if Colby was going to replace a bottle, then why not? It was not as if anyone was going to question her age while she wore your mother&#39;s body. You made your way to the cellar. It seemed a red wine would go well with the dinner. You chose a bottle that your father seemed to have a dozen bottles of. Hopefully it could easily be replaced.<br />
<br />
Colby still hadn&#39;t come out of your parents room when you returned. Your poured two glasses of wine then dished out two meals. Only then did you call out &quot;Dinners on the table&quot;<br />
<br />
Colby finally reappeared. You felt yourself give a sharp intake of breath when she walked across to the dining table swaying her hips seductively. She was wearing a dark blue lace dress you could remember your mother wearing to your Aunt&#39;s wedding. She was also wearing 4 inch stilletto heels that you didn&#39;t even know your mother owned. &quot;Sorry I took so long. I wanted to make sure I did my make-up correctly&quot;<br />
<br />
You realised Colby was wearing dark red lipstick, mascara and eyeshadow. Her hair was also tied up in a bun, which might have looked severe on another woman but looked sexy on her. Her shiny earrings were on display. You recognised them as the diamond pendants your father had bought for your mother on their last anniversary. She looked sexier than ever. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been going through my mother&#39;s things&quot; you complained<br />
<br />
&quot;I was careful to put everything back exactly as I found it. Besides I&#39;m not your mother remember. I just want to look sexy for my young man&quot; She gave you an alluring grin<br />
<br />
You were lost for words &quot;You do&quot; you eventually muttered. It seemed George had remarkable powers of rejuvenation. The reappearance of Colby had reawoken your penis. You decided to change the subject &quot;Better eat while the meal is hot. I poured you a glass of wine&quot;<br />
<br />
Still standing Colby picked up the glass, swirled the liquid and smelt the aroma as if she was an experienced wine connoisseur. She seemed, satisfied gave you a grin, then offered a toast &quot;Cheers!&quot;</p>
