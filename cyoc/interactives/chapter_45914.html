<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A vision appeared to Ric, he seeing again Mr. Mendes, he had a rider on his back, and pranced as if eager to seek the adventure sent before him, one of living as a horse and stallion. As the wooden doors open and allowed both horse and rider to the bull ring, the gallant acting stallion turned its head, looking backwards along his flanks. As if the horse wished to speak his thoughts, it gave a shill whinny, snorted, and nodding its head up and down; the actions made Ric to believe the man and horse had become as one.<br />
<br />
Exactly like the Devil-Demon remarked, Mr. Mendes changed twice, and from his first transformation all happened because they budding young wizard had not a complete understanding of what all was in that very special book. <br />
<br />
&quot;Read it but once and for shame on all, fail to read it again correctly, and the shame will fall upon you. Shame is yours as your friend Josh is as he always thought would be so much horny fun. He is as a stud jackass, thinking primarily with his bigger balls. Lust and unbridled passion are his to enjoy, he realizing his new anonymity, being as an animal he can do as he would so please, not bound by rules, laws, and human morality.<br />
<br />
Let him run free and once he mounts any of his kind, that kind be his from that moment and to his death. Once full animalistic obscurity becomes his perceived desire for living the remainder of a beastly life, the memories begin to fade into a dim oblivion.&quot; The voice warned Ric, he needed to read the book, gaining then an understanding og what it could do, and the suggestive likelihood of what transforming a person into something other than as what they were born, might make a new reality for more than the changed individual.<br />
<br />
Ric thought for a moment, he dared not speak another spell on Josh, for the same as what befell Mr. Mendes might be true for Josh, he quite likely would relish remaining as his donkey self.<br />
<br />
Placing the book on the kitchen table, Ric began to read the introduction.<br />
<br />
Josh, acting accordingly to what all he felt and having so often had time to fantasize a sexually orientated wish to become as a stud donkey, he stood near, his maleness in a full bloomed erection. He continued to toy with his might tool, realizing the thrill and enjoyments he had only wished would be true, were true enough to make him want for his being a donkey to become permanent. Parading about the house, Josh began to accost his studious friend, lip nibbling as the head of Ric, trying to get Ric to look at how Josh sported a two foot long, bulbous mushroom shaped glandular end to his wagging donkey penis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit, please stop annoying me, I need to read this through! Do you hear me, do you understand that unless I understand this, that donkey animal you are is what you will become, being bestial of lifestyle, but soon after your first sexual conquest, what you know will fade into becoming then as an ignorant donkey. Do you want to become so ignorant you cannot realize your own existence, having forgotten all, no family, no mother, no dad, just a beast filled with lust, hunger, and a big dic!&quot; Ric asked of Josh, he annoyed by his friend forgetting the situation he had made of his life, and wanted him to realize what might well happen next.<br />
<br />
Sixteen pages read then of the two hundred more to grant a young novice wizard the primary stages of what transforming offered to either the caster of it or the victim.<br />
<br />
Josh gained a little understanding to his donkey perils, he with his fore hoofs firmly set on a kitchen chair, his hind donkey legs stretched long behind him, he continued to have and waggle his donkey dong; it dribbling sliky liquid onto the kitchen floor.<br />
<br />
At page thirty two, Ric turning the page to the next, and a wrapping hard knocking of knuckles at the back door made Ric jump, yelling something crude, and giving away the fact he was at home.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey buddies, Ric, Josh, can you let me in, I thought we could do some role playing stuff!&quot; John Jonson said, he a school chum mostly to Josh rather than a more serious person as was Ric.<br />
<br />
Going to the back door of the house, standing with the door slightly ajar, Ric said to John, &quot;Not today, I do not feel well, I have quite a headache going on here!&quot;<br />
<br />
John might have believed Ric as being under the weather had it not been for Josh with his heightened sense of hearing, heard the voice of a friend, and forgetting the need of secrecy, he began to bray his enthralled greetings.<br />
<br />
Instantly John knew that something weird and neat was happening there, inside the house and home of Ric and his parents. He pressed open the back door, pushing Ric to one side and eager to know more of what he had heard, John walked into the kitchen and confronted then donkey Josh.<br />
<br />
One can but try to imagine the thoughts happening in the head of John, he coming to see a donkey jackass standing in the kitchen, and Josh braying a warm welcome felt a bit more arousal, he ejaculating sever hot streams of semen onto the room floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;What gay and wonderful stuff are you up to today, wow, a donkey jack stud here in the house, I bet its nothing your parents know anything about.&quot; John said, he then saw the leather bound book lying open on the kitchen table. He fingered at it, holding a finger to mark the page being read as he flipped it closed to see and read the book title.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ric, wizardry and a donkey familiar here in your house, what more can you do? Really, I bet if Josh knew, he would have you help him transform and become his favorite animal, he always wanted to be like this type of animal, oh wow! Is that, is that donkey Josh?&quot; John asked, but his asking met with a happy friend so filled with elated delight, he brayed to his friend the joys he felt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh all right, yeas, by our tomfoolery with this book owned by Mr. Mendes, Josh had me, of I did to Josh, well he became as you see him now. Ric replied, he feeling a fair amount of responsibility for what happened, even if Josh found it as to his liking.<br />
<br />
John stood there giving a visual study of Josh in his new form. As Josh waggled his dong, John felt duty-bound to reach a hand to touch the thing, and once in contact to something he too would love to have as his own, he began stroking up and down the hot, fleshy, tube.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, please you two gay jerk-offs, Josh already has near to a gallon of his donkey semen on the floor, and before the folks get home after six o'clock tonight, I need to mop the kitchen floor.&quot; Ric grumbled, he flopping down in a kitchen chair and taking the magic book of spells, he returned to reading of more.<br />
<br />
Josh and John continued their mutual pleasuring, one delighted for help in gaining the full feeling of his having become a donkey; while the other, knelt beside his friend, eying, stroking, and finger tasting some of what lay pooled on the kitchen floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you two are lucky, where did you find this book, you, I would give you everything I have to change me into being a female donkey for Josh to really get some proper use of his mighty shaft. Oh, and who is this Mr. Mendes, I never heard of him, is he someone you just met?&quot; John said, as he having heard a name of someone it seemed as if Ric thought he or they knew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Mr. Mendes is, is..., is no more!&quot; Ric responded, he thought of Mr. Mendes and how he became twice transformed, his changing said by the Devil-Demon that it was then a permanent thing. Oddly too, and not understood when said, but that with the second transforming change, what was reality would change accordingly.<br />
<br />
Thinking as his friend continued to play, Ric gave what happened some added thought, as Mr. Mendes having become since as a stallion horse, his human past ceased to exist, all that he was, all that people knew of him, was then gone.<br />
<br />
Ric returned for a moment to reading the book of spells, yet the noise of two overly sexed friends having enjoyed pleasures became a bigger annoyance to his studying. Several added interuptions more and Ric feeling angered at the two carrying on so, he flipped a few pages back to where he had read the spell that made Josh to act so much more like the Ass he was and wished to become.<br />
<br />
Fingering at the corner of the one page, knowing that if he read it he would doom his friend to being then a donkey in body, mind, and soul. More so, the added spell would send John along for his bestial frolic, he should do well if changed into being a jennet donkey. Ric sat and with his mind imagined the two friends being each as a donkey, of Josh acting then more brutal as if then an animal for real. He thought it a worthwhile education for John, he always willing to pretend his sex changed, he as a female anything would role play the horny side of whatever he would become in a play.<br />
<br />
Reading the first spell, but doing it in a whisper, Ric failed to understand another way which the book held its owner and user to take proper precautions, as anything spoken verbally, mattering not whether yelled aloud or in a secretive whisper, the spell took hold, and did as would the caster of it wish. <br />
<br />
Josh braying then wildly as his friend and he worked his elongated big donkey dic to another major climax, the quoted spell began to take its affect on John first.<br />
<br />
Happy fun times, Josh braying and John then in the heat of sexual excitement, brayed as well. He heard and felt the bray roll out of his throat, he stopping then his sexual frolicking, did turn and casting a evil smirk back at Ric, they first effects became quite real to John.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... did it to me, I know you did, I can feel it beginning..., thanks so much, I should as well like being as a donkey Jack too!&quot; John said to Ric, but not realizing then that his role in the coming passion play between two donkified friends was for him to be on the bottom side of any sexual action to come.</p>
