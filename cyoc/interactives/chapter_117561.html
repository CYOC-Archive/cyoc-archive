<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{For those looking for my usual introductory explanation of our episode title here, just keep reading. I don&#39;t want to spoil the surprise.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
Harold Jenkins didn&#39;t have any idea what came over him.<br />
Then again, he didn&#39;t care either.<br />
The only thought on his mind was making love to the beautiful weretigress in his bed, and that task he completed WAY beyond the expectations of either party.<br />
Now spent but highly satisfied, for the moment at least, the newest weretiger of Moon Lake cradled Virginia McCoy lovingly in his furry arms and held her close, savoring the contact.<br />
The scent of her body, sweaty from their intense bout of full on sex.<br />
The sensual sensation of her fur bristling against his.<br />
The gentle beating of her heart and the slow rise and fall of Virginia&#39;s chest as they rested.<br />
<i>She&#39;s everything Eliza ever was to me, and so much more,</i> realized Harold, staring deeply into Virginia&#39;s feline eyes.<br />
&quot;Harold, is something wrong?&quot; asked Virginia, once she could speak again.<br />
&quot;You mean other than the fact that bitchy were-raccoon Alicia Decrux might escape justice? Not a thing,&quot; he answered, before kissing her deeply.<br />
Kissing in his fursona was something he still needed to get used to, but Harold was becoming a fast learner of muzzle to muzzle gestures.<br />
&quot;But now that the police no longer suspect that you <i>intentionally</i> changed me against my will and we can finally be together, I&#39;ve got to ask. Who is John Sebastian Jenkins? There is absolutely no one in my family named either John or Sebastian, and I even met the patriarch of the other Jenkins family here in Moon Lake*, but there&#39;s no one so named in his family tree either.&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; said Virginia calmly, while snuggling up romantically against her man. &quot;John Sebastian Jenkins hasn&#39;t even been born yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Harold in disbelief. &quot;With everything that&#39;s been going on lately, I barely remember some weird dreams I had, but...&quot;<br />
&quot;Shh darling,&quot; said Virginia, while delicately putting a furry finger against his mouth. &quot;What you experienced is called a prophecy dream. Weres, and some normals who are destined to become weres, have them when they have unanswered questions about their future so they instinctively know the right thing to do when the time comes. Given their nature and the fact that I was possibly facing some serious criminal charges, that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t answer your questions or even remind you of your previous dreams on the subject.&quot;<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; said Harold, thinking over what she said. &quot;It was a rough patch for me,&quot; he agreed. &quot;My feelings starting to grow for you versus my love and unending mourning for my deceased wife continuing well past a healthy point for both myself and Melissa. But how...&quot;<br />
&quot;Before I moved to Moon Lake and became a weretigress, I was a normal human too, remember?&quot; began Virginia. &quot;Every summer I would visit my grandmother in California. She was a hippie, flower child. Whatever you want to call someone who experienced the 1960s first hand. Anyway, although most of it has since been converted to CDs and MP3s, she has quite a record collection from that era. I grew to love and appreciate that generation of music to the point of developing my own music collection too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Okay. But I&#39;m still not following this,&quot; admitted Harold.<br />
&quot;While my grandmother has her own preferences, one of my favorite groups is The Loving Spoonful.&quot;<br />
&quot;Never heard of them,&quot; confessed Harold. &quot;I&#39;m more a classical composition man myself, although Melissa loves some group called Bruce Hornsby and the Range from Eliza&#39;s music collection.&quot;<br />
&quot;I can sympathize with her, because sadly both groups eventually broke up,&quot; replied Virginia. &quot;But when my grandmother first introduced me to their music, I didn&#39;t realize the time gap between then and when they were actually active, so for better or worse, I developed a school girl crush on their lead singer John Sebastian.&quot;<br />
Slowly, but surely, realization dawned on Harold Jenkins. &quot;So someday, John Sebastian Jenkins will be my son?&quot;<br />
&quot;Our son,&quot; Virginia politely corrected him, before giving Harold another hug and kiss.<br />
If it was entirely possible for a were to do so while furry, Harold Jenkins&#39; face would be fully blushing right now.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;Here we are,&quot; announced Trevor Tyson, parking his pick up truck.<br />
&quot;So that body of water in the distance is the Moon Lake the town&#39;s named after?&quot; asked Melissa Jenkins, while unfastening her seat belt.<br />
&quot;Yes. You can&#39;t actually make it out from here, but the lake&#39;s in a crescent shape, like a quarter moon,&quot; explained Trevor, getting out of his truck. &quot;Even with stopping for the sodas, we still have a couple of hours before sunset, so let&#39;s grab our stuff and head for the picnic area,&quot; he suggested.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; said Melissa, <i>and so are you Trevor,</i> she silently added, while getting out of the truck too.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
At first, Virginia McCoy thought Harold just needed time to come to terms with everything she had told him. But when she glanced at the clock on his nightstand and saw that a good 10 minutes had passed since either of them had last spoke, she started to grow concerned.<br />
&quot;Harold?&quot; she asked, gently.<br />
&quot;Hmmm...?&quot; he finally said in return.<br />
&quot;Are you all right?&quot;<br />
&quot;I was just thinking.&quot;<br />
&quot;About what?&quot; she wondered.<br />
&quot;Us,&quot; he replied, looking at nothing in particular.<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
Then Harold Jenkins turned to face her, taking both of the weretigress&#39; paws within his own. &quot;I hope this isn&#39;t too soon, but Virginia McCoy, will you marry me?&quot;<br />
&quot;Harold? Seriously?&quot; she asked, as a tear started to form in the corner of her eye.<br />
&quot;Yes. Please say yes. Despite how we got to this point, you&#39;re the best thing that happened to me since I moved to Moon Lake. I realize now that I still would have eventually fallen in love with you and became a weretiger for you at some point. But fate or whatever decided I wasted too much time mourning and restarted my life. There will always be a place in my heart for Eliza, but there&#39;s plenty of room for you too. Please say yes,&quot; he pleaded.<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; replied Virginia, hugging and kissing her future mate.<br />
Then, much to Harold&#39;s surprise, Virginia started to hum.<br />
&quot;What is that?&quot; he asked, confused.<br />
&quot;My favorite song by John Sebastian and the Loving Spoonful. &#9835;Do you believe in magic, in a young girl&#39;s heart?&#9835;&quot; asked Virginia, as she started to sing.<br />
Harold Jenkins didn&#39;t know the tune, but would later admit that it was a catchy melody, especially when his now fiance got up off the bed and insisted that they dance while she sang.<br />
Harold always had two left feet, or paws; but didn&#39;t care how badly he danced. Virginia&#39;s happiness was contagious and he managed to keep up with her across the bedroom floor.<br />
It would not be until she finished the song for the second time that Harold got to kiss the future Mrs. Virginia Jenkins again, but a wonderful romantic time of emotional and physical love was in their immediate future; and neither of them would leave the bedroom until Melissa came home for the night.<br />
<br />
{{See, I told you I didn&#39;t want to spoil the surprise. Let&#39;s wish the newly engaged couple well, especially since Alice Decrux has yet to face justice.—tmw.}}<br />
