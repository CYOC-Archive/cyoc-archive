<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You put the centaur t-shirt on a clothes hanger and hang it in the closet. Then, you pull out a notebook, and begin writing.<br />
<br />
Top half flesh, bottom half brown: Centauress &lt;3. Horse body strong, but takes time to adapt to having 6 limbs. Lower body clothes seem to shred. Genitals may multiply, but not checked.<br />
Plain blue: Male. This one is creepy, but safe to use in public.<br />
<br />
With only 2 entries, you decide it would be a good idea to investigate the others.<br />
<br />
First comes the white t-shirt. This one is particularly small, but when you put it on, it seems much tighter than it should be. You realise when as you give it a tug, noticing that it&#39;s quite restricting around your chest... which is now huge! Your breasts have to be the size of watermelons, and feel like they weigh as much, too. Still, you seem to be able to support them without needing to lift them with your hands. Despite you wearing a bra, your nipples seem to poke out at the front. You decide to unclasp the bra and take it off to relieve the pressure a bit. As you pull, something cold dribbles out and slightly soaks the front of the shirt. You tweak your nipples a bit and are surprised to see that more liquid comes out, but your breasts aren&#39;t deflating at all! Bringing a finger to your mouth, you find that it tastes of milk – in fact, it is milk!<br />
<br />
You are able to remove the shirt with surprisingly little effort, but your breasts are still large. You decide that you might try to get the milk out of your breasts, so you squeeze your nipples over a jug. You breathe a sigh of relief as doing so seems to be deflating your ridiculous rack, soon morphing into sensual moans as the ejecting milk sends jolts of pleasure throughout your body.<br />
<br />
You took a seat and calmed down after that experience. Taking a sip of the surprisingly delicious milk, you wrote down another entry.<br />
<br />
Plain white: Breasts expand with milk. Fun and sexy. Only wear if guaranteed to have time alone to milk self.<br />
<br />
Next one – plain pink. After putting it on, nothing feels particularly out of place, but you are certain that there was some change. You walk over to the mirror on the front of your closet. Looking in the mirror, you almost drool yourself dry. You look drop-dead gorgeous! Waist-length golden blonde hair, full DD breasts, a voluptuous backside and perfect hourglass figure. Your face, although still recognisable, has become almost model-like in its beauty, and your eyes have turned a brilliant blue. You check yourself out in the mirror for a while. All the girls and guys would be after you if you went into school like this... You let out a slightly uncharacteristic giggle, and you realise your voice is higher. Your thoughts also start to wander, and you think of the girl in the lecture hall... NO. You concentrate again. It looks like wearing the shirt makes you a bit of an airhead, at least when you&#39;re not focussed.<br />
<br />
After that jarring experience, you take the shirt off, assuming your usual looks again. Another note is made.<br />
<br />
Plain pink: Sexiness dialled up to 11, but intelligence drops to bimbo when not paying attention to anything. Voice changes, too. Only wear in the apartment.<br />
<br />
Next, you take out the black shirt and put it on. You feel quite cold after putting it on, and run to the mirror again... only you see nothing. In shock, you look at yourself. Your skin looks extremely pale, so you&#39;re not invisible, at least. You pull out your phone and try look at yourself using the camera. Thankfully, you can. The pale complexion looks like it&#39;s all over your body, and your face hasn&#39;t changed in terms of its structure, but two significant changes do seem to exist. First off, your hair has turned short and somewhat spiky, but without really sticking up, and it&#39;s turned pitch-black, too. Secondly, your irises had turned blood red. You open your mouth to say something, but are shocked by what meets you. Your upper jaw is now sporting fangs in the form of extended canines. Two puncture marks have formed on the left side of your neck, and a tattoo of a bat has emerged on your left arm.<br />
<br />
Your stomach growls, and you feel a craving for food. Running to the fridge, you scan it. Nothing seems appealing anymore, but suddenly, a piece of black pudding catches your eye. It&#39;s not that blood-rich, but you don&#39;t care much as you grab it and wolf it down. A couple of moments later, you feel extremely energised, and decide you should have a little run. You find you can zip around your apartment at lightning speed, and you seem to be able to hover and float around, but not quite as fast. As you get near the window, however, your arm burns up a bit. Looks like you&#39;re a vampire now. You take the shirt off and pick up the notebook again.<br />
<br />
Plain black: Vampire. Awesome mobility after consuming blood, but can&#39;t eat anything else and burns in sunlight. May or may not need to consume some kind of blood before taking shirt off. Only wear at night.<br />
<br />
Now, only five plain shirts are left: yellow, grey, red, green and purple. You decide to pick the yellow one.<br />
<br />
As soon as you do, you feel a warm liquid dribble down your leg. You look down and scream – you&#39;re pissing uncontrollably! You rip the shirt off your head and run into the bathroom, where you immediately sit on the toilet and seem to squeeze your bladder dry. As you do so, you toss the soiled panties and shorts into the laundry basket. You can&#39;t decide if that was sexy or not, but nevertheless, you take a cold shower and write another note.<br />
<br />
Plain yellow: Fills bladder and removes bladder control. Kinky, but impractical. Like pink shirt, only wear at home.<br />
<br />
After putting on a new pair of panties and shorts, you decide that maybe the others might not be so extreme in their effects. Grey comes next. No serious physical effect seems to have taken hold, so you look in the mirror again. Once again, your reflection doesn&#39;t exist! You look back down at your arm, but it&#39;s gone too! The grey shirt must have turned you invisible! Nothing else seems to have happened, though. Well, that was boring, but you could have some fun with it in future. You fumble for the hem of the shirt and remove it, hanging it up with the rest.<br />
<br />
Plain grey: Invisibility, extends to clothes too. Could be used for pranks.<br />
<br />
You put on the red shirt and hope that its effects are more interesting. You aren&#39;t disappointed. Your line of sight seems to have risen, and you feel a lot more energised than before. You turn to the mirror and a downright Amazonian figure looks back. Your body is covered in huge muscles, and you&#39;ve grown taller than almost all of your male classmates. Even flexing an arm slightly makes it seem as though your biceps would shoot through the ceiling. The floor seems to shudder a bit every time you take a step. Unfortunately, the doorframe seems too small for you to walk through normally, so you have to duck and go through sideways. You say a stereotypical action-movie one-liner, and find your voice is deeper, but still distinctly female. You&#39;re worried that you might break something with your strength if you stay like this much longer, so you remove the shirt as gingerly as you can, which in reality feels like ripping it off in your normal body.<br />
<br />
Plain red: Muscles galore. Voice deepens, height increases. Strength takes getting used to, avoid handling fragile objects.<br />
<br />
The green one is next. This one should be interesting. You feel a bit tired after wearing it, sort of like the vampire shirt, but when you look in the mirror, a much different sight greets you. Your hair has turned a bright scarlet and grown to your mid back, and there is now a flower in it. You touch it and discover it is a part of you – the flower is growing out of your head! It seems to be slightly droopy, however. Your skin has turned a pale of green, and darker veiny, leaf-like patterns adorn your hands and feet. You feel slightly different between your legs, too. Looking down, you see that your labia has actually turned into a flower, too! You take a few steps back, and feel the sunlight hit your back. As it does so, a surge of energy washes through you, and you begin to feel much more upbeat. The flower on your head has perked up, too, and is cycling through a series of vibrant colours. You feel a bit thirsty and drink some water, feeling a similar effect. This was not a bad idea at all!<br />
<br />
You feel a sudden urge to move about, and find yourself light on your feet and relieved of stress. This one was definitely a keeper. You looked at the clock and realised your roommate would be back in twenty minutes. Realising your fun would soon be over for the day, you frown a bit, and notice the flower in your hair has again drooped slightly and turned blue. It looks like it reflects your mood! You giggle a bit at the circumstances, and it rises again and again becomes rainbow-coloured. You take the shirt off, and make a new note.<br />
<br />
Plain green: Plant girl &lt;3. Energised by sunlight and slightly less so by water. Face stays same but skin, hair and genitals change drastically. Use only when alone.<br />
<br />
Finally, the purple shirt. This is the last shirt you&#39;ll get to use today, so you hope that it&#39;s either extremely drastic and a fun way to end the experiments, or very subtle so you can wear it for the rest of the evening. You make sure you still have a couple of old logoed t-shirts (as you had thrown out your old ones before going to the store) just in case, and take the plunge with the purple shirt. Nothing felt different. You looked at your arms and legs. No change there. You look at the mirror, and even then nothing shows up. What an anticlimax. Then, you notice a slight bulge between your legs. You look down and stare wide-eyed as you discover that you have a penis! You never thought you&#39;d see one in person this close! You decide to test if it worked by thinking about the girl from earlier, and... yep. Fully erect. You think about something to distract yourself, and realise you need the bathroom. Looks like the yellow shirt wasn&#39;t enough... or the water you drank in the plant body caught up to you. You went over to the toilet and urinated, standing up for once! Several times, you threatened to miss, so you decided you&#39;d sit down in future until you had learned to aim better. You realised that maybe your panties wouldn&#39;t fit as well, so you only put your shorts back on and decide you&#39;ll use them as underwear for now. You realise that you forgot to check something. You put your hand behind the penis and find no testicles there, but your labia is still there. However, neither your clit nor your urethra are there anymore. It looks like the penis has replaced both.<br />
<br />
With that discovery made, you keep the shirt on and put the shorts and jeans on. You make a new note.<br />
<br />
Plain purple: Hermaphrodite. Penis replaces clit and urethra, but no testicles, and vagina still present. Safe to use in public as long as reasonable underwear substitute is found.<br />
<br />
Soon after, your roommate, Alice, comes in. You watch TV for a bit, and all the while, she is unaware of your new equipment. After dinner, you return to the bedroom and take the shirt off, feeling a mild tingle as the penis shrinks back into you. Thankfully, your rich parents have left you with enough money to rent a 2-bedroom apartment, so there&#39;s no risk of Alice stealing your new t-shirts. You realise you haven&#39;t sorted through much of the pile at all, so you leave the unused ones in the corner and hang up the tested ones in the closet. Alice is leaving for a week starting tomorrow, so you have plenty of time to test more shirts undisturbed.<br />
<br />
To recap, you review your list, and decide to organise based on colour scheme, and mark your favourites with a heart (&lt;3), and the ones you intend to use most with a star (*).<br />
<br />

<br />
Satisfied with your work, you lie on the bed and drift off to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next day, you rush home from class and decide to...</p>
