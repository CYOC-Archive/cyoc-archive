<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Runt licked his lips as he waited for my response, and I was seriously considering his offer. I felt like I was high on paint fumes, staring into his <br />
eyes, hypnotised. Then I felt something brush against my cock. I looked down and saw that one of the buttons on my boxer shorts had come <br />
undone and my hard-on had fallen out.<br />
<br />
Whatever spell he had me under, my embarrassment snapped me out of it. I blushed. I tried to cover myself but I was too hard to cup it <br />
properly.<br />
&quot;Let me put some clothes on,&quot; I said to Runt, already turning away from him. He shrugged, but I could detect a, &quot;Drat, I almost had him!&quot; note in <br />
his expression. I hid in my bedroom.<br />
<br />
At the time, I had every intention of doing only what I'd said. I found a better fitting pair of boxers and pulled on yesterdays jeans and t-shirt. <br />
To fill time, I put on socks and shoes too. Then I sat on the bed and wished I was miles away. I was too scared to go back. I had been so turned <br />
on by him if he had wanted to fuck me I'd have let him. And it was quite clear he wanted to. Not only that, I had genuinely considered getting <br />
transformed by this creature. He could make me agree to anything he wanted.<br />
<br />
Time passed and I realised that there was no way I'd go back into that room with him. If I waited much longer, he'd come to find me. I had to <br />
do something. I went to bedside table and found my phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;911. What is your emergency?&quot;<br />
&quot;You've gotta help me!&quot; I said, &quot;Somebody's gotten into my apartment and is trying to blackmail me to let him stay here.&quot;<br />
&quot;A squad car has been dispatched, sir. What is your address?&quot;<br />
I gave it to her.<br />
&quot;Is the intruder still there, sir?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, he's in the front room.&quot;<br />
&quot;Where are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm hiding in my bedroom.&quot;<br />
&quot;Can you barricade the entrance?&quot;<br />
Good idea! This is where our tax dollars go. I dragged my wardrobe in front of the door. There was no way anyone could open it.<br />
&quot;He can't get in,&quot; I told the operator, &quot;Hurry!&quot;<br />
&quot;The police are almost there. Can you describe the intruder, so they can identify him?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh. He's a young man. Long brown hair. Sort of athletic. He's, uh... attractive, I guess.&quot; I cringed. Why did I say that? If the operator thought it <br />
was unusual, she didn't react.<br />
&quot;What is he wearing?&quot;<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; I went hot. &quot;He's not wearing anything.&quot;<br />
She reacted then. &quot;Sir, are you saying the intruder is in a state of undress?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, whatever! He's naked, okay?&quot;<br />
A pause. &quot;Has the intruder attempted to abuse you sexually?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not yet,&quot; said Runt.<br />
<br />
I yelped and dropped my phone. Runt was lying on the ceiling. I couldn't see how he was staying up there. He had his arms folded and his legs <br />
crossed, watching me with a half smile. He winked.<br />
My boner returned with a vengeance. It pressed against my jeans so hard it hurt. I groaned in pain as I instinctively wrestled with the button of <br />
my jeans. I writhed on the bed. I couldn't get it undone.<br />
&quot;Let me help you.&quot;<br />
Runt dropped from the ceiling and walked up to me. Carefully, he reached over to my crotch and, with one finger, unplucked the button. My <br />
cock forced its way out. My zipper was pushed right down to the bottom, my new boxer shorts were torn open and my cock stuck straight up, <br />
much bigger than I remembered. I was sweating.<br />
<br />
Runt sat on the bedside and took a hold of my cock. I moaned. My head went blank. I scratched at my shirt, tearing it off my body. Runt began <br />
to massage my chest. He was so gentle, so slow it infuriated me. I put my hands around his and forced him to jack me off.  I couldn't open my <br />
eyes, I was so far away.<br />
<br />
His free hand caressed me and I filled with warmth. I was swelling up. His was touching me all over and I realised he wasn't touching my cock <br />
anymore. It was just me, jacking off as he tugged and prodded and pulled. I hadn't noticed him taking off my jeans, socks and shoes. Or had I <br />
done that.<br />
<br />
He carefully pulled my hands away from my cock and I felt his mouth envelope it. The intense pleasure I was experiencing doubled. I wondered <br />
how long I'd been moaning for. Missing his touch, my hands found themselves rubbing my body up and down. I felt so hot, so rugged and raw. <br />
My fingers worked up my chest, across my face and got wrapped up in my long hair. It was a few moments before I remembered I had short <br />
hair.<br />
<br />
My eyes shot open. Runt was still working his tongue up and down my shaft. But it wasn't my shaft any more. It was thick and tanned brown, <br />
and my pubic hair was bushier and darker than I remembered. I lifted myself onto my elbows and whimpered. My body had completely <br />
changed. Instead of the short, pale and skinny guy I used to be, I was tall, broad and brown. I was toned and athletic, almost mediterranean. My <br />
body was so large I could barely fit on the bed and yet I looked more in my late teens. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot;<br />
As I spoke, a final wave of pleasure pulsed from Runt's mouth, to my cock and across my body. I fell back onto the bed and shivered and I <br />
exploded into his mouth. I came and came, it wouldn't stop showering onto me. I lay there, quivering, as Runt removed his lips and watched <br />
the fireworks.<br />
<br />
Once it stopped, and I got my breath back, I sat up.<br />
&quot;What the fuck!?&quot;<br />
I was alone.<br />
&quot;Runt!?&quot; I called. No answer, and for the first time I realised my voice had changed. Deeper, more gravelly and with a slight italian accent, I <br />
thought.<br />
For a moment I was relieved he'd gone and it was over. But when I stood up, everything felt so strange. The room felt so much smaller and my <br />
body was heavier than I was used to. <br />
<br />
I stood in front of the mirror. I was very handsome, still covered in my own come. I had a hard-featured face, with slick brown hair down to my <br />
shoulders. And a cock than made me blush. It was weird and I was bewildered but I'd have been freaking out much more if I wasn't so happy <br />
with the way I looked.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, I heard a bang. Shouts of, &quot;NYPD!&quot;. I realised I was naked and panicked. That's when I realised what Runt had done. He made me look <br />
like him. A larger, more masculine, more European version of him, but nonetheless enough like him to match the description that I gave the <br />
police. And I was naked.<br />
<br />
I heard somebody try the door behind my wardrobe. Then they tried to knock it down. That's when I freaked out. <br />
My clothes were all in tatters. I ran to the wardrobe and pulled out the first pair of jeans I could find. But with my new monstrous size, I couldn't <br />
even get my foot down the leg. Nothing would fit me, not even my sweatpants would pull up past the knees. I hopped and pulled and tried so <br />
hard but all I managed was to fall flat on my face.<br />
<br />
My wardrobe tumbled as the door fell in.<br />
&quot;Freeze! You're under arrest!&quot;</p>
