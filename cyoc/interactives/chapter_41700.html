<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You followed Rose up to the second floor. You felt like there was a memory just underneath the surface but you couldn&#39;t grab it. It was frustrating since you wanted to remember your life as Lilly now. You also wondered who had wanted to get rid of you and why. Rose stopped in front of a door and said &quot;This is your room Lilly. Go ahead and open it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and touch the handle. When you do a warm feeling spread up your arm and you quickly draw back. &quot;What was that?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you feel a warm feeling flowing up your arm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have warned you about that. Our rooms have a privacy spell on them. If anyone else tries to enter they feel an icy chill sweep through them and they&#39;re transformed into something random. The warmth is the spell recognizing you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel relieved and put your hand on the handle again. Once again the warmth spreads up your arm and throughout your entire body. You pushed the handle down and then pushed the door open. When you walked in you could see that the room was huge. There was a king size canopy bed on one wall. The hangings were a deep rich red as were the curtains on the windows. The carpet was a light tan. On the wall opposite the bed was the biggest TV you had ever seen. Next to the TV was a computer desk with what looked like the best computer there was. It had a strange monitor though. It was shaped like a dome. You could tell that it was the monitor as there was a screen saver on it.<br />
<br />
There were shelves filled with numerous dolls. You didn&#39;t think anyone had as many dolls as you apparently did. To the side of the bed there was another door. You went over to it and opened it. It led to a huge walk-in closet with a huge dresser and make-up table on on side and tons of dresses and shoes on the other sides. There was another door directly across from the door you came in and you went to that one and opened.<br />
<br />
You were now in a huge bathroom. It was basically all black. The tub, shower, sink, floor, and walls were black. The ceiling was gray. The faucets were gold. You were just amazed at what you were seeing. &quot;Does this bring back any memories?&quot; Rose said behind you making you jump.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t sneak up on me like that&quot; you said putting your hand on your chest and trying to calm your racing heart.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to startle you. So, any memories coming back to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet&quot; you said shacking your head. &quot;There seems to be one just out of my reach though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come back into your bedroom&quot; Rose said waving you to follow her. Once back in your room she took a doll from one of the shelves and handed it to you. &quot;This is your favorite doll. If anything can bring a memory out this is it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you hold the doll you feel a familiarity with it. You could easily believe that this doll was your favorite. As you hold it you were suddenly in another place and time.<br />
<br />
You were twelve and laying in a hospital bed. It was nighttime and you had woken up coughing. In the bed next to you another girl woke up. You know that her name was Ashley and she was your best friend. She smiled at you and said &quot;It&#39;s going to be ok Lilly.&quot; Her voice was weak.<br />
<br />
You couldn&#39;t reply since your throat was so sore. You just nodded trying to reassure her as much as yourself. You knew better though. You were both in the terminal ward of the hospital. Someone had unleashed a magical illness at your school and six girls had already died. From what you had heard their deaths were gruesome. It was evidently painful for the girls and you didn&#39;t want to die that way. Also it seemed that Ashley was in the advanced stages of the disease.<br />
<br />
Seeming to sense your thoughts Ashley said &quot;Here Lilly, I want you to have Molly. She&#39;s brought me comfort and you look like you need some too.&quot;<br />
<br />
You had taken Molly with a horse &quot;Thanks.&quot; After that you had both went back to sleep.<br />
<br />
The next day your families had come in. Ashley&#39;s parents had thought that it was very nice thing to do. They and your family had tried to put on brave faces but you could tell that they were grieving. You and Ashley were going to die and there was nothing they could do about it.<br />
<br />
That night you had again woken up coughing. You looked over and saw Ashley was already awake. She was panting and you could see sweat on her skin. Suddenly she had let out a bloodcurdling scream and began thrashing around on her bed. She was thrashing around so much that she had kicked the covers off of herself. It was then that you noticed that her legs had taken on a rubbery look. She kept screaming and thrashing about while her body painfully transformed. You knew that no one would be coming in to help her. They had done it with the first two girls but the orderlies had been scratched and they underwent painful transformations of their own and died.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t want to watch your best friend die but yet you were unable to look away. You watched in horrified fascination as her body swelled slightly. She reached up and tore the hospital gown off of her so she was totally nude now. Her body deflated to what it was but then her breasts enlarged. They went from the small mounds she had to breasts so big that they covered her body and stopped her thrashing around. They were also crushing her and she couldn&#39;t breath. Her breasts reduced to their original size and she began screaming again.<br />
<br />
Her right arm became stone and her hand broke off as she thrashed about. Her arm became flesh again and blood squirted out of her wrist. The blood began to form tentacles and she used them to grab a water pitcher and throw it across the room. The tentacles shrank forming fingers and the parts closest to the wrist fused together becoming her hand. She spread her legs and her clit swelled into a penis. It grew and grew until it was five feet long and three feet thick. Her legs had been forced out to the sides by the growing dick with an audible crack of bones breaking. Gallons of white fluid came out of the dick before shrinking back down to a clit. Her face pushed out into a muzzle and her screams of pain turned into guttural howls. Blood started to come out of her navel and a tentacle with sharp hooks on it shot out. And identical tentacle shot out of her pussy and they both began thrashing around. They were long enough that they nearly scratched you.<br />
<br />
You had had the good sense to get out of your bed and were huddled in the corner staring at your best friends death and your own future. With another howl of pain two more tentacles with hooks shot out of Ashley&#39;s nipples. Her entire skin took on a rubbery look and her legs fused together into a rubber dick. The tentacle that had come out of her pussy was coming out of the topside of the dick. Some more white fluid came out of the tip and then another tentacles came out of the tip.<br />
<br />
Her hair turned into snakes and writhed about. Her arms whithered until they looked like tree branches with human hands on the ends. Her body lengthened until the tip of her rubber dick legs touched the wall. Her howls of pain turned into a gurgling and her thrashing became small jerks.<br />
<br />
In just a few seconds she became still and the changes reversed themselves. In a few moments Ashley was her normal self though there was a trickle of blood coming from her mouth and she wasn&#39;t breathing. You slid down to the floor and started to cry clutching Molly to you. A few minutes later several men in hazmat suits came in. After ascertaining that you hadn&#39;t been scratched or exposed to any of Ashley&#39;s fluids they carried you out of the room. Your last glimpse of Ashley was the guys placing her into an airtight container. Her funeral was a couple days later and you couldn&#39;t go since you were still in the hospital. Her body had been cremated and her ashes sealed in an airtight urn. She wasn&#39;t buried in a regular cemetery but rather a lead lined concrete vault in the side of a mountain. What was worse was that it wasn&#39;t in the same state she had lived in all her life.<br />
<br />
Back in the present you realized that you were sitting down against the wall, crying and clutching Molly to you as you had when you were twelve. That was four years ago. This time however Rose was sitting beside you and giving you a sideways hug. She looked at you with sadness and said &quot;I&#39;m sorry Lilly. I thought it would have triggered a happy memory, not Ashley&#39;s death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Three more girls had died before they found the cure&quot; you said through your sobs. &quot;I was in the last stages and would have died if they didn&#39;t find it when they did. I shouldn&#39;t be alive when Ashley isn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh, let it out like you did before&quot; Rose said.<br />
<br />
You buried your head in her chest and really let loose. You knew that you would be having the nightmares again. They had stopped when you had been transported to an alternate reality. It was a relief not to have them for two years and you didn&#39;t know if you could handle them again.</p>
