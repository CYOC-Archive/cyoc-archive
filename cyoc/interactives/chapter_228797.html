<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ruben quickly got back on his monkey feet. You know what? He thought, let&#39;s try out that horse recommendation from Jackson!<br />
The teen opened the door, and walked down the hallway, smiling and waving as he past his new colleagues down the hall.<br />
&quot;So how was your first day?&quot; Max asked as Ruben just turned a corner, slight scaring the teen.<br />
&quot;Oh, Max, hey! It went great! Just heading down to the Changer!&quot;, Ruben said after recovering from the sudden lion appearing out of nowhere.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah me too, being an exhibit is great, but if you really want a recommendation, turn back human sometimes! Makes the transformations better!&quot; he said.<br />
Ruben nodded, and motioned for the lionboy to lead on, towards the changer.<br />
<br />
They quickly walked inside the changing room. Max turned toward Ruben, his lion cock once again flashing out of his sheath.<br />
&quot;So I don&#39;t need to remind you how it works right?&quot; he asked, to make sure Ruben doesn&#39;t become a second Riley.<br />
&quot;Yes, I think so!&quot; The teen answered, reassuring Max.<br />
&quot;Okay that&#39;s great! Just a quick word of advice, if you are turning human, don&#39;t worry about anything and just do so, if you want to change into another animal hybrid, make sure you go human first, otherwise it could have painfull side effects!&quot; the lion boy said with a stern voice, clearly indicating that it wasn&#39;t a good idea to do anything otherwise.<br />
&quot;Oh, okay, that&#39;s fine! Why what happens if I don&#39;t?&quot; Ruben asked concerned.<br />
&quot;Well You might have already noticed that your body is a bit more sensitive, this can lead to very painfull reactions to the transformations. if you for example choose to grow fangs or claws right now, it would feel like someone is actively stabbing you with those instead. It is not fun. If you want to be a hybrid creature that&#39;s fine, but set it into one pill. The only times you can take a second dose, if it is the exact same species. You can safely turn yourself into a monkey further right now, and you wouldn&#39;t feel anything&quot;, Max explained, now panting out of breath. &quot;Try saying that in one sentence! Haha&quot; He laughed.<br />
<br />
Ruben nodded. &quot;Okay, so if I wanted to turn myself into a bit of a horse, I&#39;d have to change back first?&quot;, the boy asked for confirmation, making sure he got the information right!<br />
&quot;Yes! And a horse, huh? Great choice! By the way, you can create some additional human pills and store them in your room! That way you can always turn back whenever you want!&quot; Max said, after flashing Ruben the new pill he just created through the changer.<br />
&quot;So have fun, and I&#39;ll see you tomorrow!&quot;, Max bid the boy goodbye, as he left the room.<br />
<br />
Ruben waited for a bit until he couldn&#39;t see the lions tail anymore, and sat behind the computer.<br />
He took max&#39;s advice and created some additional human pills, and quickly took one.<br />
The feeling was once again insane. His monkey were shrinking, and in no time looked just like the feet he had always known.<br />
His ears folded back towards his head and not for long his face looked completely human. The changes finished as his tail quickly retracted into his spine, and the boy was human once more.<br />
Ruben quickly turned his attention back to the pc, and he selected the horse tab.<br />
He wanted to go a bit further with it then the monkey pills, but was still kind off scared off of it by the thought of what happened to Riley.<br />
The teen decided to err on the side of caution, and selected horse ears, a mane, tail, and hooves for his feet.<br />
He wanted to press finished however, but an option attracted his attention. Genitalia.<br />
Ruben hesitated. Should he? Wasn&#39;t it a bit too extreme? But the hand job from Jackson felt so great!<br />
Before additional doubt could overcome him, Ruben quickly enabled the option, his heart beating in his chest, his dick erect and already leaking pre.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the horse pill, and quickly got up and speedwalked to his room.<br />
Thankfully he didn&#39;t bump in to anyone, and duck straight behind his door, quickly locking it.<br />
He looked around and quickly grabbed a glass of water from the small kitchen he had in his room.<br />
Ruben then looked at the pill in his hand, his heart racing, and quickly popped it in his mouth, and with a big gulp, downed it with some water.<br />
<br />
He then quickly took off his trousers and underwear, which now had a very visible wet spot.<br />
There he stood in his room, with his erect cock flying free, in front of the mirror.<br />
His heart raced, longing for the transformation to happen. He thankfully did not have to wait long.<br />
His ears twitched, as they moved up, towards the top of his head and turned pointy. It did not take long for his ears to quickly become fully equine. Ruben held his new ears in his hands, as a coat of fur quickly started to cover them. An itch covered his neck and large portion of his back, as a big mane with the same colour as his hair started to appear.<br />
His attention was then drawn down, as his feet started to feel cold and stiff. Ruben lost his balance for a bit, as his feet turned into big black hooves.<br />
He then felt a familiar sensation in his spine, as a long bushy tail grew longer and longer, untill it reached the ground.<br />
Ruben quickly turned his attention to his dick, anticipating the change, he closed his eyes.<br />
His cock started to twitch, as it turned darker and developed some pink smudges. It grew longer and longer, and the tip turned flat.<br />
Ruben opened his eyes, and sure enough, he now had a giant horse cock.</p>
