<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>I make no apologies for that god awful pun of a title.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Really, we could have stayed their all night if we wanted to, me just laying there with my tail flopping against Mindy&#39;s back while I ate her out. She sure as hell didn&#39;t seem to be opposed to the idea, based on how much she was moaning and screaming as I put all of Yelena&#39;s pointers to good use. I may or may not have even considered pausing time for a few eternities just to spend it <i>mastering</i> the art of carpet-munching - but that seemed like the sort of thing that might cause serious psychological issues. I didn&#39;t want to get so caught up in questioning whether or not I <i>could</i> scarf pussy for twenty billion years straight that I forgot to question whether or not I <i>should</i>.<br />
<br />
Of course, once she had finally pried herself off me and we were back to standing there, hands held, she posed the obvious question. &quot;So... your place or mine?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neither.&quot; She raised her eyebrow at me. I quickly wished us back to the street, still invisible and unheard, before I started to explain. &quot;Listen - this is the most backwards-ass, shitty, hyper-traditional town in the state. You know that, I know that, everybody knows that. Being anything other than white and straight here... I don&#39;t have to tell you how much it fucking sucks, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh it&#39;s shit,&quot; Mindy agreed. &quot;But do you mind giving us some clothes first, and then telling me what your point is?&quot;<br />
<br />
I silently wished up a couple of suitably trendy outfits right onto our clothes before I answered her. &quot;You and me got lucky - we have magical stuff, making it easier to handle. But what if there&#39;s other queer girls around town who didn&#39;t get that lucky? Shouldn&#39;t we help them out, use this thing to make their lives better?&quot; I held up the hand wearing my little genie-in-a-ring. &quot;So I&#39;m thinking: let&#39;s go get those girls together, and let&#39;s rock their fucking worlds. Make them realize they aren&#39;t alone, and that it&#39;s okay to be happy and explore whatever kinky shit they want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is... surprisingly sweet, actually.&quot; She smiled affectionately, and my heart sorta started melting again. &quot;Alright, I&#39;m in. Where are we gonna start.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well uh... I was just gonna wish every girl in town who likes girls to be here, and maybe wish for them all to get really hor-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no no no no no.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;That is soooooo fucking boring.&quot; Honestly, I was kind of annoyed at the time, but she was right. Would&#39;ve been super dull just poofing every lesbian or bi or pan girl right into an immediate orgy. &quot;Better idea: there&#39;s a big pool party tonight at Louisa&#39;s place, rest of the cheer team plus basically anybody who&#39;s anybody on campus will be there. Let&#39;s go there, and let&#39;s find us some ladies to liberate, yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
I bit my lip. Louisa Trevor was the daughter of the richest family in a town that had quite a few clans with way too much in the way of Old Money, and her home - her mansion, really - was suitably huge. Any bash she was throwing would be sure to be loaded with a lot of very pretty girls... and there was bound to be a handful among that many who loved chowing down on a taco, so to speak. &quot;Alright... let&#39;s do it!&quot; And I already had an idea for how to make it a bit more interesting. &quot;I wish we could both see the auras of any girl who&#39;s into girls, whether that girl realizes it or not.&quot;<br />
<br />
Okay, so maybe full-on magical gaydar was a bit much, but it&#39;d still leave the seduction part up to us. Seemed like a pretty good deal, and Mindy didn&#39;t complain. After a pulse of the ring, we looked up and saw one <i>hell</i> of a pink glow coming off of each other. Well, pink, but differeing shades of white and orange and pink. Took her a second to get it, but Mindy got a giggle out of it when she did. Pride flag auras - that was a new one to be sure.<br />
<br />
We spent a minute laughing at the idea before I wished us off to the party, the magic pulse dropping us off right at the balcony overlooking a massive backyard and suitably huge pool around which dozens upon dozens of college kids were gathered. Easily the biggest part I&#39;d ever been at. Right away, we could both see more than a few auras glowing down below - this town wasn&#39;t quite so heteronormative as a lot of people liked to believe, apparently. Mindy was right to licking her lips as she scanned over everyone, picking out her favorite lady to go after... but I ended up staring at somebody off to the edge of things.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d shared a few classes with Bryce, and I sort of knew them, at least well enough to realize that they didn&#39;t get on great with their parents - mom and dad wanted a big strong boisterous son, not somebody who was a bit shy, artsy, and reclusive. I&#39;d never really thought about how they were almost feminine somtimes, but a lot of things clicked into place as I saw them sitting off in a corner with an aura of alternating pink, white, and blue hanging around them. That definitely wasn&#39;t the ring just randomly showing me a guy&#39;s area... it was most definitely showing me a little gay girl&#39;s aura, even if their body didn&#39;t match what the magic said was inside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhhh, I&#39;m gonna go drag that girl kicking and screaming out of the closet,&quot; Mindy said, patting my shoulder and pointing towards a pretty blonde floating in the pool. I nodded, smiling and making a quick mental wish to make us both visible and heard again, but as soon as she was gone my eyes were on Bryce again. No wonder that poor girl always seemed so down. First order of business right then and there: I had to get her what she needed. I stepped inside, sneaking around and finding a suitably empty bedroom before locking the door and wishing that Bryce was right there next to me.<br />
<br />
She popped in with a yelp of confusion, staring at me and stammering. I&#39;d sort of forgotten about the whole mermaid beauty thing - seeing me was getting her instantly hot under the collar, and it showed. &quot;H-hey Jo,&quot; she said, wringing her wrists. &quot;What... uh... w-what just...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Long story,&quot; I cut her off. &quot;Listen. I just figured something out about you, and... I&#39;m gonna help you. And... it&#39;ll probably be a bit freaky, but I&#39;ll be there every step of the way while you get used to it.&quot; I smiled at her before lifting up my ringed hand a bit. &quot;I wish Bryce&#39;s body matched who she is on the inside.&quot;<br />
<br />
That big blush on Bryce&#39;s cheeks at being called &#39;her&#39; for the first time warmed my heart up almost as much as Mindy&#39;s smile did. Pretty much instantly, she was smiling too, and her whole body started to morph, stretching, getting kind of fluid almost. Short black hair dropped down to her shoulders, fat shifted up to her chest and to her butt, her hands and feet shrank, her face got this sweet sort of narrowness while her lips puffed up. She was real quickly starting to look... delicate, I guess is the right word. This slender girl, a bit shorter than me, nicely proportioned but mostly a sweet little flower with this adorable, incredibly kissable face. The most kind-hearted blue eyes I&#39;d ever seen were staring right at me as her clothes reworked themselves, a hoodie for hiding her body becoming a gorgeous white blouse, those raggedy jeans turning into a plaid skirt that showed off her pretty legs.<br />
<br />
She was just... pretty. From her head with the makeup that appeared on her face down to the black high-heels that matched her pantyhose, she was just... god, she was just <i>pretty</i>. It wasn&#39;t even sexual - I wasn&#39;t thinking about wanting to drag her to the floor right then and ravish her. I was thinking about how she was just such a vision of sweetness and beauty that it sort of hurt just to look at her - but how do you look away from the prettiest girl you&#39;ve ever seen? Mindy was still my first big crush, but pretty much instantly as she spun around, Bryce was my second. That cute little laugh as she realized what she&#39;d become... it was the sort of sound that makes you fall in love before you even have a chance to realize it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; She was on the verge of joyful tears as she looked herself over in a mirror, dazzled with the first-time feeling of being comfortable in her own skin. &quot;Jo, this is... I... I don&#39;t know how to thank you!&quot; I was about to make a joke, but she sort of got ahead of me and got right to spinning over, putting her arms around me, and kissing me right on the mouth. You better believe I returned the favor, but even then, it wasn&#39;t the sort of frenching I would&#39;ve been doing with Mindy. Bryce was this delicate little flower - it seemed kind of wrong to initiate lewdness with her. To be sure, if she started it, I was sure as hell gonna go full throttle - but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to start that sort of thing with her.<br />
<br />
When she pulled back, there was this twinkle in her eyes, and my heart just skipped right over a dozen or so beats. &quot;This... this isn&#39;t a dream, is it? Is this really happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you&#39;re awful dreamy, but this is as real as it gets.&quot; My joke made her giggle - god why did she have to giggle? Did she know how much it made my heart ache? &quot;I&#39;ve got this ring, it grants any wish I make. You want anything - change your past, change yourself, change me, change somebody else, get something, <i>anything</i>... and I&#39;ll make sure it gets granted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything?&quot; Hope flooded her gaze. &quot;Well... there is one thing I&#39;d like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Name it, sweetheart.&quot; I leaned down to kiss her on her cute little button nose. &quot;Call me a genie, because your wish is my command.&quot;</p>
