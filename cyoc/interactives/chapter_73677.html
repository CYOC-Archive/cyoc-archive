<p>
Cathy and Jenny were walking through the hallway of their school when they had just gotten out of recess. They 
had finished their last class, and they were discussing the next homework assignment for history class. They 
had been best friends for their entire lives, which had been easy since they lived right next door to each 
other. They had known one another since kindergarten and they had grown up always hanging out together through 
every grade in school.
<p>
As they were nearing the end of the hallway, they stopped at the water fountain. They were both very thirsty, 
since the last class was P.E., and decided to have a drink of cold water from the fountain.
<p>
“Boy, I can’t wait to get home!” Cathy said to her friend, Jenny. 
<p>
“Why? What’s going on?” she asked her.
<p>
“I heard that Justin Bieber has a new song out, and I can stream it for free on iTunes! Today is the first day 
it’s available!” Cathy cheered out loud. “Ooohh I just love Justin Bieber so much! He is so incredibly hot!”
<p>
“Well, I’m just dreaming about my vacation to the beach!” Jenny responded. “I’m so tired of being at home all 
the time! Being in the city just makes my skin and my face turn pale! I look like a ghost! I need to hit the 
beach so I can work on my tan! Not only that… I want to hit the surf… and check out the cute surfer boys!”
<p>
“Well, Spring Break is just around the corner!” Cathy added.
<p>
“Call me when you get home!” Jenny said, as she jumped on the bus.
<p>
Cathy jumped on the bus as well. The girls sat on different ends of the bus so they could talk to other girls. 
When the bus arrived near their house, they jumped out and walked to their homes.
<p>
Cathy ran up to her front door and got inside quickly. As soon as she got in, she turned on her laptop and 
loaded the iTunes application. From there, she quickly started looking for the newest song by her heartthrob. 
She put on the song by Justin Bieber and lay on her bed, taking in the tune and the lyrics sung by her 
favorite teen pop star. She looked up, staring at the many posters and pictures of the famous teen singer. She 
looked at her book shelf, and glanced at her collection of CD’s and magazines and books with Justin Bieber’s 
picture on it. She was truly in love with the boy.
<p>
For a brief moment, she dozed off into a deep sleep, while wearing her headphones, which were plugged in to 
her laptop. She was listening to her favorite singer as she fell asleep. Little did she know that she actually 
started to transform into her favorite musical star as she was sleeping.
<p>
As she dozed off with her ear buds in her ears, while plugged into her iPod and set her playlist to the “My 
World” albums of Justin Bieber, her body began to change completely! First of all, her black hair began to 
change color and become light blond, just like that of her favorite singer. The long hair became shorter and 
shorter, until it was above the ears and spiky on top, like the way Justin was wearing it currently.
<p>
Next, she began to grow a few inches taller, since she was only barely over 5 feet tall. She stretched out 
over six inches or so, reaching Justin Bieber’s current height. 
<p>
Furthermore, her hips and thighs became narrower but her arms and legs became longer, like that of a teenage 
boy. Her shoulders became wider as well, and her arms, her hands and her feet increased in size. She gained 
some hair on her armpits as well.
<p>
Next, she began to lose some of her female traits, as her breasts began to shrink down all the way until her 
chest was completely flat! Her vagina was gone as well, and male organs appeared in their place. She grew 
pectorals and a cock with balls, which matched the five-inch one that Justin really had now, along with the 
testicles! Her vagina was completely gone! Along with that, her voice began to change immediately and she now 
spoke with a baritone voice instead.
<p>
She gained more muscle everywhere, like her torso, her arms and her shoulders, replacing her female curves. 
This all made it so she was in for a major surprise when she woke up!
<p>
Several hours later, when her alarm went off, she got up and stumbled into her bathroom! As she turned on the 
light, she was greeted by her shocking reflection in the mirror! She saw the male face of the blond, blue-eyed 
teenage heartthrob Justin Bieber staring back at her!
<p>
“OHMYGOSH!” she gasped out loud, in Justin’s voice.
<p>
“Oh gosh… Justin! It’s him... No, wait… It’s me… I’m me… No… NOOO! I AM JUSTIN BIEBER!”
<p>
She… or HE… stood there, staring at his reflection in shock…
<p>
He had completely transformed into his idol! He looked and sounded and felt JUST like him!
<p>
How did that happen? What about Jenny? She couldn’t WAIT to tell Jenny!
<p>
In the meantime, Jenny had her own experience….
<p>
Jenny was going home from school. She loved to see people biking, running, and skating around. She was a bit 
of a tomboy and she just loved watching boys doing active stuff outdoors. She secretly dreamed of being a boy 
just because they were always so busy being outdoors and doing stuff. 
<p>
Jenny was that happy, active girl with blonde hair stuck in a ponytail. She had posters of boys hanging on her 
wall of boys on their skateboards, wearing jeans or shorts, with knee pads and gloves, and their Vans skate 
shoes. They all had nice fiberglass skateboards and they were able to perform numerous tricks, racing up and 
down those tall, steep ramps and soaring down sidewalks and street corners. It just seemed to her that boys 
were always having more fun than all the girls she knew.
<p>
She got into her comfortable clothes and crawled on her bed. After a few minutes, she dozed off into a deep 
sleep. While she slept, her body began to change slowly and gradually, thanks to the tainted water she drank 
at her school earlier that day.
<p>
Her transformation started off right away with her female parts disappearing right off the bat. Her breasts 
began to shrink slowly and surely, and within an hour after she dozed off, they were all but gone, leaving her 
now with just those manly pectorals!
<p>
Her vagina closed up while stubble began to form on her groin, quickly growing longer until a penis formed. 
Then, as it grew, testicles formed underneath it as well. Finally, she was left with male genitals and 
pectorals. Her long, blonde hair shortened and formed light brown, wavy hair on top. 
<p>
Her shoulders widened and her arms thickened as her muscles began to form a bit all over her body, making her 
resemble a tall and lanky skater.  Her legs changed from her thin legs to more muscular, with her quads and 
calves bulging a bit, which was normal for a boy who skated a lot.
<p>
She now knew all the skate tricks and she owned one of the coolest boards and accessories. She had friends at 
the skate park and she loved going over there! In fact, she would go everywhere with her board! Now, she 
wasn’t a girl anymore, but a boy!
<p>
The following morning, when he woke up, he felt heavy and strong. He felt his cock throbbing hard, and his 
muscles were aching. He suddenly got up with a start, wondering why he felt so different. He rolled off the 
bed and stumbled over to the bathroom. As he walked over to the toilet, he realized that he had a penis! What 
the heck?
<p>
Then, he stared at his reflection in the mirror! He was no longer a girl! He was a boy!
<p>
“Acck! I’m a GUY!”
<p>
He turned around and sideways, observing his muscles, his pecs and his abs. He felt bigger, taller, heavier 
and stronger than he was the night before!
<p>
“Wow, look at me! I gotta take a picture of my new body for my facebook!” he said, as he quickly grabbed his 
camera. He snapped his picture and posted it online for all to see.
<br />
<br />
<img src="">
<br />
<p>
“There! I’m a guy! Now I can go skating!”
<p>
Indeed, he ran back into his room and found his skate clothes, his socks, his shoes and his board. Perfect! He 
quickly took a shower and dried off, now needing more time since he had a bigger body! Then, when he was done, 
he got dressed, he grabbed his board under his arm, and he ran out the door. He hopped on his board and 
grinned as he finally experienced the ultimate freedom of a boy: The ability to ride his board!
<p>
When he finally reached the school, he met his best friend. Now, they were no longer Cathy and Jenny, but Jake 
and Justin!
<p>
Jenny, now as Jake, took her cell phone and called her best friend, Cathy. What she heard was a male voice!
<p>
“Jenny? This is me, Cathy! I look like Justin Bieber!”
<p>
“Listen! I’m a guy! I’m a skater dude!”
<p>
The girls described what they looked like over the phone, and they set up to meet in the boy’s bathroom at 
school.
<p>
Once there, they met in front of the large mirror in the deserted bathroom.
<p>
“Oh my gosh! You look like Justin Bieber!” 
<p>
“And you’re a skater guy!” Jenny said. “I guess you can call me Jake now!”
<p>
“Let me see your body!” Justin said to Jake.
<p>
“You too!” Jake said.
<p>
Both boys removed their shirts and shorts, revealing their well-toned bodies.
<p>
Justin was more handsome with his looks, where Jake was more muscular, as a skater. Justin wasn’t as tall, but 
he had a cute face and eyes, with his lanky but toned body and his long arms and legs. Jake, on the other 
hand, was a lot more muscular, with bulging muscles on his arms and legs. His pecs bulged more as well. Plus, 
Jake’s hair was more waved.
<p>
“Can I be your boyfriend?”
<p>
“Sure!” Justin replied.
<p>
The two boys then got dressed and they put on their shoes, and they walked down the hallway of the school, 
while other boys – and girls – looked on in complete jealousy.</p>
