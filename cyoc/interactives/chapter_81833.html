<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The four new men hurried down the street, self conscious about how exposed their adult bodies were. Suddenly, <br />
Fred stuck out his hand and said &quot;Hey, this is my house. Nobody's home so we can get some clothes&quot;. Although <br />
they were literally in a race against time, they knew they couldn't go any further looking like unsuccessful <br />
Hulk cosplayers. They all gathered in Fred's dad's room while he threw clothes at them. This was the first <br />
time Grant had been able to see his new face and he paused to look at himself. He thought he looked quite <br />
attractive, his light, scratchy stubble complimenting his square jaw and his deep blue eyes. He could <br />
definitely get a job as a model if he weren't aging at an abnormal rate, yet he still looked college age.<br />
<br />
Grant glanced around the room seeing the men in various states of undress. Harold barely looked any different <br />
from when they met outside the school. Other than a bit more body hair, there wasn't much to talk about. Peter <br />
on the other hand now looked to be his parent's age. He had lost the majority of his hair, a vague fuzz still <br />
clung to the top of his head. His beard had a grey streak down the middle of his chin, along with some stray <br />
grey hairs that spread throughout his remaining hair. He had started to pack weight onto his hirsute body and <br />
he was lucky to have found a large shirt that could cover his bulk. He didn't look too happy being the oldest <br />
and fattest in the room, but Fred was having the worst problems. He looked like he'd aged 10 years since <br />
leaving the school, almost surpassing Peter in age. He still had a thick head of hair but it was prematurely <br />
greying at the temples. His fluffy beard was several inches long, the bottom half already a mix of grey and <br />
black hair. He still had some massive muscles but it was hard to deny that they were starting to deteriorate, <br />
his rock-hard abs were softening under his stomach hair and his pecs were slightly less solid. Grant continued <br />
to stare as Fred pulled off his torn pants with one swift movement, his large cock swinging about from the <br />
force. Grant blushed and looked away, hoping he hadn't noticed and quickly got changed into his own clothes. <br />
<br />
It wasn't long before they had all left the house and continued towards their scout leader's home. They had to <br />
slow down as Peter was getting worn out from all the running. His furry face was red from exhaustion. Fred <br />
didn't like the sudden interruption as he noticed his stomach was starting to bulge slightly. He and Peter had <br />
to be the same age by now, whereas Harold and Grant were still in their twenties. Harold was putting on a bit <br />
of muscle under his baggy clothing but had barely changed in looks. Grant was also getting muscular, his <br />
sleeves starting to tighten as his biceps and hairy arms swelled. The difference in age was hard to ignore and <br />
as they neared their destination, Fred tried to start up a conversation. &quot;So why do you think Peter and I are <br />
getting older than you two&quot;.<br />
<br />
Harold shrugged and said &quot;well I didn't finish my pancakes. I only ate half of them without anything on them&quot;. <br />
The smaller portion would explain why he had barely aged compared to the others. In fact, he looked like he'd <br />
wasn't aging anymore, a young body that had only recently finished college. <br />
<br />
Peter spoke up next to say &quot;I ate all of my pancakes, but I added some syrup to them because I thought they <br />
were a little dry&quot;. Maybe it was possible that adding something to the pancakes could of affected the aging <br />
effects they caused. By now, he looked to be 40 years old. His crown was completely devoid of hair, with a <br />
greying horseshoe shape of hair growing around his head. His beard was 50% grey and did little to hide the <br />
multiple chins he'd acquired from all the fat he'd put on, his face round and chubby. His shirt was starting <br />
to ride up  over his large hairy belly.<br />
<br />
Grant responded &quot;I ate all of my pancakes, but I had nothing on them as well. Maybe adding something makes you <br />
older&quot;. Grant was getting close to 30 years old now. He was still lean and muscular with his beard keeping its <br />
trimmed stubble appearance. Grey hairs were starting to creep in but his light blond hair made it difficult to <br />
really notice unless you looked close. Small, faint crows feet were starting to become noticeable at the <br />
corner of his eyes.<br />
<br />
Fred coughed to clear his throat and said &quot;Well you didn't eat them all exactly&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I may of taken one of your pancakes before you arrived because I was still hungry...&quot;. He seemed to be <br />
paying the price for his gluttony as he was definitely now the oldest in the group, having surpassed Peter in <br />
age by a few years. His once impressive body had deteriorated, his stomach swelled outwards and hung over his <br />
jeans, as solid as a rock. His hair had receded by a few inches, leaving him with an M shaped hairline. Most <br />
of the hair that remained and his facial air was rapidly greying, much of its original black colour now white. <br />
Deep lines creased his once youthful face making it hard to believe he was a child at the beginning of the <br />
day. <br />
<br />
Grant felt a bit annoyed by his revelation. &quot;Hey, I paid $5 for those pancakes and I didn't even want them! <br />
Well based on that, I guess it's the amount we eat that affects our aging&quot;. Before anyone could respond, Grant <br />
had turned onto the drive of someone's house. Fred made his way to the front of the group and knocked on the <br />
door.</p>
