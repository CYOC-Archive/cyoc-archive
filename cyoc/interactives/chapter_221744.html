<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Paul’s profile was scanned into the programme, they talked about and decided, since Felicity was already sitting in front of the laptop, she should go first. Waiting until her husband had left, she didn&#39;t do anything at first as she thought over her options. Clicking on a few things, she swapped her husband&#39;s sex and gender, considered making him younger, changed her mind, then dropped his age to twenty-one anyway. Opening the option for careers, she eventually settled on making him a college student who&#39;d just finished their second semester, but was still undecided on their major, and had an IQ of one hundred and seventeen. Satisfied by this, she set to work on his appearance.<br />
<br />
For his hair, she made it thick with a slight crimp and wave which curled at odd intervals. Lengthening it so it came down to the small of his back, she set this as its max length, then altered the colour from dark brown which was almost black to medium honey blonde. Changing the shade of his eyes to grey, she gave him a small nose, as well as a cute, small mouth with full lips. Setting his ears to be pierced, Felicity moved down to the body. Opening windows and pull-down menus, she read her options before settling on the first thing removed was the thick shag of chest hair he had. Going back to the face, she thinned the eyebrows and set it as no facial hair beyond what was above the eyes. Satisfied, she clicked on a few other things and removed his arm, armpit, back, groin and leg hair. Switching everything to no body hair, the one thing she left was he&#39;d have a thin strip of hair covering the groin, no longer than from the tip of his pinkie to the first knuckle.<br />
<br />
Finished, she next changed his skin tone to a creamy white, set his nipples as always being pale pink and erect, then increased the breasts size to a full and pert B cup. Setting this as the maximum size his boobs would grow, she dropped his height down to five foot even, set it as the max, and shifted his weight to one hundred seventeen, and entered in the option it would fluctuate slightly, but never get above a hundred and twenty one and never lower than one hundred eleven. Moving on to his hands and feet, she decreased them to a small and dainty size, set the option as having prominent fingernails which were sometimes painted and, after giving it some thought, set it so the toenails were sometimes painted.<br />
<br />
Going back over her everything, she opened another menu and after deliberation, set it so the vulva would always be puffy, full, and as a girl, Paul could never wear anything tight, as she always have a camel toe. Setting the menstrual flow to always light with an occasional medium, she set it so, if she ever did become pregnant, it&#39;d only happen once and she&#39;d have a daughter, before she moved on and set so, as a female, Paul used menstrual cups primarily, pads when sleeping, and tampons only when no other option was available. Clicking the save feature, careful not to activate the changes, she switched Paul&#39;s name to Aimee Marie Snyder next, then moved onto clothing.<br />
<br />
After she&#39;d set the option to Aimee loving skirts and dresses, she added the information the girl wouldn&#39;t wear underwear with them unless she was having her period or the garment was way too short. Leaving it set that Aimee hated wearing ridiculously short shorts, short skirts and dresses, as well as super tight, revealing clothes, and not just because of the risk of camel toe, Felicity set Aimee&#39;s taste in bras as nipple pasties, she preferred two-piece swimsuits, or, if she could get away with it, swimming in the nude, wore in the summer men&#39;s cargo shorts, always black, slept in men&#39;s pyjama bottoms or sleeper shorts, her shirts and tank-tops always had an image of some sort of them, and her go-to choice of shoes were a comfy pair of sneakers, with high-heels as option only when they were called for.<br />
<br />
Done, Felicity reclined back in the office chair. Thinking over all she done, she tapped the save option before she went back and set it so Aimee had had her last menstrual cycle about a week previous. After this, she went back over everything, paying close attention certain details, setting Aimee&#39;s sexual preference to bisexual, figuring it&#39;d probably be the most comfortable to Paul, placing the awareness at only Felicity and Paul knowing of the transformation, among other little things Felicity felt rounded Aimee out and made her more realistic, including giving Paul all the knowledge of growing up a girl, transitioning through the awkward teenage years and finally setting out on the path into womanhood, yet keeping, as if it was more a dream than anything else, in the back on the mind, the secret understanding that, at one time, Aimee had been Paul, yet it was nothing to influence her or bother her in any way. Finding everything she&#39;d done, Felicity set the change as being low discomfort, saved the profile a final time, was careful not to activate the change, closed Paul profile, pulled up hers and went to find her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m finished,&quot; she announced the moment she found him in the den, watching the end of the news which was a repeat of the earlier stuff.<br />
<br />
With a nod, still unsure about the Chronivac and if he was doing the right thing, Paul stood, but didn&#39;t leave. Pretending to stretch, he tried to figure out a way to broach the subject. But, not coming up with anything, he said, &quot;Be done in a couple minutes,&quot; as he gave his wife a kiss, headed out of the den and toward Felicity&#39;s office.<br />
<br />
There, he sat down before the laptop, but didn&#39;t do anything right away. Looking at the screen, not really reading anything, Paul found himself wanting to back out more than ever. He didn&#39;t want to be a woman, and felt certain Felicity didn&#39;t want to be a man. Trying to find an alternative solution, he huffed in agitation when nothing came to him. Telling himself it wouldn&#39;t be permanent, he touched a finger to the touchpad on the laptop and started to work.<br />
<br />
As it&#39;d been agreed neither would tell the other what changes they&#39;d made, Paul was oblivious to how Felicity had done the same thing when he dropped the woman&#39;s age down to twenty-one. Changing next the sex and gender to male, he upped the height to five foot ten and altered the weight to one hundred and seventy-five. Pulling open windows, he made Felicity muscular to the point she wasn&#39;t body-builder stock, but wasn&#39;t skinny and undeveloped, and had tanned and toned skin. Leaving it at she&#39;d always be like this, never having an ounce of fat on her body, Paul wondered what to do next. Scrolling through options, he set Felicity&#39;s name as Owen Michael Holmes, in a steady relationship with a girl he felt he&#39;d have to ask his wife for the name she set his at, thought about what to do next, and after some careful thought, set Owen&#39;s sexual preference as bisexual, and his cock as circumcised, the size at eleven inches flaccid, and fourteen and three quarters erect.<br />
<br />
From there, he moved on to other details. Body hair he kept as sparse, with the only real hair being the eyebrows, a sparse, short, triangle patch-shaped over the groin, some on the underarms, and a short buzzcut on top. Setting chest, leg, arm, beard, and moustache to none, he set the intelligence at one hundred and ten, and after mulling it over, made Owen a first year college student majoring in Physical Education and had a job as an assistant personal fitness trainer at a local gym. Setting the personality at a healthy balance between compliant and domineering, Paul found himself stuck as to what to do next.<br />
<br />
Back over everything, he re-read what he&#39;d entered. Reaching the end, he decided to give Owen the option of preferring jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, ankle socks, and no underwear as his usual go-to wardrobe. Pyjamas he set as always a pair of lounge pants and a t-shirt, and when nicer clothes were called for, Owen would wear a button-up, slacks and proper loafers. Pulling open windows, he made Owen health-conscious, set it as he&#39;d be fit and healthy, and set his choice in food would be fruits, nuts, and vegetables first, meat, and in very small portions, as last. Hitting the save feature, Paul went back over, opened other windows and accessed pull-down menus, added to areas he felt were lacking, such as making Owen&#39;s jaw square, strong, and his teeth neat, with a couple of his molars pulled, with the rest never having come in, and his hair colour as medium brownish-blond, nose having a slight appearance of having been broken, an accident Owen had had as a child involving an incident with a ball-thrower, eyes the shade of hazel, and the transition from female-to-male with as little discomfort as possible.<br />
<br />
Now satisfied he was finished, Paul set the awareness to only him and his wife knowing of the changes, gave Owen the knowledge of growing up boy and becoming a man, then hit save. Standing, he called Felicity in, and when she entered, he directed her to a specific piece of the profile and said, &quot;Would you mind entering the name you gave my female profile in the area of who their in a relation with?&quot;<br />
<br />
Without looking at anything else, Felicity typed Aimee Marie Snyder in the appropriate area, hit save, then pulled up Paul&#39;s profile. Thinking herself foolish for having missed this, she entered in the relationship information as dating, had Paul type in the name he&#39;d given her male profile, then set it as the plan was for them to be married some time after college. Figuring it&#39;d never get to that point, but seeing as better safe than sorry, she hit save.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what next?&quot; Paul asked, to which Felicity replied, &quot;I guess we try and see if this programme does what it says it can do,&quot; and tossing out an idea, she listened as her husband responded, and going back and forth, they decided to set the timer so their transformations would each start in five minutes. Setting the timer, they hugged, started to say something to each other, and instead with a nodded which conveyed all they needed to have said, they exited the office, with Paul headed for the bathroom and Felicity toward the bedroom.</p>
