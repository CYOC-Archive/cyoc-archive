<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John was quick on the trigger to see near Erin's room phone the number to the Ointment Shop. A call there earned him the same remedy that Erin would have taken except he'd tried out the new equipment.<br />
<br />
A hot bath, vinegar, baking soda and in a half hour John's penis returned to it's very rpoper human shape.  The relief in seeing his return to total human status made another notion.<br />
<br />
The salve he's touched on the rocking horse? If his dear brother Erin had it on him and sat on the pony skin!!!!! POW !  It was true, John knew it for sure.<br />
<br />
John jumped into some clothes, a coat and boots then flew out the rear door of the house. A fast run to the stable and a short stop to catch his breath. Looking about it took just a minute to see the dappled gray stallion walking about in his box stall.<br />
<br />
John stood on a stump and looked down into the pasture. &quot;Hello there brother Erin!&quot; John said with a grin.<br />
<br />
The stallion stopped his walking in impatient circles and stood looking up at John.<br />
<br />
&quot;I found your extra jar of sex ointment in the medicine cabinet. The stuff has quite a kick if your not careful! I see that my dear brother was not too careful, right?&quot; asked John.<br />
<br />
Now either the stallion would simply go about it's business or the brother he thought was inside the beast would make his thoughts know, John wasn't sure?<br />
<br />
A loud whinnie from the stallion proved to John he was looking into the changed self of his brother Erin. &quot;Well brother dear I see your in fine form, a stallion, a Shetland pony, but I think you've grown a little since I'd seen you last!&quot;<br />
<br />
Indeed Erin had wondered about that very thing. At first he was placed in the box stall it was impossible for him to see over the top rail. Now he looked over the rail was ease and was almost nose to muzzel with his half brother John as he stood by the fence.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had a long talk with that Chinese man at the shop. A good thing too because when I tried some of that sex ointment my dic touched your dress shoes. In minutes my pecker was on it's merry way to be that of the bovine steer or bull who's hide made the shoes. I took a bath as you would or should have before the lust made the animal a permanant way of life.  Well the thing you don't know is that if the stuff was ingested by mouth it took on a tougher attitude. The man told me that if eaten th ointment would increase size to which ever female animal one had sex with next.  I see well that Sandy, Mom's mare isn't holding her tail high for some lovin, so you must have enjoyed her too, Hmmm Brother?&quot; said John.<br />
<br />
The stallion Erin heard the new words which explained the curse he was now living. The mare Sandy was Mom's favorite Quarter horse. The mounting of her had added to Erin's size and he was quickly growing to become a Quarter horse Shetland mix breed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yup brother, if you become a mixed breed that would make you inferior as a stallion. The groom and Father would either have you casterated or use you to bring the mare's in heat and never again mount. Laughing&quot; John stepped down from the bale of hay and laughed his way out of the barn.<br />
<br />
The walk to the house brought the sight of people coming for the costume dance and New Year's Eve party. Stopping John had an idea to fun with some of Erin's friends. &quot;If I'm lucky a few might even join him in the pasture, hmmm!&quot; thought John with purpose and intent.<br />
<br />
Once he enter the house he ventured to Erin's bedroom and picked up the ointment jar. If he could cut some pony hide from the rocking horse he'd rub the hairy skin with salve and drop in into some people's costumes.  <br />
<br />
A knife of his Eagle Scout brother made the hide cut quickly. A glob of ointment was smeered with two fingers full of ointment and he was ready.<br />
<br />
The guests milled about as John entered looking like a wise man from the middle east. Slowly he walked about the guest looking for just which one's he might curse to live in the pasture.<br />
<br />
Then he saw his mark, Frank Henry and his sister Aggie stood near the punch bowl. As they looked about John walked up behind Aggie and droped the hank of hide with ointment down her open collar. A scream of fright as the cold slimed skin patch worked it's way down into the dress.<br />
<br />
John could not move fast enough as he met with a quick slap to his face. Frank then seeing his Sister compromised took John by his collar and picked him off the floor. As the big strong foot ball player held John in the air a quick finger fool poked another slimed hide piece into Frank's trousers.<br />
<br />
It was John's Father who came to the aid of his guests and ordered John from the party. Embarressed Father apologized to his guests for John's actions and the strange disappearance of his oldest son Ein.<br />
<br />
The evening went on without a problem till at about two in the morning Aggie felt so warm she begged to be taken home.  Frank agreed and Brother with Sister drove toward their parents home in Mason county a good twenty miles away.<br />
<br />
John watched from Erin's bedroom window and wondered what those two would find when they undressed later?</p>
