<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Julia twirled her magical torch in the air as she made her way to the top of the hill overlooking the training camp. Basking in the sunshine of dawn was Susan doing the standard praise the sun yoga pose. Her 30.5 centimeters of vascular dick meat stood straight out of her yoga pants at an angled degree, dripping pre cum onto the grass like a leaky faucet. <br />
<br />
“Heyo Susan.”<br />
<br />
“Nameste Julia. You’ve come to join me in morning praise of the sky?”<br />
<br />
“Nah nothing too spiritual. Just here for fresh air and light stretching. We don’t get this sunlight back in the UK.”<br />
<br />
“Is that why you carry that flashlight everywhere?” Susan giggled, opening one eye towards Julia.<br />
<br />
“You never know when you might need it,” Julia smiled back, pointing a bright pink beam onto Susan’s small buttocks.<br />
<br />
“That is a perspective, but it is a beautiful day. How about putting man’s creations down for a bit and joining me in connecting with nature?”<br />
<br />
“I’ll just copy you since you insist,” Julia felt that Susan was a bit of a tech avoidant and decided to not upset her bunk mate by flashing her more than necessary, at least for now. Susan’s ass was now bubbly and round, very big, very soft. Her hips and upper thighs had also expanded to give her a nice pear figure to match her now bootiful butt.<br />
<br />
“Simply perfect! Now I’ll do some stretches so just follow my lead.”<br />
<br />
So Julia set her torch down and copied Susan’s motions the best she could. Some poses were easy because they were similar to her regular swimming stretches. Others weren’t as they were yoga poses that Susan had to give verbal instructions to Julia to do properly. Susan acted with grace and moved with steadiness as if she was truly in tune with the wilderness around her. Julia on the other hand was staring directly at Susan’s new delicious jiggly behind while stretching.<br />
<br />
It was fooking amazing! Every yoga pose seemed to accentuate Susan’s delectable buttcheeks, stretching her yoga pants tighter. Yoga pants which were already stretched tight by her monster cock and balls. If the pose wasn’t showing off her awesome ass then it was showing off her veiny monster and churning package. Susan was hot, Julia couldn’t lie. Her blonde braided hair shone bright in the morning light, trailing down towards her bootyful behind. Her thin body and flat chest contrasted hugely by her bottom heavy assets created a pretty figure.<br />
<br />
Julia and Susan eventually started talking to each other about themselves since they hadn’t talked deeply the first night at camp. Susan was vegetarian and American. She was working towards an environmental degree but she had taken the year off to get in touch with nature and herself. The training camp was going to give her a certificate that would allow her to become a yoga instructor which she was interested in as a part time job. Julia told Susan she was here for relaxed swimming training for her college club which had booked the camp for any member to attend at their leisure.<br />
<br />
Susan was in the cobra pose now, putting all her weight on her steel hard cock and iron hard balls, due to their size, like no problem. Julia had copied the pose but felt herself getting hard from staring at Susan’s twin bottom spheres stretching her yoga pants to its breaking point.<br />
<br />
“Hey I’ve been wondering, how are you laying on your dangly bits without squeezing the life out of it? Because damn I’m trying the bloody hell not to squish my balls,” Julia gave up on the cobra stance and laid back watching Susan’s fat cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Well first you have to have the proper form, but since you’ve got a massive girldick like me I could recommend the essential oils I use to strengthen and fortify your cock and your mind. I’ve been using them since I was a little girl and they really work as you can see,” Susan broke form by deliberately putting all her weight onto her always hard cock. Then she lifted her legs and arms until she was in a superman pose, suspended in the air by her thick skinned vascular cock.<br />
<br />
“Does it hurt when you do that?” Julia scooted closer to Susan and bent down to inspect her underside like a car mechanic.<br />
<br />
“No, in fact it feels freeing like I am one with the universe,”Susan’s cock belched out more of her perpetual precum, her balls audibly churning and inflating with baby batter.<br />
<br />
“I get you. I feel the same way when I swim,” Julia changed the subject to a more carnal route, “Do you want to boff, cause your poses are turning on!”<br />
<br />
“Well someone’s in tune with nature, and touching the earth got me horny too. You’ll have to top though, since my rod is too strong,” Susan agreed to Julia’s request, presenting her bountiful behind to the British girl. <br />
<br />
Julia crawled up to Susan’s big butt, pulling down her yoga pants and squeezed them cheeks, “Too strong?”<br />
<br />
“Like, I guess my essential oils worked too well cause I my girl cock is now this muscular and permanently hard and leaking. Nobody could take it and even if they did I wouldn’t feel much. Probably for the best too because I feel like they would be impregnated if my essence got into anyone, girl or boy. It isn’t all that bad since I can transfer my seed into trees and the ground to help life bloom and grow.”<br />
<br />
Blimey, this yoga bitch is a ground fucking tree fucker, very hot. Julia spat on her hand for lubricant. She then stuck a finger, then two, and then her whole fist into Susan&#39;s treasure hole. Pushing deep she found that Susan’s pleasure button had also grown in size, firm yet squishable. Julia’s fist against the prostate made Susan moan in delight, squirting more precum onto the ground. Breaking form, Susan’s hips yielded to Julia’s pressure, and like a shovel Susan’s metal hard tool entered the soft precum soaked ground. <br />
<br />
Julia’s own monster was begging for action, practically shaking in starvation. Pulling her fist out of Susan’s juicy butt, Julia aimed and pounded her dick down to go downtown on the phat assed yoga slut. With each wild slap of balls against booty, Julia hammered Susan’s dick deeper into the earth like a tent pole that needed to be smashed into the ground. <br />
<br />
They went on like that for 15 minutes, anal smashing and literally pound pounding. It was so fucking hot for Julia to bonk a phat arsed white girl with a literal metal hard muscles monster of a cock. It also felt amazing to dominate a person of equal standing. Julia had never fucked another girl before, and yet screwing a girl with a dick just like her felt stupid good, way better than wanking alone. She blamed this on her football competitive spirit for this ecstasy. <br />
<br />
At the right time with a genitalia breeze passing the hill they were on, Julia thrusted her hips hard and her balls clenched as her 34.3 cm knob jizzed her load, pressing deep into Susan’s big prostate. Susan screamed into the wind as her own 30.5 cm muscled monster transferred human seed into the ground like an industrial pipe, blasting gallons of her fertilizer straight from her fat machine muscled testicles. <br />
<br />
The hill in years to come would grow the world’s largest common grass stalks that towered over people at 3 meters and hidden at the very top, in the middle of the stalks, lived a womanly creature formed from soil, grass, and human essence.</p>
