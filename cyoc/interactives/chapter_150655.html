<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Well let’s drink,” Kumi shrugged. “And just get the usual, I have a weird feeling about the new ones.” Lisa nodded, she had a similar feeling that some of the newer drinks could be a bit odd, perhaps even transforming the two into anthros. Ordering two margaritas the girls now scanned the dance floor, people watching as they smiled. A gasp by Kumiko quickly brought Lisa to attention. “Lisa is that Cole?”<br />
<br />
Lisa turned towards where Kumi was pointing, noticing a trio of young men drinking beer. Cole Harris had returned from West Point And was now enjoying his summer vacation. The 21 yr old cadet was slightly different from his doppelgänger, having not lost his blond hair and being clean shaven as opposed to the Cole from the other timeline. Cole apparently was a little stunned by all the anthro people that now mingled freely around the town as he curiously gazed around the club.<br />
<br />
“I should go talk with him,” Kumi said quickly. As she started forward she was surprised to find Lisa grab her arm. “Are you sure that’s such a great idea,” she asked. Kumi frowned as she glared at her friend. “You can’t be serious.”<br />
<br />
“Lisa Cmon,” Kumi groaned. “I doubt he would recognize me and besides, in that other timeline I’m like married to him. Hell, we even have a kid together.”<br />
<br />
“But this isn’t the other timeline Kumi,” Lisa retorted. “This Cole doesn’t even know about magic. Remember you’re really 16 not 21. How is that going to even work out between the two of you? You can’t start dating and he’s going to be in the freaking Army. You’ll never see him.”<br />
<br />
Kumi bit her lip in frustration, she hate the fact that she knew about the other timeline sometimes. When the girls had traveled to see the other Samantha’s wedding she had seen her doppelgänger and more importantly she had seen what her future family could look like. What Kumi had never told Lisa, what she had even kept from her twin, was how much she wanted that life. Ever since she had held her doppelgängers son she had wanted nothing more than to get to know Cole. She had mentioned trying to have Claudia give Cole her number but she had never mentioned how she had daydreamed of a possible future with the young man. Sighing she now grabbed Lisa, pulling her to a quieter part of the club.<br />
<br />
“Lisa,” she said slowly. “When we were at the other Samantha’s wedding, I know you were looking at our doppelgängers, and their kids.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah so,” Lisa said quickly, slightly flustered by the question. Kumi raised an eyebrow as she looked her friend over. “I know you felt it Lisa,” Kumi said. “You felt something looking at your possible daughter cause I felt the same thing looking at my possible son.”<br />
<br />
“That’s ridiculous,” Lisa said quickly. “Bullshit,” Kumi scoffed. “I saw the look on your face when Lynne was dressed as a flower girl. You damn near cried, I saw you.”<br />
<br />
“She was cute,” Lisa responded. <br />
<br />
“Your not one to cry over something cute,” Kumi frowned. “You cried because deep down you think that one day that will be your daughter. I know because I did the same thing when I saw Tommy carrying the ring. I know it’s crazy Lisa but god, I never thought I would want something so bad. I want to have a shot at that future.”<br />
<br />
“But that’s not our future,” Lisa said. “We don’t know if that will even happen.”<br />
<br />
“Easy for you to say,” Kumi snorted. “You and Jason are a couple. You have a shot. Cole, he doesn’t even know I exist. Ever since we met our doppelgängers all I’ve wanted is a shot at him. I can’t even get that, everyone thinks I’m just some airhead kid. Mika and Shiros irresponsible sister. Please, let me at least try to get what my doppelgänger has.”<br />
<br />
Lisa bit her lip, sighing as she gazed at her best friend. Of all the people in the world she could relate to what Kumi was going through. She had seen what her possible future could look like and loved everything about it. A husband, a child, a job with her best friend. Lisa was lucky that she and Jason were together, things were probably unbearable for Kumi knowing that Cole didn’t even know she existed. “Okay,” Lisa relented. “Just be careful okay? You can talk with him but don’t tell him anything about magic.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you,” Kumi smiled, hugging her friend. “I’ll be right back.” Taking a deep breath Kumi straightened her dress out as she now began to approach the young cadet.<br />
<br />
A million thoughts raced through Kumi’s mind as she slowly walked towards Cole Harris. To be honest she didn’t know a lot about Claudia’s brother. She had seen the young man sparingly over the years, which as Kumi thought about it was somewhat embarrassing. She had first met the boy when she was 10 and Cole had been a 15 year old freshman. Kumi had been playing at the park with Claudia and their friends, Cole begrudgingly watching the 4th graders swing on the swings and play in the playground. Kumi had been a sweaty mess, covered in dirt as Cole babysat her. At the time she had thought nothing of the large boy, now though she hoped to make a good impression. Clearing her throat she smiled, looking up at the large young man.<br />
<br />
“Hi,” Kumi said with a smile. “Couldn’t help noticing you. Guess your a bit surprised by the new look to the club.”<br />
<br />
“Yea just a bit,” Cole said. “What’s going on here anyway? What’s with all the animal people?”<br />
<br />
“Anthros,” Kumi corrected. “They’re called anthros. They’re kind of new to town, guess they weren’t around last time you were here?”<br />
<br />
“No cant say they were,” Cole said. “When I came home from college for winter break no animal people around period.” Cole paused looking into Kumikos eyes as he smiled and extended his hand. “I’m Cole by the way,” he grinned. “Haven’t seen you before? You new in town?”<br />
<br />
“No I go to school around here,” Kumi smiled. “And I’m Kumiko, nice to meet you Cole.”<br />
<br />
Cole smiled, his cheeks flushing slightly as he gazed at the magically aged up teen. As they began to talk Kumiko could only sigh as she lovingly gazed at the young man. Four months ago she wouldn’t of given the serious, straight laced, military man a second look. Now, after experiencing magic, alternate timelines, evil sorceresses, And anthro people, meeting Cole was a welcome bit of normalcy. Now Kumi could only hope that she could make a good first impression. That and keep Kellie and Claudia from finding out she and Lisa had snuck off to the club and were flirting with Claudia’s older brother.</p>
