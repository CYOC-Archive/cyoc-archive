<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Norman reached the front door, the phone rings behind him in the kitchen. For a second, he just planned to go out anyway. Someone else could answer the phone. But then he grinned, even annoyed as he was by the phone. Who could answer? His parents weren´t home, and neither his tail nor his wings could talk on the phone now, right? As for the plushies, that would be even funnier. So, with a sigh, he returned to answer the phone.<br />
“Hello?” he spoke simply.<br />
“Hello, Norman, I guess? You sound deeper than normal. Can you get me Adrian on the phone?” Mrs. Turner asked. As their neighbor, she knew them all enough to recognize him even as he sounded a bit different.<br />
“I´m sorry, he isn´t there right now” Norman answered with a grin, patting his tail. “Maybe I can help you?”<br />
She seemed to consider it for a few seconds. “Okay Norman, we can try. Would you be able to look after the twins for an hour or two? I need to get to an appointment in half an hour, and if Adrian isn´t available…” she sighed.<br />
Norman frowned shortly, knowing the two four-year-olds could be a pain. He had some-times been with Adrian watching them. Then another grin bloomed on his face. He could easily add them to his collection. He even got an idea what they could become for his body. “I will come over, no problem. I´m sure they will behave.”<br />
After thanking him, they cut the call, and Norman went over to their house, still a naked hu-man with a fleshly tail and just as fleshly wings, hiding his genitals in a sheath. He would need to find out how his magic could affect a whole area, or he would get problems soon. If there wasn´t a way to make him appear normal to more people, he would need something akin to a disguise to look normal and dressed. Then there also were that people would no-tice Brian, Adrian, and Janine, as well as Sam and Tom soon, missing. That would be easier with the first way of a solution. It would be a pain to hypnotize everyone after another.<br />
<br />
When Norman rung the bell, it took only seconds for Mrs. Turner to open the door, already waiting for him. Her face quickly turned to shock for him being naked. Her sentence changed after a few seconds of starring in silence. “Ah Norman, the twins are in their … What happened to you? Why are you naked?”<br />
Norman calmly used his hypnotic powers on her. “Don´t worry, everything is normal for me. You called me for walking your dog because of your appointment. After all, you life alone with your dog, but he can´t come along, right?” He made her forget the twins easily, and her old dog the reason for his visit, simply so he had a reason to be over now. After all, why would he be over now when she needed to be on her way?<br />
Mrs. Turner nodded slowly, and as Norman hypnosis ended, quickly thanked him again for walking her dog before departing. Norman chuckled at her behavior as he went in, lightly petting her dog in the kitchen. The old dog knew him, so after one bark-like greeting, it re-turned to sleep. Norman knew that he had been walked just half an hour agon, as Mrs. Turner kept a routine on the time. She just forgot it with Norman´s reasoning for being over now.<br />
A minute later, he heard footsteps on the stairs, and then the twins stood in the door, and starred at him in wonder and shock. After a bit more than a minute, Sam asked: “Norman? Is that you?”<br />
“Hi Sam and Tom. Yeah, I´m me. Do I look so different?” Norman greeted them before grin-ning.<br />
Both their eyes widened before Tom said: “You are huge. And you got a tail and wings.” “You look like a dragon, only without scales, claws and with a human head.” Sam added.<br />
“Oh that? Nothing new. But thanks for comparing me to a dragon, Sam.” Norman laughed at their reaction. Only children would ignore him being naked. But if he would be a dragon, he would be naked, right? <br />
Deciding to change them now, so he could finally go test his wings, he turned his hypnosis on again, instantly having them under his control. “Now, Sam and Tom, you will soon be part of my body, but before that, I want you to go grab your favorite plushies each and come back to me. Oh, and leave your clothes in your room, you won´t need them anymore.”<br />
When the hypnosis faded, both Tom and Sam nearly run to their room. Once there, both stripped of their shorts, socks, and shirts, throwing them onto their beds. Their underwear went last onto their piles, before the now naked twins searched their respective favorite plushies. A minute later Sam returned to Norman, now in the living room, holding a mostly light-brown wyvern in his arms, with some kind of emblem in black on red ground on its chest. Tom returned a few seconds later with a similar light brown griffin plush, featuring a golden, lion-like emblem on blue ground. What Norman didn´t know, not that it would be important, they were both a gift from their older brother, who lived in another town, repre-senting his favorite game.<br />
“Now, are you two ready to become a part of me?” Norman asked, and both boys, still un-der his hypnotic command from before, said “Yes”, sounding ecstatic about the idea. “Maybe they would have said yes even without the hypnosis, but not to their “new home”” Norman thought, grinning. He got down on all fours before commanding them: “Okay, put your plushies down next to my head and in front of your feet. Next, you will lean forward and kiss my temples, Sam on the right and Tom on the left. From there on, your bodies will merge to my head. While your bodies will mostly become my new horns to the sides of my head, a third horn will grow on my nose, which will be twisted out of all your arms together. Finally, when my horns are finished, your mind will move into the plush you brought down each.”<br />
And so, it started. Simultaneously, both boys kissed Norman´s temples after dropping their plushies at their feet beside him. Norman had seen both had a slightly shocked look in their eyes, so they were understanding what the final command meant. He grunted when, after a tickle merged their lips to his temples, they soon lifted their legs into the air, only hold by their connection to him. Their arms were sucked into their shoulders, only to grow back out of his nose, but already far smaller than before. All four arms then twisted with each other, forming one construct of flesh, before it hardened into a diamond-hard horn, their fingertips becoming its sharp tip.<br />
Meanwhile their bodies also twisted themselves, already shrunken smaller. The head had become narrower, features already vanished and hair fallen out. It was now indistinguisha-ble from their neck or body, which also had narrowed down. It turned narrower the further down it went their bodies, their waist only half as wide as their heads, their twisted feet not even as thick as their little fingers had been, with their toes becoming the very tip of that horns, sharp as a needle. It also hardened each body like the third horn from their arms, and with that, Norman now had three twisted horns, each around a foot long, colored as dark-brown as Norman´s hair.<br />
With a roar that would fit a real dragon, Norman welcomed his new additions, also shooting a load of cum onto the floor before him, between his hands. After a minute of afterglow, he lowered his head, pointing his new horns down also, nearly stabbing the two plushies sit-ting there. Seconds later, his mental push shot out the twins into their new prison, namely their plushies. Sam was now trapped inside the wyvern plush, while Tom was in the griffin. Both plushies had their eyes glowing a few seconds before they were laying there, indistin-guishable from any normal plush toy.<br />
Norman sat back onto his legs, grinning madly at the two plushies on the floor. “Thanks guys. I will put these horns to good use, even if only for showing off. I hope you enjoy your new life in your favorites, they will fit right in with the others in my room. Now, I will look at these horns in the mirror.” With that said, Norman stood up, taking both plushies from the ground to set them on the table, before heading for the bathroom. Yes, the horns were pre-fect to him. Only he would need a muzzle to make the third horn look even better.<br />
Satisfied after watching the horns from all sides in the mirror, Normal went up to the twin´s room, inspecting their other plushies. Maybe he found another that he could use later for another “generous” person to gift him their body. Soon, Norman left the Turner house with a few additions in a bag, while he carried both the wyvern and the griffin in his arms. He headed home to set them onto the shelf next to his siblings and friend, the other´s placed down still inside the bag on his bed, before heading off, finally to test his wings.<br />
Back in his room, both Sam and Tom were now fully aware again, and couldn´t believe they were now trapped inside their plushies, sitting next to each other, and yet had never felt more apart in their lives. They couldn´t reach each other, not talk, nothing.</p>
