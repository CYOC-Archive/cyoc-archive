<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Out of all of the four places you could have run to the only one that seemed to be able to support your current state of nakedness was the fetish shop. The very fact that it was a shop catering to fetishes meant that there would either be people inside sympathetic to your current issue of public nakedness... as that was, in and of itself, a fetish... or it would be entirely empty and you would still be safe. As the wind picked up, blowing cool fall air onto your naked genitals and the sounds of howling could be heard in the distance, you decided that it would be best to just get inside to a sort of safety. You hoped, as you ran into shop, that if there were people in there... they were there for the fetish stuff and not just normal people hiding like you were. As you ran &quot;blindly&quot; into the shop, you would have stopped and gone the other way if you had noticed the sign above the door being an ornately carved wooden plaque of a werewolf muzzle howling to the full moon with the name of the shop &quot;Full Moon Fetishes&quot; written in a bold style font, carved deep into the wood to make sure it would remain there permanently and not fade to the wiles of time.<br />
<br />
As you opened the door, a small bell above it chimed, alerting anyone to the fact that the door had opened and there was a customer inside, ready to look at the wares for sale. Nervously you peered into the store, your eyes having a little bit of a hard time adjusting to the dimmer light in the place and shakily called out &quot;H-hello...?&quot; as you continued to look around.<br />
<br />
Initially, no one had replied to your call and you called out again, this time a bit more sure of yourself. &quot;Hello... is anyone there?&quot; You asked aloud as your eyes gleaned over the various sexual items in the store, none of which really struck your fancy and you continued to wander as you also forgot about being naked in the store as your hands fell away from your average sized genitals. In fact, your mind began to ponder if there was anything in the store that catered to a guy like you. You always had a fantasy, a fetish, for very thick cock, tons and tons of thick... gooey and syrup-like precum and even more thick, voluminous amounts of cum. Granted... it was something that you wanted from another guy... or two at the same time, but you couldn&#39;t help wonder if there was something in there that would make a couple guys how you liked... since they were a bitch and a half to find out there in the vastness of the world.<br />
<br />
Seeing nothing and hearing no one, you just continued to wander until you got to an aisle that was just labeled as &quot;Cum Fetish&quot; and you felt your face grow hot as the blood rushed to your cheeks, not thinking about how it rushed to your cock as well at the same time. As your eyes scanned over the products, you failed to notice the presence of two large, hulking, powerlifter sized men in police uniforms standing there, looking at you and your erection from looking at all the stuff having to do with being the receiver of lots of male sexual fluids.<br />
<br />
The one officer took in a short, quick breath and looked to the other one, quietly saying &quot;well... ain&#39;t he an unusual human... he ain&#39;t like one of us... yet... and here he is acting like one of us. Ain&#39;t that right Angus?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope... sure ain&#39;t Duncan, but he soon will be once he gets a load of us... and several from us. I am sure we could both help the guy out... should we git naked or stay in uniform?&quot; Angus pondered aloud, quietly asking his partner on the force and for a few years now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw... I think we should stay as we are... you know how hot it is to transform while in our uniforms, bursting from them as we let out the wolf... I&#39;m sure he&#39;d love it too since he&#39;s here, but then again... he may have escaped from one of our other brothers who tried to rape the guy.&quot; Duncan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That definitely may be Duncan... shall we see what the case is and help our new found cumslut out?&quot; Angus asked with a wry grin, all the while you were completely immersed in some of the products on the shelf that claimed to help guys be more productive but was something that would happen over time and not as quickly as you would have cared for.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erhm... is there something we can help you find sir... perhaps some pants?&quot; Angus said, putting away his slightly lazy accent and speaking a bit more clearly as would be expected of a cop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... erhm... yeah... sorry about that officer. Ehrm... officers. I was attacked a while back on the street as one of the human safehouses was recently attacked by werewolves and all they wanted to do was fuck.&quot; You said truthfully, thinking you could trust the two police officers standing there, being men of the law and everything. &quot;So... I ran in here, thinking I would find safety and no one would care about my nakedness either.&quot; You added, noticing that you had an average-sized erection sticking out from your pelvis of six inches in length and about two in girth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... yeah... the werewolf apocalypse definitely isn&#39;t something we thought we would have to deal with. We always joked and thought it was gonna be zombies or a version of the undead... not big, burly, powerful, furry and manly beasts. So... you like what you were looking at, did you?&quot; Duncan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah... I... I can&#39;t help it. I love the idea of a guy producing tons of thick, gooey, syrupy pre for me to enjoy... that and huge loads of cum.&quot; You answered plainly, feeling free and confident to do so, given the situation you were in. There was no denying it, your cock told the truth before words ever could. Not to mention you were half-naked, in a kink store, with two huge and very burly and amazingly attractive men. It was then that you noticed that they were both sporting huge, thick bulges in their uniform pants and your mouth hung open, drooling a bit as you forgot to swallow your own saliva.<br />
<br />
The two men grinned and Angus nodded for you to follow them into the back. &quot;Well... if that is the case, how about we show you some more of the very same content in the back? This store has been something of a hobby for both of us since the owner gave it to us and we love the same thing you do!&quot; Angus said with a mischevious grin, obviously up to something with his partner Duncan. &quot;We have been collectors of strange and kinky things for a while and thought... why not open a store and share what we like and have collected with the rest of the world? I mean... I know others have to be out there that share similar interests or might find such things interesting after seeing it for the first time, getting their feet wet... so to speak... you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot; You said, trailing off while walking with the two big, burly, thick bulged officers... their hands placed on your back, one on each side, guiding you along until you reached the back room together.<br />
<br />
The three of you stepped through the door jam, one at a time in a single-file line, Angus first while turning to face you, smiling and showing off sharper than normal bicuspids with you between him and Duncan. Duncan closed the door as he passed through and grinned to his partner as both of their bodies started to swell and press against the police uniforms, as Angus grunted and adjusted himself before you making your eyes bulge and your mouth salivate a bit more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... you will fit right in nicely with me and Duncan there!&quot; He said as he outstretched his meaty arms welcoming you to their back room, which was large having a massive King sized bed against the wall against the back of the room. In front of that was a television hung and freely dangling on thick chains that were anchored to the ceiling joists. You noticed a few cords wrapped around and through some of the chain links for what had to be the power and the media lines. Along the rest of the walls were bookcases and shelves full of bukake style videos, toys designed to really make a man cum and even more importantly... supplements designed to help men become cum producing beasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! All of this stuff is really amazing! D-do you guys live here?&quot; You asked, not noticing Duncan locking the room and the two getting larger, causing their uniforms to strain further as well as their ears pointing a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We used to live in separate places before we met each other on the force. We were assigned to be each other&#39;s partners on the beat and after spending a whole lot of time together and learning about each other, especially things we both enjoyed both in and out of bed, we decided to live together. Shortly after that... we came up with the idea of this store, made it happen and tended to spend a whole lot of time here. We didn&#39;t really get to see one another outside of the day job as officers, so we decided to make this place our home since we were already practically spending all of our time here anyway. Then... well... we decided to keep all of this cum centered kink to ourselves, suspecting we would find someone into it just as much as we are. In fact... we are major feeders ourselves and we both love having a guy feed from our cocks.&quot; Angus explained some of their back story to you while he rubbed his bulge, getting it even bigger and thicker... to an obscene level, but you weren&#39;t complaining... in fact, you were mesmerized by it and wanted to give it a taste the more and more you heard from him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya look like you want this big bone of mine... don&#39;t ya?&quot; Angus said, giving the base of the bulge a big squeeze, getting his pre to the tip for you to taste like you knew you wanted.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t say anything, but you smiled and gave a slight nod in agreement that you did... in fact... want what the both of them were offering, not realizing anything else that was going on... especially that the two of them were a part of the werewolf incursion you had been trying to get away from earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;You... you two are really feeders... like... really? H-how much pre and cum can you both make?&quot; You asked as your voice quivered and cracked from excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... we&#39;ve never measured before, but no one ever complained either. Any guy who has ever fed from us has never walked away disappointed.&quot; Duncan said as he walked toward where you and Angus were standing. Both of them were hairier, bulkier, pressing their uniforms to a greater limit than thought possible as their hulking hairy bodies were tightly being contained within and slowly pushing their clothes to give way as a few rips had manifested, showing bulky muscled flesh underneath and hair growing in more and more to the point of nearly being like fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... are you ready for what&#39;s next there guy?&quot; He said with a lewd fanged grin as your lust addled mind didn&#39;t really comprehend what was going on. You had no idea that you were in the midst of the two most potent feeder werewolves in their army, in their den, locked inside and about to become that which you were trying to keep from becoming after all of this time.</p>
