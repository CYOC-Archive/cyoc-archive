<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The demonic wolf moved too fast for the girls to avoid his attack. The wolf grabbed Allison and sunk his fangs into her left shoulder. She cried out in pain and felt a burning sensation spread from her shoulder throughout her entire body. The wolf let her go and she fell to her knees. This was it. She was going to become one of these demonic wolves.<br />
<br />
Suddenly she heard four new voices. She opened her eyes and saw four foxes with wings descend. They were different colors. One was white, one silver, another brown, and the other one beige. The brown one said &quot;Get those girls out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This one has been bitten&quot; the silver one said standing next to her. &quot;She's not changing though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the other two out of here then&quot; the brown one said. &quot;Get them to safety then come back. Erica, neutralize the demonic power coursing through her now then get her out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't allow you to take away my new recruits angel&quot; the big wolf said.<br />
<br />
Allison could feel the power trying to change her and she was afraid that she wouldn't be able to fight it much longer. As the big wolf lunged at the brown winged fox the silver one, Erica, placed a cross on her shoulder. Fire raced through her as the demonic and angelic powers fought each other in her body. Out of the corner of her eye she saw the other wolves leaping into the fray. It looked like they were going to kill the angels instead of trying to convert them. The white and beige angels summoned staffs from nowhere and fended off the attacks.<br />
<br />
Allison saw one of the wolves coming at Erica and she knew that if she were forced away that the demonic power would claim her. She instinctively said the first thing that came to mind, &quot;Winged Panther Spirit!&quot; A glowing white panther with wings sprang from her body and knocked the wolf aside. It didn't disappear as she had expected but continued to roam around and knock aside the wolf creatures.<br />
<br />
Jen and Marry had to dodge many attacks from the wolves though it didn't seem like they were in danger of being killed. Suddenly Marry grew tired of constantly dodging attacks and said the first thing that came to her mind, &quot;Tangled Root!&quot; Roots sprang up from the ground and wrapped themselves around the legs of a couple of the wolves. Seeing the success she continued to use that to stop the other wolves from attacking.<br />
<br />
One wolf was able to avoid Marry's attack and got to Jen. It grabbed her and in the process gave her some deep cuts. She was able to twist away receiving more cuts and said &quot;Healing Spirit!&quot; A pink beam shot out of her hand and hit the wolf that had grabbed her.<br />
<br />
The wolf howled in pain and started to shrink. It's muzzle flattened into a human face. The black fur receded into it's body. It's claws shrank to finger and toenails. It's muscles diminished and breasts began to grow from it's chest. It's fur on it's head grew longer and changed to red. It's ears moved down the side of it's head and rounded becoming human ears again. Finally the lady they had witnessed being transformed a few minutes ago was kneeling on the ground trying to cover herself up with her arms since she didn't have any clothes on.<br />
<br />
The brown angel had been fighting the big wolf and seemed to be winning. When the big wolf saw that one of his soldiers had been transformed back he said &quot;You angels shall pay for that. I will reclaim that soul for my army.&quot; A red glow surrounded him and the other wolves. The glow faded and they were gone.<br />
<br />
With the threat gone Marry and Allison's attacks vanished as well. Erica took the cross off Allison's shoulder and went over to Jen. She placed the cross against Jen's skin.<br />
<br />
Allison looked at her shoulder and wasn't surprised to see the bite mark on it. Her shoulder was bleeding but it didn't seem to be that bad. Jen told the angels where she lived and that Marry and Allison were staying there too. Three of the angles wrapped their wings around them and they were back in Jen's room.<br />
<br />
A little later the girls had transformed back and Jen and Allison had been patched up by a transformed Slifer. He had transformed into a humanoid doctor to tend to their wounds. Now Allison's arm was in a sling to help take pressure off her shoulder. Jen was lucky that most of her cuts weren't that deep and only a few needed stitches.<br />
<br />
All three girls were sitting on Jen's bed while Charlene was reading them the Riot act. &quot;I told you to let the angels handle them!&quot; she said. &quot;You're just kids and you don't know what you're dealing with! You're lucky you weren't killed! Thank God my sisters showed up when they did otherwise you could be dead or worse! What were thinking taking on demonic forces?! You weren't thinking! What would I have told your mother Marry had you been killed or recruited into that damned army?! While you're here you're my responsibility! I will be telling your mother about this! As for you two, you're both grounded for a month! You will not be allowed to have any friends over! You will go to school and come home! That's it! You will not be allowed to use the computer or watch the telly! You will be doing chores that Slifer says you are well enough to do! You will not be transforming during that time s hand over your necklaces!&quot; She held out her hand and sighing Jen and Allison handed over their necklaces. &quot;I had been kidnapped and had become little more than a doll!&quot; she continued after receiving the necklaces. &quot;I want you two to think about how I would have felt if something similar had happened to you or you died. Marry, think about how your mother would have felt!&quot; Tears were streaming down her face now and she stopped.<br />
<br />
The four fox angels had stood by during all of this. Finally the brown one, Viki, said &quot;You may be magical girls but you're still young. You don't have the experience to take on demonic forces. You don't get the benefit of emergency training like we had. Remember this. This isn't a game.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't how I wanted to see you again or meet your family&quot; the beige one, Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least we got to see each other again&quot; Charlene said. &quot;How is Janice and Tabra? I thought that they would be with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The white one, Luna said &quot;There's something you should know. Janice and Tabra are deader than dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Charlene asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They were forced to merge by a time constraint&quot; Viki said. &quot;We only had a day to take care of Tamthis before ten thousand djinn attacked the city. That also made it necessary for Tabra to give us some emergency training before she and Janice merged.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I missed so much but I don't regret my decision&quot; Charlene said. &quot;I can't thank you enough for saving them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We were doing what we chose to do and were made to do&quot; Erica said. &quot;I'm glad that we were able to help our niece or nieces as the case may be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charlene smiled at Erica then she became serious again. &quot;Alright girls&quot; she said. &quot;Time for bed and I don't want to hear any grumbling.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girls slipped between the sheets Jen and Allison having some difficulty. Charlene kissed Jen and Allison's foreheads then she and the fox angels left. All three girls laid there awake for awhile longer, tears streaming down their faces because they knew they had been stupid going after the demonic wolves. Charlene was right, they could have been killed or worse. The 'or worse' almost happened to Allison.</p>
