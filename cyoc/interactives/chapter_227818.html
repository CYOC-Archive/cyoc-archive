<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Thanks to the skylight in the master bedroom, Alison soon stirred from her slumber as the light shone on her and the bed she shared with her mate Jimmy. The anthro cougar slowly got up and took a look at her mate; he was still sleeping in the exact position he was playfully tossed into thanks to his twin brother and mate. Alison shook her head as the light gave her a better view of the juvenile prank the two played on Jimmy; his fur dyed into a kaleidoscope of colors, splotches of red, blue, green and yellow all over his course light brown fur. But what got Alison to really sigh in disapproval was some of the comments also magically branded on him.<br />
“Lightweight, prancing Bambi, fairy fart;” Alison reading the few that were visible. While she did find the comments humorous and fitting thanks to last night’s Christmas party at her father in laws restaurant; Alison didn’t want to make her mate’s morning any worse than the hangover he was sure to suffer through. Plus she didn’t want their cub Jimmy J.R to see his father in his state; so with the runes glowing on her wrists, Alison watches as the coloring and branding disappear; leaving Jimmy Proudhoof as he was before he passed out drunk from too much rum filled egg nog.<br />
<br />
With that task done, Alison felt the need to deal with another pressing matter; relieving herself as the need to pee came on strong. Walking to the master ensuite, Alison makes it in time to sit on the toilet just as her bladder decides to no longer hold back and lets loose a torrent of piss into the porcelain bowl. She cradles her growing belly; gently rubbing the round protrusion as she suddenly relaxes her bowel and goes number two.<br />
“I bet most of this is your doing,” Alison speaking; her comments directed towards the developing fetus growing inside her; “just four more months and I’ll be having you suckle on my swollen fur covered tits.” She sighs as she feels her bladder and bowel finally empty; getting up and heading to the bidet next to the toilet, the pregnant cougar fury shudders as the cold jet of water blasts both orifices clean. “Now to deal with a hungry feline,” Alison remarking as she leaves the bathroom; the sound of the toilet flush slowly disappearing as she closes the door behind her.<br />
<br />
As Alison walked down the hallway, she paused to see both Michael and Denise Proudhoof asleep in the spare bedroom; the smell of their rutting still lingering as the stag-deer and tigress fury couple had a vigorous moment of passion prior to falling asleep. The two decided to crash here last night instead of risking the streets driving home from the restaurant. Alison did note that the snow started to fall just as she drove herself and her mate home; Brittany and Jake also with her as she needed their help to haul Jimmy inside. She would have done it herself, but played the pregnancy card and guilted the two to help. So when she walked downstairs and paused to see the couple sleeping in the living room, Brittany couldn’t help herself as her runes glowed and both Brittany and Jake were sporting a patchwork dye job just like they gave Jimmy last night. Branding Brittany and Jake with a few choice phrases, the cougar fury gave a light chuckle as she ambled to the kitchen. Dickens was already their clearly making noise as the cat proceeded to torment Alison for breakfast.<br />
<br />
About twenty minutes later, Alison hears the sound of the toilet flushing; shortly after then the sounds of hooves could be heard on the hardwood floor. Turning up from her phone she sees Michael standing at kitchen; his cervine penis still out of its sheath as he stumbled towards the coffee pot.<br />
“How fresh is the pot,” Michael pouring himself a cup as he takes a seat by the kitchen island, sipping the brew and noting that it was a bit strong.<br />
“Fresh enough to help knock back the hangovers a few of you are sporting,” Alison answering; looking up to see Denise also entering the kitchen, Alison noticed the anthro tigress had a smile on her muzzle as she poured herself a cup of joe.<br />
“What happened to Jake and Brittany,” Denise sipping the coffee; &quot;they look like they went to a hippie commune and came back all tie-dyed.”<br />
<br />
Alison smirks as she regaled to both Michael and Denise how the anthro wolf and stag-deer fury couple decided to play a prank on a passed out drunk Jimmy. Dying his fur and branding some pithy comments on his fur; Alison decided that turnabout was fair play and gave them a taste of their drunken impish impulses.<br />
“Yeah,” Michael chuckling as he finishes his first cup of coffee and pours himself a second; “I guess most had too much to drink last night.”<br />
“I hope everyone got home safe,” Denise getting up to look out the kitchen window; “looks like we had a major snowfall last night.” She looks to see the backyard buried in several feet of snow; wondering if the roads are clear, she heads to the living room, stepping over the still sleeping couple and looking past the curtains. What she saw was amazing; the front yards also buried in snow, the roads looking like they were plowed multiple times as a massive snowbank boarders the street on both sides.<br />
<br />
“You better get breakfast going,” Denise entering the kitchen; “looks like it’s all paws on deck to shovel that mess.”<br />
“That bad,” Michael looking surprised; wanting to check himself he took a quick glance out the kitchen window to see the backyard in a snowy state. “Perhaps we should head next door and rouse Edward and Julian up,” Michael putting his coffee down; “get them to help out as well.”<br />
“Let’s get some food in us first,” Denise sighing; “the smell of bacon is sure to wake everyone up.”<br />
 <br />
********<br />
<br />
Denise’s assumption of bacon was spot on; the smell of the pork product frying on a skillet soon had both Brittany and Jake up and slowly making their way to the kitchen, neither noticed the prank that Alison played on them until they saw the snickering coming from both Denise and Michael. It was then that they saw the dye job done on them and immediately looked at Alison; Alison for her part just grinned ruefully as she silently mouthed ‘cum dump’ towards Brittany. Alison gets up from her spot and heads to the back door; opening it up she scoops up a pawful of freshly fallen snow and heads upstairs. Moments later a deep howl could be heard, followed by the sound of paws smacking the floor hard as Alison heads back into the kitchen.<br />
“Jimmy is up,” Alison grinning; “he just needed some encouragement.”<br />
<br />
Soon the anthro stag-deer fury sporting a rack of alters totaling twelve points came down into the kitchen looking unamused. Brittany and Jake noticed that the prank they played on him was nowhere in sight, they looked at Alison and scowled as they realized that the cougar fury stole their fun.<br />
“Not funny,” Jimmy looking at his mate and giving her a grumpy stare as he pours himself a cup of coffee. Popping a couple of aspirin then taking a big swig of the bitter brew, he flops down on a chair by the small table as he watches his father fry up bacon.<br />
“I thought it was funny,” Alison giggling; “nothing like a cold icy shower to help kill a hangover.”<br />
“Only it was a snowball,” Jimmy grumbling; “and the bed is soaked because of it.”<br />
“Look outside,” Jake sipping his coffee; “we have a lot of shoveling to do. And that is before we make our way to the restaurant to clean up the mess we most likely left behind.”<br />
“The cubs are going to have a fun day,” Jimmy looking out the window; the snow reflecting the sunlight from the mostly clear sky made him wince as his hangover wasn’t going to go away without a fight.</p>
