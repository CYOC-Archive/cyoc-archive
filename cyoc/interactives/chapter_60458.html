<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bryan researched the Pleasure Cruise. He wanted to enjoy a transformation but be safe from Circe's traps. Everyone knew that a cruise with <br />
Circe was dangerous and that there were always guests who wound up permanently transformed. Brian didn't want to be one of these unlucky <br />
ones so he researched all the zones and all the rules and planned accordingly.<br />
<br />
He was hetero so he figured that booking in a male only zone was one way to stay safe. Although there were bound to be homosexuals in the <br />
male only zone, Bryan felt sure he could resist that temptation.<br />
<br />
The other decisions he had to make were more difficult. He had multiple interests so deciding which transformation to try was going to be <br />
difficult. He finally settled on a stretchable transformation and part of his decision was that the zone was located next to the size zone on one <br />
side, the ultra male zone on another side, and the living substance on a third. Besides, he believed that he knew which halls to take to get to <br />
any other zones he might try like the prehistoric zone if he decided to try being a Neanderthal. He booked for a whole month so he had time to <br />
change his mind and try several different transformations.<br />
<br />
The day came and he boarded the cruise. Already he began to worry as it wasn't as easy to find his way around as he hoped it would be. He <br />
happened to walk into an area where two naked male centaurs were admiring their transformations and Bryan immediately double checked to <br />
make sure he was in a safe zone. The only way he would be allowed to interact with centaurs was either in a safe zone or if Bryan had already <br />
been transformed into another mythological creature. Bryan decided to play it safe anyway so he backed away from the centaurs but bumped <br />
into a naked male Neanderthal. Circe's traps were cleverly placed. But so far, Bryan was safe.<br />
<br />
He walked carefully toting his luggage, making his way through the labyrinth of halls toward the stretchable zone where his room was located. <br />
Finally, he made it to the zone he was looking for and as he waited in the hall, he saw a naked man made out of gold having a conversation <br />
with a six inch tall naked man. Obviously most of the guest had already been transformed and Bryan was late because of having gotten lost. <br />
The gold man must be staying in the living substance zone and the tiny man was of course staying in the size zone.<br />
<br />
There was a staff member nearby and Bryan asked, &quot;I'm staying in the stretchable zone. Where do I go to be transformed?&quot;<br />
<br />
The staff member said, &quot;Right this way. You asked the right person since it's my duty to transform you. I hope you packed light since you won't <br />
need any clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan said, &quot;I packed a few clothes in case I wanted to visit another zone but yes I packed light.&quot;<br />
<br />
The staff member said, &quot;Good, go ahead and store the clothes your wearing in your suitcase and we'll make sure it gets to your room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan immediately got nervous. Now was the time. He was about to experience transformation for the first time. He also worried about being <br />
naked out here where women could walk by but that was part of the brilliance of choosing male only zones. There was little likelihood of a <br />
woman walking by and triggering an embarrassing response on Bryan's part.<br />
<br />
Once Bryan was naked, the staff member pointed to a small slit in the wall. &quot;This is the entrance for the stretchables. Just stick some part of <br />
you in there and wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan stepped up and hesitantly put his finger in the slot. Immediately something took hold of his fingers. It felt like rollers pulling him in and <br />
flattening him as it went. Bryan panicked and tried to pull his finger out but it wouldn't let go. Bryan then reminded himself that this was what <br />
he wanted. He made himself relax and the rollers slowly pulled more and more of him in. He almost panicked again when the rollers got to his <br />
head. His vision was distorted and Bryan wondered if the distortion was only because he needed to adjust to having his eyes on a floppy flat <br />
head. Then again, his face almost immediately was buried in a pile of himself so that he couldn't see anyway. He could move. He could tell that <br />
he could move. But he needed some practice since his muscles and bones worked differently in a flattened state. He'd have to relearn moving <br />
almost like having to relearn how to walk.<br />
<br />
Bryan felt a wave of embarrassment again as the rollers approached his lower body. He could tell that his lower body was lifted in such a way <br />
that his naked parts must have been a sight, hanging off the side of the wall. Then they were flattened and joined the rest of him in a pile.<br />
<br />
When it was finally done, Bryan wondered if they were just going to leave him there since he couldn't walk about yet or do anything. Then he <br />
felt hands picking him up and stretching him.<br />
<br />
The staff member said, &quot;There you are, nice and stretchable. And don't worry, you won't stay flattened. You'll fill out and be able to flatten <br />
yourself again when you want or just stretch around like Mr. Fantastic. However, I can tell this is your first time so I recommend that you spend <br />
time being looked after by someone till you figure yourself out. I took the liberty of asking Bruno here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel yourself being stretched out more and then you start feeling skin contact all over you. Before you realize what's happening, you are <br />
wrapped around Bruno like a makeshift toga. He's wearing you and he's heading for the pool in the safe transition zone. Then you realize that <br />
the way he's wearing you has placed his cock right in front of your face. You know this is another trap of Circe. If Bruno can get you to suck <br />
him, you'll be stretchable for the rest of your life and never return to normal. You must resist.</p>
