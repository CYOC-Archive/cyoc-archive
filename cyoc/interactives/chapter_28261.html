<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam lay in bed for hours after Dean had left the room.  He couldn't get to sleep, but he felt so tired.  Like his body was pumping out energy that was getting drained moments later to be stored for some unknown event.  Sam looked around the room to pass the time noticing small irregularities that though minor in this situation were very disturbing.  There were no phones, no clocks, no T.V, and no may of contacting the outside world.  Looking around the room he saw a mirror pointed right to him.  For some reason the mirror's image seemed so alluring as he stared back at himself.  Something about it seemed to trigger something in his mind.   As he stared at himself in the mirror he suddenly found himself getting aroused... very aroused.<br />
<br />
Sam doing what he normally does turned over onto his stomach and tried to hide and ignore his problem.  After what seemed like a eternity of his dick pressing hard against the zipper of his jeans he finally figured what the hell this would probably be his only alone time for a long time with Dean always being nearby since he had pulled him away from school to help find their dad.  Sam brought his hand under the covers and started to slowly jerk off.  Sam soon flipped back on his stomach and unzipped his fly, and began to resume as a brisker pace.<br />
<br />
Sam moaned as he reached climax.  Sam passed right out as he orgasmed never noticing how his dick had shot out a thick wad of something other then cum that just sat on his chest not absorbing into his clothing and not detaching from Sam's still hard dick.<br />
<br />
The white blob started to ripple and grow. As it grew past the size of a small orange it began to take the shape of a human baby.  The increasing weight on Sam's stomach caused him to turn on his side in his sleep.  The blob continued to become more human, changing color to match Sam's skin, hair exactly like Sam's grew on the now child like blob's head.  More hair grew on the child's arms and legs as it seemed to pass puberty.  It's aging slowed down as it reached Sam's age.<br />
<br />
As the strange transfer finished Sam's dick gave a final twitch as it detached from the other beings own dick.  With growth finished Sam's new completely naked twin gave a yawn stretching his arms, then turning and snuggling into Sam.<br />
<br />
Morning came fast Sam turned as he woke up and felt his face touching bare skin.  Inhaling deeply he was about to rub himself against the person in the bed when he realized just what he was doing.  Opening his eyes he was about to apologize to Dean when he looked who it actually was.  Getting out of bed Sam walked around to the other side to see who it was.   Looking at him Sam suddenly had two reactions.  As he looked Sam couldn't believe what he was seeing it was him.  Staring at his naked twin's body Sam's eyes wandered lower.  Sam felt a familiar feeling as his own dick poked out of his boxers and out the fly of his jeans.  Startled Sam went to zip up only managing to trip over some discarded clothes and falling onto a table causing the other Sam to stir and wake up.<br />
&quot;Dean I um... we were just!&quot; he started to say when he noticed it was Sam in the room &quot;Oh dude you scared me I thought it was Dean walking in on us again&quot; he said sighing before he noticed Sam's badly concealed bulge &quot;So did Dean show up yet?&quot; he asked Sam who did a quick check in the mirror to see if he still looked like himself.  As Sam's back was turned his Twin got out of bed and walked up behind him.  Grabbing Sam he pushed him on the bed on his back then pounced on top of him pinning him down.<br />
&quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Sam said starting to struggle.<br />
&quot;Dean wont be back for a couple minutes at least and we are both obviously in the mood.&quot; he says pulling Sam's shirt off then looking into Sam's eyes with lust.  Sam felt the other him's dick getting hard against his chest.<br />
&quot;I don't know who you you think you are-&quot; Sam was about to say when his twin grabbed his aching shaft giving it a squeeze.<br />
&quot;I'll take that as a compliment, but encase you forgot you can call me Max!&quot; the twin says getting off Sam and sitting by his feet.<br />
&quot;Ok... um Max I have no idea who you...&quot; Sam began to say as Max leaned over and kissed Sam's dick causing him to moan.  Sam felt helpless he couldn't fight anymore he didn't want to.  Sam started moaning loudly almost screaming in pleasure as Max opened his mouth and started giving Sam a blowjob.<br />
<br />
Just then the door swung open and Dean burst into the room.<br />
&quot;Don't ask me where I've been I don't want to talk about it...&quot; He said rushing to the bathroom, then stopping looking back then continuing to the bathroom muttering &quot;Jesus Crist they are like fucking rabbits... weird freaky gay rabbits!&quot; as he slammed the door to the bathroom.<br />
&quot;Shit, does he ever knock?  Hes never going to give us any time by ourselves now.  Ever since he found out about our... you know hes gotten more and more distant... even for Dean!&quot; Max said to a still gasping and confused Sam.  &quot;Fine I'll go talk to him...&quot; Max says getting up<br />
<br />
&quot;Um Dean sorry you walked in on that we were just having a little fun... We didn't know you were going to...&quot; Max got interrupted as Dean opened the door to the bathroom. &quot;Whoa what happened to you!?&quot;</p>
