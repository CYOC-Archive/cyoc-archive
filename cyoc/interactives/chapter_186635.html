<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A new addition and maybe starting a path for them to become apex predators.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It doesn&#39;t take long for them to return to the campsite and pack up. Jahff kept in mind that they needed water, and there had been no rain for the past few days. There were not many things to be packed up other than the Chronivac and the meat he preserved by smoking and drying. But Jeff should always make sure. <br />
<br />
Zark was clearly in pain with the wound he left on him, but from the looks of it, the beta was clearly hydrated. Zark knew where there was water, and Jahff and Irae needed it despite the memories showing their liquid intakes could have at least four days before dehydration sets in. <br />
<br />
Jahff rummaged through the plant matter stockpile and extracted a single fruit that served as a medicinal poultice if prepared right. A quick and small fire ignited, he starts burning the fruit on a stick until the insides crack the shell from expansion, leaking transparent green ooze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here,&quot; Jahff demands of Zark, and he obliged. The smell from the fruit was horrible, but herbal medicines always smelled that way. Crushing the fruit open, Jahff stands up to hold Zark in place and slathers the oozing mush into the wounds. Zark of course roars in pain, but his hold on him was vice. Jahff growled at the struggling male. &quot;Stay still, it is healing. You are a male, endure it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Zark&#39;s struggles cease as he grit his teeth, the warm ooze scalding on his wounds. Jahff&#39;s claws were sterilized with the ooze&#39;s properties as he searched for the wounds inflicted before they get infected.<br />
<br />
Cleaning the residue to leave a small thin layer on the wounds, Jahff foraged nearby for long leaves that were then plastered over the wounds. There was no more bleeding, and there should be no more chance of an infection as well. Satisfied, Jahff extinguishes the fire. <br />
<br />
&quot;I can see that you had water,&quot; Jahff states to him. &quot;Show me the way.&quot; <br />
<br />
The beta nodded, hissing when his injuries flares in pain. Irae follows closely, hugging one of Jahff&#39;s thick arms. &quot;Zark found a river that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;East.&quot; Jeff remarks based on the direction the sun rises. Zark looks back to him in confusion. &quot;Direction of sunrise.&quot; Jahff clarified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Many things unknown of mate,&quot; Irae speaks up, licking her mate&#39;s neck and causing Jahff to react with a shudder at the affection, his wants flaring. &quot;Weird words.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jahff only hums, neither confirming nor denying. Of course, Jahff was subconsciously using the vocabulary that Jeff had in his brain, and it wasn&#39;t something that could be controlled. It was impossible to stay to the prehistoric memories of Jahff&#39;s vocabulary when so much was missing and his brain slotting them in automatically, something was bound to slip.<br />
<br />
From Zark&#39;s movements, the wounds we no longer a hindrance to him. It was to be expected as Jahff had used the medicine before. They walked to preserve energy, and also because Zark was still injured. It doesn&#39;t take much time, only an hour or so of walking evidenced by the timer ticking down on the device when they could hear the rapids and smell the scent of flowing water.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are here,&quot; Zark announces as he walks into a clearing, showing the flowing waters going down south. He takes no wait before he walks to the riverbank and leans down to drink. &quot;The water is clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Irae leaves Jahff&#39;s side to drink as well, leaning down to scoop clean water into her mouth. Jahff waited until they were done while staying alert to any other newcomers. Water was a resource many creatures shared, but it was home to some as well. <br />
<br />
Once his clanmates were done, it was Jahff&#39;s turn to drink. As was noted before, having a massive body required more sustenance as well. Food had been dealt with, but he needed water for quite some time. Quenching his thirst, Jahff sighs in relief. He stands to look at the river&#39;s flow, deciding. <br />
<br />
&quot;We go downstream and find the waterfall.&quot; Jahff takes the initiative and walks along the river.<br />
<br />
Irae once again latches onto his arms, striding along. &quot;Weird words mate. But Irae likes.&quot; Jahff growls in approval at her compliment.<br />
<br />
Zark seems once again confused with the words, but he puts it into his brain that &quot;downstream&quot; and &quot;waterfall&quot; were related to the river. He follows Jahff, but in his mind, he is sure that Jahff grew as strong and smart as he did with his wisdom, backed by his strength. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
They were once again met with the cliff as the river plunges into a waterfall below, and Jahff knew they would need to find a way down before they could camp. The Chronivac was still charging, but wasting the charge it had built on something as simple as finding a path would be stupid. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a waterfall.&quot; Jahff points to the river going over the edge and crashing a good 100 feet below. &quot;We will set up our clan near it, but we need a way down first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jahff walks forward to the edge to look down, seeing the big pool of water at the bottom of the waterfall. There was a clearing nearby that would be a good place to set up a home. Irae peers down but quickly retreat in fear.<br />
<br />
Looking around, Jahff could see a narrow path leading down. The problems include the fact that the path looks unsafe for sapient Tyrannosaurs, and that Irae is scared of heights. <br />
<br />
The Chronivac had enough charge for a minor change, such as introducing wings to him, making him a flying Tyrannosaur. But would it be wise to muck up his genetics with it?</p>
