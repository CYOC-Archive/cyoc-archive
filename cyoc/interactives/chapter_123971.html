<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jaclyn and Charlie close their eyes as they felt their bodies changing. Jaclyn and Charlie first thing they felt was their skin changing, Charlie&#39;s became a white while Jaclyn&#39;s became bright sugar pink. It coated their entire bodies and it tickled them as it spread. <br />
<br />
Jaclyn changed completely first. Her hair grew in length and was then styled into a pair of braids held by red bows, and turned bright yellow. Next more makeup began to appear on her face, white makeup outlined her eyes and mouth. Inside of the white on her eyes yellow eyeshadow appeared and on the upper edges black drawn on eyebrows came as her hairy trimmed eyebrows disappeared, like they were sucked back into her head. She then smiled and some darker pink blush came on her cheeks and her lips became ruby red and done up in a grin. Her glasses remained on her face but they morphed from their original black round shape frames to oval frames that were red with little glittering plastic sign on them. Next her clothes began to change, into a cut babydoll dress that was white with red trim and ruffles, and she had on white and yellow stockings, along with yellow and red Mary Janes that appeared on her feet, but they were size 20 with bubble toes. Her feet inflated into them. <br />
<br />
Next it was Charlie’s turn. His hair turned a nice blue color, and it exploded out until it was a messy mass in his head. Since his skin was already white makeup then appeared on his face. To begin his lower lip became bright red and twisted up into a smile, and his cheeks became emphasized with red blush. Next his eyelids were colored in with greed eyeshadow, three black freckles appeared on each cheek<br />
<br />
During this his clothes were changing, his original jeans and t shirt changed and morphed into a clown tux, he had a red jacket with blue trim, and shirt that was white with a blue bow tie. His pants also became blue and white striped with reversed color polka dots. His feet then doubled in size to about size 25 and they fit themselves into clown shoes that looked like oxfords with bubble toes, that were mainly white with blue tips, and red soles. The final addition was a blue and white top hat that appeared on his head of messy blue hair. <br />
<br />
Mental changes then went in, making them think they were always clowns, and their names changed from Charlie to Chuckles, and Jaclyn to Lizzy. <br />
<br />
The final changes to them were their noses changing, Lizzy’s nose became a petite round red nose, and Chuckles  became a large red ball about as big as a tennis ball. <br />
<br />
Then Frizzy and Tuck-Tuck opened the cabinet door and out stepped the two new clown teenager still holding hands. The two of them bowed and waddled off to the side waiting for the next transformation. <br />
<br />
(I did not write this part of the story, Darknight wrote it, I&#39;m just putting it in this branch because I think it&#39;s really good)<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon up here, kid!&quot; shouted Tucker. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re next!&quot;<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; shouted the boy. &quot;I&#39;m not getting into that thing!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh c&#39;mon, Billy!&quot; said the boy next to him.<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; said the girl right behind him. &quot;Don&#39;t be a spoil sport!&quot;<br />
After enough poking and prodding from the other guests, Billy finally got up and walked into the cabinet. &#39;But I ain&#39;t gonna let them put makeup and a stupid outfit on me,&#39; he thought. He hadn&#39;t even wanted to come to this stupid party, the only reason he did was because his mother and Jessica&#39;s (Now Frizzy) were old friends.<br />
&quot;This one&#39;s a real grouch, isn&#39;t he,&quot; whisped Tuck-Tuck to Jaime<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Jaime whispered back, rubbing Tuck-Tuck&#39;s pate; He giggled at the touch of her fingers on his bald head. &quot;And I&#39;ve got just the thing for him too,&quot; she added as she tapped the keys to the Chronivac. <br />
The door was closed and Billy just stood there, glum. &quot;Well?&quot; he said, but no one heard him; the cabinet had been soundproofed.<br />
Suddenly a bright light flashed over him and Billy saw his clothes change. His normal blue sweatshirt and jeans morphed into a rather good looking black suit-then became ripped and covered with colorful patches. His sneakeres stretched into size thirteen balck high top boots-one with an open to that showed his feet had stretched to match.<br />
If there had been a mirror in the cabinet, Billy would have seen white appear around his mouth and his eyes-then to his surprise, hair fell down next to his oversized feet. Billy touched his head in horror, there was none left, not even around the sides. &#39;I&#39;m bald!&#39;<br />
Billy wanted to scream, but no words came out. Although he had never been a very cheerful person, his mouth formed down into a permanent frown. His lower lip turned blue-black, and a black, painted on &#39;beard&#39; appeared around his muzzle.<br />
The final change to Billy happened as his nose swelled up into a big clown nose, only coal black instead of red like the others&#39;. A ridicuously wide purple tie with a sunflower appeared around his neck, and battered black bowler appeared on his bald head, then poor Billy&#39;s mind went blank.<br />
Cerimoniously, Jaime and Gigi opened the door to the cabinet. &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you,&quot; Tucker announced, &quot;Boxcar Billy!&quot;<br />
Billy stepped out and evenryone laughed at the sight of the new hobo clown. Bobo went up to him, then pulled down his pants; the guests all roared to see Billy&#39;s oversized boxers that, like the rest of his clothes, was worn and covered with patches.<br />
Billy felt his cheeks go red with embaressment, but what could he do. He was just a poor hobo clown and being humiliated by other clowns was to be his lot in life.<br />
<br />
(I wrote this part of the story.)<br />
<br />
Frizzy looked at the other eight clowns with her, the total now being 11 including herself and the two who went outside before. She was loving her brithday party, Jamie comnig over as a clown just like her (or so she thought) and then making her brothermore of her firends into clowns just like her. She loved it, and couldn&#39;t wait for who would be next, she decided that she wanted more sibling to be clwoned up like her, she went over to Jamie who was talking with Lizzy and Chuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jamie.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tall red haired clowngirl turned around and saw the brithday girl standing there before her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Frizzy,&quot; She said as she bent down so that her knees were bent and her rump was almost at the floor. &quot;Whats up?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much for everyhting, but I want to make more people into clonw sibling like me and my brother.&quot; Frizzy whispered gesturing to Chuckles who was chatting with Lizzy. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then, lets go pick out a few more.&quot; Jamie then said as she grinned even wider and squeezed Frizzy&#39;s nose, and then Frizzy squeezed Jamie&#39;s.<br />
<br />
Then, looking out into the crowd. The two of them picked...</p>
