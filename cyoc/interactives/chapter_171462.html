<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Madame Illusia and Stephan went ahead calling other spectators to the stage, and the magic show continued.<br />
The crowd forgot about him, caught up in the witch&#39;s spells, excluding the people closest to Daniel due to the stench coming from his diaper pooped.<br />
<br />
During the continuation of the evening the young man was distracted by the diaper and by the thoughts of how he could justify his new and improvvise incontinence. Absently observed the spectators who followed one another on the stage.<br />
<br />
Before the show was over, Daniel twice noticed that he was peeing in his diaper was he sit.<br />
He was amazed by those two pisses. If it weren&#39;t for the sensation of warm liquid bathing the skin around his penis, he wouldn&#39;t have even noticed.<br />
No warnings, no feel from his bladder and no voluntary commands. <br />
He was just, suddenly, peeing.<br />
It was a wonderful feeling for Daniel to have lost all control over those basic bodily functions.<br />
<br />
When the crowd left the tent at the end of the show, he felt he could finally get up too.<br />
His stinky diaper was glued to the skin of his bottom and as she stood up felt it peel off his skin, leaving it really gross.<br />
He returned close at the stage and when Stephan saw him, took the bag he promised him and walked down the stage.<br />
&quot;I guess you want your promise diaper bag, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yup ….&quot; Daniel replied embarrassed.<br />
&quot;For you&quot; He handed him the bag. Then he smiled and continued &quot;The next time you come to our tent, make sure you bring some clean replacement diapers, so when you pooped, you can go to the bathroom to change, and you won&#39;t have to sit in your dirty diapy for all the rest of the show. &quot;<br />
The young man blushed at those words and felt again that he was peeing in his full diaper. So, after taking the bag, Daniel left the tent and went without turning to his car.<br />
<br />
He was worried that his diaper was leaking onto the seats of his new BMW.<br />
After checking that his pants were still dry and clean, he sat in the driver&#39;s seat.<br />
Sitting up, he felt the dirt inside the diaper press under his butt again. The young man checked his pants again at the height of the groin and blushed when he saw two wet &quot;half moons&quot; where the padding of the diaper ended.<br />
<br />
Embarrassed, he started the car and drove home. After he parked, he grabbed the diaper bag, got out of the car and quickly entered the house.<br />
Daniel lived alone, and despite it being quite late that night, he was afraid that some of his neighbors would see him coming home with the outline of the diaper under his pants.<br />
Not to mention the smell of poop and pee and his wet pants<br />
<br />
After closing the front door, Daniel sat down on the sofa.<br />
He had done it without thinking about it, but the soggy, dirty feeling from the diaper made him stand up quickly.<br />
&quot;Stupid, the diaper was leaking&quot; he told himself.<br />
He checked the sofa, and saw two wet spots where he was sitting.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll have to clean it&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
He took the diaper bag and looked inside. It was divided into pockets and compartments and, starting with the largest ones, Daniel emptied it onto the living room table. He found some pants, a pair of socks and a T-shirt, two changing diapers, wipes, some talcum powder and a zinc ointment for diaper rash.<br />
Only two diapers, Daniel thought.<br />
<br />
After taking off his shoes, he went to the bathroom and undressed there, remaining dressed in only his soiled diaper.<br />
&quot;I need to buy  a diaper genie.&quot;<br />
He opened the water in the shower and when it was hot, he closed it. He fetched a garbage bag and carried it to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
At that point he sat down on the closed toilet, and opened the tabs of his diaper.<br />
When he opened it, he saw that the poop was everywhere, even on his dick. <br />
As soon as he saw the mess inside his diaper, he had to quickly pull it up against his groin again, because as often happens with babies at diaper changes, with fresh air on his penis, he started peeing.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds he had already stopped pissing but found that even though he pulled up his diaper to cover his penis, his piss had leaked out and Daniel sighed and thought he should have cleaned the bathroom a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will I also have to buy a absorbent changing pads&quot; thought Daniel.<br />
He got up from his wet and poopy diaper and entered the shower.<br />
<br />
Under the hot water, it took him some time to thoroughly cleanse all the dirt on his butt and between his thighs. As he washed, he decided that he would shave off all his hair inside the diaper.<br />
He took a new razor and after putting on some shaving cream, he shaved off all the hair on the groin.<br />
After cleaning, shaving and drying, the young man put on a diaper.<br />
<br />
Dressed in only a diaper, Daniel took care of throwing the dirty diaper into the garbage bag, and cleaning the bathroom of his pee.<br />
and finally went to bedroom.<br />
He took his summer pajamas, consisting of a shirt and light trousers.<br />
<br />
After getting dressed for the night, Daniel went to the closet and from the underwear drawer took all his underpants, including the ones he had in the washing machine, freshly washed and threw all them in the garbage bag where he had just thrown his poopy diaper.<br />
<br />
That done, Daniel went to bed.<br />
With the diaper between his legs, he struggled to fall asleep and even sleep. In fact, he woke up several times during the night, and was even tempted to take off his diaper to finally be able to sleep comfortably, but he also knew that from this night he would have to get used to sleeping with a thick diaper under his pajamas.<br />
<br />
When the alarm clock finally rang, Daniel was still feeling very tired.<br />
<br />
He got up and pulled down his pajamas in front of the mirror full image in his bedroom. He saw that his second diaper was really soaking wet.<br />
The young man was amazed. His diaper feeled at him wet, but not at the level he was discover.<br />
<br />
He looked at the bed and saw that it was dry. His diaper had done its job correctly.</p>
