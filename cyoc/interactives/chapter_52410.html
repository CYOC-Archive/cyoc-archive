<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Glen and Sam were too dumb to have realized that neither one of them <br />
had ordered the Chronivac and Barry counted on that fact. They had <br />
never been the dumb oafs that they were now but never top of the <br />
class. That was how Barry got them to play with the Chronivac and <br />
Barry's plan would be put into effect.<br />
<br />
Barry had been watching the boy's changes with his own Chronivac <br />
making sure that the effects on one happened to both of the boys. And <br />
his arrival at their front door was no chance encounter.<br />
<br />
Hi Mrs. Williams. Are Glen and Sam here?<br />
<br />
I am sure they are. You are such a sweet boy to be a friend to my <br />
boys. They don't have many friends.<br />
<br />
Well they just need someone to play with they are good loyal friends.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Williams smiled at Barry as he went upstairs.<br />
<br />
So guys wanna go out and play? Barry asked as he went through their <br />
door.<br />
<br />
Yeah Yeah Yeah. They said sounding in stereo.<br />
<br />
Lets go to the fort. Barry suggested.<br />
<br />
Yeah Yeah Yeah.<br />
<br />
The three went bounding out of the house Mrs. Williams calling after <br />
them Don't be late.<br />
<br />
Barry had different plans.<br />
<br />
OK MOM! Glenn and Sam always seemed to be so identical that they <br />
seemed to share one mind.<br />
<br />
When they got to the woods and headed into their fort Barry pulled out <br />
his Chronivac and the one that he had delivered to the boys and said <br />
we are going to play a game.<br />
<br />
Barry punched some buttons on the device and pressed enter. He made <br />
the boys identical twins. Set their age to 28, Made them as furry as a <br />
baboon well at least their arms, legs and chest. Barry didn't like <br />
hairy backs.<br />
<br />
He lowered their IQ a few more points and made them gay. Not nelly <br />
they were very butch but very susceptible to suggestion. Barry set <br />
their height at 5'10&quot; and their weight at 330 pounds. Their <br />
musculature was that they had some muscle but were fairly rounded.<br />
<br />
Barry picked up some of the boys that had picked on him from the day <br />
he entered school and put an idea in their minds to come to the fort.<br />
<br />
As the four of them entered the fort they looked at Barry and had a <br />
few expletives to say about Barry.<br />
<br />
Barry had them put into a state of suspension immediately and the two <br />
big jocks he pulled up their profiles and made them into what he <br />
called peg boys. A chair for each of the twins with a large sized <br />
dildo sticking up from the seat area. The faces of the two at the top <br />
of the dildo. Barry left their faces in tact so that they could see <br />
where they were going and could taste the inside of the twin's <br />
assholes.<br />
<br />
Take a seat Barry said to Glen and Sam. Being the good boys they sat <br />
down feeding the dildo's up their holes. Barry thought he could hear <br />
some screaming from the jocks but that would have been impossible he <br />
had eliminated their vocal cords. The twins wiggled on the dildos even <br />
as they came to the seat making sure that the jocks had a good view of <br />
their insides.<br />
<br />
They other tag alongs he made into usable holes for the twins. They <br />
wold put their mouth on the twin's horse cocks and make them nice and <br />
long and hard and then they would back up and let the dongs fill their <br />
assholes. Over and over. having them cum a dozen times or more in 24 <br />
hours. And fortunately their horse cocks also had horse balls and <br />
could easily dump load after load into the holes. One end or the <br />
other. What was great for Barry was that as the boys orgasimed the <br />
spasm went right through them to their assholes and squeezed the jocks <br />
bodys.<br />
<br />
Barry set this as a routine for the twins and the holes posting that <br />
they had been doing this for the past 10 years since they had gotten <br />
out of high school. He made a change to the fort making it a wonderful <br />
home for the three of them.<br />
<br />
Barry set his age to 33, he wanted to be a bit older than the twins. <br />
He made himself a muscle man. But as smooth as he could be. The only <br />
hair on his body besides his eyebrows was on his crotch. Not a bit on <br />
his body even his head. He was tatooed from his neck to his toes. Some <br />
showing evidence of a prison stint. But he was in charge of his boys. <br />
And his boys went out and earned him a living. <br />
<br />
As Barry sat at home playing with his chronivacs changing the jocks <br />
and the holes into various things. The boys would go out and trick at <br />
the local bars and dance for the bills stuck in their jock straps <br />
bringing the money to Barry.<br />
<br />
Occasionally Barry would change the jocks into people and talk with <br />
them about what he was going to change them into next letting them <br />
talk to him but keeping them immobile.<br />
<br />
Barry enjoyed playing with all his toys.</p>
