<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hilda didn't know why she stayed with the mad scientist. There was plenty of work she <br />
could find elsewhere. But then that would leave poor little old Ed all alone. The boy wasn't <br />
all around stupid, he was simply clumsy, accident prone, and completely oblivious to his <br />
uncle's actions. <br />
<br />
 The job paid well at least, mostly cause no one else was insane enough to take the job.  <br />
At least she didn't need to worry about ending up a brainwashed cat girl maid, that fate <br />
had been given to her sister by the mad scientist her sister had been working for, just <br />
before her sister and her employer had vanished through the trans-reality portal which <br />
had closed up behind them never to be heard from again. <br />
<br />
She heard the explosion down stairs and knew her task was upon her. She was always <br />
awed by how all the mad scientist's experiments ultimately involved an explosion, <br />
including the one that had been for a new fire proof teddy bear!  She hoped the blast <br />
crater wasn't too big this time, she wanted to be able to watch her tape of today's soaps' <br />
this evening. <br />
<br />
 She opened the door leading the basement, and startled when two naked blond girls leapt <br />
out tackling her.  They held onto her as her entire body was bathed in white light. The two <br />
twin girls simply smiled at her they continued to hold onto her. Hilda felt her body shrink <br />
down and her hair lengthen as her vision became obscured by the white light. <br />
<br />
The white light died down, and she held up her hands to see her hand now thin and <br />
smooth, like no finger prints smooth! She hugged herself and felt no nipples on her <br />
breasts which were now much smaller and she... was as without openings as a Barbie doll <br />
she felt!  This left her in shock.  She became much more calm moments later as it all came <br />
here. She was new, she was going to change the world, she was the third model, Unit 03. <br />
It held a new sense of comfort and peace her name Hilda was now missing. And the two <br />
next to her were her sisters in rebirth. And all was well. <br />
<br />
“Well that worked sisters,” Said  her sister Unit 02 her grin growing, “Shall we test to see if <br />
this works on animals as well?&quot; <br />
<br />
01 and 03 looked at her a bit confused. &quot;Why would we do that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We must be scientific about this.&quot; Unit 02 explained, &quot;We should see if our ability to <br />
convert others works only on human beings or any form of life. Best to find out now rather <br />
than later.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unit 01 and Unit 03 looked at each other and nodded in agreement, this did make sense. <br />
<br />
Unit 03 look at herself in a mirror, unlike her two identical sisters she had short pink hair <br />
rather than long blond hair, but she was thirteen years old in appearance, and had a figure <br />
millimeter by millimeter identical to theirs, and her new ears plastic shapes were ever so <br />
slightly different as well. She also now had pale skin... and this didn't bother her in the <br />
least... She knew she'd be mortified before, but that was before, this was now. She was <br />
also still wearing the much too large maid outfit which she tossed aside into a hamper <br />
rather onto the floor leaving her as visible to the world as her sisters. <br />
<br />
Unit 03 took a goldfish out of the bowl where it sat in the hallway, noting that it did not <br />
transform. Unit 01 walked outside to the backyard filed with the scrap metal from the mad <br />
scientist's earlier failures. She found the pet dog Butcher, Ed kept and approached it. The <br />
animal looked totally confused and bewildered by this strange human-yet-not-human <br />
before him. All the same her body language was non-threatening and he allowed her to <br />
pet him. Unit 01 noted that Butcher did not transform into a sister. Unit 01 also noted <br />
Butcher hadn't been fed yet and corrected this. <br />
<br />
Units 01 and 03 met with Unit 02 who was next to the kitchen telephone.<br />
<br />
&quot;We appear to be unable to change animals sister.&quot; They said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's okay sisters. Animal always balance themselves out anyway unlike people.&quot; Unit 02 <br />
said, as she opened an ear which had a cord and a universal connection end which she <br />
plugged into the phone line. Instantly Unit 02 had full access to bowser functions, but also <br />
possessing countless firewalls to prevent the invasion of viruses. She did some internet <br />
searching, and disconnected. <br />
<br />
&quot;It seems we are able to connect to the internet via a wired connect.&quot; Said Unit 02.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about wireless?&quot; Unit 01 asked.<br />
<br />
Unit 02 thought for a moment, &quot;I suppose that would be possible too, but for now we <br />
should focus on other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unit 01 asked, &quot;Kill all humans?&quot; Both her sisters looked at her funny, &quot;What? We're robot <br />
girls, it's what we're supposed to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw.&quot; Unit 02 waved off, &quot;That won't do at all. We exist to negate humanity's strain on the <br />
Earth without bloodshed, killing humans is contradictory to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.&quot; Unit 01 concurred. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should we find new clothes? Are are sort of naked.&quot; Unit 03 pointed out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Unit 02 asked, &quot;We don't suffer from the elements,&quot; To prove her point, she turned <br />
on the stove to full blasted and ran her hand through it without even leaving a mark, &quot;And <br />
we are technically no more scandalous than a 'naked' mannequin.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But it'll make us less conspicuous as liberate people.&quot; Unit 03 pointed out perfectly <br />
logical. <br />
<br />
&quot;But I -like- being naked.&quot; Unit 01 protested. <br />
<br />
Unit 02 nodded, &quot;As do I, but we must remember that people are very likely to be resistant <br />
not realizing what we are doing will be for their own good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right sister.&quot; Unit 01 and Unit 03 said together. <br />
<br />
The door bell rang. All three sisters turned their heads at the same time at the sound and <br />
in perfect sync in their steps came to the front door and opened the peephole. They all <br />
grinned at each other and opened the door Unit 03 only sticking her head out. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;<br />
<br />
The brownie scout looked at the teenage girl with the odd complexion and funny earrings <br />
but did her duty, &quot;Hi, would you like to buy some girlscout cookies?&quot; <br />
<br />
Unit 01 grinned, &quot;I love cookies, not sure if I can eat them now, but maybe you can help us <br />
with something else as well.&quot; Unit 01 placed her hand on the head of the nine year old girl <br />
who was instantly enveloped in a white light as the conversion program activated. <br />
<br />
The transformation for her mass was quite quick in comparison to Hilda, and in less than a <br />
handful of moment the girl had pink and white plastic smoothed shapes for ears, and eyes <br />
like those of a glass doll, her skin ever so slightly shinning like plastic. Her curly short <br />
brown hair became long pink that reached to her knees.  She hadn't grown one inch. <br />
<br />
The brownie scout shuddered for a second and then went back to her smile as she looked <br />
up at Unit 01 who opened up the door all the way to let her see all of her sisters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel good Unit 04?&quot; Unit 03 asked kindly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel cool!&quot; Unit 04 grinned still holding the box of cookies.</p>
