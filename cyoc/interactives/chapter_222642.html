<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie wondered just how old she would have to be to not need a babysitter. &quot;What if I were ten, That&#39;d be old enough to be able to take care of myself while mom&#39;s at work. Though knowing her, She wouldn&#39;t feel all that safe til I was twelve or even thirteen...&quot;<br />
<br />
As Katie spoke, her legs swung back and forth on the chair as they drifted further and further to the floor. Her face then looked less rounded as the freckles slowly faded bit by bit. Her hair grew a tad long and was nearing her shoulder blades. Her clothes then started to tighten from her growing body as more force was being applied against the fabrics. Her thoughts kept her unaware of the flats of her feet touching the floor<br />
<br />
&quot;But why stop there?&quot; she pondered out loud, failing to notice her feet as they firmly planted on the floor. &quot;I hear the real fun starts at sixteen.&quot; Katie’s chest started to feel numb as her nipples started to poke out of her shirt. The fat around the nipples started to explain and grew, turning from small mounds to pointy cone, marking the beginning of her breasts. Fatty deposits started to form on her hips as they slowly expand a bit, beginning to form curves. Her rear started to expand a little as well to accommodate her early curves. Her arms and legs grew a little longer, but muscle growth started to form on her lanky frame. She began to count the ways it&#39;d be sweet at sixteen on a hand that was growing big and dainty. &quot;Cheerleading, Driving, Swimsuits,&quot; One by one, she extended her longer thinner fingers. But one word escaped her voice as it abrubtly dropped lower. &quot;Sex.&quot; Almost immediately, she could feel something strange in her groined and moaned in both surprise and pleasure. Turns out, her expanded knowledge made her realize that she’s going through her period and is one step closer to womanhood. Her face started to mature a little bit as her face started to change shape and matured more and her freckles faded more. Her nose was starting to get longer and thinner as she was loosing her precious button nose. Her tongue quickly felt something strange appear on her teeth, something metallic. Opening her mouth, she could see what looked like braces. Katie scratched her head and wondered how they got there. That’s when her mental changes kicked into high gear as her mind progressed into high school. Along that were growing memories as she remembered she obtained these braces when she was thirteen. She figured that since her teeth were a little messed up, she needed brace to straighten her teeth. Her hair has reached her shoulder and was lightened in color from dark brown to medium brown. <br />
<br />
Katie looked at her face in the mirror and found it coated in zits, her mind telling her that she was nearly fourteen when her body had entered another growth spurt, going into another four to five inches and she was over five feet. At the same time, her body expanded in all places and it felt enjoyable for her. Her breasts started to expand, going from cones and A cups, all the way to perky B cups. Her hips widen a bit more and the curves escalate, forming a teen like hourglass. Her read expanded a bit more and looked like a bubble. Her arms and legs gained more muscles while growing and were toning up more and more. It was obvious that Katie like to go outside and play when she was young. But now that she’s growing older, all those years of playing really gave her an athletic ability. Even knowledge of high school seep into her brain, including athletics accomplishments including soccer, track and field, and some karate. Katie didn’t mind as she felt her active body feeling shapely and flexible. Her face kept looking older as there are little hints of childhood left behind. Her face was thinner and less rounded while her nose was longer and looking elegant. Her lips started to gain fat and began to puff up. There were a little freckles left on her face, but she frowned at the pimples that dotted her face. She could tell that she was getting into her awkward teen phase. But she knew that will be all over, as she will grow out of that phase. Her hair grew longer as they passed her shoulders and started to shine through the light. &quot;Honestly, I could skip a few more years to get rid of these zits...&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie could feel her height increased as she was now close to the six-foot mark as her body shifted into that of a young adult. Her breasts increased in size and turned into a perfect pair of C cup melons that tore at her shirt. She cupped on with her now dainty hands and was amazed at how soft, yet heavy they were. Her hips grew more and her curves were shapely while her rear blown up further to complete her sultry hourglass look. The muscles on her arms and legs pushed further and further until the pants gave way. She could even see a bit of abs on her toned stomach. Her face had already adult with little childish features remain. Her skull structure was completely oval as all the pimples and freckles vanished completely leaving nothing but smooth and flawless skin. Her nose was long and thin as her eyes were less cute and innocent and more sultry and mature. Her lips were puffy and devious as she felt her braces disappeared, opening her mouth to reveal her perfectly align pearly white teeth. Her hair grew longer as it went down past her shoulders and looked completely fuller. &quot;Enough to drink my troubles away...&quot;<br />
<br />
She continued to grow older as what’s left of her height grew over six feet, going through her last growth spurt. Her body started to fill up nicely as she looked like a full-grown woman. Her breasts grew through CCs and just barely reach the D-cup mark as she shook them to see how full and bouncy they were. Her hips grew wider and her ass expanded outward, making her hourglass very curvy and shapely. Her muscle tone was firm and strong as her skin darkened a little more to show off her tan. Her face had no child like qualities left as she was starring at an adult woman’s face with an oval structure, thin and long nose, small to sultry eyes, and kissable lips. Her hair grew a little longer and was down her upper back. &quot;Damn, guess time flies when you&#39;re in your own mind...&quot;</p>
