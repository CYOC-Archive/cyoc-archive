<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Sorry, if I'm droning on...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick looked at the shiny black gob of goo that come out of Chad&#39;s cock on his gloved finger.  He sniffed.  It smelled weirdly of rubber and sex.  He looked at it again.  And said, &quot;I wonder if it tastes like rubber or licorice?&quot;<br />
<br />
He stuck the finger into his mouth, and sucked it off his finger.  Or he attempted to suck it off.  He tried to pull his finger out of his mouth, but it was stuck fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmft!&quot; shouted Rick through his sealed mouth.   He dropped the banana formerly known as Rico.  He fumbled with the phone trying to use the app without being able to speak, or use his right hand. He didn&#39;t notice Chad moving without instruction.  He stooped down to pick up his master Rico.  A thick cream colored goo resembling tapioca sprayed out of Chad&#39;s cock covering the banana in his hands.  The tapioca goo filled his hands obscuring the banana.  It began to grow warmer and warmer. And actually started to glow.  <br />
<br />
Rick tried to pry his lips apart with his left hand, but only succeeded in getting it stuck to his mouth too.  The black goo seemed to be growing and oozing out of his mouth, and covering his chin and hands.  He tripped and fell to the ground.  The black goo clogged his nose and covered his eyes.  <br />
<br />
The tapioca pile glowed and grew bigger and bigger.<br />
<br />
Rico coughed violently, and exploded out of the huge pudding mass.  He was naked except for a banana yellow pouch wrapped around his manhood. He coughed and sputtered and looked around in confusion.  He had been a banana, and now he was himself again.  No wait that wasn&#39;t true.  He seemed different.  He looked down at his body, it was more muscular than it had been.  His shoulders and chest were broader, his abs were six packs, his thighs and calves were bigger. He looked at Chad and his surroundings, he seemed taller too.  His skin seemed to glow. He was a more idealized version of his former self.  Rico looked at his bulging pouch, he was tempted to remove it to see if his cock and balls were bigger too, but he already knew the answer from looking at the flimsy yellow bit of rubber.<br />
<br />
Chad bowed to its master.  Then he strode over to Rick, and ripped off his clothing.  His cock no sprayed more black rubber on Rick&#39;s now naked body, as he struggled and made unintelligible moans.  Soon a black cocooned thing lay at there no longer moving.  Chad carried the black chrysalis over to Rico who was frowning at his now size 12 feet.  He would need a whole new wardrobe, and shoes were so expensive.  He set the cocoon in Rico&#39;s arms.  The black goo melted and reformed as another shiny black drone.  He looked from Chad to Rick, but he could see no difference. He had two Chad drones worshiping him.  He frowned.<br />
<br />
Rick was furious as he struggled to escape the black rubber. This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen.  Chad was supposed to be his, not he Chad&#39;s.  He struggled as the goo and Chad&#39;s thoughts enveloped him.  Rico was master.  Rico was fucking banana!  No, Rico was the top banana!  He struggled with his thoughts.  Only as the black goo cocooned him did he realize his mind and body were being overwritten.  He was becoming a Chad clone, he was becoming a black rubber Chad Drone.  He tried to fight it, but his memories faded.  He kept repeating his own name but it was no good.  Rick was gone, he was Chad, he was owned by Rico.  Rick shed one black rubber tear, as his last memories faded from existence.  It was a Chad Drone now, and the master needed more to serve and worship him...</p>
