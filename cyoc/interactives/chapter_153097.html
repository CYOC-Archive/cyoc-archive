<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Less then 30 minutes late, Duncan, Kaiden and Wade found themselves in the basement of the Beta house. Sitting on boxes set up around an old mattress, Jace and Ryan sat solemnly while Paul explained why they were meeting in the basement.<br />
While the basement wasn’t normally used for anything, it had been made completely soundproof by a previous Beta brother, who had used the space band for his rock band to practice in. That combined with the special black tinted glass meant that no one outside the basement would know what was going on unless they ventured down into it themselves.<br />
<br />
The six men were pretty shaken, although Paul was making a clear effort to maintain a clear head, asking each person to summarize the events of the night, so everyone was on the same page, from the Alphas firebombing Jace’s car, to the revelations that the Alphas locked their pledges in with recordings of them raping different women, to the misfired gunshots that had shut the party down and prompted the polices swift arrival<br />
.<br />
The entire time, Kaiden’s backpack, stuffed full with the clothes and dicked forms of the four alpha frat brothers, lay on the mattress between everyone. No one seemed ready to make the first move.<br />
<br />
Kaiden had revised the notes he made on his phone from the spell book, his free hand rubbing his forehead every couple of minutes as the days event’s started to catch up with him. His body demanding rest.<br />
<br />
“Hey man, you need and aspirin or something?” Wade asked, breaking one of the long silences in the room.<br />
<br />
Kaiden looked up at Wade, before looking back at his own hand and then shaking his head. He realized what was happening. The headache from maintaining the four men in their phallic forms as their minds resisted.<br />
<br />
“No thanks, it won’t help.” Kaiden smiled weakly at Wade as he moved forward, unzipping his backpack and laying out everything within on the mattress.<br />
<br />
Four full sets of clothes, including socks, shoes, wallets, smart phones, two pairs of car keys, a box of condoms and a small bottle of lubricant, then finally the four dicks themselves.<br />
Kaiden picked each one up with two hands, closing his eyes as he felt their minds, identifying each cock and then laying it next to it wallet.<br />
<br />
“How can you tell which is which?” Duncan asked.<br />
“Since I’m the one who transformed them, I can feel their minds and hear their thoughts. Although I’m blocking them out right now because it’s like all four of them screaming right in my ear.” Kaiden replied, rubbing his brow again.<br />
<br />
Kaiden stared at the four flaccid cocks displayed on the bed for a long moment before sighing, picking up Tyler’s flaccid form. Looking at Duncan and Wade he smiled weakly, before speaking.<br />
“I hope you guys aren’t grossed out by this, but the headache’s going to keep getting worse until they turn back unless I do this.” <br />
<br />
Without waiting for a response, Kaiden started to massage the balls that rested nicely in his palm, a light dusting of dark hair tickling in his palm. His other hand was tickling and stroking along the length of Tyler’s shaft. The flaccid dick slowly lengthening, the skin slowly becoming tight as Tyler stretched to his full 7 1/2” length. Kaiden wrapped his thumb and index finger around the shaft just below the head, his fingers just managing to touch as he began long, slow strokes right down to the base and then back just before the head.<br />
<br />
Bringing the pulsing shaft to his lips, Kaiden let the flared head slip inside his lips as his tongue lapped and swirled around the head. Vaguely hearing an appreciative curse from Duncan as he found he could no longer silence Tyler’s inner voice.<br />
<br />
“What’s happening!?! I can’t be a dick. Why am I getting so hard by being stroked by a guy. Fuck! My whole body is quivering but I’m also so fucking rock hard. Oh Geez! That tongue feels incredible. So much better then getting head when I’m, I’m. Normal? I guess.”<br />
<br />
Kaiden smiled internally. The last hour of his pleas being ignored had weakened Tyler’s pleas and instead his own mind was flailing about, trying to comprehend the sheer insanity of being reduced to his own cock meat.  Strangely, hearing Tyler’s gradual surrender to the pleasure of the full body blow job he was getting got Kaiden extremely turned on. His own mouth drooling copiously as he picked up speed, vigorously sliding Tyler as deep into his throat as he could, his mouth and tongue working overdrive as the frat brat’s inner thoughts devolved into formless groaning.<br />
<br />
Kaiden received a split second warning, the single word rising from within Tyler’s mind just before his cock body tensed.<br />
“CUM!”<br />
Sliding Tyler back down his throat, Kaiden felt Tyler spasming and pulsing, his mouth filling with hot cum which he struggled to swallow. His body desperate for thick seed being pumped into him. Yet he couldn’t pull out. His arm didn’t seem to obey his mind as he rode out the last few long spams. The remaining spurts of cum sliding down his throat as his lungs started to burn from a lack of air.<br />
<br />
Finally pulling Tyler out of his mouth, Kaiden gasped for air, a goofy smile on his face as he dropped to his knees, panting heavily as he carelessly dropped the spit covered Tyler onto his own shirt on the bed.<br />
<br />
Finally catching his breath, Kaiden stood up, his headache almost completely gone as Tyler had deflated back to his flaccid form. Yet the room felt heavy with sexual tension, an almost electrical buzzing that had urged the remaining three body less cocks to semi hardness despite the lack of any direct stimulation, Heavy breathing the only noise within the room.<br />
<br />
Jace was the first to break the silence“That was fucking hot mate!” Kaiden looked around, seeing the horny look in everyone’s eyes. At least he knew now that everyone in the room was into dick.<br />
Kaiden even noted that Paul had one hand inside his now tight track pants, and the other hand down the back of Ryan’s shorts, causing his boyfriend to squirm slightly.<br />
<br />
“You haven’t had a chance to experiment with your new cock yet have you?”<br />
<br />
Paul shook his head. “The three of us have been preparing the basement and drinking together while we waited for your return. But I’m definitely keen to try it out as soon as possible.” A tight squeeze on Ryan’s ass made him gasp as he grinned up at his man.<br />
<br />
“Which one is Tyler?” Jace interrupted, stepping forward. Picking Tyler’s spent form up as soon as Kaiden pointed it out.<br />
“Ryan drop your pants and say g’day to your new dick.”<br />
Ryan’s eyes went wide looking back and forth between Jace and Paul, yet before he could make a decision, Paul was pulling Ryan’s shorts down, while Jace held Tyler’s flaccid form in place against Ryan’s own rock hard cocklet.<br />
<br />
The much larger meat fused into place after a long moment, the fleshes colour adjusting to Ryan’s slightly paler skin tone, and slowly filling out again, as Ryan’s unspent lust flooded Tyler cock body.<br />
The room was quiet again as silently everyone watched Tyler fill out to his full 7 & 1/2 inches, pointing straight out from Ryan’s body. <br />
<br />
“How many times?” Jace broke the silence again, his somber tone cutting through the tension in the room. <br />
<br />
Kaiden blinked a couple of times,before realizing what Jace had meant, turning back to Paul and Ryan. <br />
“Anywhere from 7 to 15 more times, since he’s only cum once since he’s been transformed.  You’ll need to make him cum frequently until the countdown is done to be sure. Do NOT give him a full day to recharge!” Kaiden half explained to Ryan and Paul as Jace pulled Ryan’s pant’s up and led them to the stairs. <br />
“Hop to it mates. Go have some fun, but keep count, I expect updates every day until its done.”<br />
<br />
“Wait a minute, until whats done?” Wade asked as Jace shut the door behind Ryan and Paul.<br />
<br />
“Now they are dicks, but they won’t stay dicks until we make em’ act like dicks enough times. Mainly make em blow their loads. Kade’s here knows the details.” Jace replied nonchalantly as he circled the mattress, scrutinizing each of the semi hard dicks on the mattress.<br />
<br />
“So its not permanent until they are ‘broken in’?” Wade asked using air quotes.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, so lets get started. Which one do you want to be your new dick Kade’s?”<br />
 <br />
“Now hold up a minute. What if I want a bigger dick?” Wade interrupted.<br />
<br />
“You mean you don’t already meet the Alpha requirement?” Jace almost spat back as he stared Wade down, his gaze causing the slightly taller man to take half a step back, bumping into the wall.<br />
<br />
“Well I know I don’t, but that’s never stopped me from tapping a tight ass before” Duncan replied as he gently slapped Kaiden’s butt, giving him a cheeky wink.<br />
<br />
“Guys, calm down. I’m not really a top so I don’t need to take one of these ones.” <br />
<br />
“Kaiden…” Jace placed his hand on Kai den&#39;s shoulder. “None of this would be possible without you. You should enjoy the fruits of your labor.”<br />
<br />
“I-I.” Kaiden stammered looking down at the three engorged cocks on the mattress, his mind going over what he wanted to do with them.<br />
<br />
“I will. If you help me.” He finally replied, looking each man in the eyes.<br />
“Each of you pick a cock.”<br />
Wade quickly picking up one he had been eyeing since it came out of the backpack.<br />
Just over 9 inches, large low hanging balls, three large veins bulging around a shaft that thickened heavily near the middle, before narrowing slightly before the slightly pointed dark purple cock head, just peeking out of a thick foreskin.<br />
<br />
Jace and Duncan both took their time, each picking up and examining the remaining dicks in detail, before placing them back on the bed.<br />
<br />
“Which one is this?” Duncan asked as he picked up the other uncut cock. Just under 10 inches, equally thick and straight, a large bulbous cock head and a foreskin that seemed to move a little easier then the cock that Wade chose, although the balls were a little smaller and a lot hairier. <br />
<br />
“It doesn’t matter.” Jace cut in, picking up the remaining circumcised dick and shoving it into place, having made his choice.<br />
<br />
Kaiden watched as the 8 &1/3 inch cock merged into Jace’s almost bare groin, the thick shaft curving slightly upwards, topped with a mushroom head with a wide flare, but most impressive were the large balls, each the size of a hens egg hanging below. <br />
<br />
“Damn!” Kaiden turned his head to Duncan who has fondling the furry balls of his newly attached cock. “I’m gonna have to shave these things pronto. I like my twig and berries on a smooth plain.”<br />
<br />
His comments caused Wade to burst into laughter. “Nothing fazes you ya pommy bastard!” Trying his best to impersonate Duncan’s accent but deviating into Northern Irish accent instead.<br />
<br />
The room was full of quiet chuckling until a loud smacking noise drew their attention to Jace, who was roughly slapping his hard dick side to side, drawing thick dollops of pre to go flying off to the left and right as his cock swung and bobbed angrily.<br />
<br />
“Derrick here is a feisty one.”<br />
<br />
“Well not for long.” Duncan replied as he started stuffing the dicked guys property back into Kaiden’s backpack.<br />
“I’m gonna get rid of all this in the morning, but Kaiden. I’m sorry mate I’m gonna need to destroy your backpack as well. Can’t have any DNA evidence linking you to them, and its YOUR backpack, so its bound to have SOMETHING like some hair or skin in it.”<br />
Kaiden nodded before jumping slightly, turning to see Jace sliding his lubed up fingers between his ample mounds.<br />
Drawing Kaiden into a deep, wet, kiss. Jace ushered Wade and Duncan over, the three men helping strip Kaiden of his clothes before guiding him onto the mattress.<br />
<br />
“Lets have some fun boys.” Jace said with that same hungry look in his eyes that made Kaiden’s ass twitch in anticipation. His own mouth drooling at the three large leaky dicks swaying right in front of his face.</p>
