<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan decided to tell Dianne the truth. After all, she was obviously one of those rare individuals.<br />
<br />
&quot;I waitin&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
Megan sighs and says &quot;Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I used a program to change you. I was afraid that Fred would start hitting you so I changed your gender. When that didn't work I changed your age. I'm sorry about this. I didn't know Fred could get that mad. So how come you're here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You inbited me ober&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't remember inviting you over&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You did wast week&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I wouldn't remember it&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha are you gonna do now?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I'm going to keep you as my daughter&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it will be safer for you and I want three girls&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don hab any udder kids&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will in nine months&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You pwegnant?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I am&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How you know?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I used the program to make a couple of people young enough to be in my womb&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did dey wan dat?&quot; Dianne asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Kathy had wanted me to know what it was like to be a mother&quot; Megan said. &quot;She changed herself into a baby and I took it a bit farther. As to Tiffany, I made her a little girl at first. After she tried to use the program I punished her by returning her to my womb. Now she's in there with her sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat not wight&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have the program and I say it's right&quot; Megan said. &quot;If you try to reverse what I've done I'll return you to my womb with your sisters. Now I don't know if you've had breakfast yet so why don't you tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I habn't had bweakfast yet&quot; Dianne said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then we'll get you some&quot; Megan said closing the program and shutting down the laptop. &quot;Now come into the dining room so you can eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Megan led Dianne to the dining room and set her on a chair. &quot;Now don't move, I'll be right back with your breakfast&quot; Megan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay Mommy&quot; Dianne said. She knew that she had to get to the laptop and reverse what Megan had done. She didn't mind being a little girl but at least Tiffany hadn't asked to be regressed to the womb. Of course she hadn't asked to be transformed into a little girl either but she was willing to stay this way. Right now though her little tummy was growling and she wanted food.<br />
<br />
It wasn't long before Megan came back into the dining room with a bowl of oatmeal which she sat in front of Dianne. &quot;There you go sweetie&quot; she said. &quot;I'm sorry about it being oatmeal but we don't have any cereal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dat otay, I wike oatmeal&quot; Dianne said and started eating.<br />
<br />
Megan just sat and watched Dianne eat. 'She must think that I'll try to get to the laptop if she doesn't watch me closely' Dianne thought. 'Well she's right about that.'<br />
<br />
After Dianne finished eating Megan said &quot;Alright sweetie, go to your room and play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Otay Mommy&quot; Dianne said. She slid off the chair and went to her room.<br />
<br />
Dianne had been playing with her dolls for about a half hour when she heard the shower turn on. 'Now's my chance to bring back Kathy and Tiffany' she thought. 'Mommy should be in the shower for a half hour. That leaves me plenty of time to use the program.'<br />
<br />
Dianne waited a few minutes before she quietly snuck back downstairs. She found the laptop where Megan had left it. She booted it up and then ran the program. When the program was running she saw to her horror that Megan was right behind her. Before she could do anything Megan yanked her out of the chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you not to try reversing what I've done&quot; Megan said. &quot;Now I have to punish you. And in case you're thinking about waiting until you're old enough to use the laptop to reverse things, you can forget about it. Once you're in my womb I'm going to create a password for it. You won't be able to get to the program again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don bet on it&quot; Dianne said with an angry look on her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't use that tone with me young lady&quot; Megan said. &quot;You're getting a spanking before I regress you to my womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan dragged Dianne over to the couch and sat down. She bent her over her knee, pulled up her dress, and pulled down her panties. She then proceeded to spank her.<br />
<br />
With each whack Dianne cried out and pleaded for Megan to stop. It wasn't until her butt was so sore that she wouldn't be able to sit down and tears were streaming down her cheeks that Megan stopped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now stand right here and don't move from this spot&quot; Megan said as she stood Dianne up. She then went over to the laptop to regress Dianne back to her womb.<br />
<br />
Dianne just stood there with her hands on her butt. It was really sore and she doubted that she could move very fast. She knew what was coming and knew that there was nothing she could do to prevent it.<br />
<br />
Megan looked at Dianne and said &quot;I promise to be a good mother to you and your sisters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dianne felt a tingle go through her body and she started to shrink. Her vision blurred and then went dark. She felt fluid around her and in her lungs. She decided to kick before she was too small for it to be felt. Before her consciousness dimmed she thought 'I need to be good or else I may not be born.' Just as she lost consciousness she<br />
sensed her sisters.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Megan watched as Dianne shrank and then vanished. Her stomach suddenly ballooned out to nine months when Dianne vanished. Suddenly she felt a kick from inside her womb. &quot;That didn't happen with either Kathy or Tiffany&quot; she said as she rubbed her rapidly deflating stomach. &quot;Diane must have been a little bit upset.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan closed the program and set the password for the laptop. &quot;There, now I'm the only one that will be able to use the program&quot; she said. &quot;I just need to remember to turn it off when I'm done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan suddenly remembered that she had left the shower running. So after she turned the laptop off she decided that she should take a shower.<br />
<br />
On her way she rubbed her belly with a smile on her face and said &quot;Thanks Kathy. You and your sisters will have the best life we can give you. Maybe I'll have more kids. Would you girls like to have brothers? I bet you would. I may even make Maxine a boy again and have him be your brother. You girls do need at least one brother though giving birth to three kids at once is enough for now. Once you're older I'll get you girls a brother or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stripped out of her clothes and stepped into the shower with a smile on her face still.</p>
