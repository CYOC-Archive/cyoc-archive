<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave woke up feeling better than he had in a long time. Hell, a few days ago if he had done half the things they did last night he&#39;d have woken up with more stiff muscles and sore joints than he could count. He felt a little worked over, but he felt good. The warmth of Aaron&#39;s back pressed up against his chest, his own arm protectively around the younger man. He could feel his hard cock laying between Aaron&#39;s cheeks.<br />
<br />
How many times had he cum last night, he couldn&#39;t remember, but that last one with him on his back, Aaron straddling his hips as he rode Dave&#39;s cock. Aaron&#39;s cock bobbing in front of him, slick pre drooling from the tip onto his abs. His cock stiffened further at the memory. Memory. It told him Aaron was his roommate, having only moved in a few months ago when college started. Nothing they did last night was wrong. But under that he could still remember being father and son, but it felt like the emotion was missing there, more like a book remembered than memories lived. Still, he felt a twinge of shame rising in him and he slipped out of the bed.<br />
<br />
Regardless, he had to get ready for work. He went into the bathroom and splashed some water in his face to help wake him up. Looking into the mirror as he toweled dry. He really did need to shave. It had been three days and the way his beard grew it really was more of a short beard now than a bit of stubble.  Aaron had said he liked it last night.. maybe if he just trimmed it.<br />
<br />
He gave a start as he saw his own eyes though, once a deep dark brown they seemed paler, a little bit of green around the edges. That wasn&#39;t the only thing different with his face either. Some things were the same, his heavy stubble, his thick, dark eye brows. His nose, once broken and a bit beak like was straighter, and his jaw seemed a little more pronounced, and was that a cleft in his chin? He hadn&#39;t been bad looking before, but he had always relied on his physique to attract others. Not to mention he looked like he was in his late twenties now. How young was he going to get? The look though, it was an improvement, but something seemed oddly familiar about the features, and not just from those new memories creeping in.  He shoved the puzzle away for now, he had to get ready for work. No one else seemed to notice anything off, so he had to just continue.<br />
<br />
He took a shower where he happily noted that the rest of his gut had disappeared, leaving behind a set of abs he hadn&#39;t had since his early thirties. As well as a little bit less body hair that wouldn&#39;t be noticeable to anyone but him. He was still a furry bastard, it was just a little more contained. That would need a trim in a day or two. He always kept it on the shorter side. His cock, well that was longer, too, almost seven inches he guessed, but incredibly thick. Toweling off, he quietly got dressed so as not to disturb the still sleeping Aaron. Though he did take a moment to look at him stretched out in the bed, sheets barely covering him. No one else noticed the changes, but two of them were definitely changing. Other than being blond haired and blue eyed, Aaron looked like a different man. Well, mostly, he still had his mother&#39;s more delicate features though slightly more masculinized than they were before. But Dave could trace the lines of Aaron&#39;s muscles with his eyes, that lean swimmers build looked so good on him. He also noticed with maybe just a twinge of jealousy that Aaron&#39;s cock might actually be longer than his, if not nearly as girthy.<br />
<br />
He mentally kicked himself. No matter what was going on, he couldn&#39;t stop thinking of Aaron as a sexual partner. He was his son, but.. he had to keep telling himself that. It was so easy to forget. He grabbed a quick breakfast and headed to the gym, still trying to work things out in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dave! My man!&quot; Chris&#39; exuberant voice greeted him as he walked through the parking lot to the gym. Soon the younger man was next to him, one thick arm thrown over his shoulder like they were the closest of friends. Something told Dave they were. He had barely spoken more than two words to Chris before this weekend that weren&#39;t work related, but now he knew Chris was one of his closest friends. He gave him a light nudge in the ribs with his elbow.<br />
<br />
Chris looked Dave up and down and grinned. &quot;You got laid last night. Hah! Knew you&#39;d give in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Dave shot Chris a skeptical look. &quot;I..&quot; He couldn&#39;t bring up the lie.<br />
<br />
&quot;You strut a little the next morning. Always have.&quot; Chris sounded sure, with the knowledge of long years. &quot;The David Sinclair strut, it&#39;s obvious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave was too shocked as they entered the building to respond. Sinclair? He was David Meyers.. Sinclair was &quot;Owen&#39;s up in his office, he wants to talk to you.&quot; Came a familiar voice from behind the desk. Drew was manning it this morning and looking right at Dave, though he didn&#39;t look worried.<br />
<br />
Chris just gave him a pat on the back and peeled off towards the locker rooms. &quot;Tell the old man I said hey.&quot;<br />
<br />
David headed towards the office that belonged to Owen but also had his own desk used often enough when doing his own duties as the manager and head trainer. The place was neat, Owen insisted on it. The man himself sat behind his desk. Owen and Dave had been friends since college where they both met in the weight room. The other man had always been the more motivated one and always seemed to just pull Dave along in his wake. He had even aged better than Dave. Owen was still as muscular and fit as he was back then, and his &#39;gut&#39; if it could be called that was more muscle than fat. He had always been a good looking man, too. Lantern jawed, cleft chinned, with bright green eyes. Other than the color of his eyes a few had jokingly said he should play Superman with his looks.<br />
<br />
Dave stared. That&#39;s why those features in the mirror looked familiar. He looked like a younger Owen, just scruffier. Owen must have taken Dave&#39;s staring for something else, because he let out a deep laugh. &quot;Don&#39;t look so scared. I just wanted to thank you for taking over Marcus&#39; shifts this weekend. I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re dedicated to this place, let&#39;s me know it&#39;ll be in good hands when I retire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, no problem. Glad to help out.&quot; Dave dropped in the chair across the desk, trying to gather his thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Chuck&#39;s back in town and I got him to take your shift tomorrow. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re dedicated but you need to take time off. You&#39;re young, yet. You shouldn&#39;t be working your life away. Remember my rule.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave could remember it. No matter how busy the gym got or his bodybuilding competitions he always made time for himself and his family. And once Dave showed an interest in body building himself, Owen had ben there for him every step of the way, and when he met his friend Chris who he got into body building as well, Owen took him in, too like a second son. The man always made time for the people in his life.<br />
<br />
Dave just nodded, and Owen went on. &quot;You need a life outside of here, and I hope someone to share it with one day. Anyway. I&#39;m proud of you. Keep on and I&#39;ll probably give you more responsibilities soon.&quot; <br />
<br />
He was the manager, how many more responsibilities could he have. He looked over to the second desk and realized his stuff was missing, but someone else&#39;s was there. Chuck&#39;s. Dave wasn&#39;t the manager here anymore, he was just one of the trainers like Chris. Owen had wanted him to work his way up like anyone else so he couldn&#39;t be accused of favoritism, even if Dave would probably run the place one day. He felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. &quot;I just wanted to let you know. Now go get ready, I know you have a client soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave was still stunned as he got out of the chair and made his way to the locker rooms. He wasn&#39;t sure how many more major life changes he could take.<br />
<br />
---------------<br />
<br />
Aaron woke with a languorous stretch. He was disappointed he was alone in the bed, but he guessed Dave must have headed off to work. Dave. Had they really done what he thought they did? The lingering soreness from riding that thick pole was enough confirmation for that. He should feel weird about it, but he didn&#39;t. The memories of a different father, one that still lived across town were stronger in his mind than his old ones.<br />
<br />
Even the room he lay in was different. The old furniture his dad had had since before Aaron was even born was gone. Instead it was newer pieces, and quite a bit less expensive. Pictures on the wall had changed, and other items laying about. It was a young man&#39;s room. Aaron slipped out of bed and walking into the apartment proper, the unfamiliar length of his cock flopping between his thighs. It must have been seven inches soft, when had it gotten so long. Other things were different out here, too. It just felt more like a bachelor pad than a family home.  He poured himself a bowl of cereal and leaned against the counter eating.  It didn&#39;t even seem to cross his mind or bother him that he was completely naked. He, the new he, liked avoiding clothes when he could.<br />
<br />
He also felt an itch to go out on a morning run, not that he had ever done it before, except his memories told him he did most days once he no longer had swim practice. It was something him and Jake did. He reached over for where he had left his phone charging on the counter and saw a few missed messages from Jake, including one about a morning run. He sent back a &#39;Meet you at the usual spot in 20.&#39;.<br />
<br />
It was a quick change into his running shorts and a pair of sneakers. It was a nice day out so he decided to forgo a shirt, something the old him would never have done. The old him was also scrawny and hairless. The few blond hairs that had been on his chest yesterday evening was now a small patch between his pecs, another line of curly blond hair poked over the waistband of his shorts and up to his navel, and a bit of scruff on his jaw. Hell, the hair under his arms were curly bushes glimpsed when he added some deodorant before heading out.<br />
<br />
It was a light jog to the edge of campus where Jake was waiting for him. He lived in the dorms, so got there quickly. Aaron knew in his memories he could have had a closer place himself, be the moment he saw Dave he knew he&#39;d choose that apartment. It was odd how comfortable those memories were now. Jake was familiar in both of those sets of memories though. He was fit, still a little more so than even Aaron was right now, his brown hair buzzed short and sporting the beginning efforts of a goatee. He wore a tank, but the low neck revealed a smooth muscular chest. He never got out of the swimmer&#39;s habit of keeping himself shaved down.<br />
<br />
Jake fell in next to Aaron and they started their run through the campus. Both quiet at the start until Jake finally spoke up. &quot;You okay, you&#39;re running a bit stiff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron looked over to Jake, he could feel himself blushing as he looked away. &quot;Just a bit sore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;From what? Dave finally convince you to try one of his workouts?&quot; Jake was teasing, but Aaron smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.. it was a workout, but not that type.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake laughed and nudged Aaron with his elbow. &quot;Seriously? You finally did it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah and he&#39;s...&quot; Aaron held up his hand like he was holding a beer bottle. &quot;Thick. So, I&#39;m a little sore.&quot; Jake whistled and shook his head, falling back into silence for a while as they both focused on running.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you guys a thing now?&quot; Jake finally asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. dunno.&quot;  Aaron frowned, trying to think it over. Was it something spur of the moment, or was it what he had picked for their change. The relationship package manifesting itself. &quot;I guess we&#39;ll need to talk tonight. He had left for work by the time I woke up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should invite him to game night.&quot; Jake grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to date him, not scare him off with my nerdy friends.&quot; Aaron said with mock teasing, and Jake feigned hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought you said he was into sci-fi and fantasy stuff. I mean, if you two are going to be a thing he needs to get to know your friends. And maybe he&#39;ll bring that Chris along.&quot; Jake sounded hopeful. &quot;Are you sure Chris is straight?&quot;<br />
<br />
It took focusing on the new memories to realized Dave was into more of the things Aaron was. It would help, they had never been close before because they didn&#39;t share interests. Now that Aaron seemed a little into fitness, it was only fair there was new hobbies for Dave, too. Chris he could also remember now. Dave&#39;s best friend and coworker. Another huge bodybuilder, not as scruffy and furry as Dave though. Cute. &quot;As far as I know he is.&quot; Though the mental image of Chris and Jake together was one that got his cock twitching. Maybe he could tweak a few things once the program was done with him and Dave. Sweat soaked his chest and darkened a bit more chest hair than had even been there thirty minutes ago, the trail up his stomach almost to his chest. Dave must like a little fur too.</p>
