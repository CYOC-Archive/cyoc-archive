<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leaving the two porkers where they are, you recollect your clothes and return to the food stand. The stand <br />
operator shares a knowing glance. Before you can order a voice comes from behind you.<br />
<br />
“Steak and eggs. From someone recent.”<br />
<br />
A woman walks up beside you, slightly taller than yourself. Her evening dress is creased from a long night of <br />
action, her long hair only slightly out of place. From the confidence she carries herself with you figure she <br />
has to be one of the employees. She turns to look at you with a smile.<br />
<br />
“I’d avoid the sausage myself. It’s kind of old. We haven’t gotten any new hogs for months.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, I think I might have solved that problem.” On cue the two pigs waddle back onto the main thoroughfare. <br />
The woman catches sight of them, then looks back at you with a surprised expression and renewed interest.<br />
<br />
“You’re not just a normal new hire, are you?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know. Aren’t I?”<br />
<br />
After collecting her breakfast the two of you find a seat next to a fenced off lake. In the lake’s center is a <br />
small island, and you can just make out three figures staggering around on its beach.<br />
<br />
“So it doesn’t bother you at all that that used to be a person?”<br />
<br />
“If it used to be, then it isn’t anymore, so why should it bother me?” She cuts off a few slices of juicy <br />
meat, then pauses with one mouthful halfway to her mouth. “Oh, I suppose you haven’t heard my name yet if <br />
you’re <br />
so new. I’m Cathy. And you?”<br />
<br />
You have a name, of course. But that was the name of a person who hadn’t arrived on the island yet. Someone <br />
who you are pretty sure you no longer are. It wouldn’t really take to still carry his name around.<br />
<br />
“At the moment I don’t think I have a name.”<br />
<br />
“Everyone has a name darling, and most of them aren’t suitable at all. How about we call you Annie then. Short <br />
for Anonymous.”<br />
<br />
“OK, I can live with that.” You lean back on the bench, watching the men on the island. One of them sets out <br />
to try and swim to shore. Halfway across the lake he disappears below the waves and does not resurface. “So, <br />
you said that like I ought to know your name. You a celebrity around here?”<br />
<br />
“By vocation, not by choice. You will be too, if those hogs were your handiwork.”<br />
<br />
You cock your head to the side, “What about them? Isn’t that normal for the island?”<br />
<br />
Cathy barks out a laugh, holding her chest as she attempts to stop herself from choking. “There is no normal <br />
here. But even for the island, no, that’s not the way things work. There are rituals, there are procedures, <br />
there are limitations. But not for you.” Cathy takes the bone in her hand, stripping the thin film of meat off <br />
its smooth surface with her teeth as juice dribbles onto her dress. “And, as you would have found out, not for <br />
me.”<br />
<br />
“You’re like me?” This was instantly followed by your second thought, “And no one else is?”<br />
<br />
“We’re two peas in a very unique pod,” Cathy said as she flashed a smile.<br />
<br />
This is an opportunity you can’t pass up. As quickly as possible you think up a list of questions for your <br />
buxom teacher, then you order them for importance, “So what I can do, and what you can do, is an uncommon <br />
ability. Is there a reason I can do this?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to tell you that.”<br />
<br />
Damnit. Next, “Am I still human?”<br />
<br />
Cathy pauses to decide how, and how much, of that question she wants to answer, “Well, you certainly look like <br />
one, don’t you? And you feel like one. And you’ve got all the right human bits. So, overall, I’d say you’re <br />
probably human.”<br />
<br />
Evasive, but it still gives you something to work with, “Some of the men I’ve touched I’ve been able to... <br />
suggest things to, and through that I’ve controlled what they become. How much control do I have over men?”<br />
<br />
Cathy didn’t hesitate at all on this one, “Now what fun would it be if I just told you that?”<br />
<br />
Shut down, although that meant you can could look forward to more ‘science experiments’ in the future, “So we <br />
can change men then. What about women?”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t take. You can change them but it wears back off. Might last minutes, might last hours, but it’s never <br />
permanent. That’s hardly the point, anyways. “ The point? “And you can forget it if there’s something there <br />
already. Normal, mundane humans only.”<br />
<br />
That gives you a lot to think about, but now you’re feeling brave, “So can I change you?”<br />
<br />
Cathy opens her mouth, but instead of speaking she simply touches your hand. A tingling spreads over your <br />
naked flesh, and then you feel it; something from within Cathy’s hand is touching you, reaching inside you. It <br />
flows through muscle and skin, carrying with it sensations you can not begin to put words to. For this moment <br />
your hand is a hundred different hands, all of them yours, all of them being sensuously stroked to their very <br />
core, and most of them feeling like no human sensation you’ve ever experienced before.<br />
<br />
More than that you can feel Cathy’s hand as well, and you can feel a force, your force, doing the same thing <br />
to her. Just as quickly as the connection had been formed Cathy breaks it off, placing her hand back in her <br />
lap. You didn’t realise how hard you’d been breathing. From the beads of sweat on Cathy’s brow you assume the <br />
touch had the same effect on her.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t work,” she says simply. “We cancel each other out.”<br />
<br />
That touch did remind you about something you've been meaning to ask yourself, but you weren’t quite sure how <br />
to broach. “Before I came to the island the way I thought about men... well, it was pretty different than the <br />
way I do now. So... about women-” Before you can even finish the word Cathy launches herself at you. You throw <br />
up your arms out of shock but you can’t stop her from locking lips with your own. The sensation returns in <br />
full force, with more intensity than you could have been prepared for. You are dimly aware of her tongue <br />
pressing into your mouth, but simultaneously you feel an entire selection of mouths also locked in embrace. <br />
Fevered mouths caught in inescapable heat, cool mouths in subtle entrapment, the entire range of sensation and <br />
beyond in every moment, every second.<br />
<br />
Cathy is again the one to break away. You don’t think you’d have the willpower to do that yourself. This <br />
encounter has stolen your breath entirely and left your seat soaked straight through. “So,” you say after <br />
getting your voice back, “When do we do that for real?”<br />
<br />
“What, and ruin all men for you? We’ll save that for a special occasion.” If she was feeling the same thing as <br />
you then she had to have self control like the walls of fort knox. Cathy glances at her wristwatch. “I’ve got <br />
time for one more, and then I really need to be somewhere.”<br />
<br />
One more. Better make it a good one, even if you’re not quite sure what you’re asking, “So, I can’t change <br />
women, and I can’t change you. Can I change myself?”<br />
<br />
“What, you want to be a mindless beast?”<br />
<br />
“Well, without the mindless part. And with some control, of course. Or maybe just a small change. I don’t <br />
know.”<br />
<br />
Cathy just stares at you, holding solid eye contact until you involuntarily look away. “No,” she answers, “Not <br />
at all. That’s impossible.”<br />
<br />
Your mentor pitches the rest of her steak into the lake and gets up. As you return to the mainstreet you see <br />
one of the island’s caretakers about to lead the two pigs away. You cry out to stop him, but you’re not quite <br />
sure what to follow up with.<br />
<br />
“Looking for a new pet?” Cathy asks.<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s just you said that sausage had been rare recently, so I wanted to...”<br />
<br />
“You wanted first dibs?”<br />
<br />
Did you? Less than an hour ago those had been people. Sleazy people, but still people. Did you really want to <br />
eat them? Are you prepared to?<br />
<br />
Cathy doesn’t wait to hear your lack of answer. She pulls what looks like a metallic magic wand out of her <br />
handbag and approaches the sow. As she holds it the wand’s tip unfolds, forming a rounded symbol that <br />
brightens to a white hot heat in an instant. The sow squeals pathetically as it is branded. Once the mark is <br />
visible Cathy retracts her wand, dropping the now cool stick back into her bag.<br />
<br />
“When you’ve come to a decision go to The Menagerie and ask for my private collection. They know me well <br />
there.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks. Where do I get one of those for myself?”<br />
<br />
“Oh you’ll figure out soon enough.” And then Cathy is gone, and you are again alone with the hung over morning <br />
crowd of Pleasure Island. You turn back to the lake in time to catch sight of something large displace the <br />
water where Cathy had tossed her breakfast before it quickly dives again.</p>
