<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mommy got ready for the day.  she knew that she didn&#39;t have worry about her babies and so, she didn&#39;t bother to dress them at all.  She was looking forward to becoming a participant in the research and so she dressed like it.  She had a spare adult diaper accidentally brought home from work that she put on herself.  It was a super maximum 15 solid black drip medium diaper, the thirstiest the institution had. It was thick and made  her waddle a bit, but it was worth it for her babies and her country.  She was sacrificing herself and her family for the greater good.  She then put on her green sweat pants.  The sweat pants had to really stretch to fit over the diaper to fit in place.  The seat of her pants really bulged out and she could clearly see the waistband of her diaper.  She then put on her green sweat shirt without putting on a bra.  Finally she put on her most comfortable socks and shoes.  She first went to Dana&#39;s room, woke her up, and then walked her down to Ryan&#39;s room to wake him up.  She didn&#39;t bother changing either child, the special school would do that for her.  Dana knew what was happening, but didn&#39;t fight it.  She was expecting to go to nursery school anyway just as Madame promised.  She&#39;d be back &quot;home&quot; soon enough.  Ryan, for his part, didn&#39;t fight mommy, either.  But she sure did look funny.    Monica, guiding her children by the hands, entered her living room and fished for her keys.  She hoped she didn&#39;t get caught driving without her license.  She then exited the door and locked it knowing that the school would dispose of it for her.  She opened up both back car doors and secured her children to their safety seats, for Dana, a pink kitty themed seat and Ryan, a black special needs seat.  She then started her car and drove to the school.  She&#39;d found a parking spot and got her kids out of the car and guided them towards the building.  As soon as Dana saw the building, a bubbly funny feeling happened to her like no other.  She&#39;d paused for a moment as her penis went erect.  The best orgasm she&#39;d ever had in her life left her jerking her hips as if she was trying to masturbate in her diaper without using her hands.  She came in her diaper and that was it.  Instead of a 30 year old man with his intellect intact, a seven year old girl with the mentality of two years old stood in her place.  She smiled because she knew that mommy sent her here to have a good time.  She had hoped that she could play with a baby doll and feed it.  Ryan was slightly oblivious as to why he was here.  Mommy looked over to see why Dana had paused.  She figured it out though, Dana made a stinky in her diaper.  Mommy didn&#39;t care, though, it wasn&#39;t her problem anymore.  Mommy finished her final walk to her destination and used her palm to buzz herself in.  She immediately went to the director of the center and explained that she wanted to put in her job resignation so that she could enroll herself and her kids into the experimental program.  The director had immediately agreed, because mommy was the smartest person who had ever voluntarily joined the program.  She sat down for the next hour filling out papers.  Meanwhile, the kids helped themselves to the fun looking wooden blocks in the director&#39;s office.  Dana would build a house and Ryan would knock it down.  They both giggled because it was funny and then they&#39;d repeat the process.  The director came back with another man who had a tray with three needles on it.  The man then injected each child with the needle&#39;s contents.  It stung a little, but not enough to hurt.  Only mommy knew why he did it.  The director then made a mental note to move mommy&#39;s file from employee to student later on in the day.  He made a mental note to remove mommy&#39;s hand print from the security system&#39;s data.  Three other nurses entered the director&#39;s office and took one child each.  Dana was led into the children&#39;s section that had Monica in it and into the main play room.  She found a dolly lying on the floor and she ran up to it to hug it.  Ryan went into a different section for toddlers and started running around looking at the fun stuff in his play room.  Finally, mommy, who was starting to feel like she needed the bathroom entered the adult play section.  She walked over to a disused play gym after being stripped of her clothes except her diaper and crawled under it and started batting it with her hands and feet.  Everyone in the room could see her breasts, but her breasts weren&#39;t the only ones exposed so it was okay.  While she batted at the toys above making the rattle and jingle, she pushed the first of many poo poos into the seat of her diaper, it was hard at first and she had to grunt, but she did it.  Afterwards, she easily peed for the first of many times into the diaper.  Any thing for science.  She&#39;d done the best she could for her kids, they were at the mercy of the director now, but she knew that he would treat all of them well.  In the corner of the room, a nurse noticed mommy grunting and went over to stick her finger into the leg band of mommy&#39;s diaper.</p>
