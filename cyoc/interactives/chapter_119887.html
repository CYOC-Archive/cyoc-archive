<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The boys headed down the hall to the locker room.  As the approached, they heard Jae yell &quot;son of a bitch&quot;.   Park took off like a rocket into the locker room.  As he rounded the corner into the locker room, he saw someone seemingly engulfed in light.  Park ran to him and embraced him, saying &quot;No!  I won&#39;t let you go...I won&#39;t let them take you from me!&quot;  Park could feel the changes happening.  Jae grew to his height of 6&#39;2.  He then felt Jae...expand.  He could feel his pecs growing, he could tell his biceps were growing, rounding out at about 21 in.  He could tell other areas were expanding.  He weighed 225 now.<br />
As the light faded, Park someone who resembled Jae, but wasn&#39;t.  This new version, with his green eyes seemed to look directly into soul. <br />
&quot;hey babe!  What&#39;s wrong?&quot;  This new, yet not new person asked as he started to grind up against Park.<br />
Everyone else entered, as Park jumped back realizing that this Adonis was only wearing a jockstrap that, judging by the fact that he was getting hard, wouldn&#39;t be able to contain his cock.<br />
&quot;Jae?&quot; Silas asked as he stared at a senior who was still Asian, maybe still Korean, with the amazing body.<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s Jae, Si?&quot; He asked, making Silas&#39; blood boil a little because he hated when people called him that.  &quot;Don&#39;t you remember?  What the hell!  It&#39;s me!  Jace &quot;the ace&quot; Henderson&quot; he said<br />
They all nodded, so as not to upset him.  Park said to Jace &quot;just one sec, I just got to confirm something for practice.&quot; <br />
Park walked over to them and whispered,  &quot;Guys this is serious!  Stay together, no less that 2.  We&#39;ll meet at my place later.  Got it?&quot;  They nodded.  &quot;don&#39;t touch or do anything out of the ordinary!&quot;  They quickly dispersed.<br />
Park turned around and anxiously said &quot;So....&quot;<br />
Jace took a step forward, &quot;So.&quot;<br />
Park couldn&#39;t help but stare at his body, &quot;don&#39;t you have practice?&quot;<br />
Jace replied &quot;nope&quot; and took another step forward.<br />
&quot;Then why are you here?&quot; Park&#39;s staring was starting to become obvious.<br />
&quot;Same reason as you.  Same reason as always.&quot;  He said with a grin taking another step forward.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here looking for my boyfriend&quot; he said anxiously<br />
&quot;Here he is.  But I would have thought that isn&#39;t the only reason.&quot; He took a step forward.<br />
Park could see the lust in Jace&#39;s eyes.  He didn&#39;t know what to do.  Technically this was and wasn&#39;t his boyfriend.  &quot;Wwell, also tto let you knnow practice was canceled.&quot; He stammered through his words.<br />
&quot;Funny how that happened.  For both of us.&quot; Jace took one last step.  Park was up against the wall.  Why didn&#39;t Jace become homophobic like Hakim/Harry.  Is it possible that he interfered with the transformation?  Was that even possible?  And who was behind these tranfor...<br />
Before he could finish the though, Jace grabbed him, pulling him close and gave him a passionate kiss.  Park gave in, practically melting.  Jace made his way down Park&#39;s neck kissing, licking and sucking, until he reached Park&#39;s ear.  He nibbled on, which drove Park crazy, causing him to moan. <br />
&quot;I need you to keep pretending I sucking on your ear, I don&#39;t know who or what can see us.  It&#39;s still basically me.  I think you changed the outcome of my transformation.  I think I was supposed to turn out like Harry.&quot; Park moaned, nodding.  &quot;I need to play the part.  It&#39;s like I have two sets of memories in my head.  If anyone can figure this out, it&#39;s you.  I&#39;m gonna keep some distance, so whoever did this doesn&#39;t catch on...&quot;  He had whispered, quickly.<br />
Jace made his way up to Park&#39;s mouth and then lifted him up with ease.  Park wrapped his legs around Jace&#39;s waist.  They each had the arms around each other.  Park could definately feel Jace&#39;s cock, the jockstrap no longer able to contain it.  Jace first made sure that the locker room was locked and then made his way to the showers, never once did they stop kissing.  They got to the showers.  Jace reached around and removed Park&#39;s shirt, as Park gripped with his legs.  Without having to ask, Park got off of Jace. Jace made his way down Park&#39;s chest.  While his pecs were not as big as Jace&#39;s, they were still big. Park had made it a point to stay in shape.  Jace teased Park&#39;s nipples, causing him to moan.  He then kissed each of the abs on Park&#39;s six pack.  He looked up at Park, with a smile, and with one quick motion, lowered Park&#39;s orange board shorts. Jace smiled &quot;no boxers today...nice!&quot;  Park blushed.  Jace took Park&#39;s cock in his hand and started teasing the tip with his tongue. He then ran his lips and tongue up and down the sides.  After doing this for a few min he opened his mouth and slowly took 8 of the 12 inches into his mouth.  He ran his finger&#39;s through Jace&#39;s crew cut.  He then slowly pushed Jace onto the floor, gently, not interrupting Jace.  He slowly turned around, kissing Jace&#39;s muscular abs, until he got to the jock strap.  For some reason, Park found this sexy.  He lowered and swallowed Jace&#39;s cock.  Their bobbing heads slowly speeding up, as the thrust into each other&#39;s mouth, finally, both moaning loudly, and cumming.  They both swallowed, not spilling a drop.  Park turned around and, surprisingly Jace laid his head Park&#39;s chest, tracing his finger on or around Jace&#39;s six pack.<br />
&quot;That was amazing!&quot; Jace said.  <br />
&quot;Yeah&quot; Park said blandly<br />
&quot;Hey what&#39;s wrong babe?  Did I do something wrong?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just I kind of feel like I&#39;m cheating on Jae.&quot;  Park said feeling guilty.<br />
Jace then made his way up to Park&#39;s ear and whispered &quot;Don&#39;t worry...you aren&#39;t cheating, I&#39;m still basically me.&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just it, how do I know you aren&#39;t just playing the part being whoever did this programmed you to?  How can I be sure?&quot; Park asked.<br />
&quot;Ask me things only we would know.&quot; Jace said.<br />
Park thought for a minute.  &quot;What was your true name?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a trick question.  It was Jace Harper.&quot; He answered.<br />
&quot;When did you come out?&quot; Park asked<br />
&quot;In our original lives, I came out to you when I was 13, you came out to me when I was 14.  I came out to my parents when I was 14.&quot; He responded. <br />
&quot;When did we start dating?&quot; He asked.<br />
As soon as he finished the question, Jace responded &quot;We didn&#39;t.  You told me about 2 months ago, that you had been too shy to ask because you didn&#39;t think I was your type and I confided that I had no idea and that I would have said yes.  We started dating in this reality when we were both 13.&quot;<br />
&quot;How did we meet?&quot;  Park said<br />
&quot;We met when we were in 2nd grade, you had just moved here.  I saw you sitting by yourself and came and sat next to you.  I did this everyday until you finally talked to me.&quot;  Jace responded.  <br />
Finally convinced, Park pulled Jace on top of him and kissed him.  As it became more intense, Jace rolled onto his back, pulling Park on top of him.  Park made his way down Jace&#39;s neck onto his muscular pecs as he did, he punched his nipples before sucking on them.  As Park kissed Jace&#39;s abs, Jace spit into his hand and then grabbed Parks&#39;s dicks.  Park look up surprised, as Jace put his legs on Park&#39;s shoulders.  Jae was basically the top in the relationship, so this was new.  Jace grabbed Park&#39;s cock and guided it in.  Park was slow and gentle, as he continued to push, Jace moaned.  Park started out slowly at first.  As he quickened, he leaned into Jace kissing him their tongues entwined.  Finally unable to hold back, he came in Jace&#39;s ass, as he did, Jace also came.  Park collapsed into Jace&#39;s arms.  The two just laid there, enjoying the embrace of the other, suspecting nothing.  What neither realized is that Park had grown by about 10lbs.</p>
