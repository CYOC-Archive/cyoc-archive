<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephen decided to go to the park. Walking out the door, he realized he had left Ripe Meat alone in the house.  <br />
<br />
Turning around, he decided to go back and get the young man turned self-degraded subhuman dog with him. It was a lovely day and the dog needed some fresh air.  <br />
<br />
When he came back inside with a leash, the former Tom Stout looked at him with fear in his eyes and then acquiesced knowing that the freshman could do anything he wanted to him.  <br />
<br />
On the sidewalk, the pavement was hot. He was happy to have knee pads but his hands ached from the hot surface. It was less than a quarter mile to the park but it took a while to get there because he felt compelled to stop and piss on every fire hydrant they walked past. <br />
<br />
Tom knee it was gross and wrong but he couldn&#39;t help himself.  Stephen took as much time as he needed walking briskly to each one on the way and making sure not to block the view of his humiliation from any bystanders. <br />
<br />
Stephen did stop Tom from rolling around in the grass. When he found a used condom and couldn&#39;t help but roll in the disgusting thing. <br />
<br />
Eventually, they came to a yard with the sprinklers on and Stephen allowed Tom to get in the water only in order to wash some of the reek that his body was constantly producing. <br />
<br />
When they got to the park, Stephen found a bench and let Tom sit on the ground next to it.  <br />
<br />
After a long time of just sitting there, Stephen pulled out his laptop and began to type.  <br />
<br />
Then, he looked down at Tom and said, &quot;Speak boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked at him and said, &quot;Why are you doing this? It&#39;s awful.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen&#39;s formerly passive face shifted to a look of pure disdain. &quot;Why were you so rude to someone that you didn&#39;t know?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t...&quot; <br />
<br />
Stephen types angrily on the computer and then said to Tom, &quot;Now you&#39;ve lost your privlege to lie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom gave a doglike wimper and then said, &quot;Because I could.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen said, &quot;I guess you realize that answer is good enough for me too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so much worse than getting hassled by somebody...&quot; he trailed off not expecting a reply.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I could make you like it. If I want to, I can make it like you were always this way. You could be like D-Rod back at the house but instead of someone useful and friendly like him, you could be something everybody has always seen as a disgusting dirty freak with no respect or you could be remembered as a mindless animal. I can do anything to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom Stout visibly cringed.  He hated this.  He had been somebody before this punk had taken everything from him and now he was threatening to take more. <br />
<br />
Stephen looked at him darkly.  &quot;What do you think could be the worst things I could do? <br />
<br />
Tom said nothing. <br />
<br />
Stephen said, &quot;Speak boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instantly, dark thoughts came pouring from Tom&#39;s mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;You could make me unable to clean myself again.  You could put a shock collar on me.  You could make this tail hurt more. You could send me to live at my parent&#39;s house as a freak. You could make people fuck and abuse me.  You could get me neutered.  You could-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s enough. It seems like you&#39;ve really got the insight into the kind of monster I could become.&quot; Stephen said with a little laugh. &quot;Instead of that, what would you like me to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn me back!&quot; Tom said a little too forcefully. <br />
<br />
&quot;That wouldn&#39;t teach you anything.&quot; Let&#39;s see, instead of being a nasty raunch dog that will do anything to degrade himself, I think we can form a compromise.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephen typed into his computer. <br />
<br />
After typing, for a while, he looked over at Tom and said, &quot;Any last words?&quot; <br />
<br />
Tom just stammered. <br />
<br />
Then Stephen said,  &quot;I&#39;m kidding.  From now on, you will be a mostly normal person. Your elongated tongue and enhanced cock and balls will remain the same but you won&#39;t produce any more odor than would normally have.  Also, I&#39;m toning down the piercings and the tattoos. With that all done, you should be able to play football and graduate again.  You will still enjoy the raunchier side of sex but not to the point that it will keep you from having a relationship with the man or woman of your choosing.  Also, as a reminder of your need to be polite, you will still feel the need to sexually satisfy those around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom almost started to cry.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Get over it.  You still haven&#39;t seen the finished product.&quot; Stephen said. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really am sorry I was mean to you.&quot; Tom said.  <br />
<br />
Stephen hit the enter key and Tom felt himself change.  The long chains between his nipples vanished and he no longer felt the need to crouch beside the bench. Tom stood up and realized he was now clothed in a pair of silky jogging pants. Whether he knew it or not, the tattoo that read, &quot;BIG WHOLE ON CAMPUS&quot; had changed to a simple tribal design. The tattoo &quot;RANK MEAT&quot; on his lower stomach had moved down to a more discrete place on his thigh and changed to the words, &quot;RAW MEAT&quot; in a cursive font.  <br />
<br />
As Tom stood up, he realized that the buttplug he had lodged in him was finally out. When he got up, he actually felt the need to hug Stephen. He didn&#39;t know whether it was the programming or if he truly felt appreciative but he did it.  <br />
<br />
Stephen pushes him off and said, &quot;You still reek!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked around and saw the park bathrooms. He ran over to them. Giving a cursory glance around the stalls, he went over and locked the main door and pulled out his nine inch dick. He washed the congealed gunk from it in the sink getting a little bit of a thrill from being exposed in a public place. <br />
<br />
Then, he heard a knock on the wall of the toilet stall.  He had been so happy to be able to clean himself that he hadn&#39;t properly checked the stalls. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; He said.   <br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you&#39;ve washed that off, why don&#39;t you let me see that.  I&#39;ll give you a freebie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dean, is that you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So much for anony...uh.., anonin... um you not knowing me,&quot; said Dean Yang with a ditzy giggle. <br />
<br />
&quot;I really shouldn&#39;t...&quot; said Tom feeling his slight cleanliness draining away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on.  I want to.&quot; Dean said with a slightly pouty lilt to his voice.  <br />
<br />
Tom&#39;s desire to please went into action and he found himself squeezing his fat dick through a tiny hole in the side of the stall. <br />
<br />
He felt Dean gently fondle his cock on the other side of the wall. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been a dirty boy.&quot; He said sounding dumber than Tom had ever heard him.  <br />
<br />
Dean went to work.  Using his tongue expertly. Tom felt himself grab the top of the stall with both his hands eagerly trying to fit as much of his cock in the wanting mouth on the other side. After almost ten minutes he felt his back arch and his bare toes curl as he unleashed a torrent of spunk down Dean&#39;s throat. <br />
<br />
Dean cleaned the sponge off of the softening cock paying close attention to the piercing. <br />
<br />
Tom, a painting mess said, &quot;You do good work.&quot;<br />
<br />
He heard Dean say in a satisfied voice, &quot;Another happy customer... no, freebie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom pulled out of the hole in stall and went back to washing a lot of his accrued grime off again.  When he finished and threw the paper towels he used away, he heard Dean say, &quot;Spread the word! I need some paying customers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom left and walked back over to where Stephen was still sitting.  <br />
<br />
Stephen looked up at him and said, &quot;I see you met another of my creations.&quot; Tom blushed a bit and said, &quot;What did he do to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing, but he&#39;s happier now than he&#39;s ever been.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom looked a little scared but he didn&#39;t try to do anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna head back to my dorm now. I&#39;ve got to get ready for the game tomorrow. Is there anyway you could give me some shoes and a shirt?  Stephen just typed on his computer and instantly, Tom was wearing a pair of bright pink flip flops and a stringer tank top with a Rottweiler on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;The humiliation continues!&quot; He said with a laugh feeling oddly comfortable with the man who had been his tormenter for the last day and a half.</p>
