<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felix felt his big, ugly jackass body start to change.  He could feel his huge donkey face retract, his six inch wide nostrils narrowing as his huge nose pulled back and his mouth became smaller, his teeth resuming human size.  Then his long jackass ears become the small, pinkish appendages of a human.<br />
<br />
Up above him, Tina laughed out the window.  &quot;You have your old face on your new body!&quot;  Felix panicked.  Was she going to leave me like this?  But no, she wasn't.  It was just the random order of his transformation.  A moment later, his tail withered away and his giant rump started to slim down as well as his big, round belly.  Felix felt his knees wobble then return to human alignment of bending forward as his hooves started to splinter into fingers.  His mass was dropping rapidly now, 500 pounds, 400 pounds, 300 pounds, 200 pounds.  Felix's body was almost human shaped now and finally, he lost his thick coating of jackass hair, coarse and ugly as a car floor mat and the thick hide beneath it became human skin again.  Last of all, his beast of burden penis shrank to become his still quite impressive human organ.<br />
<br />
Felix looked down at his 6'1&quot; tall 171 pound body with tremendous relief.  &quot;I'm-I'm me again&quot;<br />
Oh, thank god he told himself and reproached himself for worrying that his sister would do something to him.  Still, though, he was trapped naked outside his own house.  Felix ran over and pressed his back and bare ass against the brick of the side of the house.  He pondered his options.  He could hear his father still hammering at the jamb around the front door.  That was out of the question.  He also couldn't get in the kitchen without going past his father.  But he looked up toward the window and realized that there were enough extended brick edges to grasp to climb up.  Felix made like spiderman and got his head up to the window.  <br />
&quot;Just close the door and turn out the light&quot; Felix pleaded and pulled himself halfway through the window.<br />
&quot;Um, a little privacy if you don't mind&quot; he asked his sister at the door to his room. She smiled and nodded and left.  Felix finished pulling his naked body through the window into his darkened room and carefully closed the window behind himself.  Tina had turned off the light and Felix noticed she had also taken the laptop with her.  Hey!  Felix ran to his door and poked his head out.<br />
&quot;Hey, bring that back!&quot; he whisper-shouted down the hall after her.<br />
&quot;I just want to examine it, okay?&quot;<br />
Felix sighed&quot;Okay, but please don't operate it.  Don't do a transformation.  It's tricky.  Look what happened to me&quot;<br />
Tina smiled back at him and nodded.<br />
<br />
Felix shut the door behind him and flopped into bed with a sigh of relief.  As he hit the bed, he released a loud fart.  W E R T!!!  And laughed at himself as he fell asleep.<br />
<br />
It was a night of fitful sleep for Felix.  He sweat so much that the sheets were damp as he woke.  He sat up feeling oddly unrefreshed as he turned off the alarm.  <br />
&quot;Come on sleepyhead!  Get up!&quot; he heard his mother call from the hallway.  &quot;Your sister's already up and gone&quot;<br />
<br />
Felix yawned and then sniffed.  <br />
&quot;What the . . ?&quot;<br />
There was a terrible odor somewhere in the room.  Felix climbed to the end of the bed to look around.  Did the neighbor's dog get in the house again?  But as Felix scanned the room, still sniffing, he identified the source of the smell.  The sheets.  He pulled them up to his nose but quickly threw them back down.<br />
&quot;God!  That's terrible!&quot;  It was a bizarrely pungent brew of sweat with hints of feces and even skunk.  <br />
&quot;And she's already gone, huh?  So she sprayed me with some kind of stink bomb before leaving.  Ha ha.  Very funny Tina.  Very funny&quot;<br />
Felix smelled the skin of his shoulder.  God, it's all over me, too.  Well, no big deal.  I'll wash it off me.  <br />
<br />
Felix got up and stretched.  He suddenly noticed a bloated feeling at his tiny male model waist but just moments later.  W E R T!!!  He let loose a blast of gas that he reckoned was the loudest fart he'd ever heard.  Felix smiled.  &quot;Wow.  Glad that was here and not at school&quot;<br />
Felix went to the bathroom and scrubbed his skin to a pink then brushed his teeth and looked at himself in the mirror.  He smiled.  He was the junior olympian swimmer with a male model face that he'd been since Tony and Claire had altered him with the chronivac.  But, what was that?  He leaned in close to the mirror.  There on the end of his perfectly shaped nose was a small reddish bump.  A pimple.  <br />
Hmmph.  &quot;Well, I suppose it's inevitable&quot; he said as he applied deodorant and went back to his room.  <br />
<br />
Felix quickly dressed, wolfed down a bowl of cereal and ran out to meet Tony and the others at the street corner as usual.  As he approached, he sniffed at his clothes.  Nothing.  Good.  He joked with Tony and Jack and Claire as they walked along.  Well, with Tony and Jack.  Claire gave him a couple of slightly odd looks but he didn't think anything of it.  She gave him a much worse look when he suddenly felt his perfectly flat abdomen bloating up again followed a minute later -W E R T!!!- by an uncontrollable fart that had Tony and Jack almost falling down laughing and Claire shaking her head worriedly.  Felix shrugged good naturedly.  <br />
<br />
He went off to his locker to get his books.  There, the girl at the next locker asked him about the swim team.  Felix was answering when he saw the girl turn her head away with a look of disgust.<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Felix.<br />
She covered her nose and mouth with one hand.  &quot;Your . . I'm sorry, your breath.  Ewwwwww!&quot; she added and scampered away.<br />
What?!<br />
Felix held his hand below his mouth and let out a breath then sniffed.  <br />
Oh god.  <br />
It *was* bad.  It was horrible.  How . . but-but I brushed my teeth just a half hour ago.  Felix sighed and went to homeroom.  As he was sitting there listening disinterestedly to the morning announcements over the intercom, he got that same feeling of his perfectly flat abdomen seeming to bloat up again.  Oh no.  Not this time.  With all his will, he tried to stop or at least minimize what happened next.<br />
W E R T!!!!<br />
The whole class turned around laughing and pointing at him.  <br />
Felix dropped his head in shame but sighed and left the room when the bell rang for first class as though nothing had happened.  Maybe it was the milk.  Or maybe there was something in that new cereal.  I've never been lactose intolerant.  Not in this new body.<br />
<br />
Felix had hoped that would be the end of last of the ridiculous tuba blast flatulence, but, to his chagrin, like old faithful, his innards somehow produced a huge blast of gas every half hour that he couldn't stop or control no matter how he tried.  Anyone seated behind him actually jumped out of their seats.  Even teachers joined in the ribbing as students not having to jump out of their seats nearly fell out, laughing at Felix.<br />
<br />
What was particularly puzzling to Felix was that he only felt as though gas was building up inside him for a minute before each gaseous eruption from his butt. There wasn't so much as the slightest feeling of his stomach settling.  Nothing.<br />
<br />
But as much as other kids laughed at his bizarre gastric predicament, his friends Tony and Jack were there in the hallway to pat his back and assure him that things would be fine.  But talking to them at normal conversational distance in the hallway, he saw even Tony and Jack flinching at the smell of his breath.  <br />
Sniffsniff.<br />
He tested after they'd walked away.  It was worse than at the start of the day talking to the girl at the next locker.  What's that smell? he wondered.  It's like rotten meat or something.  God!  Frigging Tina must've put something in the milk and/or the cereal to do this to me!  Wait till I get hold of her!<br />
<br />
He made a point in the afternoon of avoiding breathing on other kids, making sure to aim his nuclear powered bad breath away from them as much as possible.  <br />
<br />
What he couldn't change and what became unmistakeable by the afternnon, was his B.O.  Felix thought he'd rid himself of it by scrubbing himself in the shower that morning.  But he caught a whiff of the smell coming off him at lunch.  It was the same horrible mix of sweat with elements of feces and even skunk that was all over his sheets.<br />
<br />
And then Felix realized.  It wasn't his sheets.  It wasn't something Tina put in his milk.  It was him.  The sweat off his body had made the sheets reek so bad they should be burned.  By the afternoon, the fetid smell was so powerful that kids at adjacent seats were leaning away and he heard them whispering to each other.  One girl snorted &quot;God he's like the valet on Seinfeld who ruins Jerry's car with his B.O.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the last class of the day, Felix felt as though he must have a cloud around him like the Pigpen character from the Peanuts comics.  Only his cloud wasn't dirt but bad breath, B.O. and, every half hour, the Krakatoa of farts.  And then he noticed something else.  The lone pimple on the end of his nose now had a cohort of a dozen more deep red splotches spread randomly across his face.  Felix noticed as he walked by the door to his calculus class.  <br />
&quot;Oh my god&quot; he muttered at the sight and a boy who didn't like him quipped &quot;Out of the way pizza face&quot; as he squeezed past a stationary Felix into the room.  <br />
<br />
Felix made his way listlessly to his seat.  As he sat, he noticed that his back was itching and reached one hand back through his collar.  He stopped short of scratching, though.  The itch was a crop of zits on his back.  He dropped his head in resignation.  One more uncontrollable blast of flatulence and 47 minutes of being the p.u. pariah later, Felix nearly ran out of the class.  <br />
<br />
He wanted to go home, but he had a swim team practice to go to.  Felix ran from the school to the Y to change.  As much as he now smelled and farted and looked pockmarked, he still had all of his athletic ability.  Two old women watching him sprint effortlessly past on the sidewalks stood agape at the boy flying past.  <br />
<br />
Felix barely flashed his Y i.d. at the guy at the desk and ran to the boys' locker room.  He quickly stripped and seeing a can of lysol at the nearest sink, grabbed it and sprayed it over and over onto his clothes in his locker.  Then he went to the nearest mirror.  Even his drum tight buns were polka dotted with zits.  And his face and back were even worse, the white of his face now being in the minority.<br />
<br />
Felix sighed and carefully pulled on his speedo brief.  He nearly ran out to the pool as he pulled on his goggles.  <br />
&quot;Hi coach&quot; he offered striding past her and he jumped into the pool.  The faster he started, the faster he could finish his required laps.  Felix swam with all his might.  If he could finish his laps early, he could get out of the pool while everyone else was still swimming.  <br />
<br />
He never swam harder for longer than he did that afternoon.  Taking breaths between strokes, he saw other kids getting into the pool and had to be careful as he swam because there were now two more kids in his lane.  <br />
<br />
At last, done his 50 laps, Felix looked desperately up from the wall.  He stepped up from the touch pad at the end of the lane and felt a mild shock.  A couple kids said that particular pad needed to be replaced.  Felix practically jumped out of the pool and tried to make his way furtively past the coach, who was talking to an old woman at her side.<br />
&quot;Felix!&quot; she called out as he approached.  &quot;C'mere Felix!&quot;<br />
Oh god no.  I must look like fucking quasimodo by now.  I . . I<br />
&quot;Felix!  I want you to meet my mother&quot;<br />
With a panic stricken pant, Felix slowed to a stop.  He closed his eyes as he changed direction and walked over to the swim coach.<br />
&quot;Yes ma'am&quot; he said and stopped in front of her making a special effort to stand up straight even though he was hideous.  <br />
&quot;Felix&quot; the coach began cheerfully &quot;This is my mother.  Mom, this is the boy I've been telling you about&quot;<br />
The old woman reached forward and put her hand to Felix's cheek.  He flinched slightly but held his position.<br />
&quot;Such a handsome face.&quot; she warbled.<br />
Felix looked around.  Is she kidding?  <br />
&quot;And such a wonderful physique&quot; she cooed touching her hand to Felix's muscular shoulder then his narrow waist.<br />
<br />
Hey, wait.  I wonder . . <br />
Felix stetched one arm behind him and rubbed the rear of his speedo.  An arc of muscle uninterrupted by anything like a pimple.  He fanned his hand across his back.  The skin was smooth and flawless.  His eyes went wide with delighted surprise.  He put one hand to his mouth and smelled his breath.  He couldn't smell anything.<br />
<br />
He turned to the old woman and before speaking to her, noticed Tina in the stands beside the pool.  She smiled and waved at him.  Felix waved slightly and mouthed the words 'Thank you'.  He spoke happily to the coach and her mother for a few minutes then approached the stands where Tina sat.  As he aproached, he saw the laptop peeking out of her backpack.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had to have a little bit of fun with you&quot; she chuckled.<br />
&quot;Okay&quot; Felix sighed &quot;but could you do something about my clothes in my locker.  You wouldn't believe how bad I smelled&quot;<br />
&quot;Already taken care of B.O. bro&quot; said Tina and both smiled.</p>
