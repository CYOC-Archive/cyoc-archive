<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the genie has given a surprising amount of reasons to upside-down transform, that list did not include what you wanted most: companionship.  You live a lonesome life, with an at-home job.  No local friends, no significant other.  You spend most of the day at home, only really leaving to get groceries.  Admittedly, part of the issue is you&#39;re too shy to meet people.  Even if a genie had one of those &quot;can&#39;t force true love&quot; rules, you had hoped to at least rid yourself of your shyness.<br />
<br />
You tell the genie all this, hoping that he could do something to help.  At this, the woman who was once his butt spoke up.  &quot;Well, of course you can get companionship out of a UDTF.  Are we not proof of that?  Not only do I get to be a person, but I always have someone with me.  Even when there are days, weeks, months that we are left alone in the bottle, we are never truly alone.  I love my little genie.&quot;  Her puckered lips give a smile, as she reaches down as she strokes the chin of the dicked genie, who almost seems to smile as well, despite basically just being a penis with eyes.<br />
<br />
Though the woman has certainly made an upside-down transformation sound more appealing, the way she is showing affection toward the genie reminds you of a man alone with himself, such as you are.  You do not want to simply reverse the roles of you and your penis.  You want a new life to go with it.  And though it would mean giving up your current life to become a body part, you figure its your only chance of improving your life.<br />
<br />
So, hoping the genie is able to come up with a solution that would best suit you, you make a wish.  You wish for companionship, but not as a sexual tool.  You want your host to live a new life for you.  One that can help fix your shyness.  Though, you&#39;d be perfectly alright with them doing all the talking.  You just hope they wouldn&#39;t feel too lonely when they&#39;re talking to themself.  You&#39;d also prefer that they not resemble what they once were.<br />
<br />
The genie gives a &quot;hmm&quot;, closing his eyes in thought.  The act would make him look like a normal penis, if you weren&#39;t already aware of the faint lines where his closed eyes are.  Then, his eyes quickly open, and the genie bobs as though nodding.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you find yourself lifted in the air, and flipped upside-down.  Panicking from the sudden reorientation, you look over yourself.  You haven&#39;t yet transformed, but there&#39;s already a sense of permanency to it.  Never again will you be standing upright.  Also, your clothes have disappeared, but given that you&#39;re hanging upside-down in front of a genie who is a penis, that part is not so concerning to you.<br />
<br />
Then, the transformation begins proper, as your neck begins to extend.  As it does so, you begin to lose feeling in the lower (upper?) half of your body, as though you were being pulled out of your body.  Despite this, you remain attached.  Moreover, the point at which you are attached begins to move, heading between your shoulder blades.  Yet your neck extends at a rate that allows your head to stay in its position, looking up towards your body.  You watch as your body seems to begin getting bigger.  But then, looking around, you realize the rest of the world is getting bigger, too.  No, it&#39;s not the world that&#39;s getting bigger, but your head.  As you look around, your neck&#39;s connection to your head also changes, shifting from the bottom of your head to the back of your head.  As your head becomes smaller, so too does your neck become skinnier.<br />
<br />
You then realize that your arms and hands feel strange.  You try lifting your hands to your face, but instead find your arms unable to move in that way.  So you crane your neck to look at what&#39;s happening, and discover that your arms have lengthened and thickened, mid-transition into becoming a pair of legs.  Most shockingly is what&#39;s happened to your hands.  Expecting to find a pair of human feet, you instead find a pair of cloven hooves, with a pair of smaller hooved digits behind them.  Trying to flex what was once your fingers, you realize that you no longer feel your thumbs, as they have disappeared.  And then, the feeling in your former hands begins disappearing entirely, as you lose sensation of more of your body.<br />
<br />
If your hands are turning into hooves, does this mean you are turning into an animal?  Craning your neck to look back up your body, you are once again shocked at what you discover.  There is your penis, much larger, as it transforms into the head of a goat.  But that&#39;s not what&#39;s so shocking.  There is another head beside it!  This one seems to be puffed out, and does not resemble a goat.  You also notice at the end of its muzzle is your former anus.  The anus opens up, and the cheeks thin out, as a now-feline muzzle takes its first breath.<br />
<br />
You&#39;d continue watching the transformation of your penis and butt, if not for a light crushing sensation with your head.  No longer satisfied with simply becoming smaller, it now feels like it&#39;s being flattened.  You close your eyes, as a slight headache forms.  But then you realize, despite having your eyes shut, you can still see.  You try opening your eyes, but they still feel shut, as though your eyelids have locked themselves shut like a window.  The view is also disorienting -- your field of vision widens as your nose and mouth push your eyes apart.  Your mouth also feels very strange, as your tongue shrinks in size, filling less of your mouth, and splitting at the end.<br />
<br />
It is this latest change that allows you to put two and two together.  You seem to be becoming a chimera of some sort.  Two heads -- one a lion, the other a goat -- and a snake for a tail.  <i>You</i> are going to be that snake.<br />
<br />
Looking up at the heads to confirm your suspicion, you are once again caught by surprise, this time by a pair of breasts obstructing the view.  It seems you&#39;re going to be the tailsnake of a chimera <i>woman</i>.  One covered in dusty brown fur.  Fur that you realize you cannot feel outside of her furry legs, and only because your snake body is brushing between them.  You look at her crotch, just in time to watch it open into a new virgin vagina.  It&#39;s the first time you&#39;ve seen one in person.  Your face is mere inches from it.  But you can&#39;t smell it.  Unless... you flick out your tongue like the snake you&#39;ve become.  As you pull your tongue back in, it pulls in the scent.  Sure enough, despite having a nose, your sense of smell is now located in the roof of your mouth.<br />
<br />
You pull yourself out from between the chimera&#39;s legs.  Slowly, as you enjoy the feeling as their fur brushes along your scales.  Once out, you can see that your snake body is covered in green scales.  Twisting yourself furthur, you see that your body now hangs over the shapely rear of a furry woman.  Despite that womanly body being yours a few minutes ago, you cannot feel it.  For all intents and purposes, you are not the chimera, but her tail.  Your sense of self ends at the base of the tail, where your scales are surrounded by her fur.<br />
<br />
Despite this, you cannot help but be amazed at your transformation.  You hadn&#39;t even considered becoming part of a mythical creature.  And still a creature, yourself, even despite your role as a body part.  You wanted to voice your approval.  But as you opened your mouth to speak, you realized that you could no longer find your voice.  Your new hostesses would indeed be &quot;doing all the talking&quot;.</p>
