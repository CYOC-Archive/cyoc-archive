<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next area Ty moved into was the petting zoo, together with farm animals. Looking around he could already see some of his classmates as animals here. As the first enclosure to his right were horses and donkeys, as they both needed more room to move, Ty decided to start there. He decided on more than one person changing here, so he had to alter his wishing schema a bit.<br />
„I wish that Tony, Lisa, and Harry jump over the fence into the enclosure as soon as the class gets here. The others will look elsewhere in that moment so nobody notices the three inside. When all three are inside together they will drop down on all fours and be unable to stand back up or leave the enclosure on their own. Everyone but they themselves each and me will see Tony as a donkey, Lisa as a horse and Harry as a young pony. Nobody but me can understand them, hearing Tony braying and Lisa and Harry neighing instead of speaking. As soon as someone from the class starts to pet them, they will start to slowly change into their new animal form in body, unable to hurt anyone or move away from the petting. I will be able to talk to them telepathically, sounding like their respective voice to them so they will think I´m their own inner voice. The other animals will accept them in their group as family but will stay away until the three are fully changed. Nobody but me will remember them as humans after they jump over the fence.” Satisfied Ty jumped inside himself, waiting for the class to arrive here.<br />
<br />
It took the class nearly ten minutes to arrive in the area. All but his three selected looked towards the cows, goats and bulls on the opposite enclosure first, while the trio came straight to this one looking at each other nodding, jumping in together. And all three instantly toppled down, landing on all fours next to each other. Each of them struggled to get up again without looking at the others, but that was due them forgetting each other for the time of their changes. And each of them said something like „Why can´t I get up?” Which resulted in them looking to their sides. Tony heard two horses neighing to his right, Lisa heard braying on her left and neighing to her right while Harry heard a braying and a neighing to his left. Each looked shocked that two of the animals have gotten so close as there was nothing there when they each jumped over the fence.<br />
<br />
Ty used this to talk with each of them while the class came over to pet them. „Why would you need to get up more?” heard each of them in their own voice.<br />
„You are a stubborn donkey Tony, an animal walking on all fours the whole time. Only humans walk on two legs and you aren´t human.” „I´m not a donkey, I´m not some dumb ass to bray all day, I´m human” came Tony´s reply, braying to anyone else.<br />
„You are a proud horse Lisa, racing around on all fours. Not some human to walk slow on just two legs.” „I´m not some horse, I´m human, so why can´t I get up? Someone help me please” screamed Lisa neighing.<br />
„You are such a cute pony, little Harry. Having fun with someone riding on your back. You can´t walk like your riders do on two legs, but you aren´t human so you don´t need to.” „What? I´m neither cute nor a pony, so stop saying such bullshit.” Harry screamed angry, but his neighing was just cute to anyone else.<br />
<br />
Then the class was with them, each getting their heads petted, starting their individual changes. Tony´s arms and legs started to get covered in short grey hairs, while his elbows and knees straighten out, leaving him with a raised-up ass. But soon his arms turning front-legs start to grow longer, equaling his legs in length. While he protested the petting loudly braying, he stopped short as he saw his hands cramp together and turning into black and hard hooves. He couldn´t see it, but his feet did the same, shredding his shoes and socks. Ty then spoke again to him: „You aren´t human Tony, you are a donkey. What human has such useless hooves instead of hands?&quot; Tony started to scream again: “No, I´m not a donkey, that´s all my imagination due to your talking. I´m human.”  <br />
At the same time Lisa´s arms and legs also started to straight out, her arms also got longer, but hers were covered in dark brown fur instead. She looked pissed that someone petted her and destroyed her hair style this way, but that turned to shock as her hands balled into fists before hardening into hooves. A rip behind went unnoticed by her, but her shoes had just been shredded by her feet turning into hooves as well. To her Ty spoke next: „Such nonsense Lisa, you aren´t human. Look at your hard hooves, what human would have such? You are clearly a horse.” Lisa answered angry: „No, you are the one talking nonsense. I´m human, and putting some mittens on my hands won´t make me think otherwise.”<br />
Harry changed similar to Lisa, but instead of getting longer arms his legs shortened to a fitting length. His growing hairs were nearly white. The petting was annoying to the proud jock, but he protested loudly as someone tried to mount his back for a ride. He didn´t even notice his changing hands or feet, as they too became hooves, leaving his sneakers and socks in shreds. He was the last to hear Ty talk to him in his own voice: „So stubborn, little pony. See, someone already wants to ride you, so stop denied them their fun and move your hooves a bit like the cute, little pony you are, Harry. You aren´t human, so stop thinking like you were.” Harry was shocked to see hooves instead of his hands as he looked down before he protested: „That´s impossible, I´m not a pony, I´m human. Take that pest away from my back and stop calling me cute, damn it.”<br />
<br />
Their changes continued. Tony was covered more and more in grey fur, itching under his clothes. But his body grew and expanded slowly, and his clothes got tears and finally burst away, with the shreds flying in the wind. He sighed in relief, not even realizing he was naked now. His tail had grown out under his jeans too, now freely moving above his ass.<br />
Lisa´s body grew and expanded more than Tony´s, tearing her clothes to shreds as well. By now she was covered in mostly brown fur, and her tail hairs had grown out, down her legs.<br />
Harry´s body had mostly kept his size, but his shrinking muscles had done their part as his jeans had slipped away. His tail was shorter than Lisa, but as he was smaller than her it was normal.<br />
Ty looked at the trio, which by now looked like animals with a human head. A quick wish let the shreds of clothes vanish, along with Harry´s mostly undamaged clothes.<br />
<br />
All their faces started to grow longer and more equine like. They all got bigger mouths on their growing snout. Tony´s normal hair turned into a short black mane, expanding down his neck and a bit of his back. Lisa´s hair turned more blond, also growing down to her back, only far longer than the mane of Tony. Harry´s. hair also got longer, turning a light shade of grey. And they all were still petted by their former classmates.<br />
Ty spoke up again to each of them. It would be the last time. „Such a strong and stubborn donkey you are, Tony. But even if you are stubborn, just forget that dream of being human. You have never been human, always a donkey. Let that dream vanish when you take a piss in front of everyone present.” Tony replied with stubborn and angry braying: „I´m not a donkey. I will just wake up in my bed soon, as all this is nothing but a nightmare. As if I would piss in front of anyone.”<br />
„You are such a beautiful and proud horse, dear Lisa. Let this nonsense of being human drop away with your droppings, as you have never been human.” Lisa neighed in protest: „I´m not a horse, and I won´t just shit out here like some animal.”<br />
„Oh, stop resisting the need to be ridden, Harry. You know a cute little pony like you loves the attention. Forget about being human, that´s just an impossible dream. Leave it behind with the cum you will shoot out for the first time in your young life.” Harry neighed, now completely annoyed: „Stop calling me cute, damn it. I´m not a pony, I´m human, and I have cummed more times than anyone could count.”<br />
<br />
Ty smiled at their resistance, but made sure that their inner animals would take over soon. „I wish for Tony for piss out his remaining humanity when his cock and balls are finished changing. Lisa will shit her humanity out, and Harry will shoot a load of cum out, which is also connected to his humanity, taking it out with it. All three will keep their mind with no control over their bodies, as they gain new memories fitting their new life as their respective animal, as well as instincts.”<br />
Tony was still believing he would wake up soon, fighting the need to empty his bladder, which felt ready to burst by now. He thought about wetting his bed to fight it, but in the end lost, pissing his humanity away like it was nothing. All control he had before vanished, and a new donkey-mind formed and took said control. “No, I´m human, not some stupid donkey. Let me wake up now, please.”<br />
The newly formed donkey was calmly stating: “You aren´t dreaming, we are a donkey, living here all of our life. The only dream here is of being a human, and we need to let it go. We are Tony, the stubborn donkey.” Tony was pushed more and more back as foreign memories and instincts took their place. Soon Tony couldn´t think much of his human-self anymore, as it was deep buried and sealed in his mind.<br />
Lisa had lost faster than Tony, letting her droppings fall out. With her control moving to the newly formed horse-mind, she was crying mentally, begging: “I´m human, not a horse. I need to fight back, please let me go home.”<br />
The horse wasn´t on her side with this. “We are a proud and majestic horse, not some human. We dreamt of it, but it´s time to let go of that dream. We are at home here.” Lisa was overwhelmed by the new memories and instincts, quickly succumbing them. She was lost deep within her mind, never to resurface again.<br />
Harry felt a building need to release, more intensive then he ever felt. And as his jock-self had happily masturbated many times, trained to release it, he couldn´t stop the shoot out of cum. His control slipped with his humanity, and a much nicer and calmer pony-mind formed to take its place. “Stop, I´m human, I can´t lose to some freaky little pony. I need to get free.”<br />
“There is no need to be mean to ourselves, Harry. We know we are a little, cute pony. There isn´t anything human in us, lets get that dream washed away with our new maturity.” The pony was soothing Harry´s jock-mind into submission, the new memories and instincts washing it away into the farthest corner of the body.<br />
<br />
As the three had finished changing by now, the other animals came nearer, happy to also get some attention from the humans around. Ty left smiling, having heard the three being pushed back, mostly accepting their new lives by now. Some would remain, but far too little to break free.</p>
