<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Rachel decided whether to go to the hospital to get birth control pills or to go home instead, Melissa popped back outside from the front door and called out to her.  &quot;Hey, Rachel,&quot; she called out, &quot;You wanna come inside and do some homework together?  I&#39;ve got some lemonade we can drink while we work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Homework?  Really?&quot; Rachel called back.  She paused to think for a moment and said, &quot;Sure, I&#39;ve got some time.&quot;  She then walked up to the front door and followed Melissa in.  The two of them climbed up the stairs and to Melissa&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here,&quot; Melissa said as she placed her book bag on her bed.  &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she said as she ran out of the room.  Rachel looked around her friend&#39;s room.  It hadn&#39;t looked too different since the last time she was in there, albeit in Michigan as opposed to where she was now.  She even recognized the dresser and mirror that Melissa had when the two of them were last together.  Rachel&#39;s thoughts were interrupted when Melissa came into the room carrying a pitcher and a couple of glasses.  Rachel quickly moved to where she put her book bag down while Melissa placed the pitcher and glasses on the dresser before pouring a couple of glasses.  &quot;So, ready to get started?&quot; Melissa asked as she handed a glass to Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Rachel answered before taking a sip of her lemonade before pulling out one of her books.  &quot;Let&#39;s start with some English Lit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Melissa responded with a roll of her eyes.  &quot;Your favorite subject.&quot;  She sighed and said, &quot;I suppose I shouldn&#39;t be too surprised.&quot;  She then pulled out her own books and the two of them got to work.<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
A few hours later, Rachel stretched her back and said, &quot;I think that&#39;s the last of it.&quot;  She rolled her head around to stretch her neck and asked, &quot;Is homework always this brutal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa grinned and said, &quot;Only on days ending with the letter &quot;y&quot;.&quot;  Rachel grinned at that as she leaned back on her arms.  &quot;So, how are you taking things?  I mean, you&#39;ve been here almost a week now and well...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m doing all right,&quot; Rachel responded, &quot;I mean, all things considered.  Lots of people can turn into half-animal things.  Including lots of people at school.  We live next to half-foxes, my dad&#39;s a half-lion, and my best friend I&#39;ve known since grade school is a half-cow. So, yeah, pretty good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Melissa exclaimed, &quot;I turn into an anthropomorphic cow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel grinned as she rolled her eyes, &quot;Oh, my bad.  My best friend is an &#39;anthropomorphic cow&#39;.  It&#39;s still weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah,&quot; Melissa said as she brought her knees to her face, &quot;I mean, when I first moved here, it was weird to me.  But then I met this group, and they helped me through it.  To be honest, they aren&#39;t that much different from you or me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than growing fur, fang, and claws?&quot; Rachel teased.<br />
<br />
Melissa stuck her tongue out at her friend before replying, &quot;I don&#39;t grow fangs or claws.  Just fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel took a glance at Melissa&#39;s chest and said, &quot;Well, not just fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa replied by throwing a pillow at Rachel and said, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve grown in other ways.  But still, I&#39;m pretty much the same person that I was before I came here.  I love to help people and I still struggle in school sometimes.  And I like to think I&#39;m still friends with this girl who is a bit of a nerd.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel threw the pillow back at Melissa as she replied, &quot;Only with literature.  If you give me something like Math, you&#39;d might as well be speaking Martian&quot;.  The two girls laughed at that before continuing.  &quot;So, does it hurt...you know....when you change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Melissa said, &quot;Not really.  Really, it feels like I&#39;m stretching a muscle more than anything.&quot;  She leaned back as she searched her mind.  &quot;When Trevor first changed me, there was a bit of...discomfort.  Although, I was having sex at the time, so that helped.  But after that, changing between my human and cow fursona feels...natural.  In fact, I feel more comfortable in my cow fursona than as a normal human.&quot;  She noticed that Rachel was laughing to herself.  &quot;What?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
Rachel responded by waving her hands and saying, &quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just that...well...out of the two of us, you&#39;d be the one to lose your virginity first.  I mean, I always pegged you to be a bit more...prudish of the two of us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa felt her face warm up as she said, &quot;Well...um...yeah....it happens.  Sex is a regular thing here.&quot;  She eyed her friend and said, &quot;And what about you?  I hear you were with...what was his name...Aaron?  What was that about?  I want details, so you better spill!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, well, um...&quot; Rachel said as she remembered what happened that night, &quot;I was with Megumi asking about werefoxes and all that, and well, after I was done with her, I was on my way out.  I ran into her cousin, Aaron, and he was so mega-hot.  I stopped to talk to him, and I asked him a few questions.&quot;  Rachel paused as she hid her face a little.  &quot;I asked him about how werefoxes have this...ability...to pleasure their partners, and he...showed me.&quot;  She could feel her body warm as she remembered that night.  &quot;So, one thing led to another, and he had his hands on me, and I had my hands on him...and let&#39;s just we had a good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet,&quot; Melissa asked as she raised her eyebrow, &quot;You&#39;re not a werevixen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, uh, no.  We didn&#39;t go THAT far.&quot; Rachel responded with her hands raised.  &quot;But I did make him cum.  I&#39;ve never seen a guy shoot that much before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa rolled her eyes and said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever seen a guy shoot before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel grinned at her friend as she replied, &quot;As far as you know...&quot;  This elicited a raised eyebrow from Melissa as her friend took a sip of her lemonade.  Rachel took a moment before asking a question.  &quot;Hey, Mel.  Can I see...you know...your were form?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;Curious are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, yeah, I mean...hearing you being a werecow is one thing but seeing you...&quot; Rachel replied a bit slowly.<br />
<br />
Melissa said, &quot;No, no, I get it.  Seeing is believing after all.&quot;  She stood up and said, &quot;Sure, but on one condition.  You show me yours when you change, got it?&quot;  She grabbed her shirt and started to pull off her shirt, but paused for a moment to say, &quot;Oh, and it&#39;s fursona.  Fursona.  Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; was all Rachel could say as she watched Melissa pull off her shirt and bra.  Mel&#39;s breasts bounced a little as she pulled off her bra, and Rachel could see that despite their size, they didn&#39;t seem to drop or droop.  The second thing that Rachel noticed as Mel continued to strip off her clothes was just how muscular Mel was.  It wasn&#39;t apparent with her clothes on, but Mel was quite muscular and athletic.  Yet, despite all the muscles, Mel&#39;s body still retained that feminine shape.  Looking up and down Melissa&#39;s body, she noticed how big Mel&#39;s nipples were, and they seemed to be standing out rather prominently.  <br />
<br />
Once Melissa took off the last of her clothes, she stood naked before Rachel as she started to change.  The first thing that appeared was the red fur that grew out of Mel&#39;s skin, and, in a matter of seconds, covered Mel from head to toe in russet fur.  Mel started to grow taller, her head almost hitting the ceiling.  Rachel noticed that her muscles also grew a bit bigger on her body.  Rachel&#39;s eyes went to Mel&#39;s chest as Mel&#39;s breasts grew nearly double the size than they were previously.  Mel&#39;s fingernails and toenails grew out a bit and then covered her finger and toe tips.  Mel&#39;s ears flared out a bit and became loosely tipped.  This was followed by Mel&#39;s nose and chin jutting out to become a cow&#39;s muzzle as Mel&#39;s eye color changed to be a deep brown.  Rachel could see a pair of horns growing out of Mel&#39;s hair as the transformation finished.  Once Mel stopped growing, she bellowed out a deep &quot;Moo&quot; as Rachel watched with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked stunned as she struggled to find the words to say.  A smile could be seen on Mel&#39;s face as she said, &quot;Well, what do you think?&quot;  She turned her body in front of Rachel, giving her a full look at her fursona self.  A tail with red hair whipped around Mel as she turned.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; was all Rachel could say followed by &quot;Wow...&quot;  After a few minutes of Mel showing herself to Rachel, Rachel finally said, &quot;If I didn&#39;t see it, I wouldn&#39;t believe it&#39;s real.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s real,&quot; Melissa said.  Rachel noticed that Mel&#39;s voice was a bit deeper than in her normal human self.  Mel reached out a hooved hand to Rachel, which Rachel took, and Mel pulled Rachel up.  &quot;See for yourself,&quot; Mel said as she took Rachel&#39;s hand and put it on her waist.  Rachel could not just the fur, but the warmth of Melissa&#39;s body as well as hardness of the muscles underneath.  Rachel&#39;s hand went up and down on Melissa&#39;s body, her hands running through the fur.  Her eyes centered on Melissa&#39;s breasts as she gently moved her hands to them.  She could feel that the fur felt differently than on the rest of Melissa&#39;s body, and she gently lifted them to show that they were real.  When Rachel did this, Mel gave a lowing moo, which caused Rachel to retract her hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rachel said as she waved her hands, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to...um...you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa waved her hands back and said, &quot;It&#39;s all right.  I know you&#39;re just curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta admit, Mel,&quot; Rachel said as she sat back down, &quot;I mean, you look good...as a werecow and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Melissa responded before continuing, &quot;I think.&quot;  Rachel took a sip of her lemonade as she watched her now transformed friend.  After a few moments, Melissa asked, &quot;Are you still considering being a were?  Any idea of what kind of were you want to be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m still thinking about being a werefox.  Although I&#39;m growing rather warm to the idea of being a werebear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Werebear...huh.&quot;  Melissa responded, &quot;I take it you still have that wall of teddy bears?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Rachel responded, &quot;It&#39;s only a small hill now.&quot;  The two girls giggled at the response, &quot;But yeah.  I even talked with one earlier today.  I&#39;ll admit...I sorta like the idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet, being a werefox...&quot; Melissa started to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have fun,&quot; Rachel said with a grin, &quot;And they look...sexy...elegant...&quot;  She sighed before continuing, &quot;I could see myself being one.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa responded, &quot;Well, remember what I said earlier.  The two good reasons to change are either because you love the animal or you love the person changing you.&quot;  Melissa paused as she thought for a moment and said, &quot;And, if you know what you want, don&#39;t wait too long to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rachel said as nodded, &quot;Although, if I wanted to become a werebear...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa shrugged her shoulders and said, &quot;I don&#39;t know one personally.  Although, if you go near the woods and just call out, I&#39;m sure one would change you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Rachel asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I mean, sex is a were&#39;s favorite pastime,&quot; Melissa responded, &quot;And the woods tend to be rather active at night, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rachel responded, &quot;I just don&#39;t want what happened to my dad to happen to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you call out,&quot; Melissa said, &quot;And not search out.  Far less likely to run into an...accident...if you do it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Rachel responded as she started to gather her things.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s getting late, and I should make my way home.  Don&#39;t want my parents be worried about me and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want to wait for my dad to get home?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;He should be home soon, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;d drive you home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no,&quot; Rachel said as she waved her hands, &quot;I need time to think.  You know.  About stuff.  And a good walk helps clear my head.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Melissa said slowly.  &quot;Well, if you&#39;re sure, then have a safe trip home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Rachel responded with a smile.  &quot;See you tomorrow.&quot;  After waving goodbye to her friend, Rachel made her way back downstairs and through the front door.  As she reached the street, she looked left and right.  One direction would take her back home, and the other would lead to the hospital.  She took a few minutes to decide what she wanted to do exactly.</p>
