<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hung up suspended by my hands, shackles tight I flaile for freedom. The curse of that woman now is mixed with a possible fate of a long sentence. A crime I had no part in is judged against me by that overly short police guard.
<br />

<br />
Saturday comes and I am dropped down from the ceiling. A jug of milky slurry is poured into my mouth by a young man. He pours carefully, no spills or he is beaten by the guard.
<br />

<br />
I look in silence as his hands shake, the word volunteer is printed on the shirt front. He keeps his thoughts on the job at hand, I never get eye contact from him.
<br />

<br />
Able to do nothing but swallow the slurry my vision inspects the volunteer. A man about 35 he shows signs of extreme stress. Facially he has a strange hue to the normal white color. A green cast incircles his temples and runs past the ears into his shirt.
<br />

<br />
In a quiet small voice I ask a one word question, &quot;Lizard?&quot;
<br />

<br />
His eyes water and then blink back tears. &quot;No Lake Samon&quot; Finished he turns and walks out. As he does the sight of his legs and feet come into view.
<br />

<br />
Silvery scaled, hues of green and brown mixed through his feet looking more of a webbed fin. I was cursed to be the Captain of the Guard's mount, but he was to be a fish for the private lake inside the Park.
<br />

<br />
Up to the ceiling I rise, body naked as stomac bloats.
<br />

<br />
The slurry meal is all I'm given, no food or water all day. I try to find a way of escape but am held fast.
<br />

<br />
Somewhere about mid day the slurry liquid hits my bladder and the need to empty is suddenly a real need. I yell for a guard, but none comes. I tell I need to urinate, as I yell again the pressure starts pushing the monster cock from it's dark home.
<br />

<br />
Large and limp it crawls up and hangs out. The folds of skin give a snaking feeling as it grows! Soon the member swings long and free. I shake and wiggle which makes it swing.
<br />

<br />
A strange way of finding pleasure as I hang around. The bladder and my swinging begin to make it's feeling known to the black monster below.
<br />

<br />
Slowly the blood flows into the pockets. The head thickens as the body of the shaft inflates. A rigidness as he monster stiffens and hangs straight out hard and sensously moves. Final changes as it flares at the end and now arches up and forward, perfect contours for plunging into a mare.
<br />

<br />
The bladder releases a flow, then a stream. It flies out the end of my shaft, four feet maybe five and runs down the wall to a drain.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly like an afternoon storm rain shower heads turn on and flush the urine down and out. I too am covered with the cold water which like a shower reduces my cock and slowly it crawls back home.
<br />

<br />
The bright light never turns down, never dark yet tired I sleep as I hang.
<br />

<br />
BANG, goes the door as my morning slurry is brought in and poured down my dry throat. This time the guard stands inside while the feeding is completed.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You Mister spoke to that volunteer yesterday! This is not allowed for him or you. The Captain has sent him for final sentencing, by tomorrow night he will join many in the Pleasure Lake Fishery. If his luck holds he won't get caught by the monthly alotment of Samon fishers that rent boats and fish. Yup if he's lucky for three years, but few ever make it home!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The slurry continues to flow as I swallow. The news of my first volunteer server makes me take inventory of the one in front of me.
<br />

<br />
Female looking but chest rather flat, her body thin and casting my view to the floor I see why. Toes and feet of a doglike formation. Black canine toenails and paw pads. A gray short fur covers all the leg I can see.
<br />

<br />
Looking up into dark brown eyes she smiles and shows her fangs. Teeth in their row all canine in configuration, lips dark and the light gray fur showing a hue of change.
<br />

<br />
As the meal is finished she walks out on slinder feet as the guard leans over to me.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Kinda neat how they do it! Don't have to ask to tell she's becoming a real dog! Ha, maybe you'd like to know in a week she'll be learning to chase the mechanical rabit at the Greyhound Center Track. Oh well by then your meeting her will be long wiped clean as she was sentenced for life!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Quiet, you stupid fool! He doesn't warrant a minute by minute news cast of his jail mates, less of course you wish to be sentenced too?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Both I and the Guard looked at the doorway to see ole' shorty standing there.
<br />

<br />
Having seen and heard enough of the horror which he dealt out I asked him a kindly question. &quot;Hey Shorty did you shave all my cum off your puss this morning?&quot;
<br />

<br />
To say the least he got a little steamed up and turned a fine shade of red. The poor Guard knowing of what happened tried to hold back his laughter. There stood ole' shorty so mad he didn't know to shit or go blind!  
<br />

<br />
Since nobody else did I started to laugh quite loud.
<br />

<br />
BANG, went the door and I laughed alone as I headed for space and hanging around.
<br />

<br />
Today was as the other and soon Mr. Bladder sent his desires along party lines.
<br />

<br />
The BANG of the door issure Sunday and my morning feeding of milky slurry. I wanted to say a good morning to my server, but her face had changed overnight. 
<br />

<br />
Now a pointed snout with a sausage nose and lips peered at me. Her ears complete in greyhound style suggested her sadness. Hands now armed with canine nails held the jug of slurry.
<br />

<br />
I felt her sad frame of mind and knowing her sentence a tear ran down my cheek.
<br />

<br />
The guard was new and Shorty was nowhere in sight. As the meal finished and my lady friend padded out the door my gaurd poked me with his baton.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Damn you Sam was a good guard, nice guy, fair to either volunteers or cellmates. So you had to make fun of the Captain, and on Sam's watch too. Well the Captain is not forgiving!  He sent Sam under guard to the head Scientist with orders for him to become a prison mule for as long as your sentence lasts. His wife complained and she will join him making a new mule team for hauling peatmoss to the mill. You sure know how to make pain for good people!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bang went the door and up to the ceiling I flew. I thought to myself the hate of one person for another around here. A person good or bad had little value and even less consideration by those in power.
<br />

<br />
Friday cursed, Saturday jailed, Sunday hated, Monday sentenced or cursed either way the term would be long. 
<br />

<br />
BANG goes the door but not feeding time, instead judgement! Three guards unlock my shackles and pull a white nightshirt over the naked me.
<br />

<br />
Off down the hall I'm prodded by batons, three guards and soon Shorty joins the happy throng. Nobody speaks as he hurry to my judgement. I feel very empty this day. The fact I was not fed might be part but I felt a heavy sentence was due.
<br />

<br />
We all walked into a room where a judge dressed in chain maile for protection from spite filled prisioners sat peering out two small holes.
<br />

<br />
&quot;YOU ARE HEREBY SENTENCED!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;What? I yelled not even a hearing on the case, just sentenced? What kind of judge are you?&quot;
<br />

<br />
WACK, I'm hit by two batons from the rear of my head.
<br />

<br />
&quot;NOW NO NEED TO INJURE HIM BEFORE HE IS SENTENCED ! CAPTAIN I BELIEVE YOU ASKED FOR THIS PRISIONER TO BE REMANDED OVER TO YOU CUSTODY AFTER THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes Judge he has qualities' for being a fine aide helping me inspect for trouble around the Park.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;YES, ALLRIGHT THEN, SIR PRISIONER IT IS THE JUDGEMENT FOR THE CRIME TO SCIENCE YOU WERE CHARGED AND THE CAPTAIN SERVED ME WITH YOU GUILTY PLEA. I WILL CONSIDER THIS IN YOUR SENTENCE. TODAY AND NOW YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THERE WITH OTHERS USED FOR EXPERIMENTS IN ANIMAL HUSBANDRY.  THE CAPTAIN IN HIS WISDOM HAS ASKED THAT YOU BE TRANSFORMED ONLY IN BODY TO A THROUGHBRED STALLION FOR HIS PERSONAL USE.  THE COURT AGREES AND SENTENCES YOU TO 30 YEARS ANIMAL LABOR, GOOD DAY!&quot;
<br />

<br />
In a rush while my mind was going nuts, I'm pushed along to the Science Department for final change.</p>
