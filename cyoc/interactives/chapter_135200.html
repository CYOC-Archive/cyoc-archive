<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The tingling continues to expand until it envelops your whole body.  You begin to feel a vague tug towards your crotch, like the subtle shift in weight when you roll over in bed, but in a direction you&#39;ve definitely never experienced.  Your heart begins to race as the sensation moving across your skin becomes more intense, gaining a pleasurable feeling, and your skin begins to feel warm.  Added onto the afterglow of your orgasm, your body feels really good, but you can&#39;t enjoy it knowing what it entails.<br />
<br />
“Oh, wow, you&#39;re going to give me all of that?”  Lascivia asks with a hint of comic surprise.  “Well, this <i>will</i> be interesting.  I think I&#39;ll drink it in... slowly,” she says, drawing out the last word while looking deeply into your eyes.  “If you&#39;re giving me such a gift as this, well, surely I should let you savor it, too.  The process can feel absolutely enthralling.  I bet we&#39;ll both enjoy it,” she punctuated with a smirk.  “Well, I&#39;m sure you&#39;re giddy with anticipation, so let&#39;s begin.”<br />
<br />
She looked down at you as she held you beneath her, hand still caressing the back of your head.  While she continued to run it through your hair, the tingling began to intensify in your scalp.  As the goddess&#39;s fingers playfully grabbed bunches of hair between her fingers, she seemed to be getting smaller and smaller clumps, and dragging her fingers along them for shorter lengths.  Before you know it, you feel the air against your skin and her hands moving along stubble.  You gasp and reach a hand up to your scalp, where it meets bare flesh, still sensitive from the changing prickle that&#39;s starting to subside.  Lascivia giggles at your reaction and rubs her hand quickly all over your now bald dome.<br />
<br />
“If you think that feels strange, you&#39;re really in for something.”<br />
<br />
Before you could ask, you feel the tingle move to your stomach.  You look down to notice that the hair is also receding across the rest of your body, and you&#39;re already almost completely smooth.  But the sensation concentrates on your navel.  You feel Lascivia lower you away from her to give herself a better sight line over her breasts.  You both watch as your navel seems to begin to shrink.  You move your hand down to it as you feel flesh slowly grow together to close up, passing a finger across it over and over, until it&#39;s indistinguishable from the skin that covers the rest of your stomach.  The sense shifts up to your nipples, which you see quickly lose their color and fade into the rest of your chest.<br />
<br />
The change moves to your right hand.  You look up at Lascivia in alarm, but she just stares back silently as her smile spreads into a grin.  You turn your attention back to your hand and try to close it into a fist, only to find that your fingers aren&#39;t responding.  Your hand just feels stiff as your digits all straighten and slowly pull together until your hand is flat, thumb tight against the side of your palm.  The feeling is echoed in your left hand, and you hold them both in front of your face, the change of the left only lagging a couple seconds behind.  Slowly, you watch the details of your hands fade, the wrinkles in your palms and knuckles flattening out, and your finger prints vanishing into smooth skin.  You flip your hands over to see your fingernails retreating into cuticles that are also moving up to swallow them.  Just when there don&#39;t seem to be any details left to erase, you feel your fingers begin to shift and their forms become less distinct.  They seem to be melting into each other, as the crevices between them fill and move up towards the tips.  Your thumbs are also subsumed into your palms until all that&#39;s left is one flat mass of flesh like you&#39;d find on a cheap mannequin.<br />
<br />
You barely notice Lascivia lowering you to your feet as you stare aghast at the useless nubs that your hands have become.  You try to move them, but all you can manage is a very slight cupping motion -- definitely not enough to grab or hold anything.  As your feet touch the ground you look up to see that the mass of latex still connects you to the Amazonian creature, stretching generously to where she has placed you.  Subtle pulses occasionally run along it away from you, as if it was drawing up a liquid within.  She sees where your gaze has moved and then meets your eyes.<br />
<br />
“Mmm, no, we&#39;re not done yet, I&#39;m afraid.  You know, part of the fun of my little creation that we&#39;re sharing is the asymmetry of it.  It&#39;s completely different than normal methods of feeding, as you&#39;re doing all of the heavy lifting.  I just have to take what you offer me, but nothing is given in return.  I could just keep on drinking and drinking and drinking, as you gave me more and more and more untiiiiiil...well, nothing is left to take.  No latex beasty to go running off into the woods after his own prey, not even a puddle to hope for some snack to trip up and fall into it.  Just whatever scraps I leave behind, or maybe nothing at all.  But unlike other methods, unless I offer it, you&#39;ll have no greater ability to reclaim essence of your own than you did when we started.  Just the last vestiges of your human essence trapped in whatever vessel you retained.  Mmmmm,” she hummed in pleasure as she gazed down at you, one of her hands reaching up to absentmindedly tweak a nipple.  The two of you stare at each other in silence for several seconds before she raised an eyebrow at you expectantly.<br />
<br />
“How, uh, how much do you plan on taking?” you manage to sputter out, breaking the silence.<br />
<br />
“I was hoping that&#39;s what you would ask.  That <i>is</i> the question, isn&#39;t it?  I suppose I shouldn&#39;t just leave you waiting in anticipation,” she teases in her sultry drawl.  Her eyes then turned down to your feet, the tingling moving with them, and you lowered yours to follow.  As the changes reached your feet, the feeling was far more intense and concentrated than it was in your hands.  The latex woman knelt down on one knee, bringing her eye level just below yours.  A hand wraps around your calf to lift your right leg before another moved to grab the foot, holding it gently towards her and away from the connection between you.  You teeter and almost lose your balance, instinctively reaching an arm out towards her to catch yourself, but a third arm shoots out from her to grab you by the throat, stabilizing you immediately.  The hand releases almost as quickly before sliding down to rest against your chest.<br />
<br />
“This little piggy went to market,” Lascivia began in a sing-song tone as her hand moved to tap your big toe.  With none of the slowness of the previous changes, the toe immediately began to deform.  “Aaaaaand this little piggy...” She tapped the next toe, seemingly melting it, too.  “And this and this and this,” she said, quickly touching them each in turn.  The flesh quickly shifted together and solidified as the skin across the rest of your foot and heel rippled and shifted into a roughly foot-shaped lump at the end of your leg.  She released the appendage just as the changes finished, and you barely managed to get your weight on it before she picks up and tickles her hand across the left one.  It quickly rearranges and reforms likewise as she sets it down.<br />
<br />
The tingling moves and concentrates even further in your head.<br />
<br />
“You know, I&#39;ve already taken quite a bit,” Lascivia said as she raised her eyes level with yours.  “There&#39;s still more here that you&#39;ve offered me, but as long as I don&#39;t accept it, it could remain yours.  Do you want me to stop?  Just say, &#39;Please, goddess, spare me.&#39;  Beg me kindly and I&#39;ll leave you be.  I&#39;d hate to debilitate you more than you intended to offer,” she continued with a concerned tone, eyebrows furrowing upwards as she looked at you.  You stared in disbelief, knowing that she had no intention to stop.  “Speak up quickly or we&#39;ll continue,” she warned.<br />
<br />
You open your mouth to ask her to stop, but the moment you begin you feel an intense suction in your throat, along your tongue, and towards the roof of your mouth. You can barely open your jaw.  The pins and needles move across your lips as the sucking intensifies, forcing your mouth shut completely.  <br />
<br />
“MMMMMMMMM-” is all you manage to get out before your vocal chords seem to stop working.  You move a “hand” up to feel an unfortunately familiar sensation as it meets smooth flesh from the bottom of your nose to your chin.  You still rub back and forth along it in panic.<br />
<br />
“Oh, nothing to say?  Really?  There&#39;s still a lot left to take,&quot;  she continued in the same mocking concern before pausing for a response, as if she couldn&#39;t see what was happening.  &quot;Well, if you&#39;re sure, I guess we can proceed.”  You shake your head back and forth but her expression just shifts to a smile.  “I guess without your mouth you won&#39;t need this anymore either.”  A similar sucking sensation bursts alight inside your asshole, and you can feel it engulfed into oblivion.  You try to flex your kegel muscles, but it&#39;s almost like you&#39;ve forgotten how.  There&#39;s nothing left to try to move.<br />
<br />
She moves a hand up to her chin, tapping an index finger on the tip of her nose in contemplation.  “Who knows what will disappear next?” she wonders jokingly.  “Oh, I bet you do,” she teases as she moves her hand from her face to poke the tip of your nose.  As she does, you feel a pulling sensation in your sinuses like when you got rid of your trunk.  You cross your eyes as you see the tip of your nose start to recede back into your face.  The goddess lazily traces a finger up and down the bridge as you pant heavily, wondering what will happen when your ability to breath is gone.  You breath harder with difficulty as your nostrils shrink and the latex finger moves closer between your eyes.  Your breath stops.  The hand is drawn back from your face, allowing you to scrub yours all over the blank area that stretches across your cheeks and down to your chin.<br />
<br />
Lascivia laughs as you make heaving motions while your eyes dart around in panic.  “Don&#39;t worry, you don&#39;t need to breath.  Breathing is something human, and you&#39;ve given up too much of that part of you to do it anymore.”<br />
<br />
You try to calm down, and realize that what she said seems to be true.  You don&#39;t feel the need to breath at all, or even to mechanism to try.  The memory of it is almost alien now, like trying to imagine moving a tail you&#39;ve never had, even though it&#39;s something you&#39;ve literally done your whole life.<br />
<br />
As the panic eases, you still hold a hand to your face, moving it up and down your new skin.  You cross your eyes to look at it as you touch between them, trying to adjust to not having your nose blocking part of your vision.  Lascivia reaches forwards, grabbing your wrist to move it aside and pulling what&#39;s left of your face to hers.  She plants her lips in the blank space your mouth used to occupy, holding the one-sided kiss for a moment as she hums in satisfactions.  She releases the kiss and pulls back.  “We&#39;re almost finished now.”<br />
<br />
The prickling focuses in your ears.  Lascivia traces an index finger along the outside of your left ear, sending a shiver down your spine.  She looks at it in thought.<br />
<br />
“Hmm... On the one hand, I want to accept everything you&#39;re giving me, but it&#39;s not fun if I can&#39;t tease you.  I think I&#39;ll be generous here and give you something in return.”<br />
<br />
As she says this, you feel your ears start to shrink into your head.  She begins stroking both of them, and you feel a wetness coat them as they reduce away.  Soon, the world goes silent, not even your own heartbeat audible to you, and her hands are rubbing up and down the now flat sides of your head.  She seems to be satisfied and pulls a hand away.  Suddenly, you can vaguely hear the sounds of the forest around you, though it&#39;s a bit muffled.<br />
<br />
“There, how&#39;s that?”  She asks.  Her voice is less clear, like listening to someone speak from the other side of a closed door.  You reach your hand up to the side of your head to find smooth skin, no hole or otherwise.  However, on closer inspection, there&#39;s a slight change in texture that feels vaguely rubbery compared to the skin that surrounds it.<br />
<br />
“Have you figured it out?” Lascivia asks, looking at you expectantly  I decided to let you keep your hearing, though the bits I gave you for it won&#39;t work as well.  They&#39;re really designed to cover your whole body like the rest of our natural sensory organs, but they&#39;ll pick up enough for you to get around.  Maybe you can rely on your those new radar dishes your girlfriend&#39;s sporting back there if you really need to listen for something.  I figured it was the least I could do.  I&#39;d hate to leave you with nothing other than touch,” she said as her face split in a predatory grin.<br />
<br />
Two extra arms reach out to hold your hands as she pulls you two together.  She moves in closely and grabs your head with her normal hands, pulling it to her to place her brow against yours. The bridge of her nose runs down the blank flesh in the middle of your face as she presses your faces against each other, moving her eyes impossibly close.  They fill your vision with black and purple.  Her eyelashes tickle yours, and you could feel her breath on your skin as she asks, “Are you ready for the last bit?”<br />
<br />
All you can do is gaze back into her eyes as yours start to tingle.   You feel your lids become heavy and your vision blurs just before they force themselves shut.  The last thing you see is her inhuman gaze peering back into you.  <br />
<br />
As you lose another sense, all you can focus on is touch.  The goddess&#39;s face is no longer pressed against you.  She instead begins moving her hands and caressing all over your empty skull.  You feel the strange sensation of her fingers tracing over skin that used to be facial features.  Her hands move down your neck and begin brushing along your torso.  You feel the warmth of her move close again.  The tip of her nose touches your chin and begins running up your face.  It&#39;s followed by a wet tongue that sinuously traces back and forth as she drags it up to your forehead.<br />
<br />
The tongue leaves your skin and you hear a whisper near your right &#39;ear&#39;.  “I could have a lot of fun with a toy like you.  It&#39;s a form I&#39;ve often had my servants take before as I trained them to please me, eating up so much of their form essence.  The only problem is that you&#39;re missing one crucial bit.”  <br />
<br />
As she says this, you feel the tendril of latex that connected the two of you release form your groin.  You reach down expecting to feel it reform into the latex crotch, but instead your hand meets empty air.  You grasp as best as your nub can at the space until making contact with smooth flesh.  <br />
<br />
There are no distinct features left on your body.  As best as you can tell, you look like a skin-covered mannequin, though you no longer posses the faculty to verify.  Lascivia releases you and you hear movement that you assume is her standing back up.<br />
<br />
“Ahhhh,” she lets out in satisfaction, as if she just finished a good meal.  “Well, this was fun, and tasty to boot, but I&#39;m afraid I have no use for a toy that can&#39;t even satisfy me anymore.  Though, I suppose I have more essence than I know what to do with, and my specialty is altering it into forms far more interesting than what you&#39;ve given me.  I could give you some of your old parts back...”</p>
