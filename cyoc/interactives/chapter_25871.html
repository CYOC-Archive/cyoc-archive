<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan and Nikki both get back to Dan’s house, carrying all the party supplies and the game in with them. Dan’s parents were both out of town and he was going to make the best of it by having a big party. He invited all his friends over and some of his girlfriends’ friends too.<br />
<br />
Dan having just turned 21 two months ago finally was able to stock one of his parties up with alcohol, for all his previous attempts to buy from others only got him a bottle here and there. This party was going to be different he was now 21, a grown man, well at least in the eyes of the law, and he was going to having a drinking party using the game he just got as the center piece.<br />
<br />
Nikki, Dan’s girlfriend was still 20, had brown hair which matched Dan’s, she stood at a pathetic 4’7’’ when compared to Dan’s 5’10’’. She was a petite girl, with no defined curves. She also frequently gave Dan a hard time when he looked at other women, often accusing him of starring at their breasts. Nikki was very self conscious about her chest size, for she only had a measurement of 22A. <br />
<br />
Dan and Nikki rushed to get everything ready for the party, luckily finishing just as time for the party rolled around. As Dan opened the game box and put the board on the ground there was a ring at the door. Dan jumped up to answer and got there just as Nikki opened the door.<br />
<br />
Everyone had already arrived, “They must have been waiting outside until 8.” Dan thought. “Come in and sit down, there is some pizza at the table and I found the perfect game to get everyone in the drinking mood.”<br />
<br />
The first one to come in the door was Dan’s best friend Tony, both him and Tony grew up together. Tony had been 21 now for a couple of months but it really didn’t mean much for him, he stood a little lower then Dan at 5’8’’ but he was a well buildt individual. He had always been popular especially with his black hair, which for some reason or other women seemed to fawn over.<br />
<br />
Tony’s girlfriend Sara came in next, she was the cheerleader type, but she never joined in with the cheerleading crowd. She had blonde hair, hazel eyes, and stood at 5’4’’.  She also had a pair that had to be somewhere in the 26C range not bad for 20. Both her and Tony went and sat down near the game board.<br />
<br />
Victoria another friend of Dan’s came in next she had brought her current boyfriend Greg with her. Dan didn’t know Greg too well since Victoria and Greg had only been going out for a week. Even for being 19 Victoria was build like an Amazon, already standing at 6’1’’, she was an imposing person. Her red hair was lovely but also showed just how dangerous she was. She often would hit on Dan in private, from all her bragging Dan knew she was a 28C. As for Greg he seemed a bit out of it. He stood at a 5’8’’ and had light brown hair. He had just turned 20. They both also went and sat near the game.<br />
<br />
Next in were two of Nikki’s friends, Alice and Barbie. Alice a sweet 17 year high school senior had been in a class that Nikki had help when she was a teaching assistant, mainly to take any easy blow off class.  Alice over the last year hit a growth spurt the surpassed Nikki. Alice stood at 5’2’’, a measurement about 24B, with a darker shade of brown hair, and had clear blue eyes. Alice’s’ friend Barbie, who we were surprised showed up, was nothing like what you would think someone with the name Barbie would look like. Barbie had jet black hair, a pair of pink tinted glasses, and stood at 4’6’’.  She is the skinny book type of person, who doesn’t drink so it surprised Dan that she was here. She is in almost every class as Alice but is a year younger. She was the only one that Dan knew with a smaller cup size then Nikki, at a 20A. They both went in and started introducing themselves to everyone else.<br />
<br />
Mike was the last to come in. He was a friend of Dan’s going way back. They had even joked around about starting a band together. Mike now was 25 years old, standing at 5’7’’, with brown hair. Over the last couple years he had let him self go and was a little of the heavy side. It was no wonder that the first thing he did was go to the kitchen and grab a slice of pizza.<br />
<br />
“Wow nine people, this should be fun.” Dan thought as he closed up the door. <br />
<br />
“Ok everyone let’s get started. Where are the rules?” Dan started looking for the rules, and then Nikki spoke up, “They are written on the game board.” Everyone looked down to see the rules listed on the game board. <br />
<br />
Rule #1: Once turn order is set the game starts.<br />
Rule #2: You cannot end the game until there is a winner.<br />
Rule #3: You must take your turns in a timely fashion or take a penalty.<br />
Rule #4: Doubles go again.<br />
Rule #5: Three Doubles in a row is a penalty, and returns player to start.<br />
Rule #6:  First to reach the end wins, and gains the reward.  <br />
<br />
“Ok sounds like it could be good, just need two other rules.” Dan pulls out a marker and writes.<br />
<br />
Rule #7: Whenever a player rolls a one on the dice they do a shot of rum.<br />
Rule #8: Whenever a player rolls a six on the dice all other players do a shot of rum.<br />
<br />
“Ok lets go around starting from my left, making turn order Sara, Tony, Greg, Victoria, Barbie, Alice, Mike, Nikki, then me” Everyone agreed. <br />
<br />
“Ok now for pieces…” Dan started just as nine pieces appeared on the board.<br />
<br />
“Hah, ha very good trick” Dan stated looking at Tony.<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t me” Tony replied.</p>
