<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer and Alice where browsing the mall one late summer afternoon like any other during summer vacation. Being both Seniors in Highschool next year they decided a shopping spree was in order for the start of school in the fall. <br />
So like, can&#39;t we just go to Zaras and be done, you&#39;ve already got 3 bags and i&#39;ve got 2 i don&#39;t know if my beat up car will be able to carry much more - Alice giggled to her best friend, they&#39;d been shopping since the early hours and apparently even girls get a bit worn out. But not Jennifer she was determined to get that one thing that made everyone jealous. <br />
<br />
Okay how about this shop and we&#39;re done then Jennifer said as she pointed to the magic shop, You really think this shop sells magic? Jeez Jen I thought you was smart, its clearly just a knock off shop to sell crap. Alice said following her determined friend as she walked in the store. <br />
<br />
Jennifer Looking round the store seeing an assortment of everything from costumes, to monkeys paws, to broken clocks. finally her eyes settled on the jewellery section as she fixated on a golden ring which was drawing her in. <br />
I&#39;m sorry but this section is unavailable at the moment, some of the items here are .. unstable - A clerk said who appeared out of nowhere <br />
What do you mean unavailable? its literally there and what do you mean unstable? as in broken? They look fine to me, infact I was looking at this golden ring how much?- Jennifer said as she pointed to the golden ring at the front.<br />
Well that ring, besides being a pure gold ring, has the ability to improve someones life in any area they ask. But as I said all of this is off limits until we can fix the instability. The clerk said, getting a bit impatient. <br />
Wow pure gold, i bet that will make me look classy at school, that bitch Kylie will be so jealous when I&#39;m walking around with a pure gold ring Jennifer thought to herself. <br />
Okay like, I get its off limits, but cmon pleaseee I just want that one at the front. Can&#39;t you do anything for me? Jennifer said pouting, <br />
No and thats final now.. The clerk was cut off, HEY DON&#39;T TOUCH THAT WAIT he shouted behind Jennifer, Looking over in that direction she saw a man pick up an item which said do not touch. As the clerk quickly ran over leaving Jennifer unguarded she decided to steel the ring. Its not like its actually magic she thought to herself. <br />
<br />
Having picked up the ring, she felt a small burning sensation on her fingertips, oww what the fuck that hurt Jennifer said quietly to herself as she placed the ring in her purse and walked over to Alice. <br />
Well this has been a bust, I can&#39;t find anything i&#39;d want to be caught dead in at school, and half of this stuff is really expensive and boring. Alice calmly said to her friend. <br />
Yeah I totally agree, lets just leave and go home Jennifer said sliding an arm round her friends waist and giggling as the two left. <br />
<br />
Sometime later after having got into Alice&#39;s car and been dropped home Jennifer had almost forgotten about the ring, having dug through her purse to find her makeup kit, she felt the ring.  Inspecting it once more she saw it had some small engravings on the inside, some weird language she didn&#39;t understand. <br />
This will be perfect for school, slipping the ring on and feeling a small tingling sensation run through her left hand and up to her arm she quickly took off the ring and threw it back on the desk. Startled by the feelings. What was that she thought, she decided to put it on again to see if the ring was magical after all.  Having felt the surge of raw feeling move up her arm, getting fainter until the feeling left her entirely. <br />
<br />
So this ring is meant to make my life better if I ask for it she thought, Okay ring I want my modest but rather small B cup breasts to fill out to a D and I want my bras to fit. She said out loud to herself, thinking it was wise to add the bit on the end as it would suck if she had to pay to buy a whole new set of bras. Within moments she felt her top getting tighter as her breasts did indeed expand, slowly to begin with but sure enough after about an hour she had gone up 2 maybe even 3 cupsizes. undoing a button of her blouse which was about to pop, she smiled looking at the valley of cleavage. inspecting her bra she was now an E cup, strange I asked for a D.. I guess this ring isn&#39;t perfect after all she quietly thought. <br />
Wait will my mum and friends realise i&#39;v doubled in size overnight? I better go check she said worried how her mom and dad might react. grabbing a new top which would fit her new breasts better she just slid on a halter top and kept her skirt on and tennis shoes. She was going for that casual but girly look. <br />
<br />
Walking down the stairs, she called out to her mom and when she began asking her if she noticed anything different about her. <br />
&quot;No dear you look the same to me as you always have, though please don&#39;t tell me you plan to wear that top to school next week, I did not raise you to expose yourself&quot; Her mom calmly said while continuing with dinner. <br />
<br />
Jennifer finished up her chat and went back upstairs, realising that whatever this ring did also made sure reality fit around it. Oh this could be fun she thought, but what to change now? <br />
<br />
(bit of a boring introduction, basic rules of the ring it is an unstable reality altering ring which can improve or drastically do the oppisite of what the user wants, <br />
Example - Jennifer wants to improve her life and be a top of the class, ring burns(that is a sign its going to be bad) and it slowly does the opposite and she actually realises she&#39;s now dumb. She wishes to fix it by being top of the class again, and the ring overshoots, making her papers 100% and she&#39;s accused of cheating. Or maybe she does become top of her class, and then makes another vain request which backfires. The idea being every time it works well, the chance of a negative impact increases more and more and the severity)</p>
