<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Muxing was relieved when all the festivities finally came to an end. Though it would only be a short while before someone finds a reason or excuse to have another festival. Probably some other Catholic holiday. She felt that this year&#39;s Lunar New Year festival was particularly drawn out. It made some sense considering how auspicious the Tiger is. Next year&#39;s Rabbit shouldn&#39;t be as prolonged, but rabbits&#39; association with fertility and Animalia&#39;s horny fanbase, that would make sure that festival would be getting plenty of attention. The year after that would be the Dragon, which Muxing suspected would heavily involve the Dinotopians more than other species like the Komodo dragon or the seahorse. But when it&#39;s finally the Snake&#39;s turn, Muxing was not going to let herself be held back, especially considering her sisters&#39; victories.<br />
<br />
Muxing was pleased that Tuxing was able to claim the title of Miss Year of the Tiger. Muxing was expecting Tuxing to win, though Liao was a close second bet. Still, the two of them did very well and there was plenty of reason to feel proud for them. It was a little irritating that they didn&#39;t show up for the Mardi Gras festival that was partly in Tuxing&#39;s honor. Muxing understood it was because the tigresses had accepted a double-date with two of the runners-up for Mr. Year of the Tiger. From what she had heard, Lenard was quite a respectable gentleman and an honorable caretaker of his little brother. Wayne seemed more of a fool, but he was at least an earnest and honest one. If Tuxing and Liao had found potential candidates for bond-mates, Muxing was happy for them. But she doubted she&#39;d ever let herself become entangled in such emotional affairs.<br />
<br />
Or that was what she had thought until she received some surprising news. It was not much of a surprise that a new two-headed snake was being brought in for uplifting. Two-headed animals are pretty rare and not always long-lived. The complications from having two heads along with any other doubled anatomy could often cause the animal to die young. As such, two-headed animals were placed as a priority to uplift as the Animalian virus fixes the defects in their bodies that would have cut their life short. And two-headed snakes seemed to be the most common form of polycephaly in the animal kingdom. But what surprised and unsettled Muxing was that it was another Chinese tree viper.<br />
<br />
Muxing was asked to come and speak to the viper after the uplifting. She was currently at Heiya Island&#39;s hospital, which served largely as Horizon&#39;s main conversion facility. Manami was walking with her through the halls. &quot;Now, I hope you understand we&#39;re not just trying to set you two up. Or is is three? Anyways, you only have with them for a while, to let them know they aren&#39;t the only ones of their species here,&quot; Manami said to Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; said Muxing. She tried to conceal both her irritation and her nervousness. Just because they were of the same species doesn&#39;t mean there would be a meaningful connection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, you should know they&#39;ve been something...extra,&quot; said Manami.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you give the hermaphrodite treatment?&quot; asked Muxing, almost sounding relieved. Not that she had a problem against herms, but it could be a convenient excuse to not be involved with this new viper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly,&quot; said Manami, &quot;It isn&#39;t quite that drastic.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muxing would soon learn what Manami meant when they entered one of the changing rooms. In it was another Chinese tree viper Animalian like Muxing. But this one was clearly male. Because of the two heads, the shoulders were particularly broad which also also led to a large, well-muscled chest. Which apparently also made it easier to support the second pair of arms on the torso. &quot;Muxing, allow me to introduce you to Li-Wei,&quot; said Manami.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Li,&quot; said the left-handed head.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m Wei,&quot; said his brother on the right.<br />
<br />
Muxing kept her face in a neutral expression. Part of it was resisting the urge to roll her eyes. Clearly Li-Wei&#39;s name was someone&#39;s attempt at being funny and cleaver. Still, at least it was a name that made sense in Chinese. She also try to tamp down a treacherous feeling of attraction. The Animalian virus certainly gave Li-Wei a generous amount of muscles. She wondered if her breeding season was coming soon. She&#39;ll have to check later. For now, she needed to stay diplomatic. &quot;So...you have four arms,&quot; she said, trying to sound casual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the idea of having two arms was strange to use,&quot; said Li, looking at his two left arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, we&#39;re the first two-headed snake Animalian to get four arms,&quot; said Wei.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Muxing, looking at Manami.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a little surprising it hasn&#39;t been applied earlier,&quot; said Manami, &quot;But I suppose the four-armed variant is still relatively new. Not to mention the scarcity of two-headed snakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose the full gamut of variations has yet to be played out,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a variation of the Animalian virus that can give someone two heads,&quot; said Manami, &quot;Which is certainly something I would want to encourage.&quot; She quickly to Li-Wei and said, &quot;No offense meant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; said Li.<br />
<br />
&quot;It certainly would be inconvenient,&quot; said Wei.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll just let you get acquainted,&quot; said Manami, &quot;Please call if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what am I supposed to do?&quot; asked Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just talk with them,&quot; said Manami, &quot;We&#39;re not expecting you to do more than you&#39;re comfortable with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; said Muxing. She was not going to throw herself at the first male viper she met, let alone a two-headed one. And yet, a treacherous part in the back of her mind was imagining those four hands feeling her over. But Muxing wasn&#39;t going to give into her mating instincts just like that. Her wood wasn&#39;t going to soft that easily.</p>
