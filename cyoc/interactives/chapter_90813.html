<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You seem to be in a fairly good mood,&quot; Jenny commented as Clemens sliced his food into smaller bits. He knew he could easily swallow a whole chicken whole, but that didn&#39;t mean he was going to do that, and Jenny caught him humming as he cut up his chicken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... jusssst ssome good newsss, I&#39;d suppossse,&quot; Clemens commented, &quot;I had my measurementsss taken today.&quot;<br />
<br />
This took Jenny&#39;s mind off of Jason&#39;s latest joke and she looked over to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how big and strong are you?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only about a half-ccentimeter for my tail and the same for my head and spine,&quot; Clemens said slowly, &quot;Not very much... which meansss I won&#39;t be needing to re-ssizzze my wardrobe any time soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear,&quot; Jenny said with a smile, &quot;You&#39;ll be able to where your tux and look quite handsome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thankss,&quot; Clemens gave a shrug, and took a bite of food <br />
<br />
&quot;And if you have to shed again before the wedding...&quot; Jenny then commented, &quot;You&#39;d then look even better with fresh and glistening scales.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clemens looked over to her and raised one eyebrow, mostly a small bony ridge just above his eyes. It was mostly disguised by line of dark brown scales that separated the top of his head, largely covered in brown scales and the main part of the side of his head and side of his body, which was more of a dark tan brown.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I look good when I&#39;m shedding?&quot; Clemens asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not when your shedding,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Just after you&#39;ve shed your skin and everything sort of shines in the light. You look rather good then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ssee,&quot; Clemens replied, &quot;Well... that generally depends on whether or not I&#39;m growing in sizzze and the rate at which I&#39;m growing. If I&#39;m growing quickly... I&#39;ll need to sshed my skin and can glissssten for you... if not... I may not need to shed my skin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded and did accept that. Clemens being too big would be a problem, and as good as Clemens looked while his outer layer of scales was new and glistening in the light very handsome, she was relieved that he wouldn&#39;t need to get new clothing just before the wedding. That was good news, as if he did need to get new cloths just before the wedding, that would be costly for the tux that Clemens had planned to wear alone, but it would be costly in terms of replacing Clemens&#39; entire wardrobe, which to a great extent Clemens probably had to do after he initially transformed. The thought of that gave Jenny some additional thoughts over whether or not she really wanted to become an animal person herself. While she could wear a skirt  or a dress, while only minor alterations would be needed for her tail, if she were to grow one. But pants, shorts, and her panties would need either major alterations or buying specialized clothing. Most of this, she knew from Clemens and his own tail.<br />
<br />
While the Animatrix Serum couldn&#39;t remove Clemens&#39; arms and legs, it had had changed how his legs were mixed in with his tail. At first glance, it looked as though Clemens&#39; tail extended from the end of his spine the way George and Molly&#39;s tails did. But the tails of mammal based animal people were different from the tails of reptile based animal people. Clemens&#39; tail was thick enough, and since Clemens&#39;s vital organs were all in more his human-like torso, his tail was also more than strong enough, to support his weight. This actually meant that his legs largely straddled his tail. It was thin enough where his legs and torso met his tail so that it didn&#39;t impede his walking, but meant that his testicles and penis, along with his anus were all held internally and when he sat, his weight was supported mainly by his tail, not his hips and legs. It was why when Clemens had been beat up and his legs broken that he hadn&#39;t been crippled.<br />
<br />
Jenny knew that if she were to become a python that she would have to accept a similar position and accept the change in wardrobe. There were plenty of things that counted as reasons to take the serum, so even with the consideration over legs in relation to a tail and how her own anatomy would be arranged as a snake person, she hadn&#39;t fully come to a decision yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what did you find out about this &quot;Animalia&quot; convention?&quot; Jenny asked after a moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Clemens said slowly, &quot;cccertain eventss and activitiesss seem to be be honesst... but there is no indication that they would be part of a sssingular event. The ad itsself is well conssstructed, and I&#39;d guess that Jason had it professionally done... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a hoax,&quot; Jenny finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;With the way it&#39;ss put together... yesss,&quot; Clemens nodded, &quot;from what I&#39;ve found, the idea on equipment for animal people in law enforcccement is part of a national conferencce in Wassshington DCC being run by the FBI and variouss well known policce unitss... but that&#39;s a CONFERENCCCE not a convention. George Wayne as an animal person who ISSS in law enforcement might be encouraged to attend... but it issn&#39;t open to the general public.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;d bet the other supposed events are also part of either individual shows or conferences at different times,&quot; Jenny sighed, &quot;Jason only put it all together as some sort of joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Clemens nodded, &quot;but it isssn&#39;t outright malicciousss and we cannot prove he put it together... not without either his computer or information on who made it for him. For all we know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He did honestly find it somewhere online and printed it not knowing it was a fake,&quot; Jenny sighed.<br />
<br />
Clemens only nodded.</p>
