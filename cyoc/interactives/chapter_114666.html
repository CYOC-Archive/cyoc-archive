<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You got the understanding to basically shut up, and to ignore everyone except for Claw, but you couldn&#39;t help to think this was a trick of some kind. As you walked into the tribe with Claw a few wolves told you sternly to be their mates, but you figured that they were either betas or omegas because Claws growl made them back off. You definitely got the impression at this point that wolves were really sexist, and the fact that there weren&#39;t any female wolves wandering outside was also a concerning indication. When you finally got through the hoard of perverted, sexist wolves Claw ordered you into a cave, which had multiple branching rooms, and you obeyed and did exactly what he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait here, and don&#39;t move until I get back, and if any lower males enter tell them that your master/lover is an alpha got it?&quot; Claw said, and you nodded.<br />
<br />
Claw left the room, and you couldn&#39;t see what was happening, and you figured that you were fine unless someone ran up to you and raped you again. Just then Claw returned with another wolf,&quot;This is the one, you can see it if you look closely at the one to her right.&quot; Claw said, and the other male stared closely into your eyes just as Claw did, and backed off. &quot;It&#39;s just as you said Claw, but tell me how have you been treating her?&quot; The wolf asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I first saw her I forcefully mated with her, and when I turned to leave she just stood there as if she was traumatized. Then I walked back and saw the symbol, and then I went to confirm, and she got annoyed with me and growled at me. I then proceeded to explain her situation, and she needed to follow me here, she claims to also have been male in addition to human too. I&#39;ve been less strict with her all things considered, and our brief relationship is more cooperative than expected. I told her to act loyal when in public as to avoid any complications, or outrages over the controversy. By the way you may speak now female.&quot; Claw said <br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you always refer to me by gender?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s tradition, and you aren&#39;t familiar with our customs, but for now we need to keep your symbol a secret. I would call you by name, but even if I knew it, I doubt it would fit you now.&quot; Claw said <br />
<br />
&quot;What symbol?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I see she&#39;s talkative, it&#39;s no wonder why you had to warn her Claw.&quot; The wolf said <br />
<br />
&quot;*sigh* She isn&#39;t familiar with our culture father, but she&#39;s already partaken my seed so she&#39;s your daughter in law now. Anyways female this is my father Gash, you should become familiar with him as time goes by. The symbol we&#39;re talking about is in your eye, and it&#39;s an interesting mark especially considering the legend.&quot; Claw said <br />
<br />
&quot;I see you&#39;re feisty for a female too, by all means give the boy some challenge the next time you two throw around.&quot; Gash said<br />
<br />
You and Claw just stared at Gash for a few moments,&quot;Dad shouldn&#39;t we inform her about the legend behind her mark before having her birth more pups than she&#39;s already carrying.&quot; Claw said <br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know that she&#39;s carrying anything at all? You know that mating isn&#39;t one-hundred percent. Anyways I&#39;m sure we all have a feeling of mutual respect, so just follow me and I&#39;ll explain on the way to the ruins.&quot; Gash said<br />
<br />
You and Claw began following Gash, and Gash explained,&quot;There&#39;s a legend about a being who holds blessings of intelligence, skill, prowess, and leadership. That being is said to come from a human body, and transform into a wolf to guide the pack into a new age of prosperity. That being is marked by a wolfs paw in their pupil, and is said to pass on their traits to their young no matter what. There is also said for that being to come into struggle with odds, and enemies that believe that the being is a fraud, or would want to desire it&#39;s power for their own. You are that being, and your name is not certain, but I leave it up to Claw to give you one, but don&#39;t address yourself by it until others have accepted your destiny. I suppose you already are mates, and your pups might carry your traits and pass them on throughout the generations. But know one thing, the gender of the being has always been assumed male by most, I have too but have also wondered what a female leader would be like, and so here you are.&quot; Gash said, and stopped at a large wall depicting everything through pictures, and each one adds up to what Gash described.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see, but I&#39;m no leader, and if anything I&#39;d probably have a pup who is better than I am at leading. Besides there&#39;s also the fact that I&#39;m female and everyone I&#39;ve seen here is sexist, you two are debatable but everyone else is sexist. I don&#39;t want to reveal myself, but I don&#39;t want to hide either at all. Hmmmm... wait I know, is there a way to send a message to the entire tribe?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course why?&quot; Gash asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we could use it to tell the tribe that I&#39;m female without me revealing myself, and later if everyone is open to the idea, or is in a dire situation then I reveal myself. However for now I think I should keep my situation a secret, and act like a female wolf.&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s proof enough that you&#39;re definitely smart, and considering the circumstances that is an option too. I think that&#39;s definitely a possibility, so I&#39;ll think about it and if we come up with anything better we&#39;ll notify you first before doing anything, we also may want to wait a while as to conceal your identity too.&quot; Gash said<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s fine with everyone I&#39;d like to take Shade here home with me, and make sure her identity is safe. In other words we are going to mate again until you show pregnant signs so you look like a normal female. On top of that we can see if our pups retain any of your features.&quot; Claw said,<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, who&#39;s Shade?&quot; Gash asked<br />
<br />
&quot;She is, you said I could name her, and it&#39;s not a bad name like cunt, bitch, or slut. The list goes on, and the names just get more dirty.&quot; Claw said, and you nodded in agreement, and you....</p>
