<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric sat down at a table in the library as he noticed the paper sticking out of his pack.<br />
<br />
“What’s this?” He questioned looking over the page.<br />
<br />
To my new friend,<br />
<br />
You’re not happy with you are, are you? Here's a game to make a change in your life. Have fun! I know I did! Your new friend.<br />
<br />
“Wha…?” Eric gasped as he looked around in a panic, “How did this friend find out I hate being a guy? And what do they mean by change and game?”<br />
<br />
He takes a pen out of his pack with trembling a hand and begins the survey.<br />
 <br />
1. If you were a girl, would your handwriting be nice?<br />
<br />
He jots down: Yes. I have often been complimented on my handwriting.<br />
<br />
 Eric’s chicken starch started to become impressive, flowery, and girly before he even finished his answer. Taking note to his handwriting, He blinked a few times as his mind processed what he saw. Glancing around again, a grin spreading quickly across his face. “I…is this for real?” Eric pondered, “I can change who I am?” Any trepidation he felt just moments ago, had vanished like smoke in the wind.<br />
<br />
2. If you were a girl, would you like pink?&quot;<br />
Yes, It is one of my favorite colors.<br />
<br />
“This is absolutely amazing.” He gawked as the pen ink brightened from its red to a baby pink, “I can wait to see how I turn out.”<br />
 <br />
3. If you were a girl, would your hair be straight or curly?<br />
<br />
Thinking for a moment, he wrote Straight. Eric frowned when the only change to his hair as how soft and silky smooth it now felt.<br />
<br />
4. If you were a girl, what would your favorite color be?<br />
<br />
He wrote, Pinks, light blues and greens, and purple. His back pack flickered through the various colors Eric wrote down. “well, that was neat.” He commented as the pack settled on a light sky blue.<br />
<br />
5. If you were a girl, what color would your hair be and how would you wear it?<br />
<br />
“This is were it starts to get good” Eric smiled as he wrote: I would have dusty blond hair that reaches just past my shoulder blades. I wear in many different styles but to day its in a pony tail.<br />
<br />
His smile widened even more, threatening to encompass his head, as his flowed down from his head. As it grow it brightened to is desired blond shade. Reaching it’s desired length, his hair pulled itself into a ponytail as a scrunchy formed to hold it in place. Eric giggled as he played with the silken locks that now hung from his head. Realizing he just actually giggled. His eyes darted around the library but no one seemed to be paying any attention to him. He sighed in relief continuing the questions.<br />
<br />
6. If you were a girl, what color would your eyes be?<br />
<br />
“Hmmm, That’s a hard one.” He thought, “ I got it.”<br />
<br />
I was born with heterochromia iridis. My Right eye is forest green while my left eye is Caribbean blue.<br />
<br />
The change caused Eric to blink a few times. “Damn! I wish I had a mirror right now.” He pouted to him self.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. If you were a girl, what kind of skin color and what kind of complexion would you have?<br />
<br />
I have flawless, soft and smooth skin. I’d be a lovely tan from my time no the soccer team and tanning to prevent tan lines.<br />
<br />
He shivered as his skin tanned to a sex caramel color and any flaw he had faded away. Eric dropped the pen to touch his skin. His hand trembled as it touched his arm. The soft smooth skin he felt had him want to burst with joy. “I have to finish this ‘game’. The sooner the better.” He picked up the pen, smiled at his smooth tanned hands, then continue. <br />
<br />
8. If you were a girl, would you be sporty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes. I love all the activities I was/am in. Pausing for a second, “maybe I should list the physical ones.” I loved my ten years of dance, Cheerleading, and soccer.<br />
<br />
Eric felt tingling in his legs as they seemed to become longer, more shapely, and fill with grace and power. He frowned at the hair on his mostly sexy toned legs.<br />
<br />
9. If you were a girl, what over activities are you apart of?<br />
<br />
He tapped the pen to the paper in thought before writing: I’m in the school musical. (Mr. Smith had a hard time choosing between me, Eve Banks, and Jasmine Schmitz . We have amazing singing voices. Mr. Smith gave us each a part. We have fun at rehearsal being best friends and all.) I also play the saxophone and guitar.<br />
<br />
 <br />
11. If you were a girl, would you wear a skirt?<br />
<br />
Yes, as both my older sisters tell me I have to show off these great legs of mine.<br />
<br />
Eric winced as his mind is flood by new memories of his now existent older sisters. “I…I’m no longer an only child. This is great!” He giggled to himself. He didn’t even notice his shorts had become a pleated mini skirt that reached just above his knees.<br />
<br />
12. When you are a girl, how many siblings would you have?<br />
<br />
“Dropping the disguise, huh?” Eric laughed.<br />
<br />
Well, I want a big family. As I said I have two older sisters, Luna May Chase(24) and Sophia Ann Chase(18). But I also have my twin brother, Xavier Walt Chase, and my little sis, Alicia Abigail Chase(4). We may have our differences at times but we love each other dearly and are always there for each other.<br />
<br />
He softly dried out in pain as even more memories flooded in of his expanded family. As the migraine fade he wanted to cry tears of joy for his new found siblings  <br />
<br />
13. When you are a girl, would you wear high heels?<br />
<br />
Yes, but only when I have to. But I’m usually wearing sneakers or flat slip-ons.<br />
<br />
He watched as his feet became small and dainty. His shoes morphed into Skechers Sport &quot;Pure Street&quot; Sneaker with pink highlights. His ankle socks only changed size.<br />
<br />
14. when you are a girl, would you wear jewelry?<br />
Yes, I wear tasteful earrings when can, a bracelet or anklet sometimes, But I always wear the locket my boyfriend gave me for my birthday last month.<br />
<br />
A pricing pain rushed from his ears as they shrank and diamond studs set into the lobs. And a delicate silver chain with sliver heart locket form around his neck. He want to look in the locket but the need to finish the questions was stronger.<br />
 <br />
15. When  you are a girl, would you have any other accessories like glasses or hairbands?<br />
Course, But is all depends on the day. Today I only have a lady’s watch my mom gave me for Christmas.<br />
<br />
16. When you are a girl, what size breasts do you have?<br />
With out a second thought he wrote: I have C cup breast. My sisters envy my luck there, even though they are blessed there too.<br />
Eric watched as his chest itched and the inflated like he had two balloons under his shirt. She blushed as they finished growing and the urge to touch them tried to take over. “No, no. Not now. Not here. Trying to ignore them, She went on to the next question.  <br />
<br />
17. When you are a girl, would you be attracted to guys?<br />
YES! I love my Boyfriend Chet Thomson and the things He does we his tongue. A shiver of thrill and excitement ran up her spine. And don’t get me started on the sex. An other excited shiver. We both always use protection. As much as I love my mother I don’t want to have a child by the time I’m 18. <br />
<br />
18. When you are a girl, what kind of shirt would you be wearing right now?<br />
I have a spaghetti strap tank top on.<br />
Her tee shirt lost its sleeves and hugged the curves of her upper body. Its front morphing to cradle her breast and  show off some cleavage. Seeing this, her blush deepened.<br />
<br />
19. When you are a girl, would you shave?<br />
Yes, as much as it is a hassle. I love paying attention to my body.<br />
The unsightly hair she still had instantly vanished. The sight of her bare smooth skin made her giddy.<br />
<br />
20. When you are a girl, would you use tampons or a pad?<br />
Due to my activities I use tampons when I’m on my period. Which I just came off of last week.<br />
Her grin threatened to swallow her head again as she felt her rod and tackle pull inside becoming their female counter parts. Her hips flared out as her thighs and butt plumped up and waist pulled in. “I already feel so much better.” She sighed in relief. <br />
 <br />
21. If you were a girl, what kind of underwear would you wear?<br />
I have all kinds. But today I’m wearing a Light blue thong.<br />
She squeaked as she felt her under wear slide into her fine butt and hug her shapely hips. <br />
<br />
22. If you were a girl, what kind of bra would you wear?<br />
“That’s right I’m not wearing a bra right now.” She thought as she turned beat red from embarrassment.<br />
Umm…I have many kinds all of which are comfortable. Right now I have just a plain one on since I was in a hurry this morning.<br />
She felt a soft silky material cup her breast as they lifted slightly and pushed closer together. Look down at her breasts, she was amazed at how natural and comfortable that wearing a bra actually felt like. <br />
<br />
23. When you are a girl, what will your intelligence be on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being a ditzy bimbo and 10 driving the class nerd up the wall?<br />
Since I want to be a Pediatric doctor, I just love children, I’d have to say 9.<br />
The migraine returned with vengeance as her mind filled with knowledge on many subjects. She cries out in pain as she reaches up to hold her head in her dainty hands.<br />
“Are you alright, Miss Chase?” The Librarian asked as she placed a caring hand on Eric’s back.<br />
“I…I’m fine, Mrs. Hanzo.”  Eric replied with a smile a bit shocked by her new cute and sweet voice, “It was just a sudden headache.”<br />
<br />
“Do you need some aspirin?” Mrs. Hanzo smiled back.<br />
<br />
“No, thank you.” Eric sighed as the pain faded, “I think I’ll be alright, Mrs. Hanzo.”<br />
<br />
“Okay, dear. Let know if need to go to the nurse.” The librarian said as she returned to her duties.<br />
<br />
“That was close.” Eric thought, “At least I’m almost done.”<br />
<br />
24.  When you are a girl, would you wear makeup?<br />
Yes. I mostly use it to make my unique eyes stand out make.<br />
She felt her face shifting as makeup was applied. A new thought made her turn a brighter red then her earlier embarrassment. “OHMYGOD!” She screamed in her head, “I still had my old face! But Mrs. Hanzo didn’t seem to notice. I…I really changed around me more then I thought. Okay, I only have a few left. Lets finish this.”<br />
<br />
25. When you are a girl, what is your age, height without shoes and weight without clothes?<br />
I’m 16, my current age, 5’7” and 120 Lbs.<br />
Eric shivered as she shrank from her current 6’2” to her preferred 5’7” and the excess weight just vanished. She was left with a fit and trim and very pleading body. She Squealed with delight. Her personality becoming very happy and bubbly.<br />
 “Okay last question.” she giggled to herself.<br />
<br />
26. Final question. What would is your name?<br />
I am  Melissa Koren Chase.<br />
<br />
After she wrote her name, “If you want to have a happy life as a girl, pass this on to the next person. Boy or Girl, don't matter.”  Appeared at the bottom of the page.<br />
“I wonder if leaving it on the table counts?” Melissa mused.<br />
Yes appeared below the statement.<br />
Cocking an eye brow as she set the page down on the table. But before she could question what just happened the bell rang. Picking up her bag, she smiled to her self, “Yay, I got rehearsal now. I can’t wait to see Eve and Jasmine.” <br />
With that she hurried off to have fun with her friends.</p>
