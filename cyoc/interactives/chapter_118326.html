<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Author&#39;s note: The title of this chapter is a line form the song &quot;New York New York&quot; sung by Frank Sinatra<br />
<br />
Stirring from his slumber as he looks out on the Seattle skyline; Jack Crawford stretches as he yawns. Trying to force the sleep away from his head. The were-panther did not sleep well despite having a good hard rut the night before. Plagued with disturbing dreams of his mate Kenya bemoaning about being barren; unable to bear his cubs. Jack looks at the side of the bed Kenya is currently sleeping on and gently stirs her awake. Seeing her eyes open as the were-panthress looks at him; Jack smiles impishly as he climbs back into bed, his were-panther prick at full mast as he still smells his mate’s heat cycle coming on strong.<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
About an hour later.<br />
“Well that was a first,” Kenya purring as she enjoyed being spooned by Jack. “Usually I’m the one dragging you to bed for a good fuck. Not the other way around.”<br />
“I was feeling horny,” Jack tightening his grip on his mate; his member still inside Kenya and still spurting his seed in her hungry womb; “plus I had some awful dreams and wanted to rid them with a happy moment.”<br />
“Want to talk about those dreams,” Kenya thinking it had to do with Moon Lake and their flagrant disregard to the Elder Council. <br />
“No,” Jack rubbing his paws up and down Kenya’s abdomen; “that would defeat what we just had together.”<br />
“And what might that be,” Kenya purring; enjoying the feeling Jack is giving her.<br />
“A baby making moment,” Jack answering; “I want to start a family with you.”<br />
“Right now,” Kenya looking surprised; managing to untangle herself from Jack’s embrace.<br />
“I don’t see why not,” Jack’s tail swaying and twitching as he keeps eyeing his mate lustfully; “just don’t take your morning pill. Let’s let,” Jack getting up to embrace Kenya again; “nature take it’s course.”<br />
<br />
Kenya just growls lustfully as she mashes her muzzle with Jack’s. Their tongues darting in and out of each other; feeling Jack getting hard again as his penis starts poking her, Kenya growls even louder as she gets aggressive and pushes Jack back onto the bed. Climbing on top and letting her quivering sex hover over his pointed spear; Kenya plunges down on it, yowling as her body shudders in the orgasmic release. With hips grinding and gyrating; Jack thrusting as Kenya pistons up and down. Both roar and yowl as each orgasm in unison; taking delight in the shared pleasure of love making.<br />
<br />
********<br />
<br />
After a few more tumbles in the proverbial hay; both Jack and Kenya still in their fursonas finally sat down to enjoy a large breakfast. Prepared by the small staff that Jack had on retainer; Jack was absently listening to Kenya crack open her third hardboiled egg with a spoon as he sipped his coffee reading the morning paper. Smiling as he read front page story; an article of Frederick Parker’s arrest in Moon Lake, and several side articles detailing the criminal’s suspected and know acts. The were-panther turns to another page and stats to utter a vicious snarl; the page he turned to was an article about he and Kenya. The same article that Lance Knight’s reporter alluded to after decking Kenya yesterday during the Labor Day picnic.<br />
<br />
“That fucking asshole,” Jack growling with rage; crumpling the paper as he shot up from the table and stormed to his office. Slamming the door behind him as he grabbed his phone; looking through his contact list, Jack sees the number and presses the call button. Waiting for the other person to pick up; Jack steels himself for a fight.<br />
<br />
“How fucking dare you,” Jack screaming as he gets the other person on the other line; “I’m going to make you regret ever getting into the newspaper business!” <br />
“Well that is a fine way of saying hello,” Lance speaking; “do I take it, this is not a social call Jack?”<br />
 “You know bloody well this isn’t a pleasant chat,” Jack growling; “how dare you print those lies about me and my wife!”<br />
“They are not lies if they are true,” Lance answering bluntly; “and you know it. And before you start up about threatening to sue me to poverty and what not,” Lance speaking; “know that I don’t print a story without triple checking the facts. So good luck trying to sue me and all the papers that printed the story about you and Kenya.”<br />
“You listen to me,” Jack screaming; yet hearing the telltale of the call being disconnected. Jack flies into a fit and throws his phone at the door; destroying the phone as the were-panther snarls with rage.<br />
<br />
“Other papers printed that story,” Jack bursting out of his study; noticing his wife trying to read the article that made him fly off the handle. “Lance Knight will regret that,” Jack stomping towards the table; he was about to snatch the newspaper from Kenya when he saw her drop it from her paws and looking crestfallen<br />
“Why,” Kenya sobbing; “why print all that? I did nothing wrong?”<br />
“Kenya,” the anger Jack feeling being replaced with the desire to comfort his mate; “they are attacking you in an effort to get to me.”<br />
“But it’s all out there now,” Kenya looking up at her husband; tear streaming from her furry face. “My past,” Kenya sobbing; “my… activities. Now all our friends are going to know.”<br />
“I’ll handle this,” Jack hugging his wife; “we’ll weather this together. It’s just that elder council retaliating with my threat towards them.”<br />
<br />
“How,” Kenya feeling utterly destroyed; reading that article that reveal her past as escort agent Kendra Smythe, her husband being one of her main clients’. With a photo of her with Jack Crawford who went by the alias of Ashford; Kenya knew that several of her husband’s business associates will soon drop him as a contact. Overhearing how he liked to use the Ashford alias to burn those same associates while trying to help them and be supportive. A tactic Jack tried to use with Benton Knight in regards to the new elementary school being built in Moon Lake; yet only with limited success. Kenya knew this was going to be a difficult problem for her husband to solve.<br />
<br />
“I’ll think of something,” Jack trying to be as soothing as possible; remembering that Lance said ‘all the papers,’ Jack wonders how many printed the damming expose about him and his wife.<br />
‘This will take some serious damage control,’ Jack thinking to himself; ‘I might have to deal with likeminded were’s from here on out.’<br />
Yet Jack was unaware of the second half of the Elder council’s plan. Getting the Luna Brotherhood to pass the word along to the various secret were-communities; letting them know of Jack Crawford’s threat to reveal the existence were’s the world over. Jack will soon find himself with no safe haven other than his condo or friends to rely upon.<br />
“You better think of something quick,” Kenya sobbing; “once you’re rich normal friends read the article, how soon will they turn down your ideal of buying land in Moon Lake to build a home on?”</p>
