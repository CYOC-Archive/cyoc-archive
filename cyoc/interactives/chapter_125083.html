<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up one morning to discover that the sheets were wet and sticky. You have had another wet dream, and, like all of the others, it involved you being a super muscled giant. You knew you were gay, or at the very least, bi, but nobody knew. Not even Jess, your super sexy girlfriend who you had recently lost your virginity to. You looked down at your naked body. You weren&#39;t badly built, but you were nowhere near where you wanted to be. In the dreams, you had muscles that could put the hulk to shame. In reality, you had a nice tone and build, but wanted more. So much more. You found it particularly strange that after 5 years of heavyweight training, you weren&#39;t stacked like a bodybuilder. You could definitely lift a lot, it just didn&#39;t look like you could.<br />
<br />
This morning, a funny smell hung in the room. It smelled like sweat and testosterone, if testosterone had a smell. It wasn&#39;t like your normal body odor, it smelled like 1000 guys were running at top speed in 100 degree heat. The smell was coming from your window, so you went to close it. However, as you got up, you noticed your morning wood, and that it was harder than usual. Maybe whatever was causing that smell was getting you horny? You did have a thing for big, sweaty guys. you closed the window, but not until you took a few deep breaths of that intoxicating aroma. Even still, the smell lingered, and you enjoyed every second of what, in that moment, was the best smell in the world. Then you looked at the clock. 5 o&#39;clock it read. you had to get a shower in before you did your exercise routine for the day. So you pulled out a tank top and shorts and headed for the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Your apartment stunk of the smell, and you basked in the glory as you walked to the other side of the house. You stripped out of your sweat and cum soaked clothes and hopped in the shower. The cool water running down your hot body felt like heaven. Some water got into your mouth, and it tasted like nothing you have ever tasted before. It seemed like a combination of steak, onions, peanuts, and Gatorade. As if by nature, you opened your mouth and let the water come in. The flavors were all over the place, ranging from meat to fish to veggies and back to water. It seemed like everything you have ever eaten to build muscles. After what felt like a few seconds, but was really a minute or two, you returned to your shower, occasionally slurping up a drop or two of the water.<br />
<br />
After about a half hour shower, you stepped out and wiped down with your towel, which seems to take longer than normal. Putting it off of your mind, you put on your tank top, which was a difficult task, as it seemed too small. Now you knew something was up. You purposely bought all your clothes in larger sizes so you could grow into them. Looking down, your view was blocked by your new monster of a chest. You nearly fainted from shock. Your pecs were huge and round, bulging lumps of rock hard muscle on your chest. You flexed your massive pecs in a rhythmic fashion, watching the huge slabs of muscle bounce up and down. You stated getting hard again. you bounded over to the mirror to see what the rest of you looked like. And when you did, you were shocked.<br />
<br />
Not only were your pecs bigger, but so was every other muscle in your body. Your biceps were bigger than baseballs, your 10 pack abs were cut to perfection, your legs were bulging and shapely, and your neck was thick and strong. your face was chiseled and masculine, and a thick stubble was growing on your jaw, giving you a prominent 5 o&#39;clock shadow (how ironic). your body was also covered in a light coat of body hair, from head to toe. And your penis was huge! You had a reasonable 4 inch dick when hard, but now, it was easily over a foot long. The thought of you penetrating Jess with your new member made you even hornier than you were. You examined every inch of your bulk, getting quite hot horny, and thirsty. You poured yourself a glass of water from the sink and drank it within half a minute. He drank about 3 more glasses before he felt satisfied. Going back to the mirror he noticed he was even bigger!<br />
<br />
His pecs were twice as big, biceps like giant balls, now 12 pack abs, legs like tree trunks, and a neck thicker than a bucket. his stubble had evolver into a full growing beard, and you were now covered in a thick pelt of hair. Your dick was almost 4 inches bigger, and with balls like tennis balls. You flexed every muscle you could, and eventually were so taken over by the sight of your sexy muscular form that you broke down and jacked of to your own monster of a body. It took you a minute to get going, and then you sprayed a thick layer of cum over your wall and mirror. You sighed in relief, think of things. If you came to your own muscles, what would Jess do? You decided to skip your routine and head over to your girlfriend&#39;s house.</p>
