<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That&#39;s Emily. She is a resident slave here as well. Jen, you 2 should become friends quickly as from now on you both are room mates, well barn mates. Her role here isn&#39;t anything soecific actually. But mainly she tends to get the mail, clean the barn, and all of the general maintenance on the property. And before you ask, no,  she arived here with the scar already healed. She doesn&#39;t speak much about it, but the thing we do know is that it was caused by an accident with her old home. Something happened and she was the only surviving member. So Master took her in. That was about 12 years ago now. Just be aware though. She is the only one of us slaves who following the Master&#39;s orders is optional. No matter what she does, Master never punishes or corrects her. However she usally still does them anyways. She is a really sweet girl though. She just dislikes Master&#39;s, well, everything. Actually she despises him, likely because of his self-serving, &quot;king of the world&quot;, personality that he has. I do agree with her on that point, but unlike her, no one else is able to say their true feelings about things to Master.&quot; Explains Yuliya as we finally leave the car. <br />
<br />
&quot;Morning Emily, come meet the two newest slaves.&quot; Yuliya waves over to Emily, who happily comes over to us. However her happy mood does an instantaneous 180 the moment she sees me. Now she looks pissed. &quot;Come on now, I know how you feel, but you will scare  her if you keep making that face.&quot; Yuliya says as she begins introducing us. &quot;Anyway, This girl is Mia, she is to become the head hen maid. She will be laying us fresh eggs every day.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mia does a curtsy and formally greets Emily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, I won&#39;t say it is a pleasure to be meeting you, but I guess welcome to the mannor. Oh, and I don&#39;t mean that badly against you or anything, its just that us never meeting, means that you wouldn&#39;t be a slave.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;OMG you have such a cute voice!!!&quot; Squealed Mia as she ran up and hugged Emily. Mia was not that tall to begin with, but next to Emily, she looked like a little kid. Partly because of Emily&#39;s heeled feet adding a few inches to her beinging her up to around 6 foot overall. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um.. thank you???&quot; Emily said awkwardly, as Mia was still hugging her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And this here is Jen, she will be our new dairy cow.&quot; Continued Yuliya.<br />
<br />
Emily peeled off Mia and walked over to me until she squatted down so she could match my head&#39;s height. &quot;Looks like we will get to know each other quite well Jen. I live in the same barn as you will. Um.. are you still able to speak english?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She can&quot; answers Mia for me. &quot;Just as long as she isn&#39;t confirming something.  Basically if she doesnt have to say the word yes, she can speak just fine. Else she will moo.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Got it. Well, at least whenever that bastard isn&#39;t around, your life should be relatively comfortable here. By the way, what is your other roll? Are you a maid like Mia, or like a grounds keeper or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Im just a dairy cow. My sole purpose is to produce milk for Master.&quot; I say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats it. I&#39;m gonna kill that fuckstick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t, we need him alive to be able to undo the curse on us&quot; says Mia.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, but I swear that one day, I&#39;ll crush his skull beneath these modified high heeled feet he gave me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You really hate him.&quot; I thought Yuliya said she just despises him? This is clearly more than just that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hate him. He destroys everything he dislikes and all because his fragile little ego can&#39;t stand to see anyone who is acknowledged at being better than or seen as more importaint than himself. When my house burned down, killing my family and ruining my eye, you know what he did? He hired me as a live in servant apprentice out of pity and good will. However I found out the truth. He disliked how my tragedy took away from his spotlight since he won some dumb award that day, and my story was what made the news. So he took me in in order to take over my tragedy with his. I could care less about what the news says, but he used it as an excuse to expedite the legal papers of bringing me on as an apprentice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I knew he was a nerdy prick, but damn.&quot; Said Mia. <br />
<br />
&quot;It gets worse. I&#39;m sure you both have seen my feet by now. Needless to say, I can no longer wear footwear unless I put a large hole in the heel. But then the shoe isn&#39;t meant to be a heel and what not. I haven&#39;t worn shoes in over a decade. The bottom of my foot is one large callus now too. For the first year, it hurt to walk on more or less anything that wasn&#39;t smooth, flat ground. Now I could even walk on sharp gravel with glass shards mixed into it without any issue. Sounds nice right? Well in 3 days, that bastard is going to add an inch of height to my heel again. He does it every 3 years. Saying he is training my feet to eventually walk on nothing but my the tips of my toes which he will fuse together making my feet basically end at a point.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, damn. Thats kinda fucked.&quot; Mia commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;But the worst is what he did to my eye. Take a look at this.&quot; Emily pulled off the eyepatch to reveal a completely different looking eye. Instead of the normal white sclera, her right eye&#39;s was completely black instead. &quot;My eye was still salvageable, and only needed a minor surgery to replace the lense. But he went and made it black too. I look like a fucking demon with this eye, thus why I wear the eyepatch.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mia and I don&#39;t really know what to say. Master was apparently worse than we both had thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it Emily.&quot; Yuliya said while she was holding her forehead. &quot;I told you to not scare the girls. Listen, Emily has a rather unique relationship with the Master. As far as I knew, he no longer did these kind of things. Well, at least not until today with you Jen. But just give it a shot, for a few days. I think you will find it is much better than the image Emily has painted for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your right Yuliya. Sorry about that. I seriously didn&#39;t mean to scare either of you girls. And Yuliya is correct about him not doing anything like what he did to me, until now with you Jen. Idk what made him revert, but I don&#39;t plan on letting him get away with it either. So don&#39;t worry, the 3 of us will have a little chat later. And just fyi, he no longer can use the curse, or anything resulting from the curse against me that he didn&#39;t already have in the last 10 years. So I will make sure he plays nice. He actually is kinda scared of me you know. And because of what I did 10 years ago, he can&#39;t escape from me or get rid of me either unless he gives me the curse without a condition attached or protections from the curse on himself.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, I have to get back now, so I leave them both to you Emily. And do try not to scare them anymore.&quot; Said Yuliya, after which she pulled in Emely and whispered into her ear &quot;keep in mind that Hen has it far worse than you do. The girl can&#39;t even speak like a person sometimes and is on 4 high heeled feet, not 2. Plus her mind and body has been messed with significantly worse than yours has. The girl can&#39;t even eat a warm meal anymore,  as her diet is now just grass, hay, and cum. She is incontinent too, and is being trained by her best friend in order to shave off bits of her humanity making her more and more into just a dairy cow. And DO NOT ever, and I repeat, NEVER countdown to 0 in either of their presence. They will both cum on ths spot. Mia is still herself, and she has always been naturally a little ditzy, but she has these strange moments of genuinely surprising levels of intelligence. It is like she is always focusing on something andit is eating up all of her smarts to do it.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Understood, I can take it from here.&quot; Yuliya drove back to school leaving myself, Mia, and Emily alone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t I show you to the milk stations first and foremost so we can take care of you Jen?&quot; I nod a lot at her suggestion, even letting out a moooo in the process. These damn udders are in desperate need of release. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then follow me to our room, or and I hope you do not mind, but we will be sharing a bed.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thats the least of my concerns at the moment, just please milk me soon! They are really beginning to hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Mia if you could go and bring us a bucket from that shed, I will pull out a hay bale for Jen. Jen, the stand is in that barn right over there, just stand on the platform facing the open door if you could.&quot;<br />
<br />
I walk over to the small barn and find it to be quite cozy inside. It has finished walls, and seeing the milker, I get myself into position.</p>
