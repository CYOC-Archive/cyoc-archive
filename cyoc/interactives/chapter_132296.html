<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The actual arrival of spring was something that made many in Lyre and Animalia feel happy and excited. Of course, the fact that it took until close to the start of summer was a different issue, that many chose to simply look over. The coming summer meant that Nevada&#39;s high schools would be running track and field for school sports, and while Animalia enjoyed these sports with regards to testing themselves against each other, many also took some interest in cheering on Lyre&#39;s students when they had meets. A few Animalian families even filed absentee slips with WSE and followed the Lyre track team to cheer them on.<br />
<br />
And while that was going on, Brett Horne, Marcus Pennington, Joshua Anderson, Daniel, and Mario had plenty of other things to discuss, particularly as the UFC-A had their first official tournament coming up in the summer. The overall plan was to allow for all those who had the competitive and combative instincts to have an outlet for them so that they could get those things out of their system, but in a way that would prevent purposely hurting others in a way that they couldn&#39;t be treated for. If successful, they could use it as something that would help create champions and allow for recurring seasons and demonstrating that while sports like boxing, wrestling, and MMA were all combat oriented, it was NOT to try and kill the opponent. This had them meeting in one of the conference rooms at the Claw Coliseum to continually go over their plans and strategies for keeping the rules in place and making sure that no one got &quot;lost&quot; in the course various matches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... for an overall tournament idea... I think what you presented was pretty good,&quot; Marcus commented, &quot;it would provide a show worth seeing... as there is a lot of this that does relate to marketing ploys that emphasize drama...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Though, unlike Pro-Wrestling, these fights are REAL and need to be managed and monitored... and controlled,&quot; Brett spoke, &quot;which in some ways... we may not know for sure on how to arrange the tournament until we have full knowledge on who is in the tournament and where they are in terms of height and weight and natural abilities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus nodded. That was all pretty standard within any combat sport. While many MMA participants over the years all knew some form of martial arts or had a free-style form of combat that didn&#39;t necessarily follow any specific school but adhered to the leagues regarding what kind of hits were legal and which ones were not, there was still issues that related to size and weight. A heavyweight boxer and a lightweight boxer both would have the same knowledge of how to box, however the heavyweight, due to larger size and muscle mass would be able to take more punishment than a lightweight. In this matching them up against each other would be a clear mismatch that could only serve to get the lightweight hurt. In this he turned to his right to look at Mario.<br />
<br />
The male Pachycephalosaurus Dinotopian soon nodded in acknowledgement and answered in his present role as an athletic trainer, &quot;I&#39;ve spoken with the various martial arts instructors in Lyre and Animalia and have a roster of those who have signed up for the tournament. We have things arranged so that all competitors will have scheduled weigh ins going once a week prior to the competition&#39;s start. With that we can have all the schedules arranged for the UFC-A matches appropriately bracketed so that no one is scheduled for a clear mismatch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That will be good,&quot; Marcus nodded and turned to Joshua and Daniel who sat across from him, &quot;Which will then have things set for keeping things ready for all the medical care that will be needed. As we need to make sure that this remains a sport and that should ANY injuries occur that we&#39;re ready for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There Animalian good health is both in our favor,&quot; Joshua said slowly, &quot;I&#39;ve looked over some of the medical reports on Animalian anatomy from both Horizon and Horizon Light and it would seem that many Animalians seem to have strong immune systems that would give them a heightened level of resistance to most viruses and bacterial infections. That should be GOOD news with regards to protection when it will come to most of the things that would be the most communicable diseases... things like the cold and so on. It&#39;ll make first aid treatment a lot easier in that we can be safe and secure in that we won&#39;t be treading on egg shells as it were with regard to most mundane diseases. It would seem that even some of the various diseases that are known to cross various species lines are not as dangerous to Animalians as they would be to mundane animals, which will help...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t gamble on that though,&quot; Marcus interrupted, &quot;we can&#39;t just assume that Animalians will be immune to things and not keep things clean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Joshua nodded, &quot;First aid and other basic medical needs will have to remain important. That will keep things safe for both competitors and viewers. The big thing that we&#39;re to take comfort in that basic cleanliness and so on should prevent the real risk of any real risk of contaminants and plagues being spread in the course of any of the matches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which could well be the risk with any bout that could draw blood,&quot; Mario commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why any bouts will include five minute timer should any combatant be wounded that draws blood,&quot; Brett spoke up, &quot;and why specialized gloves, pads, and other safety equipment will be added for all combatants to make sure there is no biting, clawing, or anything that would be able to draw blood is limited. Any bout that leads to a cut our wound, Joshua, you and whatever staff you need will have minutes to stop said bleeding. If it is so serious that you can&#39;t stop it in that time... or you don&#39;t think you have the time, you have the full authority to CALL the fight and turn it over to the refs to judge the winner. And that will apply even if the combatant in question is still conscious and still wanting to go on. Health and safety is a big part of this. It&#39;s why we won&#39;t allow underground tricks and other moves that are either more sexual or are &quot;non sporting&quot; at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Joshua and Mario both nodded. Daniel raised one hand up to his muzzle for a moment and tapped his lower jaw for a few moments before he finally said anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll be giving the refs a lot of leeway,&quot; Daniel warned, &quot;suppose the fans don&#39;t like the judgement?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have cooperation with the Animalia and Lyre Police Departments, and if need be we&#39;ll even call the Rhino Guard in to do security if there is any indication that the crowd gets too rowdy,&quot; Marcus said firmly, &quot;Which I suppose is possible... as some of the emails I&#39;ve gotten requesting tickets have come from out of the local area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s also going to be something that&#39;ll be a risk for ANY sport,&quot; Brett added, &quot;all sports have referees and judges and all of them have to make judgement calls based on what they see. That means people will argue over it, but so long as we keep people focused on staying safe, than that is ALL we need to do in that regard. If fans fight over that decision... that&#39;s on them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may want to make it clear before the start of every match,&quot; Joshua commented, &quot;As we will having the cooperation of Horizon Light keeping at least one ambulance on standby should there be some major injury... and I&#39;ll keep in touch with every EMT and paramedic that signs on with regard to providing treatment for those in the tournament... but they&#39;ll still be stretched thin. We don&#39;t want to have to be extended beyond what can be done.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded to that as they continued to go through the business related to setting up the UFC-A&#39;s first tournament.  It was then that Mario addressed the elephant in the room, the Mesozoic Fight Club. Officially it was arranged for all those who became Cenozoic megafauna or Dinotopians, but so far, Project Mesozoic was still in a testing phase that only had it open to those looking to join through Project Phoenix and had agreed to certain tests to make sure that the process wasn&#39;t overly painful or that the new Animalian wouldn&#39;t find himself or herself overcome by instincts the way Heather had been. So far with better preparatory steps, those issues hadn&#39;t been repeated, but that didn&#39;t mean that Project Mesozoic was ready for the open market.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what will we do with regard to the Project Mesozoic volunteers?&quot; Mario asked, &quot;There are a few of them that have volunteered.. Walter... the one who&#39;s done the most training is Rachel Stega...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, her father was a boxer,&quot; Daniel commented with Joshua nodded beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I remember seeing her father box once, but that was a long time ago,&quot; Joshua commented as he looked between Brett and Mario, though primarily the male Styracosaurus Dinotopian.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen her train... and it would seem she&#39;s most interested in traditional boxing,&quot; Brett commented, &quot;but right now with so much of Project Mesozoic and Cenozoic limited to the testing phases and not officially open to the public, I don&#39;t think ANY of that will be ready until at least next year. As for the moment there aren&#39;t too many Project Mesozoic members that would be within the same weight classes to work with... and some of those that have become Dinotopians have had no interest. Rex&#39;s only interest out side of his work in studying the extinct animals and providing education on the subject is Tyra... for obvious reasons.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brett paused as there were a few knowing chuckles at that. While outside Horizon most people didn&#39;t know on some of the complexities that related to whether or not there was enough Tyrannosaurus Rex DNA in Tyra to allow her to breed with Rex Ramos naturally in accordance with Animalia&#39;s edicts, just about everyone knew that the two were seriously interested in each other. Brett had even heard a few rumors that the coming summer wedding between Jeremy and Heather would be a double wedding with Rex and Tyra also participating. Brett, however, didn&#39;t commit himself to rumors and figured it best to stay on things that he could handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heather can&#39;t volunteer due to her history regarding her arrival in Lyre,&quot; Brett than said slowly, &quot;and Jeremy... outside of Heather and his sister tends to get so focused in his work that from time to time he may even forget about other things. And they aren&#39;t the only ones. There&#39;s also Sherry... she&#39;s in the Rhino Guard and going through training. She may get assigned some of the security roles for the matches, but she&#39;s expressed no interest in the Mesozoic Fight Club.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve seen a lot of interested emails on people wanting to join,&quot; Marcus soon agreed, &quot;but... until Horizon opens Project Mesozoic up to the public, we&#39;ll have to wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think a lot of that is the fandom that people have for dinosaurs,&quot; Mario commented, &quot;they know that Horizon has perfected a way to bring them back and in such a way that the &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; scenario isn&#39;t likely. In that they&#39;re eager to restore memories of their childhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But until we have enough competitors... we will have to wait with regard to the Mesozoic Fight Club,&quot; Brett finished, to which the others sighed and nodded.</p>
