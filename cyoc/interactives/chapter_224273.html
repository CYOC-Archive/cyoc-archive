<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You know, Madame, maybe you&#39;re right.  Maybe I should from here after have the intelligence of a newborn.  I&#39;ve really screwed myself over in life and I deserve the chance to be free of worrying thoughts.  I just ask that you well and truly let me forget everything and just be a newborn in mind&quot; said James in a somber voice.  &quot;Very well, James.  You don&#39;t have to worry about memories anymore, your mind is incapable of creating or retaining memories.  You won&#39;t even be able to connect what&#39;s going on around you to how you feel.  You won&#39;t have an identity nor will you be aware what&#39;s going on around you.  I&#39;m sad to say that you won&#39;t be playing with toys at all since they are too complex for your mind.  What&#39;s going to happen is that I&#39;m going to give you the vision of a newborn.  You&#39;ll still be able to see, but everything not in your peripheral vision will be blurry.  You&#39;ll also have no ability to see colors.  Obviously, you won&#39;t have anger issues because you&#39;ll be incapable of knowing what anger is, but you&#39;ll still get to keep your special helmet in case you accidentally bang your head since you can no longer support it.&quot; said Madame.  With a swoosh of Madame&#39;s hand, a countdown appeared in thin air.  The numbers were first paused at 100, but then it started ticking down.  James didn&#39;t start to notice anything until the countdown got to 90.  At that point, his knowledge of how to drive slowly started leaving his mind.  By the time the countdown got to 80, his entire high school education evaporated.  When 70 struck he lost is independence as he was as smart as a twelve year old.  He started singing &quot;If you&#39;re going up the ladder and you feel something splatter, diarrhea. but that didn&#39;t last long.  As 60 rolled around, James found that his handle on simple three dimensional geometry and simple algebra was slipping.  He also took note that his knowledge on US history was also fading away, though not completely.  At 50, James realized that he had a diminishing understanding of how fractions work, but soon enough that was lost on him as the countdown struck 40.  At that time, James was feeling fuzzy with the concepts of telling time, addition and subtraction, and what the value of a quarter is worth.  As the countdown struck 30, James started to struggle with the concept of taking turns, how to count to 19, and recognizing shapes such as a square or triangle.  By the time 20 rolled around, James lost things that he wasn&#39;t aware about because he was strapped into his wheelchair.  He lost the ability to hop on one foot, throw a ball over handed, drawing shapes such as a square, and use three word sentences.  He also lost the ability to tell the difference between real life and fantasy.  At 10, the countdown slowed down, but still continued to count down.  James was loosing his ability to walk unsupported, drink with a cup without a lid, and follow simple one step instructions.  At 5, James lost the ability to pull himself up to a standing position.  At 3, James lost the ability to crawl and to sit.  At this time, James&#39; caretakers reclined his wheelchair so that he was lying back in it at an angle.  Normally, the countdown would have stopped at three, but there were three more numbers to go down.    At 2, James lost the ability to push himself up on his elbows when lying on the floor on his stomach.  He also lost the ability to hold a toy in his hand.  The countdown struck one.  At this time, Jim didn&#39;t pay attention to his vision,  He never noticed when it began to blur and take on a more monochrome color scheme, though there was still some very dull color left.  When the countdown finally ended at zero, James was a shell of his former self.  He had no concept of where he was.  His vision had turned blurry and black and white.  He could no longer remember Madame&#39;s name or even why he&#39;d seen her in the first place.  One of the caretakers asked Madame if she was finished in which she replied that she was.  She waved bye-bye and in a singsong voice said, &quot;Bye-bye James, bye-bye&quot;.  James in return paid her no mind.  It&#39;s not like he was capable of understanding her anyway.  He simply didn&#39;t care!  One of caretakers grabbed the handlebars of James&#39; wheelchair and slowly pushed him into the room while the other caretaker waved goodbye at Madame and followed through the cloud into the room.  And just like that, the cloud disappeared.  Inside the room, James started to feel discomfort.  However, that didn&#39;t last long as his body knew what to do and pushed a mushy mass into the seat of his diaper.  Instantly, his caretakers knew what to do since the smell of poo wafted through their nostrils.  One looked to the other and said, &quot;I got this.&quot; as he walked toward the changing table, unlocked the cabinet and pulled out a fresh diaper, a tub of wipes, and a pair of gloves.</p>
