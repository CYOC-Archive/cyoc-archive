<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex eyed his classroom, marking out the young men that seemed off but eventually turned to the board and began to teach, writing up with the dry erase markers as he went into his lecture. He didn&#39;t even think about them anymore. The good thing about history as a subject was it was pretty routine. He taught the same classes each year in the same order. After a few decades he could just ramble on without having to consult his notes.<br />
<br />
Which was good for him, because he felt off today. Not off in a bad way, definitely not a bad way, but off. He was a bit more exuberant as he walked along, feeling more full of energy and even had the class chuckling as he made a few stupid jokes. Maybe this was because he still felt a bit of that high from his workout last night.<br />
<br />
The classroom was feeling stuffy though, hot. He went over to pop one of the windows open. The old things usually stuck but one good smack with the heel of his palm loosened it enough he could slide it up. &quot;Can anyone give me the year..&quot; He went on, heading back to the board. His tie felt a bit too tight around his neck and he loosened it, moving the knot slowly down. Of course Kendall was answering the question, the kid was an overachiever. Even if the teen was looking a little scruffy today, a good deal of stubble darkening his jaw. Alex pulled off the tie, dabbed some sweat off his forehead with it, and threw it on his desk.<br />
<br />
Two of the young women giggled off in one corner and he shot them a stern glare. They settled down, one seeming to blush as she did so. Teenagers. He&#39;s been teaching for decades and he still wasn&#39;t sure what went on in their heads. As he lifted his arm to write, his shirt tugged across his chest uncomfortably, the buttons straining, only at the top though, it felt a little loose across his stomach. With his back to the class he undid the top few buttons, easing the straining on the shirt a little. The new v-gap in the top of his dress shirt showed off the top of pecs, short blond hair peeking over the top of his low collared undershirt.<br />
<br />
He grabbed a pile of sheets off his desk and gave each row a stack. &quot;Partner up and fill this out from the next chapter and the lecture.&quot;<br />
<br />
He sat down at his desk, looking out over the class. Surprisingly most of the eyes were still on him as the papers were handed out, then they began to break off into groups. Some were expected, Bryan and Wes, Ross and Diego, surprisingly Lisa tried to snag Kendall before Allison could. He had grown used to students dozing off in class, messing around on phones, but his students actually seemed to be energized, much as he felt.<br />
<br />
He leaned back in his chair to watch them, slowly unbuttoning his cuffs and rolling his sleeves up to his elbows. His normally furry forearms were less so. The gray hair was more blond than gray, though it also wasn&#39;t as thick. He only partially noticed the oddity among so many others. They was his shirt fit across his chest and arms, the fact that he felt like he needed to tighten his belt. Maybe he had just lost a lot of water weight from last night&#39;s.. exertions.<br />
<br />
Whatever Wes and Bryan were talking about in low heated tones, it wasn&#39;t about their assignment. &quot;Wes. Bryan. Focus.&quot; The two jocks nodded and seemed to settle down. When had they gotten so burly? So many of the young men in his class were. It brought back up memories of Chad. The trainer hadn&#39;t been the obnoxious ass Alex expected, and he considered their meeting again tonight. His cock gave a twitch in his pants at that, luckily hidden behind the desk.<br />
<br />
At that point Kendall raised his hand. Normally Alex would have gone over, but with the problem under his desk he motioned the teen to come to him. Kendall&#39;s clothes were fitting him a bit tight, he could see the way his t-shirt hugged his chest, and even the sweatpants he wore seemed to hug his legs a bit. It was a surprising look from the usually well-groomed young man, and the stubble on his jaw was something he had never seen before, it was so grown in it could almost qualify as a short beard. But it looked good on him. There was something about the rough, care-free look that seemed to suit him. Well.. teenagers liked to experiment with looks. But it did make him look older.<br />
<br />
As usual, his question was mostly just clarifying a point he read too much into as was a bad habit, but before he could move away Alex caught his attention. &quot;Is everything alright, Ken?&quot; He spoke in a whisper to avoid other students listening in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, professor. I&#39;m in excellent spirits. Why?&quot; Kendall smirked. And in that moment Alex imagined those stubble-circled lips around his cock, those big eyes looking up at him, he could feel the hot water from a shower running over his shoulders. He had to shake his head to clear the day dream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something just seems different with you today and I want to make sure one of my top students is doing well.&quot; Alex&#39;s cock was straining against the fabric of his trousers. He had to think of something else, but it was hard with Kendall standing in front of him. He could see the curve of his twin pecs through the thin fabric of the t-shirt, even the points of his two nipples pressing outwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t say there&#39;s anything particularly idiosyncratic today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, well, if something is bothering you, you know my door is always open. I also have a spare razor in my office if you need.&quot; After touching his face with a blink of surprise, Kendall nodded and headed back to Allison. She seemed annoyed about something. Though Allison was the type of young woman who was always annoyed about something.<br />
<br />
Off to the side, Lisa&#39;s hand suddenly shot up in the air. &quot;Lisa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I be excused to the nurse&#39;s office?&quot; She was looking furtive and worried. He had learned long ago never to question a young woman when she seemed to suddenly need to leave class. He just nodded and she quickly tossed her backpack on and ran out of the classroom, clutching her book to his chest.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Lisa didn&#39;t head to the nurses office, she ran for the girl&#39;s bathroom and quickly ducked into one of the stalls, hanging her bag on a hook on the stall door. She sat down on the toilet with the cover down and quickly began to unbutton her shirt.<br />
<br />
She was surprised no one seemed to notice the sound of her bra snapping apart, the clasp having given way with a pop that she felt more than heard. Lowering her shirt she twisted her arms to the clasp, but try as she might she couldn&#39;t get it back together. With a sigh, she pulled it off and refastened it before trying to pull it on over her head. The clasp snapped apart again. this time breaking in the process. It was like her chest was suddenly too big for the bra.<br />
<br />
She looked down at herself, cupping her breasts. She wasn&#39;t the most well-endowed of the seniors, but her breasts felt smaller in her hands, shouldn&#39;t they be bigger if her bra kept snapping? She sighed. There was no way she could walk around the school without a bra, but she couldn&#39;t afford to ditch today, not with that huge exam in Chemistry this afternoon.<br />
<br />
An idea hit her. She quickly buttoned up he shirt and left the bathroom, running towards the gym. She kept a book hugged to her chest to hide any embarrassment as she made her way to the girl&#39;s locker room. She started rummaging through the lockers until she found what she was looking for. A sports bra! Perfect. Unbuttoning her shirt again and slipping it off, she tugged the bra on, frowning down at her chest. She never liked the things, they flattened her out too much and this one did it so it looked like she had a pair of small pecs rather than breasts. It would do though. She grabbed her shirt and pulled it on, quickly redoing the buttons, though she had to strain to get some of the top buttons, but after a moment one popped free and bounced across the locker room.<br />
<br />
She screamed in frustration. What was going on? Was the humidity in the air shrinking her clothes? With a sigh she found a clean gym tee in one of the lockers and pulled that on. It fit a bit snugly, but it would have to do for now, just in time for the bell to ring for second period.</p>
