<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing before a full-body mirror, a young lady takes a deep breath, followed by a long, drawn-out sigh.  No matter how many times she imagines the upcoming interview in her head, she just can&#39;t stop worrying over all the different ways it could go wrong. It&#39;s a big, respected company, and she really hasn&#39;t had a lot of jobs before this! Heck, she doesn&#39;t even have much experience with interviews! After all, she&#39;s...painfully shy. Stutters incoherently. No confidence to speak of...<br />
<br />
&quot;...Come on, you worked really hard to get here. You can...probably do it!&quot; She attempts to pep talk herself, snatching the black-colored blazer from the chair next to her and putting it on. Looking back at her reflection, she just felt odd, dressed so formally...<br />
Standing at an average height, with an average build, she didn&#39;t stand out much - pale skin and a bust that&#39;s neither big or small, and brown, shoulder length hair and green eyes. After usually just wearing hoodies and sweaters, the suit and tie look was just...so strange. Heck, she&#39;s pretty sure she failed at tying the tie completely... Another sigh escapes her. But at least attempting to make a decent first impression is her biggest priority, so...guess she&#39;ll have to redo it.<br />
<br />
She&#39;d left in good time - maybe too good time... It&#39;s still a good while before the interview. Maybe a good time to ease her nerves? Without a big plan, she look around in the streets, parked near the office building. Maybe there&#39;s a store nearby that she could check out...? And sure enough, a small, curious one is just nearby! So over there she goes.<br />
<br />
Just like it seemed from outside, it was tiny - and pretty deserted. Heck, she didn&#39;t even see anyone working there, though the door was unlocked... Still, now she sort of felt like she was tresspassing... &quot;Um... Hello? Is anyone here...?&quot; She carefully calls out. ...No response. It was almost a little unnerving... Still, looking over the few shelves around, it looked like they just sold random, old stuff. Cheap-looking trinkets to stuff that looks just a bit too valuable to be stuck in a place like this... One such item that caught her attention was some...doll? It had no features though - it looked like one of those wooden, poseable dolls that an artist may use. Just...made of fabric instead. After looking over her shoulder again to make sure she&#39;s alone, she picks it up...<br />
&quot;Is this meant to be styled yourself? Huh...&quot; She thinks out loud. Though... As she moves it about in her hands, she saw...hair sprout from its round head?! Brown hair, the exact same color as her own! And then green button eyes, black and white fabric formed seemingly out of nothing to make a copy of her own attire! Understandably startled, she drops it and stumbles back, watching it wide-eyed as it continued to copy her look. Only now did she notice the paper label that hang at the shelf under it.<br />
&quot;This curious doll will take on the ap-appearance of...whoever it bonds with...&quot; She reads out loud. Bond...with? Picking it up counts? And how did that even make sense? &quot;Erm... Once activated, it will m-make...others take on that look too...?&quot; She continued reading, though...that still didn&#39;t explain much...<br />
A-anyway, she sort of just tampered with one of their products... This isn&#39;t good, huh? Creeped out and nervous, she slowly backs out of the seemingly abandoned store, just hoping no one noticed her in there... Though she continued to ponder that second part of the note, wondering what was meant by that... And while standing outside of the store, thinking, someone suddenly bumps into her! She stumbles a bit, and looks down...A young boy?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t paying attention!&quot; She blurts out quickly. Poor guy had fallen down! She crouches down to help him back on his feet. &quot;A-are you okay? Nothing...hurts, right?&quot; She asks. Luckily, he&#39;s not crying, at least... Though he gets up on his own.<br />
&quot;Nuh-uh, I&#39;m fine...&quot; He answers, followed by a moment of silence. Ugh, she&#39;s not even good with kids...<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...good.&quot; She finally says, flashing him a quick smile. &quot;Um... Remember to watch where you&#39;re going, okay?&quot; She stands back up, but the boy grabs her hand.<br />
&quot;Who&#39;re you, lady?&quot; He asks. As she looked down at him though... She could swear the boy&#39;s hair was short and black, but... For some reason it looks longer now? And that red t-shirt looks paler, too...<br />
&quot;Huh? Oh... My name is Belle.&quot; She tells the kid, keeping her smile. At least he&#39;s polite, unlike some others his age... Though...something is definitely strange here. He was...shorter just a few seconds earlier. Its like...he&#39;s growing?<br />
&quot;Oh! I&#39;m... Uhh...&quot; He hesitates, crossing his arms as he seems to...not recall his own name? Belle takes a step back, hesitantly letting go of the boy&#39;s hand. His hair...was longer for sure. Heck, it was growing before her eyes! His hips pushed against his shorts and his face seemed to mature. Though it actually looked...less masculine than before. Longer eyelashes, softer lips... His brown eyes brightened into a green-ish tint... Some parts of him were starting to look kinda...familiar?<br />
&quot;Erm... A-are you sure you&#39;re okay...?&quot; Belle asks, trying to keep calm despite the strangeness of this... But the boy seemed distracted, not hearing her question as he nudged at his shorts...not that they were shorts-like for much longer, as the began extending down his legs, their blue color darkening into a solid black. His t-shirt was basically white now, and along the front, a few...gaps began to form, held together things to...forming buttons. Along his neck, the fabric extended until it folded over, making a shirt collar. And with the sleeves extending down to his wrists, the boy was now changed out of his previous outfit, and into something formal. Something...akin to her own attire!<br />
His hips had pushed out quite a bit, too, filling his new slacks while his waist thinned out. And with his hair now hanging to his shoulders, a full brown color... It was almost as if Belle was looking into a reflection! A slightly shorter reflection, but still - even more so as the boy&#39;s chest began pushing into his new shirt, his face turning red as he timidly cupped the emerging breasts, thighs squishing together as something else seemed to have vanished down there...<br />
&quot;I, um...&quot; He mumbles shyly, only to look up at the lady he&#39;s now looking like. Realizing how touching himself like that must look, he hastily put his hands behind his back. &quot;S-sorry! I just... Uh...&quot; His voice trails off as he looks at Belle for a good few seconds of silence... And Belle was just as silent in turn. In fact, she was speechless... The kid was...her. A complete copy, Even whatever was missing of his outfit formed out of thin air, finishing the look...<br />
&quot;Wh-wh-why do you look like me...?!&quot; She finally blurts out loud, stumbling back in a panic. This was way too creepy! Her new copy, all bashful about that response, twirls some of his now longer hair around his fingers as he thinks of an answer...</p>
