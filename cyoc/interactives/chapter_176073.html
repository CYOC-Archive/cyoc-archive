<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As everyone either ate the pizza or were just getting done, Danny decided to go ahead and start the process of working off the calories. He wasn&#39;t content to just have a body able to play sports. He aspired toward the kinds of physiques he saw on Instagram and YouTube, the Jeff Seids of the world. Jin usually found it rather difficult to understand why someone would devote that much time to calculating calories and how much nutrient was in a specific food...but today he seemed more keen on watching as Danny readied his workout mat in the living room to get in some exercise while the others partied (in the case of the slowly changing Gabe and Terry) or just stayed by themselves (Jin).<br />
<br />
Danny started with some diamond push ups, eager to work on his triceps due to being told by his e-coach that his back facing tricep muscle was lacking a little behind his primary. Let alone his biceps. Danny went with a pretty standard 4 x 15 set, breathing in and out as he did his exercise. He was expecting to just get in his little workout and then do some more stuff around the house before the party either petered out or the girls got there.<br />
<br />
What Danny was not expecting to happen was the interest he noticed he was getting from Terry. The jock - who seemed now quite impressed with his own looks - now seemed to be looking on in admiration at how Danny was looking. Well, this was a pretty flattering top, he figured, but then he considered there might be some effects based on what transformation was going on. &quot;Oh, uh, hey Terry, what&#39;s up?&quot; Danny said even as he continued doing his exercises, tilting his head to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I never noticed just how jacked your triceps are!&quot; Terry chuckled - half sounding like a giggle at one slight point - and then shook his head, &quot;Man what a conversation starter. I must sound weird. Well, anyway, thanks for letting me and Gabe here party here. You&#39;re a really solid guy, Danny. Sorry if we gave you or your brother a hard time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was Danny hearing this right?<br />
<br />
These two...well, okay just Terry right now, he was apologizing. After all that happened. Was there something more to this? Danny breathed in between reps and when he was done with one set he said, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s no problem. Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m working on making sure we can be better friends going forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was of course kind of a lie, but Danny did not doubt he could get along better with a fully transformed Terry than what he was like now. Terry for his part just nodded and then said, &quot;You know, it&#39;s kind of funny. I&#39;ve noticed my face seems clearer now. Usually I have some problems, but I really like how it looks. Is your pool like, specially treated or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; Danny responded, &quot;Just regular old chlorine. Nothing special there.&quot; Now if he asked about the computer, Danny was going to have to say something different. Aw well, he thought with a smirk.<br />
<br />
As Danny continued his workout, he noted that Terry was watching him do his exercise, and pretty intently at that. It was kind of like those guys at the gym who just liked watching fit young guys lift and not really do much. Well, until Terry promptly went ahead and sat down beside Danny a few feet away, and started trying to do diamond push ups as well. It was he guessed something like imitation being the sincerest form of flattery...<br />
<br />
Somehow it seemed Terry was being much more friendly now. Maybe it was an early, foreshadowing effect of the sexuality altering effect that would come into being later. But whatever this was, Danny preferred it.<br />
<br />
Then Jin walked in, and surprisingly,  he was talking to Gabe about some things that were going on. Gabe seemed interested in some nerdy topic that Jin happened to have mentioned, and a single glance sent Danny&#39;s way informed him that Jin was confused and wanted to talk. Danny got up after finishing his exercise and led the way out, putting an arm around Jin&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Hey uh, bro and I need to talk for a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking forward to chatting some more! That stuff was surprisingly interesting!&quot; Gabe shouted.<br />
<br />
As soon as they were far enough away, Jin asked Danny outright, &quot;What is this? What&#39;s going on? The guys I remember as being completely insufferable are now playing nice as can be. And I notice my body seems...different. I don&#39;t know how. I haven&#39;t changed anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
I have, Danny ruminated to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Jin continued after a pause, &quot;Is something going on, some kind of prank?&quot; Jin seemed apprehensive. He was definitely weirded out by all that was going on. Admittedly, Danny made this plan under the assumption that Jin would be out with the rest of his family or something. But it seemed it had backfired. And now if Jin kept seeing them over the course of the rest of the week, he would definitely notice...<br />
<br />
&quot;No prank. No mischief. It&#39;s just a party, bro.&quot; Danny told him in a serious tone. His eyes unflinching, his voice completely even.<br />
<br />
Jin sighed and then nodded, &quot;Well...alright. I trust you on this, then. Whatever&#39;s going on, and I don&#39;t know what it is, I&#39;ll just...see what happens. See you around, man.&quot; And with that Jin went back in - figuring if Gabe was being nicer now he should enjoy the possibility.<br />
<br />
Danny just stood out there for a moment, and then got a message on his phone. Huh, he thought as he checked it. It looked like it was...fuck, it was the girls. It looked like both of them had some studies they needed to do, and got caught trying to come out here. Fuck! Well, Danny supposed this meant the party was probably heading toward its end. He went ahead and entered the main living room, looking around and seeing Terry (still occasionally glancing at his reflection) and Gabe (chatting with Jin).<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, so, our remaining houseguests for the party had to cancel due to studies coming up...&quot; Danny said in a disappointed tone.<br />
<br />
Gabe and Terry looked at one another, and Terry stated, &quot;I think I&#39;ll stay for another hour and hopefully learn a bit more about your gym stuff, bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabe likewise said, &quot;And I think I&#39;ll also be staying till then. Hang out with Terry and uh, and Jin here.&quot; Yep, Danny thought as he heard this be said. Things were changing! And he honestly couldn&#39;t wait until the next day to see how far things were going to go. It definitely gave him something to look forward to the next morning. As he was due to see the two on the way to school...<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
The next morning, Danny Yang got up as usual, got dressed in a tank top, shorts, and a jacket, and went down to eat his usual prepared breakfast. He noted as he did it seemed that Jin was wearing a short sleeved t-shirt this morning as opposed to his usual, and slightly tighter jeans. It seemed the transformation due to happen with Jin was working its effects already. Jin&#39;s body was improving slightly, and becoming broader in places. Warmed his heart to see his brother like this.<br />
<br />
After making sure he had at least 60 grams of protein in his school lunch, Danny promptly headed off to go walk to school.<br />
<br />
He was already feeling excited about the possibility of seeing Gabe and Terry that morning. How much they changed over the course of the night, and what their behavior would be like...</p>
