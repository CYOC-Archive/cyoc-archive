<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brad had long ago stopped thinking of himself as Brad. David knew that. He had held onto his name in secret, secretly thinking of himself as David. But he knew he had to pass his name on now. <br />
<br />
Brad was now David. And he was Brad. And that&#39;s just the way things were now. There was no changing that he was a 13 year old boy, that he had to work his way up from being 4 years old and reliving someone else&#39;s childhood, while he got to go and live the most manly life possible. <br />
<br />
You are Brad now, you tell yourself. And he&#39;s your big brother, it doesn&#39;t matter what his name is. This is the path he chose. But he&#39;s been out of your life for so long...<br />
<br />
When your brother comes home, it&#39;s late. He&#39;s bundling up the stairs and you can hear him from a mile away, like a big bear. THUMP! THUMP! THUMP! Mom and Dad are asleep. Your door creaks open. You put the book you are reading aside as the New David comes in, a mischievous smile on his face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, little bro,&quot; he whispers. He lumbers over to you, looming over you. He stretches his muscular arms. They are like giant hams attached to his arms. You gulp. It&#39;s such a turn on to gave upon him. He takes off his white cowboy hat and flings it aside. His T-shirt clings to his massive pecs and back. He peels it off...and it takes time for him to manage this. He lifts up his shirt and his hairy treasure trail obscures his firm abdominals. He finally gets one arm out. His pits...nice tufts of dark ginger-brown hair crinkling out in furry pads. You want to smell them so badly, the pits you could have had. He undoes his belt buckle. He&#39;s become a regular redneck while he&#39;s been gone...a massively muscled one. He has to be at least 250, you guess. And as if his muscles weren&#39;t enough, his beautiful dark ginger-brown beard gleams in the light of the only lamp. The room is dimly lit and you just stare at his massiveness as he flexes happily for you. <br />
<br />
&quot;I had a great time tonight,&quot; he whispers to you, dropping his pants so that only his boxers remain. He crawls into bed next to you and wordlessly pulls you to him, spooning you, your head gently pressed against his right pectoral. His massively corded arm drapes over you. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot; you ask, a bit nervously. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I went drinking with some of the guys. You might remember them. There&#39;s Cory and Donny, Brent and Mike. I hung out with them a lot my senior year. I don&#39;t think you knew Cory or Brent very well. I made a lot of friends when I became you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You did more with my life than I would have,&quot; you say, with a tinge of self-pity, maybe even self-loathing. <br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true,&quot; he says, reassuringly, his hot beer breath making your little dick stir. You want to turn around and kiss him but something tells you...he&#39;s in charge now. &quot;But you know, I&#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking. Why didn&#39;t you run away from home? You could have, you know. Or you could have gone on and waited a year and then joined the army. You could have fought for your body...but you didn&#39;t.&quot; He presses himself on top of you, and you can feel his heavy pec against your back now. He sits you up and has you lean back into him, and he props himself against the headboard. You are sitting on his lap now, and his gargantuan hard member is pressed firmly against your little pipe cleaner legs now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno. It was a confusing time. I regretted doing it. I felt so helpless and stupid when I took your body.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you weren&#39;t. And maybe our parents should never have made that decision. But my theory...is that part of you wanted to give me the responsibility that you didn&#39;t want. What was your plan in life? Did you have one?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you whisper. &quot;But I hated mom and dad and I still do. It&#39;s made growing up all over again so difficult. I just resent them so much and they do not understand that growing up as you is just more difficult than it was to be me. This body is naturally smaller. I hate it. I want to grow but I&#39;m afraid I gave up the genetic lottery.&quot; <br />
<br />
New David laughs, and it&#39;s more like a grumble. &quot;Well, it&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t work hard for all this. Here. Put your hands on that arm, boy.&quot; You get a thrill go through you when he calls you that. You gently put a hand on his meaty, engorged bicep. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, wow. You think you would have had the fortitude to do that? You think you would have built up all that muscle all by yourself, too?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, no. I was kind of a slacker in high school.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I played football all throughout college, you know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know. We went to a few of your games but mom always took me home before we had a chance to see you and talk to you. She said it was just better that way.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. We all made that decision kind of without you. And that&#39;s my regret. I regret not being the big brother that you deserved. I remember having so much fun in high school I neglected you. Dating girls, going to prom, studying all the time for college. I just kind of put you aside. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; He hugs you from behind, this big giant lug of a brother who you gave your legacy to. <br />
<br />
&quot;I forgive you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And you&#39;re really hot now. There&#39;s no way I can fool around with a kid your age anywhere else but I&#39;m a huge fuckin pervert and I love you, brother. I love my brother, I always have. So let me thank you for it. I want you to enjoy my body. You may not have it anymore but you can still enjoy it...&quot; <br />
<br />
You turn around and he slides out of his boxers. His big thick sausage is coming to life. He flings his boxers aside and positions you to suck his dick while he sucks yours. Electric thrills go through your body. You&#39;ve never done anything like this before! Between childhoods, you&#39;re 25 and still a virgin, trapped in a 13 year old&#39;s horny burgeoning gay body. <br />
<br />
New David tongues your little balls and holds your legs up as you suck off his enormous member. Eventually he tires of this and tells you to just suck him off while he lies back. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, little bro. You&#39;re MY little bro now and that&#39;s the way things are meant to be. I got to be big and strong and I&#39;ve made a big adult life for myself. Yeah. Suck that dick, son. Suck it. Suuuuuuck ohhhhh yeah. Oh you&#39;re doing a great job, bud.&quot; New David lies back and moans, trying to keep his voice down. Suddenly there&#39;s a shift. His dick hardens immensely. It&#39;s hot and hard and inside you, inside your throat. You can barely breathe. The stench of his masculine body fills you, the stench of his sweaty balls and beer breath is overpowering. <br />
<br />
Finally, his man juice squirts...and squirts...and squirts. You try and swallow it all and you can&#39;t. It flows out of your mouth and you try and lap it up, but it&#39;s squirting in your face, all over your face, and in your mouth again. His tough, guiding hand has held your head all this time, urging you to keep going. You breathe. He kisses your cum covered face and whispers &quot;Thank you, that was amazing.&quot; And kisses you some more. He gets you a towel and you wipe the stickiness off your face. He rubs your back and guides you to the bathroom. You wash your face and he beams down on you, this handsome stranger who was once your little brother has become a powerful fucking MAN and you want him more than you&#39;ve ever wanted anything in the world. You want to please him. <br />
<br />
He wipes his dick off with a towel briefly and then urges you to snuggle again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tomorrow I want you to come back home with me. I want to bring you to live with me for a little while. I&#39;ll talk to mom and dad. I think it&#39;ll be better for everyone.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; He turns you to him and kisses you deeply, and then you fall asleep in his arms. <br />
<br />
You both wake up the next day early. New David sneaks back to his room. He hasn&#39;t used it in years but your parents kept it for him to crash in should he ever choose to come home, when they stopped feeling guilt. <br />
<br />
Breakfast is simple. He announces what he&#39;d like to do, bring you to stay with him for a visit. You vigorously want to, telling your parents you are both bonding again and you&#39;d like to take a lot more time to do so. Your parents hesitate a little but they can see through the subtext. You still blame them for the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Even though, he&#39;s right. He&#39;s right when he says that you didn&#39;t want all the responsibility and thought it would be super easy to be a kid again, but instead it was just boring and sad. <br />
<br />
You tell him this after you pack some of your things, lug them in his truck and are sitting in the front seat with him driving. Your little bro Brad is now in your body, as the bigger brother, driving you to his house. Where he and his boyfriend live. <br />
<br />
It&#39;s a few hours drive. You talk a lot about all the things that have happened to you. He talks about different partners, discovering a love of construction and tools, eventually finding himself at just the right place and just the right time, and using a cryptocurrency investment he made (he was actually quite good at finance, as it turned out) to use that to invest in some new glove prototype that a company picked up on, and after merging with them, he had become a mid level manager and had a great job now. He gushed about everything, his tools, his home gym, his boyfriend. <br />
<br />
You tell him about summer camp, and the few friends you&#39;ve made. You are always impatient to grow up so as soon as you were old enough to read you started reading about motorcycles. You are kind of obsessed with them. You gave up a big body so you couldn&#39;t ride one again for like forever, but you could learn how they work, how they operate, how to do repairs on them. <br />
<br />
&quot;No shit. You&#39;ve been learning all that?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, from Youtube videos.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice! I&#39;m impressed, little bro!&quot; He slaps a giant paw on your little legs. He gives one a little squeeze and then pats your crotch. <br />
<br />
When they got home, they met Lance, who was an older man with graying hair. He was quite handsome, of course, and he had been let on on all the facts. Lance and New David had gone to the body swap research clinic to see if Lance could swap bodies with someone as a lab rat. He had never really had much of a childhood and his younger adult years were so painful that he was thinking of swapping with a hot stud if the body swap people could manage it. New David had been supportive. So far, this technology was only known by a few people in the know. And they still needed test subjects before going public. There was a public moratorium on any knowledge regarding body swap. New David filled you in on this while you two were on the road together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Brad. Should I call you Brad?&quot; He shakes your hand. He has a nice firm grip. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, we got that part figured out,&quot; New David brags. &quot;He knows he&#39;s Brad now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s one less confusing thing to deal with. So, the clinic called. And they have news for you,&quot; he says, looking down at you. &quot;They found a potential donor and they really want to talk to you about whatever happened in the lab. The doctor said to call back immediately.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll call him. Do you wanna get this little guy settled in?&quot; He slaps a big hand on your shoulder, warmly rubbing it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, sport. We&#39;re going upstairs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How old are you? If you don&#39;t mind me asking?&quot; You follow him up the stairs. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m 50. And I&#39;m trying not to feel it. I mean, I&#39;m in shape but nothing like the behemoth down there,&quot; he tells you. &quot;Okay, here&#39;s your new room.&quot; <br />
<br />
Your new room is spacious and way more awesome than your old room. All sorts of posters in glass frames decorate the walls. It&#39;s classy, though. The bed is big and everything is more expensive looking than your parents house. <br />
<br />
&quot;So is this your house?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it is. It&#39;s in my name. Your brother moved in with me and I fucking love it. All that muscle all to myself. That&#39;s my concern, though, is the house. I mean, if I swap bodies, I&#39;ll want to retain it somehow. I guess they can arrange that. So...you&#39;re actually 25.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. But I don&#39;t feel 25. I feel 13. It&#39;s difficult to explain. I can learn only the way a kid would. Any new information that comes in I can&#39;t retain it or make sense out of it unless it&#39;s with kid logic. It&#39;s hard to figure everything out all over again. I got tying my shoes down though, so I feel pretty good about that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How about jerking off?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I can do that again. It&#39;s a little sensitive though, and I can&#39;t cum a whole lot yet.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh give it time. Or if they set you up, maybe you&#39;ll be cumming like a factory. I know I want to.&quot; <br />
<br />
New David is downstairs still talking on the phone when you get back down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Yeah. Thank you.&quot; He hangs up. &quot;Okay, that was interesting. Can I talk to my brother alone?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure. I&#39;m just gonna get dinner started,&quot; Lance says, excusing himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sit down,&quot; New David says after he leaves. &quot;So...they saw the entire thing and they say we don&#39;t have to do it again.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well good! It was embarrassing. And a little hot.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just the thing. So...according to the doctor, he thinks that when you swap bodies with someone, you develop a kind of superhormonal attraction to them.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, if both of us are past puberty. Since you entered puberty, you&#39;ve been having these superphereomones, they&#39;re the chemicals are bodies make to attract mates or something. They don&#39;t know how to explain it. So we&#39;re not responsible for how hot we think the other one is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m cool with that...big bro.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come here, little man. I&#39;m really liking being with my new little bro again. I fucking love you and I never want to leave you again. But that brings me to the best part. They found a donor who is compatible and willing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?? And they think it&#39;s safe?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. They say it&#39;s safe. And given what we&#39;re experiencing, they want to make it a top priority. They&#39;re going to swap you with an adult and soon. There&#39;s only one catch...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>
