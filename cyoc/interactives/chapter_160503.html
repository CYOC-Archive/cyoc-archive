<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Freddy arrived at his campaign headquarters that morning, he profusely apologized to his staff for not having the documents ready for the deadline for filing for matching tax dollars. He gave the notes he had made last night to a lower level staffer and then had them fill in the rest of the details for submission. When he was questioned on this oversight by an advisor, Freddy explained what had happened that previous night, with the assassination attempt, the police cover up and the lack of evidence. Despite not having any concrete proof, the advisor suggested he speak up publicly on the events that transpired anyway.<br />
<br />
Freddy sent out a campaign announcement about the previous evening’s events, which went viral on the internet. The mayor’s team immediately denied the accusations, as did the police department. Most of the press dismissed his claims, sighting his lack of proof and claiming he was pushing through crazed conspiracy theories. Several neighbors reported hearing the gun shots that night and then a police siren near the house. The press largely ignored their corroborating eye witness accounts. Still, their testimony, which made its way online, gave credence to Freddy’s accusations in the eye of voters. The split voter sentiment on the legitimacy of the accusations saw a stern rebuke come from the mayor’s advisors.<br />
<br />
“Don’t do this again.”<br />
<br />
The mayor’s advisors sat around in his office, strategizing on how they were going to handle the crisis that morning.<br />
<br />
“Don’t attempt to kill him again” the advisor repeated sternly. “We warned you that this would be a bad idea and you nearly got caught doing it.”<br />
<br />
“But how did that man fail?!” the mayor asked angrily. “How was he not successful?!?!?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t have an answer for that, sir.”<br />
<br />
“Some great assassin then. Have the cops go after Fernando now with gang charges. His failure to do the job nearly cost me my campaign and my freedom.”<br />
<br />
“Sir, we’re getting off track here. You really ought to consider laying low on the murder plots for a little while.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still wanna know why he failed and where those dog bites came from?!?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re working on trying to get answers for that, sir.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, what&#39;s the latest on that neighbor of theirs, Tom?!?!?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The restraining order he filed six months ago against Michael is expiring in a few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, don&#39;t let the judge renew it and see if they confront each other again!!!! Maybe it can explain the dog bites and that ring he was trying to sell earlier in the year!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;We will work on that. In the meantime, why don’t you try letting use the other tools in our arsenal first, before you go off trying to have Freddy killed again?”<br />
<br />
“What possible brain dead ideas do you have left to slow down his rise now?!?!?!”<br />
<br />
“We have some ideas, sir. Just trust us on this.”<br />
<br />
The mayor groaned, before he agreed to hold off on another assassination attempt, at least for the time being. <br />
<br />
At Freddy’s office, while his staff worked to spread the message against the mayor, the candidate was preoccupied with looking for a security guard. <br />
<br />
“Freddy” an advisor said to him, noticing his boss was looking at his communication device “is everything alright?”<br />
<br />
“I need to hire security now” Freddy replied with a hint of frustration in his voice. “After what happened last night, I can’t afford to be unguarded like that again.”<br />
<br />
“Agreed. You can’t leave yourself exposed to such an attempt in the future, even if it’s just some random attacker while you’re out campaigning. I’m surprised you didn’t think to do this sooner.”<br />
<br />
“Michael said that to me and in hindsight, he was right. I just didn’t have a lot of money at first and then I got caught up in the whirlwind of the last six months. What happened last night shocked me out of my sense of complacency.”<br />
<br />
Freddy motioned for his advisor to look at his communication device.<br />
<br />
“I’m having trouble finding someone, though. I need someone who will be with me 24/7, but I can’t seem to find anyone amenable to working for me.”<br />
<br />
“That’s a big ask” the advisor noted. <br />
<br />
“Even just to work for me during the day, all the applications I’ve sent out have been rejected.”<br />
<br />
In that moment, the communication device buzzed. Out of the nearly 500 people Freddy tried to contact that day, just one person had gotten back to him. He recognized the name, but didn’t recognize the person. If it was who he thought it was, then he looked really different from their high school days. He looked even sexier, in some ways, as well. <br />
<br />
“That man seems like he’s interested” the advisor said, as Freddy looked at his profile carefully. <br />
<br />
“He’s the only one who has gotten back to me so far” Freddy replied, as he typed up a message to him. “I might as well give him a shot.”<br />
<br />
Freddy sent his message and waited for a response. He knew Michael may not be so happy about this choice, but frankly, it might be the only one available to him. <br />
<br />
At their house later in the day, Michael started preparing dinner early.<br />
<br />
“Why are you in the kitchen so early?” Evan asked, as he sat down at the table. <br />
<br />
“I’m making something special tonight” Michael responded, as he rolled out some dough on the counter. “A shepherd’s pie, with a homemade crust.”<br />
<br />
“That sounds good, actually. I’m looking forward to it.”<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to hear that.”<br />
<br />
“Thanks dad. Listen, at some point, can we talk about what happened last night? I’m still very scared.”<br />
<br />
“Later. I want to focus on making dinner first and then we can talk while it’s baking.”<br />
<br />
“Ok.”<br />
<br />
Michael continued preparing the pie, while Evan sat and caught up on his homework. About an hour after this, they could hear the front door open. <br />
<br />
“Papa’s home!” Evan exclaimed, as Michael looked up from mashing the potatoes. <br />
 <br />
“He’s early” Michael commented, as he stood up and walked towards the front door. “Evan, would you mind finishing mashing the potatoes, please.”<br />
<br />
“Yes dad” Evan replied, as he got up from the table to work on the bowl on the counter.<br />
<br />
“Nice place you got here” a man next to Freddy commented.<br />
<br />
“Thanks” Freddy replied. “Michael has worked really hard to make this place a home. I couldn&#39;t imagine myself having to be forced to leave this place against my will.”<br />
<br />
As Michael approached the front door, he took in the man standing next to Freddy. He was a big, beefy man, with muscles bulging out of the dress shirt and slacks he was wearing. He was beefy, but not fat. Some might describe him as a bear.<br />
<br />
The man had a full, but maintained black beard, that contrasted heavily with his bald head. Michael noticed that thick hair managed to poke out from the collar of the man’s shirt and out the sides of his dress sleeves. He was an extremely hairy man, kind of like his own father, who he used to describe as an ape. The face looked different from his father’s, though. It kind of reminded him of someone he knew, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on who it was in that moment. <br />
<br />
“Who is this?” Michael asked quizzically, as kissed his husband on the lips.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Michael” Freddy replied “this is the new body guard I hired.”<br />
<br />
“Chris D’Salvo” the man said, as he extended his hand to Michael. “You remember me? We used to go to high school together.”<br />
<br />
Michael crinkled his nose, as he still didn’t recognize the man in front of him. He reluctantly shook his hand, before pulling it away.<br />
<br />
“I may look a little different these days” Chris added. “With my bald head and all.”<br />
<br />
After a brief pause, it immediately hit Michael who this man was. This was one of Freddy’s former &quot;friends” from high school, one of the guys who made fun of him at Sofya’s house all those years ago. A rage started to fill inside of him, as he tried to restrain it while giving his response.<br />
<br />
“Oh” Michael said curtly. “I remember you.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Freddy angrily, gritting his teeth together, as he stared at him intensely.<br />
<br />
“Freddy” Michael said through clenched teeth. “A word.”<br />
<br />
Freddy gulped, as he walked with his husband upstairs. While they did so, Chris noticed Evan working in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Hey buddy” Chris said, as he went over to talk to Evan. “Whatcha doing there?”<br />
<br />
“Who are you?” Evan asked, as he looked up from mashing the potatoes. <br />
<br />
“I’m Chris.”<br />
<br />
Chris extended his hand, which Evan reluctantly shook. He felt unsure of this man, but something inside him made him feel comforted by his presence. Whether it was his warm smile or the gentleness to which he shook his hand, there was something about Chris that immediately put him at ease.<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you, Chris. I’m Evan.”<br />
<br />
“Ah, so you must be Freddy and Michael’s kid. Your dad Freddy hired me to be his body guard.”<br />
<br />
“Oh ok, that makes sense. Yeah, after last night, we could really use someone to protect us around here.”<br />
<br />
“I know, that’s why I’m here. At least, if Freddy can convince Michael to let me stay. Mind if I help you with that?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;d really appreciate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Chris assisted in the kitchen while he tried to get to know Evan, Freddy and Michael sat down on the bed in their bedroom. Michael glared angrily at his husband, before he spoke up.<br />
<br />
“Chris D’Salvo?” Michael asked bitterly. “One of my high school bullies? Are you fucking kidding me?”<br />
<br />
“Hey, Michael” Freddy replied. “Let’s make some things clear here. First of all, you’re the one who said I needed to hire a bodyguard today. Out of 500 people I contacted in the area, he was the only one who agreed to take the job.”<br />
<br />
“The only one? Are you serious?”<br />
<br />
“Dead serious.”<br />
<br />
“So let me get this straight. In a 200 mile radius, not one person agreed to take this job? No one at all?”<br />
<br />
“Not one person. Even people where the site I used said would get back to you in an hour never got back to me.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t believe you.”<br />
<br />
“It’s true, Michael. I didn’t get a single response from anyone else.”<br />
<br />
“Well, maybe you were using it wrong. Let’s go downstairs, so I can get my communication device, and I’ll try a few numbers myself. Ok?”<br />
<br />
“You can try, but I’m telling you, not a single other person is going to take the job.”<br />
<br />
Michael quickly got up and bolted his way downstairs. Freddy caught up to him soon after, while his husband was looking for his communication device. After he found it on the couch, Michael looked up to see Chris helping Evan cook in the kitchen, sizzling some ground meat in a pan.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” Michael hissed out. <br />
<br />
“Oh, sorry Michael” Chris replied, looking at him from the kitchen. “I figured you could use some help.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t touch things in the kitchen. Don’t do anything unless—“<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy said, as he put his hands on his shoulders. “Just make the phone calls, please.”<br />
<br />
“Is something wrong?” Chris asked, as he left the kitchen to join Freddy and Michael in the living room.<br />
<br />
“Yes, something’s wrong” Michael replied. “Freddy hired you without consulting me first. He said that not a single other person is willing to take this job and I don’t believe him for one second.”<br />
<br />
“It happens to be true, Michael. Peter McDonough, the local police union leader, has a lot of clout in this town. No one else would dare cross him to work for your husband after he passed around a do not work order. I’m the only person who was willing to defy him by taking this position.”<br />
<br />
“I find that really hard to believe.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t believe me? Call anyone else and see what they say.”<br />
<br />
“I intend to.”<br />
<br />
Michael pulled up a number and dialed it on his communication device. <br />
<br />
“Stacy Mann speaking” the woman said. “How can I help you?”<br />
<br />
“Hi Stacy” Michael replied “I saw your services for providing security came highly reviewed online and I was wondering if you would be interested in taking a position for my husband’s campaign.”<br />
<br />
“I’d be more than happy to consider the offer. What is your husband’s name?”<br />
<br />
“Freddy Benson. He—“<br />
<br />
In that moment, the woman on the other end of the line quickly hung up.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck?” Michael said aloud.<br />
<br />
“Did she hang up on you?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, she did. How did you know she’d do that?”<br />
<br />
“I already told you this. All of the former cops and military people I know are under pressure not to work security for your husband.”<br />
<br />
“They can’t all be under such pressure.”<br />
<br />
“Try calling someone else.”<br />
<br />
“Fine. I will.”<br />
<br />
Michael dialed another number, but it wouldn’t go through. Two people answered from separate agencies, but they all hung up on him after Michael mentioned his husband’s name. Sighing after the fifth unsuccessful call, Michael put down his communication device and looked at Chris angrily.<br />
<br />
“I can’t believe you’re the only person who would work for my husband” Michael said.<br />
<br />
“Peter has a lot of power, Michael” Chris replied. “Every other former cop swears an oath to protect the thin blue line. We don’t cross our brothers in blue and we stand together against anyone the fraternity deems a threat. That threat is your father, so they don’t want to protect him.”<br />
<br />
“If the brotherhood has such a strong bond, then why did you agree to take the job, then?”<br />
<br />
“Because I believe in your husband’s message and what he stands for. Freddy is a good guy and I want to help him with what he’s trying to do. I’m willing to take the professional hit because I want to make sure he’s safe and can succeed without threats to his life hampering him down.”<br />
<br />
“Papa!” Evan called out from the kitchen. “Can you help me?”<br />
<br />
“Sure Evan!” Freddy called back. “Michael, why don’t you and Chris try to work out your differences and then talk to me after that. If you can find someone else, great. Otherwise, please try to find a way to work things out between you.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went into the kitchen to help Evan finish up with preparing the shepherd’s pie. <br />
<br />
“Michael?” Chris asked. “Can we talk?”<br />
<br />
“What is there to talk about?” Michael asked bitterly, as he sat down on the couch in the living room.<br />
<br />
Chris went to sit next to him, but was stopped by Michael’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Don’t” Michael demanded. <br />
<br />
“Fine” Chris replied, as he held out in hands in resignation. “I don’t mind standing, though I don’t think it’s a very good way to try to get to know each other.”<br />
<br />
“What is there to get to know? You were an asshole in high school. You said that Freddy was too good for me and that I was a loser freak. You hung around with Daniel and the other mean kids in school. You were a jerk. Why would I want to open up my home, and my husband, to someone who treated me so poorly in my formative years?”<br />
<br />
“Michael, you may not believe this, but I’m a changed man now. The kid I was in high school is not who I am today. I consider myself to be kind, sensitive and an upstanding kind of guy. I care about people and do my job with empathy and sensitivity to people’s needs. I’m not a jerk and I wouldn’t even think of doing anything to upset you while I’m here. Establish whatever boundaries you want and I promise you I will honor all of them.”<br />
<br />
“What even makes you qualified to be doing this job in the first place?”<br />
<br />
“Well, if you want to know my background, after high school, I enrolled in the army. I served our country for about four years, getting us through a tough war, before I was allowed to return to civilian life. I went to school for four years, but admittedly was never a really good student. I graduated with a business degree, but couldn&#39;t get a job in my field. <br />
<br />
“Knowing I didn’t really have any other skills, I signed up to be a cop and worked in this town for about ten years. During that time, I noticed a lot of the problems your husband has brought up in this campaign. These guys are brainwashed and really have this us vs them mentality that I never shared. I was never a go along to get along sort of guy, so they kind of iced me out. <br />
<br />
“In the ten years I worked there, I never got a promotion. I was stuck working with a bunch of rookies, while the guys I joined the force with made their way up the ranks. Seeing the writing on the wall, I quit and have been working freelance for about two years now.”<br />
<br />
“Any wife and kids?”<br />
<br />
“Not that it’s any of your business, but no. I had a long term girlfriend for about eight years. Even though I loved her dearly, she never seemed ready to make the commitment to settle down in marriage. She and I broke up just after I quit the police force, as she didn’t like me losing the steady paycheck I got. I haven’t really been dating anyone lately, since this line of work keeps me so busy.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry to hear that.”<br />
<br />
“Eh, that’s how life works. But this is getting too personal for my comfort. Let’s get back to you and my job working for your husband. I want to try to make sure you are comfortable with me, especially since I’m going to be living with you guys for a few weeks.”<br />
<br />
“You what?!?!?! Freddy!!!!!!”<br />
<br />
Hearing Michael’s booming voice, Freddy ran out of the kitchen and went to see his husband turning red in the face.<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong Michael?” Freddy asked nervously. “Is everything ok?”<br />
<br />
“Upstairs! Now!”<br />
<br />
“Michael—“<br />
<br />
“Upstairs!”<br />
<br />
Freddy sighed, as Michael stormed up the stairs. <br />
<br />
“Want me to come up with you?” Chris asked, trying to be helpful.<br />
<br />
“I think you should stay down here and help Evan put the pie in the oven” Freddy replied honestly. <br />
<br />
“Sure thing.”<br />
<br />
Freddy went upstairs to his bedroom, while Chris assisted Evan with preparing to bake the pie in the oven. Once Freddy entered his bedroom, Michael screamed at him loudly.<br />
<br />
“Are you fucking kidding me?!?!? He’s going to live with us now too!?!?!?”<br />
<br />
“Michael” Freddy replied. “How did you think he was going to protect us if he’s not living in the house with us at night?”<br />
<br />
“You had the hots for him in high school!”<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“It’s bad enough that he’s the only person who will take this job, considering what an asshole he was to me in high school, but to have him sharing my living space too? Sharing my home? My bathroom? Freddy, you used to have the hots for this dude. I don’t want someone you were, and probably still are, lusting over living in my house.”<br />
<br />
“Our house” Freddy corrected, as he planted a series of kisses on Michael’s cheek.<br />
<br />
“Whatever.”<br />
<br />
“Not whatever. It’s an important distinction. You and I share our home together.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t need a talk about semantics right now.”<br />
<br />
“It’s not a semantics talk. It’s saying that we are a couple and are in this together. Nothing is going to come between that. Not even Chris. He’s here to make sure you and I are safe so we can be together. It was your idea to hire somebody after all.”<br />
<br />
“I expected that somebody to be someone other than Chris.”<br />
<br />
“Well, it’s either him or no one. Those are our choices here. I think we should keep him, but you get to make the final decision. Since it was your idea to hire someone, you should be happy with whoever we choose.”<br />
<br />
“Argh.”<br />
<br />
Michael let out a series of grunts. He wasn’t sure what to do in this moment. <br />
<br />
“If it’ll make you feel better” Freddy said, trying to be reassuring “you should know that Chris is straight. Nothing is going to happen between the two of us. If anything, his man musk might make me hornier, so we can have better and more frequent sex.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want you thinking about Chris while you fuck me” Michael said.<br />
<br />
“Ok, then I won’t.”<br />
<br />
Freddy continued to kiss Michael, hoping to cheer him up. After a few minutes, a knock could be heard on the door.<br />
<br />
“Come out guys” Evan said from the other side of the door. “Dinner is almost ready.”<br />
<br />
Michael sighed, as he tried to get up, before Freddy held his arm out to stop him.<br />
<br />
“Before we go down there” Freddy said “I want you to tell me what your decision is on Chris. Does he get to stay with us or am I kicking him out?”<br />
<br />
Michael thought for a minute, while Freddy looked at him, with a relatively neutral expression on his face. Finally, Michael sighed and looked at Freddy, who was anxiously waiting for his answer.<br />
<br />
“He can stay” Michael replied. “For now, he can stay. However, any sign of horniness or funny business between the two of you of any kind and he’s out on the street. Understand me?”<br />
<br />
Freddy kissed Michael on the lips, before they got up and made their way downstairs. When they arrived in the kitchen, they could see Chris taking the shepherd’s pie out of the oven, wearing mitts as he did so.<br />
<br />
“Oh there you guys are” Chris said, as he placed the pan onto a cooling rack. “Dinner is ready. Want me to slice you guys up some food?”<br />
<br />
“Sure” Freddy replied happily.<br />
<br />
Michael, not in the mood to speak, simply nodded his head. He sat down at the kitchen table with Freddy and Evan, while Chris served them slices of shepherd’s pie from the pan. <br />
<br />
“Since I’m a guest in your home and on your payroll now” Chris said, as he served out the meal “it’s the least I can do to show my appreciation and say thanks for the job.”<br />
<br />
“He’s really cool, dad” Evan said, as he began to dig into his meal. “He was telling me all about his time in the army and all the combat he saw. He’s awesome.”<br />
<br />
Chris chuckled, as he served himself a slice and then sat down at the table to join them. Michael looked at him warily, while his husband and son were digging into their meal. <br />
<br />
“This food is really good, Chris” Freddy said, as he happily dug into the meal. <br />
<br />
“Heh thanks” Chris replied. “My years of cooking in the army have paid off for me over the years. My ex girlfriend never complained.”<br />
<br />
Michael reluctantly took his fork and placed some of the pie in his mouth. As he was chewing it, he had to admit that it was actually precent decent.<br />
<br />
“You know” Michael said, after he finished a bite “I made the crust and the potatoes. Still, Chris didn’t screw up the meat and vegetables too badly.”<br />
<br />
Chris frowned a bit, as Freddy kissed Michael on the cheeks. <br />
<br />
“Thanks Michael for starting the meal” Freddy said, trying to be diplomatic. “And thank you Chris for making the meat and baking it in the oven. You both did a great job in the kitchen today.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t mention it” Michael replied, as he kept on eating.<br />
<br />
Chris, not wanting to further ruin the mood, ignored Michael’s slight against him and kept on eating from his plate. When they were done, he got up from the table with his dishes in his hand.<br />
<br />
“Let me load up the dishwasher for you guys” Chris offered, as he grabbed the other plates from the table.<br />
<br />
“Thanks Chris” Freddy replied. <br />
<br />
“You’re a big help around here” Evan added. “Too bad you can’t just stay home with me and dad all day.”<br />
<br />
“I work for your dad” Chris said. “Remember?”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah, about that. Freddy is technically my papa and Michael is my dad.”<br />
<br />
“Ah ok. Good to know. Thanks for clearing that up.”<br />
<br />
Michael got up and made his way to the living room. As Freddy helped Chris clean and load up the dishwasher, Evan sat down next to his dad on the couch.<br />
<br />
“What’s the matter?” Evan asked. <br />
<br />
Michael sighed, as he looked at his son with a bit of sadness visible in his facial features. <br />
<br />
“To be honest” he replied “I’m not totally crazy about the idea of Chris working for your papa.”<br />
<br />
“Why not? Chris seems like a cool guy. Papa seems to like him a lot, too.”<br />
<br />
“Well, Evan, Chris was kind of a bully in high school. You know those mean kids you deal with?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah?”<br />
<br />
“Well, Chris was one of those mean kids for me. He was always picking on me and tearing me down. It really hurt, as you should know, seeing as you’re dealing with this stuff yourself.”<br />
<br />
“That’s not good dad, but Chris isn’t like that. At least, maybe he’s not like that anymore. I usually can read people pretty well, dad, and Chris seems like a genuinely nice guy. Maybe he was a mean kid when you were growing up, but perhaps he changed over the years. If Chris was like the bullies I deal with at school and he’s become a better person now, then that kind of gives me hope, actually.”<br />
<br />
“Huh? How so?”<br />
<br />
“Well, if the bullies in school turn out to be like Chris, then perhaps they’ll be ok in the end. Maybe Chris can talk to them sometime. That would be an immense to me help if he did, especially since he’s such a strong, tough guy. The bullies wouldn’t dare pick on someone like him.”<br />
<br />
Evan laughed, as Chris walked into the living room.<br />
<br />
“What you laughing about, kid?” Chris asked.<br />
<br />
“I was saying to dad that the bullies I deal with in school wouldn’t mess with a dude like you” Evan responded. “Dad was saying you were a mean kid in school.”<br />
<br />
Chris’s face turned serious, as he sat down beside Michael on the couch.<br />
<br />
“Your dad is right, Evan. I was a very mean kid in high school. I said and did some bad things to him when we were growing up, things I&#39;m not proud of. I&#39;d like you and your dad to know that I’m not that person anymore. I grew up and changed a lot over the years. I’m hoping that your dad gives me the chance to prove myself to him. I want to show him that I’m a different person now and one he can count on to protect you guys.”<br />
<br />
Michael looked at Chris, with a pained expression on his face. Sighing, he spoke up with his decision on Chris&#39; employment. <br />
<br />
“I kind of determined we don’t really have another choice at the moment” Michael said to Chris. “You can stay with us and protect Freddy for now. However, if you mess up or I find someone else I prefer, you’re out. Understand me?”<br />
<br />
Chris nodded, looking to give Michael a hug, but hesitating in doing so. Not given the chance to show any affection, he watched as Michael got up and met Freddy in the kitchen. <br />
<br />
“Did you let him know?” Freddy asked, as he finished cleaning the pie pan. <br />
<br />
“I did” Michael replied, as he looked at Evan smiling and laughing with Chris. “You know, maybe Chris has changed after all this time. Evan is a pretty good judge of character and he seems to be getting along with him really well. Maybe if he’s taking to him, then perhaps that’s a good sign.<br />
<br />
Freddy kissed Michael, as he took the leftovers and placed them in the fridge. <br />
<br />
“He’s a good cook too” Freddy noted.<br />
<br />
“Just don’t get used to him doing that every night” Michael replied. “That’s my job. His job is to protect you and protect us.”<br />
<br />
Freddy kissed Michael again, before he joined Chris and Evan on the couch. While the three of them laughed and talked, Michael excused himself to his room. He wasn’t sure whether having Chris in the house was a good idea, but the signs were positive so far. Evan took to him immediately, Freddy was in a better mood and Chris’ presence seemed to ease a burden that was on all of their shoulders. He almost served as a third dad in the household, helping in some ways to keep the peace.<br />
<br />
Still, Michael had his reservations. Chris was still his former high school bully and he’d need to do a lot of work to prove himself that he was a changed man. He would have many opportunities to do so in the next few weeks. In this critical time in Freddy and Michael’s lives, Chris would either keep them alive or fail in his duties to do so. Michael hoped that Chris would be the thing that would save his husband’s life…and perhaps his marriage as well.<br />
<br />
The next day….</p>
