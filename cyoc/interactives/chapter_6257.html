<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Beldazzar floated onto the bench, thoughtfully stroking his chin.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Drake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Drake, I was just considering that you are a rare sort of man.  Not many would use their wishes selflessly.&quot;  The Djinn said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel sorry for Tom and I wanted to help out.  Thing is, I also sort of feel sorry for Bear too.&quot;  Drake said with a thoughtful frown.<br />
<br />
&quot;A man as compassionate as you are truly is rare.  I have had masters that cared nothing for their fellow man and what they commanded me to do was truly terrible.  However, we Djinn have certain parameters within which we must work.  If a wish is worded with the slightest loophole, we may exploit it if we wish.  With you Drake, I do not feel the need to do so, with some of my more tyrannical masters, I interpreted their words in a multitude of ways and chose the interpretation that would punish them most justly.  Some of my brethren are not as 'kindly' as I am and take a perverse delight in sticking to the letter, rather than the spirit, of what is wished for.&quot;  The Djinn said, &quot;However, Drake, you are rare, as I said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I know why Bear is such a tyrant and why he picks on Tom in particular.&quot;  Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is, Drake?&quot; Beldazzar said, cocking his head just slightly in interest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think Bear is bisexual.  I've seen him checking out the other guys just as much as I've seen him check out the women.  I saw him at a frat party once; he was really drunk.  He was so drunk that he let his inhibitions drop for just a moment or two.  He was in a darkened quiet corner with a buddy who had just passed out; Dirk, I think.  He thought everyone was too busy getting plastered to notice.  I was a designated driver, so I was quite alert and I happened to be in the right place and time.  On a sofa, in the darkened corner behind a fake plant, he leaned over his bearded Dirk, swaying a little as he did so and then he started playing with Dirk's crotch.  Dirk moaned, but he was so out of it he didn't come to.  When dirk opened his mouth, Bear deep kissed him.  It didn't last long and Bear went bawling for another beer just after, but it was there, his true feelings towards men, hairy men in particular.  There's a lustful longing within him and he becomes aggressive to any male he thinks might be gay or bisexual.  He's putting up barriers to keep them away, because he doesn't want to admit that he really wants to just hold them close and share something tender.  It makes me sad, but I think I know how I can help him, Tom and me all at the same time.&quot;  Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;A properly worded wish could do that.  Because you think of others, before yourself, I promise I will honor the spirit of what you wish rather than obeying it to the letter and choosing my own interpretation.&quot;  Beldazzar said, smiling warmly.<br />
<br />
Drake thought for a moment and then he made another wish.  &quot;I wish for Bear to be comfortable with his bisexuality, that his contact with Tom and Me will be friendly, leading us to a good relationship with the three of us, that physical contact with Bear will lead to Tom's and my bodies becoming as big or bigger with as much or more strength as Bear, with as much hair as Bear's body over a period of six months.&quot;  Drake said, wiping sweat from his brow.  <br />
<br />
It took a lot out of him to frame all of what he wanted into one long sentence without using 'and'.<br />
<br />
Beldazzar smiled, &quot;Done!&quot;  That was a most excellent wish, one of the finest I've ever heard crafted.  I doubt that even a perturbed Jinni could find fault with it.  You are a good man Drake, you have freed Bear from a cage built by his parents, his brothers and his peers and you have opened up possibilities for him and Tom and indeed yourself, that are positive.  I foresee that there will be problems for Bear.  His 'coming out' will bother some of his peers, but he will have you and Tom to help him through his emotional turmoil and look, here comes Bear now.  Beldazzar made a motion and a book fell from no where.  It was one of Drake's Algebra books.<br />
<br />
Six and a half-foot 'Bear' approached Drake and for the first time he had a wide smile on his face, not the scowl he usually wore.  &quot;Here, let me get that for you... Drake isn't it?&quot; The huge auburn bearded man said.<br />
<br />
He handed Drake the book.  &quot;My name's Boris, but everyone calls me 'Bear' cause I'm big and hairy...” the book seemed to almost jump from his hand and landed between Bear and Drake.  Drake heard a low, mirthful chuckle and knew Beldazzar had done it.  Drake retrieved the book.  &quot;Yep, that's me,” Bear said, &quot;Big, hairy and clumsy.  I only really feel graceful when I'm crushing some defensive lineman or sacking a quarterback.&quot;  He said with a big grin.  He held out his paw and Drake took it and shook.  There was an electrical charge that went through the both of them and Drake could swear he felt his body swell by millimeters and that his face was itching like he needed a shave.  Could the wish be working that fast?  Bear seemed to be getting a charge out of the contact too, Drake couldn't help but notice a bulge growing in Bear's pants.<br />
<br />
Bear coughed, &quot;Uh... 'scuse me, gotta adjust my cup.&quot;  Bear looked around to see if anyone was watching and straightened himself out.  Drake noticed that there wasn't a cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don't you and Tom usually hang out?&quot;  Bear said, changing the focus from his crotch to someone they both had in common.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, he's doin' it all wrong... weight lifting, I mean.  If he wants to bulk up he should...&quot; Bear said, but Drake interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you tell him?&quot;  Drake said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;'cause.&quot;  Bear said a bit sheepishly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, why?&quot;  Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because... well... just because.  Look, I've been kinda mean to Tom, but the truth is, I'd like to help him out.  It's jus' that, oh, whenever I talk to him I can't say it right.  It always comes out like a challenge and Tom gets defensive and then I get aggressive.  I can't help it; I never was good with words... I don't make many friends.  So could ya?&quot;  Bear said hopefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I what?&quot;  Drake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, could ya tell Tom that I'd like to help him out, convince him that I'm really not a monster?&quot;  Bear said, and there was a tinge of despair in his voice.<br />
<br />
Drake couldn't take it any longer; he'd tortured the poor Bear long enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, I'll talk to Tom.  Next time he goes for a workout, I'll come along just so things don't get off on the wrong foot, OK?&quot;  Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!&quot;  Bear almost crushed Drakes hand in an enthusiastic handshake and grabbed Drake in a big bear hug.  Drake felt his skin tighten ever so slightly and felt a tickle on his skin, he also felt Bear's rather large hard 'cup' pressing against his crotch.<br />
<br />
Bear broke the hug and turned to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, could you do me a favor?&quot;  Drake asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, What?&quot;  Bear asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell Tom that he needs to supplement his energy drink with Veg X.&quot;  Drake said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem, I do that myself.  It helps you bulk up... lot's of protein.&quot;  Bear said.  He waived his big furry paw at Drake and hurried off to class.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a good man, Drake.&quot;  Beldazzar said.<br />
<br />
Drake smiled.  He wanted to go back to the dorm and check out the developments from his contact with 'The Bear' and he seriously had to jack off.</p>
