<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next two days pushed Jen&#39;s willpower to the limit. The first day was extremely degrading behavioral training in a specialized course that introduced unknown human interactions to the dogs in order to familiarize them to being around new people.  For over 15 hours, Jen was forced to behave like a dog in front of a bunch of random people. <br />
<br />
From the looks they gave her, to their looks of revulsion once they knew a bit more about why she was here, really hit deep against Jen&#39;s moral. But on the other hand, several of the other dogs played along with her. And the fact that she ultimately felt refreshed after playing and running around with a bunch of dogs and their toys didn&#39;t help her mental case either after the fact. <br />
<br />
Jen had wished she could hide forever in shame as the realization of what she had done that day all hit her at once when she tried to go to sleep that night. Not only had she been fully naked, but she even pooped without a care for who saw her as she wanted to get back to chasing the tennis ball around. And to avoid punishment, she greeted each and every dog she came across that day by sniffing its ass.<br />
<br />
Day two was only slightly more manageable, as it was her first &quot;grooming&quot; session since the first one she had when she arrived here. This time they cleaned her up, reapplied her wraps and bindings after making some minor adjustments. One if which fixed a small dog muzzle to the inside of her mouth. She couldn&#39;t remove it, and somehow could even chew food with it. The nose on the muzzle connected a pair of tubes directly into her nose as well. <br />
<br />
It felt weird being forced to lap water out of her bowl, as her muzzle prevented her from slurping it as easily. It certainly made it take longer too. And the presence of a black nose on a yellow fur covered protrusion in her field of view was something she would have to get use to seeing all the time now. But, while it made her ability to eat and drink utterly canine, it did have one benefit. She now could catch. Be it balls, sticks, or frisbees, she could now catch them in her mouth with ease. <br />
<br />
In fact, she did so well in catching balls that she was rewarded with a brand new bone that she shared with Rex. By now, the thought of dog slobber being on things was of no concern to her anymore. Everything had it on it, so she was forced to get use to it very early. And now it didn&#39;t even phase her that her new bone had a large glob of dog drool on it. She just picked it up and laid down on her bed to gnaw away on it. <br />
<br />
It was just something she did to ease her boredom when she was put back into the kennel. She couldn&#39;t really do much besides that too. It wasn&#39;t like she could talk to the employees. She had that point shocked thuroghly into her. Barking and whimpering were the only noises permitted to exit her mouth. <br />
<br />
And as much as it bothered her to think about it, she still often remembered the three points that older man had told her. And she disliked that things were beginning to play out exactly as he said they would. She was becoming a dog. Her thoughts even were changing. Subtly, like how she was developing quite an interest in playing fetch, or becoming numb to the feeling of being naked all the time. And that alone worried her about the future. How far would she sink into the role? Would she ever return back to normal if she went in too deep? What if she forgot how to speak words? Actually wait, could she even say words anymore? She hadn&#39;t said a human word, ... a word, in days. But she was too scared to try it and risk getting shocked again. <br />
<br />
What also was driving her to adapt, was a new system that was implemented to accommodate her training. The longer she was good, the better rewards she earned, and one bad mark would reset her progress back to 0. She had already racked up 2 days of good behavior and didn&#39;t want to lose that progress. 2 days earned her an extra hour of play time. And 3 days would add another half hour on top of that. And if she got to 5 days, then her dinner would contain a few chunks of cooked meat.<br />
<br />
And, if she made it to 15 days. Then she wouldn&#39;t need to remain in the locked kennel at night and would be allowed to wander around the facility. She would be given a special collar that opened the doggie doors and her bed would be moved into the cozy office area where she would be allowed to stay in anytime she wanted to. This was her goal. If she got that office access, then she could listen to the conversations of the customers and employees. She could hear some gossips, and not need to sit in boredom like this. And the staff could pet her too! <br />
<br />
But that only was if she stayed a good dog and didn&#39;t get scolded for misbehaving. And while she disliked the thought of willingly walking into a life off a dog, it was still better than the alternative if she were to continue resisting and being difficult. 2 more weeks, and her life inside the kennel would be over with. 2 more weeks, and she and Rex could relocate into a better area. 2 more weeks of being a perfect dog. She only hopped that she wouldn&#39;t fully become one by the time 2 weeks have passed.</p>
