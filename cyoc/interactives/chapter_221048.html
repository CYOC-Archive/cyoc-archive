<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">      Luke against his better judgment, decided to put the mawashi on as a joke. At first he thought he should just put it over his clothing, but then thought ‘Why not go all the way!’. And so, he took off all his clothes so he can wear the mawashi…<br />
<br />
     As he starts off each of his clothes he neatly put them on Dave’s bed. First his shirt, then his pants, his shoes, his socks, and lastly his underwear. Initially he was gonna keep the underwear on, but decided to just ‘Wear it like it was supposed to!’, and he is stripped naked.<br />
<br />
    And so Luke put on the Medallion, and Dave’s ancestor’s mawashi… Luke is such a skinny guy, it just seems comical to be wearing what is essentially, underwear that’s 4x bigger than his… At least for the most part, Luke can still cover his private parts with this mawashi. Albeit as long as he keeps holding on to that damn thing!<br />
<br />
    Which is heavier than Luke anticipated…<br />
<br />
    He was taking aback by how, not only how heavy the belt was, but also how silky smooth it was… Of course he had to keep holding it, because he didn’t want to tamper the knot, and he didn’t know how to tie a mawashi knot…<br />
 <br />
    &quot;Wow! These things are even bigger than I thought&quot; Luke joked. “I wonder what it would be like to be just as fat as they are.” The mediation glowed as if giving him an indirect response. And Luke felt a strange vibration, like pins, and needles throughout his body.<br />
<br />
     &quot;What the...&quot; Luke said feeling the sensation within his body. Before he knew it he let out a small burp. Luke rubbed his stomach with one hand unbeknownst to him had gained a small belly. &quot;Why do I-… Why do I feel so bloated all of a sudden&quot; Luke said. He is feeling nauseated as he let out a few more burps, and holding both his stomach, and the mawashi… “What is happening to me?” but this time he noticed the weight gain. “What? No! This can’t- burp!” As his belly grew more, and more. His butt also started growing to the point where the mawashi is almost form-fitting to him.<br />
<br />
     &quot;What&#39;s goin- BURP!&quot; Luke said again as his body kept changing, not only gaining weight. But also becoming more Japanese than he’d expect. &quot;Ugh...&quot; Luke said sounding as if it’s getting deeper, as he continued to burp and gain weight. After a few minutes, he look at himself over…<br />
<br />
     Granted, Luke may have been roughly 190lbs though he’s not exactly athletic. But now he weigh 289lbs and had gained a massive layer of sturdy fat. &quot;What happened to me- des ka?&quot; Luke asked but the transformation was long from over.<br />
<br />
     Luke felt his body tingle as his hair changed to a jet black color and grew long. His hair reached his back before it suddenly became wrapped in a tradition bun. His skin grew paler while his body adapted to his sudden form. His ass grew chunkier and bigger until it fit the mawashi perfectly. In fact, the mawashi was a bit tight at this point. Luke had also gained a bigger package as he felt his dick constrain within the mawashi. The very cloth he had made fun of earlier, thinking he could wear it just for kicks…<br />
<br />
     His body grew wider and his face grew plumper. Luke then felt a big ripple in his body and the changes stopped. Luke was now a 36 year old Japanese sumo wrestler. Or at least that&#39;s what he looked like.<br />
<br />
    &quot;No! This can&#39;t be real!&quot; Luke said in a exotic tone. His voice sounded much different as if it was unaccustomed to English. The fact that he sounded like a Japanese man who could barely speak English is scaring him. Luke struggled to reach his phone off the ground and opened his camera, his phone won’t open with his face anymore, (Now that it’s different) he had to unlock it with his PIN code. He really has changed! His reflection said it all. He was large, pale and extremely overweight. &quot;Dave I need help!&quot; Luke yelled. He was miserably staring at this new man looking back at him, with every movement he make, the man copied, which made his body jiggled to every move he made.<br />
<br />
     He couldn’t just keep waiting, and he spoke out loud “&#12487;&#12452;&#12502;&#12289;&#12362;&#39000;&#12356;&#12375;&#12414;&#12377;!” Then he covered his mouth. Did he just… Did he spoke in Japanese?! He never spoke any language besides English. ‘No way! This can’t be real?!’ He thought. Be it is… In fact it sounds as if you would prefer to speak in that language, instead of English… <br />
<br />
     ‘I need to Change back!’ His medallion swung from side to side as he walked to the bathroom but there was one problem! He couldn&#39;t fit in the hallway. Luke is so desperate, he wants his old body back! &quot;Dave hurry!&quot; Luke cried. &quot;I&#39;m coming! I&#39;m coming! Man, what’s wrong? And why do you need my help-&quot; Dave stopped. In his living room stood a large sumo wrestler resembling his ancestor.<br />
<br />
    &quot;Who-who are you?&quot; Dave said pointing, and grasping the wall. &quot;Listen Dave it&#39;s me&quot; Luke said. Dave stood with wide eyes glazing at the large man standing in front of him. &quot;Dave when you were ten, we were swinging in the pool on your birthday, after everyone else left and it’s just us, you then lost your trunks in the pool. I had to go in, and get them for you.&quot; Luke said.<br />
<br />
      &quot;Wait! The only way you would know that is if you were... Luke is that you?&quot; Dave asked. &quot;Yeah it&#39;s me! I&#39;ve somehow changed into a sumo wrestler!&quot; Luke said pointing at his new appearance. &quot;Fascinating! I&#39;m seeing my ancestor for the first time&quot; Dave said glazing Luke over. &quot;Yeah, yeah! I&#39;m so happy for you. Please help me change back!&quot; Luke said. &quot;Okay, okay!… So uh… How did this happen?&quot; Dave asked.<br />
<br />
      &quot;It happened when I put on that stupid mawashi!&quot; Luke explained. “I’m pretty sure a mawashi doesn’t do that.” Dave stated then notice the medallion hanging from Luke&#39;s neck. &quot;Where&#39;d you get that medallion? It doesn&#39;t belong to my family&quot; Dave said. <br />
<br />
    &quot;Oh I found this an hour ago in a bush&quot; Luke said. <br />
<br />
      &quot;Wait! I think I can read the characters... it says: Transformer of Attire&quot; Dave said.<br />
<br />
      &quot;What the hell? Did I change just because I was wearing it?&quot; Luke asked. &quot;It appears so. To change back you probably have to wear your own clothes&quot; Dave replied.<br />
<br />
     “Okay then, that sounds easy enough!” Luke went to find his clothes, and Dave spoke “Wait Luke! There’s more information on this medallion! And it’s says-“<br />
<br />
     “Dave, we can worry about that later. I just want to get out of this body! And I want it now!” Luke just didn’t want to keep waiting… He just want to be himself again!<br />
<br />
     “But Luke! This could be important!” Dave sounded worried but Luke just won’t listen “I said ‘Later’!”<br />
<br />
      Luke just wanted back to being him again, and he won’t wait! And so he was looking for his clothes, he know he lay them down somewhere. Luke wouldn’t just throw his clothes down in a random house, even if it is his friend’s…<br />
<br />
   Dose he find them? If so dose he change back?</p>
