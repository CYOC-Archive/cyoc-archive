<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Across the world, Ulysses had no full way of knowing if his son would immediately convert or not. He knew that Nate loved Shuixing and that the two were practically inseparable whenever they were able to visit. Shuixing often was connected with her sisters, but Ulysses had seen over time that in certain situations, this also included bringing them to meet Nate. That was partially something that lead him to suspect that something like that would happen while they largely had the Bowman farm to themselves for a week and why he&#39;d reminded Nate that if that was done he&#39;d need to notify his college shortly after. The college might agree to accommodate him with a bed for some of the larger Animalians, but they&#39;d need the time to get it, not just having Nate show up in August as a Domestic Water Buffalo bull and expect a bed to be there.<br />
<br />
Though, there was the other point that while Wisconsin wasn&#39;t seeing the same level of spikes as there were in other places, Ulysses also couldn&#39;t know as to whether or not the University of Wisconsin would be able to welcome students back in August. After all, not every student came FROM Wisconsin and that could well mean they&#39;d be wrestling with all sorts of issues that were also present as Ulysses and Blueberry began their honeymoon. A lot of this related to travel testing and the requirements of certain destinations and travel was even allowed. The Animalian colonies in the southern hemisphere were largely closed down to travel from the outside as the virus was spiking there, and only in Australia did it seem like they might be open provided visitors meet strict testing requirements. Mieni and Heiya Island were technically also open and had major testing requirements and potentially quarantine requirements as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things seem a little quiet here...&quot; Blueberry commented to Gaz as they checked in on Mieni&#39;s main hotel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well the pandemic has shut down a lot of travel... normally this time of year, we&#39;d have a few cruise liners anchored either at the anchorages inside the atoll or on the outside, depending on the size of the ship,&quot; Gaz answered, &quot;but because we don&#39;t want massive outbreaks or it spreading... we&#39;ve put out notices to the cruise agencies that our docks are closed until THEY can provide proof that their accommodations are safe for their passengers. Horizon&#39;s scientists and doctors carry that examination out and so far none of those cruise line companies have put any sort of plan that would confirm their safety... or at least the means to track any sort of spread. So until they say they have something they approve of... they won&#39;t accept the cruise liners coming in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses slowly nodded, as he&#39;d noticed that as their Animalia Airlines Flight came in for a landing. There were now ships at Mieni, and some of that made some degree of sense given that with the establishment of the colony, Mieni had permanent residents. Tourism was a major part of their economy, but in the face of the pandemic, that also created issues in which the atoll&#39;s local population could be threatened by it. Most were Animalians, yes, but he&#39;d seen some news reports that gave some vague indication that Animalians could catch Covid 19 as some of the mundane animals that some Animalians were based on had caught the disease, and there were continued rumors coming out of Skull Island/Dinotopia Aquatica that raised the possibility of Animalians getting the disease being even higher. While there seemed to be every indication that Animalians might recover from the disease more easily, the fact that they could possibly catch it and that the disease remained contagious, Animalia and its colonies didn&#39;t want to have it arrive and spread. That had included the testing before they boarded the plane in Wisconsin and then again after landing at Mieni.<br />
<br />
It&#39;d likely hurt a lot of Mieni&#39;s economy, as their historical museum on Mieni&#39;s role in WWII and its scientific museum on the ocean deep, but from some of the things that Ulysses had noticed in the US was that the rush to open the US economy purely for economic reasons was doing more harm to public health than good and wasn&#39;t necessarily &quot;fixing&quot; the economic issues, as in some places people weren&#39;t confident to go out and in others the opening and the health issue was putting people in the hospital and preventing their ability to contribute. Thankfully many of the outdoor sites on Mieni were still open, and that was actually something that Ulysses looked forward to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Makes&#39; sense,&quot; Ulysses said slowly as Gaz lead them along the floor where he noted that all the doors were marked &quot;honeymoon suite&quot; and then a number. Gaz eventually stopped before the door marked Honeymoon Suite 3 and flashed one plastic card over the sensor and that turned the initial lock. As the door opened, Gaz then handed it to Blueberry who took the lead.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll mean things will be a bit tight for awhile... but with those that meet our health guidelines, we&#39;ll ultimately be fine in the long run,&quot; Gaz answered as Blueberry and Ulysses entered their honeymoon suite, which would be the primary base of operations for the pair of them, &quot;Enjoy your stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses and Blueberry both nodded as they entered the room and found it well larger than most hotel rooms that Ulysses had ever been in. On the east side of the wall there was a narrow cabinet that had a large screen television  that was on a stand on top of it, and that was about the only other furniture beside the bed that was in the room. The walls were colored in a sort of coral colored paint or wallpaper, Ulysses couldn&#39;t be sure. There was a bathroom and small closet area to their left of the west side of the entryway to the room and as they passed it, they found that that the room was dominated by a large heart shaped bed that was presently shadowed by the white curtains that covered the windows.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like they set this up for Valentines Day,&quot; Ulysses commented as he looked at the bed as Blueberry set her bags down beside the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;More like for honeymooners,&quot; Blueberry answered as she smiled back to Ulysses, &quot;which we are... and I&#39;d hope to make a happy experience for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ulysses set his bags down on the floor for a moment and smiled to Blueberry before pulling her into a hug and nuzzling his muzzle to hers, &quot;Just being there makes me happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... after a long flight and all those time zones... I&#39;m not sure on what to do...&quot; Blueberry answered as she looked to her husband, &quot;It&#39;ll be a while before they serve dinner or anything like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t think on anything outside for right now,&quot; Ulysses commented, &quot;as I would like to rest a bit from the flight... and we will have a week for all sorts of other fun things.&quot; He paused as he felt his penis rise out of its sheath and press against the underwear that he&#39;d gotten that fit his Animalian form and size as he felt Blueberry&#39;s impressive bust compress against his chest as they hugged. &quot;Though... I could think of some things we could do...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... you naughty bull,&quot; Blueberry smiled playfully, feeling the growing erection in her husband&#39;s pants press against the front of her own pants and his scent leading her own arousal to build in response, her longer nipples beginning to harden and push into the cups of her bra, &quot;you didn&#39;t even let me get undressed first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can work on that,&quot; Ulysses offered as he lead Blueberry over to the bed as he moved remove her shirt while she was more interested in removing his pants...<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next few days were relatively calm and very enjoyable for the newlyweds. While the honeymoon suite got a lot of use, the pair did enjoy a few things that went on outside the honeymoon suite. Some of it was to enjoy the hiking trail that rounded the atoll and brief swims between the islands, and while most cattle weren&#39;t known for spending a lot of time in water, both Blueberry and Ulysses enjoyed the swimming to some degree. Ulysses wasn&#39;t as buff as some of the Belgian Blue bull Animalians in Animalia, though the Brown Swiss was bread to make milk and wasn&#39;t used for either heavy labor or meat. But that didn&#39;t really matter to Blueberry. Ulysses was still handsome, and in theory his years of farm work had kept him in good shape, so it wasn&#39;t like he was out of shape. That was all that really mattered to Blueberry.<br />
<br />
Though on one of the islands they&#39;d found that things were also set up for a lot of heavy workouts. There were benches weights and specialized equipment that was set up there and presently had Joe the Pilot Fish, Gladys, and Rapier manning the work out and training positions with a small handful of people that had come to &quot;muscle beach&quot; in an area that was largely protected by a large metal framed tent with open sides and a tarp covering the top. It let people work out in the shade and avoid sunburn while also getting the benefit of a cool breeze.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two here to &quot;work out&quot; or...?&quot; Gladys spoke as she approached the two cattle Animalians.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re mostly just touring over some of the islands,&quot; Ulysses answered, &quot;this was... just something of a surprise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Gladys smiled and shook her head, her long bill going side to side as she did so, &quot;as this area is advertised... and since it&#39;s outdoors... we&#39;re actually able to maintain something of a schedule that would allow guests to use it safely... far easier than in any of the places where the gym is indoors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... but...&quot; Ulysses began a bit nervously, &quot;I was never the sort of person to go work out to work out. My wife and I run a dairy farm in Wisconsin. There ultimately ends up being a fair amount of heavy lifting in that too. Moving milk pails, especially when it comes to loading them onto the trucks that the companies buying milk for pasteurization or anything like that... and even the smaller market buyers can mean a fair amount of lifting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you&#39;re normally pretty busy and don&#39;t know where your limit is...&quot; Gladys asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I generally knew where it was,&quot; Ulysses answered, &quot;before my wife... Blueberry, here, gave me a wonderful gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Converting you?&quot; Gladys asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And being a wonderful companion,&quot; Ulysses answered, &quot;we talk, we snuggle, we do all sorts of things that young lovers do... and in a way... her uplifting made her young again and my conversion made me young again... That&#39;s let us talk more...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gladys gave a smile, &quot;Newlyweds... why don&#39;t we go through with some starting points... just to see where that limit is. For becoming Animalian is likely to increase your strength... I&#39;d imagine you&#39;re a lot stronger now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... go and see, dear,&quot; Blueberry urged, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing how strong my big and sexy bull is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not as strong as the Belgian Blue Animalians,&quot; Ulysses told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you don&#39;t have to be,&quot; Blueberry answered, &quot;let&#39;s just say that I&#39;m curious. And besides... it would appear that we&#39;re the only Cattle Animalians here at the moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was enough for Ulysses to go along with the sales pitch that Gladys had made to at least find out where his limit was. Ulysses was quick to find that they started at just under his limit at various lifts when he was Human and that he easily surpassed them. Some of that wasn&#39;t a surprise, as he did expect to be stronger as an Animalian. The workout did lead to him building up a bit of a sweat, and in the process. And as he worked his way up to where some of his new limits, he thought he caught a small scent of arousal from Blueberry as she watched, occasionally passing some time with the one hand weights and doing curls with them. Some of that had to be from watching the muscle he had flex as he worked his way up to where his new limit, which was much higher than where he was as a Human.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
From &quot;muscle beach,&quot; there was ultimately one island that Ulysses and Blueberry had to reach. The atoll  had a fair number of small islands on it that all had some value to them. The largest was the the main island and where all of the main facilities were, and there were others that served other purposes on other islands, though some, like the underground &quot;hotel&quot; on one of the atoll islands that was connected to the sight-seeing sub tours to the reefs on the outside of the island and the sunken USS Pennsylvania, were presently closed down because of the difficulty in socially distancing in those areas. However the island that they were headed for was one that was also well known and had more outside activities, though namely things that related to other newlywed activities.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lover&#39;s Lagoon&quot; was connected to one of the islands that allowed for more nude bathing and swimming and was enough away from the main islands that not many people would notice. And while neither Ulysses nor Blueberry could their breath for as long as more aquatic Animalians, the island that it was connected to was open, and after watching Ulysses test to see where his limits were, Blueberry was starting to feel a bit sexually charged up. True, Ulysses didn&#39;t match the Belgian Blue Bull Animalians, and he probably wouldn&#39;t match Nate as a Domestic Water Buffalo Bull Animalian whenever Nate converted, if he hadn&#39;t already... They&#39;d sent a sort of video message highlighting some of the things they&#39;d done as an attachment to Nate and Shuixing, but hadn&#39;t heard anything back from them. Regardless, Blueberry was pleased with her husband and he was more than strong enough to arouse her. And seeing him flexing the muscles he did have, and knowing that it was their honeymoon, Blueberry was ready for another round of love-making.<br />
<br />
&quot;And here we are,&quot; Blueberry smiled, &quot;a nice quiet spot... secluded from sight... some natural shade... and a handsome bull with a big heart...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Among other things making you horny at the moment,&quot; Ulysses answered as Blueberry turned to him, her nipples easily tenting the swimming top she was wearing with some beads of water rolling down the front of the swimwear. The scent of her arousal was also enough that he was starting to feel his own arousal building, as if to answer hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you complaining?&quot; Blueberry asked playfully as she removed her top and stood before her husband and let them bounce for a moment as the material was no longer holding them up. She noted Ulysses return a happy smile to her as began to pull his swim trunks down.<br />
<br />
Ulysses pulled them down and tossed them to one of the sandy areas nearby where it landed next to Blueberry&#39;s top. It also revealed the large rising shaft from his sheath, which earned a happy smile from Blueberry as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not complaining,&quot; Ulysses assured her as he came forward and kissed his wife as best he could, while Blueberry slipped her thumb in to pull down on the sides of her bikini bottom. &quot;You could say I&#39;m rising to the occasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s good of you,&quot; Blueberry smiled as they settled down onto a soft area of ground. Many of the areas around Mieni had proven to have soft sand, and while it wasn&#39;t quite as comfortable as a good mattress, it was seemed to support a fair number of tropical plants and was good enough to lay down on without being uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
As they got to the ground, Ulysses was quick to gently nibble and lack at some of the tender spots along Blueberry&#39;s neck and leaving a trail of kisses that crossed down to her collar and then onto her breasts. One hand even drifted down further to stimulate her vagina&#39;s outer lips. She let out a soft moan as her husband gave her the attention. It felt divine and she loved every minute off it. The only thing she wanted more was Ulysses&#39; large bovine member inside her, but for the moment he was doing a good enough job at foreplay that Blueberry had no complaints. Eventually he got down low enough to suckle on one of Blueberry&#39;s teats. Ulysses was rewarded with a little bit of milk, but not by too much.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooo-re...&quot; Blueberry moaned out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I can get any more out,&quot; Ulysses teased, &quot;I think with all our honeymoon love making I&#39;ve emptied you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get that big cock in me!&quot; Blueberry commanded as Ulysses started suckling on her other breast and she came on the hand that had been stimulating her clit.<br />
<br />
&quot;With pleasure,&quot; Ulysses assured her and then moved to the main event.<br />
<br />
Both let out heavy moans as Ulysses slowly eased his member into Blueberry. Ulysses from feeling the strength of his wife&#39;s vagina hugging his penis tightly. Blueberry from feeling her wet inner lips stretch around the bovine member as it eased its way gently into her. She&#39;d found that Ulysses more often not preferred to be gentle, even though they were comparable size and to a degree Blueberry could take it rough. She in fact remembered back to times before her uplifting when she and the other cows on the Bowman farm were brought over to one of the neighboring farms that had a breeding Brown Swiss bull in stock. That bull was often pretty quick to mount and wasn&#39;t exactly gentle, whereas Ulysses was gentle. Blueberry found she liked the way Ulysses made love to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... looooo-vuuuuh yoooooo,&quot; Blueberry moaned out as Ulysses sank his member in deep enough that he could begin establishing the steady pattern of pulling out a bit and then thrusting forward again, stimulating the major pleasure centers down there. Ulysses occasionally paused to kiss her or gently massage her breasts or her belly, all of which felt good. Even if their love making had emptied her breasts of milk, the sensation of the caress was still pleasureful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moooooooooooo toooooooooooo!&quot; Ulysses mooed back as he thrust into her, making Blueberry&#39;s breasts bounce a bit as he did so, and she wrapped her legs around her waist to hold him inside her.  There were these sorts of moments that he&#39;d never understood, why Blueberry often seemed to moan more like a Human woman when they made love and he found himself bellowing more like an actual bull. Blueberry had said that it was some chat that some of the Animalians in Lyre/Animalia had told her about before she and the rest of her group came back to Wisconsin. It appeared that former Humans seemed to pick up more on the animal&#39;s vocalization demonstrating the more &quot;animal&quot; side they&#39;d gained as Animalians while an uplifted Animal seemed to try to mirror the more Human vocalization showing the elements of Humanity that they had gained. It was odd and neither Ulysses nor Blueberry understood it. The only thing that mattered to them was working toward the orgasms that were building.<br />
<br />
They were at it for a few minutes, and Blueberry had enjoyed a few strong orgasms before she finally began to feel Ulysses&#39; penis twitch inside her. He was getting close, and while she knew she wouldn&#39;t come into heat until the fall, that didn&#39;t mean she was going to reject the pleasure she felt or deny her husband the pleasure he deserved. After all, so far as Blueberry knew, the last woman that Ulysses had been with before her was Nate&#39;s mother, who&#39;d proven to be more than imperfect. And as she&#39;d come to love Ulysses dearly after her uplifting, she vowed to do her best to love Ulysses and that included the love-making session they were having now. Then as if in unison as Ulysses finished one thrust, Blueberry&#39;s vaginal walls clamped down tight on Ulysses penis as she she came again and he had a massive orgasm at his own.  Both let out a powerful bellowing &quot;moo&quot; at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re wonderful,&quot; Ulysses said to her as he rolled onto his side beside Blueberry.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are too,&quot; Blueberry smiled and the two kissed, &quot;and I hope this has been a wonderful honeymoon for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it has,&quot; Ulysses replied, &quot;you were here with me... as you always have.&quot;</p>
