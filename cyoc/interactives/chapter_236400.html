<br />
While society and the mortal world at large had virtually remained the same, the supernatural world, specifically the vampire realm, was undergoing great changes.<br />
<br />
Lord Wyatt Tepes alongside his devoted wife, Lady Kyra Tepes has made many of his citizens prosper and flourish under his rule. He is known throughout the land to have a friendly demeanor, if you didn&#39;t cross him or his family. The Tepes rule wasn&#39;t just thanks to Wyatt and his wife, but also to his extended family as well.<br />
<br />
Vlad and Lisa Tepes have been great mentors to the two of them since they had come to live in Tepes Manor. Hanako Ashida-Tepes also remained by their side as one of the families bodyguards and also training instructor to the Tepes children. Donovan remained ever loyal to Wyatt and Kyra throughout the years as well just as he was to Wyatt&#39;s father before him. As with his father before him, should Wyatt ever need something drastic taken care of, he would send one or all of the Five to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Ken and little Ann have changed little in the years since Wyatt had become their lord, Ken was still the skillful sword master and little Ann was deadly little Ann as always. Cassandra and Duchess grew to become a very formidable duo together. Cassandra first had her doubts that Duchess could be her equal, but she found Duchess to be a partner better than she could have ever anticipated. Lancelot was different from the other five in that he wasn&#39;t as much into the blood lust as the others were, especially little Ann. But he sometimes took on the more stealth-like missions that Wyatt or Kyra would assign to him. These formidable vampires impressed the other lords, but it was others who had a lasting impact on the future heirs of the Tepes kingdom.<br />
<br />
Miss Cheyenne Meyers, a beloved member of the Tepes family, even if she wasn&#39;t officially one, helped raise the Tepes children and they loved her too. Acting as their nanny, the Tepes quints adored the woman, seeing the woman as a second mother. She also came to see the young princesses like daughters, considering her own daughter was busy with her own priorities these days. Wyatt and Kyra were loved and respected by the community at large, but none would argue that the lord and lady of the land loved their five children the most.<br />
<br />
Princess Andromeda Tepes is the daughter who loves to live up the most to being the royal princess, and many would say that among all her siblings, she happens to be the most positive of them. Like all the Tepes children, she like any vampire will kill and feed on animals but only on the sick or dying, as she has a great love of animals thanks in part to visiting her Uncle Duke and Aunt Sasha&#39;s ranch within the mortal realm. Andromeda since she was a young child has hated the reputation that vampires have had of being the worst among the supernatural community and she wants to change people&#39;s opinions on that. She already changed the opinion of one boy she met and fell in love with when they met near her Uncle&#39;s ranch some years back and have exchanged secret love letters since. They hope to meet again soon, but worry what their families would think of them if they knew who they were writing to or wanted to meet.<br />
<br />
Princess Nyx Tepes was once upon a time just like her sister, so much to the point that the two acted almost like twins. But one dreaded night would change Nyx&#39;s demeanor on life forever and as she developed a gothic look and personality following the traumatic event. She knows her sister has a secret boyfriend that she can&#39;t tell her about, but she doesn&#39;t really care, she doesn&#39;t think that there&#39;s any boy out there who could make her heart beat like the way her sister&#39;s does for her secret love.<br />
<br />
Prince Andrew Tepes is the sibling who seems like the one who will most likely inherit the throne one day when compared with his other siblings. Ever since he was a young child and saw his father beaten by a cruel human, he vowed to not let anyone ever hurt his family. He was disappointed when he couldn&#39;t help his sister on the night she needed help the most. Lancelot and Hanako have trained him well in martial arts and training as a knight. Many women of the land see the young prince as the most handsome of his brothers and swoon and nearly faint whenever he speaks with any fair maidens. As Andrew grew older, he began accompanying his parents on diplomatic talks to see the other vampire lords and will admit he has had a crush on Lady Roseblood for the longest time and vows to impress her however he can. While he is the most well trained, Andrew&#39;s hotheaded temper sometimes will get the better of him.<br />
<br />
Prince Brendan Tepes might be the most meek of his siblings. He doesn&#39;t like to put up a fight with anyone and would rather spend his days reading up on history and other cultures than fight, but both his father and mother encourage him to do his training lest he or one of his siblings has a repeat of that day. While he is the quietest of his siblings, if anyone threatens his family or siblings, he may tap into his inner strength and is perhaps the toughest of his siblings. Brendan also works with Vlad and Lisa in preserving the history of the Tepes family archives. Brendan prefers not to stand out from everyone like Nyx, something they share in common. He likes to dress fancy both for and outside family occasions. Brendan likes to keep his hair short and tidy, and likes to wear glasses, but doesn&#39;t really need them. Brendan has also come to realize that me might prefer men to women unlike his brothers.<br />
<br />
Prince Duncan Tepes is more well known as the prankster of the family. After their terrible night together, Duncan has always tried to keep his parents and siblings spirits up with a laugh. However, his pranks can sometimes backfire and he hears &quot;Duncan!&quot; more times than he&#39;d like to admit. Some of the townspeople may think of him as a clown and unworthy of being a Tepes at all, but none may actually realize that he is actually the most intelligent of his siblings. Unlike his siblings, he would prefer a psychological attack on enemies rather than a direct fight. While he seems the most laid back of the siblings, it&#39;s only to hide his intelligence, his father wishes he would be more assertive. His left eye became stuck years back in the old blood mode due to an accident he had while training years ago, but he&#39;s never let it bother him.<br />
<br />
Now 17 years later, just like the Harris family in the mortal realm, the Tepes children will also find themselves on the brink of history.</p>
