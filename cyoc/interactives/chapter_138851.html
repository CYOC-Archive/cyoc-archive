<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Diane sat on the bus with her friends, barely keeping up with what they were talking about. Every so often she would shift in her seat, reach down and pull gently on the legs of her jeans in an attempt to relieve the discomfort she was feeling. As Bets started talking about her car, how her parents would be giving her back the keys later tonight and what the four could do for fun afterward, Diane stopped listening after a bit and instead allowed her replies to be automated as she tried to deal with the uncomfortable feeling that had started in her lower abdomen and had slowly moved downward into her crotch.<br />
<br />
Mentally figuring when she last had her period, she figured that it was too early for her next cycle. Wondering why she was feeling the way she was, she absently commented, &quot;Maybe. But if I do, Chad will likely want to come along as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure what she&#39;d responded to, the sixteen year old girl tried to figure it out, but instead found herself dwelling on the strange sensation in her groin and abdomen. The feeling in her belly was almost like a pressure that was borderline cramps, while the sensation in her genital region was more of a tightening, combined with a warmth that she attributed to her being horny and usually led to a slick, sometimes sticky, feeling between her legs. Absently shifting so that she was sitting with her legs open, unaware that she was sitting exactly like a guy would, she tried to focus on something Chastity was saying to April, and what Bets was commenting, but instead found herself thinking about Chad, which seemed to make what she was feeling worse somehow.<br />
<br />
A slight grunt that almost sounded horse-like escaping her, she offered a sleight neighing laugh at something April said, who uttered a bark-like laugh as she finished, yet none of these noises seemed off to Diane as she continued to sit like Chad would and tried to sort out why she felt the way she did. Her thoughts straying to her boyfriend, even as she gave a noncommittal response to something Chastity stated, Diane found herself dwelling on how, all four of them, she was the only one with a steady boyfriend. April had tried dating on and off, but it seemed like she had found the right person. Chastity, true to her name, didn&#39;t date. And Bets, Diane thought the girl must surely swing for their team, as she never seemed to have any interest in guys and, on a couple occasions, Diane was sure she&#39;d caught her friend checking out a girl, which Diane thought was fine, if that was what Bets wanted.<br />
<br />
&quot;She shouldn&#39;t have to hide it,&quot; Diane thought moodily to herself and glancing out the bus window, she suddenly realised where they were.<br />
<br />
Not giving it a second thought, she instantly reached up and grasped the pull cord to signal the bus to stop. As it pulled up to a bus stop a block down, Diane stood, noted the pressure between her legs seemed to worsen when she did and ignoring April barking-laugh and comment, &quot;Going to see Chad,&quot; in a low, sultry voice, Diane said, &quot;I&#39;ll catch you all later,&quot; as she hastily exited the bus.<br />
<br />
The instant her feet hit the pavement, she turned and began running in the direction of Chad&#39;s house. Hoping her boyfriend was home, she reckoned that the best cure for what was ailing her was what the sixteen-year-old boy hand. Practically flying down the block, unaware that she was running a bit faster than she normally did, Diane reached the Wilken&#39;s house in minutes flat. Hurrying around to the back, she let herself in through the patio door and into the dining room. Eyes adjusting, she heard something from the attached kitchen and looking in the direction, she saw Chad, a surprised look on his face, fixing a sandwich.<br />
<br />
Her boyfriend trying to acting nonchalant by stating, &quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see you until sometime later...&quot; Diane never gave him the chance to finish as she launched herself across the room, leapt up and embracing the young man in a hug, her arms wrapped around his neck and her legs wrapped around his waist, she began kissing him.<br />
<br />
As she did this, she tried to thrust her pelvis toward him, but found the motion didn&#39;t work and instead settled for kissing his lips, nose, chin and cheek. Chad, taken back by this, tried to inquire about their plans to wait, but never got the chance as Diane growled, &quot;Take me,&quot; before starting to nibble affectionately at his ear. Not needing another invitation, figuring she must have changed her mind, as she often did, Chad began to fumble with his pants as he tried to return her passionate and wild kisses.<br />
<br />
Their balance suddenly shifting, Chad stopped what he was doing with the button on his jeans and instead half-carried, half-stumbled out of the kitchen. Knowing they wouldn&#39;t get to his room, he instead aimed for the couch and laying Diane down, he returned to trying to get his pants off. Diane, from where she lay, paused when she realised what her boyfriend was doing and reaching down, she hastily undid the four buttons on her jeans and pushed down. The pressure in her crotch letting up a bit, she didn&#39;t give it a second thought to removing her underwear. Seeing that Chad had also removed his pants, and his boxers, she eyed his erect member a moment, but as he drew near, she reached out and placed a hand against the side of his head.<br />
<br />
The pressure between her legs mixing with the increasing warmth she felt, she directed her boyfriend&#39;s face down between her legs. Chad, smelling the strong, tantalising odour of her sex, was at first put off by what Diane wanted. But the smell was so empowering, he didn&#39;t balk and instead placed his head between her legs and began to use his mouth to satisfy her, thinking only briefly that her genitals looked weird. But then the moment passed and without giving thought to what he was doing, he slipped his hand between her legs, collected several finger fulls of her juice and, instead of putting it in his mouth or rubbing his penis with it, Chad placed his hand between his legs and began rubbing the area.<br />
<br />
The warm, sticky fluid feeling good between his legs, plus never seeming to dry up or run out, Chad had a brief flash that something was amiss when he thought what he was doing was odd, that the tingly-warmth he felt between his legs seemed to be growing whilst the area grew slicker and stickier, and that the area between Diane&#39;s legs felt weird, almost as if part of it was slowly extending outward and into his mouth. But then the thought and feelings were lost as Diane nickered wildly, &quot;Oh, yes. You&#39;re my beautiful brood mare. Keep going. Don&#39;t stop,&quot; and not wanting to disappoint, Chad began alternating between making a sucking sensation and forming an &#39;o&#39; shape with his mouth and bobbing up and down on Diane&#39;s erect clit, which was nearly halfway into his mouth and getting thicker the more they continued, and fingering the area between his legs.</p>
