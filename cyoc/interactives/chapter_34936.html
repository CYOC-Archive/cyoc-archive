<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She sat at the computer and imagined the possibilities as she stared at the back of her now mole free hand.<br />
She looked at her own body, Dressed in only her underwear, a bra   and one of jack's old bath robes she wondered what this younger handsome guy saw in her. <br />
She smiled as she thought about how he made love to her, with such passion. <br />
She had never been a real beauty even when she was younger. She was always a bit overweight, and wasn't blessed with her mother's or grandmother's chest size.<br />
She started to change her stats. She didn't want to be too young, only wanted to erase the damage to her body caused by child birth, and the poor eating and exercise habits after that. <br />
<br />
-22years should be good that would make her 25 years old. This would make her still older than her daughter, and give her her pre pregnancy age back.<br />
<br />
She thought about how much she weighed back then 170lbs. She cringed though it was less than she weighed now at 210lbs. <br />
She entered 130 as her weight, she didn't wasn't to be a stick girl.<br />
She searched through the options and found the dimension editing window. It took a bit to figure it out the controls were a little more complicated than she thought they would be.  <br />
She figured out that she only need to set a couple of the dimensions and the rest would default according to her height weight and the stats that she did enter.<br />
Without thinking she increased her chest to a D-cup then she paused for a second.  If she was gonna do this she was gonna go big or go home.  She erased the D-cup and changed it to an E-cup.<br />
One of her secret fantasies was to had a tiny waist. She imagined jack puting his arms around a tiny waist with a smooth flat tummy.<br />
She entered her waist as 24 inches. That should give her amazing curves.<br />
She hummed and hawed for a bit on her height.  She didn't mind being 5'3, but a few more inches of height couldn't hurt she thought as she looked at her fat little legs.<br />
But how much? She figured 5'8 wasn't too tall, she added 3 inches to her legs and the other 2 inches on her Torso.  The extra couple inches on her spine would make her torso a little more accommodating to her much bigger breasts.<br />
She opened a window for her face even though she hadn't been much of a standout beauty when she was younger she had a pretty face that would be fully restored with the regression.  Full lips, cute nose.<br />
<br />
She thought about going blond, but she decided to embrace her European decent.  She darkened her already blue eyes so they were a deeper blue. <br />
<br />
She grew, darkened, and made her hair thicker.  She smiled as she thought about it cascading down to the middle of her back. She had been lazy with her hair. She had been cutting it short so that she didn't have to do much with it.<br />
<br />
She eyed the on screen Apply Button, and noticed another button.  'CLOTHING'<br />
 She clicked on it and a window popped up a list appeared with all the clothing she was wearing on it, and even the clothing she had left up in the bedroom on the floor.<br />
<br />
She selected the robe.  Even thought it wasn't hers it was on the list, it must have been because she was wearing it. I doubt he would mind when if she changed it after he see's her in the new improved one. The clothing interface was really easy to navigate.  <br />
She changed the material of the old bath robe from the ratty blue terry to white Silk and the condition to new and shortened the hem line to her mid thigh.<br />
<br />
She selected her panties and changed her full support panties for a side tied bikini style, in a plain white cotton, as she thought about Jack untying them to collect his prize.<br />
She changed her bra in to a matching bikini top also in white cotton. She had considered changing her old ratty B-cup bra into something more supportive but when she was done she wasn't going to need support for a few hours at least.<br />
<br />
She thought about changing her other clothing but was getting excited and wanted this  to happen so she left them the way they were. <br />
She closed the window and a new one popped up. <br />
'MAKE CLOTHING ADJUST TO SIZE? YES - NO'<br />
She clicked YES.<br />
another window popped up 'CHANGE CLOTHING BEFORE BODY CHANGE?  APPLY'<br />
She clicked apply.<br />
She suppressed a shriek as he clothing began to move and adjust itself on her body. She quickly stood up as her robe turned white and smoothed into silk, she felt a draft on her calves then her knees and thighs it shortened. He undergarments shrunk till they were very revealing.  The strings of the bikini disappeared into her rolls of fat. <br />
She closed the robe quick, she was red faced at how ridiculous she looked in the undergarments meant for a smaller body. <br />
Thank god no one had seen her like this, i gotta change quick before someone does she thought to herself.<br />
<br />
She found the apply button and hit it.<br />
<br />
She immediately felt energized, she opened her robe to reveal her incredibly shrinking body.  She got thinner and thiner, her waist most notable as it shrunk to the 24&quot; she had set. her breast inflated to full E-cups and her hair grew longer stopping at her mid back.<br />
The changes finished and she inspected the final product.  her ass was a little bigger than what she wanted but it was tight and round.<br />
She smiled and went back to the bedroom and stood in the doorway, and whispered Jacks name over and over again till he woke up.</p>
