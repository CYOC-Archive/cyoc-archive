<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Thus begins the potential change up to the Male Mouse&#39;s &quot;sneakiness&quot;</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wipe your muzzle lips seductively staring back at your spent mate licking both your paw and lips of any remnants of his delicious potency having thought taking him this way would slate your feral lust.  But you find it is never that simple...never enough with your wild animal urges.<br />
<br />
Your body and mind squeals for the real deal.  You ache to mate; to breed, to grow your nest.<br />
<br />
The male mouse only has time to utter, &quot;Wha~&quot; before you move hastily upon him grasping his shoulders and locking rodent lips heavily in erotic bliss, forcing his maw to part with your tongue.  He loses balance and tumbles backward landing on his rump and tail, a sharp squeak voicing his ache before your lips silence it keeping him distracted.  You climb on top of your mate doing your best to straddle his lap in your feral frame, your tail whipping and coiling around his making it clear you want him, be it love or lust.<br />
<br />
You feel a faint attempt at your rodent partner struggling to ease your motions. Though that wanes quickly as expected giving into your advances as his kisses and exploring paws match your fevered pace.  Passionate moans spill between each other craving the rocks and grinds of your furry bodies, arousing warmth and carnal bliss swelling instantly the second your mate guides his renewed pride pass your sweltering gates.  Stiff and tall again so soon; you don&#39;t linger too long on how or whether your mate aches from any pain, simply elated that he thrusts with ecstatic vigor to fornicate.<br />
<br />
Pleasure rises as your climax nears, hugging your mate&#39;s rodent hips with your hindquarters eagerly ready to be filled.  Wanting his seed, wanting his offspring to bear, to rear and to grow...it&#39;s strange, but this might be the first time you desire to be a mouse yet you&#39;re not disappearing into those feral thoughts completely.  Are you starting to accept this life?  Is this a reprieve from your own curse if you accept your fate?<br />
<br />
Relishing everything you don&#39;t realize that your mate has rolled you onto your back still pumping wildly for his release, his pride pulsating inside you feeling a ting of his molten potency coating your temple walls.  You grasp around him tightly tilting your head back, a smile crossing your muzzle as your orgasm hits you immediately sounding your rapture.  The male mouse follows swiftly after as one final deep push erupts his delicious cream into you, his body arched and head held up high as you two sing.<br />
<br />
Your mate falls flat upon you as you both savor the afterglow of lust, your paws petting the back of his neck and shoulders as you hold each other&#39;s embrace.  You nuzzle the side of his neck humming soft squeaks of bliss before he lifts his head slowly and gaze into your beady mousey eyes full of love.<br />
<br />
&quot;You...You&#39;re still in there?&quot; He asks you almost stumped, though he pushes the awkwardness aside with his own smile leaning in and rubbing noses.  &quot;Guess we&#39;re lucky...lucky enough to keep our senses right now.  I don&#39;t know how, but...I call this a win at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
Granted; you&#39;ve given yourself to a complete stranger most likely knocked up destined to become a mother of mice.  And yet; you&#39;re quite fine with that future.  You&#39;re mate seems sweet and adoring enough, despite a few unusual quirks he still hasn&#39;t clarified yet.  You even think back to the Pentagram under your bed and why his scent, his spilled essences, is all over it.  But you hardly seem to care anymore when one of your ultimate fantasies has come true tonight.  You don&#39;t feel quite worried if you ever change back into your human self.  You stroke his ear and let out a giggle, licking his muzzle as you tease your mate that you&#39;re still up for another rut.<br />
<br />
&quot;My word.  Are you always this horny?&quot; Your mate jokes chuckling as he nuzzles back teasing back with a few thrusts of his own stirring temptation.  He stops; however, bashfully pulling out and break your embrace standing on his haunches.  &quot;But maybe it would be best if we took our mating somewhere out of sight, somewhat safer than out in the open.  As I mentioned earlier, I do have a nest inside your closet.  I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve been in there...and it&#39;s surprisingly human-made for a hole in the wall.  You&#39;ll see what I mean when we get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
The male mouse turns to the edge of the bathroom countertop looking down judging the distance before looking back to you scrambling to your paws to follow.  &quot;You&#39;ll probably have even more questions too.  I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t quite answer all of them; a few we might solve together maybe.  But I promise you I&#39;ll keep you safe...and stay with you always.&quot;  With that and warm smile and starts to climb down to the floor nudging the crack of the open door wider before exiting.  You wonder about everything he said realizing there might things even your mate doesn&#39;t understand yet.  Perhaps the two of you will need to work together to solve this mysterious curse...if you want to that is.<br />
<br />
Climbing down after and slipping past the crack you find your mate waiting by the bedroom door exchanging nuzzles and scurrying side by side as you turn to the closet&#39;s bi-folded door and slip through its ajar gap.  Your sense of smell and feeling with your whiskers help guide you across the closet floor littered with boxes and shoes you hadn&#39;t the time organize or clean, though even with the dimming light you don&#39;t get lost as easily as you might of without your humanity intact.<br />
<br />
Your mate stops you before making contact with the opposite end of the closet, chuckling nervously.  &quot;So...this is going to look suspicious, but I swear I have no clue why this works.  It just worked by accident when I did...this.&quot;  You tilt your head and furrow your brow confusingly as he you hear your mate clap his paws twice, jumping back as two orange balls of fire suddenly burst from the wall.  You steady your nerves fighting back against your fight and flight animal instincts as the new source of light gives you a better view of what you are seeing; the two small balls of flame crackling upon odd steel-like torch holders...and a wooden oval door with a small see-through window in the center?  It kind of looks like one of those Hobbit holes to be honest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of me believes that witch is giving me one bit of reprieve being stuck as a mouse,&quot; your mate attempts to explain yanking at the round hanging doorknob and opening the hole up.  &quot;Considering I have no clue how I could have put my nest together like this while just a feral animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t move yet as doubt rekindles within finding it rather hard to believe the male mouse&#39;s unusual story.  Though again; nothing about each other&#39;s situation is &quot;usual&quot;.  You step forward and cautiously take a peek inside trying to observe what you see before committing.  However; his nest is clouded with his musk luring you in deeper within realizing it, feeling a sense of security and desire to enter and bask in his nest...your nest.  You give a light squeak and smile walking inside completely.<br />
<br />
The male mouse watches you enter his domain as he turns and pulls the wooden door close, a grin stretching back along his muzzle as he quietly utters, &quot;Welcome home, my love.&quot;  Only...after saying it he immediately blinks and pauses feeling rather confused and concerned, for a brief moment...among many brief moments...he didn&#39;t quite feel like himself, and not in the feral animal kind of way.  He looks back to you and immediately feels the doubt wash away smiling.  You both may be stuck as mice, but at least you two appear to be content and happy.  He wonders if raising a nest with their pinkies won&#39;t be quite as bad as he thought as the door fully shuts, the torchlight&#39;s extinguishing leaving the closet dark once again.<br />
<br />
~THE END???~</p>
