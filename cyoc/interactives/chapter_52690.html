<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked at the nightgown and panties. They were silk and felt nice in your hands and would probably feel nice wearing them. Besides Madam Morphia is allowing you to stay here tonight and it would be in poor taste to sleep in the nude. You smiled thinking that Madam Morphia had a feminization fetish. Well if that was the case you could humor her by wearing them. You pulled up the panties liking the feel of them. They were a little tight but they fit. Picking up the nightgown you were sure that it wouldn't fit you seeing as it was small and looked like it was for a young girl. Though you had thought that about the panties too and they fit. You pulled on the nightgown and found that it fit like it should. It went down to your knees with the sleeves going down to about your elbows. You ran your hands over it and yawned. You were tired and figured you should get some sleep. Going around you made sure to blow out the lit candles and felt your way to the bed in the dark. A few lightning flashes helped you to find your way. Once there you slid between the warm sheets and quickly drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
You were back out in the storm driving your car. This confused you since the last thing you remembered was going to sleep in Madam Morphia's house. Before you could figure it out there was a flash of lightning close by and a loud crack of thunder. A tree fell in the road in front of you and you couldn't stop. A tree branch rammed through your windshield and into your body.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you were standing on a patio and the sun was shining. Sitting in a couple of chairs were Madam Morphia and Mary. You were wearing what you had worn to bed while they were wearing sundresses and what looked like wide brim straw hats. &quot;I'm glad you could join us,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;I'm sure you have some questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; you said, &quot;though since this is a dream any answers would only be the answers I imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't a dream,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;To prove it to you look at the cover of this book and note the title and how the letters are arranged. Look away then look back and tell me if it's different.&quot;<br />
<br />
Madam Morphia handed you a book and you looked at it. You looked back up at Madam Morphia then back at the book. &quot;It hasn't changed,&quot; you said with a sigh. &quot;So that means that this isn't a dream. But if this isn't a dream then that means the first part wasn't a dream either.&quot; You looked right at Madam Morphia and asked, &quot;I'm dead aren't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid so,&quot; Madam Morphia said with a sad look on her face. &quot;Sit down please and I'll answer your questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit down and asked, &quot;Why did you give me these clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not the first question most people ask,&quot; Madam Morphia said smiling. &quot;But to answer your question I want to make you my second daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I want another daughter and I believe that you'll be a good one,&quot; Madam Morphia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see this is a halfway house,&quot; Mary said and then took a sip of iced tea. &quot;Mother's job is to prepare the spirits of those that come here to be reincarnated. What they're reincarnated as depends on what they want. Some come back as animals and others as human. Some even want to be inanimate objects. I've been helping Mother since she made me her daughter. We could use a little more help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it's up to you if you want to be my daughter,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;I'm not going to force it on you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You sit and think for a few moments then say, &quot;You've been so nice to me since I arrived. I believe I will become your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah excellent,&quot; Madam Morphia said with a smile. At that moment a bird flew down with a small scroll in it's beak which Madam Morphia took. Unrolling it she read what was on it and scowled then said, &quot;This is one part of the job that I don't like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it Mother?&quot; Mary asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A bank robbery,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;The robber will have a sawed off shotgun and will shoot a little girl before being shot himself. He'll survive but the girl won't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's awful,&quot; you said in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is,&quot; Madam Morphia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the girl won't be there,&quot; Mary said. &quot;It's happened before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we won't know until it happens,&quot; Madam Morphia said with a sigh. Looking at you she said, &quot;You can be of great help here. Usually with children Mary's the first one to greet them. Now with these young ones you can be the first one to greet them.&quot; The bird came back with another little scroll. After reading it Madam Morphia said, &quot;There's a change. The girl's mother is going to die too trying to protect her. The girl still dies instantly but the mother will die a little later at the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So things aren't set in stone,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;We'll get updates when things change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe the robber will have a change of heart and not rob the bank or at least not shoot anyone,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be nice but it usually doesn't happen that way,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;We have a little time left before we have to get ready so do you have any other questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why didn't you want me going back to my car?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because there's a short window in which you have to come here,&quot; Madam Morphia explained. &quot;If you don't get here or leave and that window closes you become a ghost. After that you usually need help to get back to one of the houses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the houses?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Mary said. &quot;There's so many deaths that one house can't possibly take care of them all. Plus we're in divisions. We're violent deaths.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that sucks,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone has to do it,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;But now we need to get you ready. Come with me and Mary.&quot;<br />
<br />
You followed Madam Morphia and Mary into the house, up a couple flights of stairs, and through twisting halls. You were led into a room that was pink. Madam Morphia turned to you and said, &quot;Ok strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at Mary and said, &quot;I don't think I should with Mary here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't have time for this&quot; Madam Morphia said and the grabbed the hem of the nightgown and quickly pulled it up and off. Before you could do anything she had also pulled down the panties you were wearing. Somehow she had been able to pull them away without you lifting your feet. &quot;Now we can start,&quot; she said straightening up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... ok,&quot; you said blushing a bit.<br />
<br />
Madam Morphia put her hands on your shoulders and gently pushed down. Even though it wasn't much force your eye level started dropping without you bending your legs. At the same time all your body hair retracted into your body. Once you were the size of a five or six year old she massaged your dick and balls which got smaller and smaller until they were gone. Then she moved to between your legs and rubbed there causing the skin to swell slightly and split. She then moved on to the rest of your body massaging it and reshaping it. She moved to your face and you automatically closed your eyes when her fingers got close. You felt her gently rub your eyes then she started brushing your hair. Each time she pulled the brush through your hair it was a little longer until it got to the end. It felt great having your hair brushed and you forgot that you were dead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you're done,&quot; Madam Morphia said and you opened your eyes. &quot;Mary, get her a pair of panties, sundress, hat, and sandals out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Mary said going to a dresser and taking out a pair of panties with red and pink hearts on them. Next she went to the closet and brought out an ivory white sundress, white sandals, and a white hat like they were wearing. Coming over she held the panties and said, &quot;Step in.&quot; You did as she said and she pulled them up snug against your groin. She then told you to put your arms up and slid the sundress on you. She brushed your hair real quick and placed the hat on your head using a few bobby pins to secure it. Last she helped you put on the sandals and then took your hand. Turning you around she asked, &quot;How do you like the new you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked in the mirror and were stunned at what you saw. Looking back at you was a pretty five year old girl with curly red hair and green eyes. &quot;I love it,&quot; you said noticing that your voice was a girl's now.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll need a new name,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;I think Amanda will do. We can call you Mandy for short.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like it,&quot; you said. You thought of something and asked, &quot;What about breakfast?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You skipped over breakfast,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;It happens at times when you're dead. Chunks of time just fly by. Don't worry though. I'm sure you'll be here for lunch. Now I need to tell you a few things. As my daughter you can now find your way around the house. Also you know that you'll be greeting the girl in just a little bit now. Most people don't know that they've died and will refuse to believe you even if you show them their body. You'll know if they know or not from things that they say and what they do. If they don't know that they're dead don't tell them. Now it will be your job to get her into the house and keep her in it before the window closes, you'll know how much time you have left. You can't force her to come in or stay. Do you have all that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better take this seriously Amanda,&quot; Madam Morphia said sternly. &quot;If you don't you'll lose the girl and a child ghost is the saddest ghost. They're very hard to get into another house and some have been roaming the earth for a hundred years or more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy,&quot; you said looking down and putting your hands behind your back and twisting your right foot on your toes looking just like a little girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Madam Morphia said. &quot;The girl's name is Sally. Do your best to get her to come in and keep her inside. It will be around lunch so you could use that to get her inside. Oh and her mother has drilled into her a code phrase that will let her know she can go with certain people. That phrase is &quot;hoppy floppy time&quot;. Do you have that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said nodding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Madam Morphia said smiling. “There’s a swing on the porch. Go on and go swing while you wait for Sally to come.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy,&quot; you said. Picking up a plush mouse and running out of your room.</p>
