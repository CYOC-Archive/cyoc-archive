<br/>
Thanks to Leezardman&#39;s <em>Relieving Tension</em> and Dragonman&#39;s <em>Constant Unsatiable Urges</em>.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You just couldn&#39;t bring yourself to face them right now. You could feel how much you have lost now. Your name had no meaning, your human form, <i>gone</i>.<br />
<br />
Through all this moody depression, your feet couldn&#39;t have chosen a better time to suddenly become so, <i>so</i> cold. You wrap your coils around you more, tightening it up to at least bring warmth. However, the moment your coils brushed against your legs, you hiss a small gasp. Your cocks sprung up, suddenly hard and throbbing to a point that it was almost painful. It was a good thing that all of it was underneath your snake coils.<br />
<br />
Sam and Alex stared at you, worried. You had just hissed at apparently nothing, and your facial expression was more shock than anger. Sam decided to speak up, &quot;Hey, you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, if its my fault its okay to tell me you know?&quot; Alex pleaded, rubbing the back of his head in bashful apology. You hiss, shaking your head that <i>its fine</i>. <br />
<br />
<i>Lies</i><br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s <em>it</em>. If you&#39;re not going to tell us anything, then we&#39;re all done here. Lets go.&quot; Sam huffed, crossing her arms and walking towards the door. &quot;Come on. We have work to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
You try to ignore her, profanities flying around in your head as pleasure overwhelms your thoughts, fogging up like a too cold windshield. Whenever your tail brushes against them, your cocks erupt in <i>pleasure</i>.<br />
<br />
Diverting your thoughts away from your feet in fear that your new friends would find it disgusting that you hold an apparently severe case of foot fetish, you uncoil yourself, slowly.<br />
<br />
You had been laying on the floor, your body cushioned with your own tail. Your thoughts still clouded, you gaze upon Alex&#39;s feline feet. Following the appendage, you admire his feline rod and ball sacks, travelling upwards towards his majestic, <em>powerful</em> muscles.<br />
<br />
You want them...<br />
<br />
No, you <i>needed</i> them.<br />
<br />
You switch sights to the next beauty, her slender form and voluptuous body accented by leaking breasts and slit. They drip to the floor, and your balls gurgle in readiness.<br />
<br />
Your balls rumble quietly, your twitching cocks threatening to gush out yellow goo any second just by looking at them both.<br />
<br />
You shut your eyes tight, trying to regain your rationale. You really wanted sex?! This was clearly not the time!<br />
<br />
You curse yourself in your head, every negative word coming to mind. Now it was inevitable. They would laugh at you endlessly. <br />
<br />
Hissing in the unexpected effort to even lift up your body, you flinch as your tail brushes against the soles of your feet, yellow latex slightly spurting from your di-phallia. <br />
<br />
You shakily get to your feet, giving out a relieved sigh as no pleasure appears to come. <br />
<br />
You&#39;re blessed.<br />
<br />
Sudden, gripping <i>cold</i> assaults the soles of your feet, sending pleasure straight to your brain centers.<br />
<br />
More or less <i>cursed</i>.<br />
<br />
Instantly you collapse back to the floor landing onto your stomach, writhing in pleasure. Loud squeaking results from your twin dicks and balls rubbing against the floor, only causing more bliss.<br />
<br />
As if to spite you, no yellow rubber spurts out from your dicks.<br />
<br />
“What the hell is wrong with you?!” Sam yells, turning around at the sudden noise.<br />
<br />
“Is he having a seizure or something?” Alex asks in fear.<br />
<br />
The purple lizard angrily walks over to you, with a hint of worry on her face.<br />
<br />
However, her anger and fear quickly dissipates as she looks into your eyes, and down at your groin. A mischievous grin crosses her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... It seems our slithery friend here is having some... <i>troubles</i>.&quot; She points a claw to your erect twin rods. Alex recoils. You give a nervous hiss and hide your face behind your hands. <br />
<br />
A loud gurgle from your balls resonates throughout the room, embarrassing you even more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eugh! Martin? That&#39;s...&quot; The tiger trails off and looks away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought he was immune or something!&quot; He yells. Sam shakes her head. &quot;Like anyone could be immune to this. I&#39;m assuming you haven&#39;t experienced this <i>part</i> of being a latex animal.&quot; Sam smirks as she revealed that information, Alex tilting his head in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s just say, this state causes some parts of your body to be unbearably sensitive, so sensitive that it is… sexually stimulating.&quot; You hiss shyly as you try to not stare at her reptilian feet. <br />
<br />
“Not to mention making you very horny.” She grins. <br />
<br />
“It probably has to be due to the massive amounts of latex our new forms produce. If you haven&#39;t noticed tiger, these ladies are still leaking.” She accentuates by pointing to her breasts.<br />
<br />
“And it seems Martin here has so much built up latex that it&#39;s clouding his thoughts.&quot; She looks down at you. &quot;Am I <i>right</i>?&quot; She grins as you reply with a sluggish nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then again if you&#39;ve managed to ignore it for this long you must be something.&quot; Sam admires that aspect, clapping sarcastically. You look away sheepishly.<br />
<br />
“Well we can&#39;t get anything done with those two <i>pillars</i> of yours standing so tall. Get ready.” She grins as she walked towards you.<br />
<br />
You shield your face behind your coils and hiss timidly.<br />
<br />
“Um… You&#39;re not going to--”<br />
<br />
“Of course I am. Did you have any idea how many monsters I rode when I was that dragon&#39;s slave?” Cutting the tiger&#39;s sentence off and positioning herself over your dicks.<br />
<br />
“Mmm…” She brings one of her claws and trails it down one of your cocks, causing you to shiver. <br />
<br />
“I suppose you really were hiding something from me! None of those drones could compare to these bad boys.” She admires sultrily, lusts apparent in her eyes.<br />
<br />
She lowers herself onto your rods, her own juices lubing your cocks as it neared her clit. It went in with a single <i>squeak</i>. &quot;<i>Ahhh~</i>&quot; <br />
<br />
Sam moaned as the rods stretch her to her fullest, not even halfway down the rod. She presses further, you hissing at the tightness.<br />
<br />
She brings your free rod up her to mouth and begins to slowly lick it with her forked tongue. You give a sensual hiss and wiggle your toes, sinking them into your coils.<br />
<br />
You look at her three toed reptilian feet bashfully. Sam appeared to take notice, and winked at you devilishly.<br />
<br />
“My my, seems like somebody has a liking for feet.” She pointed out with a grin. She lifts one of her feet up to your snout. “Well, I won&#39;t stop you snake boy.” <br />
<br />
You bring your hands up to her feet, a slight smile crossing your face. She gives a smile as you pressed your clawed thumb into her sole.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the massaging turned into licking, with you savoring her taste. Your forked tongue worked its way down to her toes, going in between. Your eyes almost rolled back into your head. <br />
<br />
Your orbs groaned as she continued to ride your dick, the other now being sucked off. You hiss blissfully as her own tail wraps around your still sensitive feet, the tip caressing your soles. Loud squeaking echoes throughout the room.<br />
<br />
Instantly your members spurt out globs of yellow latex. The lizard woman gives a muffled moan as the latex fills her from both ends. You give a muffled hiss in response, her entire foot inside your mouth. You had unhinged your jaw in the moment, getting her leg swallowed up to her thighs.<br />
<br />
A mix of yellow and purple latex drips from her pussy and trickles down your rod onto your stomach and the tiled floor below.<br />
<br />
Sam pants as she releases your other dick from her mouth. You slowly let her foot go from your mouth, but not before giving it one last lick.<br />
<br />
“That was quite a show, Martin.” Sam praised you as you shyly hiss back. The fog from your mind is now temporarily gone. <br />
<br />
A loud roar suddenly pierces through the room. <br />
<br />
You and Sam both lay eyes on Alex, the white tiger standing on a puddle of white latex at his feet, his large dick still dripping. He pants and growls, not realizing your show had ended.<br />
<br />
He comes to his senses, immediately blushing when he notices that both of you are now staring.<br />
<br />
“So, you like to watch? I can&#39;t blame you.” Sam turns to her partner, still panting.<br />
<br />
“Umm…. I…” <br />
<br />
“Oh don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s perfectly <i>normal</i>.” She cuts him off. She slowly picks herself off of you and stands up.<br />
<br />
You hiss as you rise up from the floor. Once on your feet, you flex them as you feel no pleasure. You give a thumbs up to your friends.<br />
<br />
“Well, now that we got that issue out of the way we need to clean this up.” Sam declares, motioning to your yellow residue.<br />
<br />
“Eh?.. Why?” Alex asks. Sam sighs as if the reason wasn&#39;t obvious.<br />
<br />
“Oh I don&#39;t know, so the others can&#39;t track us. It seems Martin here is the only one with yellow latex. Ours don&#39;t need to be cleaned, there&#39;s a ton of other purple and white animals.”<br />
<br />
“Um… Shouldn&#39;t they be here any second though? That whole session had a lot of squeaking, hissing, and moaning…” The tiger nervously asks, glancing at the door. Sam shrugs. &quot;I mean, I even <i>roared</i>!&quot;<br />
<br />
“Oh please. If you were to listen closely you&#39;d probably hear another pair of drones going at it down the hallway. There&#39;s more throughout the entire mansion as well. I&#39;d know. I was one of them.” She said matter-of-factly. The feline stares dumbfounded.<br />
<br />
She looks down at the yellow latex in thought.<br />
<br />
“You know, I must say after consuming your essence I feel quite refreshed.” Sam admitted, licking some scraps. &quot;Rejuvenated even!&quot;<br />
<br />
You hiss confused as she looks at Alex with a wink.<br />
<br />
“Hey tiger, come have a sip.” He steps back in shock.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, <i>what</i>?” Alex recoiled at such suggestion.<br />
<br />
“You heard me kitty. You need some of this. Going by our theory, the yellow latex should prevent us from losing our sanity.” Sam explains. Alex tugs at his ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wasn&#39;t I like, <i>transformed</i> into this with his essence?&quot; Alex questioned, and Sam stood dumbfounded. &quot;Oh...&quot; <br />
<br />
Sam then grinned, shrugging. &quot;I guess, but I don&#39;t think your essence can be used to keep your friends sane. Lets say, this is a contingency plan.&quot; She motioned to her quite swollen belly. &quot;An emergency storage. If we&#39;re separated and I find your friends on the way to be transformed I can just regurgitate Martin&#39;s essence on them&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at Sam at such a genius idea. Alex seemed unsure, but he reluctantly gives in.<br />
<br />
“F-Fine…” He stammers, knowing that it was futile to argue and it held credit.<br />
<br />
He slowly walks over to the puddle of yellow rubber and stares at it. The white tiger glances at you, unsure. You shrug. <i>Its your choice</i>.<br />
<br />
He gives a defeated sigh as he gets to his knees and begins to lap up the yellow goo. His rough tongue makes short work of the pool, the latex never once splitting up, everything going up and into his mouth in a steady stream, like eating and not breaking up any loamy noodles. <br />
<br />
“Good job, tiger.” Sam grins as the puddle begins to shrink. <br />
<br />
Soon the puddle disappears into the maw of the beast, stored.<br />
<br />
Alex pants as he wipes some leftover latex off of his muzzle. “That didn&#39;t taste too bad…” He admitted. “I guess I feel better too.”<br />
<br />
Slowly the three of you turn towards the door to the hallway. <br />
<br />
“So um… Now that we&#39;ve got that out of the way can we go find my friends? I&#39;m sure they&#39;re here already...” Alex shifts in place, worried.<br />
<br />
“A gut feeling?” Sam asks, turning to the tiger. The feline nods. “Very well then. Let&#39;s go.” She looks at you, expecting your decision. <br />
<br />
You nod and begin walk to the door, with Alex following anxiously.<br />
<br />
“Wait.” Sam suddenly halts, causing you to turn around. &quot;What now?&quot; Alex grumbled.<br />
<br />
She points to your massive tail now splayed on the floor, long and stretched out.<br />
<br />
“Martin, that long tail of yours will cause the others to be able to easily see you, especially if we&#39;re running.&quot; You look to your tail, and it is actually quite revealing. &quot;Try wrapping it around your neck like a scarf or something.”  Her suggestion got you thinking, and you shrug.<br />
<br />
Complying, you throw it over your shoulder and begin a tedious process of wrapping it around yourself.<br />
<br />
You nod to her as you finish.<br />
<br />
“Now we can go.” Sam grinned as she surveys your funny form. Alex grinned a toothy grin, holding back a laugh.<br />
<br />
You look towards both of them, eyes narrowing.<br />
<br />
Slowly opening the door, you poke your head out. Your reptilian eyes scan the expansive hallway and see no sign of any latex animals.<br />
<br />
Stepping out, you signal for Sam and Alex to follow. <br />
<br />
Then you hiss in surprise as you hear footsteps from the corner of the hall.</p>
