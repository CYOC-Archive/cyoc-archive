<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Uhh.... cake. Why?&quot; Asked Red, cautiously placing the basket behind her back. She actually set it down on top of her ass, but still held on to the handle so it didn&#39;t fall if she had to move. This isn&#39;t the first time, nor the last time, that she would use her booty as a shelf. Due to her vastly different diameters of her belly and her hips, she had a nice bit of real estate to use too. She had the waist of a super model, and the hips of a hippo, almost jutting out at a 90 degree angle from her waist. This trait was a common thing for all Duncan women, and it even worked it&#39;s way into the bakery&#39;s emblem.<br />
<br />
Now, comparatively, Red could be considered flat chested if you use the size of her ass as a comparison, but she actually wasn&#39;t small up top either. He twin FF cups were proudly standing on her chest, pushing out into 2 orbs of soft, jiggling goodness, with just enough firmness to retain their shape and not sag. But again, even with breasts this big, they were nothing compared to her ass. Their is a &quot;myth&quot; in the town that says when the town was being built, all of the roads were cut by her distant ancestor&#39;s ass waddling around the forest. And that her ass was so massive that all of the trees in her way would literally fall from being pushed by it. Whether that is true or not is up for debate, but the Duncan woman take pride in the hope that it is the truth. <br />
<br />
The wolf eyed Red up and down. &quot;Hmpf, you aren&#39;t so bad for a Duncan girl. I have seen the old one walk through here plenty of times. But her cake isn&#39;t as fresh as yours. So hand it over.&quot; Demanded the wolf, licking his lips right after. Red was scared, and answered &quot;No! This cake is for my Grandma! You can&#39;t have it!&quot; and started backing away. The wolf, being larger and faster than the girl, circled around to her backside to cut off her escape.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now, that old lady has no need for cake as nice as yours. Tell you what, how about just a taste, and then I will let you go, but only if you promise to let me have another taste every day from now on.&quot; Suggested the Wolf.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Fine, but just a taste.&quot; Said Red, as she pulled the basket out from behind her. While she was reaching into it, she felt something suddenly start poking her ass. &quot;Hey what... What are you doing!&quot; She shouted. The wolf was down on all fours sniffing her ass with his nose buried deep into the seam of her ass. The wolf pulls out his nose and grins  &quot;Wonderful, I have not had a Duncan before, but I have heard their cake is the best around.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that certainly is true. But hey! What has that got to do with my ass!&quot; Asked Red, turning red in the face and turning around to face the wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything, sweetheart.&quot; Said the wolf, as he grabbed her basket and knocked her to the ground. He set the basket down and took the spot between her legs. Red was still trying to get back up, and was down on her stomach when she heard a loud rip, as a brand new hole was torn in her underwear. Then came the cold wet feeling of the wolfman&#39;s nose and tongue, sniffing her ass and licking her futa sex. Red was scared and nervous, but also, slowly getting horny. The wolfman&#39;s tongue was not too bad. Different from her fingers, but still quite good feeling. A little too good feeling actually. As the wet tongue lapped at her pussy and the underside side of orange sized balls, Red grew hornier and hornier.<br />
<br />
Most of Red&#39;s resistance melted away, save for her weak attempts to stand up, or to move away. As her horniness grew, her willingness to just submit to the wolfman also rose, until she no longer was moving to escape, but to give him a better angle. Her cries turned into moans, rage into lust, and the last of her already weakened resistance became a burning need. She widened her stance, allowing the beast to have even better access to her drooling slit. Sure their conversation may have been a huge misunderstanding on what the meaning of her &#39;cake&#39; implied, but she did agree to let him have a taste...<br />
<br />
She was actually starting to look forward to what was to come next. She always had a thing for boys who are strong, tall, and direct, even if just a little bit too forward. Sure he is a wolfman, but he sure fit her bill perfectly everywhere else. Plus, going by the size of his reputation, Red wondered if his dick was equally as big and bad too, hopefully. And then he pulled away from her. &#39;This is it! I am finally losing my virginity!&#39; Red thought with excited anticipation. Her pussy was soaking wet and ready, while her cock was fully erect and drooling precum. She closed her eyes and waited. Only, nothing happened. After a minute passed, Red opened her eyes and looked behind her only to see the empty forest. The wolfman was gone. &quot;Hey! Where did you go?&quot; She shouted, while not leaving her current pose, in hopes that he would be still nearby and come back. <br />
<br />
But he never did. She waited for 10 more minutes just standing on all fours, with her ass raised and her legs spread. But he never came back. &quot;He really only wanted a taste...&quot; she said, feeling rather disappointed. But then she remembered the deal, and smiled. He would be back tomorrow for more. And she would be sure to have plenty of &quot;fresh cake&quot; for him to sample too. She found it somewhat ironic how she went from being absolutely terrified of him at first, to now eagerly looking forward to meeting him again tomorrow.<br />
<br />
She took out a napkin from the basket and wiped herself off, then with a sly grin, dropped it on the ground as a form of &quot;offering&quot; to her newfound companion as a bit of a teaser for tomorrow. Then she brushed herself off, and took the right path after noticing the arrow carved into the side of a tree behind the sign post with a big G above it. <br />
<br />
Her skirt had a notable center ridge poking out in front of her too. She was still hard as a rock with the memory of what just nearly happened to her, and the lust that she had built up that still was left unsatisfied. Her balls ached just a bit as she walked. Tomorrow for sure, she would definitely make sure that she either gets fucked by him willingly, or she would make him fuck her by forcing herself onto him. Either way, his dick would be inside of her, one way or another.<br />
<br />
When she was out of sight the wolfman reappeared from behind a nearby tree. He picked up her discarded napkin and licked it. &quot;Hmm, I can see now why people love those Duncan girl&#39;s cake. I am glad I managed to secure her first before anyone else got to try her out. She seemed eager as well. Perhaps tomorrow I will sample just a bit more of your cake, Red. I am looking forward to what you bring for me to try.&quot;</p>
