<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I closed my eyes partly because of the blinding flash but mostly because I didn't want to witness my transition into girlhood. I knew I definitely begun changing though. I felt my hands being pulled up my shirt's sleeves as my arms shortened. Up until few minutes ago the shirt was the right size for me. In fact it was even begging to get too small and I remember my mother asking me to throw it away already. Now it was out of use for a completely opposite reason.<br />
<br />
With my eyes closed, the tactile sensations became my only way of determining how far the transformation has progressed. All over my skin I felt a sensation similar to the feeling of hairs standing up when you're cold but... opposite. I guessed it was my body hair disappearing into nothing. The exception was my scalp where I felt my hair growing. Yet another thing confirming I was becoming a girl! I screamed inside...<br />
<br />
I felt some strange barely noticeable movements under my skin which probably corresponded to my muscles reshaping and inevitably shrinking. I started to feel how my clothes' weight, previously negligible, now actually mattered something for the first time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh... Josh...&quot; I heard Alice's voice. It sounded quiet, distant and then disappeared.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My feet tingled much more than they should for the change I imagined was happening. I wiggled my toes. They didn't even touch the sides of my shoes! How small could they be? Will I even be able to walk normally?<br />
<br />
There was also the strange feeling in my groin. I was too terrified to focus on it though. I didn't want to know what was happening there. I couldn't accept the thought of losing the very thing defined me as a man.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt my pants and boxers falling down as my butt became too small to keep them in place. Then all the weird tingling associated with transformation ceased.<br />
<br />
I opened my eyes.<br />
<br />
Firstly that wasn't my room. Secondly everything looked huge.<br />
<br />
There was a desk. The one I had in my room reached to my mid-thigh but this one was on the same level as my waist. I looked up at my wardrobe trying to guess my new height. I couldn't be taller than 4'10''!<br />
<br />
Oh God, I knew I was getting shorter but why did I have to end up THAT tiny?<br />
<br />
I looked down at my body to survey the damage but the only thing I saw was my shirt as baggy as if I wore an empty potato sack on me instead.<br />
<br />
I took my shirt and shoes off because my pants and boxers were off already. My feet slid out of the shoes without any resistance whatsoever, but the shirt was a bit of a problem. When I was finally naked I gasped.<br />
<br />
I was tiny. Now it wasn't just because of my height but also of how small overall I was.<br />
<br />
&quot;But... But this is ridiculous! I can't weight more than 85lbs!&quot; I whispered &quot;No wonder I found my old clothes heavy with those arms thin like sticks!&quot;<br />
<br />
That was true. My arms were very thin but not in an angular and bony way which could serve as a symptom of anorexia. They were soft and delicate, ended with small, long-fingered hands. I had a retro long-gloves model arms. There was also the other thing. When I looked to the side I almost couldn't see my shoulders. Women obviously have them narrower but I never expected the difference to feel that alien.<br />
<br />
The other thing that surprised me was how pale my skin was. Again, my skins' color didn't look like a sign of illness, it looked more like this sort of alabaster-white complexion red-haired people sometimes tend to have. I reached behind and took a strand of my newly grown hair.<br />
<br />
Yep, I was officially a red-hair. I saw my hair - slightly wavy and in a shade of bright copper. As I let it go I felt it brush the top of my butt. Shit. And it's LONG...<br />
<br />
If in my situation there was anything I possibly could be glad for it was the fact that I certainly did not posses a womanly shape. But I knew that was going to change soon - today was supposed to be my breastgiving day...<br />
<br />
I noticed that sub-consciously I tried to keep my chest forward, with my back arched is a wide curve. Apparently the Mother Nature wanted to compensate this girl's, mine, lack of real boobies by pushing what was there more into people's view. I tried to change my position the position but I didn't manage to keep it for long before it started to hurt. Fuck. So now I have to walk around like this. Proud as hell of my still flat tiny ribcage.<br />
<br />
As I looked down I saw a patch of red hair in my crotch and nothing dangling form it. &quot;Of course there is nothing dangling there you idiot! There's nothing to dangle now!&quot; I thought &quot;You're a girl and they don't have a willy to stick out of their pubic hair!&quot; I knew that if I looked into the hair, if I touched my groin I would not find anything but womanly parts. The thing was I had never seen real ones in my life and I definitely didn't feel like seeing the first ones on myself. I felt sick of the thought so I went on with the inspection.<br />
<br />
I possessed boyish hips but my ass was nicely rounded and bubble-shaped. It stuck three or four inches behind me in a way I was not used to. I felt it jiggle when I moved slightly. &quot;Oh God, it looks just like if someone sewn two water balloons under my skin!&quot; I thought wondering how it wold feel to sit on this cute, a little bit too soft ass...<br />
<br />
My thighs were thin but my calves were another thing. They were very shapely, as if made for walking in high heels. Not that I wanted ones.<br />
<br />
And then there were my feet. I was afraid they were going to end up too small when I was still changing with my eyes closed. I was right. They were the set of most petite and delicate feet I've seen in my life, both online and in real-life. They seemed too small even for a girl of my size. And they were delicate... God, I've became a foot-fetishist wet dream. They didn't feel much different though. Nothing that would indicate that today was indeed supposed to be my breastgiving. So maybe there was still hope...<br />
<br />
I decided I want to see my face. As I made my first step towards the mirror I noticed that I delicately tiptoed instead of placing my feet flat. Does it mean I am a natural high heel girl? I wouldn't know...<br />
<br />
When I first saw myself in a mirror there was this one thing that struck me: God, I was freckled. Freckles covered almost my whole face, went down my lean neck to then spread on my narrow shoulders where they changed into the smooth white complexion I had seen before. The thing was they looked good. I wasn't really into gingers, but my pale freckled complexion combined with the redness of my hair created a perfect match. Then there were rather average lips, a small up-turned nose, and big green eyes. The red color of my eyebrows combined with the freckled background of my skin made them almost invisible.<br />
<br />
I looked deep into the red-haired cuteness' eyes in the mirror and then I realized who was this girl I had became. She was cute and innocent, simply made to submissiveness. She was weak physically and probably upset of the lack of womanly attributes all her peers were getting. She could be some guy's toy and she wouldn't be able to do anything about it...<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care what you say. We are going to the beach now!&quot; I heard a deep male voice. It scared me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Unlock the door! It seems that they shut close when I left the room&quot; it asked.<br />
<br />
My dainty hand rested on the door knob and then I felt the petite muscles in my arm work as I opened the door letting my... boyfriend... Mark in...</p>
