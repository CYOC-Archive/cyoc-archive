<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"> When Ryan got home, he felt better than he could remember ever feeling.  He kept playing it over and over again in his mind, the confused looks on their faces, how it came together so perfectly, and finally the two of them tugging on their little hump stumps trying to get them bigger.  He climbed up into the bedroom and sat on his bed, thinking of it all again for what must have been the thousandth time. The feeling of the power he had over them, how quickly he had completely up ended their reality was a huge turn on for him.  The entire experience left Ryan rock hard.  The twins were out cleaning the barn and his parents were working in the field, so slid his jeans and boxers down and started rubbing his dick.  <br />
<br />
  Ryan wrapped his entire left hand around his unit, it easily covered the entire thing. Ryan stopped and thought about how devastated Jeff and Dave with their new little dicks.  He had never given his size much thought. He knew he was on the smaller side from what he had seen in the locker room and swimming. He and his friends Aj and Charlie compared once two years ago, he was the smallest but not by much.  Maybe it was because of this knowledge that he didn&#39;t focus so much attention on it.  Ryan loved jacking off and he had to imagine sex was even better. He just figured you got what you got down there and so there was no reason to waste time wondering why or what could have been. That wasn&#39;t the case anymore, though. He could change it.  Ryan thought about it. Height, weight, muscle mass and changing the twins should be done slowly to draw it out the enjoyment of it and make it look like he&#39;s just growing naturally, but who actually saw his penis.  He couldn&#39;t remember the last time he knew someone got a good look at (since the comparing incident). People have probably caught glimpses while he was changing or when he got in and out of the barn shower, but thats about it. What was the point in increasing it slowly? He could give himself a bonus now and still follow the rest of his plan with the other changes. He released his grip around his now throbbing cock and smiled at it. He reached over and grabbed his back pack, pulled out the chronivac and booted it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Battery at 90%, Hello&quot; blah, blah, blah Ryan thought as he got to the map and found himself.  He went right to his genitals and pulled up the options screen.<br />
<br />
Penis, Hard: 3.2” Inches<br />
Penis, Soft: 2.0&quot; Inches  <br />
Penis Girth, soft: 2.25&quot; Inches<br />
Penis Girth, hard: 3.15&quot; Inches<br />
Testicles: 1&quot; (marble)<br />
Sensitivity: 77 (1-100)<br />
Recharge time: 4 minutes<br />
<br />
 The list went on. The options and combinations were almost limitless. There wasn&#39;t going to be any restraint here. Ryan could feel his heart beating faster with anticipation.  Did he want to be a grower or show it all. Where to begin, where to begin? He started with his soft size. He wanted to wow people who stole glances, he wanted to make them study it.  8 inches should do the trick, a full 12 when its hard. Now for girth, hard he wanted it thick like a louisville slugger, soft more the size of a soda bottle. He made his balls the size of nectarines, he figured if it worked for Dave it would work for him too.  He turned down the sensitivity a 20 points so he wouldn&#39;t get embarrassing erections in class anymore, but left the rest as it was. The countdown began and Ryan stared at his unit.<br />
<br />
 The warmth started in his shaft and spread out from there.  The electric feeling spread and grew stronger as he watched his dick double and then triple in size and girth only to keep growing. There were two pop sounds as each of his balls expanded in an instant expanding his sack with them. It was all over in a few seconds, Ryan couldn&#39;t believe it. He stood up to see how it looked hanging between his legs.  It stuck out a a little more than an inch and then dropped towards the floor. His new cock was heavier than he was use to, he was almost afraid to touch it. It started to get stiff, instead of pointing down it pointed straight out from his body. He swore he could feel his new nuts churning out cum just waiting to be shot out of his cannon cock, his bazooka, his boyzooka. He wrapped his left hand around the base and his right hand right above it.  He couldn&#39;t make his fingers touch his thumb. He started moving his hands up and down his hefty cock.  It didn&#39;t take long. His hips started to flex and his ass clenched. He started to moan, loudly. He sprayed out rope after rope of hot jazz all over his bed. The orgasm was mind-blowing, Ryan tried to keep his eyes on his &#39;boyzooka&#39; (the nickname might stick) but they rolled back into his head as he emptied his sack.  He opened his eyes and looked at the mess he made.  He was standing facing his bed naked from the waste down in front of a cum soaked comforter.  &quot;Holy shit,&quot; Ryan panted, &quot;I&#39;m never going to get tired of doing that.&quot; He put his pants back on and tucked the the Chronivac back in his backpack.  Today he would relax, tomorrow he&#39;d get start on his brothers.</p>
