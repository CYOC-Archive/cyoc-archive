<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days later I anxiously knocked on the door to the small windowless meeting room. A middle aged man answered. “Ah you must be the new member,” he beckoned me inside “I’m Stan, Welcome, welcome, come in, take a seat!” As I stepped past him he poked his head out, peering down both sides of the corridor before shutting the door behind him. I took a seat between an elderly man and a nervous looking guy maybe a few years younger than me.<br />
<br />
 “Okay I think we can get started” Stan announced as he came over to the circle. “Welcome to the Society of Humiliation Reduction to Increase Micro-Penis Size, our mission here is to support each other through the process of making our penises grow to average length. Lets all go around and anyone who wants to can give a brief introduce ourselves to our new member. My name is Stan, I am the organizer for S.H.R.I.M.P.S in this region and have been a part of the society for 20 years. My penis is currently 3.5 inches when erect. It’s been 187 days since my last SPH induced ejaculation.”<br />
<br />
“Twenty years!?” I asked incredulously, “You haven’t been able to last twelve months in all that time!?”<br />
<br />
“Uhh well accidents happen, and we all slip up once in a while.” Stan said blushing. “Just six months ago I was getting changed at the gym when my towel slipped. Everyone saw my little dick and started making fun of me. I ejaculated on the spot. Had to switch gyms after that.”<br />
<br />
“Wait why didn’t you get changed in the stall?” I asked incredulous.<br />
<br />
“Well I’m not going to let my tiny penis run my life!” Stan argued defensively “Why shouldn’t I get changed out in the open with all the real- uhh *other* men! Anyway enough about me, who else would like to share this week?”<br />
<br />
A young man on the other side of the circle stood up “Yes, hi, my names Henry and even though I’ve been a member of S.H.R.I.M.P.S for a year I still haven&#39;t made a single month of progress. I was exposed at my high-school graduation, I was naked under my gown, and a gust of wind lifted it right up exposing my dink penis to everyone. I haven’t been able to grow over half an inch since.”<br />
<br />
“Wait why weren’t you wearing pants at your graduation?”<br />
<br />
“It was a dare!” He responded, “And I couldn’t say no or they’d suspect I was a small-dick.”<br />
<br />
The others in the group nodded sympathetically, one older man spoke up. “It’s very hard to get over that initial hurdle when you’re young and horny but we’re sure you’ll get there eventually. And keeping up the appearances of being a normal dick is a very fine line.”<br />
<br />
The meeting continued as more S.H.R.I.M.P.S members introduced themselves and talked about what problems they had during the week. Some of them made my stiff cocklet twitch and leak into my underwear with their dirty stories. When it was my turn to share my experience, I recounted the events with Larry, leaving out the part about the book. Everyone listened with rapt attention and I could swear I heard a moan escape from Henry when I was done. Finally we came to the last man, he was balding and looked to be in his late thirties<br />
<br />
“Now Brad I know you don’t like to brag.” Stan encouraged him, “But it’s important for the newer members to see the results of perseverance. Please share your success with the group.”<br />
<br />
Brad gulped and nodded, standing up. I could see he actually had a visible tent in his pants. “I’m Bradley and after over a decade, I believe this will be my final S.H.R.I.M.P.S meeting. It’s almost been a year since I last ejaculated from an SPH experience and by this time tomorrow I’ll have reached the full seven inches that mean I am no longer a small-dick!” everyone gave a polite round of applause. I saw a few men shooting jealous looks at his groin.<br />
<br />
“Congratulations, Bradley, we’re all very proud of you and wish you the best for the future.” Stanley said, standing up and clapping him on the shoulder “Though we will no longer see you here, I hope that even when you are no longer a small-dick, you endeavor to help out any small-dicks you come across.”<br />
<br />
“Haha, yea...” Bradley responded. I could sense some sort of trepidation in his voice.<br />
<br />
Afterwards Stan lead us in some mental exercises. One of the younger members had a question about stuffing their swimsuit for an upcoming beach trip. I learned a lot of things that I thought might really help me through the week. <br />
<br />
About ten minutes before the end of the meeting Stan announced it was time for the weekly affirmation. Everyone else in the circle stood up and pulled their pants down exposing a whole range of pitiful wieners. Henry was the only half incher. When he removed his pants I could&#39;ve sworn I saw a white droplet leak out but he quickly wiped it up and no one else seemed to notice or at least they didn’t mention it. There were a two other inch longs like mine.  The rest ranged between one and five inches, except for Bradley who was clearly the biggest at around six and a half inches hard.<br />
<br />
“what’s happening” I asked still seated and confused.<br />
<br />
“Ah I should explain.” Stan replied as he started to rub his modest penis to a semi-hard two inch wiener  “Every week we have what we call an exposure session. By showing our penis’s to each other we reaffirm our pride so that we can better resist against any humiliations we might come across until next week. It also acts as a group masturbatory session, so we can have a safe, uplifting and supportive environment in which to relieve sexual tension. This is especially useful for the members who don’t have access to anti-orgasm medication.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know…”<br />
<br />
“Please trust us, in showing us your penis not only do you take pride in your meager manhood, it will encourage your fellow members with a display of confidence despite your size.”<br />
<br />
I guess that made sense. Anything to help with the humiliating thoughts that clouded my day to day life. I undid my pants and poked my dicklet out of my zipper.<br />
<br />
“I recommend you pull your pants all the way down and lift your shirt all the way up,” I saw a lot of men had their shirts pulled up behind their necks or completely removed. “You have to convince yourself that you have nothing to hide.”<br />
<br />
I followed Stan’s instructions and was soon shirtless with my pants around my ankles.<br />
<br />
“Okay everyone repeat after me” Stan started. “I have started on the path to a less humiliating life.”<br />
<br />
The group chanted in unison as the sound go squishing filled the room with some of the guys tugging on their dripping penises.<br />
<br />
“Just those one inch and under now;” Stan continued, “Though my journey has just begun I know the long road ahead will be worth it in the end”<br />
<br />
Me, Henry and a few other nub dick men repeated the line in unison.<br />
<br />
“Okay now the one to six inchers; I take pride in the progress I have made so far in becoming a better man”<br />
<br />
The majority of the group nodded in agreement as they echoed Stanley.<br />
<br />
“Now just the over sixes; My hard work stands as evidence of what can be achieved with perseverance.”<br />
<br />
Bradley was the only one who spoke the last line.<br />
“Okay everyone together now” Stan was panting heavily as he slowly stroked his little stiffy, “I have a small penis now, but one day it will grow to reflect the man I am inside. My penis is nothing to be ashamed of.”<br />
<br />
Everyone spoke together “I have a small penis n-” *BANG* Suddenly the door burst open. <br />
<br />
“OVER HERE! I FOUND ‘EM!”</p>
