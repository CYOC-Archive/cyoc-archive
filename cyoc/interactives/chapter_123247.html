<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the data transfer finished to the flash card, Officer George Leprune said, &quot;At some point I will need to talk to that weretiger couple and get their statements, especially if that red haired girl is who I think she is.&quot;<br />
&quot;Melissa Jenkins,&quot; said werevixen Megumi Tachibana. &quot;The tigers are her father Harold and his new fiance, Virginia McCoy.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes. I know the names. I&#39;ve been keeping myself up to date on anything involving Alice Decrux,&quot; replied Leprune. &quot;We&#39;ll still need the punch tested to make sure, but I definitely have enough to bring Decrux in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Then I&#39;ll talk to Jenkins and McCoy, while you go after Decrux,&quot; offered high school principal Ian Andrews. &quot;We can&#39;t have anything like this happening, especially involving minors, normals, and <i>Love Potion #9</i>.&quot;*<br />
&quot;Agreed. But the near mishap with Melissa Jenkins, that&#39;s the only situation involving a normal tonight?&quot; Leprune wanted to know.<br />
&quot;That I know of,&quot; said Andrews, while turning to look at Megumi.<br />
&quot;When we searched the woods looking for Mel, we didn&#39;t see any other normals. Just lots of horny weres... you know,&quot; replied the young relative of Tachibana no Akane.<br />
&quot;Good. Then I&#39;m going after Decrux. I&#39;ll make arrangements to collect official statements from everyone involved sometime tomorrow. But for now, I better get after Decrux,&quot; said Leprune, as he turned to leave the school&#39;s security office.<br />
&quot;I better have a quick chat with that young werefox to make sure he cooperates honestly and doesn&#39;t try to embellish anything,&quot; realized Gorou Tachibana, Megumi&#39;s father.<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll go talk to the weretigers,&quot; said Principal Andrews, as he put the school security system back on monitoring status.<br />
<br />
BACK IN THE GYM....<br />
Weretiger Harold Jenkins was holding weretigress Virginia McCoy close to his furry body, and loving every moment of her pelt against his as they continued to kiss and just stare deeply into each other&#39;s feline eyes.<br />
Harold, pondering the future, had asked his fiance if she wanted to up their wedding plans to become married sooner, and she rapidly agreed.**<br />
They unfortunately couldn&#39;t leave the gym for the night until McCoy&#39;s chaperone duties were over when the dance ended at midnight, which was still almost a full hour away, so settled for just standing near her post at the refreshments table and enjoying each other&#39;s company, when Harold heard a familiar buzzing noise.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve got to figure out something better than just carrying this around with me when I&#39;m furry,&quot; he realized, reaching over to pick up the cellphone he left on the table.<br />
&quot;I have a student who wears his on an over sized lanyard around his neck for whenever he&#39;s in his werewolf fursona,&quot; said Virginia, thinking of Junior Class student Ben Twist, as Harold looked at the text message.<br />
&quot;Bad news?&quot; his fiance asked, when Harold kept staring at his phone for far longer than she thought might be necessary to read a text message.<br />
&quot;DAD: I&#39;M FINE. WITH TREVOR AND WILL BE WHAT I WANT TO BE. LOVE MEL.&quot; he read her.<br />
&quot;And...&quot; wondered Virginia, moving closer to him.<br />
&quot;If she ain&#39;t already, by morning Mel will be happily mooing her head off,&quot; realized Harold, putting the phone back on the table without sending a reply.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Virginia asked cautiously.<br />
&quot;What? Oh, yeah. Sure. Mel&#39;s happy. In love, and will be the were she wants to be,&quot; said Harold. &quot;Trevor Tyson&#39;s a good person, and there&#39;s no denying the feelings those two have for each other. It&#39;s just...&quot;<br />
Then Harold&#39;s voice trailed off.<br />
Virginia waited.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just that our little girl is growing up faster than I&#39;m prepared to face right now,&quot; finally said Harold, as he moved to hold his fiance again.<br />
Virginia never said anything about Harold&#39;s possible slip of the tongue when he said OUR instead of MY. <i>Then again, considering how close we&#39;ve grown together...</i><br />
McCoy just stood there, holding and being held by the man she loved, when she heard someone trying to clear their throat.<br />
The weretigers turned and saw what appeared to be a normal human male adult, trying to get their attention. Virginia recognized him immediately, while a quick but discrete sniff told Harold that the man was just wasn&#39;t displaying his fursona at the moment.<br />
&quot;Sorry for interrupting. Principal Ian Andrews. Not sure you remember me from your daughter&#39;s late registration to our high school,&quot; he said, holding out his hand.<br />
&quot;I recognize the name, but a lot has happened since then,&quot; said Harold, while completing the handshake.<br />
&quot;Of course. Do you and Miss McCoy have a moment? We need to talk,&quot; said the Principal.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;Man, I can&#39;t wait,&quot; said Pete, the self-appointed leader and one of the four were-raccoon boys now in Alice Decrux&#39;s backyard, anxiously awaiting their impending orgy with the sexy MILF.***<br />
&quot;I can tell,&quot; said Jeff, noting that his friend&#39;s boyhood was poking out of its sheath.<br />
&quot;Well at least you two got a tease when she fondled your cocks on the front porch**,&quot; complained Fred. &quot;Larry and I are still out in the cold.&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll all be taken care of soon. I can&#39;t wait to fill ALL of that sexy bitch&#39;s holes,&quot; bragged Pete.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
&quot;How long does it take a female were to take their birth control pill?&quot; wondered Jeff.<br />
&quot;No idea. Dad&#39;s divorced so it&#39;s just me and him, and we certainly don&#39;t need them,&quot; replied Pete.<br />
&quot;Say. There&#39;s four of us and she only has a pussy, ass, and mouth. What does the fourth guy do when the other three are busy?&quot; wondered Larry.<br />
&quot;Wait for someone to finish and then take their place?&quot; suggested Pete.<br />
&quot;And who decides who goes first?&quot; asked Larry.<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; began Pete, making sure that whatever was agreed upon, he got his cock in Decrux&#39;s pussy first, since his dad always told him <i>sloppy seconds</i> were messy and for losers.<br />
Just then the boys heard a twig snap.<br />
They all turned in anticipation of it being the sexy older were-raccoon lady and the start of their impending orgy, but were in a state of shock when a man appeared holding a gun pointed at all of them!<br />
&quot;POLICE! DOWN ON THE GROUND, NOW!&quot; shouted Officer Leprune, who was thankful to have made good time from the high school.<br />
As the four scared boys did as ordered, Leprune couldn&#39;t help wondering who they were and where Alice Decrux was, for her car wasn&#39;t in the driveway.<br />
