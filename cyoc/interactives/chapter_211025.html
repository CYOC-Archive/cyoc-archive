<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Dear Mom and Dad,” Cole scribbled a note of looseleaf paper with a colored pencil, wracking his young mind on how he should break things to his parents. The moonlight played dimly on his blonde hair and pajamas from outside his bedroom window, the seven-year-old boy toying with an orange-colored pill in his other hand as he scratched out his last message to his family.<br />
<br />
“I’m running away from home!” he dictated his message, keeping his voice to a whisper as not to wake anyone up and foil his plans early. “You have so many rules! My bedtime is too early! I can only play an hour of video games a day! You force me to go to school every day without a break! You give me so many chores! I just can’t take it anymore! I hate you and I’m running away and you’ll never see me again!”<br />
<br />
Cole shivered at his bedroom desk as he wrote it, wondering if writing “I hate you” was the last thing he ever wanted to say to his mom and dad. He crossed out that part, adding one last sentence to try to ease their fears. “I will be safe living on my own, I promise.”<br />
<br />
With that, the little boy let his pencil clatter to the side as he rolled the jelly-bean sized pill between his fingers in his other hand, wondering to himself if this was really it – was all there was left to do just to take the pill? He starred at the little tablet as his lifted it to his mouth. His lips parted as he threatened to put the tiny capsule on his tongue, realizing that once he takes this – there wasn’t any turning back.<br />
<br />
Cole’s nerves got the best of him as he set it down, climbing down from the chair and pacing a few times around his bedroom before starring at an orange plush fox laying on his bed. “It’s gonna be okay, right, Foxy?” Cole asked, hopping on his bed and laying a top his favorite stuffed animal, “Being a fox is fun… right?”<br />
<br />
The little boy nuzzled against the well-worn body-sized plush, hoping that somehow Foxy would ease his worries of going through with this. “I’ll just take the pill; change - Then I’ll just escape outside through the cat door. And then I can meet up with all the other foxes and they can take care of me and we can play and…”<br />
<br />
Cole paused his explanation, starring down at the toy he had ever since he was a baby. “You think I should just do it?” Cole asked as if Foxy had answered him, rubbing his nose against the stuffed toy’s snout. “Y-yeah! Okay! Foxes are my favorite animal after all… they’re so cute with those big tails and fuzzy ears…” The boy trailed off, still eskimo kissing his beloved plush as he almost fell asleep on top of its softness. “I’d make a good fox? You think so Foxy?”<br />
<br />
The toy’s beaded eyes looked back at Cole blankly, silently responding to him. “Don’t worry, I’m not gonna leave you. This isn’t goodbye!” Cole reassured the stuffed fox, “I’ll bring you with me! You can vouch for me when we meet the other foxes that live in the woods! We’re best friends, and if I’m a fox, we’ll just be better friends!”<br />
<br />
Cole smiled down at his fox toy, giggling as he planted a lick against its muzzle and hopped off. The boy scooped that orange pill – the one that would change him into an animal. He’d gotten it in a trade from a classmate. Apparently, the kid’s dad was a wizard or a scientist or a wildlife conservationist or… well, it changed every time he asked, but somehow the other boy had swiped some animal pills from his dad – and this one was for a fox! Cole readied the pill in one hand and a bottle of cola in the other. He opened his mouth, placing the tablet on his tongue before taking a swig of soda. And just like that, he swallowed, feeling the pill jostle down his throat, the boy gulping it down with finality.<br />
<br />
The seven-year-old boy polished off the bottle of cola, letting out a quiet burp after emptying it. What now? Cole hadn’t really thought about the actual change. Would it take long? Should he go somewhere? Would it hurt? He added those questions to the others swirling around in his young brain as the nervous boy reached for Foxy. He squeezed it tightly, hugging the big toy to his chest as he stood in front of his bedroom mirror in his tight-fitting pajamas, anxiously anticipating any sign of change. “It’ll all be okay, right, Foxy…? You’ll always be my friend, right?”<br />
<br />
Cole braced himself for what seemed like forever, starring back at himself embracing his favorite stuffed animal. He did feel something… but he wasn’t sure whether it was the butterflies in his stomach or whether he was actually changing. Cole’s sweat stained Foxy’s well-worn fabric as his legs felt like they were starting to tingle. The boy still unsure whether it was a real change, or just his imagination. All the while, he couldn’t help but take in his plush toy’s familiar scent for comfort, Foxy felt so warm and cozy… that it started to make Cole feel strange for the very first time.<br />
<br />
“Hah… Foxy…” Cole sighed, squeezing the plush fox tighter as he leaned it over the bed, resting on top of his plush just like he did every night – but somehow, this was different. The boy blushed as he felt his groin rub against Foxy’s, the alien feeling of an erection starting to grow… the first time it ever happened in his life.<br />
<br />
“Mmmph… wh-what…?” The seven-year-old gasped, feeling a little light-headed as blood rushed to his three-inch prick. Feeling the strange sensation, Cole tugged down his pajama pants just enough to release his adolescent erection, surprised to feel his penis wasn’t the soft flaccidness that it used to be, but had grown plump and firm.<br />
<br />
“Am I… ch-changing?” Cole quivered anxiously, quickly returning to hugging his soft, reassuring stuffed animal for comfort, letting his little cock get cradled by the that fuzzy plushie fur. His hips began to rock back and forth on their own as he sawed his cock against Foxy’s fluff. His breath hastened; his mouth held agape as he started to pant – slivers of drool starting to drip from his lips as he flashed an amorous gaze down on his fox toy. He hadn’t the feintest clue what he was doing – all he knew was that it felt so good! Cole’s budding sexual prowess told him to jackhammer against his childhood plush and he eagerly obeyed, rubbing his cock against Foxy so much that it felt like he needed to pee!<br />
<br />
“Nnugh-“ the boy relented, trying to lift up himself off - to disobey the signals from his loins jolting into his naïve young mind. He didn’t want to pee on Foxy… he wouldn’t like that, right? Budding instincts deep inside him questioned whether that was true, telling the little boy Foxy was his mate, that the plush he was on top of wanted nothing more than to be soaked in Cole’s scent. The seven-year-old just didn’t have the fortitude to question it anymore, holding on tightly to his plush as he humped away at it like a horny puppy.<br />
<br />
“Hah… F-Foxy… hah…” Cole’s tongue hung out as he panted his mate’s name, slamming his hips several more time against Foxy before he couldn’t hold it anymore! Immediately warm liquid hosed from his three-inch cock, drenching his life-long plushie friend. But it didn’t feel like pee at all, it was sticky, coming out in globs every time he thrust against his friend’s cozy fuzz. Cole didn’t have time to think about it, the sheer bliss Foxy was giving him sending his loins into a frenzy as he pumped out his first ever orgasm onto his loving plush.<br />
<br />
As he finished, Cole collapsed onto his stuffed animal, sandwiching his penis between his and Foxy’s belly as his cock was bathed in his own spunk. The room felt like a sauna, the air moist and humid with the smell of sex. Not human – but feral, lust-filled musk.<br />
<br />
Cole suddenly groaned, flopping onto his back as he starred back at his prone body in the mirror. His penis felt funny. It was drenched in a warm glaze of his own cum, his circumcised flesh beginning to feel molten-hot to the touch as the glans started to stretch upward, his urethra extruding out the tip until it took and a distinctly tapered, canine shape. The boy’s belly huffed and heaved as it he watched his cock tip extending, his pitifully thin boyhood beginning to inflate with smooth muscle, growing girthier by the second as that skin pigment shifted from a boring human beige to an animalistic light red.<br />
<br />
Cole seemed to intrinsically know it was a fox’s penis, reaching out a hand to grasp it as it flexed fatter and longer on his tiny palm. Each spasm of growth made the boy’s toes curl up in bliss, that bestial fox flesh so much wetter and more sensitive than his old penis! The boy couldn’t help but knead that sprouting red rocket up and down as a ball of flesh started to bunch up at the base of his cock. A knot. A big, fat puffy bulb of vulpine flesh - the centerpiece of canine sex! His hand grazed the top of the tennis-ball sized lump of fox meat, feeling his entire penis flex and spurt out a heady splurt of precum right onto his pajama top. Unbeknownst to Cole, he was simulating a plump, warm fox hole with his hand, causing his hips to jerk, his cock to inflate, and his whole body to tremble in pleasure as he was rocked with a commanding canine orgasm.<br />
<br />
“Hah..! Agh! Make me… mmphf - a fox!” Cole stammered as gooey sprays of spunk shot out from his six-inch fox cock. The boy couldn’t do anything but use both hands to stroke it, basking in carnal vulpine bliss as he rode out that tidal wave of lust flowing from his loins.<br />
<br />
The spurts of cum slowly died down to a trickle, but his canid cock was still hard and throbbing. Cole managed to wrest free some of his mental faculties back from that mind-numbing orgasm, sitting up and gawking at his new member. It hardly seemed real - it was so big, the tip reaching up past belly as it drooled out semen onto his chest.<br />
<br />
“Oh… I’ve made such a mess.” Cole grumbled, surveying the puddles of cum that stained his bedsheet, his pajamas, and Foxy. The boy turned towards his beloved plush, flicking his tongue out and running it through that sticky fuzz he knew so well. Licking up his own seed just seemed to come naturally to Cole, so did trying his best to groom his mate clean as he wobbled his still hard foxhood close to Foxy’s head, almost as if he were expecting his plush to return the favor. It tasted… nice. It was really salty and sort of tased like sucking on a nickel but underlying all that was his own scent - a savory maleness that just seemed to calm him – that seemed to make the room feel more like home.<br />
<br />
“Oh… Don’t worry, Foxy. I can clean myself too.” Cole assured his plush toy, licking off the excess spunk from his lips as he schlucked down the gooey gunk. The boy looked down to his vulpine hardon, blushing as he craned his head toward his stomach just enough to feel that juicy tip brush passed his lips. Cole’s tongue peaked out, cradling that underside of his penis as he slowly let it press into his maw. He’d never dreamt of doing anything like this, but now it all seemed second nature to him.<br />
<br />
Thoroughly lapping up every trace of sperm from the tip, Cole dutifully advanced to the shaft, worshipping that plump hose of fox meat with his tongue, brain slipping into simple pleasure once again as he just let his mind drift…<br />
<br />
Cole stirred from his cock-induced torpor an hour later, awoken by his stomach growling, signaling he’d need something more than that meaty treat between his legs to sate his hunger. Hopping off his bed, he took Foxy along with him, tiptoeing down the hall as to not wake his parents, slowly ambling down the stairs towards the kitchen.</p>
