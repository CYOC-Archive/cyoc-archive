<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>My apologies to MaxOutWriting, and those who may find it jarring, but I decided to switch to third person. I felt it would let Evangeline shine more as a character.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>Is this a dream?</i> Evangeline wondered, looking around at the inside of the chamber. It&#39;s rough-hewn, but it might have been man-made. One wall -- facing the foot of the bier she awoke on -- is smooth, and looks to have a door with two more of the odd, cystalline lamps flanking it. <i>That</i> was definitely man-made.<br />
<br />
In front of her, as she sat on the side of the bier trying to gather her thoughts, were a jumble of objects -- grave goods, she guessed, given the feel of this place. While her schools hadn&#39;t been the best, Evangeline&#39;s childhood interest in medieval fantasy had carried into her teens, and she was pretty informed through her own reading on older cultures and history. She could see furs, rolled carpets, weapons, several chests, a small table or stand of black stone, and a full-length mirror in a gilt frame.<br />
<br />
Evangeline took a deep breath. <i>If this is a dream, it&#39;s very realistic.</i> Usually once she realised she was dreaming, she would wake up, never being able to achieve a lucid state. But there was no sign of that happening now.<br />
<br />
<i>Well, I guess it beats being in a hospital bed --</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Huh!?&quot; When she went to stand up, she felt parts of her body shift across the surface of the bier -- parts she couldn&#39;t account for! Bewildered, she looked down over her shoulder, her eyes widening in shock to see her shapely bottom obscured by... by...<br />
<br />
<i>Are those TAILS?</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...!&quot; Not just <i>one</i> tail, but three. She stood up -- and staggered as her feet and legs bent in the wrong places. Catching herself on one of the iron rods holding up the blue lamps -- fortunately quite sturdy -- Evangeline was again assaulted by strange sensations. It was pads and fur and the tips of claws making contact with the metal, not human skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God...&quot; She took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. She wasn&#39;t sure which was more frightening -- her otherworldly surroundings or that she was no longer human.<br />
<br />
Or the fact that this <i>couldn&#39;t</i> a dream. The sensations of touch were too vivid; the scent of rock and crystal and metal in her nostrils; even the taste of sterile air on her tongue.<br />
<br />
However, looking at her hands wrapped around the pole, she noticed something strangely familiar that distracted her from her fear. Black lines covered the back of her slim right hand, depicting a sword and harp, surmounted by a crown.<br />
<br />
&quot;No way,&quot; she breathed, awed. &quot;The... Legend of Hylore...?&quot; That was the Hero&#39;s mark, all right. A wave of nostalgia rushed over her, but the confusion did not abate. She was certainly not a Half-Alf. Or male (thank goodness).<br />
<br />
<i>But what AM I?</i> She glanced over at the mirror.<br />
<br />
Feeling that she&#39;d adjusted to her new balance, Evangeline released the post and walked towards the looking-glass. But as she did, she felt a change in her gait. It was more than just walking on the balls of her feet or the swish of the tails behind her. It was like... like she was <i>strutting,</i> her body unconsciously showing itself off with sexier movements than she knew as a human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
And standing before the mirror, she couldn&#39;t help but admire herself. As a fairly statuesque girl with big breasts and wide hips, she had always been a little self-conscious. Boys drooled over her while other girls were jealous of her; both of which had made her feel alienated and left her with few true friends. But now... somehow those concerns seemed distant as she checked out the new Evangeline, hands on her hips, shifting her weight to give herself a sensual sway.<br />
<br />
If she were good-looking before -- well, she was literally foxy now. Both taller and, slightly but noticeably, curvier. Her hair, always a source of pride, now looked even silkier and was definitely longer, reaching her waist. Smooth fur gleamed in the mystical light. Pointed ears, a long narrow muzzle, slitted pupils, digitigrade legs and those three bushy tails completed the vulpine image. She also noticed that, beneath the curves and fur, she seemed a little more muscular.<br />
<br />
<i>Kojin.</i> It had taken a moment, but she finally managed to dig the game&#39;s name for its anthropomorphic foxes out of her memory. But something was off.<br />
<br />
She was not <i>just</i> a Kojin. She&#39;d thought at first that it was the odd lighting making her skin look blue. But she knew now that she had fur, and that it <i>was</i> blue: dark blue over most of her body; light blue gracing lower muzzle, throat, chest, belly, groin and the tips of her tails; pads, claws and nose a deep blue-black. Even her hair seemed to have a bit of blue shine. <br />
<br />
But her eyes were a bright, burning red in black sclera.<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; <i>These are the colours of a Dark Kojin!</i> The leather bikini hugging her bust and ass, a midnight colour a few shades darker than her fur, was also befitting of the evil race. <I>If I&#39;m supposed to be the Hero, then...</i><br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; She finished the thought aloud. At least her voice hadn&#39;t changed... much; though maybe it sounded a little more musical? More refined? She shook her head.<br />
<br />
<i>At least I should be fairly powerful...</i> As she thought that, she felt a tingle run from the tips of her tails up her spine, making her shiver with the feel of <i>magic. Her</i> magic. Oh yes. A three-tailed Kojin was a more than decent spell-caster, and Evangeline felt the knowledge of a number of low-to-medium spells in the back of her brain.<br />
<br />
Plus, with her limber body, claws and teeth, she should be a decent physical combatant, even with just the martial arts she&#39;d learned on Earth. Although maybe this new body also knew the use of one or two of those weapons, as well as magic...<br />
<br />
Finished with her examination, she looked around. She wanted to search the chests, but first her eyes fell on the polished surface of the black marble stand. Upon it a single roll of parchment rested, tied with a red ribbon. Picking it up, she slid off the ribbon and found it to be a letter.<br />
<br />
<i>Greetings, Hero of the Future.<br />
<br />
By the time thou readest this, the Hero laid to rest in this Tomb shall likely have long since turned to dust. But I do not doubt the prophecy that a new Hero shall awaken here in Hylore&#39;s time of need. Thus have I laid an enchantment to preserve the offerings of the people so that thou mayest take for thyself whatever is needful to thy journey. Once thou art equipped, press the switch to the right of the door. The seal I placed on it shall break and the door shall open.<br />
<br />
I know not what form thou shalt take, whence thou shalt come, or what evil thou must face outside this place. I know only that the power, courage and wisdom of the ancient Hero has been born anew in thee. Take heart, and go forth, with the Goddesses&#39; blessings. My prayers as well, whatever avail they may be, will also be with thee from Paradise.<br />
<br />
~ The Sage Gailion</i><br />
<br />
Sudden emotion gripped Evangeline as she finished the message, tears stinging her crimson eyes. But as she set the letter down, unease rose to become uppermost. Could she really live up to this Sage&#39;s expectations -- as a Dark Kojin? Unless things were <i>drastically</i> different from the game&#39;s portrayal, very few would likely accept her as any kind of hero. And... what if the feelings of sexiness and dominance pervading her was just the tip of something far more sinister?<br />
<br />
She bit her lip as she stared into the fiery gaze in the mirror. <i>Dark Kojin...</i> She put her hands on the soft, short fur of her upper boobs, watching herself stroke down over her alluring body. &quot;Nnnn...&quot; It certainly <i>felt</i> good to be a magical fox woman. She even felt budding arousal in her loins -- something she never felt when looking at herself before.<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;No use worrying about it right now.&quot; She turned her attention back to the grave goods, ready to see if there were anything she wanted. Opening the chests, she found they contained clothing, armour, food, drink, potions and other things -- everything she needed, as the letter promised.<br />
<br />
It seemed her first task would be to assemble an outfit and maybe pick a weapon.</p>
