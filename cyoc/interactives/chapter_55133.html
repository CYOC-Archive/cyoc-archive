<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The stale smell of straw and manure fills your nostrils as you wake up.  Your body feels sore and stretched, and it takes a moment for your mind to clear enough to realize why.  You're stretched spread eagle, your arms tied by ropes to large ceiling beams, your legs similarly spread by ropes connected to upright poles.  You look more carefully around the barn.  An old table is set out by you full of odd random items that you can't seem to make sense of, otherwise, except for straw and old cow shit, the barn is empty.  A breeze brings you to awareness of the fact you're completely nude, your designer clothes bunched up and thrown onto a pile of straw.<br />
<br />
You start shouting, screaming for someone to come and let you down.  After a few moments the barn doors push open and in walk two men.  One you recognize.  Buck Fletcher is the younger of the two.  He's 21, the same age as your brother, he had been in school with your older brother, but dropped out.  You and your friends always mock him ceaselessly for it.  His brown hair is cut in the stereotypical mullet, his chin and upper lip covered in a scraggy attempt at a goatee.  He's dressed in a pair of threadbare jeans and heavy work boots, the leather stained by the same stuff stinking up the bark.  On his broad shoulders hangs a flannel shirt left unbuttoned, his slightly hairy, muscular chest open for the world to see.  He loves showing off his bulky frame.  He opens his mouth in a grin, showing off the pair of buck teeth that everyone jokes is the source of his name.  &quot;Looky there, Jed.  Lil' fucker's awake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right you are, Buck.&quot;  Jed laughs as he walks closer.  You can see the family resemblance.  Jed must be a cousin as you're pretty sure Buck doesn't have a brother, having the same brown hair and blue eyes.  He's in his twenties, probably 23 or 24.  His hair is cut in the same mullet, and thick side burns run down the side of his face.  The smell of the smoke from the cig hanging out the corner of his mouth cuts through the earth smell in the barn.  His pants and boots are similar to Buck's, but he wears no shirt his chest covered in a thicker pelt of brown hair than Buck had.  His belt has a huge metal buckle shaped like a bull on it.  A cowboy hat atop his head completes his look.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two fuckers had better let me go!  When I get free, I'm going to see both of you dead!  You hear me!  My father's going to make both of you pay!  You messed with the wrong guy!&quot;  You shout as you start tugging on the ropes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know what he's sayin', Buck?&quot;  Jed picks a can of beer of the table, popping the top with a hiss.  He comes to stand right in front of you, with you held up a handful of inches above the ground, he meets your eye level directly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah.  I ain't never understood.  City folk all talk too fast.&quot;  Buck shoved his hands in his pockets, his mouth quirking into another wide grin.<br />
<br />
Jed's strong hands grip your jaw, forcing your mouth open.  He tips the can over your mouth, the warm cheap beer pouring directly down your throat, forcing you to drink or drown.  You've never drunk such cheap swill before.  Even underage you and your friends can always get the good stuff.  This beer was just nasty, but you drink every drop because you don't have a choice.  You cough when he lets you go.  You spit a few times into the straw, trying to get the taste of cheap booze out of your mouth.  &quot;Y'all ain't got a clue who yer messin' with!&quot;  Your eyes go wide as you hear your own voice.  You sound just like them, the same accent and slow way of talking.  You try again to speak, but trying over and over only produces the same accent.  &quot;What'd y'all do to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Buck smiles.  &quot;Made ya easier to listen to.  you gonna need it, seeing as yer gonna be our cousin.  Ya see, we're a bit shorthanded on this farm, and we was fixin to make you family so you could help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I ain't gonna be family to y'all!&quot;  You begin tugging again on the ropes, but it gets you no where.<br />
<br />
Jed tosses the can aside on top of your clothes.  &quot;Aw, now yer gunna hurt Buck's feelings.  He was lookin forward to havin a cousin Mitch too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That ain't my name!  I'm M...&quot;  You take a breath.  &quot;M... Mi... Mitch?&quot;  You take a few more minutes trying to say your name, but every time, only Mitch comes out.  After a few minutes, you don't even think you can recall your name.<br />
<br />
&quot;See.  Yer Mitch.  Don't worry yer gonna enjoy it.&quot;  Jed grabs another item off the table, some sort of gel which he dumps on top of your head.  Your scalp begins to itch, you vision suddenly becoming obscured by your growing blond hair, which even as you look at it turns the same brown as Buck and Jed's hair.  You hear the sound of electric clippers and feel it run along the side and top of your head.  It doesn't take you much to figure you probably have the same mullet as them.  <br />
<br />
Now that you can see again, you see Butch stripping down.  His shirt is already off, quickly followed by his pants and underwear.  He's hung like a donkey, his thick uncut cock hanging halfway down his thigh with a pair of bull balls to go along.  He sees you staring and grabs it, waving it at you.  &quot;You like this, Mitch?  Yer gonna have one too.  It's a family thing.  Ya can't handle it yet, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Buck walks over to the table and grabs a pack of cigs from the table.  Jed moves over to the side and begins his own stripping, taking off all his clothes except for his wide brimmed hat.  Buck was right about the donkey cock being a family thing, in fact you think Jed's might be even bigger.  <br />
<br />
Buck sticks a cig in your mouth and lights it up.  You begin to puff away without even thinking about it.  As the smoke fills your lungs your body begins to warm up.  Each puff stretches your body.  Your arms and legs grow longer, but somehow the ropes holding you still remain tight.  You look down at yourself and realize you're not really getting bigger, just older.  Your body looses most of it's remaining baby fat, the hair on your arms and legs getting a bit darker and thicker, as well a small treasure trail growing in.  Your dick gains an inch or so, but still looks small compared to Buck and Jed's tools.  Your jaw itches as some facial hair grows in.  Buck reaches up and takes the cig from your mouth, snuffing it out on the table.  He gives another of his huge smiles.  &quot;Yer old 'nough now, 20 I reckon.  To old for school, guess'n yer gonna have to be a drop out like me.  Still think its funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jed claps his hand on Buck's shoulder.  &quot;Buck.  Gotta' be nice to him, he's family now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Buck nods as he looks up at you.  &quot;Jed's right.  Sorry, Mitch.  Lemme make it up ta ya.&quot;  He pours a jar of cream from the table into his hand and grabs your cock.  He begins to stroke it, bringing you to a quick erection.  Even erect your not as large as their flaccid cocks, and now Buck is getting an erection as he rubs you off, and Jed getting one from rubbing himself as he watches.  As he rubs your cock you feel a strange sensation, as if there is suddenly more skin rubbing along your shaft.  When Buck finally lets go from his few moments of rubbing you see a foreskin covering part of your cock now.  You only have a moment to think about it before you feel a sudden pain from behind you.  <br />
<br />
Jed buries a few inches of his thick cock in your ass.  &quot;Now we gonna bond, boy.  This is how we Fletcher men welcome one of our own to man hood.  Yer a man now, and now we gunna make you a Fletcher.  You like that?&quot;  You nod your head as a few more inches bury into you.  <br />
<br />
Buck takes a clay jug off the table and runs it under your nose.  The smell of potent grain alcohol fills your nose.  &quot;Moonshine.  From Grandpa's special still.  This'll turn ya into a real man while Jed fucks ya.&quot;  He tips the jug over your mouth and begins to pour.  It's not the same as before where they forced it down you, you try to drink as much of it as you can, but a great deal of it begins to runs down your face and body.  A comfortable warmth spreads through your muscles.  As Jed begins to work his huge cock in and out of you in a steady rhythm, the warmth turns to an ache.  With each thrust your scrawny frame seems to pack on a pound or so of muscle.  Your legs and arms become thicker, the muscles becoming defined.  Your chest heaves as two meaty pecs force their way out on your chest, your flat stomach seeming to break apart into six hard rock like muscles.  You can tell your not as big as either of your 'cousins', but your not small by any means.<br />
<br />
The hair on your body gets darker and thicker, your previously smooth chest growing first some between your pecs, and then spreading out towards your nipples and shoulders.  Jed begins to grunt, you can now feel his heavy lemon sized balls slapping your thighs.  You're amazed you could take the whole thing, from what you saw it had to be twelve inches hard.  Soon your chest and abs are covered in an even coating of dark brown hair, just like Buck's, sparser than Jed's thick fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jes' one more thing and you'll be one o' us.  Right, Buck?&quot;  Jed grunts as he keeps pounding you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Jed.&quot;  Buck takes some strange jar full of off white goo and dips his hand in it.  He takes a huge glob and holds it up to your nose.  It smells earthy and musky, you open your mouth, knowing what's next.  As Buck shoves the glob of goo in your mouth he mutters, &quot;Donkey spunk mixed with Grandpa's moonshine.  Ol' family secret.  Only works once though.&quot;  It burns your throat as it goes down but you devour every drop, and keep doing so as Buck keeps feeding it to you.  Your balls begin to churn, feeling suddenly heavier as they pull down on you.  They begin to sway with the constant pounding your receiving from behind, and even slap with Jed's own swinging pair.  They pass the size of Buck's huge balls, and even past what Jed has.  You feel like you have a pair of oranges dangling between your legs.  The concoction continues to work on your now uncut cock.  The shaft swells thicker and thicker until it's the width of a beer can, then gets longer, from the five inches it was to seven.  A few more thrusts from Jed and it grows past nine, the head swelling up like some fleshy mushroom.  You feel your balls beginning to churn as your cock passes Buck's ten inches and reaches Jed's twelve.  <br />
<br />
You let out a shout at the top of your lungs as your blow you load, shooting huge glob after glob from your fourteen inch cock, some of it hitting Buck in his chest hair.  Jed shouts only a few moments after you, burying himself one last time in your ass as you feel him shoot what feels like a bucketful of cum into you.  As both Jed's and your orgasm die down he pulls out of you, a string of cum leaking from your ass and down your leg.  Jed comes around to stand in front of you and stares at the same thing Buck is, your cock.  &quot;Woowee.. Even in this family that's big.  Yer a Fletcher man through and through now, ain't ya?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I sure am.&quot;  You grin at Jed.  You know you're not just saying that.  You really do feel like one of them now.  You even feel ashamed of that prissy little prick you used to be.  &quot;Ya gonna let me down now, Jed?&quot;  Both Jed and Buck begin to untie you, and finally free you stretch your new muscles, watching them bulge with delight.  You're not as big as Jed or Buck, an inch or so shorter and a few pounds lighter, but that doesn't bother you.  You have them beat where it counts.  You grab your cock just to feel it's weight in your hands.<br />
<br />
You see an old mirror on the table and pick it up, getting a good look at your face.  The old you is completely gone.  Looking back at you is a twenty year old red neck, with a shaggy brown mullet and blue eyes.  You can see the resemblance you now bear to Jed and Buck, the same heavy brow and square jaw.  You look a lot more like Jed than Buck, but anyone looking at you could tell all three of you were related.  In fact you have the same buck teeth as Buck, which almost makes you laugh.  When you turn around Jed and Buck are already pulling their clothes back on.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's some for ya on the table, Mitch.&quot;  Jed points at a pile of cloth you mistook for rags.  Old jeans that do nothing to hide your bulge, and worn in work boots,  just like your cousins, but with a black tank top and a red bandana you tie on your head as if you'd worn it like that your whole life.<br />
<br />
You look at your cousins with the same cocky smirk both of them have.  &quot;What we gunna do now?&quot;</p>
