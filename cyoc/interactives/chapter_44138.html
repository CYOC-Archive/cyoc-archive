<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Loki.  He was speaking from behind the mirror's glass pane.  The image of the bathroom bent and flexed over Loki's face as he spoke.  It was as if he was controlling the silver backing of the mirror without causing the glass to flex or bend.  Odette quickly checked the room to make sure that she was alone.  The unreal arrival of Loki momentarily made Odette forget her current state of dress.  It was a few seconds before she remembered and threw her hands over her nipples.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really so modest, Odette?&quot; Loki said leering slightly.  &quot;I should have you know that I hardly care about something as simple as peeping in on under-clad ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you want?&quot;  Odette said defensively.  She did not know that much about the Norse pantheon, but seeing what Loki had done to her graduating class only a few hours ago had taught her to be wary.  At the same time she was trying to grab a towel from the counter with out letting go of her breasts if only so she could cover herself more completely.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wound me, Odette, by saying that I am anything but fair,&quot;  Loki said.  His tone was both threatening and cautioning.  &quot;If anything I am ultimately fair to the people I encounter.&quot;  (Writer's Note to the Reader:  Loki is a big fat liar.  If you ever meet him remember this.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Odette said.  She had managed to snag a towel with one hand while the other did double coverage.  It helped that Loki seemed to be looking away from Odette but then this was guy that was inside a mirror at the moment.  With a quick movement and a bit of flourish, she had the towel around her under the arms and held in place.  It was a large white towel that was tight across her firmly held bosom and loose further down where her body pulled in sharply.  Now clothed some confidence returned to Odette.  &quot;And I suppose you took no enjoyment from changing all my friends at the prom, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look, I find my enjoyment where ever I can.  Tonight I was in a giving mood.  I started small, then things just got more ... creative.  Listen, nothing that I did tonight was really mean spirited.  Things could have been a lot worse.&quot;  Loki's face seemed genuinely apologetic to Odette.  This was all a part of his plan.  &quot;Do you happen to know what the word 'hubris' means?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Odette said a little confused.  This was the guy that had drastically altered her body for no real reason and now here he was trying to make up for it.  Odette's head was almost spinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Never mind all that.  Listen I just wanted to come by and explain myself to you, Odette.  You seem angry about your new waist and I wanted to be clear that I did not have anything to do with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odette did not like the way he kept using her name.  She did not know him and it made her uncomfortable.  &quot;I find that hard to believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really. Well alright I was the one that had the magic, but then it was your boyfriend that chose what I should do.  He had humiliated himself in front of his class for me and I re-payed him with a wish.  I can't help that he chose to change you instead of himself.&quot; (Writer: See a filthy liar.  But Odette doesn't know this.)<br />
<br />
&quot;Jimmy did this?&quot;  She gestured at her waist and the towel slipped to the floor.  Awkwardly she performed a series of twists and bends and crouches to try and pick it up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you talked to him right?  Didn't he say this was sort of a fantasy for him?  Nice guy.&quot;  Loki was building some raport with Odette, soon she would be ripe for the tricking.<br />
<br />
Odette thought for a moment.  Jimmy had thought of changing her hair or her breasts, the jerk.  She was probably lucky that he had not just turned her into some teenage porn-star cheerleader.  But he could have done something nice for her.  Why did he not make her nose smaller like she had hinted to him that she would have liked.  He could have given her some beautiful long legs or a great singing voice.  No, Jimmy had chosen to bind her waist in a restrictive corset like magic thing that kept her from bending over.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, I only try to give people what they want.  I am a fair guy.  I was fair to Jimmy which was unfair to you, unfortunately.  That is why I am here, Odette.  To make it up to you,&quot;  Loki smiled a calculated smile that radiated trust and fairness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; Odette said finally.  &quot;Let me hear what you had in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Great.  OK, so you don't like the waist and you're ticked off at your boyfriend.  So, I was thinking that I could pretend that I am just some two-timing genii and make the curse you have actually be on Jimmy.  Only his 'girlfriend' would be afflicted with the tiny waist.  Then all you have to do is breakup with Jim-boy and you would be free of the curse.  Easy?&quot;  Loki was cleaver.  This was not the deal that Odette would go for.  The trap was almost set to go off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm ...&quot; Odette mumbled.  Jimmy may have made a bad choice but she still liked him.  Well she still wanted him around for at least the rest of the summer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, right, that wasn't exactly the stirring noise of approval that I wanted to hear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's just that I still kind of like him.&quot;  Odette was thinking quickly.  &quot;But if you are still open to fixing your honour then ...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did have a back up idea but I didn't think that you would like it so much.  I thought that you might be against the whole wishes and changes thing.  so I just thought you would want to get rid of everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was your other idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought that if you liked the whole waist thing then you could keep it.  Then to make it up to you I would give you one wish.  You could change anything about yourself or if you were still feeling a little sore at Jimmy then you could make a wish on him like he did to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Odette was silent for a moment.  Loki continued, &quot;Ninety-five percent of the people I change seem alright with the changes after.  That includes the people that are not so happy right from the start.  I didn't know if you would eventually grow to like your waist.  So if you wanted to change something else then ...&quot;  He continued to talk while Odette thought.<br />
<br />
It was not so much as thinking as just letting her feelings and emotions run wild.  Later her thoughts would fill in the rest.  Odette didn't mind her tiny stomach.  The shape of her side was sort of compelling and if she could find the right clothes then she would look great.  Odette wondered what she would look like in a bikini this summer.  The only two things that really grated was how Jimmy had forced her into this.  And the other was the restriction on her movements.  If only there was some way to get rid of that then she would be happy.  A plan formed in her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Loki, I would like to help you but the thing is that I just don't trust you.  There might be some way to fix that though.&quot;  She let that sentence hang a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;If trust is the only problem then I will do anything to help you.&quot;  Loki smiled inwardly, this was where she would try to con Loki into giving her more than he wanted to.  He would let her then she would make a big mistake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Loki you keep saying waist.  Would it still be fair to Jimmy if you left the smallness but removed the magical corset-thing and bra.  I would be able to trust you if you did that.&quot;  Odette smiled inwardly.  If I can get rid of the restraint, she thought, then I could still get a wish to change anything I want.  I would come out on top twice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do that,&quot; Loki said.  He closed his eyes briefly.  Ha, got you, he thought.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Odette, felt the easing around her body.  She could bend her spine and twist freely.  Her breast also flopped apart and bounced freely, still perky and large as ever but not right below her nose.  She struck a flirty pose that accentuated her tiny mid-section leaving her breasts uncovered.  Ha, got you, she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, now that is done.  What will you wish for?&quot;</p>
