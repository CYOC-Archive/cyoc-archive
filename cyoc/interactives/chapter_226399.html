<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since they were literally no consequences what so ever, Jake decided he would become a giant reptile monster and go on a rampage on the whole city, setting the transformation was pretty easy, just a physical transformation, then the growing so he can be even taller than buildings, and maybe a few mental changes so he enjoys his time destroying the city, and yeah… that would do it. <br />
He prepared the Chronivac to load his previous save either if he dies or if a whole month goes by. “That should be enough time to enjoy myself” he thought.<br />
Jake looked at his room one more time, he was about to destroy the whole city and he was getting a boner just by imagining himself as a macro reptile thrashing buildings. He just wanted this to happen and clicked start.<br />
<br />
First, it was just a tingling, he felt his body temperature drop as he became a cold-blooded creature, then a powerful rush of energy hit his body, making his muscles throb as they packed on mass and size, his pecs exploded in size but so did his gut, as his torso was taking a barrel shape.<br />
In less than a few seconds he was 8 ft tall, his tail lashed violently trashing stuff on his bedroom, growing bigger with each swing. “oh yes! I feel soooo good!” said admiring his body, noticing the scales emerging in his gut and chest.<br />
<br />
The scales continued covering everything in his body, hardening quickly, his tail lashed out in excitement. He saw his arms now covered in scales shrinking in his torso, he tried moving his fingers but it was difficult, they were growing stiffer and now he could only feel four of them.<br />
His neck throbbed next as it grew, forming new bone and muscles, growing larger and connecting to his wide torso. But then his head crashed into the ceiling, “That was fast” he thought. “I’m already outgrowing my room” his tail was bumping into the opposite wall already and he knew he didn’t have much time before…<br />
*CRASH* The whole ceiling foundation fell into crumbles and he tried jumping out of the creaking floor, but it was no avail, his body was so heavy that the floor collapsed as well. Now Jake was kind of trapped between the first and second floor, and he could swear his tail found its way out through a window.<br />
<br />
He knew that if he stuggled a bit all the house will collapse and he would be freed, but letting things get destroyed by his continuous growing was more exciting, and so he tried to remain perfectly still but could already feel his body expanding, the walls around him wouldn’t last long.<br />
He could feel his feet changing shape, his toenails elongating into claws, well… at least three on each feet, then his feet grew as the claws pierced on what he believed it was the kitchen wall.<br />
But his little shelter was not taking another growth and as his tail became wider and longer at one, a wall collapsed, then another one, and another one, as a domino effect, a cloud of dust raised and then the beast was freed.<br />
<br />
Jake stretched his dino-legs, loving the feeling of destruction under his claws, and noticed he was already taller than his house. Smiling mischievously as his face began pushing out into a snout, scales quickly crept over his new head, he closed his eyes as they were pushed on the sides of his head and when he opened them again they were tinted yellow with an elongated pupil to resemble reptilian eyes.<br />
The colors around Jake faded a little as his eyes changed, everything looked kind of dull as his vision pallet was simplified. He felt his teeth rearranging, new bone was cutting through his gums as new saw-like teeth emerged.  <br />
<br />
He looked down at the place where his house used to be, and noticed his growing was not done yet. He took a step and the driveway now had the footprint of a three clawed beast, he looked at his neighbor’s house and turned, letting his tail go through the building with ease, he could faintly hear some screaming, but his earholes were not the best so he ignored it and let himself go wild.<br />
As he trashed the house, he felt his posture change as his head lowered and his tail raised, feeling way stronger with his legs now, his dick growing out of his slit, throbbing into his full reptile length as he destroyed the remains of the building.<br />
<br />
“I am… too fucking BIG! I NEED to DESTROY!” Jake thought as he was already feeling the urge to destroy things around him, his arms were too short to reach his throbbing meat so he headed to the next house and stepped on it, sending waves of pleasure directly to his brain, his dick exploaded as yellowish reptile cum was sprayed over the house.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… that felt GOOD! But I need MORE! I want to be BIGGER!” Surprisingly his dick didn’t grow soft after his orgasm but instead his body was struck with another wave of growth as he expanded to be taller than 4-floor buildings, <br />
<br />
“OH YEAAA! BIGGER MAKE ME BIGGER!” His neighborhood looked very tiny now, he could not believe he was fitting there before, but there was no time to think on this kind of stuff, his cock was demanding more destruction.<br />
And so he rampaged, loving the chaos and despair of every little human, growing bigger with each step, spreading his seed over the destruction after a job well done. <br />
<br />
…<br />
“KEEP… DESTROYING… GET… BIGGER…” Roared the beast, after an hour of non-stopping destruction and orgasms his thoughts were now simpler, no need for human knowledge, he was a beast now! His paws were giant, covering a whole baseball stadium, and so he must be taller than a 20-floor building.<br />
<br />
“ROOOOARR… ME BIG! ROOOOAAAAR” The beast then noticed some itching on his back, something was… exploding? Turning around he saw some little humans on little vehicles, they were indeed military forces, full equipped with helicopters and tanks but they didn’t last long, covered by a blast of reptile seed they all perished in one way or another<br />
<br />
After every building in his town was trashed, a new peaceful silence gloomed over the destruction, the beast looked around him and “ROOOOOOOAAAAARRRR” sending powerful soundwaves that announced his arrival, no one will ever be safe, with each building the beast destroys the bigger he will get.<br />
<br />
It’s just a matter of time until he is bigger than the earth itself, and so the beast wandered off searching more buildings to destroy, more humans to kill, his steps covered miles and nothing could stop him now.</p>
