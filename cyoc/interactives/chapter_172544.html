<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Caroline brought Diane to a nearby restaurant.  Diane was a diabetic, so she had to watch her carbs closely, which often resulted in her ordering small portions.  Caroline frowned.  &quot;I understand you have a medical condition, but you&#39;re so thin.  I wish you could eat more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane shrugged.  &quot;It is what it is, love.  Besides, I like being slender, so if that means I&#39;m always about a sandwich away from being malnourished, well, beauty is pain, no?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline shook her head.  &quot;I guess it wouldn&#39;t be so bad if you didn&#39;t make me look like a glutton by comparison.&quot; <br />
Indeed, Caroline had always had a hearty appetite, and so worked out regularly to burn off the excess calories.<br />
<br />
&quot;On the contrary,  you take enjoyment from eating, and I&#39;m happy to witness anything that gives you pleasure.&quot;  Diane reached across the table to place her hand on Caroline&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such an odd girl.  I don&#39;t know what to make of you, Diane.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you love me, don&#39;t you?&quot;  Diane smiled slyly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very much.  Don&#39;t doubt that.&quot;  <br />
<br />
As the two girls finished their respective meals, the server, a strikingly beautiful and youthful young woman, came up to them.  &quot;Excuse me, sorry to bother you, but the gentleman over there,&quot; she gestured to an older and distinguished looking businessman, &quot;was wondering if you wouldn&#39;t mind joining him for a glass of wine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m too young to partake, but if you are interested, Caroline my dear, why not?&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline bit her lower lip for a moment.  &quot;Well, sure, what could it hurt?&quot;  <br />
<br />
The server smiled.  &quot;He also says he&#39;ll pick up your bill, so feel free to join him at your leisure, ladies.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane raised an eyebrow, her expression neutral.  &quot;Curiouser and curiouser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline chuckled.  &quot;Remember what the Dormouse said.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, let us go &#39;feed our heads&#39;, as it were.&quot;  Diane rose, and offered her hand to the smaller woman.  Hand in hand, they walked over to the table.  The businessman wore a very fine suit, and had salt and pepper hair with well-groomed facial hair.  His blue eyes sparkled as he got up and pulled out chairs for the two.  &quot;Ladies, thank you for accepting my invitation.  My name is Gerald Grant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How alliterative, I approve.&quot;  Said Diane, as she sat, and allowed Gerald to push in her chair for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll get used to Diane shortly, Mr. Grant, you&#39;ll find she&#39;s a little odd and old-fashioned in some ways, but I think that makes her interesting.  My name is Caroline, thank you for your hospitality.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed, we are quite honored by your charity, Mr. Grant.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald pushed in Caroline&#39;s chair before sitting down.  The server arrived with an expensive looking bottle of wine, and poured three glasses for the trio.<br />
<br />
&quot;A pinot noir, I&#39;m surprised this restaurant has any in stock.&quot;  Diane sniffed the glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it&#39;s not for just anyone.  I actually own the restaurant, and when I have business meetings here, I only serve the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline sipped the wine.  She wasn&#39;t much of a wine drinker, really, but after the day she&#39;d had, she felt she could use something alcoholic.  &quot;Um, Diane, you know you really shouldn&#39;t drink that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was merely savoring the aroma, my love.  Although I do find it more than passing strange that the server poured me a glass, since I&#39;d already informed her of my lack of years, so to speak.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald grinned.  &quot;Well, as to that, you&#39;ll find that if you do wish to sample my offering, no one will report the infraction.  My dears, I must admit to having ulterior motives for inviting you over.  I&#39;m a contractor of sorts.  I could tell the instant you both entered my domain that you were both enchanted, and very much in love- love of a sort that is frowned upon by many.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane&#39;s right eye twitched.  &quot;Enchanted, you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am very familiar with the supernatural, and I know magic when I see it.  You were both very different people when this day began.  A powerful artifact was used to transform you both, rearranging your memories and lives.  I immediately thought to offer you my services.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What...kind of services?&quot;  Caroline seemed cautious.  &quot;And at what cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gerald chuckled.  &quot;I don&#39;t deal in souls, I&#39;m no serpent or devil, I assure you.  I&#39;m a broker of sorts, I suppose you could say.  My clients are very interested in certain commodities, and are often willing to purchase them in exchange for...miracles, I suppose you could say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miracles.&quot;  Diane didn&#39;t conceal her dubiousness as she sipped at her wine.  &quot;So how would such a transaction be commenced?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simply put, you tell me what you want, and I&#39;ll see if any of my clients can offer that.  Then I come back with their price.  They can ask for any sort of thing, really, and sometimes it&#39;s trivial- possibly even beneficial.  It&#39;s all in the eye of the beholder.  For example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re the sort of woman who fears the onset of age, and the diminishing of her beauty.  She would naturally wish to regain some of her lost youth- and she might be told the price is the vibrant hue of her hair, or a few inches of her height.  In fact, there was one case, where a client asked for no compensation, but instead offered to take away a few more years than the lady had asked for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Caroline blinked.  &quot;How many more?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she was nearing the age of 40, and she thought it would be wonderful to go back to being 20 again- my client instead offered her the chance to be 15 once more.  Obviously, that presents certain...problems, but she couldn&#39;t pass up such a good deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And then what happened to her?&quot;  Diane pressed Gerald for more information.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, she suddenly found that as a girl of 15, she no longer had assets, nor could she prove her identity.  She ended up young but destitute.  I offered her a job, and she&#39;s been working for me ever since.  You met her in fact, surely it didn&#39;t escape you that your server was exceptionally pretty for her job?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did notice, in fact.  But far be it from me to comment on another&#39;s circumstances.  And if we refuse the deal, no harm or foul?&quot;  Diane seemed thoughtful.<br />
<br />
&quot;None at all.  So, the only question is, what do you want?&quot;  Gerald smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you actually believe him, Diane?&quot;  Caroline seemed nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have proof magic exists, so while this could be a scam, what would the purpose be?  As long as we have a written contract that I may inspect, we merely have to decide if the price is worth paying.  What would you ask for, my dear Caroline?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young woman seemed to think about that for a moment.  &quot;I&#39;m not really sure I want what I lost back- I gained you in trade, and that&#39;s the greatest bargain I could ask for.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane smiled softly at her lover.<br />
<br />
&quot;But..I suppose being able to resolve the issue of my husband without a confrontation could be worth something.  Or even...&quot;  She grinned.  &quot;Something more impossible.  Mr. Grant, I want to be married to Diane here instead of my current husband.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane&#39;s eyes widened.  She didn&#39;t object, but she was surprised that Caroline was ready to move their relationship forward to such a degree at this time.<br />
<br />
Gerald nodded, and seemed to snatch a piece of parchment out of the air, presenting it to both ladies.  &quot;Your contract.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was fast!&quot;  Caroline blinked, even as Diane grabbed the paper to persuse it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sometimes my clients have a bit of foresight in these matters.&quot;</p>
