<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay thought about trying something with the phone app, but seeing how Nolan turned out, he wanted to do something at home instead. Jay had stayed natural in his athletic career for several reasons: partly so as not to risk playing status, partly health concerns, and largely just to avoid having too many potential lifestyle scandals for his Presidential ambitions. But since the Chronivac was reversible, he had to admit he was curious. With his solid starting build and a heavy gym regimen, what would Jay look like if he took steroids and other enhancers for five years, or better, six years? (To one up Nolan). Whatever the downsides were, it would be temporary. So he took one last discrete gaze at Nolan and left for his car.<br />
<br />
Jay drove by a sporting goods store first. To avoid the issue he had as “Jaya,” he bought some extra large size workout shirts, tanks, sweat pants, and a few caps just to fit the meathead look. At a retail store nearby, he found extra large jean shorts, tees, and flannel shirts which he could tweak or cut off depending on how big he got. He didn&#39;t think his feet would change, but partly just in case and partly because he was basically equipping himself like a video game character, he chose a pair of thick workboots with some extra toe room. He tossed in a couple sports caps and head band. He practically felt like he was designing a character, if Rockstar came up with GYM THEFT ANABOLIC or something.  <br />
----------------------<br />
Finally home, he texted Emma. “Hey, Babe, trying a different change this time. Come over in about 40 minutes.” Eagerly Jay got to the Chronivac. He set the transformation to definitely show a six year enhanced regime. He further set the transformation itself to take ten minutes, but the duration for 12 hours. This would give him time to have fun with Emma, explore the body, and hopefully get back to the gym while Nolan was still there. Jay&#39;s competitive streak had him wanting to see how they&#39;d measure up if on the same enhanced playing field, so to speak. 12 hours also worked, since he still hadn&#39;t checked in on Terry and Luis yet, and with their more gradual timeline, he&#39;d see better results tomorrow (or the next day, if he decided to let it linger).<br />
<br />
Jay stripped to a  speedo, set the Chronivac, and waited. Then the jolt hit him. He could feel a sensation like a really strong pump. His biceps swelled from impressive to the size of cannonballs, his forearms turning into thick legs of mutton ready for the butcher. The bicep vein grew and spread into a cord like a rope. His shoulders widened, boulders forming, veins coming down, the lines feeding into the vascular snake on his arms. His neck was practically lost in the round mounds that were his traps. Pectorals stretched, looming out like watermelons and jutting out, but there was also a spreading pelt of hair, typical of dianabol and others. And forming tighter striations. His back widened and swelled out, forming  an intricate roadmap in terms of veins and lines but also a thick relief map of mountains jumping out of the skin and carved recesses. Acne and injection marks popped up here and there, though Jay couldn&#39;t feel or see them right now. His abs became even more defined and sculpted, but at the same time they swelled out into a sizable roid gut. And still everything seemed to be getting bigger, harder, now his arms were huge slabs of inflated, distended beef. His hands thickened as well and developed a rougher, more calloused texture.<br />
<br />
While Jay felt the overwhelming pleasure of his growing body, he hadn&#39;t yet noticed that his brow was widening and lowering, his nose thickening, and his jaw widening, making him look like more of a bruiser. The HGH blended in all the cycles caused some increase in hands and toe bones. His hair receded upward rapidly, leaving side fringe and just a few scattered top strands peaking amidst the scalp. There were other facial changes which he would notice later.<br />
Jay&#39;s lower body wasn&#39;t being neglected either. His glutes pushed out into firm hams, his thighs were just as thick and heavily veined as the rest of him, suggesting definite Trenbolone use. Calves grew into full steers. Even his feet were affected, growing larger (the HGH again). Other side effects were happening in his nether regions. Jay&#39;s testicles reduced in size, as this version of Jay had been getting testosterone artificially for six years. <br />
<br />
Jay felt completely overwhelmed and staggered to move under his new weight. “Incredible,” he said aloud in his deeper voice. He could feel the bulk and size and was in awe. As far as the change below, he could feel it against the material, the smaller pair. Less potatoes for his meat now, more like smaller tangerines. Unlike Nolan, it hardly bothered him. Part of it was knowing what would happen from Nolan, but a lot of it was his experimentation as Jaya. Besides, his member remained substantial and was clearly at attention from all of this.<br />
Jay stretched his new form and lumbered over to the full length mirror. He was astounded at what he saw, and then aghast as he looked up to see himself eye to eye. He was a mass monster, sure, a super heavyweight muscle beast who looked easily 300 lbs. He was pro competitor size, if not quite contest shape, and his upper body was a series of pumpkin-like spheres and veiny protrusions. That was all great, if bigger than he&#39;d dreamed. <br />
<br />
But he could see his face, his handsome mug heavily altered. The thick nose, an intensely stubbled jaw nearly as wide as his brow, the brows themselves seemed a bit lower and throbbing veins visible there too, a jutting lower lip... This alone gave him an intimidating,  “gorilla juicehead” look, an intense chemical beast. But moreso, he&#39;d set his age up to where he should be just 30. Instead he looked like a hard-lived 42 or 45, thick crows feet at the eyes, weathered lines near the brows. Worst of all, his hair! His hairline hadn&#39;t just receded, it had basically evaporated, with a few scraggly curls left way back on his skull, and a side fringe which was at least holding on for now but just emphasized the bareness. Jay wanted to be the buffest President, not the baldest! <br />
<br />
It said a lot about Jay that this upset him more than any atrophy below. He would definitely stay away from actual steroids and hormones and junk. Then he moves his gigantic arms and felt his chest heave. Well, or at least lower doses and a doctor supervised regimen, he amended. But no, he thought again, he still had goals beyond the physical. The White House was a bigger prize than the Olympia, with richer benefits, trappings, and overall influence and power, even if it was less bodily.<br />
<br />
Still, while Jay&#39;s vanity was stung a little, there was no denying the sheer intoxication of being this size, of feeling the heaviness, the strength, the sheer hyper testosterone drive. He was no oil painting now, but he was beyond any sculpture of Atlas. He felt his shoulders, or at least as much as he could with his altered flexibility. He spread his arms high and saw the slabs reach wider than some doorways. He tried that side pose he&#39;d seen competitors do in magazines or on TV, and definitely felt like a hulking titan. <br />
 <br />
He&#39;d have to do that crab walk thing now when he tried to move his legs. He definitely wouldn&#39;t be sprinting on a football field like this. He looked at the pile of clothes and tried the oversized stringer tank, which stayed on but did nothing to hide his pectoral cleavage. He went with the jean shorts, and struggled to cut the sleeves out of the flannel. The entire operation was almost a workout in itself for the roid bull Jay. He sat his bulk on his couch and tried to breathe, which was definitely coming out heavier, like the snorts of a musk ox or rhino. He glanced at his phone on the side table and saw it had been over 35 minutes for the whole process, and a text from Emma that she was around the corner. Boy, was she in for an experience, as was Jay. How could they even make love without risking damage to her? How did those professional freaks do it?<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Emma came up and a voice rumbled “Come in, it&#39;s not locked.” She went into the apartment and saw a massive man, hugely and even grotesquely muscular, with a primitive face... and intense blue eyes.<br />
<br />
“What, who... are you... Jay?”<br />
<br />
Jay smirked. “Yeah, sweetheart. I know it&#39;s a huge difference, and I hadn&#39;t bargained on looking like such a goon myself. Still, I&#39;m a swole as hell goon! Also, it&#39;s still a temporary change like last time.” He flexed his arms and then placed them impressively by his swollen waistline. <br />
<br />
Emma was shocked, a little concerned, a lot impressed, and more than a little aroused. She liked athletic and muscular dudes, but she always wanted to stay away from the roidheads like Nolan. And now Jay was a bigger roider than anyone on campus. He sure wasn&#39;t aesthetic, but he radiated power. Also, Emma had worried a little about her boyfriend&#39;s time as Jaya and how he really got into being a woman. Now, he&#39;d pushed himself to the other extreme as far as possible. In an odd way, it was reassuring, suggesting he was indeed just experimenting every direction. So she shouldn&#39;t feel concerned about any masculine or feminine switches. Plus this one at least she could have sex with... maybe?<br />
Jay looked at her expression. “Yeah, I thought about that too, Babe. The bed would break, I&#39;ve already near ruined the couch. To do it safely, we should try on the floor, more side by side, or you exploring on top. I&#39;m still figuring out what I have here and how limber I am as  a whale. So start slow? We can figure out anything else after.”<br />
<br />
Emma had to grin at how ridiculous, and kind of hot, the situation was. She waited while the enormous Jay settled himself down, then started to massaging his shoulders. Or trying to, these things were hard and heavy, but she could tell from Jay&#39;s breathing and motions that he was liking the touch of her small but long fingers. She moved towards his back, but then stopped to try to feel the arms, especially those insane tree bark twigs which protruded. Jay groaned heavily. He gave her time to move off and feel the front. She felt his massive pecs. “Jay, your tits are bigger than mine or any woman I&#39;ve met.”<br />
<br />
Jay rumbled a laugh at that. Emma felt his nipples and the sensation sent a thrill up his spine. Maybe not as sensitive as Nolan&#39;s, but it still felt hella good. <br />
<br />
The exploration took over a half hour itself. They tried liplocking with Jay kneeling down on his heavy wheels, and then fell back on the floor groping some more. Jay still felt clumsy but let his sausage like fingers touch Emma&#39;s neck. She asked him to pick her up, and after awhile they got a little more... adventurous.<br />
<br />
Jay was sweating heavily, as much from his new form as the exertion. He checked the time, it was still not quite 3pm after all of that. Hmm, he really wanted to try his strength at the gym, and maybe Nolan would still be there. While he was probably near unrecognizable, though, there was still the risk, the explanations, or rumors of drug use, and wonders when he changed back. He&#39;d bought plenty of clothes, and he could tweak the Chronivac a little more... <br />
<br />
He turned to Emma, who looked a bit tuckered but satisfied herself. “Em, I want to really test out this new body. I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll head to the gym, unless you want to go out clubbing or even to a bar. But really, I want to try this freaky body on some actual weights. Would you mind?”<br />
<br />
Emma was still drinking in this form of Jay. “I&#39;m fine either way, though I could use the rest myself, and I can see myself home. Are you going out dressed like this?”<br />
<br />
Jay had to smile again. “Hey, I might as well really go full muscle goon. I&#39;m gonna make a couple of changes and then be ready to head out.”<br />
<br />
Emma waited, and Jay came back, sporting a thick full beard. He&#39;d darkened his skin a little, like a weathered tan. He&#39;d changed into sweat pants, which still clung a bit tight, an originally oversized black work-out tee, and a chain pendant which Emma didn&#39;t even know he&#39;d owned. With sunglasses, the work boots, and bandanna tied back to cover his baldness, Jay was every oversized inch the stereotypical muscle headed bro.  <br />
Emma laughed. “When you go muscle goon, you go muscle goon. You don&#39;t want to be recognized even just slightly, huh?”<br />
<br />
Jay said, “Yeah, that&#39;s the idea. This time, I think I&#39;ll use the name Jackson.” Jay again tried to stretch his massive form, and this time felt a little less like a clumsy elephant. Yeah, this would be a blast. Now...</p>
