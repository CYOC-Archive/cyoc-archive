<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When the clock struck eight, the doors were opened and a crowd of anthros flooded the barroom. Before long, the tables and bar were <br />
filled up and a line was forming outside. After all, there were only nine tables. Brer gave Jake his nametag, which read &quot;LUTRO: <br />
Assistant Floor Manager&quot;. He got to work immediately. Checking the schedule, he saw that Dean was with the first group of waiters. He <br />
happened to be reading out loud when he said &quot;Dean&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-uh,&quot; Brer stopped him. &quot;While you're here, you have to call each boy by their work name. He's not Dean, he's Bandit. You're not <br />
Jake, you're Lutro. Get in the habit of using them all the time so you don't slip up in front of a customer. I know it sounds weird, but the <br />
customers like the nicknames better. For example, do you think my name is really Brer? It's your name now, though, got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake...no, Lutro...nodded in understanding. He went back to the list to practice the names: Bandit—Raccoon—Tables 1/4/7—Rotation <br />
with Wes—Weasel. <br />
<br />
&quot;I thought Wes was a dancer,&quot; he questioned Brer. <br />
<br />
&quot;He asked to switch, and since you accepted this position we just moved his name over instead of making Lago work a full shift.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; The other groups were: Stripes—Skunk—Tables 2/5/8—Rotation with Red—Red Panda; Skitz—Squirrel—Tables 3/6/9—Rotation <br />
with Dundee—Crocodile.  Dancers were: Fennec—Fennec Fox; Onca—Panther; Varg—Wolf. <br />
<br />
Lutro looked out across the barroom. Bandit, Stripes, and Skitz were busy waiting on their tables and Fennec wouldn't dance for <br />
another hour. There was a vast assortment of animal types in the bar, even including a few humans; all of them were males. The <br />
waiters took their tables' orders and came back tithe bar to fill them. While they waited, Lutro got to know them. He had already spoken <br />
with Bandit on the boat, but found out that he had already been bisexual. Stripes was a couple years older than Lutro. He had first <br />
worked at Club Merah during Lago's first year. He hadn't wanted to stay, but he felt like he couldn't leave. When he did, he stayed away <br />
for a year, but something made him come back. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know what it is,&quot; he spoke in a low voice so that Brer wouldn't hear him, &quot;but something pulled me back here. When I was away, <br />
this place was all I could think about. I wasn't even gay before I came here, but now I can enjoy either gender the same. Just be careful <br />
not to let it suck you in like it did me.&quot;<br />
<br />
This conversation disconcerted Lutro a little, but he figured it must be the magic of the island. Since he was going to learn to control <br />
magic, he figured he wouldn't have to worry. Skitz was several years younger than Lutro, but he had been coming here for two years. <br />
Apparently, Red was his older brother who had brought him here. Skitz didn't seem to have a full grasp of what was going on. He said <br />
he &quot;played restaurant&quot; and sometimes &quot;pet&quot; and that Red gave him some money every day. Lutro wasn't sure what to say to the boy, so <br />
he let him go back to work. He didn't think Red was a very good brother.<br />
<br />
The boys had their own table next to the bar where Lago and the off-duty waiters sat. Lutro got to talk with them and learned even <br />
more. Lago had come here three years ago with Stripes and found out his sexuality. He offered to stay all summer when Stripes left <br />
and fell in love with Club Merah. He was a nice kid, but his life as a child prostitute made him very lewd. He didn't think twice about <br />
detailing his encounters with the customers. Ozzy had helped him out, too, by telling his parents he was working at a summer camp for <br />
three months. Lago hated it when he had to go home for the fall. <br />
<br />
Dundee was a big guy: even though he was the same age as Lutro, he was about twice as big. He was really strong and muscular, but <br />
didn't seem to have the cocky attitude that usually goes with strength. He was a hockey player, but his parents were poor. He had to <br />
work at Club Merah to pay for his traveling expenses and gear. His meager living was probably why he was so nice. <br />
<br />
Red was a stumped for Lutro, he wasn't sure what to think of him. His parents were divorced and his mother left him and Skitz with their <br />
dad. His dad was rarely home and when he was he drank. He tried to avoid his father as much as possible, so every weekend when his <br />
dad came home, Red took Skitz with him to Club Merah. He knew his father wouldn't accept his homosexuality, so he kept it a secret. <br />
He had gone through hell when he discovered himself, trying to change his sexuality and mentally beating himself when he failed. When <br />
he finally accepted his sexuality, he decided to make sure Skitz didn't become bigoted like his dad. He brought Skitz here and <br />
introduced him to sex as a game, so that he would never hate his brother for being gay. Lutro didn't know if that was the best way to go <br />
about it, but he could sympathize with the boy's fears. <br />
<br />
Wes was the only one Lutro didn't learn about. He wouldnt talk to anyone and seemed to be in his own little world. Lutro felt that he <br />
must be scared and this was his way of defense. They all left him alone to come to grips with the situation in his own time. <br />
<br />
While the boys were talking, a commotion started over at Table 4. A leopard and cheetah were getting loud and being rude to Bandit. <br />
Lutro left the conversation and walked over to Brer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Should we see what's going on?&quot; he asked the bear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not yet, let's see if it blows over. If it starts to head south I'll motion Chuck over.&quot;<br />
<br />
The leopard was obviously drunk and the cheetah wasn't too far behind him. Bandit had brought them their drinks, but the leopard was <br />
insisting it wasn't right and that they wouldn't give him a tip. Bandit was doing pretty well to stay calm and apologized to the cats. He <br />
offered to trade their drinks and asked them what they wanted instead. After he took their order and went to walk away, the leopard <br />
reached out and grabbed his ass. The two cats roared in laughter as Bandit returned to the bar blushing fiercely. <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't let them get to you, Bandit,&quot; Brer tried to assure him. &quot;They're just drunk and mean. If they go much further I'll have Chuck kick <br />
them out. Just don't lose your cool.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded and returned to their table with the drinks. This time, the leopard went too far. He roared when Bandit brought the drinks and <br />
flipped the tray into the raccoon's face. Before Bandit could react, the leopard had grabbed him around the waist and was removing his <br />
thong. Lutro had just enough time to process this information when an orange streak flew across the room. The leopard went flying as <br />
Chuck punched him in the jaw. The cheetah stood up and lunged at him, but the tiger grabbed him in midair and threw him on the <br />
leopard. The two stood up and got ready to fight again when Chuck punched his open palm and two copies of himself appeared. Faced <br />
with three menacing tigers, the two cats decided it was better to run. They scurried out the door as Chuck and his two mirrors followed. <br />
<br />
Bandit ran over to the bar in fear and ran straight into Lutro. The otter held his friend close as be cried in shock. Back home, Lutro would <br />
have found this weird, but, considering the circumstances, he just let it happen. Bandit hugged him tight and he returned the favor. He <br />
didn't even think about the fact that Bandit's thong was still down and his friend's young member was touching his leg. He just hugged <br />
the raccoon until the tears subsided to heavy breathing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wes,&quot; Lutro heard Lago say, &quot;I think you need to take over early.&quot;</p>
