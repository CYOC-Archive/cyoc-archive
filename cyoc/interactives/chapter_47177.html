<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric had trouble sleeping through the night.  The bed may have been covered, but there wasn't an actual sheet to pull up to cover him, and it wasn't like he could get his old clothes on.  All he could dream about was his own huge cock, little wonder since it was the primary thing on his mind when he went to sleep.<br />
<br />
A voice finally pulled him from his sleep.  &quot;Wake up, Eric.&quot;  Eric's eyes opened, he was laying on his stomach, cock trapped between him and the bed, and not surprising there was a sticky wet pool covering the sheets.  He grabbed a clean corner of the sheets and wiped himself off as best he could.  &quot;You can take a shower in a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric finally registered the voice was coming from inside the room, not from the speakers.  Turning around he saw a man in a lab coat.  His short cropped hair was blond, setting off bright green eyes.  The man worked out obviously, the t-shirt worn under the coat stretched tight across his chest, but his khakis were a bit on the baggy side.  The man smiled.  &quot;I'm Mark, one of the Doctor's assistants.  I've been assigned to you for the duration of your stay.&quot;  He pointed to an intercom on the wall, then tapped a walkie-talkie on his belt.  &quot;You can use that to get in touch with me.  But I'll usually just be on the other side of one of those mirrors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm... hi?&quot;  Eric wasn't exactly sure where this was going, and after a moment of silence he spoke up again.  &quot;You're the only one?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark gave a short nod.  &quot;Indeed, each subject has an assistant assigned to them.  One of those mirrors is the observation room, the other is my room, so I can keep an eye on you.&quot;  He reached onto the table, grabbing a syringe.  &quot;It's time for your second injection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Second?! You can't make it bigger!  It's bad enough now..&quot;  Eric began to back away.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not going to do that, if anything it'll get smaller, for a while.&quot;  Mark tried to sound comforting motioning to a chair, &quot;Sit.  This one can go in your arm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Smaller?&quot;  Eric sat down in the chair, and without much ceremony, Mark gave him the injection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed.  We did this to record how extra testosterone would affect you.  Well, at 20, you're mostly fully grown.  So this serum will quickly reduce you to just before puberty, and then slowly age you back up over the next few weeks with the new heightened testosterone levels, then we'll compare it to the readings we took yesterday, and see if we need to run more tests.  The new size of your genitals is now part of your DNA, we had to let it sit overnight to make sure it took.  So it'll shrink because you're about to get younger.&quot;  Mark set the syringe down on the counter top.<br />
<br />
Eric wanted to run, but the serum was already inside him.  His eyes turned to the mirror, but there was nothing noticeably different about him, he was still this man with the rediculously huge cock.  Eric looked himself over again, and touched his chest, there was no hair there, it had only come in the last couple of years, he had been glad for at least a little and now it was gone.  Now that he was looking, his usual morning stubble was missing too.  Mark simply watched taking notes with a small notebook.<br />
<br />
Eric's treasure trail began to receed, as he got a bit thinner.  He had always been on the scrawny side, it was just his genetics.  Leg hair and arm hair began to lighten, turning to little more than fuzz as his pubes began to vanish.  He noticed everything looked bigger around him, no he was just getting smaller, the little bit of muscle he had turned back into baby fat around his cheeks and in his stomach.  The weight between his legs did lessen, his huge cock shrinking down, but instead of a pre-teens cock, it was still one that would put most grown men to shame.  Two feet reduced to eight inches, and it wasn't even erect, his balls looking like a pair of lemons that hung halfway down his thighs.  Looking in the mirror he saw his ten year old self looking back at him.  Messy brown hair, mostly scrawny except for a bit of baby fat.  It was just how he remembered himself, except for that cock that was bigger than the one he had as an adult before yesterday, that it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw.. You make a cute kid.&quot;  Mark closed the notebook.  <br />
<br />
Eric felt tears well up in his eyes, and he just started bawling.  &quot;I don't want to be a kid! I don't want to be a freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark knelt down, pulling Eric into a hug. &quot;Aw.. it's okay.  Two weeks and you'll be an adult again, and even better than you were before you'll see.&quot;  Mark stood up and headed for the door, grabbing Eric's clothes on his way out.  &quot;Remember to eat, the fridge is full, you're a growing boy and I wouldn't want to have to force feed you.  Call if you need anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric watched Mark leave and felt his heart sink.. when was this going to end?</p>
