<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey you two, did something happen or what? You both look a bit different. Well, maybe not entirely different, but I am fairly sure Rachel had a bit more of as ass, amd Jen didn&#39;t have a handle between her shoulder blades. Neither did Chiffon to be fair, but sometime last night she suddenly grew one. But seriously Rachel, what in the hell is up with your shoes? Look, I get dressing differently than normal, but cock shaped heels on a pair of stripper heels? Not really what I would consider a &quot;normal different look&quot;, if you know what I mean. It seems a bit too kinky if you ask me. And again, why are you so sunken into Jen&#39;s ass, and not wearing any kind of skirt or shorts? I am not really judging you too much, but just a little bit. Are you not embarrassed to be out in just a thong?&quot; Asked Samantha.<br />
<br />
Rachel did blush heavily when Samantha pointed out that she really was out in public with just a top and thong on. She hadn&#39;t really thought too much about it until now. As for the other points, what could she say? That due to her and Jen messing around last night, they modified their bodies using a curse? It may be the truth, but it isn&#39;t something she was really willing to share quite yet. <br />
<br />
Noticing her hesitation, Samantha held up a hand. &quot;Hey, I was mostly just curious. If you don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t share it, then don&#39;t. No pressure. But I do want to know where you got those heels from. I bet they can be used to fuck Jen super easily, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You have no idea.&quot; Admitted Rachel, &quot;But I can&#39;t tell you that because I do not really know myself. We just found them in Jen&#39;s room.&quot; Lied Rachel. Jen was about to speak up, but thanks to the pill she just took kicking in, she realized what Rachel was trying to do and kept quiet. If her rider wanted to keep the fun between the two of them, as her loyal bouncerbutt, how could Jen even think of refusing her rider&#39;s wishes? <br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, what should we do? You mentioned saddle bags, I think Jen would look good with some herself too. Wanna go get some?&quot; Suggested Rachel, quickly changing the topic. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I know where they are sold, just follow us.&quot; Samantha replied before tugging on Chiffon&#39;s skin band in order to direct her to the right store. Chiffon just giddily hopped and bounced her way until Samantha told her to stop. She was extremely excited for a special item that Samantha would be buying for her in addition to the saddle bags. A blindfold and a mouth bit, like horses have. <br />
<br />
Jen also decided to leave all of the steering to Rachel and simply bounced along with Chiffon until they came up to a shop. Samantha hopped down off of Chiffon and took out a leash, which she hooked up to the collar Chiffon was wearing. It was a very long leash, allowing for quite a few feet between Chiffon and Samantha. But it still was a leash. Rachel didn&#39;t dismount and simply steered Jen inside. Rachel decided that she wouldn&#39;t dismount Jen unless she absolutely had to. Due to not wearing practically any  additional clothing besides her thong and halter top, from the side, it looked as if she was actually absorbed into Jen&#39;s ass. And explaining how come her ass is now concave would be far to difficult to make up an excuse for. <br />
<br />
While they bounced down the aisles, Samantha had already found the saddle bags and called them over. Like she said earlier, Samantha went to find a clerk so she could have a custom one made. Rachel and Jen however found a nice tan one that complemented their skin tone well, and fit their ass perfectly, even when wrapped around Rachel&#39;s waist instead of being sat on top of. It was a special model meant to be used around a saddle. They also bought Jen a special bouncerbutt blanket and tarp-like drape for when it is cold or wet outside respectively.<br />
<br />
Since Rachel had only her cleavage to use for a pocket, and didn&#39;t bring her purse since Jen&#39;s bouncing would have made it quite a mess inside, Jen&#39;s denim apron now held both of their wallet&#39;s, and a few spare contents of their purses that could fit into the pouches and wouldn&#39;t bounce out. The total was surprisingly cheap too for such quality items. <br />
<br />
When the girls left the store, Jen and Rachel were wearing their new saddle bags and Chiffon was blindfolded. She did also have a bit, but Samantha didn&#39;t put it on for her as they were out with friends. She also planned to remove the blindfold whenever they stopped somewhere. But when they are on the move however, she wanted Chiffon to only move by her commands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Neat blindfold Chiffon&quot; complimented Jen. Chiffon turned towards the sound and said thanks, and that it was really turning her on not being able to see where she was bouncing towards. They both giggled, but Jen admitted that she isn&#39;t into that kind of play where she wants to be controlled entirely by Rachel. It was then decided that the four of them would all head over to get some lunch at a nearby restaurant. Since Chiffon and Samantha wanted to try out their new blindfold, they would take a lot longer to get to the place, so Jen and Rachel went on ahead to secure a spot for the four of them.</p>
