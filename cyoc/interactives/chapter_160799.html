<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James spent a few moments in post orgasmic bliss, his head still spinning from the fucking he had just received. Joan however had taken a step backwards, using the time to admire her handy work. It had been a long few weeks for her, sneaking out undetected just to keep James’ mule at bay. But she had won and just gotten her payoff. Sure, she had changed, the extra weight on her head hadn’t gone unnoticed, but she could live with that.<br />
<br />
After what seemed like an eternity of waiting James finally rolled over, spreading his arms wide, his breasts heaving up and down. Joan couldn&#39;t help notice that his chest was coated with cum, his cock had clearly shot off at some point as well. The look of pleasure was slowly draining from his face, that little moment of happiness that followed was quickly coming to an end, forcing him to deal with the new reality before him. He groaned as he sat upright, looking over his changed form. Immediately he noticed that his breasts seemed bigger, plumper. Guess that jealousy came back to bite him. Staring further down his body was the elephant in the room, The small hairy mound atop his abdomen, which two nipples poked out from.<br />
<br />
James pulled his eyes away from his own body, instead looking up at his mother before quickly averting them in shame. She had horns now. Two great big horns. “Mom I’m sorry…” He began, before Joan quickly interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Baby no! Don&#39;t apologise.” She came to sit beside him, wrapping her hand around his shoulders, though careful not to graze her horns against him. “Clearly you needed it. I don’t think it’s too bad.” She said, running her hands across her horns. “Besides, now I kinda look like that Star Battles Princess Lilah or whatever she’s called.” She jested, which got a small laugh out of James. “I take it that I was the sign you were looking for....”<br />
<br />
James sat for a moment, looking down at his chest. His new changes, how he felt about the whole ordeal. He loved every bit of it, more than he was expecting. Even seeing his breasts made him feel right. “It was… I don’t know what it means but I don’t feel like a man any more. I like my breasts, they make me feel cute! God I don’t know.” He buried his head in his hands.<br />
<br />
Joan thought for a moment. “I Have an idea…” She smiled, getting herself up off the bed and finding her son a towel. “Clean yourself up. I’ll just need a moment.” She headed towards the dresser while James rubbed himself down with the towel. She returned a few moments later with a stack of clothing. “Now, don’t say anything yet. Just work with me.” James nodded with a blush. Joan motioned him to stand as they started off with the first item - a bra. They worked their way up in sizes, until finally they found one that fit - A white bra with laced floral pattern adorning it. It pulled his breasts up and held them, almost giving the impression that they were bigger than they were. Even Joan was amazed when she looked at the size - a D Cup.<br />
<br />
The crimson shade remained glued to James’ cheeks as they tried on underwear next. Joan had also brought with her a pair of scissors she’d found, knowing that while some of these garments already had modifications, most did not compensate for James’ unique length. Joan tried on a pair of white underwear to match his Bra, making sure to cut a tail hole in the rear, and a large cutout for his package in the front. They sat rather firmly, and after a few short strides around his bedroom James’ was happy enough in them.<br />
<br />
They finally finished his ensemble with a loosely hung pleated skirt, a light blue garment with more floral patterns around the hemline; and a light grey shirt that covered his chest and arms. James stood in front of his bedroom mirror, spinning around in his new wardrobe as he blushed. It felt so surreal, but at the same time, so natural.<br />
<br />
“So how do you feel?” Joan asked, her arms crossed as she admired her handy work.<br />
<br />
“I-I think I love it.” James replied back, his hand on his chest as he looked at the new him. Even Joan had to admit how unmistakably feminine his frame was, the clothes just served to accentuate it. Even his face seemed a little softer, the fur from his ears softened his cheekbones a little and with how long his hair had gotten over the last month…<br />
<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to hear that dear.” She smiled, taking a moment as James continued to check himself out in the mirror. “Well, Henry and Jess are going to get a bit of a shock when they see the new James! That’s for sure.”<br />
<br />
“No…” James interjected, taking another moment to finish. “Not the new James. The new Jennifer!” Jennifer stood proud, shedding her old identity felt cathartic, this was right, this was who she was now. She could finally bury those conflicting emotions and move on. She had to wonder what Melssa would make of her now.<br />
<br />
“Ah - My little Jenny.” Joan said through lightly gritted teeth. ‘So you still haven’t got that damn donkey out of your brain.’ She thought. ‘Jenny...’<br />
<br />
“Well, either way. It’s late. You should head to bed… I’ll do the same. Introductions in the morning then.” She smiled softly, heading towards the door. <br />
<br />
:”Mom?” Jennifer called out as she left<br />
<br />
“Mhmm?”<br />
<br />
“Thank you” Jennifer smiled.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The next morning Jennifer awoke with a satisfied stretch, like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders. Excitedly she leapt out of bed, her breasts and udder jiggling away as she got herself dressed. Nervously, excitedly, she hurried down the stairs and towards the Cow’s Barn, wrapping her knuckles on their door.<br />
<br />
Henry was quick to answer, swinging open the wooden door as the strong smell of the barn hit her almost immediately. He froze in place for a moment, not knowing exactly what to say at the sight that lay before him. His son, in womens clothing, udder and breasts bulging, his masculinity dwindling. Henry’s lack of reaction spurred Jess’ curiosity as she poked her head around him, looking upon the visitor.<br />
<br />
“J-James?!” She exclaimed. Blow away by the transformation he’s undergone in such a short time. <br />
<br />
“Not anymore” Jennifer spoke softly, smiling at them both. “I’d prefer Jennifer, if you don’t mind.”</p>
