<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick could hardly believe what was happening. One minute he was on a hike through the preserve, another he was rushing to help an animal in trouble, and now he was in a romantic embrace with a beautiful six foot tall deer woman. Evidently, the deer woman considered him a potential boyfriend. Although the back of his mind was screaming at him to get away, and although he knew her overpowering natural chemicals were making his rational human mind fade to bestial attraction, Nick had to admit to himself he had found her attractive well before things had gone this far.<br />
<br />
Life had gotten strange quite quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Nick gulped, feeling the deer lean her head on his shoulder lovingly. &quot;Uh... do you have a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A name?&quot; The doe suddenly stiffened upright in surprise. She glanced into the trees and blinked. &quot;Should I?&quot; She returned her gaze to the human. &quot;Is that something you'd like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... no.&quot; Nick shook his head quickly. &quot;Er... I mean yes.&quot; He blinked at the deer's confusion and took a deep breath. &quot;What I mean is, do you not have a name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not sure. What is a name?&quot; The doe cocked her head to the side in innocent lack of understanding.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Nick began, unconciously wrapping his arm across the deer's back as her scent worked over him. &quot;A name is what people call you. I'm Nick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; Laura nodded. &quot;I see! Yes, I have a name.&quot; She paused dramatically. &quot;I think I am called Deer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no.&quot; Nick shook his head, hand stroking the doe's back tenderly. &quot;That is, like, what creature you are. Like, I'm a human called Nick. See?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh...&quot; The deer nodded. &quot;Yes. I see now. So I am a deer, but that is not my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Nick nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I don't believe I have a name, Nick.&quot; She smiled warmly, placing her hand in his. &quot;If you want me to have a name you can give me one!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, geez.&quot; Nick blushed. &quot;I don't think I know you well enough to give you your name. Uh...&quot; Suddenly his creeped out and alarm senses came back in full force. The spell of the animal woman's pheromones on his easily succeptible human body was wearing off. He rose with a nervous blush and collected his pack. &quot;I-I should probably be going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're leaving?&quot; The doe said with surprise. &quot;But... but I thought you were going to be my mate!&quot; She chased him toward the treeline with desperation. &quot;I enjoyed your touch, Nick. You are male, I am female, and we are both adults of capable of breeding!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly.&quot; Nick gulped and staggered back, almost tripping on a fallen branch. &quot;But I'm a human and you're a deer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; The doe let her muzzle fall sadly. &quot;Are we incompatible sexually?&quot; She quite innocently reached between her legs and parted the fur surrounding her vaginal lips, opening a pristine pink virginal slit that was moistened, willing, and ready. &quot;Is this not what human females have?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick's jaw dropped at the display of the gorgeous perfectly symmetrical pink deer pussy, dripping with lust... for him. And a new whiff of her gorgeously sweet and alluring scent wafted to his nose. He felt his boner rise again, harder this time. &quot;Uh, yes...  that's very nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; The deer smiled warmly, nodding. &quot;Then we are compatible. Good!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes... but... but...&quot; Nick tried desperately to flee, tried desperately to turn towards the trees and leave, but that pussy... that scent... the deer. Her warm soft breasts. Supple furred body. He felt pre beggining to leak at the thought of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I arouse you. And you arouse me.&quot; The deer drew closer. &quot;Yet you do not wish to mate with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You're an animal.&quot; Nick whispered. &quot;It's wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I walk on two legs instead of four. I have changed!&quot; She waved her hands over herself for emphasis. &quot;If I still walked on four legs it would be wrong, yes... but...&quot; She seemed to search for the right words to say. &quot;Perhaps my changing was meant for you. Perhaps you were meant to find me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick's resolve collapsed into a pile of debris in his feet. Her logic made insane sense. And technically, she was right... she wasn't an animal anymore. She was something else. Something different. He dropped his pack gently and smiled as she practically hopped with glee on her hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Nick gulped. &quot;Let's just take this slow. You're right. I want you and you want me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course, Nick!&quot; The doe nodded. &quot;Of course! I will do anything you say.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Nick drew close he found that the doe woman was a couple inches taller than him. And as he drew right in front of her he placed his hands on her hips gently, squeezing the fur and muscle beneath his palms. The deer seemed to positively glow with excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were scared.&quot; The doe said simply. &quot;But do not worry. I will be a very devoted mate. I will do everything for you, and do whatever you ask of me, and bear your young for you. We will raise a family together. And feel love and joy together. I will make you happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick blinked, his face softened, and he considered very carefully what she was saying. Even in his half sedated mind swimming with the deer's flowery pheromones, he thought that sounded beautiful. &quot;You're so beautiful.&quot; He whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; She whispered back, leaning in close, placing her own dainty hands on the small of his back. &quot;I think you are attractive as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
They pulled closer, bodies pressing together, the deer's soft fur against the human's clothes. Nick could feel the boiling warmth eminating from her well greased loins. Could feel his own cock swelling harder as he touched it to her groin. He gently raised his hands on her body, pulling his fingers through her thick fur, and their eyes met in tandem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will you be my mate?&quot; The deer asked gently. &quot;May I be yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Nick responded, placing his hands around her muscular neck, and gently, slowly, they touched lips again. Fireworks!<br />
<br />
When they pulled away, both creatures were trembling. &quot;I know I am ignorant of your kind, my mate. I must ask you to protect me in return for my devotion. Let no harm come of me. Can you do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can.&quot; Nick said simply, nodding solemnly. The doe watched as Nick placed his hands gently on her chest, her pert but smallish breasts, and began to massage and caress them.<br />
<br />
The deer smiled and closed her eyes. &quot;Yes... I like this. I makes my chest feel very tingly. And pleasant. I feel myself becoming wetter.&quot; She wrapped her arms around his back tighter and nuzzled the top of the human's head.<br />
<br />
&quot;This'll feel better.&quot; Nick whispered, and lowered his head to lick the deer's erect nipple. His tongue touched her fur at first, slicking it, but he was rewarded the second time with her soft pink nip in his mouth. He drew his tongue across it slowly, and grinned as he felt the deer's entire body tense and grow even warmer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, goodness! Yes!&quot; She gasped. &quot;You're right... that does feel better. You must be good at bringing pleasure to women of your kind.&quot; She licked her lips. &quot;You are making me more aroused.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Nick whispered, and proceeded to close his lips around her nipples, gently and experimentally sucking.<br />
<br />
The deer bucked her groin into him, grinding, and let out a moan. Her fingers dug into his back. &quot;Oh, goodness!&quot; She exclaimed, tears flowing from her face. &quot;Oh! That feels... so good. Please give me more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick giggled, and happily obeyed. He began sucking the deer's nipple in gentle but firm grasps of his lips. She loved it apparently, as she began to fondle his body in response, in rapture.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Nick! You are making me lose control of myself! This feels so good.&quot;<br />
<br />
He let go gently, and looked up to see her weeping eyes. &quot;Oh! Don't stop! I never imagined I could be so pleasured in this body. Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot; Nick nodded, and proceeded to suck on the *other* nipple. By now, the deer's nipples were swollen and evident, and to Nick's keen delight a warm sweet substance began to flow into his mouth in drops. He drew his mouth away and gasped as saw yellowish milky drops. &quot;Y-You're lactating!&quot;<br />
<br />
Gasping, the doe nodded in dreamy lust. &quot;Yes, of course! My body is ready for children.&quot; She grinned. &quot;Once I am pregnant I will make much more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick blushed again, savoring the taste of her milk in his mouth. &quot;Wow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not it is my turn to pleasure you, my mate.&quot; The deer announced sweetly. &quot;It is not fair that you should please me and I not return the same. What may I do for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Nick blinked, eyes widening. &quot;Do you... know... anything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can teach me.&quot; The doe said softly, seductively. &quot;Will you teach me?&quot;</p>
