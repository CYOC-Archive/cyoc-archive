<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus stood frozen in disbelief as Oliver confidently held the container of age goop in his hand. The tables had turned, and now it was Oliver&#39;s turn to take advantage of the transformative power. The once scrawny 14-year-old boy was about to undergo a remarkable metamorphosis into a fully-grown, muscular 22-year-old man. The anticipation filled the air, and Marcus couldn&#39;t help but feel a mix of awe and envy.<br />
<br />
With a mischievous grin on his face, Oliver glanced at his brother and said, &quot;You know, Marcus, I think it&#39;s time for the little brother to become the big brother.&quot; He then proceeded to remove his shirt, revealing a lean yet athletic physique that held great potential for growth.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t be serious, Oliver!&quot; Marcus exclaimed, his voice tinged with a mixture of surprise and frustration. &quot;Give me the goop! I&#39;m the one who deserves to be older now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver chuckled, his voice now deeper and more resonant than before. &quot;Oh, come on, Marcus. You had your turn. Now it&#39;s mine. Besides, I&#39;m already older than you, and soon I&#39;ll be even older than you can imagine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring his brother&#39;s protests, Oliver confidently swallowed the contents of the container. The transformation began almost instantaneously, and Marcus could only watch in awe as his little brother&#39;s body began to change before his eyes.<br />
<br />
First, Oliver&#39;s height shot up dramatically, surpassing Marcus&#39; own stature. The once 5&#39;6&quot; boy now stood well over 6 feet tall, his body elongating with each passing second. His limbs lengthened, gaining strength and proportion. Marcus couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of envy as he realized he would no longer hold the title of the tallest sibling.<br />
<br />
As the transformation progressed, Oliver&#39;s muscles began to bulge and ripple. His biceps expanded into massive, defined peaks, straining against the skin. His chest broadened, forming a chiseled wall of pectoral muscles that emphasized his newfound masculinity. The once-flat stomach tightened and revealed a set of six-pack abs that looked like they were carved from stone.<br />
<br />
Veins began to surface, tracing intricate patterns across Oliver&#39;s sculpted arms and torso. Every muscle fiber seemed to be etched with strength and power. The transformation completed itself with Oliver&#39;s face maturing, his features becoming more defined and angular, projecting an air of confidence and maturity.<br />
<br />
Marcus was left speechless as he stared up at his now-22-year-old brother, who was the epitome of strength and physical prowess. The contrast between them was stark, and Marcus couldn&#39;t help but feel a mix of admiration and a twinge of inferiority.<br />
<br />
Oliver flexed his newly acquired muscles, relishing in the power and dominance he now possessed. He towered over Marcus, casting a long shadow, both literally and metaphorically.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Marcus,&quot; Oliver said with a smug grin, &quot;What do you think? Little brother got even bigger, didn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver stood before Marcus, his transformed physique on full display. He wasted no time in relishing his newfound strength and stature. With a commanding presence, he reached down and unbuttoned his now too tight bottoms, revealing a pair of boxers that clung tightly to his muscular form.<br />
<br />
His voice, now deeper and more resonant than ever, echoed through the room as he began to check out his own muscles, flexing each group with a self-assured confidence.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at these abs, Marcus,&quot; Oliver exclaimed, his voice dripping with satisfaction. He tightened his core, causing his well-defined six-pack to ripple and contract, each muscle fiber clearly visible. &quot;You could do a thousand crunches a day, and you still wouldn&#39;t come close to this kind of definition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus couldn&#39;t help but feel a pang of jealousy as he observed his once scrawny little brother boasting about his impressive physique. The contrast between them was undeniable, and Oliver made sure to drive the point home.<br />
<br />
&quot;And check out these biceps,&quot; Oliver continued, bringing his arm up and flexing his massive bicep. The muscle bulged, straining against the skin, showcasing the strength and power it held. &quot;I could crush you with just one hand now, Marcus. You&#39;re practically a twig compared to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He shifted his attention to his chest, puffing it out proudly. &quot;These pecs, Marcus. Solid muscle. Not an ounce of fat. Bet you wish you had a chest like this, huh? Maybe then you wouldn&#39;t feel so insignificant standing next to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oliver&#39;s mocking tone stung, and Marcus felt a mix of anger and helplessness. He had willingly turned himself into a child, not anticipating that his younger brother would undergo such a dramatic transformation. Oliver&#39;s newfound physical superiority was impossible to ignore.<br />
<br />
As Oliver continued his self-assured display, he flexed his thighs, revealing their impressive size and definition. &quot;Leg day is no joke, little bro. Look at these tree trunks. You wouldn&#39;t last a minute in the gym with me now. I&#39;m a powerhouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
He finished off by flexing his broad shoulders, showcasing the width and strength he had gained. &quot;I&#39;m not just bigger than you now, Marcus. I&#39;m stronger, more muscular, and more mature in every way. You&#39;re just a kid, while I&#39;ve become a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus clenched his fists, trying to maintain his composure. He had expected a shift in dynamics between them, but he hadn&#39;t anticipated just how much Oliver would revel in his newfound physical dominance.<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t worry, Marcus,&quot; Oliver said, a smirk playing on his lips. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure to look out for you. After all, it&#39;s my responsibility as the big brother now, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ll protect you from all those bullies you used to deal with. You&#39;re lucky to have me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mix of superiority and condescension in Oliver&#39;s voice grated on Marcus&#39; nerves, but he knew that challenging his older, more muscular brother would only lead to more frustration. He took a deep breath, reminding himself that this was the consequence of his own decision to turn back time.</p>
