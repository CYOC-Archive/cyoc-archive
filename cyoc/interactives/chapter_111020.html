<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jesse couldn&#39;t believe what he had seen. Nick had been completely changed by the computer program and had no clue that there was anything different or strange about him and what he was doing. To the contrary, he was acting as though he had been that way all along. Trying not to panic Jesse went back to the computer to see if he could learn more about the workings of the Chronivac program. He pulled up the changes he had made to Nick&#39;s file and looked them over carefully before clicking the question mark icon up on the top corner of the window. The changes themselves were self explanatory so he instead focused on the other options he had selected. By mousing over them he got detailed descriptions of each of the different options and what he had selected for them meant. The duration option determined how long the change would last before the subject reverted to normal, the length of transformation option controlled how long the actual changes took to reach completion. It was the awareness settings that were the most revealing though. By turning off subject awareness, like he had, it meant that the transformed individual would not notice anything strange about themselves. Selecting for reality to adjust meant that things like clothing and housing would change along with the person, not to mention that other people would not see the person as having changed in any way. That explained why Nick had ended up dressed the way he was as well as why he thought there was nothing unusual about his appearance or actions.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Now that he understood how the program worked Jesse found himself even more curious about what it could do. First things first though.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;He went to Nick&#39;s file and turned subject awareness on, hit apply and was rewarded by a gasp from Nick&#39;s room.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing?&quot; Jesse called to his friend, &quot;Can you believe this or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;There was a bit of noise as Nick disentangled himself, then &quot;This is so crazy!&quot; An understatement if there ever was one.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;How do you feel?&quot; Jesse asked, fully expecting Nick to be furious. As such, his friend&#39;s response came as quite the surprise.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly? It&#39;s kind of cool in a really weird way,&quot; Nick chuckled. By the sound of his voice he had left his bedroom and was making his way back to the computer, &quot;I know I should be upset, but the humiliation of all this...it&#39;s really hot. I mean just thinking about how I have no control over what was done to me is horrible, but because of the changes I&#39;m turned on by it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;As he finished speaking he arrived in the room, still in the bondage gear that the Chronivac program had transformed his clothing into. There were red welts across his stomach and thighs where he had been hitting himself with the riding crop that the Chronivac had made appear in his room and it was obvious, from the throbbing bulge on the leather strap across his crotch, that he had been enjoying himself a great deal, in fact, the way he was squirming and occasionally squeezing his pecs and giving the little weights hanging from his pierced nipples a pull revealed that he was still very aroused.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Jesse tried not to stare, not that he thought Nick would be upset, &quot;Okay...but do you want to be changed back?&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Nick was silent for a very long while, then softly, in a very timid voice, &quot;If it pleases you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Of course, the mental changes, Nick was super submissive. This had Jesse even more curious, &quot;Think about how you used to be just earlier today, don&#39;t you want to go back to that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;This time Nick nodded so hard the weights hanging from his pecs bounce up and down, the pain causing him to let out a gasp, &quot;Oh yes. It&#39;s so humiliating to be this way that I love it. I want to change back so badly, but I have to be a good little pet. A good little pet can&#39;t touch its Master&#39;s property though, and most of all it can’t be disobedient, so I can&#39;t change back.&quot; Nick dropped to his knees, groveling, &quot;Please let me be the way I was.&quot; The most shocking thing about what he was seeing, Jesse realized, was that Nick was so blatantly turned on by what he was doing.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Suddenly afraid, Jesse turned back to the computer and quickly set Nick&#39;s file back to its default settings.&#8232;&#8232;In an instant Nick was fully clothed in the same outfit he had put on that morning.&#8232;&#8232;&quot;What the hell?&quot; Nick leapt back to his feet, &quot;That was so scary. It was horrible. At first I had no clue, then I knew what had happened and I liked it.&quot; &#8232;&#8232;His eyes were wide with alarm.&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I actually enjoyed how horrible it was,&quot; he shuddered.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Jesse said, equally frightened, but still intrigued, &quot;What should we do now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Forget any of it ever happened?&quot; Nick offered cautiously.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;It was a suggestion Jesse was willing to go along with, but maybe not just yet, &quot;Okay, I guess, but you really had no idea at first?&quot;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&quot;None,&quot; Nick shook his head, &quot;It all felt totally normal.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
That was hard to believe and as crazy as it was, Jesse wanted to see for himself, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it. I mean none of it seems possible to begin with, but as strange as it is, I want to see for myself.&quot; &#8232;&#8232;Nick looked at him like he was crazy.&#8232;&#8232; &quot;Could you use the program to do something to me?&quot; Jesse continued, &quot;Think of it as a game. I want to see if I can figure out what&#39;s different.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
After a thoughtful silence Nick nodded, obviously as curious as Jesse was and maybe starting to understand the implications of having a machine that could change reality, &quot;Okay, but you&#39;re sure it won&#39;t be permanent?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Positive,&quot; Jesse reassured and then walked Nick through how the different settings worked, making sure that he put for reality to adjust and for subject awareness to be set off. When it came time to make the actual changes he turned away, wanting to be surprised, but there was one thing he made sure to mention, &quot;See about the physical changes option, that might be easier for me to guess since I&#39;ll know to look for something rather than having to try and guess what&#39;s different about the way I&#39;m thinking.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Okay,&quot; Nick said slowly, then started to chuckle, &quot;Oh wow, the physical changes cover everything. Some of them are really crazy too.&quot;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&quot;Just don&#39;t say what you&#39;re doing,&quot; Jesse chuckled back, &quot;I want to figure it out on my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Sure,&quot; Nick was still chuckling as he scrolled and clicked his way through a number of different options, &quot;Some of these are pretty out there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Well, pick a crazy one then,&quot; Jesse said quickly.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure?&quot; Nick asked with a nervous chuckle.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;That was exactly what he wanted, something really easy to notice and he said as much, &quot;Yes I&#39;m sure. I want something that there&#39;s no way for me not to notice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;If you insist...&quot; he trailed off as he went back to clicking and searching.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Are you done yet?&quot; Jesse wondered, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, anxious for things to start and see what it would feel like. He was sure that he would notice the changes and he was curious to find out what his friend had picked for him. All the chuckling had him certain that it was something really crazy.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Just a sec more,&quot; Nick said happily, &quot;And done. I set the changes to take ten minutes so it might take a few before anything&#39;s really noticeable. It&#39;s going to be wild.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; Jesse muttered, looking down at himself, waiting to see when the changes would begin, sure that he would notice them despite subject awareness having been turned off. Even after having seen what happened with his friend he was sure that he would be able to know. After all, if the change was big enough, there was no way he could miss it, right?<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;He looked carefully at his hands and arms, wondering what the changes would be and seeing nothing. Absentmindedly he adjusted his bra strap, looking down at his breasts pressing against his shirt, the same b-cup as ever. Everything seemed normal there too, his perky, round breasts pulling the fabric of his shirt tight against his chest. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, though it hadn&#39;t even been a minute yet, so there probably wasn&#39;t anything to see. &#8232;&#8232;Nick was watching him intently, his lips pressed tight as he tried to hide a smile.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;What?&quot; Jesse wondered. Nick shook his head, apparently not trusting himself to keep from blurting something out. &#8232;&#8232;&quot;Well, the changes sure are slow starting,&quot; Jesse sighed, &quot;Maybe you should have picked something more drastic. At this rate I might not notice them at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;A minute more passed uneventfully and Jesse was starting to get frustrated at the lack of visible changes. He was also thirsty and at least that was something he could fix. He went to the kitchen, Nick following closely behind him, and went to the sink to get himself a big glass of water.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;As he drank he continued examining himself, paying careful attention to the pale green skin of his hands, but not seeing anything out of the ordinary. Once again he adjusted his shirt, which he had to admit was probably a bit too small for him, which was a shame since he liked the style, especially the way it clung to his d-cup breasts, which he thought were one of his best features. Big and firm as they were, he had no need to wear a bra to support their roundness, meaning that his large, dark nipples were plainly visible through the fabric. He gently rubbed one through the fabric of his shirt, waiting for the changes to become noticeable. But even his breasts were perfectly normal, and he had been sure that those would have been what Nick went for when picking out the changes.  &#8232;&#8232;The sun shining in through the window over the sink felt so good, and he stopped stroking himself to brush back his vines and turn his head slightly so that more of his leaves would be in the sun. As he did this he caught a glimpse of his reflection in the window glass, noting how long his vines were and how abundant the leaves growing from them were. They had really gotten long and thick, to the point where they were starting to get unmanageable. Some of the biggest vines were as big around as his little finger and reached down to the small of his back. The largest leaves on them were easily as big as the palm of his hand and some of the ones that had yet to unfurl looked like they were going to be even bigger. The wild tangle framed his pale green face nicely.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Still waiting to see when he would notice the changes Nick had picked for him, Jesse turned on the tap to get another glass of water. As the water flowed into the glass Jesse felt his belly bump into the counter and frowned as he looked down at it, the round swell of his midriff just visible past his breasts. he gave his swollen stomach a gentle pat, feeling how smooth and firm it was. As big and ripe as his belly was, it made shopping for clothing difficult. The roundness of his stomach had pushed up his shirt to reveal his belly with its dark and light green stripes. He tried to pull his shirt down over his stomach, but it proved impossible, between his belly and breasts there just was just too much for it to cover. It wasn&#39;t too bad though, the sun felt as good on his exposed belly as it felt on his leaves and vines.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Finishing his second glass of water, he started filling up a third, &quot;I&#39;m not noticing anything yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Really?&quot; Nick looked at him, eyes wide.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Really,&quot; Jesse scowled, &quot;You must have chosen something too subtle, but I&#39;m going to look myself over more thoroughly, just to be sure.&quot; &#8232;&#8232;He finished his third glass of water and went to his bedroom, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;On the back of the door was a full length mirror and he looked at himself in it. He could see his dark and light green striped belly, big around as a beach ball, pushing out from under his shirt. Wondering if maybe his change was hidden by his clothing he pulled off his shirt, freeing his enormous triple d-cup breasts from the tight confines of the fabric. Like the rest of his skin they were a smooth pale green, though his nipples, each a puffy two inches long, were a much darker shade. He gently stroked the firm flesh of his breasts, admiring their size and roundness, appropriately resembling a pair of watermelons. Nothing to see there. Frowning, he pulled down his pants and then his panties, using the mirror to examine between his legs. His flower was the same as ever, nestled amidst a tangle of short, fine vines, pale green leaves closed in a tight bud over its fleshy petals. Gently he stroked those leaves, feeling a rush of warmth run through him. Maybe Nick had changed his flower in some way? Just to be sure Jesse continued to stroke himself. Responding to the attention his bud began to open, revealing his thick, soft petals, flushed deep yellow with arousal and glistening with sweet nectar. &#8232;&#8232;Pleasant as what he was doing was, it did nothing to reveal what, if any changes had taken place.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Forced to admit defeat, he gave his flower one last little rub, sticking his finger deep into its moist interior and further moistening his petals with his fragrant juices, &quot;Alright Nick, I&#39;ve got nothing. Turn on the awareness option.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Nick laughed from the computer.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Jesse froze in mid stroke, his arousal vanishing as he realized what was going on. The computer had managed to turn him into a watermelon girl without him even noticing it. The flower that his cock had become folded closed into a tight little bud, nectar dripping between its sealed leaves. Above it, his massive, watermelon striped belly heaved with every fearful breath he took and his impossibly large and firm breasts shook. The vines and leaves that had taken the place of his hair rustled as he moved, running his hands over his changed body, shocked that he had changed so much without noticing. It had all felt so normal while it had been happening, until Nick had changed the settings on the computer. The most shocking part had to be that it still felt so normal. His massive breasts, so big that they actually rested on top of his heavy, swollen belly felt so natural. More than that, even though he knew perfectly well that he had only been the way he was now for a few minutes, he had recollections of having been a watermelon girl for all his life thanks to the adjust reality setting.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;What do you think?&quot; Nick called to him.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Jesse let out a nervous laugh, &quot;It&#39;s crazy.” He realized that he still had his masculine voice despite being completely female everywhere else on his body. “I know that this isn&#39;t normal, but it feels like it is and I even have memories that go with it. I actually remember being a little plant girl, that when I hit puberty the bud between my legs started to get bigger and that when it started opening into a flower I started playing with it and accidentally pollinated myself. That&#39;s actually how I remember it, that I pollinated myself back in high school and since then my breasts and belly kept growing as I got riper. Again, that&#39;s actually how I remember it, getting riper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Wow, that is crazy,&quot; Nick let out a nervous laugh as well, &quot;Do you want me to change you back yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;Believe it or not, no,&quot; Jesse was shocked by his decision, but he wanted to talk more about the crazy memories he had, &quot;You mind if I tell you how crazy all this is?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;No, not at all. It&#39;s actually really cool, this program, now that we sort of know what it does,&quot; came Nick&#39;s eventual response. &#8232;&#8232;Jesse was in total agreement with that.&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
Slowly he got dressed, marveling at how he automatically adjusted for the weight of his belly and breasts when he bent down to pick up his clothing. When he left his room to join Nick in the living room, he without even thinking about it, sat down in a chair that was placed by a window, letting the sun shine in on his vine-hair and his exposed belly.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;Nick stared at him, then smiled, &quot;What&#39;s it feel like?&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;That took some thinking, since &#39;normal&#39; was the first thought that sprang to mind, but that wasn&#39;t quite true. After some thinking and enjoying the sun, Jesse reached a strange conclusion, &quot;Pretty good actually.&quot;&#8232;&#8232;<br />
<br />
&quot;I felt the same way about my changes,&quot; Nick agreed, &quot;They freaked me out, but that panic, because of what the changes did to my mind, only made me like it more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;&quot;This is kind of different,&quot; Jesse said, &quot;For me it&#39;s that the sun feels so good on my leaves and skin and my breasts feel so tender that even the pressure of my shirt on them feels good and I like the heaviness of my belly. Like I said, it&#39;s crazy and I have all these crazy memories that go with it. I told you that I remember pollinating myself in high school and how a few months later, during summer vacation, my belly first started to get ripe. It was so slow that it was another year before it was really visible and it&#39;s been growing since, along with my breasts and they kept getting more sensitive as they got bigger. Like right now they&#39;re so sensitive just putting on my shirt was enough to get me blossoming.&quot;&#8232;&#8232; They both burst out laughing at that statement.<br />
<br />
&#8232;&#8232;When they recovered Nick looked back at the computer, &quot;So, should I change you back now?&quot;</p>
