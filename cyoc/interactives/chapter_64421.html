<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kylie stared at the now very masculine form of Jennifer Smith, gorilla like arms hanging awkwardly at her <br />
sides, football jersey taut across her broad shoulders. Beside her stood the now pretty and buxom form of Tom, <br />
breasts large and round pressing tight into his cheer uniform. Both stood still, resigned to their fates and <br />
praying they would be let go. Kylie decided to grant them mercy.<br />
&quot;You both can go, I've had enough fun with you... for now.&quot; With those words tension bled from the two swapped <br />
teens and they fled the stage, Jen clomping heavily and Tom stepping daintily down the stairs. Once they had <br />
rejoined others Kylie swept her gaze around the costumed figures, looking for a new victim. <br />
She saw many people she knew and hated from school but it wasn't until she saw the red headed Kimberly, <br />
dressed from head to toe in a black witches costume similar to the one Kylie wore herself that she picked one. <br />
&quot;Kim.&quot; She spoke into the microphone. &quot;It's your time, bring your date and take the stage.&quot; Kylie could almost <br />
see the young girl's face pale but to her credit Kim started slowly toward the stage. She came alone.<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Kylie smiled. &quot;Did sweet Kimberly not get a date for the party? How can this be?&quot; By that time <br />
Kim had stumbled onto the stage and into the spotlight. &quot;Well... answer me Kim.&quot; Kylie ordered. <br />
&quot;I.. I didn't want a date..  I only wanted to come with my friend Bethany.&quot; Kim stammered weakly looked down <br />
at her black high heels. Kylie's eyes shone with a dark humor that made Kim take a step back. <br />
&quot;Oh well in that case she should join you up here!&quot; Kylie started. &quot;We wouldn't want you to be up here alone <br />
would we? Come on up Beth, don't be shy!&quot; At first no one in the crowd moved but a moment later a short blond <br />
girl dressed as an angel, glittery halo hung above her head and dressed in a white dress, made her way to the <br />
stage to stand with her friend. <br />
&quot;Perfect! The witch and the angel! Well I think I know just the thing for this. And I'll even been nice this <br />
time.&quot; Kylie said, her lips pursed into a sly smile. &quot;As long as you both do exactly what I say I promise I <br />
won't change either of you physically.&quot; Both girls seemed to gain a little hope from this and stood a little <br />
taller. &quot;Now, to start, I want you two to grasp both of the others hands and face each other.&quot; They each <br />
glanced at the other, only hesitating a moment, before doing exactly what Kylie had asked.<br />
&quot;Excellent! Now look into each others eyes and do not look away unless I say.&quot; The two girls did so without <br />
protest. &quot;Now, Beth, I want you to tell Kimberly what you want to do to her. She is your date tonight after <br />
all.&quot; Beth blushed.<br />
&quot;I... I don't want.. I'm not like that. I don't want to do anything to her.&quot; She managed to keep her eyes <br />
locked on Kim's, even though she was talking to Kylie. Kylie frowned. <br />
&quot;Are you so sure Bethany? You don't want want to do anything at all to her? Doesn't she look so great in that <br />
costume? Look at her lips, so soft and smooth, absolutely kissable wouldn't you say?&quot; As Kylie spoke she <br />
pointed a finger and the angel dressed Beth and motioned as if she were turning a switch within Beth from off <br />
to on. Beth did look at Kim's lips then and she blushed even deeper. &quot;Go ahead Beth. Tell her what you want to <br />
do to her now.&quot;<br />
&quot;I.. I want to kiss you Kim.&quot; Beth mumbled quietly, her eyes cast down. Kim took a step back, looking shocked. <br />
&quot;Was that any way to ask her Beth? You weren't even looking at the poor girl. Why don't you try that again?&quot; <br />
Beth lifted her head and met Kim's eyes once more and this time spoke loudly, almost defiantly. <br />
&quot;I really want to kiss you Kim, right on your sexy pink lips.&quot; This time it was Kimberly's turn to look away, <br />
face pale. Kylie turned to her now.<br />
&quot;Is that any answer to give your date Kim? She stepped up and told you how she really feels, the least you can <br />
do is do the same. Now look at Beth and tell her.&quot; Kim complied, shaking only a little.<br />
&quot;I don't want to kiss you Beth. You are my friend and I really like you but you are a girl. I'm sorry.&quot; She <br />
didn't take her eyes from her friends.<br />
&quot;You too Kim? How do you know you don't want to kiss a girl? Have you ever tried it? Maybe you should look <br />
again. Look at Beth's lips.&quot; Kim looked but made no further motion. Kylie repeated the switch motion she had <br />
made for Beth but this time for Kim. Kim's face flushed red but still she did not move. Kylie grinned and <br />
raised another hand as if to grasp a knob before Kim and started twisting it slowly. Kim started to breath <br />
harder and harder as Kylie twisted. Soon she was nearly panting but still made no move. She started to moan <br />
quietly, her eyes riveted to her friends moist lips. <br />
Then she broke. Kim let go of Beth's hands and grabbed her friends head, pulling the halo away tossing it <br />
aside and twisting her fingers through the blonds hair as she pulled her to her. She thrust her tongue between <br />
Bethany's slightly parted lips and kissed her more passionately than she had ever kissed anyone before. Beth <br />
did not struggle and threw herself into the kiss just as passionately, wrapping her tongue around Kim's own. <br />
When they finally parted they seemed sated, lipstick smeared across their mouths. <br />
&quot;Very good!&quot; Kylie complimented. &quot;I like where this is going! It's a good start. Why don't you two love birds <br />
take each others hands again.&quot; They did, both a bit embarrassed. &quot;Now Kim, why don't you tell Beth what you <br />
want to do to her?&quot; Kylie raised her hand once more and gave the air a violent twist, causing Kim to moan <br />
loudly, squeezing Beth's hands hard. &quot;Go ahead dear.&quot; <br />
&quot;I.. I want to suck on your breasts and rub my tongue on your big fat nipples!&quot; Kim said quickly, urgently. <br />
Kylie raised one perfect dark eyebrow.<br />
&quot;Well Beth? You know the drill.&quot; Beth trembled and closed her eyes. She knew what would happen next. Kylie <br />
raised her hand to Beth this time and started turning. As had happened with Kim she started to breath heavily. <br />
She resisted her rising feelings as best she could, trying to concentrate on other things. Kylie kept <br />
twisting. Beth's hands were clenched tight around Kim's when the first moan escaped her lipstick smeared <br />
mouth. It was only a couple seconds later that she finally released her grip, hands flying to her white bodice <br />
and tearing it open. She wasn't wearing a bra underneath. Two small cream colored breasts bounced free, <br />
nipples stiff and pointed in anticipation. Kim needed no further incentive and threw herself on her friend, <br />
mouth closing around one nipple and sucking vigorously. Her tongue slid between Beth's breasts and up the side <br />
of the other before her lapping and the second nipple like a dog. Her hands grasped Beth's breasts and <br />
squeezed them together as she rubbed her mouth and face over them. <br />
Beth stood rigid, hands knocking the witches hat to the ground and twisting and pulling at Kim's red hair. Her <br />
eyes locked shut, tongue licking her own lips as she breathed deeply. Again it lasted only a few moments <br />
before they were able to separate again, immediately taking each others hands. <br />
&quot;Nice. Very nice! Lets do one more round shall we? If you make me especially happy I'll leave it at that and <br />
let you be on your way.&quot; She turned to gaze at Beth. &quot;I believe it's your turn honey.&quot; She gave a sharp twist <br />
to the air and stood back, waiting. Beth looked at her friend, her breasts still hanging free of the ripped <br />
costume. She spoke, the need plain in her eyes and voice. <br />
&quot;I want you Kim, I want you so bad. In every way that I can think of.&quot; Instead of the embarrassment Kim had <br />
felt the first time Beth had spoken this time her words seemed to turn her on. She leaned forward and kissed <br />
Beth softly. Kylie reached up for a final time and gave rough twists to both of the girls libidos. The effect <br />
was instant, both girls clutched each other, pulling at the costumes and the others bodies. Kylie snapped her <br />
fingers and the costumes were gone. Instead of the two embarrassed girls dressed as a witch and an angel that <br />
had taken the stage there was now only two extraordinarily horny and naked lesbians. <br />
The girls hands and mouths flew over the others body as they rolled onto the floor, a mass of soft skin and <br />
hair tangled and eager. It was hard to tell where one of the girls ended ant the other began. They quickly <br />
found their way into a position they both wanted and began to lick eagerly at each others soaking wet pussies, <br />
their breasts pressing and rubbing against the other girls belly. Both girls were moaning loudly and writhing <br />
against each other faster and faster. Soon they both tensed and moaned louder than ever before, faces pressed <br />
hard into their friends crotch. Then they relaxed and stood. Without even looked at Kylie and holding each <br />
other around the waist they both left the stage nude. Kylie let them go, they had after all put on a good <br />
show. <br />
The audience, even though Kylie had calmed their minds, were agitated and a bit overwhelmed. No one ran or <br />
screamed however and that was all that really mattered. Kylie faced them again and spoke only two words. <br />
&quot;Who's next?&quot;</p>
