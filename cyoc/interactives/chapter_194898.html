<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vanessa was pulling into the gas station. Her body had changed and become more lithe since being exposed to something in her car. Having left her home town she had traveled  the country looking for what had done this to her. Having run out of money she was heading back home. To where her younger brother and sister, Melissa and Cole, lived.<br />
<br />
She pulled into a gas station as she was running low. One more tank and she would be back home. Having drained herself of saving in her quest for the one lover. There were a bunch of rednecks drinking in the middle of the day. Nessa was searching for something. Something sexual but she didn&#39;t know what. She had sucked and fucked her boyfriend dry but it wasn&#39;t what she was searching for. <br />
<br />
She got out of the car with her long black locks loose behind her tinted sunglasses. Nessa wore black strappy heels, a mini pleated black skirt and a black zip up crop top with long sleeves. A black handbag completed her clothes. <br />
<br />
A man named Carl came up to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;What &#39;ll be?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at his quarterback&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a gas station right? Fill. Her. Up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nessa opened the lack to her fuel tank. She leaned against the side of her car as she displayed her lean body. Carl could feel his hard on growing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are um...sure you don&#39;t need anything else?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...tell me where I can change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have a toilet out back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nessa shouldered her bag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Check the oil too if that&#39;s not too...hard...for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned on her heel, breasts bouncing as her long legs strode to the toilet. Carl was picking up what she was laying down. He had had a promising future as a quarterback but a injury led to the end of that. He was pumping gas in the hopes of making his way up the ladder to becoming manager. He remembered the pussy he had had with the cheerleaders. Carl wanted to get laid. <br />
<br />
Nessa was standing in front of the cracked and rusted mirror. She put her bag on the sink and opened up her bag. Unzipping her black top. <br />
<br />
Carl was putting the fuel nozzle into the hole. He looked at the older guys who were grinding their hips and making jokes about Fill. Her. Up. He set the nozzle to auto fill. Goaded into angry he decided to do something about it.<br />
<br />
Round perky breasts were heaving along her breathing motions; underneath, three rows of longer, more animal-looking nipples had appeared on her belly.  She had to apply small bandages to make herself look normal. Then she was applying foundation to make the dog like nipples almost invisible. That is something she had to avoid when getting laid. She had killed Mike because he had seen too much.<br />
<br />
Carl used his key to walk into the toilet. <br />
<br />
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be in here.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should file a complaint with management.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should teach you some manners.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you should.&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned her breasts leading the way as she smiled at looked at his smile.  <br />
<br />
For the men outside they heard the thump of the nozzle having Filled. Her. Up. The men were old and horny, they waited outside the toilet. <br />
<br />
Carl was shocked by the speed with which it was happening. No blow job, no making out. She literally tore his belt off and pulled his pants down around his ankles. They were like a couple fucking in the toilet at a bar. Or joining the mile high club. However she was feral and rabid, like a dog. She sat on his lap and rode his cock hard. She gripped his shirt as her breasts bounced and wobbled under her body movements. This mad woman didn&#39;t even wear panties. <br />
<br />
&quot;Huh.&quot; she grunted.<br />
<br />
His ass was being rammed into the toilet seat. He felt like he was being raped. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah-huh!&quot; she moaned.<br />
<br />
Carl had climaxed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooh&quot; she cooed, but she didn&#39;t stop.<br />
<br />
Nessa had an urge to fill, an itch to scratch and a need to fuck. She wasn&#39;t even looking at his face. Also she wanted as his semi-stiff cock rammed into her pubic bone was he the one? The one who had the right cock to get her pregnant. <br />
<br />
He had cummed and his cock was going soft. But this crazy chick with her wild black hair wasn&#39;t stopping. He was being fucked to death by this bitch. <br />
<br />
She was panting like a dog, he though as she continued grinding her hips against his. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please. Jesus. You are killing me.&quot;<br />
<br />
He strained to be heard over her dog like panting. One of her breasts smacked him in the face but he couldn&#39;t give a fuck. This woman was a black widow or something. <br />
<br />
The rednecks outside stood around. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds like he&#39;s fucking a dog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;woof woof woof&quot; Nessa was now saying as her tongue grew long like a dog&#39;s. <br />
<br />
A similar transformation had freaked out her boyfriend. <br />
<br />
Her head thrown back she had her orgasm. As she looked down at the gas worker her face had become dog like. Her nose a grown long and black patch. Dog ears poked out of her long hair and she had fucking whiskers!<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
Having gotten her fix she punched the man in the chest. She was deceptively strong. The sudden blow followed by the dog-woman gave him a heart attack. She got dressed and reached for her bag and glasses.<br />
<br />
The opened the door on the crowd that had formed.<br />
<br />
She walked out and the men were caught off guard. Nessa pulled her crop top down. Showing the outline of her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said don&#39;t worry about the bill. He doesn&#39;t have the heart to make a girl like me pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
She got into her car and drove off. Nessa had found a place to stay the night at the local college dorms. I guy had put up an ad asking for a boarder to pay the bills. Dennis heard a knock on his door and he opened it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dennis right?&quot;<br />
<br />
The skinny nerd was looking at the wide gap between the breasts of the woman in front of him. She opened the door and pushed her thinly covered nipples against his chest. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Amy.&quot;<br />
<br />
She thrust her bag into his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where can I have a shower?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
Nessa, or right now Amy, stepped out of the shower. Her breasts were sizable C cups. Apart from their size they were symmetrical since she had been exposed to thing in her car. Her body was without an ounce of fat as she now felt powerful and able to do what she did next. She walked perfectly naked down the hall from the shower to Dennis&#39; room. She was leaving open the promise of sex and broadcasting to any other males she was around. <br />
<br />
Dennis felt his cock stiffen as she watched Amy approach. Her breasts jiggled as she came closer to him. He could see the black triangle of her pubic hair. She had legs like that of a dancer, more like a stripper. Her hair now black and wet hung around her face. Dennis realized that tall dark and handsome applied to women as well as men. Amy walked into his room. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what exactly do you want from me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She had pulled on black jeans and a black shirt. Oddly as she pulled this on her back was to his face. He didn&#39;t get an answer as she pulled the shirt on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get me back to the city and you&#39;ll&quot; she turned exposing her breasts before pulling the shirt over them &quot;get your reward.&quot; <br />
<br />
She was going to demand from that bitch of a sister Melissa how she had gotten pregnant. She was tired of dry humping these limp dicked men. One of them had got her sister pregnant. What if it was her friend Erika?</p>
