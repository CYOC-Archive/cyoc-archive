..and then hit the Trigger again. Susan was once more surrounded by a now bright red glow. But this time she also saw the red shimmering aura surrounding her. Only one second had passed when she already felt her body changing, adapting and evolving. The weight on her back grew lighter and lighter as her muscles grew slightly in size but drastically in density. Soon her muscle got harder then stone and steel and showed now sing of stopping there. It felt terrific and arousal. She felt her abs compacting as she tensed all muscles in her body. Just several seconds had passed and she did not feel the weight on her back anymore. Invisible to Jeff, Susan shifted the weight to just one side and slightly lifted her left arm and right leg, supporting the weight only with one arm and leg, giving her a new but small challenge. She moved to the other side now holding her plank while her right arm and left leg where little of the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you feel anything?&quot; Jeff asked confused why she had not requested to stop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot;, lied Susan enjoying the feeling of growing stronger to much.<br />
<br />
Looking for a new challenge, Susan began to contract every muscle in her body. Thanks to her previous changes she was able to perfectly control each muscle group like no normal human would ever be able to. Her super dense muscles pushed again each other giving herself muscles a new exertion. The more she grew, the harder her muscles pushed again each other. The harder her muscles got, the faster she grew. She was cramping and contracting her muscles harder than any material on earth. Her genes adapted allowing to build up inhuman strength even faster. Her burning desire of becoming stronger also accelerated the process, arousing her to the edge of an orgasm. With closed eyes she lustfully monad.<br />
<br />
That was when Jeff recognized, that Susan must for sure feel something.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll stop this now&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo, please just a little bit more. It feels so goooood&quot;, begged Susan soon reaching her orgasm.<br />
<br />
She once more contracted every super changed muscle fiber in her body and then literally explode. As she reached her climax a shock wave send Jeff flying back out of the office chair and blowing everything what was not fixed to the corners of Susan&#39;s room. Her window shattered in the process. Jeff shook his head trying to figure out what just had happened. Luckily, he got not harmed but was obliviously confused. The Chronivac laid next to him and looked fine. The evolution had stopped. Susan was also also snapping back to reality feeling the effects of her afterglow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, Jeff! Are you okay?&quot; cried Susan as she jumped up from the ground and rushed through the room in a second ending up in a blur.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine. My head hurts a little but I&#39;m okay. What had just happen? Have we overdone it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know. I just was contracting my muscles and it felt so good. You now, the sexy way of good. And then I&#39;ve felt a big release and heard the crashing sound.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan! You came and your room looks like an hurricane went through it. I think we have definitively overdone it.&quot; said Jeff a bit in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it felt so good. Heck! It feels so good. I feel so strong. I feel my muscles pushing against each other. If feel so big and strong. Unstoppable.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carefully Susan put her hand under Jeff&#39;s armpits lifting him up like a child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. You feel weightless to me.&quot; said Susan and extending her arms to full length and lifting him up the ground. Her biceps did not even bulge from the weight as it felt nothing to her. Still her body looked toned. Even unflexed, her biceps was its previous size of a lemon. Her midriff was exposed even more now showing a well defined and steel hard six pack. She must have grown 3 or 4 inches in the process making her slightly taller then him.<br />
<br />
She toyed a bit with Jeff as she gently trowed him in the air and catching him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it, this is not fun!&quot; Jeff protested but caused only Susan to giggle.<br />
<br />
Susan lowered Jeff to pulling him closely to her face and started to kiss him passionately. Jeff immediately responded her kissing growing hard again. He now started to explore her body. He slid his hand along her strong arms feeling warm marble moving below her skin. She pulled him even closer moving one hand below his butt while her other hand locked his head on hers. He was sitting on the palm of her left hand as he felt his chest pressed again her boobs. They also must have grown in the process standing nice and firm without any sign of sagging. Her pectoral musculature pushed them out which let them appear even bigger. His rod once more dug deep into the gorges of her abs. Her waist and butt were slim, her tights the size of tree trunks and her calves sharp and defined. She let out a sing of arousal as she shifted her weight to the front, rising her heels and standing only on her tiptoes. Her calves responded in the sudden movement bugling up with thick feminine muscles. <br />
<br />
<br />
After several minutes of deep kissing, Susan put Jeff down. He was slightly happy, that she did not reach another orgasm as he was a bit afraid, that she might would rip him in half.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how strong did I make you?&quot;, asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t know, lets try.&quot; said Susan and looked for something to test her strength.<br />
<br />
Susan lifted one one of the steel plate. &quot;They were not heavy before. But now their weight simply feels non existing to me.&quot; Susan contracted her grip on the metal plate and dug her finger right into the material. &quot;This feels like pushing my finger into soft dough.&quot; Without a second notice she ripped the inch thick metal into half like a piece of paper. A piece of paper might give more resistance to a normal human than the metal plate to Susan... Susan squeezed and kneaded the steel until she formed a small super dense ball of steel. Jeff&#39;s jaw dropped by the demonstration of her inhuman strength. &quot;Okay no real challenge here. This makes me pretty strong I think.&quot; said Susan grinning in enjoyment and letting the steel ball fall down with a loud thud.<br />
<br />
Susan evolved more than 60 million years which is 10 times more than the evolution of humanity took. The only focus was on getting stronger and more resistant.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, I finally want to take my shower and dress up in something more comfortable. And after that we can explore the new body of mine a bit more.&quot; said Susan seductively and walked towards the door.</p>
