<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kelvin walked down the sidewalk, alone. It was kinda chilly. All that was on his mind was that October fix Chelsea. She had assured him it was okay. She trusted October, so he did too. But he was still worried, what if she didn’t return the same. He’d been introduced to magic and become fearful of it all in the same night. But it was a great experience.<br />
As he focused his mind on the weekend, he planned to visit October again if Chelsea wasn’t already back and safe. He had plans to watch a movie with Chelsea on the Saturday and the Sunday they would just chill at his house.<br />
<br />
As he was walking, he scratched his hand. He scratched it again and again. It became too often for it to be normal. He lifted his hand up and inspected it. His fingers were... longer....<br />
Kelvin stopped in his tracks. He looked at his hands. They were definitely longer, more slender. They looked feminine. Now he was getting freaked out. He looked closer, only using the dim light of a streetlamp not too far away. He quickly slipped off his coat, and looked at his hands. Both of them were different. Feminine, older, more mature hands. And it extended to his arms, they were getting longer and tighter. More like a woman’s. He then felt his legs shift too. His shoes felt tighter than usual. Getting too small for his feet. He had accepted the fact that he was growing, now he had to work out what was causing and how to stop it. He tried to think about what could be doing it. But as he thought, his legs were getting longer. He felt his waist get tighter and more restricted. He was getting taller. His legs were so tight on his jeans. His shirt was getting even more restrictive.<br />
He then remembered the only magic he had been around. The spell that October had created. He had stepped inside it. The magic must have affected him.<br />
As he zoned back to reality. He felt his jeans rip, tearing a small seam down the side. His feet had broken the trainers he was wearing. He had to get back to October. He hobbled his way back down the way he came. But as he was moving, his movement was made more difficult by two uncomfortable mounds on his chest. He had grown breasts. Not massive, but just a tiny bit larger than average ones, but they bounced as he tried to move as fast as possible.<br />
This was the moment Kelvin understood what Bra’s were for.<br />
Kelvin tried to get to October’s house. He saw it on the horizon. His body had grown taller. He used to be 5’8, but at the rate he was going now, he was past 6’0 and still growing. His shirt was revealing his midriff. He looked down and saw his belly button disappear into a newly toned stomach on his body. His butt was larger too, as were his hips, fair and larger than average, matching his new breasts. He stopped running suddenly, falling to his knees. He felt his chest burn, his arms and legs. He looked at them. Tattoo’s began to form, covering his arms and legs, his chest, from his neck and shoulders, down to where his new found cleavage was, in a triangle kind of shape. His back also covered, but he couldn’t see it. Different patterns, like leaves and fire and smoke and water, all depicted over a lot of his body. But while looking at the tattoo’s, and as the pain subsided, his skin began to change. From his chest upwards, a medium shade of green covered him. Not missing a single spot on his body, he was completely green. His face was completely different, just like his body. Much more feminine, much more mature and adult. It didn’t look anything like him, even his lips were darker. His face was covered in natural makeup. Longer, perfect eyelashes. He was the definition of femininity, of attractiveness. His hair was the last thing to change. The perfect thickness of each strand. It grew longer, down to his chest, split into sections, all different shades of green, each darker than his skin.<br />
The only thing that remained of him was his eyes, exactly the same as they had always been.<br />
<br />
Without speaking, Kelvin ran to October’s house. He was agile and faster, it was like he’d been using this body for years. He wasn’t so used to the bouncing on the chest but he dealt with it. He arrived to her house and burst through the door. He had a newfound strength, but that wasn’t what he was focussed on. He looked for the bookcase, it was still open from when he left. He ducked his head and slowly tried to get down the stairs.<br />
He reached the bottom, standing there, October, and Chelsea, still the old woman he had left her as, he spoke,<br />
“W-what...” he covered his mouth in shock. His voice, it was female, not only female, but more mature too, deeper, sultry. Sexy.<br />
He couldn’t bring himself to say another word. But he watched Chelsea move forwards, pushing October out of the way, he looked him in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“K-Kelvin?”</p>
