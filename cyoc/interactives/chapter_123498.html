<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There I don&#39;t think Chad ever looked cleaner,&quot; Bruno said with a grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but that acetone and bleach won&#39;t hurt him will they?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
Bruno rolled his eyes. &quot;We&#39;re going to elasticize him, and then turn him back into a Speedo and you&#39;re concerned about hurting him with a little acetone and bleach?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now hand me the orange vial and the pink vial from my valise,&quot; Bruno ordered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Valise?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
Bruno sighed, &quot;My briefcase.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rick answered rifling through Bruno&#39;s case, and pulling out two vials, &quot; These two.&quot;  He clanged them together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be careful, you idiot unless you want to be rubberized too!&quot; Bruno said pulling the vials away from Rick.  &quot;Now I will apply these to Jocktoy, and let him stew for a couple hours. Then we can re-Speedo-fy him.&quot; <br />
<br />
Bruno used a couple gradient tubes to measure out several milliliters of each chemical to a separate tube.  Then he combined the pink with the orange.  It got all frothy in the tube.  Bruno smiled. <br />
<br />
He tapped on the glass bottle in which Chad sat naked and slumped in. He was clean.  His skin was rubbed raw from the chemicals and hot water and scrubbing. He had tried to break through the glass, but it was too thick or his hands were too tiny.  He felt defeated.  He wasn&#39;t looking forward to being worn by Rick or Byron again, but maybe if this elasticization works, it won&#39;t be as awful.  Who was he kidding? It&#39;d be worse, they&#39;d purposely stretch him to see how far they could go, and if he fit more comfortably they&#39;d wear him more. Maybe he could bribe or reason with Bruno.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Bruno?&quot; Chad squeaked as he stood up. Better try now, &quot;Um, Bruno, I&#39;ve got a $5000 CD that I will give you, if you don&#39;t do this!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to be elasticized before I turn you into Rick&#39;s Speedo?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t wanna be a Speedo!&quot; Chad shouted. &quot;I&#39;ll pay you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruno smiled, &quot;Yeah, like a little guy like you can walk into a bank, and withdraw money for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, make me big!&quot; Chad shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then you&#39;ll pound me,&quot; Bruno said shaking his head.  He drew the liquid out of the gradient tube and into a big eyedropper.<br />
<br />
Rick looked nervously back and forth from jarred Chad to Bruno. He was broke and he didn&#39;t want Bruno reneging on their deal for Chad&#39;s cash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Rick, changing Chad back would be bad for business.  Even if the little squirt is outbidding you.  I didn&#39;t think he had that much cash, and I suspect he doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s just trying to get away.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruno shoved the eyedropper through the bottle&#39;s spout, and squeezed just as Chad opened his mouth.  The bubbly liquid was hot and sticky as it blasted Chad in the face and chest.  He stumbled backwards against the side of the bottle and it shifted on the table.  He landed on his butt, and the hot liquid stuck to his feet, legs, and worked its way into his butt crack. He struggled to get up but it was too sticky.  He now was on all fours with both his hands and knees coated in the goo.  Bruno squeezed the bulb on the eyedropper again and emptied the last of it on Chad&#39;s head, shoulders and back.  Then he picked up the bottle and started swirling it.  Chad felt like he was unbelted in a Tilt-a-Whirl at the State Fair.  He wanted to throw up, bu the stuff he got in his mouth had glued his mouth shut.  He couldn&#39;t even scream or shout now, as he tumbled helplessly in the bottle getting a thorough coating of the goo all over his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Rick, I&#39;m going to need the box from my trunk.  Here are my car keys, and be careful with it,&quot; Bruno ordered, as he continued to swirl Chad in the bottle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a good boy, Chad, not that I wouldn&#39;t mind taking your money, but I have an obligation to existing clients first.  Besides, I don&#39;t trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bruno&#39;s phone rang, it was Rick, &quot;Uh, Bruno, do you have a spare key?  I kinda locked yours in your trunk.  See I had the box, and Coach Sinclair wanted to know what I was doing at your car. I told him you asked me to put this box in your trunk.  So he waited while I did it, and I forgot that I put your key in the box when I first opened the trunk. Anyway, do you have a spare key?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Rick is making your argument for you,&quot; Bruno sighed to the bottle.  He set it down.  Then he answered Rick, &quot;I will be right out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was sore, but he was aware that his arms and legs seemed to stretched out.  The spinning in the liquid was making him stretch. He looked up at the spout.  Maybe if he was stretchy enough he could escape through that small opening?<br />
<br />
Bruno&#39;s phone rang again.  He had left it next to the bottle. It was in vibration mode, and it wobbled across the table until it hit Chad&#39;s bottle.  Then the phone buzzed again, and Chad&#39;s bottle shifted closer to the edge of the table.  Chad pushed against the glass wall by the edge of the table, but all he did was managed to press his rubberized back against the opposite wall of the bottle as his arms stretched.  He looked up at the spout opening, and jumped. The phone buzzed again, and bottle toppled off the table.  His glass prison fell with him in midair inside the bottle.  <br />
<br />
CRASH.<br />
<br />
It shattered, and suddenly Chad&#39;s feet hit the floor and then his head hit the ceiling, and his feet hit the floor.  He grabbed on to the edge of the table and looked around for a mirror.  He looked at his reflection in a chromed paper towel dispenser.  His skull was now flat like the Frankenstein monster, but at least he was full-size.  And he was naked, and in a science classroom.  He needed clothes, and he needed to do something about Bruno and Rick and Byron.<br />
<br />
He snuck over to classroom door, and opened it and peeked out in the hall.  He heard a noise behind him.  His leg had gotten wrapped around the leg of Bruno&#39;s stool, and it had stretched.  Now it was slowly and noisily drawing the stool toward him.</p>
