<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sun had almost completely disappeared beyond view as the group approached a small lake. The water lay still, without a ripple in sight. Benji was actually the first one to get there, whilst his fellow explorers trudged behind him, panting and sweating from the long day of walking. The boy was also carrying some of their supplies on his back, taking advantage of this strange change in energy and strength. Matt had joined his twin in his partial nudity, stripping his vest a few hours before. The only difference Alistair made to his outfit was undoing the top button of his shirt. “A well-dressed explorer is a well-prepared one.” He would say. Once Matt and Tom saw the lake they hurriedly dropped their huge backpacks and ran into the lake, eagerly kicking off their shorts. The cool water clashed with their boiling skin. Benji turned red, looking away from the two completely naked giants bathing a few feet in front of him. Alistair laughed, patting the boy on the back.<br />
<br />
“You’ll get used to that. Good job today. We’ll try not to be so slow tomorrow!”<br />
<br />
Later that evening, the group huddled closely around a small fire, digging into their tasty bowls of soup. Matt and Tom still sat naked, their oversized appendages on full display. They’d just finished their fourth bowl, and were already getting more from the pot by Reggie’s feet, his face still studying the map closely. Benji had never seen him without one eye on it. The boy admired their surroundings, taking in the view of the lake, and the crowd of trees that gathered around it. His daydream was cut short by Alistair’s loud slurping of his dinner.<br />
<br />
“Right, time for us to get some shut-eye. We’ve got a long day of walking tomorrow.”<br />
<br />
Alistair chucked his bowl in a large container and, wiping his moustache, retreated to his tent, as did Reggie. Once they were out of sight, Matt and Tom simultaneously got up from the ground, and moved towards Benji, sitting either side of him. They looked down at their smaller fellow explorer with a cheeky grin, man-spreading, as if inviting the boy to look. Matt gently placed his large hand on Benji’s shoulder, who froze as he spoke softly in his ears.<br />
<br />
“You look cute with a beard.”<br />
<br />
Benji look confused, but kept his eyesight straight ahead of him.<br />
<br />
“W-what do you mean? I don’t-“<br />
<br />
Benji cut himself off as he ran two fingers along his jaw. Stubble scratched his fingertips. It ran along his chin, and his cheeks. The boy was stunned. He was clean-shaven this morning. He’d always been. Tom let out a deep chuckle.<br />
<br />
“You should keep it. Let it grow.”<br />
“B-but I never-“<br />
“Why don’t you stay the night at our tent?”<br />
“Yeah, it’s nice and warm in there.”<br />
<br />
Benji inhaled as Matt gently squeezed his hand. The twins had moved even closer to the boy, close enough where he could feel their thick, muscular legs rub against his. Benji felt his cock twitch, still too shy to look at them directly. He tried not to stutter. The glow of the fire illuminated their ripped physiques.<br />
<br />
“N-no thanks. I’m fine on my own.”<br />
“Suit yourself.”<br />
“You know where we are if you change your mind.”<br />
<br />
Matt winked as the twins climbed into their small tent, the walls stretching out as their musclebound bodies squeezed into it. Benji turned to watch them go, catching a glimpse at their cocks, which were already rock-hard, jutting out of their waists like steel rods. As Benji climbed into his, he could hear the twins moan softly and whisper to each other. Their tent shook slightly, knocking into Benji’s. The boy could feel his member slowly come to life as he swiftly entered his tent and kicked off his boots. <br />
<br />
“Idiot. Why the hell did you say no?”<br />
<br />
He muttered bitterly to himself as he changed into his nightwear: a vest and loose shorts. He kept the necklace on; he remembered the last time he lost an artifact. However, as he lay down on his sleeping bag, he noticed something rather odd.<br />
<br />
“What the hell?”<br />
<br />
Benji looked down to see  the first patch of chest hair he has ever had. It was small, and thin, but it was there. He ran his hand along it, the hairs tickling his chest. That was when he noticed his arms. They had a layer of hair on them too, and he noticed his bicep looked more defined than usual. As he flexed it his cock gradually hardened, tenting his shorts..<br />
<br />
The twins’ moaning grew louder as Benji’s cock was now at full-mast. As he slid his shorts past his waist, he almost gasped aloud at what he saw. It was bigger, by at least three inches, with a considerable amount of pubes by its base. Benji never had body hair before, and yet it was as if he had grown all of it in a day. He stared at his elongated member as it throbbed. He reached into his sleeping bag and pulled out a small, stained sock. As he wrapped it around his hardon, he noticed it didn’t cover its entire length like it usually does. It had definitely grown, there was no doubt in Benji’s mind. Still, he persisted, and began jerking off at the sounds of the twins beside him. The boy’s breathing grew heavier along theirs, the speed of his hand quickening, until he shot an impressive load into the sock. His hand felt the fabric become damp with his seed, as he just lay there for a few seconds. He couldn’t believe it. Puberty must finally be kicking in, and it only took 18 years of waiting. He tossed the sock to one side, and tucked himself into his sleeping bag. The twins seemed to have also finished, the peaceful quiet of the jungle returning once again.<br />
<br />
Benji shut his eyes, and was fast asleep with almost in an instant.</p>
