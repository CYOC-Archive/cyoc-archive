<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The two cubs piled into the car looking subdued and glum; it was clear they did not want to go out but were being made to otherwise. The male wolf cub fury and his twin sister a doe fury both had half of their fur magically dyed pink; a punishment for their antics at school. They also had to spend their summer at the school helping the janitor staff as a form of punishment for their misbehavior. Their pleading looks at their mother garnered them no sympathy as she entered the front passenger seat and their father sat in the driver’s seat.<br />
<br />
“I’m going to give you one warning,” the anthro wolf fury turning to face her cubs as they looked at her with fear; “be on your best behavior. Everyone knows what you did. Your Grandparents, your aunt, uncle, everyone,” Brittany speaking; “do not try and claim that your punishment is unfair or cruel in anyway.”<br />
“Besides,” Jake turning over the engine and putting the car in gear; “it could be worse. If your great grandfather were still around, he would have you over his knee and a belt smacking your backside,” the anthro stag-deer claiming; “Jimmy and I spent many times getting spanked for stupid stuff. So be lucky you are not getting that.”<br />
<br />
The short drive to Edward and Julian Heartpaw’s house passed in silence after the stern warning that Jake and Brittany gave Dusk and Dawn. The two fraternal twins continued to look glum as they headed off to a BBQ Party. Prior to the trip, the two had to spend a few hours under their mother’s supervision polishing the trophies at the school they attend. While it was an elementary school, the awards were for a peewee bowling league that died out in the late eighties. Still it got Brittany wondering if the club could be revived.<br />
“Something to think about once my teaching certifications are finalized,” Brittany thinking to herself. Currently a substitute teacher, the anthro wolf fury was hoping to become a full time teacher before the start of the new school year. Hoping to teach at the high school level as well as become the new gym coach.<br />
<br />
“We are here,” Jake pulling next to the house; “did you remember the pies?”<br />
“Aww,” Brittany reacting; “they are on kitchen counter; “Can you go back for them?”<br />
“Yeah,” Jake nodding; “just make sure Dusk and Dawn don’t misbehave.”<br />
“Alright you two,” Brittany motioning to here cubs; “out of the car and you better not torment your cousin’s cat like last time.”<br />
A flash of fear swept across Dusk and Dawn just before they went back to being glum. Remember the day their Aunt Allison came down on them as they tried to terrorize Jimmy J.R by shaving his cat. The two found out how angry the anthro cougar could get when they were collected by their mother with their entire fur dyed pink. This was last year and the two endured endless torment until their winter coats grew in. They reluctantly trudged out of the car and made their way to the house. Watching as their mother side stepped the front door and walked towards the gate to the backyard. Following, they found the backyard to the heartpaw residence and the backyard of their aunt and uncle’s place as one large gathering place.<br />
“Muscle or magic to remove the fence,” Brittany speaking as she walked towards the anthro fox by the grill.<br />
<br />
“Ah welcome,” Edward turning around and seeing the grey furred anthro wolf fury approaching. Behind her was a male charcoal grey fur wolf cub and a female deer cub fury. Both had half their fur dye pink and Edward couldn’t help but laugh, further embarrassing the two as they looked for a place to hide.<br />
“Allison’s description of the two did not do justice,” Edward chuckling; as for your question, magic to remove the fence. It will go back tomorrow. Allison is inside with her mother and Adam. Where is Jake?”<br />
Heading back home to collect the pies we forgot,” Brittany answering; “one apple pie, one pecan pie and a peach cobbler pie.”<br />
 “Yummy,” Edward licking his lips at the thought of a slice of pie after some bbq chicken with corn and other sides. “There are some chips and soda that the gloom squad,” Edward looking at Dusk and Dawn; “can have to pass the time while we wait for the rest to show up.”<br />
“Not too much,” Brittany looking at the two making a mad dash to the picnic table; however they were already out of earshot and were filling up a bowl full of salty snacks and grabbing a few cans of carbonated sugar.<br />
“They are going to ruin their appetite,” Brittany sighing.<br />
“Let them,” Edward going back to the grill and moving meat to the upper rack to keep warm; “This is the fourth of July, let them have the day to be children.”<br />
<br />
As Dusk and Dawn grabbed their snacks they made a beeline towards the tree on their cousin’s side of the yard. Sitting down in the shade they munched on the chips as they watched their cousin step out of the house along with his mother and an energetic toddler who ran towards the fox fury at the grill.<br />
“Is it just me sis,” Dusk speaking low; “or would being back at schools mopping floors be more preferable to this.”<br />
“You must be touched in the head,” Dawn opening a can of pop and taking a swig; “that or the fumes from the polish made you woozy. Plenty of opportunities for mischief here.”<br />
“You risk the wrath of mom and Aunt Alison,” Dusk shaking his head; “then you are going it alone. I just want this day to be over with.”<br />
“You may be the older twin,” Dawn scoffs; “but you don’t have the guts for having fun.”<br />
“Your idea of fun,” Dusk responding; “tends to put us in trouble every time.”<br />
“That’s what makes it fun,” Dawn eyeing the cougar cub trying to get at some food at the grille; “and I think I may have found a target for fun.”<br />
“Isn’t that Aunt Alison’s brother,” Dusk sighing as he chomps on a chip; “you want to trick him?”<br />
“You don’t,” Dawn smiling gleefuly; “or are you afraid of getting caught?”<br />
<br />
Before either could answer, their cousin approaches them looking smug as he sees the wild pink dye job done to his cousin’s.<br />
“Enjoying your summer break,” the cougar fury sniggering; “spending time on the playground with friends?”<br />
“Bugger off,” Dawn snaps back; “or we’ll finish the job on your cat.”<br />
“Be careful with what you say, Mom is watching you two,” Jimmy J.R. responding before walking off; his tail swaying as he heads to the table to grab a pop before approaching the toddler who is his uncle and helping to distract him from the grill.<br />
“You know what,” Dawn staring daggers at her cousin as Jimmy leads the toddler away and lets him sip from the can of soda; the cub making a mess as a result but clearly having a fun time. “forget the kid, let’s get Jimmy instead;” Dawn watching as she eats her chips.</p>
