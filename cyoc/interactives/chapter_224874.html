<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brittany now a grey wolf furry, pulled away from her father’s hug. She felt his canine rod grow from it’s sheath. While bi-sexual, Brittany had no desire to experiment with an incestuous tryst with her father. So she looked at him and her mother, a lioness furry and mused; “guess I can expect a brother or sister sometime in a year.”<br />
“Not until we have a firm grip on the town,” Brittany’s father answering; “ but that doesn’t mean we won’t be having fun with a good rut now and then.&quot;<br />
Brittany looks at her mother and can see a slight smile creeping through her muzzle.<br />
<br />
“Are we just sticking around here then,” Alison stretching, her feline tail thrashing with wild abandoned; “the night is still young and I want a mate.”<br />
Then go and seek one out,” Edward Heartpaw, the fox furry nodding; “Just be sure to not let anyone see you.”<br />
“I didn’t when I came here to give Brittany this gift,&quot; Alison responding; her runes glowing as she cast a spell to appear normal to those that are not furry. Brittany also following suit.<br />
<br />
“But you did leave a trail of fluids that ended up infecting a random couple,” Alison’s mother responding; “your father and I had to clean it up as we came over.” Julia referring to the couple that started turning into a bear and bald eagle furry respectively. “So no Jilling off as you go about looking for a mate.&quot;<br />
The two female furries smiled through the muzzles as they left the Soulfang household. Alison had no idea who Brittany was thinking for as a mate, but she had a rough ideal as to where they were heading too.<br />
<br />
*******************<br />
<br />
Jake sighed as he shut down his laptop. Another day balancing the books on his father’s restaurant. While the business was brisk and very popular, Jake lamented that he couldn’t join his twin brother in the kitchen as a chef like their father. The young man, despite his best effort could not properly cook toast without setting off a smoke detector. Numbers were more his specialty, as such he was helping out with the books. A task his mother once did, before she passed away last year.<br />
<br />
“Jimmy and Jake Proudmoore,” Alison looking at Brittany questioningly; “I know they were quite the catch back in high school, but are you certain you want to change them?”<br />
“Absolutley,” Brittany growled in lust; “have you seen them lately? They have been working out in the local gym. When they are not working for their father. It is a shame about their mother. A drunk driver took her life while you were in collage.”<br />
“Well I want Jake then,” Allison eyeing an open window; “you can claim Jimmy as your own.”<br />
“Fair enough,” Brittany following Allison as the two horny furries sneaked into the second floor of the Proudmoore house.<br />
<br />
Both quickly cast spells to muffle the steps their feet paws would make as they quickly stalk their quarry. Allison found Jake as he was getting ready for bed, while Brittany discovered Jimmy in the nearby bathroom having a shower. Both pounced on their chosen males before either could react.<br />
<br />
Allison had Jake pinned to his bed, her strength far greater than his at the moment as she stared at the frightened man. Jake try to scream but found the mountain lion furry’s tongue invading his mouth. His saliva mixing with hers; his protests and struggles soon gave way to desire as the furry virus took hold and begun to change him. Allison smiled as she saw a thick pelt of brown fur beginning to cover Jake as he began to explore her body. She felt Jake’s penis begin to throb and twitch as she adjusted her position on top of the rapidly transforming Jake; allowing his shaft to penetrate her feline spade as she started to hump and gyrate while riding him.<br />
<br />
Jake panting as the urge to thrust and mate took hold, began to feel his face pull and contort. A muzzle was begining to form, ending in a black wet nose, while his ears began to migrate further up his head as they turned conical with white tufts of fur at the tips. A slight pain could be felt as a small tuft of fur grew just above his ass. White fur soon followed suit as it enveloped his abdomen. Legs becoming furry and twisting, his feet soon became numb as his ankles push up and his toes fused into black hoofs. Hoofs with a split in the middle.<br />
<br />
Allison moaned as she could feel her climax building; managing to steal a glance a the changing man before him; she notices a large rack of antlers growing on Jake’s head. He was becoming a handsome looking Stag-deer furry. She purrs as her orgasm surges forth; feeling Jake’s cervine member throb and unload in her hungry womb.<br />
<br />
“OH FUCK!”<br />
Allison smiles as she could hear Jimmy finally climaxing into Brittany in the nearby bathroom. Opening her eye she see Jake’s hands. They have thick black nails. The same type as his hooves as she calmly climbs off of him, feeling satiated for the moment.<br />
“I wonder if your father will become like you and your brother,” Allison turning on the bedroom light to get a better look at Jake. She sees the former human now a large stag-deer getting out of bed and standing on his newly formed hooves. His twin brother Jimmy soon enters the room followed by Brittany. Both soaked from the shower, but otherwise feeling refreshed and satisfied. Jimmy looked exactly like his brother in every aspect. A tall stag furry with amber eyes; Jake’s eyes remained blue.<br />
“Father is paying his respects,” Jake looking sad; “he is at the mausoleum where mom is resting. He won’t be back for another hour or two.&quot;<br />
“Plenty of time for us to get better acquainted with the Proudhoof boys then, “Brittany grinning through her wolf muzzle. She was eager for a second round and now eying Jake after having fun with Jimmy.</p>
