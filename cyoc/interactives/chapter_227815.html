<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next day Jeff awakens feeling extremely excited, having tried on the fursuit the day before he was amazed at how comfortable it had felt, so much so that he almost did not want to take it off. The costume fits his body perfectly, hugging his teenage body tight, the only issue is that Jeff has to be nude in order to wear the suit, but since no one would know, the teen didn’t care, and the suit is tight enough that it flattens his “boy-parts” enough to not show a bulge and not feel uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
When the time comes to get ready, Jeff quickly strips naked and puts on the suit, once he had put the head-mask over his head and zipped the zipper on the back closed, Jeff heads down stairs into the living room.<br />
<br />
“Mom,” he says, “I’m ready, could you please drive me over to Dean’s?”<br />
<br />
His mother looks up and her eyes widen, “Jeff,” she says, “where in the hell have you gotten that suit? It looks expensive!”<br />
<br />
Jeff grins under the mask, “oh, don’t worry, it only cost 100 Dollars,” he lies, “I saved up enough cash to buy this suit. Now, could you please drive me over?”<br />
<br />
“Sure, hop in the car,” his mother says and soon Jeff is knocking on the front door of his friend’s home.<br />
<br />
When Dean opens the door he gasps when he sees Jeff, “bloody hell, Jeff,” he says, “that suit looks amazing!”<br />
<br />
“Thanks Dean,” Jeff says, grinning under the mask, “your pirate costume looks amazing itself”.<br />
<br />
Dean smiles, “whoa, even the jaws of the costume move,” he exclaims when Jeff talks, “and thanks, please come in, you are the first to arrive,” he says. Jeff follows his friend into the living room and sits down on the couch, “HEY! NO DOGS ON THE FURNITURE,” Dean suddenly shouts.<br />
<br />
Jeff jumps and quickly gets off of the couch, a weird feeling of shame running through his body and the thought of being a “bad boy” pops into his mind, “s-sorry Dean,” he stammers.<br />
<br />
Dean chuckles, “I was just kidding, Jeff,” he says, “please, feel free to sit where ever you like”.<br />
<br />
Jeff lets out an awkward chuckle himself, feeling a little confused why he felt so bad when Dean “jokingly” told him to get off the couch, but Jeff simply shrugs it off, assuming that it has something to do with the settings he had made.<br />
<br />
Soon more and more guests arrive and Dean introduces Jeff to every single one, everyone is amazed by Jeff’s suit and all say that it looks like the real deal, which makes Jeff feel somewhat special.<br />
<br />
After an hour all guests have arrived, the house is totally crowded, some guests, like Jeff, are wearing animal costumes, not as realistic as Jeff’s but still high quality. A guy is wearing a Fox-suit, two girls are wearing cat-suits, one girl is wearing a bunny suit, another guy is wearing a Squirrel-suit and a third guy is wearing a dragon or lizard-like suit. The rest of the guests, like Dean, seem to have decided to stick to more human-like costumes, one guy is wearing a pirate costume, which looks identical to Dean’s, a girl is wearing a maid’s outfit, another guy is wearing a vampire costume, two guys have come as basketball players and one guy even appears to have decided to dress up as Batman.<br />
<br />
Soon the party is in full swing, everyone is having a great time, including Jeff, who loves all the attention he is getting, everyone, including the dudes, wanting to stroke and pet him. Jeff feels a little embarrassed each time a guy starts to pet and stroke him, but Jeff has to admit that it does feel good.<br />
<br />
The Majority of the guests, especially the males, are all enjoying the alcoholic drinks like punch, champagne and beer, others, like Jeff, who dislikes alcohol, continue to sip on their sodas and juices. Jeff has to use a straw, since drinking with the mask on is not an easy task, Jeff soon finds himself sitting on the couch next to the guy in the Squirrel suit to his left, to his right there is a guy in a Raccoon suit and opposite Jeff in an armchair is the guy in the Batman costume, all three seem to already have had a drink or two to many, the alcoholic stench causing Jeff to feel a little nausea.<br />
<br />
Jeff feels really uncomfortable being so close to these three drunks, that he’d rather just get up and leave, but he doesn’t want to come across as disturbed or rude, so he decides to just be polite and continue the conversation.<br />
<br />
“So,” the guy in the Squirrel-suit says, “where did you get that amazing suit?”<br />
<br />
“I… I found it online,” Jeff says, trying hard to sound not to tensed, “though… it’s been a while… s-so I don’t remember the name of the site I got it from”.<br />
<br />
“What a pity,” the Lizard or Dragon guy says, “I’d would have loved to get my hands on a more realistic Lizard or Dragon suit”.<br />
<br />
Jeff turns his head, “I think your suit looks amazing,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, but I’d like to have had a mask where the jaws would move with every word I speak,” he says, “like yours”.<br />
<br />
“It wasn’t really cheap,” Jeff says, “I had to save up a lot of cash to be able to purchase it”.<br />
<br />
“Well,” the Squirrel-guy says, “good quality has its price!”<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and turns to face the Squirrel-guy, “yeah, and I’m really happy with this suit,” he says, “its worth every penny. But your suit also looks like high quality!”<br />
<br />
The Squirrel-guy chuckles, “yeah… it wasn’t that cheap either,” he says, ‘that is if I didn’t have a Chronivac to create my dream costume. Luckily none of these guys know,’ he thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff looks over at the Batman-guy, “so, why have you decided to be Batman,” he asks.<br />
<br />
“Batman” shrugs, “I’m simply a huge comic book fan,” he says, “especially Marvel and DC, although I honestly think DC is far better than Marvel”.<br />
<br />
“Marvel isn’t… that bad,” Jeff says, “I like Spider-Man a lot… Deadpool is amazing too and soooo hilarious”.<br />
<br />
“Batman” shrugs, “everyone has his and her own favourites,” he says.<br />
<br />
Jeff nods and soon finds himself relaxing a bit as the conversation continues, he doesn’t notice the way “Batman” and the Squirrel-guy are looking at him.<br />
<br />
‘Hmm… I always wanted a pet,’ “Batman” thinks to himself, ‘he does seem like a good boy, but I doubt that he is trained. Hmm’.<br />
<br />
‘Jeff’s suit may look like the real thing,’ the Squirrel-guy thinks to himself, ‘but… it seems to be missing something. Ah, yes! He has no sheath! Luckily I brought my phone with the App-version of the Chronivac with me. I think I’d better fix that issue, Jeff has such a feminine body, I don’t want some drunk guy starting to flirt with him’.</p>
