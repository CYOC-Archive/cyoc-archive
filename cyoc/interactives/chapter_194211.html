<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the cheery disposition of the plant spirits, the path through the undergrowth felt more like a pleasant stroll through the woods than the long, tedious walk it would be otherwise. While still having to dodge occasional bram, as well as keep his cloak close to prevent it from snagging onto something, the whole thing was unusually peaceful. Really, if Kalil had learned anything during their little meander, it was that spirits could talk. And they liked to talk.<br />
<br />
A lot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kalil need help? Tell Tiku. Tiku always help friends.&quot; The forest spirit patted its belly as it led the way through the sea of trees, emitting a low rumbling as it craned its maw to look back at him. &quot;Especially when hungry. Tiku like food.&quot;<br />
<br />
The empty sounds of the forest had all but been drowned out by their constant banter. Tiku was gregarious, giddy and full of life. It chattered incessantly as it led him through the trees, as did the other four spirits accompanying them, who followed their leader with pride. Like Tiku, they had names as well.<br />
<br />
The spirit with the ever-excited gait and constantly twitching head was called Loka, appearing to be the youngest with its short tail and flowerless mane of leaves, some of which, alongside patches of scales, were a nascent yellow. The one with the meek posture and lithe body who never lifted its maw from the ground was Yuka. The largest with the bush-like mane and thickest tail was Fuka, who was quite muscular compared  to the slimmer and leaner bodies of its brethren, offset by its quiet demeanor. Finally, the spirit with the deceptively-deep voice and mane of dried leaves was Okon, who he assumed to be the oldest, owing to its worn hide and scars--and by how casually it talked with Tiku, referring to him directly by name whereas the other three called him &#39;leader.&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you hungry, leader get food.&quot; Loka chittered, tongue lolling out from the side of its jaw. &quot;Food good.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tiku have courage. Okon like courage.&quot; The dry-maned spirit explained to him, craning its maw to spare what could only be a glare to the meek spirit trailing behind them. &quot;Yuka always scared. Should be like Tiku. Friend agree?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kalil shook his head with a smile. &quot;You can be scared but still have courage… And besides, he&#39;s brave enough to tag along with us, isn&#39;t he?&quot;<br />
<br />
To his surprise, Okon nodded. &quot;Okon test friend, not disappointed with answer. Yuka scared, but has courage. Friend smart, unlike Tiku.&quot; It pointed a vine at the leading spirit, grinning deviously. &quot;Tiku head empty; idiot leader.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If Tiku idiot, then why Tiku leader?&quot; The plant patriarch replied, spinning on its haunches to glare at them with a scrunched maw--only to faceplant as a branch whacked the back of its head.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Because leader have courage.&quot; Fuka answered plainly, parting the branches overhead with its vines. &quot;Leader may be idiot and walk into branch, but leader have courage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leader foolish... but never scared.&quot; Yuka added, voice soft. &quot;Yuka looks to leader for courage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Loka agree!&quot; Loka exclaimed, scampering to the fallen Tiku to help it to its feet, grasping the sides of its leader&#39;s jaws and stretching them out into a smile, while it ruffled his mane with its vines. &quot;Loka not smart, so Loka look to leader! And leader brave! We proud to have such brave leader! Not like coward demons! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;F-Friends too kind…&quot; Tiku sniveled, patting the hyperactive spirit&#39;s head with a vine after prying his claws from his maw, turning back to resume leading them forward. &quot;Going to make Tiku cry...&quot;<br />
<br />
<em>...They can cry?</em> Kalil glanced away, scratching at his head as he tried to imagine how an eyeless face could shed tears--blinking the image away as a vine tapped his shoulder. <br />
<br />
&quot;This why Tiku leader.&quot; Okon rumbled to him proudly, before gesturing to itself with a claw. &quot;Okon too old to be leader. Better at fighting. Friend good at fighting too. Okon sees potential.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;H-Huh?&quot; Kalil blinked, gaze veering away as his face flushed red with uncertainty. &quot;You… really think so?&quot;<br />
<br />
It nodded in assurance, tapping a claw to the side of its head. &quot;Okon know so. Forest tribe have many warriors in past. Like to train with spirits. Sacred blood make them strong.&quot; It lowered its head. &quot;But sacred blood weak now. Forest tribe peaceful. Cannot protect themselves with weak magic. Lack courage. But friend has courage and strength.&quot; It gave his shoulder another light pat. &quot;Okon senses it. Forest guardian can wake sacred blood. Must have faith. Must not lose hope.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stifled a sigh, not entirely sure how to take the old spirit&#39;s words. Had their tribe&#39;s magic grown that weak over the ages? Kayda&#39;s strength told him otherwise, but then again  she had been the most magically affluent of everyone in their tribe…<br />
<br />
But if even she hadn&#39;t managed to ward the demons away… what could he hope to accomplish with one sword? He certaintly didn&#39;t know any magic.<br />
<br />
Tightening the collar of his cloak, the blue-haired youth found himself lifting an arm to shield his eyes from the harsh sunlight as they finally exited from the shaded canopy into an open clearing, squinting as he beheld the large structure which sat its center–the very same he and his tribe held in such high regard. The stone architecture was a far cry from the wooden huts in his village, though it bore a heavy resemblance to their sanctuary--owing to the civilizations which had long preceded them. The temple had long been reclaimed by nature, overgrown with  vines and creepers, a massive tree looming atop, roots grasping at the base, trunk thick and gnarled with branches spreading along the cracked, uneven stairway leading to the entrance. <br />
<br />
The serenity of the open grove and majesty of entering their place of worship could not have been any further from Kalil&#39;s mind. Gazing upon the sealed entrance, a foul, primal fear seeped into his body. The darkness infesting the temple was so overpowering, it was practically seeping out past the sealed doorway. Even the air felt wrong.<br />
<br />
Unwavering, Tiku stood hunched at the bottom of the stairs, the four spirits following after to join their leader, who turned to gesture the tribe scion forward.<br />
<br />
&quot;Friend hungry?&quot; Loka stirred as he drew toward them, quivering with exhilaration. &quot;Because Loka is! Loka make sure to eat every last demon! Loka make them squirm!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No Loka, demons not nutritious! Bad for stomach!&quot; Tiku huffed irritably, snapping its claws. &quot;But–we make them squirm. We show them anger of forest spirits and of forest tribe! <em>Then</em> we have victory feast!&quot; In unison with its cry, the five plant creatures huddled together and raised their maws to the sky, flaring their manes and shaking their tails in a series of jovial snarls. <br />
<br />
Dispersing moments later, Tiku stepped aside and gestured for the tribe youth to ascend the stairway. Without further ado, he did so–the foreboding feeling intensifying with each step upwards.<br />
<br />
He halted before the sealed entrance, sucking in a breath upon lifting his head to gaze at the giant tree overhead. The entrance was so large, even all six of them bunched together side-by-side would still leave room for entry. The trunk was thick and gnarled, its branches spreading wide to form a canopy overhead. Moss, lichen, and fungi grew along the bark, creating a soft, green glow. Yuka and Fuka came up from behind him, their own bodies halting at the sides of the large shut doorway, thick vines extending outwards to press against its center--before they pushed with strained growls. The ground rumbled as the pair heaved the sealed doors open--a foul scent of decay wafting from the rapidly widening gap. He gagged at the stench--tears welling up in his eyes from the sheer intensity of it.<br />
<br />
As they finished making a wide enough opening to grant entry, the duo silently retreated--a deep, damp stairwell gracing his sight. Tiku peered down the dark entrance upon reaching his side, maw closing in a frown, lifting the tip to spare him a glance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kalil scared?&quot;<br />
<br />
The youth swallowed before nodding, face cold with sweat. His heart pounded as he held his palm to his chest and took a slow, deep breath; letting it still upon exhaling.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worry.&quot; The spirit reassured with a toothy smile. &quot;...Tiku scared too. But Tiku has courage.&quot; It lifted its maw to him, gently taking his hand into its claws. &quot;Kalil has courage too. Evil presence no match for our power.&quot; <br />
<br />
He nodded once more, exhaling swiftly as he curled his fingers around the hilt of the sword at his hip. Clutching it tight and holding it close, with renewed vigor he carefully stepped through the slit of the doors before beginning his descent–the idle claw-taps of the plant creatures trailing after him.<br />
<br />
The twin doors slammed shut behind them with a hollow bang, the sound echoing through thick stone walls, before falling eerily silent.</p>
