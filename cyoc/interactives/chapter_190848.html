<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hunter was bored out of his mind. Sure, for most people working at a strip club sounded like a dream, but for him it wasn&#39;t so great. He was gay, so frankly all these women dancing and stripping did nothing for him. Still, he was a big guy, so it&#39;s not like his job being a bouncer was difficult, he would just rather be doing something else that night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, I&#39;d almost wish one of these creepy bastards would do something so I can at least be doing... anything.&quot; He thought as he stood firmly against the wall.<br />
<br />
Glancing on stage, he took note of who was performing that night. <br />
<br />
Rebeccah was performing, seemingly dressed as a convict tonight. From the few times they had talked she seemed like a nice kid. It always kinda bugged Hunter how young she was, but she was legal and it was her choice, so who was he to judge? Near her was Opulence, also strutting her stuff as an officer. The dark skinned woman pretended to intimidate Rebeccah, moving her towards the pole. Her dark hair was swung over her shoulders, then she pretended to use her baton to push against Rebeccah&#39;s breasts.<br />
<br />
Hunter was a little annoyed, as he had always wanted to be a an officer of the law one day. So Opulence&#39;s performance was a little poor in taste, at least from his point of view. Then there was Estefania who was pulling off the famous bunny-girl look. Hunter was most familiar with her. They had talked often, and from what Hunter knew she dreamed of being a chef one day, so seeing her up there upset him. Still at least she enjoyed the attention.<br />
<br />
Then there was Paula. As Hunter looked at her, he noticed that she seemed to be staring at the could, looking somewhat confused. He followed her gaze to see one of the cleaners holding an obvious polaroid camera. It made it even more obvious with her red uniform. Hunter didn&#39;t really know the meek girl well, but he thought her name was Dana, right? Maybe Della? Either way, it did not matter, as camera&#39;s were not allowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey you! Stop no flash photography!&quot; Hunter called out. <br />
<br />
The woman seemed to ignore her as she pressed one of the buttons. Hunter got quickly annoyed. He was the guy in charge of protecting these ladies, and now one of the cleaners wasn&#39;t even listening to him! With swift, long steps he approached the small girl. Just as he was about to reach her, she readied the camera again.<br />
<br />
She pushed the camera&#39;s primary button again. Just as she was about to Paula yelled a loud &quot;No!&quot; from the stage. The camera was aimed across the stage, and the cleaner&#39;s thumb seemed to slightly cover the lens. However, Hunter had only just gotten into the camera&#39;s frame, attempting to grab the camera, when it went off with a bright FLASH.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Hunter blinked a few times, taken aback by the immense light which nearly blinded him. He stumbled slightly, then attempted to lean against the stage. However, instead of leaning he ended up landing on his butt. <br />
&quot;Ow!&quot; He cried out in a high pitched voice.<br />
<br />
As his eyesight returned, he noticed curly brown hair cover his eyes. He brushed them to the side, finding that his clothes were now replaced by a cinderella dress, looking like it came from a costume shop. She felt odd, and little, seeing her body was small. Her head also hurt, fogging up slightly. Her? Was she a her... she was a 36.... whats thirty mean again? She couldn&#39;t remember for a second... she was only 6!<br />
<br />
She held out her hands, holding up all the fingers on one hand and just her pointer finger on the other.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m this many!&quot; She giggled, wondering why she was so confused. &quot;I&#39;m a girl... ha, of course I am!&quot; Heather giggled.<br />
<br />
Heather stood back up, looking around her. She saw that she was in her room. The walls were dark purple, with light pink curtains over the bright windows. She had her big princess bed with a covering draped over it. Her cabinet was filled with all her dresses and pants, and near that was her toy box.<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s what I was doing.&quot; She thought, happily skipping in front of the box to a few things that she had taken out.<br />
<br />
In front of the box was her big doll house. It was a big toy, about half her height, and was painted prettily with a brown roof and bright red walls. She couldn&#39;t read, but her daddy had told her that it was called &quot;Dalia&#39;s Estate&quot; and it was named after some pretty lady who had made it in her extended family. It was very fun to play with, and even could be opened to reveal the inside rules.<br />
<br />
She swung the doll house open, smiling to see her toys were right where she left them. Inside were plastic dolly family. She loved to play pretend family with them. The four toys were laid about where she had left off.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom was the doll she called Becca. She was skinny and plastic with bright red, curly fiber hair which stretched past her shoulders. She had makeup, and a permanent soft smile. The doll was currently naked, though it had no inappropriate features as it was smooth. The doll sat in the bath tub, staring up at the ceiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I better get changed, I have dinner to make!&quot; Heather giggled in a fake, slightly higher pitched voice. She picked up the toy, and pretended to walk it over to the side of the bathroom. She then opened a little fake closet, pulling out a bright red dress. She pulled it over the toy, then &quot;walked&quot; it down the stairs.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m done honey!&quot; Heather called out for Becca the doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey baby.&quot; Heather replied in a deep voice for another doll she picked up with her left hand.<br />
<br />
This doll was the daddy of the house, she called him Eric. He had a little bit of black hair and darker skin then Heather did. She liked it cause he reminded her of her friend from school, Tanya. She learned it in school, it was Africa &#39;Amerigan&#39; as she pronounced it. He wore a white shirt and tiny felt jeans.<br />
&quot;How was your bath?&quot; Heather asked for her Eric doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was fun! I got clean and played with bubbles!&quot; Heather replied, still not fully understanding how adults acted. &quot;Where is Peggy?&quot; Heather asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m here Mommy.&quot; Heather said in yet another voice, though one more similar to the voice for Becca.<br />
<br />
She then pulled out another doll from a separate room in the house. It was a different brand of doll, so it was shorter with a wider head and cuter features. Because of that, Heather liked to pretend that she was the baby. She called her Peggy because she had cute, blonde &#39;Peg&#39; tails as Heather mispronounced them. She tapped the doll up and down to mimic walking, then placed the doll on the floor with the legs splayed out.<br />
<br />
The doll wore only diaper which heather stole from a different toy so they could play house. <br />
&quot;Mommy I want my baba.&quot; Heather said, moving Peggy&#39;s head towards Becca.<br />
<br />
&quot;No honey it&#39;s nappy time! Eric you go get the bottle, I&#39;ll take baby to bed!&quot; Heather responded, pretending to have a stern tone.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Paul was terrified. How could everything had gone so wrong? He was frozen stiff, unable to move a muscle. From what he could see, he was in a house, though it looked very fake, made of plastic and felt. Leaning against a wall was a redheaded woman made of plastic, staring blankly off into the distance. Paul recognized that this was Rick, though who knew if he was aware or not.<br />
<br />
Nearby was a black man, standing on its own in the middle of the room. The face was very different, but Paul could tell from the minor similarities that this male doll was his own daughter, Emily. <br />
<br />
And here he sat, made of plastic and sitting in a diaper, unable to do anything. The camera had altered reality again, transforming him so that he was nothing more than a child&#39;s baby doll. He wanted to, ironically, cry out, scream to the world that he wasn&#39;t a toy but he was a man. Yet he could not move an inch.<br />
<br />
The giant hand appeared again, and Paul was unable to stop it as Rick&#39;s transformed form was lifted away and out of the plastic room.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, Becca, you&#39;re gonna put baby to bed soon. If it&#39;s nighttime, then you have to be dressed right! Just like my Mommy changes me for bed.&quot; Heather smiled, talking to her doll.<br />
<br />
She then removed the dress she had just put on, sliding on a pink shirt and pink shorts to mimic pajama pants. She placed the doll back near Peggy, but then stopped. She felt like she was missing something. A memory of a dark room and naked ladies quickly entered her mind, and for some reason she liked the thought of the ladies, but shook it aside.<br />
&quot;Eww, where did that come from?&quot; She thought. &quot;Boys and yucky and... so are girls.&quot; Heather blushed aloud, quietly to herself.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when her eyes drifted to a small stuffed terrier, then she lit up with joy. She reached over, pushing some bulky camera thing out of the way to grab her toy. She placed the dog toy and Becca doll back in the house, then placed a tiny plastic bottle in Eric&#39;s hand.<br />
&quot;I got the bottle.&quot; She said for Eric.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I found Ojo! He was pooping in the yard.&quot; Heather replied doing her Becca voice, trying not to laugh after saying poop.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bark! Woof!&quot; She giggled, moving Ojo around as she said it.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Paul stared in dismay. He had hoped that maybe his wife, Olivia, had escaped this plastic fate, but apparently not. She was now nothing more that a stuffed dog toy, forced to pretend bark through the mind of a seemingly giant little girl. However, when she had placed the toys back in the doll house, she had moved it slightly. This had let him see the camera was sitting nearby!<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! It&#39;s still here! We can still change back!&quot; He thought hopefully. &quot;Little girl, please hear me! Please you have to take a picture of us please!&quot; He called out mentally, hoping somehow she&#39;d hear her. Luckily, the magic of the camera was working at the same time. It always desired to be used, so the longer it sat there, the more it would magically entice someone to use it.<br />
--------<br />
Suddenly, Heather felt an odd feeling again as she played. Another minor memory came up, but of kissing a man. She sneered, wondering where these thoughts had come from. Just as she thought this, she heard a tiny *plink* noice from behind her, the camera&#39;s interior seemingly whirring slightly.<br />
<br />
She crawled over on her knees, then picked up the device. She looked it over, thinking it was some kind of old camera.<br />
&quot;Huh, I don&#39;t remember Mommy or Daddy buying this for me. I also don&#39;t think Santa brought it.&quot; She thought aloud. &quot;I should give it back to them.&quot; She shrugged, standing up to walk away.<br />
<br />
However, just before she did she had a worrying thought. What if it was broken? Would she get in trouble? She had better check it out just to be sure.<br />
&quot;Okay, just one picture.&quot; She mumbled aloud.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when she...</p>
