<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer couldn&#39;t take it anymore. The sounds and the smells were too overwhelming. Without another thought or care, she ran over and shoved the still-transforming and now completely naked Peter back a step, and then with one hand pressed herself up against him, inserting his wet girth inside her. Once again the wolf inside of her felt thrilled, even if she was starting to get hungry. As Peter&#39;s legs reshaped and thickened, she grabbed a hold of his shoulders and started thrusting. It was glorious. Peter didn&#39;t fight her. In fact, some part of his ever more bestial face appeared relieved.<br />
<br />
In the middle of the activity, she smelled Robert lean in over her shoulder. &quot;If this is what you wish, I understand. Take care.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back, she could see Robert&#39;s body change a little. Everything on her body changed, shifting to remove signs of being one gender or the other. But either way, Robert looked fit, strong, and highly desirable. With a smile, Robert turned and loped down the alleyway, away from the street. In moments, he... or it was gone.<br />
<br />
Jennifer turned her attention back towards Peter, who at this point looked more than masculine. The wolven features dominated his face, and his nose continued to protrude outward. He was even larger than Robert was now. He smelled a little older too. It also occurred to her that he wasn&#39;t thrusting so hard as to hurt her in any way. It was more physical than she ever consider normal, but there was more care and pacing to it... as if he were adding some passion to the act. Each stroke was hard in its delivery, but it was also wasn&#39;t too fast. There was time given to each delivery, letting her feel each thrust. Then she realized it. He wasn&#39;t just fucking her. He was making love to her. He was... perfect.<br />
<br />
She came, and he continued. He held her carefully as his transformation completed. He smelled glorious. He was her silver alpha. He went off his first time just as she came again. A part of her wished she would just change the rest of the way again, just so she could completely give in.<br />
<br />
But she didn&#39;t. The curse made it unpredictable.<br />
<br />
Dammit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; came a series of growls from Peter. She could understand his words easily.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Do you have your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
The creature paused. &quot;I have a mind. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same as before. I wish to hunt, feed, and mate. I want to grow our numbers as a pack.&quot; He shook his head, his expression darkening a little. &quot;No. I am not the Peter you knew. I am the animal, the beast all fear.&quot; Jennifer shivered in fear at this, but the creature looked to her and brushed the back of one of his hands softly against her cheek. &quot;But not you. You don&#39;t need to fear me. Whether you stay with me or not, you are pack to me.&quot; A part of Jennifer thought she could just melt into that gaze, though she was fairly certain the her of just earlier yesterday would had fled screaming. &quot;Transform or dare,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
She sighed. &quot;Not yet. You need two or three more people for it to be passed across before it will work on me again. That or we need to find another curse-line.&quot; Shit, she thought. She still didn&#39;t know if the curse Kevin had was the same as hers or not. Wait, she thought. He said Kevin gave it to Marcus. With a massive amount of regret, she slowly lowered herself off of Peter. &quot;I need to find Marcus Culvin. Either he had another one, or he passed it on to someone else. Hopefully he didn&#39;t give it to Kyle Perkins.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle?&quot; asked Peter, his body suddenly retracting and turning more human. &quot;What does he have to do with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t bit,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Sorry, but it was the T&D curse. He cursed me with this werewolf thing yesterday morning. The incident at the school was his damn fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
The naked man Peter became nodded. &quot;That would explain why he disappeared. I saw him fleeing from the school yesterday, but nobody has heard from him since. Probably ran for the hills.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer stopped and looked at the new Peter. He was well over six feet tall, built with lean muscle everywhere, and had abs she could sleep on for years. He still had silver hair though, but it looked natural with an extremely gorgeous twenty-something year old face. As she looked him over, she could see some qualities about him appeared younger. However his penis was definitely not one of them. That was... matured. It was also the size of something she thought only possible in the land of Japanese cartoons and photoshop. Inside her mind, she heard Madeline Kahn say &quot;Woof.&quot; The wolf inside of her nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are... are you Peter now?&quot; she asked, looking him over.<br />
<br />
The man blinked, and then looked down at himself. He paused. &quot;I remember more of Peter now, but I don&#39;t think so. I... I honestly can&#39;t tell. I think like this we are becoming one.&quot; He thought on it some more. &quot;I think he likes this more than what he was.&quot; He grinned with a devilishly handsome twist on his lips. &quot;He likes you.&quot; He somehow moved even closer to her. &quot;I... like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her face reddened. Somehow, she thought that even the wolf in her mind blushed, not that she could really tell where she stopped and it began. Damn, she wanted his pups.<br />
<br />
Stop that! she shouted at her mind. That was the wolf. That was completely and totally and ONLY the wolf, she protested too much to herself.<br />
<br />
Then, her stomach grumbled loudly.<br />
<br />
Peter stepped closer to her. &quot;I think you need some food. What would you like to eat?&quot; His voice and smell was so alluring to her, but the human part of her mind caught the tone that started sending off massive warning bells. He was leaving the choice to hunt down people as opposed to animals... or maybe... stopping at the mart or a cafe... completely open to her.</p>
