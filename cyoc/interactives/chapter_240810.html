<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark hesitated for a moment, his mind racing with the implications of what Evan was offering. The idea of his newly transformed brother becoming even more dominant, more superior, was both thrilling and terrifying. But the memory of Evan&#39;s words, the way they had made him feel so small and yet so exhilarated, was too much to resist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes,&quot; Mark stammered, his voice barely above a whisper. &quot;Do it. Make yourself... perfect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan&#39;s eyes gleamed with a mixture of excitement and determination. He gently set Mark down on the bed, ensuring his brother was comfortable before turning to the Chronivac. His massive hands moved with surprising dexterity as he input the necessary changes, his mind already racing with the possibilities. Before Mark could even see the inputs, Evan stopped typing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, bro,&quot; Evan said, his voice already taking on a deeper, more commanding tone. &quot;Let&#39;s see what we can do.&quot;<br />
<br />
He pressed the enter button, and the room seemed to hum with energy. Evan&#39;s body began to change once more, his muscles swelling even further, his frame expanding to an almost inhuman size. His already impressive cock grew thicker and longer, reaching a staggering a foot in length, while his balls swelled to the size of apples, heavy and full of potent seed. He now had to be at least 7 feet tall and over 350 pounds of pure muscle. Even with his massive size, his face still showed youthful beauty, a clean cut shaven stud who couldn&#39;t stop reveling at his new stature. <br />
<br />
But the changes weren&#39;t just physical. Evan&#39;s mind was being altered as well, his personality shifting to become even more dominant, more assertive. His intelligence, already heightened, was now razor-sharp, his thoughts clear and focused. He turned to Mark, his eyes blazing with a newfound intensity.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel, bro?&quot; Mark asked, his voice trembling with a mix of awe and fear. He could barely squeak out the question as he stared dumbfounded at the specimen standing before him.<br />
<br />
Evan smirked, his expression one of pure confidence. &quot;I feel... incredible. Powerful. Unstoppable.&quot; He flexed his arms, the muscles rippling with raw strength. &quot;But more than that, I feel... right. Like this is who I was always meant to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
He stepped closer to Mark, his massive frame towering over his brother. &quot;And you, little bro... you&#39;re going to love this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s breath hitched as Evan reached down, his massive hands easily lifting Mark off the bed. He held his brother in the air, his strength making it seem as though Mark weighed nothing at all. &quot;You see, Mark, I know what you want. You want to feel small, insignificant. You want to be reminded of just how much better I am than you. And I&#39;m going to give you that. Every. Single. Day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evan&#39;s voice was like a thunderous growl, each word sending shivers down Mark&#39;s spine. He set Mark down on the bed, his hands moving to his brother&#39;s pants once more. With a single, effortless motion, he tore them away, leaving Mark exposed and vulnerable. How strong was Evan now?<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at you,&quot; Evan sneered, his eyes raking over Mark&#39;s body. &quot;So weak, so pathetic. You don&#39;t even compare to me. And you never will.&quot;<br />
<br />
He reached down, his massive hand engulfing Mark&#39;s cock, which was already hard and throbbing. &quot;This little thing... it&#39;s nothing compared to mine. You know that, don&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark nodded, his breath coming in short, ragged gasps. &quot;Y-yes, Evan. I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Evan growled, his grip tightening just enough to make Mark whimper. &quot;Because I want you to remember that. Every time you look at me, every time you think about me, I want you to remember just how much better I am than you.&quot; He leaned down, his lips brushing against Mark&#39;s ear as he whispered, &quot;And if you ever forget... I&#39;ll be more than happy to remind you.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Evan released his grip, leaving Mark trembling on the bed. He stood to his full height, his massive frame casting a shadow over his brother. &quot;Now, let&#39;s see just how much you can take.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s eyes widened as Evan positioned himself over him, his enormous cock hovering just above Mark&#39;s body. &quot;E-Evan, wait—&quot;<br />
<br />
But it was too late. Evan&#39;s massive cock descended, pressing down on Mark&#39;s chest with a weight that was almost unbearable. Mark gasped, his body arching as he felt the sheer size and power of his brother&#39;s member. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it, bro,&quot; Evan growled, his voice filled with dark amusement. &quot;Feel it. Feel just how much bigger I am than you. How much stronger. How much better.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark&#39;s mind was a whirlwind of sensations, his body trembling as Evan&#39;s cock pressed down on him, the weight and heat of it overwhelming. He could feel every inch, every vein, every pulse of his brother&#39;s massive member, and it was both terrifying and exhilarating. Pain slowly mixed with pleasure as the larger than life cock pounded every inch of his boy hole, stretching his lower abdomen past normal human limits.<br />
<br />
Evan chuckled, the sound deep and resonant. &quot;You love this, don&#39;t you? Being dominated by your superior brother. Knowing that you&#39;ll never measure up.&quot; Mark could only nod, his voice caught in his throat as Evan continued to press down on him, the weight of his cock pushing Mark further and further into the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, little bro,&quot; Evan said, his voice a low, sultry growl. &quot;You&#39;re mine. And I&#39;m going to make sure you never forget it.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Evan began to move, his massive cock release seed over Mark&#39;s inside, the sheer size and force of it all sending shockwaves through his brother&#39;s smaller frame. Mark gasped, his body trembling as he was overwhelmed by the sensations and racking in its own orgasm, his mind filled with nothing but the sheer dominance of his brother. He barely felt his own cock releasing his useless jizz over the bedsheets.<br />
<br />
Evan smirked down at him, his eyes filled with dark amusement. &quot;That&#39;s it, bro. Just let go. Let me show you just how much better I am than you.&quot; He didn&#39;t even look that moved by the mindblowing sex they just had, almost like he expected he could dominate and fuck anything he wanted. And as Evan continued to dominate him, Mark could do nothing but surrender, his mind and body completely overwhelmed by the sheer power and superiority of his brother. He couldn&#39;t believe that he had been ass fucked by what had once been his little sister. What more could Evan do with his improved brain and the full power of the Chronivac in his grasp?</p>
