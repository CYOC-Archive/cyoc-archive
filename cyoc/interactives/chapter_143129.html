<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A knock at Todd’s door quickly drew him away from Elaine. Opening Todd was pleasantly surprised to see Beth and Liz standing there. “Hey girls,” he said. “Glad you could come and thanks for bringing some clothes.”<br />
<br />
“No problem,” Liz said. “But what exactly do you need Beth’s clothes for?”<br />
<br />
Todd gestured towards the young girl now sitting on his couch. Beth and Liz curiously stared at her before turning towards Todd. “Um why is their a kid in your dorm Todd,” Beth asked.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Todd started. “Here’s the thing. That’s not an ordinary girl, well at least that’s what she says. She says she’s Professor Sterling, somehow she thinks she got turned into a kid.” Beth and Liz furrowed their brows before looking at the sad girl in oversized clothes. “That makes no sense,” Liz exclaimed. “How did Professor Sterling get turned into a kid. I mean that should be impossible right?”<br />
<br />
Todd tried now to stifle a maniacal smile that was building inside him. Yes, things like that should be impossible, except thanks to him they weren’t now. Liz (the former librarian) and Beth (the former sorority girl) were living proof of that. “I know,” he said, trying his best to keep a straight face. “But she seems to believe she really is Professor Sterling. She’s even wearing clothes like the Professor. That’s why I need your help and a change of clothes for her. Hopefully we can calm her down and realize that she really is just a kid.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose,” Beth said quietly. “Let us try talking to her first though, she looks really upset.” Todd nodded as the two college girls now slowly approached Elaine. He was truely interested to see how his previous test subjects would react to his latest experiment. <br />
<br />
Beth’s and Liz slowly approached the young girl who stared at them intently. “Like Who are you two,” Elaine asked, wincing as she realized she sounded like a spoiled child. “Ugh Sorry,” she sighed. “I’m like totally not myself right now. It sucks Im like usually more mature. I’m Elaine, Professor Elaine Sterling.”<br />
<br />
“I’m Liz,” she said. “This is my roommate Beth.” Beth waved shyly as the young preteen now stood up. As she did she saw she was shorter than both girls. Beth, a very petite goth girl, stood perhaps an inch or two taller than her. “Geez I’m short,” Beth groaned. “I can’t believe this kid is almost as tall as me.”<br />
<br />
“I’m not a kid,” Elaine protested stamping her foot. “I’m a tenured Professor at this university. I’m like super old too, like close to 50.”<br />
<br />
“And how old are you now,” Beth asked, narrowing her eyes. “Cause right now I wouldn’t put you a day over 12.”<br />
<br />
Elaine paused, blushing a furious crimson as she lowered her eyes. “Sorry,” she said meekly. “I’m, Ugh I’m like having a lot of issues right now. First I look like a little girl than all the sudden Instart acting like one. It sucks a lot cause I’m like really smart. I mean I have my doctorate and everything.”<br />
<br />
Todd watched as Elaine now tried to explain herself, unfortunately for her her rambling sounded more like a girl trying to impress a bunch of teens. Elaine’s maturity had been lowered to such an extent that she was now like any other kid. She would say anything to try and impress older girls in hopes they would like her. While Beth simply gave the girl an odd look Liz felt bad for the girl, immediately seeing through her feeble attempts at impressing them.<br />
<br />
“Wow Elaine,” Liz said warmly. “That’s, um, really impressive.” Elaine smiled brightly as she now gazed at the two teens. A part of her realized she was acting quite foolishly but for some reason she wanted to impress these two more than anything. “Thanks,” she said quickly. “I mean I don’t mean to brag but um kind of want you to understand that I’m older than I look.”<br />
<br />
Liz and Beth looked at each other, exchanging a knowing nod as they turned towards the girl once more. “Of course,” Beth said. “But I couldn’t help but notice your clothes seem a little....big.”<br />
<br />
Elaine blushed once more as she beheld her outfit. “Ugh I look like a dork,” she thought. “They Probably think I’m like a total geek or something.” She paused as the thought ran through her head, why would she care about the opinions of a couple of college freshmen, she needed to focus. Of course her clothing was baggy, she had been shrunk down to a 12 year old. The jacket she wore half covered her hand, while her skirt slipped on her boyish hips. Even her nylons were loose and baggy on her thin legs. “Yeah,” she said meekly. “When I um, changed my clothes didn’t change with me.”<br />
<br />
“Todd said something about that,” Liz said as she motioned towards Beth. “That’s why we brought you something to wear. Why don’t you go get changed.”<br />
<br />
Elaine let out an excited squeak as the girls handed her a change of clothes. She realized her reaction was a bit much but a part of her couldn’t help but be excited she would get to wear clothes that colleg girls got to wear. Quickly composing herself she thanked the girls before rushing into the bathroom and locking the door.<br />
<br />
“Well,” Todd asked. “What do you two think?”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know where she came up with this story but there’s no way she’s an adult,” Liz said quietly. “I mean you saw how she reacted, she was fangirling all over me and Beth. It’s like she wanted to impress us or something.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah she sounds like one of my cousins,” Beth added. “She’s about the same age as her and acts like that whenever I’m around, always trying to seem cool in front of the older kids. Still, kind of nice to have someone think so much of you that they would say anything to impress you.”<br />
<br />
Todd listened intently as Beth and Liz now talked about their interaction with Elaine. The device seemed to be working perfectly if they both believed that Elaine was nothing more than a child trying to play dress up. As he ordered his next move they heard the sound of the bathroom door opening. “How do I look,” Elaine said apprehensively.<br />
<br />
Todd smiled as he gazed at the young preteen. Elaine was dressed in an old T-shirt with a pair of Beth’s blue jeans. Being slightly shorter meant the cuffs bunched around the young girls bare feet. Obviously the trip over to Todd’s room had hurt her more than she let on as Todd now observed several bandaids on the side of the girls feet as well as her heels. Elaine also appeared to have borrowed one of the girls sports bras to support her smaller breasts. While both Beth and Liz were much larger than the girl, the sports bra helped support her, even if she appeared to fidget with it ever so slightly. Finally Elaine had decided to tie her long chocolate brown hair back in a ponytail, alook that made Todd realize she now truely looked like a little girl.<br />
<br />
“Looking good,” Liz said encouragingly. “Definitely,” Beth added. “Those clothes look really good on you.”<br />
<br />
“Wow thanks,” Elaine exclaimed happily as she came to join them in the living room. “So do you think you guys an help me out?”<br />
<br />
Todd sat back as his three test subjects now talked amongst themselves. He could see the inner struggle Elaine was having in now dressing like the child she looked like. Todd had noticed the faintest glimmer of worry on her face after she exited the bathroom. Elaine realized she looked like every other 12 year old out in the world now. As uncomfortable as she had been though Todd noticed that she appeared more and more concerned with how Beth and Liz reacted to her. The young preteen wanted nothing more than to impress the two college women. Todd now needed to decide how he would proceed with Elaine.</p>
