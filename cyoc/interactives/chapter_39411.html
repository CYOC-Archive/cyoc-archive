<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...a girl whom she quickly identified as Hayley Hopkins. 
<br>
<br>
"Uh-oh," thought Jennifer to herself.
<br>
<br>
There was good reason to be nervous. Hayley was a tall, thin, and awkward girl, somewhat accident prone. For that reason, she was one of the many girls who hadn't made the cheerleading squad that year. Jennifer and her friends had been present at her tryouts, sitting up in the bleachers and laughing as she stumbled through her set. Jennifer remembered that Hayley had left that audition in tears.
<br>
<br>
"Oh... uh... hi, Hayley..." said Jennifer in an obviously forced saccharine tone. Maybe, Jennifer hoped, maybe Hayley wouldn't do anything if she acted really nicely...
<br>
<br>
"Well, what a surprise!" responded Hayley. "Imagine, running into you now. This must be my lucky day."
<br>
<br>
"Okay", thought Jennifer, "niceness didn't work. Feign ignorance." "W-w-what do you mean?" she asked.
<br>
<br>
"Kyle's been bragging all day about what he did to you. It was all over the lunchroom today. He told us all about how this is supposed to work. You might be happy to learn that a lot of people didn't believe him. Personally, though, I don't think he's the kind of person who'd lie about something like that. And since you're here now, I guess that means I get to be the one to prove he's not just making stuff up."
<br>
<br>
"Alright," thought Jennifer, "time for plan C: <i>RUN!</i>" Jennifer started for the door, but Hayley pulled her back sharply by the arm.
<br>
<br>
"Aha! It <i>is</i> true, isn't it?" Hayley grinned sadistically. "You're trying to get away because you know you're finally vulnerable! He really <i>has</i> knocked you down off your pedestal, hasn't he?"
<br>
<br>
"Please, Hayley..." pleaded Jennifer. This was her last resort-- begging to save herself. "Please... I promise, I'll never be mean to you or laugh at you again. I promise. Just, please, let me go, and don't tell anyone you saw me here..."
<br>
<br>
Hayley sneered. "Kyle was right. You don't get it, Jennifer."
<br>
<br>
"What don't I get?" inquired Jennifer.
<br>
<br>
"You won't be mean to me or laugh at me ever again. Right. Even if I believed you really meant it, you'd just find someone else to hurt. You think you can just apologize your way out of this, like it's not a big deal that you've spent your whole time here looking down your nose at everyone else. Well, too bad. You brought this on yourself. You can't weasel out of this one. This is justice." Hayley took a deep breath and looked Jennifer right in the eyes. The gravity of her words finally began to truly sink in. Maybe-- no, not maybe, <i>definitely</i>-- it was true. Jennifer really had been a horrible bitch to everyone.
<br>
<br>
"I've been waiting a long time to say this, Jennifer," Hayley continued. "I honestly didn't think I'd ever get the chance. But, luckily, your condescension and smug attitude have finally come back to haunt you. Now, I know I'm not the most graceful or popular or drop-dead gorgeous person. I never have been, and never will be. But I know enough to treat others with dignity and respect. You know, I'm a very sensitive person, and it's hard for me to reach out to people. I put my heart and soul into trying to join the squad, because I thought I might make some new friends. Instead, you laughed at me, and made me feel like an idiot for even trying. Well, in retrospect, I'm <i>glad</i> I'm not a part of your little posse, because now I can see you for what you really are: an arrogant ass."
<br>
<br>
"W-what did you say?" stuttered Jennifer in disbelief.
<br>
<br>
"You heard me. I think you're an ass. And, for the next five hours, everybody else is going to see you as one too. Jennifer... turn into a donkey."
<br>
<br>
"No! Please! Anything but that! HayleeeEE-HAW!" Jennifer reeled in surprise as her beautiful voice came out as a donkey's bray. The change began instantly. It started with her fingers growing together, and her fingernails growing out until her hands had become hooves. Tufts of grey and white fur began to grow around her wrists and moved up her thinning arms. She tried to move forward, but she toppled over, out of her shoes. She realized that her feet had become hooves too. She wanted to get up, but to her dismay she realized she could no longer stand erect, and she ended up on her four hooves. The change crept up her thighs. Without warning she could feel it starting to change her vagina; at first the change alarmed her greatly, but within moments it actually felt strangely satisfying. Her buttocks grew into asinine haunches, and popped her skirt open. As it fell down around her hind hooves, she could see she had grown a long wispy tail, which draped over the back of her panties. Her trunk widened and her chest flattened. At last, her neck elongated, her ears grew and flopped, her face became a donkey's muzzle, and her hair became a mane.
<br>
<br>
"Wow!" exclaimed Hayley. "That was... amazing! Better than I thought it would be! Kyle really <i>wasn't</i> kidding! Wait until everyone else sees this!"
<br>
<br>
Just as it had before, the transformation left Jennifer disoriented. "HayleEE-HAW?"
<br>
<br>
"Oh wow, you can still talk. Now everyone will <i>have</i> to believe it!"
<br>
<br>
"Why? Why wouldn't I talk? What... what have you done to meEE-HAW?"
<br>
<br>
"Exactly what I said I'd do," answered Hayley. "Jenny... you're a jenny."</p>
