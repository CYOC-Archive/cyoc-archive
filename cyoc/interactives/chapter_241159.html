<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Crystal continued to think about what to do next. What she really wanted to do was play house with the new babies she had made. Yeah, she needed a Mommy for her new babies. That’s when she noticed that the character on the second floor looking at the computer that hadn’t been picked on yet. What she didn’t know was that person was really herself in avatar form. So she decided to drag her mouse and click herself. Once again, she has limited options to pick, so she thought about what to do with herself, A.K.A. the little girl on the screen. Then something crept her mind. “Hmm…” she thought, “Let&#39;s make her the Mommy.”<br />
<br />
Crystal started by choosing the age option on the menu and typed the number 25 in the type in bar. After that, she pressed the enter key to see the process with her own eyes. But just as it was about to start, she felt a strange warmth in her body. She started flapping her shirt, wondering where that heat came from. But as soon as it came it passed. So Crystal continued to watch the virtual girl growing up before her eyes. What she didn’t know was the fact that that was her on the computer and she was really growing up at an alarming rate.<br />
<br />
The first noticeable thing that happened was her height. Her legs crept downward on the chair she was sitting at as the swung them back and forth, unaware of the changes that were taking place. Quickly, she left her childhood years behind as she fast approach eight. The remainder of baby fat she had left vanished and she was skinny as a twig. She continued to shoot up like a weed, as her height was now 3’5. Her light auburn hair grew down her head as it was up to her lower neck and her face had no pudginess left what so ever. Her pink pajama dress grew along with her as a Barbie logo appeared on her chest area. Yet, she didn’t notice herself growing. Her aware toggle was off and she hadn’t suspect anything yet. All she could do is watch the girl on the screen grow older. So far, no other changes were taking place, but that will soon change.<br />
<br />
As Crystal approached ten, puberty was beginning to take its toll. Her two nipples grew from pennies to quarters as they begin to get all puffy. Underneath her dress, her hips started to move away from each other, giving her a little bit of preteen curves. She then stopped swinging her growing legs as her toes touched the ground, while her arms were doing the same thing as well. Her hands had gotten a little dainty while her finger grew long and thing and her nails grew along with them. Her nose grew bigger and her hair went down to her shoulders while the pigment of the hair color darkened. The freckles on her face grew fainter and fainter until they vanished completely. Her nightgown changes color to a darker red color and the Barbie logo turned into a Bratz logo with the Bratz characters below it. Even her panties grew darker and became a light purplish color.<br />
<br />
When she reached thirteen, her development hit like a freight train on hull. The flesh around her pointy nipples grew until they became soft rounded mounds. Suddenly, a training bra appeared and covered the developing chest with the same color purple as her panties. The Bratz logo faded from her nightgown as it just turned into a plain red nightgown. She grew in height some more as her feet could finally touch the ground. Her hips then expand some more, creating curves around her waist. And her arms and leg, though getting longer, was developing some muscle tone as well.<br />
<br />
14-year-old, 15-year-old, 16-year-old… Crystal was now continuing her journey through her teenage years. Her breasts doubled in size, making them a pair of perky B-cups. Her hips grew out and creating the bottom of an hourglass. Her rear end started to blow up and become rounder. She started crossing her developing legs and bounced her foot up and down while she watches the girl continue to change. Nail polish appeared on her growing nails, as its color was a hot pink color which her nightgown was lightening to match. Her face was loosing its childhood innocence as it was entering adulthood. Her nose was long and thin, her lips a little puffy and full, and the shape of her face was almost oval. There were a few pimples dotted across her face, but they come and go as she kept on growing. Reddish pink lipstick appeared on her lips and light blue eyeliner showed up on her eyelids. Her hair now grew down to her upper back and it was now a muddy brown color. Her training bra exploded and became a teenage bra and her panties changed from being cotton to wool and were in a teenage style. Both of them got darker and were a dark purple color, almost black.<br />
<br />
When Crystal past sweet sixteen, something hit her mind. She was wondering what she was doing here in the first place. Her mind was growing to match her body. So her memories of seeing the girl on the computer growing up were getting dimmer and dimmer. So she uncrossed her legs, got out of the chair and said in a slightly deeper voice, “Why am I looking at this game? I haven&#39;t played Sims in years?!”<br />
<br />
She left the desk and headed to her room to go to bed. But before she was about to reach the door, the 17-year-old soon became an 18-year-old. She soon stopped in her tracks and felt something warm below her. She then instinctively placed her hand on her crouch and slowly rubbed it. Crystal moaned in pleasure and she continued to rub it harder and faster. “Oh,” she moaned, “this feels soooo goooood…” Crystal back up away from the door and approached the bed. She then sat on the bed and continued rubbing her sex area. As she was enjoying her self pleasures, she continued to grow much faster then before.<br />
<br />
Her breasts grew into a C-cup and they shook while her body gyrated. Her hips were wide and very adult and her waist had a killer hourglass figure. Her butt was now round and bubbly as it made a sleek curve around it. Her arms and legs were shapely and built, making them look quite sexy. All the pimples on her face were completely gone, replaced with smooth shiny skin. Her lips were full, her nose was elegant, and her cheekbones were thin and flat. Her dark brown hair grew down to her mid-back, as it was both shiny and wavy. Her lips and nail color changed again to dark red as her toe nails had the same color polish as her nails. Her nightgown turned purple and the fabric to silk. Her bra added black lace trim to the decoration of the purple bra and panties.<br />
<br />
Crystal now in her twenties lay on the bed as she was reaching the height of her sexuality. She couldn’t hold it for much longer. Crystal had not other choice but to scream out loud as she peaked and felt waves of pleasure crash against her like the ocean to the shore. When at last the alternating pleasures of the waves subsided to dulled throbs, Crystal urged herself to get up and to change into regular clothes. After slipping on a new set of panties she pulled on a pair of jeans and a loose blouse before checking her hair and hearing a crash downstairs.<br />
<br />
Crystal sighed, the program long forgotten now as her memories now had her slipping upstairs after brunch to get in a quick satisfying masturbation session as a bit of a break from her twin two year old terrors: Tommy and Tracey. And she came downstairs to find that they&#39;d woken up from their nap and had escaped their playpen and were destroying half the living room.<br />
<br />
Crystal picked up the two toddlers, balancing each on a hip and said, &quot;You two were so much easier to handle when you were younger.&quot; It was then that Crystal remembered the program she&#39;d downloaded on the computer just that very morning, the one that promised to Alter Reality to however you wished it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe those days can come back,&quot; wondered Crystal as instead of going to the nursery she instead turned towards her room with the computer. She set Tommy and Tracey on the bed and told them to stay there. She had hardly turned her back before Tracey had started to shuffle towards the edge of the bed Crystal heard, so she quickly rushed over to the computer and selected the baby girl character in the program and changed her age to a number she didn&#39;t have time to check. When she turned around, Crystal felt whoozy and off balance as she turned to look at her little Tommy, sitting alone dutifully on the bed like she had told him. Why had she been in a hurry to use the computer again?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why Mommy tummy big?&quot; asked Tommy innocently enough.<br />
<br />
Crystal unconsciously put her hand to her swollen belly, it wasn&#39;t as large as it was going to get, but at 5 months pregnant it still was protruding and noticeable, especially as she was just wearing a crop top that allowed her belly the freedom to just overhang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Tommy, your baby sister is inside me, growing,&quot; said Crystal as she sat down and allowed Tommy to lean against her belly, his fine brown hair tickling against her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. Me grow in Mommy tummy too?&quot; asked Tommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Tommy, you did,&quot; explained Crystal as she ran her fingers through his hair. He was such a bright little boy.</p>
