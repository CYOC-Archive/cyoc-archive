<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Warner was walking throughout tundra for a while until he looked a building at the distance, an old château. He was relieved as he was going there.<br />
<br />
Just entering, he realized it was a hotel. It was practically in the middle of nowhere, so he didn&#39;t expect too much people around. He approached the receptionist, an old lady who looked fragile although her overweight. She nicely registered him and gave him a pair of keys for a room in the third floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you enjoy your stay.&quot; The lady smiled. &quot;This is quiet place. No more guests except for a wedding on the second floor.&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded, took the keys and went to his room. Such a big place with no people, he thought as he crossed large hallways. When he arrived to the second floor he saw a few people. Family and friends that came here for the wedding. Who gets married in a place like this? He thought as he looked at the people who was waiting outside the wedding hall. He heard them complaining about how late it was but he didn&#39;t care and kept walking.<br />
<br />
Next to that hall, there was a small room where he saw a guy, maybe the groom, trying to use his phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit! No signal! Fuck!&quot; The broom cursed. &quot;I knew that getting married here was a mistake!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Warner politely asked as he stayed at the door frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, unless you can bring a guy from 800 miles in 5 minutes.&quot; The groom said sarcastically. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but none of my groomsmen arrived and my best man get trapped in the middle of a blizzard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you decide to get married in a place like this in the first place?&quot; Warner said a little bit annoyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My future wife.&quot; The groom replied. &quot;Her family and friends are from around here. In my case, just my parents and my little brothers came to the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Little brothers?&quot; Warner asked wickedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, 5 years old twins.&quot; The groom said. &quot;One of them is the ring bearer. Would it be weird if a kid was my best man?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A little. But I have something that could help you.&quot; Warner grinned. &quot;Call your brothers.&quot;<br />
<br />
The groom had a puzzled face but he called for his brothers. A minute later, two small boys in tuxedo arrived to the room. They looked identical, same blonde hair and blue ayes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, now what?&quot; The groom said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you say if I told you I can make one these kids older enough to be your best man.&quot; Warner said as he opened his suitcase.<br />
<br />
&quot;That you&#39;re crazy.&quot; The groom replied when he saw the gun in Warner&#39;s hand. &quot;Woah! Calm down, dude! Don&#39;t shoot, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is not a fire gun, this is the pubertifier.&quot; Warner said. &quot;Can turn a kid into a man in a matter of seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; The groom said in disbelief. &quot;So, you&#39;re going to turn one of my little brothers into an adult so he can be my best man? Ha! You&#39;re definitely crazy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me show you.&quot; Warner said and he shot to one of the boys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t!!&quot; The groom yelled. &quot;If you hurt him...&quot; But he stopped yelling when he saw his brother getting a little taller. His small tuxedo was getting tight at the same time. In a few seconds, he stopped growing. Barely notable but he was a little bit bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m bigger.&quot; The kid said as he looked at his small twin brother next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s bigger.&quot; The groom babbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I told you. I made him just a year older.&quot; Warner said. &quot;Do you trust me now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, can you grow my brother so he can be my best man?&quot; Warner nodded. &quot;The ring bearer can stay the same. Well, he&#39;s now a year older, hehe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be bigger like my brother!&quot; The kid said as he was hit by the gun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I forget about the tuxedo. Take it off or it will be ruined.&quot; Warner said as he saw the clothes getting tight on the kids body. He took them off, except for his trousers because his older brother told him to keep them.<br />
<br />
He quickly gained height until he was a foot tall. His arms and legs grew lanky as well as his hands and feet. He now resembled a 10 year old boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel funny.&quot; He said in a little deeper voice. &quot;I&#39;m bigger than my tWin!&quot; He shouted when his voice cracked. &quot;WhOaA! WhAt&#39;s happEning to mY vOIce?&quot;<br />
<br />
The groom knew that his brother was going through puberty when he suddenly grew another foot. His body was stretching everywhere and muscles were beginning to be visible.<br />
<br />
Curly hairs began to appear on his legs going upward from his feet until they hide inside the now small trousers. Pubes sprouted on his crotch and thighs and kept their way upward creating a treasure trail. <br />
<br />
&quot;Twin bro! You&#39;re hairy like daddy and big bro!&quot; The kid at the room laughed when he saw the growing bushes under his brother&#39;s armpits.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s itchy!&quot; The guy said in a way more deeper voice than before. Hair grew on his arms too and, judging by the itch, in his ass too.<br />
<br />
His ass pumped like a balloon into a perfect bubble butt, so big and juicy that it tore his briefs. He had never felt the need to hide his genitals but for some reason he was embarrassed of showing them off now. Hiding in his hands, he realized that his pee pee had grown too. It felt funny, he can&#39;t stop rubbing it. It felt fat and meaty, hairy and itchy. His balls felt different too, big and heavy. They weren&#39;t marbles anymore but large chicken eggs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah!! What happened to your pee pee?&quot; The kid shouted. &quot;It&#39;s too big! Mine will get big too?!&quot; He smiled as he saw his tiny set.<br />
<br />
Muscles grew modesty but notable everywhere. Thick legs that matched his curly hair. Broad shoulders and a pair of juicy pecs covered in a light of dusting hair. He flexed his arms involuntary showing a few muscles there and two really messy armpits. Finally, a subtle shade appeared on his face, as his jaw get squarer and more pronounced.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re older little bro!&quot; The groom said to the new man who was as tall as him. &quot;Now you can be my best man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m nakey.&quot; He replied embarrassed,  he felt exposed although he used to like go around naked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not!&quot; Said the only kid left in the room. &quot;You have a lot of hair, like our dog! Look at you feet! They&#39;re huge!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Woow My feet aren&#39;t that big.&quot; The groom said. &quot;You must be a size 14, at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
He wiggled his toes, they were so long and different that he was ashamed to show them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, bro.&quot; The groom said. &quot;Let&#39;s find you some clothes!&quot;</p>
