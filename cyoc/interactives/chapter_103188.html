<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary spent the rest of the morning testing things.<br />
<br />
First, she had measured herself and found she had gone from a tall five eleven to a much smaller five foot three. No wonder her clothes her fallen away! She hadn&#39;t lost any proportions, though, it was just her overall scale that had been reduced. It was strange having gone from the size she had always been to a smaller version of her normal self, but at the same time it was new and a little more than titilating.<br />
<br />
She had long abandoned her oversized blouse and now stood naked at the table, carefully rifling through the vials.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wonder...&quot; She said aloud to herself, finding the &quot;shrinking&quot; vial again after quite some time.<br />
<br />
Her pet fish Goldie sat in the corner of the counter space, oblivious to the goings on around him. Mary poured as close to half as she could measure into the fish&#39;s bowl, and waited. She waited a long time before turning away in boredom. When she glanced back, she squinted into the tank and swore the fish might be smaller, but there was no obvious changing going on.<br />
<br />
In confusion, she went to the kitchen cupboard, grabbed a glass from the top shelf on her tippy toes, and set it on the counter before her, some plan for herself in motion. When she looked back to the fish bowl, her eyes widened and she smiled in excitement. Now the gold fish had clearly shrunken in size, but unlike Mary, it seemed to be happening at an oh so gradual pace compared to her rapid dwindling.<br />
<br />
She wondered why for a moment, and then realization hit. Water! The potion had been dilluded in the fish&#39;s water! She stared intently at the fish, and counted the seconds that ticked by. Sure enough, it she paid careful attention, the animal was in fact shrinking continuously, but so slowly that it was barely perceptible. There was something else, too. When the gold fish reached half his normal self, about the amount of potion Mary had put in to test, he kept right on shrinking until he was the size of a minnow, right on to a small spec in the fish bowl.<br />
<br />
The second realization hit, and Mary quickly used her net to catch the dot of a fish, scoop him out, and then quickly empty his water and flood the bowl with new fresh water for him. She put him back in, and confirmed her theory as the fish stopped shrinking entirely, a little orange dot in the bowl. She considered that fish didn&#39;t &quot;drink&quot; their water like humans did, and the fish must have shrunk from the contact of the potion around him, not because he drank it.<br />
<br />
Eagerly, she ran back to the box of vials, flipped through until she found a &quot;growing&quot; potion, and emptied the whole thing into the bowl before putting it back. As she turned from the box towards the fish bowl, her pet was visibly enlarging. From a fish spec, he was now twice that and still getting bigger. Her eyes widened as she realized she had given him a full dose of growth potion, and even diluded in the water it was acting incredibly fast.<br />
<br />
Soon, the gold fish was getting far too big for his bowl, and Mary upended it into a bigger tote she quickly emptied out, watching in amazement as the gold fish, still surrounded by water spiked by growth potion, kept getting bigger and bigger. So big, in fact, he started flopping around violently as he outgrew the water around him and kept gaining size.<br />
<br />
Now a while foot long, Mary giggled and quickly poured water from the sink into the tote, saving her pet from suffocating and slowing the growing down more as the potion diluded. Now she watched in amazement as he gained size at a slower but no less incredible pace. She blinked as the animal became two feet long, so huge she could make out each individual fish scale on his shimmering body. At three feet long the container was far too small again, and the gold fish struggle and flailed about as he became cramped, kicking up water and splashing Mary.<br />
<br />
She carried the sloshing fish and Tote to the bath, quickly turned the water on, and marveled as once again her fishy friend was way too big for the water surrounding him. She reached into the tote, grabbing the fish in both arms and feeling his powerful and huge body splash and slap against her, fighting all the while, and with a heavy grunt she dropped him from the tote into the bath as it filled.<br />
<br />
Now free of the growing potion, the giant gold fish swam in circles in the bath tub, occasionally flicking his tail in annoyance and splashing water everywhere. Mary giggled at the sight, and then felt the familiar sensation of tingling overtaking her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!&quot; She blinked, staring at the mostly empty tote she had carried the fish into the bathroom with, and stared down at the water that had soaked her from head to toe.<br />
<br />
There in the bathroom, her recently enlarged gold fish starting to settle down in her bathtub, Mary gave a cry as she felt a *powerful* version of the pulling sensation she had experienced while shrinking. It kicked in hard enough that her back arched and she temporarily lost her breath. When she opened her eyes, she stared in the mirror to find she had quickly become her normal size again... and her job dropped as she swiftly grew beyond it at a terrible pace.<br />
<br />
In a moment, she darted for the door and banged her head on the door frame. She had to rinse the growth potion off! And fast! She might keep growing just like the fish! Sure enough, as she bent down in the hallway, she gulped nervously as she quickly had to get down on her hands and knees to get through. As she entered the kitchen, crawling, she easily filled it with her increasing size.<br />
<br />
As her giant hand fumbled for the spray gun at the sink, her tiny fingers struggled to manipulate the trigger as her head bumped the ceiling for a second time and forced her to duck. Her feet banged the oven, and she scrunched down as much as she could as her supple body filled the while kitchen. Finally, her huge finger depressed the spray gun, and a little water soaked over her head and began to wash away the intensified growth potion.<br />
<br />
She felt it starting to slow, and as the last of the potion washed off her body and soaked the floor beneath her, she quickly crawled out of the damp kitchen and into the living room, panting as she felt the growth pulse a little longer before dying away all together. She sprawled in the living room, her head on one wall and her foot touching the opposite end, and blinked in shock as she realized she must be about twenty or thirty feet tall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Mary said softly. &quot;I think I&#39;m done experimenting for now.&quot;</p>
