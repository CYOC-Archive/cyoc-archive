<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But then, Bobby had a wicked thought.  After a few quick mental commands, he left, knowing he'd be coming back later to check.<br />
<br />
&quot;You girls play in your room,&quot; said Jennifer's mother, Janet, who was 29.  &quot;I have to finish the laundry before I go out this evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK Mommy,&quot; Jennifer said. She and Ashley headed upstairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so glad Bobby left us with our adult brains, even though he made us 5 again,&quot; Ashley said once they were upstairs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Jennifer said.  &quot;God I can't wait for him to come back later so we can gr-- huh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Ashley asked?<br />
<br />
&quot;You look different,&quot; Jennnifer replied. &quot;Like I wouldn't say you were 5. More like 7. You look taller somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Ashley asked. She turned and looked in the mirror and sure enough, there was a 7-year-old blonde girl looking back at her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, downstairs, a 27-year-old Janet put her clothes in the dryer and sat down in front of the TV. She put on MSNBC to catch up with the day's events.<br />
<br />
&quot;Omigosh, you look different too!&quot; Ashley said upstairs.  &quot;You look older again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked in the mirror and was amazed. Her once age appropriate clothes were again too small.  Not only that, she was taller than Ashley. Well, she was normally a little taller than Ashley, but now, it was at least two inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm 11!&quot; Jennifer exclaimed! &quot;And you look 8 now! We're getting older again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow Jennifer! Your boobies are starting to grow back!&quot; Ashley said, looking at the small bumps pushing out the tiny shirt made for a kindergartener.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, 24-year-year-old Janet sipped her tea as she watched her news show, only vaguely interested. She did notice, however, that her jeans felt looser, especially around her thighs and waist (most of the baby weight from her second child, Jennifer, was gone, although she didn't realize it.  Suddenly, her son, Jimmy toddled in. He was now a 2-year-old in oversized 9-year-old clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mommy,&quot; he said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sweetie, where did you get those clothes?&quot; she asked in a soothing tone.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, the girls had pulled off the too-small clothes and were both nude.  They were facinated with what was happening.  In the last few minutes, Ashley had grown to 10 years old, skinny as a rail until her boobs started to redevelop. Jennifer was now 15 and curvy again, with healthy C-cup breasts. Her skinny waist was starting to stretch as her hip bones expanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bobby had to have done this!&quot; Ashley said. This isn't accidental. He wanted to have fun with his power!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew, I have zits!&quot; Jennifer said. &quot;Its so weird, he left our brains older so I feel like I should have stopped getting these a while ago ... but here I am getting them for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, the first time in a few hours,&quot; Ashley replied.<br />
<br />
Downstairs, 20-year-old Janet was rummaging through the cupboards, looking for something sweet to eat; the tea hadn't exactly hit the spot with her changing taste buds. She was uncounciously pulling up her looser pants, while wondering why she had picked such an ill-fitting bra that morning. Suddenly, a cry came out from the living room.  She walked in to find a newborn baby lying on the couch, swaddled in clothes made for an obviously older child.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did this baby come from?&quot; 18-year-old Janet wondered, forgetting not only that this was her son, but that she was the one that had swaddled him. As she turned, she saw her reflection in the mirror. &quot;Ew, I've got a zit!&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
Upstairs the girls began to plot what to do next, but couldn't keep their eyes off of themsleves in the mirror as they changed. In a matter of minutes, Ashley grew from 11 to 12 to 13, already gaining back much of the curves she lost earlier.  Jennifer meanwhile aged from 17 to 19 to 21, a full adult again, just as Bobby had left her this afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK kid, we need to sneak down the hall to grab clothes from my mom's room without her or Jimmy seeing us,&quot; Jennifer said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me kid!&quot; Ashley said. &quot;My birthday is before yours, and my mental age is still 21 you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kid, when you've got tits like these again,&quot; Jennifer said pointing back and fourth from her mature nearly 36 DD chest and Ashely's chest, still on the border between B and C, &quot;we'll re-evaluate. For now, I need you to keep watch.<br />
<br />
Not so.  All of a sudden, they heard pop music blasting from downstairs.  The girls ran down to see 13-year-old Janet dancing and singing along in nothing but her blouse and her now baggy panties. Her jeans had been tossed to the side.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mom?&quot; asked Jennifer in shock.<br />
<br />
Janet turned around and shrieked in surprise. &quot;Who are you, lady? and why are you naked with another naked kid with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom it's me, Jennifer. Don't you remember?&quot; Jennifer asked, while silently cursing Bobby. <br />
<br />
At that moment, the blouse seemed to drift a little lower on Janet's body as she regressed from 13 to 11; Jennifer couldn't help but notice Ashley looked a tad taller and bustier, obviously now 14. Jennifer pegged herself at around 23 now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer?&quot; Janet asked, confused.  &quot;Oh, is this your baby?&quot;  <br />
<br />
She pointed at the still newborn Jimmy, still wrapped in his older clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Jennifer said, &quot;That's Jimmy, my, uh baby.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Neat,&quot; said 9-year-old Janet, wiping her nose on her sleeve. &quot;I like babies.  I'm gonna be a good babysitter when I get older, thanks for teaching me. What's your name again?&quot;<br />
<br />
25-year-old Jennifer looked over at 15-year-old Ashley with confusion. Ashley was a bit preoccupied with her own returned teen-hood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jennifer. And this is your baby sitter Ashley, remember? She is helping out so you learn how.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool!&quot; said the 9-year-old. &quot;Why's she naked? Are we going in the pool?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer just sighed.</p>
