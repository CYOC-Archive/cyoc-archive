<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Harry felt a bit better to be back in his family&#39;s home that evening. He didn&#39;t like losing a day thanks to some random agent from Alabama playing pranks, but he was now gone and he and Jenny would have time to try again on Sunday. In fact, his parents had even called his brother on the ride home. His brother didn&#39;t work normally on Sunday, but he did agree to come over for breakfast and meet Jenny on his own. He&#39;d take whatever notes that were needed for installing the separate apartment after breakfast and getting to know Jenny. That was pleasing to Harry. He wanted his brother to meet Jenny, the woman he loved and the vixen he became a were for, even her own introduction to were society wasn&#39;t typical.<br />
<br />
He returned from a quick trip to the bathroom to find Jenny seating on the couch with Henry and Lisa, his parents. They were talking with Jenny over the confidence they had in things being better. He couldn&#39;t help but smile as he heard Jenny talk her hopes for a happy family of her own with Harry.<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean it,&quot; Jenny spoke, &quot;you two... and pretty much everyone else in Moon Lake have been so kind to me. And it&#39;s nice to have such a tight knit community, but with you two... it&#39;s even closer. It&#39;s more like family. Well, a proper family, anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And of course it&#39;ll be,&quot; Henry said with a smile, &quot;you&#39;ll be marrying Harry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we will be welcoming you to the family,&quot; Lisa added, &quot;no matter what your biological family says and definitely no matter what that Wilhelm  guy pulls, we will be glad to have you as part of our family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenny smiled back, feeling great to have the Jenkins family around her.<br />
<br />
She was still frustrated by having her family raise so much trouble for Moon Lake and essentially delay the progress in getting ready for the wedding, but having Harry there and having the support of the Jenkins was enough to make her feel better. Knowing that the Andersons would also be there for her things came to it, also made her feel better. It gave her a feeling of love and inclusion that she really didn&#39;t get in Alabama, not from her parents, anyway. It helped her greatly with memorizing her mantra and made her willing to do what she could to defend what would be her new home. Her family did deserve to know that she was getting married and they did have a right to be at the ceremony, but it was her life. She was to be Jennifer Jenkins, and she would fight for her right to be with her bonded mate for all time.<br />
<br />
Harry smiled heavily as he rejoined them and sat down beside Jenny, wrapping one arm around her shoulders. She smiled back to him and kissed his cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... you were still talking about families,&quot; Harry said with a smile to his fiance.<br />
<br />
&quot;How being around your parents feels like having a proper family around,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;exactly the kind of family one should have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And exactly the kind of family we will have,&quot; Harry said to her confidently, &quot;we will get through everything  we will he happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny only smiled and moved to cuddle up to Harry, feeling great pleasure and joy as she felt her back rub against Harry&#39;s chest, even through their respective shirts. It felt so good just to be near him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope so,&quot; Jenny said with a smile as she reached for Harry&#39;s hands and felt the joy of having his fingers interlace with hers, &quot;as it would allow us all to be happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry quietly rubbed her shoulders while his parents smiled from the chairs they were seated in. They didn&#39;t say anything but watching Harry and Jenny together reminded them of when they were young lovers themselves. Young enough to easily feel the burn of raw passion while also having the romantic devotion to stand by each other&#39;s side even when other pressures threaten them. Seeing that their younger son had found someone to be so in love with made them smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what&#39;s got you dwelling on the joys of having a happy family?&quot; Harry asked to Jenny, &quot;You&#39;re not nervous?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over being with you? I&#39;m not nervous,&quot; Jenny smiled, &quot;what&#39;s got me thinking of it has just been the kindness you&#39;ve all shown me... the kindness that everyone in Moon Lake has shown me. Mrs. Tachibana has her family, her sons and daughters, her grandsons and granddaughters.&quot; Jenny looked to Henry and Lisa, &quot;You two have each other and two wonderful sons, one of whom I am going to marry and spend my life with forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry smiled and kissed the top of Jenny&#39;s head while his fiance continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Andersons have each other and their family, and all of you have done so much for me and gone so far out of your way to make me feel welcome,&quot; Jenny continued.<br />
<br />
Harry did pick up on something there where Jenny had mentioned the Andersons. That reminded him of something he overheard at the ceremony about some offer that Mr. Anderson had made. He was a bit puzzled by that and curious to find out what this offer was.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Andersons? Like Mr. Anderson? Our English Professor?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;Yvette clawed him too, remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry answered, &quot;but aside from that... what does he have to do with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... a couple of days ago when I was wrestling with some of the things my folks were pulling, he noticed it during class,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and correctly guessed that I&#39;ve been looking for a real family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which you&#39;ll have with us, dear,&quot; Lisa assured her.<br />
<br />
Jenny nodded, &quot;Of course... but that didn&#39;t change Mr. Anderson&#39;s opinion on the matter. He offered that if things went bad with my folks to the point where they either haven&#39;t changed or won&#39;t realize that I love you, Harry, that he and his wife would be more than willing to be surrogate parents for me. Sage advice and protection... gifts... family love. That sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds pretty typical for Moon Lake,&quot; Henry commented, &quot;members every were-species standing up for each other... shoot... even the Normal population here behaves in the same way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And its something that shouldn&#39;t change,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;It&#39;s one of those things that&#39;s made me fall in love with the town almost as much as I&#39;ve fallen in love with Harry. It&#39;s nice... it provides comfort... and I never want to lose it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you won&#39;t,&quot; Harry promised her and gave her a warm hug. He knew she&#39;d been struggling with that sort of thing, and if Mr. Anderson was offering some additional help, so long as Jenny remained his bonded mate, he had no problem with it.<br />
<br />
Jenny only smiled back but couldn&#39;t stifle a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know after everything... I think I&#39;m ready for bed,&quot; Jenny spoke, her voice sounding completely content.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad an idea,&quot; Henry smiled to his son and future daughter in law, &quot;pleasant dreams you two.&quot;</p>
