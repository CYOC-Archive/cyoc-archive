<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How did a third timeline form,” Gloria exclaimed. Kellie, Jack, And Ann turned to eachother shrugging before turning to Gloria. “No idea,” Kellie answered. “To be honest we’ve been trying to figure it out on our end.”<br />
<br />
“How do we know Gloria here isn’t the new timeline,” Ann stated. “I mean, I remember my mom and dad here. I also remember when we first met when Aunt Lisa and your dad started dating. Why  do you always do that Glo, try to make everything about you.”<br />
<br />
Gloria sat and stared dumbfounded at the teenage girl. Whatever reality this Ann came from it appeared the two of them didn’t exactly have the greatest relationship. “I really need to work on my sister skills,” she groaned. Taking a deep breath she now looked at the goth teen. “Okay Ann you have a point,” she conceded. “Who knows exactly which timeline came first. For now though we’re going to have to work together okay.”<br />
<br />
Ann nodded. “Okay So what’s the plan then?”<br />
<br />
“We’re going to talk with Lynne,” Gloria said. “Maybe the future can tell us what exactly is going on.”<br />
<br />
“Great,” Ann grumbled. “She was a pain in the ass when she visited the first time. She even turned me into a baby when she was born. You do the talking, me and her really didn’t get along.”<br />
<br />
Gloria agreed as the two teens now approached Lynne and the other time travelers. As they did Gloria asked a few questions, quickly discovering this Ann’s timeline was almost identical to her own. In Teen Ann’s timeline Morgan still tried to attack before becoming Katie’s infant daughter. This Ann had participated in the battle but said it was mostly Gloria that helped turn the tide. It also appeared that some of the things that had happened to Aunt Ann in Gloria’s timeline happened to this Ann. Ann and Lisa had come to an understanding after she was transformed into a teenager for a weekend, Lynne had transformed Teen Ann into an infant when she was born, and Ann and Jackie were both in the beginnings of what would become a long term relationship.<br />
<br />
As the two teens approached they could see Lynne and her friends happily watching the wedding. Tricia was still crying tears of joy as Kari and Morgan happily watched their parents dance. Finally Tommy and Lynne watched as Tommy clutched Lynne in a loving embrace. Turning Lynne now saw her sister approach, smiling and waving as she approached. “Was wondering where you were sis,” she smiled.<br />
<br />
“Hi Lynne,” Gloria said, smiling at her little sister. “Good to see you and your friends. I need to ask a couple of questions.”<br />
<br />
“Sounds important,” Lynne said, removing her boyfriends arms from around her. “What’s on your mind?”<br />
<br />
Gloria now gestured her sister to the side, she was angry with her that she hadn’t said anything about Claudia and Mika. While that was a question, she also needed to know about this new timeline. “Lynne why didn’t you say anything about the attack by the Kitsune?”<br />
<br />
“What attack,” Lynne said, shocked that something had happened.<br />
<br />
“Mika, her family, Jen and Claudia were attacked by a Kitsune,” Gloria stated. “Gloria got hurt real bad Nd Kari was turned into an infant. Why didn’t you give us a warning?”<br />
<br />
Lynne stared dumbfounded at her sister before turning to Morgan, “Hey Morgan come here,” she called. Morgan now approached, a loving smile etched on her delicate teenage features. “Hi Aunt Gloria,” she said happily. “Lynne what’s up?”<br />
<br />
“Did you know Fukushu attacked Mika and Claudia,” Lynne asked. <br />
<br />
“What no,” Morgan stammered. “I thought we took care of that on our last visit.”<br />
<br />
“So Kari never said anything about how she was turned into Ann infant,” Lynne asked, raising an eyebrow. “And your moms never said anything about Mika and Claudia getting hurt.”<br />
<br />
“Of course not,” Morgan said defensively. <br />
<br />
“Wait you two didn’t know,” Gloria asked. Lynne and Morgan shook their heads no. “No,” Morgan whispered. “My moms said that Kari just transformed into an infant because of the spell Lilith had placed on her.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah that’s the story I heard too,” Lynne added. “Trust me sis if we had known we would of said something.”<br />
<br />
Gloria nodded, she could understand why Katie and the others had kept that a secret. From what Gloria had seen Lynne was the kind of girl that wanted to fix everything. If she had known chances are she would of tried to warn them. If that had been done Kari may never had become the girl Lynne and the others knew. “Lynne, Morgan,” Gloria said. “Look it’s not your fault okay. Your moms probably thought it best not to tell you that, especially considering you’ve already altered the past once.”<br />
<br />
“Everyone’s going to be okay though right,” Morgan asked with concern.<br />
<br />
“Yeah they’ll be fine,” Gloria lied. “There is one more thing though.” Curiously Lynne and Morgan now followed Gloria as she led them to a teenage goth girl. “Hey Aunt Ann,” Lynne smiled. “Guessing your here as Jackie’s date?”<br />
<br />
“That’s not the Ann you know,” Gloria sighed.<br />
<br />
“Good seeing you two sis,” teen Ann grumbled. “You causing more problems?”<br />
<br />
Lynne gave the teenage goth a confused look before turning towards Gloria. “This Ann is from another timeline,” Gloria stated. “One where she’s our sister. Was hoping you knew something about this.”<br />
<br />
Lynne gaped at the girl, shocked to discover that a third timeline now connected to this one. As she was about to answer, both her and Morgan doubled over in pain clutching their heads. “Oh shit Lynne, Morgan” Ann and Gloria cried as they raced towards the teens. Holding the two future teens up, they now worriedly gazed at them as they held their heads.<br />
<br />
“Lynne, Morgan,” Ann asked quietly. “Are you two Okay?”<br />
<br />
Lynne and Morgan now took several deep breaths, their eyes wide as they tried to process what had just happened. “Oh no,” Morgan whispered, trembling slightly.<br />
<br />
“What, what happened,” Gloria exclaimed.<br />
<br />
Lynne and Morgan gave eachother nervous looks as they now shakily got to there feet. “Gloria, Ann,” Lynne replied grimly. “The future just changed again.”</p>
