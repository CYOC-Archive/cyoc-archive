<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was another who had heard the call for help and her name was Femsha. She was now on a catwalk in the warehouse in her black spandex suit. Her suit almost covered her fully the only holes were for her eyes, nose, and mouth. There were pouches around her waist which were also black. Looking down at the scene now she moved her hand to one of the pouches. She withdrew a small light blue sphere which looked like a BB. As she did she heard Gelman say in it's dual voice &quot;Why I collect boys and you'll be a great addition. It's no use struggling, you can't escape and no one will come in time to rescue you.&quot; An evil laugh escaped it's lips.<br />
<br />
'We'll see about that' Femsha thought as she tossed the light blue sphere at the creature. She was glad to see that her aim was true and there was a small explosion. She could see that her FreezeB made the material this thing was made of brittle though both it and the boy just looked on in shock. &quot;Break it and get out of here you idiot&quot; she shouted. The boy was able to break out and fly up out of the warehouse. Looking down she decided to throw a few more freezeBs and then get out herself. The thing's body flowed to one point and a tentacle shot for her. She dodged it and didn't wait to see what her FreezeBs did. Instead she ran to a shadow and dived into it.<br />
<br />
Femsha rolled as she hit the floor in a strange room. It was pitch black but somehow one could still see. There were two benches along one wall. One bench was holding chemicals and strange tools. The other held photos, newspaper clippings, maps, and a computer. Along another wall was a bed with pink bedding, a cedar dresser, and a full length mirror. On the bed were the clothes she had been wearing before going to that boy's rescue. She took off the belt that held her pouches. There were a total of four, one pouch for each of her special BBs. The light blue ones were her FreezeBs, the red ones were her ExplosiveBs, the black ones were her SmokeBs, and the white ones were her LightBs.<br />
<br />
Taking off her suit her hair is revealed as being curly platinum blond down to about mid back. Her breasts were a B cup and she had a straight figure. She looked at herself in the mirror and was happy with what she saw. It wasn't the body she had before the accident but that was in the past. Walking over to the bench she picked up a photo. This photo was of her and her biological family. She was not always a fifteen year old girl. Once, she had been a thirty-four year old man. She had had a younger brother who was thirty. That was before the accident though.<br />
<br />
She let her mind drift back to that fateful day. They had been touring a lab that was run by one of her dad's friends. He had to be called away suddenly and he gave the tour over to a young assistant. He took them to a lab where they were researching Dark Matter. Unfortunately the equipment they were using decided to malfunction at that time causing an explosion and she had blacked out. When she woke up she was in this place and she had thought she had died. The only thing that convinced her that she wasn't dead was the fact that she was a girl. She had been completely naked and she had freaked. She had walked backward as if she could get away from the fact by doing that. She had come out in an alley in Dawn City only to run into her adoptive mother. She had foreseen the arrival of a young girl from the shadows and that she should adopt her. She did and named her Lisa.<br />
<br />
Now Lisa Mordain sighed and put the picture down. They had found the bodies of everyone in that particular lab except for four. That was Lisa's old body, her brother's, the assistant's, and one of the lab techs. Looking over the newspaper clippings she began thinking about Black Rose. She had appeared in Dawn City about the same time she did. Could she have once been her younger brother? The authorities could never figure out how she was able to get into places with no signs of forced entry. Could Black Rose have the same power to use shadows like she could?<br />
<br />
Femsha let her mind wander back again. It took her weeks to get used to her new body, especially the periods. It took her a little longer to figure out what her powers were and to gain control over them. She had the power to use shadows to move from place to place and to stick to any surface. She also gained the knowledge to make her special BBs. Once she had learned to control her powers she brought what she thought she would need to her shadow room. She brought the bed, dresser, and mirror here because she figured that she would need a quiet place to work and study.<br />
<br />
Bringing her mind back to the present again she sighed and started to get dressed again. Her adoptive parents were expecting her home for a formal dinner party. They were rich, one of the two rich families in the city, and they tried to do good with their money. Looking at a clock on the dresser she saw that she should have been home ten minutes ago. She lost track of time again and it would take her ten minutes to walk home from where she had jumped into the shadows to rescue the boy. She shrugged and decided to go directly to her room since her adoptive parents knew about her powers.<br />
<br />
Stepping through the wall and out of the shadows created by her closet. Her mother was there with her arms crossed and looking stern. She always knew when and where she would be coming out of the shadows. &quot;You're ten minutes late young lady&quot; she said. &quot;I want to hear why you're late but you need to get ready for the dinner. We'll talk after.&quot; She turned around and left her room. She knew that her mother wouldn't forget. At least she knew about her powers and her heroine gig. Sighing she began to get ready for dinner.</p>
