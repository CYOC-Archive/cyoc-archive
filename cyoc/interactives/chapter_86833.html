<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Park got to school just as the bell was ringing.  He sat through the his morning classes bored out of his mind.  When lunch finally arrived he met Jae up under the bleachers.  It was as though they were seeing each other for the first time.  They immediately started making out.  As they removed their shirts, their spanish teacher caught them.<br />
&quot;What do you boys think you are doing?&quot; Mr. Johnson said.<br />
Mr. Johnson was in his mid 50s, overweight and just bitter.  He had never married and seemed to have a thing against gays and minorities.  <br />
&quot;I&#39;m dragging your asses to the principals, you need to learn how to behave in public&quot; he said.<br />
Park and Jae exchanged glances and giggled.<br />
&quot;No dude...We think you need to learn...how to behave.&quot;<br />
Jae then whipped out what looked at ipad and pressed a few buttons on it and Mr. Johnson froze, dropping his textbooks and papers.<br />
<br />
Name: Mark Johnson<br />
Age: 53<br />
Height: 6&#39;0<br />
Weight: 240<br />
Body Type: Overweight - beer belly/out of shape<br />
Hair Color: Greying/balding<br />
Eye Color: Brown<br />
Sexuality: Straight<br />
Interests: Reading, Watching TV, Porn<br />
<br />
Park looked at the profile and looked at Jae and said &quot;This racist bitch could use a new outlook on life&quot;<br />
Jae nodded and decided to let a template do the work for him.  &quot;Cambia puta!&quot;  he said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
Mr. Johnson had no idea what was going on or why he couldn&#39;t move but something caught the corner of his eye, the skin of his fingers had turned a rich caramel and it seemed to be spreading up his arms.  &quot;What the fuck are you faggots doing to me?!?!&quot;  He yelled with a desperation in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trust us...you&#39;ll love it.&quot;  Park replied.<br />
<br />
As he said this, he seemed to now be looking up slightly at the two Korean studs.  His height had gone from 6&#39;0 to 5&#39;7 as the caramel coloring continued to spread, unbeknownst to him, under his clothing, which was loosing.  It seemed like he was deflating but at the same time, he could feel a new found strength in his frozen muscles. <br />
His worn out dress shoes were the first to change.  The morphed into a pair of flipflops.  His pants, which he was swimming in already due to his loss of height, seemed to disappear but stopped just below his knee.  The khaki pants changed one leg at a time.  The right leg turned white, while the left leg turned into thick blue and white stripes.  They finished reforming into a pair swim trunks.  As the drawstring tightened, his waist also contracted going from a 40 in waist to 38 until it finally settled at a 30 in. waist.<br />
Mr. Johnson watched in horror as these changes happened and the caramel coloring spread from his feet, and up his legs.  As it spread, the hairs on his legs disappears.  It was then he screamed out in a mix of pain and ecstasy as his calf muscles grew more muscular.  The fat in his thighs and ass, slowly became muscle.  His ass bubbled out.  Then he let out a moan as his cock grew from 6in to 10 in hard.<br />
<br />
Park looked at Jae, &quot;What did you choose?&quot;<br />
&quot;We need some variety in our group of friends, so I choose something that we would like, but that Mr. Johnson would find ironic...&quot; Jae smiled.<br />
<br />
Mr. Johnson shirt vanished, leaving a pasty beer belly and man boobs but that was soon to be rectified.  Mr. Johnson&#39;s gut slowly deflated and in its place, 6 beautiful caramel colored abs.  Pecs then began to form, not as muscular as Jae and Park but still very impressive.  His arms and forearms became more muscular.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the part Ive been looking forward to most&quot;  Jae said and smirked.<br />
<br />
The fat drained from Mr. Johnson&#39;s neck as it followed suit, changing color.  Then as the color spread to his face, he began to get younger.  Going from 53 to 17 in a matter of seconds.  His lips plumped out.  His nose enlarged a little and his eyes went from a dead brown to a hypnotic hazel.  His hair grew back to ear length and was brown with some sunkissed highlights.<br />
<br />
Park couldnt resist any longer.  He went up to Mr. Johnson, who was too busy questioning his sanity, to really notice that Park had rolled down his swimtrunks.  Park devoured Mr. Johnson&#39;s cock eagerly.  Mr. Johnson who was fully capable of moving now, surrendered to the experience.  As he did this, everything he dropped reformed itself into a surfboard.  Mr. Johnson felt his mind being rewritten.  He could speak both Spansh and English.  His family had moved here from Puerto Rico when he was 4.  He immediately took to the ocean like a fish, spending his days surfing and chilling with his friends.  He now remembered Park and Jae not as his slacker students, but as some of his closest buds.  When he wasn&#39;t catching waves, as a the surfing prodigy he had become, he was either off skating with Park and Jae or hanging out with them.  His identity as Mr. Johnson had vanished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude...that was killer!!!&quot;  Marco said.  <br />
<br />
As reality shifted replace Mr. Johnson with Marco Suarez. Jae said &quot;I thought you were skipping...what are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marco said &quot;I saw you guys and wanted to double check to see if you wanted to join me.  Sposed to be some killer waves today.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah...we got some stuff to take care of here but and some other friends might catch up with you later.&quot; Jae said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright bud...Im outtie.&quot; And with that, Marco grabbed his board and headed off to the beach.<br />
<br />
&quot;The surfer option, eh?  Awesome.  Pretty funny making him Puerto Rican.&quot; Park said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup...can&#39;t wait to see who we change next&quot; Jae said and smirked.  &quot;Now where were we?&quot;  He grabbed Park and pulled him close, passionately kissing him.</p>
