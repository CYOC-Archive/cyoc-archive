<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gina pulled out an orange can with a picture of the words &quot;Nature's Goodness&quot; in purple font on a scroll, just <br />
above a picture of a horn-shaped basket with fruits in it. If Gina had to guess, she'd say it was some kind of <br />
all natural fruit punch or something like that. What was worrisome, however, was a sticker on the can that <br />
said &quot;!UNTESTED!&quot; in bold lettering.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, James,&quot; She said, pointing to the sticker. &quot;I though you said this tested on animals already? What's <br />
this about?&quot;<br />
<br />
James looked at the sticker and seemed confused himself. &quot;Uh... huh. I don't know what to tell you, that's <br />
just what Dr. Noriko gave me for testing. I guess there could have been a mix-up...?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina stared at the can thoughtfully. Drinking something totally untested could be very dangerous, especially <br />
since there was no assurance she'd be compensated anyway. Sure, James SEEMED earnest, but don't the best liars <br />
always seem honest?<br />
<br />
&quot;...How much would I get paid, anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;About... 10,000 dollars, I think Dr. Noriko said... but I want to consult her first to make sure this isn't <br />
some kind of mistake...&quot;<br />
<br />
Gina's eyes went wide at the number. $10,000 for drinking a can of soda? So maybe it'd make her sick or <br />
something, it would be worth it. She promptly cracked the can open and took a swig, James looking at her in <br />
shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the- I just said I wanted to talk to Dr. Noriko first!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, calm down.&quot; Gina wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. &quot;It's just fruit punch. Nothing's gonna <br />
happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
As though fate were making fun of her, Gina's stomach began to hurt the second after she said that. Gina put <br />
one arm on her belly, discomfort clearly on her face. &quot;Gggg... ow... why does it hurt...?&quot; The can of Nature's <br />
Goodness was crushed in her hand as her body started tensing up. She stood up, hunched over for a few moments, <br />
before shooting straight up, changing in moments.<br />
<br />
The sleeves of Gina's shirt tore as her biceps expanded, thick veins popping up under her pale skin. Her <br />
shoulders did the same, bulking up and rounding out, tearing her shirt further. The front of her shirt tented <br />
forward, her previously modest chest swelling and bulging out obscenely, big boobs stretching her clothing <br />
even more, seams on the side groaning and snapping. Brick-like abs popped up along her stomach, her torso <br />
becoming thicker and more muscular. Her hips were next, swelling with muscle and fat, giving her powerhouse <br />
legs that tore the sides of her jeans. Her ass rounded out with athletic muscle, ripping the back of her jeans <br />
apart and showing her panties from behind. Gina's neck tensed and stretched wider and longer by several <br />
inches, big veins powerfully pumping blood to her head. As she grimaced in pain, her teeth grew sharper, <br />
changing into fangs, her canines growing longer than her other teeth and all of them becoming yellower, like <br />
an animal's. Her hands grew larger on the end of her bulkier arms, her fingers becoming thicker and pointier, <br />
her black polished nails turning harder and sharper, like claws. The same happened to her feet, long, pointy <br />
toes bursting out of her shoes, shredding her sneakers apart as the rest of her feet bulked up. Finally, black <br />
hair sprouted up on parts of her body: her muscular forearms and the tops of her much bigger hands; on her <br />
legs, mostly still covered by her pants, and huge feet; and her face, rugged sideburns growing down the sides <br />
and her eyebrows becoming bushy and wild, hair travelling down the back of her longer neck. And all this took <br />
place within five seconds.<br />
<br />
James took a step back, clearly shocked. Gina brought one huge hand to her forehead, feeling dazed. <br />
&quot;Rrrrwhat... happennnnd...?&quot; She said, unused to her new fangs. <br />
<br />
James, frightened, walked backwards. &quot;I-I-I don't know, this... I should go get Dr. Noriko... I'll be right <br />
back. Just... don't panic!&quot; He opened the door behind him and dashed out, slamming the door on his way out.<br />
<br />
Gina glanced at the door, one thick eyebrow raised. Why would she panic? Sure, she was in pain for a few <br />
seconds, and her head felt a little sore, but other than that, she felt fine. But it was odd how everything <br />
around her looked so much smaller... Curiously, she looked in her other hand at the can of Nature's Goodness, <br />
and how puny the crushed can looked in her thick, powerful hand...<br />
<br />
&quot;Rrrgh?!&quot; An involuntary growl came from her mouth as she realized something was wrong. Looking at her arms- <br />
they were huge! She did a bicep curl with one of them, and the muscle bunched and bulged incredibly big, <br />
bigger than any person she'd ever seen before. Looking down, her breasts had inflated much larger, from an A <br />
cup to what she could only guess was a D cup maybe larger- she didn't mind this part of her change. But <br />
looking past those, her entire body had bulked up, muscular abs exposed due to her shirt, barely hanging on, <br />
having been pulled up be her blown up torso. Gina rubbed a hand on on of her thighs, feeling the the hard bulk <br />
under the layer of soft padding; her legs must have grown longer, too, her jeans only going down to just past <br />
her knees now, her calves bulky and hairy. And she certainly noticed the hair on her arms and legs, though she <br />
couldn't see the hair on her face, nor could she see her sharper teeth or that her eyes had turned from green <br />
to orange. <br />
<br />
&quot;Rrwhat did that do to me?! I'm some kind of monsterrrrrr!&quot; Gina growled. She remembered what James had said: <br />
don't panic. She tried to remain calm, breathing in deep breaths, snapping a few more of the seams on her <br />
shirt due to her new big boobs. &quot;Calm down... You just turrrned into a seven-foot-tall hulk girrrrl... <br />
grrrr... rrrwhat do I do now...?&quot;</p>
