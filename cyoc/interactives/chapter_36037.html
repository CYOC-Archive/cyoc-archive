<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Max Biggermen: Biggermen in the woods<br />
<br />
By Alyn Roze <br />
<br />
<br />
Max and Jim stop just outside the Lifeguard station with their hands on each other ass. Everyone within sight looked on as the two muscular men went into a passionate embrace. After a few minutes of neck nuzzling and body exploring the two broke their embrace.<br />
<br />
“We seem to have an audience Max.” <br />
<br />
“Let them get their own Lifeguard.” Says Max as he kisses all around Jim’s neck. “This one is mine.”<br />
<br />
From the parking could be heard. “MOTOR FOUR ONE FROM BASE, MOTOR FOUR ONE FROM BASE.”  <br />
<br />
“I guess I should go answer that since I still am on duty.” Max says in between kisses. <br />
<br />
“Time for both of us to get back to work.” <br />
<br />
Max gives Jim a swat on the ass as the lifeguard heads back to his post. “I’ll expect you to be at my place at 9 sharp. If you ain't there I’m leavin without ya.”  <br />
<br />
He watched as the lifeguard’s swagger caused a rash of boners to appear on the surrounding guys. Max was not immune to Jim’s walk. The bulge in his black Speedos was getting heaver causing it to hang a bit lower. Max absentmindedly puts his hand inside and adjusts his package. He was about to pull out his cock when his radio went off again.<br />
<br />
“MOTOR FOUR ONE FROM BASE, MOTOR FOUR ONE FROM BASE.” <br />
<br />
“Damn it! That woman must have E.S.P. or sumpthin.” Max takes his hand out of his Speedos. “Every time I have my hands full she calls.”<br />
<br />
Max heads back to his ride and picks up the mic. “Right here Mabel, What’s up gorgeous?”<br />
<br />
“MAXWELL, WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? YOU HAVEN’T CHECKED IN FOR HOURS.”<br />
<br />
“I was out havin some fun my Magnolia blossom.”<br />
<br />
“ARE YOU HIDING IN THE TUNNEL AGAIN? YOU SOUND DIFFERENT. NEVER MIND THAT FOR NOW. FUN TIME IS OVER. THE SHERIFF WANTED YOU BACK AT THE STATION 30 MINUTES AGO.”<br />
<br />
“Don’t worry Mabel I’ll be back there before you can say Mint Julep.”<br />
<br />
Max reluctantly put his tight clothing back on and mounts his cycle. He always liked the open road. He jumped at the chance to be the townships first motorcycle cop. He would often hop on his Harley and just go crusin. His crusin didn’t always happen on his bike. When he was at the gym working to improve his body he was crusin. Any place there were guys he was crusin and the station was not the exception. A few minutes later he pulls into the parking lot and parks his cycle. <br />
<br />
The Mabel looks up from her desk just in time to see Max walk into the front office. She pauses for a moment as if she was getting ready to talk to a complete stranger then she speaks. &quot;It's about time you got here. The Sheriff is madder than a wet hen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's he so mad about?&quot; inquires Max. <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't tell me you were suppose to be going to the Police Academy graduation this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had other things on my mind.&quot; From behind his back Max produces a bouquet of flowers. <br />
<br />
The years of sitting behind a desk has taken its toll on her body. Although she would never admit she colors her hair to cover up the gray. Her skin was not as tight as it use to be. Try as she might to counteract with wrinkle cream at night she was beginning to show her age in her face. The push up bra she wore kept her breast from hanging like two half filled water balloons. Her weight gain wouldn't have been a problem if it hadn't centered on her hips and thighs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gorgeous you're looking better each day&quot;<br />
<br />
As Mabel reaches for the flowers Max takes one of her hands and kisses the top of it. She is startled by the sudden show of affection from Max. She was about to pull her hand away when she felt a wave of pleasure take over her body. But now things were tightening up and changing. Most of her gray was disappearing, her hips were thinning and her center of gravity changing.<br />
<br />
Max was about to give Mabel a kiss on the lips when the phone rang. Mabel, still looking deeply into Max's eyes, automatically reaches for the phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;De Soto County this is Mabel. How may I direct your call? She answers in somewhat of a trance. The caller’s response brings her back to the present. &quot;OK slow down there Rufus, Take a deep breath and start again. OK ... got it ... yeah ... ah huh ... I see ...  Now Rufus take it easy. ... Have you been taking your medication? ... OK Rufus I'll send Max, I mean Officer Biggermen, out there right away. ... Rufus? ... Rufus? ... Max, could you go out to Rufus’s place and calm him down. He's been a pain in the ass since his dog got run over. He said he’ll only talk to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;On my way.&quot; Max heads for the door. &quot;Have you decided about to night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK just this one time.&quot; Mabel replies. &quot;No pool hall this time. You are going to take me to the Orange Blossom Restaurant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for you Mabel.&quot;<br />
<br />
  <br />
<br />
Twenty minuets later Max arrives at a rundown travel trailer. An eclectic assortment of yard armaments decorated the yard. Under a big oak tree sits a seventy-year-old man rocking back and forth in a rocker. In his lap sets a double-barreled shotgun. <br />
<br />
The old man raises the gun in Max’s direction. “U bess be turning a round lessen U wanna belly full of buckshot young-n.”<br />
<br />
Max stops in his tracks and says “Now you put that shotgun away Rufus. It’s me Max.”<br />
<br />
“You don’t sound like Max.” Rufus still has his shotgun trained on Max. “Come closer young-n. These old eyes ain't as good as they use to be.”<br />
<br />
Max approached the old man with caution. The closer Max gets to Rufus the higher the shotgun gets to Max’s midsection.<br />
<br />
“That’s close e-nuff young-n.” Rufus squints a bit for a few seconds than a big smile appears on his face. “Max there you are. Where did that other young-n get to?”<br />
<br />
&quot;What's up old man? Fillin lonely again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It ain't been the same since you up and went off and joined the police department.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't stay here in woods all my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you still know how to find your way back home. Care to wet you whistle?&quot; Rufus picks up the gallon jug off the ground and pored some of its contents into a tin cup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you know that I can't be drinkin moon shine on duty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It ain't moon shine, it's just ice tea young-n.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max takes the cup from Rufus and takes a drink. Half way through the cup Max starts to choke.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I didn't use water. HAW! HAW! HAW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Max, still coughing, hands the cup back to Rufus. &quot;You trying to kill me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah just trying to have some fun with ya young-n.&quot; Rufus takes the cup back from Max and finishes off the remaining &quot;ice tea&quot;, downing it one gulp. The familiar warm feeling comes over Rufus but this time it feels ... different. A wave of energy flows through his old body. He begins to see things more clearly in the surrounding area. His hair starts to get darker and thicker. The wrinkles of age seam to be getting less visible as his skin begins to get tighter. In just the last few minutes of conversation with Max, Rufus has regressed in age 10 years.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey young-n? Care to arm wrestle?&quot; Rufus asks in a challenging manner as he puts his elbow on the nearby table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your on old man and don't think I'm gonna that it easy on ya.&quot; Max puts his elbow and grabs Rufus's hand.<br />
<br />
The two go at it for a few minutes. Rufus is trying with all his might to push Max's hand down. Max on the other hand wasn't even trying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know old man Ya aint gonna win without more muscle.&quot; Max says.<br />
<br />
The muscles in Rufus's arm began to ache. Slowly his arm began to swell. With every passing second it got bigger. The bigger his arm got the harder Rufus pushed. Max was finding it more difficult to resist Rufus's assault. In turn Max pushed back harder. The harder Max pushed the faster Rufus's muscles continued to grow. All the muscles swelled stretching the loose skin taught again. The years melted away regressing Rufus back to his early sixties then his fifties down to his forties. His back no longer slumped forward but straighten into a strong back. His flannel shirt stretch tight across his back as it became stronger and wider. His chest pushed the front of the shirt farther out. The top button popped off as Rufus's pecs bigger and wider. The top of the shirt parted exposing the cleavage between his huge pecs. <br />
<br />
Max could not believe much Rufus had improved over the last few months. The long training sessions have payed off. Max was having a hard time keeping the match at a stalemate. Why hadn't he noticed it before but Rufus is damn good looking. His goatee frames those gorgeous lips, that cute button nose and those deep blue eyes. Rufus was the best looking redneck in the county. Max reaches over with his free hand and pulls Rufus's head closer and closer until he was close enough to smell his breath. Then all of a sudden Max gives Rufus a full blown kiss on the lips. <br />
<br />
Rufus did resist at first but then released his grip on Max's hand and placed it behind his friends back. The arm wrestling match turned into a kissing match. For several minutes of kissing the two shared two more cups of the &quot;ice tea&quot; that Rufus had made. The one hundred and fifty proof  moonshine kicked the love fest to a higher level. <br />
<br />
Although Rufus had gained a substantial amount of muscle mass he didn't gain any height. At five foot two inches tall Rufus was just about half as wide as he was tall. He only came up to Max's chest in height but he was just as wide. <br />
<br />
Sitting in the middle of the yard were two muscle deep in the middle of oral sex. The smaller one sat on the lap of the bigger one like a ventriloquist's dummy. Max didn't have his hand up the &quot;dummy's&quot; back but down the front of his tight blue jeans. The jeans that Rufus wore had started out loose this morning were now form fitting. Their seam were close to splitting but held together by some miracle. The bulge in the front was as big as Max's hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this this what you had in mind when you called me out here?&quot; Max asks Rufus.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know how I miss our little wrestling matches we had at the station before I retired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I miss em too Sargent SIR!&quot; Replies Max giving Rufus a salute. &quot;Their almost as much as our &quot;hunting&quot; trips.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When are we going to go &quot;huntin&quot; again Max?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to go out of town this week end.&quot; Max says in between kisses. &quot;How about next week end?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a date. Don't forget your &quot;huntin&quot; gear.&quot; Rufus climbs off of Max's lap. &quot;The workout pit at the beach is no place for cycle booths and sidearms.&quot;</p>
