<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elisabeth watched kids come into the card shop to get new Fighters from the display case. She was afraid that one of them would buy her before Kathy could. Fortunately their parents had refused to buy her since she was a convict. It was a few hours before Kathy and her mom finally came in. She wanted to get their attention but she couldn't. Kathy looked at all the cards carefully and soon came to her.<br />
 <br />
Once Kathy saw Elisabeth she said &quot;I found her Mom!&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Elisabeth's mom said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;I'm sure&quot; Kathy said. &quot;She looks like me and the card does say that her name is Elisabeth.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well if you're sure we'll buy her&quot; Elisabeth's mom said.<br />
 <br />
Kathy bought Elisabeth and a few card packs. When they got home Kathy took Elisabeth up to her room. She picked her up and said &quot;I know that's you Rick, or should I say Elisabeth. It's going to be so much fun having a sister my age. Now I just need to summon you. How did that go again? Oh, I remember. I summon you Elisabeth.&quot;<br />
 <br />
As Kathy spoke she turned Elisabeth around so she was facing away from her. There was a flash of light like when Elisabeth was transformed into a Fighter. She felt herself jerked forward and it felt like she was being inflated. She found that she could breath again. When the light faded she found that she was facing the same direction that Kathy had faced her. She turned around and smiled.<br />
 <br />
Kathy returned Elisabeth's smile and said &quot;It's great to have you back. Mom and Dad will be so happy. How do you feel?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I feel pretty good now&quot; Elisabeth said. &quot;Though it's a strange feeling being a girl. Though I guess I'll get used to it.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Just then Elisabeth's mom came in and said &quot;Is that you Rick?&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;It's Elisabeth now Mom&quot; Elisabeth said.<br />
 <br />
Elisabeth's mom embraced her new daughter in a tight hug as if she was afraid that she might lose her again. &quot;I'm so glad that we have you back. Even if it's in this form. We'll adjust to this. I'm going to in make your favorite for dinner. It will be done in about an hour. I want you girls to be ready by then. David's coming by for dinner. He wants to see you in your new body. That reminds me. Kathy, would you help Elisabeth get her clothes off and check the sizes. If the clothes don't have sizes on them take her measurements.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ok Mom&quot; Kathy said as her mom left. She turned back to Elisabeth and said &quot;Ok, let's get your clothes off.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Elisabeth looked horror stricken and said &quot;I can't take my clothes off.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; Kathy said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Because you'll see me naked&quot; Elisabeth said.<br />
 <br />
Kathy giggled and said &quot;You're a girl now. You don't have anything that I don't have myself.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Elisabeth sighed and said &quot;You're right about that. I forgot that I'm a girl now for a few seconds. I guess a part of me still sees myself as your older brother. I would never have gotten naked in front of you before.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I know&quot; Kathy said. &quot;I also know that you wouldn't do that with any 13 year old girl. But that was then and this is now so strip.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well ok, but you need to help me&quot; Elisabeth said. &quot;I'm still new to being a girl after all. Though I don't see why you need to know what size my clothes are.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;It should be obvious&quot; Kathy said. &quot;You'll need more clothes than what you're wearing.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;I don't think I can wear anything but what I have on now&quot; Elisabeth said. &quot;I don't know if I can even take off my clothes.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;You can&quot; Kathy said. &quot;I've done research on Card Fighters since you were found guilty. A summoned Fighter is basically a person again. This means that you can take off your clothes. It also means that you can eat, drink, and go to the bathroom.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Well I was wondering why Mom had told me to be ready for dinner&quot; Elisabeth said. &quot;Though I still don't see what getting me new clothes will accomplish. It's not like I can wear new clothes now that I'm a Fighter.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;That's where you're wrong&quot; Kathy said. &quot;Any clothes you wear will transform with you like the clothes you were wearing before did. That is if I return you to card form. I'll have to in order for me to take you to school.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;So I can wear different clothes&quot; Elisabeth said to herself. &quot;Ok, help me take off my clothes here.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Kathy helped Elisabeth take off her clothes. While Kathy was checking the sizes and writing them down Elisabeth looked at herself in her sister's mirror. Her skin was pretty fair now unlike what it was when she was male. Her hair had turned from brown to blond. Her dad and David have brown hair while her mom and Kathy have blond hair. She saw that she had a slight hourglass shape. Her whole body was much more slender now than it had ever been when she was male. The strangest sight to her was something she couldn't see. There was no penis between her legs now. Instead she had a pussy there now. As she looked at herself she had to admit that she was hot. Any red blooded American boy would die to be with her. That thought led to a question about her sexuality. Was she going to be into boys now?Would she even be able to have a boyfriend? She didn't know much about Fighters but she did know that they didn't age. Maybe if she found a Fighter that she liked it wouldn't be an issue. She thought of Kathy's boyfriend Tom. He was an Owner and she had seen his Fighter. Tom's Fighter was make and about 13 too. At the thought of Tom's Fighter Elisabeth felt herself get wet. It was an odd feeling. There was a warmth spreading from that area that she never got when she was male. It was also throbbing down there, almost like she was getting hard. The wetness reminded her of precum which was probably what it was now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that answers that question&quot; Elisabeth said.<br />
 <br />
&quot;What answers what?&quot; Kathy said.<br />
 <br />
Elisabeth blushed and said &quot;I was just wondering if I would like boys now. It looks like I do since my body is reacting to an image of a any I have in my head.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Welcome to being a girl&quot; Kathy said. &quot;Come on and I'll help you get dressed. Then we can go get dinner. Oh by the way, you'll be sleeping with me since Mom has turned your old room into an office.&quot;</p>
