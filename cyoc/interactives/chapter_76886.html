<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mitch hardly knew why he did it. The strain of living three different lives in one day was starting to play with his emotions. Sean’s brother Brandon had walked into the room and started when he saw the beautiful Shelly sitting at the kitchen table. Mitch had wanted to tell Brandon, his friend, about what had been happening to him, about what Mitch was doing to him. But he couldn’t.<br />
<br />
He wanted to reach out to his friend for help, but the only thing his body would do was run up to the stud and kiss him full on the mouth. Brandon was taken aback, but didn’t mind all that much. The pretty girl stared into his eyes hopefully, he put his hands on her delicate waist and pulled her back a bit.<br />
<br />
“Umm, yeah, who are you? What are you doing in my house?”<br />
<br />
Mitch cringed inside as he stared up into the eyes of his best friend, whose broad shoulder had just enveloped him a moment ago. <br />
<br />
“My name is Shelly, please you have to believe me!” Then she lunged up for another kiss. Dammit! That wasn’t what was supposed to happen, but Mitch couldn’t break the kiss, especially as he felt a strong arm wrap around his waist, a hand gently perched at the top of his butt. Brandon was getting into the kiss a bit more this time, his tongue playing into the mysterious woman’s mouth. He placed a thumb on her chin and gently tipped their lips apart.<br />
<br />
“Heh, I believe you! I believe you! But, uh, Shelly, why are you in my house?” He’d been thrilled at the play that had been happening here, but looking into Shelly’s eyes now, she seemed… less appealing somehow.<br />
<br />
“No! My name is Shelly! I… I’m your brother’s”<br />
<br />
“Girlfriend? Well… I ….” Brandon’s arms slid higher up the woman’s body and he pushed her to a distance. “I guess you probably shouldn’t be kissing me then!”<br />
<br />
Sean had a girlfriend. That felt odd for Brandon. Just thinking about Sean made him feel… warm. Sean was a stud, he had never considered that before. He deserved a beautiful woman to service his needs.<br />
<br />
Mitch whimpered. The only kind of contact he could make with Brandon was intimate! Kissing! Holding! Still he needed something. He dashed in to embrace the huge basketball star again, to feel those hands all over his body. Brandon pushed him away “Hey now! Does my brother know you’re this horny all the time!”<br />
<br />
“It’s not what you think! I’m not horny… he made me this horny”<br />
<br />
“Woo, kinky… heh. Umm. Probably more than I need to know” But now Brandon was thinking, he was pretty horny too. The woman in front of him now held no appeal. Brandon had never really thought about it before, but Sean made him horny as hell. He pictured this woman servicing his stud little brother, and then replaced her with himself. Sean deserved somebody with real talent, that somebody could be him. These were strange thoughts! But the more he thought about them, the more Brandon wanted Sean to come home and pound him rather than this faithless Shelly bimbo. <br />
<br />
“Shelly why don’t you go home. We’ll just forget what happened here, but I can’t have you in the house right now.”<br />
<br />
“But, but!” Brandon gently pushed her by her shoulders out the door, slammed it and locked it.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Keith’s tiny shorts were becoming tight. Every time he looked down at the youthful Sean next to him, he imagined how it’d be if their positions were reversed, and Sean was staring down at him while Keith  sucked  his cock or took it up his ass. His wrist was shoved hard into his erection to keep Sean from noticing his tent.<br />
<br />
Sean had noticed a long time ago however, and was enjoying watching Keith squirm. A few minutes ago he had been a confident macho stud walking his dog in the park, now he demurred and blushed as he looked at Sean, laughing loudly at his jokes and scooting closer inch by inch. Jack Hammer had been watching Keith strangely throughout the encounter and, smelling his master’s arousal, buried his nose in Keith’s crotch.<br />
<br />
Keith started and his enormous boner sprung free. He quickly lunged forward to try to hide it, but the tight running shorts left nothing to the imagination. He hemmed and hawed trying to produce an excuse when Sean reached out and laid a hand on his abs, gently pushing him back into the park bench so that his erection pointed straight up. Keith froze at the touch, his dick throbbing at the contact from this youthful top.<br />
<br />
“Well well well, Keith. Looks like you got a little excited talking about all this fucking.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah. I guess I did” Keith couldn’t pull his eyes away from Sean’s, even though he knew it was literally making his dick twitch visibly in his shorts. They were in a public park, surely everyone would see! “Sorry.”<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize. It’s gotten me riled up to.” He momentarily cupped his own crotch, making Keith swallow a moan. “Keith, I want to go back to your place and have a little fun with you, what do you say?”<br />
<br />
Keith was totally smitten by Sean by now. He was picturing the youngster naked, imagining what his skin would feel like, how his cock would taste. Was picturing himself in all sorts of positions, even some kinky ones he never would’ve conceived of before with his fianc&eacute;.<br />
<br />
“R-really? You want to go back to my house? And?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t keep me waiting, Keith”<br />
<br />
“Right! I live real close and my fianc&eacute; isn’t home this week—“ Keith started to bolt up, his wrist pressing back down on his erection to hide it from those walking past<br />
<br />
“First, give me a kiss, Keith” <br />
<br />
People were walking past, occasionally someone would look over at him: the tall muscular dude wearing nothing but tiny shorts, walking an excitable golden retriever. He leaned in slowly. Sean didn’t make a move. With a whimper Keith had to lean all the way in and press his lips into Sean’s. He felt weak in the knees.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
By the time they got back to Keith’s house, the big man was practically shivering. Sean couldn’t believe how well it had worked, after sharing a lingering kiss with the formerly straight stud  in the middle of a public park, Sean was sure he could do anything with the hunk.<br />
<br />
Loosely, he wondered why he hadn’t thought to use Mitch in this way before now. Or, hell, he could easily make Mitch his devoted love slave. Maybe a three-way wouldn’t be so bad? Or, he imagined with a grin as he watched Keith’s tight ass bounce in his shorts as he mounted the last few steps, imagine what I could change about myself with a little kiss from a retrofitted Mitch?<br />
<br />
Keith let Jack Hammer off the leash and he trotted to his bed in the corner of the kitchen. When Keith turned around the young stud he wanted to surrender to was standing right up against him.<br />
<br />
“So… what did you want to do… Sean?” Keith trembled as the Sean placed a hand on his chest.<br />
<br />
“Well eventually…” Sean smiled up at the quivering hunk, loving the look of absolute longing in his eyes “I want to give Jack Hammer over there some pointers.” Keith whimpered and fell into Sean’s embrace. They kissed for what seemed like forever, Sean loving the feel of Keith’s big cock rubbing into his stomach, and loving how Keith humped his thigh into Sean’s own straining dick. The big man was putty, so needing to be fucked but so focused on pleasing his younger lover.<br />
<br />
“Keith, baby, it would make me so happy if you would dance for me”<br />
<br />
Keith moved back breathlessly as Sean pulled out a kitchen chair, sitting and staring at the trembling muscle-jock. Sean’s legs were spread wide, his erection evident in his jeans. Keith fought the urge to straddle Sean immediately in a needy lap-dance. He closed his eyes and began to sway.<br />
<br />
Sean could still hardly believe it as the stud started running his hand all over the tight contours of his body, making great circles with his hips before his ripped abs pulsed as he thrust his ass up into the air in a repeated motion. He worked himself into a rapture, moaning and he ran his hands over his chest gently pinching his nipples with every pass. It was a play by play of how to drive him wild when Sean was taking him from behind.<br />
<br />
Keith had never felt his body like this, somehow, trying to get Sean hot for him had made him feel really sexy, and he did his best to show it off. He felt his dick head rub the nylon in his shorts as he moved around. Opening his eyes he noticed Sean sitting there, his pants unzipped and his proud cock standing at attention as Sean slowly worked it over, watching his lover gyrate for his pleasure.<br />
<br />
Keith froze mid grunt to stare, and Sean beckoned him over, standing to meet him in a kiss. This time, as Sean’s tongue entered his mouth, the hard cock pressing into his thigh was hot and smooth, and left a trail of pre-cum on his bare legs. The teen’s hands slid down his sides and slipped into his tiny shorts, pulling them down, caressing his naked ass, finally a firm hand gripped his cock. Keith gasped into his lover’s mouth.<br />
<br />
Sean sat back in the chair and told Keith to kneel. Keith stepped out of his abused running shorts and kneeled between Sean’s legs. Sean’s cock was perfect, it looked so good, so inviting. Keith had never felt such a strong desire for anyone.<br />
<br />
“I want you to suck my dick. I want you to show me that you really really want me to fuck you”<br />
<br />
Keith practically giggled with excitement and took the young teen’s dick straight into his mouth, working it up and down, lavishing it with his tongue, and always trying to take it further and further into his unpracticed throat. <br />
<br />
Sean thought the sensation was incredible. The big stud’s hot mouth was completely occupied with pleasing his young master’s dick. Every time Sean bottomed out in the back of the stud’s throat, he felt the deep rumble of Keith’s needy moan.<br />
<br />
“Look at me while you suck me”<br />
<br />
Keith stared up the youth’s body into his eyes, so full of possessive lust. This was better, this was the view he had imagined back on the park bench: looking UP at Sean. He didn’t dare take the cock out of his mouth to tell Sean how right this felt, but he doubled his efforts sucking on that dick to say it for him. After a few minutes Sean pulled him off and leaned down to kiss him. This was ecstasy for both of them, Keith being the one who had to strain to lean up into the kiss, Sean’s hand behind his head, holding him in place.<br />
<br />
“Go face the wall, hands over your head” Reluctantly, Keith rose to his full height and leaned into the wall, his legs spread. “Flex your ass for me, show me where you want me to fuck you” Keith stuck out his ass as far as he could, then flexed and unflexed it, his hips swaying back and forth with the force. He felt young hands on his ass cheeks, testing their strength, taking in their size, pulling them apart. He jolted when he felt a sharp slap on his ass, thought he would cum right there.<br />
<br />
“Take me to the bedroom, Keith.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Brandon was going out of his mind, he had closed all the blinds and was now sitting in the living room in just his boxers. He had tried watching TV, but his mind kept going back to his sexy brother. He was convinced that Sean was about the hottest stud he was ever going to meet, and his brother needed someone to fuck. Brandon needed that fuck. His cock was drillbit hard as he sat on the sofa slowly jacking himself.<br />
<br />
He didn’t know when his brother would be home. He tried calling him, begging him to come back early, but there had been no answer. He stared into the blank tv set, afraid to really go to town on his cock for want of saving himself.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Brandon stood up and went up the stairs. For the first time in years, he walked into Sean’s bedroom. The scent of the team immediately overwhelmed him, and he felt his dick throb. This was the stud’s room, where his brother slept, got naked, jacked off, probably where he fucked Shelly too. Brandon felt a giddy rush, like the mere fact of standing in this room was too much to take. He slipped out of his boxers, his dick leading the way deeper into the sunlit room. He opened a few of Sean’s drawers, his breath quickening as he looked at all his brothers clothes. Then his heart skipped a beat when he saw the hamper in the corner.<br />
<br />
Digging both hands in, he brought out a pair of Sean’s underwear, pressed them into his face, rubbed them down his body. Clutching them to himself, he turned to the bed. It was neatly made, the pillow still dinted from where his brothers head lay. This was where his brother slept, acted out his sexual fantasies, made his conquests. Feeling a surge of transgressive glee, Brandon peeled back the neatly made sheets and slid his naked body into the bed. The warmth, the scent-a mix of teen musk and some trendy deodorant, the fabric of his brother’s underwear in his face, made him feel like he was being held by his brother. <br />
<br />
What if he just waited he re for his brother? This is where he would beg Sean to fuck his brains out.<br />
<br />
<br />
“Aww! Fuck me Sean! Please, fuck me hard!”<br />
<br />
“Take this cock baby, make me proud! Flex that ass for me sweetie”<br />
<br />
Keith’s face was pressed into his bed as his young lover plowed him with his cock. It was beyond any feeling Keith had ever felt before. With his fianc&eacute; he had always pounded her as hard as he could, feeling like a real man if he could plow her harder than she could take. Now he felt himself pushed to that same limit, where the force of Sean’s fucking into his tight hole was almost more pleasure than he could bare. <br />
<br />
“This feels so right Sean! Fuck my ass! Top me stud! You feel so incredible inside me!”<br />
<br />
He pushed himself up to give Sean a different angle on his ass and moaned. Sean had set him up so that they were staring right into the bedroom mirror. The sight of his sweaty body on the bed on all fours, a naked teen standing behind him taking his ass was almost more than he could take. His dick had been straining to shoot it’s load for almost an hour.<br />
<br />
Sean couldn’t believe he was losing his virginity fucking this perfect stud. Keith wanted him in every way, and Sean knew from the virus that he would never have better sex than he got from his fuckings with Sean. He slapped the muscular ass he was ravaging and leaned over the moaning stud. His hands finding his bottom’s nipples, following the road map Keith had laid out for him earlier, driving the big hunk crazy. <br />
<br />
Sean heard a jingle at the door to the bedroom and saw Jack Hammer come trotting in, tongue lolling as he watched the scene before him. Sean laid a kiss on Keith’s neck and growled into his ear.<br />
<br />
“Look who’s here? Jack Hammer’s come to watch his master get topped! What do you think about that?”<br />
<br />
“Oh god!” Keith cried, burying his face in the covers again, looking up to see his golden retriever watch him bottom for the younger man.<br />
<br />
“He recognizes the new alpha of the pack now, y’think?” Sean nibbled at Keith’s ear, thrusting extra hard and giving Keith’s nipple a tug.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah!”<br />
<br />
“Looks like I’m fucking you about as hard as Jack Hammer there fucked my bitch Michelle. Guess that makes you my bitch, huh baby?”<br />
<br />
Keith could only whimper<br />
<br />
“Jack Hammer recognizes it, when an alpha stud breeds his bitch, he knows what he’s seeing. Why don’t you show him how much you want it? Prove you’re in heat.”<br />
<br />
It took all of Keith’s energy to start humping back into the cock thrusting into his ass. But he did want to prove it, wanted to show his dog that there was a new alpha around. Wanted to prove to Sean that he could be a good bitch.<br />
<br />
“I want to see your face while I fuck you, turn over”<br />
<br />
It didn’t take long for Sean to plunge back in, this time pounding Keith from a whole new angle. The stud’s stubble-filled chest was covered in sweat, and little tear trails poured down his face. Slowing his pace, Sean kissed his way up the studs chest and locked his mouth in a deep kiss.<br />
<br />
“You love this, don’t you?<br />
<br />
“Aww, yes Sean. Fuck me. I love having you inside me, I want you to teach me how to be your bitch”<br />
<br />
<br />
Mitch had wandered about the park looking for Sean after having been exiled from Brandon’s presence, finally he had just decided to go home, sneaking in the back door as Shelly. He hadn’t stayed in a body this different for so long, he was being overcome by the urges this body had. He couldn’t stop thinking about his encounter with Brandon, and how he had really longed for every kiss. <br />
He hoped that Sean would reveal himself soon and change him back… into ANYTHING else.</p>
