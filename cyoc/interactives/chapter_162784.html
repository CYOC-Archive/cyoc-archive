<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;W-What&#39;s go-wing to haben now?&quot; Mike uttered struggling with his reduced motor skills and more complex emotions than his 3 year old brain was developed enough to process...<br />
<br />
&quot;An awful lot...&quot; Jeff replied sitting down at the computer with a sigh and began typing away. &quot;I get it, you want a break, but I&#39;m not okay with being erased from existence, so we are at an impasse unless one of us gives. If I turn you back, you will just call in to work and do it while I&#39;m at school, disabling the warnings that saved me, and I&#39;ll disappear. So first, you will never remember the Chronivac exists no matter how many times you see it, or have it explained to you, you will forget it before you can think about using it and if you come across the program you will minimize it without changing any settings.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike dropped his eyes toward the floor and fought back tears, &quot;I u-u-un-dow-stand Yeff. I&#39;m sowwy...&quot; Big droplets were streaming down Mike&#39;s face but he was holding back the sobbing although he couldn&#39;t stop the tears, he knew his change was coming up next.<br />
<br />
Jeff went back to typing and set up the details for the next set of changes before turning to Mike and explaining what he was doing. &quot;I can&#39;t promise you forever, but honestly I&#39;m guessing that I&#39;m over high school about as much as you were over being an adult. I&#39;ll try being your dad. It will be really weird for me and I had to build a history for myself and us, but I set up some settings to help with that. I should have 3 years of fatherhood experience, and even more of work experience, so when I do an adult or fatherly thing, it will feel natural from that point on. Likewise for you, you will quickly get to a state where acting and thinking like a toddler is natural and only in an emergency will you be able to think like an adult.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike looked up at his son speechless, tears continued to stream down his face but they were tears of joy. all he could do was nod in agreement and smile his cute three year old smile. <br />
<br />
Jeff smiled and continued. &quot;The first time I start to grab the diaper, or make you food, or do our laundry, or go to work, it will feel natural to me... this way I don&#39;t mess everything up or get us killed on day one. Also, the only time you will age is when I&#39;m over 45, I die, or I have been in a steady relationship with a girl more than 2 years. Besides that you will stay 3 and reality will always match your age. Oh, and if I was in a relationship but it ended and I&#39;m under 45, you will revert back to 3. If this gets to be too much for me, we will have to revisit the plan, but what do you say? Should we give it a shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Mike cried out with the exuberance only a toddler could muster... Jeff reached over and pressed the enter key and a flash burst from the emitter. Jeff looked around his room as everything began to rearrange itself turning into little Mikey&#39;s room. The tv and game console became a mounted TV out of the toddlers reach, Shelving appeared across the room for the same purpose, Mike blinked a few times and followed Jeff&#39;s gaze to watch in wonder as Jeff&#39;s toys changed into toddler toys, clothes became appropriate for Mike and furniture became a changing table, dresser, and crib.<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up to marvel at the situation and the chair and desk along with its contents were teleported out of the baby&#39;s room. With that it was all done. Mike looked up seeing a man where his son stood just a moment ago. &quot;Oh my Gowd, Yeff! Is dat you? Wha happen heow?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff looked down confused for a moment, but then Jeff realized. Of course, Mike couldn&#39;t remember anything about the Chronivac so from his perspective, everything that brought them to this, didn&#39;t happen. How to explain?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you found a way to be a child again. But you did it in a way that hurt other people, so I stepped in and agreed to be your Daddy for as long as I could, to keep people from being hurt. Part of your punishment from hurting people is that you don&#39;t get to remember what you did or how you did it. You need to remember to make good choices buddy.&quot; As soon as Jeff started simplifying things to Mike it all just flowed out naturally as a toddler sized life lesson.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You can&#39;t be my dad, you don&#39;t know the first ting about taking care of a house let alone a chi-owld! We has to fix dis!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s all right dad, not even 2 minutes ago you agreed that this was a good solution. If I give up on this Ill turn us both back but I&#39;m not just doing it for you, we&#39;re both getting something out of this. As for knowledge, just starting to do something I should know as your parent, I will know how to do it like I&#39;ve been doing it since I should/would have, in your case that&#39;s the last three years. For my job that would probably go back a decade, and the rest of adulthood things will apply as they apply.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike didn&#39;t look convinced. Jeff decided that it might just be easier to get him to play along and let the normalization process do its thing. &quot;How about you and I take a look at ourselves in the mirror, I know I&#39;m eager to get a look.&quot; Jeff reached down and picked Mike up, Mike immediately felt comfortable being held by Jeff as though it happens every day. Going to the bathroom Jeff sees what he looks like for the first time. Though a young and handsome 25 year old, he needed a haircut or at the very least a comb, and could use some trimming up of his beard, if you could call it that. It was at an ugly place between beard and stubble and along with the hair he looked the part of a single father. He had gained a good deal of muscle but quick fast-food stops between work and picking up the kid had taken a toll.<br />
<br />
Mike buried his face into Jeff&#39;s shoulder after glancing in the mirror, Jeff instinctively knew that toddler Mike was happily overwhelmed and this was how he knew how to express it. &quot;Oh yeah buddy? You like that don&#39;t you?&quot; Jeff used his free hand to rub his son&#39;s back to comfort him. &quot;Yeah, I know. It&#39;s a lot but you&#39;re happy. Let&#39;s get you some food and test out my new superpowers!&quot; <br />
<br />
Jeff decided to be playful with his son on the way to the kitchen, making them both feel comfortable playing as Father and Son would. Jeff knew it was a very short matter of time before Mike fully fell into his role as a child, Jeff&#39;s mental changes were not quite as complete as Mikes, only because he wanted to make sure he was enjoying his life as he was giving up a decade for this.</p>
