<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick hit the sack earlier and dreamt of the hunt.She was a catlizard thing,and rejoiced as she <br />
reached in with her paws and tore out her preys beating heart.Just as the bloody morsel quivered<br />
on her tongue..... <br />
<br />
the dream ended.It was midnight and Rick went into the living room and idly <br />
noted he must have forgotten to log out of the Monsters R Us site and turn off the computer.<br />
<br />
           He ignored the invitation and went back to sleep.The dreams returned and Sadie joyfuy burnt<br />
off her mysterious Uncle Ricks ineritance on stockings,parties and carnal pleasure.She calmed her <br />
parents fears and before the dream faded away thanked Uncle Rick for providing for her.<br />
<br />
The next morning he didn't even bother showing up for work but instead set his affairs in order.The <br />
previous nights dream had plenty of hints,and he prepared things for his rebirth as Rickietta.Then he <br />
returned to a house he doubted would still be in his name by the end of the week.<br />
<br />
                  He was taking a bath at noon when the surge of changing heat slammed him to the bottom of <br />
the tub.His screams of pain rose in pitch,blood oozed out between his legs and he felt the worms writh<br />
about in his chest this time.Then it was done and he watched while the shower of water passed through <br />
his head and bounced off some point in his neck.The water sprayed off invisible mammaries he could<br />
not see and off a narrowed waist and rounded hips he could not touch.<br />
<br />
And this time when he spoke,it was Sadies voice he heard with his ears.He felt at the two swelling <br />
bumps on his chest and the tear of skin forming behind his scrotum.The changes were physical <br />
now and Rick confirmed it when he tried to write a last will and testment.His writing was no longer his <br />
own.Suddenly he had acquired the ability to write in a flowery decorative style rather then the plodding<br />
writing style he'd had for nearly thirty years.<br />
<br />
Before he turned in he made a last check of his email .The system kept telling him that there was no <br />
email for a Rick P__.This user was unknown.On a hunch he tried that for Rickietta P__ and was <br />
flipping through her account when he noticed that someone else seemed to have already logged into<br />
her private mail account.<br />
<br />
               The only person he'd divulged any of his internet activities to was his dad.Was it possible his<br />
parents had logged into their emerging daughters private mail?Rick shrugged off the idea as unlikely.<br />
Why would they show more interest in her private affairs then that of their soon  nonexisten son Rick?<br />
<br />
          He felt tired and hit the sack early.When the inevitable midnight waking came,he just ignored the <br />
humming computer he could hear in the other room.He just turned over and soon Sadie was sashaying <br />
about in a dream dress in the Orleans french quarter,winking and laughing as she strung the boys along.<br />
<br />
             All through the nght Mr P__ worked the phones and the internet,slowly tracing down the phone<br />
line from where their cursed daughter Rickietta had accessed the internet from.The police had been of <br />
no help and the concerned parents weren't about to tell them the real reason they were concerned about <br />
their missing youngest daughter.<br />
<br />
           Ever since they had taken Rickietta to a cavern once used by native american medicine men  <br />
they're life had been a living hell.Little eight year old Rickietta had run deep into the cavern despite <br />
their warning cries.When the bestial roars and their young daughters screams<br />
 rose up to them at the same time<br />
they had expected to find her mangled corpse.As it was,they had to settle for a scratched,bloodied and <br />
sobbing Rickietta.<br />
<br />
            She had been such a sweet child before,but after she had been released from the hospital they<br />
had noticed her change in personality.Once a sweet girl who would never harm a fly,she had taken to <br />
dropping toads in bowls of rubbing alcohol,beheading mice and setting Have A Hart traps to catch<br />
stray cats.She then would leave the trapped animals to slowly die in the cages of hunger and thirst.<br />
<br />
            They knew all about the evil beast that had entered her that night in the cavern.They knew about<br />
her sadistic ways and her abnormal sexual drive and power.And they knew about her secret internet <br />
identity as sadie_sicklove.<br />
<br />
            The next morning Rick woke up bursting with energy.He got up and stretched out his arms and <br />
the sigh which came out of his mouth was a feminine one of ecstasy.He saw his female counterpart in <br />
the full length mirror beside the bed and twisted and turned and displayed herself in all her glory.He felt<br />
a throbbing between his legs and felt down behind his manhood.The cleft he found there had continued <br />
to deepen overnight.<br />
<br />
        Puzlingly however the swelling bumps on his chest had shrunk and he now had two baggy folds of<br />
skin where his forming bosom had been.He got dressed and had breakfast.Afterwards he called his<br />
parents number but no one answered the phone.He had planned to reassure them that their daughter<br />
was alright,but it looked like that would have to wait.<br />
<br />
        The smell in the house was starting to become unbearable,and since it might be coming from his <br />
altering body,decided to take a shower.When the power and the pain hit,it was noon,and he waited <br />
for it to end and be done with its daily changes.<br />
<br />
            Then she screeched in time to her pulsing hips as they widened,the sound of tearing flesh <br />
exposing her womanhood.As she collapsed to the bottom of the tub the top of her bloody scalp<br />
fell to the reddening stream of water as a massive head of silky black hair thrust it aside.Her<br />
skull began to crunch and snap and skin  and muscle and fat were violently rearranged.<br />
<br />
            The baggy folds of skin on her skin stretched and firmed as her nipples seemed to distort and <br />
reform.Blood was everywhere,gushing out from the newformed hole between her legs.As it flooded <br />
down the drain her body lightened and bones were squeezed into a more slender form.Her waist <br />
constricted and she gasped for breath as her insides were remolded and healed.<br />
<br />
            Slowly the moans and the pain died away and the young woman began to shudder as she <br />
realized this was just the end of the beginning.She let the shower continue to cleanse her blood soaked <br />
body and slowly moved tired aching limbs to seat herself better in the tub.<br />
<br />
      When the hand appeared and thrust the needle into her arm,she was greatly surprised.</p>
