<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny couldn&#39;t quite make up his mind. He toyed with the idea of making all the racist jerks at school even wimpier than his brother, or changing himself up a bit, but he just couldn&#39;t get himself to commit to one idea. In the end, he spent the night the way he usually did: he glanced over his homework, decided to ignore half of it, did a few dozen pushups, and jacked off a few times until he fell asleep with his hand still wrapped around his thick asian cock. As he drifted off to sleep, he found himself thinking that, really, his life wasn&#39;t so bad. Hot girlfriend, killer bod, lots of friends...did he really care if they called him a chink or whatever behind his back?<br />
<br />
The next day, he&#39;d find out he did after all.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
The morning went by as usual. Danny jeered a bit at Jin when he saw him playing sudoku over breakfast like some kind of super nerd, but he laughed it off even as his brother glared at him, and headed off to school. He got on the bus, made out with Sasha a bit in the back row, and started first period with nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
The problems started during second period. Danny&#39;s second class of the day was calculus, which he&#39;d only barely gotten into after his dad forced him to let Jin tutor him before his precalc finals. Danny couldn&#39;t care less. As far as he was concerned, he was going to get a football scholarship or some shit and never have to think about &quot;variables&quot; ever again. So far this semester he&#39;d mostly just dozed off during the class, but today he had other plans. Sasha always had a free period this time of day, and he figured he&#39;d surprise her. Maybe they could sneak off to the janitorial closet they&#39;d found last year and do some &quot;extra credit.&quot;<br />
<br />
The problem was, Sasha was nowhere to be found. He checked all her usual hangout and study spots, but no luck. Twenty minutes into skipping class, he was starting to get nervous. Was she okay? He&#39;d seen her earlier that morning...<br />
Then, he got an idea in his head. Maybe she&#39;d gotten the same idea he had. Maybe she was waiting for him in their usual hookup spot. The thought sent a pulse through his dick, and he grinned, adjusting it in his jeans and rolling his shoulders back, straightening his posture to look good for his girl. With a swagger in his step, he strode across campus and headed for the closet.<br />
<br />
When he got there, he paused in front of the door. Nobody ever came around this part of school during the day, but he could swear he heard noises coming from inside. Was some other couple using his and Sasha&#39;s spot. Scowling, he reached forward and yanked the door open. He&#39;d claimed this spot last year, and he wasn&#39;t going to let some white jerk take it for himself. He opened his mouth to scare whoever the couple was off, but, as the light from the hallway shone into the closet, he froze.<br />
<br />
Sasha was on her knees, moaning and gyrating as a familiar white jock held her by the hair and thrust into her throat. For a moment the two didn&#39;t even notice Danny staring at them, too overwhelmed by lust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck, yeah baby...take my dick you bitch,&quot; the jock growled, and Danny recognized the voice.<br />
<br />
Jackson White. Danny&#39;s best friend since sophomore year, and he was grabbing *his* girlfriend and riding her like a fucking sex doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the fuck out,&quot; he shouted, blood turning to ice as he slammed the door all the way open against the outside wall.<br />
<br />
Jackson jumped, hurriedly yanking his pants back up before he even had a chance to register who had caught him. Sasha noticed, though. She turned to him, eyes wide with shock and panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...Danny, it&#39;s not what it seems like, I promise,&quot; she said, struggling to stand.<br />
<br />
Danny wanted to believe her. But, staring at her wiping precum off her lips as his best friend zipped up his fly, all he could feel was anger and betrayal.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t even want to talk to you, get the fuck out of here and hope you don&#39;t see me until I calm down,&quot; he growled, clenching his fists until the muscles in his arms ripples and flexed. He was shaking a bit, he realized, but he didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
Sasha nodded, eyes wide, and ran out of the closet and down the hall. Danny turned to glare at Jackson then, and the white jock returned his gaze with a cool sneer of his own.<br />
<br />
&quot;You really think this is the first time that little bitch of yours whored herself out for someone else? Please, Danny. Don&#39;t be an idiot. A fucking yellow boy like you can&#39;t keep a girl like that. Grow up.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that, Jackson turned and strode away, not sparing Danny so much as a parting glance.<br />
<br />
For a moment, Danny felt like he might cry. He cursed under his breath, and slammed a fist against the wall as hard as he could.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that,&quot; he muttered to himself, and ripped off his backpack, hurriedly digging through it until he found his laptop, &quot;And fuck them. They need to pay. Both of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
In the back of his head, he couldn&#39;t help but think: dad was right. I still don&#39;t fit in, no matter what I do. Pushing the insecurity aside, he opened the chronoviac, and got to work.</p>
