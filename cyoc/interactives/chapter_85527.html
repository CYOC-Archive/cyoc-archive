<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three boys are aging in an arcade thanks to your age changing remote.  Jeremy, the blonde, has grown to be the tallest, clearly over six foot.  Devon, the dark-haired boy, is certainly the shortest at around five and a half feet; he&#39;s also the hairiest, with a full goatee and sideburns and body hair visually covering his torso under his too-small shirt.  Finally, there&#39;s Charles, the red head who has managed to be average in both height and weight.  You also can&#39;t stop watching.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve become enthralled at these boys&#39; changes.  Well, not really &quot;boys&quot; so much as &quot;young men&quot; now.  They&#39;ve only aged about six or so years in the brief minute since you turned to remote toward them.  However, Charles is trying to get the others to leave, which you don&#39;t want to happen.  You want to see this through.  Also, there&#39;s the chance somebody else is going to notice what&#39;s happening back here.  You need to speed things up.<br />
<br />
On your remote, you tap the forward button a couple times, until the screen reads &quot;+0.4 years/second&quot;.<br />
<br />
The boys, er, young men begin aging faster, now.  While the changes aren&#39;t as dramatic as when they passed through puberty, it&#39;s still quite a sight to see as they pass through their twenties.  Jeremy&#39;s growth slows and stops as he peaks in height.  His hair grows out some more, reaching his shoulders.  His facial hair, which is ironically more of a brown, finely coats his jaw, like a well-shaped stubble.  Devon&#39;s change is a bit more dramatic.  As he zips through his college years, Devon&#39;s form begins to bloat.  A beer belly forms and presses out on his clothes, finally snapping the waistband of his now tiny pants.  He struggles to pull his small shirt off as his weight increases, but it just tears of instead.  You can see Devon has become quite the hirsute young man, with hair covering almost the entirety of his once muscled torso.  His facial hair fills out to become a full beard on his rounding face and newly formed second chin.  Charles barely changes at all, however.  Like his two friends, Charles has met his peak height.  His body hair seems to fill out some, but by no means to the level of excess of Devon.  Charles&#39; facial hair also fills out some, becoming something of an untidy stubble, looking more like he&#39;d forgotten to shave in the past week than an actual beard.  You can almost make out his words, urging the other two to leave with him.  When he sees Devon balloon rip his clothes, Charles starts to quickly take off his shirt in case the same thing happens to him, but it does not.<br />
<br />
All this happens in a matter of seconds, and you almost have a hard time taking it all in, marveling at the power of this little remote.  There&#39;s no time to look away though, as the boys start going through their thirties.  They have taken off their clothes, for the most part, now, leaving their much too small underwear, straining to hold everything in.  Charles makes a plea for the others to follow him out once again.  Jeremy refuses, citing that they are now grown, naked men in a kids&#39; arcade area.  Devon has his hands on his stomach, like he&#39;s trying to push in back in.  It&#39;s difficult for you to tell in the darkened arcade, but you think you can see the faces of the boys-turned-men maturing, somewhat, less boyish.  Jeremy&#39;s hair is suddenly cut.  It&#39;s length is gone and is instead cut and styled into more of a business haircut.  His facial hair also vanishes, save for a pair of dark sideburns.  Devon&#39;s hair also changes, though in a different way.  His hairline steadily retreats, the dark hair vanishing.  Devon must realize what&#39;s happening, because he puts a hand to his head, open mouthed.  He follows his retreating hairline with his hand as it forms an M shape.  His weight also increases somewhat, and his gut sags over his waist and his chest sag and deflate.  You can also see the body hair covering him spread and begin covering his back.  Meanwhile, Charles, having given up getting his friends to leave with him, seems to be looking around the arcade to see if anybody has seen them.  You try to look to be engrossed in your arcade machine.  You&#39;re fairly certain he didn&#39;t see you staring.  Charles&#39; hair also shortens to a more manageable haircut, and his facial hair has formed a feeble-looking mustache.  His stomach also rounds out just a bit, as he gains a small bit of weight.<br />
<br />
You glance at your remote, just for a second.  You see the boys are in their late thirties, now, and entering their forties.  Jeremy&#39;s hairline recedes just a bit, and some noticeable rings begin forming under his eyes.  Devon&#39;s hair is just about gone.  A bald spot has formed on the back of his head and is engulfing his crown.  Streaks of grey hair have appeared in his hair, as well as his beard, which has become longer and scraggly.  Charles&#39; face looks a little weathered.  His hair retreats a little, as well, though not as much as Jeremy&#39;s.  His stomach grows as he gains more weight, making him just a little overweight.<br />
<br />
Charles seems to have had enough of this and just starts to make his way toward the door, change or no.  You quickly fiddle with your remote.  As fun as this is, you can&#39;t have a mostly naked man in his forties wandering around the mall.  You quickly stop the changes, setting their ages at around 43 or so.  You dial the setting to the &quot;Clothes&quot; option and press it.  The boys&#39; old clothes vanish as new clothes appear on the men, much to their surprise.  Jeremy is now in what looks to be a business suit, complete with grey jacket, slacks, white shirt and a tie.  Devon looks to be wearing some sort of metal band t-shirt and jeans.  Charles stops in his tracks as he&#39;s suddenly wearing a polo and jeans.  You also flick to the &quot;Reality&quot; setting and press the button, feeling the wave of rippling reality wash over you.  The three men you watched race through their lives merely stand still for a second, stunned.  Then they seem to shake out of it, smiling and talking with eachother.  The talk about how they used to hang out together in arcades just like this when they were little.  Jeremy just can&#39;t find the time anymore now that he&#39;s gotten a promotion at the firm he works at.  Devon found work as a band roadie and travels too much to really have consistent plans.  Charles mentions being a family man and watching his kids is practically a full-time job to itself.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help but to once again marvel at this little devices power.  However, another part of you feels a little guilty, causing these kids to skip over a large chunk of their lives.  Though, it&#39;s not like they missed anything.  The remote made new lives for them; it&#39;s like they never missed anything at all!  But is it the same?  Do you have the right to do this?  Also, did Charles mention having kids?  Where did they come from?  How does that work?<br />
<br />
Oh, well.  You shrug to yourself.  Questions for another time, perhaps.  You have a magic remote to get back to.</p>
