<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After Ray has downloaded the Chronivac from the “car” to the computer and then onto his phone, converting it into the App-version, Jeff has the sensation as if something “important” has been deleted from his “system”. The former human though can’t seem to figure out what that lost “data” was. Jeff’s mind, which is the computer of the car, continues to feel fuzzy, making it hard for Jeff to think straight, while the diagnostic and update program of a Skoda Superb Sportline is running through his system. At Jeff’s house, his computer wakes up from sleep-mode as the Chronivac detects yet another change.<br />
<br />
The program starts and a window pops up, the message reads, “WARNING! Lost connection to subject. Current transformation unreversible, until program is reconnected to subject. If subject is not reconnected to the program in less than 24 hours, the program will automatically delete the subject’s data to increase storage space. Subject’s mind will however stay intact in the new form, subject also remains aware. Reality alteration without the subject’s consent is not possible.” After the Chronivac has saved Jeff’s profile it shuts down, without the reality alteration, Jeff still exists as a human, his family and friends remember him, they’ll just assume he had run away or went missing. As for Dean, he remembers Jeff as his best pal and that he had transformed into Dean’s “car”. The teen was so excited to get his dream car, that he started to see Jeff as an object. After the transformation completed and Jeff had fully become the car, Dean only had one thing on his mind: get the car registered in his name. The registration caused Jeff to forget his name and where he lived, with the new information he only knew that Dean is his owner and his home is Dean’s garage, but he remembers being human, born in Atlanta, but also that he has been manufactured in the Chzech Republic. The former 16-year-old boy is really confused, he knows something is wrong, but he can’t put his finger on it.<br />
<br />
Back at Ray’s chop-shop, the 18-year-old is sitting in front of the computer, waiting for the update and diagnostic program to finish running the diagnostics on the “car”. While he is waiting, he is reading the manual of the Chronivac, which he downloaded from the “car” onto his phone. “Hehe… this Chronivac thing is really awesome,” the young man mumbles to himself, “with this I can finally fulfill my dream of having my very own carsale store with chop-shop.” Ray has an evil grin on his face, “hehe… there will be a few missing peoples reports soon,” he says, licking his lips at the thought transforming people into cars to sell.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he hears a knock on his garage door, “I wonder who that could be,” he says, getting up and walking towards the door. Ray opens the door and raises an eye brow as he spots a young boy, not older than 12 or 13 standing in front of him. The boy has a worried and nervous expression on his face. “Hi kid,” Ray says, “how can I help you?”<br />
<br />
The boy, who has an athletic built, short blond hair and blue eyes looks up at Ray, “s-sorry for bothering you, sir,” the boy says nervously, “I… I lost my way… I was with my pa-parents at the s-summer’s fair, but I have l-lost them in the crowd.” The boy is wearing a blue denim skinny jeans and a white t-shirt, he also has some blue Nike sneakers on his feet.<br />
<br />
“And you wanted to ask if I could help you call your parents or the police,” Ray asks.<br />
<br />
The boy nods, “y-yeah… c-can you help me?”<br />
<br />
Ray looks at the boy, grinning inwardly, ‘perfect, my first “car” to sell,’ he thinks to himself, “sure, I’ll help. Come on in and we’ll try to contact your parents, my name is Ray by the way,” he then says, stepping to the side to let the boy in.<br />
<br />
“Th-thanks, Ray,” the boy says, seeming to be relieved, “my name is J-Jordan… Jordan McKenny”<br />
<br />
“It is a pleasure to meet you, Jordan,” Ray says with a kind smile as he leads the boy into the garage.<br />
<br />
“Same,” Jordan says, smiling back, unaware that he is in great danger.<br />
<br />
As Ray and Jordan enter the garage, Ray turns to the boy, “sorry about the mess,” he says, “I am working on a car a friend of mine brought in today.”<br />
<br />
Jordan looks around the garage, his eyes land on Dean’s “car”, the boy’s eyes widen, “woah… what a cool car,” he says, walking towards it, “what make is it?”<br />
<br />
“It is a Skoda Superb Sportline,” Ray says, “you seem to like cars.”<br />
<br />
Jordan nods as he walks around the car, checking out every angle and peering into the windows. “Yeah, I especially love fast cars,” he says, “like Ferarri, Porsche, McLaren, Ducati. But I also love luxury cars like Bentley, Cadillac, Rolce Royce, Bugatti,” he continues.<br />
<br />
Ray lets out a whistle, “so, a fan of the best of the best,” he says with a grin. The young man pulls out his phone, Jordan does not notice as Ray opens the App and aims the camera at the boy, scanning him. Ray smirks evilly as Jordan’s stats pop up on his phone screen, “tell me Jordan,” he says, “what is your favorite car? What kind of car would you love to own?”<br />
<br />
The boy thinks for a while, “well, since I love fast and luxury cars, I’d love to have a car that combines both,” he says, “A 7 series BMW would be sweet.”<br />
<br />
Ray nods, “great choice,” he says, “what color would you like to have?”<br />
<br />
“I like blue,” Jordan says, not noticing Ray typing something into his phone, ”maybe a nice sky blue or night blue.”<br />
<br />
Ray again types something into his phone, “cool, cool,” he says, nodding, “why don’t you stand in that free parking spot? I have no chairs, but you’ll be fine.”<br />
<br />
Jordan finds it a little weird but he does as told, “oh, you need the number of my mom,” Jordan says.<br />
<br />
“What is it,” Ray asks, Jordan starts to tell Ray the number. The young man starts to type into his phone, Jordan thinks that Ray is inserting the number, but in truth Ray is continuing to edit Jordan’s stats. After Ray had added the car and car-color to the boy’s stats he sets the transformation to last for two hours, he turns Jordan’s ability to talk off, muting the boy. Ray leaves the boy’s awareness on and sets the duration of the transformation to permanent, lastly, he makes sure that Jordan is unable to move, then he hits confirm. After hitting confirm, Ray puts the phone to his ear, pretending to call Jordan’s parents. He sits down on his chair, facing the boy, smirking inwardly as he waits for the transformation to begin.</p>
