<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Come morning Jeff felt well rested and ready to explore the farm and his tempoary employment. It was his seeking for three friends which brought him there, and they were sold here by Madame' some time ago.<br />
<br />
Four barns sat on the property. Jeff checked them out one by one finding first only farm equipment in one, then horse drawn wagons in another. It was the third one that he discover held nine stalls and eight fine formed Percheron horses. The eight all looked over their tall shoulders at Jeff. He walked up the isle behind the horses seeing as docked tails swished that all were female, except for one which was without a doubt the stallion. <br />
<br />
Friendly to Jeff, the eight horses snorted softly as he walked behind each until standing by the larger horse and stallion. Massive, thought Jeff seeing these huge animals that weighed at near 1500 lbs. each. He wondered at them if perchance they or any of them were once human, and or placed here by Madame' and her perverted act.<br />
<br />
Standing and petting the stallion he felt the animal's desire to tell him it's thoughts. It was as if the horse was reaching out his very own mind to speak in mental telepathy to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Walking to actually face the huge horse Jeff looked up fixing his stare and eyes to that of the stallion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, MY NAME, MY NAME I CAN NOT REMEMBER ANY MORE! I, I AM THIS ANIMAL THAT STANDS HERE BEFORE YOU, A THING OF HUGE FRAME, LARGE BONES, ENORMUS MUSCLE AND STRENGTH. HELP ME, HELP ME IF YOU CAN!&quot; asked the horse's mind to Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff assured the stallion he would try to help him and anyone else that might have been sold to the farm over the past years. He was asking the stallion about his friends and to which was directed to the last and forth barn he had not yet investigated.<br />
<br />
A friendly pat to the great horse's neck Jeff stepped past its side to walk down the isle and out the barn. As he moved along the horse's flanks it side stepped and pressed Jeff tightly to the plank wall dividing his stall from another. <br />
<br />
Jeff was crushed there by the animal's intent and massive body. Wriggling himself down to a crouching stance, Jeff was on his knees below the huge belly of the Percheron stallion. There looming in the dank light was the male sheath hung belly the stallion's groin. Directly in front of Jeff was this large leathery looking pouch that was with the male animal's own thoughts beginning to show obvious signs to awakening.<br />
<br />
Knowing all too well of what would soon fall out erect in size, shape, and mass, Jeff weasled his way past the stout hind legs of the stallion horse.<br />
<br />
The stallion's musky scent filled the space as his male self flared out in all of a Percheron's glory. <br />
<br />
A friendly pat to the tall massive rear of the horse Jeff spoke, &quot; Easy my big friend, easy! I know what you have down there all to well, it is even more huge than that of my friends who stand about here as Jackasses. I shall return, try to think about that if you can!&quot; <br />
<br />
Walking quickly out the barn, the rank scent of a stallion horse about to masturbate himself was getting to be too much for Jeff to stand. A quick and short walk to the last and forth barn had Jeff hearing the sounds of Donkeys braying to the early morning light.<br />
<br />
Entering the barn Jeff was stunned to see a long isle with not less than thirty stalls. In each stall stood out into the isle a furry rumps, ropey tails, and hind legs of insensed donkeys longing for to feel there sensual selves.<br />
<br />
Walking down the isle Jeff began to count the donkeys, most by their rumps fortold of them being all females. Donkeys to his right and left , each standing one by one is their appointed stalls, Jeff longed to find his friends first.<br />
<br />
Swishing tails, stomping and eager hind legs, donkey after donkey turned to look down along their flanks and watch Jeff walk past. It was easy to see those female donkeys wishing and longing for to be mated as Jeff noted some were winking the blackened lips of their very equine vulvas. A stark transition of color from the black outer skin color and the inner pink color of the donkey's vaginal skin. Some spouted their brown vaginal juices making the isleway stink of donkey sexual desires.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee Haw!&quot; the ragged sound made by Jack males as they now picked up the scent of those donkey females jetting their rank desires into the isle.<br />
<br />
Jeff came to six large box stalls and in each stood a mature male donkey. One blonde donkey, two gray donkeys, a black donkey, each in their large stalls, all erect as hell, and sniffing the wafting scent.<br />
<br />
&quot;JOHN.....WALKER......SETH.....are you guys here?&quot; asked Jeff loudly.<br />
<br />
Instantly the two gray colored Jackasses leaped up on their stall's side panels, braying wildly as if hearing for the first time in a long while a name, their names!<br />
<br />
Petting the soft muzzels of his donkey Jackass friends Jeff walked to them comforting them as to his ultimate intentions. These were two of his friends but there was still one more, but two differing donkeys stood by in their own stalls.<br />
<br />
Again Jeff called out the names of his frinds getting happy thrilled brays from the two already standing upright and showing their delight.<br />
<br />
The blonde donkey Jack stood looking up at Jeff, he made not a sound but swung his ropey black tail looking at ease with his small world. The other was the black one and he was anything but at ease. He was prancing in circles as if eager to mate with those jenny donkey's spewing out their sensaul scented juices. He pranced eager to be at mating, his male part swaying side to side as he walked quickly in a circle. Snorting and looking as if he could just jump out of his stall at any moment Jeff wondered if perchance this one was yet his third and lost friend?<br />
<br />
Bang went the barn door, &quot;Hey there, good morning, I see your up earloy and getting your bearings already! Well breakfast is on the table and the Misses is got your meal ready, come lets eat and I'll show you your duties.&quot; announced the old farmer.<br />
<br />
Jeff walks quickly to meet and follow the man as two Gray donkey Jacks scream their terror at being found and now left to be as donkeys yet.</p>
