<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob locked eyes with his girlfriend as she walked slowly through the door. He crossed his legs to cover himself, not being able to stand the idea of her seeing him demasculated like he&#39;d been. <br />
He sat up with an explanation on his tongue. But it died right then and there as his eyes fell to her crotch. <br />
She was covering herself with her hands, but those dainty digits had no chance of concealing the monster that hung between her toned, muscular thighs. <br />
Even flaccid and curled in her fingers he could tell it was larger than his was when he was at his hardest. And the balls beneath were large and heavy enough that they strained againt her attempt to restrain them. <br />
Given that the rest of her changes were a bit less obvious (she was a big fitness buff and was definitely on the muscular side for a woman, So the toned ass and muscular quads were nothing new) Rob couldnt help but focus on her impressive new cock.<br />
&quot;Becs.... what did they do to you?&quot;<br />
A blush crossed her face and she turned away, but still answered, <br />
&quot;They gave me a dick Rob. A big fucking dick. Whatever they shot me up with made me cum. Hard. Then this thing poped out of me,&quot;<br />
She paused, taking her boyfriend in where  he lay in a puddle made up of a combination <br />
of his own semen and girl-cum. <br />
&quot;Rob, what the fuck did they do to you?&quot; Concern was in her eyes as she move to his side, reaching out to caress his cheek in her usual protective manner. <br />
Rob took a long breath in. He couldnt hide this from her. Despite her new addition, she was still his girlfriend. He couldnt help but want her. But he knew she wasnt into girls. That was already something she&#39;d tried before. And she probably wouldnt be into the dickless freak they had made of him. <br />
He slowly let his breath out as the man prepared for her horror and rejection. Then uncrossed his legs, baring a still dripping and very female sex to her. Uncharacteristic tears built in his eyes, his heart pounding as he looked down at himself with shame.<br />
But a finger slipped under Robs chin and lifted his gaze back hers. And the way she was looking at him somehow made him even wetter. There wasnt any disgust in those eyes. Only white hot lust. His nipples were hard and sensitive as she leaned down and kissed him. <br />
Passionately. Hungrily. Her tongue twining with his as she took all his worries away with her lips. <br />
They broke for a moment, both breathing hard. There was a heat in his stomach and need between his thighs. A need that she was examining with a wry smirk. <br />
&quot;Dont freak out babe. But I think you are so fucking hot right now,&quot;<br />
He glanced down at her cock shyly. It was his turn to blush. &quot;I can tell. I really turn you on like this huh?&quot; Rob swallowed hard as she pushed him back on the floor. He didnt resist. The way the mans&#39; heart was racing and the way his pussy was dripping make it impossible to deny how horny it made him. <br />
&quot;Fuck yes, you do,&quot; she said as she leaned over him, spreading his legs with a knee. He instinctively lifted them, presenting himself to her in an act of submission. He swallowed hard. This was so fucking hot, surrendering to her. He didnt know if it was whatever they injected him with, or if it was something he had been secretly craving all along. And he didnt care.<br />
As Becky&#39;s long hard member rubbed up against his pussy he rocked his hips into her. Rolling against her as he savored the feeling of her slickened hardness sliding against his clit. She smiled down at him, seeing the flush in his cheeks and knowing exactly what she was doing to him. <br />
&quot;You really want it dont you, babe?&quot; She asked in a husky voice, &quot;You want me to take you just like youve taken me so many times. You want me to change the script? This time, make you my bottom bitch?&quot;<br />
A very effeminate moan escaped his lips as his hips bucked. That was the only answer she needed. Becky savored the way every muscle on his torso was on display, his strong arms taunt with restraint as he held them above his head. The muscles standing out starkly with the effort. He might be begging for her cock right now, but damn was he still the hottest man she&#39;d ever known.<br />
She bit her lip as her cock throbbed at the sight. She hadnt even had to ask him to keep his hands back like that. When had he gotten so good at being so submissive? <br />
The faint line of his abbs showed through the thin layer of fat on his belly as he rubbed his needy new parts against her, massaging her cock deliciously, hungrily. His control finally slipped and he tried to slide up hight to take her cock in, his eyes bright with need. <br />
She stopped him with a hand on his belly, pinning him in place.<br />
&quot;Not yet cutie,&quot; she tutted, her lips inches from his, &quot;You&#39;re not in charge here,&quot; her other hand slipped up to pin his wrists above his head. Then she rocked back a little, lining up her cockhead and letting just the tip barely part his sopping wet entrance. <br />
He whimpered in response, his legs trembled with need. His eyes were wide over parted lips. He wanted it so bad that it was all he could focus on.  He needed her inside of him right fucking now. Some last vestige of his masculine pride told him he should be ashamed of how much he needed that hard dick inside of him. But that hollow voice was drowned out by the need between his legs as his girlfriend held him helpless and squirming on the floor. His eyes traced down her heavy tits to her toned and taunt abbs. Then to her waist where it tapered down into a promise land that he wanted to know so that. So bad it had him panting and moaning and grinding against her restraining hand like a bitch in heat.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you want it, youre going to have to ask for it. Like the good boy I know you are,&quot; she purred, gently pressing her cock head into him.</p>
