<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“My God.” Breathed Ana her new lungs/gills taking in deep breaths of water which entered her mouth but never left instead passing out of her body through her new gills on her side. Her blonde hair was a mess and she lied on her husband’s bare chest; her chest was also bare but her sea sell bra was on the nearby floor. Her royal blue tail was off to the side a bit, but she didn’t care, she was still coming down from the high.<br />
“I know.” Said her husband Tim as he lied on the bed, the bed itself seemed to be made from some sea-sponge thing but it was so comfortable. Was breathing heavily as well, with his hand resting on his wife’s ass just like her hands where on his shoulders as the two just laid there.<br />
“If this is mermaid sex…” started Ana her voice a little horse and breathless.<br />
“It was worth it just for this.” Stated Tim, as she smiled into his chest. “I thought the 1st one last night was just a fluke…because it is something so new…”<br />
“But this feels so good.” Confirmed Ana as she looked out the window. It was still somewhat dark, but she had no reference on how dawn was supposed to look under water. She did see her husband’s blue tail moving a bit and she chuckled. <br />
“What is so funny?” laughed Tim<br />
“I hope we like blue.” Stated Ana as Tim raised an eyebrow. “Well…we didn’t use any protection and I take daily birth control, I should be good for today depending on what the magic did to us but unless we want to risk kids every time we do this we will have to ask about that.”<br />
“I am not sure they even have birth control.” Stated Tim as Ana raised an eyebrow. “They said their population is dropping because of population they may limit birth control then.”<br />
“Well…we wanted to wait until you finished college to start a family but I don’t think that you with finish now.” Stated Ana “Hell I am a teacher and I don’t know what to teach merpeople.”<br />
“We will figure it out.” Stated Tim as he placed his hand on the back of Ana’s head and held her close. <br />
In the nearby room Monica was feeding their new daughter while Damon sat beside her watching with a huge smile while rubbing his wife’s back. They both had enjoyed the physical activity of the night and found it to be the best either had ever had, there was just something else which added to the act when one was a merperson. The only issue was that they were about to start again when the baby cried because she was hungry.<br />
“We need to name her.” Said Monica<br />
“Ya…Ariel?” stated Damon with a laugh as Monica gave him a look. “I am joking…but yes she needs a name…how about after your Aunt? The one who died when you were little.”<br />
Monica smiled as she remembered her elderly Aunt, she had been 9 when she died from cancer but she had always been the one member of her horrible family who gave two shits about her. She didn’t have much but she had been the one to help Monica get some new cloths and other stuff while her deadbeat parents spent it on themselves.<br />
“Ya…Isabella, or Bella for short.” Said Monica as she looked at the baby mermaid, their baby. “Hello there Isabella.”<br />
In another nearby room, the situation was a little tense for Chloe and Stacy, they hadn’t engaged in any adult activities even though Stacy was more than willing it was Chloe who had turned down all advancements. In the morning, Stacy was busy doing her hair with the provided comb and brush while Chloe sat on the bed and looked out the window.<br />
“Ok…I have had it.” Said Stacy suddenly as she spun around and looked at her girlfriend. “What the hell is wrong with you? I know you don’t have a headache so what is going on?”<br />
Chloe thought for a moment but gave in to those dark eyes.<br />
“I am sorry.” Said Chloe as she looked at her floor and her own green tail. “I shouldn’t have gone to the beach, I should have…”<br />
“You couldn’t have know about this…” started Stacy<br />
“I was going to ask you to marry me, yesterday.” Blurted out Chloe as Stacy just looked at her stunned. “I had the whole thing planned out, I had reservations at our favorite place, I had even had the table picked out. I called two of our friends to go to record the moment but they had to cancel last minute…so I called Ana to see if they were free last night, I was going to tell them over the phone my plans but you walked in and so I accepted their offer to go to the beach. I was going to ask them there to do it but then…I am so sorry I shouldn’t had wanted to record the moment, I should have…”<br />
She never got to say another word as Stacy swam over and pulled her into a deep kiss, their tails wrapping around each other as they embraced.<br />
“Do you really think I blame you for this?” inquired Stacy “Not for a moment, fate delt us this hand and we will make the best of it. Besides this place is a hell of lot more accepting of two lesbians then the surface, we will be fine as long as we are together.”<br />
Chloe cried a little as the two embraced and just held each other.<br />
Adrian had always been an early riser, he had made a good amount of his daily money as an driver during the morning commute. Rich people who didn’t want to deal with the stress of driving their cars into the office would pay him to do it for them while they sat in the back talking on their phones or playing some game. It had helped that in army he had always been the first to rise but now he moved down into the lobby and found Cura talking with a merman he hadn’t seen before.<br />
“Ah Adrian you are up early.” Said Cura as the merman nodded his head and swam away. “What are you doing up so early?”<br />
“I am always up early, who was he?” inquired Adrian  <br />
“I believe humans would call him a telegraph operator or a Post man.” stated Cura as Adrian chuckled a bit, it was clear just like he didn’t know much about the mer-world she didn’t know much about the human world. “Well seams like a member of the government is coming up tomorrow to see you all, to decide how best to integrate you all.”<br />
“I see.” Said Adrian <br />
“He also had news from the surface, they are conducting a search for you all but they are going with the story that you have been pulled out to sea.” Stated Cura <br />
“Makes sense.” Said Harmony as she arrived adjusting her sea shell bra. “Question is there a shop or something where I can get something else? I mean I like the whole sea shell thing but I like more coverage.”<br />
“There is.” Confirmed Cura who was wearing a different top as well. “We will arrange for you all to go shopping today.”<br />
“Question we don’t have money.” Said Colton as he arrived, behind him came Lupa who seamed to be all smiles.<br />
<br />
“We will cover that for the moment, but don’t worry it isn’t often that we have new members of our society.” Said Cura <br />
“By the way, you said you have cities how is that possible? How could you hide whole cities?” inquired Colton “I mean a village like this is small enough to remain hidden but I don’t think you could hide anything larger.” <br />
“Unless the whole inner sea theory is true.” Added Lupe <br />
“What?” inquired Harmony<br />
“There are legends that the inside of the earth is hallow and a huge inner ocean is down there instead of molten rock.” Stated Harmony<br />
“That is just stupid, science would have found that by now.” Stated Colton as the other former humans agreed.<br />
“It was just a theory and until yesterday none of us believed mermaids where real.” Defended Lupe<br />
“Well you are somewhat correct.” stated Cura as they all looked at her. “There is no hidden ocean at the center of the world, however there are multiple hidden oceans located just under a few meters of rock and are connected by tunnels with the ocean floor as you know it and each other. That is where the bulk of merpeople and other water based magical creatures live.” <br />
“I see…so why are you guys up here then?” inquired Adrian as Lupe grinned knowing she was somewhat right.<br />
“Because…some type of seaweed and other food items do not grow well there.” Stated Cura “We are farmers who in risk our lives with humans, pollution and animals so that the rest of our society can eat.”<br />
“I see…” said Colton <br />
“Well let’s get some breakfast while we rest for the others to arrive.” Stated Cura</p>
