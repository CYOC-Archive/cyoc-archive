<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">((Pardon if this is stepping on toes a bit, just had a slightly different direction in mind))<br />
<br />
Absolutely fascinated, Camille took a moment to process the wonderous new maid and giggled as the overzealous plant creature hummed pleasantly and busied herself with food from inside. &quot;I like her!&quot; Camille pointed her thumb towards the house. &quot;The kid has enthusiasm!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeahhh.&quot; Ty blinked. &quot;I may need to turn that down.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Don&#39;t you dare!&quot; The deer chortled. &quot;I like her just the way she is. She&#39;s like a perfect representation of our weirdness. Beautiful, eager, and kind of dumb.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing together, Ty and his doe wandered into Camille&#39;s restored forest and playfully began to chase and dance around one another.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need more of this!&quot; The deer waved her hand across her creation. &quot;Through this whole valley.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That might be a bit jarring to the animals living here though...&quot; Said Ty, thinking. &quot;We -did- just have a talk about baby steps.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; The deer said, crossing her arms under her ample top buxom, and over her second one. &quot;I&#39;m all pent up! I want to make something wondrous happen!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say that was off limits babe.&quot; Said Ty, &quot;Im just saying a sudden rampant Biome change would be a bit rough on the fauna. Kinda surprised you&#39;re so gung-ho for a jungle yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
She shrugged. &quot;You&#39;re the one who filled my head up with so many new concepts of what nature can be like. Blame a girl for wanting to see it first hand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at all.&quot; Said Ty. &quot;But, we&#39;re supposed to be caretakers of the forest now, we shouldn&#39;t change the entire thing  at once without the animals&#39; say so.&quot; He said calmly.<br />
<br />
Chamille huffed. &quot;When did you get so mature and responsible?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged. &quot;Hey, you&#39;ve made one really good change so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what am I supposed to -now.- Mister responsible plant-slut maker?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I want to see what you can come up with, honest! Just, maybe try and keep it to our little area, or something a lot of other animal folk could benefit from? Might be a nice gesture to help build trust up.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hm.&quot; She said, thinking deeply, before snapping her hoof-fingers as inspiration struck. The doe raised her hands into the air, smiled warmly, and let a flood of golden energy waft from her fingertips into the air. Ty stood back and watched as the trees around them grew, the forest canopy thickened, and all around them the flowers, plants, and grass grew richer and more diverse. Ferns sprouted from the ground and unfurled into huge fans, tropical trees and shrubs erupted and swelled to size, color and vibrancy increased everywhere. Plants from different biomes across the earth popped up, mingling together in impossible ways, mushrooms popped out of the ground and grew to the size of bar stools. The deer dropped her hands in sweating exhaustion and laughed manically.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s just the warm up.&quot; She raised her eyebrow to Ty and winked. &quot;Now here&#39;s the show.&quot;<br />
<br />
The deer took a deep breath, gathered her magic, and swung her hands into the air casting miracles. In the treetops above, beams of wood burst from the trunks, stretching out and slotting together, leaves and reeds weaving together to form canopies, and they gradually took shape into large open-air homes. Ty marvelled at how inviting they looked.<br />
<br />
The deer laughed as she carved a fresh river through the dense super-forest, feeding several smaller channels, spreading out further into the valley, smaller examples of the various new flora sprouting up around it, like an inviting preview for all approaching. <br />
<br />
Ty looked around them in wonderment, hearing the excited chirping of birds above investigating these new structures, and he noticed naturally-formed devices looking a lot like bird feeders had formed as well. He looked back to Camille to find her completely naked, panting, and staring at him with the most sensual expression she could muster, which given her perfect sexiness was considerable. She slapped her tight ass, shaking off the dew from her fur as the rain abated instantly, and grinned. &quot;There. There&#39;s your fucking queen of the forest, little man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty&#39;s mouth dropped as Camille turned, rubbing her hands over her sides, and struck a delicious pose with her mane of brown hair waving in the breeze. The sun shone through the canopy and she seemed to be positively glowing.<br />
<br />
She threw her hair into a ponytail, grinned, and hoofed over to the new river, jumping in up to her hips and wading into the gentle flow. The water was pure and crystal clean. A couple of salmon swam by. Camille grinned, pointed her fingers, and snapped. The two fish bubbled and curled, twisting and writhing as they both began to transform.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re gonna make a lot of new friends today.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Starting with these two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beneath her, Camille watched through the clear water as the salmon twisted and grew in size. Their expressions changed from dull unintelligence to realizing shock. Fins popped out, tails enlarged, and torsos grew shape. She sighed dreamily as two hunky fish men shot up from the water, standing just a smaller than Ty, and gasped as they took their first breaths above water. Fishy webbed hands and glimmering scales shone in the sunlight. The two piscines blinked at each other, then turned to regard Camille, and finally Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, boys!&quot; The deer said excitedly. &quot;Welcome to your new lives!&quot;<br />
<br />
The two salmon waved politely, shyly, and seemed to pull back into the water nervously. Camille laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... w-what is this?&quot; One of the fish said. He stared back at his slightly less muscular friend and they exchanged strange looks. &quot;We were swimming...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think she changed us.&quot; The other fish whispered, his voice slightly higher, maybe a little effeminate. &quot;Uh... thank you, miss?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Camille.&quot; The deer bowed politely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; The manlier salmon said. Ty realized that the two were getting closer and closer. They were holding hands. He gasped in realization and chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to go and enjoy your new lives. Swim, splash, go exist. You&#39;re free to do whatever you want.&quot; Camille grinned warmly, seeing the two holding hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... whatever we want?&quot; The softer salmon laughed nervously. &quot;There... aren&#39;t any... rules?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;None.&quot; Ty said with an understanding nod. &quot;You guys are safe here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s lovely!&quot; The softer salmon sighed in relief, touching his scaly chest. His hand held his partner&#39;s happily and they exchanged a quick loving kiss. &quot;Do you think we might have names to call ourselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You go ahead and give them to yourself if you&#39;d like.&quot; Camille smiled, pulling back onto the riverbank. &quot;I think I&#39;m done naming people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; The more effiminate fish nodded. &quot;That&#39;s very kind! Well, I suppose we ought to think about that, right?&quot; He nudged his &#39;friend&#39; and they both chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you so much!&quot; The other fish smiled, exposing his sharp teeth. &quot;This is really amazing! Is there anything we can do in return?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Camille slapped her knees. &quot;I suppose there is! Think about something you&#39;d like to have for your rivers, and come visit later, I&#39;m eager to get building!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes! Of course!&quot; The gentler one nodded. &quot;Yes, I&#39;d be happy to!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, they both waved an eager good bye, and still holding hands they splashed into the water and began swimming with their powerful tails.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gay fish.&quot; Ty laughed. &quot;How about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eh, it&#39;s a free forest.&quot; Camille shrugged. &quot;We&#39;re starting this right, dammit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I presume you had the crow family in mind with these houses?&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded. &quot;Mhm! We can invite them to live here near us or make one of them where they are. But now when we find some more bird friends, we&#39;ll have somewhere to point them.,. Speaking of which...&quot;<br />
<br />
She focused once more, this time parts of the forest floor smoothing down, earthen paths forming amongst the trees, and hand-holds forming on the trunks leading up to the houses. &quot;I was inspired by Petal to do this!&quot; She said, sending out a sparkling flourish of magic, and large flowers formed along the paths, their petals drooping, making them look like curvy lamps, before something in them began to glow with a soft light. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got a real eye for this.&quot; Said Ty with surprise, and admiration for his love. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for noticing.&quot; She said hautily. &quot;Whoo... but that took a lot. I think I&#39;m ready for lunch. Shall we go see what Petal&#39;s made for us?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ty nodded, and the pair trotted back off to their home, hand in hand.</p>
