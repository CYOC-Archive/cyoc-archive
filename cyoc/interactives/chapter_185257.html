<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark woke up again around 1:00 p.m. Jackie was quietly watching TV on the couch next to him. He was honestly surprised how comfortably he could have slept on the sofa with how large he is. He sat up and immediately realized that he definitely was not the size he remembered and neither was Jackie. Her lips looked like soft pillows. Her breasts had very visible cleavage they had to be at least D cups. In fact she was looking pretty thick in general.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh hey handsome hope I didn&#39;t wake you, how was your little nap?&quot; She turned to face him displaying her improved visage.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um. Good...Hey babe I had the craziest dream.&quot; At this point he was willing to try anything just to make sense of it all. Maybe this would jog something? &quot;I dreamt that you were really short, with pretty much no curves,&quot; he looked down at his arms realizing that they weren&#39;t very muscular in fact he looked very average. &quot;And I was super tall and pretty buff... crazy right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That that is pretty crazy. I&#39;m sure you missed these.&quot; Jackie shook her tits at him. &quot; I can&#39;t imagine what itd be like if you were tall though you&#39;ve always been short since I met you. I mean we&#39;re the same height but you are shorter than average for a man being 5&#39;6 and all. Although, it would be nice to rest my head on your chest when standing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot; there was no point,  he knew he would just sound crazy if he debated with her or questioned it or even showed any sort of surprise &quot;Yeah..&quot; Mark could almost feel his heartbreak inside his chest. He had to wake up from this nightmare.<br />
<br />
&quot;And damn I can&#39;t imagine being some scrawny curveless girl, that would suck for us both. I&#39;ve always been a little thick, it got me into the best trouble in high school. I love my body the way it is, and I know you do too.&quot; She grabbed his hand and placed it on her breasts. It was happening again, Mark was getting irresistibly aroused by her and he couldn&#39;t think straight. The next thing he knew he was on top of her. And then it happened. He accidentally came prematurely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit sorry babe.&quot; He had never done that before.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, I know you can&#39;t resist me.&quot; She winked at him. &quot;But could you help finish me off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah of course.&quot; Mark went down on her and although it took almost 30 minutes she finally came. And not long after that the two fell asleep again.<br />
<br />
Mark woke up in a jolt once more. This time he could smell something delicious. He checked the clock, it was 3:30. He got up and realized the room looked bigger, he rushed to a mirror and saw that he was definitely shorter and looking a little thin. His facial hair which used to grow in thick and full looked patchy. He followed the smell into the kitchen. There was Jackie, standing tall. Taller than him. Her breasts had to at least be a DD cups, in fact they look to be spilling out her top. She had a really nice sized ass that was heart-shaped with wide child bearing hips. Her waist was thin and only emphasized just how thicc the rest of her was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good afternoon, want a late lunch?&quot; Jackie approached him, leaned foreward and kissed him. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? You look like you&#39;ve seen a ghost.&quot; Mark couldn&#39;t help but stand there, he always thought Jackie was beautiful but now she was an absolute wet dream and he was also terrified of the fact that she was now taller. &quot;A ghost you want to fuck?&quot; She smiled devilish. He had been staring at her tits and she caught him. They weren&#39;t usually this big after all, or this close to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sorry I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its fine short stuff I&#39;m just glad I can still catch your gaze&quot; She lifted a plate from the counter and placed it on the table in front of him. He could see that she now had muscle definition in her arms. Jackie was never one for weight training but something must have changed, it was like reality was altering around him. But would could be causing? Mark figured something had to be behind these changes, something new, something that wasn&#39;t here before. It was like old fantasy novels he read where some sort of artifact would change reality until the maine hero found the source of the magic and destroyed it... he needed a drink. He got up from his chair and approached the counter reaching up to grab a glass. He realized that his favorite one was no longer within his reach, it was on the top shelf of the cabinet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, sorry babe I&#39;ll get that for you.&quot; As Jackie appeared behind him her round, full breasts rested upon his shoulde blades, soft and warm. The sense of them on his back seem to rush all the blood in his body to his dick &quot;I don&#39;t know why I put that up there, must have been absent minded, here you go.&quot; Even her hands were larger than his now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. How... how tall are you again babe?&quot; Mark was ready for it this time, the day was both teasing him and testing his spirit.<br />
<br />
&quot;5&#39;9, half a foot taller than you infact. That&#39;s how I got on the girl&#39;s basketball team in highschool, I wasn&#39;t the tallest but definitely tall for a girl.&quot; She grabbed some wine and began pouring him and herself a glass. &quot;Although these ladies used to make it difficult.&quot; She felt up her tits. &quot;But its not all bad, pretty sure they&#39;re your favorite part anyways. Oh that reminds me, the game starts in an hour!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Man I miss basketball.&quot; Mark was surprised, Jackie never used to like sports, this was completely out of character, was she changing metally too?<br />
<br />
&quot;You used to play? You never told me.&quot; Jackie&#39;s eyes widen with genuine curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah all through highschool.&quot; This was ao strange, he knew she met him in college at one of his games. Even if she didn&#39;t like sports her friend had invited her and he was lucky enough to catch her eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;No offense babe but I&#39;m surprised you made the team at all, I mean you&#39;re pretty short.&quot; She smirked but tried to hide it, her hands on her large hips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was actually pretty good, I made varsity afterall!&quot; Mark was getting a bit flustered by this point. Basketball was hia first love afterall, what did she think he did in this reality?<br />
<br />
&quot;Well why don&#39;t you play me and you can show me, lunch can wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright I will!&quot; Mark follwed her out the sliding glass door, her thicc booty swaying from side to side as she strut up to the court.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok you&#39;re shirts.&quot; She pulled at her v cut sweater and took it off revealing her abs and a huge bra which looked to be struggling to contain her cantaloupes. &quot;And Im skins.&quot; She winked at him and Mark lost his footing for a second. She looked like a model, a plus sized one. She was obviously trying to throw him off. &quot;If you win I&#39;ll give you a blowjob.&quot; She bit at her finger. &quot;But if I win you have to eat out my ass.&quot; Jackie was always a bit conservative in how she dressed and how she spoke in regards to sex, unless of course they were alone. She was so much more sexual and provacative now though, old Jackie would have never taken off her shirt in her own backyard for fear that a neighbor would see. What was happening?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then, Im game!&quot; And so the game commenced. The height advantage that Jackie had immediately came into play when she took the ball right off. Mark couldn&#39;t jump nearly as high as he used to, and his coordination was completely off. Jackie on the other hand seemed to know exactly what she was doing, every move she made exuded experience and also made her butt and breasts jiggle greatly. After only 10 minutes, Jackie had won 5-0. &quot;Im just a little rusty is all...&quot; Mark was beyond embarrassed, it was like he had forgotten all the muscle memory he developed for the sport in school. Not to mention Jackie was half a foot taller than him, which gave her better reach and a wider gate by which to move across the court.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, its ok short stuff,&quot; She pinched his cheek then stuck her tongue out at him. &quot; Maybe stick to photography and journalism yeah? And don&#39;t worry Ill suck your cock anyways, I miss the little guy.&quot; Little guy? He hadn&#39;t even checked to see if his cock got smaller. And Mark had never picked up a camera in his life, that was Jackie&#39;s old hobby.<br />
<br />
After lunch, of which the once food shy Jackie devoured a huge plate, things picked up again. She winked at Mark and threw him at the couch. Not long after impact ahe was unzipping Mark&#39;s pants revealing his now 4in cock, less than half its original size. &quot;There&#39;s the little guy.&quot; She giggled much to the emasculation of Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have to call it that?&quot; The embarrassment was thick in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh baby, I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t mean it like that, you know I like your dick.&quot; She kissed its head as if it were a cute puppy dog. Mark almost came immediately and used all his strength to stope himself. She began to suck. Between her incredible prowess and gorgeous form it only took a minute or two and Mark came immediately, even with him trying his best to resist the finale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus that was quick!&quot; He was used to lasting much longer and Jackie never used to be good at blowjobs in fact she often choked on his dick or really didn&#39;t do much for him, Mark often relied on penetration for satisfaction in their sex life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve had plenty of practice in highschool like I told you, but you&#39;re definitely the easiest I&#39;ve worked with.&quot; She winked at him again.<br />
<br />
&quot;How many guys have you slept with again?&quot; Mark asked weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit... Let&#39;s see. I know I lost my virginity at 14&quot; That was news to Mark, originally he had taken Jackie&#39;s virginity. &quot;I&#39;d say at least 12, but you&#39;re the one I&#39;m with so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; She smiled at him, her thick lips still oozing with cum a bit. She slurped the last of it up. &quot;Alright then, it&#39;s my turn.&quot; Jackie spalyed herself out to give revealing her phat ass and pussy. Mark went to work trying to eat out her ass and finger her pussy in the process but after a while defaulted to penetration. She didn&#39;t feel tight at all to him though, his dick was just too small and after 45mins of trying different things he couldn&#39;t seem to get her there. &quot;Hey babe no offense but, maybe I could just finish myself off? I kinda want to watch the game.&quot; She looked to be over it, like he was hardly doing anything really.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... Um, yeah sorry, sure... Do you want some help?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;ve got it, really.&quot; Jackie looked off into space like she was uncomfortable having to tell him this. So Jackie started to pleasure herself until she came, which hardly took any time. The next thing Mark knew both of them fell asleep on the couch watching the game, like there was some sort of force making them do so, something he couldn&#39;t fight it no matter how hard he tried.</p>
