<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As we finished our drinks, Rachel said, “You know, I think it’s time for another feminine lesson for these three.  Or maybe two, actually.”<br />
 <br />
“Oh, yea, what are those?” asked Scott.<br />
 <br />
“Well, for one thing, you’re all women where it counts, so you need to start using tampons,” she answered. <br />
 <br />
“Oh, boy,” said Scott.  “I’d forgotten about this.”<br />
 <br />
Joyce said, “It’s not going to be something you can forget about.  Unless you want some bad consequences.”<br />
 <br />
“Alright, alright,” grumbled Scott.  “Let’s get this over with.”<br />
 <br />
“Good thing you all have an experienced teacher,” said Pam.<br />
 <br />
Yes, it was, I thought to myself.  We spent the next several minutes getting a lesson in tampon insertion from our significant others.  Then we had to actually put them in.  It was uncomfortable, but we all managed to get them in without much hassle.  They told us pretty much everything we’d need to know going forward on how to use them.  I just hoped they wouldn’t interfere much with having sex.<br />
 <br />
“Now let’s do something a little more fun,” said Rachel.  “How do the three of you want to display…uh…”  Her voice trailed off.  However she began pointing down to her pussy and I knew exactly what she meant.  Somewhat unsurprisingly, Rachel and Joyce didn’t have any hair on theirs.  I figured that was due to their modeling backgrounds.  Pam, on the other hand, was completely the opposite.  She had a fairly thick-looking mast of pubic hair, much like Vanessa, Scott and I.  We had the excuse of ours having been left over from being male.<br />
 <br />
I didn’t have to think twice about what I wanted done.  “I want to get rid of mine,” I said.  I didn’t say it aloud, but I wanted to match Rachel.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked at me and said, “You know that’s going to hurt, right?”<br />
 <br />
“Yea, I guess so,” I said.  Then I thought for a second.  “Um, why is it going to hurt?”<br />
 <br />
“Because we’ll have to wax,” Joyce interjected.  “You can’t just shave it off.  Fortunately for you, I know how to do it properly, and I have all the things I need with me.”<br />
 <br />
“So waxing hurts?” I asked.<br />
 <br />
Joyce said.  “Have you ever peeled off a bandage?” she asked.  I nodded.  “OK, have you ever accidentally had a piece of, say, masking or duct tape get stuck on your arm and had to rip it off?”<br />
 <br />
“Sure,” I said.<br />
 <br />
“Hurt a little, didn’t it?” asked Joyce.<br />
 <br />
I recalled those moments and said, “Only for a few seconds.”<br />
 <br />
“Well, waxing is like that,” said Joyce.  “Only the pain is about a hundred times more intense and it lasts a lot longer.”<br />
 <br />
I certainly didn’t enjoy the sound of that.  “Maybe things will be different now,” I said.<br />
 <br />
“What do you mean?” asked Rachel.<br />
 <br />
“Since everyone is going to be a woman now, and since everyone is not wearing clothes, maybe there is going to be some other changes.  Like maybe since everyone will be a woman, doing something like this becomes more natural and doesn’t hurt like it used to,” I said.  While in some ways this theory could make sense, it would still probably take a lot of time for it to become fact.  Obviously my intent was to use the ring to spare myself from any pain.<br />
 <br />
Rachel, of course, knew exactly what I meant.  She walked over to me with a smile.  Then she tugged my head roughly to be close to hers.  She very quietly whispered to me, “Use the ring so you don’t feel pain and I’ll make sure you feel a lot the next time I fuck you.”  Then she let go of my head and said aloud with a wide smile, “OK, babe?”<br />
 <br />
“Understood,” I said slowly.  I did trust her, so I had no doubts she would make good on that threat.  “I still want to get rid of it.  I’d like to be smooth down there.”<br />
 <br />
“You just wanna match Rachel,” said Scott.<br />
 <br />
“Yea, so what?” I retorted.<br />
 <br />
“Do your own thing,” he said.  “I love Joyce, but I’m not going to match her.”  Joyce also sported the no hair look.  “I want to have, what do they call it, a landing strip?  I think that would look good for me.”<br />
 <br />
Vanessa said, “That’s what I want, too!  No fair for beating me to it!”<br />
 <br />
We all looked at Pam.  It took a second for her to realize all eyes were on her.  “What?” she asked.  “I’m not doing anything like that.”  She looked down at herself.  “I suppose I could use some ‘pruning’ though.  But that’s it for me!” she insisted.  Her hair was already in the shape of an upside-down triangle, which was something I’d seen before.  I supposed it fit with who she was that she wanted to remain as close to natural as possible.<br />
 <br />
“So where should we do this?” I asked.  “Don’t you need a table or something?”<br />
 <br />
“We could use one of the beds if that’s OK with you,” said Joyce. <br />
 <br />
“OK, let’s use mine,” I said.  “I’ll go first.  That way if it really hurts, these two can chicken out if they want.”<br />
 <br />
As we headed for my room, I thought I heard Rachel mutter, “Famous last words.”<br />
 <br />
Once we started the whole procedure, I quickly found out that I had no idea what this process would involve.  It felt weird when Joyce applied the warm wax to me.  It felt weird when she put down the strips of cloth on me.  Then when she removed them…it didn’t feel weird at all.  That was because it hurt like hell.  I yelled out in anguish each time that Joyce, along with Rachel’s assistance, yanked the strips of cloth off.  Pam, Scott and Vanessa laughed at me each and every time I cried out in pain.  I promised them they’d get to feel the same way soon enough.  I think my voice again settled into a higher pitch during this time.<br />
 <br />
Mercifully the process ended after about 20 minutes of near agonizing pain.  My reward for that pain was that I now had a smooth, hairless pussy.  “Ooh, this feels nice,” I said as I rubbed my fingers over the area where there had once been hair.  My voice definitely did sound a bit higher.  Earlier I thought it sounded breathy.  I still thought it did, but I also thought it possessed a kind of sultriness to it as well.<br />
 <br />
Vanessa and Scott had their turns next.  Even though they didn’t go with as drastic a removal as I did, they still got to feel the same pain that I had.  I enjoyed being able to laugh at them after they’d laughed at me.  Pam was able to escape waxing all together with what she wanted.  She just got a nice little trim.<br />
 <br />
Immediately after we finished with the grooming session, we took another round of pictures.  This was an important one because it showed that our faces were finally changing.  In terms of breast size, we all had C cups now.  The question was how much larger would any of them grow.  All of us were particularly well-endowed, as Joyce had the smallest breasts in the room, and hers were still a C cup as well.  Something told me I was going to end up with the biggest.  That thought made me feel pretty hot, actually.<br />
 <br />
Our faces were all noticeably different.  All of our chins had receded so that our faces were smooth and curvy instead of rough and angled.  Our cheeks had finished growing rounder.  My cheeks did possess a bit of that “baby face” look, but they weren’t fat or chubby.  Scott’s cheeks, meanwhile, had taken on an entirely new appearance.  His cheekbones had lifted into a higher position so that he now possessed that classic feminine beauty look.  His face was certainly turning into one that a model might have.  Vanessa’s cheeks didn’t possess that feature nor were they quite as round as mine, but they were definitely feminine now.<br />
<br />
We all had smaller noses.  Our lips were larger and fuller, though only slightly at this time.  I noticed that Scott’s eye color was changing.  He’d always possessed brown eyes, but they seemed to be turning green.  Neither Vanessa’s eyes nor my eyes showed any change of color.<br />
<br />
Just as our observations of more changes ended, another breaking news story hit the television.  What now, I wondered.</p>
