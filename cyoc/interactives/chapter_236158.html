<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a tuesday. The first tuesday of the new year.<br />
<br />
Eddy was walking home from his brother’s house. He had just survived his sibling’s traditional  new year’s party, and this one was more wild than the last. It took Eddy a whole day of sleeping in his brother’s bed to fully recover. <br />
<br />
When he walked outside, winter greeted him with hostility. Frosty air scraped against his skin as he weaved through side-streets and alleyways. Pressed snow that laird on the pavement tripped up his feet a few times. The quiet hum of the city and cars peacefully gliding past filled his ears as he walked. Above him was a sky fit for an oil painting; swirling paint-strokes of orange and pink as the sun was beginning to set on this peaceful winter day. <br />
<br />
Eddy turned into the wrong alleyway.<br />
<br />
It was narrow; barely big enough for a car, and one Eddy didn’t recognise. He checked the map on his phone, and it urged him on to go down it, shaving a whopping 2 minutes off his travel time. <br />
<br />
It was dark, and long, stretching through entire blocks of buildings, with fire escapes and balconies leaning out from above. There was no one in it that Eddy could see.<br />
<br />
He took a deep breath, and walked in. Into the darkness.<br />
<br />
By this time, the sun had mostly set, and the sky was turning black. The hum of the city had dissipated, and Eddy was met with nothing but silence.<br />
<br />
Until—<br />
<br />
“Oi!”<br />
<br />
Eddy heard a voice behind him. Standing on the street, looking into the alleyway, were two middle-aged men in dirty flannel shirts and jeans. One looked rather stocky in a flat cap, whilst the other resembled a lamppost; tall, lanky, and a balding hairline. A stiff breeze could knock him over. Eddy couldn’t see their faces, but could tell they were looking right at him. The lanky one was holding a beer bottle. The stocky one was holding a knife.<br />
<br />
“Are you lost?” called out the stocky one. He sounded drunk.<br />
<br />
Eddy took a few steps further into the alleyway.<br />
<br />
“No I’m fine, thanks!” yelled Eddy.<br />
<br />
“Are…are you sure?” asked the lanky one. He sounded more drunk, “we can uh, guide you. We kn…know this place ve…very well.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, like the back of our han’,” said the stocky one, “all we want is a…a bit o’ cash for our troubles, eh?”<br />
<br />
“No really, I’m quite alright,” said Eddy, “my apartment’s near here. I think I know my wa—“<br />
<br />
“GICE US YOUR FECKIN’ WALLET!” screamed the stocky one.<br />
<br />
Eddy started running. The adrenaline pumped through his heart and powered his legs. He could hear clumsy footsteps chase after him. Eddy sprinted through the darkness. The footsteps were getting louder. The men were getting closer.<br />
<br />
Eddy panicked, and lost his footing.<br />
<br />
He tripped over a large stone and hurtled towards the ground, the force of the impact bruising his chest and scratching his hand. His face hit the cold, sharp gravel. Before he could get up, the men had caught up. Eddy could smell the alcohol that stained their clothes. The stocky one of them turned on the torch on their phone and shone it on the injured boy. He pointed his knife at him too.<br />
<br />
“Feckin’ hell,” said the stocky one, “that didn’ last long huh.”<br />
<br />
“N…now then,” said the lanky one, so close to Eddy the boy can hear his raspy breaths, “empty your pockets.”<br />
<br />
Eddy looked at them, his adrenaline turning into fear. He could see their faces up close, and they were covered in angry smirks and eyes glistening with evil.<br />
<br />
Eddy had no choice. He reached into his pockets, taking out his phone and his wallet. However, before he handed them over, he suddenly heard a voice from above. It was calm, but loud.<br />
<br />
“Stop right there,” said the voice.<br />
<br />
Eddy looked up, as did the two men, and a shadow suddenly plunged onto the floor. The gravel dust blew into Eddy’s eyes, and as he rubbed them he could make out a figure standing directly between him and the two men. A figure cloaked entirely in black except for the head. The figure looked like a boy Eddy’s age; around 19, and had porcelain white skin and straight hair. His eyes were shrouded in a black mask, but his mouth was in the open and in a toothy smile. <br />
<br />
The two men took a step back at the masked figure’s sudden appearance. The lanky one pointed his bottle at him.<br />
<br />
“Who the feck are you?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Leave now, and nothing happens,” said the figure.<br />
<br />
The stocky one pointed his knife at him, and Eddy felt some relief knowing he was no longer the centre of attention.<br />
<br />
“You’re ju…just some feckin’ kid,” said the stocky one, “I could beat yer ass in seconds.”<br />
<br />
“No you won’t,” said the figure.<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah?”<br />
<br />
The stocky man dropped his knife and phone.<br />
<br />
“Wa…watch me. HAAAARGHH!”<br />
<br />
He screamed and blindly charged towards the figure, his drunken state almost tripping up his feet. The figure stood his ground, and buried his feet in the gravel. Then, Eddy watched as he held up an arm and pointed towards the stocky man.<br />
<br />
“I think I’ll make you the top,” he said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, his finger crackled with pink lightning as it gathered into a ball, before shooting out in a concentrated beam of light towards the stocky man. The entire alleyway lit up like a firework as the stocky man became completely shrouded in the light. It knocked the lanky man off-balance, and he tumbled to the floor. Eddy shielded his eyes from the light as he heard the stocky man’s scream quickly turn less raspy, and grow deeper in pitch.<br />
<br />
The light disappeared, and the lightning around the figure’s finger was gone. Eddy looked up to see that the stocky man had stopped in his tracks completely. <br />
<br />
“W…woah,” he said, out of breath, “what the fuck was that?”<br />
<br />
Eddy couldn’t believe his eyes. The stocky man had completely transformed. <br />
<br />
Gone was the middle-aged drunken buffoon. Standing now in his place was a six-and-a-half-feet tall muscular young man in his early 20s, wearing nothing but a tight red wrestling singlet. His muscles shone in the light of the phone that was by his feet. The singlet’s tight fabric hugged a defined a six pack that hung below two pecs. Broad shoulders held the singlet’s straps in place, and were connected to two impressive biceps. Powerful, thick legs held the man firmly in place, and a meaty bulge hung between them.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck did you do to me?! I’m…I’m…”<br />
<br />
The man looked down at his body, and slid his hands through his hair. The flat cap hiding his bald head was gone. In its place were thick locks of blonde hair that fell over his face, which now sported bright blue eyes and a jawline that could cut glass. <br />
<br />
He was no longer a middle-aged, balding drunk. He was one of the strongest and most beautiful wrestlers in the world.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit…I’m…” he trailed off with his new, deep voice. Even his accent had changed into stereotypical Californian, “I’m young again. And sexy.”<br />
<br />
The lanky man got to his feet. He was just as shocked as Eddy.<br />
<br />
“WHAT IN THE EVER LOVIN’ FECK!?” he shrieked, “what did you do to him?! CHANGE HIM BACK!”<br />
<br />
The figure moved his finger to point right at him.<br />
<br />
“You turn,” he said.<br />
<br />
The lanky man was starting to panic.<br />
<br />
“What? No! Y…you ain’t changin’ me! Do something!” he yelled at his friend, but the once-stocky man was too busy exploring his new physique to pay any attention.<br />
<br />
The wrestler was gleefully flexing his arms, cupping his biceps and working his way down his chest. Eddy’s eyes widened as the man’s bulge began to twitch, his thick cock coming to life thanks to the new waves of hormones that were flooding his body.<br />
<br />
“Damn, I’m so fucking strong,” he said, rubbing his hand along his shaft as his cock hardened to an impressive 11-inches long, snaking up his chest in the singlet, “oh shit, that thing’s sensitive.”<br />
<br />
He turned to look at the lanky man, who dropped his bottle onto the cold gravel.<br />
<br />
“No, feck this, I’m outta here!” said the lanky man, turning to run, “FECK THIS!”<br />
<br />
“You can’t leave. Every top needs a botttom,” said the figure, “and I think I’ll make this one nice and slow.”<br />
<br />
Before the lanky man could get even a few steps away, another blast of pink lightning gathered on the figure’s finger, shooting in a beam that wasn’t blinding, but incredibly narrow like a laser sight, hitting the lanky man in the back of his chest and straight into the man’s heart.<br />
<br />
He fell to his knees, clutching his stomach. He could feel the changes already working.<br />
<br />
“Please…I…oh feck,” he said, trailing off. His mind was starting to wander as he felt his body start to transform.<br />
<br />
Eddy couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The lanky man was just over 6-feet tall, but in just a few seconds he’d shrunk an entire foot. His balding hair grew out until it was black, and curly. The wrinkles in his skin smoothed out and a few freckles popped up on his nose and cheeks. His stubble faded away, and his Adam’s apple shrunk. His lanky body gained some muscle, particularly in the legs and thighs, which tightened his dirty jeans.<br />
<br />
“I…oh, my voice,” he said. His voice was higher, and more feminine, “this…I…”<br />
<br />
He couldn’t even finish a sentence. His clothes now hung loose on his body, but they slowly morphed and shifted, changing colours and fabrics until they fit his new swimmer’s build. The new clothes now resembled that of a male cheerleader, with bright red shorts and a white T-shirt with the logo of a nearby college on the front. As he got to his feet, it’s clear whatever objections he had before were long gone. He smiled as he flattened a palm on his thick legs.<br />
<br />
“I…my body looks so different,” he said, playing with his new full-head of hair.<br />
<br />
“It’s not over yet,” said the figure.<br />
<br />
He was right. There was just one more thing to change.<br />
<br />
The once-lanky man turned around and craned his neck to get a look at his ass. It was flat in the shorts, but giggled as he felt a tingling along his cheeks.<br />
<br />
The stocky-man-turned-wrestler also turned his gaze onto his ass, still stroking his cock through his singlet.<br />
<br />
Eddy watched too, shocked but curious.<br />
<br />
“I can feel it!” said the once-lanky man with joy, “I think it’s growing!”<br />
<br />
And, sure enough, it was. He moaned as his cheeks ballooned in size, spreading the fabric of the shorts until they were nice and tight. Just when Eddy thought they’d stop, they grew again, until they were the biggest asscheeks Eddy had ever seen.<br />
<br />
The wrestler’s cock throbbed as his mouth hung open in awe.<br />
<br />
When the transformation was finally complete, the lanky middle-aged man had become a short, handsome cheerleading twink with an ass that could fit a cock as big as a horse’s.<br />
<br />
The wrestler wasted no time. He stepped closer to the cheerleader and leaned in, the sexual energy from the pair grew thick and out-of-control.<br />
<br />
“Damn, your ass is so big,” he said, reaching around the cheerleader and giving one of his cheeks a hard squeeze. The twink moaned loudly as he looked down at the wrestler’s cock. New thoughts and desires entered his brain.<br />
<br />
“No…I can’t,” said the once-lanky man, “this feels wrong. You’re my…my brother-in-law.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll change that,” said the figure, flicking his hand in a circular motion.<br />
<br />
As he did this, his fingers zapped with pink electricity, as the same lightning crackled around the wrestler’s and the cheerleader’s heads. Their faces went blank and they stared with dull eyes as if they’re being brainwashed.<br />
<br />
“Whatever you were in your previous life is gone,” said the figure, “your names are Hank and Alex. You both go to Courton College training to be uh…sports people or whatever.”<br />
<br />
Eddy watched as the figure’s words travelled along the electricity and into their minds.<br />
<br />
“Your true passion however,” the figure continued, “is to be world-famous pornstars. You fuck non-stop, as many times as you can, and you never grow tired of it. Done.”<br />
<br />
The figure flicked his hand again and the lightning disappeared. The two men looked at each other with newfound interest, with any worry from before completely gone.<br />
<br />
“Oh fuck Hank,” said the cheerleader, “I’m so horny right now. Fuck me right here, against this wall!”<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah,” said the wrestler, “just thinking about your ass Alex gets me all riled up.”<br />
<br />
Alex wrapped his arms around Hank’s neck who lifted him off the ground. He wrapped his legs around Hank’s waist, and giggled with glee at the feeling of the wrestler’s stiff cock pressed against his ass. <br />
<br />
“Show me what you got, big boy,” he said, as the two began passionately making out. They began to frantically undress each other as Hank grinding his cock between Alex’s cheeks.<br />
<br />
As they continued, the figure turned to face Eddy.<br />
<br />
Eddy gulped. He was worried he was next.<br />
<br />
The figure held out his arm, but with his hand stretched open.<br />
<br />
“Glad I saw you when I did,” said the figure, “things could’ve turned ugly.”<br />
<br />
“Th…thanks,” said Eddy.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name?”<br />
<br />
“E-E-Eddy.”<br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you Eddy. Let’s get you out of here.”<br />
<br />
Eddy grabbed the figure’s hand and got to his feet, but as he did a plume of light sparked from their grasp. It crackled with the same pink lightning, but this time it zapped from Eddy’s hand, spreading all the way up his arm. He pushed the figure’s hand away and the lightning disappeared. Eddy looked up, and noticed the figure was just as surprised as he was.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit,” said the figure, “you’ve got the gift too!”<br />
<br />
“W-W-What?” Eddy stuttered, “what gift?”<br />
<br />
A phone in the figure’s pocket vibrated. He checked it and sighed.<br />
<br />
“Ah shit I gotta go. Listen close now, meet me at this exact alleyway tomorrow at midnight. Can’t believe there’s someone else with the gift!“ said the figure gleefully as he charged up pink lightning by his feet, “oh and, be careful.”<br />
<br />
And I’m a flash he shot up into the sky like a rocket, and was out of sight in moments.<br />
<br />
Eddy stared at his hand, and the tiny quick bolts of pink energy that zapped between his fingers. He quickly grabbed his things and looked at the two men that almost robbed him. They laid on the floor, naked, and fucking like bunnies. Alex’s screams of pleasure and cries for “more! Harder!!” echoed around the alleyway as Eddy left it. <br />
<br />
He took a different route home.</p>
