<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cindy woke up early in the morning and thought to herself &quot;That was the best sleep I&#39;ve had in forever. No interruptions either. I&#39;ve got to get Jane to let me sleep as a child forever.&quot; then looked around and saw a freaked out, sleep deprived tot in the corner. Cindy asked &quot;What-&quot; <br />
Then Vicki said &quot;Shhh... You&#39;ll wake the giants up.&quot; Cindy was confused about giants... and then saw her daughters now more than four times older than her and smelling of beer. Also the older Jess she could only assume was Kathy at the moment. She had seen Dolly put some beers in the fridge and kinda wanted one... but considering the way things seemed they probably were all drank. Vicki continued &quot;...don&#39;t let them notice you... then they wont crush you...&quot; <br />
Cindy kind of got ticked at the adults having scared the girl who was just getting comfortable and yelled &quot;Dolly, Jane, Kathy WAKE UP!!!&quot; as Tori seemed to merge with the corner some more. <br />
Dolly got up in her regular age and Kathy got up still a small child... with John being on the floor still saying &quot;I&#39;m... Up... I think... seemingly still drunk somehow.&quot; <br />
Kathy was rubbing her eyes and asked &quot;What&#39;s the matter? Did someone wet the bed?&quot; <br />
Cindy confused asked &quot;Wait... if your... That&#39;s Jess?!?&quot; <br />
Jess and the rest were waking up with all the noise and Jess rose up and with a splitting headache said &quot;Huh? What&#39;s going on and why does my head...&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;A hangover, What happens when an underage girl drinks a ton of alcohol!&quot; <br />
Dolly said &quot;To be fair what is an isn&#39;t underage is a looser definition with the whole Chronos thing.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;So it&#39;s fine to give it to someone who is mentally a child?!?&quot; Probably a debatable question especially if it&#39;s at someone&#39;s home and not at a bar or somewhere shady but not really the point. Dolly continued &quot;How much did Jane drink anyways?&quot; <br />
Dolly said &quot;No more than me or Jess, guess Jil-&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Jane, we should be calling her Jane to get her used and avoid confusion.&quot;<br />
John spouted out &quot;I like John!&quot;  <br />
Naomi was confused but Yui knowing they wouldn&#39;t be getting to sleep decided to take a bath together. <br />
Dolly said &quot;As I was saying. the J-Priestess here is probably an incredible lightweight.&quot; <br />
John stumbled herself up and said &quot;See I&#39;m totally up and good to go...&quot; <br />
Dolly thought and asked &quot;Why doesn&#39;t Jill pro or regre-&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Seriously we&#39;re transitioning her to Jane not Jill.&quot; <br />
Dolly grumbled something about preferring Jill then continued &quot;Why doesn&#39;t Jane just time away the alcohol?&quot; Drunk John liked the idea and started to shrink herself... didn&#39;t quite stop at teen John. Drunk time magic was probably a bad idea in general as shown by loli John being loli John now and the fact that her face was red and she seemed to be teetering a lot. <br />
With slurred speech John said &quot;Know what?... Between Dolly being isolated and Ma needing to grade stuff... haven&#39;t really had much chance to say I love you to you guys that much... I LOOOOOVE YOU TWO!!!.. Maybe they can squeeze a third kid in the tub...&quot; then John turned around and tripped and fell on the floor.  <br />
Little Cindy ran to her child and checked on her muttering &quot;...ok... Least she didn&#39;t hit her head...&quot; <br />
John muttered &quot;Why&#39;s the floor moving around?&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Jane if you can hear me, grow me back into an adult so I can bring you to your room.&quot; <br />
John responded &quot;Alrighty! One Agey Wagey coming right up!&quot; John let loose her magic and... Well it was loose magic. <br />
Cindy looked to her still small hands and arms and said &quot;I don&#39;t feel-&quot; looking around she saw the Young Adult Jess shrink a little, her adult features getting a little softer. She wasn&#39;t becoming a child again but a teenager. <br />
Dolly said &quot;Well... she seems like a teen. Probably a bad idea to have drunk Ji-&quot; Dolly was interrupted from saying Jill not by her mother but from some adult seeming shrieks from the bathroom. Cindy groaned the child she was wanting to be done with all this work but the adult in her knowing she needed to take charge. <br />
Cindy said &quot;Dolly bring Jane to her room. I&#39;ll check on everyone in the bathroom.&quot; Dolly took her child sister in her arms, and John seemed to accept it curling into her arms... She was kinda cute like this... given mentally she was a drunk teenage guy but it was hard to think of John as that right now. Probably why Dolly took a little longer going up the stairs than she should&#39;ve. <br />
<br />
Cindy knocked on the door and asked &quot;Are you all alright in there?!?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;We kinda got the floor wet, but we&#39;re unharmed... Just young adults. We could use some clothes though. Think we could borrow some of Dolly&#39;s and... maybe one set of yours Ms. Mavis?&quot; <br />
Yumi said &quot;Well excuse me if my body just kept growing like this! Ms. Mavis even better couldn&#39;t you get Jane to shrink us back down?&quot; <br />
Cindy sighed and said &quot;Well no, She got drunk and still is. That&#39;s why your grew so big and she&#39;s probably going to be sleeping it off for awhile so I&#39;ll go find you some clothes to borrow. At least it&#39;s a weekend so you all being adults and me being a child wont matter as much.&quot; <br />
Kathy thought and said &quot;If you could go through my bag I actually brought some clothes that came with this type of body.&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Alright, well give me a little bit while I run as fast as my little legs will let me.&quot; <br />
Yumi got annoyed and said &quot;I&#39;ve seen how fast those little legs can take you!!!&quot; and Yumi was kinda right as Cindy was already gone and didn&#39;t hear Yumi&#39;s words. <br />
<br />
Kathy had her business suit she was aged into at school. It was a little loose as she was a little younger than before, but not by much. Dolly had a some old underwear which fit Naomi well enough, and with a pink shirt, cute skirt, and a light coat she made a pretty young lady. Yumi on the other hand had generous assets as a teen... and it seemed that some god had plans to continue to give and give. Cindy&#39;s adult body was pretty busty as well, but only her most elastic gym clothes sorta fit adult Yumi. <br />
Naomi bowed and said &quot;Thanks for the clothes, they&#39;re a little loose but look nice.&quot; <br />
Yumi on the other hand said &quot;How do you expect me to go out in these! They barely cover anything?!?&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;I mean... they were the stretchiest stuff I had and... Well they were the Biggest things I had ok? So what if I don&#39;t have boobs!&quot; then blushed a bit and said &quot;Please excuse that... everyone else being so big kinda... makes you want to be big too you know?&quot; <br />
Naomi went and patted Cindy on the head and said &quot;Don&#39;t worry. Jane will get better and then we can all get back to normal. Hey why don&#39;t Kathy and I bring you and anyone else whose still a kid to the park?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;I like that. You all can get anything you want from the food trucks without worrying about diets or whatever.&quot; <br />
Cindy calmed down a bit and said &quot;That does kinda sound like fun... Kinda like playing tag with Yumi.&quot; <br />
Yumi said &quot;Interesting! You were the brat that kept sliding between my legs!&quot; <br />
Cindy had a small grin on her face for a second and said &quot;Still going to the park... rolling down a grassy hill, playing around in the sandbox... it just sound relaxing.&quot; <br />
Naomi said &quot;Ok then Cindy, let&#39;s go and get you and Vicki to the park. Sis could you stay and keep an eye on Jane?&quot; <br />
Yumi groaned and said &quot;Alright... needed to study anyways...&quot; although soon she would figure out studying would be hard with massive bust blocking a lot of her downward vision. Who will we check on now though?</p>
