<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty saddled into an ornate chair that was now twice the size a human would need and loved the attention of female Six as she cuddled into his side and absently played with his balls, the rather sleek and sexy West African giraffe smiling dreamily.<br />
<br />
“A-Are you gonna make all of us that huge?” Male Five piped up.<br />
<br />
“Hmm,” Ty smiled, staring down at Six. Yes, yes he was. He willed the female touching him to unshrink and grow to her full size.<br />
<br />
Six yelped and sat up sharply, eyes wide and ears back. Like Mel before her, she kicked her hooves at the sensations and let out a moan as she grew in size. From a tiny four foot giraffe lady, she expanded rapidly. Six foot. Eight. Ten. Twelve. Twice the size of a human man, the enlarged West African lady now straddled Ty between her tight furry thighs. He could feel the heat of her slit on his back and shuddered with delight, staring up at the big girl looking down on him in surprise.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that felt so good!” Six grinned.<br />
<br />
“In fact...” Ty grinned deviously. “Let’s do all of you at once.”<br />
<br />
The remaining 14 giraffe-folk all staggered and began to grow excited as hot prickles of transformation worked over them. Well, except Megan and Max. They were oddly composed as they enlarged, clothes and all, watching the process in fascination.<br />
<br />
His menagerie now grown to their natural sizes, Ty looked around at the plethora of hooves and patches on his anthropomorphic friends and blinked in amazement.<br />
<br />
“Mmmm,” Female Six leaned down, kissing the top of his head and stroking his chest. “It’s so hot when you transform us.”<br />
<br />
The Fours, the Kordofans, were at least a couple feet shorter than all the others, standing ten feet or so, and Ty focused on them next. Their small frames were adorable. The female had just a hint of breasts, while her male counterpart was almost androgynous in proportion save for his lanky body and obvious sheath and balls.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm...” Ty considered, rubbing his chin as Six’s slender fingers stroked over his groin, bringing him back to erection and grinding his ass into her groin. He could feel dampness behind him. She was a horny thing, wasn’t she? They all were.<br />
<br />
“Six... uh, Male Six... Hugh... you’re a nice little twink, aren’t you? A slim boyish little gay boy who likes cock and big guys to show him a good time.”<br />
<br />
Male Six gasped as he shrank a little further in height. His package seemed to lose size. He almost feminized a little, losing his masculine frame, but retaining his lanky limbs and willowy body. As his mind altered, so did his preferences, and he found himself staring at the other guys and especially Gabe with sudden interest. “Oh, wow...” Hugh blinked, his eyes becoming doe-like and sweeter. His demeanour becoming that of a little fuck toy who loves to be played with and bossed around. “Hello, boys,” Hugh said, his voice even growing a little femmy. This prompted a laugh of acceptance from all the other guys.<br />
<br />
June stared from behind the chair in shock, literally watching a new individual form from herself. She could see the moment his mental state and personality changed entirely. She was utterly amazed.<br />
<br />
“Now, our nice little Kordofan female, there,” Ty grinned. “She’s going to turn into a sweet little teen. About my age. A naive, innocent, slutty little girl with dirty thoughts. She wants somebody to call daddy. And let’s call her Luna.”<br />
<br />
Luna gasped, pulsating as she shrank down in age, turning from a modestly female giraffe lady into a positively adorable little teenage giraffe girl, shrinking drastically to nearly human size, losing what little development she had, eyes growing wider, curiosity rising, sexuality bubbling over as she longed to explore it. She had new urges for older men. The other giraffes glanced sidelong at Ty’s tastes, but whatever, why not?<br />
<br />
“O-Oh...” Luna gulped nervously, looking around at her larger taller and older cohorts. “I-I-I’m little.”<br />
<br />
“You are, sweetie,” Mel leaned in, stroking her mane. “Don’t worry, I’ll teach you how to please a man.”<br />
<br />
The young giraffe blushed deeply, her body language unsure, but nodded at Mel’s suggestion.<br />
<br />
“A loli-giraffe,” Six whispered in Ty’s ear. “You kink.”<br />
<br />
“Quiet, you,” Ty snapped playfully, reaching up and sharply pinching her nipple. Six feigned a gasp of indignation but it was really a gasp of excitement.<br />
<br />
Two by two, he went through the rest of the giraffes.<br />
<br />
The fives, the lighter framed Nubians, became complete ditzes. He grew the female named Brittney into a tall busty thirteen foot tall bubblegum chewing blonde with her mane styled into a ponytail and huge bouncy tits on her chest. The male, Chad, became a well-meaning but dumb as a rock eye candy male with as much depth and complexity as an empty kiddie pool.<br />
<br />
The sixes were fun. He decided to turn the female, Kim, into a brunette bombshell, accentuating her curves, swelling her breasts, making her firm and voluptuous, and making her a librarian type nerd who needed glasses. Her guy, Richard, became a typical dungeons and dragons type Star Wars geek, complete with buck teeth, slimming his figure, making him awkward and shy.<br />
<br />
The Sevens, the reticulated giraffes, became horny sexpots. He gave them both strong kinks and a preference for anything and everything. He gave Jessica, the female, a strong love for a little leather and pain, tapping into June’s S&M tendencies, while he gave Jack, the male, a nice big cock (but not as big as Gabe’s) and a healthy sex drive. The two were positively hedonistic.<br />
<br />
The eights became opposites. Female eight, Victoria, became a leggy supermodel just a little taller than Brittney but slim and small in profile, a vain fashionista with an arrogant streak and high expectations. Male eight, Tim, became a down home good guy country boy type with a thick accent, a heart of gold, and practical mechanical skills. His blonde mane rolled down in front of his eyes and his muscled physique seemed to have smitten Hugh.<br />
<br />
“Hmmph,” Vicky snorted derisively, staring at herself when she was done. “I’m going to my room to get some clothes. This just won’t do!”<br />
<br />
And finally, June and her new boyfriend Mike remained fit and athletic giraffe people. June, of course, remained herself, but Mike was essentially the devoted and caring husband and lover she deserved after years of Mark’s abuse.<br />
<br />
With the giraffes all individualized and fully transformed, Ty spent some time observing each of them and helping them become more distinct. Little by little he tweeked each, adding or removing personality traits, forming histories, backgrounds, personal details, and thoughts and beliefs that removed all hint they had ever been June.<br />
<br />
As they all began to explore the tower, find their rooms on the third floor, and enjoy warm showers and personally tailored clothing and belongings, Ty sat back in the massive and ornate dining room pondering his next move. He had, himself, enjoyed a hot and soothing shower as the giraffes settled in, changed himself into an appropriate size and development for his age, and now sat in normal clothes in an abnormal mansion.<br />
<br />
What should he do now? He could go play with the giraffes. He could find Mark, who was still presumably in his comatose state somewhere in the mansion. He could go outside and see how the world had changed as a result of his whims. He could find other animals, perhaps make them anthropomorphic. Hell, he could conjure staff and new friends. He could meet aliens. He could do whatever he wanted.</p>
