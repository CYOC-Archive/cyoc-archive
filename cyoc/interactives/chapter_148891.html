<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><i>It&#39;s amazing how intimately you can get to know someone through a single body part, even someone like Jen.</i> thought Nick as he felt Jen&#39;s sphincter squeeze as she hugged her friend. The drama club member watched Jen from a distance at lunch with his hand in his backpack. He fumed over what had been said about Jill and him earlier on the bus, as well as about how Jen had treated Ethan, the nerd whose game Jen had thrown. <i>If she doesn&#39;t need you or find you useful, she&#39;s a monster towards you. I won&#39;t forget that.</i> Nick had a dark expression on his face as he watched Ayame try to console Jen&#39;s &quot;mysteriously&quot; bad mood. (He was exaggerating, of course. While Jennifer Smith was a petty, arrogant high school bully, she wasn&#39;t Stalin. But high school is often a time of intense emotions and little perspective.) The dig Jen had made at Nick has especially disgusted him. Jill was his sister! Their parent were divorced and living in separate school districts so they didn&#39;t both go to the same school, but the two were very close and Jen&#39;s implication was enough to ignite his protective instinct towards Jill honor and enrage him.<br />
<br />
Nick realized he had started rubbing Jen&#39;s winking hole a bit harder as he mulled over it, and as he felt her anal ring squirm in his hand, anger gave way to satisfaction, if not outright glee at his fortune. Nick was just barely not a virgin, being too busy between schoolwork, rehearsal, and his friendship with his sister to give much more than an occasional effort at flirting and relationships, only one of which had ended in a hookup and none in a long-term pairing. But now he could &quot;hook up&quot; at any time with the lost & found hole of a certain cheerleader whenever he was watching some porn and wanted an easy lay. Even better, that hole was her anus, and not only was anal one of Nick fetishes but it also meant he&#39;d never have to worry about getting this cheerleader pregnant (he would have felt sorry for the kid). And best of all, the cheerleader that anus originally belonged to was Jennifer Smith, and so that meant he had no guilt at all about using it. <i>There&#39;s something poetic about an asshole losing her asshole</i> Nick had to admit.<br />
<br />
Despite his distaste for Jen, Nick also had to admit that there was a voyeuristic sort of fun to watching her out in public while holding the former centerpiece of her peach. Like blinking, people squeeze their sphincter a few times a minute, and normally this is an entirely-secret action that is almost never noticed even when one is naked in bed with the person in question. But Jennifer no longer had the privilege of even that level of privacy. Nick felt every cough, sneeze, and moment of surprise Jen encountered, all through the little starfish in his hand. Eventually, he wanted to feel it through the little starfish on his dick, but that would require time and training. Even though he hated her metaphoric guts, it would turn him off if he knew that he was physically injuring Jen while up in her literal guts. He wasn&#39;t a sadist, at least unless causing unwanted pleasure was sadism, and appreciating its one-of-a-kind nature he would make sure to take <i>very good</i> care of his new toy.<br />
<br />
As Jen & Ayame stood up from the cafeteria table (her anus instinctively clenching with the exertion as she did so), Nick wondered what Jen&#39;s PE class would feel like.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
She was going to shit on him, she decided.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer panted on her knees, having just completed her mile test for gym class, she schemed on ways to both determine who was carrying her anus around as well as get some revenge on the fucker. Whoever it was had been holding her pucker the entire time she was having lunch as well as the entire PE class that followed it. Her pussy and nipples were still safe & sound in her locker, which contained the bag with her bits inside, but she&#39;d been super nervous trying to keep any of the other girls from seeing her ass crack. While the rumors about her pussy were already spreading around school like wildfire, nobody knew her starfish was part of her &quot;procedure&quot;, and her thong was by now merely ceremonial as it was entirely superfluous to covering any naughty bits. <br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to her, the curse had reversed it&#39;s changes to her psychology now that she had lost ownership of at least one of her holes and revealed to all the thievable state of her other one.  <i>My mouth is the only hole left on my body. Pleaseee don&#39;t let that drop off that too</i> Jen had thought, because not only did she not want to be the supplier of any more living sex toys, she also needed to eat. Which had gotten her to think; if she needed to eat, clearly she needed to use her other end too right? And she realized that, as gross as it would be, she could use that to single out who stole her. All she needed was a good opportunity, and she had a perfect one. <br />
<br />
As soon as class had let out, Jen had speedwalked to the bus stop. Thankfully she didn&#39;t have cheer practice today or she would be walking home alone during the evening after everyone (including the thief, presumably) had gone home. Today though, she would be able to take the bus, which included nearly everyone she had rode to school with besides one or two people who got rides from their parents (and Brad, who did have practice today). This gave Jen a golden opportunity to execute her plan before the bus dropped her off, as she was the last house to be picked up but the first stop on the way home. She would do her thing, see who was the culprit, and take her ass back while they were still in shock over the development. This would....inconvenience everyone else who had to stick around in the bus until their own stop, but Jen didn&#39;t care as she would be home scot free and once again in control of all her genitals. As a bonus, if she played it right she could frame it like they had soiled their own pants, which would be as close to an equivalent revenge as she could get right now. She bided her time by talking with Ayame as she awaited her rosebud&#39;s return to her.<br />
<br />
After an unusually-long ten minutes from Jen&#39;s perspective, the bus had arrived. As everyone shuffled on, Jen could barely contain her excitement. Her revenge was imminent. As the door closed and the bus departed, Jen readied herself. <i>Now&#39;s my chance!</i> she had eaten breakfast and lunch and had the vague sensation that there was something to push out. <i>This is weird...but desperate times Jen!</i> she thought as, fully clothed, she clandestinely began to bear down as Tyra sat next to her. At the least, it was only as weird a sensation as what she felt right now, with her thong strap covering the blank skin between her cheeks but her anus feeling open air and her captor&#39;s finger. <i>Almost there!</i> as Jen felt her movement push itself down the final length of her large intestine, she could sense her impending victory.<br />
<br />
Then, nothing.<br />
<br />
Jen became increasingly confused as the seconds wore on. She gave Tyra one-word replies and &quot;um-hmms&quot; to what she was telling Jen as she continued to relax her hole and push outward. She had felt something until a little before it would have entered her rectum, but then a complete lack of pressure, as if she had just gone. Which would normally be accompanied with satisfaction if it weren&#39;t for the unexpected wrench it threw into her plan, as well as the confusing incompleteness of how the sensation felt. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Tyra asked with a raised eyebrow, &quot;You look a little sick&quot;. &quot;Oh yeah, must have eaten something bad.&quot; Jen played it off while her stomach did flips in anxiety for the second time that day and she kept trying to push in vain. <br />
<br />
<i>What&#39;s going on!?! Where&#39;s the chaos? Where&#39;s the stench leading me to the thief? WHERE&#39;S MY ASSHOLE?!?</i><br />
<br />
<i>Wait, that&#39;s...what the fuck! NOOOOOO!</i> <br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Nick sat next to the window in the front of the bus watching the houses go by. He couldn&#39;t wait to get home and start the process of stretching Jen&#39;s hole so that she could start taking dick in it. As he idly rubbed his new possession, he noticed her suddenly unclench herself completely, not quite opening her ring but making it much softer to pressure from the outside. <i>Softer, and more vulnerable</i> thought Ben with a grin as he leaned towards the window and licked his ring finger for lubrication. He didn&#39;t have to worry about someone seeing him as the three other students that normally sat in the same row were the three that received rides home from their parents. <i>If you want to start early Jen, I suppose I can wear my newest accessory home.</i> As he pushed in while Jen bore down, it wasn&#39;t long before Nick&#39;s finger was engulfed by the warm folds of Jennifer Smith&#39;s rectum as he treated her anal ring literally.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;EEEEEP!&quot; Jennifer yelped as she felt her first intruder break open her back door and take up residence. She reflexively thrusted her hips up to escape the penetration, but the finger inserted in her rectum didn&#39;t budge an inch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god Jen, what the fuck?! You&#39;ve been in a bad mood all day, but you won&#39;t tell anyone why. And now you look pale as a sheet!&quot; Ayame leaned over the seat to look at Jen with both concern and annoyance at the sudden outburst.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...really bad indigestion! Ate something bad today! Don&#39;t worry about it!&quot; Jen lied to cover up the fact that her anal ring was now someone&#39;s finger trap with no input on her part. She lowered herself back down to the seat, straightening her skirt out so as to play off her abrupt pelvic thrust. As she sat, it felt as if the finger were reaching up from the seat cushion to embed itself in her bowels.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, sounds like someone&#39;s going to be on the toilet for a while.&quot; Tyra chimed in, making a rare semi-dig on Jen. Jen, meanwhile, mulled over the fact that the only occasion she would be spending an inordinate time around the toilet from now on would be when she drank at a house party and needed to pee. <br />
<br />
The bus pulled up to the Smith residence as Jen sighed and softly replied &quot;I&#39;ll be fine girls, see you at practice tomorrow.&quot; The full weight of how badly her plan had backfired now dawned on her. Not only did Jennifer still not have any idea where and with who her butt was with, but she had given them an opportunity to penetrate the inner sanctum of her ass, and now her rectal walls were serving as the wrapper for someone&#39;s finger until they decided to pull her off/pull out of her. Even Jen had to admit that at the current pace it wouldn&#39;t be long before it would be serving as the wrapper for someone&#39;s dick whenever the muscle of her sphincter tired out from clenching as tightly shut as possible. At the very least, this would include whenever she was sleeping, whenever she needed to pee, and whenever she was startled. Not to mention that during whatever downtime her asshole&#39;s new owner had could be used to train and stretch out her starfish until it was the perfect fleshlight cumdump for it&#39;s new master, leaving Jen unable to refuse an assfuck at all. It was already halfway there, as the curse&#39;s magic had rendered it a purely sexual organ and eliminated the excretory function that she had pinned all her hopes of recovering it on.<br />
<br />
Jen, in a slumped pose of defeat as she mentally accepted the intrusion, shuffled off the bus after checking that her bag & wallet were still on her, not even bothering to notice the other students she was passing by, which included a Nick that had his hands in his bag avoiding eye contact in an effort to escape that notice. She had walked out to the bus that day bursting with confidence and poise; now she walked back into her house with an air of despair. Closing the door, she immediately bent over and hiked up her skirt, frantically grasping and pushing at the blank spot between the full globes of her booty while she shook it up & down in an outburst of desperation. All the while, the finger continued to tease her insides as it had continuously been doing since before she got off her seat, almost seeming to taunt her inability to expel it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh, hope someone found her keys.&quot; said the bus driver as he turned the corner to head to the next stop. <i>Someone certainly did</i> thought Nick as Jen&#39;s frantic motions translated to a staccato squeezing of her anal ring around his finger. It was barely noticeable visually, as he looked down on his seemingly four-fingered hand, but he felt every pulse and could guess how animated the display must have been in the Smith&#39;s foyer. He continued to rub the wall of the hole he would be enjoying for a long time.</p>
