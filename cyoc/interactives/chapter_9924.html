<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh had stopped going through the book. Watching his brother, well, actually, brothers going at it was much more interesting. <br />
<br />
The twins didn't even notice Josh was watching. Ric in his tall high school-sized body had his cock all the way into Franky's little frame. Josh could see Franky's small smooth abs tense each time Ric thrusts his cock back into him, along with his round firm little ass checks clentch with each re-entry. Franky had his head thrown back with his eyes rolling into his skull, moaning the entire time. Ric's knees were bent and Josh could see his long stringy leg and torso muscles pop out, each time he tunneled his way back into Franky. His arms were also flexing from holding Franky in place the whole time, up against the wall. franky began to go limp as the pleasure became to much for him to bear. Josh had witnessed Franky's cock get hard twice and soften back to normal size. He must have cum a few times already, Josh thought. Ric still had Franky's back pressed up against the wall and was holding him steady by his shoulders. Suddenly all the muscles in Ric's lanky body tensed up as he drove his cock deeper than ever before into Franky's now-stretched out boy-hole. <br />
<br />
Franky was jerked back into the present with this sensation, he felt like he was being torn apart. He looked at Ric with tears welling up in his eyes, and looked down to try and conceive the monster inside him. All he saw was his sparse pubic hair mixed in with Ric's own modest patch. Ric's hips began bucking and his load was squirting into  Franky. Franky squirmed as he felt the cum coat his insides. <br />
<br />
Finally, after about 12 massive jets of cum had been shot into Franky's hole, Ric stopped pumping. He just stood there, letting little Franky rest on his massive pole. After what seemed like forever, Ric finally began to get soft. He held Franky to his chest and layed down on the sofa, with Franky still on top of him, and still planted with his cock. As Ric's tool shrank it seemed to stroke every part of Franky's hole, making him quiver and shake. After about 15 minutes, Ric was almost out, Franky squeezed his cheeks together and he could feel Ric slide out of him, along with a plop. <br />
<br />
Franky got to his feet slowly, using the sofa to support his weight. He lurched ahead two steps and then stopped. He could feel muscles moving in him that he had never noticed before. He was sore from his encounter with his own over-sized meat. He bagan to take slow steps to the shower. His legs glided to easily, he realized that all of Ric's jizz must be ascting like a lube between his legs. Ric got up and watched Franky walk around a bit, getting used to losing his virginity. They looked down at each other. Josh was drenched in sweet from watching his brothers, so were Ric &amp; Franky, but they were also sticky with cum. <br />
<br />
All three boys stumbled their way to the bathroom, all the while examining each others body. Josh had thought his brother's new height was amazing and watched his naked body move, eyeing how the muscles in his legs worked when he walked, or how the muscles in his back bunched up or stretched out when he shifted his weight. Ric had been watching Franky move, in his old body. He noticed things now that he had never realized before. While his old body might have been small, he was pretty cute. He knew that cuteness would give way to a handsome face as he got older. Franky had the hardest time, mostly because he was observing everyone, including himself. He would compare his current body to what he could remember of his original one, or to Ric's bean poled body. He saw similarites between his body and Josh's, like they had exactly the same eyes.<br />
<br />
Eventually, the boys reached the masterbath. Franky had his home installed with a luxury bath and shower. It was big enough for all three of them to fit into comfortably. With massaging jets of hot water pounding them from the ceiling and the walls, all controlled by gold plated fixures. They washed their bodies in silence still gawking at each other and memorizing the little details about their new forms. <br />
<br />
When they were all clean and dressed, they sat down together on the living room sofa, which had witnessed so many orgasms these past few hours. JOsh had been getting more and more depressed. He saw the other two boys marvel at their strange new bodies, but he had not been changed in any way. The other two noticed this, and asked JOsh what was wrong. Josh explained. He felt like he was being left out. The Twins told him he could decide what to do next, and to make it more interesting, they told him, it didn't have to be here in the house, it could be anywhere.<br />
<br />
Josh's face lit up with excitement. He said he wanted to go to the public pool, he knew some people down their, he could change them if he wanted to. But first, he decided, he wanted to change himself. He told Ric &amp; Franky. <br />
<br />
Josh had been an active kid. He had a slight tan on his face, forearms, and shins. He had a visible sock line, and other tan lines were his shirts and shorts ended, he skin got even lighter, the higher up his legs you went, although he still had some natural color, so he wasnt complety pale. That was the first thing that changed, as Ric &amp; Franky finished reading the spell. They had moved to the Master bedroom with its full size mirrors to recite the spell, they had even set up a camcorder. The areas that already had a tan got darker, the tan started to slowly creep out from his face, shins, and forearms. His feet got darker and darker until they matched his legs, the tan spread, past his knees and up his thighs, slowly darkening his skin. It traveled down his neck and criss-crossed his chest, following the viens that were quickly disappering under the golden skin. His biceps got dark, and the color quickly took his back. He looked down, as the tan surronded his tiny cockand balls and then flooded into them. Josh looked the same, only now, he looked like he had spent everyday of his life almost, naked in the sun. His head began to itch. Josh could see his hair crimple and straighten back out, now with new colors in it. He could still find a few strands of his dark brown hair, but now it was mostly light, in fact, he could spot a good deal of blond hairs mixed in. So this is my hair would look like if I had spent everyday in the pool. His muscles began to feel stiff and tired, like he had been working out all day. He watched on as his body seem to drop away most of his baby fat. His body now began to grow his new muscles. His pecs stood out just a little, nothing special, but for a 12 year old, it was amazing. His calves curved out wards more, so did the rest of his legs, as the muscles grew toned and firm. His firm small belly was suddenly sucked in to him as he saw the very beginnings of an 8 pack form. His arms seemed to swell in certain spots. It looked like he had a tennis ball in each arm, instead of a bicep, and his muscles in forearm had grow out, too. All of this wouldn't be to impressive for most adults, but josh was a kid, and he wanted to have the best body in his school, and no one was as cut as he was now. The final change was happening. His sack dropped an inch lower to accmodate his new larger balls, and his cock snaked out just by an inch and a half, still nothing amazing, but to a middle schooler, he was perfect.<br />
<br />
Now, Josh said, we can go to the pool.</p>
