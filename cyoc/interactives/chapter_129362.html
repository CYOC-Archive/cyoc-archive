<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Mark opened his eyes the first thing he noticed was that he was face to face with Rebecca. She was still sleeping soundly and sucking on her pacifier, completely oblivious to the world and looking so innocent and peaceful.<br />
<br />
Once again he found himself staring at his new sister and thinking how cute and adorable she looked.<br />
<br />
Breathing in Mark could still smell the stench of their diapers and remember the poo poos they both made the previous night. When he had first gone it had felt warm and good but now after sitting in his Pamper for a few hours it was cold and uncomfortable. Realizing that they needed to be changed into fresh clean ones he started to gently nudge Rebecca awake, even though it killed him to have to ruin the vision of the sleeping beauty before him.<br />
<br />
After a couple of pokes the other toddler began to stir, her eyes slowly opening. Letting out a cute yawn she allowed her pacifier to fall out of her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Good morning Marky” she said with a smile, “Did you sleep well?”<br />
<br />
He was surprised by how cheerful she sounded for a three year old just waking with a full and smelly Pamper.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh, but I really need a new diapy and so do you” Mark answered with a grin after removing his pacifier.<br />
<br />
Rebecca blinked before feeling the weight in the back of her diaper and nodded her head, “Oh yeah”<br />
<br />
“By the way how did you sleep Becky?” he asked being polite.<br />
<br />
“Well how do you think? Like a baby of course!” she answered.<br />
<br />
The two toddlers shared a good laugh at that.<br />
<br />
It was then that you were both struck the same urge, you both needed to pee. Being younger Mark only had a few seconds before he started letting go into the confines of his padding with a light hissing sound. Rebecca on the other hand could have held it in for a while but ended up letting go right away. The two toddlers sighed in relief as they emptied their full bladders, happily peeing in their Pampers and causing the fronts to turn a shade of yellow.<br />
<br />
After he finished Mark stood up to admire his well used padding, liking how it sagged in the front and back because of his accidents.<br />
<br />
“It still surprises me how good a well used diaper can feel” he said voicing his thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Same here. When I first made poopie at the park I thought it was uncomfortable to have so much poo in them. But after doing it a second time last night I now realize the more the better!” she agreed with her little brother.<br />
<br />
Also standing up in the crib she gave her padded rear a wriggle, “Oooh my Pampers feel so nice and full” Rebecca announced with a bit of a moan.<br />
<br />
Mark giggled before going back to looking at and inspecting his own garment.<br />
<br />
Playing the part of a curious toddler she came closer and started feeling her brother’s diaper with her hands, which he allowed her to do without a single word. Her eyes widened when she felt a familiar weight in the back that mirrored her own.<br />
<br />
“Ooo you didn’t tell me you made a boom boom too Marky. When did that happen?” Rebecca asked while expanding the use of her baby vocabulary.<br />
<br />
She had no idea he also made a stinky since the smell of hers was so strong it was masking the smell of his.<br />
<br />
“A few hours after you made yours I think. I didn’t do anything because I also didn’t want to wake mommy” he answered with a shrug.<br />
<br />
He then watched as Rebecca continued to invade his personal space by touching his Pamper in various ways, at one point pulling back the waistband and look inside at his poopy. She even went as far as to feel the front of his diaper, inadvertently pushing against his crotch in the process. Mark blushed at the action especially when he felt his wee wee stiffened a little. He bushed it off as a normal reaction from his two year old body, but his adult mind couldn’t help but think that maybe there was more to it than that.<br />
<br />
“You can feel my diapy if you want Marky” she said with a grin.<br />
<br />
“Uh thanks Becky” Mark replied, “I think I will.”<br />
<br />
Truth be told he was actually excited by the prospect but didn’t want to show it. Mark slowly reached out with his hands and began feeling his baby sister’s diaper. He liked the way the padding felt when he squished it with his fingers despite his fingers now most likely have the smell of pee on them. Going right for the best part he reached around her waist and felt the huge warm load in the seat of her Pamper, squeezing and poking it even as Rebecca began to do the same to the back of his. While the whole experience may have seemed weird to the both of them it was oddly pleasurable and made them feel closer to each other in an emotional way.<br />
<br />
The two toddlers continued to unabashfully explore each other’s diapers for a while longer before the uncomfortability of their messy padding outweighed the pleasure they were getting.<br />
<br />
“Okay we really need to get changed now” Mark stated firmly when his bottom started to feel itchy.<br />
<br />
Toddling over to the side railing of the crib he grabbed onto it with his hands, looking at the slightly cracked door to the nursery. Also walking over Rebecca quickly joined her younger brother in holding onto the railing.<br />
<br />
“So how should we let mommy know we’re up? Should we cry?” Rebecca asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and we should also do it together to make sure she hears us” Mark replied.<br />
<br />
The two toddlers both sucked in a breath before crying out in unison.<br />
<br />
“MOMMY!”<br />
<br />
A few seconds later they got their response in the sound of rushing footsteps.<br />
<br />
“I’m coming, I’m coming” Jesse announced as she walked through the door,<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong? What do you need?”<br />
<br />
“We need changing!” they both answered at the same time.<br />
<br />
She took one whiff and scrunched up her nose, “Sure smells like you do” she said as she walked over to the crib and began feeling the backs of their diapers, “Seems like my little babies made big stinkies in their sleep.”<br />
<br />
Mark shared a knowing look with Rebecca, grinning at the fact that their mommy didn’t know they actually messed themselves while they were awake.<br />
<br />
“Okay Becky time for you to pay a visit to the changing table.”<br />
<br />
Jesse reached down intending to lift her daughter out of the crib when she suddenly backed away.<br />
<br />
“No mommy, I want to be changed in the crib so Marky can see” she replied remembering her earlier promise to her brother.<br />
<br />
Hearing this Mark became excited that he was finally going to see what the inside of his sister’s dirty diaper looked like.<br />
<br />
“Okay baby if that’s what you want. Just give me a moment to get the supplies” Jesse said walking over to the changing table and gathering up everything she needed.<br />
<br />
While he was okay with being patient and waiting his sister turned out to be a little more demanding.<br />
<br />
“Mommy hurry, I wanna new diaper” Rebecca whined impatiently, stomping her foot while holding the back of her poop laden Pamper with her hand, “Mine’s full of poo and I don’t like it anymore”<br />
<br />
“I know baby, mommy’s going as fast as she can” Jesse answered as she came back carrying an armful of items. Dropping them inside the crib she unfolded the plastic changing mat and without waiting for the toddler’s approval picked her up and laid her down.<br />
<br />
Realizing what was about to happen Mark got down on all fours and crawled to his sister’s side, getting as close as possible without being the way. He wanted to be as close as possible for the spectacle that was about to unfold.<br />
<br />
He watched with bated breath as Jesse reached down and began undoing the tapes on her Pamper, ripping both free with ease. Now loosen she pulled down the front to reveal the largest brown turd he had ever seen. Rebecca wasn’t kidding when she said her poops looked like a mountain.<br />
<br />
“Whoa Becky that’s a really big poo you made there” Mark exclaimed at the sight, “It looks like something an adult might make.”<br />
<br />
“But I’m not an adult, I’m a baby” she giggled in response while kicking her legs.<br />
<br />
“You’re my little poo poo princess is what you are” Jesse teased as she removed and wrapped up the heavily soiled diaper. Pulling baby wipes from the container she began to clean the remainder from her tushy. Rebecca giggled as her bottom was wiped like she was a little baby, which she firmly convinced she was. Once she was clean Jesse sprinkled her with baby powder as she sucked her thumb. Now that she was powdered she moved onto the last step unfolding the new Pamper and sliding it under her. Rebecca wiggled in delight as her mommy pulled the front of her new padding up between her legs and taped up the sides.<br />
<br />
“All done!” she cheerfully said giving the three year old a pat on her crinkly bottom as she rolled onto her hands and knees and crawled away.<br />
<br />
Jesse then did Mark next, doing him in the crib since it was too much of a hassle moving everything back to the table. She changed his diaper with the same care and devotion she did for Rebecca, a few minutes later taping on a fresh one while setting the balled up used one right next to his sister’s. Lifting both of them out of the crib she sat them down on the floor while she put everything away and tidied up their bed. The two watched with amusement as she then grabbed their smelly padding and tossed them into the diaper genie.<br />
<br />
“You two go ahead and play while I get breakfast ready for you. We have a big day ahead of us” Jesse stated with a smile before leaving the two toddlers alone in the nursery.<br />
<br />
Now that their mommy was gone Mark voiced a question he’d been waiting until after the changings to ask his sister.<br />
<br />
“Hey Becky?”<br />
<br />
She then turned to look at her brother.<br />
<br />
“Yes Marky?”<br />
<br />
“Remember that idea I had at the park yesterday about us getting even younger?” he proposed.<br />
<br />
“Uh huh, I was gonna become two and you were going to become one so you could be younger and I could still be your big sister” she replied already knowing where her brother was going with his question.<br />
<br />
“So do you want to do it?” Mark asked hopefully.<br />
<br />
Turns out…</p>
