<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan wanted to fight it, she wanted to scream and pull away from the two figures who were embracing her on either side of her. To her right was the hunk of a man named Matt whom she had had daydreams about when she was pleasuring herself. On her left was a beautiful women named Amber who Susan would catch quick looks off while they changed in the backroom together and who always caused a flush to her cheeks. Being sandwiched between the two of them would have been a wet dream come true only a few hours…possible less than 30 minutes ago dream, however both of them had been transformed into a merman and a mermaid. <br />
<br />
All three of them did work in a mermaid theme park/strip club but they were actually real life merpeople with scaled covered tails instead of legs. Amber with her beautiful red tail mermaid tail which made her now brighter red long red hair stand out even more. Matt’s legs were now a long graceful single dark purple limb with a pair of fins coming from his hips. <br />
<br />
They were holding her down or maybe now she was holding herself in place.<br />
<br />
Her brain was screaming at her to call for help, to get away, instead she was moaning in pleasure. Her hands should have been pushing them away, instead they were pulling her two lovers closer. Her legs should have been kicking them away, while not losing feeling in her legs it was as if her legs were becoming one, because they were becoming a single limb, she was becoming a mermaid as well.<br />
<br />
What she didn’t know was that she was experiencing what future doctors would call the warping of the mind. It was a process in which the body helped in the change, be it pleasuring itself or trying to actually pull off human flesh to get the scales to come out faster. Sometimes the warping lasted a few minutes, sometimes hours or in some cases it never leaves. This was different then accepting the change that happened but was instead a drive to infect more people and turn them into merpeople.<br />
<br />
None of that was known to Susan as her changes had speed up as she reached new heights in sexual pleasure that she didn’t know was even possible and wouldn’t have been before the virus began to change her. <br />
<br />
Susan had always had short dark hair, she normally kept it in a pixie cut, her hair began to shift color turning from a dark brown to an impossible bright neon green color. Her eyes rolled back in her head as she let out a load moan as she gave in to the massive amount of pleasure her body was in. She could feel her legs had all but fused together, but what she was focused on was Amber’s hand which was fingering her while kissing the side of her neck. Not to be outdone Matt was sucking on one of her breasts which was growing in size while his now merman dick was outside his tail was pressed against her side. Susan had large breasts even as a human but as a mermaid they grew almost two cup sizes all the while getting firmer as new muscles grew to give her a natural bra. Her hands were returning the pleasure to her lovers as one hand ran up and down Matt’s dick while her other had grabbed Amber’s ass. <br />
<br />
She was lost in pleasure; she gave up the fight to keep her humanity and gave herself over to the pleasure. As she did scales began to form on her now fused legs, her tail was slightly longer than either Amber’s red tail or Matt’s purple tail. Multiple shades of green with a few spots of yellow scales grew in. Around her hips a classic membrane like break between the human upper half and lower fish half grew, this one a bright yellow. <br />
<br />
When that came in, she reached a peak, at the same time she felt Matt’s dick tremble as he ejaculated on her hand. Unnoticed to Susan, Matt’s other hand had been fingering Amber and a half second after the two of them climaxed Amber climaxed as well. All three of them stopped for a moment and took in the afterglow of the transformation and what they sexual afterglow. <br />
<br />
There were now two mermaids and a merman lying in the changing room of this bar/strip club, not sure what they would do now.</p>
