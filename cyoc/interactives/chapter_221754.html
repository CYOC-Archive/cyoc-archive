<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Rive. Any luck?” this Pixie cut blond-haired, sky-blue tailed, Caucasian mermaid called as Rive had guided you to this small collection of young adult mermaids. “As it happens Aqua. This is Nixie and she’s a natural” Rive introduced. “Oh...well. I wouldn’t go that far” you nervously countered. “Only did a test run of the start of the song and the renounce of magic was spectacular. Damn I would guess only the original mermaids that helped create the Lagoon had matches” Rive insisted.<br />
<br />
As Rive kept insisting upon this ‘talent’ you supposedly had a number of other mermaids of the group got involved in the talking. “So are you a...pardon the  phrase, pure female?” this African yellow-tailed mermaid with her dark-brown hair in long dreadlocks inquired. “Well I’m not transgender” You confessed. “Charybdis is just checking. What with the goal of this and if depending on if-” this Gray tailed Indian shoulder-length haired mermaid started. “It’s fine Jharna. So long as Nixie can balance out the power needed who cares as we get want we’ve been seeking” this Chinese-Asian mermaid with her haired tied by seaweed into a ponytail interrupted.<br />
<br />
“Just to clarify? Are you all...permanent mermaids here?” you inquire. “Well... that or working on it” Rive admitted “Just we need to do a bit of singing to some mermen gathered not far from here for a critical part”. “But you lack key strength for the song?” You continued questioning “Won’t they find it wired to include a non-permanent or a few?”. “Look we’re jumping that seawall when we come to it” Rive insisted in defence. “Rive am I-” the Chinese-Asian mermaid started. “How long have you wanted Kai. It’s this now or Poseidon knows what” Rive firmly interrupted. “I’m getting the feeling Rive’s the leader of this little...sub-pod?” you asked Jharna. “Very independent and against her former family’s traditions still practiced but not exactly...designed for the modern world” Jharna confessed “Is why she so quickly chose being a permanent mermaid within minutes of learning everything”. “Now come on and let’s get started” Rive call as she waved while swimming off to the destination to motion everyone gathered to follow her, you included.<br />
<br />
That destination being what appeared to be some sort of crop field collection if underwater based on the equipment, fencing and small collection of young mermen swimming about gathering whatever was growing...that honestly to you seemed very eatable. “Now remember everyone- oh expect you Nixie. I will partly intune my voice for you all to echolate” Rive started “From there just assure as your voices mimic my words they carry the magic”. “Alright” Everyone included you accepted as the singing started.<br />
<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Oh Hope and Love. We call to you&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Our Hearts we Open. Love we Crave&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;The Waters our Home. Hearts and Mind as One&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Love come true. Lust be gone&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;We beckon to your Hearts with ours&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Time and Fate. Ours to Yours&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Come and link them true&#9834;&#9834;<br />
<br />
As the singing went on it became like you were in a trance. And not just you as far as your somewhat faded mind could see as the collection of mermen from the fields were also charmed and had stopped everything. Just dropping their tools and slowly swimming towards the singing mermaids you were a part of.<br />
<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Time and Generations come and go. We all heed the call&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;This day we call to you our mates. Let’s let this cycle go&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;We call on Love. Call on Hearts. We true heed our Hearts&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Now come to us our males or rights. Together we bare fruits&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;This Day of fate has come. Now Together we heed the call&#9834;&#9834;<br />
&#9834;&#9834;Our fate of Generations renews&#9834;&#9834;<br />
<br />
Then while the song ended and the mermen were within close talking range rather than whatever charmed had overcome everyone fading it instead coursed a reaction...<br />
<br />
...without missing a beat these tentacle-like cocks emerged from the mermen, very erotic-like, while for you mermaids these openings that oh so happened to be linked to where your vaginas used to be as humans formed in your tails while your bare breasts perked up greatly and seemingly beautifully...<br />
<br />
...Then really like men, or mermen as it were, possessed the gathered mermen swarmed your group of now formally singing mermaids. Somewhere really deep down this was horrifying but this fear was so minutiae it had no effect as one by one each of the mermaids got their vaginas speared by these mermen’s cocks while the newly minted ‘couples’ entered loving embraces, floating off as they did so...<br />
<br />
...in fact you yourself has no resistance to the mere idea as this handsome merman about the same age as you with a ideal worker’s build above his dark-green tail mixing well with his ideal brown locks of hair chose you as his target. His cock driving deep as apparently these cocks were as stretchable as tentacles. Neither of you held back, your tongues explored each other’s mouths greatly, as your tails twisted tightly together he was rubbing your ass passionately, you moaned in pleasure as he buried his head into your tits. From the back of your mind you heard the words escaping your mouth “Deeper. Harder. Give it to me. Fill me”. “As you wish my dear. I shall do whatever I can to sustain you” the merman lovingly answered while your tailed squeezed tighter and tighter like it was trying to get a reaction.<br />
<br />
And as it turned out that reaction was the suddenly flooding of this merman’s sperm, his seed, flowing into you as whatever this singing had done to your mind faded. But if the merman penetrating you was also coming around it wasn’t stopping his body from filling in its part in the process while you could only stare blankly straight ahead as your body did as you possibly knew it would at this point and something about mermaids let them know for you could feel it as the seeds from the sperm now in you joined with your inner ovums beginning the fertilization process as you and the merman came apart.<br />
<br />
“Why? What...were you thinking?” the merman pleaded in sadness as you both lay on the ground. “I...I don’t...know” you confessed. “I’m sorry Nixie but it was fate” Rive apologised as she swam up, her body language telling you that unlike you she enjoyed everything without shame or remorse “As I’m sure you can tell. We’re all now pregnant, you from Zale of course”. “BUT WHY?” You demanded while grabbing her as best you could under the circumstances. “The merman group here were ideal candidates for us in body. But resilient to magicless convincing” Rive started “Complicating matters until I found you our magic wasn’t powerful enough for the mating song”. “There were other legal means I’m betting you could have tried” You dared. “Many easily trampled by lawyers of the contract kind” Rive admitted sadly “Only by starting parenthood as merfolk that a number of us want, some just to remain, others just out of convenience as that contract issues doesn’t affect them”. “Then just TELL ME. What’s going to happen to ME?” You demanded:</p>
