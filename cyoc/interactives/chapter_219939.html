<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Where are we going.&quot; Heather asked as Mel wheeled her down the walkway.<br />
<br />
&quot;The park.&quot; Mel answered. &quot;We have to introduce the new baby Heather to the world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean? What did you set up for this scenario?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather noticed that the neighbors were staring at her as they went past. Some looked confused, a few smiled, but none of them acted as if seeing a teen dressed as a baby and being pushed in a stroller was wrong. Then she saw someone else pushing a stroller down the sidewalk towards them. It was Mrs. Kinsey, a young mother from the next street over. Heather had babysat for her a few weeks ago. Her infant son was cradled in the stroller, asleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my goodness, Heather!&quot; she said as she drew level with them. &quot;When did you come out as a Little? I didn&#39;t even begin to think that you might be one, you never showed any of the signs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was a bit of a surprise.&quot; Mel said. &quot;But today is her first day. We made it official just this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Congratulations!&quot; Mr. Kinsey said sincerely. &quot;I know it can be hard to come out, especially when you&#39;ve spent so long flying under the radar. I didn&#39;t even suspect I might be gay until I met my wife, and I was almost 22 at the time!&quot;<br />
<br />
She lent down and placed her hands on Heather&#39;s knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just so you know,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I support you. Wholly and completely. Coming out is the biggest and best step you can take.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather just stared blankly at the young mother. She was starting to get some idea of what this scenario&#39;s rules might be. She opened her mouth to say thank you, manners were important even if you didn&#39;t fully understand the situation. Before she could get a word out, a strangely shaped rubber nipple was pushed into her open mouth. Her lips automatically wrapped around it and she began sucking it against her will. She crossed her eyes and could just make out the shield of a pacifier beneath her nose. She tried to spit it out, but her mouth would not obey her.<br />
<br />
&quot;So today is her debut then, is it?&quot; she asked Mel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mrs. Kinsey.&quot; Mel said with pride. &quot;I&#39;m taking her to the park so everyone can see what a big baby she really is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How wonderful, and please, call me Kate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kate Kinsey said her goodbyes and started walking down the sidewalk again. Before she got more than a couple of yards, she turned back to the two teens.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems odd to say this, since it wasn&#39;t that long ago that Heather was doing it for me, but if you ever need a babysitter I&#39;m available. I would love to take care of a Little. It seems like fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot; Mel said waving at Kate as she resumed walking again.<br />
<br />
Heather was desperately trying to get the pacifier out of her mouth now. She reached up to grab it by the ring but her fingers seemed to keep missing. Her mouth was fully committed to sucking on the strangely shaped nipple despite what her brain wanted. She twisted in her seat and looked up at Mel, begging with her eyes for her friend to remove her gag. Mel just giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;ll keep that in for a little bit. It will stop you from interrupting me while I bring you up to speed on what Au Pair-adise does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel walked slowly and methodically, taking the long route to the park so that more people would see and react to Heather. As she walked, she explained what settings she had chosen for their tandem scenario.<br />
<br />
&quot;In this world, people can become Little. It&#39;s just like being gay, and in fact, here it&#39;s actually part of the LGBTQ grouping. Just like with being gay, there are often tell-tale signs as a child is growing up that they might be Little. Some of them hide it, some embrace it, some don&#39;t even notice until one day the realization just hits. Coming out as a Little is a big deal. As big as coming out as gay. I&#39;m a registered Au Pair. That means I am licensed to care for Littles like you full time. I thought about having you be an established Little, but I decided it would be more fun if this was your coming out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#39;Fun for me,&#39; Heather thought darkly, &#39;Or fun for you?&#39;<br />
<br />
&quot;As far as everyone is concerned, up until now you&#39;ve been a perfectly normal teenage girl. No one had any idea that you might be Little. This means that everyone who knows you will be quite shocked to see you like this. Even if it isn&#39;t out of the ordinary here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel gestured towards another stroller on the opposite sidewalk. A man in his mid-thirties was sitting in it, being pushed by an older woman who wore a uniform similar to Mel&#39;s. The man was wearing nothing but an obviously used diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;See. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see more Littles of all ages as we get closer to the park. And I do mean all ages. Some people come out as children, others can take quite a bit longer. All of them are accepted. For the most part, at least. There are a few religious and political groups that oppose it, but being Little is a protected status. Oh, and I made sure that you were one of the types that never showed any outward sign, and were even a bit critical of Littles in general, just to spice things up. People that know you are going to react a lot more than they would if anyone else were to come out. And I expect that we will meet quite a few of those people today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mel pushed the stroller around the corner into the park. It hadn&#39;t changed much, except the play structure had been expanded with larger sections so the bigger Littles could join in. Heather could see a few of them now. A handful of younger kids, one or two teens like herself, and a range of adults in various states of baby dress from only diapers to elaborate party dresses cut to showcase the thick padding underneath. There were a group of Au Pairs sitting off to one side, chatting with each other and occasionally calling out to their charges. A few of the Littles were there with their parents and one woman was being carried around by a man that Heather assumed must be her husband.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mel!&quot; A voice called out. &quot;Who&#39;ve you got with you there? I didn&#39;t know you&#39;d finished your training already. Who&#39;d you get assigned?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather turned and blanched when she saw Amy Neilson, ranking member of her school&#39;s most popular clique, striding towards them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit!&quot; Amy exclaimed loudly. &quot;Is that Heather Linton? Heather Linton is a Little?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tried to squirm back into her seat as the tall, blonde Amy nearly ran the last few yards to intercept them. The diapered teen tried not to meet the other girl&#39;s eyes, but could clearly see the massive grin on her face. Amy was one of those girls that lived for gossip, and if what Mel said was true, that Heather had spent her life in this world being disparaging towards Littles, then her actually being one would be extremely juicy gossip indeed. Amy&#39;s grin grew even wider as she took in the scene before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Little Heather Linton.&quot; Amy said, her voice dripping with honey. &quot;I can&#39;t wait for everyone to see this. Just last week you were saying that Littles should keep their business in private, and now here you are. This is so going on Insta!&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather tried to shield her face as Amy&#39;s phone came up and began clicking away, but her limbs seemed to have lost coordination. She flailed ineffectively as the popular girl took pictures from several angles. As she crouched in front of the stroller to get a low-angle shot, the blonde teen stared at Heather&#39;s crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh dear.&quot; she said, her voice so sweet it could give you cavities. &quot;I think Little baby Heather needs a change Mel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked down in horror. Sure enough, she could see her diaper swelling under the crotch of her onesie, though she couldn&#39;t feel herself going. She did notice that it was suddenly significantly warmer in her lower regions though. Amy made sure to get as many shots as possible before she had finished. Mel reached down and gave the diaper a gentle squeeze, of which Amy got several pictures.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Mel said. &quot;These diapers a extremely absorbent. A small wetting like this isn&#39;t enough to require a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww.&quot; Amy pouted. &quot;I was hoping to get some pictures though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Another time.&quot; Mel chuckled. &quot;Right now we&#39;re in the middle of Heather&#39;s debut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what a debut it is!&quot; Amy crowed, tapping away at her phone. &quot;I think half the school follows me so baby Heather is going to be the talk of the town before the day is out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m certain she will.&quot; Mel purred. &quot;I&#39;m going to take her for a walk-about now. We&#39;ll be sure to see you again soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ta!&quot; Amy said in a fake posh accent as she turned and skipped away. Heather could hear her phone chiming non-stop as she did.<br />
<br />
Mel did several laps of the park&#39;s perimeter jogging path. They ran into several more people that Heather knew from around town and Mel stopped to chat with each and every one of them. As time went on more and more of them were Heather&#39;s classmates. Word was getting around thanks to Amy and everyone wanted to see for themselves if it was true. Heather was forced to endure embarrassment after embarrassment as they all stopped to comment on her current state. The worst was Lizzie Cormack.<br />
<br />
Back in the real world, Lizzie was known to be incontinent. It was some developmental thing that caused her to have an extremely weak bladder and only a tenuous grip on her bowels. Her wettings were so heavy that she was forced to wear some rather thick diapers to avoid leaking. Diapers thick enough that she had long ago given up trying to hide them. People had been rather cruel to her at first, but age and some rather aggressive punishments from the school faculty had put a stop to almost all of it. Heather had never had anything negative to say about the girl, and never even joined in with the teasing under peer pressure. She tended to just try and pull people away without addressing the subject. The coward&#39;s way out.<br />
<br />
In this world, as Heather was quick to learn, Lizzie was the head of the school&#39;s Little club. Gone were the loose skirts and baggy pants. Lizzie wore her diaper openly and proudly. And what a diaper it was. Heather had never seen one so thick. It was a cloth one with a Japanese-style cover. It was so thick that it held the girl&#39;s legs wide as she sat in her stroller. Heather doubted she could even crawl with a diaper so thick. The only other clothing she wore was a bib that bore the legend &#39;Little Pride!&#39; and had a rainbow building block printed on it. It did nothing to hide her c-cup breasts and Heather could not help but stare as they jiggled when Lizzie talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;And of course you will be joining.&quot; Lizzie said pompously. &quot;Every other Little in school is a member and I expect you to submit your application before the summer ends. I also expect a full apology in front of the entire school for your comments last week. I&#39;ll arrange something with the pep club and we can have you give it during our first pep rally of the school year.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather just nodded dumbly. She of course had no memory of her comments last week. In the real world the only negative thing she had said was that the Magic club shouldn&#39;t be playing in the cafeteria. It had gotten her some flak, but mostly from the geekier students. Students like Lizzie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Lizzie replied. &quot;And make sure to have either your guardian or Au Pair submit the proper forms to the school during registration so they can get you a locker next to the changing station and access to the teacher&#39;s lounge for feeding. Too many parents forget that when they have a newly Little child and it causes problems for the office staff. Speaking of feedings, Marie! I&#39;m hungry! My errand here is done so let&#39;s go home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie, a large-chested woman in her early twenties, said her good-byes to Mel and pushed Lizzie away. Both Mel and Heather watched them go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Mel said. &quot;Now *that* was weird. Who would have thought that quiet little Lizzie would become loud Little Lizzie in this world. Maybe when we get back to reality we can try inviting her over for lunch, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather looked up at her in horror. She did not want any of this to bleed over into reality, whether by accident or on purpose. If Lizzie was into this, and she must be if the scenario had her in such a role, then Heather thought it best to just leave her alone. She had raised an important point though. It was almost lunchtime and Heather was getting hungry. Her stomach gurgled quite loudly.</p>
