<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After lunch, Eric followed Ben and Alex to their next class; math class. Also attending the class were the three teenagers that Ben and Alex warned Eric about; Rex, Harry and Larry. With the three were-elephants claiming the back of the classroom as their own personal fiefdom, Eric and the rest grumble as they take up seats near the middle of the class. It wasn’t long before an audible groan could be heard as Jeff Wilson enters the classroom.<br />
<br />
“Great, its fat piggy teaching,” a student could be heard mumbling. This gets a withering stare from Wilson as he looks at the student who foolishly spoke out loud.<br />
“Congratulations,” Wilson speaking at the student and at the entire classroom; “you just earned the first detention of the year. Stand up and take a bow.”<br />
The student too embarrassed after being singled out; just slinks sheepishly back into her seat, refusing to do as she was asked.<br />
<br />
“For the rest of you,” Wilson starting to write an equation on the board; “Find to solution to X and then solve the equation. You have five minutes.”<br />
For Eric the equation was easy. Using the PEMDAS technique; a way to solve most algebraic equations by solving the equation in a specific order, Parenthesis, exponents, Multiplication, Division and followed by Addition and then subtraction. Eric was quickly able to find the Solution for X and quickly solve the problem.<br />
<br />
The rest of the class groaned when Wilson announced their time was up.<br />
“I see all of you decided to forget what you learned last year,” Wilson staring at everyone; “did anyone at least find the solution for X?”<br />
“The answer for X is five,” Eric raising his hand; staring at the teacher.<br />
“And how did you know that,” Wilson looking at the fifteen year old.<br />
“Because I know math,” Eric rolling his eyes; “I even helped my brother when he was struggling with his.”<br />
<br />
Wilson looks at Eric before turning back to the black board. Looking through a text book; Wilson writes down another equation on the board.<br />
“Solve that then,” Wilson putting Eric on the spot.<br />
“Twenty five point seven,” Eric quickly answering.<br />
“Wrong,” Wilson looking smug; “the answer is six hundrend sixty point four nine.”<br />
“the answer in the back of the book is wrong,” Eric snapping back; “like the author, you forgot about the square root. In fact,” Eric looking at the teacher; “eighty percent of the answers in any text book are wrong. Be it by accident or on purpose; either way, I wouldn’t put much faith in it as a means to grade our work.”<br />
<br />
There were audible sounds of oohs and a few sniggers as everyone took delight in Eric knocking the math teacher down a peg. Even the student who utter fat piggy couldn’t help but giggle with delight.<br />
“Detention,” was all Wilson said.<br />
“For what,” Eric speaking back; “answering the question? Correcting you after you jumped at me for what you thought was the right answer? I’d like to see you explain this to the principal, let alone my parents,” Eric making it clear he wasn’t going to be cowed or intimidated; “so by all means try.”<br />
Another audible sound of guffaws and snickering erupted from the class room; the students enjoying the sight of Eric taking their teacher to task.<br />
“Report to the principal’s office now,” Jeff now angry; “the rest of you, I want to see you complete the equations on pages twelve through to twenty.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Waiting outside of the principal’s office, Eric could hear Jeff shouting at Principal Andrews; uttering all sorts of nonsense, claiming Eric was a disruptive member of class. Eric just rolled his eyes as Jeff continued to rant for seemed like another five more minutes before the principal’s office door opened and Andrews instructed Eric to enter.<br />
“I’m sure you heard what Mr. Wilson said regarding you,” Andrews speaking as Eric took a seat.<br />
“None of it very flattering,” Eric answering; “it begs the question, does Wilson here have the right temperament to teach.”<br />
“Shut your mouth,” Wilson snapping back.<br />
“Well,” Andrews leaning back in his chair; “you better apologize for that remark.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked at Eric; expecting him to say something when Principal Andrews spoke.<br />
“I was directing that comment at you Jeff.”<br />
“What,” Jeff shouting; “you expect me to apologize to him?”<br />
“Yes,” Andrews glaring at the teacher; “contrary to what you have said earlier, Eric is not a trouble maker. Eric is not a disruptive influence. You may not realize this, but Eric hear is the only student to get perfect marks on all his tests and exams last year.”<br />
“Probably cheated,” Wilson sneering; all the while glaring at Eric in an attempt to make him feel small.<br />
<br />
“Cheated,” Eric bursting out of his seat; “you have a lot of nerve.”<br />
“Sit down,” Andrews speaking calmly; “and listen. Jeff,” principal Andrews turning his gaze to the teacher; “while no formal investigation has ever commenced, do not think for one moment I’m ignorant of all the complaints made from various students in regards to your teaching methods and doling out detention for the smallest of infractions.”<br />
“He gave me detention,” Eric snarling; “just for correcting him on a math problem.”<br />
“Is this true,” Principal Andrews looking at Jeff Wilson.<br />
<br />
Jeff grumbled as he didn’t want to answer; he thought for a moment before speaking up.<br />
“Perhaps I acted in haste,” Jeff still looking piqued; “I had another student in class utter an insult that I heard clearly.”<br />
Eric snorted; “that’s an understatement. You blew up at me just for informing you that the answer you took form the math book was wrong to begin with.”<br />
“Ah I see,” Andrews chuckling; “Jeff you should know that the answers in the back of the text book were purposely wrong. It is a means for teachers to find out if their students are making the effort to learn instead of coast.”<br />
“Ben and Alex did say,” Eric shaking his head; “that Wilson here grades on an impossible scale.”<br />
“Don’t even think about giving them detention,” Andrews looking at Jeff; knowing full well that the teacher was chomping at the bit to dole out more punishment. &quot;If you have been grading your students work with the answers in the back of the text book, then it explains why there have been many complaints about you and why their grades are poor compared to the state mandated exams.”<br />
<br />
Before Jeff could speak up; the bell chimes signaling the end of class. Eric looks at the principal; and is thus excused to head off to his free period. A free period he has for his college courses; yet for the time being, doesn’t have to do anything but hang out in the library for the time.<br />
“I wouldn’t single Eric Anderson out if I were you,” Principal Andrews speaking to Jeff Wilson; “after what Julie Stovall tried to do to Eric last year. Two counts of Statue 1A…”<br />
“I’m not making exceptions for anyone,” Jeff being obstinate; “least of all him.”<br />
“Tread carefully,” Andrews staring at Jeff; “Eric’s parents are also teachers. The kid is dating Benton Knight’s daughter; and from what I heard, that man is not to be trifled with.”<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
Sitting in the library and minding his own business; Eric scowls as he picks up the scent of three people entering the room. All were-elephants by the smell; Eric knew Rex, Harry and Larry were approaching him.<br />
“There he is,” Eric could hear Rex speaking; “I want a word with you.”<br />
“About what,” Eric refusing to turn around.<br />
“About how you made this year for me and my friends difficult,” Rex blustering.<br />
“Stating that the answers in the back of book being wrong,” Larry speaking; “we don’t like that.”<br />
“Does it look like I care what you like,” Eric holding back a snarl.<br />
“You better,” Rex grabbing Eric and spinning him around; “you doing our homework for us.”<br />
<br />
“And just how do you intend to get me to do that,” Eric snarling; quickly removing his shoes as he explodes into his white furred were-panther fursona; “are you threatening me with physical harm? Are you threatening to kill me,” Eric flashing his claws; making the were-elephants back off.<br />
“Do you even know what it’s like to kill some one,” Eric in no mood for bullies; “because I do. I watched a man’s life fade away after I shattered his sternum last Saturday at the Knight estate home invasion. The life fading from his eyes as he looked on in fear at seeing me,” Eric growling; stalking Rex as he and his cronnies stare at Eric with a genuine look of fear. “So if you want to make good on any of your feeble threats,” Eric once again flashing his claws; “then by all means come at me.”<br />
<br />
Eric looks on as Harry and Larry stare at Rex; wondering what to do. The leader of the trio giving Eric a long hard look.<br />
“This isn’t over,” Rex glaring before walking away; “not by a long shot.”<br />
“Oh yes it is,” Eric growling; “you just don’t realize it.”<br />
<br />
Eric watches as the three leave the library; sighing as he got lucky with not being caught by a faculty member over shifting into his fursona. Eric quickly de-furs; being thankful that his clothes from awareness didn’t get destroyed when he shifted. Sighing as his socks weren’t so lucky; Eric quickly puts his shoes back on. Sitting back down as he once again goes back to the book he was reading before being interrupted by the Tusk brigade.</p>
