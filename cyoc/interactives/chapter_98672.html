<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Unconscious you lose track of time. There are moments, sensations, that something was missed. There are dreams, fragments really, and sometimes you can&#39;t tell if they&#39;re real or not. You remember the feeling of being carried, possibly even being in a vehicle of some sort. Another time you think you see a doctor, or maybe a nurse, over you. You can&#39;t tell. It takes a long time before you can even realize that the sensations you&#39;re feeling are happening to you. Your head can&#39;t focus. Maybe you&#39;re still sleeping.<br />
<br />
Yes. Sleep. You do that.<br />
<br />
Eventually you start hearing sounds again. Maybe you&#39;re still dreaming. Are you? Wait.... No. Maybe? No. Possibly. It takes minutes for you to realize you can open your eyes. It&#39;s difficult to. Bright light blinds you for a moment, but then it dies down. Then you realize that&#39;s because you closed them again.<br />
<br />
&quot;About damn time,&quot; a woman mutters from nearby. As you try to open your eyes again, you see a blurred form standing over you. &quot;Hey. Wake up,&quot; she says, hitting you on the arm with the back of her hand. &quot;If we&#39;re going to be doing anything fun, I&#39;d rather you be awake this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Raising your arm to shield your eyes from the light, you sit up and give yourself a bit of time to let your eyes adjust. It takes a few minutes, but eventually things start coming into focus. You also realize you&#39;re extremely hungry. &quot;W-&quot; You cough. Repeatedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a cup of water on the table over there,&quot; she says with a foreign accent, gesturing to the opposite side of the bed you were on. You turn.<br />
<br />
You finally notice that you&#39;re in a bedroom, however just beyond the bed and a side-table with a clay cup of water sitting there, a wall was missing. Beyond it you see a drop down to a small front yard. Twenty feet beyond that, there&#39;s a short concrete wall and what looks like a zoo&#39;s viewing area beyond it. Only then do you notice the wall in front of you isn&#39;t missing. It&#39;s extremely clear glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all you fault, by the way,&quot; the woman says. &quot;They were going to move me into a nice open forest-like pen, but no. You had to muck that all up. Now we got shipped off far and away to another one of their establishments, but unfortunately it&#39;s not one that has a similar exhibit.&quot; She sneers as she tosses a book she was holding onto to the side. &quot;We&#39;re stuck in playing Mister and Misses Suzie Homemaker!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thoughts of the firefight start returning to you. You try to speak again, but the cough returns. You grab the cup and drink. It&#39;s blissfully soothing and your body takes it in. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; the woman frowns at you. For a moment her teeth seem to sharpen into points. &quot;You destroyed my chance of moving into a nicer cell than the one I&#39;m in. Why did you have to start that fight just as I was moving in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You?&quot; Your thoughts keep reforming. &quot;You were the one in the box.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Rahela.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Meat,&quot; she says. &quot;One way or the other, you&#39;re just meat to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You drink more of the water. &quot;What happened? Why am I here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rahela smiles. The dark glimmer in her eyes make you step backwards. The glass blocks you from going further. &quot;You were likely infected by the other feral. After I was situated, they were going to try to get the two of us to mate. However your actions ended up getting him killed. So, now you&#39;re going to be my mate.... Maybe.&quot;<br />
<br />
The information she&#39;s telling you only somewhat seems to sink in. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
She continues. &quot;You&#39;ve been unconscious several weeks. Had a few operations to save your life. That sort of thing. However they couldn&#39;t keep you in the same zoo. You might have relatives nearby. So instead they pretend you got attacked by an escaped animal, they pay any family you might have that comes forward for damages, and you get shipped off to a foreign zoo to be put on display. As for me, well, ferals are tough to get into captivity. The bastards were lucky I wasn&#39;t paying attention last month when I was caught, but they still want me knocked up by another feral. So, since you had to move to another country, I had to move with you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What... what country?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m just stuck in a crate the whole time. I didn&#39;t even realize I was in your country until I heard the mushy accents come from your kinds&#39; mouths.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mushy accents? you think to yourself, confused. &quot;They.... they want us to have sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were infected. More than enough time has passed for an infection to set while you were out. Ferals can change at will, but the infected apparently need the full moon to kick them off the first time. In all honesty, I&#39;ve never met an &#39;adopted pup&#39; before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... I&#39;m a werewolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugs. &quot;We&#39;ll find out. If not, I&#39;ll probably just eat you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blink. &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, you&#39;re meat either way. Either what I put into my mouth or... into my other mouth,&quot; she grins. You can&#39;t help but look worried, realizing that you&#39;re now trapped in here with a crazy woman. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she says. &quot;With your injuries, you&#39;re very likely infected. Even unconscious I was able to get you aroused a few times for my own pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
She tilts her head at you. &quot;You say that a lot. But yes, you were unconscious, and I was bored. What do you expect me to do? Continue trying to figure out the stupid letters in that book?&quot;<br />
<br />
You swallow and try to put together everything she told you. &quot;Alright... But you said I&#39;d be able to control this curse?&quot;<br />
<br />
Rahela laughs.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I say?&quot; you ask, confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t control it,&quot; she says. &quot;I said you can change at will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What-?&quot;<br />
<br />
She walks over towards you, her evil grin growing, widening. A part of you starts to feel very frightened as some of her more feral features begin to subtly form. Another part of you is getting more aroused. &quot;You will change on the moon. You won&#39;t control anything. Hell, you won&#39;t even remember it. But after your first change, you&#39;ll come back as yourself in the morning. Then one of two things happens.&quot; She puts a finger up to your chest. She starts playing around with some of your chest hair, but you also notice that her fingernail has grown outward into a long claw-like shape. &quot;Either you decide to not change or you decide to change. Right now, there&#39;s a wolf hidden in your mind. It was added there by the infection. It&#39;s weak, and you&#39;ll be able to keep it at bay. But you can change. If you change, even once, then you&#39;re surrendering your mind to it. It will flourish and be born like a full grown predator emerging from poor weak human form of a womb. Your mind dies. It takes over. You will no longer be human. You will no longer be. It will be, and you won&#39;t.&quot; Looking into her eyes, you can see nothing but a beast before you. She stands there mostly as a woman, but there is no doubt in your mind that it is an animal in human clothing that stands before you... talking to you. &quot;Now if you don&#39;t change, the wolf hiding inside your mind, gathering up all your feral tendencies that you&#39;ve restrained for too long over the years... and it will grow. The wolf will start to gnaw away at your mind, distracting you, making you want to give in and let it take over. You&#39;ll WANT to let it devour your mind and soul, and in time, as the temptation and desire continues to mount... and mount... and mount... and... eventually... you&#39;ll let it.&quot; The guised female creature presses herself up against you, and you can&#39;t help but be erect in your own undergarments. &quot;You won&#39;t become the wolf, my poor Meat. The wolf will become you, and you... become nothing.&quot; She quickly reaches into your underwear and strokes you over and over.<br />
<br />
Dear God, you think to yourself. You honestly can&#39;t decide if you want to flee from her or take her now. In truth, the feeling of terror actually seems to be feeding your sexual drive.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, and without warning, she lets go of your privates and steps back. You gasp and stare at her. Appearing to be completely human, she heads back to her book. &quot;I might play with you from time to time, but in all honesty I don&#39;t give a shit about you. It&#39;s that creature in your mind, that&#39;s who I&#39;m waiting for.&quot; She sits down and opens the book to a random page, only pretending to read. &quot;By the way,&quot; she says after a moment. &quot;I think the full moon is tonight, or maybe it&#39;s tomorrow. Eh. Either or. I don&#39;t often pay attention to that sort of thing.&quot; Slowly her smirk returned. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see your mind die.&quot;</p>
