<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If I&#39;m going to stay like this for a while I can&#39;t just hang around the college. So, I wish I had a job I&#39;ll enjoy.&quot; Ryan looked over at the tattered remains of his tee nearby. &quot;And a new wardrobe to go with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz grinned. It was this sort of open ended wish that he could have the most fun with. &quot;As you wish.&quot; The genie snapped his fingers and the room around Ryan shifted. A moment later he wasn&#39;t in his apartment, or at least in a room he didn&#39;t recognize. There was no windows and just a single door. A rack held a variety of outfits on one side of the room, and other than that the only furniture was a couch, a low table, and a full length mirror.<br />
<br />
As Ryan looked around the room, he felt clothing shifting across his skin. Tight and form fitting. He glances down as the black and navy blue outfit, then at his reflection in the mirror. Was that really him? He recognized the face, but it was going to take a while to get used to that bulk. The almost too tight black trousers he now wore tucked into a pair of polished leather boots. Across his chest was buttoned a dark blue shirt, the top buttons left open to expose a few inches of hair pectorals. Insignia covered the shirt&#39;s short sleeves. The leather belt at his waist held what looked like a gun, a night stick, and a golden shield. A rather distinctive cap finished off the look. &quot;A cop?&quot; He asked, looking over to Gaz who sat on the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something like that.&quot; Replied the genie.<br />
<br />
There was a knock at the door and Ryan opened it to reveal a young man, leanly athletic, dressed in black slacks and polo shirt with a clip board in hand. &quot;Good you&#39;re ready. C&#39;mon.&quot; The man spoke to him with some familiarity. Ryan looked over to Gaz, but the genie just waved him on so Ryan followed the young man through the halls. Gaz trailed after him, just grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Ryan whispered to Gaz.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll see. I&#39;m certain you&#39;ll enjoy it.&quot; The genie spoke in a normal tone, but the young man escorting him didn&#39;t seem to hear the genie, or even see him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, good luck, man.&quot; The young man winked at him as he brought him up to a a side door. Through it he could see a stage with floodlights and a pole with music pumping in the background. The seats around the stage were filled mostly with men and a few women. Before he could ask anything the young man was off back down the hallway.<br />
<br />
From the main room he could hear a voice come in over the speakers. &quot;Up next, we have a Muscle Lounge favorite..&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, is this a strip club?&quot; Ryan asked with a bit of panic as he turned to Gaz.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I thought you liked dancing.&quot; The genie responded, looking far too innocent. &quot;You wanted a job you liked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know how to..&quot; Ryan motioned with a hand towards the stage. &quot;This isn&#39;t what I wished for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All part of the wish. A job you&#39;ll like. Just let your instinct take over.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the announcer called out, &quot;Officer Ryan!&quot; Gaz gave him a little shove onto the stage. Ryan stumbled the first few steps. He could just wish this away, right? He looked over to where Gaz had been but the genie was gone. He looked out over the crowd as the music started up, something with a deep, thrumming beat. He took a deep breath and started dancing. Gaz had been right, as long as he didn&#39;t think about it too hard his body seemed to know what to do.<br />
<br />
A few seconds in and he popped the snaps down the front of his shirt, letting it hang loose and expose his hairy chest and abs. Whistles called out from the darkened room. His routine involved a lot of flexing and showing off. Soon his shirt was discarded off to the side of the stage as he spent some time on the pole. It actually felt good, he was getting into it.<br />
<br />
A few minutes in he grabbed the front of his pants, knowing hidden fasteners kept the rip-away garment in place, specially designed to leave him in the cop belt and boots. There were more than a couple cheers as he tore away his pants, tossing them backstage with a flourish, leaving him with only a dark blue thong to maintain his modesty. He could feel the string between his exposed ass cheeks.<br />
<br />
Not that it hid much. Had he been that endowed before? It was definitely a bigger bulge than he was used to, but had that change come with his last wish or the one before that. He really didn&#39;t have time to think about it though as he danced along the front of the stage, patrons reaching up to slip bills in his thong or the top of his boots.<br />
<br />
The music and his routine soon came to an end and he sauntered cockily off stage, past the next dancers, a pair of tanned twins in Chippendale style outfits who fixed him with a pair of warm smiles. He grinned back and found his way through the hallways back to the room. His name was even on the door. He went inside, finding Gaz sitting on the couch again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So?&quot; The genie asked, curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant!&quot; Ryan shouted.  Embarrassment about what he had just done flooding him now that he had time to think. &quot;How is this something I wanted?&quot; He motioned down to his bulge. &quot;And when did you do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Gaz stood up and walked over to Ryan. &quot;Oh, that. Yeah, it helps in this job to be a bit.. ballsy.&quot; The genie smiled at his own joke, reaching down and plucking a bill from Ryan&#39;s thong, holding the fifty up in front of his face. &quot;Good pay though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan took the bill and started plucking more from the various places they had been stashed. Altogether he had about three hundred dollars in hand. &quot;From one dance?&quot; He thought wonderingly. He walked over to a jacket that hung on a hook he knew was his, fished in the pocket for a wallet and slipped the bills inside. It was already fat with cash. &quot;Well, I guess spending sometime here wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instincts were taking over again, he knew he&#39;d be back on in an hour with a different costume, but he started to strip out of what was left of his current one, even the thong. His manhood fell free, a couple inches longer and quite a bit thicker than he was used to. At that moment there was a knock on the door and the young stagehand stepped in holding the shirt and pants Ryan left behind. &quot;Ryan, it&#39;s Jason, you left your.. ah.. oh..&quot;<br />
<br />
The blond haired twenty-something was just staring at Ryan, his eyes wide open and fixed on his flopping cock. Ryan tried to feign nonchalance as he stood there naked. Jason finally looked away, holding out the clothes towards Ryan.<br />
<br />
He sighed and took the costume from Jason, not thinking about what would happen when he started speaking. &quot;I wish...&quot;</p>
