<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Ally went to get a drink of water, Kyle thought about his next move. He obviously couldn&#39;t cure Ally on his own. He wasn&#39;t magic; the coin was magic. He tried thinking about the coin. He had gotten it from a storm drain, so it was unlikely that its owner knew where it had been. The coin&#39;s owner... Since the coin disappeared, it probably went back to the person who owned it. That owner could fix what had happened to Ally. But he didn&#39;t...<br />
<br />
He slapped himself on the forehead. The back of the coin had said &quot;Property of Magika Inc&quot; Therefore, the coin must have been owned by the head of Magika Inc, Alfred Dormitabis. A quick computer search confirmed his suspicions. Entrancing Entertainment was hosting a TV show downtown tonight. They would go there, see Mr. Dormitabis, and he would snap Ally out of being a dog. At least, that was the plan. Kyle had no idea how he was supposed to get close to the TV star. Still, it was a start.<br />
<br />
He checked the time. The show wouldn&#39;t start until evening, but he wanted to get there as soon as possible to increase their chances of meeting the hypnotist. Now he would just have to convince Ally to go along with the plan.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ally was trying to get some water. She knew what she needed to do. She just had to grab a glass, fill it up at the sink, and take a drink. It would be easy. And yet, it didn&#39;t feel right. She shouldn&#39;t be the one getting water. That was someone else&#39;s job. Her job was to lap it up like a...<br />
<br />
She shook her head. Why was she having such a hard time with this? She knew what she had to do; she just had to do it. She opened up the cabinet. There were plenty of glasses in there, but there was also...<br />
<br />
A bowl. She could just imagine stick her face in it, lapping up the cool refreshing water. She would dive into the bowl next to it, eating the rough meaty kibble. It was such a good meal that her master fixed for her everyday, and she was happy to dig in and enjoy and...<br />
<br />
She pinched herself. What was wrong with her? She quickly grabbed a glass, and slammed the door shut. She started filling it with water. Cool refreshing water. She just wanted to lap it up so badly. She turned the faucet off, and walked over to the table, her arms shaking slightly. She hesitantly put the glass up to her lips, and took a small sip. Ally knew she was supposed to drink it like this, but then why did it feel so wrong? She sat the mostly-full glass down on the table, pondering this conundrum.<br />
<br />
Kyle walked into the kitchen, interrupting her thoughts. <br />
&quot;Ally, I know this is sudden, but why don&#39;t we go see this hypnosis show tonight?&quot;<br />
Ally scowled. The last thing she wanted to do was go out on the town while she felt like this.<br />
&quot;Hard pass.&quot;<br />
&quot;But..&quot; Kyle interjected. His plan wouldn&#39;t work if Ally didn&#39;t go with him.<br />
&quot;No! Just leave me alone.&quot; Ally turned her back to him.<br />
<br />
Kyle grimaced. He had suspected it might come to this. He didn&#39;t want to use the hypnosis any more than necessary, but he doubted he could get Ally to go in her right mind. He clenched his fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ally, a Good Girl stays by her owner.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, Ally&#39;s eyes went blank. She imagined a dog happily going on a walk. There was a nice thick leash attached to its collar. And holding that leash was the dog&#39;s owner. The dog didn&#39;t mind being held back. Its owner would cuddle her, feed her, call her a Good...<br />
<br />
Ally snapped back to reality. What was she thinking? Of course, she would go with Kyle. He was her... She wasn&#39;t sure if he was her brother, or if he was something more than that. It didn&#39;t matter though. &quot;Come on bro! Let&#39;s go!&quot; She was so happy to get outside and enjoy the fresh air. She sprang up from table, eager to get started.<br />
<br />
Kyle breathed a sigh of relief. Ally was acting, except for the sudden excitement, perfectly normal. She was already rushing to the garage, and he turned to catch up with her. However, Ally came running back to the kitchen. &quot;One last thing!&quot; she excitedly proclaimed.<br />
<br />
There was still that glass of water on the table. Ally was thirsty, and her confusion about drinking had vanished. She picked up the glass, tilted it back, and lapped it up like a thirsty animal. She didn&#39;t care that some of it splashed on her face; she was just happy to drink it the right way. She reminded herself to pour it into a bowl next time, as she raced back to the garage. <br />
<br />
Kyle smirked. Well, Ally was acting almost normal. He suspected that her tongue had elongated slightly to help with lapping up the water. He just hoped Ally would be able to control herself in public.</p>
