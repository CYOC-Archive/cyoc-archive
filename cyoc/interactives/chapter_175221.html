<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff waited with frustration with some sort of sign as to what was the old bear doing, but the man made little sound as he read. It was hard to tell what was happening, but he started to feel like the drags on the pipe were longer, and the occasional sound from an electronic could be heard, but still nothing solid. The day went along as simple as the rest, and the man finally set Jeff away for the night, but Jeff realized it sounded like he was still nearby him this night. Was he in his room?<br />
<br />
Jeff was  unaware that during the night he lost consciousness, but in the morning he saw the bedroom fully, and could tell something was different, instinctively stepping forward, but still he couldn&#39;t move. Yet, it felt like he could. But still he stared ahead at the sleeping man. The man awoke finally, a deep groan, approaching Jeff while naked. He scratched his belly and locked eyes with Jeff. &quot;Good morning. Jeff was it? It seems I figured out that little device you sent me. So, you wanted to spend some time staring at an old man and being his property?&quot; Jeff was stunned by this revelation, but he couldn&#39;t say anything. <br />
<br />
The man chuckled and picked Jeff up, the carpet rushing by as he listened motionless, a strange worry building in him at being caught. &quot;Now, I was bit shocked to see this was possible, and that you did this without asking me. But, the way I see it, this could be why the Chron-- err, that device of yours, chose me, since you wanted to enjoy your owner, right? Young men like you certainly have a thing for older bears. And I do have a soft spot for a certain type of young man.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was placed down in front of a mirror and saw he was human again. Still small, not even a foot tall, but his body was sculpted with muscle. A thick gym body with chiseled abs and thick pecs and arms that looked powerful. His face was covered in a dark stubble while his hair was bleached and slicked back. His legs were equally huge, and he was wearing a dark blue jockstrap that contained a large package. <br />
<br />
“You like my work, boy?” As those words finished Jeff found himself able to move. He touched his body, confirming it was really him, feeling the strength in his body now. He turned back to the bear, but found his mouth was moving, and no sound came out. “Someone doesn’t like to listen. But I can fix that. Boy, look at the mirror.” Jeff found himself turning around. “Better. You see, Jeff, I used to enjoy owning submissive men like you, teaching them to enjoy being a real man’s play thing. I especially loved a pet that enjoyed looking big and strong but still craved to be trained. Now, let’s see what I’m working with as far as obedience. Flex, boy.” <br />
<br />
Jeff was trying to take this all in, breathing heavy, but he noticed this time he was still in control of his body, and didn’t move much. As the man tsk-tsked with a chuckle. “Ahh, free will is scary. I thought you were that type. Boy, flex for you man.” Jeff’s arms lifted and flexed his biceps, his eyes showing his shock. “Oh, the boys always like showing off their biceps. See Jeff, if I say ‘boy’ before the command, my good little Jeff will always do what I say. And that’ll make sure you aren’t too much of a pain to train. I have no longer the patience for unruly brats that just like to get punished. This is my private cabin, so you get to live by my rules. That’s why you cannot run your mouth without my permission. I like it quiet these days. I don’t know how long you wanted to stay as my pipe, but the man gets to decide what his property will be, and you don’t like my rules, you can leave. Now, show off your pecs. That’s where a man’s real strength is. Boys are too obsessed with biceps.”<br />
<br />
Jeff was in shock by all of this, but he was flexing his pecs as the command was still in effect. The bear was letting him stay until he was willing to leave though. But, what about his timer? He sent a signal to the Chronivac.<br />
Time remaining: 11 hours, 58 minutes and 5 seconds<br />
“Bounce those pecs. Faster. You need a punishment for not asking permission to be my property.” Jeff flexed his pecs, the rush of being large enough to do it making him excited, but even more this weird rush of having little control was making him shiver.<br />
Time reset to 12 hours.<br />
His eyes went wide. He was being used. The bear chuckled. “There you go. Feel good, boy? Now, let me make it feel better. Built in a little treat for you. Boy, face me.” Jeff turned around, seeing the man lower himself to his height. “Good boy.” The words sent a jolt of pleasure through his body. His cock was hard and he humped the air, wanting to cum, but nothing came out. <br />
<br />
“Young studs like you looove to cum, but you’ve slowed down my day enough.” Jeff was still shaking from the rush of pleasure, not really listening as he arched his hips forward and fucked the air. “Time for my shower, Jeff. Who’s my toy?” And as Jeff looked forward his body froze again. The man picked him up and took him into the shower. “You know, I should be punishing you more. Thanks to your deception I didn’t buy my new pipe while in town. But, I have plenty of ideas on how you can make it up to me.”<br />
<br />
He took a corded rope and laced it under Jeff’s arms so he was dangling from it, tying the rope to the shower head so he swung low, seeing the man’s large hairy belly. “Always been a proud big bear, and happy to see the young guys still realize how great a big man in charge is. Toy, if I ever do let you talk, no talk of life before today. You are my property, and will obey.” The shower turned on, and the bear started lathering himself.<br />
<br />
Jeff screamed in his head. He couldn’t tell the bear about the timer now. How did he miss that feature?</p>
