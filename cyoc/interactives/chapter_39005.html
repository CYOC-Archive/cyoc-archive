<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jay wakes up and the first thing he notices is that once again he is human, but the happiness of discovering he's back to his old self quickly fades when he notices that once again he's tied and handcuffed once again to a bed.<br />
<br />
Sean enters shortly, still looking like a woman, but with B cup size breasts, wearing only a bathrobe that isn't even tied shut. Seeing Jay's awake, he smiles and waves the Chronivac at Jay and says in a feminine voice, &quot;Ahhh, good. You're awake. Now, what shall I do this time, hmmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you've had your fun and obviously more, now let me go Sean,&quot; Jay pleads.<br />
<br />
Sean laughs at this and taking a petite finger, he begins to massage his Clitoris. Moaning, Sean tells Jay, &quot;It's no longer Sean, but Shawna. And as for when you can go, well I haven't decided yet when that will be. Now, what shall you become today. You obviously don't remember so let's go down the list.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the next fifteen minutes, Shawna listed off everything she'd turned Jay into and it was more then just a sow boi, a baby girl and a freakish human dog. There was the time Shawna had turned him into a male stripper, a female stripper, Shawna's dildo, her vibrator, a pile of refuse that lived off sex and another freakish human creation, this one some type of cat, frog, human hybrid and Shawna's swimsuit.<br />
<br />
As all this was described, Jay got the sense, even though he'd blocked most of it out, Shawna had been doing this for some time. &quot;....We're going on three months now that you've been my little toy,&quot; Shawna announced, bringing Jay out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Punching information into the Chronivac, Shawna explained, &quot;This thing is a good way to get money and nobody's the wiser. So far, I have about nine hundred eighty three point seven billion dollars to my name and the best thing is nobody except the government knows how rich I am because I choose to live in this low middle class apartment complex,&quot; she laughs at this and turning to Jay, she continues, &quot;My little toy should help me realize something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scared, Jay whimpers out, &quot;What's that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Shawna grins and replies, &quot;I really enjoyed all your forms, but the one I really liked was Jackie. Only I want to make you mine in more then a Chronivac sort of way. I think you should become a two month old fetus. If it gets to be to much of a problem, I'll just use the Chronivac to change you again. But I don't think that's going to be a problem. Motherhood looks so promising, Jackie.&quot;<br />
<br />
She laughs and Jay tries to call out for help as a beam emits from the machine in her hand and Jay can feel himself changing. Suddenly everything goes dark and somewhere he can hear a thumping noise, like a drum. His last thoughts are, &quot;Oh my god! I'm a female fetus!&quot; Before a wash of chemicals and hormones bath him and he is lost to this new form for good.<br />
<br />
Outside, Shawna places a hand over her abdomen. She has altered the Chronivac so that everyone, except her, thinks that she's been artificially inseminated. Chemicals flood her body and she grins as she leaves the room, leaving the Chronivac on a table that at one time was a bed used to subdue a rather nasty and jealous man named Jay.<br />
<br />
The machine forgotten for the prospect of the little girl growing inside of her, Shawna heads first to the bedroom where she Jill's off and then to the bathroom for a long hot shower.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Marty was the kid two doors down. At the age of fifteen, he'd already been skipped ahead two grades, but he was bored with everything around him. So he went in search of something that could give him a challenge. Theft and breaking and entering was just the sort of thing that brought him that challenge.<br />
<br />
Breaking into Ms. Ternykies apartment had been easy. Marty suspected that woman was a lot richer then she looked, &quot;After all, she never goes to work or receives a paycheck,&quot; he reasoned after watching her a couple of times and even going through her mail. And now with her in the shower, it was a perfect opportunity.<br />
<br />
Sneaking in, he began to creep around the apartment, snooping for anything that could be pawned. In truth, he had another fetish, one even his mother didn't know about; one that involved woman's clothing.<br />
<br />
Deciding the bedroom was the best place to start, he crept that way. He'd only just started to look around when the shower clicked off. Frozen in place, Marty listened as the bathroom door opened and watched as Shawna came out, wrapping a towel around her body.<br />
<br />
Near panic, he looked around and then dove under the bed. Luckily Shawna didn't see him as she enters the bedroom. Finished with her shower, she proceeds to take her time getting dressed and twenty minutes later, she exits the bedroom and a couple minutes after that Marty can hear the front door closing as she leaves.<br />
<br />
A sigh of relief escapes Marty as he crawls out from under the bed. Sure that he's going to be alone, &quot;After all, Ms. Ternykies usually goes out about this time and doesn't return at least for another five hours,&quot; he reasons.<br />
<br />
First stop is Shawna's closet and carefully he chooses a sundress and matching shoes. Next from the dresser he takes a bra and a pair of low cut bikini briefs. Making sure everything looks like it's in the correct order, nothing looks disturbed, Marty rolls up his choice in clothes and heads out of the room.<br />
<br />
In the hallway, he peeks into another room that turns out to be a guest bedroom and then the bathroom. He's just about to leave when he decides to look under the sink. Under there he finds a box of tampons and a small bag of pantie liners that make the underwear smell fresh.<br />
<br />
Taking one of the pantie liners, he heads back down the hall. A quick sweep and he sees nothing that is worth stealing. Marty is just about to leave when he sees the Chronivac lying on the table. Curious about it, he goes over and picks it up. Immediately the words Chronivac flash across the screen. Curious still, he takes it and heads home.<br />
------<br />
<br />
Home, Marty's not surprised to see his mother isn't there. &quot;She's probably working another double shift,&quot; he thinks as he heads to his room to try on the clothes he pinched, knowing mom won't get home until past midnight.<br />
<br />
Everything fits great and really accents his young body. With the help of some inserts that give a woman two extra cup sizes, it looks like he has a B cup size. Next he makes sure that his legs and armpits don't need to be shaved. After that he uses the make-up he's bought over the years and makes himself look even more feminine. With a help of a wig, in a couple of minutes, Marty looks like a thirteen year old girl. Deciding he'll go get dinner dressed like this, he almost leaves until he sees the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Sitting down on the bed, he turns it on. After having him register his name, it gives him a tutorial and within minutes, Marty understands that this machine could alter him or people around him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but who and what should I alter?&quot; He asks himself. &quot;If this thing is legit, could it make me one hundred percent female?&quot;<br />
<br />
These questions and more race through Marty's head as he sat on the bed, legs crossed in a lady like pose, the Chronivac held in front of him, waiting for his choice.</p>
