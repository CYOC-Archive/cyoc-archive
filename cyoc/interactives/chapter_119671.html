<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked down at your body shocked as it was completely covered in white fur. Your breasts seemed to have grown and multiplied and you noticed this looking down to see two C cup boobs hanging where your regular boobs were normally. You looked down seeing your 3 new pairs of breasts and they seemed to get smaller as they worked towards your stomach and your smallest were A cups. Your vagina hadn&#39;t changed much with the fur, but your hands and feet were paws. You looked at your hands and saw that you still had thumbs and sighed in relief, but they had pads on them that would make picking things up slightly more annoying.<br />
<br />
You then saw a muzzle obstructing your view with a wet black nose, and you held it with your hand and realized that it was yours. You then felt your ears were more pointed and you could move them easily on your head, and your mouth had canine teeth and a long tongue. Finally you noticed something that you should have before and saw 6 large white bushy tails stemming off from your spine right above your ass. You were shocked as you could easily move each tail individually with little effort, but then you looked up behind you and saw that man again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y...you...&quot; you growled turning around and attempting to cover your breasts, but couldn&#39;t as there were too many.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down miss, and allow me to explain everything to you.&quot; The man said walking over to you<br />
<br />
&quot;Like hell I will! Tell me what the fuck is going on or I&#39;ll....&quot; You began then realized that the man was suddenly taller than you and you whimpered blushing embarrassed when you realized your situation. You noticed that your tails were all now tucked between your legs and that only made things more embarrassing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll what? I shrunk you down to be about 5&#39;4&quot; even so that I would be able to explain this to you.&quot; The man said. You realize that the man had to be at at least 4 inches taller than you as he looked down at you, and you whimpered again taking a step back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be not afraid, I don&#39;t wish to harm you, and for your sake you must listen to my words. But first let&#39;s get somewhere where a lady like yourself isn&#39;t so exposed.&quot; The man said<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment and the man put a hand on your shoulder, and he snapped his fingers with the other. Suddenly a blue light surrounded you and the two of you suddenly appeared in a small cabin with a fireplace. You watched as the man threw some logs into the fireplace and snapped his fingers yet again and suddenly the wood in the fireplace cought fire lighting up the room around you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Take a seat by the fire please, and get comfortable.&quot; The man said pulling up a couple wooden chairs that looked handmade.<br />
<br />
You did as the man said and sat down in the wooden chair closest to you in front of the fireplace, and he did the same in the other chair facing you. There was a moment of silence before either of you spoke, but the man broke that silence and said,&quot;Before anything I would like to apologize for our unsettling first meeting. My name is Edward, and I am the young wizard that summoned you to this world, and transformed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name is...wait, I can&#39;t remember it! How?! Why?!&quot; You whined worried <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, that is natural for what I summoned you here for. You see you are my familiar now, and as such are required to have a non-human form and most of your memory was lost when you tranformed.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; You yelped<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, your former life is none of your concern now. I will give you a new name, and you will develop your new identity. We are very fortunate that you got the form of a kitsune, it will be much easier to train you since your kind has natural magical capabilities.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m tempted to call you a pervert now that you&#39;ve said that and I have 4 pairs of breasts.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was a pervert then I would wish for a succubus, but I&#39;m not one for kinky lusts. Besides your form wasn&#39;t decided by me, and was random. We are also fortunate that you didn&#39;t become male because then you would have a much more challenging time adapting to your body.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment then said,&quot;Um, that&#39;s a good point, but what made you choose me specifically when you summoned me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t choose you....actually let me rephrase that. I couldn&#39;t choose at all, the entire process is random, and you were just chosen out of a random selection that included your world&#39;s sentient life.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so what exactly is a familiar specifically?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You are my non-human assistant until one of us dies, and not to make this threatening but you will most likely be that death. That is mainly because that your life strictly depends on my survival, but if I die naturally then you will have the gift and pleasure of living in this world without age. In fact your body now doesn&#39;t age, and you will remain like that for the rest of your life, you are in your prime after all.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;So if you die, I die? And I can&#39;t age?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Precisely, but your death won&#39;t affect me, as opposed to my death will causing you to die under most circumstances. But I naturally am obligated to provide you with food, water, shelter, and clothing, but I can&#39;t do much for your breasts.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but if I didn&#39;t serve you then what would happen?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;As I explained the penalty of my death to you, other familiars will sense that you are a familiar and law is required for a familiar to stay with their master unless within private property or following an order. If the law is disobeyed then you will either be imprisoned, punished, killed, or all of the above.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; you said then sighed looking down at your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let&#39;s get you settled in now Crystal.&quot; Edward said standing up and holding out his hand to help you stand up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crystal?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It fits, snow white fur, yellow eyes. Even if your magic is different from what I expect the name still fits.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh, thanks Edward.&quot; You said blushing and taking Edward&#39;s hand allowing hit to help you up.<br />
<br />
&quot;For future reference, in public you shall refer to me using the title &quot;master&quot; because it shows others who you&#39;re a familiar to.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, alright,&quot; you said<br />
<br />
Edward guided you to a candlelit bedroom and sat you down on a straw bed with deerskin sheets. The bedroom seemed roomy, and you could see a second candle lit on a stand that had a large finger hole in it so it could be carried. The second candle sat on a fancy study-desk with multiple drawers that had a nice  well made wooden chair with it. Next to the desk sat a small bookcase with about 20 books in it, but you couldn&#39;t tell what they were about. Edward opened the closet and pulled out a blue cloak and gave it to you. &quot;Unfortunately it only fastens around the collar, so everything below that will be seen if you reach out. But most familiars are like that, and then some are nude by their master&#39;s choice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks then.&quot; You said and stood up and tied a string that was attached to the cloak around your neck like you would a shoe and double-knotted it just in case it came loose.<br />
<br />
&quot;Matches your eyes and fur at least, sorry the only things that I have for you are cloaks like this that are unisex.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no it&#39;s fine. I&#39;d wish I had on something underneath, but my tails would get in the way of any kind of underwear, and I&#39;m not quite into wearing four bras at once.&quot; You said then blushed realizing who you were talking to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you could discuss this with someone else who&#39;s female.&quot; Edward said and you could see him blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you don&#39;t need to hide your embarrassment from me. Thanks for everything you&#39;ve given me, except for the whole form thing, but I&#39;m sure that I&#39;ll get used to it eventually.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, well you&#39;re welcome then. Can I get you anything? Or shall I just leave you alone for awhile?&quot; Edward asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually I&#39;m not quite sure what to do now. I was tired until I got here, but I feel well rested for some reason.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? It&#39;s actually early morning, dawn isn&#39;t for awhile.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but still I won&#39;t be able to sleep.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case have a gander at some books here about different magical elements and abilities. There&#39;s two books for each element for basic and advanced practices, but DON&#39;T attempt to use any spells inside the cottage here. I can&#39;t stress that enough here, so sorry about the tone.&quot; Edward said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll be careful to with the candles.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I&#39;m going to bed for now, see you at dawn.&quot; Edward said then exited the room.<br />
<br />
You walked over and picked up the candle on from the desk, and knelt down to see the books on the shelf. You didn&#39;t know much about magic so you picked one of the basic magic books at random and took it over to the desk and opened it. You set the candle beside you and began reading an elemental magic book on....</p>
