<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sam&#39;s mother always woke up an hour earlier than the young girl herself. She would start off the day with showering and getting ready, doing the laundry within the time necessary for it, then go downstairs for her daughters to prepare breakfast, the typical English kind. Most of the required ingredients were there. She noticed she&#39;d overlooked a couple of them when she ran errands yesterday though, stupid of her.<br />
<br />
Her oldest daughter woke up, no thanks to her alarm clock, but rather, a rush of gentle pleasure coming from her crotch. She slid down her pajama pants to see what it was this time. She didn&#39;t remember dreaming about anything she desired.<br />
<br />
No, it wasn&#39;t like that in this case. She spotted eggs and a small canister of brown beans in it. She groaned loudly, wishing she could&#39;ve slept just a little longer, but stood up anyway, and headed downstairs.<br />
<br />
Her mother stood in the kitchen with a hint of guilt on her face, as Sam held the items in both hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try to remember what to buy next time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam handed the can over to her mom, feeling satisfied how she managed not to drop a single egg on the floor when going down the stairs. All a balance thing. She planned on throwing the eggs in the garbage bin, but her mother stopped her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave those on the counter too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, it&#39;s gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s covered by the shell. I&#39;ll wash it clean as well if necessary. And it&#39;s not gross, don&#39;t say that about yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Because the power was a part of her. Finding out about it was a strange thing. She had her period a couple of weeks after she turned twelve, which can be considered fashionably late. Starts off with leaking blood, making it drip down her thighs, ends with a cylindrical tube packaging tampons coming out of her birth canal, after her mother said they needed those. The manifestation of her powers was a complete coincidence, but its timing was ideal, and it had some logical sense behind it as well.<br />
<br />
It had made her one of the few people in the entire world to manifest powers. These were completely random, and could be both of help, or a complete nuisance. Hers was classified as a pleasure power, the reasons were obvious.<br />
<br />
Sam sighed. She&#39;d rather have been an actual superhero, like Angel, the healer, or Brutus, the brute.<br />
<br />
She couldn&#39;t exactly proudly brag about her powers either, considering how they worked. Now it was an everyday thing. As long as somebody close by really desired something, or was in desperate need of something, her powers would kick in. She had no control over it.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
Everyone in class was silent, as Sam was halfway through the English test. Questions about eighteenth century literature. It was meant as a mock test, but it still counted as a mark in the results at the end of the year, its weight being half in comparison to the actual tests they made. Luckily she&#39;d prepared for it. The students hadn&#39;t been notified, so it came at a surprise at this hour. The actual test concerning English literature was coming in two weeks. It&#39;s questions would stretch over a total of three centuries, including the one they had a test about right at that moment.<br />
<br />
Sam was always good in literature, and today too, she was on a roll.<br />
<br />
The girl besides her wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Max was a bright student, but if things didn&#39;t go her way, she would panic and lose the necessary focus. Her pen running out of ink could be considered a disaster, and their English teacher wasn&#39;t the kind of person who would just give you a new one without causing a ruckus, so she kept silent.<br />
<br />
She searched through her pencil case for a back-up, but didn&#39;t find any, to her horror.<br />
<br />
Sam heard Max&#39; troubles the moment the girl was violently scratching her pen against her test paper. The pen broke, or something. She looked in a panic, and Sam could already predict what was coming next.<br />
<br />
Not her, it didn&#39;t go that far.<br />
<br />
But still.<br />
<br />
A nice warmth ran through her abdomen, as her uterus made itself noticed to the powered girl. Her walls lubricated themselves slightly to make for an easier passage. A thin, small rod ran down her canal and pushed against her panties, making her blush. She heard a faint click as the pen made contact and stood under pressure against the fabric. She let it happen, and calmly got it out of her. She tried making no sound. Everybody knew about what her powers could do, still it wasn&#39;t something she wanted to talk about. From her left was a small grin, the girl to her right, Max, hadn&#39;t noticed yet.<br />
<br />
Sam examined the pen. It looked exactly the same as the one she was holding herself. The new one however, had a bit of a shine to it. She couldn&#39;t give that to her neighbor. <br />
<br />
She looked at the teacher&#39;s desk, and found the man occupied with other stuff. Sam carefully tapped Max&#39; side, as to not startle her. The girl looked at her, then at the pen she was holding, as she offered it to her. Hurriedly she grabbed it, and mouthed a thank you to Sam, continuing with the questions.<br />
<br />
The test wasn&#39;t finished yet. About ten minutes left for twelve more questions, most of them multiple choice. That was easily manageable. Sam wiped the new pen dry. It was already out of its holster, so she could immediately start again.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you for the pen during the test! I really was driven into a corner back there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem Max. My pleasure.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl walked away. Sam was approached by her friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously Sam, you should drop that catchphrase.&quot; Jasmine scolded. &quot;They&#39;ll get the wrong idea!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s funny and it&#39;s punny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s puny, you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s not! I really saved her back there. The villain was a pen running out of ink.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually, when a villain runs out of something, it&#39;s considered good news.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There are exceptions. That one was an exception.&quot;<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;It really is getting hotter and hotter these days, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Jasmine asked Sam as to confirm it, and she received a nod. &quot;Brace yourselves, summer is coming!&quot; <br />
<br />
A man in an exercise outfit ran past the two, panting heavily. They watched him go. It wasn&#39;t the best time of day to go for a jog. Best choice was either early morning or late evening. You&#39;d get nowhere but to the point of dehydration if you ran in the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;The public swimming pool is going to open soon, although the amount of visitors allowed is still limited.&quot; Jasmine said. &quot;The deep pool isn&#39;t open yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously.&quot; Sam remarked. &quot;The more water in a pool, the longer it takes to properly warm it up. It must still be freezing. It&#39;s only May still.&quot;<br />
<br />
They passed the running man again. He was leaning against a water tap. However, a sign showed that the thing was broken, leaving him thirsty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap.&quot; Sam muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt her panties grow wet underneath her skirt, as a small stream of water jetted out of her pussy. It didn&#39;t feel pleasant at all. It was cold too, meant to be refreshing, for fuck&#39;s sake. Only a matter of time before it soaked through. Wait, there you have it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that sucks.&quot; Jasmine stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it does!&quot; Not being able to control this power really does suck!<br />
<br />
Sam looked around, trying to anticipate the situation. No way in hell would she let the man sit underneath her to catch the stream running down her thighs and from her panties. A small puddle was forming at her feet, water audibly splashing against the pavement as it dropped down.<br />
<br />
There were two vending machines standing next to a building nearby her. She searched through her bag and grabbed her purse, pulling out a dollar bill. She hesitated for a moment, then pulled out another one, knowing how expensive some drinks could be. Before she could actually head over to the man, Jasmine grabbed her by the wrist, and took the bills herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me handle this.&quot; She said. &quot;No need to embarrass yourself even more, with your power leaking through and all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine spoke to the man for a moment. The runner kindly thanked her and ran over to the vending machine. Waiting a bit longer, they saw how the man entered the money into the machine and picked his drink. Only when he finally took the first gulp, the stream stopped. Sam calmly breathed out. That happens too sometimes.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;Dang it!&quot; Sam exclaimed as she wrung out her panties. She had entered a public toilet with Jasmine, one that wasn&#39;t too busy that time of day, actually never. Her friend stood outside of the stall she was occupying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Normally it&#39;s just a fucking bottle. No mess whatsoever.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, at least we solved it.&quot; Jasmine tried to alleviate what just happened. &quot;Besides, how&#39;s a bottle better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve got one guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine mimicked a moan. &quot;So your power does have a perk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Many. It usually grants two wishes at the same time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of the wetness was already gone by now, but it would still sit damp and cold against Sam&#39;s crotch. Not really something pleasant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fun thing is... it has happened a bunch of times before already too. And back then it was even worse, nightmarish even.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine laughed. &quot;Really? How?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mother arrived home a bunch of times while really needing to go to the toilet. Now, no, I didn&#39;t have a whole toilet coming from my pussy, that would&#39;ve been a real mess, but the alternative wasn&#39;t fun either.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine made a face. &quot;Gross. Urine I guess?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam nodded. &quot;Yeah. Apparently my power perceived my mom&#39;s need as something it could solve. Hence, a second bladder magically relieved itself, and didn&#39;t stop until mom was actually finished as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her friend laughed again, with hiccups accompanying it.<br />
<br />
Sam laughed too. &quot;So it has some disadvantages, but who cares, right? My mom apologized and cleaned it up herself. That was after I explained to her I hadn&#39;t felt the need to go to the toilet right before she arrived, and that it came from my other hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Secretly it was just a pathetic excuse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure. Up to you what to believe.&quot;<br />
<br />
She put her panties on again, and let her skirt drop over her thighs, then exited the stall.<br />
<br />
Jasmine raised an eyebrow to her. &quot;No wishing for dry panties?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not possible, after that water flowing through my cunt. Besides, I usually automatically lubricate when my powers kick in, and a dry birth would just hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus! Too much info.&quot; Jasmine took out her phone, as she received a notification.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops&quot; Sam grinned. It faded quickly too. Her powers kicked in, and informed her what it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it Jas!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did I do?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You needed something really badly, and I was around. That&#39;s what you did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I help it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam lowered her panties again. She searched around and inside her entrance, and took hold of a strap. The fabric was elastic, making the job just a little tougher. Thank goodness for the water, it had some good side to it too. It fit the occasion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Water mixed with bikini. There&#39;s a pool theme going on inside me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine snorted. &quot;I&#39;m sorry okay! I just got a message from Kat. She actually invited me to the pool for tomorrow. You&#39;ve probably gotten an invite as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I don&#39;t check for now? I&#39;m pretty busy.&quot; Sam moaned slightly as the bikini got out a little further. Her vaginal muscles contracted slightly as to help out, but the clothing&#39;s shape wouldn&#39;t contribute. Pulling a little more, Sam brought her legs together in pleasure, until it finally shot out and spanked against the floor tiles. She panted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew! Tough job!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It felt so nice...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Figures, and thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jasmine almost grabbed the bikini, but turned to Sam at the last moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Sam said, as she saw her friend look. &quot;I&#39;ll take it home, wash it, and give it back to you after. It&#39;s all your size anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No bragging about your tits and ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up. But yes, I win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her friend groaned.<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did you get that burrito?&quot; Her mother asked.<br />
<br />
Sam raised her eyebrows. That was a clear message. Her mom didn&#39;t question her any further, but looked hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like fish mom, you know that. Don&#39;t act all insulted.&quot;<br />
<br />
A smile spread across her mother&#39;s face. She pet Sam&#39;s head. &quot;Of course I do, sweetie. Enjoy your meal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Sam walked over to the couch in the living room, and went to sit in front of the television. Now where&#39;s that remote...<br />
<br />
_____<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, yes...&quot; Sam gasped.<br />
<br />
Almost midnight, mom and sis asleep, dad at having a night-shift at his job.<br />
<br />
She was kneeling on her bed, clutching her belly. She&#39;d just gotten ready for bed, changing clothes, when her brain went lewd again. Tomorrow she and her friend were headed for the pool. There were a couple more people coming as well, including her handsome crush, Dan. It wasn&#39;t difficult for a girl during puberty, with raging hormones, to imagine herself in the most daring of situations with good-looking people, like that guy. Getting horny was the easiest part. Just a bit of growing wetness in her crotch.<br />
<br />
An attempt to ignore it was the hard part, and she&#39;d failed tonight. Her powers had kicked in before she&#39;d gotten herself to rationalize, get back to her normal, innocent self. <br />
<br />
At least she was nearing the end of her puberty, her plump butt and round breasts proved that. That would mean these episodes would happen less, right? Her nipples were starting to stiffen, not thanks to cold air, but arousal. Inside of her, she felt like burning slightly, her power was lubricating her inside walls to perform the best and biggest act of the day. She felt a slight pop, indicating her &#39;water broke&#39;, and the start of something large sliding out of her pussy.<br />
<br />
It passed through slowly, and her powers were screaming dildo. Fuck yeah! How long? Ten inches! This would happen every time she got desperately horny.<br />
<br />
The dildo passes the walls of her G-spot as it slid through her in reverse. She shuddered heavily, and got all the more excited. Next time, she should think about creating a dildo that was exactly the same shape as her own pussy, see how that looked and, of course, felt.<br />
<br />
Once the biggest end of the dildo, the synthetic &#39;ball-sack&#39;, exited her cunt, everything slid out even faster than before, causing even more pleasure and even better sensations.<br />
<br />
Now that it was actually out of her, Sam went her own way with it, forming large thrust and making use of its massive shape. It wasn&#39;t long before she came, muscles contracting in quick succession, with a badly stifled moan. She really hoped her sister hadn&#39;t woken up from that sound. She was sleeping in the room right beside her, presumably.<br />
<br />
Like that, her horny feelings dissipated, and she reached a state of afterglow. Sam walked over to her closed, and slid one of its doors to the side. She moved a couple of boxes aside, and looked at all she had gathered and kept over the past years. It used to be sticks coming out of her, when she hadn&#39;t heard of dildo&#39;s before. Then a traumatic experience with a very realistic looking cock, after her first lesson about the male biology, and then came the sex-toys.<br />
<br />
She looked at the ten inch dildo in her hand, then over at the other few she&#39;d kept a hold on. <br />
<br />
This one definitely fit in her collection.</p>
