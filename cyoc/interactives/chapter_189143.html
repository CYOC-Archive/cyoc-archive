<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he explored around, he was suddenly grabbed and pulled over by a gorgeous pair of half naked women in only lingerie and heels. The were unusually strong for their looks though, as they easily lifted him up off the ground. He was brought into the booth&#39;s backside room which had been curtained off and was set down into a wooden chair.<br />
<br />
In front of him sat a rather large man, but interestingly, he had a woman&#39;s face, meaning that although the body was what he could only describe as the human equivalent to a gorilla, this person was a woman as well. This &quot;gorilla&quot; woman looked him up and down, then looked at the two other women who were still holding him in place. &quot;Is he the one?&quot; She asked, in an unusually feminine voice that didn&#39;t match the body at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, I think he is our guy.&quot; Said the blonde woman on Marcus&#39;s left. The redhead also nodded and added &quot;he&#39;s just my type too. I haven&#39;t had a body this young in ages. Hey kid, how&#39;s it look down there?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nora, that&#39;s enough&quot; said the &quot;gorilla&quot; woman. She then looks at Marcus. &quot;Hey kid, you need a job, and my associate needs your body. So what do you say? Sign on with us, and you won&#39;t even have to lift a finger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nora, the redhead woman, then moves down in front of you and starts lifting up her boobs in front of you. &quot;And I, will let you do whatever you want with my body. Be it sex or whatever, my body will be yours for the term of your employment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus would be lying to himself if he said he wasn&#39;t interested. This Nora woman had one of if not the sexiest body figure he had ever seen in his life. And top top it all off, she had great tits too. So it would definitely be a huge win in terms of his &quot;career body&quot;. Hearing that he wouldn&#39;t need to lift a finger at work was also very tempting, albeit a bit sketchy. <br />
<br />
But he needed a job, and here one was being offered to him exclusively. He would be a fool to turn their offer down. &quot;Sounds good I guess. Thank you for the opportunity.&quot; He said. His answer seemed to be well recieved as the blonde let his arm go and hugged him instead. Her body was equally as nice as Nora&#39;s too, so he didn&#39;t mind her doing this.<br />
<br />
The &quot;gorilla&quot; woman spoke again. &quot;Wonderful. By the way, the blonde hugging you is Shelby and you can call me Madame Serena, or simply Mistress if you prefer. Oh, and before you ask, this body is a temp. My normal one has to see a specialist today, and I do not enjoy being in medical waiting rooms.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, uh... My name is Marcus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For now&quot; Said Madame Serena.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, never mind that. Let&#39;s get all of your paperwork in order while you are still here. It will expedite the process tremendously if you can fill in the blanks in person. Oh, and why don&#39;t you do so using Nora&#39;s body so that you can get a feel for her. Think of it as a sneak peek for what&#39;s to come later.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, okay then&quot; Marcus says. Nora then sits down next to him and the two swap heads with a bit of help from Shelby. Having a woman&#39;s body was certainly a first for him, but damn did it feel good. Every inch of him was now soft and smooth, yet had everything in golden proportions. And he could tell that none of it was fake too. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the muscle memories, he didn&#39;t fall over completely when he stood up, but he did stumble slightly from the weight of his breasts and the 4 inch heels. But with Shelby lending him a hand, he managed to get into a stable standing posture. Then he was handed a folder with a contract and a pen and was told to sign his name at the bottom. He breifly skimmed through the few pages, then signed his name.<br />
<br />
Nora emptied her pockets and handed the wallet back to Marcus, but stuffed his phone into his bra while removing her own. She then left the back room, leaving Marcus standing there confused as to where she was going with his body. Shelby then showed him a small purse that interestingly matched his lingerie, which she placed his wallet inside of. She then placed it over your shoulder and stepped back, taking the folder with the signed contract inside, and the pen with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you Shelby, that purse is a excellent choice&quot; praised Madame Serena as she accepted the contract folder from her. She then looked up at you, &quot;Oh, your free to go now. Don&#39;t worry, we will call you later with more details and a location where you can go if you feel the need to be with us. We can take care of the rest from here though, and will send you your first check by next Tuesday.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus was shocked. He was still in Nora&#39;s body, and yet they just said he could leave.  &quot;Uh, what about my body?&quot; He asked while not at all use to hearing the seductive sounding voice of Nora coming out of his mouth. It sounded quite mature, but in a sexy kind of way. Not too high pitched, squeaky, or hoarse either. It was smooth and clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? What about it? Don&#39;t worry, Nora is a professional and will be sure you get it back in a condition which is just as good, if not better than what you left it in&quot; said Madame Serena. She then noticed you still didn&#39;t seem to get it. &quot;Didn&#39;t you read the contract? You start working with us the moment you signed. And we needed your body ASAP. So, you best get use to looking like that, because this is your body for the next 3 months, minimum.&quot; Marcus&#39;s mouth dropped, but he was then ushered out of there by Shelby before he could even make a fuss.</p>
