<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Will jumped slightly from her smack; he actually seemed to like it. He moved gracefully over to the bed, turning himself to face Lori as he lowered himself to the bed, swinging his legs onto the bed. He put a hand behind his head and gave her that come hither look. Will bent his knees slightly, showing off his supple, shapely legs to Lori.<br />
<br />
Without hesitation, Lori climbed straight onto the bed, her hands parted Will’s legs so she could move in closer to his body, and she kissed him deeply, probing her tongue deep into his mouth. She pulled back for a moment. “I want you to just sit still for this.” She began to ravish him with more kisses, slowly inching down his neck; she placed her hands on his left breast, squeezing it. Her mouth encompassed one of his yet again erect nipples, she sucked vigorously, as the nipple was wet, she pulled back slightly, blowing on it, Will moaned from the erotic sensation. “Ooh…you like that baby…” She played there for several minutes, teasing him with enticement.<br />
 <br />
Finally she began moving down again, kissing his tight little stomach, then kissing down his pelvic area. Will arched his back in anticipation of what she was going to attempt as the hairs of her head tickled the inside of his thighs, his mind was attempting to protest, he wasn’t ready for it yet. But Lori took that as an invitation and immediately moved to his sweet wet lips. She began to suck vigorously, probing her tongue into his sweet tasting void; she lapped at his juices as he grew more excited. When she brushed her finger lightly over his clitoris Will gasped and lifted his back off the bed, and when she manipulated his little hooded knob he shook uncontrollably and uttered a very girlish moan. Her touch had set off a series of incredibly wonderful tremors within him, and he consciously parted his legs further to allow her better access. Despite his uneasiness, his inner sanctum was damp with desire. He wanted her and needed her—now! His hands sought her body, hoping she would quicken the pace, she denied him that control. She continued to manipulate Will’s clit until he shook and cried out for release. His whole body was on fire and he was consumed by an overwhelming need to release.<br />
<br />
Lori stood, slowly, causing Will/Vikki to moan in disapproval. A smirk crossed her face as she studied the blonde, her hands were running over her soft body, trying to maintain her arousal, she looked to Lori with a lustful glare. Her sweet voice was soothing as she spoke to her, “Don’t worry babe, I’m just going to turn this up a notch. Stay put and I promise you’ll love it.” She said, walking over to the dresser, digging into it for a few moments before closing it back up. Lori pulled her legs through the holes, pulling it up her tan legs, the crotch fit snuggly against her skin, and she eased the plug into her excited hole. Feeling a slight tinge of excitement as it penetrated her, admiring the appearance of having an 8” cock on her vuluptious body.<br />
  <br />
Turning to face Vikki, a sly grin crossed Lori’s face; she walked over to Vikki’s line of sight. Her eyes seemed to bug out at the monstrous appendage swinging freely between the beauty’s legs. Vikki started protesting. “I don’t think I can do this…I’m…” Lori leaned forward, the stiff member pushed against Vikki’s stomach; Lori kissed her full on the lips, her hands running all over Vikki’s luscious breasts. Soon Vikki was again feeling aroused by her attention.<br />
<br />
Vikki’s hands rested on Lori’s feminine ass, Lori took it as a sign that she was ready, she slowly inched forward and thrust gently with her hips; Vikki's moist lips resisted the stiff rod. Lori increased the pressure ever so slightly, and the dildo started to slide in. Slowly but surely, Lori pushed the dildo deeper and deeper into Vikki's vagina but not quite all the way in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhhhh,&quot; Vikki sighed softly, her eyes had closed, her hands hand again roaming over her sensitive skin.<br />
<br />
Lori pushed down on Vikki’s thighs, spreading her legs further apart, Lori’s hips and pelvis back and withdrew the dildo slowly until just the tip remained inside her lover. She moved her hips forward again and pumped the dildo back in, in a slow steady motion. Vikki's lips gripped the dildo tightly holding it for each subtle motion that would push her buttons in just the right ways. Vikki had begun to moan, trying to slam her hips in response to Lori’s thrusts. Lori pulled her hips back and then pushed forward again, this time slightly harder and faster, the dildo went all the way in for the first time. &quot;Uhhhhh.&quot; Vikki gushed girlishly, Will had lost his self control and was caught up in the passion. Somewhere in his mind he rationalized yet again that it was a girl so it was all good.<br />
<br />
Lori looked down at Vikki as she thrust in and out of her eager pussy. The buzzing of the clit-vibrator felt nice as it stimulated her while she pleasured Vikki. She pulled her hips back and withdrew the dildo so only the tip remained inside Vikki’s entrance again. She inched her feet forward slightly She grabbed Vikki's waist with her hands and thrust her hips forward in a fast fluid motion. The dildo drove all the way in and Lori's pelvis slammed into Vikki's roughly. It sent chills through them both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh!&quot; Will's eyes opened quickly as he felt something long, rigid, and thick invading his female entrance and having sensations he had never thought he’d experience before. He strangely wanted more as he felt Goosebumps rise on his soft flesh; Lori’s hands roughly groped his tingling breasts. “Ow…” He said in his soft voice. Lori continued to pump hard into Will, every once in a while she would slow down and let him enjoy the feeling of the dildo slowly being inched in and out.<br />
 <br />
&quot;Ohhhhhhh!!! Ohhhhh!!! Uhhhhh!!!&quot; Will tried his best to stifle himself, but it was too much, he moaned and moaned as the thick, wet dildo slid in and out of him. Will’s body had begun to shake with lust, craving for the release of pleasure building up in his body. She denied him the release; stopping each time she sensed he was close. Lori pulled Will off the bed by his hips, arching his back she slammed into him a few more times before they both finally climaxed, the pumping decreased slowly before she finally pulled out of Will’s damp pussy. His juices made the dildo glisten, he felt great, sitting in the after glow of such a tremendous session of lesbian sex he’d ever witnessed.<br />
<br />
Lori leaned in, kissing Will again, wrapping her arms around him, their breasts pressing warmly against one another’s. A satisfied smirk crept across her face. “I’m glad you enjoyed that as much as I did, you were fantastic girly.” She winked, pecking him once more on the lips as she stood, making her way to the bathroom. “We gotta get ready Vikki, we’re late as it is, and I’m sure all the funs started already.” Will’s eyes widened, he’d completely forgotten about the party. Getting out of bed, Will could feel a trickle of moisture on his bare thighs. Entering the bathroom, Will noticed that Lori had already cleaned herself up and was wearing a pair of eggshell blue thong panties with a black bow. She looked so sexy to Will, he admired her momentarily and started cleaning himself up for the party.<br />
<br />
***************<br />
<br />
Meanwhile…<br />
<br />
On the other side of town, Megan had been waiting for Will to get home. “Damn him…or her…whatever. Will was supposed to come back here straight after work.” She shook her head, reading the text message over again.” She shrugged slightly. “Well, I have been kind of riding him hard, he deserves a little break…still, might as well check up on him.” Making her way toward the downstairs study, she walked in and over to the computer. Booting up the computer she waited briefly before it was ready, clicking the chronovac symbol, it immediately took over the entire computer. She typed in Will’s name and hit search, it showed him in Lori’s home. Her manly brow rose curiously, she zoomed into the house seeing the two girls, one of which was definitely Will, getting ready to go out on the town as it looked. “Why that sneaky little bitch.” She chuckled, the Chronovac indicated Will’s elevated hormonal levels; he’d obviously just finished a passionate round of love making.<br />
<br />
An evil smile crossed her face, he couldn’t blame Will, but then he couldn’t reward him either. “If that’s how you want to play it, you’ll definitely have a fun night.” She laughed, waiting for her opportunity to use the chronovac.<br />
************<br />
<br />
Lori stood in front of the mirror, placing her breasts in the nude colored strapless bra, the bra pulled them together making them look even more impressive than they were naturally. She smiled posing sideways, say for the small strap in the middle it didn’t look like she was even wearing a bra. Next she grabbed a light blue skirt that matched her panties, pulling them up her tanned legs, buttoning it in place on the side, it dropped to about two inches above mid-thigh displaying them nicely. Grabbing her blouse she pulled the black with blue trim material over her head and put it snuggly in place around her chest, leaving her shoulder blades bare, in front the blouse tied around her neck and had a modest amount of cleavage showing. Lori took a few minutes to dry her hair and style it, getting so wrapped up she completely forgot the naked girl standing behind her.<br />
 <br />
Will stood there for a good ten minutes in nothing at all, waiting, he obviously didn’t have any clothes to speak of, and the only ones had been thrown out long ago. There was the kimono but that was all the way in the jaguar, he was certainly not going to run out there in the buff. Of course, he didn’t really mind watching the beautiful young woman getting herself all pretty. Lori looked up as she applied the last of her make up, Will smiled warmly. “I thought you’d forgotten about me, chica.” He said with a slight chill, the air had kicked on and he had goosebumps all over his body. Lori turned, covering her mouth. “I am so sorry hun, I just get so focused some times I space.” She smiles. “I’ll go get you something to wear, your hair is still a bit damp…hmm, just leave it, I’ve got an idea. Be back in two seconds.” She said walking out of the room.<br />
<br />
After five minutes, Will heard Lori calling out from the bedroom, he waltz in there, his bare hips swaying back in forth in a sexy manner. Will smiles at Lori who smiles back with a sensual gleam in her eye. “Ooh…I could watch you walk all day. But I guess I’ll have to wait for later.” The chuckled as Lori motioned to the clothes lying on the bed. “Okay, I brought a few choices. We’re actually not the same size…obviously, so I had to borrow from one of the other girls. Don’t worry about that, she won’t mind. Take what you like.” Will sorted through the pile for a few minutes, finally deciding on the only half way decent outfit in the bunch. He pulled a dark red thong up his legs, easing them into place, it felt kind of comfortable now. The panties had a matching bra set which like them were made of satin and had flowers as well as a small red bow in the front. Next Will pulled on a pair of light blue denim jeans that fit him really snug on the legs, thighs, and hips; the waist was a low rise.<br />
<br />
Studying Will up and down, Lori nodded. “Wow, Vikki, those jeans really make your body look amazing. Finish up and meet me in the bathroom, we gotta do a little make up and your hair quick like girlie.” She said with a smile, smacking him playfully on the rear as she walked toward the bathroom. Will smiled, pulling the pink cotton sweater blouse over his head, it came to about two inches above his belly button, going all the way around and was sleeveless it showed off his fit belly very well. His well displayed hips gave him an hourglass figure, it showed off his chest but thankfully no cleavage. “The good with the bad…” He sighed, pulling on some tiny ankle socks, which he thought would never fit him onto his dainty feet, and they fit perfectly. He sighed. “When will this end…” He placed his feet in equally small sneakers; they were white with pink and sparkles on them. “Sheesh…that’s a little much.” He tied them and walked toward the bathroom.<br />
<br />
After another ten minutes in the bathroom, both of them were finally ready to get going. Lori had put some kind of gel into his hair to make it retain its wet look, he had to admit he looked kinda sexy like that. Then she put some eyeliner around his eyes to make the blue in them sparkle, followed by some pink lip gloss that made them looks so sweet and kissable. A little blush and a dash of concealer and he was finished. Lori came up behind him as he studied his reflection in the mirror, he looked amazing, definitely a top ten on his list. His mouth was wide open as Lori wrapped her arms around him, resting her hands on his tummy, she seemed taller to him as she bent down to rest her head on his shoulders. The heels she wore gave her an extra 2” in height giving her a good seven on Will now. She smiled looking at him through the mirror. “You look fantastic baby, I wish you’d worn the skirt…then maybe we coulda played some more tonight…but I don’t think that’ll be much of a problem anyways.” She kissed his neck, her warm hands rubbing over his stomach. “You’d look soo sexy with a belly ring, maybe we could get you one some time next week…” Lori said, purring warmly into his ear, he just nodded his head.<br />
<br />
Stopping her affections, Lori smiled. “Alright girlie, it’s time we hit the road, mind driving? It’s just a few blocks, but in this skirt…no thanks.” She laughed, Will did as well. “Sure, actually, is there a liquor store nearby? I want to pick up a whole bunch for the party…a little thanks for the invite.” After hopping in the car, they drove off toward the nearest shop.</p>
