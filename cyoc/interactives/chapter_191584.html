<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Resting within her palace, Naomi fiddled with the armrest of the throne she discovered within. She could feel the limitless power she commanded. She knew her own might, knew that a single thought from her could easily wipe out human civilization. But above all, she felt lonely. She lived in a grand city, alone. She was a queen with no subjects.<br />
She decided to change that.<br />
<br />
It would be so easy to just summon humans to her side, to twist their forms into gorgeous mermaids and mermen, to fill up her empire overnight. But the idea seemed so dull and uninspired to her. She didn&#39;t want to be the witch of the seas, the slavemaster who had no patience nor desire to put in any effort. And she could feel her cavernous womb, gaping within her stomach, her ovaries churning out eggs. She decided that to be a proper queen, a proper goddess, she would mother her empire the old-fashioned way, take full advantage of her fertility to become a true mother of the seas.<br />
<br />
The man she scouted out was perfect. He was a young fisherman, living all by his lonesome on the coast, sporting a good heart and a genuine respect for the sea. Naomi observed him from beneath the waves, his fishing line cast into the depths as he napped within his small rowboat. He would do well. Though he might not know it, he would be the father to a whole new race.<br />
She waited until the evening, when he started to pack up his things and row back to the shore. Smiling, she emerged from the water nearby, quiet as a stalking shark, and began to sing.<br />
His attention was immediately locked to the source of the voice, his flashlight scouring the darkness until her spotted her, floating amidst the waves. Her song wormed itself into his ears, her hypnotic wordless words eradicating any doubts he may have had. She was the only thing that mattered. This siren was calling for him. Without a second thought, he fell off his boat, surrendering himself to the ocean.<br />
<br />
Naomi swam to him and gently grabbed his sinking form, dragging the man deeper into the waters. She willed the waves to return his boat to the shore to await his return, her heart pumping, eagerly awaiting what was to occur. <br />
She heard him gasping, his ears popping and lungs struggling as she dragged him deeper and deeper. Whoops. She&#39;d forgotten how fragile creatures humans were. She grabbed his head and planted a kiss upon his lips, the entranced man stunned by the act. As they separated, he realized he could breathe just fine, the kiss of the mermaid adapting his body into the waters.<br />
She dragged him into an underwater cave, where amidst the corals she&#39;d prepared a bed of sorts, with soft seaweed for covers and glowing jellyfish floating overhead to provide illumination. She lowered him into the bed, stripping him in the process and thoroughly inspected the man. He had a handsome, rugged face and lean muscles. She smirked. Could be better, though.<br />
<br />
She began another song. Though the man didn&#39;t know the lyrics, he somehow understood what she was singing about. Her voice carried echoes of change, of growth, of virility and fertility. The man began burning up as Naomi&#39;s power got to work on him.<br />
Bones clicked and cracked as his form grew, his body stretching taller as his muscles pulsed to life, welling larger and harder under the transformative power of the mermaid queen. Her voice eased past all his defenses, his body surrendering its functions to the siren song, forfeiting control to the goddess whose will penetrated his very DNA, bringing about a change.<br />
He gruffed as he grew, his neck thickening and his Adam&#39;s Apple swelling larger as his voice grew lower, becoming an assured, manly bass. His face sprouted stubble that grew into a fine, well-maintained beard, the same color as his midnight black hair, adorning his strengthening jawline.<br />
<br />
His already wide shoulders stretched even wider, his biceps swelling as his arms and hands grew longer and larger, the change encompassing his whole torso as his pecs blew up like balloons, swelling with strength, his fit stomach melting as it popped out a six pack, then an 8-pack, until finally, with a mighty grunt, he produced an amazing and undeniable 10-pack, his body fat percentage dropping to nothing as every single muscle within his body swelled with strength.<br />
<br />
Amidst the violent improvements his body was undergoing, his manhood stood still, unremarkable amidst the waves of change. That stillness soon ended, as the mermaid queen, happy with the process the man was undergoing, grabbed his dick directly, eliciting a grunt from her man as she focused her power on the organ, the crown jewel of her creation. She demanded masculinity. She demanded sperm. She demanded...<br />
Perfection.<br />
<br />
Her demands coursed through his very genetic structure, flowing into the chromosomes that made up his very being, the XY he&#39;d been assigned at birth that defined him as a man.<br />
But the will of the goddess was undeniable. So, after a brief struggle against the unnatural power that tried to reconfigure it, the structure gave up. The X chromosome twisting, morphing and rearranging, until its legs fused into one, his genes now sporting a never before seen YY structure. A symbol of overwhelming and undeniable masculinity.<br />
<br />
The man screamed, agony flowing through his body like lava that even the soothing voice of the mermaid queen could not quell, his manly voice echoing within the cave as he surpassed his masculinity and became something more.<br />
His dick pulsed and twitched as it began to draw blood from all around his body, stretching out into a humongous erection. He grew, from a previously average 5 inches, into 6, to 7, to 8, the growth picking up pace as it jumped through sizes. 10. 12. 14. 16. 18. 20! An amazing and undeniable 20-inch cock blew up within his loins, as thick as his forearm, the foreskin peeling back with the growth and permanently revealing his huge, bulging, bright red glans to the mermaid queen who could feel her slit producing copious amounts of lubricant, preparing itself for the monster cock.<br />
His balls didn&#39;t want to lag behind, gurgling as more and more cum formed within them as they stretched larger, his small nuts stretching their sack as the forced it to grow larger to contain their magnificence. His orange-sized balls dropped as they finished their growth, overflowing with his baby batter. He was ready.<br />
<br />
But his body was not, as his changed genetics incurred a final set of mutations upon his form, bestowing upon his form previously dormant functions that had been locked away by the inherent femininity all males possessed. But he was now free. Free to express his dominance upon the lesser males.<br />
His grown testicles overflowed his body with testosterone, purer and more potent than any it had produced previously. His body hair thickened, coating his chest, armpits and pubic region in a thick black forest as the rest of his body turned more furred in general. His nose evolved to smell out the female sex from miles away, and his body produced pheromones no member of the fairer sex could resist. His spine stretched out, popping as new vertebrae grew in to stretch his torso out a bit more, new ribs growing to compensate it as his abdominal muscles produced a new pair, turning his 10-pack into a 12-pack, his body now a cobbled road of pure muscle as his ever deeper voice roared out in victory. <br />
<br />
Last but definitely not least, he felt a pressure emanating from his pubic region until with a SQUELCH his sack bulged out as another set of humongous testicles dropped into it. And another. And another until he was a proud owner of eight huge, pulsating, dominating testicles, each one producing copious amounts of sperm, his scrotum now like a bag of potatoes. <br />
The new testicles refused to let the line of this epitome of masculinity go uncontinued, and so his very sperm itself changed, the miniature cells shaking and growing, infused with his new DNA. New, more powerful sperm now swam within his factories. Gigantic, almost as big as a female egg, sporting two tails for increased movement and even some rudimentary intelligence instead of pure instinct. The would always find their mark and would NEVER fail to produce perfect babies, male or female, that carried on his genes. Finally, his dick throbbed as new, pod-like growths emerged from the shaft, made out of see-through hard tissue. As Naomi watched, stunned at this revolutionary specimen she had created, the pods began to fill with thick, while liquid that wriggled as if alive, his secondary sperm storage facilities coming online.<br />
<br />
The change was over. The titan on her own creation panting on the bed, consumed by his maleness. She felt movement as an unlucky fish swam into the cave, looking for food. She watched, astonished, as the residue of his pheromones and testosterone still floating in the water coated the female fish, forcibly changing its gender.<br />
<br />
She giggled as she turned her attention back to the man, who had  recovered from his evolution, ready for copulation. He was utterly perfect. The race of mermen could begin anew through their union.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
They had been going at it for hours, the gigantic man never questioning the queen, only continuing to pump into her as his monstrous manhood prepare for the father of all orgasm. Naomi was heaven, his engorged manhood rubbing all the right spots within her slits that eagerly took the huge organ in. She could feel her ovaries working overtime to prepare eggs for all the new arrivals they would have. Feel the throbbing of her womb, prepared for the challenge ahead. Leaning forward, she whispered to her monster, to her champion, gave him the first and only word she had shared during their intercourse, blessing his ears with her heavenly tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
The titan complied, his balls and cock burning after hours of lovemaking. He never imagine his new body could be outdone by anything, but a goddess was still above his ascended mortal form. With a heartfelt sigh, he released his load, knowing that this would be the first and last time he would be with a woman like her.<br />
<br />
A tidal wave of cum erupted into Naomi&#39;s womb. Every single one of his sperm tanks was emptied as the queen sucked it all up, her eggs and his sperm already beginning to combine at an astonishing rate. She swum up, releasing the monster cock from her depths as her partner passed out. She lovingly held her swollen stomach, feeling the life already stirring within it.<br />
<br />
She returned to man to the shore, where he would most likely go on to impregnate many other woman, blessing the land with a new generation of men. <br />
As for the sea... she returned to Atlantis, eager to begin her rule. Naomi would lay her eggs within the royal treasure chambers, for what could be greater treasure than a whole new race of people, all of them her children?</p>
