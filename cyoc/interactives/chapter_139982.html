<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lisa groaned as she as her vision came into focus, traveling through time was not exactly an easy process. Brushing her long auburn locks out of her face the young teen now gazed around at her surroundings. “Hey I know this place,” she whispered. “This is the park mom, I mean, the park I used to see Gloria at when she was a kid.” Standing she brushed herself off as she examined herself.<br />
<br />
Lisa was still 13, much to her chagrin. Lisa’s thoughts seem muddled as she looked everything over, she knew she was supposed to be an adult yet childish thoughts clouded her mind. She knew where she was and would be able to find her way home yet at the same time she worried she could end up grounded for not letting her parents know where she was. “Focus Lisa,” she mumbled. “Your not 13. Your an adult, you can do this. Besides you are turning 14 in March.” Pausing Lisa groaned in frustration, hopefully Lynne could fix this.<br />
<br />
Lynne sighed as she gazed out the front window of her home. While everyone was overjoyed at her return,she found her family treating her in such a childish manner. Jason and Lisa practically hovered over her now, worried that something could happen to her. Katie and Gloria weren’t much better as her sisters treated her as if she were incredibly fragile, like a strong breeze would knock her over. The fact her parents hadn’t let her go back to school after two days was also quite annoying.<br />
<br />
“I don’t see why I can’t just head back to school mom,” Lynne groaned as she watched Lisa cleaning the kitchen. Lisa sighed as she warmly gazed at her youngest daughter. “Soon Lynne,” she sighed. “Katie and Gloria are just working on a spell to make everyone believe you never left. Unfortunately with all the alterations you made things a bit different than before.”<br />
<br />
“But none of them were bad,” Lynne whined. “I don’t know why you put me on lockdown, I already said Inwas sorry.” Lisa frowned as she turned towards her daughter. “Lynne,” she said sternly. “You traveled back in time, altered the future and put yourself in danger. Yes we’re happy with what you did but the fact of the matter is you scared the hell out of us. What if something happened to you?”<br />
<br />
Lynne sighed, her mom was right, she knew that she would be in trouble once she returned. “Your right mom sorry,” she whispered. “It’s just...I’m bored, I haven’t had a chance to see Tommy since we got back and Tricia’s parents took her phone so we haven’t talked either. I just want things to be okay.”<br />
<br />
“I know sweety,” Lisa said warmly. “And they will be soon. Just trust me Okay? Me and your dad just want to make sure you are safe before things get back to normal.” Lynne groaned in frustration as she sulked in a chair. Lisa could only sigh, she knew she was a bit of a livewire as a kid but she was no where near as reckless as Lynne (despite what her parents said). As she was about to approach the girl she could hear a knock at the front door. “That’s probably your sisters,” Lisa stated. “They said they would stop by this afternoon once they were out of work, guess they decided to cut out early.” As she opened the front door her eyes grew wide in surprise as she looked at the young auburn haired teen on her doorstep.<br />
<br />
Lisa was nervous to say the least as she knocked on her front door. The young teen wasn’t quite sure how things were going to go as she waited to enter her home. Feelings of dread filled her mind as she thought of seeing her parents, no that wasn’t right, it was herself and Jason and her daughter Lynne. Sighing she now thought about the fact that technically Lynne was older than her now. As the door opened she gazed up at the middle aged woman in the doorway. “Umm hey future me,” she said meekly. “It’s ummm me, past you, I ummm...was kind of hoping to speak with Lynne, if that’s okay Miss.”<br />
<br />
Lynne had heard a familiar voice coming from the door and now curiously approached. As she looked outside she couldn’t help but gawk at the girl. “What the...is...is that you mom?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah is me,” Lisa frowned as she glowered at the teen girl. “We need to talk you. Your magic made me younger, I need you to fix this mess before I have to relive the eighth grade all over again.”<br />
<br />
Lynne opened and closed her mouth in shock as she gazed at the young teen. This didn’t seem possible, how did this girl get here? Lynne had so many questions. “Wait,” she said slowly. “Are you telling me your my mom Lisa? And your what, 13! Maybe 14. How did you get here? What are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
“I’m almost 14,” the young Lisa grumbled, folding her arms across her chest. “And the reason I’m here is because your stupid magic made me younger, while making Gloria an adult who’s pregnant with you. Now are you going to help me or what?”<br />
<br />
“Hold on a sec,” the older Lisa exclaimed. “Did you say Gloria is pregnant with Lynne in your time?”<br />
<br />
“Um yeah,” teen Lisa blushed. “Lynne’s magic kinda went a bit wonky, I was just having a nice conversation with mo...Gloria when all the sudden poof I start getting younger and she gets like all old and pregnant.”<br />
<br />
The older Lisa turned scowling at her daughter who appeared flabbergasted by this bit of information, as Lynne looked at her mom she could see the woman giving her a disapproving look. “No way,” Lynne exclaimed. “Your not blaming this on me. I wasn’t even born yet! You know I don’t have any control of my magic when I’m not even born yet.”<br />
<br />
“Umm actually,” teen Lisa said sheepishly. “This one might be on me. I...um...sort of wished me and Lynne could have gotten closer while she was in our time. I think Lynne kind of took that literally.”<br />
<br />
“See mom,” Lynne smirked. “This ones on you.”<br />
<br />
The adult Lisa sighed in frustration as she looked between the two young teens. While she did remember wanting to get to know Lynne better from her brief time in the past, she didn’t remember actually becoming a kid again. Rubbing her eyes she could only groan. “Ugh perfect,” she mumbled. “Just what I need.” Taking a deep breath she looked at the young Lisa and Lynne. “Okay...Lisa,” she sighed. “Why don’t you come in for now. Lynne why don’t you talk with.....me over here while I call your sisters.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you Mrs. Turner,” young Lisa said meekly as she entered the house. “Don’t thank me yet Lisa,” the older woman said firmly. “Things haven’t been affected in the future by...this. We could be in for some nuttiness if we can’t figure things out.”<br />
<br />
“Mom what do you mean by nuttiness?”<br />
<br />
“Well,” she said slowly. “I’m no expert but if the future hasn’t been affected yet by, my change, then we could have some issues. I might become affected by your magic or reality could alter and change things up. We need to figure that out and I’m going to need Katie and Gloria’s help. Until then um Lisa, why don’t you hang out with Lynne here.”<br />
<br />
“Cmon mom you can’t seriously want to me to babysit,” Lynne frowned. Teen Lisa furrowed her brow as she punched Lynne in the arm, causing the teen to yelp in pain. “Your not my babysitter Lynne,” she grumbled. “We’re pratically the same age.”<br />
<br />
As the two teens now began to argue with one another the adult Lisa could only sigh. Lynne was about to learn how stubborn of a kid she could be. Hopefully they could figure things out before reality began to alter.</p>
