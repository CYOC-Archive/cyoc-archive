<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Amanda began regressing through the first half of her twenties, her wild years with a lot of partying and drinking. She lost some weight, becoming skinnier as she approached her pre-alcohol-times body.<br />
<br />
Candy&#39;s progression continued, and for now, her body remained fairly stable, being done with puberty and fully developed as a woman. Though, a few tattoos appeared on her. A butterfly on her thigh, and a poem on her back among others.<br />
<br />
&quot;You holding up, sis?&quot; Candy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop saying &#39;sis&#39;. I am your mom,&quot; Amanda replied and put her hands on her sides. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? You&#39;re my mom?&quot; Candy teased. &quot;I haven&#39;t heard about a mom younger than her daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Amanda said. She looked at her older sister, wait no. She looked at her daughter Candy. Yet it didn&#39;t feel like that. Candy felt like the older sister who&#39;d grown up with her, and also relentlessly teased her. They were close in age, but Candy&#39;s body was so much more developed, and she&#39;d use that fact to lure all of Amanda&#39;s boyfriends, only to immediately dump them after they were stolen away from Amanda. No. Those memories weren&#39;t real. Candy wasn&#39;t really her older sister <br />
<br />
Amanda&#39;s body slimmed further down as she returned to her teens. She&#39;d been a late bloomer, so it wasn&#39;t long until her curves started to shrink away.<br />
<br />
Candy was destined for a wild lifestyle, wilder than her mom, but unlike Amanda, Candy&#39;s diet was less beer heavy, and so, she kept a nice figure into her late twenties, her boobs even getting a bit larger.<br />
<br />
Candy hit 30 and Amanda hit 15. And moving past that age, Amanda felt herself shrink in height. Now she had to start looking up at Candy, and her older sister was looking back, gloating at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you doing short stuff?&quot; Candy laughed, but then a big shift happened.<br />
<br />
Candy&#39;s body shifted from the before to the after of one of the most taxing events a human body can go through. Her guts got shifted around, and she became slightly more worn looking from experiencing pregnancy. Unlike her ex-mother, no C-section scar appeared as Candy&#39;s wider abdomen helped the vaginal birth of Amanda, now her daughter, to not be too problematic. The chandelier tattoo under her boobs got a bit distorted as it had to survive her belly stretching out and shrinking back down again. Candy&#39;s entire body grew as she gained some post baby weight, though she also had some serious boob growth which must have remained post-weaning. They were a bit saggier though. She was still looking sexy, still very much a conventially beautiful woman past becoming a mother.<br />
<br />
Amanda also noticed a shift in Candy&#39;s demeanor and her own feelings towards her. The rapport of being sisters who couldn&#39;t get along disappeared, and instead Amanda felt that Candy was a loving mother, albeit maybe a bit whimsical, or distracted more so as she constantly prioritized flings with various new men over being a caring mother. At least she tried being a good mother, sometimes. Nevermind. These are fake feelings and memories. Amanda was the mom. Candy was the daughter. Her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to stop this!&quot; Amanda yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure sweetie.&quot; Candy seemed distracted. &quot;Can you stop this?&quot; she said out to the room. &quot;This whole age progress-regress-thing. Please stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has been stopped,&quot; the switched  mother daughter pair heard a voice. &quot;Feel free to either exit the room or to progress or regress again.&quot;<br />
<br />
To stop the change was as simple as just asking? Amanda felt relieved, and also a little frustrated she hadn&#39;t told the room to stop earlier. She&#39;d ended up as a 10 year old. Her childish body&#39;s lack of curves was proof of that, only the bearest breast buds at her chest, but also as her age had stopped shifting, she clearly knew she was 10, and her mother Candy was 35. Except this was all because of this room. It shouldn&#39;t be this way. It was supposed to be the other way around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom! Er, I mean Candy!&quot; Amanda stomped her foot down. &quot;Ask the room to change us back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Candy was checking out her mature Milf body. While she&#39;d gained some familiarity of her new body together with the change, she also retained some of her original self, who was filled with glee and curiousity about all this. &quot;I don&#39;t want to go back. At least not yet. And since I am your mom, I&#39;m the one making the rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But? But?&quot; Amanda protested.<br />
<br />
&quot;No buts,&quot; Candy said. So far she found real pleasure in being the &quot;mature&quot; one who made the rules. She grabbed her daughter&#39;s hand and pulled her towards the exit, and even with Amanda protesting and pulling away, the pair left the mysteriois age room altogether, and returned to the rest of the carnival.<br />
<br />
&quot;Candy, you can&#39;t be serious.&quot; Amanda said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Call me &#39;Mom&#39;. It&#39;s kinda weird for you to call my by my first name when I&#39;m your mom. There are people around us you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello? Weird? It&#39;s not weird at all compared to this whole age thing. I refuse to call you &#39;Mom&#39;. Candy, you&#39;re my daughter. At least you&#39;re supposed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm.&quot; Candy nodded along. She wasn&#39;t even paying Amanda much attention. She was busy hefting her big boobs or checking out various men walking past them. And the men, they seemed to check her out too. Candy smiled.<br />
<br />
Amanda pulled away from Candy&#39;s grip. It was easy as Candy seemed completely distracted by some dude.<br />
<br />
Amanda cringed. This wasn&#39;t the future she&#39;d hoped for Candy. Not the checking out men part. She knew that one day, Candy would go through puberty and all that Jazz. It was moreso how Candy&#39;s life seemed like a total mess. Even with the perspective as her &quot;daughter&quot;, it was clear. Adult Candy didn&#39;t hold down any regular job, and more just lived in the moment at the cost of everything else. Drugs and parties, even at her &quot;age&quot;.<br />
<br />
Amanda wanted to go back for both of them. Even if she&#39;d wanted to be younger, being 10 was simply way too young. She slipped away from Candy, back towards the Mysterious Age Room. She could age herself up, and then maybe manage to bring Candy here?</p>
