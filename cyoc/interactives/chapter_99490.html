<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy woke up at the same time he always did that Friday morning. He treasured every minute of his sleep and didn&#39;t see the point in getting up any earlier than necessary.  He looked across at Matt&#39;s empty bed, no doubt he and Mike were already ready for the day.  Andy slid out of bed and made his way across the hallway into the bathroom, trying to remember the weird dreams he had last night. Was he blowing and fucking guys in them? Andy didn&#39;t mind gay people, but he wasn&#39;t gay. Weird but whatever. He figured he better lay off the ganga before bed as he looked himself over in the bathroom mirror for a moment before turning  to start up the shower. <br />
<br />
Andy finished up in the bathroom, dressed and came downstairs to at first an excited and then a disappointed looking Mike and Matt. They would not stop staring at him. After a few minutes Andy stopped getting his cereal and stared back, until the other two stopped and started mumbling something to each other about a waste of money. Andy finished eating and the three boys left for school. It would be another typical day of high school, like all the others before it. Andy stayed quiet for most of it. After yesterday&#39;s fun, he figured he better lay low for a while. His friend Jordan told him about a party that night, so at least he had that to look forward too. There was more to Andy&#39;s disinterested demeanor today. He was listen, trying to hear them. He couldn&#39;t quite tell you who or even what &quot;they&quot; were, but he could hear them. They were like whispers almost just loud enough for him to hear. If he really focused on them, it seemed like they went away, however, if he cleared his mind he could almost make them out. Did that one just say &quot;feed&quot;? Was that a &quot;enslave&quot;? Andy was a little concerned he was losing his mind, but the school day was over. He&#39;d go home, take a nap, and then it would be time to go to the party and get fucked up. <br />
<br />
Andy awoke in his bed from his &#39;nap&#39;. He&#39;d slept for more than 5 hours after school, it was after 8, already dark. Weird dreams again, people kneeling before him, more fucking and sucking. Two gay dreams in a row, it was harder for Andy to push this one out of his head. He looked at his phone, several text from Jordan including one with the party&#39;s address. Alcohol would help this situation Andy thought as he headed downstairs and out for the night. He grabbed is bike and made quick work of the mile between him and the festivities.<br />
<br />
When Andy got there, he saw a lot of the faces he&#39;d assume would be there. Kurt, one of Mike&#39;s friends, was hosting tonights get together. So there were a lot of seniors, and juniors. The music was loud, the lights were dim, there were people hanging out and chatting everywhere. Andy mixed himself a strong drink, drained it, and then made himself another. &quot;Hey Hey, look who&#39;s back from the dead,&quot; bellowed Jordan at Andy. Jordan was the same height as Andy, he was hispanic with darker skin and longer black hair. He played basketball but never seemed to shed the layer of baby fat he&#39;d had since before puberty. &quot;Hey man,&quot; Andy answered back, &quot;ready to get messed up?&quot; he gave Jordan&#39;s shoulder a little squeeze with his free hand. Jordan, nodded and poured them two shots, tequila, one right after the other. Andy was starting to feel it now. He finished the drink he had in his hand and made himself another. Now he was drunk. Andy wondered for a second if he could get pulled over for biking under the influences, he smiled before he remembered he wasn&#39;t suppose to drink any amount. Jordan was standing to Andy&#39;s left chatting to some sophomore girl, the blaring music made it impossible to hear the conversation they were having. The loud repetitive pop music had become almost white noise to Andy as the night went on, the voices or rather the voice, had become louder and clearer. Andy watched the crowd, people were getting drunker, someone just knocked a lamp over, that guy from Andy&#39;s science class just puked in the sink, two girls were carrying their friend out the door. Andy went over to get another drink, he looked back at Jordan while he filled his red solo cup with rum and coke. It was as if everything else had faded away, the music the background conversations. Andy watched Jordan, &quot;Suck him, drain him.&quot; Andy was startled, he looked around. The phrase sounded like it had been said by someone standing right next to him. Andy headed for the bathroom, but the door was locked, so he went up stairs. The house was the same layout as his so he knew it well. What the fuck was happening to him. The upstairs bathroom was locked too. Andy opened the door to what would have been his room, had he been home and went in, closing the door behind him. He just need a minute to breath. He worked on slowing down his breathing as he looked around. This was Kurt&#39;s room, and there passed out naked on the bed was, Kurt. <br />
<br />
Andy was still for a moment, scared to move before he heard Kurt snoring. The light from the moon came pouring in the window so as Andy&#39;s eyes adjusted to the low light, he could see fairly clearly. Kurt must have been around 6 foot 6&quot; with short blonde hair. He had a defined jaw line that left him with a perpetual smirk. His broad powerful shoulders led to arms bedecked with large biceps. He had impressive pecs leading to a defined six pack of abs gained through years of hard work at the gym. His abs v&#39;ed down to a 5&quot; thick 10&quot; long cock with two softball sized nuts resting beneath.  Andy had heard the rumors before about Kurt&#39;s python, but he&#39;d never seen it. Andy took a step closer and as he did the still passed out Kurt&#39;s dick got harder, until it was rock solid. &quot;suck it, drain him, suck it drain him&quot; repeated over and over in Andy&#39;s head and all around him as his eyes were locked on Kurt&#39;s massive unit. Andy was right next to the bed now, he couldn&#39;t control himself, he lowered his head between Kurt&#39;s legs and grabbing Kurt&#39;s manhood with both hands and put as much of it as he could in his mouth. Kurt moaned in ecstasy. Andy&#39;s tongue had barely began exploring before the cum came shooting down his throat. Squirt after squirt a steady stream into Andy&#39;s eager mouth. He swallowed every drop of it. He didn&#39;t notice while it was happening, but when Kurt finished, Andy realized that his head was much closer to Kurt&#39;s torso. Also where he&#39;d been holding on with both hand before, now Andy only needed his thumb and index finger to hold up Kurt&#39;s pecker. Andy stood up and looked down at Kurt. The muscle definition was gone, laying before him was a scrawny boy, not the athletic god that had been there only minutes before. Between his legs, Kurt&#39;s family jewels were now pathetic. His penis looked like a little nub standing at about an inch long hard with little BB sized balls next to it. Andy panicked, he had to get out of here. He left the room went down the stairs got his bike and went home. Upon arriving at his house, Andy left his bike in his backyard and went down to the families half finished basement. What the fuck had just happened he though to himself. Andy felt warm, like hot actually. He stripped off his clothes and went to the utility sink to splash some water on himself. The water seemed to help and the hot flash passed. Andy grabbed a towel and began to dry himself off. He noticed small budding abs on his stomach that hadn&#39;t been there before, he as he gawked at them, he noticed his arms looked a little bigger a little better defined. This gave Andy a little bit of a hard on, he looked at his dick and noticed it too was little longer a little thicker. At 4 and a half inches hard, Andy knew he was below average. It didn&#39;t help that he was also about that thick. On top of that he only had one marble sized testicle. All together his genitals could use some improvement. His short squat penis was his pride and joy, but he wasn&#39;t about to go show it off. Now however it looked closer to 6&quot; and as he felt explored his gains with his hands he noticed another ball had appeared. Smaller than the other but it was there. As he stared at these new developments he heard the voice again, &quot;their losses...your gains.&quot; And he began to understand.</p>
