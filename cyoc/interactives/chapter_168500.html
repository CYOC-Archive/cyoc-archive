<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Well, I do kind of have had this one crazy fantasy. You see, it involves a girl who&#39;s pussy is permanently spread wide open. And she goes swimming in the ocean, only to become stuck somehow where she can never leave the water. And then some fish  start using her pussy as a home, and eventually begin to breed inside of her. Finally, her body begins to change, adapting to living under water, as a mobile fish hatchery kind of thing.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You think of some wierd shit you know. Has anyone ever told you that? But it isnt a bad thing, because I like wierd shit, and your idea has gotten me very excited.&quot; Nicole grabbed your hand, and began programming the machine. After a minute, she hit the go button while holding your hand still, which brought both of you into the new reality.<br />
<br />
****<br />
<br />
&quot;Uggghhhhhh. Candi&#39;s head hurts&quot; you said, once again Candi, with all of her quirks. The only difference was that you were not an idiot. But you still spoke like one. Sitting up and readjusting your boobies so that your bikini is properly covering your nipples. Looking around, you apparently are on some kind of isolated beach, with steep cliff faces to either side and also behind you.  To your right is who you assume to be Nicole, but after a closer inspection, it wasn&#39;t hard to tell. She still had the same general facial appearance.<br />
<br />
Her boobies were still huge though. Not comparible to your H cups, but still quite sizable. Speaking of which. &quot;Did Candi&#39;s titties get bigger?&quot; You ask to no one in particular. But that didn&#39;t stop the world from answering you by having Nicole sit up all of a sudden, smacking her face into your underboob. You let out a cute sounding moan as the impact had rubbed your bikini over your extra sensitive nipples. You hardly felt any pain from her head impact too since your massive melons were very cushioning.<br />
<br />
Nicole was obviously now awake. You had to pull her head out of your cleavage since she didn&#39;t seem to hold any plans on doing it herself. It was when you both got up did you finally realize what felt off. You only had a bikini top on, and your pussy was so widly stretched open that if you wanted to, you could easily shove a softball all the way up to and with just a bit of effort, even further up inside of your womb. Most of your internal organs seemed to have been either removed or relocated because the majority of your torso was the giant cavity that was your pussy. From what you guessed, the back wall of your womb should rest at just about the hight where the top of your boobies connect to your chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, let me take a look inside you&quot; Nicole suddenly said, not waiting for an answer before she stuck her entire head inside of you. The sheer amount of pleasure that brought you was enough to collapse your legs as you began to lose all feeling in them from pleasure alone. This of course only shoved Nicole deeper into you as you fell down on top of her. <br />
<br />
Nicole began to thrash about with her legs. Luckily, your pussy was altered by Nicole to be able to expand greatly without harming you. If it wasn&#39;t then having Nicole be elbow deep, from the wrong side of her arms, inside of you may have just killed you. It was only after 2 hours of constant struggle did Nicole manage to pull herself out of your unresponsive body. Only after 15 minutes in to her escape attempt did you finally pass out from the overwhelming amount of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Since then you had been slipping in and out of consciousness. But thankfully for Nicole&#39;s good prepwork, neither of you are required to keep breathing air. And as such, you both only had 2 tiny but expandable air bladders inside of your boobs which would just store air for use when speaking or for controlling your buoyancy when in the water. So she would never suffocate inside of your pussy either.<br />
<br />
Once she had escaped, you regained consciousness immediately, as well as your pussy returned to its previously, but still gaping, size. It was kind of odd seeing your own, normally rather slender body, double in size as an entire other human is shoved inside of you. Sighing in relief, Nicole gets to her feet, also wearing nothing but a bikini top. She grabed it and yours and ripped them off of both of your bodies, making them completely unusable in the process. &quot;There we go. Since there is no reason to cover up, why bother? Am I right?&quot; She says as she looks towards you. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Candi likes being naked, but Candi also feels that Nicole should help Candi get use to being Candi again. Candi&#39;s body feels odd all over too, more so in Candi&#39;s pussy than anywhere else. Candi is confused and wants to know what Nicole changed about her.&quot; You rattle off your list of concerns while absentmindedly twirling one of your 2 long, loose strands around your finger. Contrary to your current appearance, you were genuinely reqlly pissed off and annoyed at her pushiness. However another part of you couldn&#39;t help but also be intrigued and horny about the thought of living out your fantasy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Candi, honest question. Do you practice in order to try to be cute and feminine, or is it entirely just coincidental that you somehow are able to act like a normal girl down to the subtle mannerisms? Either way, when you pose like that you look cute as fuck. Hey how about staying as my big titty girlfriend when we get out of this sim? I can promise you that I will be a loving girlfriend too, especially when we are alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? Of course Candi would never need any practice in being a girl because CANDI NEVER WANTED TO BE A GIRL IN THE FIRST PLACE, REMEMBER!&quot; You don&#39;t know why, but you felt embarrassed, and happy for some reason. &quot;And, while Candi thanks you for your offer, Candi doesn&#39;t want to be Candi any longer than Candi has to. So Candi can&#39;t be you big titty girlfriend. Sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is wrong with me? Why do I like Nicole? She is aweful, and never listens, and forces me into doing things that I hate, well maybe not hate, but I dont enjoy doing them, I think. Damn it, no damn her. That bitch. Is she slowly trying to make me enjoy being a women now? I will admit that it feels nice, but I like my old self better still... I hope&quot; you thought to yourself. The thought of Nicole forcibly changing your body and possibly your mind too had also crossed your mind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ahhhhh, why can&#39;t Candi just fall in love with a normal girl for once?&quot; You quickly closed your mouth with both hands covering it, immediatly regretting how you just accidentally said that out loud. But unfortunately (maybe fortunately?) Nicole had heard every single word as a look of pure delight lit up her face. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn. So can Candi take it that you did infact hear what Candi said?&quot; She nodded.<br />
&quot;W-well Candi didn&#39;t mean it like that exactly. What Candi meant was that Candi also finds you very cute&quot;. Again, you quickly cover your mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well I am glad to hear it. Also I forgot to mention that I made it so that you alone, can&#39;t lie, even to yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it all made sense. Why you couldn&#39;t control exactly what you wanted to say, or how thinking about your current situation brought about a ton of self doubts. It made it very hard to believe that you were not even a little bit enjoying being Candi. Because the truth was that you were. <br />
<br />
Being Candi was actually a lot of fun. But you just didn&#39;t want to admit it. You liked all the attention. You liked how your slender body was always pretty, and required almost no maintenance to maintain. You loved how your large, soft boobies didnt sag and how nice it felt to have them held or sucked by someone else. You know understand just how good a nice hard cock feels when it penetrates you. <br />
<br />
You began to cry again as the feeling of defeat washed over you. You had lost against Nicole. She was completely right about you naturally being prone to being a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what now? Why are you crying again? Don&#39;t tell me that it really is that upsetting just to like me?&quot; Nicole said with a worried expression and a bit of panic in her voice. <br />
<br />
&quot;It isn&#39;t fair&quot; you complained. &quot;Why did it have to be love at first sight with a girl who scares Candi?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god you can be such a crybaby. Why am I so scary?&quot; Asked Nicole, who began laughing.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can do anything to Candi and Candi can&#39;t do a single thing to stop you. Candi is just scared of what Nicole would do if Candi ever somehow really made her mad, or sad. Candi is scared that Nicole will use magic to punish her or just on a random whim&quot; you sob. That put a dead stop to Nicole&#39;s laughing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t do that&quot; Nicole said, only to remember that the reason you both are here is exactly because of it. So she quickly added &quot;anymore that is. I promise. And I always do good on my promises. Now we are wasting time. Let&#39;s have our fun first then discuss this later ok?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, but afterwards we must talk though.&quot; you agreed. She was right, time was ticking. And you do still want to try out what you came here for.</p>
