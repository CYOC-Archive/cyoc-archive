<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Ty wandered around the large food court at the expansive indoor shopping mall, he spotted a large table where a big group of teens had gathered around. These were all teens from the same school, and Ty saw that they were all wearing the same t-shirts. All of them were talking and having fun except one shy boy, who was sitting at the end of the table. <br />
<br />
Thanks to his awesome powers, Ty figured out that the shy kid’s name was Hurley. He was short, skinny and he had curly, black hair. The boy was fourteen years old, but he looked smaller and shorter than the other kids, even the girls were bigger and taller than him. Therefore, all the other kids were chatting and laughing with one another, but nobody was giving poor Hurley any attention.<br />
<br />
One-by-one, the teens all took turns to get some food from any one of the fast-food places at the food court. Hurley got a burger and fries, but he just nibbled on some fries, and he was unable to finish the burger because he was already full. <br />
<br />
“No wonder this kid is so small and skinny…” Ty thought to himself. “He doesn’t eat! He doesn’t have an appetite! As a result, nobody wants to talk to him! Hmm… He would be a little more popular if he gained some more muscle! What if he packed on some muscle, but gradually, over the next few minutes? I want him to have to go to the bathroom, first!”<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Hurley felt his bladder fill up rather quickly. <br />
<br />
“Uhh, I need to use the bathroom, guys. I’ll be right back!” he said, as he got up and strolled to the men’s restroom, which was just down the hall from the food court. <br />
<br />
Once inside the restroom, he did his business, when his entire body was wacked with a strange, intense, tingling sensation. <br />
<br />
“Uhhhhhhnggg!!” he groaned as his quads and calves grew slightly, but just enough to be noticeable. His chest became hard, and his flat stomach suddenly began to show a firm set of abdominal muscles, making him look like a swimmer. His shoulders widened slightly as his arms bulked up with slightly bigger biceps.<br />
<br />
“What… What happened?” he sighed, as he leaned up against the marble counter where the sinks were located. He looked up and stared at his reflection in the large mirror, which hung from the wall. He looked a little more muscular than he was a few seconds ago. <br />
<br />
Hurley was standing there, confused, and perplexed, when the weird tingling wave hit his body a second time! This time, the growth was more intense as his muscles expanded even more so, making him look like a teenage athlete who visited a gym a few times per week. <br />
<br />
“Ohhh… What’s going on?” he gasped, as his arms grew even more, with bigger biceps and triceps filling his arms, filling his t-shirt sleeves. His pectorals bulged more so, making his t-shirt feel very tight now while his shoulders widened at the same time. Lastly, his quads widened by another two inches as muscles grew thicker, wider, and deeper. His calves jutted out even further from his legs, making him resemble a cross between a wrestler, a cyclist, and a teenage gymnast. <br />
<br />
When the weird growth spurt stopped, Hurley was left standing there, staring at the mirror. Then, he looked down in disbelief. He had changed from a skinny kid into an athlete in a matter of seconds!<br />
<br />
“I gotta be dreaming! How is this possible?” he whispered to himself, as he raised up his bigger arms. “Is this for real?” <br />
<br />
After a few moments, a third wave hit the confused boy. This time, his biceps ripped apart the sleeves. His growing pectorals tore the shirt apart, right down the middle, as the muscles won the battle against the cotton fabric. The widening shoulders and the ripped, defined abdominals transformed the unsuspecting teen into a teenage bodybuilder, like a kid who worked out in a gym every single day!<br />
<br />
“Uhhhnngggg! Ohmygosh! It’s happening again! What the hell?” he shouted, as his muscles gave him the physique of a daily gym member or a regular “gym rat”. Big, wide quads, large pecs, thick arms and ripped abs everywhere as the torn shirt fell to the ground and was magically replaced by a larger tank top, which showed his mighty arms and all the muscular glory. <br />
<br />
“Whoa! Wowww! Is that… ME?” Hurley gasped, as he looked himself over in the mirror. “I gotta go to the gym for my workout later on today!” <br />
<br />
After three minutes of just standing there, he quietly left the bathroom and strolled to the table where his friends were. Nobody even said anything unusual, although this time, Hurley got more attention from the moment he sat down in his chair. <br />
<br />
“Finally, Hurley the Hulk made it back!” one boy said. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Hulky, is everything okay?” the girl next to him asked him. <br />
<br />
“Looking strong, Hulky! Are you gonna finish your burger?” another girl asked him. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Hurley had an appetite again. He was hungry! He picked up his burger and he finished the whole thing. Not only that, but two other kids gave him their leftover burgers as well. <br />
<br />
“Eat up, Hulky. Your muscles need the food!” they laughed. <br />
<br />
Ty looked on and grinned. Suddenly, Hurley was the popular kid with big muscles. He wondered who else he could change with his cool powers?</p>
