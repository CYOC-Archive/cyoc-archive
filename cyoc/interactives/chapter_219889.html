<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benjamin Tebow was not more skeptical than most, but he wasn&#39;t a particularly gullible person, either.  Like most people, he tended to assume things that confirmed beliefs he already held were probably true, and things that contradicted those beliefs were probably false,  (whether about &quot;big&quot; subjects, like politics or religion, or &#39;smaller&#39; stuff, like the quality of this or that author&#39;s books, or fundamentals, like whether cats and dogs were separate species).   But he wasn&#39;t exactly the type to believe someone out of hand if they told him something like &quot;Finland doesn&#39;t exist.&quot;<br />
<br />
An outside observer would likely wonder why the Ring of Credulity&#39;s spell pulled him, of all people, toward it.  And that, it turns out, was one of his more unusual hobbies: a fascination with hypnosis.<br />
<br />
When he had stumbled onto a few dark corners of the web dedicated to it, Benjamin found he liked the idea of going under someone else&#39;s control for a little while, of letting his busy mind go blank, and just relaxing without thought.  And his interest had only increased on learning that some hypnotists had combined that process with another interest of his: transformation.  While he knew it was all in his head, he had managed to temporarily feel himself changing while listening to the audio files, and the thought of someday going deep enough into trance that he&#39;d truly feel and see the change excited him, even if he knew it wasn&#39;t likely.<br />
<br />
But the ring would soon be changing that.<br />
<br />
Benjamin shut his apartment door behind him, and rubbed over the ring on his right hand.  He wasn&#39;t sure why he&#39;d put the abandoned ring on, rather than go straight to the lost and found with it.  He wasn&#39;t normally the type to wear something like this, but something about it had just seemed neat to him, so he kept it on.<br />
<br />
He turned his PC on, and looked through his chat app’s notifications. First among them was that one “Sprial_Mistress” had accepted his friend request.  He smiled, hoping that this one would be the real deal.  It could be so difficult to find a hypnotist that was both down for indulging his transformation fantasies, and was trustworthy.<br />
<br />
He sent her a message, introducing himself, and explaining his interests when it came to hypnosis, and asking a few other questions to gauge how trustworthy she was.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Elsewhere, the “Spiral_Mistress,” real name, Martin Parrill, was amused to see someone had taken the bait.  He knew using a picture of a woman he’d found online as his profile pic would lure guys in.  There were so many desperate nerds out there who would do anything if they thought a girl was asking them to.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it looked like this guy was a little more cautious than a lot of the nerds he’d dealt with, but there was no harm in testing the waters.  Start slow, and see if he could push something a little further.  He began typing.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress: Hi there.  I’m Mistress Martha.  Always happy to meet someone interested in being hypnotized.  And it’s good to see someone willing to establish their boundaries.  I believe that’s always important.  And you say you’re interested in transformation?  Me too! </b><br />
<br />
‘That ought to help put him off guard,’ Martin thought.<br />
<br />
A few moments later, Martha winced slightly, her clothes feeling too tight in some places, too loose in others.  Though she couldn’t consciously perceive it, her arms and legs were slimming down, her body shrank a few inches, her hair grew longer, and turned red, while her facial features softened, and her body hair became less pronounced.  Her chest and hips grew, while her shoulders narrowed.<br />
<br />
After adjusting her clothes to feel more comfortable, she continued answering “FanOfChange’s” questions, making sure she proved she was worthy of his trust.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Once Benjamin felt content with that the person he was talking to was trustworthy, the hypnosis began.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  Now, take a deep breath.  Hold it to the count of five, and release it, feeling the tension in your body release as you do so.  Sit back, relax, and just follow my words. </b><br />
<br />
Benjamin followed along, letting the person at the other end continue this way a few times, enjoying the feeling of his limbs feeling heavier and heavier with each breath he took.  He usually “played along” a little at first to help the hypnosis along, whether he was hypnotized or not, but as he let himself believe it was working, he was finding it way more effective than he had remembered with any other hypnotist he‘d worked with before.  An impressive feat, given he normally didn’t respond as well to text hypnosis.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  Feel yourself go a little deeper with each breath you take.  Feel your mind and body relaxing more and more the deeper you go.   And the more relaxed you become, the easier it becomes to focus on my words.<br />
<br />
I want you to focus on clenching both fists.  Just focus every bit of stress, tension, or worry in your body into your fists, clenching them as tight as you can.  That’s it.  Every last bit of tension that had once been dispersed through your body is all in your fists.</b><br />
<br />
Benjamin felt all his limbs growing heavy and weak, and every bit of tension fading away, all except his fists, two tightly clenched balls of tension.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  Now, breathe out, unclench, and feel all of that tension and stress slip away, sending you ten times deeper.  You feel like you couldn’t move if you wanted to, but right now, you don’t find the idea of moving appealing enough to even test that, do you?  Unless an emergency demands otherwise, you are content to simply sit, and take in my words, while your mind drifts ever-deeper.  But remember, no matter how deep you go, you will always have the energy to keep reading, and to respond when needed.</b><br />
<br />
Benjamin sighed, feeling utterly relaxed.  Martha was right.  He didn’t want to move right now.  His body was still as stone, his breathing was the only movement in the room.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  Feel your thoughts slow down a little more with each word you read, and each breath you take.  Feel your mind become warm, fuzzy, and empty, as one by one, thoughts slip away from your conscious mind.  The only things you can focus on for long, are my words. </B><br />
<br />
Benjamin might have nodded if he had the energy to.  It was getting so hard to focus.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  The deeper you go, the more your thoughts, your feelings, your memories, all gradually slip away, falling out of the grasp of your mind and into your subconscious, only coming out when you need them to understand my commands, or when I wake you from trance completely.<br />
<br />
Each time I tell you ‘Martha says it’s time to rest’ you’ll find yourself dropping a hundred times deeper, your mind becoming a hundred times emptier, a hundred times more relaxed, and a hundred times more obedient.  The whole world would seem to fade away, except for my words, or emergenices.<br />
<br />
Best of all, there’s no limit to how deep you can go into trance.  Any time you think you’ve gone as deep as you can go, that just triggers you to fall a thousand times deeper, filling the ever-expanding emptiness in your mind with more bliss and obedience.<br />
<br />
Now, Martha says it’s time to rest.  </b><br />
<br />
Benjamin thought he blanked out for a moment.  Thinking straight became so incredibly difficult, and that heavy, obedient emptiness felt so good…  What little mental energy he could manage had a hard time believing this hypnosis could be so effective.  This was as deep, as clear, as blissful as he had ever felt.  This must have been as deep as he could possibly-<br />
<br />
What had he… been thinking off?  Everything felt… so good…  He wanted to see… those word again…  To follow and obey…  Maybe try to… send him deeper…  But he was so deep already… He couldn’t…<br />
<br />
He had… A thought?  What was… A thought?  Who was… he?  Did he have… A name?  What was… a name?  Something else… in mind…  Could he… go deeper?  No…  He could-<br />
<br />
…<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  You really are, the easiest person in the world to hypnotize, and you love that.  It feels incredible. </b><br />
<br />
Without a thought, it smiled at the words it had been told.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Martha hadn’t meant that when she typed it out.  It had simply been part of a script which she read to anyone she hypnotized.  But as she went on, she couldn’t help but be amazed at just how well he was responding to her commands.<br />
<br />
Eventually, after several more minutes of deepeners and tests to see how he was responding, the time came to let her hypnotic subject get what he was looking for from this session.  Well, not just him.  She loved the idea of changing her subjects too, and she was eager to see how her most responsive subject to date would react, if he truly felt what she would describe.<br />
<br />
<b>Spiral_Mistress:  Now, when you’re down this deep in trance, anything becomes possible.  There are no limits.  Anything you imagine here can become real.  And some small part of you, deep in your subconscious, remembers why you came to me.  You wish to transform, don’t you?  And that can happen here, too.  My words are your reality down this deep, and you can follow them to the change you desire.  What’s more, I’ll give you a trigger to let you carry this change to the waking world whenever you wish, and change back just as easily.  And no matter what your form, you’ll stay alive, safe, and be able to keep perceiving my words, and respond to them.<br />
<br />
Now, my pet, let lose from your mind a few thoughts, a few desires, to please your mistress, and let her help you.  Tell your mistress, what change do you most wish to experience, so deep down? </b></p>
