<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">He was a deer in headlights, holding the dirty boxers and staring at his bulky brother. Matts rugged body still wet despite the towel, each part of him so defined and hairy. So... FUCK, now is not the time for daydreaming. Harry tries to hide his previous action, throwing the boxers into a pile of dirty clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was just... checking what was clean. Doing a new load of washing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Think you&#39;re interested in a different &#39;load&#39;, right bro?&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck, he knew. Fear sunk into Harry&#39;s heart. Cementing that he was screwed, that his stepbrother and soon stepfather will know he is a freak who loves the smell of BO and cum. He didn&#39;t feel like this a week ago. Maybe he could say that somethings wrong with him, that these weeks in isolation has driven him crazy and he&#39;s not usually like this. He continues to make up excuses and reasons in his head as Matt sits on the couch next to Harry. Despite him having just washed, Harry can still smell Matt&#39;s stink on his body. His full image only contained by a towel around his waist, the rest of his hairy self on full display. Pits spreading their stench as Matt scratches the back of his head and looks over to Harry. Harry has been avoiding Matt&#39;s gaze, he doesn&#39;t want to see his disappointed and disgusted brother. But he knew he had to face the music, he glanced at his brother’s face, and saw that he was grinning. No anger, no disgust, just joy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gets you nice and hard, don&#39;t it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt sniffs his own pits, Harry seeing that his brothers cock springs to life underneath the towel. Hard and long, pushing against the cloth as it tries to free itself. Matt was also into this? Maybe it&#39;s not too surprising, he has changed a lot. But fuck, Harry’s cock has gotten rock hard again. As hard as his brothers it seems, Matt wrapping an arm around Harry and pulling him close. In a half hug, before taking off the towel. His full hard cock now on display, resting against his chest as he starts to stroke it. Harry should be disgusted, his naked brother is right next to him, stroking his own hard cock. But it just turns him on more, escalating further when the pre-stained towel that was hiding his brothers’ girth is passed over to him. Harry instinctively bringing it to his noise and taking a deep whiff. That&#39;s the stuff, that manly smell. Digging himself into the towel now as his tongue licks up the pre, salty and sweet. Rugged and masculine. It&#39;s his brother’s spunk alright, and it&#39;s perfect.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me and dad have been doing this since we started working out.&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, Martin&#39;s…?&quot;<br />
&quot;Sniffing cum stains? Yeah, usually we do it together. He came out as Bi recently, so I’d pass him a cum sock, he&#39;ll throw me a towel. Sniff and stroke, what we call it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt gives his brother a dirty look. Harry processing this information, it&#39;s so weird to know that the other members of his family are into this. So weird to know that his stepdad and stepbrother openly sniff each other’s dirty clothes and masturbate to it. But some part of him feels like this is right, that this is good. Yeah... he confirms that it&#39;s good as he takes another whiff of the towel. Now smelling the hard odour produced from his brother’s balls. A rank and noxious smell still contained, still strong, still delightful. His own hand now moving to his pants. Hurriedly undoing his shorts, then pulling off his boxers. Tossing them onto the back of the couch as he now freely masturbates to the scent. Looking to his brother who picks up the boxers and gives it a deep sniff. Fuck, Matts sniffing his pre-stained boxers, stroking as he brings his nose to the crotch area and tongue to the wet spots. Grunting in his deep voice as he tastes his brothers seed, and Harry following along completely. Learning from his brother, mimicking his movements as he moves about the towel. Finding the finer smells, the clearer wet spots. Losing himself to stench and lust as his limit starts to approach. Moans of pleasure escaping his lips, no effort made to hide them as Matt joins in. Matt&#39;s baritone voice ringing out with grunts and gasps. The two climaxing simultaneously. Painting themselves with their own cum. Matt&#39;s sticking into his hairy chest, while Harry&#39;s coats his shirt.<br />
<br />
The two take a few moments to recompose, hearing a door open as they settle down. Harry&#39;s stepfather, Martin, standing at the door. Looking to Matt and his load with a grin, then to Harry&#39;s own mess with a wide smile. Harry once more freezes. Instinctually worried as he was caught by his stepfather. Caught not only masturbating, but masturbating with his own brother. But that worry doesn&#39;t last, he reminds himself that this is normal here. Matt and Martin both do this, they&#39;re both open about it, they&#39;re both happy with it. Martin continues to watch Harry with pride as he asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You joining us for training tomorrow? Can sniff and stroke after it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right, of course he would ask that. His family has been really into fitness since this whole mess started. Matt even said they started<br />
 their &#39;sniff and stroke&#39; since they began working out. The idea is really appealing. Getting bigger and stronger like the rest of his family. Lifting weights with them, grunting in a deep voice as their stink rises, and taking care of their cocks when the days done. He pictures himself with them, body the same as theirs. Broad, hairy, cocky. It&#39;s everything he would ever want and more. Wait, no it isn&#39;t. Harry has never been into this sort of thing. He has never wanted to get muscular and he only recently got addicted to this family musk.<br />
<br />
Some realisation settles in, something he should have seen earlier but was blind to. Martin never looked this young, he was never fit, never hairy. Matts never looked rugged and masculine, at least not to this extent. Plus, neither of them was into stench, nor into men as far as he knew. It all started since they&#39;ve been locked in here. His family have changed, and if he accepts this offer, he&#39;ll probably change too. Hell, he might have already changed a bit without realising... His thoughts are interrupted by a fist playfully landing against his shoulder, Matt punching his side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna answer?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh um... I need to think on it. Really tired right now.&quot;<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon. It&#39;s family bonding.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. But I&#39;m tired right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
He moves away from his brother, standing from the bed. Head flushed red as more of his family’s stench fills him as he rushes past them. By now he has gotten used to Matt’s stink, but moving past his stepfather fills him with something else. A new feeling, a new smell. Older, but still filled with that rugged spunky smell. Still hitting him hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martin calls out, Harry turning to face him and finding something thrown at him. His arms reach to grab whatever it is. It’s a white singlet, wet from sweat and heavily stained. Reeking of his stepfather, and causing his cock to spring to life. Harry almost brings his noise to the still wet spots, using all of his will to stop himself as he hears Mitch give a boisterous laugh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something to help you get off.&quot;<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry responds then rushes to his room. Tossing his cum-soaked shirt into a basket with the rest of his dirty clothing, moving to do the same with his pants, but realising he left them in Matts room. His room is more organised and cleaner than the rest of the house, absent of that BO which permeates his family. But that cleanness only amplifies Martin&#39;s gift. The singlet still in his hand, its scent spreading around the room, sneaking into Harry&#39;s nose. He needs to get rid of this singlet, otherwise he&#39;ll end up the same as his family. He stands at the door of his room, prepared to exit and throw this singlet in the bin. Ready to avoid this pitfall. To keep his room from this scent...<br />
<br />
But he can&#39;t. It&#39;s so perfect, this stench from his stepfather. Frustrated, he tosses the singlet across the room and falls onto his bed. Resting on his back as his cock stands at full hardness. He just came, but it&#39;s ready for another round. He can&#39;t keep doing this, he needs to relax. To focus on anything else. He thinks of Zach. Harry reaches for his phone and picks it up, heart skipping a beat as he sees a message. Five minutes ago, and from Zach! His friend hasn&#39;t sent him any messages since this all started, but finally there&#39;s one.<br />
<br />
&quot;How&#39;s these two weeks been treating you?&quot;<br />
Harry replies immediately.<br />
&quot;Weird. You?&quot;<br />
He waits for a message, seeing a reply immediately.<br />
&quot;Great. Best few weeks of my life.&quot;<br />
&quot;What&#39;s so good about being locked in?&quot;<br />
&quot;Take a look.&quot;<br />
<br />
A photo is sent over. A picture of Zach laying on his bed. Zach had always been a thin, almost feminine man. Petite, no hair on his body, long brown hair on his boyish face. But the picture that was sent was completely different. His chest full of muscle, six pack in view with heavy dustings of brown hair across it. Arms thick and bulky, one being flexed for the photo, showing veins and a pit full of hairs. His head also wasn&#39;t spared from the changes, jaw squared and features more prominent. Hair cut short, and expression resting in a cocky grin. Harry is both thankful and disappointed that the image doesn&#39;t show anything else, cock and legs out of shot as the picture focuses on chest, arms, and head. A few minutes passing as Harry continues to process the photo. His cock once more hard, mind wondering what Zach might smell like. Does he smell like Matt? Maybe something a bit lighter, less intense but noticeable? He shakes his head; he needs to avoid this line of thought but finds another message coming through.<br />
<br />
&quot;One sec, bro gave me a gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another picture, now of Zach holding a dirty towel to his nose with one hand, and stroking his dick with his other. Cock fully erect, thick, and already dripping pre onto his treasure trail and pubes. Harry just imagining what&#39;s going on right now. Picturing Zach jerking himself off to his brother’s scent. Giving in to lust as he grunts and groans before covering himself and his sheets in spunk. Harry&#39;s cock once more fully erect, throbbing, leaking pre. It&#39;s all too much, but he has to resist. He sends a message back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gonna go to bed.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright. Catch ya.&quot;<br />
<br />
The phone is once more placed on the desk. Harry trying to ignore his own throbbing cock. Trying to get the picture of Zach out of his mind. Trying to avoid the musky scent produced from his Martin&#39;s singlet. Trying to avoid a new smell that he starts to detect. Head turning to his hairy pits, they weren&#39;t this hairy before... and they weren&#39;t producing a stink like this. It&#39;s like the rest of his family, rugged and masculine. Ill-fitting to the rest of his form, but once more causing his body to react. Rock hard and needy, his own smell is getting him off? This isn&#39;t good, he needs to...</p>
