<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jess swallowed loudly as a bead of sweat dripped from her forehead. Color slowly returned to her white knuckles as her fingers loosened their grip on the chair; her tongue darted around her lips, making sure they were nice and moist. Her eyes for the most part were glued on the growing tent in Henry’s boxers, a tent that was inching its way further towards Jess’ head. Her vision was shaky, quickly glancing towards the pre stained tip of her Fathers cock; and the pained expression on his face as he tried to resist. She knew the repercussions, what was on the line. But she wanted this. She just wanted him to say something, give her the word so that she could give him her love; basking in his cocks musk; and how could she forget his testicles! They were so big and heavy now; they would feel great resting on her chin. Jess dribbled a little as she opened her mouth to speak, her tongue darting seductively to lick it from her lips. <br />
<br />
“Daddy…” She whimpered, begging for a sign.<br />
<br />
Henry’s heart pounded in response. Beneath him was his Daughter, ready and eager, looking like the most beautiful woman in the world. Her furry ears, her subtly rounded figure and her midriff coated in hot milk; some still leaking from her teats. It just dribbled across her stomach, teasing him, taunting him. Before he could reply he groaned, something wasn’t right. His pants felt tighter than usual, this was quickly becoming uncomfortable. His cock was bulging, but not because of his erection; it was growing bigger. The two lovers watched as its shape morphed beneath the fabric, it’s girth ballooning as it pushed his boxers to their limits. It soon became too much; Henry fumbled with the button on his boxers as his cock burst through, a sigh of relief escaped his lips as the bulging, purple length of his cock came barreling out. It’s length continued to swell as his head took on a thicker, more bulbous look. His boxers floated to the ground as he stood before Jess naked, his new bovine cock alert at full attention, his leathery shaft fractions of an inch away from Jess’ twitching nose.<br />
<br />
It ached. It throbbed. He could feel the warm air of each racing breath she took on it’s length, but somehow he still resisted. “Ngh… Baby…” He stammered, wanting nothing more than to see just how far his little fuck cow could take this down her throat.<br />
<br />
Jess opened her mouth to speak, a small spray of saliva leapt out towards Henry’s shaft causing it to twitch. She thought how nice it would be to help him out. How supportive he had been milking her. How he deserved this. If this was all that would change, then she could live with that. It wasn&#39;t anything that couldn&#39;t be hidden and after all, her Bull needed a Bull sized cock; and this one looked so good on her man. “Daddy let me…” She mumbled, her train of thought quickly beginning to derail. “Let me help.”<br />
<br />
Without any objection from either of them, Jess’ lips finally made contact with Henry’s new appendage. Her tongue darted along its length as she searched hungrily for the tip. All restraint flew out of Henry’s mind as he repositioned himself, circling around to the front of Jess who still had her udder latched into the milking machine. Jess finally found what she was looking for, taking his tip firmly into her mouth as her hands worked away at the shaft. Henry&#39;s hands shot down to Jess’ teats, unplugging them from the machine before he dived in, his fingers massaging her tests as the last dribbles of warm milk made their escape. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm look at you baby… You&#39;re so big…&quot; He moaned, his hips bucking a little as Jess took in more of him. &quot;So soft and round… So beautiful…&quot;<br />
<br />
Jess melted at the compliment, her own sex growing wet with need. But she wasn&#39;t focused on that right now, right now she needed him in her mouth. If her bull wanted her, he&#39;d take her. Between slurps and groans Jess managed a reply, a wicked smile as she looked up at Henry. &quot;Mhmm you can talk about big…&quot; She mumbled, giving his head a kiss. But the thought of her own size rattled through her frenzied mind. &quot; If you like me big… I can get bigger… Eat more… Become a big fat cow for you&quot; She moaned, shuddering at the thought before continuing to work his shaft.<br />
<br />
Henry was panting, his cock pulsing on the edge. He liked that idea. Picturing his little girl getting fatter and fatter. Her ass jiggling as she wandered by on all fours. Her udders sagging, heavy with milk. &quot;Jess honey… Yes! Yes!&quot; He cried, his arm tensing as he braced himself for the inevitable. Jess could feel the end approaching as she opened her mouth, taking him in as far as she could. <br />
<br />
Henry bellowed as he erupted, his bovine balls shaking as he pumped his load into the expectant Jess. The first shot went straight down her throat, steamy hot slunk coating the insides of her mouth, quickly overwhelming the inexperienced youth. She pulled backwards, only to catch the second spurt square in her face while the third landed on her evening gown as Henry&#39;s violent orgasm finally came to a close. Even now his cock still dripped, the remainder of his cum dribbled lazily onto her udder. Jess smiled, licking her lips as Henry staggered backwards, his mammoth cock growing limp. It slowly receded back into its newly formed sheath which was partially hidden by a patch of jet black fur. He sat down hard, visibly shaken but undeniably happy. His head tilted back as his arms grew limp, heavy panting was all that he could muster. <br />
<br />
The spark of arousal slowly grew dim within Jess, her thoughts still preoccupied with Henry&#39;s lust induced desires. She looked down at her stomach, her fingers gripping what little fat she had, spreading her father&#39;s sticky seed in the process. She was certainly bigger than she had been when she arrived, but now she knew her father wanted more. Even knowing that it risked further altercations; she wanted to be what he desired and if that meant stuffing her face then that&#39;s what it would take. But soon enough her pulse slowed, rational thought clawed its way back and so did the guilt. Her father had changed and she remained the same. Regret started piling on and tears welled in her eyes. She wiped her face clean with her arm and ran to him, a sticky damp mess she collapsed at his feet. Henry finally coming to as he took everything in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; Jess sobbed. &quot;I… I made you change and I didn&#39;t… I didn&#39;t mean…&quot; She whimpered. Henry was quick to wrap his arms around her, silencing his crying daughter. &quot;Shh Shh Shh…&quot; he softly said. &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault. It was no one&#39;s fault.&quot; His hand caressed her back gently, putting Jess somewhat at ease. &quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t change. You&#39;re my strong girl. You held back, that just proves it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess sniffed, her nose was beginning to run. &quot;You mean it?&quot; She asked, wiping her face clean once more. <br />
<br />
Henry leaned in and kissed her forehead. &quot;I do.&quot; before he continued. &quot;Even if you had changed, it wouldn&#39;t have made a difference. Whatever happens you&#39;ll always be my girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess nervously spoke, wondering what might have happened to herself if she hadn&#39;t held back. She could have lost her hands, grown a muzzle, or wind up like her mother. The thought terrified her, but the thought of being rejected by her father scared her more. &quot;You&#39;ll… Still like me if I change? If my face changes? If I grow a P…&quot; She choked on the word as Henry stepped in. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jess you&#39;re beautiful. Your ears are beautiful, your tail is beautiful. Your udder…&quot; Henry trailed off, confidant that she got the idea. &quot;If you change… whatever changes, that&#39;ll be beautiful too…&quot; He blushed, it felt strange to say it out loud, the undeniable truth that even when parts of his daughter were taken away, replaced by a cow&#39;s, it just turned him on even more. He fought with himself as he wondered which he&#39;d prefer; human or cow. He quickly pushed the thought away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jess, baby, if your face changed, you can rest assured I&#39;d kiss it just the same&quot; Henry smiled as he planted another Kiss on her lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmm… I feel the same.&quot; She smiled, looking up at him. &quot;I love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too baby girl.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s still early. You need a shower.. I need a shower and I think both of us need a bit more sleep… come morning I&#39;m going to need to find some new pants…&quot; <br />
<br />
Jess nodded, realising that she would need to do the same. Either way her evening gown was ruined and she&#39;d need to find a new one. &quot;Want the first shower then? I need to find a new gown.&quot; Henry nodded, leaving the room as Jess headed towards the dresser. Her stomach rumbled on the way and so she made a trip via their vegetable stocks, taking a handful of carrots absent mindedly and munching away.</p>
