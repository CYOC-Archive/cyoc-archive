<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Somehow, despite his pregnant, feminine new form, Jake was able to grab hold of the camera with all his might. With the adrenaline running through his system, he yanked it out of everyone else&#39;s hands, but accidentally went a step too far. As he pulled it away, the camera went off. The original plan to just change Tyler Jameston and Mary failed, as not only they were caught in the FLASH, but Mark as well. <br />
<br />
Jake lowered the camera and his heart dropped at what he was looking at.<br />
&quot;Oh no.&quot; He said in a defeated tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong honey, are you alright?&quot; A tall, fit man asked.<br />
He had combed, short red hair and a trimmed red beard. He was wearing a short sleeved t-shirt and a pair of running shorts, which helped emphasize the massive package he had now. He clearly looked to be around 40, and seemed concerned with Jake&#39;s (Or rather with Jane&#39;s) health.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, that&#39;s definitely Mary.&quot; He thought, baffled at the severity of the change. &quot;Oh, uh, I&#39;m fine... honey... cakes?&quot; Jake replied, clearly frustrated.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure honey?&quot; The new older, male Mary asked. &quot;Marion, could you get your mother some advil?&quot; He asked glancing over at a girl standing near them.<br />
<br />
Jake glanced around to see a 17 year old strawberry blonde girl with wavy hair down to her back which emphasized nice against her shoulders and darker tank top. Of course, she looked extremely pissed, and Jake could clearly tell this was Mark. &quot;She&quot; looked exactly like Mark, but female, like she could be his twin sister or something.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure... Daddy.&quot; Mark sighed, clearly deeply furious at Jake, giving him quite the stink-eye.<br />
<br />
As he walked to the nearest bathroom, Mary looked back at Jake with a &quot;fix this&quot; look before he went out of sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Boy, what&#39;s eating her up?&quot; Mary chuckled.<br />
<br />
Jake just gave him a forced smile and then looked down at the camera. &quot;At least we have this now.&quot; He thought, somewhat relieved. &quot;We just gotta get rid or Mary and... oh shit Mr. Jameston!&quot; He thought suddenly. If Mark was a teenaged girl, and Mary had become an adult man, then where was his former teacher?!<br />
<br />
Jake looked around suddenly, trying to see if he could see a bug or something. Mary was clearly confused. Why was his wife acting like this? &quot;It must be pregnancy brain. I gotta get her to calm down. I don&#39;t want her to put stress on her or the baby.&quot; He thought. Meanwhile, Jake finally looked up slightly and spotted what was likely him.<br />
<br />
There was a small tabby cat, only a few years old, that was sleeking away into the other room. Jake had no way of knowing, but hoped that was Taylor Jameston.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey James town!&quot; A voice suddenly called, startling Jake. &quot;You taking good care of my sister?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake looked over and saw a middle aged, slightly chubby woman walk into the room. She had curly red hair tied up into a bun, was wearing a nice blouse and mom jeans which tightly gripped to her wide thighs. She had a happy go lucky expression, but a coy smile which implied she was teasing someone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on Sarah, I&#39;ve known you for 30 years, and your sister has my last name now too! At least stop calling me James town.&quot; Mary groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s Mr. Jameston&#39;s wife.... or former wife.&quot; Jake wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright Miles, relax.&quot; She teased, strutting over and helped Jake stand up fully. &quot;How you doing lil&#39; sis?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m fine.&quot; Jake lied. &quot;Just uh, disoriented for a moment.&quot; He said, putting up a big fake smile. But, the smile only lasted for a moment. Suddenly, he felt a bit of pain coming up, and then a lot more. He started breathing heavier, and started to practically hyperventilate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no babe, is it time?&quot; Miles asked, grabbing Jake&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, let&#39;s get you to the car.&quot; Sarah agreed. Before Jake could respond, Sarah took the camera right from his hands and placed it on the kitchen counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait, I need that.&quot; Jake protested silently. Before they knew it, some water started to leak out from under Jake. He couldn&#39;t believe what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that hon?&quot; Sarah asked as she and Miles carried her towards the door. <br />
<br />
&quot;I NEED THAT!&quot; He yelled louder than he meant as another contraction started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh geez alright.&quot; Sarah agreed. &quot;Calm down sis it&#39;s ok just breath ok? Breathe.&quot; She calmly ordered, letting Miles take over full guiding to the car. Sarah ran back inside and picked up the old looking polaroid camera. Why did her sister need this? &quot;She probably wants it to have a picture of her baby... aww, that&#39;s so sweet.&quot; Sarah figured out loud.<br />
<br />
Just as Sarah was about to walk out, Mark came rushing into the room. He had been taking his time, trying to teach Jake a lesson for his stupid plan, but came as soon as he heard someone scream.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happeni-&quot; Mark began, and then froze when he saw a random stranger with the camera.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good Marion, come here sweetie.&quot; Sarah said. &quot;We&#39;ve gotta hurry, your mother&#39;s water broke, we have to take her to the hospital.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What.&quot; Mark said, jaw dropped. &quot;What!?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on we should&#39;ve been prepared for this it&#39;s been a long time coming.&quot; She said grabbing Mark&#39;s hand when a phone call interrupted her. She let Mark go and handed him the camera, which Mark loosely held as he looked off into space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit, I messed up.&quot; He thought. &quot;I just wanted to give him the cold shoulder a bit, I didn&#39;t realize me not helping would get him to give birth!&quot; He wondered. Although he currently had the body of a 17 year old girl, he was still mentally a 14 year old boy, and didn&#39;t realize that what was happening wasn&#39;t his fault.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, that was your father.&quot; Sarah said, bringing Mark back to reality. &quot;We were taking too long so he left with your mother. We&#39;ll meet them there. Also, don&#39;t forget to bring that camera there, you know how your mother is pregnant, she wants to do certain things to comfort her and the camera is apparently said thing.&quot; Sarah explained.<br />
<br />
Mark looked down and was shocked. He hadn&#39;t even noticed that he had the camera! Also, he had boobs... &quot;Wait, focus Mark!&quot; He thought angrily to himself. &quot;First we fix Jake, then play with these.&quot; He decided.</p>
