<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the shop the first thing Cindy walked to were strollers, and she quickly found one that would fit her big baby boyfriend, much to Dustin&#39;s horror and Ty&#39;s amazement. Luckily Ty had multiplied Dustin&#39;s money earlier, so Cindy had more than enough to buy anything they would need. Dustin couldn´t stop her from strapping him in. Looking at the clerk she stated: &quot;It´s always hard for him to walk, as you have seen I have more dragged him here. But he is too heavy to carry him and crawling, the only way he can move without help is a bit slow. I´m sure my little Dustin will be happy with his new stroller.&quot; The clerk even explained what extra options the stroller had. It could be adjusted to work as a booster seat for a car, as well as making it stationary, which then resembled a high chair.<br />
<br />
Dustin wanted to protest again, a bit of gibberish came around his pacifier, but soon he realized she was right, he wasn´t steady walking on two legs and crawling was much easier. &quot;No, that is Ty&#39;s doing in making me obey Cindy&#39;s every word. Please stop this madness already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty laughed at him, already making Cindy&#39;s comment true. Dustin couldn´t walk anymore, his legs would feel like pudding. And he gained a few extra kilos to underline her statement of being too heavy.<br />
<br />
Next, Cindy went over to the playpens. Dustin&#39;s eyes nearly popped out by seeing some even he wouldn´t be able to get out in his normal shape. What was this shop to have such items? A look to Ty showed he was also surprised, so it wasn´t his doing, Dustin thought. But that didn´t stop Cindy from buying one of the playpens, and Ty didn´t look as if he would stop this anytime soon.<br />
<br />
“You know, my little baby bunny boy likes to crawl so much around that it’s hard to keep him anywhere. But with that I can finally stop him from escaping. And with the right bedding it can also be his bed.” Cindy said to the clerk, who then explained that the playpen could also work like a crib, including the option for it to slowly rock to make the baby tired. “That&#39;s wonderful. I know Dustin gets sleepy when he is rocked, but as I said he is to heavy and big to do so in my arms. Oh, he will love it.”<br />
<br />
Dustin mentally screamed for her to stop, but beside some gibberish nothing was audible. Again, Cindy&#39;s words worked their magic, as his refusal like feelings turned on him. Oh, how much he would love to simple lay down in the playpen and sleep away. “Wait no, I´m not even tired, and I don´t believe this will stop when I fall asleep.” But it got harder for him to fight all of Cindy&#39;s commands, even in his mind.<br />
<br />
Ty was enjoying the show. Maybe he would add something for Dustin later, but for now he would see what Cindy would do.<br />
<br />
Cindy had chosen a bedding, green with some lines to resemble grass in a cartoonish way, before she looked over some blankets. “You see, if I have a blanket with me, I can easily change my baby boy wherever we are. I had to change him on the cold tiles in the bathroom over there, so that will be better.” The clerk nodded in approval to that.<br />
<br />
Dustin was horrified of thinking Cindy would change him out in the open. So much people had seen him in this outfit, but not naked. He started crying, which Cindy noticed near immediately. “What’s wrong baby? Don´t like the color?” she asked as she held a green blanket, fitting to the bedding she took before.<br />
<br />
But without clearly allowing it, Dustin could only start bawling when Cindy removed his pacifier and she quickly replaced it. Ty guessed out loud: “Maybe he doesn´t like for you to change him in public, as you said you could change him where you are.”<br />
<br />
Cindy looked over at Ty, taking a couple of seconds before she responded: “Maybe you are right Ty. But I fail to see what it matters to my little Dustin. It´s not like a baby has anything to hide, and normally babies don´t feel embarrassed for being seen naked. Dustin, you won´t need to cry, there is nothing to fear. Others won´t mind you being naked and you can easily ignore them. They don´t matter to you at all, Dustin.”<br />
<br />
Ty grinned at the command hidden in her words, as he could see Dustin stopped crying. Meanwhile Dustin got calmer inside. “She is right” he thought, “what does it matter? Cindy is the only one important to me, and she doesn´t mind seeing me naked.” A small part fought that, but it did little to stop him from relaxing in the stroller.<br />
<br />
After buying the big green blanket and packing it into a holder in the back of the stroller Cindy said: “Now all we need should be some bottles and formula for my baby, then we can go home. After all my baby bunny boy has no teeth to eat anything more solid yet.”<br />
<br />
Grinning at the idea Ty willed that to be partly true. Dustin would keep his teeth, but they would turn blunt so he couldn´t bite or chew anything with them without further permission. It would effectively be like he has no teeth in his mouth anymore.<br />
<br />
Dustin had eyed the bottles in fear and wasn´t disappointed in it. He looked shocked at Cindy for taking away the ability to eat and moved his tongue to feel his teeth. “They are still there. Does that mean Ty stopped her? Or has anything other happened?” He only was sure he was disgusted by the formula.<br />
<br />
They finally left the shop, much to Dustin&#39;s delight. He didn´t want any more baby things for himself. He ignored all the stares and pointed fingers in his direction and all laughter that followed them out of the mall. After storing the playpen in the trunk together with the other things there was a problem, how to get home? Dustin couldn´t drive as a big bunny baby boy, Cindy had no license and Ty himself was too young to have one. Thinking quickly, Ty transferred Dustin&#39;s driving skills over to Cindy, made the license to be hers instead of Dustin and changed her memory so she thought she had driven them here, at least for now.<br />
<br />
Like the playpen was changeable into a crib the stroller could also work as both a high chair and a booster seat like the clerk explained, and so with Ty&#39;s help Dustin was secured on the backseat next to him, as Cindy didn´t want Ty sitting with her in the front. Dustin was fearing for his car when Cindy drove it to her home, not realizing that she had his skills as he didn´t noticed them missing.<br />
<br />
Reaching her home, she quickly brought Dustin inside, already knowing how to quickly adjust the booster seat back into a stroller, while Ty brought in the shopped things for him. Once inside, Ty arranged that the stroller worked as a high chair by disabling the wheels before he went to build everything else up while Cindy made a bottle of formula ready for Dustin, as she was sure he was hungry. <br />
But when she gave it to him, Dustin refused to drink. “What´s that, aren´t you hungry, little baby?” Cindy asked. Before Dustin could even shake his head, his stomach growled loudly, stopping any need for an answer. But he still refused the bottle.<br />
<br />
As Ty was near, he looked over with an evil grin before saying: “Maybe he doesn´t like the formula you made, Cindy?” Cindy looked a bit upset at that. “Why wouldn´t he like it? I know he loves it. Every other time I gave something else to him, he spit it out with a disgusted face. That type of formula was the only thing he ever drunk empty.”<br />
<br />
Like before, her command, even hidden, worked. His disgust for the formula switched to loving it, as any other drink he liked before like cocoa, coke and even beer turned over to disgusting him instead. All of the sudden he greedily grabbed the bottle and drunk it. Even the fighting inside him stopped more and more. After all, Cindy was right, he never liked any other drinks. Very deep down he knew something wasn´t right, but he happily drunk his bottle.<br />
<br />
After finishing the bottle and getting out a burp of him, Cindy decided that it was rather late for her baby, so with a little help from Ty Dustin was soon put into the playpen turned crib. “Sleep well, my little baby.” Cindy said, giving him a light kiss on his forehead before she went out into the bathroom, leaving Ty to start the rocking and getting Dustin to sleep.<br />
<br />
Ty grinned down at Dustin as he willed for Cindy to take her time, so he could talk with his foster brother for a bit undisturbed. He also made sure that nobody would hear him if he decided to scream at Ty, before removing Dustin´s pacifier. “You will be able to speak now, Dustin. So, tell me, how do you like your new role?”<br />
<br />
Dustin was somewhat shocked that Ty wanted to hear his opinion, but he quickly used the opportunity. “Ty, please, I hate it. Why does Cindy have to have all the control over me? Please, I will change, but turn me back.”<br />
<br />
Ty grinned down at Dustin´s pleading face. “No Dustin, as humiliating as it is to you, I think it fits you. And Cindy has so much good ideas to let you be more baby-like. I won´t stop her, at least not now. Maybe a week as her big baby will help your behavior change for the better. Now, as I have my answer, you won´t need to speak understandable anymore right now. Sleep well, little bunny baby.” With that and an evil grin, Ty replaced the pacifier in Dustin´s mouth, stopping the already starting gibberish answer. With a light push, the crib started to rock, and Ty could see how it quickly made Dustin really tired. Not a minute after he had pushed the crib, Dustin was dead asleep.</p>
