<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looks to the option in the Animal package of the Chronivac and was still curious about it.  It might sound cool to turn an animal into that of a human, but what would he do.  Sure, his thought is to take a picture of some random animal and go from there, but that would lead to confusion, let alone having a stranger in the house that used to be a different species.  Not to mention that he or she would use this new life to cause some trouble along the way.  He needed to find some animal he could trust, someone that is responsible, while living the life of a human.  But who?<br />
<br />
Just as he was thinking about it, he heard the door opened and turned to see who it was.  Looking to the door, he could see Sally, the family’s Golden Retriever.  Seeing his pet, he sighed and said, “Sally, what are you doing in my room?  You know mom and dad would be upset if they see you in any of the rooms.”  The dog listened to him and knew what he meant.  As the house pet, there are some rules that she needs to follow, and one of those rules is to stay away from the bedrooms.  Jeff though was not like his family, being strict and all, he’s more easy going and cared for Lucy.  With a kind heart, he started to say, “But…  Being that mom and dad are not here for today, I suppose you can be in my room for today.  But when they come back, you have to leave when I say so.”<br />
<br />
Sally understood on of her masters and barked in response.  Entering the room, she jumped on the bed and rolled around a little bit before taking a quick nap.  Jeff looked to the Golden Retriever and was happy to see her sleeping in his room.  To him, Sally was a friend then that of a pet.  A shame that the rest of the family treat her like another pet then that of a trusty companion, always tell her what to do and where to go.  Maybe if she were human, then maybe they would treat her differently.<br />
<br />
Just as he thought of it, an idea came to him.  He has the Chronivac on his computer and can change anyone into anything he dreams of.  And since he’s on the animal transformation package that was the Animal to Human option, he might be able to turn Sally into a human.  Seems like a good idea to understand if this program will work.  Plus with Sally being human, she won’t have to worry about going to rooms anymore and have more freedoms.  Still, there’s a part of him that wonder what the consequences would be.  If Sally turned human, will she abuse her freedoms to do whatever she wants?  And what about his parents?  Will they accept a now human Sally or will they kick her out and fend for herself?  It’s going to be a bit rough for her.  Maybe he could let her be human for a little bit.  After all, his parents won’t be back home until later in the evening and that’s enough time for her to enjoy her new form.  So, with that in mind, he turned to the computer and started to get to work on changing Sally.<br />
<br />
First part was easy; write her name and the type of species and breed she is.  He knows that it’s Sally and that she’s a dog and a golden retriever breed, so they were a no brainier.  Next is age and it’s the most unique one.  Below it is a message that states that an animal’s life span will be altered to become the age of a human.  This means that if you type the age of an anima, the program will calculate the number of years it would have as a human.  Curious about that, he typed down Sally’s age in dog years, which was two years.  Once he typed it down, the Chronivac made the calculations and deducted that Sally was 24 in human years.  Jeff looked on and was surprised by that.  Whoa…  Twenty-four,” he said in total shock, “I didn’t know that two years for a dog is young adult status.”  Brushing that aside, Jeff checked on the rest of the information he needs to handle before the changes.<br />
<br />
The next option stated that if Jeff wants to mentally change Sally.  Jeff thought that it meant making Sally walk, act, speak, and feel like a human, along with the skills necessary to become human.  Looking into that, decided to allow mental changes as he checked off yet on the option.  Besides, last thing he wants is a human walking on four legs, peeing on the carpet, licking the toilet water, and eating dog food.  Next one is going to be another yes or no option stating that if Sally wants to retain her memories as a dog.  This one is a tricky one, as he doesn’t know if Sally will remember life as a dog.  But this is an experiment, so he checked off yes on that one too.  He then moved to the next option, which was duration and wondered how long the transformation would take.  He doesn’t want to make it last too long, otherwise it would be a matter of time before his family will arrive.  Thinking this one through, he went on ahead and choose for five minutes.  A bit quick, but at least Sally won’t have to go through a grueling transformation.  The next one is whether or not to alter reality, that would mean that Sally’s life as a dog would be that of a human.  Jeff was tempted in altering her reality, but then decided to not to due to the fact that this is his first test run.  Finally, there was an option of how long she would remain as a human and below that is a drop down list showing the time from seconds to years.  Jeff looked to it and was a little concerned as to how to do that as he doesn’t want his family to find out why there’s a naked woman in the room and their pet isn’t found.  Thankfully, there was an option above the time when the mode is finished that said, ‘I’ll change target back manually’.  Seeing that, he smirked and decided would wait until he’s ready to change Sally back to a dog.<br />
<br />
Finishing all of his option, he skimmed through the changes to see if he didn’t miss anything.  Once he knows that everything is in place, he moved the mouse cursor to the ‘Start Change’ button and clicked on it.  Just then, a warning message appeared that says, ‘By choosing these options, the Chronivac is not responsible for the alteration of any animal to human.  When the changes are finished, you have to be responsible in keeping this animal under close watch, as the mental changes would make this animal smarter then normal.  Are you sure you want to continue?’  Jeff nodded and was ready to click on yes.  But before he could do that, he looked back to his bed to see Sally still sleeping comfortably, not fully aware of what’s going to happen to her.  Giving out a bit of a smile, he said silently, “Don’t worry Sally; I promise that once this is all over, you will enjoy your new human life.”  Looking back to the computer, he clicked on ‘yes’ and the process started, with a timer that’s ticking from 5:00 to 4:59 and a message that reads, ‘Please stand by.  Transformation in progress.’<br />
<br />
Turning back to the bed, he watched to see if there were any changes taking place.  After a few seconds, he sighed and thought he messed something up.  Before he could even check back, he could hear Sally whimper and looked on to see what is happening to her.  That whimper soon turned into a howl as she was fully awaken and was feeling some type of pain in her body.  Getting up, she stretched her legs to get the pain out of her, but it was no use as it accelerated.  Jeff got up from his chair and looked to see what is wrong with the Golden Retriever.  When he took a closer look, he noticed that her forepaws were starting to change.<br />
<br />
The four stubby toes in each paw started to pop and stretch, extending farther and were in different sizes.  The black claws sticked out of the tips of her paws and started to grew wide and lighten to a plain peach hue.  The smaller nubs migrated up to the other deformed toes and grew as well, looking almost like opposable thumbs.  The paws started to reshapen and looked human like while the pads on her palms faded away completely.  Jeff looked on in awe and realized what is happening.  The changes are already starting and he could tell that the front paws turned into womanly hands.<br />
<br />
The same thing happened with her back paws as they were aching in agony.  All of Sally’s toes started to change size and popped in different ways while her smallest of toes grew big.  Her heels started to grow downward and cracked to be evenly level with her feet while her nonexistent toe grew and going the others.  The pads on the bottom faded away as well, leaving nothing but smooth soles.  It became obvious that Sally now had human feet to match her now acquired hands.  Jeff watched on in fascination as the fur on her newly created hands and feet receded into her skin until it reveals smooth and flawless skin.  Jeff looked on in amazement to see the transition at the starting with her former paws.  He kept on watching as the changes began to escalate pass the point.<br />
<br />
The fur receded back to her back and front legs as her posture started to changes bit by bit.  Her front legs cracked, stretched, and twisted as muscles grew in and started to look toned.  Meanwhile, her hind legs are going through the worse of pain as they reversed directions and started to shapen nicely, stretching to look as long as the arms and looking like that toned and sexy legs of a woman.  Sally kept yelping in pain as she now had the arms and legs of a female human while her body and head is that of a dog.  But that will soon change as the transformation kept spreading while Jeff sat back and watch.<br />
<br />
The changes went up to her rear and waist as the fur around it sank back into her skin and left her bare.  As that happened, her tail wagged back and forth violently as it too started to alter.  First, all the hair on the tail started to shrink to the point of it being hairless.  Then, the tail itself started to shrink downwards at the base of the spine.  Bone to bone, cartilage, to cartilage; the tail grew smaller and weaker until it was nothing but a small nub.  That said nub was absorbed into her skin and was nothing but a small coaxial end of the spine.  Once the tail was no more, her rear started to grow and expand, looking like an upside down, heart shape rear.  Her pussy, while was close to her butt hole, migrated to the front and was almost human like while the remaining fur around it shrank until it was a neatly trimmed, golden blonde pubic hair.  Looking on, Jeff could tell that Sally is going to turn into a sexy type of woman, giving how big her ass is like.  But that is nothing compared to what’s happening to her chest.<br />
<br />
The top part around her arms started to change as more fur kept on shrinking into her skin and leaving her very bare.  Her shoulders started to widen and pop, making it look suitable for what’s about to happen next.  As the fur receded around her first set of nipples, they started to poke out and grew from pennies to quarters.  Soon after that, flesh around the nipples have started to grow and started out as small mounds until growing after every breath.  Turning into pointy cones, then A cups, then B cups, until finally C.  Once the growing stopped, Sally now possesses a pair of CC cup that were full and bouncy as she moved around from pain.  As she was whining in complete discomfort, Sally rolled over, trying to get a little more comfortable.  This gave Jeff a really good look at her chest as they were jiggling like a pair of Jell-O gelatin.  He even got a chance to look at the rest of the changes on her body, as her stomach was next to go.<br />
<br />
The rest of the fur was long gone as her body from the head up was smooth and has no blemishes.  Then the changes happened as her hips started to widen and the middle started to curve, creating a slim hourglass figure.  The extra nipples on her stomach started to shrink further until they were absorbed into her skin.  Now, Sally had the body of an adult woman while the head is that of the Golden Retriever.  Jeff was fascinated by the changes as he watched in anticipation on the end of the change.<br />
<br />
The fur around her neck start to shrink upwards as her whimpering and whining changed into womanly moans as her vocal chords were altered to give her a voice.  Once the changes reached her head, it shifted the last bit of her dog like stature.  Her muzzle cracked and compressed, drawing closer to her face.  All of her teeth started to flatten and loosing their sharpness while her canines shifted into a human shape.  Her long tongue was shortening as well as it went into her mouth, expanding into that of a human tongue, never to roll out ever again.  As soon as the muzzle shrank completely into her face, her black lips lightened into a dark peach color and puffed up completely.  Her nose finished shifting as the black color lightened to peach and dried into a normal nose.  Her eyes were shut tight during the whole transformation as they were shifting as well into something more human related.  Her ears started to grow smaller and migrated down from the top of her head to sides, changing into human like ears.  What was left her fur shrank down in her face and was long gone, leaving just the small patch on the top and back of her head.  That said fur lengthen and grew, becoming fuller as it went down to her neck and shoulders until stopping at mid back, becoming golden blonde colored hair.  Soon enough, Sally went from being a golden retriever to a beautiful and sexy woman in her twenties from head to toe.  Jeff watched on and was amazed by the how hot she looked.  But he also remembered that this was his dog before and had to keep his perverted thoughts to himself.<br />
<br />
Sally then started to have a migraine headache and was groaning in pain, meaning that the changes were winding down.  What was happening was that the mental changes were starting as the dog’s mind was gaining human intelligence.  Sure she still had her dog memories, but she was starting to have knowledge of human life, from driving and getting a job, to the simpler things like walking on two.  Not to mention that she was attaining human characteristics and mannerisms.  Once the changes have finally finished, she passed out and lay on the bed looking very tired.  Jeff was delighted to see the Chronivac doing something like that to his now former pet.  He begins to wonder if Sally was aware of what happened.  Getting up from the chair, he soon approached her and gently tapped on her shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Hey, wake up.” He said to her, “Sally are you there?  I said wake up!”<br />
<br />
Sally groaned for a little bit until she finally got up from the pain.  Looking around, she was completely confused about what just happened.  Blinking her eyes, which were now royal blue, she quickly turned to see Jeff and asked in a soft and womanly voice, “Master?  What happened?  One minute I was sleeping on your bed, the next I felt a terrible…”  Suddenly, she soon realized that she was speaking to him with words and not constant barking.  Placing her hand on her throat, her eyes were wide and couldn’t believe it.  “Did I just spoke in your voice, master?”  She then looked to her newly created hands and noticed that they were different as well.  “And my hands…  They’re so…  so…”<br />
<br />
“Human?”  Sally turned to him and nodded in agreement.  Jeff sighed a little bit and said, “I didn’t mean to freak you out, but I was testing out a new programs that could change me or anything and anyone into whatever I want.  It’s basically my first try and I wanted to test it out to see if it works.  This program I have had an animal to human package within and I decided to test it on you because you are the most loyalist pet.  Besides, seeing my family treat you like what you were, you deserve better then the life you had.  Which is why I changed you into a human, to give you more freedom.  And by the way it looks, the program did work for you and now you can live life like one of us for a while.”<br />
<br />
Sally heard that and realized what he did, giving she has human knowledge in her brain.  Curious, she slowly got off the bed and stood up on her two legs for the first time.  After taking a few short and cautious steps, she started to get a hang of walking like a human.  She then spotted a mirror and approached it, amazed by what she was seeing.  She was a fine and beautiful woman in her twenties with huge breasts and a slim hourglass, nothing compared to the golden retriever she once was.  “Is that me?” she asked to herself, “My god, I look beautiful.”<br />
<br />
Jeff went next to her and said, “Indeed you are.  I have given you a chance at being human for a while.  And I got to admit, I didn’t expect you to be so gorgeous.”  Sally turned to her and was amazed by the compliment from one of her former masters.  Immediately, she rushed to him and gave him a deep hug with her breasts pressing against his face, making him nearly suffocate.  “Oh, thank you master!” she said with excitement, “Thank you for letting me be human.  I promise I would be the best human for you.”  Jeff could say anything as he was loosing oxygen over the huge assets she now obtained.  Thankfully, she had control of her hug as she let go while he took a heavy breather with his face red in expected ness.  “We really need to work on your self-control with that body.  But at least you are happy over this.  Just remember, when my family comes, you have to go back to your old form.  Deal?”  Sally nodded and said, “Deal.”<br />
<br />
Once all that is out of the way, Sally’s first thing to do as a human is…</p>
