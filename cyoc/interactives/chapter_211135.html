<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was a flash and he was suddenly on his knees, and then Scottie closed his eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is he waking up?&quot; Scottie blinked. Young faces, his friends now much younger than he, greeted him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up, Scottie! WAKE UP, YOU IDIOT. YOU TOOK MY MATURITY!&quot; Jase shrieked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, you sound like a girl and....whaaat happened to my voice??&quot; The 21 year old stared at with muscle and hair. &quot;What happened to me? I&#39;m...&quot;<br />
<br />
He stumbled over to a mirror and gaped. &quot;I&#39;m huge. I&#39;M HUGE!!!&quot; <br />
<br />
He was huge, too. His young adult years had been good to him. He was now 6&#39;4&quot; and towered above his shrunken buds. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, how am I gonna explain this to your parents?? They didn&#39;t give me permission to make you into a college aged MAN. We have to reverse this. Oh shit, we have to wait 24 hours.&quot; Danny said, his 11 year old voice almost cracking on the dirty word. <br />
<br />
Scottie tried not to laugh but it was hard. &quot;You&#39;re so adorable now, but you shouldn&#39;t use bad words. You&#39;re just a little kid. It doesn&#39;t sound good coming from you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;This is NOT the time to chew ME out for anything. You&#39;re old enough to buy beer now!&quot; Danny accused Scottie. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa. I guess I am. Hey, ya think they&#39;d let me?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No, you need to show ID for that and you don&#39;t have any,&quot; Jase told Scottie. <br />
<br />
&quot;I actually really like this. I&#39;m super huge...why do I have such big muscles??&quot; His shirt finally couldn&#39;t take any more and split apart. Scottie&#39;s heaving pecs competed for space. Annoyed, he took off the tatters of his old clothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno. You must be way over 200 pounds, though.&quot; Danny gaped and looked way UP at his friend now. Scottie was way, way taller than them. Scottie went into the bathroom and weighed himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Try 240 pounds, runt!&quot; Scottie was suddenly energized and flooded with testosterone. He flexed into the mirror. His shorts now barely fit him. The outline of his new much larger dick bulged obscenely against them. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like we&#39;re going to have to tell both our parents that I got young and he got old and hope they all think it&#39;s funny,&quot; Jase suggested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait wait wait. We should have some fun first. I&#39;m legally an adult and I can get some beer and we can drink it. You guys never tried beer when you were 11, did you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I was 14,&quot; Jase bragged. &quot;Me and my uncle at the lake a few years ago. He let me drink with him and his friends. It was awesome. They all congratulated me on starting to get tall and look more manly and stuff. Now I look like I could be my own little brother. He&#39;s only 9 and I&#39;m not much bigger than him now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You really think they&#39;re gonna let you buy beer without an ID?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have an idea!&quot; Scottie said. &quot;I still have my uncle&#39;s ID. It&#39;s in my locker at school. He left it at our place last summer and we couldn&#39;t find it for the longest time. I eventually found it in my room but he had already gotten a new ID. I still have it and kind of forgot about it. I just stuck it in a pencil case, which is in my locker at school.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...why do you have it in your pencil case? Why not just give it to your mom?&quot; Danny asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because...I wanted to see if I could replace his photo with mine and use it to buy beer and get into clubs and stuff. I was trying to find someone that could laminate it and make it look good. But now...I totally look like him. Um, sort of. I mean...he&#39;s older than me. Way older. Or...not that much older. He&#39;s like 30.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So, you look too young probably,&quot; Jase concluded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unless...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. NO way. Get your own maturity!&quot; Danny told him. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not gonna need it and it&#39;s just for 24 hours. What time do your parents get home? They&#39;re going out tonight, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s why I chose tonight. They said I needed supervision because they&#39;re going to a show and they won&#39;t be back until 11 at night. You&#39;re not supposed to leave a bunch of little kids alone if you&#39;re an adult.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I guess I better hurry. I&#39;ll go to school. It&#39;ll be open even on Saturday because it gets cleaned by the janitors. I&#39;ll just explain to anyone that asks I&#39;m picking up my ID. Then, I go get beer. Then I come back here. Then we enjoy beer together, though I think you two shouldn&#39;t get to drink more than a bottle. You&#39;re a pair of lightweights now, haha!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But...those are my years. I didn&#39;t want to just give them up,&quot; Danny protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;First of all, I can&#39;t believe how good you look at this age. You are so adorable. Second, I am gonna live the dream today and walk around as a grown up and that would make me feel so awesome. Please? I love being mature and I want to be even older. It&#39;s gonna be awesome. Only for a day. Please?? Let me have a taste of my awesome jock adult future, bro. Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. You are really happy about it,&quot; Danny said. &quot;And super strong, too!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Dude, I am crushing it. Okay, here goes nothing.&quot; Danny handed Scottie the Pubertaway and he pumped himself full of five more years of maturity. He absorbed these more readily than the first five, vibrating slightly as his body went through changes. He stumbled over and almost fell down before steadying himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa. Hey. Did you hear that? My voice.&quot; He got up again and now where he had previously shown that maybe he was beginning to have some stubble, NOW he had a full five o&#39;clock shadow. He felt it gingerly at first, then eager and then with delight, using both hands to feel the sandpaper growing on his face. &quot;Duuuuude, I look super grown up and mature now!&quot; Scottie&#39;s jaw dropped as he looked at himself in the mirror. <br />
<br />
There was no talking him out of it now. Scottie put on some of Danny&#39;s dad&#39;s clothes which were a bit snug on his frame, but they were better than nothing. His bicycle was now much smaller feeling than it had been, but Scottie could still ride it okay. He rode to his high school and locked up the bicycle among empty racks. Saturday. Janitor day. The front door was open. He walked down the halls marveling at how everything had shrunk all of a sudden. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unreal,&quot; he whispered. He got to his locker and opened it, got the card and was on his way out when a 30 something blond woman with glasses approached him. Vice Principal Tessie! <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...no. I was just getting something out of...my nephew&#39;s locker,&quot; the handsome 26 year old told her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, who&#39;s your nephew?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Scottie. Scott. Bloom. Scott Bloom. I&#39;m...not Scott. I&#39;m Nick. Nick Bloom. Like it says on my license. I&#39;m a grown up. Way more grown up than Scott.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You certainly are. Well, if you need anything else, I&#39;m just down the hall.&quot; She gave him a look that immediately made Scott&#39;s much larger dick throb against his borrowed undies. &quot;And I&#39;m a veeeery helpful person.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; What is happening here? DUDE, she&#39;s coming onto me??<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and quite frankly, I just have to say...you look very...nice. Do you work out?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Y...yes. I do. Lots. I work out a lot,&quot; Scott, now going by Nick replied. <br />
<br />
She twirled with her hair the same way girls sometimes did around him...much younger girls. This was a grown woman with...needs. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe you can help me with a problem. I would love to get a big strong man to help me out. I...I have some um...furniture that I would love to move later but I just can&#39;t because I&#39;m so...weak. I could pay you to come over and move it around for me.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I could do that. Sure. Um. What time?&quot; <br />
<br />
Scott blinked. Was he really considering this? I mean, I could use the money to buy some cigars and beer and that would be pretty cool, he thought. <br />
<br />
&quot;How about we go back to my place now? I can just leave early. They don&#39;t need me for anything else today. I already oversaw all the detentions today. So um...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can just take your car. Mine is in...the shop,&quot; Scott lied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Splendid. You wanna drive? I have a pickup truck. My dad got it for me but it suits more a man like you and I&#39;d love to see you behind that big wheel,&quot; she whispered. <br />
<br />
Oh my gosh, the vice principal is definitely coming onto me...this is unreal!<br />
<br />
Nick found himself behind the wheel of a pickup truck, a smiling vice principal Tessie practically gushing next to him about how handsome he was. He was at full mast now. Luckily, he was a fairly good driver and his dad had been giving him lessons. He eased the truck out and before he knew it he was comfortably making his way down the street, asking her for directions. He followed them to the letter and parked in her driveway. <br />
<br />
I am living the dream...holy crap...I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m actually doing this...<br />
<br />
She prompted him to sit on the couch. &quot;Take a seat, Nick. Please.&quot; She encouraged him to help himself to a beer in the fridge while she changed &quot;into something more comfortable&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I would like that. For you...to be comfortable.&quot; He gulped. She smiled and hurried upstairs. <br />
<br />
Oh my god, I&#39;m going to get laid with the vice principal!<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s phone rang at that point. <br />
<br />
It was...</p>
