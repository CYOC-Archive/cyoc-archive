<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Though Monica enjoyed munching on her plastic ring, she had to quit because the teacher was trying to interact with her again.  The teacher partially lifted Monica up to a standing position forcing Monica to finish standing up on her own with the help of the teacher.  The teacher then proceeded to stick her finger inside the cuff of Monica&#39;s shortalls and further deeper inside underneath the leg band of her her diaper and yet deeper still beyond the leak guards.  Monica, compliantly stood there and let the teacher do what ever it was she was doing.  Then the teacher pulled her finger back out and pulled back the back side of Monica&#39;s diaper using two fingers to lift up the leg bands.  The teacher then pulled her fingers out of Monica&#39;s diaper and made some notes in a red notebook.  Inside the notebook, The teacher wrote that Monica didn&#39;t know that she was wet, but that the diaper was not wet enough to need changing.  In the teacher&#39;s eyes, this was good news, because a special person who knew they were wet was one step closer to leaving the program and she didn&#39;t want that.  With the diaper check out of the way, Monica started to hear music being piped in through the room.  Her teacher started dancing and singing in a sing-song voice, but Monica couldn&#39;t recall the lyrics to the tune.  Monica looked around at the other teachers and students and saw them move in a funny way.  It made Monica laugh, and so she wanted to join the fun.  She didn&#39;t dance, but she did a sort of repeated squatting and rising like motion and bent her knees a little to get her &quot;dance&quot; right.  An hour went by with Monica dancing to the children&#39;s tunes such as Row, Row, Row Your Boat and If Your Happy and You Know It Clap Your Hands.  When the music went away, all the other children stopped dancing and so Monica stopped as well.  The teacher brought over Monica&#39;s stroller/wheelchair and got Monica to sit in it.  She was buckled in and a tray with more food was snapped into place.  Again, no silverware, no plate, no bowl, and no cup.  This time there was less food on her tray.  It consisted of cut up slices of hamburger, potatoes, carrots, peas, and it was drenched in some type of gravy, though the teacher knew that the gravy was actually beef and vegetables stage two baby food.  This time the food wasn&#39;t as warm, but it was still lukewarm.  The teacher again brought out a clear sippy cup containing her formula with a white lid and spout on it, but this time the sippy cup had two handles to be used for grasping.  Monica again started feeding herself , but because there was so much gravy and because the pieces of meat and vegetables were much smaller, she couldn&#39;t grasp the individual pieces of food with her thumb and pointing finger.  Instead, she fell back to patting the food with her palms and licking the food off of them.  She liked the food better than before because it had no salt and no spices to complicate the flavor.  It pretty much tasted bland.  She mostly finished her beef and vegetables, but not before smearing food all in her bib, face, hair, even her special helmet.  She then turned her attention to the sippy cup and downed its contents.  It had tasted exactly the same as before, so she was kind of used to the flavor.  When Monica was finished, the teacher washed Monica&#39;s hands, face, hair, and special helmet with diaper wipes.  She then released the tray and the straps of Monica&#39;s stroller/wheelchair and set Monica loose.  The teacher then clipped the tray back into the stroller/wheelchair, deposited the bib onto the tray and wheel then wheeled the contraption to who knows where.  Monica noticed a really big mirror on one wall and went to investigate it.  As she walked up to it, another kid wearing the same clothes she was wearing, but clearly much older walked up to meet her.  No matter what Monica did, the kid did as well.  Monica wanted to go to the other side, but couldn&#39;t because the kid was blocking her way.  However, behind the mirror in a dark room, many people got to see their experiment in great detail as she was patting on the glass.  The leg band of her diaper, having poked out of her onesie, was on full display under her shortalls for everyone in the room.  They gave a light chuckle at the sight of  the girl patting on the glass.  No seven-year-old would do that except one with a very very low IQ.  They were discussing things trying to figure out the best way to condition Monica to forget things in favor of doing things an easier way.  Her IQ was already very low, but they wanted to take her lower.  There were a wide variety of mental health professionals there.  One was a behavioral therapist, another an occupational therapist.  There was also a child development specialist as well as a child psychologist, a child psychiatrist.  There was a couple of licensed clinical social workers, three peer support specialists for what ever reason, and a few government officials from various offices.  All had notebooks and all were taking notes, comparing them, and speaking together to come up with Monica&#39;s individual service plan.  They all wanted to keep her at the school for longer than twelve hours, but the dormitory building still needed to be built and certified.  After about fifteen minutes in real time or what seemed like only five in Monica&#39;s head, the teacher walked up to her and said, &quot;Who&#39;s a pretty girl?  Who&#39;s a pretty girl?  Is Monica a pretty girl?  Yes, she is!&quot;  Monica just giggle because she liked the teacher&#39;s voice.  She then held Monica&#39;s hand and led her away from the mirror.  Back in the center of the room, the teacher brought out a container with all kinds o various toys inside.  The teacher picked up a flat wooden picture of a cartoon man and said, &quot;Daddy, daddy.&quot; before doing the word in baby sign language.  She then said the word again and baby signed again.  She said the word a third time and took Monica&#39;s hand to  create the baby sign so that Monica could figure out how to do it herself.  This went on for a while.  Hold up a toy, say some gibberish, and then do something weird with hands.  Monica couldn&#39;t make the connection between the toy, the spoken word, or the signing.  She just wanted to play with the toys.  This weirdness was starting to stress Monica out and she went from whimpering to a full blown wailing.  The teacher gave up, gently guided Monica to stand up, and held her hand as they left the room they were in into a darker, quieter room.  However, not before passing through a steel door with a window in it.  The teacher had t press her palm against the plate to unlock the door.  Once the buzzer went off, then they passed through to the darker room.  Monica was led to a crib like structure that looked more like a wooden box with windows to look in or out of.  Inside there was green padding along the walls, but not covering the windows, to prevent injury.  This particular box also had a solid wooden roof, also padded.  There were no pillows or blankets.   The bed itself was floor level to make it easier for extra special children to get in and out of without falling and getting hurt.  When Monica crawled inside, a dim light turned on illuminating the top with faint stars.  She also started to hear soft calming music box type music being piped in through the room which sounded pretty and relaxing to Monica.  The teacher pulled out the solid wooden door with a window in it from under the bed, lifted it up and closed it with the sound of two latches.  Monica was effectively trapped inside the crib contraption thing, but that was fine with her.  She had the pretty stars and the relaxing music to keep her company.  She rolled to her side and curled up in a fetal position.  As she did so, she could hear the crinkle of her diaper as well as the crinkle of the vinyl covered waterproof mattress and drifted off to sleep.  The teacher took her place in a rocking chair, pulled out her phone and Bluetooth headset and started listening to music more suited to her taste.  She started rocking, took out her notebook and started writing in Monica&#39;s progress notes.  From time to time, she&#39;d peer into the crib to make sure Monica was safe.  While she slept, Monica&#39;s lunch pushed itself out in the back of her diaper as a soft mushy poo while she peed in her diaper.  The diaper had leaked soaking Monica&#39;s clothes, but it did not penetrate the vinyl mattress.  The teacher started to smell Monica&#39;s newest gift to her, but did not wake up the sleeping girl.  The girl was well worn out from baby sign lessons and needed her rest.  And so, the teacher went back to peacefully rocking while writing down notes.</p>
