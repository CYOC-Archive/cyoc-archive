<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was around lunch time when Brian and Patricia stopped to get something to eat. After delivering lunch to the werewolves still locked up in the council’s dungeon; Brian seeing the cell that held Julie Stovall empty. Taken to a secure location only known to a few weres on the elder council; Julie was to begin serving her one hundred and fifty year sentence for her two counts of statue 1A violation. As Brian was nearly finished serving lunch he comes upon the cell holding his father, George Walker.<br />
<br />
George Walker ran out on him and his mother when he was four years old; leaving his mother with a mountain of debt and little of anything of value. Returning to town due to being declared dead; the slimy were-otter thought he could intimidate Emily into undoing what happen. Little did he know that the council was looking for him. Being baited to meet up with Emily, George was soon taken into custody at the police jail. Fuming as Andrew Curtis handed him a scroll and made it clear he had to make restitution to Emily and his son Brian; George told the wer-mer that if the cell door was open, he would make the fish man eat concrete. George was then taken to the council were he has been locked up ever since.<br />
<br />
“So what is for lunch today son,” George lying on his bunk not even bothering to look at Brian.<br />
“The werewolves are dining on borsch,” Brian answering; “but the cooks ran out and made you a grilled cheese.”<br />
“They kill a wer-mer and get five-star treatment,” George now sitting up; “but all I did was leave you and your mother, and as a result I get table scraps?”<br />
“You’re lucky you’re getting anything,” Brian glaring; “half the time mom was struggling to make sure I had something to eat. We were this close,” Brian making a gesture with his paws; “to being homeless no thanks to you. And you have the fucking gall to bitch about what I’m told to serve you?”<br />
“Yet your mother managed,” George snapping back; “so what is your problem?”<br />
“My problem,” Brian shoving the food tray and ensuring it spills it contents onto the floor; “is having to grow up without a father. Being alone as mom was forced to work two jobs just to make ends barely meet. Spending what little money she saved up just to try and find you!”<br />
“Oh boohoo,” George looking at the spilled food from his tray; “you want something to be angry about? I never wanted you. I never wanted to be forced to marry your mother. As far as I’m concerned, you were a mistake. So yeah,” George looking smug; “I put on a show. Made like the good father, but the moment I had the opportunity, I ditched you and Emily.”<br />
“For some blond bimbo at a grocery store,” Brian looking disgusted.<br />
“She wasn’t the first,” George chuckling; “I’ve had many women.”<br />
“And many aliases,” Brian snarling; “While mom had to work two jobs, I had lots of time to get good using computers. Skills I was able to put to good use when you told Patricia all those names you went by.”<br />
“You think a few past names will change anything,” George looking smug.<br />
“No,” Brian grinning; “but with all those names, I bet you had a hell of time remembering all those bank accounts attached to them. You know what is easy to find on the internet,” Brian looking at a concerned George; “transaction histories, old accounts. You just have to know where to look,” Brian grinning as he bares his teeth; “enjoy your lunch.”<br />
<br />
Brian quickly walks by; passing the cells still holding the werewolves. Each hearing the exchange and howling in amusement as they enjoyed seeing their current guest get torn down by a were-otter pup. Despite the punishment they will soon face at the paws of the head Luna Brotherhood Alpha; they have come to like the kid and have looked forward to seeing him handing out their food trays. As soon as Brian was out of ear shot, the nearest werewolf to George started to snarl; making it clear to the were-otter that he had no friends among the incarcerated.<br />
<br />
******<br />
<br />
“So I had another talk with my father,” Brian sipping his borsch; “was just as smug and arrogant as before.”<br />
“Anything new,” Rachael Gauldet looking at the young were-otter; she was the were-otter rep for the council. Originally from France, her family fled during the Second World War when Nazi Germany annexed the Alsace-Loraine province she hailed from. Rachael has only a teenager then.<br />
“He said I was a mistake,” Brian looking angry; “and that he was forced to marry mother.”<br />
“I hope you don’t intend to have me speak to the jerk,” Patricia looking at Rachael and speaking in French; “I was repulsed with his slick tongue and honeyed words.”<br />
“Relax,” Rachael answering in French; “I doubt we will get anymore from him.”<br />
<br />
Brian looking at his were-beaver lover and Racheal as they continue to speak in French; Patricia originally from Fort Vermillion Alberta Canada, she was both fluent in French and English. Disappointed that Moon Lake High did not offer any French language courses; Patricia soon spent most of her time with Rachael Gauldet at the council, speaking primarily in French. At times it drove Brian made that he didn’t know what the two were saying.<br />
“I wasn’t lying when I told him,” Brian looking at his lunch; “that it’s easy to find accounts associated with his aliases. I just never said to him that it will take time.”<br />
“Let the professionals handle that,” Rachael answering; “finish your lunch. Oh and Brian,” Rachael looking at the were-otter; “no more shoving the food try so it spills onto the floor. It’s not your call to starve the prisoners. Even if said prisoner is your father.”</p>
