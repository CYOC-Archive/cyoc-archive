<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen turned around to find Lisa the small, junior cheer-leader.  The elfish girl looked up at Jen in wonder and sympathy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Lisa?&quot; Jen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw you crying.  Are you alright?&quot; Lisa said.  The little girl brushed a bit of hair out of her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jen thought for a moment.  How much could she really trust this girl?  Jen remembered how when she was trying to work her way up to cheer-captain she had been snooping about all the other girls, trying to find anything she could turn to her advantage.  Was Lisa Just trying to hurt Jen to take her place?<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave me alone, Lisa.  There is nothing you can do to help me,&quot; Jen said.  I can't even speak the words to pass the curse.  How can I give it to someone else so that they can fix me, if I can't speak?<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?  Just tell me what's wrong and I will try to help.&quot;  Lisa was firmly not going away.  She seemed determined to help.<br />
<br />
Jen considered her options.  There were few.  &quot;I've been cursed by magic to turn into a sex-toy, Lisa.  By tomorrow I will be nothing more than a rubber balloon in the shape of a naked woman.  I will remain like that until someone uses me for a cheep, dirty thrill.  Then if I'm lucky, I will get to do the whole thing again the next day.  How can you help?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa frowned in thought.  Jen almost stomped away when Lisa suddenly spoke.  &quot;Why don't you just give the curse to someone else?  They can turn you back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jen laughed.  &quot;You don't think I haven't thought of that already?  The guy who gave me the curse thought of that too.  I can't say the curse or I black out from an orgasm.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Lisa seemed almost interested in the thought.<br />
<br />
Jen was going to say more when she suddenly felt a new sensation in her chest.  Jen looked down to find that her nipples were forming two sharp peeks in her sweater.  Jen ran a hand over them to calm them down but found that they were stiff.  Stiff but oddly pliable.  It was as if they were made of solid rubber but were sitting on a hollow base of flexible material.  Jen tucked her hand under her top and felt about.  She feared the curse had now spread to her breasts.<br />
<br />
She was right.  She could feel the nipples were now made of stiff rubber.  They felt larger than ever.  They were knobby and erect.  Almost like the nipples that could be found on baby bottles.  Jen shivered with slight revulsion.  What if they really were like baby-bottle nipples.  Would they start leaking milk?<br />
<br />
Behind those Jen found her breasts were now made of the same peachy rubber the rest of her body was turning into.  She squeezed one mound and found it was like her ass; hollow under a thick layer of rubber.  Jen pulled her hand back from under her top.  &quot;Lisa, I don't think you can help me very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then Jen felt her sweater start to move on her body.  Jen and Lisa both noticed the fabric start to get tight about Jen's breasts.  Jen watched as her breasts started to inflate.  Slowly, like her ass, her breasts became rounder and larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my gosh,&quot; Lisa said, &quot;your blowing up!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't talk stupid,&quot; Jen said.  Her breasts were filling up her cheer-top like two round balloons had been shoved under there.  He bra became loose and the breasts pushed out from the half cups.  If it had not been held in by the top, Jen's bra would have slipped under her breasts.  As it was, Jen's breasts continued to inflate stretching the sweater out.  The round masses sat high on her chest and ceased to sag normally.  They took on the appearance of two large balls.  When they finally stopped growing Lisa was wide-eyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are those real?  Did that really just happen?  Ohmygosh, you're like as big as basketballs,&quot; Lisa continued to babble.<br />
<br />
Jen had to agree with her.  They were almost as big as basketballs.  Jen struggled to unclasp her bra, thrusting her breasts out forward.  With her focus on the job of getting the useless bra out from under her top Jen was not paying attention to her breasts.  That was until she pushed the excited Lisa right over.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm so sorry Lisa,&quot; Jen said.  She tried to help the little girl up from the floor but the suddenly huge chest made this simple task difficult.  Lisa eventually regained a standing position but not until after she had been subjected to a few more hits from the breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how I am going to do cheer practice today with these,&quot; Jen moaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could have breasts like that,&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
Jen looked at her side-wise.  &quot;You must be mad.  No one would want these.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lisa looked hurt.  &quot;I would.  I have always wanted to be busty but I stopped growing.  Now I am just small.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Small isn't bad, Lisa,&quot; Jen said.  She felt funny giving advice to this girl.  Jen had never been the sort of person to care what others wanted.  &quot;You would probably look silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't care.  I would just like to have it for a while.  Or maybe just every once in a while.  I know you could give me huge tits with the curse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't say the curse Lisa.  That is the whole problem.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what if I found a way for you to fix that?  Would you give me huge boobs?  Then I would fix you and we would be even.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can try.&quot;  The bell rang suddenly.  Jen stuffed her bra into a spare pocket of her bag and turned to go to biology.  &quot;If you think of anything just text me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Lisa called back.  Lisa did not move from watching Jen's boobs until Jen had been lost around the corner.  Then she ran to her own class.  She would find a way to get a pair of inflatable tits.</p>
