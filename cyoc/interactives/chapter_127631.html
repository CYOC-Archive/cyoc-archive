<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lucile just smiled when she saw semen gushing endlessly from her son&#39;s rod. His crotch and pubes were drowned because of all the cum that Raul had produced from his furballs which for sure were making more for his next session.<br />
<br />
&quot;This kid is a real hunk.&quot; Lucile said still lost in ecstasy. &quot;If he won&#39;t give me grandchildren soon I&#39;ll have to teach him how to woo a woman with his meaty pal.&quot;<br />
<br />
While she was distracted looking at her 20 year old baby, her phone was still working with the Priapus Tool app. A buzzing sound announced her that something had happened on the device. She recovered herself and took her phone to check what&#39;s going on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, another target has appeared!&quot; She said a little bit surprised. &quot;Noah? The Schapiro&#39;s child?! He&#39;s only 6 years old!&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked at Noah&#39;s info displayed on her phone and she was interested by what she saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently this boy is under the Priapus effect too...&quot; She smiled mischievously. &quot;Let&#39;s see what I can obtain from this jewish kid, he he.&quot;<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Noah was cleaning his bedroom. His father used to ask him to clean it before he took him to the movies as all sundays. It was his favorite thing to do, so Noah was doing his best to finish his chore.<br />
<br />
Shortly before he finished his father came in and watched his son organizing his toys near the window. He smiled and rubbed his thin beard a little meanwhile. When Noah finished he smiled at his dad and hugged him. He liked to feel his strong body, it makes him feel protected like a superhero.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready dad!&quot; Noah said happily. &quot;Can we go to the movies now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, Noah. But first you need brush your hair.&quot; His father said. &quot;It&#39;s a little messy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s like daddy!&quot; Noah laughed. &quot;I want to have a big afro like you when I&#39;m old!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will have!&quot; His father replied. &quot;But for now you need to change your clothes too. Let me look for some clothing for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
When his father turned back to look at the closet Noah felt an electric energy going through him. He didn&#39;t know that it was Lucile who had used the Priapus Tool on him at that moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy, I feel funny.&quot; Noah said to his father who turned in the right moment to see his son go through puberty and beyond in seconds. In front of his eyes there was a man where an instant ago was a boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noah?!&quot; His father said incredulously. &quot;What happened to you?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know dad!&quot; Noah begin to cry. &quot;Why I&#39;m so big?!! Buahh!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh...&quot; Noah&#39;s father said. &quot;Don&#39;t cry. I don&#39;t want your mother to find this out. I&#39;ll look for a solution. Jeez, this is a shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!!&quot; Noah said between sobs. &quot;You said a bad word!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, buddy.&quot; His father said. &quot;Is just that I can&#39;t believe what I saw! Holy shit! This is impossible you are as old as me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! You said it again!&quot; Noah yelled. &quot;I&#39;m really scared! what are we going to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First you need some clothes. I don&#39;t feel too comfortable seeing another man&#39;s junk...&quot; Noah&#39;s dad said. &quot;And call me by my name for now, Samuel... er, Sam... it&#39;s weird to be called dad by a grown man.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, dad... I mean, Sam.&quot; Noah said. &quot;I don&#39;t have any clothes which could fit me right now. Can you give me some?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, of course.&quot; Sam said. &quot;But I don&#39;t want to let you alone... We don&#39;t know if something else could happen! Come with me to my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah followed his dad to his bedroom. They both were scared and moved erratically. Noah tried to grab his father&#39;s hand but when Sam felt the rough skin from another man he aparted his hand from him. He knew that man was his little son. He saw him growing in front of his eyes but that... was... just... unbelievable.<br />
<br />
When they arrived to Sam&#39;s bedroom they heard a sound coming from another room.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your mother!&quot; Sam said. &quot;Hurry! Get in! I&#39;ll distract her!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam pushed Noah inside and he stayed outside waiting to his wife to arrive. She was there after a few minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey honey!&quot; His wife said. &quot;Ready for the movies? I&#39;ll see if Noah is ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!!&quot; Sam stopped her. &quot;I&#39;ve already gone to see him and well... he was a little worried about some things... you know...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What things?&quot; His wife said suspecting a little. &quot;Is he sick or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no... you know... I mean, man things.&quot; Sam said completely nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man things?&quot; His wife answered. &quot;He&#39;s six, Sam. There are still many years left before he reaches puberty. You can give him The talk in five years. Don&#39;t worry.&quot;<br />
<br />
-Shit! The talk!- Sam thought. -I must give it to Noah! He must be really confused!<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Sam? I think that you could have a good father and son time today if that&#39;s what you meant.&quot; She said. &quot;I can hang out with Lucile meanwhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; Sam almost yelled. &quot;I think we need that father and son shit you said!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! Watch out with your mouth!&quot; His wife said. &quot;I don&#39;t want that Noah learns that language!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on! He will learn it sooner or later!&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; His wife yelled. &quot;But when he becames twenty or something! Not now!&quot;<br />
<br />
-You don&#39;t have idea...- Sam thought as he watched his wife going out of the house. -Now, to deal with my twin-like son... ah! And I must give him that talk... Shit!&quot;</p>
