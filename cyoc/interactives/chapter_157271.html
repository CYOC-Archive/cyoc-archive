<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John picked Allie and Mark said that he&#39;d check up on the two later after he got everyone going. John said &quot;Um, Hi I&#39;m Jane, and just transferred in.&quot; <br />
Allie smiled and said &quot;Hi Jane, I&#39;m Allie. Actually I&#39;m thankful you&#39;re here to help me... I&#39;m a little behind. Measuring is tricky isn&#39;t it? You can never really get enough into the measuring cups... or they overfill.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;You know you could just smooth off the excess with a knife or something right?&quot; <br />
&quot;Ummm... I&#39;m not very good at this...&quot; Allison sighed as she took out her chilling batter... Not the best batter but it could easily be turned into something good. John checked the recipe they need and-<br />
<br />
John was surprised when she had been invited to Allie&#39;s sleepover. The girl may have been a bit slow but she was a sweetheart. Sure John had issue with Saya who had been invited, and didn&#39;t enjoy Nelly&#39;s  company since she was Saya&#39;s little lackey. However it was a nice gesture. <br />
&quot;-and no matter how much frosting we put on our &quot;cake&quot; had the consistency of a hockey puck.&quot; John explained. <br />
Allie was looking at her knees and said &quot;I&#39;m not sure where we went wrong, at first it was originally as soft as a pillow.&quot; <br />
The kinda bitchy Saya asked &quot;So... why are you even here miss?&quot; <br />
Allie said &quot;Oh I invited her! I thought it&#39;d be nice for the Jane here since she&#39;s new to the school.&quot; <br />
Saya whispered something with Nelly and then said &quot;Right, it&#39;s totally good to see what the new girl is like in person with certain rumors going around. Silky may be a kind soul, but priestesses are look at skeptically you know?&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;So... what are you saying?&quot;<br />
Saya said &quot;Oh you know, some people seeing glimpses of the Priestess of Chronos... some rumors about how you look exactly like her... Something about Silky suddenly moving an inch to the right during a presentation suddenly... A Transfer Student transferring in the following school day.&quot;<br />
John sighed and asked &quot;And what do you want from me exactly?&quot;<br />
Saya said &quot;Oh it&#39;s simple. Daddy was thinking of trying to do some work with some Priestesses, and open up a shrine or two. You see at a mall he works for a lot of store are closing meaning there are some vacant lots. They still have enough and thought of doing a little remodeling here, a change there, and since priestesses are popping up. Why not try to put a shrine or two if they could find a priestess.&quot; John thought about it. He assumed that a shrine would probably be a good idea, and it wasn&#39;t like Chronos was vetoing the idea. Saya said &quot;You could talk some details with my dad later about things like a wage or details if you want. But are you interested?&quot; John nodded and Saya said &quot;Great, say what exactly do you do?&quot; <br />
John raised an eyebrow and asked &quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
Saya sighed and said &quot;It&#39;s common knowledge that all you priestesses seem to have some sorta trick. Like Silky having some sort of body swapping thing or whatever.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Well... how about I just showed you.&quot; and everyone in the room went from pretty teenagers in form fitting pajamas into cute little girls in fluffy pajamas. <br />
Nelly just noticing things in the room getting bigger blurted out &quot;Did you just make me smaller?!?&quot; the normally short girl&#39;s issue being exacerbated by getting younger. Although when looking at everyone else actually noticed that she was actually about the same size as everyone else for once.  <br />
John giggled and said &quot;I just made us all cute.&quot; <br />
Saya asked &quot;Um... can you make us older or are you just a fountain of youth on legs?&quot; <br />
John sighed and said &quot;I&#39;m the Priestess of Chronos, the god of time, I control time in general.&quot; she demonstrated as she grabbed a pillow, tossed it up in the air and proceeded to make it float up and down as she rewound it back up into the air and let it fall. <br />
Allie already not being the quickest tool in the shed with youth not helping things muttered &quot;Wait... so if we&#39;re rewound? Then how do I remember what our pancake tasted like?&quot; <br />
John tried to think about it for a second and then decided to just say &quot;Cause... magic? Either way anyone want to see what we look like as proper adults in like our thirties or so?&quot; <br />
Nelly looked to John with puppy dog eyes and asked &quot;Oh yes Pwease, pwetty pwease with swugwar on twop!&quot; John looked past Nelly for a second and Saya nodded while Allie seemed... lost in thought. <br />
John said &quot;Alright, bit of a warning puberty can hit you like a truck sometimes.&quot; <br />
Saya and Nelly were sitting down and while Nelly seemed excited Saya hearing John&#39;s warning asked &quot;Wait, what?&quot; and then was surprised as her bountiful breasts leaped out of her chest along with other growths that came with a little girl blossoming into a woman. Nelly&#39;s growth was slow, but in her early twenties bloomed into a nice average sized woman. <br />
Nelly stood up and said &quot;Woo! Saya Saya! Look I&#39;m all tall and sexy now!&quot; the adult woman said in PJ shorts and a tube top. She completely flat but far from being busty, but at least she had a nice lean slender figure with some decent hips. Saya on the other hand... seemed more faded? Her once very vibrant hair was less. <br />
Saya squinting asked &quot;Huh? Is this a side effect of your magic Jane?&quot; <br />
Nelly asked &quot;Saya you ok?&quot; <br />
Saya said &quot;Why is everything so blury and... what are?&quot; as she looked at her cleavage and found a pair of glasses clipped to her shirt... her heart skipped a beat as she put them on. &quot;I need glasses?!?&quot; then looked at her long hair and said &quot;My hair! It&#39;s volume is gone and... Are my breasts smaller?!?&quot;<br />
Nelly said &quot;sure you don&#39;t look the best bu- I mean it&#39;s not like things are set in stone. You can always take precautions and maybe things will go better right?&quot;<br />
Saya normally bitchy and short tempered surprised everyone as she simply sighed and said &quot;I guess you&#39;re right. I haven&#39;t seen an optometrist in years. I should probably try to schedule an appointment. Maybe cut back on some hair dye...&quot; <br />
Nelly asked &quot;Who are you and what have you done with Saya?&quot; <br />
Saya thought and said &quot;...Yeah... I don&#39;t really feel like my normal self... I don&#39;t entirely hate it but- Say Allie you ok? You&#39;ve been spaced out there for awhile.&quot;<br />
John didn&#39;t age herself or Allie mostly because she had been spaced out thinking about... whatever. Allie snapped out of her trance and asked &quot;Wha? Oh um... Just thinking about... Stuff... Ah Nelly your so big and pretty!&quot;<br />
John sighed and said &quot;This may have been a mistake... I&#39;ll get you back to normal.&quot; then John&#39;s magic aged her and Allie back to normal. <br />
Saya asked &quot;Hey Jane... can I go back to being a teen?&quot; and then the years melted off the woman as she returned back to normal. Saya looking tired said &quot;I think I&#39;m going to get something to drink.&quot; <br />
John said &quot;Mind if I joined you? I&#39;m a little thirsty myself.&quot; Saya getting up motioned for John to follow if she wanted.<br />
<br />
Downstairs in the kitchen two men were sitting at a table chatting with some beers between them. Saya was chatting on the way &quot;-and then Irene, wait the light&#39;s on.&quot; They stopped talking and looked as one of their daughters came down along with the new girl. Saya surprised said &quot;Daddy, I thought you were at a business meeting?&quot; <br />
One of them men sighed and said &quot;One guy was sick, another caught up in traffic and let us know he wouldn&#39;t be coming... and considering the other person who was going to be at that meeting is right here. Well we just thought we&#39;d talk a little bit of business over a beer or two.&quot; <br />
The second man sighed and said &quot;Not much we can really do in these meetings though. Maybe refine out plans a little but without an actual willing Priestess-&quot; <br />
Saya giggled and said &quot;What are the odds? Our new Transfer Student here happens to be a Priestess.&quot; <br />
Her father asked &quot;Is that a fact or just some gossip?&quot; at which point John grabbed a peanut from the table, tossed it in the air, and just let it stay in the air. &quot;...Yep... that&#39;s kind of a magic thing.&quot; <br />
Saya asked &quot;By the way daddy, think we could schedule an optometrist appointment soon?&quot; <br />
her father raised an eyebrow and said &quot;Sure... By the way did Saya already tell you what we&#39;re trying to do?&quot; <br />
John asked &quot;Open up a shrine at an empty store in the mall?&quot;<br />
The man chuckled and said &quot;A little more than that, but that&#39;s the basic idea. We hope that the Shrine will generate more interest and traffic to our mall. You would also get a nice shrine for your god and receive a percentage of a donation... or minimum wage. whichever is higher.&quot;<br />
 John said &quot;I don&#39;t really have much formal identification yet... I&#39;m trying to get proof that I am who I am right now-&quot; <br />
The man said &quot;You think that&#39;s a dealbreaker? There aren&#39;t a ton of Priestesses around so as long as you are interested we are willing to jump through as many hoops as we need to.&quot; The man took something out of his pocket and then held out a business card. Please call if you have any questions.&quot; <br />
<br />
Thankfully for John her DNA tests showed up and with all the ways male Priestesses seemed to work John was able to use her old identification... or at least her social security.  Meaning that whole job thing at the mall suddenly became possible to become a legal employee for.</p>
