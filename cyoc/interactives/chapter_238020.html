<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cael headed into his bedroom. Trying on some clothes, he quickly realized that he did not only look exactly life his father, he would now have to wear some of his fathers clothes. <br />
	<br />
Walking out of his room to go and borrow something from his dad, Cael noticed that Alex had not moved from where he had been standing. “Alex, what’s going on?”<br />
	<br />
“Well, you said to get dressed, but I don’t think I’m going to fit in your brother’s clothes anymore.”<br />
	<br />
“Right.” Cael replied, keeping his eyes locked on Alex tusked face so as not to get distracted. “My clothes don’t fit me either. I’m going to get some of my days. Here, wrapped this blanket around yourself.” Cael continued, pulling the item off the back of the couch and handing it to Alex.<br />
	<br />
“Thanks.” Alex grunted out, realizing what Cael was trying to do. As much as Alex wanted to pin the other guy to the floor and shove his cock back up his ass, dominating the young orcblood, Alex was able to control his urge.<br />
	<br />
Alex sat down on the couch. Letting his mind wander, Alex thought about everything that he had been through up until this point. Dealing with the wolves, getting turned into a orc, quickly followed by fucking Cael, Alex wondered if he would ever get back to his home, or even if he wanted to. Alex could not deny that this world fit him a lot better. Hell, even becoming an orc was not that bad if he really thought about it. So if there was not way for him to change back, Alex guest that it would not be so bad. It would give him a chance to start again, without all the baggage and problems that he had in his old world. Though he still wanted to know one way or the other.<br />
	<br />
Cael finally came out of his father’s room in clothes that actually fit him. “Okay. Knowing my brother, he will already have something that would fit someone your size hidden away in his room. I just don’t know which hiding place he would be using.”<br />
	<br />
“Need some help looking?” Alex offered, standing while making sure the blanket did not drop.<br />
	<br />
“No. I don’t need any help, because I’m pretty sure I know which hiding place he is using. Just follow me.” Leading Alex into Roy’s bedroom, Cael quickly found a box tucked away in a corner. Inside, they found a leather kilt, some underwear, a leather vest, a belt, and heavy duty leather boots. All were of a monstrous size, but when Alex tried them on, he was surprised at how well they fit.<br />
	<br />
Walking out of Roy’s room, Alex found Cael looking out a window. Clearing his voice, “How do I look?”<br />
	<br />
“Like an orc. If your wondering if you look like one the orc from up north, you don’t. Not enough scars, hairs not long enough and you would need to add a few more things before you would pass.”<br />
	<br />
“Well then, why don’t we head out?” Alex replied. But looking out the window facing the road, he added, “Though I don’t think we will need to go to far. Look there.”<br />
	<br />
Walking outside and heading down the dirt road, they soon had spotted a young man walking down the road towards them. The young man looked very beat up, and Alex could see that he had a slightly green complexion. Cael, upon spotting the guy quickly ran towards him with Alex following close behind. As they approached, whom Alex presumed was Roy, he say a bit of light enter the smaller man’s eyes before he dropped to the ground.<br />
	<br />
Rushing to his brother, Cael gently pick him up off the ground and turned back toward the farmstead, moving at a steady pace. Quick enough that we were eating up the ground, but slow enough to prevent Roy from suffering any further injury.<br />
	<br />
“So this is your brother.” Alex said as they walked down the road.<br />
	<br />
“Yep. And he is a complete and total moron. As soon as he wakes up, I’m going to make him suffer so much that he will never even think about orc culture and pride.” Alex could hear the anger in Cael’s voice, but Alex mostly heard concern.<br />
	<br />
After a while of just standing behind Cael, Alex cleared his throat, “Do you need me to do anything around here?”<br />
	<br />
Taking his eyes off his brother, “Fuck!” Cael exclaimed. “I need to get the chores finished.”<br />
	<br />
“I’ll help out with everything. Just show me how, and you can come back.”<br />
	<br />
Looking up at the massive orc, Cael gave a nod. “Most of it is pretty straight forward. Follow me.”<br />
	<br />
Over the corse of the next two hours, Cael showed Alex everything that had to be done. Most of it was simple manual labor, but there was a certain way those chores needed to be completed. With Cael back with his brother, Alex continued the work. Soon though, Alex noticed that he was enjoying the labor that would have been backbreaking for most. He loved the way that his new muscles flex, or how things that would have been impossible for him to lift before were only a little heavy. By the end of the day, Alex was not only not tired, but really enjoying the smell that was coming off his body.<br />
	<br />
Throughout the day, Alex also had had to relieve his energy in other ways. The amount of cum that came out of his green cock was surprising until he thought of how much he had emptied into Cael.<br />
	<br />
Not wanting to bother Cael as he watched over his brother, Alex headed to the barn. It was getting late and he knew he needed to sleep. Alex was not noticing his musk anymore, so he did not bother to even dump some water over his body. He simply laid down in the hay, and after relieving himself one more time, Alex relaxed and fell asleep.<br />
	<br />
For the next two days, Alex did the chores around the farm as Cael watched over his brother. On the third day, because the heat was finally getting to him, Alex was dumping some water over his sweaty body when Cael came out.<br />
	<br />
“Hey Alex,” Cael called, “How are things going?”<br />
	<br />
“Good.” Alex replied, “I might not be as fast as you, but I getting everything done.”<br />
	<br />
“That’s great. Finish cleaning up and come inside, my idiot of a brother has finally stopped going in and out of consciousness enough, and I want you to meet him.” Sighing, “I’ve already explained to him what happened to us. He was pissed when I told hi what happened to you. Apparently, it was suppose to be Roy looking all big and sexy.”<br />
	<br />
When Cael said sexy, Alex shot a glance at his friend, but Cael did not seem to have realized what he said.<br />
	<br />
“Though, I should warn you.” Cael continued, “When I explained what happened to me, he got this look in his eyes. I told him not to even think of trying anything with you, but this is Roy we’re talking about.”<br />
	<br />
“I wouldn’t mind he tried something with me thought.” Alex replied, but seeing the uncomfortable look on Cael’s fae, “Anyway, he’s going to need to be able to get out of bed and make it to the barn, and after only two days, I don’t think he will be up to it.”<br />
	<br />
“Just, let him down easily when he tries something.”<br />
	<br />
Alex did not respond. He didn’t think that it would matter, but deep down, Alex just really didn’t care. He was not about to turn down an easy lay. While this had not been the case before his transformation, orc Alex had needs, and they were not being completely met.<br />
	<br />
Walking inside, Cael said, “Just so you know, Roy is going to be jealous.” To this Cael only received a snort and a smirk from Alex. After all, who wouldn’t be jealous of the massive orc.<br />
	<br />
Walking into Roy’s room, Alex was able to get a longer look at the younger orc blood. Alex could see that Roy not only a light green complexion but his tusks only just poked out above his bottom lip. He was fit, with well defined muscles, but nothing compared to Alex. While many would have noticed the jealousy painted across Roy’s face, what Alex noticed was the hunger that appeared in Roy’s eyes upon seeing Alex. There was a reason that Alex had not put a shirt on to come and see the beat up orc blood, and still being wet from cleaning himself off was just an excuse he had given Cael. Plus, Alex had liked the way Cael had watched him as he dumped water over his body.<br />
	<br />
Roy could not take his eyes off the human turned orc. The way that the green muscles moved, his height, even the tusks that jutted from the lower jaw. All of this made Roy incredibly turned on. He was glad that there way a blanket covering his erection so that Cael could not see. <br />
	<br />
‘I might not be able to use the charm, but if I can get with that orc.’ Roy thought with a quick glance at his brother.<br />
	<br />
Neither brother knew that Alex, while somewhat clean, was still giving off a light musky scent. When he smell the arousal coming from Roy, Alex gave the orc blood a cocky grin and a quick suggestive wink.<br />
	<br />
Cael of course noticed this interaction, and as much as he didn’t like it, Cael couldn’t help but notice that he was developing a massive erection. Fortunately, Roy had not realized this, but the look that Alex gave Cael said that Alex was aware and would be happy to help Cael with his hard problem.<br />
	<br />
“Well, it was nice talking to you, Roy, but I need to go and finish up the chores. Cael care to join me in the barn?” Alex made sure to ask the question in a way that Cael knew it was not just for the chores.<br />
	<br />
“I’ve got to fix dinner. With your size and the chores your doing, I’ve had to increase the amount of meat I prepare.”<br />
	<br />
“Well, just leave it out for me like you’ve been doing for the past few days.” Alex replied. “And I expect one of you to join me tonight. Though if you both want a good time, I wouldn’t be against it.” Alex headed back outside, enjoying the increased smell of the two orc bloods.</p>
