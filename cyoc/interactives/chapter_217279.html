<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Dooley finished up his class and watched as the students left. He generally stayed a few minutes afterwards organizing his stuff, just in case one of the students needed extra help or wanted to talk to him. However, without Jack there, everyone seemed to be more interested in finding the two who made a huge distraction. It frustrated him to no end to have the coach regulate a 2.5 GPA with certain students. <br />
<br />
However, Mr. Dooley knew not to mess with the game. He&#39;d been teaching long enough to know not to mess with the coach or the school&#39;s football team. That&#39;s where all the money came from. If he wanted to maintain his classroom along with the new technology and clean desks, he had to keep the coaches happy. Not to mention the auditorium seating that he had. The large room was perfect for his lectures, and he could see all the students fairly easily.<br />
<br />
He let out a scoff as he gathered his things and headed for the door. A glint of a sparkle caught his eye. &quot;Hmm?&quot; he looked down at it. A small brown egg laid just behind one of the desks. He wondered where it had come from, then remembered Jack rushing out so quickly. The small man wasn&#39;t known for pranks, but if he was with Steven, that would be another story. Just seeing the jock&#39;s big arm wrap around the other man sent a whole new host of questions for the teacher.<br />
<br />
The teacher reached down to pick up the egg. The moment his skin touched the egg, his mind was taken oven. His hands quickly undid the belt holding up his black pants and dropped them around his ankles. He reached around his backside and shoved the egg in. With a bit of a yelp, he felt it go all the way in. His body stood straight up.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck...?&quot; Mr. Dooley cursed. &quot;Hmm?&quot; he wondered. The slightly older man wasn&#39;t exactly known for doing so. However, it felt like the only proper word that should come out. Maybe it was how he said it that was bothering him. Instead of his usual terse use of syllables there was a longer, deeper drawl to it. Even his &#39;hmm?&#39; had a bit of a growl buried in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird...&quot; Mr. Dooley stated with the same rumble of a growl in his throat. His hand scratched absentmindedly at his chest. &quot;Don&#39;t know why I did that.&quot; He took a seat in one of the chairs and leaned back. The black shoes he was wearing along with his pants were next to come off as he leaned. His feet went onto the chair in front of him; toes wiggling at their freedom. <br />
<br />
One of his hands reached down and grabbed his cock. It&#39;d been decades since it ever felt this sensitive. His balls churned. Blood pooled in his cock making the member throb. To Mr. Dooley&#39;s surprise, it felt bigger in his hand. Sure, he wasn&#39;t some chronic masturbator, but the way his hand fit around his cock just didn&#39;t feel the same. Where he thought he should have been holding a quarter roll, right now it felt closer to the size of a beer can. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fffuuuuuuuuuuuuccckkkk...&quot; he moaned out as he gave it a tug. His body started tingling. It felt unbelievably good to just lean back and relax. He barely even noticed the tug on his spine as a small nub of a tail extended out behind him. It wiggled with joy. Just feeling his thick hand wrapped around his even thicker cock filled his body with joy. His hand kept going up and down barely noticing as other changes started to take place.<br />
<br />
The nice button up dress shirt was starting to strain against a growing belly. Even if he&#39;d never been in the best of shapes, the amount of visceral fat developing on his stomach was far more than it had been. The buttons on his shirt were pulled taut. Pressure continued to build. It was far too much for them to handle. The shirt burst open exposing his large brown furred belly. <br />
<br />
Mr. Dooley&#39;s free hand went and naturally scratched it as his other hand continued to please himself. The rest of his shirt wasn&#39;t fairing much better as his frame turned into a more muscular burly one. The loose amalgamation of fat tightened up to a firmer chest. Though the amount of fat didn&#39;t seem to dissipate at all. Only a firm layer of muscle filled in underneath. <br />
<br />
Strong arms built more for a construction worker overtook his obese teacher frame. Not that Mr. Dooley cared all that much. He was too focused on wanting a cigar. Maybe some brandy or scotch. Even if he&#39;d never had either in his life, he couldn&#39;t shake the powerful tastes from his mouth. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; he growled trying to shake the feeling. &quot;Later...&quot;<br />
<br />
Right now, he had other things on his mind. His hand started to speed up as the changes slowed. Thoughts of Jack rushed back into him. He felt his body jerk. A wicked grin crossed his face as he remembered seeing the embarrassment cover it. Those bright red cheeks and wide eyes stared at him in an almost horror. Not that Mr. Dooley would ever hurt the lad, though he did need a bit of proper training if he were going to rush out of the room like that. <br />
<br />
But he could turn Jack into a proper boi. All he needed was to have some one on one time with the lad. Seeing his small body slowly strip for him and then run his fingers across Mr. Dooley&#39;s far larger body. Mr. Dooley tried to imitate it with his own hands but they were far too big. Far too many callouses covered the palms of his hands. Besides, he wanted that little rabbit to climb up onto his rotund belly. To feel the massive size difference between the two as he held him tightly.<br />
<br />
Then Jack would please him. He&#39;d be desperate to. Just seeing his body round Mr. Dooley&#39;s belly and him drop to his knees was exactly what the teacher wanted. He wanted to see those bright eyes look up to him for support as Jack would open his mouth and just barely fit his massive cock inside. <br />
<br />
Mr. Dooley&#39;s back arched with elation. Cum rocketed out of his dick and coated his brown fur, white. Several more throbs and thrusts to the air and the teacher was finally able to come back down to earth. His hand massaged the mess he&#39;d made into his fur. A deep primal growl rolled out of him as he continued to think about Jack.<br />
<br />
Though, it turned angry as a thought of Steven entered into his mind. &quot;Whatever,&quot; he reasoned. &quot;There&#39;s plenty of reasons I can see Jack without that other man around.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mr. Dooley stood up and tried to put on his shoes. They were several sizes too small. Just like his pants as he pulled them up towards his waist. He didn&#39;t seem to notice that his nose had turned black, face rounded or the fur developing around his turn. None of this bothered him as he left his classroom just as he always did. Though, this time with his eyes on the lookout for Jack.</p>
