<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary thought about what they could do next. They could go back to the mall and shop or perhaps they could go back to Mary's house and have some time alone.<br />
<br />
Eric tugging on her tail in a way that was ever so gentle pulled Mary from her thoughts.<br />
<br />
“Mary, there's something I’d like to try,” Eric said. &quot;I know it sounds crazy but it might be a lot of fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric lye down on his back with his upper torso supported by his arms and his legs spread.<br />
<br />
Mary didn't need to ask what Eric wanted.<br />
<br />
“Maybe it’s because I’m a girl now or maybe it’s because I’m an ottsel. Or maybe whatever went wrong that gave me blue fur is doing this. I just -- I want you to make love to me.”<br />
<br />
Mary’s eyes went wide. This was the last thing she expected Eric to say. Eric's eyes showed a mix of desperation and innocence. It would be hard for Mary to say no to Eric. She didn’t blame him for being curious.<br />
<br />
However, since she'd turned him into an ottsel without asking and had left him with both conflicted feelings and a vulnerability, Mary knew she shouldn't give in.<br />
<br />
“Eric, I don’t know if this is what either of us really wants,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Eric looked disappointed.<br />
<br />
“I know it’s just the hormones making want that,&quot; Eric said. &quot;But even without them, I’ve always liked you. I was just too shy to ask you out.”<br />
<br />
“Well, why didn’t you say something?” Mary asked. “Oh wait, you said you were too shy; sorry. How come you're not as shy now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric shrugged his shoulders. &quot;Maybe this is affecting my mind even if just a bit. Right now, I just feel more open, less inhibited.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary chuckled. &quot;Great, so it's made you drunk. I've heard of being drunk as a skunk but not drunk as an ottsel.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously though, I just don't feel so shy right now. It's like -- like there was an alarm in me before but now it's gone quiet. Maybe I can show you who I really am now even if it's an female ottsel version of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I like you too Eric. I just -- I don’t know if we should try something. Someone might see us and we’re both girls! Maybe I could drink a vial to become a male but is that what you really want?”<br />
<br />
“I want you to be happy. I admit that I’m curious,” Eric said. &quot;But something inside of me really wants it and I want you to be the one to give it to me. Maybe I'm being selfish, I dunno.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Oh Eric,” Mary said. “You're not being selfish. I'd love to show you that being a girl is fun and yes, in that way too. But, I can’t take advantage of you like this.”<br />
<br />
“I guess but can you at least touch me. I don’t mean in that way, just pet me or something,” Eric said.<br />
<br />
Mary nodded. “All right Eric, that seems safe enough. Lay on your belly.”<br />
<br />
Eric complied and Mary walked over to and knelt beside Eric. <br />
<br />
She started by massaging Eric’s shoulders, taking care to be delicate but at the same time, just firm enough to give Eric a good work out. Eric hummed in pleasure the entire time, leaving Mary uncertain whether or not she was doing the right thing. She could handle the temporary species change but Mary felt uncertain about touching another female in this way even if that female was Eric.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, Mary continued the massage as she moved down Eric’s back. Eric’s fur was soft and warm, his slight musky odor excited Mary a little, making the option to drink a male vial and show Eric just how she felt about him all the more appealing. <br />
<br />
Mary closed her eyes. She knew it was just the hormones talking. In her mind, it was okay for her to be attracted to a female of her new species as long as it was Eric. The question remained of what she was going to go with those feelings.<br />
<br />
If Eric’s moans of content (which, while being pleasant to listen to were just short of being perverse) were any indication of his mood, Eric was in bliss. Mary felt almost upset at ending the massage once she reached the end of Eric’s tail.<br />
<br />
Mary stood back and Eric stood up to face Mary before Eric hugged Mary.<br />
<br />
“That was incredible,” Eric said.<br />
<br />
“Thanks, I’m glad you enjoyed it,” Mary said. &quot;Can I give you one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe later,&quot; Mary said.<br />
<br />
Eric let go of Mary, looked Mary over and sighed.<br />
<br />
“Mary I – you were – I think…”<br />
<br />
Mary smiled and folded her arms. “Spit it out solider!”<br />
<br />
“I want to stay this way for a while!”<br />
<br />
“Oh really?” Mary asked.<br />
<br />
Eric blushed, but managed a smile. “Sure, why not? Maybe I can be a better guy if I spend some time as a girl.”<br />
<br />
“It's possible though it's not like you were a bad guy before. Do you still want me to become male?” Mary asked. “I’m willing to do it if you want me to.”<br />
<br />
A rustle of bushes and footfalls interrupted Eric. He and Mary both leaped off of the bench and hid under it. Two teenagers walked by and sat on the bench before a man sat beside them.<br />
<br />
“What do you think they want?” Eric whispered.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know,” Mary whispered.<br />
<br />
“The vials! What if they take them?” Eric asked.<br />
<br />
“Stay cool, we’ll find a way to get to them,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
“So, do you have the merchandise?” One of the teens asked.<br />
<br />
“Hey, what’s this box in the purse?” The other teen asked.<br />
<br />
“Maybe we can take it and get some money for it,” the first teen asked.<br />
<br />
“Are you gentlemen here for what I’m delivering or are you here for a purse?” the adult said. “Decide now, I have other deliveries to make.”<br />
<br />
The man's voice was calm and collected. He was stating a fact and was not threatening the teens in any way.<br />
<br />
“Oh brother,” Eric said. “Do they realize how they sound?”<br />
<br />
Mary put her finger on Eric’s mouth. “Shhh, they’ll hear us.”<br />
<br />
She drew closer to Eric, putting her arms around Eric and whispered to Eric’s ears. “I know they sound silly but we can’t risk them finding us.”<br />
<br />
“We have two hundred bucks, how much will that get us?” the first teen said.<br />
<br />
The man chuckled. “Enough to ensure your problems go away for a long time.”<br />
<br />
“We should do something,” Eric said.<br />
<br />
“Like what? Tell them the error of their ways? This isn’t a public service announcement Eric,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
“Hey, who’s down there?” the first teen said.<br />
<br />
“Shit,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
“Damn it, I’m sorry Mary,” Eric said.<br />
<br />
“It’s all right, just stay cool, I’ll get us out of this,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
The adult stood up. “This better not be what it looks like.”<br />
<br />
Mary ran into the open and looked up at the man. He was wearing gray pants and a gray suit as well as sunglasses. Mary tugged on the man’s slacks.<br />
<br />
“If you think I’m here to narc on you then chillax. Mayhaps we can make a deal,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
Eric ran out and stood beside Mary. “Narc? Chillax? Mayhaps?”<br />
<br />
Mary shrugged her shoulders. &quot;Just going with the flow.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Man, this stuff must be really good,” the first teen said. “I’m seeing two talking, whatever those things are and I haven’t even taken any!”<br />
<br />
“My friends, what you are seeing is not a hallucination,” the man said.<br />
<br />
“You’re not going to hurt us are you?” Eric asked. He held Mary, who put an arm around Eric.<br />
<br />
“It’s all right, just stay calm,” Mary said.<br />
<br />
“My friends, I don’t know what you are or how you’re possible but I am a business man,” the man said. “I see no reason to harm someone that’s accomplished something so miraculous.”<br />
<br />
“What the fuck is going on here?” the first teen said.<br />
<br />
“They’re talking animals, that’s what’s going on,” the second teen said.<br />
<br />
“Now my friends, care to enlighten us as to how you’ve come to exist?” the man asked.</p>
