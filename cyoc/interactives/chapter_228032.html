<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Antonio was in no mood for games, the pain throbbing in his body putting his tolerance on a short leash, the flashing blue and red lights of the multiple police vehicles, as well as ambulances and the flash of reporter cameras, all dazzling his vision as he walked straight through the entrance<br />
&quot;HEY!, sir I&#39;m going to have to ask you to step back behind the line!&quot; An officer called out to Antonio, a hand suddenly grasping his shoulder tightly and pulled him back, Antonio snapped, his cybernetic hand reaching onto his shoulder and spinning around, grasping the officers arm and twisted it the wrong way in one swift motion, hearing bones break one by one<br />
The officer cried out as Antonio let his twisted arm go, his high visibility overcoat bleaching from a bright vibrant yellow to a deep black and red, as soon as this happened Antonio gazed around at every officer, all directions every one holding a gun up towards him, Antonio looked into the crowd, seeing Mantis and Kat, hands in their pockets ready to draw their firearms<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[NO, stand down, I know what I&#39;m doing] Antonio warned, both of them narrowing their eyes at him<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Yeah I know what your doing, trying to get a bullet lodged in that thick fucking skull of yours] Mantis said, an angry expression on her face as she retracted her hand, crossing her arms over her chest<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
[Agreed, as far as I can see you&#39;ve completely flipped in the head]<br />
<br />
Antonio didn&#39;t reply, discreetly putting his hand out, signaling them to stand down as several officers crept closer to him<br />
&quot;Suspect in sight, apprehending now&quot; an officer from behind called out<br />
&quot;Come quietly sir, don&#39;t resist&quot;<br />
Antonio couldn&#39;t help but laugh, clapping his hands at their display<br />
&quot;Oh bravo boys, you really take this shit seriously, but no, I won&#39;t be going anywhere with you, I think I need to stir up a little more trouble for who I want to show their face&quot; he chuckled, slamming his foot into the ground, feeling as the cybernetic food shifted and unfolded until it had anchored him to the floor splitting into four equal parts and rotated around his heel into a perfect cross, cracking the pavement as he became rooted like a tree, his ankle unlocked from it&#39;s forward facing position, now enabling him to freely rotate 360° unimpeded, folding one hand behind his back Antonio outstretched his cybernetic arm, bekoning the officers to come at him, grinning as he heard one of the young officers rush him from behind, spinning around, relaxing the ligaments and actuators in his arm, the springs and motors in his elbow loosening, svery plate and synthetic muscle shifting to become elongated and ayrung together untill Anyonios arm reformed into a large tentacle like whip, spinning on the spot bwfore snapping his arm at the foolish officer, the tip of his cybernetic hitting him directly in the eye, removing it from his socket in a spray of blood.<br />
<br />
Antonio had no idea how he did it, nowhere in his systems did it display his arm or feet being able to do these things, it was like his cybernetics knew what he needed before he did<br />
&quot;Top of the line indeed&quot; he muttered to himself with a confident smirk, swinging his whip, cracking it either side of his body with expert precision, the other officers charging him all at once.<br />
Antonio began to spin at high speeds, his elongated arm becoming a cybernetic wall between himself and them, the cops stopped dead, dumbfounded on how to approach him, one officer reached a hand out to try and grab him, big mistake.<br />
<br />
In a flash of red, the mans hand flew away from his body, falling to the ground howling in pain as he painted the pavement red, the paramedics that were on sight swept into action, dragging the man away to treat him, the other six officers digging their heels into the sidewalk in a desperate attempt to stop their advance, most escaping just in the nick of time, but the odd few receiving massive gashes across their faces, stomach&#39;s and legs, all scurrying away whimpering before Antonio took anything else<br />
&quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Came a commanding voice<br />
Antonio grinned, retracting his arm back into its original shape, the joints and wires unifying back into place with a satisfying click<br />
&quot;Ah, finally showed your face huh?&quot; Antonio called into the silenced crowd, his eyes zeroing in on a woman dressed in a black suit, her hair a golden blonde, tied back behind her head, her hands heavily modified with Cybernetic&#39;s<br />
&quot;You know who I am?&quot; She asked<br />
&quot;No, and I don&#39;t really give a shit, but I know who you represent&quot; he fired back, grinning as her eyes narrowed at his words, he had the right person.<br />
<br />
The woman walked forward until she was a few feet away from him, looking at the ground as she walked, scanning the scrape marks in the concrete to assess the limits of his range, smart move<br />
&quot;Well you&#39;ve got my attention, so what do you want&quot; she asked, her tone impatient<br />
Antonio flexed his shoulders, groaning as his burning muscles stretched, tightening around his new implants<br />
&quot;I have a message for your boss&quot;<br />
The woman&#39;s face remained as unmoving as stone, turning her nose up at Antonio<br />
&quot;I have no idea what you mean, I&#39;m Chief of this city districts police department, I am the boss&quot; she said in a stoic voice, Antonio bursting out into laughter at her little charade<br />
<br />
[SYSTEM: Switch box]<br />
[ENGAGED]<br />
[SUBSYSTEM: Cyberlink neural network]<br />
<br />
Antonio had no idea what he was doing, it was almost like he was on autopilot, using equipment he had never used in his life, it was almost scary just how familiar he seemed with Cyberware he only just had installed, and such mastery over each component too<br />
Antonios gaze fixed on the chief of police, his eyes turning a bright solid orange, white ones and zeros flashing and scrolling through his irises as the woman was highlighted in his view.<br />

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////<br />
Antonio was lost for words, he could hack PEOPLE, this was a complete game changer, grinning as he selected his options he targeted her Bionic joints, shutting them down, and like flicking off a lightbulb, the chief fell to her knees in a heap, her arms hanging down by her sides, unable to move, Antonio walked calmly over to her, grabbing her hair and lifting her to look at him<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s try this again shall we, I have...a message...for...your....boss&quot; he said, extenuating every word as he said it, the chief looked up at him in panic, simply nodding her head, then Antonio leaned in and whispered in her ear<br />
&quot;You tell Kovastov, that if he tries doubling back on our deal, and starts snooping around our part of town, then I will slaughter every cop on his payroll&quot; he said with a dangerous growl<br />
&quot;Ok....ok il do it&quot; she said between fear driven gasps, Antonio immediately getting up, releasing his hack on her before turning his head to look at her<br />
&quot;Get your boys in blue off my streets, and get these reporters out of here&quot; he ordered, the police immediately complying as they began to usher the reporters and photographers away, shutting down the holographic tape as they left.<br />
<br />
Antonio had no idea what had gotten into him, the rush of power, the adrenaline, it felt....good, better than he felt in his whole life, having authority, having power, that&#39;s what he wanted, it&#39;s what he NEEDED<br />
&quot;What the ever loving fuck was all that?&quot; Mantis shouted as she and Kat walked over, standing In Front of him with arms crossed<br />
&quot;I needed a message sent, and someone in Kovastov&#39;s back pocket was the best way to deliver it&quot; he replied nonchalantly<br />
Kat put her hands against his chest, stopping him dead in the buildings lobby<br />
&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me when I said we made a deal with Kovastov?, or has your memory gone round the bend with the rest of your head&quot; she asked him with a raised eyebrow<br />
&quot;You honestly think a man like Kovastov will keep his word after we saw that Cybergirl?&quot; He questioned, Kat attempted to respond, only for a moment her mouth open, but no words came out<br />
&quot;You may have a good point there&quot; she muttered as she looked at the ground in thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;The man speaks true!&quot; Called a voice from behind, Antonio rushed into action spinning around on the spot before throwing his cyber arm into it&#39;s length once more, extending into a long whip, this time his fingers morphing into a sharp arrow top, Antonio Watched as his appendage flew through the air with a high pitched whistle, only for the stranger to catch the tip between their fingertips<br />
&quot;Is that any way to treat a friend?&quot; They asked, Mantis and Kat drew their weapons this time, Kat holding a small SMG, and Mantis unfurling her blades from her arms<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know you and your not my friend&quot; Antonio fired back, yanking his elongated arm from the strangers grip before returning to its intended shape<br />
&quot;Ah....but maybe you want me as a friend no?&quot; The stranger chuckled, their head down, masked by a large black metallic Kasa hat, a round glowing engraving of a flock of birds, bright and blue against the darkness of the city&#39;s night, they wore a black leather body length poncho with a heavy looking bag strapped over their sholder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then.....friend, why are you here&quot; Antonio spoke with narrow eyes, the tolerance in his voice even narrower, the stranger rose their head, revealing a black face mask over their nose and mouth, a pair of piercing eye blue eyes staring from under the hat, the eyes narrow and calculating, looking into their eyes Antonio couldn&#39;t help but see something familiar in those eyes, the look of a killer, the stranger uncovered the left side of their cloak revealing a cybernetic arm un-sleaved underneath, the shoulder and forearm layered with curved metallic plates layered on top of eachother in a scale like fashion, connected together by thick red wiring along each plates edge, the frame of their arm was a deep black, a design similar to Antonios own arm, their forarm hollow apart from a strip of red wiring around a silver internal skeleton, the outer shell a honeycomb design on the underside, with a set of solid black plates on top, their hand shaped exactly like Antonio&#39;s.<br />
<br />
He gazed at the stranger with curiosity, looking down at his own arm as he flexed the Cybernetic fingers, each synthetic muscle flexing and extending before contracting, the stranger laughed, their voice surprisingly high pitched under the mask<br />
&quot;My reasons are my own, I know what I want, and I know what you want&quot; they said as they strode inside without a worry in the world, moving like a ghost across the shattered glass on the floor<br />
&quot;And what do I want?&quot; Antonio challenged, his brow furrowing as he followed the stranger<br />
&quot;You want to be free, free to call the shots, free to roam where you please, and free from Kovastov&#39;s grasp&quot; the stranger said with a call tone, stopping right in front of Antonio, glancing at Mantis and Kat with a small confident smile<br />
&quot;And to get what you want, you want to have a drink with me, and hear what I have to say&quot;</p>
