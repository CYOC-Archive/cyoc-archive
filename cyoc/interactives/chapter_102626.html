<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BEFORE WE BEGIN... an aside to &quot;Unnamed&quot;.<br />
A trans-gendered were is extremely rare, with the only other known case (provided the subject didn&#39;t switch genders medically before becoming a were) is the Rick/Rikki situation of another Moon Lake thread. I hope Tabitha (love the name) and Lucie find happiness together,  but will have to stop and think about the rest.<br />
NOW THEN, BACK TO OUR STORY...<br />
<br />
Eric Anderson went back to the Stovall&#39;s cabana by the pool, with his bag of clothes for tonight&#39;s event, to take a shower and get ready to attend his folks induction ceremony to officially become Skulk members. While his dad was now a werefox and would become a full member, his mom would be welcomed as an honorary member, despite being a werecat.<br />
Laying out his clothes for the evening across the bed, which he happily noted was big enough for 2, Eric stripped and went into the bathroom, but stopped and stared at his reflection in the mirror. This was the first time he had seen himself since Julie Stovall and he had given each other their virginity, making Eric the newest wer-merman of Moon Lake in the process.<br />
While no noticeably taller or muscular than before, he was definitely more toned now. <i>A swimmer&#39;s body,</i> his girlfriend had said. Eric also noticed that his boyhood (manhood? were-mer-hood?) was now another inch or so longer at rest, and a tad thicker too.<br />
<i>Hey, guys notice these things,</i> he thought, while shrugging his shoulders.<br />
The most prominent change was also the most obvious. His once brown eyes were now permanently deep sea blue.<br />
Eric smiled at his reflection, thinking not only of everything that had happened so far today, but of the bright future that laid ahead for him and the lady that would one day be Mrs. Julie Anderson.<br />
With that, he hopped in the shower, not noticing that he instinctively slipped into Stage 1 mode (webbed hands and feet) for better traction in the stall, and took longer than he normally would, thinking of more physical activities he and Julie could privately engage in.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE....<br />
Mrs. Stovall wasn&#39;t sure what took the longest, picking out a dress for her daughter to wear to the Skulk ceremony tonight or her shower, but was happy that Julie was now sitting in front of her vanity mirror while the two of them styled her hair for the evening.<br />
&quot;Mom, have you ever played Marco Polo?&quot; asked Julie, pausing to look at Mrs. Stovall&#39;s reflection in the mirror.<br />
Except for when the shower was actually running, Julie had spent the whole time talking about her and Eric, their <b>wonderful</b> day together, and the future.<br />
&quot;Err... yes I have,&quot; admitted her mom.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s even more fun underwater,&quot; said Julie with a smile, as they selected a hair ribbon to tie back her blonde hair that matched the dress she was now wearing.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t ever repeat this to anyone, but your father would agree with that,&quot; Melissa Stovall said with a grin, which caused both ladies to giggle. Then her mother turned serious for a moment and said, &quot;I&#39;m so happy that you didn&#39;t have to wait ten years like I did to find true love and your soul mate. Eric is perfect for you,&quot; before hugging her daughter.<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; agreed Julie. &quot;In or out of the water, he&#39;s a great catch. Smart, a gentleman, a good listener, and a wonderful lover,&quot; she added, which made her mother blush a bit. &quot;You okay? You said you always wanted open communication between us.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know. You&#39;re just growing up so fast,&quot; said Melissa, while wiping a tear from her eye.<br />
&quot;We&#39;re still going to have to tell dad when he gets back from grandma&#39;s,&quot; realized her daughter.<br />
&quot;Yes. Especially about this,&quot; agreed her mother, fingering the single pearl necklace Julie had on, the weremer&#39;s idea of an engagement ring; despite the fact that Eric was originally supposed to give it to his girlfriend as simply a &#39;promise ring&#39;. &quot;But we&#39;ll do that when he comes back. Meanwhile, you look adorable,&quot; commented her mother, taking another look at Julie. The dress had turned out to be a bit snug though, for what were barely B cup breasts this morning were now definitely beginner &#39;C&#39;s.<br />
&quot;I feel so... radiant and alive too,&quot; replied Julie. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll still be on these for years to come,&quot; she added, pointing to the bottle of weremermaid birth control pills sitting on top of her dresser.<br />
&quot;Good. But let&#39;s go see what Eric thinks of you right now,&quot; suggested Mrs. Stovall, noting that it was well after 6.<br />
<br />
Eric had dressed in slacks, a nice button down shirt with a matching clip on tie, and even had a formal jacket on. He wore his better pair of dress shoes, and sat patiently on the couch in the Stovall family living room.<br />
When he first heard footsteps approaching the staircase, he stood and turned, seeing Mrs. Stovall starting to descend. Other than freshening up, she was still wearing basically the same outfit she had on all day.<br />
A minute later Julie appeared.<br />
To say that Eric was speechless at the beauty coming down the stairs was a serious understatement!<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
Despite Moon Lake being a relatively small town of just barely over 6,000 people in residence, it was after 5:30 when Alex Ramsey pulled his car into the Anderson family driveway to let out his boyfriend Nate and Nate&#39;s father William.<br />
&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll be back by 6:30, but after the ceremony, are we still on for the rest of the weekend?&quot; wondered Alex.<br />
Nate looked at his father, who simply nodded his head in agreement.<br />
&quot;Good, because I do have romantic plans for the two of us I hope you&#39;ll enjoy. I&#39;ll just park at the curb when I return.&quot;<br />
With a quick kiss between the lovers, Alex said goodbye before backing out of the driveway and heading for his house.<br />
&quot;You two are starting to get quite serious, aren&#39;t you?&quot; observed his father, as William and Nate approached the front door.<br />
&quot;As serious as you and mom and Julie and Eric,&quot; admitted Nate. &quot;Do you think he&#39;s really—&quot;<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; was William&#39;s only reply as they entered the house.<br />
Both men went upstairs, but while Nate could go directly from his bedroom to the shower in the hall bathroom, William was distracted by the sleeping form of a beautiful werecat on his bed.<br />
After completely undressing, he laid down nude next to his wife. The feeling of her fur against his bare skin was a wonderful sensation, and it was all he could do to keep from releasing his inner werefox and finding alternate ways of awakening his mate.<br />
Instead, William Anderson reluctantly settled for wrapping his human arms around his wife Martha&#39;s furry body and kissing his <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> awake.<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; purred the werecat, before wrapping her arms around him and returning the kiss. &quot;What time is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;5:50,&quot; replied William, before (VERY reluctantly) getting out of bed and laying out a suit for tonight.<br />
&quot;Good thing I took a shower when I got home before my nap,&quot; realized Martha, resuming her human form.<br />
<br />
Before and after his shower, they traded news about how their respective days went.<br />
&quot;So Nate&#39;s considering becoming a writing teacher?&quot; wondered Martha.<br />
&quot;No. A teacher who writes in his spare time,&quot; clarified her husband, coming out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist. &quot;And you turned out to be pretty hot stuff on the Teachers circuit, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;So it appears,&quot; admitted Martha, actually blushing at the prospect.<br />
It was a bit of a strain to concentrate on getting dressed for both of them as Martha related all the &quot;prospects&quot; she had over the day.<br />
&quot;Do you think you&#39;ll ever...&quot; asked William, as he managed to secure his pants, despite the growing bulge within them.<br />
&quot;Except for the normal, maybe,&quot; confessed Martha with a smile, as she sauntered up to her husband. &quot;By the way, depending upon how things go, how would you feel about ever being part of a threesome or quartet?&quot; she asked, looking directly at him for a response.<br />
The passionate kiss William Anderson quickly gave his wife was all the answer Martha needed.</p>
