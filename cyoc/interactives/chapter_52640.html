<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Thanks to... me?!&quot; Mark twitched his whiskers. &quot;If it wasn't for you raising the boy into a sissy, I wouldn't have had to be so hard on him! He needed to be a man!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up!&quot; June screamed. &quot;Look at you! You aren't even a man anymore, so don't presume to know what one is!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark raised his hand to slap June and then realized his error too late, as his oft abused wife slammed a solid fist into his muzzle with terrible force, smashing his face hard enough to send him howling in pain to the grass.<br />
<br />
Waving her aching hand, June smiled in satisfaction. &quot;I like being the big one for once. Don't you ever raise a hand to me again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark could only sit knocked on his ass cowering. His whole world and all his power had just crumbled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Also...&quot; June kneeled down to Mark's ear, &quot;You haven't made me cum for 15 years.&quot; She spat in his face. &quot;Selfish rat bastard!&quot;<br />
<br />
As little as she was, as weird as all of it was, June smiled proudly and stood confidently over her crushed husband/rat like she was 50 feet tall, ignoring everything else but his fearful gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well.&quot; Ty blinked twice, his gaze turning from the small scale domestic violence to Wendy's bewildered stare. &quot;Looks like they've got a long way to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So!&quot; Wendy shuffled awkwardly. &quot;Dustin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah yes! My pachyderm step brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
In unison, both Wendy and Ty turned to the elephant, who had tried to sneak off unnoticed rather unsuccessfully.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Ty hollered. &quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin hung his head sadly and turned around, waiting for his inevitable turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get back here!&quot; Ty barked.<br />
<br />
With thundering steps, the elephant comically obeyed, standing in front of Ty with nervous fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;And lastly, you. You *liked* all the times you bullied me. It makes you feel big to hurt something small, doesn't it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin blinked his eyes, trying to comprehend, and then raised an eye in confusion, looking down at Ty. He had just watched his mom and dad - both the terror inspiring villains of the household - reduced to tiny helpless things. He was currently a giant elephant. He suddenly grasped the subtle irony of Ty's statement. Regardless, Dustin didn't want to be shrunk, he kind of liked being a big animal. No, he couldn't talk, but he could easily get work at the circus. I mean, who wouldn't want to hire an elephant with human intelligence? He'd be famous!<br />
<br />
Ty glared at him. &quot;Dustin... are you even paying attention?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin snapped out of his daydream and nodded quickly, puzzled by the strange and reasonably attractive young girl Ty was suddenly hanging out with. She was hot...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, are you sorry?&quot; Ty tapped his foot impatiently. &quot;Do you understand how much it sucks being picked on?&quot;<br />
<br />
The elephant nodded slowly. Yeah... it did suck to be picked on. Poor Ty, Dustin realized, he wasn't *really* that bad. Heh! Mark was a rat. His dad was now a rat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you *really* sorry?&quot; Wendy added, crossing her arms and trying not to laugh.<br />
<br />
The elephant nodded again, and sincerely hung his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Dustin.&quot; Ty nodded. &quot;I know you're too dumb to make anything up, so I know you mean it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin nodded again. Yeah, he wasn't too bright. Hey! How big was his dick now, anyway? He had a moment of sudden curiosity. Flexible trunk... hmmm. Maybe he could convince Ty to leave him this way for about fifteen minutes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Awww.&quot; Wendy smiled, and hugged Ty. &quot;I'm glad you two made up. So whatcha gonna do with him now, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dustin stamped his front foot firmly and nodded. Yeah! Whatcha gonna do with me now?<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I owe you for sort of accidentally making you an elephant, huh?&quot; Ty smiled. &quot;Okay. I'll change you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
The elephant Dustin suddenly reeled and his head swam. He was hit by that weird tingly achy yawny stomach turny sensation. He took a deep breath, and felt his back begin to twitch. The next thing he knew, he was standing on two legs again, and much much taller than before. He blinked in shock, looking *way* down at Ty and Wendy, and realized he was sort of a man/elephant combo. Two legged, five fingered, but still mostly an elephant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...&quot; Dustin gaped. &quot;Ty, this is weird.&quot; He waved his trunk under his ivory tusks, realizing he must be like eighteen feet tall. Now he was a giant animal person. Suddenly being an elephant in general seemed really comforting and normal.<br />
<br />
Wendy put her hands to her mouth and laughed. &quot;Oh, that's freaking adorable! He's like Babar or something! I love Babar!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty turned and said something to Wendy, and she laughed and nodded.<br />
<br />
Dustin gulped and felt the lurching tingling aching feeling that accompanied a rapid and rather unexpected shrinking. In no time, he was only ten feet tall. Still big and an elephant guy thing, but not quite so massive. He breathed a sigh of relief and held his swimming dizzy head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... I feel like I'm gonna puke.&quot; Dustin swayed slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;There!&quot; Wendy leapt forward, and threw herself around Dustin's meaty elephant leg. &quot;Now he's just right! Can we keep him, Ty? Can we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, listen!&quot; Dustin looked down at Wendy in utter confusion. &quot;It's weird enough being an elephant person thing, but who the heck is *she* anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
Somewhere, Mark and June's marital spat was heating up, and many cursing rat/doll woman insults were flying back and forth below the trio.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Wendy!&quot; Ty smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Wendy!&quot; She nodded, and curtsied slightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Dustin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you're Dustin!&quot; Wendy looked up at him like a girl who had just won a free pony. &quot;And you're an elephant! I think you're handsome!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, hey...&quot; Dustin smiled. &quot;Thanks! I guess this *is* kind of cool, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Ty agreed, and took Wendy by the hand as they skipped merrily into the afternoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey!&quot; Dustin yelled after them. &quot;So that's it?! You're just gonna leave us like this?! Ty! Wait!&quot;</p>
