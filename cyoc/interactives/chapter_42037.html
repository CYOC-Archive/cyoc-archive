<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as Simon was about to explain everything to Jay and Bryan, the doorbell rang. Someone was standing at the front door!<br />
<br />
“Aww man, who can that be?” Simon groaned.<br />
<br />
When the doorbell rang a second time, Simon stammered over to the door, and opened up. Before him, there was Milton, the annoying, chubby kid from next door. Milton was about fourteen years old, 5 foot 4 inches tall, and about 200 pounds! He was fat, he had acne all over his face, and he had short, black hair. His parents were both Italian, so he had the same Italian look. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Simon! What’s up, dude?” he said.<br />
<br />
“Nothing! What do you want?” Simon replied annoyingly.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man, is Adam home? He was supposed to return one of my video games…” he explained, when he noticed Bryan, Jay, and the Chronivac standing in the living room. “Ooh, cool! What’s that? A new game or something?”<br />
<br />
Milton just marched past Simon and walked right up to the Chronivac!<br />
<br />
“Hey! Who invited you in?” Simon grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Hey, guys! I didn’t know you guys were hanging out here at Simon’s place! What’s up? Playing games?” Milton said to Bryan and jay.<br />
<br />
“Uhh… We know Milton from school…” Bryan explained.<br />
<br />
“Oh, great!” Simon sighed.<br />
<br />
“Soooo…” Milton grinned, as he walked over to the Chronivac. “What’s this thing? A new game?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a machine that changes people!” Bryan explained.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, right!” Milton chuckled sarcastically.<br />
<br />
“No, seriously! Just look at Jay! Doesn’t he look taller?” Bryan pointed out.<br />
<br />
Jay got up from the couch and walked over to Milton.<br />
<br />
“Dang! Jay? Is that you? You had a growth spurt, man!” Milton gasped.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we can change you, too!” Simon pointed out. “Would you like to be different from how you are now?”<br />
<br />
“Well, duh! Look at me! I’m short, I’m fat, I got acne, and black hair! I’m not exactly Mister Handsome!” Milton complained. “Girls aren’t exactly interested in guys who like me! Plus I got a stupid name like ‘Milton’…”<br />
<br />
“Well, tell me: What would you like to be?” Simon asked him, as he grabbed the laptop and clicked the mouse. He started typing some things on the keyboard as he listened to Milton’s instructions.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I guess I’d love to be like one of those surfer-dudes who are always hanging out on the beaches, you know? They’re tall and blond and muscular… The girls love them! They’re hairy all over… They’re dumb, and they got muscles… And they would have a cool name like… Kian!” he replied.<br />
<br />
“Alright… Give me a sec, Milton… Simon said, as he was entering all the necessary information in his laptop, which was connected via the USB cable to the Chronivac device.<br />
<br />
“But… What’s going to happen? What is this thing gonna do?” Milton wondered.<br />
<br />
“We’re gonna make your dreams come true!” Simon grinned. “Now, just stand over there, facing the Chronivac emitter, will you?”<br />
<br />
“Right here?” Milton said, as he walked over to the spot, right in front of the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
“Yeah… Now, don’t move. Just hold still and relax, Milton… This will only take a minute!”<br />
<br />
With a click of the mouse, Simon executed the command which activated the Chronivac device. The device made a scan of Milton’s body, reading his stats and parsing all the physical information about him before storing it into the device’s memory. Then, it received the instructions from Simon’s laptop, which included all the changes, which needed to be made to Milton’s existing physical traits.<br />
<br />
“SCANNING ORIGINAL TARGET” the software displayed on the screen.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds, a progress bar counted from zero to 100 percent. Once it reached 100, the text on the screen changed.<br />
<br />
“STORING ORIGINAL TARGET ATTRIBUTES”<br />
<br />
Next, the Chronivac began reading the instructions from Simon’s laptop.<br />
<br />
“RECEIVING TRANSFORMATION SCRIPT”<br />
<br />
A few seconds later, the Chronivac started emitting a blue ray, which engulfed Milton’s entire body from head to toe.<br />
<br />
“EXECUTING TRANSFORMATION SCRIPT”<br />
<br />
Immediately, Milton was overcome by a powerful tingling feeling, which had spread through his entire body. Then, he realized he could no longer move! He had become completely stiff! At the same time, everything around him appeared to be shrinking! No wonder: He was slowly growing taller! Very gradually, Milton started growing taller and taller, with each passing second. His legs grew longer, as well as his arms, His toes pushed out more, as well as his fingers. His neck stretched out, while his torso pushed upward. <br />
<br />
“Uuhhhhhh!” he moaned, as he felt his body stretch from 5 foot 4” to 5 foot 9”… After a few moments he was 6 foot 3” and still growing! His hands were becoming larger while his feet were pushing sideways, bursting out of his sandals. His shirt was getting too small, and his pants were revealing his ankles now. Obviously, he had outgrown his clothes in a matter of just a few seconds. Finally, he was standing 6 foot 7” tall, when the growth stopped.<br />
<br />
“Oh, man! I’m tall!” he gasped, as he looked around.<br />
<br />
Next, Milton started to lose his fat! His flab started to melt away from his body. His huge belly deflated like a balloon, which had all its air let out of it! His flabby balls of fat, on his waist, and under his arms, instantly disappeared! His legs shrunk down, until only muscle was left. Within seconds, the boy who had been obese all his life was now skinny! He had practically lost over thirty pounds in a matter of seconds!<br />
<br />
“Ooh man! I’m lighter! I’m skinny!” he noted, as he saw his big belly disappear.<br />
<br />
Next, his muscles started to increase in size, which allowed him to gain some weight back again. His biceps inflated, making his arms thicker and heavier. His pectorals pushed outward and forward, making his shoulders wider. His lats formed, giving him his wings. And, several rows of abdominals came to the surface of his torso.<br />
<br />
“Ooohh!” he groaned, as he felt his muscles increase all over his body. “Dang… I’m… getting… stronger!”<br />
<br />
His quads filled out and doubled in width while his calves grew to the size of softballs! By now, he started to look like a junior bodybuilder!<br />
<br />
Finally, his black hair started to fade in color and turn blond, on his face, on top of his head, and all over his body. Thin patches of hair sprouted on his chest, in his armpits, and over his arms as well. And, a nice coat of hair spread all over his legs, from his knees all the way to his ankles. He had become hairy all over!<br />
<br />
Last but not least, Milton started to forget that he was ever ‘Milton’, a fat, overweight geek in school, and he now become Kian, a tall, blond, muscular surfer boy, who loved going to the beach. Reality had changed, so everybody had always known him as Kian. Every memory and existence of Milton had been overwritten by the presence of Kian, and that’s how he would be known from this point forward.<br />
<br />
After about three minutes had passed, a message had displayed on the laptop screen.<br />
<br />
“TRANSFORMATION SCRIPT EXECUTED SUCCESFULLY”<br />
<br />
Simon, Bryan and Jay then turned to look at the tall, blond, hairy and muscular dude who was standing before them.<br />
<br />
“Yo, dudes! Nice machine, man! Hey, you guys going surfing this weekend?” Kian asked them.<br />
<br />
“No… Not this weekend, Kian…” Simon replied.<br />
<br />
“Alright… Simon, tell Adam I breezed on by… I came lookin’ for my game… Tell him to buzz me, okay?” Kian said, as he swaggered towards the door.<br />
<br />
“I will! See ya!”<br />
<br />
“Ciao, dudes!”<br />
<br />
Simon, Bryan and Jay wondered what would happen next…</p>
