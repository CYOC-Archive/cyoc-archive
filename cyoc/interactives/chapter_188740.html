<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lilith sighed heavily dimly staring at the angry parents that now occupied her throne room.<br />
<br />
&quot;This park is an abomination!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re corrupting our children!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You should be ashamed of yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith simply rolled her eyes, the demon queen had heard much worse in her eons of life. Whore, witch, demon, corrupter of souls, she did miss the old names thrown upon her. This, this was simply a nuisance.<br />
<br />
Since the death of the two anthro teens parents and other meddlers had descended on the park. While she could understand their anger, she could easily see it was misguided. Lilith and Circe had not attacked those teens, the One Humanity had. Now though these parents feared that Liliths park was endangering their children. If those two hadn&#39;t been anthros this wouldn&#39;t have happened, that was their logic. For Lilith though it sounded exactly like a witch trial. If you couldn&#39;t find the actual culprit blame someone else.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our park has only supported the anthro population,&quot; Lilith sighed. &quot;We are as concerned as you are.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you hadn&#39;t built this cesspool those kids wouldn&#39;t be dead now,&quot; a man in his 40s yelled. &quot;People are dead and its because you corrupted them! Made them a target, indoctrinating them into this,, this,, LIFESTYLE! You have no right!&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith simply sighed in annoyance as the 20 or 30 parents began to chant. She truely missed the old days. Back when angry mobs simply showed up with pitchforks and torches. Now mobs showed up with homemade signs, cellphone cameras, and chants they thought to be oh so clever. &quot;Circe owes me for having to deal with these idiots,&quot; she thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh enough of this,&quot; Lilith whispered as the mob began to chant once more. Reaching over with her one good arm, the demon queen now produced the Hourglass. Mumbling a spell she now watched as the sands began to flow backwards.<br />
<br />
Lilith smirked as she gazed out at the adult mob in front of her. Already she could see the hourglass working its magic. Grey hair slowly vanishing,  hairline returning, stomachs flattening as the group of angry suburbanites began to race backwards in age. Lilith gaze now focused an a man and woman at the head of the mob. <br />
<br />
These two appeared to be thw ringleader. The man was an out of shape 40 something with receding brown hair and a potbelly. His wife was a pudgy blond woman who had probably been quite attractive in her youth. Now her hair was faded with a touch of grey, her face showing fine lines around her eyes and mouth, while her breasts sagged ever so slightly.  Now though their bodies were youthening.<br />
<br />
The man&#39;s hair was inching forward, his belly shrinking, causing him to continually hike his pants up. Lilith noted the man&#39;s beard now appearing thinner, the grey vanishing once more. The womans changes were just as remarkable. Her hair shining, her breasts firming, her face appearing smooth and beautiful. Now they appeared to be leading a group of college students at a protest.<br />
<br />
Still they grew younger, Lilith watched as the mob became teenagers. Their voices were more youthful, higher in pitch. All appeared to be hiking their pants up as they slimmed. A grin began to form across Lilitha face as she gazed at the men. None of them were balding now, their hair now healthy and thick. Slowly but surely their facial hair began to thin, leaving their faces round and innocent. <br />
<br />
The women&#39;s changes were just as interesting. Their faces became innocent, their womanly curves evaporating leaving them waifish. Their once proud breasts sloqly eroding into teenage proportions. Now the mob looked like high school freshmen, sounding like petulant children.<br />
<br />
Still the changes persisted.<br />
<br />
Now the mob began growing smaller, puberty reversing itself quickly. Facial hair vanished, breasts melted away, height diminished. The blonde woman was now an adorable girl of 12. The child&#39;s voice rising in pitch as she shrank in front of Lilith, the girls voice becoming almost whiny as she continued to berate the demon queen about corrupting children.<br />
<br />
&quot;How ironic,&quot; Lilith thought with a smirk as the last of the girls adult attributes melted away. The elementary students before her now clung to their clothing, still completely unaware they had been reduced to grade schoolers. The two leaders were now barely 9 years old, the children seeming to melt into their adult clothing.<br />
<br />
Now the regression began to slow, the children slipping just a little further back becoming 6 year old children. Lilith listened to the mob, their voices now sounding like children whining. As the spell completed the group paused, their eyes glazing over before they began to blink in confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;My apologies children,&quot; Lilith smiled. &quot;The merry go round has been repaired. As an apology each of you shall receive a free ice cream.&quot;<br />
<br />
An excited yell now rang through Liliths throne room as the mob of children jumped for joy. Turning the mob now bolted from the throne room, leaving their oversized pants and shoes behind. &quot;Thank you Miss Lilith,&quot; the now 6 year old blond lisped. &quot;Sorry I got mad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is quite alright child,&quot; Lilith grinned. &quot;Now run along.&quot; The girl giggled, grabbing her grown down husbands hand as they bolted for the park.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that really necessary?&quot;<br />
<br />
Lilith turned, shrugging her shoulders as Circe now emerged from the shadows. &quot;Actually I believe I took it easy on them,&quot; Lilith stated. &quot;Not too long ago I would have condemned these fools to a pit of fire. Reducing them to children in body and mind is much tamer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And extinguishes their outrage,&quot; Circe added. &quot;When they leave the park and grow up they will have nothing but happy memories here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can still torture them if you wish,&quot; Lilith  replied, a malicious grin forming.<br />
<br />
&quot;No no torture,&quot; Circe replied quickly. &quot;But this is only a bandaid to our problem. This, One Humanity is hunting my followers. How long before they decide to move against us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have more than enough magic to defend ourselves,&quot; Lilith stated before gazing at her mangled arm. &quot;Yes my power may have been diminished but their are still few that can challenge me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do hope you&#39;re Lilith,&quot; Circe replied. &quot;I fear whoever this One Humanity is. They may cause more problems than we may anticipate.&quot;</p>
