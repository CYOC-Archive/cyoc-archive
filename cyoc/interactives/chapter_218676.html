<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rachel was about to say yes, she really wanted to see this City of Dis but as she stood up to say goodbye to Charon and Remeila off when a wave of exhaustion hit her new demon body. <br />
<br />
“Maisy, what time would it be back at our apartment?” inquired Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Just a hair before midnight I guess.” stated Maisy as she looked up at the sky, Rachel had yet to see something like the sun in hell but there seemed to be something a kin to daylight but it just seemed to appear from one certain location but there was no visible ball of fire in the sky. “Here, it is closer to 7 at night.”<br />
<br />
“I recommend you hold off on seeing the City of Dis tonight.” advised Lilith “I remember when I transformed all those thousands of years ago and it takes a lot out of you.”<br />
<br />
“And we do have a big day tomorrow.” advised Remeila as she looked at Maisy and Rachel “Meet at your place on Earth, say 9 am?”<br />
<br />
“Make it ten.” said Maisy as Remeila nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“We are going back to our apartment?” inquired Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Just to collect our important stuff, demons don’t understand what a human would find important and what can be burned in the fire which will fake our deaths.” explained Maisy. <br />
<br />
“And Charon and I will be there to make sure you…both of you don’t do anything stupid.” stated Remeila “We don’t need a repeat of Salem.”<br />
<br />
“What happened in Salem?” inquired Rachel before looking at Maisy “Let me guess someone wasn’t watching and saw a demon and caused the Salem Witch trails?”<br />
<br />
All eyes however turned toward the pure-blooded angel at the table.<br />
<br />
“Close, it was one of my brothers who was upset that a women choose a minor duke of Hell sons over him and appeared outside their house calling them out as demons to the entire town.” stated Remeila with embarrassment in her voice. “Caused a whole lot of mess, the humans saw them teleported back to Hell and went on a hunt going after their friends and family who had no idea what was going on. God really laid into my brother for doing that and even sent multiple angels down to tell the humans to knock it off.”<br />
<br />
“But they thought they where demons trying to fool them, and you get the idea.” stated Charon “So now we are rulers of Purgatory go to make sure everything goes smoothly with the move to either heaven or hell.”<br />
<br />
“Ok, that makes sense.” stated Rachel before something else hit her. “Wait…one of your brothers what about the whole….”<br />
<br />
“Only son of God stuff.” stated Remeila as she rolled her eyes. “He was the only son of God at the time, the bible cut out all the time he mentioned these sisters and the like. Men where just as sexist possible more then as some are now.”<br />
<br />
“I understand.” confirmed Rachel even if that wasn’t totally true.<br />
<br />
Having departed from Lucifer and Lilith, Maisy led Rachel toward her set of chambers. <br />
<br />
It was a series of rooms all of whom was larger than the entire apartment that she had shared with Maisy. Everything was finally furnished with red wood panels of a type of wood Rachel had never seen before and a mixture of black marble stone and fine rugs covered the floor. The furniture was heavier than one would expect in a human room, that was because of the larger and therefore heavier nature of demons. <br />
<br />
They should have gone to bed, right then and there, but instead having dressed in their normal sleeping clothes. Dressed only in a thin silk night groan made by the fashion designer to fit her new body Rachel sat on Maisy’s lap, Maisy who was wearing only a bra and a pair of shorts.<br />
<br />
“So, are you liking Hell so far?” inquired Maisy as the two of them kept looking at each other’s new bodies but mostly in each other’s eyes.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I still have a “hell” of a lot of questions, but I will have time to get my questions answered.” Laughed Rachel stressing the word hell in a playful voice.<br />
<br />
“Well, you did call this a “Hell” mark movie.” Laughed Maisy as they came together in a tender kiss as the “sun” began to sink on the horizon on the 9th circle of hell. <br />
<br />
It was then that both Maisy and Rachel found out something very interesting about Rachel’s new body. As the room darkened, the neon blue scales which graced Rachel’s body began to give off on ominous blue glow. Even her teeth, hair, wings, and eyes gave off that blue glow which would have been horrifying to see in the dark as a human coming at you but for Maisy it was a massive turn on.<br />
<br />
The “sun” was still down in hell when there was a knock at the door.<br />
<br />
“Princess Mariana and Lady Tenebra it is time to get up.” Said the voice of a servant from the other side of the door as Maisy and Rachel both lifted their heads off their pillows from the massive bed in Maisy’s bedchamber. <br />
<br />
Their cat Shadow, which had revealed himself as a Hell cat instead of the normal black and white house cat also lifted his head up, he had grown from the size of a normal house cat to about the size of a lion cub and was now living black and white hell fire.<br />
<br />
“Do we have to?” complained Maisy in a very tired voice.<br />
<br />
“I think so.” Confirmed Rachel as she gave Maisy a kiss on the back of her neck earning a moan from her before giving a quick kiss on her cheek before getting out of bed. That was something she did all the time back in their apartment and she did it now even in Hell.<br />
<br />
Within the hour Maisy and Rachel were back in their old apartment having traveled back through a portal just like they had journeyed to hell to.<br />
<br />
Rachel looked around, everything just seemed slightly off now, it wasn’t a bad feeling but it just didn’t feel natural. She looked down to see she was back in her human body which now seamed just wrong to her.<br />
<br />
“Just a little trick with magic, don’t want someone looking through the window and seeing three demons and an angle going through an apartment.” Laughed Remeila as she and Charon stood in their human forms with Maisy’s and Rachel’s apartment. <br />
<br />
“Take as much time as you need, remember anything left behind will be burned as part of the cover up.” Stated Charon looking more at Maisy than at Rachel, his voice screamed older brother as Maisy rolled her eyes like a little sister would.<br />
<br />
“I know, we start in the bedroom and work our way to the living room.” Proclaimed Rachel “But First.”<br />
<br />
She grabbed her Cell phone and took a photo with Maisy before quickly tapping out a short message before hitting post. <br />
<br />
“What did you do?” inquired Charon with concern in his voice.<br />
<br />
“I posted that we got engaged last night and that we plan to go ring shopping in a couple of days. That my father says I am going to hell because of who I love and I would rather be in Hell with her then anywhere else” stated Rachel as Remeila chuckled and gave off an approving smile. <br />
<br />
“Nice.” confirmed Remeila<br />
<br />
“I want to poke my dad in the eye as I head out the door. I know he preaches about God but…” started Rachel as Remeila waved it off. <br />
<br />
“Believe me, my dad hates preachers like that.” stated Remeila “It is more about enforcing their own belief then actually being kind to your fellow men which is far more important.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s get started.” Stated Maisy as Rachel’s phone began to blow up with multiple texts, messages, and calls. The calls were all from her parents, but Rachel let them go to voice mail.<br />
<br />
The process of “packing up” was weird, it wasn’t as if they could take everything, in the fire the humans would notice that all the valuable and personal items were gone. They had a kind of magical bag and whatever they put in it a fake copy would appear in the spot where it had been before. The fake was slightly off color but once burnt no one would notice a difference.<br />
<br />
Rachel had stopped at her jewelry box and was holding a very special piece of jewelry in her hand. It was a simple golden chain with a red four-pointed star in what looked to be a beautiful glass. Rachel turned the chain over looking at it carefully as she considered.<br />
<br />
“Something wrong?” inquired Maisy knowing something was wrong with her soon to be wife.<br />
<br />
Before she could answer, a flaming portal opened up in their bedroom as a beautiful women with rich dark red hair and a killer body dressed in a very tight red blouse and black leather mini skirt walked through. She had multiple golden rings around her wrists and multiple rings on her fingers aside from her ring fingers.<br />
<br />
“Aunt Astaroth what are you doing here?” inquired Maisy as Astaroth, sister of Lucifer himself stood for a moment looking at Rachel in her human form.<br />
<br />
“You look so much like your mother.” stated Astaroth looking right at Rachel.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Lady Astaroth or should I call you Ashely?” inquired Rachel as Astaroth smiled. <br />
<br />
“So you remember me?” inquired Astaroth with a sad smile. <br />
<br />
“I do.” confirmed Rachel “Mom always seamed so happy when you were around.”<br />
<br />
“We had some good times before she realizes she couldn’t be with a demon or a woman, not sure which one she cared about most.” admitted Astaroth<br />
<br />
“I don’t know, she didn’t approve of me coming out but that could have been my father speaking through her.” Stated Rachel “I don’t remember her smiling as much as whenever you are around. I think she stopped singing after the last time you visited us.”<br />
<br />
“He beat the happiness out of her I think.” Stated Astaroth “Broke her and made her his puppet.”<br />
<br />
“I think so to.” Confirmed Rachel “She never seamed happy as a housewife even raising us, but…”<br />
<br />
“It is what a woman does.” finished Astaroth with so much sadness in her voice, as Rachel nodded “That is what she told me, when she broke up with me. A woman has to raise kids and be a loving wife, that is what a woman does.”<br />
<br />
That is when Astaroth’s eyes widened as she noticed the necklace in Rachel’s hand. <br />
<br />
“She kept it?” inquired Astaroth as she moved closer and took the necklace in her hands, tears flowing from her eyes. “I gave Rebecca this necklace on our second anniversary, I told her about my demon hood that night and she rejected me shortly afterwards. I can’t believe she kept it.”<br />
<br />
“She told me a strong women gave her this necklace and to look after it for her. My father tried to make her get rid of it multiple times.” stated Rachel, as Maisy stood back with a smile as she watched the bonding moment between Rachel and her Aunt. “I was debating if I should take it with me or leave it for her or maybe I should give it back to you?”<br />
<br />
Before anything more could be said, there was a knock at the front door of their apartment.<br />
<br />
“I’ll get it.” announced Charon from outside as the door opened.</p>
