<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Maddie Haskins smiled as she heard the doorbell. Jason Turner had received several tickets to a concert from a grateful customer. As a treat he was willing to take the kids their for the Friday night group date. <br />
<br />
Maddie couldn&#39;t be happier to hear this news. She usually took the kids out and was only to happy to pass off the responsibility. While she usually didn&#39;t mind she would gladly take it. As she opened the door, Gloria and her friends rushed in as Jason stood on her doorstep. &quot;Hey Jason,&quot; she said. &quot;Thanks again for taking the kids tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont mention it Maddie,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Me and Lisa have been so appreciative of you taking the kids the last couple if weeks, this was the least I could do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Maddie turned, watching as her sons raced downstairs to join the dates. &quot;Okay boys behave yourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will mom,&quot; Adam and Nate responded. As the group now excitedly ran out of the house Gloria accidentally bumped into Mrs. Haskins. &quot;Oh god sorry Mrs. Haskins,&quot; Gloria apologized, blushing crimson. &quot;Its okay Gloria,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;Know your just excited. You guys have fun.&quot; As Maddie now waved goodbye to the excited teens she failed to notice the small ring laying in her foyer.<br />
<br />
Maddie quickly changed into a pair of sweatpants and tshirt as she now began to get comfortable. The divorced 43 year old rarely had any downtime so the fact that she wasn&#39;t the one escorting the kids on their group date was a welcome relief. Maddie was looking forward to a night of relaxing on her couch and watching old movies. As she now padded downstairs, she paused as she noticed Gloria&#39;s ring. &quot;Oh geez,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Must have fallen off the poor girl in her rush to get out.&quot; Grabbing the ring, Maddie tucked it into her pocket as she now relaxed on the couch with some chocolate and a glass of wine.<br />
<br />
As the single mom now settled in, she began looking for a movie to watch. Maddie had always been a big fan of 8ps movies and was looking forward to binge watching a few since the boys wouldnt be home til after midnight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sixteen Candles,&quot; she squealed. &quot;Oh my god I havent seen that in years.&quot; Turning the movie on Maddie settled under her blanket she she fondly remembered seeing the movie for the first time. <br />
<br />
Maddie had actually seen it in theaters when she was 8. Maddies babysitter at the time had said she would take Maddie to a kids movie but quickly decided against that and taken the excited 8 year old to see that instead. Swearing the girl to silence, Maddie happily complied as she watched Molly Ringwald on screen. &quot;Those were the days,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Sometimes wish they didn&#39;t end.&quot; Unfortunately for Maddie the ring could hear Maddies musings and now glowed as it began to send her back to a simpler time.<br />
<br />
Maddies transformation back to childhood was slow going. As the minutes ticked by Maddie was unaware of the changes taking place. As she crept slowly back into her 30s the slight lines around her eyes vanished while her brown hair began to look healthier. A now 35 year old Maddie shifted on the couch as she felt a slight tingle course through her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Weird,&quot; she said softly. &quot;Is the heat acting funny?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie slowly got off her couch as she made her way towards the thermostat. Checking it thoroughly she furrowed her brow. The temperature seems okay yet she still felt an unusual feeling. Rubbing her arms a now 30 year old Maddie looked around her home. &quot;Wonder what that is,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not coming down with something?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tapping her barefoot in annoyance Maddie now made her way towards the kitchen, still unable to shake the feeling. As she rummaged through her cupboards she grasped a bottle of theraflu. Maddie wasn&#39;t going to take any chances, if she was coming down with something she would nip it in the bud quickly. As she now reached for a glass, she was surprised to find her sweatpants slip on her hips.<br />
<br />
A 25 year old Maddie let a small squeak as she now grabbed the waist of her sweatpants. &quot;What the heck,&quot; she fumed. &quot;How did these things slip? They&#39;ve fit me perfectly for years now.&quot; Frowning she now pulled the string as tight as it would go before huffing in annoyance.<br />
<br />
As the now 22 year old poured herself a glass of orange juice. Taking some medicine the college age girl placed the glass in the sink before making her way back towards the t.v.<br />
<br />
Maddie stumbled on her way back to the living room, quickly catching herself. Looking down the girl frowned. Maddies pants seemed to have slipped once. Not only that she noticed the hems appeared to be dragging behind her slightly. &quot;What is going on,&quot; she mumbled.<br />
<br />
Maddie groaned in frustration, hitching her pants up as she walked. As she did she noticed her tshirt seemed baggie than usual also. Frustrated by her suddenly ill fitting clothes she paused to look over herself.<br />
<br />
Maddie looked over herself with confusion. She appeared skinnier than she was used to. Maddies breasts looked slightly smaller than usual while her hips seemed a bit narrower. Grunting in frustration Maddie made her way toward her bathroom. She need to make a closer inspection of herself.<br />
<br />
Turning on the light Maddie now made her way into her bathroom. &quot;Okay let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on here.&quot; As Maddie now turned towards her bathroom mirror she shrieked in surprise.<br />
<br />
Staring back at her was a girl around 15 or 16. As Maddie reached up to touch her face, she saw the girl do the same. Oh my god,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I...I look like a kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maddie gazed in awe at her teenage appearance gasping in shock as she saw the girls face become more innocent with each passing moment. Looking down at her body Maddie was shocked to see her curves were slowly but surely diminishing. Maddies once full d cup beats had been replaced by a pair of perky teenage b cups that were slowly growing smaller. Looking back up she could see the 16 year old girl now appeared 15. Maddies brown hair hung down just past her shoulders, framing a young innocent face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m getting younger,&quot; she whispered, not noticing her voice rising in octave. As she now fled the bathroom Maddie now tried to figure out how this started and how young she would get.</p>
