<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The giantess seized me. I was the size of about twice a Barbie doll in her hand but she took the magic ring off my finger. By magic, it grew and enlarged itself and she slid it onto her own finger. She wished for everyone around me in the street to forget that moment and with words of magic, she opened a portal, which got me back into her world. And me along with her. <br />
<br />
When I arrived, it was odd getting my bearings while being held at the waist by a giants, but I could see that you were on a plain of lush grass, with trees in the distance and flowers. It was just that the entire world was out of proportion. However, you were in front of a huge cottage with a garden patch at the front, big even by giant proportions, and there was a sign above it that read &quot;Roses and Cabbages&quot; with a rose and cabbage on each side. With purpose, the witch entered the building and there was a counter there. It was manned by a giant several times my size but who would have been considered a dwarf by their standards. He took a look at me and then smiled widely at the giantess holding me.     <br />
&quot;Why hello there, powerful magician. We were not expecting you so soon. What bring you here?&quot;<br />
&quot;This human fool. He used a magic ring and blew my disguise by accident. I employed another spell to counter it but now I have to go back and start again my enterprises in the human world. A stupid setback, apart from the ring I got out of it. In the meantime, I can sell you this one, to wait for more at further notice.&quot;<br />
She shook me a bit and then plonked me on the counter. <br />
&quot;Oh my, that IS frustrating,&quot; said the balding giant. &quot;Still, we can work with that.&quot;<br />
He said that last sentence eying me like a merchant would an animal for sale. He hummed, rubbing his chin. He then said Agalia would offer no more than three gold coins for me and the giantess nodded. Opening a cash register that made a lot more noise to my ears than it normally would, he handed her the fat circles of gold and she left, leaving me to my fate.<br />
<br />
The balding giant grabbed me and I asked with fright what would become of me. <br />
&quot;You see,&quot; he answered curtly. &quot;We giants reproduced slowly. Too slowly. So we use humans to help. We have magic rto make people grow, but not shrink. Not beyond a few months, at least. So we turn you humans into big giant babies and then you wait here to be adopted, all to grow at a normal giant pace and with a new family of loving parents.&quot;<br />
&quot;What?&quot; I shout. &quot;But I don&#39;t want that!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, your opinion does not matter anymore. Let&#39;s bring you to the machine. Agalia!&quot;<br />
A giantess with white clothes appeared and the giant holding me explained the situation to her. She nodded and said that the giantess you had first met was a good friend and that annoying things could always occur. She then scrutinized me and said she could work with someone like me. I squirmed and protested but she took no heed. She must have seen that a hundred times over.   <br />
&quot;Strap him down there. I know what to do with him. Let&#39;s get this done and over with&quot;, she said in a business-like tone.<br />
&quot;Of course, boss,&quot; smiled the giant who carried me down stairs to a big machine with a line with straps that went through mysterious covered sections.<br />
I shouted out for help again but the giant said that soon I would not remember my life as a young human and to stop my &#39;annoying squirms and cries&#39;, he proceeded to tickle me while uttering babyish &#39;coochie coochie coos&#39;. Quickly, I was laughing and squirming, but this time with spasms of laughter. The giant chuckled and strapped me down the line. I begged for it all to stop but he took a pinch of some sort of red powder and blew it in my face. Immediately I slumped down, silent and completely relaxed. My brain was registering how dire my situation was but my body did not respond, preferring to be ready to take a nap. And the line moved into the massive container, the dark unknown.<br />
<br />
The insides were dimly lit, which was a relief to me. The first stage had tiny blades on mechanical tendrils strip me of my clothes. Naked! I was naked as the day I was born, with my privates exposed and my body too sluggish to oppose any sort of resistance! Then the next gigantic container spread me with warm water and hands scrubbed me with suds, some even entering my mouth! I was rinsed and a gust of warm wind dried me off. However, I did notice some changes. My bones expanded and reshaped themselves. It was really painful. Just... very unsettling. I could feel them rearrange themselves, out of their own accord, seemingly, as if they were made of putty and a giant hand was restructuring them. However, I could see my body hair vanishing, dropping out all of a sudden, and my limbs becoming chubby, rolls of fat, baby fat, appearing. And my belly! I increased and swelled, turning into a paunchy tummy that only adults fing adorable on young children. From the outside, I heard a laughter from a male voice and as the line moved on yet again, the male giant speak.<br />
&quot;Now, let&#39;s put on him a little pyjama!&quot;<br />
And indeed that was what happened. New hands shot out, first to raise my tiny feet and expose my privates, with a penis flaccid because it had not reached puberty yet, and a scrotum that was just puny, even it appropriately so considering my new age. I felt a soft piece of cloth being slid under my bum, talcum powder sprinkled on me and my feet and buttocks gently lowered down to tape the diaper. Then a blue onesie was slipped on me without my body protesting any more than before. It was soft, yes, but... so degrading! I was strapped back and finally I reached the end of the line, with the two giants staring down at me. <br />
&quot;Perfect!&quot; aid Agalia. &quot;Not the prettiest but certainly cute enough. Let him sleep a bit and if no one picked him up by the time he wakes up, he can play in his playpen and stay there.&quot;<br />
What? I squirmed feebly but Agalia then injected me with something. I screamed and even though I could feel energy returning to my body, I still had no control over it. On the contrary, my movements were just jerky, uncoordinated and feeble. I tried to protest but only baby gurgles and sounds exited my throat! Worse, I smiled and could not stop sucking my thumb! Only when the giant slipped a pacifier into my mouth did I stop, and only to feel completely at ease and relaxed, my mouth now occupied. It felt like my brain was overpowered by new instincts I could not resist! Baby instincts. The giant then picked me up, placed me into a baby carrier and removed the pacifier from me. I was about to cry in spite of myself but he slid in the teat of a bottle which contained warm milk and I suckled eagerly. Yum! True, the giant and the world was still out of proportion but reasonably so, since I was now a baby giant amongst other giants, its own kind. But... What was going to happen to me? Was I really going to get...adopted? Have to suffer to be a baby, ruled by baby instincts? Too soon, the bottle was empty and the giant slid again the pacifier into my mouth. He took advantage of my relaxation because of my full belly and sucking toy to attach a frilly bonnet to my head. A stupid thing that prospective parents would no doubt find absolutely endearing. And I was powerless to remove it! The giant slipped a teddy bear too, whose soft fabric my baby mind found just impossible to resist. <br />
&quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry. In a few days, your brain will fully regress to how you were at three months. You&#39;ll fall asleep soon anyway. So stop being difficult.&quot;<br />
He left me there, fuming at the injustice of it all. Just because I had accidentally stripped a giantess, I had to relive my infancy, childhood and life as a giant. Soon all of my memories would be erased, all to be lived through again in different circumstances. And that was scary. I&#39;d be the same person I was, but only until now, at three months of age. Then, new experiences would shape me and how much would it influence my character? Would it still remain the same? How much of it? Was there a chance that my life might be better? And... Who would adopt me? Now THAT was a very important question! And that other stupid giant who assumed I&#39;d fall asleep at his orders! Yeah, right! I&#39;d find a way to escape and...  <br />
And five minutes later I was sleeping tight. Courtesy of the bellyful of warm milk.</p>
