<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Megan and Stewie decided to cut through the park, knowing it would be faster to get to the houses for some candy and then back, giving him even more time to watch DVDs. Stewie wanted to watch as many as he could before the sun rose again, ending the spooky night. As they ran through the park, through the trees and medium length wet grass, the only light that they had for guidance was from the full moon above. Stewie smiled, as this event reminded him of a few werewolf movies he had seen before. The whole idea of being a werewolf was something that peaked Stewie's interest, as the werewolf was the only halloween character that could do whatever it wanted and then become as inconspicuous as another human being could be. How fitting it was that he was in just a werewolf mask, as cheesy as it was, running through the woods under the light of the full moon. Playing around, Stewie threw his head back and howled as they progressed through the woods. Megan looked at him with a scowl, not very appreciative of his humor. Stewie was going to repeat himself when Megan elbowed him in the gut, stopping him and getting a sound of the wind being knocked out of him. Composing himself quickly, he just laughed and Megan still scowled as they continued.</br>
<br>Stewie looked at his younger sister, acting as though he didn't know why she did what she did. "What... I am just getting into character, after all... I am a werewolf, aren't I?"</br>
<br>Megan looked back at him, annoyed by his actions, knowing that he knew full well what he was doing. "Yeah, you are in a cheesy and cheap werewolf mask, but that doesn't mean you need to act like the dork you are." Finishing with a huge grin on her face.</br>
<br>Stewie shrugged his shoulders, blowing it off, but he kept himself in line. He knew that she was the key to his movie watching and if he wanted to watch anything, he had better be nice to her or she could force him to be out all night. Continuing through the woods of the park, Stewie noticed that it was getting brighter up ahead.</br>
<br>"Hey, it's pretty light up ahead, we must be on the other side of the woods finally. I thought we had taken a wrong turn somewhere or we just... got turned... around...?"</br>
<br>As Stewie finished the end of his sentence, the brother and sister duo stepped out of the woods and into a bright, rather large clearing with woods all around them. The open area was a huge circular clearing, brightly lit by the light of the full moon, the grass being slightly shorter than that of the woods. Wondering where they were, Stewie stopped with his sister in tow, looking around to try and find something to help them leave that area. Also, while looking around, Stewie realized that the grass had been mowed recently as it was all at a very uniform height.</br>
<br>"Well... I don't know where we are, but someone will probably come along and help us get out of here, someone was just here keeping the maintanence of the area." As he finished, Stewie pointed to Megan that the grass was freshly cut.</br>
<br>Megan raised her eyebrow, wondering how he could be so stupid. "Hey wolfman, do you really think someone will be back shortly? Uh... hello, the grass was just cut and you don't see any tools around or tracks in the grass to help us get out of here, do you?"</br>
<br>Stewie surveyed the area, realizing that she was right and then he scratched his head with the rubber of the mask while thinking of what he was going to do. Stewie was responsible for his sister's well-being, not to mention his own, on top his wanting to see some of his halloween movies. Looking out into the clearing, towards the center of it, he noticed that there was something there, but he couldn't tell what.</br>
<br>"Hey... do you see that out there?" He pointed toward what he saw.</br>
<br>Megan nodded her head and pointed to her right. "Yeah I see something out there, it's probably like that stone over there."</br>
<br>Stewie leaned slightly forward to see what she was talking about and scratched his head again.</br>
<br>"I guess I didn't even notice that when we got here, but yeah I see the stone that is about half my height. In fact there are several more around here, all in a line with a few more, all leading to what is over there in the center. I think if we check it out, we might be able to find out where we are and get you back on track with your candy hunting!"</br>
<br>Megan nodded enthusiastically, definitely agreeing with her getting some candy before the night was up. Walking on, headed toward whatever it was in the center, Stewie took note of their surroundings. There were several stones in the clearing, spread out somewhat far between one another. There were stones at the edge of the woods and from what he could tell, those lined the border in a large circle. There were others as well, another set being two yards from the outer set, and another set being a yard from the last, then another a half a yard from the other set. Reaching what Stewie would consider the center, the two walked into the middle of the closely placed stone ring. Stewie realized that they were cocentric rings, getting closer together the closer they were to the center. Wondering what the deal was, Stewie let go of Megan's hand to ponder what it was for, thinking this could have been right out of an alien abduction movie or something. As Megan was free, she ran from him to investigate where they were. Quickly realizing that she was no longer in his grasp, Stewie snapped out of his trance like thinking state and searched with his eyes to find where she went.</br>
<br>Thankfull enough, she did not get very far from him, not that he wouldn't be able to see her where they were at the present moment. Stewie saw that she was looking at something, he walked over to her and joined her in curious wonder. In the exact center of the ring, they were in and to the rest of the other stones, was a single and perfectly circular stone. Looking at it further, Stewie had to guess that this single stone was made out of a slab of black granite. The top was cut completely even and flat, the sides were perfectly curved, while the whole thing was polished very nicely. Stewie looked at it with arms crossed, impressed with the workmanship of it, knowing that someone took great care in what was there. He figured it had to be something like the Druids created, just like when they built Stonehenge. Megan, still being curious, leaned nearer to the top and pointed, puzzled by what she saw.</br>
<br>"Hey Stewie! There is something inscribed in this thing, but I can't make it out!"</br>
<br>Paying closer attention to what she pointed out, Stewie definitely saw writing in English, but he didn't know why she couldn't read it as it was as clear as the night they were smoewhat enjoying.</br>
<br>"Yeah, I see it. It is written in perfect English, stop being silly and read it to yourself!"</br>
<br>Megan stomped her foot into the soft, wet grass in true fashion of a ten year old having a bit of a fit. "I am not being silly! I can't read it... honestly! How about you read it out loud for me, since you can obviously see it Mr. Smartie-pants."</br>
<br>Shaking his head slightly and rolling his eyes, Stew took a deep breath and sighed. "Fine! I will read it out loud so you can know what it says. It is not really going to help us to get out of here and get you candy anyway."</br>
<br>Not really paying any mind to read it to himself before he did it out loud, Stewie began reading and it said:</br>
<br><i>During the night and during the day
We can have the time to play
On Halloween night, when the moon is full
We will once again begin to take our rightful rule.

We are the ones to be feared
We are the ones to be revered
We are the ones to be free
We are the ones to be the fulfilment of destiny.

That is ours to take
Truly make no mistake
Here and now we begin
The werewolves live again!</i></br>
<br>The two looked at each other, not really sure of what was going on, thinking this had to be some sort of practicle joke a friend of Stewie's had to be playing. Not really knowing what to do now or where to go, both stood still for a moment and noticed something different.</br>
<br>Looking around, Stewie noticed that the light from the moon was slightly brighter than it was a moment ago. Thinking he was going crazy, Stewie looked down at his sister and she looked up at him somewhat puzzled again.</br>
<br>"Is it just me, or did the light from the moon just get slightly brighter?"</br>
<br>Confused by his question, Megan furled her eyebrow, thinking he was nuts. "No, I think it is just you. The light from the moon has been the same this whole time! Can we just go back home now? I am tired and I don't really want candy now!"</br>
<br>Chuckling again, amused by her whimsy, Stewie nodded. "Yeah, we can head back I guess. We will just retrace our steps here and hopefully make it back home soon."</br>
<br>Megan jumped for joy, happy as a lark now, and walked out of the central ring where Stewie was still standing. As soon as both her feet were out of the ring, the ring of stones began to glow in a somewhat slow pulse. Thinking that they were both seeing things, they rubbed their eyes and when they looked at the stones again, they saw the same thing. Not knowing what was going on, Megan walked toward the central ring and when she tried to step into it again, she was stopped by an invisible force.</br>
<br>"What happened, can't you get into the rings where I am?"</br>
<br>"No! It wont let me! Why don't you just come to me and see what happens... maybe you can leave."</br>
<br>Stewie took a few steps, heading through were she just walked and was also stopped by some invisible force. When he stepped back away from the threshold of the rings, light radiated from the ground, matching that of the moon. Worried now for her brother's safety, Megan began yelling for him to get out of there, even though that he was stuck and nothing was going to change that right now. Stewie just looked at her, not knowing what to do, especially since they were so close to one another yet so far apart at the moment.</br>
<br>Suddenly, Stewie could feel energy of some sort pulse outward from the central stone, pushing outward in a single and strong blast, making the next set of stones pulse with the moon's light.</br>
<br>"I think something is happening and I think I will have to stay right here until it's over!"</br>
<br>Megan sat down on the grass, scared that she was going to lose her brother, and began crying. Stewie wanted to go to her and comfort her, but he knew at that present time he was not going to be able to do anything. Suddenly, another blast came from the central stone, going out to the second set of stones before the outer ring at the woods and they began to pulse. All Stewie could do was stand there and wait for it to be over, which he hoped would be soon so he could take care of his sister. A third burst went out and set the last rings aglow, which was quicker than the last two. Realizing that each was closer together than the one before it, he figured that it woul be over and everything would be alright. Suddenly the central stone began to pulse, with all the others pulsing in unison, speeding up as they did. Quickly, the clearing became a huge moonlight pulsating beacon of a sorts, rapidly pulsing and building up to something. At the end of the last pulse, the pulse held brightly for a second and drew back into the center from which they first came, with force when Stewie realized it was drawing into him and not the stone! As the energy entered his body quickly, Stewie felt like he was the center of a black hole and being pulled every which way simultaneously. There was a large and bright flash as the light finished entering him, knocking Stewie back a bit, stumbling while trying to keep himself from falling.</br>
<br>Composing himself quickly, he tried to leave the circle and was successful. Reaching his sister, Stewie pulled the mask off, revealing his handsome boyish face and coddled his sister, ensuring that she knew everything was going to be ok. As he sat there, rocking back and forth, cooing and calming his sister down, he stroked his fingers through her hair, which always made her relax. Megan sniffed a couple times and then gave her brother a big hug, happy that she didn't lose him and still be stuck whereever they were.</br>
<br>"Hey... you gonna be ok Meg?"</br>
<br>"Yeah... I guess so. I'm just happy you can leave and we can get back home. What do you think just happened?"</br>
<br>"I don't know, but whatever it was... I don't think we should tell anyone."</br>
<br>"What happened to the light? I was crying and I had my hands over my eyes, so I didn't get to see what happened."</br>
<br>"I don't know that either. I think the light just went back into the central stone, as weird as that may sound."</br>
<br>Stewie knew that was a big lie, but it worked as Megan clamoured to her feet. Stewie just wanted to get home and forget that the whole thing happened in the first place. As they began walking back the same way they came in, Megan scratched her head while looking at her brother, not saying a word. Stewie noticed that she did that and looked at her sternly.</br>
<br>"What's up with that look there sis?"</br>
<br>"Oh nothin... I just thought you couldn't grow a beard at all and I think the stubble looks good on you, makes you look older."</br>
<br>"What are you talking about? You know I can't grow a be...ea...rd..."</br>
<br>As he was finishing his sentence, Stewie felt his face to be sure of what she said and felt stubble where there never was any. That was extremely odd, he never could grow anything like he said, but it felt as though he had always been able to grow a beard and shrugged it off. As they got a bit further, Stewie felt a cramp in his gut, making both stop in thier tracks. Megan looked on in concern as her brother stood there, doubled over. Quickly, things became very different, very quickly. Before that evening he was as skinny as a bean pole and had a light complexion ontop of it, but when he was finally able to stand up again, things were much different. Stewie saw huge, while soft, weightlifter muscles. His skin was nicely tanned and his arms were nicely covered in hair, all the way to his hands and fingers, up to mid bicep. Again, it was odd, but he felt it was always there and he shrugged it off. They took another step closer to the woods and Stewe nonchalantly scratched at his chest, running his fingers through thick and manly chest hair, which was normal to him.</br>
<br>Suddenly and without warning, things took on a bigger change, stopping him where he was, while Megan continued on a bit without realizing her brother was not there with her. When she realized he wasn't with her, Megan turned around and gasped in horror. Before her very eyes, Stewie was changing into something... else. Stewie's bones popped and cracked, growing and filling out to fit some new form he was taking. Stewie's hands became thicker, meatier and puffy as they lengthend slightly and gnarled. Stewie felt the palms of his hands thicken, developing thick and soft black pads. His fingernails then grew longer, pointed and curled slightly while blackening, forming claws of a sort. Megan watched on in fright, seeing a smile on her brother's face, apparently enjoying what he was going through. A loud rip was heard and Stewie looked down to see his feet that were now clawed paws poking through what used to be his sneakers. Stewie wiggled his toes, ensuring that they were definitely his. Then another rip came as his hairy and tanned legs that were shown off by his already tight shorts ripped at the seams when thighs bulked slightly like his legs, pushing the seams of his already tight shorts past their limits. His arms and entire torso did the same, shredding through his clothes. Stewie stood there with just a smile and his gray boxer briefs on him, which were straining from his added size when they were just very loose fitting on him. Suddenly his cock began stirring in his pants, being turned on by what was happening to him, growing bigger than he ever knew that he was. As his cock grew, his balls did too, keeping up with the added size of the member. As it grew, it ran out of room and his big mushroom head was sticking a few inches above the waist band, oozing copious amounts of sticky, sweet and clear precum. His shorts becoming painful, he slashed through them with his new claws and they fell in tatters at his wolven feet. Fur, blonde fur matching his hair color spread all over his body, quickly covering him. Megan wanted to scream, but she was too terrified to even utter a sound as her brother changed completely into a beast! Stewie's ears lengthened and pointed like a wolf's ears, while moving to the top of his head, while his face pushed out into a muzzle. As Stewie yawned a bit, loosing his jaw from the change, Megan saw that his teeth were now sharp fangs, his tongue was wider and flat, his nose turned black, wet and leathery while the whites of his eyes were now yellow. As Stewie's long and furry wolf tail popped out of his butt, Stewie threw his new head back and howled out in wolven glory, displaying his new found ability.</br>
<br>Megan looked at him in horror, not knowing if her brother was even still in there, somewhere. Stewie smiled a very wolven and wry smile, enjoying what he was now.</br>
<br>"What's the matter Megan, don't like me as I am now... huh?"</br>
<br>Megan was even more terrified than she had been after she heard him speak. His voice was much deeper, more animalistic and sounded slightly evil. Not even able to speak, she nodded her head yes, answering his question.</br>
<br>"Aww... well thats TOO BAD!!! I like the way I am now and I don't plan on giving this up at all! I am finally the creature I have always wanted to be! Why do you think I was so into all those werewolf movies? Even though we got here by chance, I'm glad we did, because I am now superior to everyone else!"</br>
<br>Scared for her life, hearing what she thought was malice, Megan just ran into the woods, screaming her head off and hoped that she would get home to tell her parents what had happened. Stewie just stood there, in all his wolven glory, laughing sinisterly and threw his head back in a very ominous howl that resonated in the clearing and through the woods.</br>
<br>Knowing she would not find her way out of the woods for a little while, he placed his attention on his large and still human shaped cock, that was now mostly covered in his precum. Taking his large, right paw, he wrapped it around the monster and jacked easily from his self made lubricant. Curious of how his new spunk tasted, he brought his paw to his muzzle and took a long lick, slurping it all up in the single flick of his long and flat tongue. The taste was sweet, like pure sugar and he wanted more. In a test of his flexibility, Stewie bent down and took his whole cock in his mouth easier than he expected. Slowly, he suckled on it, enjoying the feel of it in his mouth and being sucked at the same time, as well as the flavored fluid he was producing even more of now. Slowly, he moved his maw up and down the throbbing member, sucking himself until he came in his mouth. Stewie sealed his lips around his cock, ensuring he got every drop of the thick and white, sugar sweet fluid in his mouth and down his throat. When he felt the torrent subside and end, emptying a gallon of his own cum into his hungry and awaiting stomach, Stewie pulled off of himself carefully and howled in satisfaction this time.</br>
<br>Content for now, Stewie placed his attention back on the situation at hand. He made a mental note of where the place was and every step he made through the woods. Stewie knew he had to either get to his house and turn his dad before his sister got home or he would have to kill her in the woods and deal with his dad after.</br>
<br>Stewie always knew he was gay since the first day he remembered seeing his father naked coming out of the bathroom when Stewie entered the hall. From that point on, he also had a crush on his dad, especially for being the rugged and big dicked guy that he was with a nice set of large testicles that Stewie knew he was born from. It was also a secret between the two, but when Stewie came out to his dad, his dad came out to him right after, which resulted in them playing around a bit. Stewie was happy though, he got to suck off his dad and get his first taste of cum, which he thought was delicious because it was a heavy and thick, white load. Little did he know that his dad's cum was a lot thicker and heavier in the amount, especially when he didn't jack off prior to a secret engagement. Stewie wanted to give this to his dad, more than anything, which was exactly what he was going to do... after dealing with Megan!</br></p>
