<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let&#39;s turn Mommy into a dog.&quot; &quot;A dog?! That&#39;s... an amazing idea!&quot; Richard exclaimed. &quot;We always wanted a dog, but Mommy never let us. It&#39;s perfect!&quot; &quot;So you like it?&quot; &quot;I do... Of course, I would have been fine with anything. You have the power... Just don&#39;t turn me into a dog.&quot; Richard added. &quot;You know I wouldn&#39;t do that.&quot; &quot;Right, of course. Let&#39;s get ready then. They went to the living room again and waited for their Mom&#39;s text. About twenty five minutes later, they got a text saying, &quot;I&#39;m almost home boys. Making dinner.&quot; &quot;And there it is.&quot; Richard said. &quot;Hey, how did you cover for Daddy?&quot; Alan asked. &quot;Oh I used his cell phone and pretended to be him. Worked like a charm, it did!&quot; &quot;You really have the hang of this.&quot; &quot;Well I AM technically the oldest one here!&quot; As he said that, they heard the car come up the driveway. &quot;Here she comes. Get ready!&quot; &quot;Okay!&quot; Alan was about to type something in when Richard stopped him. &quot;What is it?! Mommy will be here soon!&quot; &quot;Just make sure her mind is a dog too.&quot; &quot;What? Why?!&quot; &quot;Cause we don&#39;t want her biting us or something.&quot; &quot;Oh right...&quot; Alan then typed in his wish. &quot;I wish our Mom had the body and mind of a dog made for us twins.&quot; &quot;Oh, good one!&quot; Richard said as he gave the thumbs up. Alan set the phone on the ground again and waited.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey, I&#39;m home!&quot; The door opened and in came their mother, Andrea Simmons. &quot;Honey? Richie! Alan!&quot; She called out when she saw no one was here to greet her. &quot;That&#39;s funny. Where did they go?&quot; She failed to notice the phone on the ground as it flashed. &quot;What?!&quot; She dropped her keys as she covered her eyes. The light faded in no time. &quot;What was that about?&quot; she wondered as she picked up the phone. &quot;This is Alan&#39;s isn&#39;t it? I wonder what it was doing on the ground.&quot; she thought as he scratched her arms. She failed to notice the hair on them was growing. &quot;Phew! Did it get hot in here all of the sudden? Pant. Pant.&quot; Andrea could feel her body heat up as she breathed harder and harder. Eventually her tongue started sticking out. &quot;Excuse me!&quot; she said as she pressed it back into her mouth, but it kept coming back out. &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot; she thought, when she noticed her hand was shrinking. Her fingers dug into the base of her hand, getting stubbier in the process. Her fingernails stuck out and sharpened into a cylindrical shape. &quot;What&#39;s going on?!&quot; she thought again. She tried to speak, but her constant panting prevented her. As she struggled to comprehend what was happening, she fell onto all fours. &quot;Whoa!&quot; she screamed as she looked back. The backs of her heels were pushing off her high heels and up in the air. Hair was growing on it as well as the sides of her feet pressed into to middle. It looked like she was getting hind legs, like from some kind of animal. &quot;This can&#39;t be happening?!&quot; she thought. She kicked off her heels and saw that her feet were rectangular. Her toe nails did what her fingernails had done. A thick coat of blonde hair was covering her whole body. She could feel it encase her hands, as a small bit of flesh grew out and puffed up. &quot;What&#39;s happening it me?!&quot; she thought. &quot;Awoooo!&quot; she tried to speak again, but let out a howl. It was then she realized she was turning into some kind of dog. <br />
<br />
&quot;But that&#39;s impossible!&quot; &quot;Awoooo!&quot; Andrea could feel her breast shrinking back into her body and become covered in hair. She tried to scratch at her body, using her hind legs to do so. &quot;Awoooo! Awoooo!&quot; She cried out as hair started to form on her face. She could feel a tingling in her groin. She sat up straight and pissed herself. &quot;Awooo!&quot; she cried again. It soaked her panties. Her groin area which was also full of hair absorbed the piss. Her vagina continued to tingle as it transformed. She could feel her fluids become inhuman. A small ripping sound was heard as a tail grew out from her butt, getting longer and hairier. &quot;Awooo!&quot; Crying out once more, Andrea could feel her nose stick out from her face, taking skin with it that soon became covered with hair. Her teeth sharpened as the color faded from her eyes, which felt like they were getting wider. She scratched herself again and was able to successfully do so, though it gave her no pleasure. But she soon started to like it. As she wondered why, she could feel her mind drain of human thought. &quot;No, no, no! I don&#39;t want this! Please, somebody help me! Somebody... me help! Somebo.... Ssssss!&quot; But her pleas were to no avail as her mind was soon replace of that of a dog. &quot;Awooooooo!&quot; She cried out on more time as she collapsed on the floor, still in her human clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like the wish as a success!&quot; Richard said as he got up from the hiding place. &quot;Let&#39;s take her clothes off before she wakes up.&quot; Richard took a pair of scissors and cut everything off. He also took of the panties,which were soaked with piss. &quot;Bad girl, Andrea! Looks like you need to be punished later!&quot; he said as he threw the panties in the trash. &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you come out and see your work Alan!&quot; Richard called out. &quot;I&#39;d like to...&quot; Alan said as he peaked out. &quot;But the whole thing kind of gave me an erection...&quot; Richard just let out a mischievous grin as he said, &quot;That just means you&#39;re getting used to this brother!&quot;</p>
