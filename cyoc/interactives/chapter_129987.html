<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aiden&#39;s fingers found vinyl and he dragged the heavy pair of shoes from the back of the shelf. They were a pair of hot pink platform sandals, with a 3&quot; platform and a 5&quot; heel, and clear plastic straps around the ankles and just beneath the toes. Some glitter was embedded in the plastic. Aiden put them on the ground and threw his feet into them as quickly as possible, afraid he was going to outgrow the ludicrous shoes. <br />
<br />
They were still rather large on him, he found as he didn&#39;t the ankle strap. His feet crept down the soles until his toes peeked out from the front. A layer of pristine pearlescent nail polish coated his toenails as they continued to grow. <br />
<br />
Even as they got longer, Aiden&#39;s feet slimmed considerably. His skin became soft and hairless as he got used to wearing heels. The transformation traveled up his legs, stretching his shins out and bulking up his calves. Fishnet stockings appeared at his toes when spread up over his smooth, very sensitive skin. The legs of Aiden&#39;s pants rolled up as more of his legs changed. His definitely larger-than-usual erection strained against his jeans as his thighs thickened and lengthened, becoming longer and curvy. Without the shoes, Aiden was more than half a foot taller than ben had been, and only in his long and shapely legs. <br />
<br />
The hems of Aiden&#39;s now-shorts frayed as the color of the denim lightened and the legs conformed more to his body. A distinct tingling went through his cock and, for a moment, Aiden was worried he&#39;d lose it and become a woman. But the tingling only surged, making pre ooze from his tip, and his cock got even longer and thicker. His balls followed. Having their size increased and hair stripped from them felt like soft, small hands playing with his testes. Aiden moaned, voice hoarse. The front of his daisy dukes bulged out with the size of his cock, which felt like it was over a foot long. The shorten tightened around Aiden&#39;s body as his hips flared out and his ass grew into a lucious pair of overstuffed cheeks falling out the back of his jeans. If his clothes hadn&#39;t been transformed by magic, Aiden was unsure if it was even possible for him to pull such a tiny pair of shorten over such ludicrously thick thighs, let alone make an ass that big fit in them. <br />
<br />
His shirt began to lift up, and Aiden&#39;s tummy pulled in and a ring appeared through his belly button. His stomach remained soft, but it showed off just a hint of his well-toned core. His waist remained broad, but just small enough to maintain the new pear shape of his body and emphasize his booty. Aiden&#39;s torso stretched longer and longer as it became proportional to his lower half. <br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s shirt dissolved into a loose crop top hanging over his ribs. His chest thinned out and became completely hairless, but just a little soft in the pecs. His shoulders broadened and one of the straps holding his crop top up slid down his arm, revealing the top of one wide nipple. Aiden&#39;s arms stretched out as they became more feminine, but also long enough to look correct on his body. His palms broadened and his fingers lengthened. His nails became long and well-kept, with a French manicure set in a glossy topcoat. A small purse, just big enough for a phone, some lipstick, and a credit card materialized in his hands. <br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s neck grew longer and almost swan-like as chokers wrapped around it. One of them was in black leather, with a heavy sterling silver heart-shaped padlock keeping it closed. His head was next, his jawline lengthening and his cheekbones protruding. A light dusting of highlighter and blush made them stand out more. Aiden&#39;s limps plumped as his mouth grew to match his new jaw, becoming bee-stung in appearanc with pale pink lipstick. His nose stretched as its tip flicked up. His eyes enlarged, turning bright green, and his lashes lengthened until he could easily see them. His eyebrows refined themselves as purple eyeshadow spread over his lids. All the acne scars he had acquired in high school faded away. <br />
<br />
Aiden&#39;s hair was last, remaining dark brown but straightening and lengthening to his shoulders. It took on a glossy shine that made him look like a model from a shampoo commercial. Small ring size embedded themselves down the outsides of his ears. <br />
<br />
Aiden was coolly surprised by his new height. His long legs quickly took him to a tall mirror in between racks of shoes. He was a little too tall for it, having to duck down to see his perfectly symmetrical face. Even without the shoes, he had to be approaching eight feet tall. Aiden felt powerful, in a poised sort of way, like he could pick up any boy he wanted to just by winking. He ran his slender hands up his arms and legs, shivering at the sensation. His skin was incredibly sensitive. Experimentally, Aiden brushed his fingers over his exposed nipple. Ben nearly fell to his knees, his monstercock busting through the zipper of his shorts with arousal. It had to be at least two feet long and four inches thick. Even his dick looked softer and more sophisticated. Running a hand up the incredible length, Aiden noticed the Jacob&#39;s ladder piercings along its underside. A huge glob of precum splattered on the floor when he touched the warm metal rings. Aiden moaned, his voice higher pitched but somewhat more husky, velvety... a little feminine and very alluring.  <br />
<br />
Aiden unzipped his little wrist purse and pulled his phone--a much higher end, more chic model than it had been--and snapped a picture of himself in the mirror, dick out and all. He immediately posted it on Instagram. &quot;Lol! Guess this boy is too big for the mirror! #oops #modelsofinstagram #selfiesunday #imtoosexy&quot;</p>
