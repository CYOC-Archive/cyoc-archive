<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The one that was decorated with all sorts of video game stickers caught your eye the most. You had to admit, if given the choice, being able to retain some interest in gaming... that&#39;d be fun. Something you already enjoyed, and that you could keep enjoying when you weren&#39;t getting laid, or trying to get laid. Fuck it, why not? With a snap bit of confidence, you grabbed up the bottle of perfume and sprizted some of it around your neck, immersing yourself in the transformative pink gas before you had a chance to change your mind. Behind you, Becky was squealing with delight.<br />
<br />
As soon as you set the perfume back down, you were feeling... light headed wasn&#39;t the correct term. More like... relaxed, mentally. Lots of little things you had been worrying about a second ago, the ever-present anxieties of adulthood, they seemed to melt away in an instant. You just felt more positive in general, more optimistic. Focused purely on the nice things in life. Fuck, but it felt nice - was this how bimbos felt all the time? No wonder they were always cheery, you realized, as a smile spread across your face. <br />
<br />
The desire to just relax, have, fun and enjoy yourself was welling up, and fast. Why had you always been so concerned about learning, about knowledge, about trying to figure out a complicated world? It was so much easier to just roll with things, to focus on what you liked. Feeling good was the name of the game. You felt good when you played video games, and you felt good when you played with yourself, so why not just... do that all the time? Who was gonna stop you? Nobody, that&#39;s who. No, they were gonna encourage you, that much you were certain of.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to waste any time, you got right to the whole playing with yourself part. You cheerily stuck your hands under your shirt, not really thinking about how they were morphing from a blue t-shirt into a black tank top with a happy pink bunny emblem on the chest. That just made it easier to slip your hands around your boobs and give them a good squeeze. It was really good, in fact! You squeezed a couple more times, and every time, you swore you felt more boob, and that you could feel more of all that extra boob. They were getting biggger! Score!<br />
<br />
You kept squeezing and squeezing, going until they were so big and round and heavy that it was pulling you forward and making all that lonk, silky blonde hair you were growing tumble over. That was okay, though, because your titties were huge! Bigger around each than your head! You grinned with delight at imagining how easily you could fit a drink into there, add a straw, and bam! Hands free energy drinks! Oh, that was gonna be such a game changer when you were deathmatching against some scrub way late at night who had to take their hands off the keyboard to sip a drink.<br />
<br />
The rest of your body was changing, too, and it felt so nice and warm - especially because you were getting <i>optimized</i>. You were getting a little plush, not super fat or anything, but no way were you gonna be a skinny girl. Nice, more weight meant stuff wandering through the house and smacking into you wouldn&#39;t disturb you as much. You were getting awful big, though, way down south - ughhhhh, it felt so amazing, the way your butt was filling up, getting so huge! You&#39;d fill out any chair completely, which would mean a secure hold inside your seat, no getting thrown out by jerking around.<br />
<br />
It was so hot, and by now, your pussy was soaking wet. You were pretty sure you&#39;d be moist a lot from now on, but again, optimization! You could have somebody eat you out while you gamed, and no needing to grab lubricant! Honestly, whoever had made that perfume thought of everything. You could feel your head filling back up now that all that dumb math and history and whatever stuff was gone. There was sex stuff, yeah, soooooo many ways to handle a joystick, but game knowledge too! All sorts of strategies, super game sense, everything you&#39;d need to dominate any random scrubs online. Your gag reflex vanished, but your reflexes with a mouse were getting to be killer.<br />
<br />
Looking down, you... couldn&#39;t see anything past your tits, which were at least really fucking great to look at, but there was a mirror nearby that let you see just how smoking hot you&#39;d become. You were so curvy and thick, ugh, you wanted to kiss yourself on your plump lips right then and there! And your boring old clothes were gone - you had the tank top to show off those amazing titties, some booty shorts that barely covered your ass, and, oh, the thigh high stockings, with the black and white stripes? Fucking perfect, the way they led down to your sneakers. So. Fucking. Hot.<br />
<br />
Becky sure seemed to think so too. &quot;Oh my gosh, you came out soooooooo great!&quot; She stepped over and hugged you, letting her big tits squish into your own, and in about a second it turned into kissing passionately, full lips smacking, tongues exploring mouths. She pulled back and grinned, squeezing your ass cheeks tight as her dainty hands could manage. &quot;Do you wanna make out more? Ooooo, or we could fuck! And some of the other girls can join!&quot; Indeed, you had quite a few eyes on you now, complete with a lot of girls giving you looks of desire. &quot;What do you wanna do, hun?&quot;<br />
<br />
You smirked back. &quot;You got a console set up around here?&quot; She nodded cheerfully, leading you off into a connecting side room set up with a TV, a bed, a console, and a table with some scattered games and controllers on it. &quot;Perfect,&quot; you went on as you stepped over to the bed and patted it. &quot;Nww get up here. Your face looks like an awesome gaming chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
Barely able to contain her delight, she eagerly hopped up onto the bed and laid back, mouth open and tongue out. Fuck, she was eager. You didn&#39;t waste any time either, quickly slipping off your booty shorts before grabbing a controller and crawling onto the bed. It felt natural as anything else inb the world to kneel over Becky&#39;s face, switching on the console as you lowered yourself down onto her desperate tongue. Pretty much instantly once you&#39;d come to a rest, she was licking like mad, drawing out excited moans from you as you tried to focus on booting up some shooter game. Generic crap, but full of scrubs to slaughter.<br />
<br />
Becky&#39;s expertise started to become apparent fast. She knew just where to stick her tongue, the best spots to send chills up your spine. Rather than be a distraction, though, you found that the more aroused you got, the better you played - the erotic thrill was helping you focus and play better. Fuck yes. &quot;Harder, c&#39;mon!&quot; you yelled down to her as another match started up, &quot;I gotta grind competitive here!&quot; You were gonna rise right to the top if she kept this up. Oh fuck yes, that perfume had been the best fucking decision of your life.</p>
