<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;So this is the inn?&quot; Askes Alice. &quot;Purple Moonlight Inn is what the sign says&quot; Andrea points out &quot;but yeah, not what I had in mind when I thought secluded, Succubi welcome inn.&quot; The two of them were standing in front of a literal mansion. With a large fenced in property, that took up the entire block. It was easily 9 times the area of any other inn near by, and most likely, rediculously expensive. The real surprise was that there were several guards stationed around the perimeter, all facing outward. The place wasn&#39;t appearing busy either. But maybe that was because it was just about midday.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a commotion begins near what we expect to be the front door. Apparently 3 guards are trying to hold back a succubus from what can only be described as a complete slaughter of a fight. 3 men and 2 women are all moaning in pain on the floor. The insides are all darkly lit, with rainbow colored strobe lights and a yellowish glow being the only illumination visible from the outside. You both also notice that every single person you can see near the door way is wearing expensive suits and dresses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, what do you think is happening&quot; asked Andrea. &quot;A party of 5 drunks apparently got a little too hands on with one of the succubi, and she nearly killed them all.&quot; Andrea looks over at Alice in disbelief &quot;wait really? How can you tell from here?&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice shrugs &quot;I can&#39;t, it was just my guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... right, duh.&quot; Andrea looks back at the sceen. The Succubus is still struggling a bit, but now that the 5 people are in iron cuffs and being taken away by a few of the guards, she seems to be calming down. However the moment she notices us watching, she pushes all the guards off of her with her wings, knocking most of them down in the process and jumps, then uses her wings to glide over to right in front of us, specifically Alice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you looking to stay here? If so then just hop the fence. Succubi stay here for free you know, and you can bring your friend too, as long as she can stay in your room, or if she wants to, come down and enjoy herself in the Cabaret as one of your 3 VIP slots. As long as she wears this ribben, no other Succubi will touch her. Oh, and you can do whatever here miss....uh...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alice&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss Alice!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Alice please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just Alice got it. So, Alice, as I was saying. You both can kinda do whatever here. Work or just enjoy your stay in the Caberet, rent yourselves and your room out as a brothel spot, drink, fuck everything that isn&#39;t claimed by a ribben, etc... all free of charge for you and up to 3 of your friend. By the way, you can call me Shane, and I own this place. Just pick any room with an open balcony door that you see.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, thanks? I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, ribbions are in the rooms, also my personal room is the only room on the top floor&quot; she said while pointing at the top balcony of the building. &quot;So please, feel free to just stop by whenever. I always leave my balcony door open too, so just come right inside when you do and make yourself at home. That said, it appears I am going to have to cut our conversation short for now, see ya.&quot; Saying that, Shane immediately took off and landed on to an open balcony near what looked to be the top floor of the mansion, as a few guards had finally reached your location. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, Shane. You still need to give us a statment about the incident&quot; shouted one of the guards, at which a piece of paper which had been balled up fell off kf the balcony Shane had just slipped into the mansion with. One of the guards collected it, and confirmed it was her statement. &quot;Hhhhuuuhhhhh that woman...&quot; sighed one of the guards. &quot;You have to leave the mansion&#39;s property one of these days right? Its been several years since you last left your own home. It isn&#39;t right.&quot; He called out to the open window, but got no more response. Finally he took notice of us and came over.<br />
<br />
&quot;You both new here? If you could do us a favor. We ask all new tenants this, and maybe we are stepoing outside of our job description by doing so, but please, if you could, try to help Shane with getting over her agoraphobia. Even if only a little push now and then is greatly appreciated. But by no means are you being forced to either. This is just simply a guard&#39;s personal request. There isn&#39;t any merit or reward to it, besides our thanks. Anyways, enjoy your stay at The Purple Moonlight Inn.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice thanked the guard and turned to pick up Andrea, but the moment they were again alone, Andrea began freaking out.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was Shane. Like THE Shane, the amazing S-ranked adventurer. I can&#39;t believe we are staying in her inn!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You gonna be ok? I get that she was pretty strong, but is she really that special to start fangirling over?&quot; Alice asked being rather confused with Andrea&#39;s reaction to meeting their hostess.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Sorry. I&#39;ve been a fan of her&#39;s for a long time. It is a shame to hear she has succumb to agoraphobia though... I wonder why? Maybe we should go see her and talk about it! Maybe she is just lonely or nervous around crowds of people? If we help expose her more then that is an easy fix don&#39;t you think Alice??? What? Why are you looking at me like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your the kind of person who has 0 self awareness about how you come off to others aren&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh please, like you can talk. It&#39;d be like the pot calling the kettle black. And I do so have self awareness. But now that you mentioned it, that did sound a tad bit too abrasive of a way of dealing with... curing Shane&#39;s agoraphobia. Actually, that also may be the cause of it, excessive fandom interactions. Maybe that is why she made her home into an extremely expensive club, and would explain why she beat down those guys earlier if they were some of her fans being overly obnoxious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea looked like she would ponder this for a while if left to her own devices, so Alice scooped her up into a princess carry, and flew them both into the open balcony right below the one Shane had entered, closing its door behind her.<br />
<br />
The room was larger than expected<br />
Although there was only 1 huge bed, there was pleanty of space to move around and to set of other sleeping arrangements if needed. The white walls had a decorative lavender colored vine pattern going accross the entire room which made the room have a softer, calming feel to it somehow, which Alice really enjoyed. She was worried that the rooms would be bright pinks and reds, covered with hearts, rose petals and other super lovey dovey crap that made it look like valentine&#39;s day had puked all over it. But nope, there was almost nothing like that at all. Even the dark purple bed covers had just more vine like patterns. <br />
<br />
Since no candles or other light sources were being used currently, the room had a grey hue to it too. &quot;Woah check out this place&quot; appreciated Andrea as she walked around the room. The room wasn&#39;t just a bed room either. There was an attached bathroom too, as well as a small table with seating for 4, a writing desk, and a few cabinets. The last thing it had was a wall to wall walk-in closet, filled with shelving meant for equipment, 4 shoe racks and, a weapons rack, 4 hanging rods for clothing, a coat stand, and even 4 full sized female manequines, currently dressed in robes with the same lavender vines on a white colored background pattern as the room had. On the bed there were 3 ribbons, each also had the pattern as well. &quot;I guess they sort everything by patterns maybe?&quot; Alice says as she picks up one of the ribbons to get a closer look. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey come look at this thing&quot; Andrea called out from the hallway containing the room&#39;s front door that lead further into the building. Next to the door was a black panel with the words &quot;claim room&quot; printed above it. &quot;Well, it says claim room above it, so it likely is how we confirm our room is no longer available?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, this kind of reminds me of a touch screen. Maybe if I press my hand on it, it will work in a similar way?&quot; Thought Alice to herself as she extended her right hand and pressed it onto the surface. Instantly the panel glowed and a red line which spanned the panel horizontally, passed up and down a few times before blinking twice and turning into a green line with a circle in the middle. The words on the wall above the panel changed to read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Room Tennants&quot;<br />
&quot;Alice Hansen, +2 Additionals&quot;<br />
&quot;Pets: +1 Nekomata Kitten&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea then let out a nervous cry. &quot;Alice help me, the ribbon is stuck!&quot; Alice looked over at Andrea and saw that one of the ribbons was wrapped tightly around her neck, however it wasn&#39;t that it was constricting her throat more so that it was merging with her neck itself, until finally all that was left was a lavendar vine tatoo which wrapped around her neck in a thin band which rapidly faded to a darker shade of purple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you alright Andrea? Can you breathe, does it hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I am fine. Nothing hurts and I can breathe normally. It just startled me is all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so. I guess this way you can&#39;t lose it at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And it is done like this so that it is not as easy to hide or accidently cover up. You wouldn&#39;t believe how much trouble we had before I upgraded them to these new ones&quot; suddenly came from behind Alice. Both girls looked towards the door, with Alice also jumping back away from it a good 10 feet, from being startled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oops sorry about scaring you both.&quot; Said Shane, who was casually standing in the entryway, with her arms behind her back, completely naked, but with her hair down her front, obscuring her nipples from direct view. However that didn&#39;t help between her legs at all. &quot;What? Can&#39;t I be naked in my own home?&quot; <br />
<br />
Alice took a deep breath in order to calm herself down. &quot;Absolutely! Being naked at home always feels the best.&quot; Now also stripping, but left her heels and gloves on for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perverts&quot; quipped Andrea, rolling her eyes, but also stared removing her clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Succubi&quot; responded Shane and Alice together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, so we got load of time until Vivian returns, wanna fuck? You can join us if you wish Shane. Oh and this is Neka, she&#39;s is a nekomata kitten, but she is usually harmless, and sleeps a lot. But she still can be dangerous if provoked. Is it alright to keep her here with us? &quot; asked Alice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would I toss out a single nekomata kitten, if while at the same time, I am keeping an entire succubi nest, inside of a town, and am still able to easily maintain order? You tell me which is the greater threat to society. Haha. And hell yeah I will join, I came here specifically to do just that you know. You guys have any kind of rules I should know about, or better yet, any new or unusual kinds of sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrea grinned &quot;Oh we got something alright. Tell us, have you ever fuck a hot ass tomboy and a comatose succubi slut while being a passenger inside of your own body?&quot;</p>
