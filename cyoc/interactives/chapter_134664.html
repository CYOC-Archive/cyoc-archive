<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Group finally returned back to the kingdom of Aquaria, where Adam, Elisa and The Crew waited them, there every single member of The Entourage and The Crew did something, Luka was with Adam and Elisa, telling them about Alyssa&#39;s kingdom, Karyu was speaking with Vrackie and Teach about the parties he had when he was in Alyssa&#39;s kingdom, Anija was reading alongside Celestia some of the books she bought and borrowed, Vaestro was with Whiskers, Avelia, Oliver and Ethel playing the same card game when they met, Oakmoss decided to get to know Hadad, Annie and their playful children, and lastly Astrid and Hilda were taking a much needed rest for the upcoming harem.<br />
<br />
Oakmoss was in a room specifically made for Hadad, Annie and their children, the teal-green dragoness got to know the two royal dragons, at first she expected Hadad to be a natural born cold-blooded brute, only caring for his Rider and his mate, but when Oakmoss got to know the azure leviathan, she was suprised to find out that Hadad was the complete opposite, he acted like a gentleman, being quiet when Annie gave Oakmoss advices and possible tricks when she was gonna give birth to Karyu&#39;s children, most of the time he would be outside a garden nearby with some of his children, telling them stories of adventures and fantasy, Oakmoss saw with her own eyes how some animals would stay near Hadad as he told his children the stories, while he did have a menacing look, he in reality was a gentle giant.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally since their teeth didn&#39;t fully develop, i highly advice taking small bites of any form of meat, chewing it a little and then force it in their mouths while you give them kisses!&quot; Said Annie, with a smile, as her children sleeped beside her.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-But what if they choke on it!?&quot; Protested Oakmoss with a worried voice, this made Annie giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s why you chew it silly!&quot; Replied Annie laughing, she and Oakmoss quickly became close friends, just like how Oakmoss quickly became friends with Ravenna, &quot;You did say things that only an experienced mother would know, so i&#39;d give you a.... Nine out of ten.&quot; said Annie, her voice being extremly calm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean i will be a great mother?&quot; Asked Oakmoss innocently, being replied with a quick nod from Annie, in response Oakmoss sighed in relief, eventually Hadad returned with his children who were all asleep, after taking all of them to their beds he returned to Annie and Oakmoss, who quickly remembered what Astrid and Hilda requested her to ask to Hadad, &quot;Oh by the way Hadad, Astrid and Hilda told me to ask you if you wanted to join a harem made out of both of them alongside Karyu.&quot; said Oakmoss with a smile as she looked at the blue leviathan, who seemed to be lost in thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm... I didn&#39;t mate with those two for a while now, and i never had a harem alongside a drake, is it just a harem of four?&quot; Asked Hadad as he gave an interested look at Oakmoss, who shook her head, &quot;I might join it also.&quot; replied Oakmoss, as she waited for Hadad&#39;s final answer, &quot;I might join it, but i need my love&#39;s authorization first.&quot; replied Hadad as he looked at Annie in a romantic way, entwining his tail with hers.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can join it sweetie, who knows, i might tag along.&quot; Said Annie as she gave Hadad a french kiss, by seeing this, Oakmoss&#39; mind started being filled with erotic desires for Karyu.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, since there&#39;s gonna be four hens and just two drakes, i&#39;ll go ask Teach and Vrackie if they would like to join, is there a problem with that?&quot; Asked Oakmoss, being replied by Hadad and Annie with a swift shake of their heads, &quot;Thank you for your advices Annie, see you both later.&quot; said Oakmoss as she left the room, searching for Teach, Karyu and Vrackie.<br />
<br />
Vrackie and Teach were still listening to Karyu&#39;s stories, both of them being fascineted and jealous about Alyssa&#39;s kingdom, the three dragons were speaking together while taking glasses of a high class whiskey, since alcohol didn&#39;t harm dragons, infact, they aided them with multiple things, for example making their flames much more powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tried a hookah for your first time?&quot; Asked Teach as he took a sip from a glass containing whiskey, &quot;Hoho! I tried them more times then i can remember!&quot; said Teach with a laugh, since both of their Riders are related, Teach and Karyu are very close, they act as if they were brothers, not brothers in blood, but brothers in arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m still interested in their magic capabilities, and also their mead.&quot; Said Vrackie, as shi licked hir lips, eventually Oakmoss arrived and saw the three dragons, &quot;What is it sweetie?&quot; asked Vrackie as shi looked at the teal-green dragoness.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanted to ask you three if you wanted to join a harem.&quot; Replied Oakmoss with a devilish smirk as she looked at the three dragons around her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already know i&#39;m joining.&quot; Said Karyu as he took a final sip from a glass containing whiskey, giving the same devilish smirk as Oakmoss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends, who&#39;s participating?&quot; Asked Vrackie with interest in hir voice, as shi inspected Oakmoss&#39; new feminine form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Annie, Astrid, Hilda, Hadad, me, Karyu.&quot; Replied Oakmoss, waiting for Vrackie&#39;s and Teach&#39;s answer, the two of them remained silent, still thinking about if they should join or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know what? I&#39;ll join as well, bearing some clutches and giving some clutches might be fun.&quot; Said Vrackie as shi gave hir wings a good stretch, &quot;What about you Teach?&quot; asked Vrackie as shi looked at the golden drake.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mate with a hen for quite a while, plus i have to admit that it feels quite good being rutted by drakes.&quot; Replied Teach with a honest voice, &quot;So i&#39;ll join you all.&quot; finished Teach as he also took a final sip from a glass containing whiskey.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect, a harem of eight, now i&#39;ll go wake up the two hens.&quot; Said Oakmoss as she went towards Astrid&#39;s and Hilda&#39;s room, both of them were asleep cuddling each other, it did look adorable, too bad she would have to ruin the cute sight, at first Oakmoss thought of a possible way to wake up the two hens without involving violence, she quickly got an idea, &quot;Alright. Astrid! Hilda! I thought you two wanted to have a harem!&quot; shouted Oakmoss, the two hens instantly woke up.<br />
<br />
&quot;They didn&#39;t start without us, right?&quot; Asked Hilda quickly with panicking voice, Oakmoss giggled as she shook her head, at this Hilda quickly gave a sigh of relief.<br />
<br />
Astrid, Hilda and Oakmoss went together towards the room where all of the dragons waited for them.</p>
