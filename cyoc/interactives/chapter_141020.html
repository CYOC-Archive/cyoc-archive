<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;And that is all for this morning,&quot; Professor Brahms concluded, shutting down the overhead projector. &quot;Now we&#39;ll break for lunch and meet back here in two hours. Enjoy!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally over,&quot; Lara groaned, stretching. She reached toward the ceiling in a grand display that allowed her shirt to ride up exposing her taught midriff. I couldn&#39;t help but admire her figure. We collected our papers and supplies and left the classroom. The campus was arranged in a large circle centralized around one building, Preble Hall, which housed multiple offices and the various student organizations. Most importanly it housed the Campus Dining Hall. As we proceeded to Preble Hall I noticed that an outcropping of the girls from class were following a fair distance behind, Su, Sophia, and Aubrey most notably walking side by side and seeming to be conversing amongst themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... Lara... we seem to have followers...&quot; I whispered. She offered a sly smirk taking care not to look behind us. We got our food in the cafeteria and took seats at an empty table. I noticed Su and Sophia both take seats in their own booth and watched as Aubrey originally headed to join them but then last minute made a B-line for Lara and I. The other two were taken by surprise, looking at their third with disdain and betrayal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I sit with you?&quot; Aubrey asked, flashing a toothless smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, there&#39;s plenty of room,&quot; Lara answered gleefully. Imagine my total lack of surprise when Aubrey then decided to sit on my side opposite of Lara. No longer in the dimmed lights of the classroom I got a better look at the blonde girl. She was cute but seemed to be something of a jewelry enthusiast. Her left ring finger was the only digit that held no adornment, her ears featured five or six piercings each, her nose featured a stud, and body chains seemed to dangle from every limb imagineable. Under her hair she wore a silver head band and on her neck hung several necklaces, including an ornate choker. She happily sat down, introducing herself to Lara with an overly friendly handshake. As she did, Sophia and Su both abandoned their seats and invited themselves over, sharing in the formalities that Aubrey had. Once they had all taken seats Lara began engaging in small talk. Su was from China though she had lived in the States for almost a decade, Sophia was a local girl who had attended private school before coming here, and Aubrey was from California. All seeemed pleasant and friendly and I was actually surprised by how well they all got along. <br />
<br />
&quot;So Jethro, tell us a bit about you,&quot; Aubrey asked, leaning her chin on her hand and paying me all the attention she could muster. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m local, raised here and attended high school not that far away,&quot; I began. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s where me met,&quot; Lara chimed in, gripping my arm in a cleavage drenched bear hug before planting a deep kiss on me. I felt my pants tighten as her tongue made my mouth its playground. I felt her hand cross my lap, taking Aubrey&#39;s wrist in her grasp and guiding it to my bulge. I could feel Aubrey tense up as she took in my measure. Lara finally pulled away, looking dreamily into my eyes. &quot;Best years ever,&quot; she whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, are you two... sleeping together?&quot; Su asked, suddenly looking very embarrassed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course we are. Is that a problem?&quot; Lara asked coyly. The three girls all began to look very uncomfortable and even shifted a bit as though deciding whether to follow their impulse to leave or try and steal me away from Lara. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry ladies, you can fuck him too,&quot; she smiled. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-what do you mean?&quot; Sophia stammered. &quot;We weren&#39;t trying to-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls, girls, please... I knew from the moment you sat down what you were trying to do. Every adult woman with a vagina wants a piece of my man. You three aren&#39;t the first and you most certainly won&#39;t be the last so let me clue you in on something: I know you were hoping to secure him for yourselves. Perhaps it was a matter of competition, or perhaps you were three musketeers on a mission for romance, either way I know your aims so let&#39;s not pretend this was some innocent social call.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, yeah, I wanted to fuck him. Still kinda do after you gave me that touch and tell,&quot; Aubrey admitted. <br />
<br />
&quot;I appreciate your honesty,&quot; Lara smiled. &quot;The truth is, Ladies, if you want to fuck him, you can.&quot; The table went dead silent for a few moments before Sofia regained her composure, filling up with a fiery Latina temper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please, you expect us to believe that? Where I come from you don&#39;t ever mess with another woman&#39;s man unless you&#39;re willing to spill blood over him,&quot; she huffed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here&#39;s the thing: we&#39;re not the jealous sorts. I&#39;ve already told him he can fuck whoever he wants. I won&#39;t care, hell I&#39;ll most likely sit and watch. Just make it good and make it worth it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; both Aubrey and Su asked. Lara nodded in affirmative, offering a wry smile. Again they remained silent, mulling over what was happening. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;ve got no problem with that,&quot; Aubrey smiled, reaching under the table to caress my manhood again. &quot;So long as I get to sample some of that impressive man meat...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I accept your offer, graciously,&quot; Su stammered, looking at all of us with unease but obvious desire. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, fuck this,&quot; Sophia stood up indignant. &quot;Jethro might be fine with being a man whore, and you all might be okay sharing but I&#39;m not looking for a series of one night stands. I&#39;m out,&quot; she said, turning to go in a huff. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is your pride really that great, or does the lack of competition make this proposition meaningless to you?&quot; Lara challenged. Sophia turned back, giving the succubus a puzzled look. &quot;When you were competing with Aubrey and Su, you were dead set on being here and claiming Jethro as your prize. Now that he&#39;s fair game, you lose interest. You like a challenge, is that it?&quot; Sophia didn&#39;t answer but simply turned and stared, as though shocked that Lara could know this about her. &quot;Here&#39;s the thing, bonita, you may not be competing with Su and Aubrey, but you are competing against a far greater enemy: the whole damn world.&quot; Everyone&#39;s eyes widened. <br />
<br />
&quot;You heard me right,&quot; Lara continued. &quot;It may start with just you three but I guarantee by the end of this year every girl, lady, and woman will be clawing over each other to get in his pants. What I&#39;m offering you now is a VIP membership... a backstage pass...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How so?&quot; Aubrey asked, intrigued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Think about it: Here&#39;s a whole Univeristy wanting to sleep with my man. He&#39;ll be very busy pegging girls left and right. Now imagine you have t privilege of getting priority, having the right to him anytime you want. Feeling lonely? Use him to feel loved. Depressed? Let him raise your spirits. Bored? Imagine having his dick whenever you want it. That&#39;s the offer I&#39;m giving you here. You walk away from this table, that offer goes with you. Still too good for it?&quot; Lara smiled. <br />
<br />
Sophia seemed to consider her offer before walking hesitantly towards us. Apparently in her mind having the option to fuck me was better than nothing at all. Slowly she sat down and sat silent. &quot;Good choice,&quot; Lara cooed. &quot;Jethro is in room 312, I&#39;m ususally there as well. Swing by anytime you all are in the mood. Jethro, let&#39;s go,&quot; she called. We stood up and grabbed our dishes, turning to leave. &quot;Oh, and Ladies, welcome... to the Succubus Club,&quot; Lara smiled.</p>
