<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Miami sat in her living room, naked, having tried everything under the sun with Kyle&#39;s body with her co star and wife. She sat with legs kicked up, her wife had gone out for a spa day, Miami had stayed behind, she hadn&#39;t let on but she was very upset at the loss of her buxom body. Still, she had enjoyed and would continue to enjoy the pleasure of being the opposite sex. But she still was bitter, and she had an idea to settle her bitterness and get even with the boy who stole her body. She made a phone call to the doctor who would do the operation next week.<br />
<br />
“Hi doc, this is Miami... yes, that did happen.... no, I&#39;m not canceling that operation, the kid who got my body is getting it instead. Yeah, he&#39;s a lucky boy, say, listen, do you remember what I was talking about doing before, the whole shibang? Yeah, the whole nine yards, bigger than we settled on, with the whole... support thing? Yes, I&#39;d like to give that to him. Yes I aware. I know he won&#39;t be able to bend over again. Then give him the mechanical stuff. Yes. And the whole support bra, girdle thing. I&#39;ve got the money and then some. Oh his mom is on board for it. Yeah, punishment for stealing my body. Good. Then it&#39;s settled.” Miami smiled, now a little happier. “Good. Say doc? Are you still doing those... genital transplant experiments? Yeah, it&#39;s a little too small for my liking. I was thinking bigger, like much bigger. Yeah, no, more like a horse. Yes, a horse.” <br />
<br />
Kyle spent the rest of the week leading up to the surgeries being groped and flirted with, his every day being a confusing, uncomfortable and arousing thing. He had gotten used to the gargantuan bust he now possessed. Miami&#39;s body didn&#39;t try to remove him, it would from time to time do sexy things to turn him on, shaking her breasts, pulling off her top in class, in the shower she would take over and edge him, bringing him to almost climax and leaving him wanting, and keeping him from finishing. By the time he got full control he was at the hospital, they prepped him, not really informing him of the changes in his surgeries. <br />
<br />
He as he was put under he caught a glimpse of the implants, they looked a little larger than he thought they would. Kyle woke some time later, laying on his back and feeling a tremendous weight on his chest, far heavier than he had come in with, he opened his eyes and didn&#39;t even need to look down to see why. Still looking up at the ceiling he saw the top portion of his epic breasts, he looked down and let out a scream of shock, there on his chest were two massive spheres, the giant beach ball orbs seemingly kept together by some invisible force. Kyle tried to sit up, his back stayed ram rod straight as he heard a hum coming from somewhere, he flapped his arms wildly as he felt like he&#39;d fall back, the weight shifted forward, but the breasts stayed in place. <br />
<br />
Kyle stared at the sight of a permanent shelf of breast flesh sitting in front of him, the orbs taking up the available space in front of him. He tried to wrap his arms around the beach ball sized tits, unable to even get close to half way, he slide his legs out of the bed and stood up, nearly falling forward he felt his stiff back straighten involuntarily, his feet refused to completely flatten on the ground, forced to stand on his tip toes, he struggled to try and put them down, he turned, hearing a light click as he move one of his feet. The door opened and a doctor came in, he looked like a mad scientist.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Mr. Perkins, good, you&#39;re able to stand up I see, the supports are working. Here, let&#39;s get you a good look.” The doctor brought in a large mirror and Kyle whimpered, in the mirror his reflection showed that Miami had far more than just 20k implants put in him. The first and most obvious things he saw were his beach ball sized breasts, they sat unnaturally round and supported by something. “The form fitting under the skin bra is holding I see, you&#39;ll never sag with that, but seeing those monsters in you, I don&#39;t think 50k implants would sag to begin with.”<br />
<br />
Kyle continued to pan downward, his waist was thinner than before, it looked to be held by a corset. “And the internal support system is working, you may not be able to bend anymore, but you&#39;ll never fall forward, the gyroscopes will keep you steady.” As he looked down at his feet he saw why he couldn&#39;t put them down, they seemed to have been put in a permanent tip toe position, unnaturally forcing him to stand in that position. “The steel implants took well as well, you won&#39;t have any problems with standing in those stilettos, shame you won&#39;t be able to flatten them again.”<br />
<br />
“Why?” Kyle whimpred, the only thing he could say. “Because Miami said you&#39;d want it, she&#39;s getting a procedure too.” They both heard Kyle&#39;s old voice scream from down the hall. “Ah, that would be her, she said she wanted a larger cock, the biggest we could give her.” She was heard cussing and screaming for the doctor. “I think she&#39;ll enjoy the elephant cock more than the horse cock don&#39;t you?” The doctor quickly left as Kyle stared at the “improvements” to his body, Miami had her revenge, and Kyle would have to live with it.</p>
