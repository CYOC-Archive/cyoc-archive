<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">BACKTRACKING...<br />
As she entered her home, Zylina heard the one sentence she dreaded more than any other.<br />
&quot;Why are you late young lady?&quot; her mother demanded to know, while getting up from the living room sofa.<br />
&quot;Mrs. Johnson asked for my help with some stuff after school. It didn&#39;t take that long and I figured you wouldn&#39;t mind. I did get a note from her,&quot; said Zylina, while handing her mother a piece of paper.<br />
She read it, and then said, &quot;Okay, but you should of called.&quot;<br />
&quot;On the way home, yes, you&#39;re right. But there wasn&#39;t time during the class or afterward.&quot;<br />
&quot;I know it sounds at times like we&#39;re really overbearing, but your father and I just want to make sure you&#39;re safe. Someone could try getting to you or me to hurt him in regards to his business with the Luna Brotherhood,&quot; her mother pointed out.<br />
&quot;I know, but I&#39;m 16 and one ferocious she-wolf when need be,&quot; Zylina reminded her. &quot;By the way, where is dad?&quot;<br />
&quot;Gone since right after you left for school. Something about the Seattle chapter of the Brotherhood doing something really boneheaded and he&#39;s coordinating with the Mount Rainer chapter to make it right. You know your father. The less we know, the less we&#39;re in danger.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, right now I know I&#39;m gonna fix myself a snack and then go to my room to finish my homework so I have the weekend free,&quot; said Zylina, before heading to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Upstairs, one baloney sandwich and a can of soda later...<br />
<i>Even for weres, the teenage years can be a difficult time. Still trying to figure out who we are and who we will be,</i> Mrs. Johnson said, starting a private one on one chat with Zylina after the rest of the class left for the weekend.<br />
<i>I know. But my heart says he&#39;s the one,</i> Zylina recalled telling her, thinking about Nate Anderson. <i>The problem is that the most I&#39;ve had the courage to do so far is just leave anonymous love notes in his locker and I just discovered this afternoon he&#39;s seeing someone.</i><br />
<i>So this boy doesn&#39;t know who you are?</i> asked the teacher, to which Zylina just shook her head negatively. <i>Well, I&#39;m treading in dangerous territory here for both a teacher and a non-parental adult, but as one woman to another, until you actually introduce yourself and this boy realizes who you are, you&#39;ll never know for sure how he might feel about you. I can tell you that first love doesn&#39;t mean only love. I had several beaus throughout my teen and young adult years myself before I finally met my mate after graduating college. Now we&#39;re happy, fully in love, and spending the rest of our furry lives together.</i><br />
<br />
Alone in her room, the she-wolf was sitting on her bed staring at a candid picture of the boy she loved taken by her cellphone. Homework and clothing completely discarded as she laid there in her fursona, mooning over Nate Anderson.<br />
<i>Sooner or later you&#39;re going to wonder who I am and call the number on the note I left you today. And when I finally get the chance, I&#39;m going to fuck your brains out till you forget every female in existence, were or normal, except me!</i> vowed Zylina, as one paw started teasing her nether regions while the other continued to hold her cell.<br />
<br />
LATER THAT EVENING...<br />
They had cut their meal short and returned to her place, but as Nate Anderson and his date Jean Talbot walked back toward her house, he stopped and grabbed her hand.<br />
&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; he asked, looking deeply into her eyes.<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, moving closer to him.<br />
&quot;I want to try something,&quot; announced Nate, before leading Jean into the open woods behind the Talbot Restoration Garage.<br />
There, Jean smiled as Nate was hastily taking off all his clothes, including his heavy winter coat.<br />
Soon a tall and muscular werewolf was now standing where a normal male teenager was, but Jean wasn&#39;t far behind him. Nate smiled as her naked body started growing fur as the classic striped pattern of a were-tigress appeared.<br />
&quot;As much as I love sex with someone special, I prefer it in more comfortable surroundings,&quot; said Jean, even as she moved her paws to start caressing Nate&#39;s lupine red rocket, which was already standing proudly out of its sheath.<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; he agreed, &quot;and we&#39;ll get to that,&quot; he added, stroking the pleasurable opening between her furry legs, &quot;but that&#39;s not what I wanted to try first. Now please spread your arms and legs,&quot; Nate requested, to which Jean complied. &quot;Now go limp.&quot;<br />
<br />
A moment later Jean felt herself falling backwards into the snow that had been accumulating all day.<br />
&quot;Now move your arms and legs around,&quot; instructed Nate, as Jean realized what she was doing.<br />
&quot;You want me to make a snow angel?&quot;<br />
&quot;Actually, I&#39;m trying to see if there&#39;s such a thing as a were-snow angel,&quot; explained Nate, as he reached out to help Jean up.<br />
Soon the two lovers embraced as they looked down at her creation.<br />
&quot;DANG! Except for the height and the occasional hint of your tail, it looks like a normal snow angel,&quot; complained Nate.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s missing something,&quot; realized Jean, looking at the indention in the snow.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; wondered Nate.<br />
&quot;It&#39;s mate,&quot; she answered, before pushing Nate down in the snow next to where she was.<br />
Nate smiled as he laid there making a companion angel. &quot;We used to do this all the time back in Minnesota, but it is definitely a lot more fun doing this as a were. I can feel the cold, yet it doesn&#39;t bother this werewolf.&quot;<br />
&quot;Not being any kind of a snow cat, I don&#39;t want to stay out here all night, but you should see the look on your muzzle. Very blissful,&quot; said Jean, smiling down on him.<br />
<br />
That one word reminded Nate of the note he found in his locker that afternoon from whoever his secret admirer was.<br />
WHILE YOU MAY THINK YOU&#39;RE HAPPY WITH HER, YOU WILL NEVER KNOW TRUE BLISS UNTIL YOU&#39;VE BEEN WITH ME! CALL ME IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER WHAT YOU&#39;RE MISSING!<br />
the note said, including a phone number.<br />
And the scent of whoever left it was that of a she-wolf.<br />
<br />
Nate stopped moving and raised his hand, indicating he wanted help getting up out of the snow.<br />
Jean reached out to assist, but instead the werewolf found his weretigress laying on top of him, kissing every part of his upper body she could reach even as Jean deftly moved a paw between their legs to guide his hard cock into her more than eager vagina.<br />
Soon Jean was happily driving his penis deeper into her body, even as its top knot penetrated her cunt. Nate held on to her hips to help him thrust harder while he licked and suckled on her breasts.<br />
It wasn&#39;t long before the couple experienced a wonderful and mutual orgasm together.<br />
Laying there in the snow, Jean could still feel the muscles flexing his cock within her. It would be at least a few minutes before the penis softened enough to let the top knot slip out again.<br />
&quot;Now THAT&#39;S how you make a snow angel, Moon Lake style,&quot; said Jean, while embracing her lover and kissing him.<br />
&quot;Definitely has my way beat by a good country mile,&quot; agreed Nate, smiling at her while his paws caressed her furry curves.<br />
<br />
They smiled at each other before starting to kiss again.<br />
But even as feline muzzle interacted with its lupine counterpart, one thought was running through Jean&#39;s mind.<br />
<i>If you don&#39;t do it when you turn 18 Mister Anderson, I&#39;LL propose to you the day you graduate high school!</i></p>
