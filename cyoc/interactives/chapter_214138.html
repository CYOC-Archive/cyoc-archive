<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was only a day later that another problem came to a head. Bry was constantly cranky and with red cheeks, her crying also caused the other infants to wake and the household, not just Jasper, had difficulty sleeping. Betsy diagnosed the girl as teething and suggested the baby be taken to the doctor and get her gums lanced. Jasper, despite pretending to be a wet nurse and knowledgeable about babies, knew no better.<br />
<br />
Fortunately for Bry, Patricia objected saying ‘Lancing a babies gum’s is barbaric. I would not have you do the same to Pyotr when he comes to tooth. I have a colleague who is an expert on the ails of babies. Visit her and I am certain she will provide you with a remedy’ <br />
<br />
Patricia’s colleague, lived near a small village, an hour’s walk from the town walls. Jasper pumped enough milk for Penelope to feed the babies and set off alone first thing in the morning. She wore her wet nurse uniform, as the road was dusty and she knew better than to be seen walking the roads in either of her “Lady Jasmine” outfits. Besides the robes of the uniform did not accentuate her voluptuous figure like the ladies gowns and there were still warnings that travelling the countryside was not yet totally safe.<br />
<br />
In hindsight Jasper should have asked Damon to accompany her, however perhaps because she was overtired, this was not the case. The young woman, who had formerly been a prince, cleared the city gate and followed the directions provided by Patricia.<br />
<br />
Patricia’s directions were sound and the journey peaceful. An hour later Jasper knocked on the door of a small cabin. The cabin was not in the village but in a small forest to its north. The door was opened by a middle aged woman with strikingly blonde hair.<br />
<br />
‘I know you not. You are not a lass from the village. Why do you disturb my peace and quiet?’<br />
<br />
‘My name is Jasmine and I am wet nurse for Mistress Patricia Muscat of Vingery, she recommended I visit you for advice’<br />
<br />
‘I know Patricia, she is distant kin. What is this advice you seek?’<br />
<br />
‘My babe has teething issues and allows no-one in our household sleep. My Mistress suggested you may know of a remedy’<br />
<br />
‘That is a simple issue. Wait here and I will provide you with a cream’<br />
<br />
The witch (that is what she clearly was) disappeared back into her cabin. A minute later she returned and handed Jasper a small tub of cream. ‘When the babies cheeks turn red, rub this on her gums. The ingredients take a long time to gather and prepare so I must charge you. The cost is 10 pence’<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Patricia had forewarned Jasper that payment would be necessary and she carried money in a small purse attached to her wrist. She paid the witch and departed. <br />
<br />
Jasper’s walk home was not so peaceful. Half way back to the city when the walls were barely miles away, the road passed through a small copse. Suddenly a man was standing in front of her, an unshaven man in filthy clothes. He had a peg leg. <br />
<br />
‘Why hello young Miss’ Jasper stopped and looked up at the man. A mistake. ‘My aren’t you a pretty little thing. What say you stop and let me and my brother get to know you better?’ Jasper heard a laugh behind her. Another man equally dirty with only one eye was standing behind her.<br />
<br />
‘I will be on my way’ <br />
<br />
‘Not until you stop and allow us to provide you with some hospitality’ The first man had approached Jasper and grabbed at the purse hanging from her wrist. <br />
<br />
‘You may have the purse, there is little in it, but let me pass. My Master is expecting me soon and he is a powerful man’ Jasper removed the purse and let the man have it. He peered inside.<br />
<br />
‘This is not sufficient toll. However I suggest you have something else worth the price of passage’ Jasper felt herself been grabbed from behind by the one eyed man. He lifted her and easily carried her, despite her kicking and screaming, down a small side path that Jasper had failed to notice. <br />
<br />
Desperately Jasper reached into her blouse and felt for the silver locket hidden there. Using her practiced skill, she removed the locket from around the amulet Anya had given her. She then called out ‘Protect Me!’<br />
<br />
Jasper found herself falling to the ground and cracked her head on a root. She was momentarily dazed, but had enough awareness to remember there were two bandits. She looked for the one legged man. He was no more. Behind her on the trail were two infants, lying in piles of filthy rags. They looked tiny and Jasper was reminded of how much Bry, Pyotr and Brook had grown since she had become their carer. <br />
<br />
Jasper examined the twin baby girls. They were not identical one had brown hair and one was bald. The two bandits had become innocent babies. They were a threat to no-one any more. Jasper removed them from their rag entanglement and put one to each breast. The babies instinctively began to suckle. The newborns did not suckle quickly or for long but took enough of Jasper’s milk so that her breasts no longer ached. It was a relief.<br />
<br />
Jasper could not just leave the babies where she was or they would surely die. She removed a petticoat and used it to make a sling large enough so the two now sleeping infants could snuggle against her soft breasts. <br />
<br />
She then found the silver locket and replaced it once more around the amulet Anya had gifted her. In her mind Jasper thanked Anya for her foresight and realised she should try to get word to her former concubine and let her know she was safe and was arranging her passage to Wind’s Grove.<br />
<br />
The babies seemed so small and tiny and Jasper had no difficulty carrying them for the last several miles back into town. The guards on the gate did not question why the wet nurse had two infants with her when she returned. However, Jasper knew that before she arrived at the house, she needed to think up a suitable explanation.</p>
