<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you look around the room, you see various groups begin to form into single male harems. However, you didn&#39;t want to just join an existing harem, you wanted to be the first girl in your master&#39;s harem. The thought of your new master fucking you made your pussy soaked. <br />
<br />
But who would be the lucky man to have you as his first bitch? It was entirely up to you. But the more you look around, the less hope you have for finding an unclaimed male. <br />
<br />
It was then that you remembered something. While they were not exactly &quot;male&quot;, they were very dominating, something you now found extremely exciting. You also were confident they were not taken. Giggling happily, you rush back to where you awoke. And it was there that you found them.<br />
<br />
Right where you had left them. The tendril which had spanked you. You ran over and embraced the tendril between your tits, sticking the tip into your now excessivly dripping pussy. <br />
<br />
The tendril apparently didn&#39;t expect this outcome as for a moment it stopped moving entirely, shocked at suddenly being titty fucked and mounted by one of the new girls. However, it quickly accepted the girl&#39;s decision and began throughly pleasuring her. And soon, the Tendril began splitting off into more and more tendril, wrapping around various parts of the girl. <br />
<br />
She is currently ecstatic. Just knowing that the Tendril has accepted her has sent numerous chills throughout her body, each of which only brought more and more pleasure. She fully understood down to her core that from now on, she belonged to this creature. Whatever it wanted to do to her, she would never stop it. She was it&#39;s toy, its mate, even its fuck doll if need be. Her existence is now tied to its, metaphorically speaking. Sow with that she fully surrendered herself to her new master. An action which the Tendril would not miss.<br />
<br />
The now many tendrils which branched off of the main tendril began to wrap themselves around their new pet&#39;s limbs, quickly binding her arms so that she was holding them straight downwards behind her back. It then removed itself from between her mammoth sized tits, and worked its way down, through her legs, and up her back, while never for a moment leaving her pussy. Once it was in place, it shoved itself up tight against her back, following her spine and covering her arms entirely. Using a few of its new tendrils to secure itself in place by tightly wrapping them around her upper arms and shoulders. If you were to look at the new girl from the front, you would believe she didn&#39;t have arms. <br />
<br />
Next, the main tendril produced a very special, unique tendril which it pierced her back with, affixing itself to her spine. It happened so fast that the new girl never even had the chance to feel pain, because once it was attached, it healed her back entirely qnd tampered with her nervous system, removing any pain was causing her. This special tendril acted as a bridge, connecting the two of them. Forming a mutually benificial relationship between them in a similar way a symbiotic organism has with its host. <br />
<br />
Being magically summoned, the Tendril needs some kind of source to tie its existance to this dimension. Usually that would be the summoner&#39;s magic power. But now that it could directly tap into the lifeforce of a host, it went for the far better offer, abandoning its summoner. For one, the Tendril would never sap their host&#39;s lifeforce dry, because it would mean their death too. Actually, often the opposite occured. Since the Tendril works to maintain the helth of their host, it is common for that creature to live way longer than what is normal for their species. A human with an average life of 80 years could easily ve made to live well into their 1000s, some even have lasted until their late 2000s. So the new girl&#39;s likelyhood of reaching a very old age was actually even more ensured in her current predicament than before.<br />
<br />
The reason why more people didnt do this though, was because it was a permanent commitment. Once attached, nothing, not even magic could remove the tendril. And in addition, the Tendril will always remove the arms, and block the primary sexual organ, of their host. Their host will only be able to recieve pleasure from their Tendril, which will use this to control their host&#39;s actions, training them. <br />
<br />
The connection between the two allows for the host to use a pair of 2 larger, branch tendrils which rest where once their own arms were, as replacements. However, the Tendril can assume control at any time. Further training their host.<br />
<br />
All this training ends in their host becomming a flawless dominatrix who is only submissive to her own Tendril. The contrast in personalities is actually surprising to witness. The host will only wear the tendril, using the many branching tendrils to mimic the appearance of clothing, almost always something either leather, latex, or the like. Never covering the breasts or nipples, but containing them in a way that not only creates significant cleavage and pushes them up, but makes it seem like her tits are naturally shaped in the most attractive way possible. This is partly done to complete the image, but also to serve a special function. <br />
<br />
All hosts find that once they bond with their tendril, they begin lactating immensly. So much so that they often need to be routinely milked in order to releave the pressure. So the Tendrils adjust their tits to have their swollen nipples pointed directly forward. And when they feel like it, they will squees the sides of their host&#39;s tits, shooting out 2 thick streams of milk. The milk streams can accuratly be shot out to reach a target over 10 meters away with minimal spray. The host does not feel any pain, but rather a great deal of pleasure from being used like a high pressure squirt gun. The milk wont harm what it hits, but, it will leave a red mark if were to hit someone while within an arms distance of the host&#39;s nipples.<br />
<br />
The Tendril also shapes 2 of its branches around the host&#39;s feet, permanently turning their feet into a pair of 9&quot; ballet style heels. The Host will not be harmed by this, but will be trained to move in every way possible, to the point the can&#39;t physically bend their ankles forward anymore. Solidifying the joint entriely, making their calf and foot bones merge with eachother creating one solid bone from their knee to their toes. Forcing them to never be able to walk or stand without being on the very tips of their toes.<br />
<br />
The girl would have control over the various small tendrils branching off of her. But only when focusing on moving them. If she was not, they would be controlled by the Main Tendril. Reguardless of who was in control though, she would still feel everything. They were a part of her now. She even could will more to grow out of her Main Tendril if she wanted/needed them. And when she no longer had a use at the moment, the excess would twist together forming a long tail, which would smooth out and match her hair color completely.<br />
<br />
Lastly the Tendril reworks their digestive system, removing the creation of solid waste, closing up their host&#39;s intestins a bit before they reach the anus, while leaving that last bit left attached to their asshole as a protective pocket to store the Tendral&#39;s core in. This core is now what keeps both beings alive. Even if the girl&#39;s head is removed or her heart is pierced, she will not die as long as the core is not damaged as well, and then, will slowly regenerate her damaged body parts over time.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the girl, who has been experiencing a non-stop orgasim for the last several minutes, finally calms down. She realizes that while she cannot hear any voice speaking to her from her master, she instinctively knows exactly what her Master wants her to do. It is like her body understands any thoughts her master has, and instinctivly acts upon it whenever a new order is issued. She noticed her body change to its new form, and watched as the various tendrils change colors to either black or her own skin color, and then flatten down into place, making her new perminent outfit, though to her, it felt like she was fully naked, and that her tendril made clothes were similar to her own skin, which is exactly what was the case. It was definitely going to take some getting use to, and especially with her high heeled legs and 4 tendrils for arms. <br />
<br />
Finally, a thought entered her mind, one which she knew was not her own, but came from her master. Her name would be Karii from now on. She would now only be permitted to introduce herself as Karii, her loving master&#39;s loyal, obedient, and horny pet. All was to be said while taking extreme pride in the position. Karii also noticed that she started to feel vastly superior to everyone else in the room. She was the only one to choose the Tendril, and she alone belonged to her master. She was the only one with a single, unshared partner. Her mind slowly was beginning to become more suited for her soon to come personality shift into a flawless dominatrix. It would be more than simply role playing for her. It would be her default persona, which would never change except for one situation. That is, whenever she conversed with her master, she would slip into complete blissful submissiveness. Overjoyed to recieve any reward or punishment from her master.</p>
