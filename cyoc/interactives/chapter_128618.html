<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With Julia now dressed and Cole somewhat calmer they, along with Kumiko, decided to sit down with Claudia and Mika to talk. Katie and Kellie decided it would be best to return to the backyard to tan. This was a family issue they needed to work out amongst themselves. As the two teens lay out outside they could hear the adults talking rather loudly at the two girls.<br />
<br />
“Geez I’m really feeling bad for Mika and Claudia over there,” Katie said. Kellie nodded in agreement as they could once again Coles booming voice once again chastising his little sister and her girlfriend. “Yeah they are definitely not happy.”<br />
<br />
Turning to look at her girlfriend Kellie could see Katie sadly looking back at the house. “Hey Kat do me a favor, take the ring off I think we’ve had enough craziness for one day.” Katie blushed softly and nodded. After watching their friends transform into teenage mothers, complete with slowly regressing family members, the last thing they needed was more shenanigans with the ring. Placing the ring on a table Katie now looked at her girlfriend. “Sooo I was wondering,” she asked softly. “Your a virgin too right? I mean....I know I am...and you would of said something if....” Kellie smiled shyly as Katie trailed off, neither one had ever really considered taking their relationship to the level. “Yeah um...I’m still a virgin. To be honest I really hadn’t thought about....you know....that.”<br />
<br />
Katie nodded solemnly. She wasn’t naive, she understood that their were kids at her school that were sexually active. While the thought intrigued her it also frightened her. She wondered if she was being childish thinking this and now looked at Kellie hoping to have her questions answered. “Um Kel,” she started. “Have you ever thought about...you know...you and me....um..well...like..doing it.”<br />
<br />
Kellie flushed bright red as she stared at Katie. To be honest she, like Katie, had thought about Katie and her being intimate. She knew that she didn’t want to sleep with a guy but Katie...that was something completely different. Clearing her throat she looked shyly at her friend. “Ummm,” She stammered. “I..Uh..I..have thought about us doing it. I know I’m gay and would only want to be with a girl. The thing is....I’m kinda scared about, Well, going their. I don’t even know how we would um...technically..um...do it.”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled stifling a small giggle. “Yeah they never really covered that in sex Ed,” she giggled. “I mean..I don’t know, I’m scared too of doing it. I guess...if it still scares us..we probably shouldn’t go there. Am I making sense?”<br />
<br />
Kellie smiled warmly as she placed a tender kiss on Katie’s lips. “That’s probably the most mature and intelligent answer I’ve ever heard,” she said. “I’m...I’m in no rush and I guess your not either so why freak ourselves out. Besides I’m happy just being with you and I know I’m not going anywhere.”<br />
<br />
“Me either,” Katie sighed as she grabbed Kellies hand. “And yeah I’m not going anywhere either.”<br />
<br />
As the two teens looked at each other lovingly they could hear the backdoor open. Turning they saw Kumiko and Cole exit, both looking tired. “How’s everything in their,” they asked the two adults with concern.<br />
<br />
“Well fortunately Claudia and Mika understand that it was a bad decision,” Cole sighed as he wiped his brow. “Still kinda freaking me out thinking chipmunk actually did that.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah This has kinda thrown me for a loop too Cole,” Kumiko sighed. “Guess it’s a good thing my wish went a little wonky.”<br />
<br />
Cole now tuned to his girlfriend with a smile. “You know that reminds me what the hell possessed you to do that.”<br />
<br />
“Ugh it’s stupid I...I..found a grey hair this morning. It bugged me out.” Cole now looked at his sheepish girlfriend, desperately trying to hold back a laugh. “A grey hair that’s it,” he laughed. Kumiko furrowed her brow as she angrily gazed at Cole. “Yeah Cole a grey hair,” she grumbled. “I don’t see why that should be funny.”<br />
<br />
Cole shook his head as he now held up his hands. “Okay, Okay I’m sorry,” she chortled. “But since were being honest I’ll let you in on a secret. The reason I shave my head is because....well...I’m bald.”<br />
<br />
Kumikos eyes went wide as she stared at the strapping man in front of her. “Your bald!!!!”<br />
<br />
Now it was Coles turn to frown as he looked at his girlfriend. “Yeah I’m bald,” he mumbled. “If I grew my hair back I’d look like Captain Picard from Star Trek....it’s...it’s kinda embarrassing. So I would kill for grey hair thank you very much.”<br />
<br />
Kumiko smiled sheepishly as she stood on tiptoe to gently kiss Coles cheek. “I’m sorry hon,” she apologized. “I promise, no bald jokes.”<br />
<br />
Cole smiled shyly now as he picked Kumiko up in a hug. “Thanks Kumi,” he whispered as he kissed her gently.<br />
<br />
The sound of the door opening again brought the four to attention as Mika, Julia, and Claudia now came out to the backyard. “Well,” Julia sighed. “I think I can safely say these two will NEVER do something that stupid again.” Mika and Claudia nodded sheepishly as they now approached their friends. Neither girl made eye contact as they sat down next to Katie and Kellie.<br />
<br />
“Listen Cole, Kumiko,” Julia asked. “I know this is a big deal but these two I think understand that they messed up. Can we please not tell the folks?”<br />
<br />
“Hell no Im not telling dad,” Cole exclaimed. “He would kill ME for telling him before he killed Claudia.”<br />
<br />
“Mika,” Kumiko added. “This...this is between us right here. I’m not telling your parents but you are definitely going to have to make this up to me.” Both girls nodded sheepishly as they now gazed at their families. “So me and Mika,” Claudia asked. The adults sighed as they looked at each other. “Look,” Kumiko said. “I...I’m not exactly thrilled you two did what you did but I’m not going to forbid you two from seeing each other. You obviously know you messed up soooo what would be the point except being cruel.”<br />
<br />
Claudia and Mika sighed as they looked at each other. Thanking them they now looked at their friends, who gave them looks of concern. “Sooo,” Mika asked. “Can we just pretend this never happened and just layout on the sun?”<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she now spread out a beach towel. “Already forgotten,” she said. Smiling for the first time since all of this started Mika laid out to sun herself as her girlfriend lazily laid down next to her girlfriend.</p>
