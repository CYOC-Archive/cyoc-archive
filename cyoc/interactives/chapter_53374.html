<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The gates open exactly at 8 am and the group of guys runs through to the big brown leather doors. Charlie looks at the design of the doors and notices they look an awful lot like a giant football, they are a giant football! The whole door is the skin of a giant football!Amazed he continues to walk inside as they close behind him. &quot;MAn I can't wait to see all the crap they got in here!&quot; says the defensive lineman as he puts his buddy into a head lock and starts squeezing. &quot;You rich, do you have to always be so ruff with me? I hate it when you dominate!&quot; said his buddy dan. Dan was 5'11, not even close too riches 6' 9&quot; inch male muscle god. &quot;You'll do as I say ass knocker or I'll beat you down an inch!&quot; And with those last words they stood there with the rest as the head guy walks into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Evening gentleman!&quot; Says a guy in a coaching uniform, &quot;Ready to begin the tour of the factory?&quot; They all just stand there in amazment as they look about and see everything there is football oriented! The entire cavernous room is complete dedicated too football, right down the astro turf there walking on! As they follow the man into the first room the lineman looks at charlie and says &quot;You won? How did a dipwad like you ever win?! They must have felt sorry for how small and poor you dumb ass is!&quot; Charlie just shrugged is shoulder as the big man laughed, and everyone began too look around. They stood in a room full of tackle gear and weight gaining equipment. Everything was oriented towards defense and all the equipment there said so too! &quot;Man this is my kind of place!&quot; Shouted the lineman as he began to grab a football of the rack, and tossed it to his buddy dan. Dan caught it with a loud grunt, and dropped the ball shaking his hands at the power rich had. &quot;Hahaha! Pussy!&quot; rich giggled as he began too look at the tackle dummies while the tour guide began talking about the room. &quot;Everything here is dedicated to defensive moves, and practice drills and the like&quot; He said motioning toward where the lineman was, then stoppped and grinned as rich picked up some kind of rubber hose. <br />
<br />
&quot;What's this for, there's nothing in here that needs this?&quot; He said while holding the tube in his thick hands. &quot;Well yes there is, but it's for human interaction, you stick it into your belly button and it automatically begins to inject a substance that tranforms the person into a tougher player.&quot; As soon as rich heard that he grabbed some football gear and quick put it on! &quot;What are you doing rich?&quot; Said dan as rich quick slapped on the helmet, lifted the shirt and shoved the tube right in! &quot;I'm gonna dominate the filed now, aint nobody gonna get in my way! And you you punk ass, your gonna take my first practice!&quot; As he said this he pushed dan down with a mighty shove and laughed as dan fell to the turf and looked up, eyes welting up with tears. But soon the tears became a glee as rich starting feeling really funny.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's happening to me?&quot; said rich bewildered as the tube began to do it's work, shooting the chemical into him. &quot;WHy it's shooting you with air and stuffing, I tried to warn you...&quot; The guide said as both the group and dan watched him inflate. His skin started changing into a grey color as his mid section began to inflate. Dan just looked at him and smiled, saying &quot;I get to have my fun now after all these years!&quot; Rich began to talk, but could only make a grimacing smile on his face as the interaction began too take full force! Slowly his feet and calves began to flattening out, cleats and all as the chemical spread affecting him more and more. Dan laughed hysterically as he saw what rich was becoming. &quot;I think I'm gonna have a good time with you rich!&quot; He said as the group listened to the guy explain the it wasn't meant for people yet because the turn into tackle dummies, at which point he pointed the hundred dummies lined up in rows getting beat down on. &quot;And to thin rich your gonna be all mine!&quot; Rich heard this and tried to move but just rocked there, his feet and calves now one rounded out bottom. His mid section was now a singularity as the effect spread, his arms moving down into the tackling positon as the melted into his side becoming nothing more than an imprint, a picture on a vinyl body.<br />
<br />
AS the tranformation began too slow down the guide said to dan &quot;These effects will become permenant if he's not taking to the next room to change back in one hour?&quot; Dan just smiled and said &quot;I think I can deal with that! I got the perfect place on the football field at home for him to be practiced on!&quot; And gleamed a wicked smile as the change slowly creeped up riches neck. Horrified rich just bearly hissed &quot;Whhhhyyyyy arrreee yooouuuu dooiiinnngg thissssss&quot; And then dan walked over to him and grabbe what was left of his chin and said &quot;BEcause of all the year you tormented me and others, for the players you made into bums because you hit them so hard they played ball again! For all the people you made fell so low they killed themselves! That's why!&quot; As he said this riche's grimaced face cocked a little and his eyes looked shocked under the black paint underneath them began to form. Then with a slight hissing sound his grilled face and helemt became one cingularity, his eyes glazing over as dan gave him a smack and he completed his new form. HE smacked again the ground, the turf hitting the back of his new tackle dummie head. He then rocked back hitting forward as all of them saw his face looking on, nothing more than a picture on material, ruff meterial that was perfect for defense. &quot;Well did you want to keep your friend here, or take him home to use on the field?&quot; The tour guide asked, half hoping he would say here. &quot;Nah! I like my new toy! I'll take to my back yard and then to the equipment shed so it can be beat on plenty!&quot; Dan said this and rubbed his hands as the rest of the group looked on shaking there heads. &quot;Well then if you want to follow us for the rest of the tour, well take your life sized tackle dummy and deflate it and ship it back to your place to get refilled and ready! Are you sure this is what you want? After and hour he'll forever be nothing more than a tackle dummy?&quot; AS the guide said this the other dummies that were standing still all began to gently rock back and forth as if there was a wind, but there wasn't. Nah! He'll be fine!&quot; And dan walked away with the rest of the tour. Rich just rocked there, a 6&quot; 10&quot; tackle dummy.</p>
