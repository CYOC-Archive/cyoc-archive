<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Fixed a typo soon after posting originally.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting back in his chair and closing his eyes as the erotic bliss of the blowjob dissipated Dave couldn’t think of anything else accept the feelings of power and control he had over Janet now in order to force her to do anything he wanted. Sure it was great what he had thought up but something was missing from the equation and he just couldn’t put his finger on it. Janet was just kneeling forward in place with her panting lips slightly open having swallowed hungrily all of Dave’s sperm in multiple gulps as if her life depended on it. “Such happiness and contentment she feels as a slave, and here I am her master and I still feel out of place” Dave thought. The pen had been a godsend to Dave and he couldn’t believe the day he had been having imbued with its power but nothing he had done had really made him truly content and happy. Dave had to think  of something to do because this war in his mind was really concerning him. Dave really wanted to be happy with what he brought into existence for himself.<br />
<br />
Thinking with his eyes closed Dave smirked at a thought that came into his mind even though it excited him greatly. Even as he tried to shoo it out of his mind it kept invading every other thought until he couldn’t avoid it any longer and had to face it. Dave had thought of switching places with Janet but temporarily and with protections for himself in place. Even though the idea was wacky beyond measure who’s to say the changes he brought to the world already weren’t even crazier then this idea? Dave shook his head a lot as he kept his eyes closed and continued to think about becoming Janet the slave girl for a time. Everything made sense to him he could be the submissive one for a change and someone else would be in control. Plus Dave would be a gorgeous woman in a tight bikini happy and content with who she was and what she did and if he ever wanted to change back there would be protections for him that he would include in the written spell. Dave thought more and more over how he wasn’t ever really happy with his life and when he saw Janet and thought of his own words about her “happy and content” tears nearly came to his eyes. Depression for Dave was a real thing and as he decided to do the change he really hoped this would offer him a glimpse of what being happy and feeling in place really meant.<br />
<br />
Opening his eyes to Janet looking at him hungrily with her impressive cleavage pushed out forward while she leaned and her kneeling legs spread wide he gave her a slight smile before she began to orgasm and scream from the attention he was giving her. Still smiling Dave took up the magic pen on a sheet of paper and began writing out his fantasy wish.<br />
<br />
“The world is reverted back to the time right before I made Janet work in the nude but after I turned her into an eighteen-year old intern. I want this current reality though to stay in standby for use later. When the world reverts back to earlier in my wishes I want to temporarily forget about the magic pen and the changes that are already in place have always been the way things are. The pen will disappear from sight to all people temporarily but return at a later time. Later in the day of that reverted reality around 2:00 PM I will swap bodies and lives with Janet in this current reality right after I made the corrections to the slave girl mindset and attire. Janet after swapping into my body has no recollection of ever being Janet but always being me, she will also have no recollection or knowledge of the pen. In this reality with Janet as me she will believe that she ordered a slave girl secretary from the academy and they sent her me as Janet. Right about the time I made myself her Master she as me will also become my Master. I will have no knowledge of the pen at that time so I will have no idea or knowledge of why I was turned into a slave girl version of Janet. I will be unable to call Janet as Dave anything else except ‘Dave’ or after the ownership binding ‘Master.’ I will also be unable to refer to myself as anything other then ‘Janet’ or whatever Janet as Dave orders me to call myself. I will be unable to explain to anyone who I really am and if I attempt to utter the words they will just come out as sexy and erotic phrases.&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking about the protections Dave didn’t want to make it too easy for himself to run away from a possible shot at happiness so he needed to put an easy challenge into the plan in order to prove that he was willing and desperate enough to go all the way to return to his old life”<br />
<br />
“I will swap back into my own or Dave’s body and this current reality and myself sitting in this chair at this time will return along with my knowledge of the pen, all my wishes including this one, and the magic pen sitting in my hand after I give Janet as Dave five blowjobs and swallow at least some of the sperm for each.” “That will make it interesting” Dave thought with a smirk as you put the pen down, the words on the paper glowed bright yellow and the world fell away from your vision into darkness.</p>
