<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You know what, I think I get it. I get why people like this sort of thing. I mean, it doesn’t make sense the more you think about it. But if it makes people happy, I’m not going to judge them. Not too hard mind you, but hard enough that I need a bathtub of salt instead of a pinch.”<br />
 Nancy just stares at her friend as the credits roll from what they were watching, wondering why she is getting so philosophical. “But at the very least, what do you think about the movie?” Nancy asked her friend while she was lying on top of her. Charlotte rotated her head enough to face Nancy and said, “It’s “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory”. I thought it was just a fine children&#39;s movie.”<br />
<br />
Nancy shook her head with her mouth full of popcorn that she had just popped for the movie. After swallowing the mouthful, she said, “Family movie, Charlotte. This is a family movie that many people love to watch. I figured that you might relate to it since you are, you know…” Nancy left the statement open-ended, gesturing to Charlotte&#39;s current situation that was caused by her devious machine.<br />
As if she wasn’t allowed to go out for the last few days of NNN, the nanomachines had inflated Charlotte up once again. But instead of something solid like fats or gaseous like helium, she was filling up with a liquid. As evident from her recent movie watching and her coloration, that liquid was blueberry juice.<br />
<br />
Akin to the times of her greatest weight gain and loss within the last few days, the only human elements that were left of her were her hands, her feet, and her head.  Granted, those ends are puffed out with the excess amount of fluid in her system, but she can still manipulate them to a degree. <br />
Everything else with her body had gone pear-shaped, or in her case blueberry-shaped. Except for her extremities, Charlotte&#39;s entire body has become completely spherical. That and oddly enough her breasts which grew slightly bigger to be noticeable but not too much that they are they’re own separate blueberries.<br />
<br />
Charlotte narrowed her eyes at what Nancy was implying. “Are you comparing my current situation to Violet’s?” Nancy nodded her head, saying, “Yeah, because both of you have turned into a blueberry. So I figured that you should know where this came from.” As she said it, Nancy shook the little part that she was lying on, sending waves of blueberry juice inside Charlotte to slosh about.<br />
Once Charlotte’s body calms down from all that motion, Charlotte replies, “Well, other than the fact that we became blueberries, there is nothing in common between the two of us. She had a choice but ate the magic gum, I got a bad random option from your tech. She got an inflatable suit with blue paint on it that makes her look like a ball, I am completely blue and nude with my tits projecting out.”<br />
<br />
Nancy, surprised to hear such an outcry, quietly mumbled under her breath, “Damn, tell me how you really feel about all of this.” But since Nancy was lying rather close to Charlotte’s head, Charlotte heard Nancy’s comment. “What was that about how I really feel about this?” Charlotte said in a threatening tone, or as threatening as a blueberry can be.<br />
Not wanting to lose her spot on her favorite water bed (or in this scenario, juice bed), and trying not to laugh at the funny attempt at intimidation, Nancy mumbled a quick apology at her immobile friend. “I’m sorry for my rudeness and for-.” “That wasn’t what I meant,” Charlotte interrupted Nancy’s apology. “What? But I was-. What are you doing?” Charlotte disrupted Nancy for the second time but not with words but with her head moving.<br />
<br />
“Okay, I know you can’t see it but my hand is doing the “come over here motion”.” Nancy looked down at Charlotte’s side where her hand was, seeing that it was making that motion. Now understanding what Charlotte was doing, Nancy crawled even closer to Charlotte’s head. “You know that we are the only people in the house, right?” Nancy whispered to Charlotte. “I know that but,” Charlotte’s cerulean eyes darted back and forth as if someone was eavesdropping on the conversation, “This feels very personal to say out loud.”<br />
<br />
“Is this about how you feel? How do you really feel about all of this?” Nancy asked with Charlotte’s chubby face going up and down with her nodding. “Since our Naughty Nano November Challenge is an addition to the No Nut November Challenge, I can’t “Nut” for a whole month. Well, every time I changed into another transformation, I really wanted to explore my new self but I can’t.” “Why?” Nancy asked, regretting to bring her phone up to take notes for her work.<br />
“Because part of the exploration would include my… sexual assets.” Nancy&#39;s eyes grew wide at what Charlotte said. “I knew that some of the transformations were erotic, including the unorthodox ones, but still!” Nancy said in a loud whisper. “But that&#39;s not all,” Charlotte continued after Nancy&#39;s outburst. “As we get closer to the end of the challenge, the need to fill that scratch grows and grows with each passing day. There were even days that I swore that I had lost the challenge and yet, I held myself back and kept moving forward. If I wasn’t a ball and wasn’t doing the challenge, I would be fucking myself raw with my whole arm inside me.”<br />
<br />
Never had Nancy heard such naughty words that came from her friend’s purpled lips. Charlotte cast her eyes away from Nancy after saying those words. “I’m sorry you heard all of that but it was the truth.” Nancy was too gobsmacked to respond to such a statement. Charlotte continued to talk while she still looked away from her closest friend. “That is how I feel, Nancy. How I really feel for almost a month now.”<br />
“Charlotte,” Nancy whispered her friend’s name. The blueberry looked back to see her friend. “I wouldn’t know how you would react if I told you but- oomf!” Charlotte was this time interrupted by Nancy. But she didn’t say a single word to stop the fruit babble. Instead, Nancy silenced Charlotte with an action that surprised them both. Nancy kissed Charlotte square on the lips.</p>
