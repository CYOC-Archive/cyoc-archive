<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Whilst Blueberry Transformation is Taking Place)<br />
<br />
Milo shut the bedroom door behind him, turning around to see Judy sitting on his bed, swinging her legs as if a child waiting impatiently. He sighed, sitting beside her,<br />
“Do you like me being all naked?” She asked giddily, swinging her body towards him to try and entice him,<br />
“I would,” he said, “just wish you would go back to how you were… airhead Judy is not as fun as regular Judy,”<br />
“In what way?” She asked, as if he were talking about someone totally different,<br />
“Well to start, most of my jokes are flying right over your head. Judy would understand them and recognise them. She was smart. A lot smarter than me, and she liked hearing me talk about the things I enjoy,”<br />
“Oh… I see,” Judy said, looking a little down in the dumps. But not seeking the attention her mind wanted her to. Instead, she had an idea, “I know I’m not a big smarty-pants like Judy, I’m just a dumb dumb,” she giggled, “but won’t she come back if you just play your cards right now?”<br />
“I—” Milo started, thinking for a second, “god, yeah she would!”<br />
“Then play them silly!” Judy’s said with glee, jumping up and down in anticipation.<br />
<br />
Milo grabbed his action card and turned it over, “it says ‘No Action Applies’, and change card says,” he turned it over, “Child? One round…”<br />
<br />
The two watched as quickly Milo’s body started reducing. The toned physique he was so proud of slimmed down, becoming skinnier as his limbs began to shrink shorter and shorter. His small beard regressed back into his face. Before long, he looked about fifteen. As he continued to shrink beyond his new teenage body, he felt his limbs getting progressively shorter. His body started losing the hair he’d grown, everywhere but on on his head.<br />
Within the next few moments, his body had gone from mid-twenty year old, to mid-teen, to just around ten-to-eleven years old. Sitting on the bed, beside a totally naked woman, was a much younger version of Milo.<br />
<br />
Judy jumped up, leaning over to stare at him in awe. Her naked breasts making Milo confused, as if the feeling he was feeling was very new. As if he’d never truly seen a woman naked before,<br />
“Oh my god!!” Judy exclaimed, “you are so totally adorable!”<br />
“D-don’t patronise me…” Milo said in his much higher prepubescent voice,<br />
“Awww…” Judy continued to mess with him, “do you want me to—” she stopped, her eyes going wide as if suddenly realising something. Like a memory from years ago suddenly entering her mind… but it wasn’t a memory. It was everything.<br />
“Babe?” Milo said, odd coming from such a young child.<br />
Judy slowly looked down, seeing that she was wearing absolutely nothing, completely naked. She shakily lifted her hand up to her ears, finding them at the top of her head, longer and furrier,<br />
“W-what… the fuck…” she said, “did I do…” she stammered. She finally looked ahead, seeing this child sitting on her boyfriends bed, “M-Milo?” She stuttered,<br />
“Yeah?” He replied, then asked, “babe? Are you back?”<br />
“No way,” she said, turning around to grab the door handle,<br />
“NO WAIT!” Milo shouted, “you can’t leave while Harry and Isabella are—”<br />
“NOPE!” Judy shouted, “I’m naked, I can feel just how long my tongue is, I have rabbit ears, you’re a kid, there is no any what’s out here is any worse than in here!” She yanked at the door, finally opening it wide.<br />
Milo jumped off the bed, knocking the two cards she’d left on the bed onto the floor, both facing straight up for him involuntarily read, “oh shit…” he said.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
Judy stumbled out of Milo’s room, watching the glance of a much more blue Harry. His cock was sticking out of his pants, dripping a few drops of blue cum. She took in his whole body, seeing his bloated blue belly, the blue stains at his nipples from where she could only assume he’d leaked. She didn’t want to ask any questions, but he sure did,<br />
“J-Judy!” He exclaimed, “is it you? Like you’re back?” He asked happily,<br />
“Ehm…” Judy replied, simply choosing to walk past him and enter the living room.<br />
What she found was a giant blueberry woman, formerly known as Isabella leaking small puddles of blue liquid onto Milo’s carpet. She was huge, just about touching the ceiling of the living room,<br />
“Ju-dy…” she said, clearly struggling to talk through her bloated blue face.<br />
<br />
“W-what the hell is going on!?” She shouted with a look of absolute horror on her face, “I CAN’T DO THIS! WE NEED TO END THIS GAME!!!” She yelled,<br />
“BABE!” A young voice called as Milo ran into the room, holding two cards in his hands,<br />
“MILO!?” Harry yelled, now back into the living room, having stuffed his cock back in his pants and just dealing with what was going on as it happened, “y-you’re like… ten!?” He said, shocked,<br />
“JUDY!” Milo said to Judy, trying to get her attention. He was unable to, as she quickly stepped away from everyone, finding a corner of the room furthest away from everyone.<br />
<br />
But before she could even think about getting comfortable, she felt something changing in her,<br />
“WHY NOW!?” She yelled, “why can’t it just wait…” she said, falling to her knees.<br />
The group watched as her breasts began to lift. They weren’t huge to start with, but enough to be noticeable, and as Milo had said before. He loved them just as they are. But as they lifted, they began to firm, getting more and more solid and round. Before too long, they were about twice their size, maybe a C cup, pushing a D cup. She placed her hand on them gently, then began to poke at them,<br />
“Implant…” she said, “so finally something I wanted,” she said, looking defeated,<br />
“You wanted implants?” Milo said, looking surprised,<br />
“Yeah…” she said, finally distracted from everything for just a split second, “I said a while ago I was thinking about implants… I always wanted bigger breasts and I like the look of implants,”<br />
“W-when did you…” Milo wondered, “oh shit, right,” he said, facepalming himself, “I said I like your breast the way they are… you don’t have to change yourself for me,” he recalled, cringing at himself, “I didn’t realise you wanted them for yourself…”<br />
“It’s fine,” she said, chuckling, “I’m glad you like my body as it is… or was,” she chuckled,<br />
“Well…” Milo started, “you ever wanted them even bigger?”<br />
“Huh?” Judy questioned. She looked down, feeling the silicone embedded in underneath her skin starting to increase in volume. Her breasts rising even more, getting bigger as her skin stretched a little tighter than before. She was lucky they weren’t so large on the first card, as they could’ve easily grown to giant proportions. They finished at a solid E cup, much bigger than she would’ve chosen, but still not as bad as they could’ve been,<br />
“Wow…” she said, feeling her round E cup breasts, poking and prodding at her flesh. They didn’t look brand new, just like she’d had them for some time, enough for them to not look so taut, “they sure are big…” she said,<br />
“I don’t think I can really appreciate them right now,” Milo said, looking at himself, “maybe in a round…”<br />
“A round?” Judy asked,<br />
“Yeah, the ‘Child’ Card only lasts a single round,”<br />
“Just… li-ke, me,” Isabella said from behind.<br />
Judy, now a lot calmer, looked at Isabella. She stood herself up, keeping her arm underneath her breasts to support them. She still wasn’t used to the feeling,<br />
“God, Izzy,” Judy said, taking in the sight that was Isabella, “do you feel okay?”<br />
“Goo-d… I fe-el go-od,” she said, still struggling with speaking. Judy looked over her whole body, seeing just how round it was,<br />
“Do you mind if I poke you?” She asked,<br />
“Ple-ase,” Isabella spoke.<br />
Slowly, Judy pressed a finger on her body. It was squishy. Still felt like flesh but filled with something, more like a water-balloon than a person. She pressed her hand into her skin, moving it slowly down to feel more of her body,<br />
“Ooh!” Isabella moaned,<br />
“Are you okay?” Judy asked, quickly removing her hand from Isabella’s flesh,<br />
“Boob,” she replied quickly, chuckling,<br />
“Oh my bad!” Judy said, laughing.<br />
<br />
“Okay babe,” Milo interrupted, bringing everyones attention onto him, “I think we might need to get through these turns to return Isabella back to normal,”<br />
“Yeah, good point,” Harry said, he stepped to be in Isabella’s eyeliner, “baby, you good if we keep playing,”<br />
“Yep,” Isabella replied quickly,<br />
“Alright, cool,” Harry said, he looked at Milo and Judy, “so you’ve both had your turns, that means its my turn,”<br />
<br />
The non-inflated players all sat back down in their places. Harry reached over to grab his cards, bumping his bloated belly into the side of the table, making his slightly engorged chest leak just the tiniest bit of juice. Only Judy seemed to notice, and it made her even more curious with her only remaining question; how does the juice taste?<br />
“Okay, for Action Card, ‘Change is Decided By Player’,” he said. Everyone looked amazed,<br />
“Seriously?” Milo replied,<br />
“That’s gotta be the best card in the deck,” Judy said,<br />
“W-what do I use it for though…” he questioned,<br />
“I’d use it to make my cock bigger again, if I’m honest,” Milo said, everyones eyes falling on him, “when I’m back to being an adult, obviously…” he said,<br />
“Right… I don’t know if I should use it for some sort of gain, what if it affected someone else?”<br />
“Oh who cares,” Judy said, “we’re all getting pretty awful changes, what’s one more. If you want it, you have it. If we have to have it, then hope you can swap it back afterwards,”<br />
“That’s…” Harry started,<br />
“Really surprising, coming from you,”<br />
“Yeah well, I’m just playing the game now,” she said, “I got implants, so I can’t really complain. Go for something you really want!”<br />
“I…” Harry said, thinking about what he ‘really wanted’, “I guess… I guess I wouldn’t mind a real beach body, some wavy blonde hair… and a pretty big cock,”<br />
“Well you’ve already got that last one,” Milo joked,<br />
“Alright, I got it. For my change, I want ‘A beach body with wavy blonde hair, and a pretty huge cock!’,” he finished with a smirk on his face,<br />
“Now let’s hope it lands on you, not me or Isabella,” Judy said, sort of worried now that she’d pointed it out,<br />
“Or we hope it lands on me,” Milo joked,<br />
“Yeah…” Judy said, “not you with blonde hair,” she teased.<br />
<br />
Harry picked up an Action Card and read it aloud, hoping it would apply to him, “‘Card Applies to Player’,” YES!” He exclaimed happily.<br />
The group watched as his blueberry belly disappeared and a set of abs began to form. His arms toned as his pecs got tighter, even his butt started looking even better. His buzzed red hair sprouted, getting longer and wavier, looking gorgeous. His face didn’t change since he didn’t specify it to do so, but his new hair complimented his face shape as it was. The blue on his body had totally disappeared. He felt his final change as it started to happen. The group couldn’t see, but the large bulge in his pants grew once again, becoming longer and even a little more sensitive. He let out a quiet sigh of pleasure,<br />
“Let… me se-e,” Isabella said from behind. She could only see the back of her boyfriend from where she was planted, and wanted to see the whole picture.<br />
Harry stood up, sexily brushing his wavy hair behind his ear. As he stood up, like it was an episode of some cheesy TV show, his shirt opened, revealing his toned abs and tight chest. He walked to face his blueberry girlfriend,<br />
“You like,” he said, biting his lip,<br />
“So… much,” she replied, making deep eye contact with him, “my… turn…” she finished,<br />
“Oh right!” Harry said, “I’ll grab your cards,”<br />
“Can you do that?” Milo asked as Harry leaned over to grab the cards. His eyes immediately drawn to his glistening torso,<br />
“I guess so, but it’s not like Izzy can do it herself,”<br />
“True,” Milo replied,<br />
“Let me take one,” Judy said, standing herself up,<br />
“Oh really?” Harry questioned, her hand snatching the Action Card before he could take it,<br />
“Yeah,” she said, “I wanted to see Isabella before she turned back to normal,”<br />
“Is this what you just told me babe?” Milo asked,<br />
“Yeah… is it still okay?”<br />
“Yeah yeah, but not in a sexy way,”<br />
“No no,” she clarified to her boyfriend, “just because I’m curious for the taste,”<br />
“The taste?” Harry jumped in, “don’t tell me you’re…”<br />
“I just… I wanna… y’know?” She said, stumbling over words,<br />
“Well it’s not my body,” Harry said, gesturing to his own body, then to his inflated girlfriends.<br />
<br />
The two walked over to Isabella, who was anticipating her return back to normal,<br />
“Hey baby,” Harry started, “Judy has a question, and don’t feel like you have to say yes,<br />
“Ok-ay,” Isabella replied, shifting her eyes to Judy, who was standing with her newly expanded breasts,<br />
“C-can I…” she said, trying her best to not sound like a total weirdo, “I just, I wanted to try… or taste like…”<br />
“Ju-ice?” Isabella questioned,<br />
“Y-yeah… is that okay?”<br />
“Yes!” Isabella said, bouncing a little, “too mu-ch, turn bl-ue,”<br />
“Yeah, good point baby,” Harry said, “if you get carried away, it might turn you blue,”<br />
“Like with you?” Judy asked, “so you tried it already?”<br />
“Yeah…” Harry said, suddenly becoming aware that what he’d done was kind of embarrassing,<br />
“Where do I drink from?” Judy asked,<br />
“Well I would suggest you don’t get it from her mouth,” Harry said,<br />
“Right… s-so…”<br />
“Bo-obs,” Isabella said. Everyone looked a little awkward, “it’s… ok-ay!”<br />
Judy looked to Harry, he shrugged.<br />
Slowly, Judy lowered herself to the height of Isabella’s nipples. She could see just a few drops of juice dripping from each nipple. She moved herself forward, her mouth now right next to it. With ample hesitation, she placed her mouth around the big nipples, completely sealing her mouth shut. Isabella let out a slight moan of pleasure, trying her best to keep it in.<br />
Judy licked around it, tasting the juice. It was amazing! Nothing like she’d ever tasted before. Rich and creamy, yet smooth and sweet. Just the right amount to make the perfect tasting blueberry juice. She sucked just once, allowing the juice to spray from Isabella’s nipple right to the back of Judy’s throat. She felt like she should’ve gagged, but she didn’t. She sucked another time, and then just one more. She filled her mouth with the juice before finally swallowing.<br />
A testament to her natural willpower, she pulled away from Isabella’s body despite wanting more. As she came back to reality, she wiped her hand, licking up any of the excess blueberry juice she she’d drooled out. She looked up at Isabella, bringing herself back to her eye-line,<br />
“Thank you,” she said, “that was honestly delicious,”<br />
“It really is tasty, right!” Harry said, “Now while you were down there, we realised something,”<br />
“You did?”<br />
“Yeah,” Harry started, “we realised that when Izzy got this blueberry card, she also had a double card. Which didn’t mean her change was twice as big, it meant it lasts twice as long. So she’s not turning back to normal,”<br />
“Oh so you have another round… like that?”<br />
“Ye-ah,” Isabella said, “go-od news,” she started, still struggling to speak,<br />
“Good news?” Judy said confused,<br />
“Ha-rry,” Isabella said,<br />
“Her card says ‘Card Applies to Player in Front’, which is you,” he explained,<br />
“Cha-nge card…” Isabella said, prompting Harry to show her the card, “‘Bi-rth-ing Hi-ps,” Isabella said.<br />
<br />
“Oh… so that applies to m- OH!” She jumped, feeling her hips cracking, changing shape. It was painful, if anything just uncomfortable. Her hips widened, getting almost as wide as her shoulders. Complimenting her enhanced bust, her hips gave her a vast distance between her thighs. Milo sat wishing he could at least appreciate what he was watching. But he didn’t have to wait long.<br />
“Wow,” Judy said, “these are better than I would’ve thought!” She laughed.<br />
<br />
“Babe?” A much deeper voice said from where Milo was sitting. The group turned (excluding Isabella) to face him, seeing that the younger child version of Milo had begun to grow again. His body was shifting, growing taller once again. He entered his tweens, his teens, his late teens, before hitting early adulthood. His beard returned, and like his age regression, his progression caused his clothes to grow with him. He finally returned to his original age, looking down at himself to see the body he was oh so proud of. He stood back up and approached his girlfriend,<br />
“Babe!” Judy said. He didn’t say a word before wrapping his arms around her and kissing her on the lips. He then hugged her sincerely,<br />
“I’m so glad you’re back…” Milo said,<br />
“Th-thank you babe,” Judy said, hugging him back.<br />
<br />
“Well I guess it’s your turn now, man,” Harry said,<br />
“Yeah,” Milo said, slowly releasing his girlfriend, “I guess it is,” he said. Everyones eyes fell upon the wooden box. They all felt just a fraction of dread. Not enough to terrify them, but enough to worry them as to what would come next…</p>
