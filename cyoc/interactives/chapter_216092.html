<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Morning David,” Marco said as he walked down the stairs, “you want something to drink?” He asked,<br />
“Tea if that’s cool,” David replied with a smile,<br />
“Should’ve guessed,” Marco chuckled, “Elisha’s just getting dressed upstairs, he’ll be down in a few minutes,”<br />
“No problem,” David nodded. He looked around, spotting Mason and Kailyn talking on the other side of the room. Mason and David made eye contact.<br />
It wasn’t a secret that David and Mason never got along. They were in a few of the same classes, and just never saw eye-to-eye. But despite all of that, they respected each other. Mason always guessed David only tutored Elisha because of how much his parents paid him, which wasn’t entirely the truth.<br />
Kailyn, on the other hand, smiled at David in a half-flirty way. David awkwardly smiled back, not knowing if she meant it directly at him or just being herself.<br />
<br />
“Here you go, champ,” Marco said, handing a cup of tea to David, “just a heads up, I’ve got a couple friends coming over later. Don’t let them get in the way,”<br />
“That’s cool, I’ll stay out of the way,”<br />
“No, I mean I want you to meet them. I think they’d like you. I just know they’re gonna be a little… loud,”<br />
“Got it,” David said, “I’ll come say hi!”<br />
“Awesome,” Marco said, “where is that kid,” he said to himself, walking past David and up the stairs to find Elisha.<br />
David chuckled before he took a sip of tea.<br />
<br />
“Hey David,” Kailyn said from behind David, making him jump and subsequently spit out a little of his tea,<br />
“Jeez!” He said, catching himself, “you scared me,” he said. Kailyn giggled,<br />
“Sorry,” he said with a grin on her face,<br />
“Y-you doing okay?” He asked awkwardly,<br />
“Yeah,” she replied, “morning was a little difficult, but got through it,”<br />
“What happened this morning?” David asked,<br />
“Oh nothing, just a light jog with my mom,”<br />
<br />
“And me!” Mason yelled from across the room. He was holding his laptop under his arm, “hey,” he said,<br />
“Hey,” David said back,<br />
“Can you just stay out of my conversations for once!” Kailyn yelled at her brother,<br />
“Nope!” Mason said to piss her off, succeeding,<br />
“Shut up you asshole!”<br />
“Language,” another familiar voice said. From the front door came the all-famous, all-sexy, Sofia Clemens (formerly Sofia West). She was wearing a very tight red sweater-jacket that showed off both her midriff and her cleavage, as well as a pair of jeggings and boots. She spotted David, “hello David,” she said in her vaguely Spanish accent, “how’re you,”<br />
“I’m alright,” he said, maintaining eye-contact with her eyes… nothing else. Trying his best.<br />
<br />
“Hey honey,” Marco said, returning from upstairs without Elisha. He turned to David, “Elisha’s going to be two minutes, do you wanna get yourself set up?”<br />
“Of course,” David said. He smiled at Sofia, Kailyn, and the back of Mason’s head.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
A few hours had passed. Elisha and David had made some significant progress on the work David wanted him to go through today.<br />
As Elisha worked on a few questions, David started to get pissed off with the odd noise banging in his head. He couldn’t get rid of it. He closed his eyes, and tried to focus on it… like someone whispering in his ear, but right into his skull.<br />
‘Make a Wish’<br />
‘Make a Wish’<br />
“I…” David said, then realised he was speaking out loud, “I-I’m gonna go to the bathroom for a minute,”<br />
“Okay,” Elisha said, “can we take a break soon?”<br />
“Yeah sure,” David said, “y’know what, let’s take a break now. Let’s say thirty minutes, then we finish the rest of your work. Then we call it for today,”<br />
“Awesome!” Elisha said.<br />
David really did enjoy working with Elisha, but considering it was a Saturday, and Elisha was approaching Spring break, he wasn’t going to make him work too hard today.<br />
<br />
David got himself up, and headed up the stairs to the bathroom. As he entered the hallway towards the guest bathroom, he caught a glimpse of Sofia sitting on the edge of her bed, typing on her phone. Her top was opened, revealing her very tight and very small tank top, showing off her large and deep cleavage. His eyes went wide as he quickly walked past the room. He entered the bathroom, mental image still stuck in his head.<br />
“That’s not going away for at least two weeks,” he whispered to himself.<br />
<br />
As he was washing his hands, he looked himself on the mirror, still imagining Sofia’s chest in his mind,<br />
‘Make a Wish’<br />
“Oh my god…” David said to himself, “fine, I… I wish Sofia’s breasts weren’t so big!” He said quietly.<br />
He dried his hands, and exited the bathroom. As he walked by the door once again, trying his best not to make eye-contact with Sofia as he grabbed another glance at her chest… something was wrong.<br />
“Huh?” He said, staring at her… flat chest?<br />
“Something wrong?” Sofia asked, David’s eyes went wide again,<br />
“OH no nothing!” He said, “I just… I was… I—” he hesitated, “I wish I never left the bathroom!” He blurted out.<br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, David was staring at himself in the mirror again, “AH!” He said, stumbling backwards and crashing into the door, “what the hell just…”<br />
“Is everything okay in there?” Sofia asked from outside the door, clearly some concern in her voice,<br />
“y-YEAh!” David’s voice cracked, “all good!” He said,<br />
“O-okay,” she said, clearly concerned.<br />
<br />
David looked himself in the mirror again,<br />
“Did I do that?” He said, “d-did that even happen?” He asked himself, “oh my god I just made Sofia Clemens’ flat as a board,” he whispered to himself, “I-I wish they were back to normal size…” he said, then got distracted, “or bigger… yeah I wish they were like twice their original size,” he said, shaking a little.<br />
<br />
In a moment, he realised what he’d just said. He quickly opened the door, catching Sofia as she walking down the stairs. She glanced at him, her body almost out of view…<br />
“Is everything okay, David?” She asked, staring at him. But he couldn’t make eye contact with her eyes. Her breasts, already large, were even larger!<br />
“FINE!” He shouted, “I just wish I never left that bathroom!” He said again.<br />
<br />
And in a split moment, he opened his eyes to find himself comfortably back in the bathroom.<br />
He stared himself in the eyes, trying to understand what was going on, “why the hell can I make wishes…” he said to himself, “w-what’s the limit of them, I wish I was like twice as big!” He said. Suddenly, he found himself growing. He grew and grew, bursting right out of his clothes. Quickly he reached the ceiling. He watched as his body tore open his t-shirt, jeans, shoes, even underwear, getting a nice view of his decently (now physically giant) sized cock, “I didn’t mean bigger like that!” He said. Clearly it did something, because he started slowly gaining an amount of fat. His belly bulging, his thighs thickening. His entire body getting fatter and fatter, “not like that either! I meant like my cock!” He said, a little too loud. He quickly looked behind him, seeing if anyone had come looking for him.<br />
He turned back to find his cock was almost three times as large. It was longer, thicker, meatier. He looked at as much of himself as he could in the mirror, “oh my god,” he said to himself. He was a giant, fat, massive-cock wielding monster.<br />
“O-okay, I wish I was back to normal,” he said. And as he asked, he found himself shrinking back down to his regular size.<br />
His clothes didn’t grow with him however, “and my clothes?” He asked. His clothes suddenly flew right back onto his body, repairing in an instant.<br />
<br />
“This is crazy,” he said, “I need… I wish…” he thought for a moment, not wanting to waste a single wish. He imagined his giant cock, knowing he didn’t want to do that again… at least not that big. Then his mind went to Sofia, how large her breasts had become. He couldn’t focus on her, and her massive breasts. His mind went elsewhere, and he lost track of his thoughts,<br />
“Kailyn with breasts as large as her moms, and her ass, and butt and hips, and even…” he stopped himself, realising what he had said, “oh shit!” He said, “I-I…” he then hesitated, “i-is it even…”<br />
<br />
David cleared his throat, “I wish that all of the changes I have made will make all clothing fit, no one will notice, and everything will be totally normal to everyone,” he said, “except me,” he finished.<br />
<br />
—<br />
<br />
David exited the bathroom. His clothes no longer on the floor, now perfectly on his body. He approached the stairs, slowly descending down them, terrified of what he’ll find.<br />
“Hey!” Marco says, appearing from below, making David jump,<br />
“Oh my—”<br />
“Sorry, bud,” Marco said, “just going to the bathroom,” he chuckled,<br />
“R-right,” David said. Marco could clearly tell something was off,<br />
“You sure you’re okay?” He asked as they passed on the stairs,<br />
“Yeah, totally. Everything’s cool.” David said awkwardly,<br />
“Alright,” Marco said, “but you let me know what’s bothering you,” he said,<br />
“O-okay!” David said with an awkward thumbs up.<br />
<br />
He got to the bottom of the stairs, greeted immediately by Mason,<br />
“Hey,” he said,<br />
“Uhm, you don’t know where your sister is, right?”<br />
“Why?” Mason asked defensively,<br />
“N-nothing, I just wanted to ask her something…”<br />
“Listen, it’s the last time I’m having this happen!” He snapped,<br />
“W-what?”<br />
“You wanna gawk at her, be my guest! But I’m not gonna approve of it, asshole!”<br />
“Language!” Sofia said, once again. She walked in from the kitchen, greeting to the two boys,<br />
“Hey mom,” Mason said. David couldn’t reply. He was taking in the sight of her double-sized breasts. They looked like watermelons bolted right onto her chest,<br />
“David?” Sofia asked. His eyes snapped up to her eyes,<br />
“Sorry!” He said, “hi,” he said awkwardly. She giggled,<br />
“Glad to see they still get some attention,” she joked. David felt incredibly awkward. Mason looked pissed,<br />
“So first my sister, then my mom!?”<br />
<br />
“What about me?” Kailyn asked from behind. David looked terrified to turn around. He slowly moved his body to face her, and in front of her was possibly the most uniquely curvy girl he’d ever seen in his life.<br />
Her breasts were enormous, her butt stuck out like a shelf and her hips were as wide as her shoulders. It seemed like David had given her the same curves as her mother without the necessary proportions to make her look even remotely normal,<br />
“Don’t stare at me like that,” she said, immediately feeling judged,<br />
“Are you kidding me,” Mason said,<br />
“It’s not-! David started, but just decided he could make a wish and fix it, “I wish you had realistic proportions,” he said.<br />
<br />
Then waited… and waited.<br />
Kailyn stared back at him, tears welling up in his eyes. Mason looked as if he was going to punch him, “I wish you had realistic proportions…” still nothing, “I wish you had smaller tits, ass… I wish…”<br />
“I’m gonna kill you,” Mason said, placing his laptop on the counter and approaching David with his fist clenched.<br />
<br />
David prepped from impact, knowing he’d seriously screwed up here. Mason inched closer and closer, seemingly getting angrier by the second. A voice from behind spoke,<br />
“Mason!” Sofia boomed. Mason stopped, spun around and looked up at his mother… wait, up?<br />
<br />
David saw as Sofia towered over the three of them. She had to be around nine and a half feet tall. She was gigantic… but how had she grown so large!?<br />
<br />
“How DARE you attack our guest,”<br />
“But mom, you didn’t hear what he said to—”<br />
“I don’t CARE!” She boomed, “it is unacceptable!”<br />
He giant breasts showing her mountains of cleavage, now even larger with her body so much bigger.<br />
<br />
“Baby!” Marco said, quickly swinging around the stairs. He looked up at his wife, staring at her face, her legs, at her breasts! He was looking at her… but it was as if he wasn’t used to seeing her this way. This looked like something new to him as well.<br />
<br />
Then David saw it.<br />
<br />
In Marco’s hand, held tightly.<br />
The Rainbow Rock.</p>
