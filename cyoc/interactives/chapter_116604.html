<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your body began changing, and your body began growing black fur everywhere. Your hands grew and changed, and you grew large claws that were 8 inches long. Your skull pushed out into a large canine muzzle, and your senses of smell and hearing rose sharply. As your senses rose your ears became pointed, and moved higher up your head, and your nose turned big and pitch black, and felt wet. Your teeth became longer, and sharper like razors, and your tongue became longer. Your feet then changed to become paws, and grew claws that weren&#39;t nearly as long as the ones on your hands, and only seemed to have a purpose to grip the ground. <br />
<br />
You then grew rough black pads on your hands and feet effectively giving you paws for feet, and giant paw-hands. You then grew a bushy black tail that was similar to a wolf&#39;s tail, and your entire body was now covered in black fur. Your dick then enlarged sending you surges of pleasure, and you looked down to see your dick grow to about 14 inches long, and it retreated into a skin sheath, and your balls were now the size of kiwis. Finally your ribs, and spine grew out, and your shoulders became more broad, and you gained muscle mass similar to that of a body builder. Within the pain of your transformation you barely even noticed that your leash was gone.<br />
<br />
Your instincts kicked in seconds later, and you grew to have a slight taste of blood, and instincts to hunt. Your former human canines were now like large fangs, and you questioned wether you should be considered an animal or not. &quot;Perfect, I think I&#39;ll call you Fang, generic I know but it fits you.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...I can smell blood, and I crave for it, but I don&#39;t want to, but I need to hunt, but I&#39;ve never killed anyone like this before. AAAGHH! Who...what am I?!&quot; You growled trying to get control of your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now now there Fang, those feelings are just natural for an alpha male, which I&#39;m surprised that your body is that of an alpha. Your craves can be settled easily, and your instincts won&#39;t affect your personality...too much anyways. You&#39;ll definitely be more aggressive, but just in case I put an enchantment on you just in case you get too feral. In other words if you attack me, or leave the area you&#39;ll be in for a shock.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;So I basically have a shock collar on?&quot; You said in a low growling tone feeling around your neck, but there was nothing there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re referring to, but you aren&#39;t wearing anything. If you like to think of your restraint like that then go ahead.&quot; The witch said<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t leave this house then, may I know your name please?&quot; You asked, and it seems that you need to growl to speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;Galga, but you will call me mistress, and remember your place as my pet. Do as I say and you can live your life alongside me, but disappoint me and you will experience some...changes, some bad changes for you.&quot; The witch, Galga said<br />
<br />
You paused, and took a moment to think about your situation, and the witch turned you into a werewolf with only a mixture from a spoon, and she everything she&#39;s done up to this point was with ease. &quot;O..of course Mistress Galga, but if I may say something. Won&#39;t I make a mess of an intruder? Between my claws, and my instincts I may go berserk.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about making a mess my dear pet, as long as you don&#39;t have any doggie accidents I am fine with you slaughtering a human, and painting the walls with blood. Besides human blood is useful unlike werewolf piss, and feces.&quot; Galga said<br />
<br />
&quot;Then in that case may I know the boundaries for the enchantment you put on me? For reasons of what you referred to as an accident?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;My hut is surrounded by trees, so your boundary is merely the tree line. Two more things, Fang if I perish so do you, but I have taken many precautions and that shouldn&#39;t be a big issue for you. The second thing is that I ask you not to be such a fool, and use the bridge that leads to the pond&#39;s edge.&quot; Galga said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...apologies I was not aware that there was a bridge, please forgive me Mistress.&quot; You said, now panting thinking about feasting, and draining the blood of a human, or a deer. You shook your head trying to focus,&quot;Damn these instincts!&quot; You growled to yourself, and your stomach growled shortly after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if you were hungry you could have just asked, here&#39;s something to settle your gluttony.&quot; Galga said, and she waved her wand, and a dead deer appeared in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may feast on this one indoors mainly because any leftover blood works for alchemy, or for my alchemy.&quot; Galga said, and you nodded letting your instincts take control. You tore into the deer easily mindlessly eating everything you could find inside of it. After about 15 minutes of vicious eating you licked up the excess deer blood on the corpse, while leaving the blood on the floor, and walls to rest where it was. The deer was now only a skeleton, and it&#39;s hide was in pieces all over the room.<br />
<br />
You let out a satisfied burp in the end, and Galga, who was upstairs, walked down to you once you did. &quot;My my you were a hungry puppy Fang, I&#39;ll take care of the bloody mess here as well as the ruined hide mess. You can do whatever you want with the bones, I don&#39;t care about them. Also I have a place for you to sleep in a cave, and your boundary has been extended so that you may use it. You may however take your bones up there if you want.&quot; Galga said<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? oh uh thanks Mistress.&quot; You said, and Galga waved her wand and you both appeared in the entrance of a cave that overlooked the hut. <br />
<br />
&quot;Here, use this, and any resources you wish to personalize this to your liking, it&#39;s not extremely large, but it&#39;s comfortable for a werewolf like yourself Fang. I also moved your bones inside for you, but it&#39;s getting late for me, and I&#39;m tired. You know what that means Fang, werewolves are nocturnal so you will probably be here most of the time during the day, you don&#39;t need sleep, but you do need rest from time to time.&quot; Galga said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, thanks, seriously Mistress, I&#39;ll get to my duty as soon as possible.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course use anything the outdoors of the wilderness to their most, and do what werewolves would do naturally.  Especially mating if you can manage, but unlike most werewolves you aren&#39;t restricted to a full moon you are forever a werewolf, and not tonight, but tomorrow is a full moon, and maybe just maybe you can entice a female werewolf. When werewolves mate they gain a small amount of their humanity back, in return for them also remaining a pure werewolf forever. See if you can recruit a few more wolves too, and assert yourself as Alpha, they will respect you as a familiar, but make sure that they have orders to stay away from here when dawn comes. Werewolf amnesia is great, but I don&#39;t want any humans waking up here seeing my home.&quot; Galga explained, and you nodded,&quot;Of course my Mistress, thank you for the advice, I also assume that I should avoid silver as much as possible.&quot; You said.<br />
<br />
&quot;As a critical measure, you can see silver differently from all other metals so avoid it as much as possible, and wake me if you encounter such an obstacle.&quot; Galga said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s that much of a threat?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;One shallow cut wound over a small area is enough to kill you, if the weapon is silver related in any way shape or form.&quot; Galga said, and you gulped<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries for now, unless you screw up, and someone escapes.&quot; Galga reassured you, and you nodded.<br />
<br />
Galga then waved her wand and she teleported away without you, and you figured it was so she could clean the blood, using whatever magic related method she decides to use. You then made your way through the brush of the forest again, and destroying any plants in your way except for trees, of course. You made it to the hut, and saw the bridge leading to the hut, and you motioned to smack you forehead, but stopped yourself because of your claws.<br />
<br />
You walked back into the hut seeing that it was almost past dusk, and the stars in the sky were different in position than from what you remember. You shrugged, and figured that it was because you were on a different world, and you walked into the hut seeing that your bloody deer mess was clean, and that the whole room was dark. &quot;Perfect,&quot; you thought to yourself, thinking that if anyone saw you that they would attack on sight based on your appearance. You then sat down in the shadows of the first floor area, and looked out across the bridge, and began your duty as guard. The night seemed more appealing to you, and you kept surveying the entrance for anything trying to enter. Eventually....<br />
<br />
(Choose the fate of those who pass by, they know where the hut is if they only pass, so take note of that.)</p>
