<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>If you don&#39;t like this one, feel free to use it as a template to branch off.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days passed since the body switch happened. Benny-now-Lenny was at work, hating his life. He was Rusty’s partner now and was forced to go on patrols. He thought being Lenny would be easy because he wouldn’t be blamed and shunned by his own community. In fact, he was hearing what they were too polite to say to his face behind closed doors. <br />
<br />
Word had gotten out about the Book and many people were pissed because they were in a form they hated or the form itself was a hardship. Being forced to be a vegan wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea. The Impossible Burger was nothing like the real thing, after all. It wasn’t just dietary restrictions, some of them were too big-to sum it up, size limitations and restrictions made working and driving a bitch. And, thanks to inflation and the rising cost of food at the grocery store, being an elephant man who needs to consume 20 lbs of food a DAY was prohibitively expensive.<br />
<br />
Benny-now-Lenny grew to realize how lucky he was that Rusty and Tex were always around to act as deterrents against actual physical violence.<br />
<br />
But the complaints weren’t the only reason BnL hated his job.<br />
<br />
The Lenny in this new reality wasn’t part of the friend group. Rusty would grow increasingly agitated whenever BnL asked too many questions, giving him zero updates on the Book situation.He had a cold wife to go home to, one who never even put out a handjob and always cooked dinner earlier than BnL got off work. He got off work at seven. The fucking bitch. That’s why he hated women, the passive aggressive bullshit did nothing but frustrate him. Gay guys were infinitely easier to deal with.<br />
<br />
Worse than all of that was seeing Tex and Benny walking around the city with the Book in Tex’s hand. He’d see them on his patrols. Of course, he’d ask them what they were doing but they refused to answer his questions. He’d actually arrested Tex, his anger overwhelming him, until Rusty had stopped him and threatened to reprimand him to the Chief. They’d gotten into a fight when he told him to fuck himself. Lenny still had a black eye. He hadn’t lost, of course, he was bigger, but he was nearly suspended for it. Only a kind word from Tex had saved his career.<br />
<br />
After that, being in the squad car with Rusty was painful. He’d requested a switch after the fight but Rusty, for some reason had defended his actions and refused to press charges against Lenny. He couldn’t stand how flustered the dog made him feel, how his chest felt like it was being crushed when Rusty’s eyes slid over him like he wasn’t there.<br />
<br />
And then he had to go home for the night.<br />
<br />
He drove to the gym to lift some weight, reduce his stress. It was well-equipped, sized for larger anthros like himself. He walked through the doors along a hallway plastered with advertisements with many of the local gym residents showing off their muscles. One day, he’d be up there, right next to them. <br />
<br />
BnL preferred to work on whatever part of the gym was empty and away from people that might give him a boner. Male or female. Even his wife was looking good after four days of constant horniness. He hadn’t touched his cock for that long either, afraid he might fall into a reality trap if he did. This was not a life he wanted to stick around in for too long.<br />
<br />
He found a machine and started doing dead lifts. The gym was sadly heavily occupied today and two anthros-a buff tiger he’d recognized from one of the posters in the hallway and an equally buff bull terrier. BnL grit his teeth, his erection straining his work out shorts and clearly visible. He switched an incline lift, hoping the angle would conceal his boner.<br />
<br />
“Hey bro, need a spotter?” The tiger asked.<br />
<br />
BnL realized both the anthros had sauntered up aside him as he was willing his boner away.<br />
<br />
The tiger’s fur glistened with sweat, bulge threatening to slip free of his very tight shorts. BnL could practically taste his musk on the air. Next to him stood the bull terrier, muscles slick with sweat and hair wild and messy from exertion. They were wearing matching wedding bands.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, we’d love to help a cutie like you.” The bull terrier winked.<br />
<br />
BnL flushed, wondering if Tex had changed them, considering how jacked they both are. Lenny crossed his legs and nodded. He lay back on the bench. They got close, the tiger’s bulge right in front of his face, forcing him to smell his warm musk as BnL lifted weights. The bull terrier cheered him on as Lenny asked him to put more and more weight on it.<br />
<br />
A hundred reps in, his mind was going crazy. The terrier was whispering things into his ear. How he wanted to take him upstairs to their apartment and spitroast him like a little whore. His will power almost broke then, cock leaking precum and filling the air around them with his musk. They sniffed the air appreciatively.<br />
<br />
“Guys, I really need to focus. I’m just here to work out and get my head right so I can fix things with my wife and-.” Lenny’s sentence cut off as the tiger’s bulge bumped his nose gently. Lenny’s tongue betrayed him, licking the bulge, making the tiger yelp in surprise. Lenny put the weights down. “Bro, I’m so sorry, I wasn’t thinking straight, I’ve been so horned up lately!”<br />
<br />
The couple looked at each other and chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Feeling hot and bothered?” The tiger asked.<br />
<br />
Lenny nodded desperately.<br />
<br />
“Wanna come up to our place and put those muscles of yours to use?” The bull terrier asked.<br />
<br />
Lenny’s cock throbbed and he nodded again.<br />
<br />
The two weightlifters looked at each other...and laughed in Lenny&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
“Sorry!” The tiger waved his wedding band. “I’m married!”<br />
<br />
“Me too!” The bull terrier chuckled, seeing BnL’s face twist into frustrated horror.<br />
<br />
“B-but, you-!” BnL choked out a sob. “You-!”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, we don’t do straight guys.” The tiger sneered, his erection bulging. “But we love to tease them.”<br />
<br />
“Think about us tonight, pal.” The bull terrier high five’d the tiger and they went up the stairs to their apartment. “Maybe she’ll finally put out?”<br />
<br />
BnL stood there, dumbfounded at first, and then fuming. He recognized the bull terrier now. He was the owner of this gym. And a huge cock-tease. He was so horny he wanted to cry.<br />
<br />
He got a text from his wife, Shelly. The kids were on a school trip but would be stuck in a hotel overnight because there was a heavy storm in the National Park they were in. BnL ground his teeth. Whenever the kids were gone, that was when things got worse. Shelly tried to be nice for the sake of the kids.<br />
<br />
BnL drove home, feeling the dread come back. Up ahead on the mountains he could actually see the roiling storm clouds that had trapped his children at a lodge. He caught sight of his brother and Tex out walking, talking to eachother, both taking turns holding the book. <br />
<br />
People loved him now. Err, they loved LnB. BnL was hated, people ducking away around corners when they saw him, crossing the road. And here they were, living their best life, smiling and waving and getting waved at in return.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck!?” BnL’s clawed paws clenched against he steering wheel.<br />
<br />
Lenny felt tears drip down his face. He wanted that. He deserved that. He’d saved the town from a serial killer! Now Benny and Tex were friends?<br />
<br />
He sped home, angry, hurt, pent up. That fucking bitch had better not have made dinner early today. He was sick and tired of playing pretend. Fuck this.<br />
<br />
BnL pulled up into his drive. Five minutes early, actually. He walked in, opened then door, and saw Shelly, her voluptuous bear body sitting away from him at the table. Her posture was stiff. Dinner was cold. Again.<br />
<br />
“Hey honey.” BnL ground out.<br />
<br />
“Is that all you have to say to me? ‘Hey’?” Shelly growled. “I text you that our kids are trapped up on a mountain in a storm and all you say is ‘ok’?”<br />
<br />
“You always find something, don’t you?” BnL snarled and advanced towards her. “It’s always fucking something with you! Why is my dinner fucking cold again, dear?”<br />
<br />
“Because the kids come home hungry!” His wife stood and threw the plate at him. “It’s not my fault you’re home late!”<br />
<br />
“Bitch I’m home at fucking seven every goddamn night! You wanna talk to me about late? You don’t work, Shelly. I do. I pay for everything!” BnL swept his arm across the room. “This house, your dress. Me!”<br />
<br />
“You don’t love me anymore!” Shelly blurted, sobbing.<br />
<br />
“Of course I lo-” The word stuck in his throat. He swallowed and pulled down his pants, his erection, which had been raging since the gym, bobbed heavily in the air. “See! I’ve never been so goddamn hard in my life!”<br />
<br />
Shelly eyed it. “But-”<br />
<br />
BnL strode over, picked Shelly up and dragged her upstairs. She squirmed a bit as he did, but he was sick and tired of being horny and angry and sad and he was determined to fuck someone around here. He threw her on the bed and ripped her dress away with one swiped of his claws.<br />
<br />
“This-this isn’t like you!” Shelly wriggled. <br />
<br />
Lenny snarled and plunged his snout into her clunge, tasting her juices. She moaned. His tongue dug in deep into her folds, licking, cleaning her out. Her pussy swelled as he stimulated her, folds clinging to the invader. Juices began to flow, sweet, sticky, and he lapped her honey greedily.<br />
<br />
It didn’t matter that she was a woman. She had a hole and she was there. He picked her up, unable to hold back any more, long meaty ursine cock throbbing, and impaled her on his shaft with a loud squelch. Shelly whimpered and teased a nipple. The action entranced him and, as he thrust up and down into her, he bent over and lapped and suckled on one stiff nipple.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bastard!&quot; Shelly slapped him across the muzzle, claws drawing blood. &quot;You think you can just-just fuck me with that big cock of yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t like it?&quot; BnL snarled. &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you stop me then?&quot;<br />
<br />
He pulled out and thrust back as she growled and clawed at his back. She squirmed, biting and clawing, and tried to get out from under him. He grabbed her arms and pinned them to the bed and kept thrusting. <br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; She panted, breathless, &quot;You fu-....you fucking brute!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just shut up and take it you little slut!&quot; BnL growled in her ear and kept thrusting.<br />
<br />
Shelly wasn&#39;t fighting. She was moaning, happily bouncing up and down on his ursine shaft. He flicked and licked at her nipples, rage and lust warring inside him. His licks rose higher, nuzzling into the crook of her neck. Her arms encircled him and he held her close.<br />
<br />
“I want another baby.” Shelly whispered into his ear.<br />
<br />
BnL blinked and stared down at her, his cock stretching her nether lips and her head cocked coyly to one side and realized she was beautiful. It was an odd thought that left him completely off guard. He…he was gay, he wasn’t into this, why was she turning him on so much?<br />
<br />
Her paw traced along his back as she waited for a response, smiling.<br />
<br />
Lenny shook his head, closing his eyes. Was this some sort of reality shift? Was he losing himself?<br />
<br />
His cock was throbbing stiffly inside her and she gave it a gentle squeeze with her inner walls. Lenny’s tongue lolled out. Aw fuck that felt good! More squeezes from muscles in her inner walls, her hips flexing coaxingly. He tried to withdraw but she clamped down and that just made it feel better.<br />
<br />
Lenny-no Benny needed to concentrate, not let her distract him. But he couldn’t help himself and bucked back, softly. She smiled and squeezed some more. He bucked again, harder, enjoying the squeeze, and again and again. He picked up the tempo, knowing he might be dooming himself to never seeing his boyfriend again.<br />
<br />
Boyfriend? He tried to picture who that might be. The only thing that came up was his partner, Rusty, but his twin brother was dating him. Honestly, Lenny wasn’t sure what was so attractive about the guy. Muscles were a dime a dozen in this town.<br />
<br />
His wife moaned and flexed against his turgid cock and Lenny shifted his attention to her and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Fill up mama bear, baby.” Shelly breathed. <br />
<br />
Lenny snarled in response and began to thrust into her, hard, making her moan and clench her toes and kncok a picture frame off the wall. He nuzzled her neck, licked her tits, and bounced her up and down on his cock. He picked her up, held her tight, and rocked. In and out, in and out, throwing her to the bed and thrusting her hard enough the backboard slammed into the wall, mind awash in pleasure and lust and need, knowing he must be losing his mind and if he came he&#39;d be just some fat family bear-<br />
<br />
“Ooo, that’s it big bear, ah, ah!” His wife’s pussy clenched and spasmed around his cock, eyes rolling her head as she was overtaken by a massive orgasm.<br />
<br />
The clenching was too much for Lenny, he couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore. His desires and conflicted mind boiled over in a overwhelming surge of lust and excitment. He roared and thrust deep inside her as his orgasm shook him and his cock pumped spurt after spurt of baby batter into her womb.<br />
<br />
They fell back in bed togather, sweaty, happy.<br />
<br />
“I love you.” Shelly smiled and rubbed his gut, making his cock twitch.<br />
<br />
“I…love you too.” Lenny smiled back and kissed her.<br />
<br />
They rolled over and began fucking again.<br />
<br />
-___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Six months later and life was normal for him. He got up, smelling coffee. Shelly made him and the kids breakfast, they kissed and he rubbed her pregnant belly, he dropped the kids off at school. <br />
<br />
Normally, he&#39;d drive a few blocks to the police station. Today he decided to take a walk. He needed it now, after not going to the gym anymore. Lenny&#39;s gut jiggled with each step he took, but his increasingly soft form wasn&#39;t bothering him. He just wanted to get the day over with so he could go home and be with his wife and kids.<br />
<br />
He was rounding the corner of a park near his work when he bumped into Tex, the big bull man, and Benny, his twin brother. They stared at each other for a moment. It had been a while since Lenny had seen them. They’d headed to California without so much as a word and, well...they were back now, he guessed. He&#39;d been too busy to worry too much about them.<br />
<br />
“You, uh, gained some weight there bro.” Benny eyed his flabby, out-of-shape form. God, even his muscles seemed deflated.<br />
<br />
“Wife’s cooking.” Lenny smiled sheepishly and patted his big wobbly gut. “Says she needs a big bear in bed with her.”<br />
<br />
“Dadbod looks good on you.” Benny smiled. “Guess family life is suiting you just fine?”<br />
<br />
“We’ve got a third on the way.” Lenny grinned. &quot;And, uh, I quit patrolling. I&#39;m at a desk job now. 8 hours instead of twelve, so I can see my family more.&quot;<br />
<br />
“Congratulations!” Tex said. “Gotta ask one thing. Do you remember a Book of Beasts?”<br />
<br />
Lenny crinkled his snout. “Doesn’t sound like anything I’ve ever heard of.”<br />
<br />
Benny and Tex exchanged knowing glances.<br />
<br />
“Uh, should I?” Lenny asked, glancing between the two of them.<br />
<br />
“Nope.” Benny said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Is there anything you&#39;d change about yourself?&quot; Tex asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a wife I love and two great kids.&quot; Lenny chuckled, body jiggling. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t change it for the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tex and Benny smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Take it easy Lenny.&quot; Tex said.<br />
<br />
“Have a good day, bro!” Benny waved.<br />
<br />
They left. Officer Lenny Schroeder chuckled and shook his head. What a strange couple of guys.<br />
<br />
This is a BAD? END</p>
