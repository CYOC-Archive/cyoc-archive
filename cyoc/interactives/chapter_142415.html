<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty struck off on his own on a royal mission. In the meantime, Camille was left alone to her own devices. She was so far from the original self she had started the day with that it felt almost like a lifetime had passed. The matriarch toured her own creation and reached the end of the treeline, looking out into an open field and endless possibilities in the valley, miles of land, and unlimited potential. She pictured a life of peace and fulfilment by Ty&#39;s side, a thriving community of animal people untouched and safe from the cruelty of man. An entire hidden world for them to live in, work in, and play in. Perhaps more.<br />
<br />
Camille returned to the depths of her jungle-like forest, rich with plant life and colours, and fashioned a stone throne for herself to sit upon, rolling out a carpet of red flowers on the grass in front of it. With that done, the queen kicked up her hooves and waited for Ty to return. Her vision could wait. She was immortal, after all. She had a clear sense that time was irrelevant and patience was a virtue.<br />
<br />
Sitting on her throne, she began to recall the day&#39;s events. She smiled at fond memories of gaining her sentience. The sex. Ty. Her ascension to goddess-dom. The sex. Ty changing in her hands. Literally growing in her grasp. The last thought made her particularly wet. She had enjoyed effecting a transformation. Apparently it did something for her. She pictured the growing trees, the wild plants, watching things grow and change before her eyes. She closed her eyes and began to fantasize about changing other animals. Growing them big. Shrinking them small. Holding entire living beings in her hand. Her fingers fell to the panties covering her shame and she began to stroke the outside of her pussy through them. She imagined sexy quadrupeds turning to bipedal anthros. Raising a creature&#39;s intelligence. Making them dumb and submissive. She had a particularly lovely vision of taking a big strong animal and making them even bigger. Bulging muscles. She played through a million different forms and changes in her mind. She began to thrust into her own hand and bite her lip. She was so horny. She wanted to change something. Ty had been fun, but she knew he could do the same. She wanted to take a helpless animal and transform it into something like her. Make a companion and friend. Give it the gift of purpose. Of awareness.<br />
<br />
The doe left herself hot and bothered and stretched on the throne, yawning. She waited for Ty. It was turning into early evening and crickets began to chirp across the valley. The doe heard the vague movement of birds in her trees above. She sensed life in a way that she couldn&#39;t before. Felt essence nearby. Energy. She felt the pool of her own powers flowing through her like a constant mist, begging to be used. She smiled.<br />
<br />
A sudden movement caught her interest.<br />
<br />
In the trees above, Camille looked up to see a single black crow hopping from branch to branch. She felt the urge to experiment. She wasn&#39;t going to take creating a new being lightly, either. She felt the responsibility of bringing new life into the world. It was something, in her new guise, that meant everything to her. Creating had consequences. She needed to make sure she was doing things that would do good instead of harm.<br />
<br />
Creating a new sentient animal was not going to hurt anything.<br />
<br />
Concentrating, she held out her hand and willed the crow to fly down. To the deer&#39;s surprise, exactly that happened. The crow fluttered its wings and floated down right into Camille&#39;s palm, landing its taloned feet gently and standing. She blinked at the crow and observed it carefully, feeling its essence, its hidden personality. The crow stared back with a strange intelligent nothingness. Clever for a bird but uncomprehending. Unrefined. It made Camille feel oddly uncomfortable. She remembered her old life and how she had been a whim to instincts and actions. Never able to really think or reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;You poor thing.&quot; Camille whispered. &quot;You don&#39;t know yourself yet. You don&#39;t know what it is like to know, and think, and dream. And feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crow stared back and cocked its head to the side, disinterested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s start by raising your intelligence. You&#39;re already such a smart bird, aren&#39;t you? Let&#39;s help you evolve.&quot;<br />
<br />
Camille held her other hand over the crow carefully and marvelled as a strange gold mist emerged from her fingertips. She hovered her hand over the crow and watched as it was magically engulfed in Camille&#39;s power. The crow dropped its head, closed its eyes, and let out a startled squawk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s ok. It would hurt long, I promise. I promise, darling.&quot; The doe gently caressed the bird&#39;s head and watched it relax as its mind began to grow like hers had.<br />
<br />
&quot;Theeere.&quot; Camille willed the changes to continue. The bird was growing smarter. The crow shot its dark eyes open and looked around frantically, darting its beak this way and that nervously, starting to grow uneven and dizzy in the palm of Camille&#39;s giant furry hand.<br />
<br />
The deer watched in amazement and could *feel* the animal&#39;s intelligence raising to human levels. The crow squawked and began to writhe. Camille remembered the discomfort of her brain changing. She gently reassured the crow with gentle petting. At last, her golden magic seemed to fade away, and Camille stared down at the tiny bird in her hand.<br />
<br />
The crow&#39;s eyes widened and it looked at the deer. It looked back at itself, then around the area. It looked back at Camille, and its eyes seemed to warm ever so slightly in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, little one.&quot; Camille said softly, gently stroking the soft feathers on the crow&#39;s back and wings. &quot;Welcome to your new life. I&#39;m Camille. I made you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The crow blinked several times, cocked its head, and nodded in the affirmative. It squawked and trilled, but Camille was no more capable of understanding bird speech than she had been prior.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t speak your language. Would you like it if I gave you the ability to speak, like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
The bird seemed amused, pulling its head back, and to Camille&#39;s sudden surprise, it spoke. In a voice resembling a parrot, more mimicry of a human voice than an actual human voice, the crow announced itself. &quot;Can speak!&quot; It rasped. &quot;Hello to Camille!&quot;<br />
<br />
The deer chuckled and the crow smiled with its eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; The doe apologized, patting the bird&#39;s head. &quot;How wrong of me to assume that you couldn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is fine.&quot; The bird seemed to shrug its wings. Camille picked up a hint of feminimity in the bird&#39;s strange voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a lady?&quot; Camille asked curiously. Totally unfamiliar with avian biology, she really had no idea. Even as a normal deer she knew nothing about birds. She had seen them. They tended to ignore her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; The crow nodded. &quot;Am mom!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh!&quot; Camille smiled warmly. &quot;You have children?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes!&quot; The crow nodded. &quot;Can Camille make babies like me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, my friend!&quot; The deer nodded empathetically. &quot;Of course I can make your children intelligent, as well! Can you take me to your nest?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes!&quot; The crow hopped excitedly. &quot;Camille follows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Certainly!&quot; The queen rose from her throne and held out the crow, who promptly flew up to a nearby branch and watched the deer stand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Follow!&quot; The crow announced, and fluttered off the branch and began to circle the deer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m right behind you!&quot; The deer called, and with that she began to set off on a new adventure.</p>
