<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Norm looked over the map and decided to go to the kangaroo exhibit. There was something about the creatures that he found intriguing.</p>

<p>He followed the trail and signs through crowds of people of all ages. It seemed as though the closer he got to the exhibit, the more anxious he was.</p>

<p>Arriving soon after, he put his hands on the railing of the wall surrounding it. The enclosure was huge, with plenty of room for the kangaroos to hop. There were a few lying in the shade of the trees while others hopped in the distance.</p>

<p>Norm watched them with a smile on his face. They seemed so content with themselves. They were happy to live this way. Norm wondered how they could be happy without all of the modern conveniences of human society. He envied them in a way; so ignorant yet so happy. He wondered what it would be like to exist like that.</p>

<p>"Sir, would you be interested in meeting one of them?" a voice asked.</p>

<p>Norm looked to his right and saw a young woman wearing the clothes of an attendant. She seemed to be in her mid twenties. She had a light Australian accent. Norm found that cute, all things considered. Her hair flowed down her head over her shoulders but she'd tied it back. Her skin had a nice tan. Her green eyes gazed at him. She was a little shorter then he.</p>

<p>"Meeting one of them?" This couldn’t be right; this wasn’t a petting zoo!</p>

<p>The attendant nodded and smiled. "Yes, I'm sure they'd love someone else to play with."</p>

<p>"Um ... okay," Norm said.</p>

<p>The attendant beamed and took Norm's right arm. She led him along the side the habitat and into a small one story building. Inside, she led him down a flight of stairs and into a large room at least as long as a football field. It had a set of double doors at the end of it.</p>

<p>"Does that lead out to the habitat?" Norm asked.</p>

<p>The attendant nodded. "First, let's get some food for them."</p>

<p>She led Norm into a side room and closed the door behind them. The room was about the size of a recroom.</p>

<p>The attendant nodded. "Yep, you'll do perfectly," she said as she looked him over.</p>

<p>Norm started feeling a little nervous. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Before him, the attendant took off the jacket of her uniform, leaving her in a black skirt and white blouse. Reaching back, she undid her hair and shook her head, allowing her hair to flow free.</p>

<p>A sweet scent filled the room and Norm couldn’t help but take it in. He wasn’t sure exactly where it was coming from.</p>

<p>He watched the young woman before him. She was starting to undo her blouse.</p>

<p>"Whoa, what's going on here?"</p>

<p>Absentmindedly, Norm scratched his right arm, the limb having suddenly grown itchy. The attendant had unbuttoned her blouse and was in the process of removing it. Norm couldn’t help but stare at her chest. He wanted her to also remove her bra. Both of his arms were now itching and the sweet scene was getting stronger.</p>

<p>Norm felt a familiar bulge in his pants, this was crazy, a beautiful woman as undressing before him and they were alone. Norm couldn’t help but wonder just what was going on? Was this some sort of gag?</p>

<p>The itching had spread to his chest and the room seemed to be getting warmer.</p>

<p>The attendant reached back and undid her bra, allowing it to fall off. Norm stared at her, unsure if to be aroused or afraid.</p>

<p>Now his entire torso was itching. He felt a desperate need to take off his shirt and acted on it. He threw it to the ground only to gasp when he saw that his chest was covered in orange fur.</p>

<p>He looked back at the woman and saw orange fur sprouting all over her chest, arms and the rest of her torso. She was smiling as though she was enjoying it.</p>

<p>"This is too weird, I'm outta here!" Norm said.</p>

<p>He ran for the door but when grasped the handle, he found it locked from the outside. Looking back at the attendant, haw saw her sliding her skirt down legs that were becoming furry.</p>

<p>The sweet smell was becoming stronger and Norm found that he was still excited. He let go of the door handle and turned around.</p>

<p>"Why are you ... how are you ... I ... gotta ... get out of here!"</p>

<p>"Relax, enjoy it while it lasts. I was one of those roos. I'll soon be again, we'll soon be ... friends."</p>

<p>Norm looked back and forth, desperate for a way out. The attendant's body was still more or less human shaped. Orange fur now covered it and she had removed all of her clothing.</p>

<p>Laughing at the absurdity of the situation, Norm undid his jeans, slid them down his legs, removed his shoes and stepped out of both. He'd done it without thinking, almost as if operating on instinct. He still had his underwear on and despite his fear, he was still excited.</p>

<p>Before him, the attendant’s body was quickly taking on an increasingly less human shape. Norm watched her sprout a tail as her human hair fell out. Her feet increased in side, as did her thighs and hips. Her breasts were shriking into her chest and would soon be non-existant.</p>

<p>"This isn't what I meant by see the kangaroos. Wait a second, I'm almost naked!" Norm said. He tried to cover himself and what was now a kangaroo woman laughed. "Why try to cover yourself mate? Soon, it'll be open for the whole world to see. Have fun with this ... let go!"</p>

<p>Norm's body had been itchy the entire time. He looked down to see that orange fur had indeed covered him as it had covered her as well. Shrugging his shoulders in a resignation to the inevitable, he removed his underwear and socks.</p>

<p>"See, much better! Embrace it!" the attendant, said. By this point, she was starting to slouch over. Any humanity left in her body was quickly melting away to make way for a more kangaroo like shape.</p>

<p>"But what about my life?" Norm asked.</p>

<p>"This is much better."</p>

<p>Norm felt a sharp pain above his buttocks. Something seemed to pull against his tailbone. Said bone soon earned its name when a large kangaroo tail almost erupted from it. Norm heard and felt it thump against the cool floor. He reached around and felt it just as his feet and hips began to ache.</p>

<p>As he was touching it, he heard something touch the ground in front of him followed by a clicking noise. He turned to see a kangaroo, the former attendant standing before him. She looked into his eyes with her black eyes.</p>

<p>"Easy!" Norm said.</p>

<p>He grimaced as he felt his hips begin to expand. His feet started aching next. He had a tail, was covered in fur and now his hips and feet were changing!</p>

<p>The kangaroo now stood beside him, she began touching his chest. Norm still felt excited, something his body was making evident. He wasn’t sure what was causing it but something within the recesses of his mind seemed to be enjoying this!</p>

<p>“This wasn’t that I meant by meet the kangaroos! I didn’t want to do that by becoming one of them!”</p>

<p>Norm tried to fight the next thoughts that popped into his head but they flowed naturally.</p>

<p><i>But isn’t the best way to get to know something by becoming it?</i></p>

<p>Even as Norm felt his waist and feet expanding, he tried backing off only to fall back into his tail. The female kangaroo clicked and grabbed Norm’s legs. He looked at her and tried to resist the view he was giving her.</p>

<p><i>No, I’m not supposed to enjoy this; am I?</i></p>

<p>Norm watched his manhood twist and change into the equipment of a male kangaroo before it settled into his new sheath. He had to cringe at that. Was this animal actually interested in him? Normal wanted to deny what else he saw but couldn’t. His hips, legs and feet were those of a kangaroo. <i>At least I don’t have a pouch!</i></p>

<p>Now the changes spread up unto his torso. Norm felt his internal organs gurgle as his ribcage resized itself. The process didn’t hurt, but it was freaky to watch his body change!</p>

<p>Or was it freaky? Norm couldn’t help but wonder how neat it would be to hop around without a shred of clothing on. <i>Did I just think that?</i> Now, such thoughts were flowing into his mind freely. If they were caged before, this kangaroo (or whatever he was supposed to call her) had provided the key.</p>

<p>Norm couldn’t help but picture himself hopping free of human worry and constraint. This female would help guide him in his learning about what would soon be his new form.</p>

<p><i>No, she’s brainwashing me? Or is she?</i></p>

<p>Norm had after all, walked to the exhibit on his own free will. He had wondered what being a kangaroo was like just before she’d approached him.</p>

<p>Was it okay for him to let go?</p>

<p>Now, even his torso looked like hers, albeit a larger version. His arms were shrinking and his thumbs were quivering as they began to journey into fifth digits. His fingernails were starting to grow into black claws.</p>

<p><i>Spend my days hopping and laying about? Free food, medical and no predators? Sound good to me!</i></p>

<p>Whatever resistance Norm had was quickly fading away. His arms and hands now appeared as those of the marsupial he was soon to be. The female kangaroo turned and hoped a single bound back as Norm balanced himself back into his feet.</p>

<p><i>Look at how big these things are. Big feet are cool! Now I get to be the kangaroo instead of just watching them. This is so weird but so wild!</i></p>

<p>The change marched up onto his head. His jaw, nose and entire face started to change. Norm had to close his eyes as he felt new ears grow while his old ones were absorbed by his skull. His jaw and nose pushed out onto a muzzle. His vocal chords vanished, leaving him with clicking and grunting as his only communication method.</p>

<p><i>This sucks, I can’t talk. But who cares, clicking is fun!</i></p>

<p>He started clicking as he opened his eyes, now looking at the world through the eyes of his new species. He could see his muzzle. Feeling around his head, he felt his new large ears atop his head. There was no trace of his human hair, just kangaroo fur.</p>

<p>It seemed complete, Norm was a kangaroo.</p>

<p><i>Okay, so what happens now?</i></p></p>
