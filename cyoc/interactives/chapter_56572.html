<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While the visitors made new friends with the dorm girls, Josh slept on.  Everyone seemed to ignore the body that sprawled on the couch.  Everyone except for the mermaid.<br />
<br />
Her name was Cindy and she was a pre-med student.  Swiveling in her chair awkwardly Cindy pushed herself up to a standing position.  The magic transformation that had taken her legs from her retreated a little.  The delicate fish fins reformed to her feet once she desired to stand but her legs were still merged from her hips to her ankles.  Cindy looked past her obstructing breasts to view her body.  From her waist down she was bluish-green and delicately scaled.  Mike had told her that even though she would become a mermaid he would not force her to crawl on dry land.<br />
<br />
Cindy just had to trust the jerk that had turned her into a slutty mermaid.  &quot;Just lean forward and take a step,&quot; he had said.  &quot;Your legs will separate.  A little at first but a more and more as you walk.&quot;  When Cindy had first tried to take a step to get to the common room she had leaned too far and fell to the ground.  Not trusting herself on the stairs, Cindy had slithered down the stairs on her bottom like a little girl.  But now she was going to get used to her new life.<br />
<br />
Holding her body upright, Cindy twisted her body to place one foot forward.  Twisting the other way she found she could put the second foot slightly farther ahead.  Hobbled though she was, Cindy was determined to make it across the room.  On the next step she could feel her legs pulling apart a little.  It was as if her limbs had been dipped in a sticky liquid.  As she made to walk the liquid pulled apart into two slick, heavy pant legs.  Two steps more and her legs were separated up to her knees.  Now her tail was little more than a tight skirt.<br />
<br />
Cindy made two more steps and now she sported nothing more than a pair of tights.  Tights that were glittery and skin tight because they were her actual skin.  Cindy strode forward on long, shapely legs.  Having mastered her body she suddenly felt like reveling in her new body.  As she walked she tossed her long red locks over a shoulder and let her large breasts sway for all to see.  Cindy was not going to let what Mike had done to her change how she felt about her own body.<br />
<br />
When she got to the couch Cindy stopped.  In a single moment as she stood her legs once again returned to her tail form.  As quickly as they had spread, she found them once again merging to form the single tail.  Cindy tried to fight it but she could not spread her legs.  Once she was again standing with her legs bound to the ankle she could barely hold upright.  Wobbly, she stood tall hoping that her tail would still support her.  She noticed that her journey across the room had drawn some attention from the crowd.  Cindy really wanted to keep from being embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got help this boy,&quot; she said in an overly dramatic manner.  For some reason it just felt right to talk like a character from some cheesy medical drama.  &quot;You!  Get me a damp cloth.  Quickly!&quot; Cindy said pointing to a dorm resident that was unfortunately dressed like rabbit.<br />
<br />
The busty bunny cowered for a moment before realizing that Cindy was not going to hurt her.  Then she nodded meekly causing her long, floppy ears to bounce absurdly.  She turned and rushed to fulfill the order given her letting everyone see the cute, cotton-ball-like tail that Mike had given her.<br />
<br />
Cindy then turned her attention back to the boy on the couch.  She leaned over him, bending at the waist.  Somehow she suspected that if she bent her knees the magic might consider her to be trying to sit and would take them away.  Then she would find herself with a flexible fish tail and no way to stand.  Cindy chose to lean with one arm on the back of the couch to support her as she examined the boy.  She took his pulse and felt his head.  There did not appear to be anything wrong with him.  Her examination was made more difficult with her large breasts and long hair hanging down in the way.<br />
<br />
In frustration she made a motion to brush her hair back and to hold her breasts still.  Unfortunately that required her to use both arms.  Suddenly, Cindy found herself pitched forward and falling onto the patient.  She landed awkwardly smothering the poor unconscious boy with her massive breasts.  As she tried to wiggle off, she felt her feet slip back into fin-form and now her wiggling became writhing.  Cindy's slippery smooth skin wiggled about on the boy's body madly, until she found herself somehow wedged between the boy and the back of the couch.  Coming to rest she was now snuggled up close to the young man as they lay intertwined on the couch.<br />
<br />
A wet splat landed on her breast and Cindy found the wash cloth she had requested.  Looking up she found the docile bunny-girl kneeling beside the couple resting her own flawless hooters on the boy's other arm.  Cindy stared deeply into the other girl's large, vaguely vapid eyes and felt pity for this freshman.  She was a new transfer to the college just last week and Cindy did not even properly know the girl's name.  She just happened to be here to receive the wrath of Mike.  Now she was compelled to be a cute, meek, slutty bunny-girl.  The girl smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cindy?  I've brought what you wanted, madam,&quot; the girl said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank-you.&quot;  Cindy moved the wet cloth from her boob and placed it on the boy's forehead.  Then she reached out for the bunny to help her.  &quot;Pull me up, uhh, what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
The bunny knelt up letting her breasts bounce wildly.  &quot;I'm Sammy,&quot; she smiled.  Then she took Cindy's hand and tried to pull her out.  With a little tug, Cindy was once again laying over the boy.  Her lithe body was still wedge tight and Cindy struggled to get over the limp body holding her in place.<br />
<br />
It was then that Sammy placed one hand on Cindy's shoulder stopping her struggle.  With her other hand she brushed the long red hair from Cindy's face.  Then Sammy leaned in and placed her lips on Cindy's.<br />
<br />
Cindy had never kissed a girl before.  She was too shocked to do anything but let Sammy continue.  Sammy kissed her and Cindy felt a magical tingle run through her body.  It raced down her spine to her groin and tingled at her clit.  There was a lovely taste on her mouth and Cindy wanted to lick it.  She parted her lips and slid her tongue out only to find Sammy's there also.  The feelings intensified and Cindy felt herself rising quickly to a sudden orgasm.  The magic in Sammy's lips rushed to play with Cindy's privates.  It tingled at her lips and made her brain almost shut down.  Then, just as Cindy was about to start moaning and just as she was about to go over the edge, Sammy pulled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Cindy pleaded.  The magic that Sammy had given her remained on her lips and down her spine and touching her between her merged legs.  It did not lessen or grow stronger but it remained teasing Cindy on the edge of orgasm.  Her nipples grew stiff.  She licked at her lips and ground her hips against the boy trying to stimulate her self.  It added a little to the overall effect but it did not help to finish the job that Sammy had started.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, Cindy,&quot; Sammy said.  &quot;But if someone thanks me for doing a favor I have to kiss them.  Mike made it so.  It's a special magical kiss.  I hope the effects don't last too long.  Mike didn't tell me anything about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cindy did moan now.  Her lips felt like they were swollen with passion.  Her crotch was a ball of pink, flaming pleasure and she could not do anything to stop it.  Then she felt a movement below her.  She turned her head and found the boy looking up at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh.  Hi,&quot; the boy said.<br />
<br />
Cindy just gawked at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're awake,&quot; Sammy cheered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess.  Thanks for helping me,&quot; Josh said.<br />
<br />
He may have been talking to the fish girl laying on top of him, but Sammy thought he was talking to her.  She leaned in and kissed Josh as Cindy looked on lost in her own little world of pleasure.</p>
