<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny waited at the bus stop next to her twin sister. She looked down at another girl, about 8 years old, waiting next to her. The girl wore a traditional Catholic schoolgirl uniform: grey, green, and blue plaid pleated skirt; white blouse covered by a V-neck navy blue sweater; white knee-high stockings; and a pair of shiny black Mary Jane&#39;s. The girl was the very picture of innocence.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked to her other side at Jaime, her twin. She wore the same uniform, only Jamie looked anything but innocent in it. Of course, it was a much larger size to accommodate Jamie&#39;s grown up body. Jenny guessed it was probably bought in a size tailored for a high school girl. It was too small, though, in a few notable places where Jamie was unusually big. For instance, her white blouse and sweater were stretched tightly over her chest. Jamie had left her top button open to ease some of the strain, which showed off only the merest trace of cleavage. The skirt seemed a bit too short as well, although if anyone checked, they would probably find that it was just barely four fingers above the knee per regulations. Jamie also wore a pair of shiny black Mary Jane&#39;s, although hers were the chunky style with a one inch platform and three inch heels, definitely more along the lines of a Lolita-style Goth outfit than a Catholic schoolgirl. The heel helped to add a little more height to Jamie&#39;s already long legs and to push out her butt a bit further, accentuating its above average size and roundness. No doubt, her body below the neck would be a wet dream for many guys. Still, her face was young, pure, and innocent, with her long straight hair done back in a navy Alice band.<br />
<br />
Jenny looked down and saw an exact duplicate of Jamie&#39;s body below her including the chunky Mary Jane&#39;s pushing out her butt and the undone top button showing off the merest trace of cleavage, which was much more obvious a line when seen from above.<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are we wearing these shoes?&quot; she asked her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we can,&quot; Jamie said and smirked. She cocked a hip out to the side seductively and rested a hand on it. &quot;We told them that these were the only Mary Jane&#39;s we could find that fit, remember?&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, I remember,&quot; Jenny said. &quot;Lucky us that we can get away with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep,&quot; Jamie replied, satisfied.<br />
<br />
Jenny sighed again. Why did it have to be Catholic school? she thought.<br />
<br />
Her body would be sexy enough already without adding a Catholic schoolgirl fetish outfit to it. And, it was a warm spring morning too. She couldn&#39;t even use the cold as an excuse to cover up with a coat. In fact, her sweater sleeves were already rolled up to keep her cool.<br />
<br />
She clumsily adjusted her bra, trying to get her huge tits to rest a little better in it, and decided that she would never get used to wearing it.<br />
<br />
DD-cups, you had to make them huge, didn&#39;t you? she thought.<br />
<br />
The bra always felt slightly uncomfortable however she adjusted herself. All of that tender weight on her chest just felt awkwardly constrained inside a bra. Though, the alternative, bouncing around loose all day in 5th grade, was out of the question and definitely worse.<br />
<br />
The big yellow school bus rounded a corner and stopped to let them on. The girls gathered their bags up and climbed up the steps. Jenny was the last one on and stumbled a bit on the steps, silently cursing her damned heels for repeatedly tripping her up since she put them on. She followed Jaime to the back of the bus and slid into the seat next to her. Their legs were uncomfortably long for the child-sized seat. Even after rotating sideways a bit to better fit, their knees were still pressed up against the seat in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Jenny. Hi, Jamie,&quot; said a girl on the opposite side of the aisle from them. &quot;How&#39;s it going?&quot; She looked to be about 10 years old, Jenny and Jamie&#39;s age, or, at least, the age of their heads.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi, Lisa,&quot; Jamie replied. &quot;I&#39;m still super pumped about the tickets. I could hardly sleep last night I was so excited.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I bet,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;God, I&#39;m so jealous of you guys. I only wish I could go too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenny said, feeling like she needed to participate somehow. &quot;It should be amazing. I couldn’t stop thinking about him last night.&quot; Silently, she cursed how true that statement was.<br />
<br />
Next, the girls started chatting about lip gloss and fingernail polish, and Jenny lost interest. She wondered how she would be able to put up with these girly conversations for a month. Just a day ago she had been a 16-year-old boy, living an ordinary boring life. Now, she had to put up with 5th-grade-girl conversations. She sighed. Well, at least that part of her mind was unchanged. She still felt mostly like her old self inside. That is, except for… Justin appeared in her mind again, and she quickly shook her head and tried to think of something else. The last thing she wanted right now was to start having sexual fantasies on a school bus. She tried to think of anything else. She stared at the window and counted blue cars. She twiddled her thumbs. She even tried to listen in on her sister’s conversation again. That last one did the trick. Soon, her mind felt numbed by the inane prattle.<br />
<br />
Feeling comfortably bored, her eyes wandered around the bus looking at nothing in particular. Eventually, they settled on an apparently 12-year-old boy sitting a few rows up from them. He had turned into the aisle to chat with some other boys like Lisa was doing. Jenny found herself gazing at his profile, his cherubic face, his bright blond hair, his sweater sleeves rolled up, making him look casually cool. She imagined him being a lot of fun to hang out with. She imagined talking to him about stuff for hours, just random stuff, like games and TV, whatever. She wanted to know stuff about him, like what his favorite food was or what his least favorite subject in school was, stuff they could joke about and share between them. She wondered if he was ticklish. She imagined what his hand would feel like in hers. She imagined what his slim lips would feel like pressed against her own...<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it,&quot; Jenny said aloud to herself as she pulled her eyes away from the boy and covered her face in her hands. She could feel herself blushing. Her girlish imagination was taking over again. And, it was one thing for her to fantasize about pop stars. It was a whole other thing to think about boys on the same bus. She had to be more careful.<br />
<br />
When Jenny lowered her hands, she noticed that several boys and girls were staring at her curiously, including Lisa and her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jenny said to them. &quot;I was... feeling a bit sick, I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Jamie cooed and started to rub a hand on Jenny&#39;s back reassuringly. &quot;Well, we&#39;re almost there. Just try not to get carsick for a few more minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny smiled weakly and spent the rest of the trip staring at the blank expanse of the seat in front of her, while trying to forget about her feelings for cute boys.<br />
<br />
Finally, they arrived at school.</p>
