<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay dude, this is going to sound weird, but I think you have someone who&#39;s been regressed into your balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m going back over the recorded log of changes made within the last twenty four hours and it looks like...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It looks like what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude... you&#39;re supposed to be eight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Eight? Are you fucking kidding me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it says that you started this morning as an eight year old, but you started gaining years rapidly in exchange for this guy named Tanner losing them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t care, it feels like my balls are gonna burst man. I gotta do something about this. Fix it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... since making Tanner younger caused the problem in the first place... maybe making him older will fix everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever, just do something!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin pressed the age button three times, hoping that that&#39;d make Tanner a one year old, and while the age of Tanner did increase from -2 years to -9 months, when Kevin pressed the button for a third time, an error message popped up onto the screen. As Tanner&#39;s sperm &quot;aged&quot; up, Derrick groaned as his groin grew increasingly sensitive. It was almost to the point he couldn&#39;t stand it.<br />
<br />
&quot;It says that he can&#39;t get any older without a host womb.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck. You mean I gotta fuck a girl...&quot; Derrick laughed. &quot;Not that I wouldn&#39;t mind that... but I don&#39;t think getting her pregnant just after meeting her would be the best way to go about starting a relationship...&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Kevin noticed the &quot;Troubleshoot&quot; button on the error message. Curious as to what that might do, Kevin pressed it, and suddenly the Chronivac whirred to life in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s it doing?&quot; asked Derrick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m troubleshooting the error--it&#39;s looking for a suitable host womb... Fuck. That&#39;s gonna be hard, since this isn&#39;t a co-ed dorm.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the Chronivac beeped saying that it was making a suitable host womb. Before Kevin could figure out what was going on, he began to feel a pins and needle feeling all across his body. Just then he felt his shirt get awfully tight across his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... feel weird all of a sudden,&quot; said Kevin, and he turned to a mirror to see that suddenly his chest began to look like it was expanding--no, not just expanding, growing breasts! And that wasn&#39;t the only part of him that was shifting--his shoulders were starting to look a little less broad, his stubble on his face was pulling back in, leaving him smooth faced, and his hips were beginning to flare out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s going on, Kev?&quot; asked Derrick<br />
<br />
&quot;The Chro--onivac&#39;s turning me into the host mother!&quot; said Kevin as his adam&#39;s apple shrank back, causing his voice to jump up an octave or two. His hair was now beginning to grow out, as the small hairs on his arms and legs began being sucked back in to shorter levels. A cracking was heard as his hip bone stretched, adding to the width of his hips. And all through the transformation Kevin could only marvel at the changes. It wasn&#39;t until he felt an odd heat from his groin that he began to come out of the trance. His testicles were sucked back up into his body and then further in, transforming into ovaries. His scrotum lost all its hair and began pulling up and separating, becoming the labia and walls of his developing vagina that connected to the uterus and cervix that had been growing inside of him before now. Last but not least, his penis began to shrink and tuck itself inside the vagina and becoming a clitoris. Kevin--no Kevyn now, then felt that warmth begin to spread from her vagina all across her body as the final details of the transformation finished off making it so that Kevyn looked as though she&#39;d been born a woman, not just become one because the Chronivac had made it so. And as her clothes shifted to that of what she would wear, rather than what he had worn, Kevyn began to relax, knowing that ultimately if this didn&#39;t work out, she could always change things using the Chronivac again. All that mattered was getting Tanner out of Derrick, and that only meant one thing--losing her virginity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kev? Is that still you?&quot; asked Derrick--who sounded frightened. Kevyn turned around and gave her friend a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I&#39;m still me. I just...&quot; and again that warmth spread through Kevyn, causing her to have to blink as she began to see Derrick in a new light, one where he wasn&#39;t so bad--alright with that erect cock not half bad at all. If he&#39;d only just trim that beard a bit, then maybe he&#39;d look even better. Wait, did she just look over Derrick? The Chronivac must have adjusted her sexuality to try and make bringing back Tanner easier. Taking that as a hint to get on with it before the Chronivac started making any more decisions on its own, Kevyn began taking her clothes off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kev... you&#39;re killing me...&quot; groaned Derrick as he held tightly on to the bed as she slipped out of her shirt and shorts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want Tanner out of there or not?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, then you know what&#39;s going to have to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re my room mate and a dude... sure, you&#39;re a hot chick now, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
Some part of Kevyn&#39;s mind felt rather pleased at hearing herself described as &quot;hot&quot; but Kevyn tried to shake that thought out of her mind as she unclasped the bra and slipped out of her panties.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like me to use the Chronivac to make that less of an issue for you, or are you grown up enough to ignore that ?&quot; asked Kevyn testily. Where had that come from?<br />
<br />
&quot;I... uh... yes, mam,&quot; responded a shocked Derrick.<br />
<br />
Kevyn smiled, &quot;Good... then relax... I can&#39;t have you all tense. That&#39;ll just ruin everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
With a tentative start, Derrick replied, &quot;I... I think I know how to make that less of an issue.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that he stood and entered her--rather too eagerly and forcefully, causing her to squirm as her hymen was broken. Derrick, who was starting to calm down noticed this reaction and asked, &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... I... I think I just realized how painful it is for a girl the first time.&quot; Yeah, this was going to be a learning experience for Kevyn--and if the Chronivac was right about Derrick, him as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were a virgin?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not something I went around advertising, but yes... less talking now...&quot; said Kevyn as she pulled them onto the bed for a more comfortable arrangement for the main act.<br />
<br />
And slowly Derrick and Kevyn began to rock and sway--Kevyn working through the pain and Derrick trying to hold back from releasing his load too soon, and feeling rather painful himself. Finally, when he couldn&#39;t hold Tanner in him any longer, he released and felt a massive release as his churning balls emptied the remainder of Tanner into Kevyn. The experience for Kevyn wasn&#39;t as thrilling considering Derrick had came before she had.<br />
<br />
Kevyn made a mental note to herself that when she was male again, not to do that to a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm, I know that must have been a big relief to you, but do you mind continuing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... sure...&quot; said the clearly dazed Derrick as he began rhythmically moving in and out of her.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Tanner felt himself swimming--and needing to swim as fast as he could. Soon up ahead he &quot;saw&quot; a big floating orb and he knew what he had to do. Ramming his many &quot;heads&quot; against it he knew that as long as one of him fertilized the egg that he&#39;d be reborn--and then he felt his consciousness shift from the mass of sperm, to a singular sperm that had managed to burrow itself into the egg. The protective coating then was released, preventing the other sperm from penetrating, and the embryo that was Tanner moved to the wall of the uterus to begin its growth.<br />
<br />
Back with Kevyn and Derrick, Derrick had finally managed with help from Kevyn in pointing out what actually made her enjoy the experience, had come to an orgasm. It rippled through her body in a way unlike what she&#39;d felt as a guy.  Sure as a guy a certain tension and release feeling was to be expected from the body. But as a woman... god, the experience was like a full body massage in pleasure. That was the closest thing she could think of describing it. Derrick was spent, and had fallen asleep next to her. Derrick&#39;s one arm having fallen protectively across her stomach, while the other had curled its way behind her shoulders. Their legs were tangled together. Yes, this was a nice way to snuggle in--though if she could just move his arm from behind her shoulders to right behind her neck, she&#39;d be able to fall asleep.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac beeped, bringing Kevyn out of her reverie. Why had it beeped? When nothing happened for a minute or so, Kevyn told herself it was likely just saying that the transformation was likely complete or something like that. It was then that Kevyn looked down and noticed that Derrick&#39;s arm seemed to be up a little higher than normal. No, she was just imagining things. And then she saw her belly begin to push out a little more, and Derrick&#39;s arm rise again.<br />
<br />
She was pregnant! Well, of course she was pregnant, that had been expected, but she was going through her pregnancy at super speed. Feeling like she was already at the end of the first trimester, Kevyn got up from the bed while she still could. At this rate, she was going to deliver her baby before the hour was out.</p>
