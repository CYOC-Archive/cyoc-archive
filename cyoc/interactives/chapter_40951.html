<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny felt her kindergarten girl body start to shrink. Realizing that she was getting younger again, she made a last ditch lunge for the remote, but Emily was too quick for her. She simply stood up straight and held the remote up tantalizingly out of Jenny's reach.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Sweetie,&quot; said Emily. &quot;It's mine now. Enjoy your diapers.&quot;<br />
<br />
And just at that moment, as her body became younger and smaller, Jenny felt her underwear swell up into a diaper again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo!&quot; she wailed as her wobbly baby legs gave out and she plopped to her cushioned behind. The change was over, and she was a baby again.<br />
<br />
With all of her hope gone, she finally lost her composure. Jenny started to cry, big, sobbing, wailing tears. Her face was soaked in them. She could feel snot dripping out of her nose. She tried to stop herself, to act just a little more mature, but she kept bawling and wailing at the top of her little lungs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw,&quot; said Emily. She put down the remote and picked up Jenny, who felt surprisingly a bit comforted by being held in her large arms. &quot;Poor little thing. It's going to be okay. Don't worry. Our Mommy's going to take good care of you, and you'll have a big sis to look out for you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite how desperate she felt, Jenny started to calm down. It was strange. She knew she should be upset, but Emily's soothing words and the way she was gently rocking her in her arms were surprisingly reassuring to her baby body. She still felt horrified but was much less hysterical.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; said Emily wiping away Jenny's tears and snot with a little rag. &quot;Let's put you in your crib while I clean up your mess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily carried Jenny to her room and laid her in her crib. From the crib, Jenny could see the computer and the Chronovac were still there in the room. Emily sat down at the computer and started typing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; she said. &quot;First off, I'm changing my age back to 10 and making you my baby sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
As soon as she finished talking her adult body began to shrink. Her breasts deflated and her curves thinned out. Seconds later she was a girl again.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's better,&quot; she said in her higher girl voice. She frowned when she looked down at herself. &quot;I'll miss you girls.&quot; She said as she rubbed her hands over her flat chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Next,&quot; she announced. &quot;I think we should make Mom and Dad a few years younger so that it's not too weird for them to have such a young daughter. Let's say 31.&quot;<br />
<br />
A bit more typing, then she was done again. This time there was no evident change as their parents were still far away.<br />
<br />
&quot;And, finally,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I'd like this to be my room and my computer. Let's see if this thing can do a bit of moving.&quot; She clicked a few more keys and said, &quot;Ah, ha. Got it. Goodbye, Jenny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily hit a one more key, and suddenly Jenny found that she and her crib were in Emily's room, although now it was decorated for a baby girl. Everywhere she looked there was pink, from the wallpaper to the toys on the floor to the changing table. Everything felt disgustingly girly to her.<br />
<br />
The door opened, and Emily came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, sis,&quot; said Emily as she walked over and leaned her elbows on the edge of the crib. &quot;I think that's it. Thanks for the big new room and the cool computer. I'm going to have to play around a with that Chronovac thing a bit more. I've already got some interesting ideas for it. But, of course, I'll be a lot more careful with it than you were. I've already put a password on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
At that moment, Jenny felt more embarrassed than sad. Emily was right, after all. She had been careless. If she had just taken her time and thought things through a bit more, she wouldn't be in this terrible situation. She would still be a teenage boy. Hell, she would still be potty trained. Once more, she felt tears in her eyes. Already, she could tell that she would be doing a lot of crying from now on.<br />
<br />
Emily just stared at her, dispassionately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Feeling lousy?&quot; she asked. &quot;Good. You deserve it for messing around with my life like that. Maybe all this will teach you to be a better brother... or, I mean, little sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily turned and started to walk away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; she said when she reached the door. &quot;I suppose I could turn you back eventually, if you manage to be a good little girl.&quot; Jenny stopped crying and looked at her hopefully. &quot;But, not any time soon. For now, you're just going to have to get used to it.&quot; Jenny's face fell, and she began crying once more at the nightmare her life had become.<br />
<br />
And with that, Emily closed the door on Jenny and walked away.</p>
