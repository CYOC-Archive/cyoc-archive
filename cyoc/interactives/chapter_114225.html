<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Yo, wake up dude, were gonna be late!&quot;, came a booming, deep voice. Riley groaned and slowly opened his eyes. He saw Kyle yelling at him from across the room. His hair was wet and he had nothing but a towel wrapped around his waist, obviously coming just from the shower. Riley&#39;s mouth gaped open; Kyle had grown much bigger over night! His muscles were much bigger and larger, and his shoulders were incredibly wide. He had to be about 6 foot 4 and over 250 pounds. Plus, Riley saw that Kyle&#39;s chest, which the night before only had about a dozen or so hairs on it, had an absolutely thick rug now. The thick brown hairs went all the way from his neckline down to the thick trail coming up from his towel.<br />
<br />
 &quot;Oh no, we changed again!&quot;, Riley&#39;s mind thought, panicking a bit. &quot;Late for what&quot;, Riley asked his roommate, shocked to hear that his voice had dropped yet again, becoming a strong, deep baritone. Kyle laughed; &quot;Dude, nice try. We have football practice in a little bit. If were late again, you know coach will make us run laps!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Riley knew he had never played football before, let alone been on the team, but a part of his mind was telling his that it was true. &quot;Yeah sure dude. Just give me a few minutes to wake up&quot;. &quot;Sure thing, Riles, I&#39;ll be in the kitchen when your ready&quot;. With that, Kyle leaves Riley alone in the bedroom, and heads to the kitchen in just his towel.<br />
<br />
Riley, now alone, pulls his covers back to examine the &quot;damage&quot; that had occurred overnight. Riley eyes bulged out when he saw the changes! The first thing he noticed was how far his chest was barreling out; it was so much larger and muscular than before. Riley saw that his chest, too, was absolutely covered in thick, curly chest hairs. Yesterday he had only had a handful of small hairs, and now he had a jungle! Riley gasped as he saw how huge his pecs were now. As he examined his chest, his eyes were drawn to his biceps. &quot;Whoa&quot;, he said out loud. His biceps were absolutely massive now! He flexed his right arm and his bicep pushed up, making a huge mound of impressive muscle. Riley saw his pit hair bursting out as he flexed his arm. he grimaced as he noticed how bad his B.O. was this morning. He both had much more pit hair and stronger body odor than yesterday.<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s eyes followed his thick chest rug down, and saw that his stomach was totally covered in hair as well. He saw that he had a well defined 6 pack, but it was difficult to tell under all his body hair now. &quot;Jeez, I look like a freakin&#39; caveman now!&quot;, Riley muttered to himself, absentmindedly stroking his thick chest hair.<br />
<br />
It was then that he noticed that his shorts seemed to be wet. Fearing that he had wet himself, he lifted up his waste band to see. It took some effort to see past his huge jungle bush, but he saw that he didn&#39;t pee his pants. Riley had had a massive wet dream; he saw more cum than he had ever been able to produce before. Riley groaned; it was all matted and stuck in his pubic hair, and all over his cock and balls. He looked at his member and saw that too had increased quite a bit in size over the night. It was currently soft, but it seemed to be about 8 inches soft now. &quot;God, im hung now!&quot;, Riley said to himself.<br />
<br />
Scratching his face, Riley felt sandpaper thick stubble all over it. He knew he was sporting some mean stubble; he would now have to shave every single day, sometimes twice, to keep it under control.<br />
<br />
Riley put his legs down on the floor and stood up. Right away, Riley noticed everything seemed a bit further away from the ground. He ascertained that he must now be about Kyle&#39;s new height, which was a little under 6 and a half feet.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t believe the changes that had happened; he had hoped and wished last night that these changes would have gone back to normal, but they had gotten even worse! He had one of the hairiest chests he had ever seen, except his roommates, now! And now he was huge and covered in thick muscles, and had one of the largest cocks he had ever laid eyes on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Get your gear on, we need to leave in five minutes!&quot;, Kyle shouted from the kitchen. Riley saw a bag with his name on it next to his bed. He opened it up and saw football gear from his college&#39;s football team, all with his name on it. &quot;I must be on the football team!&quot;, Riley thought to himself. Not wanting to anger Kyle anymore, he hurried up and put on all his gear. Some part of his mind knew exactly how to put it all on. It all fit like a glove once it was on, however the equipment smelled like it hasn&#39;t been washed in a while. Plus, Riley&#39;s crotch was still full of sticky cum and his pits stunk to high heaven, since he didn&#39;t have time to shower. The old Riley would be appalled at this, as he was always very hygienic and never smelled bad at all. The new Riley, however, didn&#39;t care at all, and didn&#39;t mind skipping the shower.<br />
<br />
Riley was shocked at how much the changes had affected his mind, as he was now ready (and a bit excited) to go to football practice with Kyle. He had never even liked football before, at all! He walked into the kitchen and saw Kyle, dressed all in his gear. He looked even more massive all geared up. Riley thought that he must look just as big, and the thought made his huge cock plump up in his pants. &quot;Rawr, looking good stud&quot;, Kyle says, making Riley&#39;s dick get even harder. &quot;Uhh, you too, Kyle&quot;, Riley stammers, still conflicted and confused about his new crush and attraction to his formerly straight roommate. Kyle smiled and slapped him on the ass, and Riley responded by getting even harder. &quot;Let&#39;s get going dude&quot;, Kyle said as he walked out the door. Riley followed, adjusting and stuffing his half hard meat down one pant leg, trying to hide the huge thick hose of a cock.<br />
<br />
Riley locked the dorm room door behind him. He took a deep breathe, wondering what was going to happen at practice. He was desperately hoping that it didn&#39;t change him physically or mentally in anyway. He already felt like his old self was losing, that he was losing his former identity. Anything else could make it impossible for him to change back. Still, he did feel like getting a good workout in. And his new body was a perfectly built football machine. What could go wrong?</p>
