<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is too fun, I wonder what would be more fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
James had two options that he thought of. Complete the transformation or Stop it early and mess with her a bit more. Then he thought of a third option, and in that moment of time, he thought it was the best option yet. He clicked his fingers as soon as the idea popped into his mind. &quot;I&#39;ve got it&quot; he said excitingly, as he lifted the control machine&#39;s microphone to be level with his mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pause&quot;.<br />
<br />
Every part of Jess and her changing body stopped. It was like she was frozen in place. No movement, no blinking, nothing. James pulled out something from the control machine, a small SD card. James tried to hide the excitement on his face, he had never, ever, had this opportunity to do this before on a &quot;human&quot; subject. Near the doorway of the mirrored room was a computer, with a worn down, yet still functioning, keyboard. He walked, in an almost dance-like pattern, towards the computer, installed the SD card onto the computer, and rested his hands on the worn down keyboard. A screen appeared listing a couple options.<br />
<br />
ENTER NEW NAME:<br />
<br />
NEW BACKGROUND:<br />
<br />
NEW PERSONALITY:<br />
<br />
James immediately starts to write down a new personality for Jess, or whoever she would be next. He made sure not to make her like a zombie, taking orders and that&#39;s it, he wanted her to have a personality, yet give other &quot;patients&quot; a false sense of security. While James knew what to do for the personality, the system needs a backstory to activate the personality to not make the false identity weak enough so that Jess could come out of her &quot;kangaroo coma&quot;. James thought about what backstory to give her, what was reasonable enough that it could change her personality, but not too far-fetched so that it didn&#39;t seem impossible for the identity to work. It took him a while, but he had a new backstory written for Jess. The new screen read out:<br />
<br />
ENTER NEW NAME: Mary Wilbrook<br />
<br />
NEW BACKGROUND: She was born on the 11th of January, 1990. Her mother, Joan, was a school teacher and her father, Mathew, was a carpenter. As a child, she liked to explore on her father&#39;s farm, hopping around and dancing, and helping her mother with the washing up. Her father was busy most of the time, but always made up for it by making her little wooden dolls for her to play with. At school, she was always a quick learner, and enjoyed the company of her friends, Mark (a human) and Jenny (a fennec fox). When she was 14, her father passed away from a heart attack. The farm that she loved was now handled by her Uncle &quot;Terry&quot; and Aunt Barbara. She then moved to a small country town, and only visited the farm during the holidays. During Christmas, she would always go to her cousin, Dave, for conversation after her father died. She got along well with Dave, during her teenage years, until her fallout with him after Dave got arrested for drug abuse. Because of her anger towards Dave and the passing of her father, she took karate lessons and became a green belt, but couldn&#39;t continue to become a brown belt as she went to university. She studied medicine and graduated with honours. She then worked in a coffee shop where she met her future husband, Damien. By the name she was 26, they got married. She now has three children, Vicki, Chloe and Nathan.<br />
<br />
NEW PERSONALITY: Kind, gentle, caring. Motherly to all people, including patients, doctors and other nurses. Always enthusiastic about what she is doing. A bit shy and nervous when she is introduced to someone. Strong when it comes to difficult situations, and will fight back when she needs to. She is very organised and on time. She loves to write, usually writes a journal and occasionally draws. Always follows what she is told to do, especially orders from Dr. James Delguard. <br />
<br />
James pressed the enter button, and after a couple seconds, the SD card was ejected. Pulling the SD card out of the computer, James inserted it back into the control machine and turned towards the frozen kangaroo woman that was known as Jess. By his thumbs was three square buttons, one green, one yellow and one red. His thumb was hovering over the yellow button, labelled &quot;install&quot;, his smile growing wider. Jess couldn&#39;t do anything about it, with her glazed eyes and her slightly agape muzzle mouth. She couldn&#39;t move, she wasn&#39;t going to be Jess anymore. <br />
<br />
James pushed the button.<br />
<br />
Jess&#39; whole body was vibrating as the nanobots started to rewrite her whole memory. Her eyes were still glazed and her mouth was still agape, but with her fur standing on end, James knew it was working. While the nanobots were working on her mind, her tail was now fully developed, looking like an actual kangaroo&#39;s tail. Her green eyes changed to a brown, ginger-like colour to match her fur. She grew an inch taller, just slightly below eye level from James. Images of her previous life flashed through her mind before slowly fading away into nothingness. For a second, there was nothing in her mind, completely blank, until the new memories started to fade into her mind.<br />
<br />
Her kind mother, her caring father, the farm, going to school, meeting Jenny, meeting Mark, her father&#39;s funeral, Uncle &quot;Terry&quot;, Moving house, those awkward family Christmases...<br />
<br />
James couldn&#39;t help but watch. This was going to be wonderful for him. The first human subject, the first human to animal transformation, the first nurse.<br />
<br />
...Seeing Dave at Christmas, with his leather jacket, sitting on the couch drinking egg nog with too much brandy near the fire...hanging out with him during the holidays...that party...the cops outside the doors...the nosebleed down Dave&#39;s face, the powder on his nose, spilling on the front of the police car, with that worried smile on his face...the anger that I had towards him...karate lessons, getting the yellow belt, continuing getting the other ranks, high school graduation, birthday&#39;s coming and going, getting the green belt, the last day before moving to university, my mother&#39;s face starting to tear up as I hug her when the bus arrived to the city, the first day of university, the endless studying, the sleepless nights, the coffee-fuelled days, graduating, the coffee shop...Damien...that first date...the love that I feel for him...the love he feels for me...the proposal...the wedding...that honeymoon...Vicki...Chloe...Nathan...oh, my little Joey&#39;s...I miss them so...<br />
<br />
Jess stopped vibrating, indicating that the memory change was finished. James lifted the control machine&#39;s microphone towards his mouth. &quot;Completion, exit&quot; James spoke into the microphone. The nanobots removed themselves from Jess&#39; brain cells and nervous system and dripped out of her kangaroo nose, like silver paint. Once all the nanobots left the nostrils of this kangaroo-human hybrid, they returned to the needle which they came from. Jess slowly started rocking side to side and slowly blinking one eye after the other. James started to smile again as he walked over to Jess, this was the start of a new beginning for him, and even more for Jess. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello...? Mrs Wilbrook? Are you okay?&quot; James asked, while slowly waving his hand in front of her eyesight. Mary snapped out of it. &quot;Oh...oh, I&#39;m so sorry, Dr. Delguard, I must of been staring off into space, do forgive me&quot;. It was still Jess&#39; voice, just more warmer than usual and less squeaky. &quot;It&#39;s alright, and please call me James&quot; James said smugly, knowing what he had done. Mary rubbed the side of her head in embarrassment and looked down to see ripped clothing right where she was standing. &quot;Oh goodness me, my clothes! I&#39;m so sorry. Oh, this is so embarrassing&quot; Mary said, picking up what she thought was her own clothes. She wasn&#39;t embarrassed to be technically nude to the Doctor as she did have fur, thick fur that looked like a normal kangaroo&#39;s fur, but as it was a professional workplace, she couldn&#39;t help but be embarrassed &quot;It&#39;s alright, it&#39;s alright, calm down, don&#39;t worry. I know that it&#39;s been hard to start working here and have your family a long distance away from you, I understand...&quot; calmly said James. &quot;I know. I do miss them though. My three little joey&#39;s... I do hope they are not a struggle for Damien&quot; she said, slightly exhausted, holding a pile of ripped clothes. &quot;I&#39;m sure he will handle them fine. He has before, hasn&#39;t he?&quot; James asked. Mary nodded her head, smiling back at James. He put his right hand on Mary&#39;s shoulder &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll get your things and I&#39;ll show you where you will be sleeping...&quot; James told Mary, walking outside of the mirrored room, into a corridor...<br />
<br />
Mary was given a key, a room key, to where she would be sleeping for &quot;a few months&quot;. Room 0001. &quot;I must of been the first one to arrive, I guess. Lucky me&quot; she thought. Mary arrived at her destination, the first door on the left, Room 0001. She unlocked the door and opened it.<br />
The room was like a box. Brick walls painted a light blue, a small mirror, a iron bed-frame with a thin mattress on top, a small desk and a small chair. This looked like something out of a prison, but prison reminded her of Dave, and the less said about him, the better. She placed the ripped up clothing on the mattress and sat down, having enough room to fit her tail. She felt lonely. She was a long way from home, away from her family, away from her mother, away from what she knew. A single tear dropped from her eye, dampening the fur that the tear touched. She looked up and noticed the pen and clipboard attached to the wall. She stood up and grabbed the clipboard and pen and sat back down on the bed, moving her position so she could lie down. She put the pen to paper and started writing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dear Diary, this is going to be a new beginning, one that could last for the rest of my life...&quot;</p>
