<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily, Alison, and Stephanie heard a braying coming from elsewhere on the field. Their long ears helped them to better perceive that sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee-haw! Hee-haw!&quot;<br />
<br />
The three former girls listened again and looked at each other.<br />
<br />
The sound made Stephanie and Alison want to bray. Stephanie brayed at this point without feeling embarrassed. But Alison really had to fight the urge.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can resist&quot;, little Alison thought as her stomach clenched. &quot;I can resist! I can resist!&quot;<br />
<br />
She couldn’t resist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaaw-Heeeeee-haw! Heeeeee-haw!!!&quot; Alison brayed. The damn brays were so hard to not like her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You two have to admit that the brays are becoming a wonderful sound to hear&quot;, Stephanie half joked.<br />
<br />
“Stephanie ... stop ... making..it ... worse ..” Emily scolded her while looking at Alison who looked like she was in pain. Emily realized what was wrong with Alison: She was feeling another one forming!<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I&#39;m just trying to make it better. &quot; Stephanie said without still feeling some kind of embarrassment for braying so naturally.<br />
<br />
Alison was panting, trying to hold down the massive bray she felt rippling up through her chest. It truly was like trying to hold back a cracked dam with her fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;No ... no ....&quot; Alison tried to swallow it down. The bray was lodged in her throat from her. “No..Don’t want this leeeee-HAW! Heeeeeee-HAAAAW! Heeee-HAAW! Heeee-HAW! &quot;<br />
<br />
Alison brayed, kicking her back legs as she did. Alison had already brayed before, but it was the most animalistic cry she had ever made. It sounded like the braying of a real donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;That ... that bray ... was different ...&quot; Alison said, her voice barely a whisper. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it was.&quot; Emily said. &quot;It was about as intense as I’ve ever seen come from you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooww ...&quot;, Alison moaned as tears ran down her cheeks from her. &quot;I&#39;m going to lose my voice. If that happens I&#39;ll never be a girl again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t say that, Alison. Don&#39;t give up.&quot; Emily said to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s true. I feel like I&#39;m turning more and more into a real donkey. When I heard that bray in the distance I wanted ... I wanted ... I don&#39;t know how to explain it. I wanted to bray too !!!&quot; Alison yelled in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how you feel, Alison,&quot; Stephanie told her. &quot;I loved that sound too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You loved it?&quot; Emily asked surprised. &quot;And you too, Alison?&quot;<br />
<br />
With her head down and feeling very ashamed, Alison didn&#39;t want to answer her.<br />
<br />
&quot;From the intensity of the bray we hear it is probably that of an adult male donkey,&quot; Stephanie continued. “I don’t know why I’m okay with this. I&#39;m actually terrified. But I needed to bray him. It was ... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;An instinct.&quot; Emily said.<br />
<br />
&quot;An instinct.&quot; Stephanie agreed. “I ... I have to bray, Emily. And Alison too. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hee-haw! Hee-haw! Hee-haw!&quot; the braying from earlier interrupted them. Emily now paid more attention to the sound and realized that Stephanie was right, the braying was loud, deep and manly. Very different from that of a foal.<br />
<br />
And not only that, Emily also started to like that sound. Yet, it felt natural, even good.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s what Emily was thinking when Stephanie started braying in response to the jackass. And not just Stephanie, Alison was braying loudly, no longer trying to stop her own braying.<br />
<br />
Little Alison no longer felt so ashamed by now.<br />
<br />
Hearing the braying of the male donkey, Stephanie, and Alison together triggered a new need in Emily that she had never felt before. That feeling was like an urge to communicate something to them, but not using words but ...<br />
<br />
There was a burn inside of Emily. Her very muscles were trembling as the pressure pushed against them in all directions. <br />
<br />
&quot;I won’t do it! &quot;, Emily thought knowing what was happening to her. &quot;I don’t have to...I won’t do it!&quot; <br />
<br />
Her neck now was moving up and down. She was almost hyperventilating. Her heart was pounding a mile a minute, faster and faster. <br />
<br />
Stephanie and Alison had already stopped braying and realized what was happening to Emily. Then Stephanie came over to her to say something.<br />
<br />
“Come on Emily. Trust me. It’s not something you can fight. I tried.”<br />
<br />
&quot;No...no...&quot;, Emily thought. &quot;I can beat this!&quot; She would have protested but the urge in the back of her throat was so strong she couldn’t open her mouth. Her insides were on fire from holding in the bray. <br />
<br />
Emily could feel it on the edge, trying to batter through her will to keep it down. Emily looked directly at the sun, somehow hoping this would stop it. Her knees were trembling. <br />
<br />
Stephanie smiled at her. The dam broke. <br />
<br />
“HAAAWWWWWWW!!! HEEEE-HAWWWWW-HEEEEE-HAWWW-HEEEE-HAWWW!!” Emily stopped and panted.  <br />
<br />
It was Emily&#39;s first bray, though she still sounded like a human mimicking a braying. She couldn&#39;t believe what she had done. <br />
<br />
“It feels better when you’re let it out&quot;, Stephanie said to Emily trying to calm her down.<br />
<br />
“It’s a fucking curse Stephanie&quot;, Emily told her very annoyed. &quot;I couldn&#39;t stop it even though I tried. We can’t accept this. We have to fight it, not enjoying it...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with enjoying it? Maybe now I want to be a real donkey.&quot; Stephanie said angrily leaving Emily stunned. “I didn’t want to be, really! But I don’t know what to do. Now I like to bray, eat grass, swish my tail, be naked and on all fours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but....this is...it&#39;s not right. We have futures, and grazing or braying are not in them!” Emily said horrified by Stephanie&#39;s words.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s not right, but I can&#39;t control it! Maybe it&#39;s better that I act like what I am now and possibly always should have been.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alison hung her ears. What Stephanie said distressed her too. Ever since they were in the pen on Pleasure Island, they had begun to have donkey behavior and desires. Alison believed that by not being on the island anymore, the curse would stop, apparently it wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Stephanie. That is what that horrible man wants us to believe: that we have always been donkeys on the inside and that we deserve to be in these bodies,&quot; Alison told her, approaching them as her tail swung behind her. “I know it feels good to bray. It&#39;s like something is telling me to do it. And when it is already inside my throat..... well, I have to do it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie hung her head, she realized that she had scared Alison who was on the verge of tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Alison. I did not mean that.&quot; Stephanie nuzzled Alison with her snout and then they cuddled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t give up, Stephanie&quot;, Alison told her while two tear ran down her cheeks. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to be a real donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will try, but it is so difficult.... being a donkey is very tempting. You know that it was getting harder to find reasons to resist those feelings and desires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Alison had to admit. &quot;And I hate it. I don&#39;t want to feel good anymore when I.... HAWWW! HAWWWWWWWW! HEEE-HAWWW! HEEEEE-HAWWWW!” <br />
<br />
A surprised bray burst out of Alison.<br />
<br />
“HEEEEEEEEEEEE-HAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!”<br />
<br />
The noise Alison made was so loud that the jackass at the other end of the field heard it and also brayed in reply. His bray was heard closer, it seemed that he was coming towards the former girls.<br />
<br />
Something that Emily, Stephanie and Alison did not know is that the donkeys bray to contact other donkeys that are far away and can meet. Their long ears can pick up those distant brays.<br />
<br />
Stephanie lost her senses again and she joined the braying of little Alison and the male donkey.<br />
<br />
Hearing the chorus of donkey brays, Emily felt as if something was telling her to bray along with Stephanie and Alison.<br />
<br />
&quot;S ... st..stop ...&quot; Emily said weakly. She started heaving again.<br />
<br />
The pressure in Emilys&#39; chest was building. She couldn&#39;t speak, it was like a massive hiccup had lodged in her chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have to think about school things to counteract this urge,&quot; thought Emily. &quot;Let&#39;s see, Christopher Columbus&#39;s fleet departing from Spain in 1492. His ships were named Niña, Pinta, and ...&quot;<br />
<br />
But the donkey will was winning. Emily&#39;s insides were on fire. This bray was not giving up. It was just building, and getting downright painful to hold in. Her body needed to bray.<br />
<br />
Stephanie and Alison stopped braying after a few minutes, turned around and stared at Emily. Their tails swung like pendulums, back and forth.<br />
<br />
Her whole body was heating up from the effort of holding the accursed braying. Emily swallowed, trying to suppress the urge. Stephanie grinned at her.<br />
<br />
“Let it out, Emily”, Stephanie whispered knowing what was going on. &quot;At least this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Emily shook her head and clenched her eyes shut. She clenched her jaw as the sensation moved into her neck. Her tail slapped against her backside and shaking her head Emily felt her mane do the same. <br />
<br />
“Let it out!” Alison shouted surprising everyone, including herself. Alison couldn&#39;t believe that she had said that. <br />
<br />
Emily&#39;s eyes snapped open.  She lowered her head to her chest as the airbubble came rumbling up.<br />
<br />
&quot;HAWWWWW! HAWWWWWW! HAWWWWWWW! Hawwwww-heeee! Hawwwww-hee! Hawwwww-hee! Hawwwww-hee! Hawwwww-hee..... HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW! HEE-HAW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Not only was Emily the most donkey-like braying she&#39;d ever given, she was more authentic than all the ones that had come out of Alison and Stephanie&#39;s mouths.  <br />
<br />
That made the situation worse. Stephanie and Alison loved Emily&#39;s realistic and loud braying so much that they couldn&#39;t help themselves and brayed again.<br />
<br />
Emily, Stephanie, and Alison continued braying together for several more minutes. It made them feel good, although they also knew that by doing so they were slowly losing their human consciousness, turning more and more into a real donkeys.<br />
<br />
By the way, another thing that the former girls did not know is that the leader of a herd of donkeys is the one who has the loudest and longest braying. Therefore, and although none of them had realized it, Emily was already officially the leader of the herd and Stephanie and Alison were paying homage and honoring her with their brays.<br />
<br />
&quot;HEEEEE-HAWWWWWW!&quot; The jackass braying was heard from where Emily, Stephanie and Alison were.<br />
<br />
In front of the three girls stood a large, burly, gray male donkey.</p>
