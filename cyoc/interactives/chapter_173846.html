<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As she stood in the foyer, staring and contemplating what to do with the potion, Rachel heard creaking coming from upstairs, her mother was awake and getting up. She quickly shoved the box into the coat closet and rushed back into the kitchen. Grabbing a pod of her mother&#39;s favorite coffee, Rachel inserted it into the keurig and turned it on. She then returned to the stove, scraped the burned pancakes off the pan into the trash and started to make a new batch. A few seconds after she had just flipped the first two onto a plate, her mother, Karen, entered the kitchen wearing her bathrobe over her sleeping shirt and cotton sleeping pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Good morning Rachel,&quot; Karen said with a yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning mom!&quot; Rachel replied as she poured another two pancakes onto the pan and took a quick glance at her mother.<br />
<br />
Everyone always said that she looked a lot like her mother, and they were right. Other than her mother having her greying-brown hair cut into a bob and being a little shorter than her daughter - Karen being 5&#39;5&quot; compared to Rachel&#39;s 5&#39;8&quot; - they looked like they could be siblings. Her mother looked good for being 38, her face had a few beginning wrinkles and laugh lines, her moderately sized C-cup breasts sagged a bit and her waist was soft and doughy. She never had much time after work to do enough exercise and, sadly, she&#39;d never been able to fully get rid of her baby weight from her pregnancy with Rachel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is the coffee almost ready?&quot; Karen asked as she struggled to contain another yawn.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; Rachel started, only to be interrupted by beeping from the keurig. &quot;...all set, I&#39;ll get your cup ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her mother nodded with a mumbled thanks and shuffled sleepily over to the table. She groaned as she felt a twinge in her lower back as she lowered herself into a chair and started to rub away the pain. After flipping the last two pancakes off the pan, Rachel headed over to the coffee maker. She glanced at her mother sadly as she placed a mug under the keurig and pressed a button, with a hum the coffee started to slowly pour into the mug. Her mother worked as a secretary at a law firm downtown. Her boss was a nice person, only she had a habit of procrastinating and leaving most of the paperwork for her mother to do, forcing her mother to some days stay at the office hours later than she normally left. Other times calling her in to find a missing file or some such. It was really driving her mother ragged and Rachel wished there was something she could do to help.<br />
<br />
Turning to look back at the keurig, Rachel spotted the bottle of potion that she had set absently on the counter beside the coffee maker in her rush to get back to the stove. A sudden idea popped into her head. Once the coffee was done, Rachel quickly pour a small amount of the potion into the mug, along with a the sweetener. Giving the coffee a quick stir, she then picked up the mug and a plate of pancakes over to the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here you go mom, some nice fluffy pancakes and some warm coffee,&quot; said Rachel with a smile, placing both items before her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, sweetie,&quot; Karen said, looking up at her daughter with a small smile, and then lifted the mug up to her face, taking a deep sniff at the smell and steam wafting up from the warm drink.<br />
<br />
Karen took a sip, paused as her coffee seemed to taste a little funny, a little sweeter perhaps? She shrugged with a relaxed smile, hummed and drank some more. Her slumped shoulders seemed to perk up, the ache in her back slowly began to fade and she was suddenly feeling a bit more energetic than she would normally feel in the morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, for some reason, I&#39;m feeling really good today,&quot; Karen said as she sat up, straightening her back, and began tapping her foot against the floor. She took a bite of pancake and the drank a bigger gulp of her delicious coffee. <br />
<br />
Rachel smiled and excused herself, saying she had to use the bathroom. She exited the kitchen and peaked around the corner of the doorway. Karen was still sitting in her chair, gulping her coffee with gusto, when Rachel noticed something different about her mother.<br />
<br />
Her mother&#39;s hair, which she always kept in a short bob, looked longer than it should, reaching the base of her neck. Continuing to watch, Rachel was startled to see her hair suddenly grow a few inches, now covering her shoulders and the grey strands starting to regain their original brown color. Karen absentmindedly reached up to brush her longer bangs from her face as she took another large gulp of her coffee.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t felt this energetic in years!&quot; Karen exclaimed as she unconsciously began twirling her longer hair around her finger.<br />
<br />
Suddenly feeling a bit warm, Karen stood up from her seat and pulled her bathrobe off, tossing it carelessly to the floor as she once again picked up her mug and drained the remainder of her coffee in a large gulp. Rachel continued to stare at her mother, when what happened next caused her eyes to widen in astonishment. As Karen set the mug on the table, she suddenly shivered and her belly began sucking inward, slimming down as her skin regained its lost firmness. And it wasn&#39;t just her waist that was slowly thinning, her arms and legs too were losing the little fat they had built up over the years. Her mother&#39;s hair continued to grow longer, now spilling over her slimming shoulders and reaching the middle of her back and her chest in the front. It was also looking darker than it&#39;s original brown, more like a dark chestnut brown. Not a single strand of grey could be seen.<br />
<br />
Speaking of her mother&#39;s chest, Rachel was startled when she saw the front of her mother&#39;s shirt shift forward. She stared in shock as Karen&#39;s sagging breasts start to lift and perk up. It almost looked like they were growing bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ouch!&quot; Karen winced in pain as she began rubbing her breasts and pulling on her bra straps through her shirts collar. &quot;My bra is too tight? Why am I even wearing an undersized bra in the first place? I better take it off.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen grabbed the hem of her shirt and pulled it off with a yank. Rachel smothered a gasp when her mother&#39;s torso came into full view. Her waist was slowly still slimming down, looking thinner than she had ever seen her mother look before, the skin on her waist pulling taught as it continued to regain it&#39;s youth. Her breasts bulged and strained around the the sides and against the cups of a bra they could no longer fit, resting firmer and higher on her mother&#39;s chest. And, for some reason, her mother&#39;s skin was looking a bit tanner than normal, her mother never spent enough time in the sun to get a tan. <br />
<br />
Karen reached back to unclasp her bra, and as soon as she did her breasts bounced forward in their freedom, looking extremely perky and full. After throwing her bra to the floor beside her bathrobe, Karen pulled her shirt back on, only the hem stopped a few inches above the waistband of her sleeping pants and the material stretched tightly around her breasts, her nipples clearly showing through the tight material.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that&#39;s much better! Gotta let the girls breathe!&quot; Karen said, her voice sounding slightly higher and younger.<br />
<br />
Rachel did a double take at the way her mother was talking when Karen suddenly shot up a few inches in height and then did so once more. To Rachel&#39;s surprise, she was now eye to eye with her mother, she was the same height as she was. The wrinkles on Karen&#39;s face were now gone, looking much more youthful than it had a few seconds ago. Her hair was now down to her rear end, which had steadily firmed up and grew a bit bigger as well. Karen gave a sway of her hips as they stretched wider until they were as wide as her shoulders. Her now wide hips lead up to a waist that had stopped getting thinner, leaving Karen with a lean, slender waist of a young woman. <br />
<br />
Karen suddenly began to breath heavily as the energy inside her continued to build up. With each deep breath her breasts bounced more and more, larger and rounder, the hem of her shirt continued to slowly rise up her taut and slender waist until her belly button was revealed. Rachel stared in awe as her mother&#39;s clothes suddenly began to shift and shrink. Her sleeping shirt shrank and tightened around her large DD-cup breasts, the collar plunging to display her deep valley of cleavage, and the sleeves pulling into slender shoulder straps, becoming a small tank-top. While her pajama pants tightened around her long, shapely legs and shrank into a pair of tight short shorts. Once everything was all said and done, Karen now looked to be a young beautiful woman of 21 years of age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I feel so good right now!&quot; Karen exclaimed as she bounced on her feet, causing her enlarged bosom to bounce as well. &quot;I feel so energetic, I think I will go for a run! Gotta keep myself in shape!&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen giggled cheerfully as she jogged out of the kitchen, past Rachel&#39;s hiding place and headed upstairs to her room to get changed into her jogging outfit. <br />
<br />
After listening to the sound of her now younger mother riffling through her closet for a few seconds, Rachel glanced down at the potion in her hand and began to wonder what else the liquid could do...</p>
