<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Half a year after the initial transformation caused by Jeff, a lot of the dogs and humans settled into their new lives. Or live their lives how they always thought they had. Humans were either pets or strays, with some humans actually ending up how wild wolves used to be, roaming and hunting in packs in the wilderness. Most humans though were just loyal pets, filling out niches the dogs used to do when they were in that role. As for the dogs, they happily fulfilled their intelligent lives, working or going to school each day. This new status quo lasted only a couple of months.<br />
<br />
Fifi, Jeff&#39;s formerly pet corgi, now master, accidentally spilt a drink of water on the pc that the Chronivac was installed on. Fifi didn&#39;t even realise the Chronivac was installed on the PC either since Jeff hid it away in secret folders when he installed it, but due to the nature of the Chronivac, it was always running. Due to this, as well as the spillage on the PC, the Chronivac began to malfunction and attempt a reset on all transformations in the log. This would be fine any other time, but combined with the damage caused by the water, the reset didn&#39;t completely restore humans and dogs to the way they were prior.<br />
<br />
In a normal reset of the dog and human role swap, it would cause humans to go back to how they were and dogs to become pets, albeit not fully how things were. If someone who was previously single as a human, found a mate whilst they were in the role of a pet, then when humans get restored, those two would now be a couple even if there would&#39;ve been no way they would end up as one prior to the massive world changing transformation. This is how it would have worked in a normal situation.<br />
<br />
What actually happened is a couple of things. <br />
<br />
Firstly, the reset caused dogs to be completely deleted from reality. They no longer existed as an intelligent species, or as pets. They were gone. However, in some ways, they lived on in another form.<br />
<br />
Humans, who now went back to being intelligent, retained somethings from their old life, while gaining a couple of new things from dogs. One of the obvious new additions that once belonged to the now erased dogs are that universally, all humans now have a tail that wags when excited and indicates emotions. The tail itself is a hairy nub that&#39;s a couple of inches long, and the hair is usually the same colour as the pubic hair. Another universal change is that humans can now walk a mix of quadrupedal and bipedal. Under most circumstances, humans prefer to be in a quadrupedal position, and sit like how they used to as pets, but they can choose to walk and stand on two legs. It&#39;s not any more difficult, but it&#39;s the more common perception. This also means that physically, human legs and arms are the same length to make quadrupedal walking easier. Some notable but not as important changes include far more body hair for both men and women, longer tongues and overall better hearing and smelling.<br />
<br />
As for the final physical changes, these are gender specific. For female humans, they retain the breast size being an indication of fertility, but they also now grow three pairs of breasts instead of one. Each pair slightly smaller than the one above it. This helps to feed the far more puppies humans give birth to. Their vaginas also remain located further between the ass cheeks to make quadrupedal mating more ideal. For male humans, instead of the penis constantly protruding from their body, human males now have a sheath which prevents the dick from getting in the way while walking, but also protects their much longer dick sizes. Even the dick is different as it more resembles a mix between a human and dog penis than the regular human penis.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s the extent of physical changes. Mental and cultural changes are more extreme.<br />
<br />
While most of modern society remains untouched, some concepts either were altered or removed. For an example of the former, a concept that got altered is clothes. Clothes, while still existing, are mostly just unneeded as humans now possessing more body hair means that they don&#39;t need clothes to keep warm anymore, neither do they really need shoes. This doesn&#39;t mean that clothes are gone as exploring extreme places still requires proper protective equipment, and some people choose to wear certain things for fashion or preference. Most of the time, people carry a little carrier bag or rucksack that stores anything like loose change or their phones. The lack of clothes even extends to the idea of modesty. Things that once didn&#39;t fall under modest, but now do, are nudity, breastfeeding while in public, overtly being aroused (but not having sex) and licking other humans. The only things that don&#39;t fall under modesty is pissing, pooing or having sex outside of your property or designated areas, and these designated areas aren&#39;t private as they can sometimes be in the middle of the street. These areas exist because it&#39;s easier to clean the mess there, than anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Going back to licking, licking used to be seen as gross in the past world, but new humans use is as a means of communication and greetings depending on the context. In some cases, it can be seen as an equivalent to a handshake or hello, other times, it&#39;s used to help increase someone&#39;s arousal. If a mother or father is doing it to their puppies, it can also be a means of cleaning if no shower or bath is nearby. This typically happens in public.<br />
<br />
A couple of last things is the idea of couches and beds. Couches no longer exist as instead, due to humans mostly preferring to sit how they used to as pets, large cushions that can be put on the floor are a better alternative. As for beds, standard old beds no longer exist, but rather, specially designed cushions are the new beds as they are far more comfy than regular pillows. <br />
<br />
The final changes are with some words. Most words are fine with some slight alterations that come with the new world, except some. The word dog no longer exists for obvious reasons, but three other words that no longer exist are man, woman, and child(ren). Instead, humans now use the dog equivalent to each of these words. Man/men are studs, women are bitches and children are puppies. This also means that the word bitch isn&#39;t a swear word anymore, it&#39;s just a normal everyday word and isn&#39;t an insult.<br />
<br />
This is all of how this new world is on a fundamental level after the malfunctioning reset, however this doesn&#39;t mean everything. Sometimes, specific situations, different things of each person has changed and here are a few situations for each person.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
For Ashley and Greg, after Greg mated with her in the alley, the two went their separate ways as strays with each one ending up in a different situation. Ashley ending up giving birth to a couple of puppies in a back alley and raising them until they left the dens she made. As for Greg, he ended up getting found by an elderly dog couple who too him to live with them in a fancy lake side house. He was cared for happily there. When the reset happened, Greg became wealthy and happy with his two lovely dogs while Ashley became a back street prostitute who fucked anyone who paid her. Greg and Ashley no longer remembered each other after the reset.<br />
<br />
Rachel, who was in a similar situation to Ashley, was more fortunate. She was found by an animal rescue group who saved her and treated her. She eventually gave birth to her litter in their sanctuary. After being fully healed, she was actually sent off to a familiar human breeding center where she was put with another familiar human named Betty.<br />
<br />
Betty, and her mate Jack, were very much put together to mate a lot and when Rachel arrived, Jack now had two bitches to mate with. The trio became inseparable at the breeding center and the musk and scent from all three of them was strong. In this time, Betty had two separate litters, while Rachel only had one litter at the center since she was a late arrival. As the reset happened, Jack, Bethany and Rachel were now all in a big polyamorous relationship while they ran a center that would help couple mate and would support pregnant bitches. Often times though, Jack would be a one man show as Rachel and Bethany were both pregnant a lot.<br />
<br />
For the humans at the puppy pound, they were used to look after abandoned puppies with Emily (not rich bitch), Lilly and Amy becoming the surrogate mothers to a lot of puppies. One time though, a stray human got in and bred with the three of them, before it got shooed of. After half a year, the three bitches were heavily pregnant, so when the reset happened, three heavily pregnant pre school teachers, now taught a bunch of young puppies while also acting like surrogate moms to them. Even with their own puppies coming soon.<br />
<br />
For the last two individuals, Jeff and Emily (rich bitch) would have had no connection to one another until that is, Brutus requested Jeff to be Emily&#39;s mate. Fifi brough Jeff over and Emily and Jeff ended up hitting it off as pets. If the two were regular humans, no way anything would happen, but as pets they loved each other. They became fast friends and even had a litter together before they got sold off. At the very moment the reset happened, the two of them were fucking each other in the garden, and after the reset they were still fucking. Furthermore, Jeff and Emily were now a married couple in this new history and lived in their huge mansion with their many puppies. Due to dogs aging faster then humans, Jeff was also a couple of years older too.<br />
