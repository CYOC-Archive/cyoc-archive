<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daisy awoke the next morning feeling good, better than she thought. She streched out under her sheets and enjoyed the feeling of waking up with enough energy to walk a marathon. Sunlight shone through her window, which was half-covered with beige curtains. The sunlight lit the collection of cute brown teddybears sitting on a closet, most of those she had gotten from her grandparents during her youth, just looking at them gave her a warm feeling. The light also touched the barbie-doll sitting next to her on the nightstand. Looking at the doll she immediately thought of her mom. The horrors of yesterday were still fresh in her mind. She didn’t feel the immense deception and defeat she had felt yesterday, but she reasoned those feelings always pass after a while. <br />
<br />
Still, tears welled up just thinking about her mom. Why had she done this? Why had she turned into some sort of sick-caricature of a woman? Becoming everything Daisy, and her mom, had hated to be. Arrogant, sex-starved, s.lutty, fake-looking, no self-respect whatsoever. And HOW?! How had she altered her looks, and her house so much in just 5 days?! She couldn’t grasp it, but in the end Daisy simply thought her mom had to be having one of those midlife crisises and maby was influenced by some evil people into doing the things she had done. Her grandparents would talk to her mom and maby settle this whole affair. This could only be a phase, she decided, her mom would come to senses sooner or later…<br />
<br />
When Daisy arrived downstairs, dressed and refreshed, she saw her grandparents sitting in the livingroom. Classical music created a nice ambience in the room, as her grandma sipped from her coffee. Her grandpa was on the phone. In the morning light she noticed that both her grandparents really looked their age, they never really bothered to cover it up, seemingly enjoying their natural aging process.<br />
<br />
“Look Amanda, your daughter came over yesterday in tears, That’s why I’m calling! ……. Don’t use that language with me child!...YES! Yes you’re still my daughter and I do not accept you behaving like this….what?! …Quiet!! I don’t want to hear this….listen…why are you acting like this…..like this? This sudden change of attitude…..what do you mean you’ve always been like this?!....Look, just…just, just use your head. What do you think about your own daughter being here, in tears?! ….You don’t care?! Amanda!......” then he hung up.<br />
<br />
“She hung up…” George, her grandpa, told her, looking stunned. “I don’t know what came over her…she’s completely changed….maby she’s having one of those midlife crisis things…you know…where they want to do everything different.”<br />
<br />
“You sure about that George?” her grandma, Marion, asked. “Yeah, well, remember Marion, Amanda never really went through puberty like a normal girl. She never rebeled against us. Maby she is in a phase of wanting to let of some steam…”<br />
<br />
Daisy just listened along the story, not believing what had happened. Her grandparents comforted her afterwards and together they ate their breakfast, full of healthy fresh fruit and vegetables, Daisy really loved those healthy breakfasts. Afterwards Daisy decided to call Robbie, a good friend of hers, who lived around here. They had been friends since kindergarden and really had a good relationship, nothing sexual, just good friends.<br />
<br />
“Hi Robbie, it’s Daisy. Listen, could you come over to my grandparents house this evening, maby hang around? Yeah, I don’t feel that great, something about my mom….yeah, I’ll tell you when you get here. Maby you could sleep over? Yeah as usual…cool, great. Yeah we’ll just have a great weekend! Ok, great…thanx…see you tonight!”. <br />
<br />
Daisy really cared for Robbie. He was a quiet, shy but very intelligent guy whom she could talk with about everything. She never really had female best-friends, so Robbie was her only real close social connection, and she was pretty sure his situation was similar. Maby because they often felt more like brother and sister, their relationship could last so long without trouble. Anyway, she could really use his company now. Maby with him around for the weekend she could get her mind of her weird mother.<br />
<br />
When Robbie arrived later that day he was greeted warmly by Daisy’s grandparents. Because of his intelligent and sincere character they had taken a liking to him pretty quick. Robbie often came over when Daisy was with her grandparents, sometimes for a day, sometimes he would spend the night there, it was all very casual.<br />
<br />
After sitting with her grandparents for a while, where she informed Robbie of the sudden change in attitude and appearance of her mother, they decided to retreat to Daisy’s bedroom in preparation for the night. Daisy had arranged for a matras Robbie could sleep on, next to her own bed (though her bed was big enough for two persons she didn’t feel comfortable sleeping in the same bed as Robbie. It made her feel awkward and unconfortable to be too close to boys). As Robbie unpacked some things they started to chat.<br />
<br />
“I just can’t believe it Daisy, about your mom. You say she’s changed into a completely different person in just five days?!” Robbie asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah I know, I don’t believe it either. But I know what I’ve seen yesterday. She looked completely different. As if she was a plastic caricature of herself. She had done plastic surgery on her breasts, her hair was now white-blonde and her lips looked só thick, as if a bee stung her.” She replied.<br />
<br />
“But Daisy, you can’t get plastic surgery in just 5 days! That’s impossible”<br />
<br />
“I know, I know, look I know it sounds impossible but the fact remains that she is completely changed. And it’s not just me who’s noticed it. My granddad called her and could hear my mothers changes. She seems to act like some kind of arrogant, s.lutty woman who only thinks about sex and herself....she (sob) she just laughed in my face when I ran away, crying” Daisy said, as she began to cry.<br />
<br />
Robbie hugged and comforted her. “sssh, it’s okay Daisy. Look, whatever your mom is doing, or going through, I’m sure there’s an explanation for it. And I do not believe she is such a radical different person. Maby she acts like one now, but I believe your mom will come to her senses sooner or later and drop the whole charade. Maby she’s just angry at something and needs to vent it...”<br />
<br />
After their talk Daisy felt a bit of relief and felt ready to try and get some sleep. Next day she would enjoy life and try not to worry about her mom. So she went to the bathroom to change into her white nighty, not wanting to change in front of Robbie. When she returned to her room, untying her long brown ponytail, Robbie had also changed into his pyama’s and was already lying under his sheets. Even though they had slept in the same room many times, they always made sure they weren’t undressed in each others company, that was just the way of their relationship.</p>
