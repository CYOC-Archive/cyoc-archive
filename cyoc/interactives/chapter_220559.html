<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Beer pong man!&quot; Brad shouted out. &quot;We gotta have a reason to start getting drunk before all those other shit social games you got up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Finn shrugged. Jeff and the other guys were already moving around the furniture and pulling out several long tables.<br />
<br />
Isaac stared a bit confused. The way the jocks were working seemed odd to him. It was like they all understood their job and couldn&#39;t deviate from it until they were all set up. He cautiously walked over to Finn. &quot;Is--Is there anything I can do?&quot; he asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Finn looked him up and down. &quot;Go get the red solo cups and another case of beer so we can get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh!&quot; Isaac rushed into kitchen, past the garage and pulled down the package of red solo cups. He went to the fridge and pulled out a 24 pack of beer. Even though he&#39;d never been to this part of the house, he almost instinctually knew where everything was. For a moment it seemed strange until he reentered the extra room to see that everything had been shifted and ready for the cups. His mind quickly changed to setting up the ten cups into a triangle on the edge of the table.<br />
<br />
Paul followed him up by filling them with beer. The soccer player looked down at Isaac. &quot;You&#39;re pretty good at setting up these cups, even though you&#39;ve never played before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you know that?&quot; Isaac tried to sound tough, but Paul just laughed in his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you?&quot; Paul asked.<br />
<br />
Isaac let out a defeated sigh, as he finished setting up another 10 cups. &quot;No...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s kind of obvious man...&quot; Paul smiled. It wasn&#39;t exactly condescending, just knowing. &quot;What animal did you get? I got Clydesdale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... Lion.&quot; Isaac answered.<br />
<br />
Paul let out a full on laugh that got everyone&#39;s attention for a second. &quot;Lion? Jesus. What a weird fucking game. So tiny ole you&#39;s supposed to be a lion. I&#39;m a Clydesdale. Then big ass Adrian&#39;s supposed to be an otter and Brad&#39;s a margay? What kind of fuckin&#39; game is this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dunno...&quot; Isaac shrugged. He hadn&#39;t really thought about it. But Paul&#39;s lean build didn&#39;t exactly scream Clydesdale. And a 6&#39;6&quot; 280 pound linebacker was supposed to be a otter? Or the QB being a little margay, that didn&#39;t feel like it made much sense either. Still, neither one had stopped setting up the game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright!&quot; Finn clapped his hands as the last cup of beer was filled. &quot;Let&#39;s get started!&quot; Everyone seemed to know exactly where to go. Isaac looked across the table to see Jeff smiling back at him. His massive body towered over the table. &quot;Now, no fingering, blowing or anything. Unless you wanna have fun on your own, that&#39;s fine. But if the ball goes in, it&#39;s in. Got it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we got it!&quot; Brad answered for the group.<br />
<br />
The rest nodded. Though, Isaac felt his stomach start to turn. He looked over at Jeff&#39;s massive body. Even with a smile, the tiger&#39;s large masculine maw filled with sharp teeth was rather intimidating. Though, compared to Dave&#39;s competitive streak, he wasn&#39;t so sure he&#39;d fair much better against the ram. Paul was already taking three drinks, but shooting back just as much trash talk as the ram was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Isaac snapped out of his fear for a second. &quot;Uhhh... No. Well. Not really. I&#39;ve just never played before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff smirked. He held the ping pong ball in between his claws. &quot;Oh right. You&#39;re Finn&#39;s friend. Game&#39;s real simple. All you have to do is throw the balls in. the. cup.&quot; He paused with each throw of ping pong ball across the table. Each one landed perfectly in the cup. &quot;Now take a drink of each that landed inside.&quot; The smile on Jeff&#39;s face only grew bigger as he stood tall.<br />
<br />
Especially after watching Isaac&#39;s face drop as he watched each ball effortlessly fall into their proper place. &quot;If those are the rules...&quot; Isaac lifted the first cup. He almost wanted to hold his nose. However, as the beer touched his lips, he almost couldn&#39;t stop drinking. Even though he always hated the strong bitter taste, this beer almost felt sweet again. It went down easily and his hand seemed to refuse to put the cup back down. It was the same with the other two drinks as well.<br />
<br />
Isaac let out a hearty breath as he finished the third drink. An odd warmness filled his belly. He pulled at the collar of his shirt. Then shook it off. &#39;Am I already drunk?&#39; he questioned. It&#39;s not like he was much of a drinker. Though, he didn&#39;t even know if he&#39;d finished two beers or not. A bead of sweat dripped down his brow.<br />
<br />
&quot;You doing alright down there?&quot; Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Isaac wiped the sweat away. He fished a ping pong ball out of the cup and looked across the table. He tried to line it up, but missed horribly. &quot;Dang...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s alright. You got two more shots.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac fished out the other two balls and tried to toss them as well. They looked to be just as bad. He figured the other guys might say something, though they were all so engrossed in their own games that they didn&#39;t even seem to notice. Looking over at Paul and Dave&#39;s; Paul was doing pretty badly. He&#39;d made in two, but it looked like Dave had hit 5 and made him rerack into a smaller pyramid.<br />
<br />
The sound of the ping pong ball hitting the cup, brought Isaac back. &quot;Our game&#39;s over here,&quot; Jeff snickered.<br />
<br />
&quot;R-right,&quot; Isaac said. His fear of the beer vanished and he happily took a drink out of the cup. He was almost glad Jeff made the other two shots. Isaac poured the two cups together to make it easier to drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think I got this one,&quot; Jeff bragged. &quot;You only got the four left. Go ahead and make them into a diamond.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac did as he was told. He grabbed the three ping pong balls and tried to throw them again. Though, the strange tightness in his shirt seemed to throw him off. If felt like it was hugging him a lot more than it had been. Then the amount of sweat just made it cling all the tighter. He shook it off, and did his best to throw the balls across the table. A bit of excitement hit him as he made one in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good job buddy,&quot; Jeff praised as he took a drink. &quot;Though... You are still pretty far behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
Before Isaac could even say, &#39;Right,&#39; Jeff had effortlessly tossed in three more shots. Isaac would have called it cheating if he knew how. It was like reality had bent itself in a way that Jeff couldn&#39;t miss one. However, that wasn&#39;t possible. Isaac just wasn&#39;t as good as the massive tiger. He took his three drinks without complaint. More because of how good they tasted.<br />
<br />
The game no longer matter to Isaac as he took his drinks, he just threw the balls across the table haphazardly. The warm happy feeling the drinks gave him only made him want it to end all the faster so he could get that last one. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not even trying anymore...&quot; Jeff taunted. Isaac shook his head behind the solo cup as he finished it. &quot;Guess it was a good idea to make the beer taste so good...&quot; he mused.<br />
<br />
Isaac wasn&#39;t paying attention to him, only the ping pong ball as it soared into the cup. He accidently cheered as he took his last drink.<br />
<br />
&quot;You trying to lose dumbass?&quot; Paul grumbled as he also took the last drink on his side of the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s just having fun,&quot; Dave laughed loudly. He opted to drink his beer even though he&#39;d won. &quot;Maybe he&#39;s not just a sore loser...&quot; raising an eyebrow towards Paul.<br />
<br />
Paul looked like he had several more things to say, but kept them to himself. He walked over to the dry erase board and then pulled &#39;ears&#39; from under his name. &quot;What the--?&quot; his face scrunched in confusion. He reached up for the sides of his skull only to find that his ears were currently migrating a bit higher than they had been. They were quickly developing points and then growing longer and wider. They flickered and then his face returned to a calm.<br />
<br />
Isaac stared a bit in confusion. Was something different? Had Paul always had such long hair? It almost looked like a mohawk running down the back of his neck. And didn&#39;t he have bright blond hair? Not black? But Paul flashed him a bit of a glare. &quot;What?&quot; he demanded. His tall rounded Clydesdale ears flicked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-nothing!&quot; Isaac rushed past Paul to the white board and picked &#39;feet&#39; from the bottom. He nearly let out a scream as the most intense pain hit him in the feet. It was like his bones were remolding themselves. Isaac couldn&#39;t stand and fell to the ground. He watched in horror as his shoes bulged in places they they shouldn&#39;t. Toes seemed to rise and fall. He could feel the bones twisting and turning. It was like his feet were completely changing. Large nails burst out from the front. Then the front of large lion paws. <br />
<br />
He felt his feet twist and turn as they elongated, giving him a more digitigrade stature. Large pads started to form under the front of his foot and toes. His nails flexed in and out of his toes. Tawny yellow fur start to grow around them and then up his foot. &quot;Damn it...&quot; he groaned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Finn asked Isaac. It took Isaac by surprise. He looked down at his massive lion feet and then up to the anthropomorphic fox. He could almost see a wry smile on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... No?&quot; Isaac tried to figure out what had happened or why he was currently on the floor. He looked around the room, then stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he&#39;s had too much to drink,&quot; Brad laughed. However, he paused before he passed Isaac. His head tilted a bit in confusion. &quot;How tall are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;5&#39;6&quot;?&quot; Isaac answered. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;6&#39;2&quot;.&quot; Brad said. Though there wasn&#39;t the 8 inches that should have been there. Instead it felt far less. Almost like there was only 4 or 5 inches instead. &quot;You should probably go see a doctor. Looks like you got a growth spurt since last time.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Must have...&quot; Isaac laugh stupidly. Though, he couldn&#39;t help but feel that Brad was a bit shorter. Same with Adrian. The big linebacker stood in the rear of the room, still proud over his victory, but as Dave talked to him, they no longer looked to be the same height. Instead, Dave was a few inches taller.<br />
<br />
Brad wen to the board and picked off ears. &quot;The fu--&quot; he grunted and reached up for the side of his skull just as Paul had done. However, just the same they were moving upwards. The tips had turned to points and then into full on triangles on top of his head. <br />
<br />
&quot;Forget where you&#39;re ears are?&quot; Paul laughed. &quot;Maybe you&#39;ve had too much to drink.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brad&#39;s margay ears turned down and back in frustration. His face serious face almost looked cute for some reason. &quot;Fuck you man...&quot; he grumbled as he went to get another beer. As he drank it, it almost looked like his dirty blond hair had grown dark patterns in it. Or was it always like that? <br />
<br />
Isaac shook his head. He was about to ask a question before Finn interrupted. &quot;What should we play next?&quot;</p>
