<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun fell across his face, Jake slowly opened his eyes. Coming up foggily from his dreams, he felt a weight on his body--a hand was probing him, feeling up his hard pecs and his powerful biceps. He teased the boy, tensing them, flexing them, and the excitement he caused in the other boy excited him, making his giant cock rise to attention. Jake stood up from his bed. The other boy (What was his name? Matt--Mark?), seeing the lion rising from its sleep, got on his knees and began servicing Jake, unable to resist the glory of his cock. This other boy was visibly excited and began jacking himself off as he sucked Jake off and watched Jake flex and pose for him.<br />
<br />
Jake was, simply put, a god. He was 6'4&quot; and built like a quarterback football player. He had a lean model's body with head crushing biceps--and those abs! You could cut glass with them! Jake had always worked hard to maintain the body that came so easily to him. The body of a male ideal, topped by the most beautiful face in town. With a moan Jake came buckets in this man's moutn and he greedily lapped it all up--but Jake wasn't done yet. Hard again right away, Jake flipped the man over and began pounding him harder and harder until he was screaming in ecstasy, moaning and writhing and struggling to let Jake in deeper and deeper. They came at the same time with an earth shattering roar. Afterwards Jake sat down on the bed and looked at the guy point blank.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess I'll see you around?&quot; The guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I'll call you.&quot; Jake said, and busied himself doing something else.<br />
<br />
The other guy shook his head, got dressed in silence and left.<br />
<br />
After he was gone Jake jacked off for a couple of hours, killing time and admiring himself in the mirror, flexing and posing. God, he was killer! With his towering, dominating physique he easily made money as a security man for a local gay magazine. He went to the gym to work off the sexual energy that never seemed to leave him until finally he decided he had to go out again tonight and find a boy or two. He decided to go to that club he'd heard that porn star, Trent Everett was going to.<br />
<br />
He dressed trendily, wearing clothes that suggested and highlighted his beautiful body and complimented his beautiful face and went out. He had a couple of drinks but he didn't need drinks to build his confidence. Jake was clearly the star of the club. All eyes were on him, all boys wanted to be fucked by him. He was the prince and he knew it. The boy from that morning--Marcus it turned out was his name--was there, and seemed pissed when Jake ignored him. He'd only been a casual fuck--really, he'd only brought him home 'cus he was kind of funny. Maybe they could've been friends in another universe but Jake didn't see the point in friends you didn't fuck.<br />
<br />
Finally he found him. Trent was dancing with some blonde boy, cute-ish but no Trent. Jake walked straight towards him and began dancing with him. Trent melted, looking up into Jake's beautiful green eyes. Jake stripped off his shirt slowly and sensually, and Trent did the same, captivated by Jake's beautiful pecs. Jake gripped Trent by the ass and pulled him in close, almost lifting him up the floor as he captured Trent's lips. Trent complied and the two of them made out on the dance floor, watched and envied by everyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Want to come back to my place?&quot; Jake breathed and Trent shuddered with sexual anticipation and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;My friend Paul has to come though. He's staying with me and I don't want to leave him alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake eyed this Paul and nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
A little bit of time later they were at Jake's.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this place is kind of a dump, isn't it?&quot; Trent said. He was kind of a brat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trent, be nice.&quot; Paul said, noting the look of resentment on Jake's face.<br />
<br />
They got inside and Paul and Trent undressed Jake quickly and began to worship his body like so many others had. Jake grasped Trent and pushed him down on the bed, plunging into him and fucking him while Paul sucked off Trent. They were all caught up in the whirlwind of sexual energy. Jake fucked Trent for a while and then he fucked Paul for a while and then he let them both suck him off and get off on his body. He came again and again and never tired and they were wild for him. Finally, they were exhausted. They all fell down on the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know man, you could do porn with a cock like that. It'd get you out of this dump. Maybe you should spend less time working on your biceps and get a real career.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trent passed out and Jake eyed him. He'd been fantasizing about this but now he just felt unsatisfied. He was still horny even! And even though he'd fucked the brains out of this boy, this boy still thought he was better than Jake--Jake, the most beautiful boy alive, probably.<br />
<br />
Jake picked up the phone following a pattern he didn't even realize was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back again, Mr. Brown? Still unsatisfied?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jake moaned. &quot;Yes, yes! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you still willing to pay the price?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything! Make me good enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then the deal is done!&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the man hung up and Jake passed out.</p>
