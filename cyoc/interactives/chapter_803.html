<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Clavin walked down the hallways toward Cody's room, he suddenly hears the sound of a bear roaring. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Huh? What?&quot; he thought as he stopped in his tracks. 
<br>

<br>
 He listened for the sound again and when it was silent, Calvin shrugged it off as a senior prank trying to scare the freshman into thinking a bear was loose on
<br>
 campus. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Pretty convincing if you ask me,&quot; he thought as he continued down the hall. 
<br>

<br>
 Cody on the otherhand was in his room, passed out and sound a sleep. It seems his load was enough to tucker him out, not to mention soak half the room and part
<br>
 of the floor outside his room. As Cody was sawing away logs, snoring like a bear, Calvin was approaching the room, not paying attention to the white sticky stuff
<br>
 that has coated a small portion of the hallway floor. With a loud *SQUISH!*, Calvn stopped dead in his track and looked down at the milky liquid. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Aw, man!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;Those faternity idiots!! Always making a mess and having people walk through them like dew on grass!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 He growled at the mess on his bare feet and went down and clean some of it up before someone else had to feel the discussing liquid on their feet. As he began to
<br>
 wipe up the mess, he accidentally got some of the liquid on his hands. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Aw, damn!&quot; he thought, &quot;Now, my hands are going to smell like alcohol! I don't need to be thrown out of this college because of that!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Without thinking, he ran to his room and quickly headed into the bathroom that was provided for him and his roommate, Bruce Bullford. When Calvin entered the
<br>
 bathroom, and went to wash his hands, he noticed that the liquid had quickly dried off. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That's funny,&quot; he thought, as he decided to wash his hands just in case. 
<br>

<br>
 Calvin felt lucky that his Bruce was not in his room or otherwise Bruce would think Calvin was in serious trouble. Calvin sighed and dried his hands off with another
<br>
 towel. He then went back into his room and tossed the milky colored stained towel on his bed. Calvin then went about getting dress, he put on a grey muscle shirt,
<br>
 red sweat pants (a bit baggy too), his blue boxers, grey and black cross trainer shoes, and a gold necklance with an oval attached to it with three claw marks
<br>
 slashed in the middle of it. Finally dressed, Calvin decided to take a sniff at the stuff on his towel, trying to determine what kind of alochol the frat boys were
<br>
 drinking. 
<br>

<br>
 He took a deep inhale and the let out a sigh of relief, &quot;Mmmm, this has an unusual smell, almost like it was partially.... honey.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 The thought began to swirl in his mind as he licked his lips passionly, almost as if he could taste the honey from the smell. Suddenly, he felt a pain in his cross
<br>
 trainers, as if the shoes were too tight. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yeow!&quot; he cried as he fell on his bed and try to get his shoes off. 
<br>

<br>
 Without warning, his shoes began to rip and tear, exposing a hairy and clawed humanoid bear feet! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;W-what is h-happening to me?&quot; he asked himself in horror as he witness his feet grow larger and fatter. 
<br>

<br>
 As Calvin watched the transformation of his feet, he failed to feel the tingling in his hands as they began to grow hair and size. Calvin snapped his head to his hands
<br>
 and cried out in shock at the second transformation on his body. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING TO ME?!&quot; he cried out to the entire world. 
<br>

<br>
 He watched as his feet, once Size 9s-Double Cs, turn into a Size 20 Triple E! They suddenly stopped growing and hung in the air, just barely above the ground.
<br>
 He looked at his hands and saw they had stopped growing too, though now they looked more like a hairy clawed giant's hands then his regular thing hands. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;How did this happen?&quot; he thought as he was in disbelief at his current state, which made him look like the Beast from the early years of the X-Men. 
<br>

<br>
 He began to ponder this and almost crushed his entire hand from his giantic hands. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Gotta be careful,&quot; he thought as he set his massive hairy hands on his bed, &quot;Where and how did this happen?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 He began to think again.</p>
