<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>As Tom pulled up to the driveway while his garage door had just finished opening, Tom could not help but feeling an odd pull toward the 
case that the moon rock was in. Tom had no idea what was in the case at that time, all he knew was what the paper told him in the vanilla 
envelope that he received at the same time Rick handed him the black unmarked case. The instructions were somewhat vague, but for the most 
part, it was clear as day. The note read:</br>
<center><em><br>Dear Mr. Martin,</br>
<br>We at NASA have decided that you are the best candidate for our new program. We have been charged by the President to see what affects 
the moon has on an individual at close proximity. We have enclosed an item within the case that we believe will be able to help in this regard. 
There are further instructions in the case once you get home to your place of residence. You are not, under any circumstances, to open the 
case until you have arrived home. Since we are unsure of how you may or may not react to the item enclosed, it would be extremely dangerous 
for you and everyone else around you to open the case before you are in a controlled environment.</br>
<br>Please open the case and follow the directions inside for the best results to manifest, if there are any.</br>
<br>With our best regards and deepest gratitude for your service and the role that you are playing in this project.</br>
<br>NASA</br></em></center>
<br>Even though Tom knew that he was being used by NASA and the government as a whole, a part of him didn't mind. A part of him, a part 
that seemed to be growing deep within him, was grateful to be a part of this experiment. This same part of him seemed to be new, intense and 
invigorating. Tom felt as though he were several years younger, even though he was thirty-five in mind and body. Whatever was inside of that 
case, especially after it was exposed, was going to change his life forever and potentially the rest of his family... the thing was, Tom had no 
clue how right he was.</br>
<br>Once the car was parked and situated inside of the garage, Tom grabbed the case as he got out of his vehicle and walked to the door to 
go inside his home. As he opened the door and started to step through the threshold, Tom hit the button to close the garage door and then 
closed the regular door behind him. As he entered, Tom called out in the house to announce his presence. While Tom didn't really care if 
anyone acknowledged his presence, he just wanted people to know that he was home incase he was needed by someone for anything. Tom's 
mind, however, was transfixed on that case and seeing what was inside. As Tom walked into the main room of the house, he sat the case on 
the ataman table in front of the six seater and very comfortable recliner sofa. Tom placed both his hands on the case, directly over the clasps 
that secured the case in the first place and hesitated before applying the pressure needed to unfasten the clasps. With a loud and audible 'pop' 
the case loosened slightly and Tom immediately felt an increase of energy being given off by whatever was inside of it by a measure of ten. 
Tom could not believe how much energy he could feel, let alone how it made him feel. The only thing that he could tell at this moment was that 
he felt several years younger, possibly as early as an eighteen year old boy! Tom sat there and stared at the case, getting lost in thought, 
wondering how it would make his seventeen year old son feel. Tom wanted to know how it would affect everyone else and he wanted to know 
at that very moment. There was a strong, driving force in him now, and it was a desire to have numerous people feel exactly how he did.</br>
<br>"Brandon, Denise, and Joy... if you three are home, you guys need to come down to the living room right now!" Tom called out at the top 
of his lungs, making sure that everyone heard him. What Tom thought was odd, was the fact that he wasn't even out of breath or strained from 
calling out to all three of them at once like he used to get when he made dinner and wanted to let everyone know that the food was ready.
</br>
<br>Suddenly, almost out of no where, Tom could hear a loud rumbling from the second floor. That rumbling quickly turned into a stampede 
of footsteps as all six feet started running through the upstairs hallway, down the stair case and the rumblings lessened as they moved quickly 
closer to him in the living room.</br>
<br>Tom took note of that, since before taking possession of the container, he never heard so much as a sound from any movement upstairs. 
As his kids and wife came into view, he could see that his son was looking slightly different from how he looked that morning when Tom left 
for work in the first place. Brandon’s physique was a bit more defined and everywhere there was exposed skin, there was dark brown hairs 
coating his skin. Brandon’s legs, arms, exposed chest and face was hairy. Tom could not believe that his son already had a thick, one inch 
covering of stubble on his face since this morning, especially since up till now, Brandon couldn’t even grow facial hair! The thing that was the 
most surprising was that he didn’t have the muscle tone or the thick amount of dark hair, especially because Brandon’s hair was light brown 
and was barely noticeable on his body.</br>
<br>As Brandon got close to Tom, Tom noticed that his son was looking at him strangely, but he had no clue why. As Denise and Joy got close 
to Tom, since they were close behind Brandon, they too started to look at Tom strangely.</br>
<br>”Honey…” Denise said with a long pause, “… what is going on with your ears and your face?” She finally asked.</br>
<br>”What do you mean Denise?” Tom asked quizzically.</br>
<br>”Well… you have a nice one inch beard going on like your son does all of a sudden… which is strange on it’s own, but your ears look kind 
of pointed!” She said bluntly.</br>
<br>Wondering what she was talking about, thinking that she was crazy, Tom reached up and felt his ears. Upon doing so, he noticed that 
they did come to a slight point and were a little hairy, which was odd, because they weren’t like that ever before.</br>
<br>”What the hell is going on here!?” Tom called out.</br>
<br>”I… I don’t know honey, but what ever it is… it seems to be happening to you men since you brought that case in here!” Denise said in a 
soft tone.</br>
<br>”Yeah… I have to be honest… I was feeling kind of strange since I first received it from NASA.” Tom said in a lost and dazed voice, his 
eyes locked on the case.</br>
<br>Wanting to see exactly what was in the case, Tom started opening it and Denise quickly stopped him.</br>
<br>”Do you really think that you should even open that? I mean, what if you open that and something happens?” Denise asked concerned for 
the safety of everyone.</br>
<br>”What the hell do you think you are doing?!” Tom lashed out. “I want to see what is in here and you are not going to stop me!”</br>
<br>As Tom lashed out, Brandon sat next to his father and they both stared at the case, intently gazing upon it, curious to see what was inside 
of it finally. Denise recoiled at the unusual outburst and Joy stood closer to her mother, fearful of whatever might happen. Something out of the 
ordinary was definitely at work here and they had no idea what it could have been.</br>
<br>Slowly, Tom lifted the lid of the case and finally opened it completely for the very first time. Inside, set in the middle of a lot of soft gray 
sponge was a large rock that sparkled against the light in the room. The rock was a large chunk of various minerals and ores that formed the 
larger body that is known as the moon, which had billions of facets that glinted and sparkled in the room. To all of them, the piece of the moon 
was a sight to behold, but to Tom and Brandon, there was a serious draw to the stone. It was as if the rock called out to them, to something 
deep within them that had laid dormant and was never before stirred. Now, in their presence, the stone did just that and neither of them were 
interested in giving up how they felt.</br>
<br>“Tom…” Denise called out in a soft and concerned tone, “What do you plan on doing with that thing?”</br>
<br>Hearing Denise’s voice, Tom snapped out of his stupor. “Oh… um…” Tom thoughtlessly blurted out while thinking back to the question 
his wife asked and with it in mind, Tom continued, “Oh… um… I was thinking we could place it on the mantle! It would be the perfect spot for 
it… don’t you think Brandon?”</br>
<br>In silent reply, Brandon simply nodded his head, as if the words traveled through his cranium as though it were an empty cavern and went 
in one ear and directly out the other after a few reverberations.</br>
<br>“Well then! I guess it is settled and the rock will be placed on the mantle for everyone to see!” Tom said with an excited tone in his voice.
</br>
<br>Not knowing what else to do, Denise simply nodded and agreed with Tom. Concerned for both her husband and her son, Denise started 
walking back slowly while fumbling around for Joy’s hand behind her body without even looking.</br>
<br> “Well… you two boys have fun with your new center piece… Joy and I are going to go to the supermarket for some groceries for dinner! 
We will be back soon…” Denise said, trailing off with Joy looking at her with a raised eyebrow, wondering what she was talking about.</br>
<br>Denise turned around, grabbed her daughter’s hand and dragged her toward the door to the garage. As Denise put her shoes on, with her 
daughter following suit albeit hesitantly, Denise watched her husband place the moon rock on the mantle and sit back down on the sofa with 
no other noticeable physical changes to him or Brandon, from what she could see of her son from where she was. As Denise’s foot slipped into 
her shoe, she looked over and saw that Joy already had hers on and was waiting for whatever was next. Looking at her mother, Joy could see 
that Denise was concerned both for the health and safety of her husband and son by how much distress she could see on her mother’s face.
</br>
<br>Wanting to let the guys know that they were leaving, Denise called out to them both. “Ok guys… we are leaving for the store! Holler if you 
need anything while we are out!”</br>
<br>Hoping there would have been some sort of response, Denise stood there for a moment and waited, but to her dismay… there wasn’t as 
so much of a peep from either male. Thinking that she didn’t have time to lose, Denise and Joy left the house to the boys and the rock, not 
thinking that much would happen when they were gone. What she didn’t know was that the damage was already done and things in the 
household would be changed forever.</br>
<br>As Brandon and Tom heard the door to the garage close, with the garage door opening, the two looked at each other and smiled. As 
Brandon looked at his father, in his eyes he saw a man, not a man who fathered him. Brandon also took note of Tom’s physical attributes. 
Tom’s ears came to more of a point; his teeth looked sharper and longer like fangs; his body seemed bigger and more muscular; and he 
definitely looked hairier than Brandon could remember. On the other hand, Tom saw another man, not his son, who looked like he was in his 
mid-thirties and not his teens. Brandon’s physical features were similar to Tom’s now, but his muscles had increased in size three fold and he 
looked older… like he was a thirty-five year old man with the shape and definition to his face, with the age lines included. To anyone looking 
from the outside in, they would just see two men hanging out that were nearly the same age.</br>
<br>The thing was, Brandon and Tom’s life was changing forever, each and every minute that they were in front of that stone. Nothing could 
change this and nothing could undo what was being done to them. Soon, the rock would awaken their full forms as a werewolf and when that 
happened, life all over the planet would be different. NASA wanted to have werewolves at their control and disposal to do whatever they wanted 
them to do. The problem was and this was something NASA didn’t plan for… these pure, genetic werewolves were beyond control and death 
itself. Their bodies were so genetically advanced that their bodies will heal instantly at the moment that they were injured. So if someone 
decided to try and chop their heads off, for instance, the cut would heal as soon as the blade allowed the tissue to touch again.</br>
<br>Now… there were a few questions that were left to answer and they were:</br>
<br>
	<li>What were Denise and Joy up to?</li>
	<li>What was NASA planning to do with the werewolves in the first place?</li>
	<li>What was going to happen to Brandon and Tom?</li>
