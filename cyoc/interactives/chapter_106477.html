<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he prepared to leave, Mike Lawson couldn&#39;t help noticing that his granddaughter Spencer got into the back seat of his car with her boyfriend Eric Anderson.<br />
&quot;You kids going to do some more canoodling on the way to school?&quot; he asked with a smile.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; asked Eric, not knowing the term.<br />
&quot;He wants to know if we&#39;re going to kiss and neck on the way to school,&quot; Spencer explained to him.<br />
&quot;If there&#39;s enough time,&quot; replied Eric, while putting his arm lovingly around Spencer. &quot;By the way Yin,&quot; he said, using the name Frieda Knight coined for her, because of her fur color compared to Eric&#39;s when in their were forms (black fur = feminine/Yin, white fur = masculine/Yang), &quot;did you take your pill this morning?&quot;<br />
&quot;You better believe it Yang,&quot; Spencer replied happily, between kisses. &quot;Now that we <i>fully</i> get to enjoy each other&#39;s company now that you&#39;re finally a werepanther, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to cut our time short prematurely by getting pregnant before we&#39;re—&quot;<br />
And then Spencer stopped herself in mid-word. <i>Was I about to say married?</i> she asked herself, before realizing the idea of someday becoming Mrs. Spencer Anderson was quite appealing.<br />
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; both men in the car wondered, but Eric actually asked. &quot;You stopped and started staring off into space for a moment there.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah. Just had a lovely thought cross my mind for a second there,&quot; said Spencer with a smile.<br />
&quot;Care to share it with us?&quot; inquired her grandfather.<br />
&quot;Someday,&quot; was Spencer&#39;s only reply, before resuming her brief make out session with Eric.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Unlike her friends, Frieda Knight&#39;s ride to school was quiet and uneventful.<br />
Then again, that was a nice change considering everything that happened to her so far this morning.<br />
Her mother decided to drive herself into town, leaving Frieda to ride with her father.<br />
Both she and her father never spoke in route. Frieda knew what was on her mind, and could only hazard a guess at best in regards to his thoughts.<br />
But just as he pulled into the school parking lot to let her out for the day, Benton Knight spoke.<br />
&quot;I know I haven&#39;t been the best of fathers, and I have a long way to go to make amends to you and everyone else I&#39;ve offended over the last couple of days. It will take time, and I&#39;ll be the first to admit that it isn&#39;t going to be easy for me, but I hope you&#39;ll at least give me a fair chance to do so.&quot;<br />
&quot;As long as you make an honest and sincere effort to do so,&quot; said Frieda, giving him a smile before she got out of the vehicle. In her opinion, no matter how much Benton Knight may change his ways because of recent events, both he and her mother had a long way to go before she could ever think of her parents as a more friendly and loving dad and mom like most kids did theirs.<br />
&quot;I have a ride home this afternoon but don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be home by curfew,&quot; she added, standing in front of the car before closing the door. It was just a very light misting rain now that didn&#39;t bother her at all.<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; replied her father. &quot;Maybe over dinner tonight we can talk about the changes that need to be made around the house and other matters,&quot; he suggested.<br />
&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Frieda said and gave him a genuine smile. <i>Especially if they&#39;re for the better.</i> &quot;I&#39;ll see you tonight.&quot;<br />
Then she closed the passenger door and watched her father drive off .<br />
<br />
Frieda stood outside the school entrance, anxiously waiting for her friends to arrive.<br />
When she saw the car belonging to Spencer&#39;s grandfather pull in, Frieda almost jumped for joy and ran toward it, getting even more excited to see both Spencer AND Eric get out of the back seat.<br />
But just as it was about to pull out, Frieda walked over to the driver&#39;s side and said &quot;Mister Lawson?&quot;<br />
&quot;Please. That was my father and he&#39;s no longer with us. I&#39;m Mike, Spencer&#39;s grandfather,&quot; he said proudly, holding out his hand through the open driver&#39;s window.<br />
&quot;Frieda Knight,&quot; she replied, returning the handshake. &quot;I&#39;d like to ask a favor of you, if I may.&quot;<br />
&quot;If I can honor it, sure,&quot; said Mike. &quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re picking them up this afternoon too, can you please take the three of us to the diner?&quot;<br />
&quot;No problem. Just be with them ready to go when I get here. See you then,&quot; promised Mike, before driving off.<br />
&quot;Have I got news for you two!&quot; said Frieda happily, while hugging both Spencer and Eric at the same time.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE ON CAMPUS...<br />
Coming off the school bus, Brian Walker entered Moon Lake High with the rest of the riders.<br />
He wasn&#39;t surprised to see Principal Ian Andrews standing inside the doorway, for there usually was an adult of some school position there every morning, but Brian was totally surprised when the Principal asked him to stop for a moment.<br />
&quot;Is there something wrong sir?&quot; asked Brian.<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering,&quot; began the Principal. &quot;Rumor has it that you&#39;ve been picked up for the last three days straight by someone other than your mother.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh. You mean my Aunt Alyssa?&quot; asked Brian, instantly replying with the cover story he and Alyssa Cooper had previously worked out in case anyone inquired about her.<br />
&quot;Aunt?&quot; asked the Principal in return, not recalling any next of kin listed in the student&#39;s file.<br />
&quot;Yes. She lives in California but will only be in Moon Lake on vacation for a short time, so since my mom works two jobs, she&#39;s been picking me up so we&#39;d have more time together instead of me taking the bus home too.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; said the Principal, realizing there may have been a mistake. &quot;But there has also been some other gossip concerning you and the lady.&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard some of it too. Part of that is my own fault,&quot; admitted Brian. &quot;After everything that&#39;s happened with Julie Stovall, I just didn&#39;t feel like talking about my aunt with anyone. Yet I&#39;ve done absolutely nothing to encourage the rumors either.&quot; Which was true. Brian had stayed very quiet about Alyssa Cooper, especially about what he and the older were-mermaid had been doing each afternoon for the last three days after school.<br />
Principal Andrews simply nodded his head affirmatively. There was plenty of scuttlebutt concerning Brian Walker and the lady in the red convertible, but nothing that could be confirmed. Especially considering the student before him had never said anything himself that he was aware of before now, and as Principal, he was aware of a lot.<br />
&quot;How long will your aunt be in Moon Lake?&quot; he asked.<br />
&quot;Not sure,&quot; admitted Brian. &quot;She has to be back at her job the Monday after next, but when she&#39;s actually planning to leave is still undecided,&quot; he answered, thinking back to some of the conversation he and Alyssa had last night.<br />
&quot;Very well. You do understand though that, given the nature of the gossip involved, for your own safety and that of the school itself, I had to ask,&quot; explained Principal Andrews.<br />
&quot;Yes sir. I&#39;ll try to straighten this out if any of these rumor spreaders actually say something to my face,&quot; promised Brian.<br />
&quot;Understood,&quot; said the Principal, before walking off.<br />
It was a good minute or so after Principal Andrews left before Brian Walker finally breathed a sigh of relief and went on to his first period class.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
&quot;So when you turn 21, you take over your father&#39;s position in the Elder&#39;s Council?&quot; asked Yin and Yang in disbelief.<br />
&quot;Apparently. I&#39;ll be representing all the werepanthers of Moon Lake. Including you honey,&quot; said Frieda, before giving Eric a quick peck on the cheek. &quot;The biggest things I&#39;m happy about at the moment are no more being grounded and my parents can&#39;t ever go through on their plans to send me off someplace to be a <i>proper lady</i>.&quot;<br />
&quot;You&#39;re already a proper lady in my book,&quot; replied Spencer, before giving Frieda a hug.<br />
&quot;Mine too,&quot; said Eric, hugging their friend as well. &quot;So I guess going to the diner after school is for celebrating?&quot; he wondered.<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s the case, I have a basement rec room that already smells like hot sex,&quot; Spencer whispered in Frieda&#39;s ear, as Eric started to blush. &quot;Care to stake your claim down there too?&quot;<br />
Frieda stared at her friends with lust in eyes, realizing why Eric was blushing. &quot;I&#39;d love too,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;but there&#39;s another reason I wanted to go to the diner this afternoon,&quot; she added, while texting on her cellphone.<br />
&quot;What?&quot; wondered Eric.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m trying to put the band back together,&quot; said Frieda.<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; asked Spencer, beating Eric to the question.<br />
But before Frieda replied, the warning bell that signaled there was only ten minutes left before first period and the school day began rang.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll explain later,&quot; promised Frieda, &quot;and keep those libidos burning for me,&quot; she added, giving Spencer and Eric each a quick kiss on the lips before entering the school building for the day.</p>
