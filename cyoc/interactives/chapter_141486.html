<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Gloria now called everyone, Kellie approached Josh. After years of reality hopping and magical adventures Kellie had become quite adept at finding out information from people without an issue. As she looked at Josh her initial impression of the boy was that he appeared decent enough if perhaps somewhat naive. “Should be able to get what I’m looking for,” Kellie thought. “And hopefully steer him away from Katie.”<br />
<br />
“Excuse me,” Kellie smiled, approaching the young man. “Can you help me? I’m trying to find the student union, I’m supposed to me meeting my daughter here today.”<br />
<br />
Josh smiled at Kellie pointing to the building they were currently standing in front of. “It’s right he miss,” hevsaid warmly. “Oh gosh thank you,” Kellie sighed. “It’s my first time visiting, my daughter. I’ve never been at this part f the campus.”<br />
<br />
“Understandable,” Josh said quietly. “It’s kind of set aside from the resident halls so it’s only natural. I’m Josh by the way.”<br />
<br />
“So nice to meet you Josh,” Kellie said sweetly. “I’m Kellie. Kellie O’Toole.”<br />
<br />
Joshs eyes went wide as Kellie gave him a sacrilege smile. As she watched his body language she could see that the boy was surprised to her and appeared to be making a connection between herself and Katie. “Are,” he stammered. “Are you related to Katie O’Toole?”<br />
<br />
“Why yes,” Kellie said happily. “That’s my daughter, why do you know her?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Josh said sheepishly. “We were supposed to meet here for coffee.” Kellie nodded smiling, obviously her appearance was making him uncomfortable. “Well then I suppose this will be a triple date then Josh,” she smirked. “How lovely, it will give me a chance to get to know you.”<br />
<br />
“I suppose,” Josh said weakly. “To be honest, I’m..um surprised Katie hasn’t mentioned you in the past.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a long story Josh but needless to say I’m not around very often,” she said casually. “I dropped by though to pay her a visit. Now if I can ask you a question, how well have you gotten to know Katie? Is this a recent thing between you two?”<br />
<br />
“Well we’ve had classes together for a couple of years,” he said. “I just recently decided to ask her out for coffee. I was pleasantly surprised she accepted.”<br />
<br />
“I see,” Kellie smirked. “So you’ve been admiring her from a far. Must be difficult, wanting to get to know someone so badly and never getting the opportunity. It’s miraculous....almost magical that you seem to have finally gotten your chance.”<br />
<br />
Josh paled slightly as Kellie continued to study him, her questions and appearance had definitely made the boy uncomfortable. As she watched the boy carefully she could see small beads of sweat forming on his brow. Deciding to press a little more, Kelllie leaned in, a look of faux concern on her face. “Josh are you feeling alright? You look pale.”<br />
<br />
“I..I’m fine,” he stammered.<br />
<br />
“Are you sure,” Kellie said coyly. “Because in my experience when someone looks as uncomfortable as you do right now they are obviously hiding something. So tell me Josh, what is it you’re not telling me?”<br />
<br />
“Its Nothing,” he said quickly. “Guess I’m just anxious for Katie to arrive?” Kellie nodded as she leaned back in her seat, giving Josh a knowing look. “That could be the case. That or Morgan told you this would be easy.”<br />
<br />
Joshs jaw went slack as he nervously gazed around. “No it’s nothing like that,” he replied. “Umm, I’m sorry, I should probably get going, there’s something I should attend too.” As the boy went to stand he noticed Kellie flick her wrist, as she did he suddenly found himself rooted to his seat unable to move. “Not so fast Romeo,” Kellie said as Josh looked at her fearfully. “You see, I am already well aware of you Josh. I know your feelings for my daughter, I’m aware of your desire to be with her and the help you are getting to make that dream a reality.”<br />
<br />
“H..how,”;Joshnsaid fearfully,still unable to move. “How do you know that?”<br />
<br />
“Magic of course,”Kellie exclaimed, a malicious smile crossing her face. “What? Did you really think your friend was the only one? I hate to disappoint you Josh but their are MANY people in this world with magic. You just happen to fall for the daughter of a very powerful magic user.” Josh began to sweat a little more profusiously as Kellie appeared to stare daggers into him. While her pleasant tone and sweet smile was meant to be warm, Josh could feel a rage in the woman’s presence. A rage that he would try to manipulate this woman’s daughter into falling in love with him. “The mistress will be very angry,” he whispered.<br />
<br />
“So you are her slave then,” Kellie mused. “Interesting, I was not sure if you were working with her or if you were tricked into doing her bidding. Regardless Josh you are going to tell me everything I wish to know.”<br />
<br />
“What if I refuse,” he answered, attempting to put on a brave face. Kellie giggled softly as she beckoned towards a nearby tree. As the two watched Josh gaped as the tree began to grow smaller. The branches became thinner as it grew smaller, reliving its life cycle in reverse. Slowly but surely the once tall tree reentered the ground, vamnishing from sight as if it never existed. As Josh looked around he could see that no one appeared to react to the fact the woman in front of him had unmade a tree. “Yes Josh I erased the tree from existence,” she said. “I have the power to do that. As an added bonus, the only ones that remember the tree even existing are you and me. I wonder, what would happen if I unmade you. I mean I would be the only one that remembered you.”<br />
<br />
“You can do that,” Josh whispered, his voice cracking. Kellie nodded as she continued to smile. “I have and I will again if need be. So tell me Josh, why is it your so intent on getting akatie to fall in love with you and destroying her engagement?”<br />
<br />
“I didn’t know she was engaged,” he said quietly. “I...I just wanted to get to know her better. She, my mistress said it was possible to not only get her to notice me but fall in love with me. I just wanted to be with her.”<br />
<br />
“You coveted my daughter,” Kellie said frankly. “To you she’s just a possession, something for you say you had. You don’t care about her feelings, your selfish desires are what motivated you. You don’t care for her, not like her friends, family and fiancé do. You lust for her in a primal way and your willing to do whatever it takes to get your way.”<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry,” he said meekly. “Please...let me go.”<br />
<br />
“Soon,” Kellie smiled. “But first your going to tell me everything. What deal did you make with Morgan? Is Katie under her control and where is she hiding now?”<br />
<br />
As Josh agreed Kellie could only lean back and smile. She was able to interrogate the boy successfully and was now ready to learn Morgan’s plan. With any luck she would be able to learn exactly what Morgan had told Josh.</p>
