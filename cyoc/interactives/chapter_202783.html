<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rob stood in front of the toilet looking down at cleavage and breasts that completely blocked any ability to see down to the penis he no longer had so couldn’t pee with anyway. His contemplation was cut short by the rapidly growing need to pee, and pee now! Sighing, Rob turned front to back in order to sit, oblivious to the ease with which he moved in the high heels. Lowering his panties was not hard but felt oddly complicated. He had to thread his hands through the dangling dress fringe then under the dress hemline and back up to his small waist trapped under the snug dress in order to grab and wriggle the panties down over his plump ass and finally all the way down to his heels. The real problem was the dress. He was able to wiggle and bunch the hemline up above his ass where it would stay but the damned fringe was hanging everywhere. Hurrying because the demand to pee was about to burst, Rob put both hands behind his ass and swept the dangling fringe forward both left and right and captured what was now a rope&#8209;like bundle of fringe in his lap, allowing him to sit. No sooner had his weight settled onto the toilet than a powerful spray of pee burst forth unprompted. The place the pee came from was very different feeling and the sound it made was distinctly female.<br />
<br />
Relieved now, Rob carefully bundled all of the dress fringe strings into one hand and awkwardly used the other to one-handedly grab toilet paper and wipe while holding the fringe out of the way with the other hand. Now Rob worked out a modified reverse procedure of standing up, dropping the fringe, wriggling the panties back up over his ass and into place, and finally shimmying the dress hem back down. <br />
<br />
“Fuck me! What a pain in the ass, I will be so glad to get back to zip and pee,” Rob said returning.<br />
<br />
Kathy giggled to hear Rob’s high pitched little female voice saying things only a man would say. “Oh please, sit verses stand, big deal! How different could it be?”<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t say that if you’d ever had the experience. Trust me, it’s much better to be a guy.”<br />
<br />
“I want to try it then,” Kathy declared excitedly.<br />
<br />
“What, pee standing up? You can’t, you’re a girl,” Rob said.<br />
<br />
‘That too,’ Kathy thought devilishly, but said, “Ahem … So are you Captain Obvious.”<br />
<br />
“But ….,” Rob stared wide eyed with a look of cute befuddlement.<br />
<br />
“We already know we can do this, at least we certainly better be able to, or you will be bouncing and jiggling the rest of your life. It’ll only take a minute, I’ll use the shoes while you touch me and think about making me a guy,” Kathy said excitedly.<br />
<br />
“I’m not so sure about this,” Rob said taking Kathy’s hand. “Just a guy generically or do I need to visualize details?”<br />
<br />
“I’m not sure but how about this; visualize making me you, the guy you, that should be detailed enough, but make sure I get a big dick, I want a big dick,” Kathy chortled.<br />
<br />
“Dick size won’t make a difference peeing,” Rob said.<br />
<br />
“Maybe not, but if I’m going to try it I want a big dick … oh and balls to match. I want balls!”<br />
“Guy’s have balls Kathy, they’re not optional extras. Give me a moment,” Rob said closing his eyes and trying to visualize Kathy as a version of his male self with an eight inch dick. At first he was reluctant but it slowly became easier then intriguing as his imagination took flight.<br />
<br />
It was befuddling for Kathy to keep in mind who’s hand she was holding as she watched the over endowed woman slowly smile and lightly wet her lips. Exceptionally pleased with herself, Kathy grinned wickedly when she saw Rob’s nipples harden and poke out dramatically. When Rob’s full lips opened slightly in obvious arousal, Kathy knew it was time. ”Shoes become red sling back sandals with seven inch platform stilettos.”<br />
<br />
“Wha ...what,” Rob squeaked blushing. “I thought you wanted …,” and stopped when he opened his eyes to see a diminutive version of himself, his guy self, wearing woman’s shoes. “Why did you…”<br />
<br />
“I had to make a height change to invoke the magic,” the small male Kathy said in her new masculine voice. “I guess I was thinking like a girl when I commanded the shoes,” she fibbed.<br />
<br />
“Whatever, go ahead and see how much better peeing is now,” Rob said in his little high voice that sounded even higher to Kathy now.<br />
<br />
“Uh, can’t. I’m still wearing panties. I need to see the package first.” Dropping Rob’s cargo shorts she stepped out of them still wearing heals and looked down at her new package bulging uncomfortably against the panties. Excited, she stripped the panties off as well and stood there fondling her new gender and thrilled to the feeling of her new penis hardening, it was like nothing she’d ever experienced. Fully erect and silly looking, Kathy smiled at the very impressive eight inch cock she sported.<br />
<br />
Kathy looked at Rob and smiled to see his gaze riveted on her erect cock. It was obvious now that the other unseen changes she’d attempted on Rob had worked like a charm. Grinning with anticipation, Kathy said, “Shoes change to thin soled slippers.”<br />
<br />
Rob gasped and his nipples became painfully hard when Kathy became suddenly seven inches taller, impressively more muscular and now sported a prodigious erection that had to be around ten inches. “Fuck,” Rob whispered to himself wide eyed.<br />
<br />
Kathy leered at her big boobed little boy friend. Her large cock began to pulse with excited demand. She could smell Rob’s arousal. She smiled at the thought that Rob believed this to be about nothing more than peeing standing up, but there was so much more she wanted to try. Kathy slipped her strong male arm around the back of Rob and tilted him back so she could kiss his full soft lips.<br />
<br />
Rob felt himself grabbed and kissed. It was a wonderful kiss but tilted back as he was he found himself to be completely helpless, he was utterly dependent on Kathy ending the kiss and lifting him back to his feet.  As soon as he was brought back up, Kathy turned him around front to back and bent him forward until his forearms were on a nearby chair. “Wait … what,” he squeaked telling himself that what he knew was happening wasn’t happening. “This isn’t …,” he started to say when he felt Kat’s large hands hike his dress hem up over his hips and pull down his panties. “Wait, I’m not … .”<br />
<br />
“Ready? You’re very ready. I can smell your arousal and you’re soaking wet,” Kathy whispered in Rob’s ear.<br />
<br />
“That’s not … aaaahh uuhhh aaahhhheeee eeeeee iiiiiiii,” Rob screamed in unfamiliar desperate passion as his girlfriend rammed her huge cock into him again and again in a relentless torture of delight utterly beyond his experience. He wanted to scream STOP STOP but no words would form. On the edge of what was surely the most fabulous death in the universe, Rob felt Kathy slam powerfully and deeply into him one last time and hold him there. He could feel her pulsing and spurting cum deep into him. It was humiliating and it was the most marvelous experience of his life!<br />
<br />
“Oh my god,” Kathy panted. “I had no idea! No wonder men are so sex driven, that was beyond amazing,” she said holding Rob locked in place until she softened.</p>
