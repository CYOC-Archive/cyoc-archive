<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Issac lumbered towards the wolf cultist, his cocks continuously leaking and his mind filled with a carnal hunger.<br />
<br />
   As he towered over the weaker creature, the wolf cultist couldn’t help but shoot out a spurt of cream, the cum splattering all over his and Issac’s chests.<br />
<br />
  With all four arms, Issac pushed the wolf towards his chest, lifting him up slightly, as he began grinding his two cocks between their bodies, cum practically pouring out and completely coating their bodies with the friction.<br />
<br />
The wolf moaned in a needy pleasure, almost instinctually latching onto Issac’s granite nipples, sucking on them like a cub.<br />
<br />
  Issac groaned at the sensation and continued to thrust his cocks between them, rewarding the slutty wolf by gently enveloping his maw around the wolf’s newly enlarged horse cock, sampling the corruptive essence. Although the wolf cum’s potency was nothing compared to Issac’s own essence, Issac still relished the taste, milking the horse cock with a great devotion.<br />
<br />
  The wolf moaned, his cries of pleasure muffled by the elemental nipple he sucked on.<br />
<br />
   The wolf’s body was changing. His chest coated with so much cum, his body was beginning to absorb the latent corruption within Issac’s chest. His cock lengthened inside Issac’s mouth, and his balls became swollen with newfound corruptive power. The most drastic change was that of his body. His fur gained a dark purple hue, his eyes glowing with a purple flame and his body seemed to change from being icy cold and searing hot at the same time. <br />
<br />
    Issac noticed the change and grinned, continuing to milk the wolf’s cock until he finally reached his orgasm, the wolf moaning through Issac’s nipple in delight, the horse cock spurted out a mouthful of cum now tinted with purple and full of invigorating corrupt power, similar to Issac’s. <br />
<br />
 When he finally released the wolf’s cock, Issac’s maw was lined with the wolf’s cum.<br />
<br />
The wolf panted, his cock still ready for a second round as his ecstasy at the feeling of being enveloped by Issac’s hard muscular arms gave him a feeling of content.<br />
<br />
    Issac felt a almost paternal desire spark up at him as he saw the panting wolf resting against his chest, still desperately sucking on Issac’s nipples. The void in his soul caused by Ilvir disappearance was beginning to fill now, all he needed to do now was to complete the process he had started and turn the wolf into his full fledge spawn. <br />
<br />
  However, even in his state of heavy lust, Issac wouldn’t. He needed to take back what was his first. Ilvir was out there, his cocks desired to breed his hole and he would take no more spawn until then.<br />
<br />
    Gingerly, he slowly dropped the wolf onto the floor, gently placing him against the all of the room for him to rest. Issac could see that the cultist was tired from their sexual act, his breaths deep and his eyes beginning to rest, but he would quickly recover, especially since the wolf had yet to absorb all of Issac’s cum into his body.<br />
<br />
Issac, the musky cloud over his mind now fading slighty after his time with the wolf, turned to the other cultist. A brown anthropomorphic rabbit deer hybrid. Although his twin cocks were small compared to his own, his voluptuous body was nothing to scoff at, and Issac felt a stirring in his cocks as he stared at the cultists brown furred ass, a cute small tail decorating the entrance to his hole.<br />
<br />
  For some reason, the horned cultist hadn’t joined in on the fun between the wolf and Issac. They were instead content to just watch, jerking himself off at the sight. His eyes glazed over as he mindlessly stroked himself to Issac’s grand form.<br />
<br />
     “You are a follower of a man named Lubricus are you not?” Issac questioned, his deep rumbling voice snapping the horned cultist from their daze.<br />
<br />
“Y-yes, oh wonderful paladin, we are.” He answered obediently but in a hushed whispered tone.<br />
<br />
“I had seen you and your peers enacting a ritual in this very room. What was that rituals purpose?” Issac asked, motioning to the ritual sight around him with a granite hand.<br />
<br />
 “Oh! That is simple. Within the Athenaeum, my wonderful leader Lubricus had found a ritual that was the first step in granting us great power, he had gone to great lengths to retrieve it. We were close to feeding our corruptive juices to the Catalyst, but when me and my friend returned to scout out the area it was gone.”<br />
<br />
Issac nodded. “I believe I have this Catalyst you speak of.”<br />
<br />
  The deer cultist’s face broke out into a gleeful smile. “What wonderful news! Then if you have it, we must bring word to Lubricus and complete the ritual!” The deer exclaimed, making a move to exit the room, but was stopped by Issac’s granite hand, who firmly grabbed his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“W-what is it great paladin?” The cultist asked with a worried tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
Issac moved his mouth closer to the hybrid’s ear, his maw, larger than the cultist’s head, becoming only inches way from the cultist’s ear. “I would like to hear more of this ritual and to meet your Leader, but I have not forgotten you, only one of you two has to go. Tell your wolfish friend to send word to Lubricus, you however will accompany me here as we wait...”  Issac whispered in the deer’s rabbit ears, his tone hungry and seductive.<br />
<br />
The cultist’s eyes glazed over with lust and a giddy anticipation, his two cocks noticeably spurting out cum at the though as he eagarly nodded and headed towards his friend, who was just beginning to recover from his exhaustion.<br />
<br />
 How strange Issac noted. He hadn’t even penetrated the wolf’s ass and yet the wolf seemed to be exhausted. Why was that? Had Issac been too rough with him somehow, was Issac’s own stamina much more vast than he thought it was, or was it something else? Issac made sure to save that thought for further pondering later.<br />
<br />
He watched with some mild amusement as the deer rabbit gently shook the wolf who had been lightly napping awake.<br />
<br />
  “Loben, wake up now.” The deer whispered.<br />
<br />
“Huh?” Mumbled the wolf,  whose eyes started become awake with alertness.<br />
<br />
Upon fully waking, the two cultists began to converse through a complex sign language that Issac could not understand. After a short while of communication, the wolf whose name was apparently Loben nodded, and got up, putting his robes back on over his naked form and giving Issac a respectful bow before heading presumably towards Lubricus’ lair, his cock leaving a trail of cum as he left.<br />
<br />
When Loben left to send word to Lubricus, Issac was left alone with the deer hybrid cultist.<br />
<br />
    Issac saw the remaining cultist begin to speak, but never let a single sound escape from his muzzle as with all four hands he pushed and pinned the cultist to the wall, covering the cultist’s mouth with one arm as he gave a deep primal growl that reverberated throughout his body, pushing the deer against the wall until there was no space between his giant body and the wall, squeezing the deer.<br />
<br />
 The deer’s eyes widened with both fear and lust, as he couldn’t help but look in a fervent awe at the same beast who was crushing him, not only with his massive form, but also with his two gigantic cocks which pushed and throbbed against his naked furred body.<br />
<br />
“Do not worry cub, you will not die. But I must do this. Something was taken from me and it has left a deep void within me. I have only just realized how to sate it... temporarily...”<br />
<br />
The deer tried to mumble something out, but couldn’t as Issac’s hand still completely covered his muzzle. Issac couldn’t tell if the mumble was filled with fear or lust, but it didn’t matter anyways. The hybrid must be consumed. A small part of Issac’s mind tried to stop, and release the cultist, but the combined assault of the room’s musk, his own inner lust, and the glowing gem of the Choker of Purity stamped out any resistance.<br />
<br />
The deer’s eyes widened further, his twin cocks practically shooting out cum, as he watched as Issac’s chest began to almost open up, allowing the cultist to see a inner layer of flesh, vines, ice, flame, and stone, all connected and conjoined in a corrupted unity. <br />
<br />
  In the center of the mass was a crystal. White and pure. It was trapped. A visible outer layer of corruptive energy was constantly trying to pierce the crystal’s shields, to gain entry but it couldn’t. Something was protecting it, a barrier, but would it last? The cultist had no more time to think, as his body was completely swallowed by Issac’s body, his essence and flesh becoming integrated with the rest of Issac’s form.<br />
<br />
The Choker of Purity nearly instantly glowed as another ball gag tendril formed and inserted itself in Issacs mouth, just before he was about to let loose a loud pleasured roar. Instead the roar was greatly muffled but still as passionate as ever as a new set of ebony deer antlers crowned his head alongside his other pair of horns, and his two cocks lengthened, although only slightly with the increased mass. They shot out the last of the deer’s cum before becoming replaced with Issac’s own essence which coated the wall and space where the cultist once stood.<br />
<br />
   When the surge of pleasure finally faded and Issac’s mind returned to a less extreme state of lust after his consumption of the cultist. His ball gag disappeared, freeing his mouth and allowing him to give  a small chuckle as he inspected his new antlers. They looked nice and fit well on top his head.<br />
<br />
Now with no companion to give him company, Issac sat down on the stone floor, gently stroking his cocks as he waited for Lubricus’ arrival</p>
