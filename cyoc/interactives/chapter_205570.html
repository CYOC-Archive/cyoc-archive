<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Every time Matt tried to focus on his old life and who had been before suddenly getting thrown back in time and into a completely different body, Suto-senpai’s face kept on drifting into the front of his mind. Or if not his face, his tight and muscled chest. Or his smooth and perfectly tanned legs that-<br />
<br />
“Damn it, what’s wrong with me…?” Matt sighed as he reached into his duffel bag and pulled out his gymnastics uniform. Before he even realized what he was doing, his clothes were carefully folded up and placed on the locker room bench and the smooth material of his uniform was sliding up his youthfully smooth legs. Matt bit his lip at how thin his legs and arms were, at how <i>different</i> the image in the mirror on the wall was from what he was used to seeing, even if that appearance was getting harder and harder to remember. Deep brown, almond-shaped eyes and lightly tanned skin, almost the color of straw. A tiny, slightly flattened nose and a cute little mouth with thin but perky lips. No doubt about it, Kohei was a cute kid.<br />
<br />
“...What do I have to do to get senpai to think I’m cute, though…” Matt/<i><b>Kohei</b></i> sighed as he finished pulling on his gymnastics uniform, silently pushing Matt into the back of his head. Just like it had been when he had walked from the airport to school, it was like Kohei’s body was on autopilot, doing the things he had done every day for years, with Matt only barely realizing that it wasn’t him in control anymore. Matt knew it was terrifying how comfortably he was slipping into the life of a Japanese middle-schooler, but the thought of disappointing senpai was just as scary a thought to Kohei. After all, if senpai was disappointed with him, how could he ever think about confessing to him that Kohei liked h-<br />
<br />
“S-stop it, Kohei!” Matt finally shouted out loud, banishing his other self away for a few precious moments. He couldn’t let himself get wrapped up in some hormonal teenage fantasies or he just might risk losing himself at the worse possible time. No, he had to stay focused on finding his way back to… to…<br />
<br />
“Shit, where was I from again? I mean, Kohei was flying in from London, but is that where <i>I’m</i> from? I think I was white, not Japanese, so maybe I was from America? Or maybe Australia?” Matt muttered, his heart racing as he realized just how quickly he was losing track of the person he had been. And, even more frighteningly, how easy if was for Kohei’s life and personality to slip into the spaces that were left over. He couldn’t even remember the name of the country he was from, or what year he was really born in, but stupid little things like Kohei’s favorite food (<i>karaage</i> fried chicken, of course) or the specific details of half a dozen anime that Kohei loved to watch came back to him in a flash.<br />
<br />
He had to get out of here. Fast. Or <i>he</i> wouldn’t get out at all, at least not as Matt.<br />
<br />
“Uchimura-kun, what is taking so long?” A stern voice came from nearby, and Matt<i><b>Kohei</b></i> froze in place as Matt’s legitimate concerns were once more pushed away in favor of Kohei’s immature ones. Senpai was coming… He’d spent too much time daydreaming and was wasting valuable training time. Not to mention time he could spend ogling his handsome upperclassman…<br />
<br />
“N-nothing, senpai!” Kohei snapped back immediately, rushing toward the exit of the locker room and running face-first into Suto’s chest.<br />
<br />
“You’re acting strangely, Uchimura,” Suto said with a combination of sternness and concern that made Kohei’s heart begin to race. “You aren’t jet-lagged, are you?”<br />
<br />
“I’m fine, senpai, really! I’ll be extra careful during practice, I promise!” Kohei said earnestly, and he could swear he saw a proud glimmer in his senpai’s otherwise cold eyes for a mere moment. He started to walk back toward the gymnasium, but as he passed by Suto the upperclassman grabbed Kohei by the hand to stop him.<br />
<br />
“...Uchimura-kun, I actually a little surprised. Did you actually forget?” Suto said quietly, a blush starting to form across his tanned cheeks. “I mean, what you asked me for if you placed well at the tournament in London?”<br />
<br />
“W-what I asked f-” Kohei started to ask with confusion, but before he could finish he saw Suto-senpai lean down to gently plant a kiss on his cheek. He didn’t know which felt warmer, his senpai’s lips or his own burning cheeks, but Kohei’s heart soon felt like it was about to beat right out his chest. Not only that, he once again felt the stir of his dick as it pressed hard against the inside of his athletic shorts. The kiss only lasted for a split-second, but to Kohei is felt like a lifetime. And for Matt, who was desperately shouting his silent protests in the back of Kohei’s head, it was an agonizing and humiliating experience to be getting helplessly turned on by the kiss of a teenage stranger.<br />
<br />
“W-well, that takes care of that,” Suto stammered, trying desperately to act like nothing out of the ordinary had happened. “I’m sure you understand, but I only did that to help motivate you to do your best. ...That being said, I’d appreciate it if you kept that between you and I, and not tell the coach.”<br />
<br />
Suto’s face once again became cold and expressionless as he casually walked past Kohei and back toward the gymnasium. “Oh, and Uchimura-kun? Make sure you stretch out a bit before practice. You were on that plane for a long time and you look a little… umm… ‘stiff’.”<br />
<br />
Kohei pondered Suto’s advice before looking down and seeing his youthful erection tenting his gymnastics shorts, and his hands darted down to cover himself, thankful that the rest of the team hadn’t arrived yet. The part of him that was Matt was desperately trying to flee as far away from this place as possible, but Kohei wasn’t about to let go of his control, so Matt felt the autopilot once again take over and nervously start walking out of the locker room and toward the gymnasium...</p>
