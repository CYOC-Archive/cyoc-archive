<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days later, Arthur arrives at the residence of the Powers family to start his two week job of babysitting Mike and Justin. After receiving the keys and discussing some details, like food and when the boys have to be in bed, the parents leave, leaving Arthur alone with the two boys.<br />
<br />
After the parents have left, Arthur turns to the boys, “so, what would you guys like to do,” he asks, “since it is Friday, you don’t have to get to bed early. Would you like to watch a movie and have some Pizza?”<br />
<br />
The boys think for a while, “nah,” they say, “we’d like to rather get to know you more. We wanna know everything about you, your hobbies, what you want to become,” Justin adds.<br />
<br />
“Hm, well, my life isn’t THAT exciting,” Arthur says, “but, I’ll be happy to tell you more about myself”.<br />
<br />
“Nice,” the boys say, smiling, “let’s head to our room,” Mike then says, “we can sit on our bean bags. They are super comfy”.<br />
<br />
Arthur follows the boys upstairs to their room, once there, the boys lead Arthur to there “chillout corner”, which has a small coffee table and four beanbags set up, “wow, it does look super comfy,” Arthur says.<br />
<br />
The boys smile, “it sure does,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
“Please, take a seat,” Mike says, gesturing to the beanbags. As the teen walks over to a beanbag, Justin leans into his brother.<br />
<br />
“You hypnotize him,” Justin whispers, “I’ll do the questioning,” Mike nods, then bot boys sit down, Mike sits opposite of Arthur, to make sure that his eyes will be able to lock with Arthur’s, while Justin takes the bag beside his brother.<br />
<br />
Arthur looks at the two boy, he starts to get nervous, ‘something about them makes me feel really nervous,’ the teen thinks to himself.<br />
<br />
The boys notice Arthur starting to become nervous, Mike activates his hypnosis, his blue eyes slightly glowing, before he says, “Arthur,” he says, and smiles when Arthur turns to face him, the 13 year-old starts to feel himself connect with Arthur’s gaze, “there is no need to be nervous, just relax,” the boy continues in a calm voice.<br />
<br />
Arthur doesn’t blink, ‘I haven’t noticed how beautiful his eyes are,’ he thinks to himself, ‘I… I can’t look away’. The teen slowly starts to become noticeable relaxed with every passing second.<br />
<br />
The two boys smile when they notice the 16 year-old relax, “that’s it, Arti,” Mike says, “just focus on our voices. We’ll help you to calm down”. The boys smiles grow as they watch Arthur slipping further and further into relaxation, the teen even starts to smile a little, his whole body is slumped back in the bean bag in a relaxing pose and his expression is just totally relaxed.<br />
<br />
“Now,” Justin says, “tell us, why are you so upset with being a teenager? Why do you see yourself as a child?”<br />
<br />
“I have no friends, I get bullied all the time and this body and… my age… just feels wrong,” Arthur says in a calm, almost dreamy, sounding voice, “it… it’s like I have the soul of a ten year-old. It makes me act and think like a kid, but… because of my already deep voice, height, body hair, I am unable to… act like a kid. So, whenever I am alone, I… I let the kid out, but only if I am by myself, I… I don’t want the bullying to worsen”.<br />
<br />
The boys tilt their heads, “that surely can’t be all,” Mike says, “tell us everything!”<br />
<br />
“I don’t want to be stuck in this body,” Arthur says, “I… I want to be myself!”<br />
<br />
Justin leans into Mike and whispers into his ear, “I believe we were right,” he says, “he is possessed by a ten year-old!”<br />
<br />
Mike nods slightly, keeping his eyes locked with Arthur’s, “don’t worry, Arti,” he then says, “we’ll help you, but first, tell us: do you want to be our friend? We defiantly want to be your friends!”<br />
<br />
“That… that would be nice,” Arthur says, smiling, “finally, I’ll have friends!”<br />
<br />
Justin and Mike smile, “okay, Arti, close your eyes and don’t open them until we tell you so,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
Arthur nods, he then closes his eyes, Mike groans and rubs his eyes, “man, I dunno if I could have managed a second longer,” he says.<br />
<br />
“You did great, bro,” Justin says, “now, how should we do this?”<br />
<br />
“How about we alter his voice? Making it sound like a 10 year-old’s,” Mike suggests.<br />
<br />
“Good idea,” Justin says, “but what about his mind and body?”<br />
<br />
“We should leave his body as it is, at least for now,” Mike says, “I don’t want anyone become suspicious. But, we should alter his mind, like, making him accept that he is ten, make him forget that he is actually 16”.<br />
<br />
“Hm… okay, but his body hair has to go,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
“I agree,” Mike replies, “a ten year-old does not have a beard, hairy arms and hairy legs, I bet he even has pubic and butt hairs! We should get rid of all of those unnecessary hairs!”<br />
<br />
“Let’s get to work,” Justin says, “first, let’s put a spell on him that will change his voice and take care of those hairs!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, you do the voice and hair, and I’ll take care of his mind,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
“Agreed,” Justin replies, “he’ll be so happy and thankful once we are done. But you should make sure he doesn&#39;t know that we have messed with him, make him think that his voice has always been high and that he always had a hairless body”.<br />
<br />
“No worries,” Mike says, “I have a plan what to plant in his mind!”<br />
<br />
Justin starts to chant, he aims the palm of his right hand straight at Arthur, his hand starts to glow red, and immediately the teen’s body also starts to glow in the same red tone. After only a few minutes, Justin’s hand and Arthur’s body stop glowing, “there, done,” the boy says, sounding pleased with himself.<br />
<br />
Mike smiles, “my turn,” he says, he turns to Arthur and says, “Arti, open your eyes and look at me,” he then orders as he reactivates his hypnotic powers. The boy’s eyes again start to glow and when Arthur meets the boy’s gaze, so does his eyes. Mike smiles, “listen closely,” he says, “you are not 16 years-old, in reality you are only ten. Everyone suspected you being older, because your body is simply taller than the average 10 year-old. You don’t need to act like a teenager anymore, just be yourself, act the way a 10 year-old should act!”<br />
<br />
“I’m… ten…,” Arthur mumbles, his voice sounding just like a average ten year-old, “a-always have been… imma act acc-accordingly!”<br />
<br />
The two 13 year olds smile, “good boy, Arti,” Mike says, “now, when I awake you, you won’t remember what has happened for the last hour. You are still our babysitter, but, we know you have simply used your teenager appearance to fool our parents. We aren’t mad, we understand: a ten year-old like you will do anything for a little bit of extra pocket money, right?”<br />
<br />
Arthur nods, “uh-hu,” he says.<br />
<br />
“But, because we are the older ones,” Mike says, “WE are in charge, and YOU will have to listen to us and do anything we say! You want to be a good boy, right? You don’t want to make us mad!”<br />
<br />
Arthur shakes his head, “nuh-uh,” he says, “d-don’t wanna… make you angry! Imma be a g-good boy!”<br />
<br />
The two 13 year-olds smile, “good,” Mike says, “now, awake!”<br />
<br />
Arthur blinks a couple of times and looks around, seeming to be a little confused, he then looks at Mike and Justin, “um… s-sorry,” he says, sounding nervous, “I… I guess I k-kinda dozed off!”<br />
<br />
Mike and Justin chuckle, “no need to be nervous, Arti,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Mike adds, “we aren’t mad at you. Would you like to do anything? Maybe watch a movie? We wanted to order a Pizza too, we know where our parents put the money to buy food!”<br />
<br />
“S-sounds good,” Arthur says, “I’m feeling pretty hungry”.<br />
<br />
Mike and Justin grin, “why are you acting so nervous, Arti,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
“Are you afraid of us,” Justin adds.<br />
<br />
Arthur gulps, “I… I can’t help it,” he says, “I… I’m only 10 and… and you both are 13”.<br />
<br />
The boys shrug, “so? You are much taller and therefor stronger than us,” Mike says.<br />
<br />
Justin nods, “yeah, so even if we wanted to,” he says, “we could never harm you in anyway”.<br />
<br />
“I know,” Arthur says, “b-but still, it… I feel as though I have to listen to you, instead of you listening to me! I… I dunno if I can manage being a… b-babysitter, I… I know I’ll fail and y-your parents w-won’t be happy with me,” tears start to form in Arthur’s eyes.<br />
<br />
Mike and Justin notice how fearful Arthur seems to be, Mike gets up from his beanbag and walks over to Arthur, “hey,” he says, kneeling in front of the teen, who now, thanks to the boys spells, thinks he is a tall 10 year-old, “we promise, that won’t happen”.<br />
<br />
“Hu? Wh-what do you mean,” Arthur asks.<br />
<br />
“We mean, YOU do as we say,” Justin says, “and WE’LL promise to tell our parents what a great babysitter you have been”.<br />
<br />
“Re-really,” Arthur asks.<br />
<br />
Mike nods, “of course,” he says, “you are such a kind boy, plus you are also pretty cute”.<br />
<br />
Arthur blushes, “c-cute? Me,” he asks, he then shakes his head, “n-no… I’m not cute. Maybe… maybe if I were not so tall, then maybe I’d be cute”.<br />
<br />
Mike looks sternly at Arthur, “listen, you are, what ever WE say you are!”<br />
<br />
Justin nods, “yeah, so, if we say you are cute, then your ARE cute!”<br />
<br />
Arthur gulps, “s-sorry,” he says quietly, “pl-please don’t be mad! I… I promise to be g-good!”<br />
<br />
Mike and Justin smile, “we know you will be,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
Mike then gets an idea, “hey, you wanna do something fun?”<br />
<br />
Arthur tilts his head, “l-like what?”<br />
<br />
Mike turns to Justin and both grin, “tell us: do you like running around nude?”<br />
<br />
Arthur turns a deep red, “wh-why are you asking?”<br />
<br />
The boys grin, “because WE just LOVE running around naked,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
“So, why don’t we all get naked,” Mike asks, “it’s so warm, and these clothes are starting to feel really uncomfortable!”<br />
<br />
“I… I dunno,” Arthur says, “wh-what if someone sees us? Th-They’ll think I… I’m some kind of… um…,” he trails off.<br />
<br />
Mike and Justin know what Arthur is trying to say, “don’t worry,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, no one will see us,” Mike adds, “come on, it’ll be fun!”<br />
<br />
“Besides,” Justin adds, “we are kinda curious if you are bigger than us down there too!”<br />
<br />
Arthur blushes even more, “um…,” he says.<br />
<br />
“Arti,” Justin says, “come on, there is nothing wrong with three boys being naked!”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Mike says, “we are all the same, except of our heights!”<br />
<br />
“Um… o-okay… b-but only if you t-take off your cl-clothes first,” Arthur says.<br />
<br />
“Okay,” both boys say, they then waste no time and take off their clothes, soon both are standing naked in front of Arthur, their tiny cocks standing at attention.<br />
<br />
“Your turn,” the boys say, grinning.<br />
<br />
“Um… wh-why are your cocks… big,” Arthur asks.<br />
<br />
“Because, it just feels so good being naked,” the boys say.<br />
<br />
“B-but what if mine gets b-big,” Arthur asks.<br />
<br />
The boys grin, “we won’t mind,” they say, “you promised to do as we say, right?”<br />
<br />
Arthur gulps and nods, “y-yeah… I g-guess I did”.<br />
<br />
“Well, then: strip!”<br />
<br />
Not wanting to make the two boys mad, Arthur lets out a sigh, he then gets up from the beanbag and starts to take his clothes off. The teen soon is standing nude in front of the much smaller boys, their eyes widening when they see Arthur’s erect 6 inch cock.<br />
<br />
“WHOA,” the boys say, “you sure are big!”<br />
<br />
Arthur rubs the back of his head, blushing hard, “I… I guess”.<br />
<br />
“You should be proud,” Mike says, “our cocks are only four inches erect!”<br />
<br />
“Th-they… they kinda look b-bigger than that,” Arthur says.<br />
<br />
The boys grin, pushing their hips out, “oh? Do you like the size,” Mike asks.<br />
<br />
Arthur is taken aback, and his eyes widen at the question, “I… um… I d-don’t… I… I mean,” he splutters.<br />
<br />
The boys grin grows, “hehe… are you gay,” Justin asks, “do you want to play with our cocks?”<br />
<br />
“Do you want to suck ‘em,” Mike asks, “maybe even feel them in your bummy?”<br />
<br />
Arthur shakes his head violently, “n-no! Of course… of course not,” he says.<br />
<br />
The two 13 year olds grins turn into smirks, both looking up an down Arthur’s body, “no? Then, do you have a girlfriend?”<br />
<br />
“N-no,” Arthur says, “I… I’m to young! G-girls… girls are also s-super annoying!”<br />
<br />
The boys continue to smirk, “hehe… well, WE have girlfriends,” Justin says.<br />
<br />
“G-good for you,” Arthur says.<br />
<br />
Mike turns to his brother, “maybe he does not even know yet if he prefers boys or girls… or both!”<br />
<br />
Justin nods, “maybe we should “help” him figure it out,” he asks, both boys smirks grow.<br />
<br />
“Wh-what do y-you mean,” Arthur asks, now starting to feel scared.<br />
<br />
The two boys don’t say a word, they just continue to grin as they start to walk slowly towards Arthur.</p>
