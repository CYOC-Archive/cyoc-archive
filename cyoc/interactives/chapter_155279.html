Perfectly Fitting Clothes, Part 3<br />
By extramorphs<br />
<br />
***<br />
That night, Amanda needed to head home early because we had class in the morning.  <br />
I offered to let her use the spray to return her arms to how they were, but she declined - she said nobody would notice the slight change anyway.  Nobody but her, anyway.  I walked her to the door but stayed inside - I didn’t want to walk out to her car, as I wasn’t ready to take my four breasts into public yet.  <br />
“You going to stay like that?” she asked me, motioning towards my chest.  <br />
“No, no, I have to change it back.  Maybe I’ll keep a little instead of going back to being a total surfboard, though.”<br />
There was a little bit of a pause while Amanda thought about something.<br />
“So...” she began, “... doing anything after class tomorrow?”<br />
I involuntarily bit my lip thinking about using the spray.  “Well, I did have something in mind...”<br />
“My place then?”<br />
It would be nice to hang out at Amanda’s for a change.  “Sure,” I said, “sounds great!”<br />
“Ok, it’s a plan!  See ya tomorrow!” She smiled and then turned and walked to her car, with a spring in her step and extra sway in her arms.<br />
***<br />
I went to my room and readied myself for bed.  I stripped down and hopped under the covers, getting comfortable.  I had never slept with such big (or so many) boobs before, and they quickly became a nuisance.  I laid on my back, and they pressed on my chest.  I tried to lay on my stomach, but they got in my way.  After a few minutes of tossing and turning,  I decided I needed to take care of making my breasts normal instead of in the morning like I had planned.  It would save some time getting ready for school, anyway.<br />
I got up and headed to my dresser to find some “normal” clothes.  I pulled out one of my usual padded A-cups, and for fun, one of my slightly bigger B-cup bras.  It was always too big for me, and I had bought it expecting a growth spurt... and now that I could make myself have one, it was time to put it to use.<br />
Putting the B-cup bra on over my grapefruit-sized upper breasts was proving to be a challenge.  I put my arms through the shoulder straps but could not get the back to clasp, no matter how much I adjusted it or pulled and stretched.  I decided to just hold the clasp instead.  With my left hand contorted behind my back and my right hand holding the bottle, I sprayed the cold misty spray over my upper breasts and waited.  <br />
And waited.  My stomach dropped as I considered that maybe the spray only works on clothing that is actually worn and not simply held in place.  Would I have to some how find “intermediate”-sized bras and bring myself back to normal in steps?  <br />
I got my answer as the shrinking began. There wasn’t any deep burning or itching as my breasts shrank - it felt much more like when you exhale after holding your breath for a very long time.  A deep sigh.  It wouldn’t say it was pleasurable so much as it was relaxing.  I felt like I was getting a massage but without any of the pressure or pain.  <br />
It was quite nice, which was why I was a little disappointed when it was over.  I opened my eyes, removed the bra, and looked at my reflection.  I now had two B-cup breasts - big enough to have a little weight and jiggle as I shook my chest, and a slight curve at the bottom, but not big enough to really protrude.  They were bigger than I had naturally, but still not quite as large as I would like - even still, they were quite a thrill.  Small enough that nobody would find my change odd but big enough that I could feel them.  <br />
And below those, I had my C-cup breasts, more comparable to apples, sticking out further than my upper breasts.  It was quite a bizarre sight.  I put the padded A-cup bra on my lower set of breasts - this time, I managed to clasp it behind my back, though the elastic was definitely reaching its limit.  I sprayed the spray on my lower breasts, careful not to overspray onto my upper set.  <br />
The spray kicked in much more quickly.  I haven’t quite figured out what determines how long it takes, but I was just happy each time it worked.  It’s still a mystery to me how it works or what rules govern it.<br />
With less flesh to reduce, the feeling was somewhat muted from before, though still apparent.    My lower set of breasts quickly disappeared back into my body, becoming flat below the bra.  I turned and looked at myself in the mirror, appreciating my new form.  I looked good - I wasn’t entering pinup territory or anything like that, but... I looked good.  <br />
I removed the now oddly-placed lower bra and dropped it into my laundry basket when I noticed something concerning - I still had my lower nipples.  I guess the spray recognized that what I had on was still a bra, and while there was almost no breast flesh, there were still nipples.  They were not very big - I estimated that the areola were maybe an inch and a quarter across, with the nipples themselves about a quarter inch wide, with the skin only a hint darker than the surrounding area.<br />
I began to think quickly: how could I get rid of these nipples?  They would look strange under a tight t-shirt, so maybe if I put on a form-fitting shirt, the spray would know to get rid of them?  It was worth a shot.<br />
I grabbed a very light and thin white shirt out of my hamper and put it on.  It nicely hugged my upper (and now only) set of breasts, though it definitely showed my extra set of nipples.  They were sensitive and stiffening against the fabric.<br />
A few quick sprays later, my damp white shirt looked like I was in a very tame wet t-shirt contest.  The dark spots below my breasts where my new nipples were was very apparent.<br />
Again, I waited.  Nothing was happening - was it possible that the spray thought that this T-shirt fit me fine and that I didn’t need any changes?  Perhaps the nipples weren’t a big enough change and so it wouldn’t do anything to them?<br />
My worries were quickly dispersed when I looked in the mirror and saw the spots below my breasts begin to shrink and disappear.  I could barely feel them going away, and before I knew it, my second set of nipples were totally gone.  A wave of relief washed over me - finally, I was “normal” again for the first time since this afternoon.  <br />
My white shirt still felt quite wet, though when I looked in the mirror, it looked dry - at least, it wasn’t see-through enough to show my nipples anymore, anyway.  I touched the shirt with my hands to feel if it was still wet, and it definitely was - I grabbed my nipples, and to my surprise, found that they were absent.  <br />
I pulled the shirt off and stared at my breasts - not only had the spray removed my lower set of nipples, it also removed my primary set!  My breasts were still the same size - gently protruding, slightly curving B-cups - but totally lacking nipples.  <br />
Exhausted and frustrated at the unpredictable spray, I decided I could live with this change for now.  At least nobody would notice at school tomorrow.  Hell, I could probably even go without a bra.  That might be fun.<br />
***<br />
I woke up and went to my classes.  I still had not removed my penis yet, and I liked the thrill of hiding it under my clothes.  I wore purposefully baggy pants to school, just in case.  It was not very visible at all when not erect, but I knew that if it became stiff, it would be much harder to hide in tighter pants.  <br />
My classes dragged on much longer than usual.  I would start to daydream about what changes I would make to my body next, but always had to interrupt the thought lest I risk swelling in my pants.  I considered visiting the ladies’ room to use the spray to get rid of my penis by tucking it into my panties, though I didn’t want to risk some kind of malfunction or other unexpected result like last night.  I could get by hiding my penis for now; I would have more trouble hiding any other changes the spray might make.  What if I sprayed it with my pants off and the spray decided I didn’t need any legs?  I would have a lot of explaining to do.  <br />
***<br />
Finally finished with my last class, I quickly hurried over to Amanda’s place.  I knocked on the door and heard a muffled “Come in!” from inside, and let myself in.<br />
Amanda was laying on the couch on her computer.  She looked me up and down and said, “Back to normal, eh?”<br />
“Not exactly,” I replied as I set my book bag down and closed the door.<br />
Amanda was puzzled.  “What do you mean?”<br />
I pulled off my shirt to show her my nipple-less breasts.  <br />
She started to giggle.  “Oops, right?”<br />
I began to laugh a little too.  It was a little scary to have a piece of me missing, but overall, it was a pretty funny sight.  <br />
“First things first,” I said, “I’d like to have these back.”<br />
“Any ideas on how to try?” she asked.<br />
I thought for a moment, and then replied, “Yeah... this might seem like an odd question, but do you have any chocolate syrup?”<br />
Amanda was a little perplexed, but played along.  A moment later we were sitting on her bed with the spray and the syrup, me without my top.  <br />
I removed the top from the chocolate syrup bottle and looked inside.  “I always thought it would be fun to have nipples that fit one of these.  Pointy but not too big, you know?”<br />
Amanda nodded, and with a grin, said, “Well, what are you waiting for?”<br />
I held the chocolate syrup cap against my left breast, moving it around to where I felt like my nipple should be.  It was cold but I was willing to deal with it if it meant getting my nipples back.  I found the perfect spot and with the cap in my left hand, sprayed with my right hand.<br />
I felt the familiar deep pressure and static of growing an organ in my breast, though it was odd to only have it on the one side.  I felt like many hands were tugging at my soon-to-be nipple.  I had the feeling of having my nipple harden, but it was a thousand times the normal feeling.  I felt my pants tighten, though it seemed Amanda was transfixed on watching the bottle cap for any signs of change, so she didn’t notice anything.  Phew.  <br />
After a moment, the feeling subsided and I removed the cap from my new nipple.  It had a bit of chocolate on it from inside the bottle, but otherwise looked perfectly normal.  It was a little puffy on the edges, and very stiff in the middle - I flicked it a little bit and decided that I was quite happy with the new shape.  It might be noticeable if I didn’t wear a bra, but it was nice to finally have that option again.<br />
“I’ll get you a wet cloth so we can clean up the chocolate,” Amanda said.  <br />
I began to move the cap around on my right breast as Amanda returned and wiped down my left breast of any chocolate that was still on my new nipple.  Having found the correct spot on my right breast, I sprayed, and enjoyed the same effects that had been on my left breast now on my right breast.  As the nipple finished growing, I let out a big sigh and pulled the cap away.  Amanda used the wash cloth on my right nipple to clean up the chocolate syrup so that I could get a nice view of my new nipples.<br />
“You could have done a better job wiping me down,” I said as I noticed that there was still syrup on the tip of my left nipple.<br />
Amanda seemed surprised.  “I... I did!  It was totally clean a moment ago!”<br />
“That’s weird,” I replied.  I squeezed my left nipple and noticed a little more chocolate bead on the surface.  “How is there any still left on there?”<br />
“Oh. My. God.” Amanda’s jaw dropped.  <br />
“What?”<br />
I was startled when she leaned forward and put her lips over my left nipple - I had never really had my breasts sucked on, and especially not by a girl.  Her mouth tugged at my nipple - it felt good but I didn’t know what she was doing.  A few seconds later, she released and brought her head up to my eye level, opened her mouth, and stuck out her tongue.<br />
It was covered in chocolate syrup.  <br />
“I... I...“ I didn’t know what to say.<br />
“This is kind of amazing,” Amanda said. “Your boobs make chocolate syrup.”<br />
She was right.  It was pretty amazing.  I thought about it for a moment and whether or not I wanted to try my luck at changing them again.  The idea of being able to make chocolate syrup at will was growing on me.  <br />
“I guess I can keep them,” I said.  “As long as they don’t do it on their own.”<br />
“What a great party trick this will be!” Amanda exclaimed gleefully.  <br />
“Hey, I’m not your party toy, do it to your own nipples!”  <br />
“Maybe I will,” she said.  “Maybe I will.”<br />
