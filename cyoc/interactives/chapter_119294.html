<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary looked down upon the vials, excited to try them out, and grabbed the Hair + vial.<br />
<br />
Her dark brown hair had always been short, barely touching her shoulders, and it suited her well enough, but she had never been satisfied with it. She read magazines and watched shows, and it seemed as if every beautiful woman had long, flowing, silky hair. She almost felt inadequate in comparison.<br />
<br />
And so, Mary picked up the Hair + vial and swallowed its contents in one gulp. She had briefly considered swallowing only half, but figured that she could just cut off any excess hair. She put the vial back in the box and watched with amazement as it refilled itself, seemingly out of nowhere. Then she picked up the whole box and carried it with her into the bathroom so she could look at herself in the mirror. Shortly after, Mary felt her scalp begin to itch mildly, and watched as the changes began.<br />
<br />
She stared in awe as her dark brown, barely shoulder-length hair began growing. It first touched her shoulders completely, and hid her once exposed ears underneath. Her hair parted down the middle, so luckily it stayed mostly out of her face. As she twisted back and forth to look at her hair, it swung around and hit her in the face, but she was too excited to be annoyed by such a mild inconvenience. Her hair continued down both sides of her torso. Mary saw it cover the upper part of her chest, almost touching her boobs, and watched it drape down her upper back like a curtain. <br />
<br />
Mary admitted to herself that she may need to cut some of her new luscious locks for convenience&#39;s sake if the growth continued, but that didn&#39;t quell her overflowing happiness. She smiled and did a twirl, watching in the mirror as her hair danced and spun around her. She felt more beautiful than ever before.<br />
<br />
That blissful moment was interrupted when Mary realized something wasn&#39;t right. The itchiness from her scalp hadn&#39;t disappeared, it had spread down and around her body. In her moment of euphoria, she had failed to realize the vial she took would apply to ALL her hair, not just her scalp.<br />
<br />
Upon realizing the implications, Mary froze up in horror. She looked at her face and noticed what she hadn&#39;t before. Her eyebrows had thickened significantly, making her look rough, angry, and unkempt. She had also grown a faint mustache and some curly hairs on her chin, and her sideburns reached down a little farther than they used to and covered most of her ears.<br />
<br />
The itching continued. It felt as if ants were crawling all over her skin. She could feel her body hair beginning to grow, all at once, and the sensations were overwhelming. It was all just too much for her to take in, and she panicked. Mary tore off all her clothes in desperation, hoping to soothe the itching and end the nightmare. She didn&#39;t get what she wanted, but she did give herself a clear view of her whole body. She held out an arm, staring as little brown hairs began appearing. Scratching her stomach uncontrollably, she felt a lot of fine little hairs all surrounding and pointing toward her belly button. Twisting around again, Mary looked at her back in the mirror and saw her shoulders, lower back, and even her ass had also grown a dusting of fine hairs. She began to cry, fearing she would be stuck looking like a freak and that her life was over. She spent a few minutes hunched over on the floor, bawling. When she finally stopped, she felt a little better, although no less anxious. Taking a deep breath, she stood up and reluctantly resumed tracking the progress of her changes.<br />
<br />
Continuing to scratch all over her body, Mary looked down at her legs. She watched as years of waxing were put to waste by the appearance of lots of little brown hairs. The hairs there were a little longer than other places, but not by much. At least, that&#39;s what Mary told herself. Still mostly in denial, she moved up to her vagina. The hairs there were noticeably much longer and far more dense than most other areas, and it was totally undeniable. She became unsettled by the discovery, as if something about seeing those longer, denser hairs made everything more real, and hinted at what was to come. Feeling herself beginning to panic again, Mary took a few deep breaths.<br />
<br />
Moving across her stomach, which had gotten slightly hairier since she last checked, and up to her chest, she saw a patch of hair growing in the middle and expanding outward in all directions. Even on her boobs, there was a layer of brown hair growing all around. She noticed the hairs were a little thicker and longer around her nipples and in between her boobs, but she tried to ignore it. Not wanting to look there any longer, she quickly returned to her arms. Holding them out again revealed a longer layer of brown hairs than had been there before. The hair on her forearms was a little longer than the hair on her upper arms and shoulders, although Mary had no idea what to make of that. Lifting up her arms revealed thick, dense patches of hair in her armpits, reminding her too much of her vagina and causing her to quickly lower her arms again. <br />
<br />
Having completed a rough examination of her body, Mary closed her eyes and paused for a moment. Taking another deep breath, she tried to stop herself from panicking any more by rationalizing the situation. Trying to convince herself it wasn&#39;t so bad, she remembered that she was alone in her house and had no plans with anyone for the next few days. She also remembered the Hair - vial, which was sitting right next to the Hair + vial in the box.<br />
<br />
She put her mind at relative ease knowing both that there was an easy and immediate fix to her predicament, and that no one would be able to discover her in her current state. Mary snatched up the Hair - vial and opened her mouth to drink it, but stopped herself when an idea popped into her mind. She was still very uncomfortable, but was able to take solace in knowing the situation wasn&#39;t actually out of her control. After turning over her outrageous idea for a few minutes, she convinced herself and decided to change her mindset. No longer was this a problem to be fixed, but instead a unique opportunity to explore the limits of her body. <br />
<br />
About 10 minutes had passed since she finished the first rough examination of her body. She had been too preoccupied with preventing panic attacks and mulling over crazy ideas to take notice of her body. Figuring the changes must have progressed pretty far by now, she decided to take another look. This time, however, she&#39;d be more organized, going from top to bottom and treating herself like a science experiment.<br />
<br />
Mary started with the hair on her head. The last time she paid attention to it, it had reached over her breasts and across the middle of her back. Now, it was already hanging down to her waist on both sides. Mary joked with herself that it couldn&#39;t even be called hair anymore. If it progressed much further, she&#39;d be more accurate in calling it a mane.<br />
<br />
Trying to lift up the locks of hair, Mary realized they were heavy. She also noticed her neck was starting to ache. Running her hand along the back of her head, Mary felt that the base of her hair seemed to be creeping down her neck. She secretly hoped her joke from before wasn&#39;t actually a prophecy.<br />
<br />
Moving on and returning once again to her face, Mary was upset to find that her eyebrows had run wild, growing into a full unibrow. Her mustache and chin hair had filled in, giving her a goatee, and her bushy sideburns covered most of her jawline in a dense coating of coarse facial hair. Mary noticed that her forehead also looked different. Her hairline had become messy, and seemed to be traveling down her forehead. The outer edges of it had already begun mingling with the outer tips of her bushy unibrow.<br />
<br />
Unable to bear her monstrous appearance any longer, Mary turned her attention back toward her body. It was difficult, with heavy locks of hair beginning to impede both her vision and movement, but she found a way. Checking her chest first, she found the mat of hair had expanded outward in all directions, growing like mold on a wall. The top part was mingling with her neck, and the sides had nearly reached her shoulders and armpits. The bottom area was the worst, having covered the whole top half of her breasts and making them look quite hairy. Her nipples were now partly hidden by the longer hairs that grew around them. The whole front of the upper half of her torso was covered in a thick mat of dense, curly brown hair. There was so much hair, that from a distance it made her skin look a shade or two darker than it was. She would soon find that observation applied not only to her chest.<br />
<br />
The next logical place for her to check was her arms, since they were the closest. Her shoulders and upper arms had long brown hair covering them. Raising her arms, she saw the new bushels underneath reach out like a pop-up book. Her forearms were strange, because the hair had continued growing faster and longer than anywhere else on her arms. With her arms still raised, the hair was beginning to hang down off her arms like curtains. She had forgotten her hands last time, but now she noted that they were also growing hair. From the back, she looked like she had furry brown gloves on, but in the front, the palms of her hands remained hairless. Mary figured it was because no hair grew there originally, so there was none for the vial to augment.<br />
<br />
Turning her attention down to her stomach yet again, Mary was greeted by an expansive field of hair which circled around her belly button. It wasn&#39;t very long, but it was more dense, and her skin was becoming hard to find underneath the thick mat. It was also so large that it encroached into her private area and nearly merged with the chest hair covering her breasts. For now, however, there was still a small trail of hair between the two areas. Scratching her rough stomach reminded her of petting a dog, which she was not happy about. <br />
<br />
Not letting herself get sidetracked, she followed the mat of hair down to her vagina. Mary&#39;s fears were confirmed as she found that the hair down there had developed just as rapidly as her armpits and unibrow, if not worse. A wild forest of pubic hair had exploded all around her vagina, burying it completely. The curly overgrowth covered the whole front of her waist and made it look like she was wearing underwear made of hair. The absurdity of the sight nearly made her laugh.<br />
<br />
Moving down even further, Mary examined her legs, and once again, she did not like what she saw. Before, she looked at her legs as one of the first areas, but now it was one of the last. With so much time in between, the contrast was stark. The coating of hair from before had now grown much thicker. Her thighs now had long dark hairs everywhere, with the longest and darkest near the top, merging with her vagina bush. Mary thought they couldn&#39;t even pass for a man&#39;s thighs now, although at this point no other part of her could either. Her lower legs shocked her. They looked totally alien, like they belonged to a different species. The hair was so long there that it hung down and covered her ankles and feet. Mary was almost reminded of a Clydesdale horse&#39;s hairy hooves. Her feet, which she also neglected to check before, looked worse than Hobbit feet, even without the extra veil of hair from her legs.<br />
<br />
The last area to check was her back. Mary had also neglected that area, aside from a quick glance early on, so she braced herself as she twisted around. The first thing she noticed was a thick trail of hair traveling from her neck, down her spine, and ending just above her ass. Her ass itself was covered in long curly hair, just like her vagina. Her earlier observation about wearing underwear made of hair was actually true. Mary joked that she picked a terrible time to be a fortune teller.<br />
<br />
Having finished another examination, Mary let out a sigh. She wondered how much more hair could even fit on her body. Her skin was already starting to disappear under it all, so she figured it couldn&#39;t be much longer until the changes ended. A few areas, namely her waist and armpits, had already been totally smothered and buried under the wild growth. Many other areas were approaching that same point, and even the least hairy areas had a noticeable layer of the brown stuff. It had been about 20-25 minutes since she drank the vial, and given the rate at which her body hair had been growing, Mary doubted the transformation would require more than another 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
Her mane was getting large enough that even a part down the middle couldn&#39;t keep it out of her face. Mary pushed the massive locks of hair away, grabbed a cup, and filled it with water. It was refreshing, despite being from the tap. Supporting her mane was getting exhausting, so she sat down on a stool nearby and rubbed her neck. A few things came from doing this. Mary noticed that she couldn&#39;t feel the seat underneath her, despite being being naked. The hair on her ass was so thick that it acted as insulation. She also noticed that her mane had continued growing down her neck, and had begun to wrap around onto her shoulders. Mary remembered the jokes she made about having a mane, and wondered if she jinxed herself. She was almost curious to see where her mane would take her. Nothing like this had ever happened before, so there was no way to tell. Nothing was permanent, so there was no real risk either.<br />
<br />
She continued resting for another 5 or so minutes, just rubbing her hands around her body and feeling all the rough itchy hair, until her phone rang. It was number she didn&#39;t recognize, but she pushed her hair out of the way, held the phone up to her ear, and answered the call anyway. It was then that she realized she couldn&#39;t hear, which was weird, because she wasn&#39;t normally deaf. Glancing in the mirror, she saw tufts of fluffy hair overflowing from her ear canal and subsequently muffling all noise. To get around this, Mary turned up the volume on the phone until she could make out the words. It worked, but she sighed and hung up when she realized it was a spam call.<br />
<br />
It had now been a little more than 35 minutes. The itching was still very noticeable all over her body, and showed no signs of slowing down. Having been wrong in her prediction, she now had no clue when the the growth would stop, if ever. Mary stood up and got another cup of water. Letting out a sigh, she figured she might as well do a third examination.<br />
<br />
Whereas before the locks on her head were long and beautiful, now they just looked overgrown and wild. The massive volume and the sheer thickness of Mary&#39;s mane were enough to make using a comb or brush practically impossible. The hair reached down to the floor now, and she feared it would pose a hazard if it got much longer. Rubbing along her neck and shoulders, Mary confirmed her suspicions from before as she felt her mane beginning to creep around onto the front of her neck and even onto her chest.<br />
<br />
Mustering up the strength to gaze upon her face, Mary leaned in, parted the sea of hair, and gazed in awe upon something she couldn&#39;t even call human. Her unibrow had continued its wild growth, and it was long enough to stick up in a way that made her look like a mad scientist. Her forehead had continued to shrink, and the sides of her hairline were now firmly joined with the outer edges of her unibrow. All that was left was a big fuzzy oval of forehead in the middle. Her facial hair had fully grown in, and she had a very impressive beard. It merged into her mane at the sides under the ears, just where she was rubbing before. Everywhere else, there was a noticeable layer of brown hair. Altogether, Mary thought her face looked hideous. From an experimental point of view, it was very interesting, but she was glad she wouldn&#39;t be stuck looking that way forever.<br />
<br />
Moving down to her torso, Mary saw nothing but hair. It wasn&#39;t even worth it to separate upper and lower parts anymore, because the hair had grown in everywhere, connecting everything. Her entire chest was covered in a heavy layer of curly brown hair. Her breasts weren&#39;t spared, and also had a thick covering of long, dense hair. Her nipples were totally hidden, and her skin was no longer visible anywhere on her chest. It looked like Mary had two big hairy coconuts on her chest instead of boobs. Her pubic hair had apparently grown up onto her stomach, because her gut was now covered in a curly mass of hair, and there was no definite border between the two areas.<br />
<br />
Making sure not to forget her arms, Mary went back up and checked them next. Lifting them up yet again, the hair draped down from her armpits and wrapped around the sides, merging together with her hairy shoulders and into her chest hair. The hair on her upper arms was long and thick, but some skin could still be seen. It was a different story, however, lower down. Her forearms were totally covered in extremely long, extremely dense hair. The hair was able to drape down and cover her hands, just like her legs did to her feet. She was reminded again of a horse&#39;s hair hanging down from its legs to cover its hooves. Holding her arms out, she saw two large brown curtains swaying back and forth. The backs of her hands were very nearly gone as well. Holding her fingers together, it looked like she was wearing big furry oven mitts. Her palms were still void of all hair, which didn&#39;t surprise Mary, given that there was none last time she checked. <br />
<br />
Moving back down to her legs, Mary saw that her pubic had grown down as well as up. Her thighs were totally covered in thick curly hair, just like her stomach. She tried to make another joke about wearing shorts made of hair, but realized she may as well be wearing a full suit made of hair at this point. The lower half of her legs had grown even more hair. It draped down around her feet and dragged along the floor for an inch or two, creating even more risk for tripping. Her feet now looked like furry slippers from above, but the soles of her feet were totally clean, like her palms. Again, no surprise there.<br />
<br />
Twisting around and struggling to push her mane out of the way, Mary moved on to the final area to examine. The trail of hair along her spine had grown thicker and fuller, and had also spread sideways, covering all of her back in hair. Her ass hair had grown up and down, just like her pubic hair, and the whole lumbar region of her back, as well as the backs of her legs, were smothered in thick curly brown hair.<br />
<br />
With the third examination done, it was now nearing 45 minutes since Mary drank the vial. She filled another cup with water and sat down again, mulling over her observations. The major areas of her body were totally buried, with no skin visible at all. Only some smaller areas still had skin visible, like the edges of her back, some parts of her face, and joints like her elbows and knees. Well, technically her palms and soles counted too. Mary held out a hand, twisting it around. The stark contrast between hairy and hairless was almost pretty in a way. Her nails were long and had been painted a dark navy color during her last nail salon visit, so it almost looked like she had claws. She made a swiping motion and did a play growl, chuckling to herself. Drinking more water, Mary realized she was hot. She figured the massive amounts of hair all over her body must act as insulation and trap her body heat. The nearest thermostat was in her bedroom one room over, so she got up and walked over there, making it cooler. <br />
<br />
On her way back to the bathroom, she wasn&#39;t paying attention and tripped on her hair. In that split second while falling, she tried to put her hands out but got them caught inside her mane, causing her to hit the ground chin first, with a thud and a clack as her teeth bit into her tongue, drawing blood. Mary cried out and put her hands to her face in an unsuccessful attempt to soothe the pain. With tears in her eyes, she swallowed some blood and stood up slowly. Walking carefully back to the bathroom, she held out her tongue in the mirror. Luckily, it was still intact, but the cuts were deep, and she worried she might need stitches. Mary dug through her cabinets and found a small first aid kit. She was no doctor, but she figured she could wrap a bandage around her tongue until she had a chance to go get it checked out. Taking out a bandage and some gauze to soak up blood, she wrapped it all around her tongue and made sure it was secure. She felt as her tongue throbbed in dull pain and began to swell up. Overall, Mary thought this was kind of a stupid idea, but there was no way she could go out looking the way she did, and she assumed the Hair + and - vials took the same amount of time to work, so she&#39;d be waiting around either way.<br />
<br />
Mary sat down again and breathed a heavy sigh, feeling pretty stupid for having injured herself the way she did. She let her mane hang over her face as if she were hiding in shame behind a curtain. She remained in the chair for a few more minutes, feeling her tongue throb and letting her neck rest from the weight of her mane. Eventually, she noticed that the itching all over her body had mostly died down. It only remained in full force around her face and mane.<br />
<br />
After everything that just happened, Mary was tired and didn&#39;t want to do another examination, so she quickly pushed her mane out of the way and skimmed over her body, coming to the conclusion that there was no more skin visible anywhere on her body. She figured her hair had finally crossed the threshold into fur. Between a mane and a thick coat of fur, Mary felt more like an animal than a human. <br />
<br />
The itching still persisted on her face and head, so she decided to give those areas a good look. In short, her entire face was covered in fur. Her unibrow was now so out of control that it stuck up high enough to hide most of her forehead, which already had its own layer of fur. She noticed that her beard had grown upward along her cheeks and had covered her nose, with both halves of the beard meeting at the bridge of her nose. From there, the unibrow and beard connected right in the middle of her nose, covering the last remaining exposed skin anywhere on her body, except for her palms and soles. <br />
<br />
Her mane now dragged across the floor with a few feet of excess following behind her. It hung all around her body like a heavy cloak, covering her whole body and leaving only her face open. It was easy to see how she could trip over it. She was lucky she wore her hair with a part down the middle, or else the mane would have naturally fallen all over her face and smothered her. That said, a lot of hair still got in her eyes and made it hard to see. Rubbing her hands along her chest and neck, she could tell her mane had grown across her chest and now connected just below her beard. She figured that must explain how the cloak covered the front of her body but left her face open. Her beard itself had grown remarkably long since she last saw it. In fact, it was so long that it almost looked like part of her mane.<br />
<br />
Altogether, it had been 55 minutes since Mary drank the vial. Considering that most of the itching had already disappeared, she was able to hazard a guess that the remaining itching would disappear by the 1 hour mark. With just 5 minutes remaining, Mary breathed a sigh of relief. The transformation wouldn&#39;t end, however, without giving her one last scare. At about 3 minutes left, Mary suddenly found that she was unable to breathe through her nose. She panicked for a second before realizing she could just open her mouth. Wondering why she could no longer use her nose, she took another look at her face.<br />
<br />
Mary didn&#39;t realize it before, but her nose hair had grown very slowly, allowing her to breathe easily throughout the transformation. Now that everything was almost done, the nose hair caught up with the rest of her fur and stuffed up her nose just like her ears. Her mustache and beard were also growing in the final minutes. They finally became part of her mane and covered most of her mouth, save for a small gap, allowing her to breathe. Mary&#39;s majestic mane had finally surrounded and engulfed her entire head and body, leaving nothing visible but a pair of eyes and a small hole of a mouth.<br />
<br />
With the last of the itching finally disappearing, Mary turned to look at her full figure in the mirror. What she saw was a big lump of hair with eyes that reminded her of Cousin It from the Addams Family. All she needed was a pair of sunglasses and a hat. Using her arms to push away the hair, she saw another layer of long, fluffy brown fur covering everything underneath. Mary thought she looked like a furry animal wrapped in a cocoon made of more fur. It was nearly impossible to even tell there was a body inside all the fur, since it all meshed together as one whole entity.<br />
<br />
And so, her accident turned experiment was complete. She shuffled awkwardly and slowly around the bathroom, afraid of tripping again. Mary tried to think of what to do with her new body, but realized she couldn&#39;t do much due to her lack of hearing, speech, smell, and limited eyesight. Unless crawling around and bumping into stuff was a sport, she&#39;d have to get creative.</p>
