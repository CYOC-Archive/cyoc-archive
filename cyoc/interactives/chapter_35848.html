<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Daniel let loose a **WOOF** of joy, practically leaping off the couch and advancing toward <br />
Jennifer.  Eyes closed, his black, wet nose drank in Jennifer's odor.  To his canine brain, <br />
it was a heavenly combination of the soft soapy smell of the shampoo that clung to her <br />
fur, the lilac scent of the perfume she'd put on earlier that day, and the sharp spicy musk <br />
of a female dog in heat.  <br />
<br />
Caught up in the moment, Daniel didn't even see the coffee table in his way.  In mid-<br />
stride, his leg hit the table, throwing him off balance and sending him sprawling onto his <br />
back on the living room carpet.  As Daniel started to get up, he grimaced, not hurt from <br />
the fall but afraid that Jennifer might have changed her mind.  Instead, glancing up, he <br />
could see that although she was shaking with laughter, Jennifer was still in the same <br />
position as before, her tail raised in readiness exposing the soft rose colored flesh <br />
of her pussy below.  <br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
Hearing the crash, Jennifer had looked back and could see Daniel on the floor, his ears <br />
pulled back in embarrassment.  She couldn't stop herself from laughing a little at the <br />
comic sight of the Dalmatian boy on his back with his limbs splayed out over the floor like <br />
some cartoon character.  &quot;Get up Daniel&quot; she said, shaking her ass for extra <br />
encouragement.  <br />
<br />
Daniel got to his hands and knees starting to rise, but the sight of Daniel on all fours <br />
brought a new warmth to her tortured snatch.  Maybe, it was the glimpse of Daniel's <br />
exposed pink dog cock, slapping gently against the white pubic fur of his belly.   &quot;Come <br />
over here just like that, Daniel,&quot; prodded Jennifer, feeling light headed from the waiting.  <br />
<br />
Daniel advanced on all fours, finding that in spite of his humanoid body that was only <br />
partly dog, he was able to walk with considerable ease.  He relished the feel of his <br />
handpaws and footpaws on the thick pile of the rug, his tail starting to wag in excitement.  <br />
Step-by-step, he stalked toward the golden retriever girl, his brain dominated by a single <br />
thought.  <br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, he looks sexy like that,&quot; thought Jennifer, admiring the perfect combination of dog <br />
and boy that was about to fuck her.  Daniel still had his brown, slightly unkept human hair <br />
that blended into the short fur of his head, along with his very human dark green eyes.  He <br />
even still had the same skinny body she remembered from their days together in class.  <br />
<br />
And yet, the rest of Daniel was pure canine -his white and black-spotted fur, his hunky <br />
muzzle, and his big handpaws and footpaws with the short brown doggy claws <br />
she found so primordially arousing.  No matter what he had been before, deep inside, she <br />
knew that Daniel was fundamentally the same as all the boys she had dealt with in high <br />
school (even as a human) -just a horny dog.<br />
<br />
--------------------<br />
<br />
He was finally behind her.  She could feel his hot breath on her aching femaleness.  <br />
&quot;Jennifer, your smell.  It's amazing!  I mean...it's just **WOOF**&quot; Daniel exclaimed, <br />
signaling in a single bark more than he ever could in mere words.<br />
<br />
Then it happened.  Daniel's long tongue shot out and in a flurry of licking, he began to <br />
devour Jennifer's pussy.  &quot;Oh Daniel!&quot; Jennifer shrieked, her yell devolving into a high-<br />
pitched yelp of pleasure as her lover began to give extra attention to the velvety area <br />
of her genitals where the short golden fuzz of her crotch gave way to the soft exposed <br />
skin of her pussy.  Shaking and rooted to the spot, she felt her cunt become lubricated by <br />
the slick fluids leaking from her body, covering her pussy and slowly running down the <br />
long yellow tufts of fur that grew from the back of her legs.<br />
<br />
The front of his muzzle wet with Jennifer's juices, Daniel quickly wiped them off on the <br />
back of his handpaw.  &quot;She's ready for me.  The Jennifer-bitch is ready,&quot; a little voice piped <br />
up in his head, clear as a bell.  He felt his penis bone push out to its maximum, his <br />
dogdom now a hard titanium rod.  <br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Jennifer noticed that Daniel had stopped licking her femaleness, and, all human logic <br />
leaving her, feared for a moment that he had lost interest.  But then it happened!  He was <br />
inside her, his slick throbbing canine member filling her tortured void.  &quot;FUCK ME <br />
DOGBOY!  Yes, Yes, Grrrrr-yes grrruff, ruff, ruff!&quot; Jennifer woofed, the rut of animal sex <br />
enveloping her mind like a blanket.  She savored the feel of of Daniel's pointed stalk <br />
ravaging the warm cavern of her innermost sanctum.  &quot;If only Kyle Perkins could see us,&quot; <br />
thought Jennifer.<br />
<br />
Then...she feel it -the skin-on-skin contact of Daniel's rapidly swelling canine knot with <br />
her pussy.  &quot;That's a good boy Daniel, A GOOD BOY!&quot; wheezed Jennifer, starving for more.  <br />
Like a sex crazed beast, he was now pounding into her, growling loudly with each inward <br />
thrust as she felt her cunt being stretched.  &quot;Grrrrrruff.  Get in me now!&quot; huffed Jennifer, <br />
desperate to feel Daniel's full maleness inside her.<br />
<br />
-------------------<br />
<br />
Daniel was reveling in his dominance over Jennifer, fully embracing his natural role as the <br />
alpha male.  &quot;I'm a dog.  A big, sexy dog with sharp teeth, and fur, and claws, and I <br />
fucking love it&quot; he thought to himself.  Enjoying his control over the retriever girl, he <br />
playfully squeezed one of her lower nipples with his claws making her squeal.  <br />
<br />
The sharp sensation of a new part of her body being stimulated crashed into Jennifer, and <br />
she automatically pushed back onto Daniel's cock, no longer in control of herself as her <br />
orgasm took hold.  With that, Daniel felt an unearthly pressure on his knot, as his full <br />
canineness passed into Jennifer.  &quot;ARRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOO&quot; howled, Daniel, <br />
throwing his head back and baying his conquest to the empty living room as jets of hot, <br />
thick Dalmatian spunk shot from his twitching cock inside Jennifer.</p>
