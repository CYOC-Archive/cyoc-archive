<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ahmed (in Carlos’s beefy body which he had just seized control of) and Trent (in a new body he had just created, mixing Ryan and Shawn with Ahmed’s inhuman muscles, dressed head to toe in squeaking black leather) were, once again, passionately making out in the back seat of a taxi cab on the way back to Trent’s apartment. Trent was reaching his hand underneath Ahmed’s shirt, feeling the full pecs that he intended to claim for his own. Ahmed was rubbing the rough beard and the thigh of the man he knew had his own body stored away somewhere inside. The driver rolled up the partition as the two began moaning in ecstasy. By the time they arrived at the apartment, Ahmed was practically on top of Trent, who would have felt emasculated if he were not sitting in a body that was over 200 pounds of muscle. In fact, he liked being worshipped; he was a god, and had even more power than the already massive body showed, even if his massive bulges were already about to rip straight through his skintight leather suit. Ahmed, however, knew those muscles and bulges were his own, and would not let Trent go until he got them back. And there were two other minds in the body he had, both forced to go along for the ride, forced to see and feel everything but unable to take control. <br />
<br />
They stepped out of the car, Ahmed first, both unwilling to break the kiss. They climbed the stairs together again, slowly but eagerly unbuttoning and unzipping their skintight clothes. When they got inside, Trent threw Ahmed onto the bed, pulled Ahmed’s pants straight down, and began working his way up and down, kissing and licking every taut inch of the smoothly tanned body of the Hispanic hunk he believed to be Carlos, the body he so desperately wanted to be inside. Ahmed, pulling Trent’s giant body further on top of himself, almost lost sight of his purpose in the ecstasy; absorbing Ahmed’s body had turned Trent into an amazingly talented lover. For a second Ahmed even wanted Trent to take his new body as well. But he soon remembered, and began guiding Trent’s hands and mouth to his massive uncut cock, engorged with blood. Trent took the hint and began playing with it, licking it, and biting it through Ahmed’s boxers. To get a better feel, he absorbed the leather gloves he was still wearing into his thick, meaty hands before pulling it out, stroking the shaft up and down, and sticking the entire thing into his talented mouth. He looked up at Ahmed questioningly, and Ahmed winked, put his hand on Trent’s head, and moving it up and down all nine inches of his cock. <br />
<br />
Ahmed was not prepared for the sensation this gave him. He had never been uncut before and did not know how to control himself. He nearly lost his mind with the sheer intensity of the sexual pleasure. Maybe it was this and maybe it was the presence of the lustful human ring right on top of him, but he lost control. The dick erupted down Trent’s open throat, and Ahmed’s mind did with it. He felt his way through Trent’s body, trying to take control. Trent, after swallowing the massive load, heard who he thought was Carlos say “what the fuck?!?” He tried to reassure him, saying “don’t worry babe, it’s alright; I have more exciting plans for tonight anyway.” But “Carlos” said “no, who the fuck are you and how the fuck did I get here? And why the fuck are you making me hard?!?” Apparently now Jason had taken control of Carlos’s body and, not being used to the musculature or the gay dick, was confused as to why he found Trent and himself so fucking hot. <br />
<br />
That’s when Trent heard Ahmed inside of him. Panicking, he tried to use his powers to separate them, but Ahmed was smarter than Trent. As soon as he felt the ring-now-Trent begin to work, he began pulling his own body out and rebuilding it. But the ring was Trent, and Trent’s focus at the moment was to keep Ahmed’s body for his own. Within thirty seconds the bodies had separated, but Ahmed wad in the wrong one. He found himself looking once again at his own body which he had been born into and had built into the shape of a god, and he was looking through the eyes of the gorgeous man who had stolen that glorious body out from under him. Trent, now once again in Ahmed’s body, was angry. He lunged at Ahmed and tried to forcibly merge with him, but he found that he no longer had the ring’s power. Ahmed likewise tried to reclaim his old body, but found that he now fully possessed this body, and that he had no ring inside him to change that. Wrestling with each other, they noticed the ring on the ground beneath them, and began clamoring for it. Trent, being the stronger one since he possessed Ahmed’s old muscles, managed to throw Ahmed off of him to lunge for the ring, but before either of them could fully react, they heard a loud moan coming from the bed. They both looked toward it, and Trent found himself blasted in the face with another massive shot of cum. Jason, overwhelmed by his new attractions and new autoerotic body, had been watching the two wrestle and lost control of himself. He lay slumped and satisfied on the bed in full control of Carlos’s body, while Trent in Ahmed’s body began struggling against himself and collapsed on the ground motionless. Contained in the cumshot had been Carlos’s own mind, who was now working his control over Ahmed’s body. Filled with the same new autoerotic lust that had stupefied Jason, he began massaging his new massive cut cock and feeling up his new body. Jason, now eager to explore his new sexual desires, leaped down from the bed and took the huge man’s hung package into his mouth. He loves every inch of it. Carlos was thankful for this and began facefucking his own massive Hispanic body. He threw Jason off right before he climaxed, and aimed for the ring; he felt Trent’s mind leave in the cumshot and watched as the ring soaked up the cum as Trent desperately looked for control. All of them were smart enough not to touch it. Ahmed, Jason, and Carlos were now all in the wrong bodies, but none of them were unhappy; the bodies that were available were the peak of human sexuality. They were all eager to explore their newly developed sexual desires. “Got any more of that for me?” Ahmed asked. Carlos winked, and the three of them began feeling each other up before throwing themselves onto the bed to have the night of their lives.</p>
