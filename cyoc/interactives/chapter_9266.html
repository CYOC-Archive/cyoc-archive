<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff wanted it all. He wanted to have chest hair, and he wanted to be able to grow a full beard if he wanted to, and he wanted to be just hairy enough to feel manly, but not too hairy to feel like an ape. He envied all those guys who had stubble on their faces after only a day of not shaving, it wasn’t fair to him that he still had nothing to shave. <br />
<br />
But this was perfect. <br />
<br />
Then Jeff pressed enter on the chronovac. Suddenly, he got a funny sensation. An odd tingling overcame his body, especially on his stomach and legs. Jeff realized that it was working and quickly took of his shirt to examine the changes. Nothing seemed to appear yet. So Jeff stood up out of his seat and began to take off his pants. Soon he was standing there in only his boxers staring eagerly at his body, waiting for the hair to sprout. He felt an itching around his crotch. When he pulled his boxers open he could already see that the hair down there was already thickening and darkening. &quot;Whoa&quot; he said to himself. Then his legs started itching. He walked to the bathroom, though the hallway mirror all the while he was scratching his legs. Yet he was self conscious not to be caught like this. He peeked around the door just before he left the privacy of that room before walking into the hallway. He went to into the bathroom quickly and closed the door, locking it. <br />
<br />
There he stood in front of the mirror, Nothing still on his chest or stomach, but it did itch. His legs were noticeably thicker. &quot;Dude!&quot; he said to himself as he examined his armpit, shocked at how thick it was growing. He looked down again, nonchalantly scratching his navel, now he noticed something. Hair! finally appearing there beneath his navel, starting to thicken, darken. It was soft and short, the hairs very thin and barely visible at first, but they were quickly becoming more and more visible. Soon, he was able to see a well-established &quot;happy trail&quot;, yet it was still somewhat faint in the mirror. That wasn’t all, simultaneously, hair began spreading up his stomach, reaching past his navel. Thickening. Then Jeff realized that it had become more noticeable in the mirror, that dark line of hair, in fact, it was clear as day. Jeff was ecstatic. <br />
<br />
Then, as he stared down, Jeff began to notice something else different. Hair was starting to appear around his nipples. Little thin dark brown hairs were surrounding them. Jeff scratched his chest, and as he did so, he swore he could see tiny hairs sprout from it. Those tiny hairs we're growing fast though, and all that time he spent staring at his chest, he didn’t even notice how thick the hair on his stomach was becoming. It almost covered his entire stomach now. It was more than visible in the mirror, and he thought how odd he looked, being so hairy. He didn’t recognize his own body. Meanwhile, Jeff was also scratching his chin, and the rest of his face. He quickly leaned over to the mirror to watch for changes on his face. <br />
<br />
Sure enough, little brown hairs were appearing on his upper lip and chin. As well as the slight sign of sideburns. Jeff watched closely, closer than ever as the hairs began to spread and thicken. They were lengthening too, growing longer. When Jeff finally looked at himself again in the mirror he was amazed, his face had hair on it! He had grown a little brown moustache, some light sideburns and a little under his chin. Jeff was still scratching his chest...<br />
<br />
Jeff moved back from the mirror to get a look at his body. He was shocked. He hadn’t taken his eyes off of his chest for more than a few seconds, but the change was more than drastic. Thick brown chest hair had grown in between his little pecs, and the hair was even starting the spread onto them. The hairs around his nipples were much more noticeable. Jeff could see the hair on his chest even while standing feet away from the mirror. Not to mention the abundant amount of hair that had grown and was still growing on his stomach. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is weird&quot; he thought to himself, while moving his hands slowly though the massive happytrail on his abs. he felt more masculine, that was for sure. As he looked down, he noticed his arms were different, they were more hairy, a lot more hairy. They looked like a man's in that sense. His forearms were still thin, but they were definitely changed. His jaw, looking back in the mirror, was now covered with thin brown downy hair. He rubbed his hands on it. It felt soft and small, while he now had a rather pronounced goatee. His moustache had grown so thick, and it had spread all the way down to the hair on his chin, as well as connecting to the hair sprouting just underneath his lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is so awesome&quot; he muttered to himself, overcome with intense excitement. Looking back at his chest was again, shocking. The hair was spreading, now at a more rapid pace, across the top of his chest and over his pecs. In the mirror he saw a thick mass of hair under his arms, and watched intently as his chest hair began to spread towards his pits. He was amazed at the rate it was now growing, far faster than before, He placed his hand upon his chest towards the base of his neck, high on his chest and felt the hairs thickening and growing underneath his hand. This was beyond amazing, it was surreal. He removed his hand to see a patch of hair quickly moving up towards his neck, thickening all the while. Soon a little tuft appeared on the base of his neck, then the hairs started up again, on their seemingly endless march upwards. His neck was soon covered with those soft downy brown hairs that had overtaken his jaws and his chin, now it was starting to grow on his cheeks as well. He noticed how thick his sideburns had become, as he stood there, Hell, he had grown a full beard now. More than a beard, actually, a beard that connected to his chest hair.<br />
<br />
His chest, as he stared wide eyed at it, was now transformed into a mass of brown swirling hair. it was like nothing he'd ever imagined. He ran his fingers though it, admiring it and loving every moment of it. He stood back a bit in the mirror and admired his new hair. His chest hair now fully covered the front side of his body, fully connected to his neck, his stomach, and his armpits, where hair was bulging out all over. <br />
<br />
&quot;I’m a freaking animal&quot; he said aloud. He looked down at his hands. Hair had appeared everywhere, all over his arm, thick and full, extending well past his wrists. Nothing could hide his hairiness now. he looked at his face. How old he looked with a beard. He looked very manly, but odd. It seemed strange seeing how young he was, having a full hairy middle-age-man-sized beard. He noticed also how thick his eyebrows had grown. Thick and heavy. He looked darker, more masculine with all this new hair. He was so impressed by it, he loved every bit of it. <br />
<br />
Jeff pulled his T-shirt back on. It couldn’t possibly cover how hairy he was now. The thick tuffs of hair overwhelming the collar of his shirt. Plus his beard! As manly as he felt, he didn’t like his beard. It was too much. He thought, it didn’t make him look so, handsome, or at least like he wanted. All he wanted were some good, solid sideburns. But he got much, much more than that. <br />
<br />
&quot;Man, I need to shave&quot; he said. But this presented a problem. He owned no razor, and the only one in the house was upstairs in his dad's bathroom. But he didn’t want to go up there looking like this... What if his sister saw him? He needed to think of a way to sneak past her. &quot;Good thing dad isn’t home,” he said quietly. He gave himself a final look in the mirror, overcome with the excitement of a possible first shave, he opened the door and ran up the stairs, still in his boxers....</p>
