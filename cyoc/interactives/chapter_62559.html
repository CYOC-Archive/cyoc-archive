<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With MacClure behind bars, things rapidly quieted down. Of course there were still things that ended up needing police attention, but none of them were anything really big. Speeding tickets, issues of drunken driving incidents, that sort of thing. And for the rest of the month, that is the sort of life that I returned to now that the big issue of MacClure's trial being over.<br />
<br />
The only big thing going on police-wise at the moment was related to &quot;William&quot;. The man who had attempted to kidnap Megan Jenkins. And that issue seemed to &quot;blow up&quot; a few days after Tabby had told Molly and I that she would run for the School District Superintendent's office. Officer Jenkins and I had just made our way into the station when Officer Howard called us into his office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Officer Jenkins, Officer Wayne,&quot; Officer Howard spoke as we entered his office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning, sir,&quot; we answered, though it wasn't in sync, but Officer Howard seemed to get the message.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid I'm going to have to split the two of you up for the next few days,&quot; Officer Howard spoke slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is Officer Barnes ready to come back?&quot; I wondered as I knew he would be ready to return to patrol duty fairly soon.<br />
<br />
&quot;He won't be ready for fairly close to a month, yet,&quot; Officer Howard sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We haven't done anything wrong?&quot; Officer Jenkins wondered, &quot;Have we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;there are some things I've overheard being mentioned on you Officer Wayne, but it's nothing that is truly wrong... and from what you've told me about yourself... I can almost understand where you're coming from...&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly nodded. I had studied law enforcement to prove I could do just as good a job as my father did in Peoria, and for the most part I was fairly sure I'd done a very good job at that. My greatest problem, however, was that I had a very protective nature when it came to things I liked and or loved. I technically broke the law to save Molly from Changes' &quot;Freak Show&quot;, and that was before I became a tiger myself. Since my transformation, that instinct seemed to be stronger now. I wasn't sure if that was simply redirected territorial instincts, but I did know that if some wrong was done that was somewhat personal to me or to Molly, or to those I counted as friends, I had to be careful not to do something I'd regret later. And even with all of that, I was privately sure that that issue would be the thing I'd have to deal with the most.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're going to have to split you up for the moment because of the kidnapper,&quot; Officer Howard sighed, &quot;he won't accept any offer that we've made to get some sort of plea bargain arranged and seems intent on forcing a trail.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;William was always fairly firm in his stance on things,&quot; Officer Jenkins sighed, &quot;I still can't understand why he came all this way to steal my baby girl from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I looked down to her. The attempted kidnapping of her daughter was still an issue for her, and the last thing she wanted was to have her child taken from her. Her voice seemed to get weaker as she talked about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can deal with this,&quot; I told her, &quot;you can't be the same person he remembers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Officer Jenkins slowly nodded, &quot;I just need to gather myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Officer Howard said firmly, &quot;as his trial is the reason we're having to split you up a little while. Officer Jenkins, as the mother of the victim, you will be expected to testify. Officially, you are being granted a special leave to attend the trial in that capacity. Unofficially, you are to help Officer Sane in looking after William during the trial.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Officer Wayne?&quot; Officer Jenkins wondered, &quot;He helped get Megan back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And did a good job,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;but the job he did was minor in comparison to the others. And any questions related to Officer Wayne cane be answered easily by Officer Sane. So, for the most part, Officer Wayne will return to doing lone foot patrols until William's trial is over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, sir,&quot; Officer Jenkins nodded, &quot;when does the trial start?&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Howard then gave both of us the beginning schedule of the hearings that William would be hearing. The trial would again be held in the County Court House in Kalispell, and once Officer Howard finished the briefing was over.<br />
<br />
&quot;One quiet patrol today,&quot; Officer Jenkins sighed, &quot;and tomorrow, one private nightmare for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll manage,&quot; I told her, &quot;I know you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The next few days went fairly quietly. My work in Columbia Falls remained on foot patrols of the town responding to calls that did not require me to run across the the length of the town or run after cars. Things I could be called to could be fairly big, if I happened to be close enough to respond, but for the most part, with no vehicle, I was expecting fairly light duty. And for the next few days things were rather quiet. The only call I got was one of a report of odd behavior. Supposedly a teen was seen moping about on a street corner.<br />
<br />
I found the teen rather easily. A young girl, likely between sixteen and eighteen. She was seated on the curb tossing small pebbles across the street and into a ditch on the other side of the road.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, Miss,&quot; I spoke as I approached her, &quot;Excuse me, I'm going to need you to stop that, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked up to me and gave a half shrug and a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello,&quot; I responded calmly, and trying to be friendly, &quot;What's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothin' really,&quot; the teen answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've gotten a call that reports you engaged in some &quot;odd behavior&quot;,&quot; I informed her, &quot;are you sure nothing's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing truly illegal,&quot; she answered, &quot;I think. Just sitting here, skipping rocks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most people skip rocks on a pond,&quot; I told her, &quot;and you might accidentally hit a car here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't have a vehicle to go down to Hungary Horse Reservoir,&quot; the teen replied. It was clear by her tone that something was bothering her. She didn't appear to be doing anything illegal, but something was bothering her all the same.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don't you put the pebbles down, and we can talk about what's troubling you,&quot; I offered, hoping it would get her away from the street and get her back in a mood that wouldn't be raising the suspicions of the people living in that part of town.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a cop, not a councilor,&quot; she answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I am a Police Officer,&quot; I responded, &quot;here to protect and serve. And as far as I can see, something's gnawing at you. I'm here to help, if you'll let me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; she sighed, &quot;there's this boy... and I think he likes me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with that,&quot; I responded, &quot;Do you like him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... we're on good terms, if that is what you mean,&quot; she replied, &quot;we've hung out together and stuff like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That shouldn't be a problem then,&quot; I commented, &quot;what's the problem?&quot;<br />
<br />
She seemed to pause for a moment and then asked me a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're married to the &quot;Tiger-Lady&quot; my little sister talks about, right?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Molly Rhoer-Wayne, yes,&quot; I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you desire her?&quot; she asked, &quot;sexually, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was immediately thankful she could see me blush through my fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said slowly after a few moments.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; she replied equally nervously, &quot;I don't desire him sexually... I don't... swing... that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing wrong with that, either,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't hate me for it?&quot; she gasped, &quot;those who do know that I'm... different... they've all forsaken me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jerks,&quot; I dismissed it, &quot;I take it this boy doesn't know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no he doesn't,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;but I think he has a crush on me.&quot;<br />
<br />
I was beginning to see what her problem was, and while it wasn't really within my responsibilities as an officer to handle, I felt it best to give her my best advice.<br />
<br />
&quot;It would probably be wise that you told him,&quot; I sighed, &quot;a relationship between the two of you as it is probably wouldn't be happy... or at least not as happy as it should be... and you would have to hide who YOU are from a dear one to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what do I say?&quot; she asked, &quot;what if he rejects me? Just like everyone else who knows has?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If he truly likes you, he shouldn't reject you,&quot; I sighed, &quot;and if he doesn't, he didn't deserve your friendship in the first place... as for what to say... I can't give you the exact words, as I do not know this boy, but I would suggest that you emphasize that while you value his friendship... you wish it to remain platonic in nature.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Platonic?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Non-romantic in nature,&quot; I sighed, &quot;It wouldn't require you to come out of the closet, as it were, and would at least get your point across that dating him is not what you want to do... I can't really say anything else.&quot;<br />
<br />
She gave a half smile and said, &quot;thanks...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really didn't do much,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; she sighed, &quot;but you did help... I still really don't know what to say... but you've let me get a great weight off of my chest, as it were... and you did give me a starting point, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then came forward and gave me a friendly hug.<br />
<br />
&quot;And like any good cat, you didn't utterly reject me out of hand,&quot; she finished, &quot;and so I thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your welcome,&quot; I replied and patted her softly on the shoulder, &quot;try to stay out of the street.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then began quietly walking away, heading toward a nearby house while I activated the small walkie-talkie that I had with me.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is Officer Wayne, call was merely teenage angst, nothing more,&quot; I reported in.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Other then that odd call, there wasn't all that much that I was called to. Most of the time when I was called to anything, it was as backup, even with a few minor traffic stops to insure that the person either didn't struggle or attempt to flee if the vehicle had to be searched. Very minor stuff, which was a pleasant break from either the R.A.M. related actions to get rid of Molly and I, or violent interactions between the members of the now defunct organization.<br />
<br />
It was about a week later when I made my way into the station to find Officer Jenkins siting with Officer Barnes at the desk. She seemed to be giving him a few pointers on the desk duty he had been pulling while waiting for a doctor's &quot;OK&quot; to return to patrol work.<br />
<br />
&quot;He hasn't made a mistake has he?&quot; I asked as I approached, only slightly teasing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing that'll need to be corrected when Fred and I switch back when he recuperates,&quot; Officer Jenkins chuckled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're on duty,&quot; Officer Barnes reminded her.<br />
<br />
She shrugged it off, and seemed to be in a fairly good mood.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're in a good mood,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;William's trial ended yesterday,&quot; Officer Jenkins replied, &quot;he practically plead guilty with all he did in the trial... which I guess is good for me...&quot;<br />
<br />
I gave her a puzzled look.<br />
<br />
&quot;From what she's told me, he testified that while he took Megan, it wasn't kidnapping because he was the biological father and that he was taking her to a good home,&quot; Officer Barnes explained, &quot;essentially turned a criminal trial into a custody suit, which he was bound to lose because even if Officer Jenkins was as bad as the guy said she was, he didn't follow the protocols involved in custody battles and wouldn't be viewed as good enough to take custody.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brother...?&quot; I began to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;He doesn't do divorce work, but he does know some lawyers here who do,&quot; Officer Barnes nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you and Molly never go through that nightmare,&quot; Officer Jenkins commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd sooner die then divorce her,&quot; I said firmly, &quot;I love her too much to do something like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Officer Jenkins and Officer Barnes nodded. William's trial was over, and that is what put Officer Jenkins in a good mood. Megan was safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what went on here with you while I had to trudge through all of that?&quot; Officer Jenkins wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; I replied, and then began to go through the few very minor calls that I had been involved in while she dealt with the last of the difficulties her former colleague in Spokane, Washington had caused her.</p>
