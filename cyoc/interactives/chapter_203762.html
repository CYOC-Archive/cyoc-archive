<br />
Mark led the transforming male up the stairs, stopping in front of the closed door at the top. He reached into his pocket, pulled out some keys, and used one of them to unlock the door. The snow leopard held the door open and motioned for Todd to go inside.<br />
<br />
“After you,” he said. As the young male walked past him, Mark couldn’t help but look at his new bubble butt, complete with the beginnings of a tail beginning to show itself. The snow leopard licked his chops. He was going to enjoy this.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the door was a rather lavish looking studio loft apartment, complete with a full-sized kitchen, a living room with a rather large TV, and a few other noteworthy features. Todd was so impressed by the large apartment that he didn’t notice Mark creeping up behind him. It wasn’t until his raging hard-on was tightly gripped that the young man remembered he wasn’t alone. Todd let out a soft moan as his erection was grabbed, squirming slightly in the snow leopard’s grip.<br />
<br />
“I think you’re a little overdressed for my tastes,” Mark whispered, leaning in close and gently nibbling Todd’s ears as they continued to move to the top of his head. “Undress for me, pup.”<br />
<br />
Todd wasn’t entirely sure why, but he followed Mark’s orders in a heartbeat, taking off his shoes, socks, shirt, pants, and boxers before presenting himself to the snow leopard. He hardly noticed how his body had gained a fair bit of muscle, including a rather nice six pack. As Todd undressed, he failed to notice Mark grabbing something off the nearby table. It wasn’t until he felt something go around his neck that Todd snapped out of his lust-fueled trance.<br />
<br />
Around his neck was a royal blue dog collar, complete with a loop where someone could attach a name tag or a leash. The young man reached up and felt the collar, a mix of emotions washing over him. On one hand, he felt terrified that this stranger had just put a collar on him, but on the other hand, he felt rather…proud?<br />
<br />
Mark walked in front of him and placed a hand under the young man’s chin, examining the transforming young man. He watched with a smirk as Todd’s mouth and nose began to push out of his face, creating the start of a muzzle. At this point, gray fur was beginning to spread over Todd’s body much quicker, practically covering his new paw-like hands.<br />
<br />
“You’re coming more and more into your role as my new pup by the second,” Mark said, slipping off his tank top and revealing his muscular upper body. “Is that what you want? To be my pup?”<br />
<br />
Todd hesitated for a second. This felt wrong, but he wasn’t entirely sure why. This was what he’d always wanted: an experienced man who could show him a good time and open his eyes to new experiences. Maybe he should just…roll with everything that was happening…<br />
<br />
Todd threw himself into Mark, burying his flat, black nose into the snow leopard’s fur. The musk that emanated from the feline was driving the young man absolutely wild. The more he inhaled, the more submissive and loyal he felt towards Mark. He felt as if he were in the presence of a god…a sexy, muscular, gay feline god…and gods needed to be worshiped.<br />
<br />
Without wasting a second, Todd dropped to his knees and ripped down Mark’s shorts and boxers, revealing a thick, feline cock that stood at a massive ten inches. His tongue lolled out of his mouth, drool dripping as his mouth watered in anticipation. As much as he wanted to begin sucking on the throbbing piece of meat, he looked up at Mark and waited for his permission. The snow leopard nodded, and without any hesitation, the transforming male took the cock in his mouth.<br />
<br />
At first, it was a bit weird for Todd. He had fantasized about sucking another man’s dick before, but he never exactly knew what to expect from it. He honestly felt rather embarrassed for doing what he felt was a less than mediocre blowjob. He soon felt Mark’s clawed hand gently scratch his hair - or was it fur now - and the young man began to feel a little more at ease. Of course he wasn’t going to be a professional cocksucker on his first blowjob. He’d just need some practice.<br />
<br />
“You’re doing rather well for someone who only just got their muzzle,” Mark commented, scratching behind Todd’s new lupine ears. The feeling sent shivers of pleasure down the young man’s spine, stopping at the growing nub at his tailbone. Instead of dissipating, however, the feeling persisted, causing the nub to lengthen even further, with gray fur quickly sprouting all over it.<br />
<br />
After a few more minutes of letting the future wolf give him a blowjob, Mark took his cock out of Todd’s mouth, making the young man let out a rather canine-sounding whine.<br />
<br />
“W-Was I not doing well enough?” Todd asked, his new tail drooping and his ears flattening. “I…I can do better! Please give me another chance!” Mark simply laughed and petted the young man on his head, noting how his hair had now entirely turned into gray fur.<br />
<br />
“You were doing perfectly fine, pet,” Mark said. “I just don’t want to cum in your mouth. After all, there’s a much better place I can put it. Now, I think it’s time we get to the main event. Hands behind your back.”<br />
<br />
Todd instantly did as he was told, a jolt of pleasure rushing through his body. Mark walked behind the young man, and Todd could hear the sound of a drawer opening and closing. He then felt something wrap around his wrists, binding them together. Was that a rope? He then felt the same feeling around his ankles, rendering him completely unable to move. While a small part of Todd’s brain was panicking, afraid that Mark was going to do something terrible to him, the vast majority of his thoughts were of all the dirty things Mark could use him for.<br />
<br />
“Looks like someone has a bondage kink,” Mark said, running his paw-like hands along Todd’s sides. “You like being tied up by your master?”<br />
<br />
Master? Mark wasn’t his master…was he? Todd’s cock throbbed as skin began to grow and cover it up, creating a new sheath. As gray fur covered it up, the head of his cock began to emerge, except it looked much different. Instead of its usual rounded head, it had turned pointed and the skin had turned red. As it continued to emerge from the sheath, a thick knot grew in at the base. Todd looked down at his new canine cock, his tongue drooling with excitement and anticipation of what was to come.<br />
<br />
“Y-Yeah…” the young man panted, his feet lengthening slightly as his toes merged and thickened, creating four-digit canine paws. As his toenails blackened and turned into claws, thick black paw pads grew in on the bottom of his new paws. Todd let out a slight moan as his legs shifted to a digitigrade bone structure.<br />
<br />
“You’re looking more and more like my obedient little pup every passing second,” Mark commented. He bent down and scooped up the changing man in his arms, carrying him over to the couch. He set Todd down at one end before laying down at the other end of the couch and stretching his legs. Because the couch was small, there wasn’t enough room for both of them to stretch out. Of course, this was exactly what Mark wanted. He placed his right paw on Todd’s muzzle, and his left paw was placed on top of his throbbing canine erection. The young man whined in pleasure as the snow leopard began to rub his cock with his paw. As he moaned and whined, he began to sniff and lick his master’s paw. Mark let out a slight gasp as he felt Todd’s tongue against his pads. It was a surprise, but it was most definitely not an unwelcome one.<br />
<br />
“Well here I was thinking I’d have to train you to be a paw slut,” the snow leopard said, smirking as the gray fur covered Todd’s legs and rapidly spread up his chest. “You’re such a good boy. And do you know what good boys get?”<br />
<br />
“What, master?”<br />
<br />
“They get treats.”<br />
<br />
Mark took his paws away and quickly flipped Todd over on his stomach. The young wolf squirmed slightly as the snow leopard crawled on top of him, holding the wolf close like a predator would with its prey. Then, without warning, Mark shoved his cock into Todd’s hole. The wolf yelped as his ass was stretched for the first time, a mix of pain and pleasure rocking his body all at once.<br />
<br />
The pain faded quickly, giving way to the most wonderful feeling that Todd had ever felt in his life. The little resistance that remained was quickly snuffed out as Mark thrust his cock into the wolf’s hole over and over again, hitting a sweet spot that made the canine whine happily over and over again. As the gray fur completely overtook his body, Todd let his tongue loll out of his mouth as his master bred his ass. The human that had been repressing his sexual desires for years was gone, and in his place was a free, slutty wolf who only wanted to make his lover happy. He began to push against Mark’s thrusts, trying to get the feline’s cock deeper inside of him.<br />
<br />
Mark found himself getting closer to release a lot faster than usual. The young wolf’s virgin ass squeezed his cock like a vice grip. It felt far better than any other ass he had fucked in the past. Every thrust pushed him closer and close to the edge, until finally, he came. Upon feeling his lover’s hit seed enter his ass, Todd reached his climax as well, cumming all over himself and the couch.<br />
<br />
When their orgasms finally died down, the two laid there, taking deep breaths as they basked in the afterglow of such an intense session of lovemaking.<br />
<br />
“That was really something…” Mark commented, petting Todd’s head. “Haven’t had a fuck that good in months!”<br />
<br />
“Did…did I do well for my first time?” Todd panted, still shaking slightly from the pleasure.<br />
<br />
Mark chuckled and kissed the wolf’s muzzle. “You did fantastic, pup. I’m going to love having you around.”<br />
<br />
The next few days were…odd. <br />
<br />
Todd noticed his Driver’s License had changed. He shared Mark’s address now. Stranger still, packages were arriving with paperwork attached. Mark had taken the liberty to open them all.<br />
<br />
Dildos, anal beads, butt plugs-all of them unique in form and function. And Mark used them all on Todd. A butt plug shaped like a tongue that was slimy with lube that licked out his insides (for pre-anal cleaning!). A dildo shaped like a Rocket-Popsicle that he could somehow taste. Never-Ending-Anal-Beads that worked just like you’d think. The Anal Trainer, a vibrating butt plug that stretched Todd and greatly reduced his discomfort.<br />
<br />
And, lastly, a new product. It arrived in several boxes. Mark was particularly excited about this one, he’d custom-ordered it. It looked like a weightlifting machine, but something about it just seemed off. He managed a glimpse of the box and it promised multiple positions for subs that would also help build muscle and increase stamina.<br />
<br />
Todd noticed the return address on the box. His old place of work. The warehouse.<br />
<br />
So far, Todd really hadn’t done much in the small city except get fucked by Mark and paraded around the club as arm candy. But these boxes, these….impossible sex toys. It was all so surreal. Todd set out and walked for half an hour until he arrived at the end of a dirt road.<br />
<br />
There was a farm right next to it. He heard moans and squelching and saw what looked like a hugely muscular Rottweiler giving a lusty fat hog some major head. The two horny rednecks didn’t even notice Todd observing them, cock twitching. <br />
<br />
Todd swore he recognized them both from somewhere. The dog…Troy? He had a scar on his forehead that looked painful. The hog was named…Daryl. Yeah, he remembered applying for the job and being cat-called by him. He seemed fatter in his memories. Fat guys weren’t his thing, but the hog wasn’t just fat anymore, he now had some thick muscles, mostly in his arms. Even his face had changed since the last time he’d seen him, younger somehow, kinda….hot?<br />
<br />
He shook his head. So what? The light in the warehouse was on, so he let himself in. <br />
<br />
The owner, Tex, was busy hauling some boxes out to a panel truck. Todd looked around. He could see a few of the items looking to be shipped. Todd wanted to know how they were manufactured, but there didn’t seem to be any machinery here, just product testing and schematics.<br />
<br />
Tex was still loading boxes. He had time. He searched the tables and saw a big, leather-bound book on one near the back. The Book of Transfiguration. It had an embossed cover and Todd reached out to trace it.<br />
<br />
Memories trickled in. Warmth ran down his face and he tasted copper. Strangely, though, the memories weren’t revelationary. He had come here to get changed into an anthro wolf, after all. What did occur to him was that he’d only arrived in town for a few days, not the week and a half as he’d thought.<br />
<br />
“Todd?” Tex’s voice boomed. “Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
Todd looked up at the enormous bull man. “I-uh-the Book-.”<br />
<br />
Tex stared. “Are you…upset?”<br />
<br />
Todd shook his head. “No. Now I understand what Troy had meant.”<br />
<br />
“Is your life the way you wanted it?” Tex asked. “I can change it if you want.”<br />
<br />
Todd shook his head. “No! I love product testing with Mark.”<br />
<br />
Tex rubbed his chin. “We’re going to LA soon. Do you mind coming along? We’re going to try to make our products mainstream. We need a product tester to sell them.”<br />
<br />
“Sales?” Todd frowned. “I mean, I can do that. Worked for Averzombie and Ditch in college. Had to up-sell.”<br />
<br />
“Great!” Tex slapped him on the back. “Flight leaves in two days. We were going to leave earlier but Troy caught Ligma.”<br />
<br />
“What’s Ligma?”<br />
<br />
“...Go home.” Tex smirked. “We’ll call.”<br />
<br />
Todd left, slightly dazed. So it was all really magical. That…that gave him some ideas. He’d ask Mark to make suggestions later.</p>
