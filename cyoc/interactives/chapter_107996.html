<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Immediately the ring began to glow as Katie said her wish. As the warmth began in her body, Katie felt her swimsuit shifting and becoming smaller on a steadily growing body. Her arms and legs came first, growing out, long and gangly like the legs of a colt. Her fingers and toes became thinner, more distinct and dainty as the nails themselves became painted pink polish.The coltish appearance stopped there though as she experienced something strange. Her hips began to push out, just a little bit at a time, gaining a slight curve. At the same time her flat tanktop would begin to swell with the growth of two small mounds beneath it. As Katie passed 12, she could feel another growth spurt coming as her height jumped to three to four inches. But she could see other changes on her body that takes her straight to womanhood. The small mounds on her chest started to grow as they look like pointy cones. Katie saw them sticking out and could feel her hormones ramping up as the nipples started to look erect. Her hips started to flare up a bit and were gaining a bit of curves around her waist. She flinged a few blonde strands back as her hair slowly grew down her neck. Looking down at her feet, she could see her worn out sneakers looking new again and adjusted size to fit her growing feet. The thirteen-year-old was enjoying this as she was starting to grow out into her teen years. She could feel her body growing again as she could feel another growth spurt happening, shooting up another couple of inches. Her body then continued to mature further as her cones upgraded to size A cups, small but round. She could feel her hips expanding as her waist gotten a little curvier then normal. Tracing her finger to her hourglass, she was amazed at how shapely she’s becoming. She then spotted her fingernails and noticed that they were extending while her hands grew big and dainty. She could even see the nail polish on her nails as the pink began to sparkle. She looked at the polish as the sparkle reflected on the shine, feeling amazed by it all. Her hair started to grow longer as it brushed past her shoulders and was getting brighter by the second. Her floral print shirt shifted to match her body as it changed into something more mature at the floral designed faded and replaced with a navy blue color. Her sneakers shifted a little more as the laces vanished and the top opened up a little, turning into teenage flip-flops. Katie watches it all as the 14-year-old stretched a little, enjoying her changes bit by bit. She now felt her body growing more pronounced as she raced through the teen years. Her growth spurt got to a couple of more inches and she could feel like she was rising on the elevator. Her chest started to feel heavy as she looks down to see the mounds growing bigger and looking like AAs. Hips widening and curving as she had the hourglass of a young teen. Katie crossed her legs as she could feel them growing longer and shapelier, letting her free foot dangling as she moved her dainty foot to the beat as she looked to her hand to see it changing shape with fingers getting thinner and longer and her nails extending further. Katie decided to look at a nearby mirror and see if the face has changed much. So far, she could see it maturing more, as her cheeks look less puffy, her nose thinning to a sleeker shape, lips puffy a little bit, and her eyes and ears growing smaller. Starring at herself, she was starting to look like such a beauty. Just as she was looking at herself, she could feel a little discomfort in her mouth. Opening her mouth, she noticed braces appearing on her teeth. Katie was surprised by that and wondered how that got there. That’s when she remembered her memories altering. She remembered that she needed braces to help straighten her teeth. That could explain why she had them in the first place. She then noticed the skin on his face as saw a little dot on the cheek. Was that a pimple? She heard of teen girls getting them, but she never thought it was possible for her. Guess it was a price to pay when growing up. Katie could feel another tingle as she grew another couple of inches, reaching four. Her maturing body continued its crossover through adulthood as she could see her body shaping very finely. Her breasts expanded a little more, shaping into a pair of perky B cup breasts. Her hips and waistline curved up some more, as the hourglass shape was looking well defined. Her face matures even more as her freckles faded out of existence, replaced with multiple pimples spread throughout most of her face. Her hair was now at her upper back. Katie could also feel her clothes shifting again to help accommodate her aging body. It darkened to solid black and started to look a little bit skimpy with her cleavage starting show. Same goes for her flip-flops as they opened up more and turned into just straps, leaving her with regular style sandals. Katie looked to her sweet sixteen self and could tell that she was a little bit ugly. But she knows that it’s a matter of time before she has a beautiful face. Tingling again, Katie could feel herself growing into a teen of seventeen. She’s inching closer to the five-foot mark and was near the adult size. She took a deep breath as she her body matured into a young adult status. Breasts now grew to BB and his hips flared more and more, getting curvier by the second.  She could feel her face maturing more and more as her cheekbones were looking a little high and there were fewer pimples dotting her face, leaving most of the skin really smooth. Other changes of her face took place with her eyes getting smaller, nose thinning and getting longer, and lips getting a bit puffy. Her hair lower down her upper back and was reaching midway through. She crossed her legs very womanly and could feel her body language changed, and the sandals was growing a cork in the bottom heel and extending to four inches, looking as if it matches her clothing. Sensing another tingling coming, she sat back and felt her body growing a little more until it went past the five-foot mark. The last of her body matured one last time, making her look like a young woman then a kid at ten. Her breasts stopped growing and were now a pair of bouncy C cups while the last of her hips expand and was extremely curvy. All the remaining pimples on her face disappeared as well, leaving it smooth and flawless. She could even feel her braces magically removed from her teeth as she opened her mouth partly to reveal her teeth looking all evened out and pearly white. Along the way, she could see no trace of her childish innocent anywhere. Instead it was a complete beauty with lips to kiss, sultry eyes, and an elegant nose. Her hair grew longer and was at the middle of her back. Her outfit shifted a little bit and was looking more scantily, yet moderate. Katie never thought that teens could wear something like that. She could even feel her sandals shifting a little, as the heel was getting a little higher. Looking down, she now had heels like her former mothers and looking a little elegant. The eighteen-year-old looked to herself and was glad that she looked beautiful compared to the pimples and braces that she had on. She felt hersepf continue to mature to 25, but the changes were slight. Turning back to her former mother, she saw not a copy of her, as she expected, but a little ten year old girl in complete and total shock.</p>
