<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">And did she dance.  She moved in such seductive motions and struck seductive poses, playing upon Kyle's male urges.  In fact, as soon as she had begun to dance, even though no clothes had come off, Kyle's cock sprang back to attention, becoming fully erect for all to see.  Liz leaned over to Jennifer and asked, &quot;What did that feel like?  He's only 15!&quot;  Jennifer smiled and, not taking her eyes off what was happening, said, &quot;It felt great.  Age doesn't matter with a cock like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trish got more into her dance.  She struggled somewhat, as it was hard to really move around without any music playing.  It was also hard because her cheering outfit wasn't really meant for stripping out of easily.  But she gradually became comfortable with it.  She constantly ran her hands up and down her body, squeezing her breasts, sucking on her finger, the things you normally saw a stripper do on stage.  She reached down to the ground and untied her shoes.  She lifted her heels out of them, turned and kicked them off into the hallway leading to the kitchen.  <br />
<br />
Kyle sensed that something had changed.  He felt something trickle down his leg.  He looked down to see a small pile of hair on the floor.  The slight amount of leg, arm, chest, and pubic hair had all fallen from his skin.  Liz commented, &quot;Looks like we'll have something in common, Kyle.&quot;  Trish kind of stopped stripping until she saw that Kyle's eyes were back on her.  For if he didn't see hear take something off, he wouldn't continue to change.  She kept herself bent over, and tugged the socks from her feet.  Kyle felt a tickle on his neck and shoulders, and turned his head slightly to see that his hair was spewing downward, becoming rather curly and changing in color from dark brown to strawberry blonde.  Eventually it stopped in the middle of his back, now showing a deep color of sensual beauty.<br />
<br />
Trish continued to dance, but still found it somewhat difficult.  Not only did she not have any musical stimulus, now she had to worry about slipping on the hardwood floor.  So she kept it simple, not doing much more than fondling herself and gyrating her hips.  Her hands found the bottom of her cheering top, and slowly, with an impish grin, began pulling it up.  Slowly it uncovered her breasts, still held back by a bra that didn’t leave much to the imagination.  She lifted it over her head, and took it off, throwing it onto the floor.  Kyle kept her eyes on Trish this time.  He never looked to see that his fingernails lengthened an eighth of an inch over his fingertips.  He didn’t need to either, as he could feel them growing.  What he did not see, and could not feel was that both his fingernails and toenails turned purple in color, abandoning the tan look they had possessed.<br />
<br />
Trish looked over at Jennifer who seemed to have a slightly impatient look on her face.  Then she saw a clock that said it was 4:30.  They did need to hurry.  Trish stopped to put on any kind of dance, and just moved her body back and forth.  She quickly reached under her skirt and slipped her thong off her waist.  She pulled it down to her feet, stepped out of it with her left, and with her right kicked it directly at Kyle.  His reflexes caused him to reach his hand up and catch it before it could hit his face.  Now he saw the color of his nails.  He also saw his hands becoming slimmer.  The fingers thinned, becoming delicate to match his nails.  He also watched his hands shrink in size.  To make sure he was seeing that correctly, he grabbed his erect member, and could see his fingers taking up less area as his hands shrunk.<br />
<br />
Just then a whistle caught his attention.  It came from Trish’s lips, a signal that she was ready to go on.  After all, it might be disastrous if Kyle missed a piece of clothing being shed.  Trish turned around so her back was facing him.  She then cocked her head back in his direction, looking over her shoulder at him.  She flashed another devilish grin as her hands moved to the top of her skirt and took a hold of hit.  She bent over, removing her skirt from her body as she did.  Kyle was given a full view of Trish’s full moon.  One look at her nice, round ass made Kyle want to start beating it off right there.  But he remembered that he wouldn’t soon possess that urge, so he restrained himself.  Trish finished pulling the skirt down her legs to the ground, leaving it where it hit.  <br />
<br />
Kyle couldn’t take his eyes off her ass.  Once again he would miss a part of his body changing, as his arms thinned to feminine proportions.  They also decreased slightly in length, taking on a more feminine shape in that respect.  Trish kept wearing that grin of hers, still turned around, as now her hands reached up to her back.  They found the clasps of her bra, and she quickly unfastened it.  She slowly turned around, exposing her naked pussy to him for the first time.  She, like Jennifer, kept hers well manicured.  Unlike Jennifer, though, she only kept it from growing off her skin.  She let it grow over a larger area than the one thin line Jennifer shaved hers to.  She slipped the bra straps off her shoulders slowly and removed her hands from them.  Amazingly though, her bra was propped up by her generously large breasts.  In one quick movement she moved her right arm in a big circle in front of her, grabbing her bra and tearing it off on the way down, exposing her massive mammaries to the cool air of the room.<br />
<br />
Kyle felt like he was going to shoot his load in midair.  Trish didn’t give him the chance too.  She darted the five feet to wear he was standing and took his cock in her mouth.  It only took about ten seconds of Trish blowing him until he did shoot his load.  Jennifer liked to joke that Trish was a cock fiend, and she was certainly doing nothing to live that down right now.  Liz and Jamie glanced at Jennifer, who gave them an “I told you so” look in return. <br />
<br />
What Kyle and Trish did notice though was the change in his legs.  They too, like his arms, thinned out.  He also lost some of his height, from 5’10” to 5’8” because his legs shrank in size.  They took on a look that would be described as fit and tones for a female, while they had been fairly nondescript for a male.  By the time his legs finished changing, Trish pulled her mouth from his cock.  He finally felt some release as his member hung loose and flaccid between his legs.  With a moment to pause, he noticed the changes in his legs and arms.  Trish stood up and said, “You’re going to have a nice set of legs to complement your leg.”  He ran his hands over them and was impressed by how they felt.  “Thanks,” he said.  She started to walk back to the couch, but he touched her on the shoulder.  He had a simple request.  “Can I just grab your ass once?”  Trish smiled sweetly.  She always prided herself on the fact that she was voted as having the best ass in the school.  She didn’t mind at all.  In fact, she placed herself in front of him, bent over and said, “Why don’t you use both hands?”  He did, firmly planting and then squeezing his feminine hands on her plump ass.  He began to knead them, liking the feel of her skin between his fingers.  She started to get turned on by it too.<br />
<br />
Jennifer cleared her throat loudly and commanded, “That’s enough, both of you.  We need to keep this moving.”  Trish made a sound of disapproval.  She stood straight up, gave Kyle a quick kiss on the lips and returned to the couch.  “You’re up, Liz,” she said as she approached.  Liz got up and Trish took her seat.  Kyle turned his attention to Liz.  Satisfied his eyes were on her, she yelled, “Round Two!” and began to tease.</p>
