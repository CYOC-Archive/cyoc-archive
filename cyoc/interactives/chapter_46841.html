<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She began to think of the times her lovers had left her a mess. How many times had the spent musk of love-making enveloped her and how many times a satisfied lover simply rolled over and went to sleep as she and the bedding slowing absorbed the messy consequences of the act. There was no need to feel sentimental toward Todd, or misty-eyed at his unfortunate slip from his warm existence within her. He was sperm now,  that was all. And she had so much sperm before. Her body was simply doing what it had always done, letting gravity take its course as the glob began to melt from the warmth of her insides. In a few minutes Todd was beginning to form into a pearly teardrop at the bottom of her labial folds. This didn't bother her at all.  She felt no pangs of remorse as she watched him pool there. &quot;Just let nature take its course, Toddy. You're not afraid, are you?&quot; <br />
   She knew the conversation was strictly one sided. He was being retroactively aborted, and she was becoming rather amused that his very existence was predicated on the moodiness of her two fully engorged and very wet labia. A pinch of her anal muscles, or a little more vaginal wetness, or an untimely erotic shudder would have been enough to spill what was left of Todd into a white stain on the library carpet. &quot;What am I going to do with now you, babycakes before you  make a mess of me.&quot; She wondered somewhat wistfully if she had not willed him to be at her mercy by unconsciously regressing him too far.  Did she mean to turn him into seed to hurt him, to humilate him in a way that would be worse than death itself? There was very little left of him now. Was she such an evil girl?  Was that why she tingled with joy and fascination as Todd's erotic execution progressed? Was it her or was her physical body that was committing this evil?  Why did it feel so wonderful?<br />
  There was making a baby out of him now,  that was for sure. When she moved for a better view of what he had become she notice the bead of semen was now only a teardrop of semen poised on the pelvic ridge above her perineum. He was caught in the labial crease  above her ass. &quot;I was it wasn’t going to be messy, honey,&quot; she smiled at the irony of her own remark. &quot;It would be very inconvenient to have to wipe myself here since I don't have a wash cloth.&quot; She knew she'd have to finish him off herself if she didn't want more of a mess. That was why what she did next  what she did.<br />
  She took her finger and collected the little white pearl. She brought the little bead of semen closer, then turned the drop over to delight in her “uncreation.” Pinching the little bead of semen closely between index finger and thumb, she smiled as she held it up to the light and began to stretch the wad of goo between her pretty little fingers. It thinned into a sticky string. This was all Todd was now, a milky white thread of man jack,  a woman’s  plaything  The fragrance of the cum was intoxicating. It reminded her of other times and other men she had enjoyed, but never in this way. Her domination of him was almost complete. Her heart raced. She felt her breast swell and her nipples harden. Her labia engorged with blood as she prepared to realize her utter triumph over him. What was left? Was she really going to do it?  Was she really going to dispatch the gooey remnants of his little life in so cruel and heartless a fashion? He was once a fully grown man, so proud, so independent.  What was he now? A little gum drop for her pleasure, that's all. She did not want to leave any incriminating evidence behind, especially Todd's DNA, that was for certain. &quot;Might as well enjoy what’s left of you,&quot; she sighed, and then smiled, &quot;I don't need to be the next Monia Lewisky.&quot; <br />
     She contemplated his fate. Her other hand now played with her clitoris.  The scent of fresh semen and her fingers running over her own slick bulb brought her closer and closer to climax. It was just a matter of time now, but she knew it was her time to play and Todd’s time to  die….<br />
    &quot;Hmmmm Todd,you smell like man chowder.&quot; She toyed with the semen by stretching the glob even further, then contracting it, then stretching it. She was fascinated by the extent of her power over the pathetic little thing, once a man. She smiled wickedly. &quot;You sure look like man chowder...&quot; she paused. &quot;But Baby how do I know you're my  Toddy without a little test? And there's only one way to tell.&quot;<br />
    She contemplated the sticky goo with evil curiousity.<br />
&quot;Do you taste like man chowder, little one?&quot; She smiled.  She spread her legs wider and with her other hand spreading the slickened labia while her finger quickly rode her rosy bud. &quot;Shall we see?&quot; She was breathing heavily. &quot;I think we should see, don't you?&quot;  Her back arched. She smiled and moistened her now dry lips.  They parted. Two rows of beautiful white teeth flashed. She playfully bit her tongue. &quot;I thought you should know, my little one,&quot; she caught herself, wanting to explain. &quot;How should I say this. . &quot; . Then she stopped and addressed the Todd the tiny seed directly, with a new intensity. There was something wickedly dark in her brown eyes now that hadn't been there before. She lifted him closer to her mouth and narrowed her gaze on the tiny droplet. She now regarded the  sticky string of baby batter with a new found contempt. &quot;I... am... not... a... spitter.&quot;<br />
    Toddy was going bye-bye.  She would have liked to have terrified him, but he was nothing, really. Her tongue was going to make short work of him anyway. She licked the creamy jism  greedily between the two stretched fingers, lapping it and pulling it into her mouth. She twisted the index finger onto the tongue now full of seed, the goo running behind her lower front teeth and onto her taste buds. The lips closed. He was hers forever.<br />
     Her eyes brightened as the little cumlet dissolved  where she tasted. &quot;Ummmmmmm.&quot; She was shocked. Her little sperm sample began to meet her sensory bulbs. Toddy carried a taste that was much different than she had expected. He was delicious, and so complex. The musk of the ball sack was still there, of course, but there was a salty yet tangy delicacy to him she couldn't quite compare to anything else. She savored his conception juice slowly. It was very complex, on many different levels. Yes, she thought, it's like kissing the inside of his soul. So, so precious, so delicate. She thought, &quot;yes it is the inside of his soul....&quot; Her finger forced her to climax just as she was tasting all of aspects and ages of Todd at once--man, boy and baby-- and it was the most unbelievable sampling of sperm she had ever experienced. Her salivary glands pumped out more enzymes and the ejaculate began to slowly dissolve into a pool of saliva. Sadly, the taste of little Toddy began to fade. But he is delicious, she thought. For all the trouble he caused he gave her one last moment with him to treasure. For that she loved him. What to do now? She blinked and swallowed what little trace of him was left. Little Toddy was gone once and for all.<br />
   For a moment she was speechless, then a smile of delight lit her face, or was it the afterglow of orgasm. The protein that was Little Toddy was soon in Carrie's stomach.  She knew he wouldn't last long in that state. Even so, his little life wasn't wasted. &quot;When I taste any man's seed again, I will always think of you, my little baby, and of this night, when you and I became one.&quot; Carrie pulled up his panties, smoothed out the wrinkled of her dress and left the library.</p>
