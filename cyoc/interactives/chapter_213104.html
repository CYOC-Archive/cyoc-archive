<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a lovely breakfast that was premade for them, the boys went to hit the gym as they had planned beforehand. Both of them were shirtless and only wearing a pair of workout shorts. The two claimed that there were doing this because they didn&#39;t have any shirts that would fit their new bodies anymore, but in reality, they were doing this for vanity reasons. But who could blame them? Who wouldn&#39;t want to show off their hot new bods that they had obtained overnight?<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s get pumped! Or at least, that&#39;s what I think the jocks would say.&quot; Huh, it seemed like Rod was trying to emulate the jocks at his school. It was a rather cute gesture that made Edgar chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s get pumped!&quot; Edgar responded, &quot;But try not to go overboard. The last thing you want is to get hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rod nodded. Man, Edgar really was so well put together, he thought. Guess that&#39;s what happened when you were raised to take over the family company. Anyway, the two entered the gym and split off to do their own things. Rod went to the free weights to work on his arms, while Edgar went to the weight bench. Hmmm, Edgar didn&#39;t want to ask Rod to spot him so Bench Press was out, but flies were safe enough to do. <br />
<br />
Edgar grabbed a pair of 30-pound dumbells and began lifting just like he had learned in gym class. Though, to his surprise, the weight was too light for him. Looks like his older body was stronger than he thought, so he grabbed a pair of 45s, which was a more appropriate weight for his current strength level. One set later, Edgar was wiping the sweat off his brow, feeling good and accomplished.<br />
<br />
While he was resting, Edgar looked over to see Rod still working on his arms. The rich teen found himself staring at Rod again. The way the sweat sheened over his new and pumped muscles. The puberthere really was kind to him... Uh, perhaps Edgar should get back to his reps.<br />
<br />
The cycle continued for the rest of the workout session. Edgar finishes some sets and then takes some lustful glances at Rod. The point where the situation boiled over was when Rod was finished lifting and began to flex in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah! Look at that pump! Man, I never thought I would be this strong, this... hot.&quot; Hot Rod was, as while he was flexing, Edgar found himself staring at the muscular teen once again. The way the sweat glistened over Rod&#39;s muscular body, Edgar could practically feel his inhibitions getting stripped away. Eventually, he couldn&#39;t help himself. The rich teen went up and embraced Rod from behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;E-Edgar? W-what are you doing?&quot; Rod studdered. He didn&#39;t figure Edgar as the affectionate type. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I just couldn&#39;t help myself. You said it yourself, you&#39;re hot now. And I was just wondering if you wanted to... Well, explore our bodies a bit more thoroughly together.&quot; It was taking all of Edgar&#39;s willpower not to move his hands lower. He was so curious about how those pecs would feel.<br />
<br />
Rod was surprised at what he was hearing. He didn&#39;t realize that Edgar swung that way. He lingered in Edgar&#39;s arms for a bit. It just felt right being in them, but still, Rod eventually pushed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;S-sorry, it&#39;s not that I wouldn&#39;t like that. I-it&#39;s just that I want to use the device to get rid of the rest of my belly first.&quot; Rod thought that Edgar would be angry with that answer, but to his relief, Edgar seemed to understand.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see. Well, the most important thing is that you are comfortable with this. But I&#39;ll say this, I&#39;m not above thinking that a little fat takes away from your looks.&quot; Edgar paused after saying that. Seems like he was a bit embarrassed about being that forward, but he quickly recovered. &quot;Anyway, I guess I&#39;ll just have to ask you again tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;U-Uh... Yeah.&quot; Did that really just happen? Rod asked himself. Was this real life? &quot;I-I guess it&#39;s time to shower. I&#39;ll go first!&quot; Rod was going to need a cold shower after all that.<br />
<br />
The rest of the day was uneventful. The two didn&#39;t want to go out since they wanted to save the reveal of their new age and bodies at school for maximum shock factor to drum up interest. So, the boys bided their time with mundane things like video games, and homework. Although both of them couldn&#39;t help but notice the air of sexual tension that loomed over them.<br />
<br />
Soon enough, night have fallen and the two teens had set the Puberthere on the same settings. They concluded that one more night in the same setting would bring them to their ideal ages and bodies. Older, but not old enough to look out of place at a high school. They were about to sleep when Edgar got a phone call.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I should take this,&quot; Edgar said as he went into the hallway to take the call. Even though it was none of his business, Rod wondered who was calling Edgar at this time of night. It could be just his parents, or perhaps a client that wanted to use the Puberthere for themselves.</p>
