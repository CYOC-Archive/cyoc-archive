<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah followed the Great River with Chatok and Aminu in tow. He saw Ruut waving at him and Maa&#39;ti next to him. He would see Maati after he was done with his work. <br />
<br />
Sarah saw that Maa&#39;ti look startled while looking in her direction. Sarah knew that she had changed, but was it really that much? Sarah didn&#39;t want to consider it, so she focused on processing what was left of the kill while crouching low - the low working stance common among the tribes hunters. Her height hadn&#39;t changed much since she hadn&#39;t been much taller when she was as girl, but she knew that a boy her current size will likely be quite large, and broad. She struggled not to be proud of that fact.<br />
<br />
Sarah was distressed to know her breasts were gone - she had the flat chest of a teen boy. Where once was fat was lean muscle. Her arms were different too. She felt a strength that she didn&#39;t have before. She felt her body losing its softness. Her legs lost their silkiness becoming more suited to a teen-aged male. Her legs started to itch - she denied it, but deep down she knew it meant that she was sprouting leg hair. What Sarah didn&#39;t was her skin darkenening to match the tribe, nor did she the hair on her head become her new peoples dark brown brown - her dirty blond coloring faded away.<br />
<br />
Sarah finished her work, and stood to deliver the spoils. Her path took her near the banks of The Great River. Sarah felt her eyes being drawn further down the river, where the women of the tribe were just finishing their evening bath. She found that she couldn&#39;t look away from the girls, one in particular drew her interest. A stunning girl with colorfully decorated braids. Her brightly-colored beads glittered in the evening sunlight, her damp braids framing her gentle face perfectly. Sarah couldn&#39;t resist stretching her arms in the air to give her a show. <br />
<br />
Sarah had never found herself looking at another girl like this, but every so often their brown eyes locked and an awkward smile passed between them. Her smile sent a chill down Sarah’s spine and gave her an alien feeling between her legs.<br />
<br />
Disturbed, Sarah looked for Maa&#39;ti. She couldn&#39;t see the little girl anywhere. Sarah felt a pit in her stomach; Was she too late? She heard Aminu saying, &quot;Those girls are attractive aren&#39;t they?&quot; Chatok muttered, &quot;She&#39;s too old for me, besides I&#39;m not interested. Saa&#39;rok can have her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah averted her, eyes attempting to ignore them, and crouched at the riverside alongside Chatok to wash herself. She washed her arms, and saw the changes. The once light skin now had the same dark pigmentation as the rest of the tribe. She washed her face and felt its shape with her rough hands - her once thin nose was now broad, both her eyes a different shape, and he mouth had wider lips. She could no longer imagine herself as the white girl she was. <br />
<br />
In fact, the thought of having light skin made her insides squirm. She now understood intimately the pride her black tribe(class)mates had shown in their heritage. It made her feel ashamed of her past behavior. Now she suspected she was in the distant past among their forefathers, the boy she was becoming might even be one of their ancestors. Even if she could go back to being a girl, she wasn&#39;t sure   <br />
she wanted to lose her wonderful dark skin even with the very real discrimination that existed in her world.<br />
<br />
Her thoughts were interrupted by Nequi, &quot;Deep thoughts, son?&quot; he asked. Sarah could feel herself slipping into Saa&#39;rok mindset in the presence of his father. Saa&#39;rok answered, &quot;No, father I was distracted.&quot; Nequi&#39;s eyes gleamed with humor. &quot;Perhaps you were looking at the girls, or one in particular?&quot; Saa&#39;rok looked embarrassed and stammered, &quot;N-no, I was...&quot; Nequi placed his broad hands on his son&#39;s back, &quot;My son do not be embarrassed you are becoming a man. It is only natural you would take interest in the women, but be careful my son, Maa&#39;ti is betrothed to Chatok it would be unwise to pursue her.&quot; Surprise caused Sarah  to surface; Why was he talking about Maa&#39;ti? It dawned on her that the teen girl was Maa&#39;ti. Chatok&#39;s comment should have been obvious. What happened? Nequi stood and said, &quot;Now, I will leave you to your thoughts. I will await you at the tribe&#39;s feast.&quot; Sarah shuddered, she had seemlessly became Saa&#39;rok. Most disturbingly she could feel a yearning in her soul to be Saa&#39;rok. <br />
<br />
She once again looked at Maa&#39;ti hoping to feel anything other than attraction. Sarah was absolutely smitten. She only felt desire. She once again felt that odd tingle, but it was soon joined by a pleasant warmth. Sarah let out a quiet grunt at the feeling, which grew more intense with each passing moment. Her loins had hardened and stood at attention. She was forced to adjust the posture of her crouch to let her legs spread a bit wider. The pouch in the front of her loincloth bulged outward slightly showing her arousal followed by a gentle weight that settled down into it. Sarah felt an itch and reached down to scratch just under her loincloth, feeling where a new layer of wiry hairs had sprouted. Unbidden, she felt pride that she was growing into a man.<br />
<br />
Sarah knew it was her last chance to talk to Maa&#39;ti. If she failed she would be would be Saa&#39;rok forever. Sarah paused, she? No, It was wrong, all wrong. He? Him? Yes, that sounded much better. Sarah&#39;s eyes widened realized he no longer could deny his masculinity. This body was comfortable, as if he was born into it. His genitals were no longer unfamiliar. <br />
<br />
He found Maa&#39;ti at the rivers edge. She was once again bickering with Ruut as usual. The boy always wanted to get a rise out of her like an annoying sibling. Sarah called out her, &quot;Maa&#39;ti, I must speak to you.&quot; Maa&#39;ti&#39;s smiled brightly, and his stomach fluttered. Sarah remembered Saa&#39;rok thinking she was beautiful, and that he adored her. He had always liked the girl, but never mustered the courage to express his feelings. Maa&#39;ti had recently confessed while blushing profusely that she wanted to be with  him. They knew that they might never be married, but they couldn&#39;t help it. It was the only time he disregarded his duties. Watching her, Sarah knew that Maa&#39;ti accepted her rebirth. If she asked him to become Saa&#39;rok for here, he would.  <br />
<br />
He asked hesistently, &quot;Maa&#39;ti, how did you know who you were?&quot; Maa&#39;ti whispered reverently, &quot;The Goddess came to me. She gave me what I wanted. She gave the chance to be with you.&quot; She grasped his face, her eyes full of passion. &quot;Look Around, love. They are our people.&quot; Sarah felt Maa&#39;ti&#39;s words resonate. &quot;This is our tribe. We speak the same tongue. Share the same culture. We have the same wonderful dark skin. We have a place here. We are a part of this. If that doesn&#39;t sway you then consider how I feel about you. I wanted you.&quot; Maa&#39;ti smiled mischievously, and said, &quot;I saw you looking at me. I know you liked what you saw, and your becoming a strong, handsome man. Sarah wavered as Maa&#39;ti spoke of their people, and her desire appealed to his masculinity and made him feel like preening. Maa&#39;ti didn&#39;t give him the chance to think when she pulled him into a passionate kiss. <br />
<br />
Sarah closed his eyes, and let Saa&#39;rok in. After their kiss, Saa&#39;rok smiled lovingly at Maa&#39;ti, &quot;Thank you, Maa&#39;ti. You have a gift, surely The Goddess speaks through you.&quot; He turned to Ruut and said, &quot;You were right to help me, despite your impulsiveness. You gave me the chance to be with her.&quot; Ruut exclaimed childishly, &quot;See Maa&#39;ti I was right.&quot; Maa&#39;ti tickled Ruut causing him to squirm. &quot;You little brat,&quot; she exclaimed. Unfortunately, Chatok interrupted the moment, &quot;Maa&#39;ti, your mother is coming. You need to go. You can&#39;t be seen with Saa&#39;rok.&quot; Saa&#39;rok watched her go, enjoying the sway of her hips. She winked at him as she walked out of sight.  <br />
<br />
Saa&#39;rok smiled, everything felt right. Praise The Goddess and The Ancestors. Maybe tomorrow he&#39;d sneak away with Maa&#39;ti. As he walked toward the village center he saw his reflection in a water bowl, and was pleased with what he saw. His girl definitely was.</p>
