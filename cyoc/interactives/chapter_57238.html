<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How long would it take the fairies to make it back to the witches' manor?&quot; Lilly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A little while,&quot; Marie-Eliza said in a low voice, &quot;they couldn't just move instantaneously, and Titania still had to explain what she'd volunteered her people for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And they accepted?&quot; Betty asked.<br />
<br />
Marie nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the wounded at the witches manor?&quot; Alice wondered, &quot;would the fairies help them, since I would assume that Azrael could not perform a miracle like Jesus did in the New Testament.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They would try,&quot; Marie nodded, &quot;but remember that that would have to wait until the fairies made it to witch manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So the two that Katherine &quot;gutted&quot;... they died?&quot; Abbey asked fearfully. I mean... don't people need them?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie slowly nodded, &quot;those two Leomen females were to far gone for the medicine of the time to really help, which under his guise of a doctor, Azrael was limited to using. Modern medicine might have saved them, but that is the difference of three hundred years of technological and medical progress...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And antibiotics,&quot; Lawrence commented, &quot;If Katherine's spear had only cut the skin open and the internal organs were left alone, the two lionesses would be more at risk from infection then from the actual wounds inflicted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie nodded, &quot;as I said, the results of the battle stopped the witches from destroying the world through their plans of turning everyone into children, but it was not an &quot;everything is all better&quot; solution. The laws of reality wouldn't have allowed that... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And if Marie knew her abilities and could use them, and then tried to use them... she would have been cheating,&quot; Eliza added with a sigh, &quot;sometimes one must take harder path to take.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
1689<br />
<br />
Marie sighed as she and Katherine pulled away.<br />
<br />
&quot;This will likely be my last real battle,&quot; Marie said slowly, &quot;unless the Council sends some change of mission across the Atlantic, and that isn't likely.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn't hurt my guilt anyway,&quot; Katherine sighed, &quot;and I can understand that they might have killed me otherwise... but it still doesn't sit right with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie hugged her again, &quot;I know. I know. You can always talk to me if you need help.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahem,&quot; came Linus's voice from nearby.<br />
<br />
They turned to face him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think you're insane for defending them after all they've done,&quot; Linus spoke...<br />
<br />
&quot;It's to be fair to them, Linus,&quot; Marie said firmly, &quot;it changes nothing in regards to what they deserve or what I think they deserve. This can not be a show trial where the prosecution presents whimsical evidence that wouldn't convict anyone, if the court functioned properly, and the prisoner is found guilty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I suppose that it very noble of you,&quot; Linus answered, &quot;but they are guilty, and we have all suffered at their hands. If that female gargoyle dies, Vatican will be incapable of defending anyone. I've lost my hands. Katherine is trying to cope with the realities of combat. And you've lost what you have admitted could have been friends, all because they decided they were the masters of this world. I do not know what Draco has lost, but I'm sure he has lost something...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But we aren't an army,&quot; Marie countered, &quot;I may have been trained since childhood to fight the supernatural. You may have been a soldier... but we aren't an army. If my superiors new of this, I'd be facing execution. And you've even said that you've partially ignored yours... we are in no position to claim killing them as a spoil of war.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus slowly nodded, &quot;Doesn't mean they are guilty. And I will prove it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be the prosecutor?&quot; Marie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Linus nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let us work for justice, and let justice be fair,&quot; Marie put a hand on Linus's shoulder, &quot;they have a journal in their room, and the girl they've been defending, her name is Joella, has a roster of the people in the witches care. That is in her room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Linus looked at her strangely. Marie, meanwhile turned to Katherine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katherine, can you help him?&quot; Marie asked, &quot;I'm afraid Linus will need someone to be an extra set of hands for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Katherine said slowly, placing her rosary around her neck.<br />
<br />
She began to follow Linus when Marie stopped them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You may NEED your spear, Katherine,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;Herodias and Lilith are guarding the women the witches gathered. Running-Bear's pendants should stop them from using magic, just in case they're able to cast spells the way the child familiars could.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Herodias and Lilith?&quot; Katherine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Golgotha's black cat and Gaal's tropical red boa,&quot; Marie explained, &quot;and since we don't know how the house is laid out, or where the women here are hiding, it can't hurt to be prepared.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katherine slowly sighed and went to retrieve the weapon she had earlier discarded. She hoped that this would all end and she could burn the wretched thing.<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
After their meeting with Titania, Rosa, Mal'akh, and Monica slowly made their way toward the praying town. They still had to report to Vatican that Marie had been successful in defeating the witches. Mal'akh took the lead as she had been there before. As they went, they came across a lone Gold Deer buck. It looked at the two young Leoman females, snorted, and bounded away a great speed, like death itself was chasing him him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems very skittish,&quot; Rosa commented, &quot;a buck of that size with that rack of antlers would normally charge if suddenly confronted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cowardly deer?&quot; Monica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe he narrowly escaped being eaten by something when he was a fawn,&quot; Mal'akh shrugged, &quot;Come on.&quot;<br />
<br />
They found Vatican actually closer to Running-Bear's home then they had thought he would be. Free's &quot;unconscious&quot; form lay beside him. The male gargoyle noticed them arriving by the light reflecting off of Rosa and Mal'akh's eyes. Rosa was actually holding Monica's hand to insure that the human would have a guide through the darkening &quot;terrain&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have returned,&quot; Vatican said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Rosa nodded, &quot;we have learned the results of the battle, and have returned to inform you as we promised.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the witches?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Defeated, and awaiting trial,&quot; Rosa spoke, &quot;Marie has won.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
While Linus and Katherine went in search of the evidence that they would likely need to convict the witches, Marie returned to the room where Draco was guarding the witches themselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;You've surely angered Linus,&quot; Draco commented, &quot;I trust you haven't done anything foolish.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You heard that?&quot; Marie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We heard him,&quot; Draco answered, &quot;what set him off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How have they been?&quot; Marie asked, turning to the witches who all sat quietly, for the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Supremely confident that we will kill each other and they will be free,&quot; Draco answered, &quot;WHAT set Linus off?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly my mentioning where I will be in the trial,&quot; Marie answered.<br />
<br />
Draco was quiet for a moment, &quot;I do not like where this is going.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is to insure that things are done fairly,&quot; Marie answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that is?&quot; Draco answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll see in a minute,&quot; Marie sighed.<br />
<br />
Draco looked on puzzled as Maria approached Gaal, who was in the center of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Griselle, Gita, and Goldwyn, although formal charges haven't been stated officially yet,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;but know that you will be tried and will stand accused of crimes against the citizens of Glendale...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence Dog,&quot; Gaal gave a slight chuckle, &quot;you'd best save your strength for when your friends come to kill you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We may have our differences, but we will never come to physical blows against each other,&quot; Marie answered and then continued, &quot;in the interest of insuring that this trial is fair, you have the right to legal consul to represent you, and provide you with the advise you will need to avoid execution.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If it was fair, you'd let us go and free the world, now, not mess with a stupid trial of innocent people,&quot; Golgotha answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would not be fair to those that will see you as aggressors to them,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;and as your Consul, I would advise you, that if you wish avoid being executed, it will be in your own best interest to cooperate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU would defend us? After you were cruel and did deliberate harm to us?&quot; Gaal snarled.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the interest of insuring the trial is fair, yes,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;and what was done earlier was not something I liked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then WHY DID YOU DO IT!?&quot; Gaal roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it had to be done,&quot; Marie said simply, &quot;Now, if you want to live, I would suggest that you all begin to explain WHY you've done what you've done here. The &quot;what&quot; likely isn't debatable.&quot;</p>
