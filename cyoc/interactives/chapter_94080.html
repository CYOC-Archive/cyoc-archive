<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Katie while heading home, smiling as she looked at the magical ring around her finger, couldn&#39;t help but let out a small giggle as she remembered what she did to Mean boy Timmy. Just then Katie heard a familiar voice calling her name, causing her to turn her body around.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you get bigger?&quot; A boy asked her, appearing the same age she used to be.<br />
<br />
It took a moment for Katie to realize, but it was her friend Mike from school. Even though he was a boy, and she was a girl, gender was not an issue when it came to their friendship, because they lived close to each other, they often played together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mike, I have something really cool to show you!&quot; Katie smiled, &quot;Can I come over right now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, my older sister is the only one home right now so it should be okay...&quot; Mike answered back.<br />
<br />
The two quickly made it to his house, knocking on the door. It took a while but soon a young teenage girl answered the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I see you brought your girlfriend over today&quot; the teenage girl giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Eww she&#39;s not my girlfriend Suzy, she&#39;s just a friend!&quot; Mike retorted back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say squirt&quot; Suzy laughed as she rubbed her little brother&#39;s hair until he batted it away, letting the two though the door.<br />
<br />
Katie recalls that Suzy was a freshmen in High school this year, making her about 14-years-old. Suzy though, taking a look over at Katie, couldn&#39;t help but notice she looked a little bigger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Katie... did you get bigger?&quot; Suzy asked<br />
<br />
Katie didn&#39;t know how to reply, not wanting to expose the secret to Suzy just yet for now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids sure do grow fast huh&quot; Suzy justified, &quot;if only that was true for little Mikey here&quot; she giggled. &quot;Now hurry up and go play in your room, and try not to be too loud okay&quot; Suzy finished, before heading back into the living room, plopping on the sofa, and resuming her call with one of her friends she left on hold on her cell phone.<br />
<br />
The kids quickly went upstairs as they entered Mike&#39;s room. It was a normal room for a 7-year-old boy nothing out of the ordinary.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you want to show me?&quot; Mike said, closing the door behind him.<br />
<br />
Katie smiled as she lifted her hand reveling the ring around her finger. &quot;This&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... What about it?&quot; Mike answered back.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s magical, it can make people bigger or smaller&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way, you&#39;re such a liar&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nuh uhn, it&#39;s true and I can prove it&quot; Katie snarked back. Katie then quietly whispered to herself &quot;I wish I was a year older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike watched Katie, waiting for her to prove him wrong when he began to notice something. Katie feeling a familiar sensation sweep her body gasp as she felt herself expand once more as her body inched taller, limbs extending. Not only that but her mind began to fill again as she felt as smart as a 9-year-old would.<br />
<br />
Mike jaw dropped open as he couldn&#39;t believe his eyes. &quot;Woah! That was so cool!&quot; he burst in excitement.<br />
<br />
&quot;See, I told you I wasn&#39;t lying&quot; Katie grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can you make me bigger too?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but only because you&#39;re my friend okay.&quot; Katie then said to herself &quot;I wish Mike was a year older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike gasp as he felt a sudden sensation flush throughout his body, with a sudden gasp he felt himself rise a little in height, as he tiny body began to stretch. Not only that but just like Katie, information seemed to pour into his mind as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah&quot; Mike gasped again as his growth finished, making him 8-years-old. Taking a look over at Katie he couldn&#39;t help but see that he was still a few inches shorter than her. &quot;Even though we&#39;re the same age now, I&#39;m still shorter&quot; he said disappoint.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... not exactly, I actually made myself a year older before I saw you, so really your still a year younger than me but...&quot; Katie then made the wish to herself again &quot;I wish Mike was a year older.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike gasp as he grew again, quickly sprouting up a few inches once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now we&#39;re both 9-years-old&quot; Katie giggled.<br />
<br />
Mike smiled as he realized that now he was the same height as Katie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey how about we both continue to get older?&quot; Make suggested, not wanting to stop the feeling of the energy that was pumping throughout his body when he grew.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until how old?&quot; Katie asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... how about until we&#39;re the same age as my sister?&quot; Mike replied back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Katie smiled as she looked back at the ring, this time she made a wish so that they would both grow at the same time, saying to herself &quot;I wish we were both a year older.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two kids gasped as the sensation pulsed through their body, causing them to grow another year in age. The two kids began to groan a bit as they felt their clothes becoming a little tight on their 10-year-old body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Mike, do you have any bigger clothes we can wear? My clothes are going to rip if I don&#39;t take them off soon.&quot; Katie plead.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, I&#39;m going to see if I can find anything in my parent&#39;s room&quot; Mike responded before headed out.<br />
<br />
Katie took this time to look herself in the full body mirror Mike had in his room, she had grown a lot since this morning. Mike then reentered the room, tossing a shirt over to Katie while keeping one for himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got us a shirt from my mom and dad&#39;s room that we can wear for now&quot; Mike said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll hurry up and turn around a put your shirt on, and don&#39;t even think about looking over here.&quot; Katie demanded<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not like you have anything anyways&quot; Mike sneered back.<br />
<br />
The two quickly tossed and pulled their undersized shirts and pants off, but kept their tight underwear on though as they slipped the over-sized t-shirt over their body. The two now more comfortably dressed continued were they left off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we were both a year older&quot; Katie continued.<br />
<br />
The two groaned again as they body stretched taller harder and faster they passed into the double digit of age. Katie though let out a small gasp as she felt her 11-year-old nipple tickle, and knew what was about to come.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish we were both a year older&quot; Katie continued.<br />
<br />
The two now entered preteen as their body hit another growth spurt causing them to once more rise quickly in height. Katie once more let out another small gasp as she felt her chest thrust out a big, her once coney breast were quickly becoming A-cups.<br />
<br />
&quot;What wrong?&quot; Mike said, noticing his voice was getting much different.<br />
<br />
&quot;N-nothing&quot; Katie mumbled back, noticing her voice was changing as well.  &quot;Dang my clothes are all too small, i wonder if this thing can change them.&quot;</p>
