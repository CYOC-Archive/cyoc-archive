<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>Rachel finished the dishes quickly and moved onto vacuuming. She noticed the difference in her hair's length by now. It was just passing her butt and was headed down to her knees. Realizing that it could get in her way while cleaning, she gathered it up into a ponytail and tied it with a ribbon. It was so thick she had trouble keeping it all together as she tied the knot, but she was able to manage.
<P>She quickly vacuumed the carpets and put the machine away. Not much time had passed. Maybe fifteen minutes. But already the ribbon had migrated from near the top of her head to her neck. Her hair was knee-length now, and thicker than ever.
<P>Rachel moved into the bathroom, where she tried combing it and generally playing with it as it got longer and longer. Amazingly, the longer it grew, the faster it grew. In just a few more minutes it was brushing her ankles. She giggled at the way it tickled them. Then she saw it just starting to touch the floor. She moved out into the hallway to dance around in the open, feeling the sweeping hair following along with her, rubbing and slapping against her body as she twirled and skipped.
<P>The movements began to lag more and more as the hair grew. Soon Rachel had to stop moving so quickly because not only was she getting out of breath, but she kept stepping on her hair. By now several feet were trailing on the floor.
<P>She then started walking around the house. It felt so strange to feel the hair pull on her scalp as she dragged it. It was so heavy, but it felt really fun.
<P>Rachel found a measuring tape in a kitchen drawer, then walked in a straight line down the hall as she carefully let out the tape along the floor parallel to her hair. When she had gotten a completely straight trail of hair, she took a look at the measurements. Six feet were on the floor, and with it flowing straight up to her head, that was an extra five and a half feet. In just the few seconds she had taken to calculate it, she saw a little more of it starting to droop slowly to the floor. "Okay, so let's just say I've got twelve feet right now," she said to herself.
<P>She moved over to the hallway mirror just to see how the tresses looked on her. They flowed down her body like a perfect waterfall. There was so much of it on all sides she could practically cloak herself in the silky strands. She wasn't sure, but she felt that her body had changed minutely as well. Her breasts had started to push against her bra a little, and her shorts felt a little tight as well. She looked absolutely lovely.
<P>Giggling, she pulled thirteen feet of hair up the stairs and into her bedroom. She piled it all on her bed and spread out on it, rolling in it and draping it over her like a blanket. It was growing very fast now. She could even feel a tingle in her scalp from the overcharged follicles. She held a lock in her hands and watched it slowly pour into her palm. She pulled a group of it tightly away from her head and then watched it droop and sag until it hit the mattress. She fell onto her back and stretched out on the luxurious locks. Her shorts continued to feel tight, so she undid the button to ease the pressure. After a little while, she found herself drifting off to sleep.
<P>A pulling on her head awakened her. All around her, her hair was shifting. She hadn't even come fully back to her senses when she tumbled off the bed due to her flying hair. It danced in the air, covering her entire room in a frantic cloud. Rachel watched as it pulled itself into bunches. It formed three distinct, thick groupings. Those groups then began to twirl themselves together into the longest, thickest braid Rachel had ever seen. It took some time to completely form, as Rachel had a lot of hair, but when it finally reached the end, a red bow magically appeared on the tip to keep it together.
<P>Rachel sat on the carpet, dumbfounded. Was she still asleep? She pinched herself. No. She really did have a massive braid that formed itself before her own eyes.
<P>Standing up on shaky legs, she carefully grasped a segment of the braid in her hands. Her hair was clearly not growing anymore. The braid must have been the final step in the process. It was tightly formed. It was very pretty. It was perfect.
<P>She started to run out her door to get the measuring tape again, but found that her feet were too quick for the friction and the sheer weight of her braid. She tried gathering it up by looping it around her arm. It was incredibly heavy when she finally got it all.
<P>She slowly walked downstairs, then gently laid the braid along the hallway. The braid was barely long enough to fit straight down the hallway, though a few feet were poking into the kitchen at the end.
<P>The measurement was fourteen and a half feet on the floor. That meant she had twenty feet altogether.
<P>"Wow," she thought. "What is Mom going to think when she gets home?"</p>
