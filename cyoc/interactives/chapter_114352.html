<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa&#39;s Thursday morning began reasonably well, though not without her own worries. Her father still seemed to be struggling with things and taking grief to a level that was making her uneasy. She wanted her old dad back, the dad who was fun and would make jokes and truly showed his love. She knew he still loved her and would do anything to protect her, but at times it seemed no like he was out to protect her from getting even a paper cut at times. It was one thing to love mom, but Melissa felt her dad was taking it beyond was tolerable.<br />
<br />
Talking in his sleep and nightmares seemed to be something that he&#39;d picked up. Melissa knew it troubled him, but since her dad wouldn&#39;t tell her, even if she asked, she had nothing to go on, and that only complicated matters with regard to her own research. She&#39;d made her decision to be the family were after making friends Trevor, Roy, Jason, Alice, and Megumi. After all, they&#39;d proven that being a were didn&#39;t make one a monster, and Roy had even been in her position in that he&#39;d been born a normal human being but became a were. They proved to be good people, and that mattered most to Melissa regarding her decision to be the Jenkins family were.<br />
<br />
The question, was which were to be? She&#39;d managed to narrow things down between two were-species. One represented what her heart wanted. As she could feel something special forming with the first student she&#39;d met and made friends with in Trevor Tyson. He was strong, kind, gentle, confident, understanding, and everything anyone would want in a partner. And as a werebull, the part of her that was fast growing to love Trevor was willing to become a werecow to match him, and in may ways she could see the reasoning for that. The other option had been more in line with what she thought were her own personality and to be a werefox vixen. However, there she had some questions and concerns and at the moment she had only one person she could ask directly on that subject, Megumi.<br />
<br />
By now, Melissa was beginning to more easily remember the ins and outs of the school and by the time it came for her study hall period, she moved toward the library with as brisk a pace as she could muster. She arrived to the rest of the small group of friends just starting to sit down in the library at a table.  Jason had sat down textbook and a notebook and looked like he was getting ready to work on some homework that was either due later in the day or was just assigned. Alice, Roy, and Megumi were just hanging their backpacks on the back of their chairs as Melissa came in with Trevor following close behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how was your day on the farm yesterday?&quot; Megumi asked as Melissa approached, her eyes darting between Melissa and Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It went fine and I learned plenty,&quot; Melissa answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any idea on which group you want to join?&quot; Roy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;For the moment, I&#39;m stuck between two choices and need some more info in order to decide,&quot; Melissa said softly, and then turned to Megumi, &quot;though I&#39;d think you could help me out with some questions...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?&quot; Megumi asked in a way that Melissa wasn&#39;t sure if Megumi was truly surprised or just being playful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;as one of the two species that I&#39;m considering are werefoxes, and I&#39;d think you&#39;d know the most about them out of the group.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi blinked and then nodded, &quot;Is this to be private... or...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d prefer it to be private, but in the end it doesn&#39;t really matter to me,&quot; Melissa answered, &quot;I&#39;m just looking for some answers concerning certain aspects of werefox nature that the book mentioned... but seemed a bit complex.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megumi nodded and offered Melissa a chair, &quot;We werefoxes don&#39;t mind good conversation and for the most part every were knows at least the basics about every were species in Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa sat down and looked over to Megumi. The others gathered round as though they wanted to hear, though Jason did look like he was trying to work on his homework.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t get into any sort of squealing and you&#39;ll be fine with me,&quot; Jason gave one joke and then tried to focus.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what questions about werefoxes do you have?&quot; Megumi asked as Melissa sat down.<br />
<br />
&quot;It mostly relates to the bonds werefoxes have,&quot; Melissa explained, &quot;the book describes as something that is unbreakable and forms when the werefox finds the one that is their... well... their &quot;true love&quot; is the only way I can phrase it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Megumi gave a smile, &quot;a bond is a magical sensation. Too feel your partner with you and seeing the image of him with you and you with him as you live your lives... marriage, children, grandchildren, great grandchildren. To know you&#39;ve found your mate... it is wonderful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now... IF I become a werefox... what if I love someone else?&quot; Melissa questioned, &quot;You&#39;ve already explained that sex seems to be a big thing with weres. It wouldn&#39;t make me love the wrong person?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Megumi reached out and took Melissa&#39;s hand, &quot;If Trevor is the one that you bond with or are bonded with... even in your first transformation, that bond would show Trevor to you, not the dog-fox transforming you. Grandma&#39;s had to deal with a lot of trouble caused by a rogue vixen who apparently wanted a normal man to be hers and couldn&#39;t take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. However, the normal she changed didn&#39;t bond to her. He bonded to the woman he&#39;d already married. From what I&#39;ve heard, she&#39;s become a werecat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa found herself looking over to Trevor and gave a small smile before turning back to Megumi.  A story of a rogue didn&#39;t sound safe, but from what she knew already, that sort of thing was already rare. It was like sort of danger that on was in flying. Planes could crash and on occasion they did crash, but in terms of numbers, one was in more danger in their car on the highway than on a plane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that is good to know,&quot; Melissa spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Megumi nodded, &quot;is there anything else you&#39;d like to know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about with death?&quot; Melissa asked, &quot;what happens to that bond when a partner dies?&quot;<br />
<br />
A lot of this question was more on what Melissa had been dealing with her own father and his mourning. It wasn&#39;t something she wanted for herself. She didn&#39;t want Trevor to die, but she knew that everyone was mortal and that it could happen. She didn&#39;t want to put herself in a position where she could end up becoming like her father, constantly clinging to the memories of a woman who was no longer there physically. She could understand Trevor&#39;s gasp in surprise, but Megumi&#39;s was not expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh... I didn&#39;t expect THAT question,&quot; Megumi said after a moment, &quot;You see... the bond... when it forms... when it is there... it is permanent. It&#39;s why werefoxes don&#39;t have divorce issues and don&#39;t cheat on their mates. Once the bond forms, a werefox will do everything in their power to keep it and reinforce it. The bond represents love. To be one with that partner. Some may go into what are called &quot;open marriages,&quot; but that is only IF their partner agrees.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But surely... dealing with things such as death are a possibility,&quot; Melissa pointed out, &quot;are you saying that mated werefoxes time their deaths together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... nothing like that,&quot; Megumi raised her hands and shook them from side to side in front of her face, &quot;it&#39;s that the bond continues, even after the partner dies. My grandma... she had a loving mate, my grandfather...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa didn&#39;t like where this was going.<br />
<br />
&quot;He died in World War Two, when the bomb went off over Hiroshima,&quot; Megumi said slowly, &quot;My grandma and parents and uncles and a few of my older cousins came to America after the war. And I was born here in Moon Lake. My grandma will love my grandpa until the day she joins him again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It makes her mourn?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if it is truly &quot;mourn,&quot; though grandma is sensitive with regard to talking about grandpa,&quot; Megumi answered, &quot;but she has done well and has been a great grandmother to me and attentive to the Skulk&#39;s needs as a whole. Whether or not grandma is different from when before grandpa died... I cannot say, but she has been kind to me and attentive to the Skulk&#39;s responsibility and to family. She won&#39;t date again, but I would think that she has gotten on with her life and can only wait to see grandpa again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see...&quot; Melissa said slowly.<br />
<br />
That part wasn&#39;t quite the full answer. She didn&#39;t want to say she didn&#39;t like it because the bond was there and a werefox couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t find a new love, but that would come off as insensitive to Trevor who was quite healthy. Part of Megumi&#39;s answer reinforced her concerns on the bonds werefoxes had or could forge, but another part gave an indication that the bond wouldn&#39;t cause the sort of mourning that her father was going through.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry if that seemed odd or out of place,&quot; Melissa said slowly, &quot;It&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, you dropped that bombshell on us, might as well carry it through,&quot; Roy commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just that my own mother died of cancer a few years back,&quot; Melissa explained slowly, &quot;It proved inoperable and no treatment would kill the cancer and not kill her. It was painful to see my mom grow weak and eventually fall to cancer... but it&#39;s been more painful for my dad. He&#39;s loved her dearly... and it&#39;s like he clings to her memory at times. I want him to be happy again. I want him to be the dad he was when mom was alive. I...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa felt Trevor&#39;s strong arms wrap around her. Her explanation turned rambling had left her unaware of his moving his chair, but she didn&#39;t turn away from Trevor&#39;s hug and was grateful that Alice wasn&#39;t poking fun at the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Trevor assured her, &quot;We understand... it&#39;s all part of what you&#39;ve had to go through.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Melissa agreed with that, &quot;and Trevor... I don&#39;t want you to die. If we&#39;re going to be a couple I want you to be around for a VERY  long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Trevor promised.<br />
<br />
&quot;But my concern remains... if the unthinkable happens...&quot; Melissa said slowly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to carry my love around in a way that would ultimately keep me from being happy. I can&#39;t spend all my time crying for a lost loved one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is understandable,&quot; Alice commented, &quot;Everyone wants to be happy and death scares everyone. Even weres.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the bond would only insure your loyalty to Trevor,&quot; Megumi spoke, &quot;it does not mean that you wouldn&#39;t be able to make friends or be happy... and while sex may be more popular in Moon Lake than it is in other places... sex is not the sole source of happiness. Whether or not you would be able to move on is more up to you than to the bond. If you become a werevixen and bond with Trevor, you would never take another mate, even if Trevor dies... but you would still be capable of finding other ways of being happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;It helped a lot.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is perfectly fine,&quot; Megumi gave a small smile, &quot;You&#39;ll forgive some of our surprise. How weres deal with death is not normally the first question asked by people either wishing to become weres or complying with Moon Lake&#39;s laws.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And in the end, it is YOUR choice,&quot; Trevor said to her, &quot;and we&#39;ll understand it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Melissa said again just as the bell rang ending the period.</p>
