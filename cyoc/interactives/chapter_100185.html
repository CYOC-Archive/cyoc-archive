<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When Jake woke up, he felt very strange. He immediately noticed he wasn&#39;t lying on Heather&#39;s warm body now, but on his back on something else. Turning his head to the left with considerable effort, he saw the side of a hospital bed for babies. It was transparent and not very high, but he couldn&#39;t make out anything else in the room - it was beyond the reach of his eyes. Instead of being too big in a tiny world, he was now tiny in a huge world. He felt vaguely uncomfortable, even though he knew the world from his previous life. But he missed the warmth and coziness of the womb. He didn&#39;t really feel cold at the moment as he was wearing warm clothes, but the warmth they provided was somehow different from that provided by Heather&#39;s body. He wanted to suck his thumb, as he had done so often in the womb, but it turned out to be much harder now. He found out he didn&#39;t really have control of his hands yet. He managed to bring both of them into his field of vision, but they didn&#39;t really feel like parts of his body and he couldn&#39;t get his thumb into his mouth. Apparently his nervous system didn&#39;t quite work yet. Well, this was normal for newborns. Or was it? Jake wanted Heather to hold him now, to distract him from his worries, to help him put his thumb in his mouth or, even better, to let him drink from her breast. But where was she? Was she in the same room or somewhere else? Hospitals put newborn babies in the same room as their moms now, didn&#39;t they? And how did she feel after the exhausting birth? Unlike him, she had actually had to work to get him out, to push his whole body out of that little hole. Would it be ok to wake her up, in case she still needed sleep? Jake pondered these questions for a while, but then he decided that he was a baby now, so he could do what babies did. He breathed in deeply and began to cry.<br />
<br />
After what felt like quite a while, Jake was picked up carefully by two huge hands. &quot;Shhhh, Mary, it&#39;s alright. Mommy&#39;s here.&quot; Heather said softly as she put him on her shoulder and rocked him slightly. Jake immediately stopped crying, immensely relieved that she was, indeed, there for him. He felt her sit down on her bed, then lie down with him on her belly. Unfortunately there was a lot of clothes between them now, but Jake still liked this a lot better than lying in his bed. &quot;Let&#39;s find out what you need. Maybe you want some milk?&quot; Jake wished he could have answered her question with an enthusisastic &quot;Yes&quot;, but he didn&#39;t need to as she quickly freed a breast from her clothes. Maybe the thought was inappropriate now, but looking at the swollen boob he knew that as an adult he would have found her even more attractive than usual in this state. She carefully guided the nipple and areola into his mouth, distracting him from everything but sucking and swallowing the delicious milk.<br />
<br />
Jake nursed happily for a while, but then suddenly a strange feeling within his body caught his attention. It felt as if something was moving around inside his belly - not really painful, but he&#39;d never felt anything like it before. Was there something wrong with him? He let the nipple slip from his mouth and concentrated on what was going on inside him. Something was definitely moving in there. Worried, Jake whimpered a little. Heather tried to put her nipple back into his mouth, but he refused and kept his lips closed. Then he felt a warm, sticky substance leave his body and spread in his diaper. So the movement he&#39;d been feeling was actually his first bowel movement - things surely were different as a baby. Jake let out a sigh of relief and continued nursing, not bothered at all by the warm, soft mess on his butt and between his legs. Drinking mommy&#39;s milk was much more important now.<br />
When he had enough and stopped sucking, Heather sat up in bed, lifted Jake to her shoulder and started to pat his back lightly. First he was confused, but then he understood she was trying to burp him. And sure enough, he felt something moving inside again, faster and in the opposite direction this time. He opened his mouth and let out some air with a sound he himself couldn&#39;t help but find cute. &quot;Good girl!&quot; Heather said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Then she brought him back to the baby bed and carefully started to unbutton his onesie in his crotch. He knew what was coming, and it wasn&#39;t pleasant. Heather wiping between his legs made him acutely aware of the female parts, and her comments about getting &quot;sticky poopies off your tushy&quot; didn&#39;t make it any less awkward. She needed quite a lot of wet wipes and Jake was getting cold. He was about to start crying, but then he reminded himself that it was probably Heather&#39;s first time changing a diaper and that he should try not to make the new mom insecure. Finally, she found him clean enough, carefully put a new diaper on him (&quot;This is supposed to be in front, isn&#39;t it&quot;?) and tucked him in. &quot;At least I&#39;m not the only one learning new things here&quot;, Jake thought. Before he knew it, he fell asleep again.</p>
