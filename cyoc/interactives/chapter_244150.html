<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finally, we take a turn onto my street. Just a couple more houses and we&#39;re here. Carefully not to tear the door out of the wall, we squeeze in, crouching sideways, sucking in our guts, as it can in any way help, when our pecs are equally as big. I gesture towards the living room, while I go to the kitchen myself. I never liked beer before, but I feel like this is the perfect opportunity. As I grab dad&#39;s twelve pack of beer, which he planned to empty over the next week, I hear the large couch in the living room creak, as Evan lowers himself onto it. <br />
<br />
Before joining him, I pass by the bathroom to admire myself in the mirror. This is the first time I see myself in my new body today. Well, if only Evan didn&#39;t possess an identical body himself. The only differences are our heads and fur colour. <br />
<br />
My hair is much longer too. Instead of my usual short cut, there is now a long floor mop of ginger hair that reaches to my shoulders. Thinking about it, Evan&#39;s got one too. I just didn&#39;t notice it, but yeah, he&#39;s got a curly dirty blond mop just like me. Before the transformation I don&#39;t think I even knew his hair colour, since his head and his buzz cut were hidden by his baseball cap. Our body hair is slightly different too. No, we are obviously ridiculously hirsute everywhere, but Evan&#39;s body hair just like his head hair is a bunch of bushy, fluffy curls, while mine stands straight, away from my skin. My chest is one solid carpet of hair from the top of my neck, where my beard ends, all over my muscle tits and musclegut, disappearing in my crotch, where my bush is. Treasure trail? More like ‘Multi-purpose Treasure Highway’.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s still me, my face is as boyish and young as it was. Unlike Evan, I didn&#39;t grow a moustache, nor even a dense stubble. Instead, my teen face, full of acne, only gained a light dusting of fuzz on the sides, above my lips and under my chin. I still have my glasses on. Fuck, maybe I should&#39;ve also wished for 20/20 vision. Eh, whatever, it&#39;s too late. It&#39;s not that they make my face look any worse. Even without them I would look so stupid. My baby, nerd face rests on top of a hulking, burly, bulging body, covered in so much fur that many men wouldn&#39;t grow in their whole lifetime, yet here I am, a 19 year old boy. Wait, I&#39;m still 19, right? Huh… And on Monday I&#39;ll go to classes and everyone will think it&#39;s completely normal that I&#39;m the size of like five guys combined? Well, why not? Maybe now I&#39;ll finally be noticed.<br />
<br />
I lift my arms and flex. They swell into a pair of boulders, each the size of a car tyre. My one biceps alone is bigger than a normal guy&#39;s head. My biceps are also one of the few places not covered by hair, so I can clearly see a thick like a hose vein snaking on their surface. My armpit bushes are akin to a winter fur hat in those Soviet movies. No, nevermind, I&#39;m ginger, so it&#39;s obviously a very fat fox. I don&#39;t even notice neither mine nor Evan&#39;s stench anymore. Other people, though, should better get used to it.<br />
<br />
I head back to the living room and turn on the lights. Evan is spread wide on the couch, butt naked, his shorts in shreds on my coffee table, with only his backwards cap still on his head. His cock is upright, a steel cannon, pressed against his gut and curved towards him, precum leaking down his shaft and into his pubes bush. It has to be at least two feet long, thicker than Pringles can, with a bulging purple cock head. His ball-sack hangs off the couch with two grapefruits inside. <br />
<br />
“Getting yourself comfortable?” I ask.<br />
<br />
“Sure am, man.”<br />
<br />
I fall onto the couch next to him, it dangerously creaks under the weight of two mammoth men, and pass him one of the bottles. Evan opens it by tearing its cap off with his fingers. I do the same, surprised with how stupidly strong we are and also how tough the skin on my fingers is, thanks to all the callouses from all the supposed heavy lifting.<br />
<br />
“Cheers.”<br />
<br />
“Cheers.” we say, before taking the first sip of bear. <br />
<br />
Enjoying the moment, we gulp down the first bottle each. I grab the next two bottles. After the second bottle, Evan adjusts himself in his seat and wraps his hand around his shaft. Its well-lubed surface fits in his gorilla palm just fine, as he begins sliding up and down. I open his bottles myself, as we continue to chug them. Three, four, five. As I open the last two bottles, an hour has already passed, and Evan&#39;s been jerking off for a good portion of it. I pass him the bottle and start chugging mine, only to see him slam the bottle straight into his piss slit.<br />
<br />
“What the fuck, bro?” <br />
<br />
“Sorry, man, my cock’s thirsty.” Evan replies in a mellow, drunken tone.<br />
<br />
I watch in horror as the bottle’s contents empty into his dick. Then the whole bottle gets swallowed by Evan&#39;s cock. I follow it within his urethra, as a large bulge travels down his shaft, before disappearing within his balls. Wait… So, that&#39;s where all the other bottles went too, right?<br />
<br />
 Evan picks up the pace and starts panting like a dog, while my drunken mind finally comes to a realization. He&#39;s about to cum!<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t you fucking dare cum!” I roar with anger.<br />
<br />
“Sorry, man. You better find me a bucket or something.” he replies mockingly.<br />
<br />
“You asshole.” I say, finishing my bottle, as I take a deep breath and drop onto my knees in front of him, swiftly swallowing his cock. Its slick and slimy surface easily slides down deep into my throat, as I taste his pre on my tongue.<br />
<br />
“Just in time, man… Aaughh!” Evan moans, as his cock starts blasting cum into me, skipping my mouth and going straight into my gut. <br />
<br />
His cock twitches and spasms inside with every shot and I can feel my poor stomach, already full from six bottles of beer, distend even further, quickly filling up beyond limit with his hot spunk, as there seems to be an endless supply of it. My lungs grew spacious thanks to my transformation, big enough for all the reps of heavy weights in the gym, that my body should be doing on a daily basis, but even their extended capacity wanes in comparison to Evan&#39;s ceaseless discharge. I feel dizzy, as the oxygen in my lungs eclipses, and I&#39;m ready to pull out, hoping that whatever is left in Evan&#39;s balls will be easy to clean up, but thankfully as I start pulling away and his cock head leaves my throat, his stream comes to an end. I take several deep breaths with my nose to refill my lungs.<br />
<br />
“Wait, hold on, I need to piss.” Evan says from above, grabbing me by my hair and pushing my face into his crotch, my mouth full of his limping dick.<br />
<br />
I can taste the cheap beer and salty cum, as the last droplets of his trickle out of his slit and onto my tongue, before erupting in a stream of piss. I desperately gulp it down, trying not to make a mess, but still a thin yellow line escapes the corner of my mouth, wrapped around his shaft. I can feel Evan&#39;s juice going down my throat and into my gullet, mixing with his cum. For a good couple of minutes he pisses into me, his cock turning into a flaccid salami, as my gut continues to swell. I guess that all twelve beers are inside me now, five of them in the form of Evan&#39;s piss, mixed with his ocean of cum. <br />
<br />
Once he&#39;s done, Evan lets go of my hair and I fall onto my ass, while his cock flops out of my mouth, making a wet slap against his nuts. My gut jiggles and lands in my lap, now visible beyond my two feet pec shelf, with liquids loudly sloshing inside. My landing stirs a feeling, which quickly grows, before erupting into an ear-splitting burp. My gut slightly deflates, but not enough to hide underneath my muscle tits. I take a deep breath and instantly gag, as the air around me smells of beer, cum and piss.<br />
<br />
 I hear a loud snore and look up, to see Evan passed out unconscious from cumming his biggest load in life so far. <br />
<br />
I have trouble standing up, my center of gravity off balance thanks to the swollen attachment in front. I&#39;m far too tired myself, so after one failed attempt to stand up, I instead lay down on the floor fully, spread out like a sea star. My gut rests atop of me. I glide my hands across its hairy surface, feeling just how soft and jiggly it is now, listening to the sounds of beer-piss-cum inside. It raises up and down with each breath. I hope it shrinks though. I love my big basketball gut, but this is just too much. <br />
<br />
Evan is snoring like a truck on the couch, while I daze off to sleep.</p>
