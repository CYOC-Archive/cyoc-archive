<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Day 3.  There is no god.  What I saw today truly instilled in me a sense of the gravity of this situation.  I <br />
never imagined something like this.  God, I can’t get the images out of my head.  But I’ve officially lost one <br />
friend, that much I understand, as much as I can understand any of this.  It all started this morning when I <br />
was walking with Josh to class.  We passed Mark.  I tried to see if there was anything different about him, <br />
hair, muscles, anything that would confirm my suspicions that he was one of the bros.  Nothing to report, but <br />
I’m sure the symptoms will start showing themselves soon.  Its just a matter of time.  He tried to talk to me, <br />
I just kept walking with Josh and pretended I couldn’t hear.  I felt safe with Josh.  Small guy, quiet, <br />
sensitive, always trying to help others.  Not gay or anything, far as I know, but he just never jumped into <br />
girls when everyone else did, pretty sure he was still a virgin.  Nothing wrong with that I guess.  He’s kind <br />
of cherub like, that’s our joke.  Still has rounded checks, doesn’t really shave, kinda longish hair and baggy <br />
clothes.  But its whatever, he’s a great guy, or was.  As we were walking we ran into what’s-her-name.  The <br />
same girl that Evan had been hitting on yesterday, I think.  She seemed completely out of it, her eyes showed <br />
she was stoned as all Hell and barely on planet Earth.  Her eye liner was much thicker than the day before and <br />
hastily applied.  The tame brown locks she bore yesterday had been replaced with wild blonde ones that moved <br />
at the whims of the wind.  She had, somehow, acquired even shorter shorts which were torn off and covered only <br />
her ass and barely.  Speaking of her ass if she had one before, it was nothing compared to what it was now, <br />
looking almost grotesque on a girl so slight of frame, it bulged out behind her, thick and voluptuous but <br />
almost too big.  If her tight pink SoCal shirt that exposed her midriff wasn’t also struggling to contain <br />
gigantic breasts I’d swear she should be falling backwards.  But I guess they balanced out.  The sleeves were <br />
also torn off showing off her freshly tattooed arms, a butterfly on her left with wings spread wide and a <br />
frothing mug of beer on the other with a heart below it.  Weird, but to each their own.  Still, this couldn’t <br />
be right, Evan must’ve done something to her.  She barely seemed able to walk, just swaying to and fro like a <br />
broken marionette and showing off her body, her tan which she didn’t have yesterday and her newly pierced <br />
navel.  To me, it was a shame, a once beautiful creature turned into something nasty.  I could smell <br />
cigarettes as she walked by and almost gagged.  Josh apparently thought differently.  He zoned out completely <br />
and just stared at her like a lost puppy.  I’ve never seen him so completely lost over a girl, almost like he <br />
was entranced.  He started to walk after her, forgetting about me entirely.  Worried, knowing her new <br />
connection to Evan I followed him.  She turned around smiling as if she knew he was behind her the entire <br />
time.  That was pretty much it for Josh, he all but collapsed into her arms and away they went leaving me <br />
alone and very confused.  <br />
<br />
It didn’t take a genius to imagine what was happening, I just couldn’t imagine Josh doing it, and with a <br />
complete stranger.  I didn’t see him again for a few hours and I worried the whole time.  When I found him he <br />
was pacing the halls aimlessly with a dazed look.  I started talking to him and he kind of came around, <br />
claimed he didn’t remember anything between seeing her in the halls and me finding him.  We sat down while he <br />
tried to remember and clear his head.  He pulled out his iPod and we both plugged in and he put on some <br />
classic rock, he’s a bit ACDC fan.  Me, not so much, but whatever relaxed him while he tried to figure things <br />
out.  I told him about how he went off with her and how he probably had sex with her.  I tried not to notice <br />
as the front of his pants bulged instantly.  I swore for a moment the song got kind of screwy, like there was <br />
interference or it was bad quality.  He shook his head and seemed to tremble a bit as if he was recalling a <br />
nightmare.  I asked why he would do that, give himself so easily to such trash.  He stopped shaking and stared <br />
at me with a look I’ve never seen before, his eyes burning.  “I know you ain’t bout that life bro, don’t mean <br />
I’m not.”  His voice came out deep and imposing and he seemed as surprised as I was about what he said.  The <br />
song distorted again and this time I was sure I heard someone rapping for a second instead of ACDC but he <br />
didn’t seem to notice.  His face scrunched up in pain and his eyes glazed over again as I asked what was <br />
wrong.  I heard a tearing sound that brought my attention downwards.  His shoes were bulging out, the fabric <br />
straining.  They started to tear open at the sides as his feet actually widened right before my eyes.  Josh <br />
always had small feet, those size 8s or whatever didn’t stand a chance, just pop out of both sides.  It was <br />
unbelievable, except there it was, even as I blinked trying to force the world to be normal again they just <br />
kept growing and soon the top and front broke as his toes broke through and pushed forward, getting bigger and <br />
longer until the material was as good as gone and we barefoot.  Josh was back in his trance or whatever though <br />
and didn’t seem to notice, just wiggled his toes.  I looked around and students passed by, just going about <br />
their business, what the Hell was going on?  A little guy just grew to size 15 feet in a matter of seconds and <br />
no one even pauses except me…<br />
<br />
Thinking back, I should’ve gotten up right then and there and ran like Hell for the nearest exit.  But I <br />
didn’t.  The music cut out again and switched to rapping and I could hear Josh rapping along under his breath <br />
to whatever was playing, not even noticing the change.  He kept rapping even as ACDC broke through again.  He <br />
kept at it mindlessly like a zombie, his eyes empty and aimless.  I looked down again and caught something <br />
shifting in the corner of my eye.  Trying not to be too obvious I looked at Josh’s legs.  Short, thin, pale <br />
and well pretty hairless but that was changing.  I saw a lone brown hair gradually push out from his skin, get <br />
longer and thicker and darker as it curled.  A few more started to appear and the growth spread up as they <br />
gradually formed a small forest over his legs, going up from his ankles and into his shorts.  His shorts <br />
bulged again, even more than before and Josh giggled like an idiot and felt himself up.  Again, no one even <br />
noticed or cared.  He shifted some more as the music started changing again, his shirt started pushing out and <br />
I noticed two giant round indentions.  God, those were his nipples.  They were hard as cast iron and digging <br />
into his shirt as I watched his pecs expand underneath.  He rubbed them, seeming to make them grow faster and <br />
moaned in between rapping.  I doubt his shirt could take much more, but it stopped just as it was skin tight.  <br />
Now he was lifting up his shirt and rubbing his abs as they toned up, his pale stomach flattened out instantly <br />
and lines started appearing as it developed, the slight creases becoming rock solid crevices as he grew a 4 <br />
pack, no 6 pack, 8 pack.  Each ab sculpted and smooth, pale but ripped and hard like a Greek god‘s.  He was <br />
smiling like an idiot now as he kept going on and changing more.  There was no ACDC now, just the rap song.  I <br />
tried to tune it out as I saw his shoulders pressing out like they were desperate to get away from each other, <br />
further and broader as his back began to ripple with monstrous amounts of muscle, even from this position I <br />
could see every small detail.  His shirt began to tear from the strain especially at the sleeves as his biceps <br />
started inflating like balloons, smooth ivory muscle in tight but bulbous orbs that appeared all down his arms <br />
even as relaxed as he was.  His fingers twitching as they were stretched out, pulled further and made wider, <br />
his palms expanding and veins pushing out on his hand as he clenched and unclenched it rapidly.  I heard a <br />
strange sound from below again and watched the shredded material that was once his shoes start to reform over <br />
his feet.  The colors all faded to a dark color and the material thickened and expanded into expensive <br />
leather.  The socks beneath vanished as soles reformed beneath his feet and the material crept over his hairy <br />
toes across most of the top of his feet.  Cream colored laces materializing out of nowhere and weaving <br />
themselves in and out the forming holes closing the lip of the new shoes over his feet, covering his feet once <br />
again, as a fresh pair of Sperry’s top-siders.  <br />
<br />
I called out his name, trying to get him to snap out of it, but he wouldn’t or couldn’t respond.  He was <br />
blank, enthralled even.  His pants stretched tighter as his legs thickened with some muscle, his thighs <br />
expanding into his shorts painfully until they began to strain and rip as his calves developed runner’s <br />
muscles and pushed out, thick and taunt.  They grew longer as well, I could even hear the bones cracking as <br />
they broke and grew, endlessly smashing and repairing.  It was almost too much, I don’t know what kept me <br />
there, fear, confusion, loss maybe?  I knew from the start he was a goner.  The torn sleeves were vanishing, <br />
curling up into the shirt which somehow got even tighter, impossible as that seems.  The sides opened up a <br />
little more and the neck ripped down further exposing more of his impressive chest.  The material started to <br />
thin out and change, becoming softer.  The color breached into a bright white A shirt that clung to his giant <br />
pecs for dear life.  Even as his shirt finished changing the brown hairs started growing on his hands and <br />
creeping up, taking over his arms and through the painted on A shirt I could see them growing up to his navel <br />
while his chest remained perfectly smooth.  He gave another dumb giggle as something passed through him, <br />
tanning him perfectly, from head to toe to a perfect sun dedication, a true bro tan.  His torn shorts expanded <br />
a little to let, whatever growth occurred there, breathe.  He was already wearing pretty preppy shorts, the <br />
only noticeable change besides the size was that they shorted a little to reveal a little more of his grown <br />
legs.  They hung down a little more and still bulged out in the front, but somehow I felt like he was going <br />
for that.  Showing off.  I knew what was next, but it was the hardest to watch.  His already spacey eyes drew <br />
in more and emptied out like a braking dam, all the intelligence rushing out.  The pupils changed as his face <br />
relaxed, he was high.  His hair drew in, shortening and lightening.  The jaw sharpened and slackened at the <br />
same time as he gradually took on the visage of a dumb bro right there in front of everyone, not that anyone <br />
but me noticed.  Josh was gone, I knew it as he let out a long deep “woah.”  He looked at me and asked if I <br />
was “digging the dope tunes.”  I shook my head, still in shock.  “Bro this is Wiz, the fuck is wrong with <br />
you?”  He stormed off, and that was it.  <br />
<br />
I’m scared guys.  In just a few minutes one of my most boring friends became a bro, what did she do to him?  <br />
It’s not just the video anymore, its like a super virus infecting everyone I care about.  I don’t know how <br />
much longer I can go on, everyone around me is dropping.  I’m sorry for the late post I just spent so much <br />
time sitting there wondering what happened.  Signing off, thank you as always guys.<br />
<br />
