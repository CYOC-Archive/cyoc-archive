<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It&#39;s not like me to feel masculine. I mean, the lines are always blurred between masculine and feminine, but I felt very masculine today. It was like I wanted to get out of bed and have sex, ravenous sex. I had never felt this horny in the morning before. I looked down and found out why.<br />
<br />
I was still in my tank top that I wear when I sleep, but it was tighter around my torso, like it had grown a few sizes. I noticed a distinct lack of breasts, all that was left were some loosely defined pecs and some pert nipples where my girls once stood. I felt under my tank top. Everything was smooth. My skin felt so soft to the touch, I took pride in my skin before today, but it felt even softer than normal. It felt good. Moving from my chest down, I could feel my tummy. It was hard, not too hard though. Lifting up my shirt, I couldn&#39;t see any ab definition. My belly button looked like it was somewhere between an inny and an outy.<br />
<br />
Moving my arms around my body, I started to notice how they had changed. My shoulders were more prominent, not huge, but they seemed a bit more square than normal. The rest of my arms looked slightly more muscular. It seemed like my transformed body wasn&#39;t too fond of using the gym, but it wasn&#39;t too indulgent either. My hands... my hands were still somewhat dainty. They felt smooth to the touch, like I used moisturizer often; completely unlike my boyfriend&#39;s whose were more rough and calloused. But these hands weren&#39;t too dainty, they looked like they were caught between a man&#39;s hands and a woman&#39;s hands. The fingernails were manicured, not painted, but they had a protective coating and looked well-taken-care-of.<br />
<br />
All these changes made me think, &quot;was I a man now?&quot; Maybe the curse transformed me into a man or something. There was only one way to check. I pulled back my covers and looked down at my crotch. My panties had a bulge. I let out a gasp. It sounded somewhere between a full-grown woman&#39;s and a teenage boy&#39;s. I pulled down my panties to see a small penis perched where my vagina once was. If there ever was a feminine penis, this was surely it. It was standing erect at only about 3 inches long. The balls were small, and they barely hung from my pelvis. Not a pubic hair in sight. It was almost cute, in a way.<br />
<br />
I shot out of bed and looked in my mirror. Staring back at me was a more masculine version of my self. My hair was shorter, and cut into a sort of pixie cut. I looked a bit taller, maybe an inch or two. My face looked a tiny bit more masculine. My jawline was more prominent, my nose jutted out a bit more, but other than that, it was still very much me. My lips were still the same size (maybe even bigger), my cheekbones were in about the same place, and I still had those piercing blue eyes everyone compliments me on. I brought my new hands up to my face. It was also as smooth as a baby&#39;s butt. I felt my lips (they were bigger!), they seemed very kissable. I was kind of turned on by my new visage.<br />
<br />
My new body had a lot to offer too. My twinkish torso looked as great as it felt. Seeing it in the mirror made me realize how feminine I still looked. My body seemed to be the definition of androgynous. Then my eyes worked their way down. My tiny penis sat between two thick, juicy thighs. My god, they looked great. From the waist down (minus the penis), I actually looked even more feminine than before. My thighs tapered to cute, curvy calves and then even further to my two, largely unchanged feet. For a &quot;guy&quot; (if I could even call myself that), I must&#39;ve had size 7&#39;s or something.<br />
<br />
The best part was when I turned around. My ass did NOT quit. It was huge. I had never seen a guy with this big of a dump truck before. Maybe it was because I was a male now, but my ass looked enormous. I clapped my hands to my ass and saw a ripple go through the fat back there. This ass was juicy. I bent forward and started shaking that thing to the mirror. It looked amazing. I had always been a straight woman, but even I knew that my butt looked great. My newly-formed dick seemed to think the same thing.<br />
<br />
I paused my self-indulgent twerking to see that my tiny cock was oozing precum. From what I knew of male masturbation, one usually strokes the dick in order to cum. But this knew body knew that it wanted something different. It wanted something up its perfect ass. I rooted through my desk trying to find something to use. While I was rooting, I found my wallet. My drivers license had a question mark next to sex, and it turns out I had aged from 17 to 20. I smirked at this new knowledge. I continued to root through my drawers, trying to find something phallic to stick up my ass.<br />
<br />
My face was becoming flush, never before had I wanted something sexual so badly. &quot;Must be the testosterone,&quot; I muttered to myself. My voice was familiar; feminine yet masculine. I sounded like a woman whose voice was strained from singing too much or something. I liked it. I felt like I had a voice that was very idiosyncratic. Maybe this version of Emily--or, I guess, Emile--was a punk singer or something. I kept digging through papers expecting to find a hairbrush handle or something, but I was met with something far greater. I pulled out a big, pink, metallic vibrator. &quot;Hoo yeah.&quot; I was salivating at the thought.<br />
<br />
My boyfriend and I had fooled around in the past, but we had never tried butt stuff, so this was a new experience for me. Luckily, I had found some lube near the vibrator. The tip took a bit of effort to put in. It was almost painful, actually. I tried to keep my strained moans to a minimum as not to alert anyone else in the house that I was masturbating. The tip was in; I felt like a king. &quot;Time for the rest of you,&quot; I said. I said it sort of jokingly, I didn&#39;t think I could fit that entire vibrator up my ass, but as I kept sliding it in, I gained more and more confidence in this new body&#39;s ability. Eventually, I got 3/4 of the thing in there. Not all of it, but I didn&#39;t think that was bad for an anal virgin.<br />
<br />
Next was the fun part. Using the mirror, I flicked the switch on the vibrator. After that, all I felt was pure ecstasy. I pumped the pink vibrator in and out of my tight asshole in a euphoric rhythm. In and out I went. I could see myself panting and drooling in the mirror. I was so lost in the moment I was even sticking my tongue out. And my new voice was matching the rhythm with my moaning. &quot;Ohh, oooh, uhh, fu- huhh fuuuuucckk!&quot; I even had a little squeak in my voice. God, it felt amazing. My rhythm sped up. Faster and faster I went until I came.<br />
<br />
I still had my panties on and my cock was holding them up. As I reached my climax I saw my little pecker shoot out a thin rope of cum through the satin panties onto the floor. Shortly after, I collapsed onto my bed, panting as my cock finished spewing cum. I never noticed it before, but apparently guys&#39; dicks pulse after they cum. It was strange to both see and feel as an ex-woman. &quot;Well, as fun as that was, it&#39;s time for me to...&quot;</p>
