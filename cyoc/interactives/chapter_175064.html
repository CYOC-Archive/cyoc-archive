<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty saw that June was shrinking gradually in size!<br />
<br />
He had to give his head a shake and process that he was actually seeing what he was seeing. As his tall and imposing step mother stood there trembling and clutching herself in her arms, her face broke into a grimace and hot sweat began to form on her brow. She was losing size! Ty could actually make out her size decreasing! Already she was a couple inches shorter! My God, she was shrinking! His step mom was shrinking right in front of him! People couldn&#39;t shrink!<br />
<br />
He gasped deeply as he felt the warmth inside of him surge and realized. The fantasy of Dustin. His strange feelings. My God, it was real! It was actually real! His eyes widened in disbelief and then mounting excitement as June staggered to the kitchen counter and threw her shaking arms down, fingers clenching the hard marble as she gasped and tried to get control of herself. All the while, Ty watched from a distance as he watched her body decrease right before his eyes. Her night gown hit her ankles and began to pool over her feet. Her housecoat began to slip down her shoulders and her arms. She was under six feet!<br />
<br />
In total fascination, utter bewildered astonishment, Ty carefully approached June&#39;s back, listening to her grunts of obvious discomfort, and watched as she continued to slowly but steadily melt away her size. By the time he reached her, she had fallen to five and a half feet and it was clear the initial pain was lessening. Ty put his hand on June&#39;s back, feeling the warm body under her clothing actually reducing under his hand. He let slip a delighted grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty! Fuck off! Can&#39;t you see something is wrong with me!&quot;<br />
<br />
June wheeled again, her clothing flowing and whisping around with her, and came face to face with a 4&#39;6&quot; Ty who was suddenly standing as tall as the bottom of her neck. She blinked several times in shock, still shaking a little, her sweat intensifying and her cheeks suddenly blushing red. Her mouth felt agape, her eyes widened. She watched as he continued to raise. She looked around the kitchen quickly, her confusion growing even as she went the opposite way, and her hand touched the counter from a much shorter perspective. She turned back to Ty standing in front of her staring *down* in amazement and looked down at her night gown and housecoat with a comprehending gasp of absolute horror. She held up her hands, slipping down the now long arms of her robe, and saw how tiny and dainty she was in her now oversized morning clothes.<br />
<br />
Birds chirped outside, the sun had come up in full. June stood in her kitchen shrinking in front of Ty, now so short that the top of her head came up to his chest. She took several terrified steps back, tripping over her enormous housecoat and causing it to fall away to the floor. She was hyperventilating in horror. Ty advanced on her, watching her go ever smaller, and his grin grew wider as she hit the kitchen table, her shoulders bumping into the top, and her night gown slipped down her now greatly slimmed shoulders, revealing her normally hidden cleavage.<br />
<br />
June held up her hands defensively. &quot;Ty, no! Please, no! You have to help me! I-I&#39;m... I&#39;m... shrinking!&quot; She gasped as she realized her voice was now starting to raise in pitch. She sounded significantly meeker and strange. Her horrified face twisted, hot sweat running down her brow, all of her body sweating and shaking in fear, as Ty reached her, grabbed her wrist in his, and held her there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty, no!&quot; June began to struggle, trying to twist out of his grip as she fell to just about the middle of Ty&#39;s chest. She tried to wrench her arm away as her nightgown began to slip off. Her left shoulder fell first, held up by nothing, and exposed her completely naked breast and half her upper body. This mortified June as she struggled and pried at Ty&#39;s hand with her other hand, finding herself unable to tear his fingers away as they tightened around her slimming wrist.<br />
<br />
All the while, Ty stared down at her in absolute bliss. He was completely in control of the situation, grabbing her other struggling arm and holding it fast as her nightgown slipped away entirely, exposing June&#39;s totally naked and shrinking body to his gaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty!&quot; June squeaked, her cheeks burning bright red. Her dwindling body covered in hot dripping sweat from head to toe. &quot;Let go of me! Please! I&#39;m sorry! Please!&quot; Her voice was growing higher, she was now barely as tall Ty&#39;s waist.<br />
<br />
Ty held her hands firmly and marvelled as she weighed practically nothing to him. He watched in amazement as she was forced to step onto her tiptoes, kicking, and then finally he held her inches off the ground by both arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;TYYYY!&quot; June screamed, kicking, flailing, her expression completely agonized as she began to cry. &quot;PUT ME DOWN!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty didn&#39;t put the kicking flailing shrinking woman down. He held her up in the air and let her keep shrinking away, marvelling as he held tight to her wrists and felt her arms thinning and receeding under his grasp. The feeling of his horrible step mom&#39;s humiliated fear only increasing grew erotic. Powerful. Ty giggled in amazement, realizing that in her mid-forties she had definitely taken care of her body, and wondered why he had never really noticed her tight curves or substantial breasts. She opened her eyes long enough to find herself barely three feet tall, held in the air completely helpless, and with her hated step son leering at her like a piece of meat. She screamed a high pitched scream, kicked harder and faster with all of her might, tiny feet violently kicking Ty&#39;s knees and groin with absolutely no effect, and kept shrinking and struggling.<br />
<br />
Eventually, she had grown so light that Ty let go of one hand, letting her flail to the side. June&#39;s eyes opened, she squeaked in fresh fear, and quickly reached up and grabbed his other hand to hold on. Ty let her fingers slip out of her palm and she clutched his wrist with biting fingertips. She let another squeaky cry as she watched the ground get farther and farther away. She had to keep adjusting her grip as her fingers shrank smaller and smaller.<br />
<br />
She looked back to Ty and went perfectly white with fresh jaw dropping horror as she found herself no more than two feet tall. Ty stared at her expression with warm joy and utter awe. June let out a whimper and began to piece together what was happening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-You did this to me!&quot; She squeaked, voice ever higher and cuter. &quot;I don&#39;t know how, but this was you!&quot; She felt pure revulsion and humiliation as she helplessly shrank before Ty. Soon, he reached up and grabbed her thigh. She struggled again and reached down to smack his hand away. Ty only giggled and put his *other* hand around her waist.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you look at you!&quot; He whispered in reverance.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no!&quot; June whimpered. &quot;Get your hands off me! Make this stop! Please, make this stop! I&#39;m too small! Stop shrinking me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Noooo...&quot; Ty whispered again, dreamily. He watched as his fingertips closed around June&#39;s waist and he completely encompassed her hips. She looked down in fresh shock and grabbed at his giant palms, trying to wrench his fingers away. She shrank on, now just inches tall, her legs kicking again desperately until she was tired out. She fell still, trying to break Ty&#39;s grip, and realized it was a useless gesture as his palms now engulfed her knees and closed around her stomach. My God, she was a doll! She was the size of a doll!&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking back up to Ty, the reality of her situation hit home as she processed her new and ever decreasing scale. Wet tears began to fall and her mouth fell agape in defeat as she looked into Ty&#39;s eyes and saw him enjoying every second of her growing more and more helpless.<br />
<br />
To her sudden surprise, she let out a tiny high pitched yelp as Ty walked toward the table, set her down on her hands and knees, and lorded over her. She felt his leering eyes observing every detail of her rapidly shrinking form. As she fell to twelve inches, one foot in height, she felt a sudden lurch and almost threw up as she suddenly stopped.<br />
<br />
Gasping, exhausted, June looked over to her side and saw Ty&#39;s giant hand reach out. She trembled helplessly as his smooth boyish palm ran across her spine, stopping just above her ass and sending a tingle down her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; June said meekly, crying, shaking, utterly helpless. &quot;Don&#39;t touch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ty reached out and grabbed her head, gently turning it to look at him. She gasped and went wide eyed again as she stared with blinding horror into his warm excited face.<br />
<br />
&quot;See?&quot; Ty whispered darkly, a huge evil grin forming. &quot;I told you I liked women too.&quot;<br />
<br />
June began to shake in earnest as Ty released her head and she stared down at the giant vinyl placemat she was kneeling down on in sudden shocked disbelief. She looked back to him, eyes even wider, and stared.</p>
