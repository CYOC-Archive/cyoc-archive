<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br>Just as the hair stylist was about to start working on you, you wake up. Startled and naked, you jump to your feet and look him dead in the eyes. You watch him, his eyes moved down to your soft cock that was slowly rising to the occasion.</br>
<br>"What are you looking at and what the hell were you thinking about doing?"</br>
<br>He stutters, not knowing if you were going to kill him or what you were going to do. "I... I was just going to... give you a haircut."</br>
<br>"No... I rather like the way I am and I know what you were going to do. I wasn't totally unconcious and I know you wanted to do a make over on me. You wanted to even turn me gay, isn't that right?"</br>
<br>"Ye... yes... you are right... I apologize sir!"</br>
<br>"Well... I am glad to know that some are willing to admit to their actions in this day and age! I am not angry with you, but you should not take advantage of people, regardless of appearance. Besides... how do you know I am not gay already?" You say with a wide and evil grin.</br>
<br>His eyes widen in surprise, but not really knowing what you were intending on doing. You look at the fear in his eyes, knowing that he was indeed afraid of you... if only he knew why, but that wasn't the important fact at the moment. Since he was going to change you and mold you into whatever he wanted, you decide to do the same thing for him.</br>
<br>"I want the truth from you now boy! What do you think of me? Know that no matter your answer, I will not bring harm to you!"</br>
<br>"Well... you are definitely hot, although not my type..."</br>
<br>"Really then, what is your type?"</br>
<br>"Younger men, not hairy, but as manly as you are!"</br>
<br>"Well, then I guess you will be the one getting a makeover today!"</br>
<br>He continues looking at you in fear, fear of you, fear of what he would become once you were done with him... mainly, fear of the unknown!</br>
<br>You walk up to him in all of your naked glory, grab him by his shoulders and force him into the chair you were once sitting in. You glare at him as you walk away, closing the door to the back room and locking the two of you in. Walking back to him, you smile, showing off your pearly whites and he leans forward, as if to study your teeth.</br>
<br>Now standing directly in front of him, you spin him around in his chair, having him face the mirror to watch everything you would be doing to him. The first thing you do is chop off all of his long, bleached hair, making it short and able to spike. You then take your clippers, cutting off all the hair on side of his head, blending it in with the top. Once you were done, you spin him around and bare your pearly whites again. Just as before, he studied your teeth, but this time he knew he saw something that wasn't normal with you. You grin evilly and his eyes open wide, scared of you now more than the fear he had earlier.</br>
<br>"What... what is wrong buddy?"</br>
<br>"There is something wrong with your teeth. Your bicuspids are much longer than normal. Wh... what are... you?"</br>
<br>You smile at him again, making sure he saw all of your teeth. You spin him around again and place one meaty man hand over his eyes, making sure he could not see what you were going to do. You take a rag and wipe the sweat off your hairy chest, making sure to get a few hairs on the towel and then wipe it across his entire face in the areas where face fur was normal. You put the towel away while removing your hand afterward and smile into the mirror. He looks at your reflection, smiles and begins to scratch at his face furiously. Very quickly, his face became covered in stubble, where he couldn't grow any in the first place. A full, one inch long beard grew in within seconds. He even noticed something, while he was growing a beard, his jaw line became chiseled and more defined. Soon after, his body increased in heat, needing to become cooler he strips in front of you. You smile while watching all of his muscles grow to that of a hard-working construction worker. Dark hair covered his hands, arms, chest and stomach nicely and somewhat thick, but not too thick. Then the heat moved to the lower parts of his body and he stood up to remove his pants. Just like his upper body, muscles sprouted up all over, making his thighs and calves much thicker and muscular. Hair then sprouted up, covering his mid thighs, calves and feet in dense hairs.</br>
<br>Amazed by what just happened, he stared at his own body in disbelief, recognizing he aged from being twenty years old in appearance to thirty-five. After he got over how he looked, he looked up at you. A huge smile came over him, knowing that what you just gave him was the best gift he could have asked for. He didn't know why he would want to change someone from being so masculine into what he thought was hot. Now he thought you and him were hot, not to mention being made for each other. He stands on his feet, still in his undies and looks you in the eyes. You both lean in and kiss passionately. As you break off from the long and sensual kiss, you look at him in his eyes and smile.</br>
<br>"So I see you like what I have given to you eh?"</br>
<br>His voice being much deeper than before, which startled him. "Yes, I love it! I am just curious to know what you did and how you did it."</br>
<br>"Well that is a secret and I guess I could tell you... I just need to know if I can trust you with my secret."</br>
<br>"I swear to you that I can keep it! Please tell me!"</br>
<br>"Ok... well what I am is not normal and I have told only a few..."</br>
<br>"Well... I know you are gay remember, you came out to me."</br>
<br>"No, no it's not that, obviously. You see I'm a..."</br></p>
