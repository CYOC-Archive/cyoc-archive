<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danielle felt a little sorry for Peter knowing that he probably wouldn't like what Kat had picked for him. Well she did until he said &quot;You two are crazy and should be locked up. I'm breaking up with you Kat. I have no desire to be a crazy girl's boyfriend. I'll make sure to tell everyone I know that you two are crazy so neither of you will have a boyfriend in this town.&quot; He turned to Danielle and said &quot;You being just as crazy as your sister is a shock to me. I've always liked you since you seemed nicer than your sister. At times I had wished that I had met you before your sister but now I don't want anything to do with either of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter got up and headed to the door. Danielle could see tears streaming down Kat's face and felt a surge of rage. He had hurt Kat so bad that he deserved whatever he got. Danielle stood up and pointed her wand at the door. After uttering an incantation the door became part of the wall. Danielle was proud of herself since it had taken her months to master that spell and memorize it. She had done it on a dare from Kat since she didn't see the necessity of that spell. Now she was glad that she did.<br />
<br />
Peter whirled around when he saw the door become a wall with a look of fear in his eyes. He saw Danielle pointing her wand at where the door used to be and saw the anger in her eyes. He then looked at Kat and saw the tears streaming down her face. It was then that the old saying &quot;Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.&quot; flitted through his mind and he had just scorned her big time. He looked back to Danielle and said in a shaky voice &quot;S-s-so it's t-t-true. You two are witches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well duh&quot; Danielle said. &quot;We were just going to do a few simple transformations to prove it to you but you would have been back to yourself at the end. Now I don't think you will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat stood up and Peter could see the anger and hurt in her eyes. &quot;Wait!&quot; he said. &quot;If you two are witches then that must mean your mother is one too. Won't she be upset if you do anything to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure that she'll understand once we explain what you did&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't mean it&quot; Peter said trying to save his ass. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT!&quot; Kat shouted. &quot;NEVER PISS OFF A WITCH!&quot; She calmed down enough to say &quot;Dani, would you remove his clothes please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It would be my pleasure&quot; Danielle said. She muttered an incantation and Peter's clothes began to glow.<br />
<br />
Peter looked down just in time to see the glow fade leaving him completely naked. He tried backing out of the room but stumbled into a chair and fell back.<br />
<br />
Danielle wasted no time in saying another incantation. Ropes grew out of the sides of the chair and wrapped around Peter binding him tight. Danielle smiled a wicked grin and said &quot;You should have known that there would be no escape. Now take your punishment like a man, not that you'll be one much longer.&quot; Looking at Peter's naked body was causing her to become aroused. Peter has been the only male she had seen naked since she had been transformed and she had avoided thinking about naked guys. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to have a boyfriend. No! What was she thinking?<br />
<br />
&quot;Please don't do anything to me&quot; Peter begged. &quot;I still have my whole life ahead of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A life in which you can hurt more girls?&quot; Kat asked. &quot;You've had your chance now you will pay! You'll never hurt another girl again! Since you were going to leave me I'm going to turn you into my dress. And since you wanted to be with my sister I'll let her change you every other day into whatever she wants but you will always return to being my dress. This is your life now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat pointed her wand at Peter and said a spell she had memorized. As soon as she was finished Peter began to glow. Peter tried to get out out of this one more time. &quot;Please don't change me&quot; he sobbed. &quot;I promise that I won't tell anyone you're crazy. I know you're not now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right about not telling anyone that we're crazy&quot; Danielle said. &quot;In fact, you won't be telling anyone anything ever again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter opened his mouth to say something but screamed instead as his transformation started. Danielle had mastered transformations without pain months ago but Kat had trouble with it. Danielle suspected that it was because she had a sadistic side that she couldn't fully suppress. When Kat had transformed her she had felt pain but Kat wasn't trying to cause her pain. Now any restraint she had was gone for this transformation.<br />
<br />
Peter continued to scream as his toes and feet fused together. Next his calves fused together then his knees. His thighs were the last thing on his lower body to fuse together. His dick, balls, and ball sack melted into his groin leaving a smooth surface. All of his hair receded into his skin leaving absolutely no hair anywhere on his body or head. His fingers fused together and his hands thinned until they were the same size as his wrists. At this point his hands melted into his arms. His head melted into his body and soon his screaming stopped which was a relief.<br />
<br />
Peter's changes continued as his skin turned red and took on a velvet look. His feet melted into his legs as they shortened. His arms also shortened until they were about the length of short sleeves. His legs had shortened to about mid calf now.<br />
<br />
Danielle thought she knew what would happen next and she didn't want her sister's new dress to be ruined. She quickly undid the rope spell and she did it just in time. Peter's body started to hollow out. Soon where Peter had sat was a red velvet dress.<br />
<br />
&quot;KATHERINE MORGAN LE'FEY! DANIELLE JOAN LE'FEY!&quot; their mother's voice boomed behind them making them jump. &quot;WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THAT BOY?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Kat and Danielle turned to face their mother. Both of them were scared since she had years more experience as a witch then they did. They saw that their father was hanging in the background as far as possible without withdrawing from what was going on. It was pretty evident why he was, their mother was pissed as much as Kat was.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU TURN THAT BOY BACK THIS INSTANT OR I'LL REGRESS BOTH OF YOU TO THE AGE OF FIVE!&quot; their mother shouted. &quot;I EXPECTED BETTER OF YOU DANIELLE. I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD SHOW COMPASSION AFTER YOUR SISTER TRANSFORMED YOU!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please let us explain Mom&quot; Danielle pleaded.<br />
<br />
It was then that Kat broke down sobbing uncontrollably and threw herself into her mothers arms. This caught her off guard and her anger seemed to evaporate. Kat hadn't broken down like this in a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Danielle, what happened?&quot; their mother asked. &quot;Why is Kat sobbing like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She had invited Peter over to tell him she was a witch&quot; Danielle said. &quot;When she did he called both of us crazy and broke up with her. He threatened to tell everyone he knew that we were crazy. He then said that he had sometimes wished he had met me first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Their mother's anger seemed to come back and their father seemed to be suppressing his rage. Their mother looked at Kat's new dress and said in a cold tone &quot;He got what he deserved then. Is he aware?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat nodded her head against her mother.<br />
<br />
Their mother looked at Kat tenderly and then back to Peter. She then said in that same cold tone &quot;You are lucky that it was not I who transformed you. If I had your fate would have been much worse. I would have transformed you into a pig then slaughter you myself. We would have been having pork tomorrow. As it is you'll live as Kat's dress until such time as she decides to turn you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kat said that I could change him every other day but that he would always revert back to her dress&quot; Danielle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even better&quot; their mother said coldly. &quot;I hope that you'll remind him -not- to play with Kat's emotions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll try my best&quot; Danielle said. She had never seen her mother like this. It was like she had an evil side to her. Was this the price of the magic?<br />
<br />
Their mother held Kat until she had sobbed all she could for the moment. She then gently pushed her away a little bit so she could look into her eyes. She smiled and gently said &quot;I'm not going to punish you for this. Though I didn't like hearing his screams. You need to learn to transform people without pain. Your sister managed that months ago. I don't understand why you haven't been able to do the same.&quot; She then looked at both Kat and Danielle and said &quot;I want to see both of you girls in my room. First though, go hang up your new dress so it doesn't wrinkle. You can wear it when we go out for dinner tomorrow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danielle picked up Kat's dress and took it up to her room. She didn't want to see it get ruined and she was afraid that if Kat carried it she might tear it or otherwise mangle it. Once the dress was hung up in Kat's closet Kat said &quot;I wonder why Mom wants us in her room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess we'll see soon enough&quot; Danielle said as the exited Kat's room and headed back downstairs to their mothers room.</p>
