<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few days before...<br />
<br />
Katy had hit all the taboos left this age of sexuality, incest and bestiality. She and her brother had been dogs oh and yeah he was her full brother, not step or half brother. Same fucking parents, still happily married. She remembered swallowing the pills that tasted like metal. She had walked past the mirror when she noticed her midriff bulged slightly. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot;<br />
<br />
She felt waves of nausea hit her, making her head spin. Burning with fever she had taken her top off, showing her small breasts encased in their bra. She tried to make it to the toilet or sink vomited on the floor. Covering her stomach and bra in bile. A burning pain surged through her belly, making her bite her lip in pain. Tears ran down her face as her belly bloated. A sheen of sweat popped out of her skin as she felt her throat feeling very dry and hot. She turned on the faucet and drank about a gallon of water. <br />
<br />
As she stood up she started to feel normal when she ran a hand over her breasts. One of her finger brushed her nipples and she orgasmed in surprise. A gasp passed her puffy lips. An electric shock make her vagina lips twitch. Her nipples had been darkened from their healthy pink to almost chocolate brown. With each breath her breasts grew bigger and bigger, pushing in her bra away from her chest. <br />
<br />
Deep inside her something something swelled. The growing weight made Katy&#39;s petite legs wobble, as she was suddenly carrying a lot more weight than she was used to. Katy leaned against the wall, her growth slowly forcing her into a sitting position. Just as Katy&#39;s thoughts turned to fear that she would burst into a million pieces soon, the pressure slowed, and stopped. &quot;Ooh!&quot;, Katy gasped, as her hands flew to her swollen belly. She felt something strange. At first, she thought that something else about her was about to change, but then she realized that that wasn&#39;t it... whatever she was carrying within her was simply kicking and rolling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pregnant&quot;, she repeated she sobbed. &quot;Like... REALLY pregnant!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then it dawned on her that whatever had got her pregnant didn&#39;t want her to have an abortion. She now had to have surgical abortion. Hence her trip to the doctor, state law required her to eye what was on the sonogram before she went ahead with the abortion. The doctor&#39;s comments that he couldn&#39;t see shit, that meant that she couldn&#39;t get an abortion. That she would have to give birth to this baby. Kal had run off and joined the Army. Leaving her with there incest baby.    <br />
<br />
Katy then realized that the abortion pill had resulted in the pregnancy pushing itself out to six months. Previously she had been going through it an a normal rate. However she now had a new idea. She got the  wooden box and threw it into a open fire. She hoped that whatever she had been knocked up with was linked to that box. The next morning her parents fire was ash and the wooden box was untouched. She had tried to smash it with a hammer and thrown it into a woodchipper only for the machine to jam, like a fucking shredder with too much paper. She now understood that the items inside the box, the dildo and collar, were cursed or magical or something. When she realized that she was pregnant she taken a morning after pill that would kill the baby. She had fallen pregnant when Kal and her were half-dog/half-human. <br />
<br />
She had finally tossed it in the dumpster of an apartment block. Where is found a new owner. Sabrina was a Mexican-Indian model. Five five, she had a booty that would make Kim K blush, an influencer and a model she was 22 going on 23. She had just found out that her boyfriend actually had another girl who was pregnant. She went to the dumpster, following a heavily pregnant redhead, a skinny white girl. She had taken photo of the auto she was driving. Sabrina opened the wooden box and found  Hidden inside the box Sabrina found a leather dog collar and a very unsual formed dildo. The collar was made out of dark leather and was complete with a D-ring to connect a leash to it. It was big enough to be fitted right around her neck. The dildo was made out of a creamy white rubber and was formed like nothing Sabrina had ever seen before. It was long and thick, slightly pointed at the upper end and had a huge bulge at the other side. Gruesome... how could anybody think about... Sabrina&#39;s mind raced. It was a canine dick, she had her Husky, Max, his erection was like that. Also it was Valentines day and she was very horny. Max had also been there for her, if only she had a boyfriend like him.</p>
