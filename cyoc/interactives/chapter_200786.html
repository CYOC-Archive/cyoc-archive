<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle quickly went to the bathroom near his bedroom to make himself tidier before heading down to dinner, looking in the mirror his hair was a mess and his face was slightly red, like how it was after he jerked his cock. He washed his face and straightened his hair before leaving the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Walking down the stairs Kyle felt his face was returning to a normal state, what that was he wasn&#39;t sure but the tingling was going away and he could talk mostly normally if he focused on what he was saying.<br />
<br />
Though it had only been a couple minutes since he tidied himself, Kyle felt slightly dirty still, like somewhere deep inside him he felt like his mouth was a huge gaping mess that everyone could see, part of him was freaking out, another newer part was proud which in turn made his cock throb a little and chub up which given the shorts he quickly pulled on without underwear, and his modest 7 inches, was just a little obvious.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ky! Took you long enough your dinners starting to get cold!&quot; His Dad, Jacob, said looking over from the couch in the living room as he entered the kitchen and went to sit at the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sthorry Dad, lost track of time,&quot; Kyle replied with a slight lisp and his face still slightly red.<br />
<br />
Jacob gave him an odd look for a moment, &quot;Whats with the lisp?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I bit my tongue and spthilled sthome water before,&quot; Kyle lied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, your tongue ok?&quot; His Dad asked concerned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;ll be thine!&quot; Kyle said with a smile as he looked at his dinner on the table, his dad and brothers had already finished and were watching TV.<br />
<br />
Looking at his plate Kyle enjoyed the sight of his meal, a large plate full of whole boiled potatoes, steamed carrots and beans and 4 thick sausages, the sight of which made his mouth water slightly. <br />
<br />
&#39;I never liked sausaged that much?&#39; Kyle thought to himself, he always liked his dads food, he was just never all that fond of the phallic shaped food, which he felt was ironic given his preference for cock.<br />
<br />
Laughing to himself he grabbed his fork and started on his plate, forgoing a knife and starting with the potatoes. <br />
<br />
As soon as the round vegetable was in his mouth Kyles tongue snatched it off the fork, like it was on autopilot it rolled it around his mouth a little getting it wet before literally guiding it to his throat, the slippery white orb gliding down his gullet with no effort on his part.<br />
<br />
The ordeal was odd but it left Kyle stifling a moan so his family didn&#39;t hear as he grabbed another potato for a repeat performance.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of basically making out with his vegies he&#39;d finished and moved to the longer meatier part of his meal, this time Kyle was sure he was ready for his body&#39;s reaction, he thought.<br />
<br />
Picking up the sausage by one end with his fork he brought it to his wet, slightly plumped up lips, and placed the end of the cooked meat product on his tongue. To his surprised it was like his tongue knew there was a big difference between the veg and the meat product. it quickly stuck out from his lips to wrap as much as it could around the sausage, trying to both lube it up and pull it in at the same time.<br />
<br />
Kyle quickly let it work, trying to fight the sensations was proving difficult, like his mouth was in control at that moment and all it wanted was the meat, and him trying to fight it was making him moan, though quietly, he noticed that his dad was turning to see if he was alright.<br />
<br />
As his tongue pulled the thick meaty sausage of his dinner into his mouth entirely it was like his throat was trying to massage it, almost milking it, it was difficult but Kyle manage to not moan as his throat worked on the sausage like it was a cock.<br />
<br />
Then almost as quickly as it started it stopped as he felt the sausage slide effortlessly down his throat to his stomach. Not without leaving Kyle&#39;s cock throbbing in his shorts under the table, no doubt with a sticky patch of pre on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You ok Ky?&quot; His Dad asked from the living room glancing in his direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Kyle jumped slightly forgetting his dad was so close by as he turned to look at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ok? Your tongue must be bothering you, you look a bit uncomfortable.&quot; He asked concerned for his son.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, ah yeah, It&#39;sth a little sthore but I&#39;ll be fine!&quot; Kyle replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Jacob said and turned back to the TV.<br />
<br />
Kyle then went back to his sausages, having almost the same response to the other 3 all ending with a throb from his cock. <br />
<br />
After he finished and carefully moved his cock to under the waist band of his shorts, Kyle put his plate in the dishwasher and went back up to his room, his dad and brothers not even paying him attention as he went up the stairs.<br />
<br />
Kyle realised as he got back to his bedroom that not once during his dinner did it even occure to him to chew his food, it all having slid down his throat so easily, again an odd realisation but he was willing to live with it.<br />
<br />
Now back in his room Kyle stripped off his clothes, this time making sure his door was locked before he got his toy back out of his drawers.<br />
<br />
Kyle then...</p>
