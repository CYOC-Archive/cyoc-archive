<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris went back to the magic shop and find various pieces of her clothing, he buys it piece by piece. The man watching the magic shop warns him &quot;It in here kid because it is magic and shouldn&#39;t be played around with. Those items are powerful as they belonged to someone important...they contain powerful memories!&quot;<br />
<br />
He doesn&#39;t care, he find a wide cheap baby doll black dress. At home, with his mind on avoiding his stiff dick of a father, he locks himself in the attic and strips down. He pulls on his set of black panties and then the dress over his thin shoulders. What happens next is a body swap, he is no longer looking at woman in the woman. He. Is. The. Woman. Chris finds himself, or herself in the baby doll dress. <br />
<br />
She looks down and she is now a woman, but not the mature woman that he saw in the mirror at least 30 something in mirror. The Lady is much younger, still with dyed blond hair but the breasts are smaller and she looks much like the seniors at Chris&#39; own school. She cups her breasts and feels their weight, she pinches her nipples and she orgasms with pleasure. Then her hand goes down to her stomach. <br />
<br />
The Lady takes Chris along for a ride, as if he prisoner in her body. She pulls off the baby doll dress, her breasts hang free and they are riddled with blue veins and the nipples on the B cup breasts are much darker. The Lady drags herself out of the attic into a house that isn&#39;t Chris&#39;, it is alien and foreign. A small flat and instead of a kitchen it is a very old stove with ring burners on top.<br />
<br />
She pulls out a pair of jeans and a fits a matching black bra to her chest. Chris notices that the hangers aren&#39;t steel or plastic but wooden. There are cars from America but a lot of clunky, old things that Chris guesses are from Eastern Europe, is that where The Lady is from? Somewhere they speak Polish or something instead of English? She pulls on a faded Micky Mouse shirt that clings to her breasts as she walks down the road to the local McDonalds. <br />
<br />
In a language that was Russian or Polish she ordered a bunch of hash browns, pancakes, McMuffins and coffee. Chris smelt the coffee through her nose and it was toxic. Soon Chris was vomiting and throwing up in the toilet. She had a shower and Chris examined her tits, definitely sorer than his previous viewing of them. Her Mickey Mouse t-shirt was feeling tighter than before. Chris was having to go to the toilet a lot more. Finally she unhooked her bra and sighed has her breasts hung loose. <br />
<br />
Her jeans were tight around her waist as she finished her business. She notices that there is a slight bump around her belly button. The Lady looks in the mirror and smiles, Chris smiles. Chris is starting to feel horny as her vagina is extra moist. Rubbing her clit she settles down to watch a movie a war flick. But it is about the Red Army, Chris dimly recognizes it from some history lesson. She watched a talent show about Russians signing badly Western songs.<br />
<br />
Slowly, although more rapidly than a normal pregnancy, her belly grew. At first she has to part her breasts to see what is happening but slowly it is exceeding her breasts. At least four center meters after the break came on. The Lady suddenly has a need to go to the toilet. The urge to pee is rapidly growing in urgency is on one occasion she nearly wets herself. Another show comes on, a hospital drama, as she notices that she can&#39;t see her feet when even propped up. <br />
<br />
An hour later the next show comes on, some Putin Red Army.<br />
<br />
Moaning again, she struggled to unfasten her belt, her belly was heavy enough to hold her down.  The Lady was a little worried, but not panicking, figuring that the chemical was just not digesting correctly and that her belly was bloating out.  A louder gurgle emanated for her aching belly, this time she felt the fabric of her jeans tightening and finally, the button snapping open.  Looking down, she saw her belly was quite big now, almost like she was 5 months pregnant.  Placing her hand back on her belly, she felt how tight, heavy and round she was getting.    <br />
<br />
She placed both hands on the sides of her gravid belly, feeling it grow warmer and heavier with each passing second.  The brood of life inside of her began to move, slowly at first but then quickly and aggressively as her belly gurgled, moaned and stretched out in all directions.<br />
<br />
The gurgling noise returned, but it was much louder than it had every been.  As her belly gurgled, The Lady felt and saw her abdomen stretch outward, her growing girth pushed the zipper on the front of her jeans down, her belly creeping out from under her strained shirt.  When the growth ceased, she saw, what looked like, a belly 8 months pregnant attached to her frame.<br />
<br />
 She took a deep breath, felt her brood kicking inside of her rapidly, her tight flesh riddled with bumps, dents and bulges, a sudden pressure built up in her belly and then...  It stopped!<br />
<br />
Chris is highly confused, this is like something coming on like a B grade horror movie. But then the scene dissolves and The Lady has a big bump and is sweaty from labor. She has had a miscarriage and as The Lady cries so does Chris. She flashes back to the baby doll dress that has the parting in the middle. A clear memory of her starring at her bump comes into her mind along with her name: Anna.  <br />
<br />
As she weeps for her lost child Chris weeps with her. Anna will have another baby, finally the memory lets go of Chris and he now knows more than he ever wanted to know about being a woman. He knows of a single piece bathing swimsuit that had an extra room in the front of the swimsuit for the bump. Chris knows what his next purchase will be.</p>
