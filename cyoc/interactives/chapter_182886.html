<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">On a normal day like any other, a father and son pair were jogging back from a day at the gym. The Father, 40 year old Dan was a perfect specimen of a man. He weighed 225, but it was all made of pure muscle which were clearly visible in his shirt and jeans. His son, the 16 year old Mike, wasn&#39;t far behind. At 185 pounds  he was quite the muscle man himself although not much was too visible in his shirt and sweats. The two of them soon decided to take a break and that was where they met him. &quot;Good afternoon, my good men. Can I offer you a little magic show in these trying times.&quot; Dan and Mike wanted nothing to do with this, so they tried to ignore him. &quot;I beg your pardon, but did you hear me?&quot; the Magician asked again. &quot;Sorry dude, but we don&#39;t believe in the bull shit!&quot; Mike snapped back, clearly annoyed that the man couldn&#39;t take a hint. &quot;Oh my, that&#39;s no good! Magic is such a wonderful thing. I must show you its wonders. &quot;Look, we don&#39;t need to see your stupid bunnies, so can you just leave?&quot; Dan said back as he started to get annoyed himself. &quot;Oh, no. I don&#39;t do silly parlor tricks like that. My magic is much more grand than that.&quot; &quot;Gonna cut yourself in half then... Or maybe pulled something out of your shit mouth!&quot; Mike snapped back. &quot;Oh my, you don&#39;t seem to believe me at all...&quot; the Magician replied, his voice getting a little darker. &quot;Look, if you want to trick someone else, then not your self out, but were not interested, got it! Let&#39;s go, son.&quot; &quot;You heard the man! Hope the spell that can make you fuck yourself goes well.&quot; &quot;Heh... Come now, Mike. Let&#39;s just leave the crazy fucker alone. Not like he can hurt us,&quot; Dan said as he and Mike walked away. The Magician simply looked to the ground and in an icy, cold voice said. &quot;Oh, we&#39;ll see about that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Freezus!&quot; shouted the so called Magician. Dan and Mike waved it off as the ramblings of a madman,  but as they looked straight up, they could see that nobody was moving. &quot;What the hell?&quot; Dan said to himself. In fact, not only was there no movement, there wasn&#39;t any sound either. &quot;Dad?&quot; Mike asked his father, a slight feeling of unease crossed him. It was as if the time had stopped for everyone but them. &quot;So do you believe in my powers now, young men?&quot; Dan didn&#39;t want to believe this was happening. He turned to face the Magician. &quot;Fucker! What did you do?! Drug us?!&quot; Dan went to grab the Magician, but he simply waved his wand at Dan. &quot;Levitatus!&quot; he shouted as a burst of something hit Dan square in the chest. &quot;Guh!&quot; &quot;Dad?!&quot; Dan braced himself for the fall, but his body didn&#39;t hit the ground. Instead he shot straight up, his feet flailing back and forth. &quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Dan was in shock now. &quot;What kind of drug is this?!&quot; &quot;I told you before, this is magic. Perhaps your son needs to experience it himself?&quot; The Magician looked towards Mike. Mike flinched at his icy cold stare as the man waved his wand at him. &quot;Levitatus!&quot; Mike tried to defend himself, but was simply pushed back and started to float off the ground himself. &quot;Holy Crap!&quot; was all he could say as both he and his father moved to the side of each other and in front of the Magician&#39;s person.<br />
<br />
&quot;And no that I have your attention...&quot; the Magician said as he traced his wand over the men&#39;s muscles. &quot;On closer inspection , you both seem to be quite the body builders, aren&#39;t you?&quot; &quot;Fuck you!&quot; Dan spat out. The Magician simply ignored him and set his sights on Mike. &quot;You must have worked quite hard to obtain this body, have you not.&quot; &quot;And... And what if I did, huh?!&quot; Mike tried to keep his composure, but the Magician could see the fear in Mike&#39;s eyes. &quot;You two are merely human. Muscles like these, aren&#39;t so easy to maintain. But with magic, you could have the most perfect set of muscles imaginable... Or...&quot; The Magician let out a toothy grin. He waved his wand and pushed Mike away so he could see face to face with his Dad. &quot;Or you can lose them just as quickly.&quot; He then pointed the wand back at Dan. &quot;Now how shall your Daddy lose his!&quot; &quot;You fucker! Don&#39;t you fucking dare!&quot; Dan tried to show his full anger at the Magician, but he was unperturbed. &quot;A man like you deserves a body to match his overbearing personality. Luckily, I have just the spell up my sleeve! Bodus Expandus!&quot; The Magician waved his wand and hit Dan with another blast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guh!&quot; Dan felt the full brunt of the spell, but it felt different than before. He could feel the magic swirl into his stomach and radiate throughout his body. &quot;Agh... God... Burrrrrppppppp!&quot; Dan squirmed a bit before letting out a loud belch. Mike watched as his father started to grow, but not in height. The muscles that shown through his shirt and pants started to vanish as it filled out his body. The other visible muscles outside started to vanish as fat took its place. &quot;No! Nooooo!&quot; Even these two weren&#39;t stupid enough not to understand what Bodus Expandus meant. Dan&#39;s body was gaining weight and fast. Not even five seconds had passed and all ready Dan&#39;s fat was pushing his stubbier arms and legs aside. &quot;The fabric at the shirt and jeans were already starting to rip and tear. Another few seconds had passed and both shirt and pants exploded off his body leaving his boxers barely hanging on. Another popping sound rang out as his socks and shoes were the next to give, leaving his huge fate feet out in the open. His belly folds were starting to come down as his man boobs drooped with them. A few seconds later, his boxers tore, exposing his massive cock which the belly folds soon covered it up. &quot;Oh my god! Make it stop!&quot; Dan could no longer keep up as the facade as fear overcame him. He must have been over 300 pounds. As his weight continued to increase, his arms splayed more outwards and his legs inwards. He could barely see past his own man boobs as his upper body fat started to hide more of his arms and legs underneath its massive folds. Mike watched in horror as his Dad continued to grow. He looked like a balloon. Now over 600 pounds, Dan couldn&#39;t even see over his massive upper body, while Mike could see more of his legs and arms sink into his upper body fat. A few more seconds passed and only the stubs of his hands and feet could now be seen. A bit of his penis head was visible underneath his belly flaps, enough to know it was massive as well. Dan must have weighed near 1000 pounds. This would kill any other man, but magic works in mysterious ways. &quot;I think that&#39;s enough!&quot; the Magician said as he waved his magic wand at Dan as he stopped growing. &quot;Oh my! You must weigh nearly 1200 pounds. How do you feel?&quot; &quot;Mmmphhhh!! Fmmmmppphh!&quot; All Dan could let out were muffled cries for help. Apparently his massive weight was covering some of his mouth. Fitting a fat man, he let out a farting noise and proceeded to take a massive elephant dump onto the ground. The Magician waved his wand down as Dan fell down, splashing the shit all over his body and literally cracking the pavement underneath. &quot;MMMMMmmmmpppphhhh!&quot; He let out another muffled cry as his flailed on the ground below. <br />
<br />
&quot;And now that I&#39;m done with you... Let&#39;s see what awaits your son now!&quot; The Magician shouted as he turned his attention to the fearful Mike.</p>
