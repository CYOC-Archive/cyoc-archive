<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Realizing that her and Cheap Fuck’s suggestions were too good to pass up, Pinkerbell decided to use the chronivac one more time before they headed out to the store.<br />
 <br />
“Hang on a second, I think I forgot something,” Pinky said as she rushed back to her room, her lengthy ponytails trailing behind her.<br />
<br />
Upon reaching her desktop, she quickly reopened the chronivac and navigated over to her roommate’s tab. Opening the clothing settings revealed Cheap Fuck’s current casual outfit to be a rather standard t-shirt and jeans.<br />
<br />
“With a name like yours, I’d expect something a little more unique in the wardrobe department,” Pinkerbell chuckled to herself. “Let’s change that, shall we?”<br />
<br />
She went to work adding the changes that she had suggested to Cheap Fuck, including the heeled sandals, diaper, tight bikini top, and bowl hat. She also altered her hairstyle, deciding to make her completely bald as to not have anything interfere with her headwear. All the while, she made sure that the reality setting was on so that everything seemed normal and only she noticed the changes.<br />
<br />
“Damn F-cup! People are going to love the new look!” Pinkerbell said proudly as she navigated over to her own tab.<br />
<br />
Twirling one of her bright pink ponytails with her finger, Pinkerbell thought back to what her roommate had unknowingly suggested for her change in appearance. She loved her new name and hairstyle, but she couldn’t resist trying something else new and outrageous while she had the opportunity. She found a place to save her current profile for later use and began with the alterations. <br />
<br />
She started with the physical changes, first enlarging her already massive F-cup breasts to an even more ludicrous G-cup. She then went for the hair, exchanging her twin ponytails for a large frizzy afro, which she spiced up by turning a striking shade of cyan. Though she was far from done, Pinkerbell decided to inspect the changes in the mirror she had hanging in her room.<br />
<br />
“This is so bizarre,” she gasped as she ran her hands through her new hairdo to confirm that it was really attached to her scalp. It was some the biggest hair she had ever seen, nearly twice the size of her head. She shook her head around as a test, causing the giant orb to bounce around on her noggin, but it never seemed to lose its perfectly curated shape. <br />
<br />
“Not that I’m complaining about the results or anything,” she smiled confidently as she cupped her new breasts, which were now distending her shirt even further than they were just a moment ago. She also took note that her eyebrows were now the same color as her new hair, which made her curious. A quick peak into her panties confirmed that all her body hair had taken on the same greenish-blue shade.<br />
<br />
Knowing she didn’t have much more time until Cheap Fuck got impatient, she went back to the chronivac to finish up her changes in apparel. She took all her roommate’s wacky clothing selections into account as she made the adjustments. <br />
“I’m going to need a different name to match this new look,” she said as she studied herself. “Pinkerbell just doesn’t seem to make sense anymore.”<br />
<br />
After a brief moment of thought, she cleared the first and last name boxes, typing in Afrotica and Booblicious respectively. She then decided to include one last touch to her new look by adding a tattoo of her preferred nickname “Titty B” on her chest in bold intricate lettering. <br />
<br />
“Much better,” Afrotica remarked as she inspected her final appearance in the mirror. She was now free of all undergarments and any social pressure to wear them, with the only article present on her lower half being a tight and ridiculously short white skirt that just barely obscured her lady bits. Her gargantuan tits hung loose on her chest with the closest she had to any cover being two little strips of clear Scotch tape pressed tightly against her large nipples. Though she still retained much of her original appearance, the new hair, outfit, and breasts made her look like the fusion of a clown, a porn star, and Lady Gaga. <br />
<br />
“I think this will be satisfactory attire for my trip to the market,” Afrotica said jokingly, making sure to shut down the chronivac as she exited her room.<br />
<br />
“Is her highness Titty B finally ready to head to the store?” Cheap Fuck asked with mock annoyance in her voice.<br />
<br />
“That’s no way to talk to your queen!” Afrotica joked back as she entered the kitchen and received her first glimpse of her changed roommate. The wardrobe shift was just as she had described to the chronivac with Cheap Fuck now only clad in a light blue bikini top that squeezed her B-cups tightly and a form-fitting, yet puffy, white diaper. She had already put on her 6-inch heels, which elevated her from her regular 5’6” to nearly 6’, and was pulling out an orange pasta bowl from the cabinet, which she proceeded to place on her smooth, hairless cranium. She was just about to snap back with another retort when she caught a glimpse of Afrotica.<br />
<br />
“Um…aren’t you forgetting something?” Cheap Fuck asked with a puzzled expression on her face.<br />
<br />
“Uh…” Afrotica stammered, afraid that the reality setting had malfunctioned somehow.<br />
<br />
“Your bow?!” Cheap Fuck burst out. “Earth to Titty! The thing you almost never leave the apartment without?!”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah,” Afrotica said with a sigh of relief. “How could I forget about something like that?”<br />
<br />
She went back into her room and searched through her dresser until she found a drawer devoted exclusively to giant glittery bows of various colors. She selected a shiny red one and pinned it in the center of her afro before grabbing her keys. Just as she was about to return to the kitchen, a distinctive chime came from her computer. Afrotica clicked on the flashing icon and discovered it to be a notification from the chronivac.<br />
<br />
“CHRONIVAC VERSION 4.1! NOW AVAILABLE ON MOBILE! NEW FEATURES AND SETTINGS! DOWNLOAD ON APPLICATION STORE USING THIS CODE!” blared a mass of flashing letters.<br />
<br />
“That could useful,” said Afrotica devilishly. “Wouldn’t hurt to have this handy on the go.”<br />
<br />
She turned on her phone and entered the code into the search bar of the app store, which led her to a hidden page for the chronivac app beta. Without hesitation, she quickly downloaded it and locked the chronivac and her computer before rejoining her roommate in the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Honestly Titty B,” said Cheap Fuck. “Sometimes I wonder if there really is a brain under that ‘fro.”<br />
<br />
“That’s why you’re the brains and I’m the looks,” Afrotica smiled as she jiggled her monstrous bare tits in Cheap Fuck’s direction.<br />
<br />
“You’ll never stop showing off, will you?” smirked Cheap Fuck as the bizarre duo exited the apartment.</p>
