<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took a bit, but he finally found the stairs going down to the basement. As he ran a hand through his short blond hair, Ryan stared down into the darkness, suddenly wondering if traipsing about in some darkened basement was such a hot idea. But, remembering that they were searching for candles and anything else that might be cool to take with as a souvenir, he grinned roguishly, a look that had driven a number of girls crazy and gotten him several dates, and started slowly down the steps.<br />
<br />
When he heard door swing close behind him, Ryan reached into his inner coat pocket and withdrew a torch he always carried with him. Thinking, &quot;Well. Guess I don&#39;t really need to look for candles,&quot; he clicked it on. Clutching it in his hand, he pointed it ahead of him as he continued down the steps.<br />
<br />
At the foot of the steps, he found himself in a dusty, cobwebs covered hallway. Without really giving it much thought, he choose a direction and began walking. When a stray cobweb caught in his hair or on his face, he swiped it away, concerned with the idea getting dirty. At the age of sixteen, he was already six foot two and weighed in close to two hundred fifteen. Working hard at keeping himself in top shape, he was the star quarterback of the local high school team. He could have his pick of any girl, and he usually did. And when he grew bored of them, usually after he had sex with them, he ditched them for the next catch.<br />
<br />
If they happened to complain, he laughed it off. He told everyone of his greatest, and everyone believed him, especially as they could see how good he was on the football field. This helped with his image that he was type that did no wrong, said nothing bad, and he helped sell it, not caring who he hurt in the process, with most being the girls he dated and dumped. Smiling at this, brushing more cobwebs from his surfer cut style hair, he thought, &quot;Life is good,&quot; as he considered how everyone, even Jonathan, looked up to him.<br />
<br />
When he came to a door, he paused and shown his torch on it. The door appearing to be old and splintery with a black latch-like handle, Ryan noted it was a track, like it rolled. Grasping the latch, he tugged on the door, but it didn&#39;t budge. Rattling it, hearing something on the other thump against the door, he stepped back and commented, &quot;Huh,&quot; before turning away and stating, &quot;Waste of time away. Probably nothing in there anyway,&quot; he continued down the hall, shining the light ahead, sometimes over the walls, a couple times up into the exposed floor joists, but usually before him.<br />
<br />
When he found another door, this one set in the wall, Ryan didn&#39;t expect it to open and trying the latch-like handle, he was surprised when it opened easily. The flashlight beam revealing another hallway, this one looking older, as the walls appeared to be made of grey. crumbling stone, the sixteen year old stepped through the door. Taking a couple steps, he shown the light over the walls and ahead. Not seeing anything worth it, he turned back and found the door had shut. Looking for the handle, and not finding one, he exclaimed, &quot;What kind of moron installs a door with a door knob on one side,&quot; and pressing on the door, thinking his strength would help him force his way through, he was disappointed as all he managed to do was make a series of grunting noises and exerting himself.<br />
<br />
Displeased with such an outcome, Ryan glared at the door. Considering trying to kick it done, he sighed, &quot;Lazy and sloppy craftsmanship,&quot; and decided that there was nothing he could do. Turning away, he started down the hall.<br />
<br />
The walls never changing, he soon began to grow bored and wanting something, anything, to happen, he thought, off a bit, it looked like there was a flight of stone steps going up. Not wanting to return to the main level, but deciding that if he did, he would find the stairs he&#39;d first gone done, he hurried to the end of the hall and up the stairs two at a time. Coming to another blank wall, he swore and slammed his fist down on. Hating the notion that he might be trapped, he started to look for the possibility that there might have been a handle and it had been removed, then, when that didn&#39;t turn up anything, he put his strength into it and began pushing on the door. Creaking open slowly, almost as if it was caught on something, Ryan wrinkled his nose at the smell wafting through and thinking it stank like a barn, he squeezed his six foot two muscular frame through, figuring the sooner he was out, the quicker he could find his way back.<br />
<br />
Dry and brittle straw crunched beneath his shoes and worried about stepping in something, the teenage boy shined his light first onto the stone floor. When he didn&#39;t see anything that he&#39;d regret stepping in, he began to move the light in a sweeping arc, taking in the five stalls and the unused appearance to everything. Taking another couple steps, he was startled when something in a nearby stall moved and edging closer, he nearly screamed when a beautiful redheaded woman, completely naked, stepped in front of him. Regaining his composure, trying to not to be obvious in that he was staring at her C cup boobs or her shave crotch, Ryan tried to play it cool by saying, &quot;Hey there gorgeous. What&#39;s a beautiful thing like you doing out here? And without any clothes?&quot; in his usual tone that got girls by the dozen to fall for him.<br />
<br />
To his surprise, two more women, one brown hair, the other blonde, and both naked, stepped of the stall. Thinking it was his lucky night, Ryan gave them a rakish grin and watched as the two began circling him, touching his shoulders, ears and his face every so often. As they did this, the redhead stepped closer and, all to aware of where his eyes kept drifting, she purred out, &quot;You&#39;d like to take up? Bend us to you will? Wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Completely head over heels that such a beautiful woman was throwing herself at him, Ryan, still grinning, nodded and told, &quot;Yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re hear to please you. To be used. Then to be discarded. Nothing more than a trophy for a fine stud,&quot; the other two whispered and completely enamored, Ryan dreamily uttered, &quot;Right on,&quot; and as the redhead leaned in to kiss him, he missed the dark look that passed between the three.<br />
<br />
&quot;We going to have some fun,&quot; the redhead purred and as Ryan nodded, he started to reach up to grab hold of her, but stopped, when she told him, &quot;Not like that. No. I think, first, you are going to keep quiet until we tell you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan, a grin still on his face, tried to ask, &quot;How will it be fun if I cannot talk?&quot; but found his voice didn&#39;t work.<br />
<br />
The redhead, who had started to grin maliciously, purred, &quot;Good,&quot; before she whispered, &quot;Every command either I or my sister gives, you will follow,&quot; to which Ryan nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; the redhead stated again and peering intently, she told him, &quot;Strip.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan, unaware of the looks that kept passing between the three sisters, thought it was best thing a woman had ever told him. Eagerly, he set the torch to one side, and removing his clothes, he watched as the blonde tossed them into the nearest stable. His erection on full display, he was disheartened when brown hair began to laugh and point at it. Wanting to demand to know what the hell was so funny, he was taken by surprise when she abruptly grabbed his erect shaft and told him, &quot;You cannot pleasure us with such a thing,&quot; to which the redhead purred, &quot;We need something, bigger,&quot; and as the brown head started to stroke him, stopping to fondle his balls every so often, Ryan watched in amazement as his cock and nuts tripled in size. Still working at it, it was only a matter of seconds before Ryan was amazed to see that he no longer had a human dick and balls, but a huge horse cock, fully extended out of sheath, complete with a pair of ponderous horse balls.<br />
<br />
The blonde stepped forward and as she teased the tip of his new appendage, she purred out, &quot;I&#39;m first. You may take me the way a man takes a woman. But you have one stipulation. You may not cum until I do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Unsure how such a thing would be possible, his need for release growing, Ryan shifted his weight as she suddenly jumped up and straddled him. Her legs wrapped tightly around his waist, the teenage boy briefly thought, &quot;This isn&#39;t so bad,&quot; before the blonde began to rub against his horse cock, stimulating her and bringing him closer to release.</p>
