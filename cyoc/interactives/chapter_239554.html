<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of the bigger parts of Animalia&#39;s Christmas celebration was the &quot;Great Snow War,&quot; and much of which they adopted from what they learned on Humanity&#39;s history and the Christmas Truce that occurred at various places along the Western Front in 1914. To Animalians, the fact that a major war could just stop, if only for a day, fit more with the spirit of peace that was part of the world&#39;s Christmas celebrations. And since Lyre, Nevada was far enough north to get some snow and close enough to some of California&#39;s ski lodges, Animalia could also import snow for one of the big parks that was there between Lyre and Animalia to serve as the battlefield. Kids, Human and Animalian could enjoy the fun of a big snowball fight with mock trenches and plenty of outdoor fun, and this would last through the daylight hours from December 1 to December 25. It was also largely limited to those in elementary school for the full-on participation in the &quot;Great Snow War,&quot; but there were moments that included older students.<br />
<br />
As per tradition in Animalia, a group from WSA&#39;s high school would act out an edited version of what sparked World War One and have two get hit supposedly &quot;dirty&quot; snowballs to then spark the big snowball fight. WSA&#39;s history teacher and the theater coach continued to help coordinate the opening act to assure &quot;accuracy&quot; and &quot;quality&quot; in the performance for the actors that played out the roles for the start of the &quot;Great Snow War.&quot; The big thing that was different was that the Quasi-Raccoon Cuties had come from Heiya Island for a bit of a look into things for the Great Snow War, given that they didn&#39;t have something comparable on Heiya Island. But clips from the event always ended up making it onto Animalia&#39;s website and thus drew curiosity from Heiya Island. That in turn led to some changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of this doesn&#39;t quiet look like the Western Front,&quot; Tani commented as she filmed over the field and noted that much of the snow that was being brought in for the &quot;battlefield&quot; was being packed and built up to look like a sort of mountainous peninsula that covered most of the field.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... given some of your curiosity and visit, we&#39;ve actually changed a few things,&quot; the WSA history teacher spoke, &quot;the start to the snowball fight will be the same, and of course the staged treaty day on Christmas Day will be the same. But we&#39;ve set some things that we hope might be a bit more... intriguing to a more Asian audience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And that would be?&quot; Naya wondered as she looked over the works and noted the men moving and packing snow from trucks.<br />
<br />
&quot;To set the battlefield like it was the peninsula in China in which the Siege of Tsingtao was fought... I believe the modern city name is actually Qingdao,&quot; the history teacher explained, &quot;and it would show that the First World War actually wasn&#39;t just limited to Europe. There was fighting that took place in other parts of the world... though the siege in history ended in November with the Japanese and British securing the peninsula and the German protectorate while its fleet fled.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be interesting,&quot; Date commented, &quot;though... Asia&#39;s involvement didn&#39;t come until after the war started in Europe, and from what I know... they weren&#39;t involved in things like the Christmas Truce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True... but that&#39;s also a bit where we&#39;re putting a bit more theater into this as well,&quot; the theater coach answered, &quot;as the real war was nowhere near as tame as a snowball fight. But we agreed to show a theater of the war that might be more recognizable to your audience while keeping to the &quot;Great Snow War&#39;s&quot; own traditions for our local kids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So... how will the peninsula line work?&quot; Tani wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re looking to have the peninsula take up most of the field so that there is room,&quot; the history teacher answered, &quot;but by stated rules, anyone that goes outside the &quot;battle zone&quot; that is being set up to be edged by ridges will be counted officially as leaving the field. And some of the same health and &quot;babysitters&quot; will be tasked with helping enforce that rule, as we can&#39;t really do &quot;amphibious landings,&quot; and want to make sure there is no cheating. Anyone who throws a snowball at some who has left the battle zone will also get a time out as well, the length will be determined by where the snowball lands and so on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of which is a standard rule that has been there with the &quot;Great Snow War&quot; from the beginning,&quot; the theater coach.<br />
<br />
The three nodded at that, as that made sense. They then nodded to Tani who then pressed the stop button for the phone they were using. They&#39;d have a few days to edit things for their coverage on the Great Snow War. Most would go for viewing at Samurai Prep and on Heiya Island and would need to include Japanese and Chinese subtitles. There had also already been some jokes on the bits that they would eventually send to Malice for publication on the main Animalia Ambassadoria page having English subtitles, but they chose not to go there.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The following days went in a fairly routine manner, though, for the Quasi-Raccoon Cuties, they did try to get as much as they could to show what the kids in Lyre/Animalia enjoyed about the “Great Snow War.” In some ways, it actually had them moving like war reporters, though, more like more modern field reporters rather than those that actually covered World War I. Much of it was often to ask questions on the kids participating in the &quot;Great Snow War.&quot; Much of it related to seeing why the kids got involved, how they picked teams, and if they knew anything about the history that went along with it. This in turn lead into their own sets of odd cases...<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you a little old to be in the game?&quot; one Human child asked while hanging his backpack on a bike ramp post. <br />
<br />
Tani noted the height of it was for some of the various specialty bikes that had been built for Animalians that were larger than Humans. It was a metal frame and had various small pieces that looked like they could hold things like backpacks and had also been swept clean so that there was no snow or ice on it. And the kid that Tani approached wasn&#39;t the only one have this idea, as they all seemed to be interested in what they saw as a game after school. There was a male Cat Animalian that was also there.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not in the game, I&#39;m Tani, the Quasi Raccoon Cuties,&quot; Tani explained, &quot;we do something like Animalia Ambassadoria on Heiya Island. We want to cover things that relate to the game and why so many kids play.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cuz it&#39;s fun,&quot; the Cat Animalian said innocently while the Human child checked his gloves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, they make sure the snow is strong enough to stick together and soft enough so that it doesn&#39;t hurt,&quot; the Human boy added, &quot;so... who wouldn&#39;t want to run around in the snow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the big kid&#39;s acting to start the game is fairly fun to watch,&quot; the Cat Animalian commented, &quot;but not as fun as the game itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Tani spoke and looked up to some of the other adults that were in the area. Some looked like they might be part of Animalia&#39;s PD or other emergency services. None had any weapons or cuffs, which Tani assumed they were more there for the various rules that the History Teacher and the Theater Coach had discussed with them earlier.<br />
<br />
&quot;And that&#39;s why the two of you are in the game?&quot; Tani asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; both cheered, though the Human boy added, &quot;or at least until mom is done with her Christmas shopping. She says I&#39;m not to come home till she gets me, or Santa won&#39;t give me any presents.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The most telling interview was that Date had come on a weekend and had its own adventure, though one that related more to the chosen gear. Things in Lyre/Animalia weren&#39;t necessarily super cold through December and the improvised peninsula did need maintenance during the day when the kids were in school and at night on the weekends, but they were generally cool enough that without things like a jacket or long pants, a &quot;chill&quot; could be felt. And many kids often had colorful jackets and mittens or gloves. The youngest ones often had cartoon characters on their jackets and so on. <br />
<br />
As a Japanese Raccoon Dog Animalian, Date had her winter coat in, and it was long enough that she did not need a super heavy jacket. Though she was amazed by some of the things that the kids put on for the Great Snow War. One Human girl that was playing came out in a big pink jumpsuit that looked like it was made of some kind of weatherproof synthetic material. It was like a set of poofy overalls as cotton, or whatever that was used for insulation made it look bigger on her. The girl then looked to Date and wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not cold?&quot; the girl asked, &quot;or wet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Raccoon Dogs... or Tanuki, if you&#39;re wanting to go by a shorter name, can endure cooler climates,&quot; Date answered, &quot;and I&#39;m not going into the field, so things aren&#39;t too wet for me. Though they might get a bit wet for you... at least while things have been fairly warm over the past few days.&quot;<br />
<br />
The girl gave a broad grin, &quot;that&#39;s why I got my snow suit. It can handle wet snow and my boots can too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you came prepared for today,&quot; Date surmised, &quot;you out to impress anyone?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m out to get my brother, he&#39;s on the other team,&quot; the girl answered, &quot;and I have a better arm than he does.&quot;<br />
<br />
Date found herself chuckling at that. Despite the pink snow suit, it was pretty clear that this youngster was not the sort that was going to just sit by and be dainty. She kept her camera on the girl as she went up the ladder on the east side of the peninsula that had been made to set the battlefield. She soon collected up a ball of snow that came from the rampart of one of the improvised trench lines on side and then threw it and cheered when the snow hit the shoulder of male Husky Animalian in the shoulder who was only in a pair of shorts and a shirt. Date could then hear as the Husky Animalian gave a theatrical howl and pretended to fall down.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Naya, meanwhile, had some of the hardest efforts in trying to get bits for her part of the video that the Quasi Raccoon Cuties. Ringtails could handle some of the cold weather, to a degree, and all things considered, the December season in Lyre/Animalia hadn&#39;t been too bad. There were plenty of days where the temperature stayed around the freezing point of water, which kept much of the improvised peninsula for the &quot;battlefield&quot; in place. There were moments where more snow was added to keep it from melting away and to assure that the top layer was soft and that no one was throwing ice balls at one another. It reflected a lot of the effort that Animalia put into keeping the &quot;Great Snow War&quot; safe and avoiding serious dangers. So, the temperature wasn&#39;t something that really bothered Naya, and to a degree, neither did some of the water from it was clear that at least some of the snow was actually melting, even if only by a little.<br />
<br />
The thing that often derailed a lot of Naya&#39;s attempts was more that sometimes she was holding the camera for Tani or Date. At other times, when they were using their phones as the camera, Naya ran into other complications. Namely that many of the Human and Animalian kids were able to hurry forward and actually get onto the field. On the day before the Great Snow War closed for the season Naya was determined and after making sure her phone was fully charged; she made to place herself near the west set of snow stairs onto the improvised peninsula that had been set up for the &quot;battlefield.&quot; She would get her interview in and keep it good, though she did worry that some of the &quot;action&quot; that went with the &quot;Great Snow War&quot; was already going on and Naya could hear some of the shouts and squeals from the kids enjoying the snowball fight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me, I&#39;m Naya with the Quasi Raccoon Cuties,&quot; Naya spoke as she held up her phone as a young bird Animalian, Naya thought it was a species of falcon based on its bill, &quot;could I get a moment of your time to ask a question or two?&quot;<br />
<br />
The young Falcon Animalian right by her and only barely responded, &quot;Can&#39;t... we&#39;re in the last days before the official truce and celebrate the coming of peace. I don&#39;t want to miss out!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait! You&#39;ll get a spot to be on TV!&quot; Naya called and actually ran after the young Falcon Animalian, &quot;It may inspire things for Christmas... or related winter events around the world!&quot;<br />
<br />
Naya ascended the stairs fairly easily, hoping that she&#39;d at least get to ask a few questions and cover some of the things they hadn&#39;t already gotten. They&#39;d learned that many of the &quot;team lists&quot; were set up at school and that no one could change teams. But there was still questions on why kids chose a specific team or not, and most had often just said they played because it was fun to run around in the snow and dodge snowballs. So, Naya followed, and while her phone caught some live action shots, her focus remained on the young Falcon Animalian who hopped into a set trench, gave a mock salute to a Human kid and then reached for a snowball for it to matter. Naya also didn&#39;t notice that by entering the &quot;combat zone,&quot; she became a fair target.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I only have a few questions to ask!&quot; Naya called to the young Falcon Animalian, only for a snowball to hit her phone. &quot;EEeeeeeeK!&quot;<br />
<br />
The impact of the snowball startled her before another snowball hit her chest in a practical explosion of soft white powder that left a clear wet mark on the front of her blue turtleneck. The response to all of that was then obvious as she dropped her phone and jumped up and back in surprise. She ended up on her but with her long ringed tail laying out behind her. Not too far from her, she saw her phone. It was still on and lay in the snow and undamaged. She also noted that the Falcon Animalian was on another spot on the &quot;battlefield.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is going to end up on a blooper reel,&quot; Naya sighed in defeat as she got up to her knees and picked up her phone.</p>
