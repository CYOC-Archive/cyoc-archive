<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With plop, April dropped the pound of hamburger she had eating onto the floor and looked about the kitchen, sniffing the air every so often. Inside her mind, she knew that something was off, but unable to smell anything, she was unable to make any connection as to what it was. Letting out a barking-like noise, she began to pace back and forth.<br />
<br />
After a moment, she glanced at the back door and then at the raw beef on the floor, thinking that maybe she should take her meal somewhere more private. Stepping away from the fridge, still sniffing the air, feeling agitated because she knew that she was missing something, April headed for the back door.<br />
<br />
As she moved across the kitchen, failing to notice that she was shrinking and the dress she was wearing began become too big and after a moment, the shoulder straps slipped off of her shoulders, April reached for the door knob and after a few confusing moments as to how such a thing actually worked, she wrenched the door open. Stepping out onto the back stoop, her dress puddling around her feet, she breathed deeply the night air, figuring this was what was wrong; she had been cooped up when she should be outside.<br />
<br />
Uttering a noise of contentment, she dropped down to all fours and sat for a moment, failing to realise that she was sitting on her dress instead of the cement that made up the back stoop. Shifting about, she pushed her arms out before her and as her body let out several cricking noises, she stretched, letting her mouth hang open as she did so.<br />
<br />
Another noise of contentment utters forth and she stands. Sniffing, smelling the raw hamburger behind her, April turns about and not seeing that she was walking on all fours instead of two legs, she headed back into the house. Approaching the fridge, something in her mind telling her to be wary and that the ones with the loud noises resided her, she could smell at least one but its scent was faint, like it hadn't been here in a while, April stopped and glancing about, still smelling the air, she eventually lowered her head to spilled food and began to eat.<br />
<br />
As she did so, her teeth began to push out and as her human teeth gave way to a new set, she paused and once again felt that something was off. Uttering another bark-like noise, she began to pace, stopping every now and then to eat a little more of the beef. When a blinking light caught her attention, suddenly something about it brought her back and trying to say, &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot; April found herself horrified as that issued forth were the noises of a fox.<br />
<br />
A pain in her jaw forced her to utter out another noise and trying to stand, she found that she was unable to do so. Plopping down into a sitting position, April tried to touch her mouth and at first she found herself at a lost as to why her arms simply did not move in the same manner. But in the end, she managed to feebly run the back of her hand across her mouth, her teeth rubbing against in the process.<br />
<br />
Still unable to figure out why she couldn't stand and why her mouth felt so weird, the odd feeling slowly moving up into her nose, April stood and after a couple failed attempts, managed to get a slight grip on walking on all fours. Then she discovered that she had lost her clothes at some point uttering another bark-like noise, she began to pace about, trying to remember when it was that she had lost her dress, stopping every once and a bit to look down at herself, something she found difficult to do and had to lay on her side to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Outside the shift in genitals, the biggest change that she could see, besides that she was unable to walk on two legs like a human was supposed to, was that her pubic hair was now fully covering her from the midpoint of her torso down to about midway down her upper legs and that for some reason, she could not tell what colour it was, as everything for some reason appeared in shades of black, white and grey.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be a boy,&quot; she barked out, standing and then barked out, &quot;And I don't want to be an animal. I want to be me. Whoever I am supposed to be,&quot; as it suddenly came to her that she couldn't remember her own name.<br />
<br />
Glancing back at the blinking light, sure that it was supposed to be red, but noting that it lacked any colour, April looked back at the remains of the hamburger and without giving it a single thought, moved over to the fridge and lifting what was now her back leg, sprayed a dash of urine onto the appliance, marking it as her own.<br />
<br />
Her attention on what she could not rightfully say, she moved away from the fridge, certain that her meal wouldn't be touched and when she reached the cupboard, she received her next shock as it became apparent that at some point she had shrunk. Uttering a noise of annoyance, she looked about and spying a stool nearby, she proceeded to attempt to jump up onto it. After several misses, April finally managed to get atop the stool and looking at the top of the cupboard and the blinking light, unsure what it was coming from, but that it was of some importance, she leapt from her perch and in a clumsy fashion, crashed onto the top of the cupboard a couple feet from the blinking light.<br />
<br />
Investigating it, April suddenly realised that she should probably call somebody, but found herself at a lost as to who she should call and how she would manage to communicate her problem. As she sniffed and thought, her front paw accidentally hit the play button on the machine and suddenly a noise was issuing forth.<br />
<br />
Startled, April back pedaled from the noise, making noises normal for a fox that had just been scared as she did so. And then the cupboard top beneath her suddenly vanished and she found herself falling. As she hit the floor, unable to understand what the person on the machine was saying, the Reynard she was becoming suddenly took over and everything being too much, April streaked out the back door and into the night, failing to notice as she took her leave that the dress she had left on the back stoop had vanished.<br />
<br />
Watching all this from his hiding spot, the fat man smiled in glee and silently whispered, &quot;It shant be long now, my sisters.&quot; as he watched the scared girl-turned-Reynard took off out of the house.</p>
