<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The kids were ready for a break when the Intermission that left the two racers stranded on an iceberg in the middle of the Pacific, rolled on. Deciding from how twitchy some of the kids were, and hoping to avoid Barney peeing in the house, Jeff proposed that they head to the nearby park for a little bit to get some energy out. The moment he&#39;d suggested the Park, Jeff was greeted with the thunder of sneakers eagerly pushing towards the door, excited chatting occurring.<br />
<br />
Using the clapping trick that the school aides in the cafeteria did, Jeff managed to get the kids to respond with their own clap and grew quiet and listened as Jeff explained that they were going to walk to the park holding hands when crossing the street, and being careful to look both ways. Dutifully, they nodded and did as they were told--which Jeff was thankful the sudden reality shift which had allowed him to be the &quot;Den Chief&quot; of the Cub Scout Den they were all a part of made looking after them easier.<br />
<br />
The park was only an easy two blocks walk, and the kids followed instructions rather easily as they crossed the streets to get to it. Though once they were within the confines of the playground they immediately forgot all sense of discipline and ran off in all directions. That is except for Harry, who Tommy had made sure made it to the Park before running off almost thoughtlessly with Ryan and Hannah to go climb on an old set of monkey bars the town had neglected to take down like other towns had. Two other children were present, twin boys who looked to be a year or so older than Jeff&#39;s den of kids. <br />
<br />
Harry for his part now was left to toddle after the bigger kids who were climbing and swinging and doing all sorts of things, but generally not having room for Harry to join in the fun they were having. Normally Tommy or Jane would be sure to include Harry, Jeff&#39;s memories were telling him, but at the moment Tommy was hanging upside down with Hannah and Ryan to see who could hang upside down the longest, and Jane, Joey, and Lizzie had decided they&#39;d like to see who could swing higher. Jeff offered to put Harry in a toddler swing and push, but was met with fussiness as Harry wanted to swing in the &quot;big kids&#39; swing&quot; not the &quot;baby swing&quot;, and when Jeff had tried to give Harry a boost up to one of the lower rungs of the monkey bars, Harry didn&#39;t have the grip to hold on for very long, ending up on his butt in the mulch. Jeff offered then to bounce the ball with Harry, but Harry refused any suggestion that Jeff made, instead deciding if the big kids didn&#39;t want to play with him, then he&#39;d go on the slides by himself--refusing any and all aid or attention from Jeff. Frustrated after a few minutes of trying to please a toddler that refused to be pleased, Jeff retired to a bench on the edge of the playground area.<br />
<br />
Sitting on a bench nearby Jeff and near where Harry was sulkily sliding by himself was an older grandmotherly woman that Jeff recognized as being from the neighborhood, but didn&#39;t know too well himself. She looked at a glance to be related to the twin boys, likely their grandmother. Right now she looked at Harry&#39;s plight with the kind of despair that a grandmother might have for her socially awkward grandchild as he flitted from one group to the other, trying to play with them, but failing each time.<br />
<br />
&quot;The poor boy has no one his own age to play with,&quot; said the woman with some pity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, usually he&#39;s close enough in age with the others that that doesn&#39;t matter so much... but not today it seems,&quot; said Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;If only I were young again,&quot; said the old woman wistfully. It was then Jeff figured, well... she did ask, and he pulled out his phone, loaded the Chronivac and scanned the old woman.<br />
<br />
Name: Rebecca Williams<br />
Age: 72<br />
Mental age: 72<br />
--Memory<br />
----Relationships: Chase Williams (grandmother) & Tyler Williams (grandmother)<br />
Height: 5&#39;8&quot;<br />
Weight: 132 lbs<br />
Build: Almost frail<br />
Gender: female<br />
<br />
Rebecca was a tad older than Jeff thought, which made him think that for being so old, she looked remarkable for her age. She was dressed casually in a pair of rather nice pants and a t-shirt with a simple design on it. Her hair was light gray, her skin was fairly wrinkled--but not to the point her skin was hanging loose from those wrinkles, and her gray eyes had a certain shine to them which denoted at once kindness and compassion.<br />
<br />
Name: Becky Williams<br />
Age: 4<br />
Mental Age: 4<br />
--Memory<br />
----Relationships: Chase Williams (brother), Tyler Williams (brother), Harry Swift (best friend)<br />
Height: 3&#39;0&quot;<br />
Weight: 38 lbs<br />
Build: Thin<br />
Gender: Female<br />
Alter Reality to Fit? Yes<br />
Alter Clothes to Fit? Yes<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed the transform button without a second thought, thinking a moment later of this transformation perhaps as an opportunity for her to have another life and be closer to her grandsons by being their baby sister, in addition to aiding Harry in the here and now. Rebecca&#39;s first signs of her transformation came when she was able to sit with a bit better posture and rely less on the support of the bench. This was soon followed by the light gray hair turning a darker shade of gray, Rebecca&#39;s hands, whose joints had been slightly swollen with arthritis, receded in size and seemed to regain a bit of strength to them. The wrinkles Rebecca had began to smooth over as she left her sixties and re-entered her fifties. Her hair revealed at this point the raven black hair it had once been as it fought with the dark gray for control of her head. As she was more firmly middle aged a suppleness to her body began to become apparent as she stretched her arms and back, which made her re-inflating breasts appear more pronounced as her clothes seemed to shift to more form complimentary towards her body, and less comfortably loose that they had been before. As she left her fifties for her forties and menopause undid itself, Jeff took note that Rebecca&#39;s hair had taken a longer and more voluminous quality to it. She let her curly raven hair down from the quick updo kept in place with a hair clip prior. Her hair fell to about her shoulder blades now and complimented her returning curvy body. Her thirties seemed to come and go just as quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;My nephews can be such klutzes,&quot; said Rebecca with a sigh as she watched the twin boys excitedly trip going up the steps of the playground equipment.<br />
<br />
Rebecca hit her prime when she was in her late twenties, having a look of a sexy soccer mom down pat, Jeff thought. It was a look that wouldn&#39;t last long as she neared her early twenties and her skin became as smooth as silk. Jeff watched as she quickly left her twenties and became a teenager. At this point, her casual clothes looked far more age appropriate, on her body, Jeff observed. Briefly, Jeff recalled Rebecca Williams as this year&#39;s likely valedictorian, per the rumors going around school, but a moment later pretty &quot;Becky&quot; was closer to his own age, and now friends with Alicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff, is it true that you and Alicia are gonna be parents?&quot; asked Becky, whose thin body was growing thinner by the moment--her breasts having already shrunk a cup size, Jeff estimated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did she tell you?&quot; asked Jeff, preferring not to answer just yet--not before Alicia&#39;s mother knew at the very least.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me what? Alicia doesn&#39;t tell me anything...&quot; said Becky as she then became a year younger than Alicia, looking more and more like a beanpole with every passing second.<br />
<br />
As she re-entered childhood, Becky lost the last vestiges of puberty as her breasts shrank into buds and then disappeared entirely. Her casual pants turned into capris, her feet began to lift off the ground, and her t-shirt became more feminine and had a picture of Moana on it. Becky&#39;s wardrobe continued to shift as she grew younger, shorter, and a tad chubbier with baby fat, until at the end of it, Becky was an adorable four year old little girl with baby fat, a pink Disney Princess shirt that featured all of the princesses, and toddler shorts,<br />
<br />
With the transformation complete, Harry looked up and over to the bench where his pal Becky was sitting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Becky! Becky! Becky! Watch me slide!&quot; called out Harry as he practically threw himself down the plastic slide on his stomach as though he were a missile. Unceremoniously, Harry tumbled to the ground just as Becky could no longer watch, but instead got up and ran over to where Harry had fallen. She suggested that they try out the sandbox, to which Harry readily agreed, and soon he was up and toddling with Becky over to the sandbox.</p>
