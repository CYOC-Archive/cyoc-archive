<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley was both relieved an exhausted when they finally finished unpacking their stuff. Him and his best friend Kyle had just moved into their college dorm together. It was small and crowded with all of their stuff, but it would do!<br />
<br />
Riley and Kyle were incoming freshman at their local state university. Both were 18 years old, but they had been best friends all throughout high school. Both of them were very nerdy and didn&#39;t have a lot of friends. They spent most of their time together playing video games or other nerdy stuff. They were both very straight, but neither had ever had a girlfriend, but they pined over the hot girls at school all the time, talking about all the other guys who were dating with jealousy. <br />
<br />
Both Riley and Kyle were not much to talk about in the looks department. They each had medium long brown hair. Riley was a little bit taller than Kyle at 5&#39;8, with Kyle being 5&#39;7. Riley was a little overweight, at about 180 pounds. Kyle was just the opposite; he was very skinny and lanky. Neither one of them had any muscles, as they never worked out or payed sports. Riley, and Kyle especially, had noticeably twiggy arms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Finally, we are all moved in!&quot;, Kyle yelled. His voice was still quite high and boyish. &quot;Yeah, that was a lot of work.&quot;, Riley added; Riley&#39;s voice was a little bit lower than Kyle&#39;s, but he still got mistaken for a woman more often than not on the phone.<br />
<br />
Kyle wiped the sweat off his brow with his hands, and decided to take off his shirt. Riley glanced over and saw Kyle&#39;s bare chest. It was totally under developed and flat. Still, Riley was a bit jealous, as he had a bit of a small belly. Kyle stretched in front of Riley, and Riley spied the very tiny boyish peach fuzz in Kyle&#39;s armpit. Riley had never seen Kyle naked, but it was the only hair he had seen on his friends body. Judging by the non existant bulge in Kyle&#39;s boxers when they changed, Riley suspected Kyle just wasn&#39;t all that developed. &quot;Not that I have any room to talk&quot;, Riley thought. He barely had 10 armpit hairs between both his pits, and they were thin and light. He only had a very small light smattering of hair above his 3 inch penis as well. Riley thought about it a bit glumly; &quot;Well, I guess me and Kyle don&#39;t have much to offer the ladies&quot;.<br />
<br />
As he surveyed his new dorm room, Riley spied a small wooden statue or idol on their table. &quot;Huh, That&#39;s not mine and I haven&#39;t seen that in Kyle&#39;s old room before. Must be new&quot;. He didn&#39;t think much of it and his thoughts quickly changed gears. Little did he know, it wasn&#39;t his friend&#39;s and Kyle thought that it must have been Riley&#39;s.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, did you see all of the cute girls on campus when we arrived!&quot;, Kyle asked excitedly. &quot;Yeah! It would be great if we weren&#39;t so nerdy and we could actually date some!&quot;, Riley added. &quot;Yeah&quot;, Kyle agreed. Just then, Eric, one of the big burly football players walked by their open door. He was shirtless, with his impressive muscles and crop of thick blonde chest hair on display. &quot;Yeah, I wish we were just like that guy! Then we would have no problem meeting girls!&quot; What Riley and Kyle didn&#39;t know, was that Eric wasn&#39;t chasing girls like they had imagined. Not only was Eric totally gay, he was also kind of a slob. The only things he cared about were sports and fucking other guys.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, let&#39;s play some video games!&quot;, Kyle suggested. Riley could think of nothing better to do.<br />
<br />
Riley glanced at the clock; it was already pretty late on their first day. The boys decided to get a good night sleep. They got ready for bed and went right to sleep from all the work today.<br />
<br />
The boys had no idea, but the idol was enchanted. Riley had unknowingly made a wish, and the idol would grant it. As the boys slept, it slowly began to work it&#39;s magic...</p>
