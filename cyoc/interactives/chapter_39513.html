<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you walk into the park, you can feel the stares of the other inhabitants - you can practically feel their envy.<br />
<br />
But their attention isn't only on you. Standing by the fountain, dressed almost as indecently as you are, is another bodybuilder - one that is almost as large as you, and roughly as well-endowed, you notice. You stare at the bodybuilder, taking a moment to decide that this must be your &quot;secret admirer&quot;. It takes longer, however, to realise that you've seen this person before.<br />
<br />
Searching through your memory, you take the last few moments as you approach him, and finally work out that it's the guy, Leon, who sometimes worked out with you at the gym - only, he wasn't anywhere near this big, when you saw him last, a couple of weeks ago. It is then, as he turns and looked at you, that you are certain he has to be your &quot;secret admirer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Leon grins and nods his head. You nonchalantly return the gesture, and then you reach out and grasp each other's hand. You momentarily marvel at the strength in his handshake, and then marvel at your own as you nearly match him in strength. You exchange the standard welcome phrases, and then get down to business.<br />
<br />
&quot;You must be rather disoriented by all of this,&quot; he begins. &quot;As is tradition, I will explain it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tradition?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. You see, those trunks are magical.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured,&quot; you reply with a hint of impatience.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, I responded the same way when my 'secret admirer' said it to me. But just as I had no idea how magical they were, you undoubtedly think that what has happened so far is all there is to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There's more?&quot; you blurt out in curiosity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I understand how you feel, but we won't get anywhere if you keep interrupting me.&quot; You nod. &quot;Those trunks you are wearing hold great power, both amazingly benevolent and strangely mischievous. So long as you own the trunks, life will be... bizarre.&quot; He emphasises that word, with a look making it clear that he's not talking about 'experiencing strange dreams' kind of bizarre. &quot;You probably have already experienced a bit of this... most people tend to have a sexual response to the initial transformation, and it usually first shows itself then. Do you recall anything like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod your head, and blush. What you did after orgasm was certainly odd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't think too much about it. Anyway, that will have been extremely tame compared with what may happen in the time that you own the trunks. I hear that the owner a few turns back from me actually became a werewolf, transforming every night until he passed the trunks to the next owner. And before you ask, no, I have no idea who it was.&quot; You weren't going to ask, but you figured he must have been interested enough to ask when he was told.<br />
<br />
&quot;And these bizarre things only affect you until you pass the trunks on?&quot; you ask, knowing that information like that would have to be gained if any reasonable decision was to be made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; he replies. &quot;As I said, the power is mischievous. Once you pass the trunks on, the power stops affecting you... but you may be left in some unusual condition should you pass it on while one of its mischiefs is in effect. For instance, had the guy I mentioned actually given the trunks away while in werewolf form, he would most likely have been stuck that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
You stare in slight disbelief, before you feel your bicep flex and remember what you'd already experienced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, passing the trunks on. You can't just give them to anyone you feel like. There are rules - you must know the person. You cannot be related, nor can you give them to someone already being affected by a power like it. You cannot hand it to someone in person or let them know it came from you before they put it on, although you can be present for their transformation. If you want to give it to someone, they must choose to wear it for themselves - the trunks naturally amplify any desire to wear them, so even a small desire will result in them wearing it, but you cannot force them to wear it, nor can you trick them into doing so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But most importantly, you have to admire the person. Traditionally, the trunks are sent as a gift to the person, with a 'secret admirer' message attached, but it's not a requirement. I understand that you can be sexually attracted to the person, but any sort of admiration is acceptable, it doesn't actually have to be a sexual admiration.&quot;<br />
<br />
Leon then sits on the edge of the fountain's pool, and looks around, relaxed. You look down and admire his muscles, aware that your own are comparable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do we need to maintain these bodies?&quot; you ask furtively while flexing a bicep, still processing what he has told you.<br />
<br />
&quot;We do, although our genes and metabolism have been altered to make it far easier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will people notice the change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really. They'll look at you, think that there's something different about you, but be unable to put their finger on it. After a few minutes, they'll put it out of their minds, and start simply admiring your muscle. They won't realise that it's the first time they've seen you like this.&quot; He stands up and gets into a 'most-muscular' pose, and his too-tight shirt tears in a number of places. &quot;To them, at most, you'll seem to have gotten slightly larger, as though having come from a workout.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your competitive nature kicks in, and you quickly perform a lat spread, tearing your shirt below the arms and causing your cobblestone abs to become more visible as your shirt raises slightly. You glance over at the bushes, where you make out a young man masturbating as he watches the two of you posing, well hidden but not hidden enough. Earlier in the day, you would have diverted your attention, but now you smile and show him your massive left tricep, while letting him get a good profile look at your package. You hear him groan faintly, and then see him shudder. Smiling, you turn back to Leon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Will the effects ever wear out?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, although we do still age, and if you fail to maintain your body, the effects will fade, until you start maintaining it again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else I should know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sex is amazing with these,&quot; he gestures to his crotch, then to your own, &quot;but there aren't many women who can take the size.&quot;<br />
<br />
You laugh briefly. &quot;Thanks for the warning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, time for me to head home. We can continue to partner up at the gym if you like, but not until you've passed the trunks on.&quot; Leon waves goodbye, and walks out of the park, his walk exaggerated to emphasise his muscles. You pause and admire his shapely glutes, wondering if your own are as well-shaped.<br />
<br />
You sit on the fountain and think about who you could pass the trunks to. A few people come to mind, but there's one person in particular that you'd like to give the opportunity to experience this.<br />
<br />
It's right then that the next &quot;bizarre&quot; effect occurs.</p>
