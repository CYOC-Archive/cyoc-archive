<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the flash&#39;s light began to subside and Paul finished rubbing his eyes, he knew something had changed once again. He could feel that he was still a woman, but different. He looked down and saw his breasts were slightly larger than before, and his clothes had become brighter than before. He found his hair was no longer dyed black as it was more of a natural brown.<br />
<br />
He looked to where his drunk of a mother had been but instead he saw a younger girl. Paul sighed as he quickly guessed what had happened. The little girl who looked about 5 also looked exactly like &quot;Paulette&#39;s&quot; photo in Paul&#39;s room. He guessed his mother had become a young girl. Instead of drunkly screaming, the young Janet looked up at Paul and asked &quot;Mommy, can I have a juice box from the fridge?&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul gawked at the tiny version of his mother. He couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. Him, a mother, to his OWN MOTHER. He felt a little cautious as he placed his hand back to lean on the wall, and his fear at sudden mother hood lead him to discover that the wall felt different. It had been torn and crappy for as long as Paul could remember, but looking at it now, he could see that it looked brand new with lovely blue wallpaper.<br />
<br />
Paul continued to look around and began to truly realize the power he now wielded, as Reality had changed around the entire house. It looked like a well kept home with lots of expensive looking things lying around. Paul&#39;s normal urges told him to steal this shit but he had to remind himself that technically this was his already. He felt a tug on what he assumed was his new dress as he saw his mom/daughter looking concerned.<br />
&quot;Mommy, are you alright?&quot; She innocently asked.<br />
<br />
What Paul then meant to say was &quot;I&#39;m not feeling well you little shit.&quot; but what came out was &quot;Yes dear mommy just had a little spell that&#39;s all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul blinked in confusion and annoyance as his new life had a filter on it that presumably prevented him from talking normally in from of other people. While he thought &quot;F@#$ing great&quot; all that came out was &quot;Of course.&quot; In his new sing song-y voice. Janet shrugged at her mother&#39;s odd behavior and made her way to the kitchen. Paul followed her and then sat down at the counter annoyed.<br />
<br />
He placed the camera down on the counter and stared at it as he was really beginning to regret taking it. He glanced down at his chest and chuckled again. &quot;At least it&#39;s not all bad.&quot; He thought as he squeezed his massive knockers. He heard Janet open the fridge and he spotted something that really peaked his interest. Sitting in the fridge were a couple cans of beer.<br />
<br />
Paul started thinking of a way to sneak one when he realized the he, or rather she, was the adult now. He could drink whatever he wanted. Paul got up and sexily strutted over to the fridge where Janet was reaching for a juice box. He shook his fat ass and managed to hit a juice box with it out of the fridge. Janet giggled as she caught it and ran off to the living room.<br />
<br />
Paul just laughed as he plucked one of the cans out. He made the obligatory &quot;5 o&#39;clock somewhere&quot; joke and was about to open it when he heard the front door swing open. Janet shouted &quot;Daddy!&quot; as Paul&#39;s heart sunk. He turned with some level of hope only to be met with the face of a man he had never seen before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it&#39;s not my dad.&quot; He thought angrily as he put the beer away. His anger was replaced with concern as he put the pieces together and realized who this was supposed to be. &quot;Oh God.&quot; He thought as the man walked over and gave him a big sloppy kiss. Paul wanted to resist but his body betrayed him. <br />
&quot;Hiya honey.&quot; He said laughing. &quot;I&#39;m home.&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul wanted to deck this guy but considering a number of factors Paul decided to play it as cool as possible. While gritting his teeth he managed to say &quot;Hello.&quot; before the man proceeded to go back towards the door and take his shoes off. Paul watched him and had trouble not thinking about murdering him. The man greeted his daughter Janet with a kiss on the cheek and then walked back towards Paul.<br />
<br />
Paul watched him and took note of how he looked. &quot;Damn.&quot; He thought. &quot;If Mom was still Mom then she would be all over this guy. Tall, redhead, tight pecks, cute butt, nice big-&quot; Paul suddenly stopped himself as he suddenly realized how he was thinking. He knew he needed to change back pronto. Who cared if this life was richer, he just wanted his member back.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for Paul, he suddenly realized something bad...</p>
