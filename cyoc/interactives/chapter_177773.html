<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cameron blinked a few times as he stepped up to his cabin. There was no way this was right. The whole cabin he as assigned to was full of college aged jocks. It was evoking the fears of being in a high school locker room all over again, only worse. When he stepped into the cabin their was only one completely unoccupied bunk so he went over and claimed the top bed. At least he could be out of view up there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, boys, listen up!&quot; Came a loud shot from a potbellied middle-aged man entering the cabin. Most of the guys shut up and turned towards the man. &quot;Looks like we&#39;re going to have to go along with this damn camp idea, so just keep your heads down and don&#39;t make trouble for me. Sooner we get this over and done with the sooner we can get back to practice. Who the fuck are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cameron was just trying to unpack, though in the dead silence after the question he felt all eyes on him. &quot;I&#39;m Cameron. Sorry, I just got assigned here, guess this was the only bunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
The coach grunted and threw his own pack on the bottom bed of the bunk Cameron had claimed. Great. &quot;Alright boys, entertain yourselves until dinner.&quot; Some of the jocks were already changing, showing off muscular, athletic bodies that had Cameron trying to find a safe place to look. This was not going to be good if Ellen saw even half of these guys.<br />
<br />
Quickly Cameron made his exit from the cabin. He needed to clear his head. He wasn&#39;t watching where he was going and ran face first into something big and hard. He was met with a tan shirt stretched over a large chest. He felt a large hand fall on his shoulders. &quot;Easy there.&quot; He looked up into the face of Soren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry.&quot; Cameron gulped.<br />
<br />
&quot;No worries.&quot; Soren said jovially as he moved to head off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait.&quot; Soren looked back at Cameron&#39;s word. &quot;Are you sure about cabin assignments?&quot;<br />
<br />
Soren looked at his clipboard and flipped through it. &quot;Yeah, sorry. We had a lot of guys sign up this week and that was the last open bunk. But if you have trouble there, let me know. Maybe I could slide you in somewhere else. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have to much issue.&quot; Soren smiled as if he knew some secret.<br />
<br />
Cameron wandered the camp until dinner, which went just as well as he expected. He met up with Ellen but she was completely distracted the whole time but the bulk of the baseball team eating at another table. &quot;Think we could get one of them to join in a threesome?&quot; She asked, not really caring what Cameron thought. He just felt cold in the bottom of his stomach.<br />
<br />
He begged off after dinner to go lay down. Not that there was anything going on that night, and the camp seemed suspiciously light on staff. Maybe they&#39;d get here in the morning. He couldn&#39;t sleep though, not with the ruckus going on in the cabin. It already smelled like a locker room in there. In fact, it was as bad with half those men walking around completely naked, their junk swinging around in front of them.<br />
<br />
Cameron lay on his bunk with his arm over his eyes, trying not to think about it. Luckily the other guys seemed to forget he was there. Eventually Coach Patrick, he had learned the name from the jocks talking, came back smelling of an ashtray and collapsed in the bunk under him.<br />
<br />
This was going to be a nightmare weekend, but eventually he drifted off to sleep.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck happened?!&quot; The squeaky cry roused Cameron from his sleep. It was still dark out, but the first light was starting to creep in across the sky. He glared balefully at the mouse sitting naked on the other bed in the cabin. Wait, weren&#39;t there supposed to be five bunks? No.. counselor cabins had only two beds. Bunks were in the camper cabins.<br />
<br />
Though Cameron would never know his cabin mate was a counselor without being told. Or maybe he would, but the mouse wasn&#39;t exactly an imposing figure. Five foot four at most and covered in gray fur, he was slim and twinkish. His mop of hair was dyed a bright blue which at least made him stand out a little. He had fished his glasses off the nightstand and put them on to stare at himself disbelievingly. It was just Cameron&#39;s luck he&#39;d get partnered up with a scrawny nerd for the weekend. Wait, what was he thinking? He was a scrawny nerd.<br />
<br />
Patrick, though something in his brain wanted to call him Coach Patrick as if the mouse had even played a sport much less coached, looked to be on the verge of a panic as he patted himself down.<br />
<br />
Cameron felt dizzy for a moment. Something definitely wasn&#39;t right with him, or with there being a human sized mouse in the other bed. Slowly he sat up and stretched his arms. The mouse looked at him and his mouth dropped.<br />
<br />
Why was the squirt so shocked? Cameron looked down at himself. He knew what to expect from his own body, but at the same time he was surprised at what he saw.</p>
