<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I have one more wish…&quot; Said Kelly &quot;I wish we will now live each other lives, and be even happier that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Our bodies started to change, each soon looking exactly like the other did seconds ago. The transformation made me shred my cloth, and the previous Kelly to loose the remainders of his.<br />
<br />
Then new memory flooded our minds. I now was officer Kelly Butz, a late blooming centaur that, until today, was a mounted policewoman. Yesterday was my day off, and got a magical ring after helping a stranger. I then tested it by undressing a random sexy-man I soon discovered to be Luc Dubois, my sibling-like best-friend. (You CAN&#39;T imagine how ashamed I was I didn&#39;t recognize him sooner!)<br />
<br />
This same day, after making his cloth reappear on him and apologizing profusely, we made plans for today. We were supposed to play street-magician, in the hope it will help me with the ring&#39;s magic. Instead, my butt finally decided to become equine-shaped. (You&#39;ve taken your sweet time, butt!)<br />
<br />
Off course, I remember the truth. That when I still was Luc Dubois when I got the ring. That before today centaur didn&#39;t exist, Kelly was older, and we certainly weren&#39;t friend.<br />
<br />
When the new memories were finally absorbed, I wished my childhood friend to be dressed in an undamaged version of his magician outfit. That was just in time, since as soon he was clothed again, captain Mathieu Headless appeared with my new uniform in his arms. Ashamed by my current nudity I tried to hide my chest behind my arms, my face probably entirely red.<br />
<br />
My captain seemed happy I finally changed. &quot;It&#39;s good to see my key officer finally get the keys of her destiny!&quot; He joked. &quot;Here, your new uniform. I asked Staci to put the spare-ones on top of your locker.&quot; Seeing I wouldn&#39;t take it, still trying to hide as much of my chest as possible, (which wasn&#39;t much) he handed it to Luc. &quot;You know what? As soon as you&#39;ve got Sam back in his stable, you got the rest of the day off!&quot; In a last-second through, he added. &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t forget to seek the blacksmith to get horseshoes! I don&#39;t want you to damage your brand new hooves.&quot;<br />
<br />
He then spoke to Luc. &quot;Fast thinking here, lover-boy. You did a fine job, a shame you&#39;re not one of us!&quot;<br />
<br />
After the captain&#39;s departure, I finally took the time to dress. The only notable change between humans and centaurs uniforms is about the bottom part: The four legged policemen are wearing a saddle and no pants. (Which is more coverage than most centaurs, since we usually don&#39;t cover the horse-like part of our body AT ALL.) The rest of it is just a centaur-tailored version of it&#39;s human counterpart.<br />
<br />
My saddle mostly looked like the one on Sam&#39;s back, but got two big pockets on it&#39;s front part, placed to each side, in a way that make them easy to reach by me. It also featured oranges markings, signaling I wasn&#39;t used to have someone riding my back, and my rank. Except that wasn&#39;t the right rank.<br />
<br />
When I handed it lo Luc, needing help to wear it, I asked him if he didn&#39;t see anything strange about it. For a micro-second of search in his memory from when he was me, he was able to point to it. &quot;It&#39;s the sign of a chef officer, not of an officer.&quot; And then added &quot;But the rest of your uniform too, mark you as a chef officer.&quot; I didn&#39;t pay attention to it before, but it was true.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that explain was he came himself.&quot; I responded. &quot;But it doesn&#39;t explain how he forgot to inform me…&quot;<br />
<br />
We still decided to go seek the blacksmith. I was in need of horseshoes, after all. Upon seeing me, his first words were &quot;I knew Captain Headless wouldn&#39;t call only to speak of your promotion! Congratulations are in order, chef officer Butz!&quot;<br />
<br />
After thanking him for both my shoes and congratulating me, (policemen&#39;s horseshoes are paid for by the government) we got back to Sam. We were surprised to see part of the crowd still there, waiting us. Upon our return, they applauded us, acclaiming Luc for his fast thinking and his willingness to help me, and congratulating me on both my tardy change and being promoted.<br />
<br />
My equine partner, for his part, was in the care of another centaur woman. As I approached, I remembered her from my short-lived magic-show: she was that pregnant woman in the crowd. (Kelly&#39;s wish to not be the only centaur must have changed her.) At first, I believed she wasn&#39;t pregnant anymore, but I then remembered that, as a centaur, her baby was now in her horse belly. Said belly being bigger, it wasn&#39;t truly surprising that her baby-bump was less visible. &quot;How long?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Six month already.&quot; She responded, looking melancholic. &quot;I know how improbable it is but… I truly wish she will turn out to be a centaur.&quot; Before adding, grinning &quot;And you? Do your boyfriend plan to magic a baby out of you anytime soon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who? Luc?!? But he&#39;s my childhood friend!?!&quot; I blurted out, blushing so much I probably was redder than a tomato.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your brain might think so, but your body seem to want a piece of him, if you catch my drift.&quot; She teased. &quot;Want it rather strongly, I might add.&quot; If it was possible to blush more, I probably would have.<br />
<br />
Wanting to clear my ideas, I took Sam&#39;s Rein to take him back to stable, but then remembered how he jumped on Luc when he still was Kelly. Sensing my sudden fear, the pregnant centaur tried to calm me. &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry, you know. Even if your rump look equine, you don&#39;t interest him. Your pheromones are still human.&quot; A little search in my new memory said as much. Even if some of my features now looked equine, technically speaking, I still was a perfectly healthy woman.<br />
<br />
Wanting to do something to thank her, since she cared for Sam, (even if she teased me) I wished that like she dream of, her daughter will effectively turn out to be a centaur.<br />
<br />
Later, after Luc and me safely took Sam back in his stable, he decided to take me cloth-shopping. After all, nothing in my wardrobe fit me anymore. And even if I was now able to walk, or even trot safely, at the time I still kept forgetting the new size of my butt and how far away it now was. Thankfully navigating a shop hallways, even when they were maid with centaurs in mind, is a good way to correct that.<br />
<br />
- – — – -<br />
<br />
It was now the end of the day. Luc and me were about to go our separates way, and I was unable to NOT think about what the expectant mother said to me, or the fact my captain keep thinking Luc was my lover. We looked at each other a last time before separating, and then…</p>
