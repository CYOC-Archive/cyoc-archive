<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Christ I was hasty with that one. Tried my best to edit it, but I had to change so muuch just to get it legible. Sorry!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">For the past few days your new mind and body never truly was yours. You were locked up, deprived of space to move and explore, and constantly drunk on a heady mixture of lust, anxiety, and sheer confusion. Now, as your ears filled with the sound of your own galloping hooves, all that was stripped away, and you could finally think and move freely. <br />
<br />
You pulled out of the shaded woods you were hiding in and onto an amber-lit field in early dawn, able to fill your lungs with fresh air for the first time. It stunned you into a slow trot, a smile emerging with your first taste of freedom. <br />
<br />
“What’s going on?” Jess said with a panicked pat to your neck. “Have you spotted some…”<br />
<br />
Again, you didn’t need to be told twice. You whinneyed an apology, as you pushed across the great expanse of green, your heart thumping with growing fear, covering the thump of yet more hooves.<br />
<br />
“Don’t stop!” Jess said, grasping at your mane. “Please don’t stop.”<br />
<br />
It was getting louder and louder, harder and harder to ignore; dozens of hooves rumbling like distant thunder barely covered by your newfound terror. You pushed yourself, each stride like a leap in this new body, throwing yourself forward, so hard it was starting to hurt, but you couldn’t stop. Moments later the horde emerged from the forest behind you, losing the cover of the underbrush, spilling out with a roar. <br />
<br />
For a moment you went blind, the roar filling your mind with invasive carnal images, but you shook it off, your vision pulled back to reality, and onto your pursuers. You only caught a short glance, but it was all you needed. <br />
<br />
There were six riders in pursuit, still a ways off but getting closer, led by a monstrous wall of blackness, a huge horse you had never seen before so dark it drank the light. Though you couldn’t place how, and you certainly didn’t see her, you can feel that Vicky was there, among them, taunting you, her voice is perceptible amidst them. It made you feel weak, but pushed you into a newfound speed.<br />
<br />
“Run baby.” Jess cried, as the chaser’s whoops and hollerings drew closer. She was holding on so hard it was like she was trying to whip your mane off, forcing you to flinch your head. Her hands slipped, and soon you can heal her clinging onto your body, wrapped around it as she bounces with each thump. She was slipping, you could feel it, her weight dragging you down, but there was little you could do, and things were getting worse.<br />
<br />
You could feel the start of your change, your humanity returning. The adaptive effect Vicky told you about was true; Jess’s presence was turning you human, and you could feel it. You were smaller than you were yesterday, weaker too, and your previously voluminous lung capacity was starting to fail you too. <br />
<br />
You pushed yourself, neighing into a very human scream, as you thundered your hooves into the Earth, but it was no use. It was happening. You were reverting.<br />
<br />
This was it, you were going to turn back human, right here, just when it was the most inconvenient. You were doomed, doomed in the most poetically succinct way possible.<br />
<br />
There was a pain on the side of your neck, like it had gotten caught on something, yanking you out of your mental spiral and pulling you to your left. You whined at your captors, looking back towards them, but as you did you noticed that they were actually still a ways off. <br />
<br />
You careened into a forest with a crash, twigs and leaves scratching as you re-entered the treeline, pushing through a wall of leaves. As you sank through the foliage the last thing you saw was Vicky’s face atop the black beast at the back of the group.<br />
<br />
“Sorry.” Jess said, trying to pull herself up your body. “I’m slipping, don’t stop.” It was her that pulled you to your side, and all you could do was just deal with it and press on, looking back only to find it wasn’t entirely necessary.<br />
<br />
The first of the horses emerged into the woodland with a crash, stumbling into a fallen long with screams of both animal and human. It was a brutal sight, the humans reduced to flying torosos and flopping limbs, and at least one horse colliding with the ground so hard it was reduced to a red mess. You felt your heart rise in your chest, slowing enough for Jess to re-mount you, only for it to sink again. <br />
<br />
Vicky burst in, her beast ploughing through the others. You sped up again, hooves thumping harder and harder as you dove through the forest.<br />
<br />
Your strength was returning, allowing you to push on with newfound speed as you dodged trees and rocks, heading for the light on the far side. You pressed on and on, diving past birch trees with a grunt, the humanity fading as the beast narrowed the distance. You didn’t look back, didn’t dare, but from the way your body was behaving you needn’t need to; you could already tell it was too late. <br />
<br />
Vicky’s horse pulled up to you, the two of you side by side, the chief bitch taking a relaxed pose. It was a game to her, a fucking game, her smug grin boasting her victory, bristling with a smooth confidence. She was maintaining pace with you without even exerting herself, the branches and saplings bouncing off her monster.<br />
<br />
Up close you could more than see the stallion, you could feel him. While she radiated confidence he radiated sheer sexual lost, his pale blue eyes  glowing through the darkness.<br />
<br />
“You&#39;re gonna have to pay, Princess.” She shouted with a smile over the sound of hooves. “For the lost horses and riders. He is gonna put some replacements in your cunt,” She explained as she stroked the monster&#39;s mane, “and little ‘Jess’’ is gonna put some in mine. We’ll be sisters!”<br />
<br />
She was laughing. You were trying so hard it felt like you were sanding the inside of your lungs, but to her this was nothing.<br />
<br />
The monster pulled in, bumping into you. He was fiery hot, and the mere contact was making you feel weak, your loins glowing with arousal. In your mind he was pushing his cock into you, pushing that massive member up to the hilt, your body crushed beneath his. Even in your mind it felt good, but it was hard to focus on that and keeping pace while Jess was screaming.<br />
<br />
A second scream (and a branch to the face) brought you back to reality. Jess was already half off you, Vicky pulling her down your back as she pulled away. It was liberating to say the least, and you could already feel yourself pulling away, as the sunlight neared.<br />
<br />
“I’ll come back for you!” Vicky said. “You might be able to outrun me alone but, but you won’t be a horse for much longer, and I’ve hunted everything else in here before!”<br />
<br />
“Please!” Jess screamed, grabbing onto your tail. “For the love of god, please!”<br />
<br />
You looked back one last time, as the monster started to slow down, Jess dangling by a thread. The great dark creature was thrashing against Vicky as she tried to reign him in, lust in its eyes, singularly focused on you. If you didn’t think fast, you were going to lose Jess again, but anything you did would only put you at risk of him.</p>
