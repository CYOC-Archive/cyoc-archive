<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Martha did enjoy having tea with Melissa Stovall, as the Mayor&#39;s wife had been very friendly wanted to her while they talked and even updated her on how Eric and Julie were doing. She felt very glad that he was doing well and that he and Julie looked like they were destined to be together. It warmed her heart that her youngest son wouldn&#39;t go through high school as a social outcast. She was also thankful for William&#39;s return and his comment that neither she nor William would push their son into becoming a were. If Eric didn&#39;t want to be a were, Martha would fight for his right to remain a normal human being. The fact that if Eric and Julie stayed together and ultimately married the little weremermaid would mean that Eric would have to become a were was lost to them both for the moment.<br />
<br />
However, by this time, Melissa had looked across the room to the clock on the DVD player and noticed the time and she stood up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to have to be going,&quot; Melissa spoke with a soft smile, &quot;but thank you very much for the tea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;I&#39;m actually pleased to be able to make friends in a new town and get a positive update on Eric. I&#39;m glad he looked well with Julie.<br />
<br />
Melissa nodded and handed her cup to William while Martha walked with her to the door. The two walked quietly and Martha did open the door for Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to do something like this again,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;maybe you could bring Martin and we could introduce you to Nate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Melissa nodded with a friendly smile and headed out.<br />
<br />
With that, Martha returned to the kitchen to refill her teacup. She found that William was collecting a glass of water from the tap, and the cup that Melissa had been drinking from was by the sink. As she began to fill her teacup William engaged her in conversation.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, Eric&#39;s on his date?&quot; William asked, assuming that Melissa Stovall&#39;s presence had to do with their youngest having a real date.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Martha nodded, &quot;She came by to drop off Eric&#39;s backpack and we had some tea.. which is where we were when you came in. Did you have a good day? Samantha told me that Miss Smith plead guilty at the hearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She did,&quot; William nodded, &quot;Or rather her attorney did. And with that she&#39;ll be out of our fur.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha smiled in response.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;we can fully settle into Moon Lake with out any worry of threats...&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded and both set their drinks down to briefly hug. Martha found herself purring into William&#39;s chest and William stroked her back. As they broke apart, Martha collected her teacup and began to walk back through the living room and toward the stairs. William collected his glass of water and followed. As they walked, William continued to answer the question that Martha had asked about William&#39;s day. She hoped he would have an update on the tests and the study material she&#39;d need.<br />
<br />
&quot;Much of the rest of the day was pretty quiet,&quot; William answered, &quot;all my classes today were pretty much a free hour because of the hearing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha figured that made sense as they began to climb the stairs. However, she still had to know about the prospect of the tests.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you talk to the Dean about my taking the tests?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
Martha heard him sigh, but he did answer.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; William answered, &quot;and I talked with the Education Department on that matter as well. I got some good news and bad news... or rather frustrating news. The school can&#39;t arrange for a special taking of the PRAXIS exam for teachers in Washington State. That will have to wait until the spring to summer when the test is normally administered. The Dean did make mention that he could schedule a proctor to come down specially for the state issued tests, and I am sure he will do that, but he mad no specific mention of when he he would do that... though he also said you&#39;d need to study for those tests...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and I did have good fortune on the job front... the school district was more than happy to have another substitute on staff... and while they&#39;re good for this school year, a spot will be opening up in the next school year, but I&#39;ll need to get my certification updated.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The PRAXIS test will have to wait until next spring,&quot; William reminded her as they reached the top of the stairs, &quot;nothing can be done with that, but the other tests could be administered earlier, depending on what the Dean can do with regard to scheduling those tests. And I did get study guides for them, but the Education Department won&#39;t have the guides for THIS school year ready until closer to when those tests are administered and all I could get were last school year&#39;s study guides.&quot;<br />
<br />
William then held up his briefcase, which he was still carrying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Martha admitted, &quot;When I talked with the school district&#39;s superintendent, he made mention that they will directly require those test scores by April and information that the PRAXIS test is scheduled by May. So if need be, I might even able to wait until this school year&#39;s study guides are ready... but with if you did get some study guides, I&#39;ll have something to start with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the Education Department did say you could take the tests again if need be,&quot; William said to her as they made their way into the bedroom, &quot;They also gave me a study guide for a test that&#39;s specific to Moon Lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded. At the elementary level, she didn&#39;t need that test, but she had figured to take that test just to know what she&#39;d be in for. The report that William had given was good and would be helpful. It may not be perfect, but all things considered it made good sense. It was a good update on William&#39;s day, and made it clear that his day was successful. And while she got ready for her date, she figured she&#39;d update William on her day as well. He&#39;d likely be changing to get into something more comfortable that what he&#39;d worn to teach in, so they&#39;d be in the bedroom for a little while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it sounds like you had a good day or at least a productive one,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you got hired... I&#39;d imagine so did you,&quot; William chuckled as he finished the water and was soon stripping off his clothes. &quot;How did the rest of your day go?&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha smiled, &quot;Quite good. The best news is that I have some clothing that fits the new me and fits perfectly.&quot;<br />
<br />
William looked over to see Martha standing next to the bed in her underwear with the more formal clothing that she&#39;d been in laid out on the bed. Unlike the night when they had sex together as weres for the first time, her bra and panties fit her perfectly and from what William could see from the black lace that made up them very attractive to his eyes, and he felt his body responding to the sight. Martha then spun around in a circle to let William see that there was a purpose built hole in the back of her panties with the top being a piece of elastic that would stretch to let her tail grow out, and the hole wasn&#39;t big enough that he couldn&#39;t see  her butt through the hole.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a shop downtown called &quot;Awareness&quot; and it serves to our needs,&quot; Martha said with a smile, catching the scent of her husband&#39;s arousal.<br />
<br />
&quot;And it looks like they had good things for female weres,&quot; William said with an obvious smile as he collected tee shirt from the closet and then moved to put on a pair of jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;More than just females,&quot; Martha smiled as she began putting on a short sleeved blouse and the skirt that she had bought there. They weren&#39;t formal, but were nice enough and would give her the ability to show off some of her new clothes to Samantha and Frances. &quot;They have a male section as well. Come Saturday, we can go down and get you some underwear, pants, shorts, and attire that will be able to shift with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; William answered as he finished pulling on his jeans and was ready to relax a little from the day, &quot;but I suppose you&#39;ll need to be going for date night. Anything fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The END of the night will be,&quot; Martha smiled, &quot;but Frances apparently had a stressful afternoon. The &quot;date&quot; probably won&#39;t be more than just having dinner and catching up how our afternoons went.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see... well, hopefully things go well,&quot; William answered, knowing that tonight would be the Twist&#39;s turn in the system that he and Martha had arranged, &quot;and maybe let them know on the alternating schedule that we were thinking over... see if they think that&#39;ll work for giving you everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded. That was part of their agreement for how their marriage would work. Both of them loved each other, and thanks to William&#39;s bond as a werefox to Martha, the problems that had been their marriage were rapidly healing. It was healing far faster than either could have hoped for. However, the fact that Martha as a werecat had come to terms with being bisexual had meant that their marriage couldn&#39;t really go back to the way it was. William was still handsome to her, and as a werefox, he was becoming very sexy with his human form. He seemed to be a master of pleasing her in bed, between his skills and the large piece of male equipment between his legs. Becoming a werefox had done all that to him, and Martha loved it, but being bisexual, William wasn&#39;t the only one she desired sexually. Her bisexual nature made women attractive to her as well and Martha had no intention of repressing that side of herself anymore. To balance that out things, Martha had the Twists, the ones who had turned her into a werecat in the first place. It lead to her and William coming to an understanding of a very open relationship between them in which on one night, she would have William all to herself and the next night, she&#39;d have the Twists. All parts of her would be satisfied. The only thing that they hadn&#39;t been able to make official was to let the arrangement either be made official with Frances and Samantha.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can,&quot; Martha told him, &quot;Though mostly... I&#39;m hoping they like my outfit as much as I can smell that YOU like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
William glanced down at the bulge in his pants. Even fully dressed he couldn&#39;t really hide that and he gave an embarrassed chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m sure they will,&quot; William smiled while they prepared to leave the bedroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... will you be okay on your own tonight?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; William answered, &quot;Eric or Nate will be home eventually... and I can see how their days went... maybe think over new lecture ideas... and if need be put on the football game.&quot;<br />
<br />
They made their way back down the stairs and as Martha made her way to the door, she looked back to her husband. She watched him smile to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure you&#39;ll be okay?&quot; Martha asked him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go... go have a purrrrrrrrrrrrfect evening,&quot; William urged, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p>
