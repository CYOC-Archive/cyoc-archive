<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dr. Morgana had a pretty nice home even though it was small. A quick tour showed that it had a living room, dining room, kitchen, two bedrooms, one full bath, a play room, and a home office. The play room and office were in the finished basement while the rest were on ground level. You were allowed to explore your bedroom and the play room while Dr. Morgana fixed supper. Your bedroom had two beds with pink bedding and a bedside table between them. On the table was a pink lamp. The closet held a variety of dresses, skirts, and blouses. The dresser had panties, socks, tights, pants, shirts, and shorts. The play room had almost everything a little girl would want to play with. There was a couple dollhouses, a table with a play tea set on it, a play vanity table, a chest with clothes for dress-up, and many board games along with many dolls.<br />
<br />
&quot;DINNER'S READY GIRLS,&quot; Dr. Morgana called down to you. &quot;BE SURE TO WASH YOUR HANDS AND FACE BEFORE YOU COME TO THE TABLE.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn't want to get in trouble so the two of you did as instructed. Sitting down at the table you saw that Dr. Morgana had fixed home-made lasagna. &quot;I'm allergic to tomatoes,&quot; Sally said looking a little afraid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh don't worry about that,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;You no longer have that allergy so you can eat this. I hope both of you like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love lasagna,&quot; you said happily. &quot;It looks really good Dr. Morgana.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dr. Morgana sighed and said, &quot;Rachael I need you to start calling me Mom or Mommy. If you don't you could expose us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Expose us?&quot; you asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want to tell you this since I didn't want to scare you but you need to know,&quot; Dr. Morgana said with a sigh and a shake of her head. &quot;I know both of you read over the non-disclosure agreement. You know that if anyone finds out about this that's not part of the program you can go to jail for life or you could disappear. This project is a black secret project. It's way above top secret. This means that it isn't just you that would be disappearing but everyone involved with the project. How we'd disappear I don't know. Now in order to avoid being exposed you two have to act like eight year old girls and call me Mom or Mommy. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; Susan said nodding.<br />
<br />
When you volunteered for this you didn't think that a little slip would doom everyone involved in the project. Dr. Morgana was a nice woman and you didn't want to think what could happen to her to make her disappear. You took a breath and said, &quot;Yes... Mommy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that's better Rachael,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;You need to get rid of the pause though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said making an effort to call her Mommy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now to teach you how to communicate with each other,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. There was a beep in your ear and &quot;Incoming Call&quot; was floating before your eyes. &quot;Accept the call,&quot; she said smiling. &quot;There should be an &quot;Accept Call&quot; button that you can see. All you have to do is will that button to be pressed.&quot; You easily did and then you heard Dr. Morgana speak without her lips moving and she said, *Well done you two. Now to talk back all you have to do is think what you want to say.*<br />
<br />
*Like this?* Susan asked.<br />
<br />
*Yes,* Dr. Morgana said.<br />
<br />
*This is really neat,* you said amazed that you could speak like this.<br />
<br />
*We're in a conference call,* Dr. Morgana said. *When you will the call center up you will see three buttons. They're &quot;Audio&quot;, &quot;Images&quot;, and &quot;Conference&quot;. Activating either &quot;Audio&quot; or &quot;Images&quot; will bring up a list of contacts. You just select the contact you wish to call. &quot;Conference&quot; brings up the same list but you can select multiple contacts then choose &quot;Send&quot;. I have an incoming call so I need to disconnect. You can continue to talk to each other without having to call since you're already disconnected.*<br />
<br />
You saw a message pop up saying that &quot;Mommy&quot; had disconnected. *You still there Susan?* you asked.<br />
<br />
*Of course,* Susan replied. *Are you starting to think that there's something more to this than we know?*<br />
<br />
*You bet,* you said. *What do you think it is?*<br />
<br />
*I think that they're trying to develop this for the military,* Susan said.<br />
<br />
*Makes sense,* you admitted. *But they could test this with military personnel if that was the case.*<br />
<br />
*Point taken,* Susan said. *But what other reason could there be?*<br />
<br />
*I don't know,* you admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok that's enough for the calls,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;I can see when you're calling someone but I can't listen in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok Mommy,&quot; both you and Susan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now if you're finished eating it's time for your bath,&quot; Dr. Morgana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had a bath earlier,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It wasn't a regular bath,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;You need a bath where you get clean. Now if you're done it's bath time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both of you go to the bathroom and take your clothes off,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;I'll be in to draw your bath after I put the dishes in the washer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we take our clothes off?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well take them off like you would any other clothes,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;This will help keep the secret. Now go on you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... do you expect us to take a bath together?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you two are sisters and it will save time,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;Now get going before I have to ground you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; you said as you scampered off to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Once in the bathroom Susan asked, &quot;Why are you so shy about taking a bath together? We're both girls and we've already seen each other naked.&quot; She was taking her clothes off as she talked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was a man before,&quot; you said blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Susan said nodding. &quot;Well that's the past now. You're a girl now so you don't have to be shy. Now are you going to take your clothes off yourself or am I going to take them off for you?&quot;<br />
<br />
You sighed and said, &quot;I'll take them off myself.&quot; You sat down and started to take your clothes off. Suddenly you realized that there was a pressure building in your bladder. You just had your shoes and socks off so you quickly pulled your pants and panties down then climbed onto the toilet and barely sat down before you started peeing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh now I have to go,&quot; Susan said as she grabbed your pants and panties and took them off. &quot;Don't forget to wipe after you're done.&quot;<br />
<br />
You got off the toilet once you were done and Susan quickly got on it. After she was done she got off and flushed it. You had taken your shirt off and stood there blushing. Finally you ask, &quot;You don't mind if I was a man before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why should I?&quot; Susan asked. &quot;Are you going to do anything sexual with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God no,&quot; you said stunned. &quot;I would never do anything like that with a little girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I was a woman before,&quot; Susan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But when I see you I only see a little girl,&quot; you said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And when I see you I only see a little girl,&quot; Susan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's your point?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;My point is that we're both girls now,&quot; Susan said. &quot;Neither one of us have any sexual desires now. We're sisters now and it's normal for us to see each other naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; you said as Dr. Morgana came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Dr. Morgana said. &quot;Now it won't be long and your bath will be ready. Would you like a bubble bath?&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked at each other then back at Dr. Morgana and said, &quot;Yes Mommy,&quot; together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Dr. Morgana said smiling. When the water was the right temperature she plugged the drain and added the bubble bath. &quot;Alright in you go.&quot;<br />
<br />
You quickly got used to the idea of taking a bath with Susan and had fun. You didn't mind Dr. Morgana washing your hair and scrubbing your back. Finally it was time to get out and you were wrapped in towels and taken to your room. Dr. Morgana had brought a hairdryer in and soon your hair was nice and dry. After getting your pajamas on Dr. Morgana said, &quot;Now get to sleep. We have a full day tomorrow.&quot; She gave each of you a plush doll and kissed you on the forehead.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you think we'll be doing tomorrow?&quot; Susan asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe learning more about what we can do,&quot; you said and yawned. &quot;We'll just have to see.&quot; You quickly fell asleep holding the doll Dr. Morgana said. You just did it not thinking that it made you look like a little girl.</p>
