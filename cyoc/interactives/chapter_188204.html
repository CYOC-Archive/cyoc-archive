<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;There are some other things that are going to change around here too, Sam and I want you to hear it from me first...&quot; Sheila continued.  Sam raised an eyebrow as his mother reached an arm around the waist of the big grizzly animorph next to her as the grizz placed a dinner plate-sized handpaw on his mom&#39;s furry shoulder.  Sam&#39;s sister, Cindy, also walked around to the other side of the kitchen and even reached down to grasp Bajoo&#39;s other enormous handpaw in a show of solidarity.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Bajoo is going to be moving in with us from hereon out,&quot; his mother said with a smile.  &quot;Yay!  That&#39;s great news!&quot; cheered Cindy, clapping her clawed hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?  That&#39;s insane, Mom!  He&#39;s basically a zoo animal.  You don&#39;t even know him.  He might like, you know, maul us or something!&quot; Sam protested.<br />
<br />
Sheila frowned.  &quot;Don&#39;t be racist, Sam.  Bajoo is a sweetheart.  Besides, since your Dad left us there hasn&#39;t been anyone around to act as a good male role model for you.  If Bajoo wants to help my little bear cub grow up into a responsible young bearman then I think that&#39;s a good thing, don&#39;t you?&quot;  Sheila paused to collect her thoughts.  &quot;Anyhow,&quot; she continued holding Bajoo tighter, &quot;it&#39;s about time I moved on with my life and started dating again.  Bajoo has been more kind to me these last twenty-four hours than your father was in our last five years together.  And I don&#39;t mind saying that we&#39;ve had more fun together too,&quot; Sheila said with a giggle as she playfully scritched Bajoo&#39;s furry butt with her fingerclaws. <br />
<br />
Sam had been unconsciously sniffing the air throughout their conversation and he suddenly detected a spicy odor coming from his mother&#39;s direction.  &#39;AROUSED FEMALE BEAR!&#39; his brain yelled at him.  &quot;Ewww, Mom.  That&#39;s disgusting,&quot; Sam moaned feeling grossed out upon realizing his mom had feelings for the big furry beastman.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No way, Mom.  I&#39;m not okay with any of this,&quot; he said crossing his arms with finality.  &quot;Bajoo could never replace Dad.  He&#39;s not even a human being!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sam should take Bajoo&#39;s scent like good cub.  Then Sam learn his place in our den,&quot; Bajoo said stepping forward.  &quot;Don&#39;t touch me!&quot; yelled Sam as he swiped at the animorph with his fingerclaws.  Grabbing Sam&#39;s forearm and with hardly any effort whatsoever, the grizzly bear pulled Sam toward him until the teenager&#39;s face was buried into the thick furry shag of Bajoo&#39;s wide bear belly.  &quot;You sniff Bajoo and learn Bajoo scent,&quot; the bear explained.  &quot;Then you get calm and we talk more.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Unable to remove his face from the bear&#39;s chest fur, Sam was getting a direct hit of the same thick alpha bear musk that had helped trigger his change while he was asleep the night before.  &quot;Mmmmfff!&quot; Sam cried trying to speak as he began to violently shake, his body going haywire as the virus began to reactivate in his system.  With each whiff of Bajoo&#39;s fur from his blackening nose the teen&#39;s bearish instincts began to kick in.  He could tell from Bajoo&#39;s scent that this was a powerful alpha bear who he could not and should not challenge, yet in some odd way this bear also smelled a bit like him.  Like a bolt of lightening Sam&#39;s brain suddenly made the connection between Bajoo&#39;s rich musky odor and his own growing bearish musk.  Bajoo had been in his room last night and it was Bajoo who had changed him!  His covers and sheets were wet because he&#39;d absorbed who knows how much infected grizzly bear cum from this animal!  For a moment, Sam tried to push back against Bajoo to yell in fury at the animorph holding him but the bear&#39;s strength was too much and instead Bajoo just pushed Sam&#39;s face further into his plush belly fur. <br />
<br />
Sam&#39;s head swam in the aroma of his captor as he absorbed the knowledge that Bajoo&#39;s cum had changed him.  It was almost as if Bajoo were Sam&#39;s sire and Sam were his cub, the actual offspring of the big furry beast&#39;s seed.  After all, what had his human father ever done for him other than disappoint and abandon him?  It would had been better if this bear were actually his dad.  Besides, the animorph was better-looking than his balding and fat absentee father anyhow.  Sam felt himself grow excited at the thought that maybe one day he&#39;d be as tall, furry and fierce as the great grizzly bear who had made him what he was.  Who wanted to grow up to be a man when you could grow up to be a bear?! <br />
<br />
Feeling the bulge of Bajoo&#39;s sheath and balls through the fabric of his clothes, Sam also began to wonder if he too would become well-endowed with a big thick animal sheath.  After all, he was still transforming, wasn&#39;t he?  The teen&#39;s cock slid out of its own semi-sheath and Sam became rock hard as he fixated on the idea that he&#39;d one day have something like Bajoo&#39;s dick between his legs -a great big beast cock for making little cubs of his own.  Sam curled his toeclaws in pleasure at the thought while a trail of lush trail of tan fur began to slowly creep up from his pubes to connect with the tuft on his chest.  There was now an unbroken carpet of bear fur from between his pecs down to the teen&#39;s furry balls, and a tingling along Sam&#39;s rib cage offered the promise of more to come.<br />
<br />
&#39;Why had he ever fought Bajoo?&#39; Sam wondered. The bear had just wanted to make him better than what he was before.  Sam wrapped his arms around the bear and began to hug the brute, giving into new instincts as he nipped and nuzzled Bajoo like a young cub showing affection.  Finally, Bajoo released his hold on Sam and the teenager was able to remove his face from the grizzly&#39;s belly shag to catch his breath.  His eyes glazed over with adulation, Sam gazed up at the bear with a smile plastered on his now furry muzzle.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry...Papa Bear,&quot; Sam apologized.  &quot;You just wanted to help me.&quot;  Bajoo just smiled in return and accepted Sam&#39;s apology in the most authentic way possible -he licked the boy&#39;s big black bear nose with his long pink tongue as he began to groom his cub.</p>
