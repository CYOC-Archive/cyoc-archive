<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Dana fled to the locker room she could feel her body continue to change.  Her muscles continued to grow, and  her body continued to stretch taller.  Her gym shorts fell off of her body as her widening hips and thickening thighs tore them apart.  By the time she reached the gym, she was completely nude.  She walked up to the mirror in the locker room to examine her new body.<br />
<br />
In the mirror she saw a tall Amazon, with enough muscle to put the largest male bodybuilders to shame.  Her arms were so thick with muscle and her chest was so wide, she couldn&#39;t cross her arms.  Her thigh muscles were as thick as tree trunks, and their wide girth forced her to stand with her legs spread far apart.  Dana had always wanted to be a little taller and have some more muscle.  But not this much.  She looked ridiculous.<br />
<br />
What the hell happened to me? thought Dana.  I was supposed to be irresistible to Kelly. Not turn into some freaky muscular monster.<br />
<br />
Kelly suddenly bounded into the locker room.  Kelly hadn&#39;t realized just how big she was until Kelly entered the room.  She found herself actually looking down at Kelly, and realized that she was now several inches taller than her.  Dana tried to cover up her nude body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, don&#39;t look at me!  I&#39;m hideous, &quot; said Dana.<br />
<br />
Kelly just continued to stare at her with jaw dropped.  She slowly approached Dana&#39;s nude body. &quot;Oh my, no.  You are not hideous.  You are spectacular.  The most gorgeous creature I have ever seen, &quot; said Kelly, as she began to rub her hands over Dana&#39;s powerful thighs, prominent abdominal muscles, and thick biceps.<br />
<br />
Then it made sense to her.  This is what Kelly found irresistible.  A large powerful woman.  It was logical that was what she would find attractive. After all, that was what Kelly was striving to do with her own body.  Dana had thought that her wish would have changed Kelly&#39;s mind to find Dana&#39;s body more appealing, but instead it had altered Dana&#39;s body to fit Kelly&#39;s desires.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m too big. I look ridiculous, &quot; said Dana.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, no, &quot; said Kelly.  &quot;If anything, I think you would look even better if you were even bigger.  I think that would make you really sexy.&quot; <br />
<br />
Dana&#39;s body suddenly began to expand, growing taller and thicker all over her body. Kelly let out an excited gasp as she watched Dana grow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, stop!  You have to stop thinking about muscle.  I used your wand, and now I&#39;m turning into your fantasy girl.  Every time you get excited thinking about me growing muscle, I get bigger, &quot; said Dana.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with that?&quot; said Kelly.  &quot;Bigger is better.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, not everyone  feels that way.  I think I&#39;ve grown quite enough.  If I get too much bigger, I wont be able to live a normal life.  As it is, I have no idea how I am going to do my job, drive a car, find clothes....hell, I may not be able to fit through the front door of my apartment, &quot; said Dana.<br />
<br />
Kelly scoffed.  &quot;You worry too much.  You should just relax, and enjoy the magnificent body you have been blessed with.  Really, I just wish that you loved your body as much as I do, &quot; said Kelly.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Kelly&#39;s eyes went wide.  Dana saw that look, and knew what she had planned.  They both ran towards Kelly&#39;s bag, and grabbed the wand at the same time.  They struggled and fought over the wand, each pulling hard on the handle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just give it to me.  I&#39;m not going to do anything bad.  It&#39;s mine anyway, &quot; shouted Kelly as they struggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!  I have already changed enough!  I don&#39;t want to become any more of a freak! &quot; shouted Dana, as she tried to pry it from Kelly&#39;s grasp.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, they heard a loud snap.  They both stopped struggling, and looked a the wand in their hands.  It had snapped in two, and each had a half of the wand.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!!!&quot; shouted Kelly in anguish. &quot;The wand is broken! I&#39;m stuck like this forever!&quot;<br />
Kelly sat down on a bench, and put her head in her hands and began to cry.  Dana was a little surprised.  She thought that Kelly wanted to look like that. Why wouldn&#39;t she?  In her mind, Kelly was beautiful.<br />
<br />
&quot;There,  there.  It&#39;s not so bad, &quot; said Dana, as she sat down beside her and patted her gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t understand.  I didn&#39;t always look like this.  Before I used the wand, I was ... different, &quot; said Kelly.  For some reason, Kelly didn&#39;t want to mention that she used to be a young teenage boy.  She liked Dana, and wanted Dana to like her, too.  Being a boy before seemed embarrassing for some reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think I understand. I didn&#39;t always look like this either, &quot; said Dana, running her hands across her new Amazon body.  &quot;I can&#39;t say that I am exactly thrilled about how I turned out either.  But it could be worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly continued to sob softly.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Kelly, look at me, &quot; said Dana, as she lifted Kelly&#39;s head up and looked into her eyes.  &quot;It could have been a lot worse for you, too.  But look at you.  You are young , beautiful ......&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly scoffed at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, really. You are beautiful.  More attractive than you know.  And you are loved, &quot; said Dana, smiling a little as she looked at Kelly.  &quot;And I think I am loved, too.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t really care how I look.  As long as I can be with the person I was meant to be with - you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kelly stopped crying, and looked closely at Dana.  Kelly thought Dana was irresistible, and found it a little hard to believe she would want to be with someone like her.  &quot;Really? You think I&#39;m attractive?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dana smiled.  &quot;Oh, yes.  Very sexy.  And for quite some time now. You are  a dream come true to me. &quot;<br />
<br />
Now it was  Kelly&#39;s turn to smile.  It might not be that bad to be stuck as a woman - if she could be with a woman as charming and sexy as Dana.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, I know what will cheer you up. Why don&#39;t we continue our little exercise session back at my apartment? This time,  I think I might be the one to teach you a few new things,  &quot; said Dana, as she took Kelly&#39;s hand in her own and stood up.  Kelly didn&#39;t hesitate for a moment, and quickly jumped up to join her new girlfriend.<br />
<br />
Dana quickly got dressed in the clothes that Kelly had worn to the gym.  They were a little tight on her larger frame, but they would at least last long enough to allow her to make it back to her apartment.  Dana doubted that they would last much longer than that.  Dana could tell by the lustful look on Kelly&#39;s face that she was eager to tear the clothes off of Dana&#39; body as soon as they got home, so Kelly could explore Dana&#39;s enticing body once again.<br />
<br />
As they left the locker room, they tossed the two halves of the broken wand in the trash.   In their minds the broken wand pieces were useless, a reminder of the old lives they had left behind.  They left the locker room hand in hand, staring lovingly in each others eyes.<br />
<br />
They missed the bright flash of light coming from the trash can, as the two halves of the wand reunited and became whole.  The now fully functional wand waited silently in the trash for its next owner.</p>
