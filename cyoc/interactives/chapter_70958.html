<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A Mercedes Benz drove into the mall parking lot. It stopped and a gentleman stepped out. <br />
<br />
He was extremely well dressed - indeed, perfectly dressed - in a hand tailored Saville Row pinstriped business <br />
suit, Armani silk tie, starched white shirt, monogrammed cuff links, silver tiepin, Cartier watch, highly <br />
polished black captoe shoes and black silk socks. He carried a Coach leather briefcases. At the age of 52, he <br />
had a head of thick, silver hair. He was handsome and confident. His name was Timothy Wellington. He had it <br />
all.<br />
<br />
He was tall, distinguished, dignified, dapper and arrogant - and he had good reason to be. He was a wealthy <br />
investment banker and this mall was being renovated thanks to his firm. He walked through the parking lot and <br />
headed for the new luxury food court and atrium. He was scheduled to meet other important men who would help <br />
plan the mall's future. He entered the mall and his $800 shoes clicked along the floor. Shop owners smiled and <br />
greeted him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Mr. Wellington!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you here, sir~&quot;<br />
<br />
He nodded and smiled as he walked.<br />
<br />
Yes, the mall was looking wonderful. He knew every shop. OR - he thought he did....<br />
<br />
When did that barber shop open? The one with the old fashioned barber pole and the dusty, dirty window.<br />
Timothy Wellington stopped and opened the door. <br />
<br />
A very old man in a barber smock looked up and grinned. He looked the banker over from head to foot. <br />
&quot;Nice to see you, SIR&quot; said the barber.<br />
<br />
There was something in his tone. Was it mockery?<br />
<br />
“I am Timothy Wellington – the investment banker who is providing funds for this mall. How long have you been <br />
here?” His tone was authoritative and his manner was smug. <br />
<br />
&quot;A fine pair of shoes you got there!&quot; said the barber. &quot;And a fine head of hair!&quot;<br />
<br />
The banker smelled the thick, heavy odor of oil and cologne. He was about to tell the barber to clean the shop <br />
and scrub the windows when his head felt light.<br />
<br />
“What is that smell?” murmured the banker.<br />
<br />
“Walk into my shop SIR! Just breathe it in! Let it enter your lungs! That’s right! You’ll get a whole new <br />
outlook on your life!” The barber pointed at the banker's gleaming shoes. &quot;Those sure are FANCY shoes you got <br />
on! So shiny I can see myself in them!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I...thank you...&quot; said the banker. His sharp blue eyes were slightly unfocused. The sweet, sickly, <br />
pungent odor filled his nostrils. It was repellent – yet strangely fascinating. “I…I’ll be going now”<br />
He had forgotten why he had entered. As he left the shop as he head the barber say &quot;Thanks for dropping by <br />
sir! Come again boy!&quot;<br />
<br />
The banker looked in again and said &quot;Did you say BOY?&quot;<br />
<br />
The barber just grinned and said &quot;Enjoy your day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Timothy Wellington walked on. The thick air in the barber shop seemed to stay with him and he felt as if <br />
something had entered in to his body and his mind. He then laughed it off. His mind cleared as he reached the <br />
food court and settled into a well-made leather sofa and placed his briefcase on the low table.<br />
Then he looked at his shoes. He noticed that what the barber said was true - they were glistening with polish. <br />
The black leather shone. He felt the usual pride and smug self-assurance about his appearance and his <br />
expensive clothes. <br />
<br />
Then he noticed something else - an old man standing next to him; it was the garbage man, <br />
and he was emptying the trash can.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you wearing those boy?&quot; said the old man, pointing to the shoes.  “You shouldn’t be all dressed up <br />
like that! Well? Why?!”<br />
<br />
The banker’s mouth dropped open. “WHAT?” he snapped. “Do you know who I am? How dare you say that to me! I am <br />
Timothy Wellington – a banker!”<br />
<br />
Then the old man said, again. &quot;Those shoes are so expensive. Too fancy for somebody like you. A man like YOU <br />
has no right to wear those! YOU! You didn’t even graduate from high school!”<br />
<br />
Timothy Wellington was angry. “I’ll have you know that I…..” He was going to say he graduated from one of the <br />
finest universities in the world, but suddenly he realized that his memories of his university days had <br />
vanished from his mind. Instead he saw himself – was it really him at the age of 20? Yes! – scrubbing floors <br />
in an old building.<br />
<br />
Again that feeling of something else inside him troubled his thoughts.  More memories came to him. But they <br />
were completely new to him. His years at prep school disappeared as well. He tried to think of his early days <br />
as a successful young hotshot. That was gone. His ex-wife had disappeared, and his growing up in a wealthy <br />
family. He remembered growing up in a dirty, rundown house with a drunk father. <br />
<br />
IT COULDN’T BE HAPPENING! Where was his life?<br />
<br />
His mind was reeling. His mouth was dry. He stuttered: “Yes….you’re right. I…never graduated from high school. <br />
I have no…no education….”<br />
<br />
WHY DID HE SAY THAT? He struggled desperately to say “I am Timothy Wellington, investment banker!” but his <br />
mouth would not cooperate. “I…I am….nothing, nobody important…just a dumb working man.”<br />
Again he thought: “WHY DID I SAY THAT?”<br />
<br />
“Because it is true” said a voice in his mind. “You never went to college. You never got an MBA. You never <br />
became a banker. You have no assets except the clothes you are wearing. You have nothing”<br />
“NO!” cried Timothy Wellington, out loud.<br />
<br />
The wrinkled old man said reached over and grabbed the long, thin manicured hand of the ‘banker’. <br />
“You ain’t never SEEN a college! You won’t be needing this anymore!” he snapped and laughed. He grabbed the <br />
university ring from his finger and pulled it off. <br />
<br />
“My college ring!” said Timothy Wellington. But the cloud of doubt and fear settled further into his mind. How <br />
could he forget all about his education?<br />
<br />
“What is happening to me?” begged Timothy Wellington.<br />
<br />
The old man grinned. “It’s the essence of CYOC. It transforms whoever it chooses as a victim. YOU are the one <br />
today! It loves to bring down someone who is too uppity. And you were way up there. Not anymore boy!”<br />
<br />
“CYOC?” whispered Timothy Wellington. “So some energy is doing this to me? Destroying my identity?”<br />
<br />
The old man said “Yup! And givin’ you a NEW one! A whole new attitude! New life! New name! New job! And <br />
there’s no goin’ back! We were talking about those shoes you have on, weren’t we?”<br />
<br />
Timothy Wellington struggled and wrestled in his mind. How could this be happening? His life was slipping <br />
away, and this new personality was taking over. And there was nothing he could do to stop it.<br />
<br />
The old man continued, relentless, smirking. “Those nice shoes are so shiny – MUCH too nice for YOU to wear.”<br />
<br />
“You’re nothing. Nobody” said the voice in Timothy Wellington’s terrified mind. “How DARE you wear a banker’s <br />
shoes and socks?”<br />
<br />
Finally he surrendered and whispered. “Yes, they are too upper class for someone like me. I don’t deserve to <br />
wear shoes like this. “ He felt horrified saying it – yet he knew it was true.<br />
<br />
“Fine” the old man said. “You are learning your true place in life. Now apologize for wearing them”<br />
<br />
“But I….” The formerly strong willed, powerful and ambitious banker looked at the old menial worker in front <br />
of him. “Please don’t force me to…”<br />
<br />
“I said apologize!” snapped the old man. “AND TAKE THEM OFF!”<br />
<br />
“Please forgive me for wearing expensive shoes…” and Timothy Wellington’s voice trailed off. He reached down <br />
and untied his $800 Italian shoes. Slowly he slid his feet out of them. He looked at the outline of his long, <br />
thin feet through the thin black dress socks.<br />
<br />
“Now take off your banker socks” demanded the old man.<br />
<br />
Timothy Wellington groaned and reached under his suit cuffs and found the tops of his dress socks. He pulled <br />
down one and then the other – over his calves, heels, soles and toes. <br />
<br />
He was barefoot – in his impeccable pinstriped business suit. <br />
<br />
The old man smiled, and picked up the shoes and socks.“Your transformation is just beginning.  Look at <br />
yourself! You’re two people now – Timothy Wellington, banker, and Timmy Boy - but not for long. Timmy Boy is <br />
taking over”<br />
<br />
Timothy looked in the large wall mirror in the food court. He was dressed to the nines – except for his feet.<br />
The garbage man sneered “Look at that head of hair! You can’t keep that pretty hair in your new life, boy. You <br />
know what to do! And take these shoes and socks. You know who gets them now.”<br />
<br />
Timothy DID know what to do. He seemed to be under someone’s control. He stood up, picked up his leather <br />
briefcase, and walked with glassy eyes into the shopping area, padding on bare feet instead of clicking on the <br />
smart Italian shoes which he carried carefully.<br />
<br />
He found the barber shop. He opened the door. The seductive smell hit him again. The barber looked up. He <br />
smiled.<br />
<br />
“Come on in boy!” said the barber with a smirk. He stared at the former banker’s bare feet and at the shoes in <br />
his hand. “Now look what happened to those beautiful shoes you had on when you were here before. You’re <br />
carrying them – not wearing them!”<br />
<br />
“I…I took them off. I don’t deserve to wear expensive dress shoes. The garbage man told me to give them to <br />
you” said Timmy boy. He obediently handed his own shoes to the barber. “And my socks are there too, sir!”<br />
“Not YOUR SOCKS NOW! And that’s true. You  DON’T deserve to wear the shoes OR socks. Teach you to be so high <br />
and mighty. Now come in and take a seat, my barefoot boy. Time to give you a new hairstyle” The barber <br />
laughed.<br />
<br />
He placed the highly polished Italian shoes on a wooden pedestal on the counter that could be seen all over <br />
the store. “I’m gonna keep these here! You can’t touch them. But you will be sad whenever you see them – <br />
although you won’t really remember why.”<br />
<br />
The barber took the long black dress socks and attached them to the wall with nails.<br />
<br />
He took the former banker’s briefcase, opened it and dumped the business material out. He put it on the <br />
counter and filled it with bottles of shaving cream and brushes.<br />
<br />
Timmy boy sat down in the barber chair. He looked at his dazzlingly handsome face and perfect hair in the <br />
mirror.  His thick silver helmet of hair was immaculately groomed, parted down the side. He looked at his <br />
pinstriped suit and tie and the collar of his white shirt. He looked at his socks hanging from the wall like <br />
black ribbons. Had he been wearing those only a short time before? He looked at the beautiful shoes on the <br />
wooden pedestal and felt the metal under his naked feet.. He sighed. The barber picked up a powerful pair of <br />
clippers. <br />
<br />
“You look much too good for your new life, Timmy boy – too handsome, too classy, too dignified. You don’t need <br />
all this Silver Fox hair and all these fancy, big shot clothes anymore. I’m gonna shave your head bald” <br />
The barber dragged a white barber cape over his business suit and tie and white shirt. It fell to his ankles. <br />
His naked feet rested on the dirty metal pedal of the chair.<br />
<br />
Timmy boy stared  at his reflection. Part of his mind was still holding on to his old life and was horrified <br />
that he would be shaved; he was so proud of his silver fox hair. But a growing part of him knew that he didn’t <br />
deserve to look handsome and well groomed. The barber picked up scissors and sliced off the curtain of silver <br />
hair at the front of his head. <br />
<br />
Then he placed the clippers at his forehead and pushed them through,.<br />
“I don’t deserve to wear shoes or have hair” he whispered, as tears fell down his cheek and his gleaming bald <br />
head emerged as his full head of hair disappeared.<br />
<br />
The silver hair fell in sheets to the ground. The barber buzzed and chopped and mowed down all of it.  Then he <br />
poured wax on what was left and the result was a shining bald dome of flesh.<br />
<br />
“Stand up boy!” snapped the barber.<br />
<br />
Timmy boy stood up. <br />
<br />
“Bald and barefoot – but STILL all dolled up in those clothes! We got do something about that. You’re two <br />
people now. You’re still Timothy Wellington for a little while, and we got something to do before he <br />
disappears completely. Dressed to the nines! ”<br />
<br />
The door of the shop opened. A young man who owned a health food store in the mall came in. He stopped and <br />
stared, stunned at Timmy boy. “Mr. Wellington! Your hair is gone. Good. I envied your hair. Now your comin’ <br />
down to my level. Look at you – Mr Bigshot walking around BAREFOOT! AND THOSE ARE YOUR HIGH AND MIGHTY SHOES <br />
ON DISPLAY!”<br />
<br />
The barber greeted him. “Hey Jimbo – this man is making some changes in his life! You know what to do Timmy <br />
boy”<br />
<br />
Timmy boy said in a shaking voice to Jimbo the health food shop owner: “Please take my Cartier watch, sir. I <br />
am no longer allowed to wear a wristwatch. It cost $4,000” He pulled off his watch and handed it to the young <br />
store owner, who stared and then grinned. <br />
<br />
“I’ll take it!” he snatched the watch. “And I want your car!”<br />
<br />
The former Timothy Wellington suddenly came back. “NO – NO you can’t have my Mercedes!” But the thick, sweet <br />
heavy air of the shop filled his nose and his mind. He crumpled. He hung his head. He pulled out the keys from <br />
his pocket and gave them to the young man, who ran out of the shop.<br />
<br />
The barber smiled. “Timothy Wellington won’t exist soon. The car would disappear when he does if you still <br />
owned it. Now it belongs to him.”<br />
<br />
“EVERYTHING! It’s all being taken! My life! It’s wrong!” cried the former banker, but the new personality of <br />
Timmy boy created by the CYOC energy muffled and crushed his cry of independence, drowning him in his new low <br />
status. “I…I apologize. I know that I am forbidden to drive or own a car. “<br />
<br />
The door opened and Billy, the eccentric pet shop owner from across the mall came in. The banker had <br />
threatened to foreclose on his shop – when he was still a banker. <br />
<br />
“I hear there is free stuff! Too bad I missed your car” he smirked. He looked at the former banker. “Well look <br />
at you! How the mighty have fallen! All your nice hair is gone – how does it feel to have all your hair gone <br />
mister cueball? I asked you a question hotshot”<br />
<br />
“Answer Billy!” the barber demanded.<br />
<br />
Timmy boy hung his head in shame. “I...I had to give up my hair. I looked too good. It is better this way”<br />
“That’s right” sneered Billy the pet shop owner. “And no shoes on your feet. No car. But you still have that <br />
fancy business suit, and I need a suit. Let’s take a look”<br />
<br />
He circled the former banker, like a cat round a mouse.  He grabbed the neatly folded white handkerchief in <br />
the suit pocket. “You used to be a real pretty boy! Started out today in a three piece suit all decked out! <br />
Now how much did that suit cost you boy?”<br />
<br />
The former Timothy Wellington was disgusted and outraged by the question. He tried to say “HOW DARE YOU ASK ME <br />
THAT!” But his new Timmy Boy voice took over:<br />
<br />
“I paid two thousand for it sir”<br />
<br />
Billy smirked: “And you DARE to wear it?! Strip off that suit. I want it. NOW”<br />
<br />
“Of course - I am forbidden to wear business suits. Suits are for men of quality and distinction” Timmy boy <br />
unbuttoned the jacket of the $2,000 three piece pinstriped suit with the satin lining and removed it.  He then <br />
unbuttoned and took off the pinstriped vest.<br />
<br />
“And drop your PANTS!”<br />
<br />
Timothy Wellington suddenly rebelled. “No! I won’t take off my trousers in PUBLIC! This is my SUIT!”<br />
<br />
All three of his tormentors yelled: “TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS!”<br />
<br />
Timmy boy – the former banker – unbuckled the belt and unbuttoned and unzipped his pinstriped suit pants. They <br />
dropped to the floor. He stepped out of them and handed them to Billy.<br />
<br />
Jimbo came back to the shop “Now I own a Mercedes! Looks like the former Mr. Wellington, investment banker, is <br />
getting undressed!”<br />
<br />
The barber pointed at the necktie. “I get your silk necktie”<br />
<br />
Billy, the pet shop owner pointed to the $200 shirt. “Gimme the nice white shirt boy. And the cufflinks”<br />
<br />
Timmy Boy had to move fast to keep up. He unfastened his cufflinks. He untied the beautiful silk tie and <br />
pulled it off. He unbuttoned the white shirt. <br />
<br />
“Well look at the fancy underwear! Looks like silk to me!” said Jimbo. <br />
<br />
Jimbo said “Take off your tee shirt. I want it. I always wanted a former banker’s skivvies”<br />
<br />
The barber smirked. “What are you waiting for boy? Strip off your skivvies!”<br />
<br />
The beaten, broken down former investment banker took off his underwear and stood naked and bald and <br />
humiliated by the terrible force that had transformed him. The barber grabbed his designer shorts and draped <br />
them over the mirror, along with his necktie.  He pulled out a pair of coveralls.<br />
<br />
“Put these on  boy! You got a brand new job!”<br />
<br />
Timmy Boy had almost entirely taken over the identity of Timothy Wellington. And his IQ was dropping. The <br />
brilliant banker found his intelligence and judgment diminishing rapidly. From 135 to 80.<br />
<br />
The barber grinned as he watched the struggle and fear. “You won’t be needing all that intelligence and <br />
ambition now. Remember – your education doesn’t exist anymore. You are just a big dumb man who works as a <br />
handyman in my shop. You will be shining shoes for other men and sweeping floors – but you are gonna stay <br />
barefoot every day as punishment for your arrogance for wearing expensive shoes over the years.  Your hair <br />
will never grow back. Your gonna sleep in the back of the shop. Put these coveralls on!”<br />
<br />
The barber went on: &quot;You are STILL too pretty for your new life. The CYOC won't let you stay so handsome&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the former banker's aristocratically handsome face was changing too – his nose cracked and broke and <br />
widened. His lips grew thicker. His sharp blue eyes turned a cloudy grey. His cheekbones cracked and widened. <br />
His cleft chin receded.<br />
<br />
His long thin hands grew stubby and dirty. His long thin feet followed. he shrank - losing a foot in height, <br />
from 6' 2'' to 5 feet.<br />
<br />
the barber smiled - &quot;Now that's better!&quot;<br />
<br />
Timmy Boy stepped into the dirty coveralls. His new life had begun.</p>
