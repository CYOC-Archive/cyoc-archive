<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;It was a night just like this...&quot; Sonia said gesturing at the ceiling. Outside the rain poured and thunder rumbled with perfect timing. You grin knowing she was probably doing that on purpose but still it was perfectly spooky for her story. She smiles back and clears her throat theatrically then continues the tale.<br />
Six young men all around 25 to 30 are walking home from the gym. They&#39;d just done a group class, and were now hunting for a place to fill their bellies with protein and carbs, talking loudly about their food choices. Two of them were not even watching the sidewalk, noses firmly in their phones announcing food options to the rest who groaned and shot down the ideas with protests of &quot;too spendy&quot; or &quot;that sounds nasty&quot;. They utterly failed to notice that the sky was darkening too fast this evening, or that the air was beginning to feel heavy with rain.<br />
<br />
Of course our heroine of this story was already aware of them outside of her daycare, and being a loving and perfect care giver she wanted to keep these young men safe, so she allowed them to see her doorway. Usually people just walked right past it. Sometimes people could find it on their own, if the circumstances were right. These six would have strolled right past but Sonia knew the storm was about to unleash hell on these young men.<br />
<br />
Unleash it did. A few drops and an increase in cold wind was the beginning, and one of the guys looked up from his phone wiping away drops of water before he glanced around. &quot;Oh shit, it&#39;s raining. Look up the street. Fuck we better get inside or something.&quot; he exclaimed, the others nodded of course and there it was. A doorway to the daycare, a refuge from the weather and... it was open! One tugged the door relived to find it swung easily toward him, and the other 5 piled in just as the rain picked up and thunder let out a boom. The door slammed behind him as they entered and looked around.<br />
<br />
A plain foyer with a desk and some sofas, with a doorway to either side leading down a hall, and more doors to the left. To the right some kind of great room with shelves and toys scattered around. It was dark inside, but the desk lamp was on as were a few emergency lights giving the place a creepy gloom. Even for a daycare the cheery decor looked somewhat sinister in bad light like this.<br />
<br />
Sonia watched the boys as she always did, of course, and kept herself out of sight for now. These young men only needed a place to shelter, and she had provided. What they got up to after that was their choice entirely and she would wait to see before making and judgements. All kids deserved a chance after all, some just needed some encouragement and others were just bad seeds from the start. She had seen a lot of kids here in her time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello!&quot; one of the guys yelled, startling every body else. One laughed and hit him playfully. The rest teased about being jumpy, and made nervous comments. &quot;Kevin go check it out. This place looks empty. The lights are all off. Maybe they forgot to lock the door.&quot; says one of them.<br />
<br />
Kevin looks up from his phone. &quot;Oh. Yeah man. I&#39;ll check it out and let you know what I find. If get axe murdered you&#39;ll have to save me though Brent.&quot; Brent looks at back at him and laughs &quot;No way. I just destroyed my arms at the gym, I&#39;m too pretty to die saving you while I&#39;m weak as a kitten.&quot; They laugh again and collapse on to the sofas, some pull out their phones but Brent watches the one named Kevin walk bravely in to the dark hallway lined with doors. He gives another half hearted &quot;Hello? Anybody here? I&#39;m comin down the hall don&#39;t be startled k?&quot; as he ventures in to the dark.<br />
<br />
He gets about halfway before he starts trying the doors. Each one locked, peering in the windows he seems classrooms, a room full of beds and blankets, more toys... and finally there it is, a handle that turns. He opens the door in to a break room. The green EXIT sign over the door provides light, and the switch on the wall is easy to locate. He flips it and the flourescent bulbs flicker to life. There is a mini kitchen in here, counter tops around the walls with a sink and cabinets above and below painted a plain white. In the corner stands a large fridge, and a large freezer. Two microwaves and a mini cooktop with oven in the corner look perfect to make himself a snack. He strides to the fridge and opens it. Within are brown paper bags, all with names written on them. That&#39;s odd, he thinks, and reaches to grab one labeled Cindy. Pulling it out of the fridge he opens it peering in to see it has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a green apple, a cookie, and a bag of chips.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god its kids lunches.&quot; He says to himself, and dumps it out on the breakroom table. His stomach growls looking at it. Would they even notice if it was gone? Would anybody care if some little kid didn&#39;t get her cookie? He reaches out and eats the cookie quickly, greedily, his tired body savoring every rushed bite of baked sugary goodness. &quot;Oh man, that was awesome.&quot; he says again to nobody in the room, and begins to unwrap the sandwich from it&#39;s plastic wrap. It smells immediately of peanuts, his mouth waters anew and he hungrily takes a bit chewing and swallowing. He thinks about getting a couple of these for the guys in the lobby but then decide best not to steal too much, somebody might notice.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know-&quot; is all Sonia gets out before the boy yelps in horror and spins around at the sound of her voice. Sonia sighs and starts again &quot;You know stealing is wrong, and if we do bad things we have consequences. Don&#39;t we?&quot; She says, using her best &quot;teaching moment&quot; voice with this young man. He is blonde, she knows his name is Kevin because the others said it, and he does appear to take his health and appearance very seriously, though his sleeveless tank top and tight gym shorts are a little more revealing than she would normally allow in her Daycare.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; is all Kevin says, staring at the semi transparent apparition before him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Language, young man.&quot; she says staring at him. For a moment he looks in to her eyes and something passes between them, a force, a wish from her to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. uh... uhhhgh...&quot; He begins to say something but stops, placing a hand to his chest feeling a strange sensation. A tightness begins to grip his chest and back, his skin feeling like it is being stretched over him. Is he swelling? He feels slightly dizzy. Kevin steps back from the ghost and bumps in to the breakroom table with a thump, turning to it he places his hands down to steady himself. That&#39;s when he sees his hands.<br />
<br />
The skin is pale, and smooth, even as he watches it looks like it&#39;s getting lighter, whiter. &quot;What the fuck is happening...&quot; he trails off and steadies himself, lifting his hands to his face. The change is spreading down his arms, his skin feels tight and tingles growing whiter and in the breakroom lights he can see it growing shiny and smooth. As it spreads up past his shoulders it makes sense why his chest felt tight, he places a hand on his chest and rubs his pecs through his shirt, the cotton tank sliding easily over his smooth white skin. He grunt a little, lifting his shirt and pulling off in one smooth motion. Then makes a little gasp of horror at what he sees.<br />
<br />
His whole body is white, the skin shiny and soft, more than just smooth he is totally hairless. No wait, no nipples. No belly button. He is totally smooth. &quot;Fu-&quot; it gets cut off in his mouth as he realizes he is being smoothed out all over. The tingle in his crotch, the tightness spreading down his thighs. He pulls his shorts down just enough, to his his knees, to see the whiteness has consumed even his crotch. Just a smooth bulge there between his legs is all he sees. &quot;N-No...&quot; he stammers, quickly placing his hands over the plain space his genitals had been, the skin is tight and soft, crackling gently like plastic as he massages it. He feels nothing but his own touch, he has been reshaped somehow, transformed in to ... something. Massaging his bulge he feels his fingers tingle and stiffen, the same tightness creeping up his neck and over his face, now reaching his toes he gasps holding up his hands.<br />
<br />
No more fingers, just blunt arms with each digit melted in to the other he moves his hands like flippers, his plastic skin crinkling. He feels the tightness in his face now, the sensation of this change deep in his skull throbbing inside him. &quot;Please.... I don&#39;t mmmhm. Mmm-&quot; is all he can mumble before his mouth presses shut. The plastic of his lips seals together. He presses on it with his deformed hands and feels the smoothness of his own face, running a hand over his head where his hair used to be but now just plastic. He is crackling more as he moves, the tight white plastic covering him completely, his skin transformed in to this. What is happening to me? He thinks, struggling to walk to the door, to get away, but his legs are growing together. The white plastic is stretching between them, the muscular legs of a gym rat now becoming a long white plastic tube, he falls to his knees making a soft thud as he struggles but no longer able to walk.<br />
<br />
He can&#39;t scream, he can&#39;t call for help. He can only grab for the door and try to pull himself, but even that doesn&#39;t last. Plastic is stretching between his torso and his arms, growing form his armpit it spreads down like wings, then pulls his arms to his sides. They melt in to him, joining his plastic mass, and all Kevin can do is shake his shoulders and struggle, shaking his head &quot;no&quot; as he deforms. He bends at the waist, backward, the plastic on his backside splitting open to release soft synthetic cotton. He shrinks, his head pulling to his mass and his legs folding up. <br />
<br />
He folds neatly, in half. He can feel where his arms once were, flat now and sticky. Elastic growing from his plastic and stuffing body. He knows what he is now too, he guessed it when he had fallen, white crinkling plastic and soft fluff: a diaper. He had become a folded clean white diaper. His struggling ceased as he shrank, the last of his humanity vanishing. He was trapped, aware, totally alive and senses functional but unable to move or speak. He had been a handsome 25 year old with friends and a job only 2 minutes ago, and now he was a diaper.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we go. I hope you learned something about taking what isn&#39;t yours and how far a potty mouth with get you.&quot; Sonia leans down and picks him up. For a ghost, she seems quite solid to him. &quot;Now we need to handle your friends. I really wanted to just let you hide out here till this storm passes but if you&#39;re going to be like this then I think my mind is made up.&quot; She sets him on the table and floats through the door, leaving the diaper alone in the break room, for now.<br />
<br />
Out in the lobby the five remaining young men hear a small yelp from the breakroom, but Kevin hasn&#39;t come back yet. Brent and another boy stand up and are already halfway to the breakroom when Sonia emerges through the door directly in front of them.</p>
