<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex walks up stairs and hears a faint creeping coming from Joseph’s room. He decides to ignore it, remembering when he was Joseph’s age and all the things he did in his bed. <br />
He walks into the bathroom and shuts the door, pulling his pants down. He looks at his sick with mild disappointment. He knows Dawn says she liked it, but he always got the feeling she was a bit of a size queen. <br />
Eh, whatever. He squirts a dab of ointment onto his hand and rubs it on his dick. Actually, this does feel soothing. He applies a little more, feeling very cooled and moisturized. He then goes all in and empties the entire bottle onto his penis, throughly massaging it into his shaft and balls. He got ready to wash the rest off, but it seemed to have smoothed out from his rubbing, there was no cluster of excess ointment anywhere. He then used the toilet, washed his hands, and went back downstairs. <br />
Dawn was sitting on the couch with a cooked pizza on the coffee table next to a pair of clothes. <br />
“What’s that?” Alex asked. <br />
“Oh, that,” Dawn replied “I guess my dad left some of his laundry out when he folded it.” <br />
Alex had no idea that Dawn had actually snuck past the bathroom and stole her dads clothes from his closet. <br />
They both cuddled on the couch and started the movie, a cheesy rom com they both liked. They only made it to the end of the title screen before Alex started feeling weird. Alex didn’t think anything of that but noticed that Dawn was a lot closer into his chest than usual. <br />
Alex started to get that strange feeling again, like a warmth spread throughout his entire body. Then he felt almost, tight? In his pants? Maybe he was getting a little too turned on, I mean Dawn was practically leaning into his entire body. Now he felt tighter, but everywhere.<br />
“Uh babe,” Alex said “I feel a little funny.”<br />
And suddenly the sound of tearing fabric erupted from the two. Dawn practically jumped off of Alex in surprise. They both noticed that there was some thing different. Alex’s clothes weren’t tight earlier today, but they weren’t loose either. Now his clothes strained against his form, like his clothes were two sizes too small, especially his pants. <br />
“What the hell?” Alex yelled. <br />
His crotch was giant compared to a few minutes ago. It looked like he was trying to smuggle a plum eggplant in his pants with a pair of tennis balls as well. His zipper exploded outward and his underwear tore completely open. His cock was currently down his leg so it was not yet visible, but boy the outline was nothing to giggle at. <br />
As he raised his arms I surprise, his sleeves tore down the middle, exposing a pair of massive biceps the size of a small football. The back of his shirt tore open from his expanding lats. The front, right over his chest where Dawn laid only a minute prior, split all the way down to his pants. His chest ballooned out and his abs hardened into 6 steel hard blocks. No wait, two more rounded out as the two watched, making an even 8. His calves shredded through his pant legs, finally freeing the anaconda underneath. His cock hung down to his knees, as his inflating balls slowly spread his legs further. His pants waist finally exploded outward, showing off a perfect V and the beginnings of a complete 10 pack of impenetrable abs. <br />
Alex looked mildly frightened, but Dawn looked…hungry? <br />
He flexed his arm, watching as his bicep popped higher, he practically stole these arms from the Rock himself. After a few minutes of steadily increasing size, Alex began to slow down. His final tally put him at roughly 22 inches in his arms, 35 inches in his waist, and at least 65 inches in his chest. He also grew in height, putting him at about 6’11”. His cock, as we can’t forget that, reached a total of 1”2’ hard. His balls were at least 5” around. <br />
Dawn was hot with lust. She stared at Alex with a hunger that would not easily be satisfied. And Alex, our Adonis of a hulking figure, looked at her the same.</p>
