<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One moment she was getting stuffed into a sack, the next she was poured out into a fancy room with marble pillars and big purple pillows scattered everywhere, landing right on her feet, of course. The pair who&#39;d dropped her off were quickly shooed away, and a flock of girls with fancy silk sheets and powder puffs gave her an instantaneous makeover, putting her in a puffy pair of pants and a skimpy little top that were both so transparent you could see absolutely every inch of her body the animators were allowed to draw. Then someone just told her &quot;welcome to the harem, make yourself at home!&quot; and waved her off towards a big pile of pillows and a bowl of grapes. So naturally she splayed herself out and dangled a bunch into her mouth to nibble on seductively.<br />
<br />
Normally when she did that, she immediately caught the eye of a hunk or two, and they&#39;d wisk her off for some passionate lovemaking, or at least start fighting each other for her affections. Looking around though, she realized it was nothing but girls in the whole place... and none of them had a boyfriend along she could seduce away from them!<br />
<br />
This gave her a bit of time to herself to think, something she really wasn&#39;t ever in the habit of doing. She wasn&#39;t much of a fan either. But at the moment she didn&#39;t really have anything else to do. Or any-ONE else to do. So, where was she? A harem they&#39;d said. That was one of those places where some sheik or sultan or maybe a prince kept all the gorgeous women they wanted to have their way with right? Maybe one with a big manly just and a curly beard she could twirl up while they made out. She was looking forward to that part at least.<br />
<br />
Of course, she realized, there were all these other girls waiting for the same thing... surely though she&#39;d skip to the head of the line. She was Red Hott after all! The sexiest toon ever drawn! They were all just here to get jealous... once he finally showed up to drag her off to the royal bedchamber anyway.<br />
<br />
Damn, she&#39;d been thinking for five whole seconds and there still wasn&#39;t anyone trying to get into her pants yet! More thinking then. How did she end up here? Well, someone tossed her into the sack, and not the fun way, and brought her here. And before that someone had handed her a little pocket rocket... that was almost as good as having a man going at her... were there any more of those around? Didn&#39;t look like it. And before that, ooh, there&#39;d been that little piggy with the great big hog, and before that...<br />
<br />
Red&#39;s train of thought pulled into a station full of all the men she&#39;d had her way with and she just ended up making herself so horny her eyes turned into hearts and her bangs twisted up into little horns... but then she finally spotted a man. Two, even! There was a big gruff guard who&#39;d totally be her type if he was shoving around someone too shy to talk to her, and then this nervous little duck whose sword kept slipping out of his belt as he listened to his big strong supervisor. Ooh, the trembling, the sweating, the pure look of fear! That REALLY got her motor running!<br />
<br />
&quot;... and the most important think to remember,&quot; the large man said, &quot;is you must absolutely NEVER touch a single hair on the head of any of the master&#39;s concubines.&quot; He drew his sword for emphasis and leaned down close. &quot;Or else!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or else?&quot; croaked the duck, dragging his thumb across his neck, leaving a dotted line in the air.<br />
<br />
The big guy shook his head. &quot;Or ELSE.&quot; He dragged his thumb downward, leaving a dotted line passing right between the duck&#39;s legs. He gulped down a sudden lump in his throught the size of his fist and started sweating and trembling even more. Oh yeah, that really did it for red. She was falling for this guy as hard as every other guy always fell for her. That comical fear was the ultimate turn-on. She absolutely HAD to have him, right here, right now, right on these pillows. And then on those pillows. And those. Up against that pillar too. Maybe right out in the middle of the floor. Then maybe they&#39;d get married and have half a dozen babies and-<br />
<br />
Her eyes and tongue had already respectively bulged and rolled out across the room by this point, and the rest of her finally snapped over. She wrapped her arms around him, batted her heavily shadowed eyes, and went to move her veil aside to give him a proper kiss, and just ended up with arms full of smoke as he shot straight up in the air leaving his sword belt to clatter to the floor.<br />
<br />
Completely obsessed, she spent the next good ten minutes or so pursuing him, sneaking up on him, suddenly appearing next to him in a storage room after he slammed the door to get away from him. Eventually she managed to eat a banana (all in one long seductive bite of course) and throw the peel in his path causing him to tumble through the air and land face first in her cleavage as she moaned seductively.<br />
<br />
Of course then, naturally, the other guard showed up to catch him apparently in the act, he chased him away swinging his sword and nearly taking his head off and running him through save for some rubbery dodges, until eventually he ran straight out of the palace and out over the dunes, while a still hopelessly lovesick Red could only wave a silk handkerchief and sigh over losing the perfect man.</p>
