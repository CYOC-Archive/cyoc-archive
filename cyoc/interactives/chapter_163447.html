<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Gone shopping, we can talk about it all tonight after supper, be home by 5:30, see you then, Mom.”<br />
<br />
It happened that it was a Saturday and Ken had no job to go to, or school was not a problem; so it seemed possible he might give the game a six hour run for the money. Ken woke about 10:00 am and did his usual, taking a hot shower and getting dressed for a new day.<br />
<br />
Ken felt such a thrill, he did not wait to experiment but forgot to eat any breakfast, he booted up his computer and thought to begin for him a game. He began the game and did a search through images as what form he thought would for him be as wonderful.<br />
<br />
That new day held for Ken a delightful possibility as he booted up the computer to seeing of a new icon having joined the desktop icons. Play-to-Create had changed, as the new name read as Play-the-Maker.  This was odd or so thought Ken as he moved the cursor to giving the yellow yield sign icon a left click choosing inside the triangle.<br />
<br />
The screen flashed and as below the large triangle, a note at the bottom of the screen told him to place a hand onto the screen for a scan of the operator&#39;s D.N.A. registry. Ken knew about this and did as instructed, seeing how where he placed his hand on the computer monitor, it traced the pattern of his hand and made the hand feel a strange electric tingling.<br />
<br />
The screen faded into a light yellow background and dark blue letters told of what next to expect.<br />
<br />
First: Select any picture of the highest desired form to which you, or a specified other would enjoy becoming if made as possible.<br />
<br />
Second: Bring attachments to get as saved, any picture of special enhancements to this form which you want to see or enjoy.<br />
<br />
Third: Fill in the time duration in minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, or if left blank the game shall consider the choice to being as a permanent designation.<br />
<br />
Fourth: As payment for the game, please refer the name of a friend a copy of Play-the Maker for their receiving a copy of the game. Provide the E-mail address here_________________________________.<br />
<br />
Fifth: And most important remove all jewelry, clothing, glasses, braces, or anything that could cause injury during your chosen time of enjoyment. As this is completed you need to click the mouse on the peak of the yellow triangle icon and watch the miracle of science and computer graphics.<br />
<br />
Ken sat thinking of what he should do next. Ken sat back in his chair knowing he should not be playing this game, he just could not decide of what to request, or ask to become as a fun distraction. Relaxing and the closing of his eyes, and Ken recalled of a desired form what until then were never as possible. <br />
He thought back to when a child of five years as his age, and of Gwen, a girl he loved deeply. Even as a child the feelings of love for another ran deep, and Ken still loved to recall of his time with her at play.<br />
<br />
He was reminded of that terrible day when his father announced about the family was moving to a new house, and Ken would lose his friends and girlfriend. They met, as sat in an apple tree while Ken told her of his father&#39;s plans. They cried together and wished that they could stay together. Ken asked her if she was of different forms, and from then if to stay together in this cold world, just what would she wish of them to become to continue their friendship.<br />
<br />
Looking about from their tree house built in an old apple tree; Gwen smiled and pointed to Mister Black&#39;s nearby small zoo he kept as a hobby. The zoo was a group of pens built next to a small barn Mr. Black kept his bigger pets housed in and there close to his heart. Ken recalled a flock of wild game birds, a Peacock, two goats, three dogs, and a very lonely, gelded pony. She pointed to the pony and suggested she would prefer to be a soft fuzzy pony, if it were possible.<br />
<br />
All this happened over many years ago but Ken remember it and carried the loss of her friendship in his heart. &quot;If I were to choose another form would I prefer that black pony that stood so often masturbating in his small pen?&quot; Ken said aloud, and he looking around he set his eyes and imagination to looking at ward the large bookcase behind his desk.<br />
<br />
Books and more books and most about transportation, some on travel while only one held of anything to do with the animal world. &quot;A Glossary on the World of Horses&quot; was the only choice available. Picking up the book he&#39;d not looked at in a dozen years, as Ken began to browse the pages of color photos.<br />
<br />
A book of beautiful photography held photos dealing with draft horses, as Ken studied their great muscles as bulging. Then too, he eyed pictures to equestrian horses, tall beasts 16 hands high with long flowing tails. Riding and pleasure horses he eyed, many variations of colors, some tall, some stout. A section on Ponies caught Ken&#39;s eye as he paged through it, looking at one breed after another, checking to find one that might represent that black gelding he so remembered.<br />
<br />
Ah but nothing in the pony section really reminded him of that pony. The back section had a short grouping of wild horses and their relative cousins. He came to a section of the book dealing with equine management, the health, and lastly riding tack.<br />
<br />
Sitting back in his reclining desk chair, Ken closed his eyes as he closed the big book. &quot;Heck, I found nothing to make me reach out to my fond memory of that moment and her!&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
Ken got up and walked to the kitchen for a cold glass of water. His work of aggravation and having walked along memory lane, Ken gained little as anything of satisfaction. Standing alone, pacing he looked at the clock and thought his dear mother would not be home from shopping for six more hours.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do I have to lose, if just to play the game for five of the six hours until his mom returned home, and he could play about being as some horse?<br />
<br />
Hey wait it was Saturday and if mom returned at 5:30, he was alone in the house to play with the game!&quot; Ken thought to himself. As seated there by his bedroom desk he had the big book laid closed in front of him. Ken didn&#39;t know what to chose, but what did it matter this was only a game. <br />
<br />
Thinking to choose a wholly random choice as a test, Ken picked with his finger nail between the closed pages, Ken flipped it open and without looking at the page, he dropped the book sight unseen to the his HP printer/scanner.<br />
<br />
Pressing the start key the scanner did its work, causing the computer to begin as sputter. The second question required to answer related to any betterments, for which Ken picked up the book, closing it and reopening in the “Management” section was as he would later realize, the photo of a stud doing his enjoyed employment; it showing a big cock in the air and about to plunge into the hobbled mare, was the next item as scanned. <br />
<br />
Next was the question dealing with duration of the game!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm how long do I wish to tie up the computer?&quot; Ken pondered as he set ready to leaving this to chance; he was reminded of a cat having forced a new perspective upon Jeff and his term of enjoyment.<br />
<br />
Ken believed in luck as a factor in life, and he laid this test of the Game to chance. &quot;I was five when we moved so I&#39;ll type in 5,&quot; and he did! <br />
<br />
Then closing his eyes he took the mouse and sliding it back and forth he clicked it onto whatever time allotment that might be of his luck. This caused the computer to blink its sensor light, making a queer sound as it began some computations. The fourth question Ken ignored and did not feel ready to give this program to some other foolish person. The final notice was to strip off all clothing until being as naked to the world, as Ken thought he too was being foolish.<br />
<br />
Ken did as the game said but felt both cold and foolish as he sat in the big leather chair. Reaching his hand to the mouse, he then clicked the yellow triangle and thought to watch the show on his screen. As did the computer screen flashed, and the world for Ken went black. He felt as drifting along the endless corridor of time and space. It was like a strange dream him as he thought to be lying naked, sunken down into his big chair. He knew he was naked to the world but that seemed the least of his worries. An electric-static feeling as of rays beaming from the computer screen ran up, over, and around him as he lay.<br />
<br />
The first light came and as Ken felt scared by the sight, the blackness returned to cover him and he felt as if asleep.<br />
<br />
Ken raised his head to see again brightness; and wondered of what it would show. He saw a dark form on a white background as it reminded him of his youthful dream somehow. Minutes passed as he was assaulted by shock, after more static shocks until he felt numb.<br />
<br />
A bright as warming flash brought on him a feeling of renewed strength being pumped back into his being. Slowly Ken tried to push himself up and stand upright again. He noted of how completely off balance he felt, and with his fists he pressed into the seat of the big chair. Ken felt the need to try stretching his legs out long, if only to smooth the kinky feelings from the bones and oddly tight-taunt muscles of sore legs.<br />
<br />
Stretching his neck and craning his face to looking toward the brightness glaring at him, the view began to clear. Standing in the glory of a weird moment, Ken shook his head to clear his head,. The shiver rattled along his neck to his spine, his torso, and became a wiggle to his pelvis.<br />
<br />
His portion of the world felt then as more than alive, he felt joyous. A casual turning of his head to face toward the full length mirror attached to his bedroom closet door, as proved in an instant that the Game really did work wonders. What Ken saw was a mature pony stallion, he being a Dun golden tan color with a black mane and tail.<br />
<br />
Ken thought for a long minute before looking at the large book of horses and saw the caption title as of “Ponies,” and he being as a Highland breed. His black and thick mane hung long as it stretched over a strong neck. He shook his head to adjust the mane and allow him a better view of his tall, pointed ears. <br />
As were his ears almost buried by the thick fall of mane above the eyes, it hung down to partially cover his face. As he gave a slight wiggle to his black muzzle, seemed to quell the sense of fear from what had happened to him.<br />
<br />
The strong rump muscles of a round and low set tail hind quarters aided his hind flanks to allow his sheath to protrude better into the daylight. Black haired legs with chestnuts on each main joint ran down to join his black sharp hoofs. A black feathering from the fetlocks gave a bold flare to the small pony feet. Solid was the muscle and form of his new self and it pleased him greatly. <br />
<br />
“What an interesting choice of luck,” Ken thought as suddenly he felt a strange feeling touch his naked butt. A casual look over one shoulder brought the sight of his low set tail swishing, stroking at his rounded pony buttocks.<br />
<br />
A shrill whinny from his throat and mouth, and Ken looked down, as then over his withers to seeing of that pony he was then. A Looking down and Ken found his fore-hoofs planted deep into the seat of his expensive chair. A gaze to the rear saw an unsettled tail flicking the thick course hairs over his hairy rump, but he liked the sensation.<br />
<br />
Snorting to clear his nostrils, he shook of the head, neck and body worked the shiver and sudden chill of fear out of his flesh. A peering look back at the computer screen, and there blinking were the time duration he randomly choose as shown in large numbers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time___now___Minutes_5, Hours_5, Days_5, Months_0_ Years_0_.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ken stared at the time duration with amazement, and wonder. &quot;This is me for the next five days?” He knew he had to leave home, and be away for five days, five hours, and five minutes, but luckily not in months or years was his humiliating situation, he felt doomed!<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a game!&quot; Ken thought. &quot;No it was real, and could change reality. He knew his whole body had changed, he was a Highland pony, no doubt in his mind that he stood in the form of such an animal.&quot; Ken stood silent for several minutes as his body became to feeling as more his own. Like a flow of strength passing down the length of his new form it made him feel so very good. He was all equine, even to the ability to wiggle patches of skin that would rid away insects being a bother. As both mane and tail hair felt coarse, when he flicked his tail in felt abrasive when caressing his puckered anus.<br />
<br />
A small step backwards stretched his frame and made legs, feet, and groin draw tight. A deep breath inhaled and he holding both the breath and the thought of being a true animal was the thrill. The new desire to try as walk on all fours brought an added desire which to a stallion shows only one way. The prickly feeling of his new as dry leathery skin rolling bulged out of his sheath brought a grand realism to Ken&#39;s life.<br />
<br />
At first the member hung limp over the edge of the sheath. Slowly the organ filled with blood. The sensation was of how it bloomed being stout, growing and lengthening as it made Ken shiver with delight. Out it pressed, stiffer and more erect until it strained to a state of full readiness. The male organ waved about as from any minor movements from Ken. He bent his head down and could draw in the musky scent from his own big pony cock.<br />
<br />
A look to the left and Ken saw his total form standing stretched as handsome and rather erotic, all there in the full length mirror. He admired his body, the solid conformation of a purebred Highland pony stallion self. Every muscle was firm looking and the thick mane and tail made him look even more as a bold brute.<br />
<br />
The delight he had at ogling his sexy body and the massive, by human standards stallion cock which stretched out rigid and had him feeling quite willing. Willing, yes right then Ken was very willing if a mare could find?<br />
<br />
Oh, any mare he would not be so choosy, just a mare and her vulva that&#39;s what he wanted!<br />
<br />
The stance he took made his reflection look to him as wild and sexual. He loved his look of the hardy, strong, and male animal the Game created from him. Words were wanting as he finally stepped down to all fours. The still erect cock flung in several directions, wagging until it calmed to being just plain stiff.<br />
<br />
A step and then two more and Ken began to learn the pattern of walking as a pony. The present nodding of his head as he worked his forelegs walked the hind legs to jostling his round rump. As he would walk his tail rose and it held high up off his round rump. As Ken walked the bold action in his walk and the proud way he carried himself increased a growing delight for him being as a pony.<br />
<br />
Everything about his new pony self felt all very fine, but he had to leave home, as well find a pasture full of mares. The thought of seeing but then ignoring of the basketball donkey stud farm south of town suggested to him of possible horny jennet donkeys, and their vulvas were just the right size.<br />
<br />
Ken marched his way toward the kitchen and its service door leading to the outside world. He had to bite down hard to make the doorknob turn. His big white teeth crunched down hard and did quite some damage to the doorknob, but it worked to get him outside of the house and free. Out of the house Ken did with a bound to the backyard. He being more a pony animal with every passing minute, had him looking about at the green grass lawn, it as well kept by the lawn maintenance company, as it appealed to his equine needs.<br />
<br />
Grazing was the new way of consuming food. A nibble of thick muscled lips groped to gather blades of grass. The big bold white incisor teeth nipped the blades free of the ground. A large tongue moved the sweet blades of grass to back molders, as he chewed, and ground the food until he swallowed. Nibble after nibble became almost intoxicating as the action helped him get the food, and learn how to graze.<br />
<br />
The morning dew had settled over the lawn to add needed moisture to aid with grazing and the swallowing. He had a thought, and looking past his broad pony back, Ken stopped to look up. Time had passed and with it the backyard had patches of grazed areas, and what almost made him to smile, he saw small piles on pony manure lying about.<br />
<br />
Seemly proud of his new grazed pasture, Ken took to walking out the rear of his home property and off on an adventure to find love.</p>
