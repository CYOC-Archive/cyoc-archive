<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A rare day off found Tom and Alexa enjoying each other&#39;s company. Realizing they needed to unwind, the couple went about an active, fun day.<br />
<br />
A movie, some shopping, a stroll through the woods, the couple decided to end their day by ordering some Chinese food before settling in for a night of streaming programs. Tom and Alexa now settled on his sectional couch, the wizard giving his girlfriend a foot massage. Tom couldn&#39;t help but smirk as he glanced at Alexa.<br />
<br />
Tom always found it amusing when Alexa was content. A soft purr would begin to emanate from the Nekomata, her body relaxing. Tom found that if he was massaging Alexa&#39;s feet or shoulders, that her feline characteristics would rise to the surface. Tom would see fur begin to sprout on Alexa&#39;s shoulders and back or her feet would begin to change, the soles taking on paw pads as they became more feline.<br />
<br />
The later is what Tom began to notice now as Alexa&#39;s feet began to change. The woman&#39;s soles began to thicken, her toes lengthening; becoming cat like with accompanying claws. Tom chuckled as paw pads began to form along her toes and sole as soft brown fur sprouted from her skin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Somebody&#39;s comfortable,&quot; he grinned.<br />
<br />
Alexa opened one eye, revealing a blue cat eye that gazed at Tom intently.<br />
<br />
&quot;That obvious?&quot; she smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a bit,&quot; Tom grinned. &quot;Sounds like a motorcycle is idling on my couch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa laughed, playfully pushing at Tom with her foot as she settled deeper into the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider it a compliment,&quot; she sighed happily. &quot;I have to be really relaxed for any of my Nekomata traits to rise to the surface.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I noticed,&quot; Tom said, before a mischievous smirk crossed his face. &quot;Maybe I should stop?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t you freaking dare,&quot; Alexa said quickly. &quot;A happy cat is way better than an angry one. You stop and I&#39;m going to use your couch as a scratching post.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom laughed, continuing with his massage. Alexa&#39;s threats were empty but the pair shared these cultural jokes at the other&#39;s expense. Neither one leaned into their identities, but would poke fun at the nature of one another. For Tom, he would make cat jokes. Alexa though would joke about his magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just wave your hands and say abracadabra,&quot; she would joke when Tom was struggling with cooking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go grab your magic wand there Potter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You couldn&#39;t just enchant a broom to cleanup before inviting me over?&quot;<br />
<br />
It was the small jabs couples took when they reached a level of comfort with one another. For the past six months, Tom and Alexa spent nearly every waking hour with one another. They quickly struck up a friendship. That friendship growing into a relationship far quicker than either expected. The couple felt whole with one another. They strengthened each other&#39;s weaknesses while complimenting each other&#39;s strengths. Already the young agents were considered one of the best duos within S.P.E.A.R.<br />
<br />
Tom gulped as he gazed at Alexa. He had never expected to fall for the 25 year old woman this fast or this hard. Alexa was a perfect compliment to him. Intelligent, steady, calm, a joyous personality that was grounded and uninterested in drama. It was a stark departure from what Tom was used. For him, Alexa was perfect.<br />
<br />
This was why he now worried, as he attempted to force the words out if his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa,&quot; he gulped. &quot;I....I wanted to ask you something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Houdini what&#39;s on your mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m serious,&quot; Tom stated. &quot;This is important.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa opened her eyes, sensing immediately that Tom wasn&#39;t joking anymore. Realizing this, the woman opened both her eyes, focusing on the wizard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Tom, what&#39;s on your mind?&quot; she said softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;ve been thinking about this over the last month,&quot; Tom stammered. &quot;I mean I love being with you. We&#39;re great together! Working with you, well the job doesn&#39;t seem like a job. I...I feel like I&#39;m working with my best friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel the same way,&quot; Alexa said softly, a small smile forming on her face. &quot;Tom, I&#39;ve loved our time together. This has been the best six months of my life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; Tom smiled. &quot;And.....and that&#39;s why I have an important question to ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa raised an eyebrow, her pulse quickening as Tom reached into his pocket. The gasp that escaped the woman&#39;s mouth pierced the silence, the Nekomata shifting into human form completely as her wide eyes gazed at a small box.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom,&quot; Alexa stammered. &quot;I...I don&#39;t know what to say! Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too soon? You haven&#39;t even had a chance to meet my parents yet! I can&#39;t see them approving of you asking me to marry you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marriage?!&quot; Tom exclaimed in alarm. &quot;What?! No, Alexa I was going to ask you to move in with me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; Alexa asked in confusion. Curiously the Nekomata woman watched as Tom now opened the box, revealing a key with a keychain attached with Alexa&#39;s name on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want me to move in with you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh yeah,&quot; Tom said in confusion. &quot;With all the time we spend together, I thought us living together would be great. Did...did you think I was going to ask you to marry me?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Alexa replied defensively. &quot;No! Of course not! After all we&#39;ve been together like 6 months. That&#39;s way to quick!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa?&quot;<br />
<br />
Alexa frowned, swatting Tom&#39;s arm. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; she said angrily. &quot;Who the hell asks their girlfriend to move in with them by giving them a ring box.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow,&quot; Tom said quickly. &quot;I wanted to surprise you and this was the smallest box I could find that held the key securely. Why are you hitting me? I&#39;m just trying to take our relationship to the next level. What in the hell are you so mad about?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;m calling bullshit,&quot; Tom grumbled, rubbing the sore spot on his arm. &quot;Alexa... did....did you want to get married?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO,&quot; Alexa said quickly, her face flushing in embarrassment. &quot;I mean yes! I mean...I don&#39;t know...someday?&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom smirked, the gesture both irritating and endearing to Alexa. It was hard to deny that the woman had fallen head over heels for the young wizard. Tom was confident, strong, funny. He made Alexa feel those same qualities by just standing next to him. Deep down, she had a feeling that this was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. It just felt a bit soon. Alexa after all was always practical. It was a trait that even her heart couldn&#39;t surpass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alexa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know you&#39;re adorable when you get all flustered,&quot; Tom chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up,&quot; Alexa grinned, playfully pushing Tom.<br />
<br />
Tom laughed, the couple embracing the awkwardness of the situation. As the laughter subsided, Tom now took Alexa&#39;s hand in his. The couple gazing into each other&#39;s eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t thinking about that too,&quot; Tom said softly. &quot;But, I&#39;m a bit old fashioned and it still feels a bit early. If we are going to do THAT. I want to do it the right way. Meet your family, get your father&#39;s permission, that sort of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Alexa said, a smile forming on her face. &quot;And thanks. I was hoping you would think that way too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, &quot; Tom now asked awkwardly. &quot;Does that mean you don&#39;t want to move in with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a toothbrush here and I already started taking over some of your closet space,&quot; Alexa giggled, snatching the key before giving Tom a passionate kiss. &quot;Of course I&#39;ll move in!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tom smiled, the two embracing before a an odd look crossed Tom&#39;s face. &quot;What do you mean you already took over my closet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys never notice,&quot; Alexa smirked. &quot;I&#39;ve been adding some of my clothes to it since the first night I stayed over. How do you think I always have fresh suits for work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I hadn&#39;t even thought of that,&quot; Tom stammered. &quot;I just thought you borrowed some of mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do that too,&quot; Alexa grinned. &quot;But that&#39;s mostly your hoodies. Guys never notice when a girl begins taking over a closet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a sneaky little cat aren&#39;t you?&quot; Tom laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;About time you noticed Gandalf,&quot; Alexa smiled as the pair laughed. Tom and Alexa kissed, the Nekomata cuddling with Tom as she lay her head on the wizard&#39;s strong chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too Alexa,&quot; Tom answered, running his hand through the woman&#39;s brunette hair. &quot;With all my heart.&quot;</p>
