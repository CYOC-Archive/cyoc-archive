<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I take a look at the stopwatch on my phone, it&#39;s been fourteen hours since my masterpiece has been turned on. I have been awake the entire time and have been enjoying every moment. In this time I have been reflecting on my life and what has brought me to this, to what I consider to be my greatest piece of work. <br />
<br />
My story starts when I was seven years old, my family’s doctor Dr.Steadman, who helps both my father Steve and mother Alex give up smoking and preserves years of their lives. From this moment, I knew I wanted to be a doctor. I go through the process of doing well although high school and getting accepted into a top-ranked college. From there, I went on to university majoring in biomedical engineering and going through the ”pre-med grind” of rigorous course work, extracurricular activities, shadowing/volunteering, taking the MCAT, and losing my shit when I thought my doctor dreams would be over because I got a C in organic chemistry. One of my favorite doctors to shadow, Dr. Smith-Taylor, was a neurosurgeon, and when I shadowed him something just clicked and I knew I wanted to be a neurosurgeon. I also got to do an internship with one of my professors Dr.Seller where I enjoyed assisting in his gene/tissue engineering experiments. I eventually found my way into a seven-year M.D./Ph.D. program where I also got to truly show my talent where I made groundbreaking research earning myself a Ph.D. in biotechnology. Sure it was different from my biomedical engineering background but it would only add to my repertoire as a doctor/researcher. <br />
<br />
With that out of the way, an arduous seven-year neurosurgery residency awaited me. It was absolutely brutal and I reached my breaking point multiple times. Although through the pain, I was able to give care and alleviate the pain from many patients. I even got to publish many papers and received some praise. I also discovered I hated the inefficiencies and bureaucracy of academic medicine. Despite this, I became an assistant professor for a little while, until I got an offer to be the head of R&D at XrX pharmaceuticals, who had been taking notice of my work. I jumped at this opportunity, while I was a little saddened that I wouldn&#39;t able to treat patients directly nor operate anymore, I knew I could do so much more to help people. <br />
<br />
Ten years later, I have been on teams that have created everything from spinal instrumentation, immunotherapy, and stem cell technology, being involved from bench work to bringing the product to market. We as a team have been able to help many patients. Due to my good work, I have even gained a seat on the company&#39;s board, giving me more power and money. Although, my schedule can be hectic at times, I have more flexibility as a researcher/administrator at XrX. This has allowed me to take better care of my body and rediscovering my love of the sci-fi genre, and two sub-topics within it, cloning and transformation. There is something I find interesting about creating a perfect copy of a person and I also find the act of transformation to be so amazing. That&#39;s when an idea came into my head, a machine that could turn one person into a complete physical and psychological copy of another. <br />
<br />
One of my research teams thought I was proposing this as a joke but I assured them, I was committed to creating this technology. Due to the amount of money, I make for the company and my position, the rest of the board was fine with me doing this side passion project I called project multiplicity. Once I created the technology, it was amazing but came with one nasty side effect, once a subject was turned into a clone of someone, they could not be revived in any way shape or form. However given the people I anticipate who will use this technology, revival of the subject is not a concern. Now came the question of who will be cloned and who will be the subject to be molded into the clone for my use? My mind sprang to one of the lab techs, Matt. God, he was a dick, always showed up late, and had a bad attitude, everyone hated him. Plus HR found his very problematic social media and I was going to fire him until I found out, he had no family or friends. The jackass was a perfect specimen for me. The rest of the board was shocked at my proposal but with the prospect of having another me in the company, they gave me the green light and we prepared paperwork to keep us safe. I then brought Matt over to the lab under the guise of a promotion offer fourteen hours ago and shoved him into the first fully operational Clone Machine.<br />
<br />
It was so satisfying watching his body change. First, he shrank in height going from 6’2” to my height of 5’7”. His face full of pimples morphed into my blemish-free one, before his red hair became black and grew to reach down to his chest. His stomach got more toned like mine and I can see my D cups forming. His body became lean and toned all over just like mine. His eyes were open and changed into my shade of green. Then the kicker came when his small penis became a perfect recreation of my vagina. Then I saw on the screen, the true workhorse of the transformation, the neuropsychological rewriting process. Through a combination of nanobots and gene editing drugs being pumped into the subjects, Matt’s brain and mind are officially erased and replaced with mine. After fourteen hours and twenty-two minutes, there are now two Dr. Rose Prowlers in existence. The chamber door opens and as expected my new clone is weak and I help her to a chair in the room. She pants as she is tired and probably thirsty. I go get her a glass of water and she gulps it down. She and I just stare at each other for a bit and then she smiles. <br />
<br />
”It worked Rose! There are two of us!” <br />
<br />
”I know isn&#39;t it great!” <br />
<br />
”Okay so I have memories of everything you did up to the fake promotion angle, thank you so much for getting rid of Matt! He was just a horrible person, thank goodness something good could come out of his miserable existence!” <br />
<br />
”You’re welcome Rose, trust me, everyone will be happy knowing he&#39;s gone and even happier knowing there are two of us!” <br />
<br />
”By the way, how long did it take to create to me?” <br />
<br />
”Just a little over fourteen hours.” <br />
<br />
”Oh wow, you stayed up all that time from last night?”<br />
<br />
”Yes and you know fourteen hours is light work for us.”<br />
<br />
”Of course, so are we both heading to work, am I going and you taking the day off, or what are we doing?”<br />
<br />
”We will alternate weeks. But for now, I have decided to cash in on some well-deserved vaccination time Rose.”<br />
<br />
”Oh yeah we have those!” <br />
<br />
”Yes and I intend to get to know myself better. But before we do that I have to do one quick check.” <br />
<br />
”Here we go!” As my clone knows what I am going to do<br />
<br />
She gets up and I examine her butt to see a miniature serial number and barcode on the right butt cheek, as well as on the roof of her mouth. This is to help potential users of my device to keep track of clones especially if they have multiple ones, and to serve as a verification of who the clone is, finally these two sets of markings serve as indicators of a successful cloning process, if both are not present, then the clone must go back into the clone machine for additional time. <br />
<br />
After I conclude my check, I hand her a pair of underwear, a bra, a button dress shirt, slacks, a white coat, and some black dress shoes. She ties her hair up in a ponytail and now we look indistinguishable from each other. With that, we got out of the secret lab and drove back to our breathtaking lakefront   home. This was another reason why I love my job at XrX, although not my primary goal for becoming a doctor, the money I make with XrX is amazing and that is why I can afford such a luxurious lifestyle now. My clone and I decide to split our duties. I will go grab some clothes for us to change into while she makes some oatmeal. I grab us some leggings and t-shirts and I make my way to the dining room. I change into a blue t-shirt and black leggings and make my way to the kitchen where I see her making some oatmeal. I give her a tap on the shoulder and I hand her clothes to change into while I watch the oatmeal. She comes back wearing red leggings and a white t-shirt. <br />
<br />
We then have oatmeal together and chat. I have never felt so in tune with someone for quite some time, even if she was just a clone of me. I haven&#39;t had anyone close to me in a while, my parents died in a plane crash during my fourth year of residency, all I have no siblings or cousins, and I have never had a boyfriend or girlfriend at all. All of my mentors are gone. I mean there&#39;s my research teams but it always feels like I am just their superior not like a personal friend. Now that there is someone that truly understands me, I just feel a lot of emotion suddenly bubble over and I start to shed tears. My clone sees this and holds my hand, and she wipes the tears off my face before she starts to tear up herself. <br />
<br />
”I know how you feel Rose, we&#39;ll never be alone again!” She says before kissing me <br />
<br />
In my 46 years of life, I have never felt this kind of love in my life. I didn&#39;t care if this was narcissistic, I was going to make love to myself in the most literal way possible. My clone and I hold hands as we rush to the bedroom. First, we let our hair down and we both take a sniff, and we smile once the aroma hits our noses. We both take off our clothes and are naked. My clone and I have the same fit body, and we strike a few seductive poses, knowing that we are both getting wetter. I cannot take it anymore and shove her to the bed. I know exactly how to stimulate her and I start with those breasts, my perfect breasts. I take the nipple in my mouth and go counter-clockwise with my tongue. She starts to moan our name and I feel so wet as she uses her free hand to finger my pussy. She knows right where I want it and I moan so loud. I then sit on her face and she begins to lick my pussy and God I am experiencing a new level of euphoria, I just keep screaming like a madwoman. Then I feel my orgasm kick in and I convulse in ecstasy as I cum so hard. I then take her pussy in my mouth to repay my clone and give her an orgasm just like she did to me. I love hearing her cum and then we cuddle, excited knowing we are going to have a great vacation before returning to our lab with renewed vigor, unlocking the full potential of our Clone Machine technology.</p>
