<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want a hot girlfriend to bully me,” Phil admitted with a gaze at Stella like she’d be the one to fulfill that desire. Her eyes flared red and she raised a hand snapping her fingers.<br />
<br />
“Granted,” she told him before shoving him off her, thrusting his clothes into his arms, and pushing him out into the hall with a bundle of clothes held over his crotch. He had to scurry to his own dorm room and once he was locked inside he sighed.<br />
<br />
“Guess that’s the end of that,” he sighed before pulling his clothes over his body and laying down in his own bed. He picked up his phone and blinked in suprise.<br />
<br />
“Get over here cuntwrap,” was a text on his phone. He looked left and right in confusion before texting back.<br />
<br />
‘Get over where?’ He asked.<br />
<br />
‘Dorm 213 you fucking dumbass. Hopefully you’re being an idiot because all your blood’s in your dick already but to be fair you were a moron before I started turning you on.’<br />
<br />
He got up from the bed and wandered out of his dorm room, down the hall, down a flight of stairs, and all the way to room 213. He knocked, not sure what to expect and a few seconds later the door was thrown open.<br />
<br />
The room’s occupant was hot. She was about a head and a half shorter than him and had a hateful glare on her face like he a pile of dog shit she’s stepped in. She was dressed in a tee shirt with a graphic skull on it being stabbed by a knife that said “death to the patriarchy” and panties, nothing more. Her hair was shaven on the sides but long on the top and back, braided back in a long braid of pitch black hair about as dark as the mascara drawn around her eyes, water streaked to look like she’d been crying.<br />
<br />
“What are you waiting for dumbass? An invitation?!” She demanded before entering her dorm again and leaving him to follow.<br />
<br />
The interior was filled with plants that were well taken care of and flourishing, a couple of feminist lit books lay scattered on a coffee table and there was a guitar next to them.<br />
<br />
“Hey sweetie, you’re looking so good tonight,” she spoke in a sweet tone. It took Phil a second to realize she was talking to one of her plants, gazing at a couple unopened flower buds. She the. Turned to him, looking amazing with that dark mascara running from her eyes. “Hey fuckbucket, get that god damned dick out.”<br />
<br />
He didn’t dare disobey, he pulled his fly down and unleashed his cock to the air. She didn’t look impressed but marched up to him anyway, grabbing him by the shirt and dragging him to her room. She thrust him on the bed and pulled her top off, she wasn’t wearing a bra so her breasts bounced beautifully. He grinned stupidly at her and she stared at him almost in disgust.<br />
<br />
“Ooh, someone like objectifying me?!” She demanded and he shrunk back feeling flustered. “God I hate men, you’re all fucking pigs, only good for one thing.”<br />
<br />
He knew what that thing was and reached out to fee her but she slapped his hand away glaring at him hatefully.<br />
<br />
“Dumbass!” She shouted before jabbing a thumb at herself. “You’re my fucktoy! How many times do I have to explain that you fucking cunt. God why did I have to be straight! The only part of you worth anything is your dick.”<br />
<br />
He couldn’t have been more turned on, she whipped a condom at him and screamed at him while he struggled to open it and pull it on his dick. She then mounted him and started talking about how she’d had a better fucking from plastic dildos. When he tried to touch her waist she slapped his hand away and began berating him about how she wasn’t a fucking doll and how she was in control. She insulted his weight, his dick size, his method, and the measly amount of cum he delivered into that condom.<br />
<br />
“Fucking loser, why do I even fuck you at all,” she spat once he was done. She then sat down on the bed and started ordering him to finish the job by eating out her pussy. He didn’t dare disobey, not that he was good enough. She insulted him and complained the entire time until she finally orgasmed. She then had him lay back down and lay next to him with his arm around her.<br />
<br />
“Work on your god damned muscles, if I’m fucking a dude I better have a nice pec to lay my head on afterwards,” she ranted while glaring at him. He found that so hot, he wanted to go again but whenever he moved to touch her she’d start shouting at him about how she hadn’t consented yet. Just being told no was so hot. He lay there with this asshole of a chick while she ranted about guys in her feminist literature class, societal problems, and how her music wasn’t clicking. All his listening was rewarded when she allowed him to kiss her.<br />
<br />
“Your fucking breath reeks,” she complained while glaring him in the eyes while he smiled stupidly back, already hard from that insult. “And use tongue, here let me show you how to fucking kiss!”<br />
<br />
Oh god her tongue was good, she made his dick start throbbing with just one kiss and she took note of his rising cock.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me, you better have some actual cream this time,” she grumbled before sliding herself down the bed and starting to suck him off. Her tongue was like magic and her lips were so soft. She kept complaining with her mouth full and the vibrations made his entire dick shudder. It wasn’t long before he came.<br />
<br />
She was in control the whole time, complaining that guys always wanted control, she chose the positions, she choose when they stopped, and she was incapable of giving a compliment, it was perfect, she was perfect. He loved her.<br />
<br />
“I hate guys, but I guess you’re the one I hate the least, the least useless one,” she told him while he was mounting her from behind, every thrust making her breasts shake. It was such a backhanded compliment, he loved it. He couldn’t help himself, a jet of cum escaped his dick and she rocked her beautiful hips to receive it. Once he was done she turned around with a glare in her eyes. “That’s it?! You useless chode! I wanted a cream pie and you gave me that!”<br />
<br />
He was hard again in seconds while she spat insults at him in rapid fire.</p>
