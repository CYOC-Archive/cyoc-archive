<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Standing in front of your front porch while  under the moth-battered overhead light were two anubian jackals. they were both like the Egyptian god Anubis, but That was the best way you could describe them as they had heads, fur, feet, and tails like any jackal. they were walking on two feet instead of on all fours as The one to your left was very muscular, but also slim that he was wearing a tight black leather jacket over his white shirt with a college logo on it that his jeans were also leather as they were outlining his rather muscular thighs. He was then leaning against the door frame while standing there casually that one of his ears were pierced with two Sterling gold Hoop Earrings on his right.<br />
<br />
The other one, on your right, is a bit smaller and younger then he was is when you thought that he could be his son. arms folded across his chest while standing a little ways in front of him as he was wearing khakis that He has his paws jammed into his pockets and was looking rather sullen with his blue jean tank top jacket outfit. <br />
<br />
You just stand there with your heart fluttering that your eyes were wide open. you didn&#39;t know what to think, say, or do. soon the muscular one licks his muzzle while he smiles, laughs a little bit, and said in his voice that it sounded like a college student. &quot;Hey there, I know it&#39;s late with the introductions and everything as it took us longer than planned to get here. and I know that this may sound a little weird to you and everything, but do you have any party drinks and beer laying around? We&#39;re planning to have a party this weekend and as you can tell that we don&#39;t have any. so um... Can we borrow some?&quot; Your eyes flit to the one on the right, who nods eagerly. &quot;Uh... um....&quot; you stammer. It was a lot to take in at this point.<br />
<br />
the muscular one smacked his head as he then said to you, &quot;oh, sorry. where are my manners. I am Skylar, but everyone calls me Sky. and this here is my son, Raksha.&quot; the muscular one, Skylar said while offering his hand out to you that not wanting to be rude is when you take it and shake it as you gave them your name. Raksha was just standing back a few feet from the door, nervously as he waved at you with his paw-like hand. “We’re getting a pizza later tonight too. if you ever want to hang out sometime, just come on over. well we don&#39;t want to interfere anymore than we have already of your evening&quot; Skylar said while indicating as he caught the scent of your dinner.<br />
<br />
The younger one, Raksha , grunts while waving around his paw in the air, smirking a bit. “Oh boy… get over it quickly now. it&#39;s not like We’re not gonna bite you...much.&quot;<br />
<br />
“I told you this wasn’t such a good -”<br />
<br />
“what, You got any better ideas?!” Raksha snapped at Skylar , who clammed up and turned away. “Otherwise there&#39;s no way we’re getting that party ready for this weekend.&quot;<br />
<br />
trying to find the words for your voice that you squeeze them out of you. “I uh… never seen, umm... before…” choking on your own breath that You’re regretting saying those words already, But Raksha was smiling at you, or At least you think it was a smile. “Yeah, well - ”<br />
<br />
before anyone could speak another word is when from behind you in the dining room is where you hear your mother call out. &quot;honey, Who’s at the door?&quot; your mother&#39;s voice echoes from the dining room. &quot;Uh... give me a minute...&quot; You call back. You look back at the muscular one, who smiles gain, baring his sharp teeth. &quot;“Just a second…&quot; you said as you shot the door.<br />
<br />
you can’t let your mother see who… what’s at the front door! You’re not sure what to do… You gulp down hard as You press your back against the door and take a few deep breaths. &quot;Oh my god, Is this really happening? Are… are they real?&quot; You look through the peephole in the door, seeing Raksha and Skylar talking that they looked liked they were arguing about something. They’re... they looked too real to be costumes. Holy shit, what do you do? There&#39;s… there’s something about them that was intriguing you. You can’t just go back to the kitchen and pretend nothing happened! you were thinking about them incessantly that Your brain was going into overdrive, but you must stay casual and take care of matters as you walked over to the kitchen where your mother and sisters are eating.<br />
<br />
“You look a bit flustered - what is it?”<br />
<br />
“N-nothing… nothing, umm… the neighbors need some party drinks for the weekend, so I&#39;m helping them out.&quot;<br />
<br />
“so, They finally showed up?” Lucy asked.<br />
<br />
“I guess…” you responded, shrugging.<br />
<br />
“What about your meal?”<br />
<br />
“I&#39;ll reheat it and eat it later… don’t worry,” you say, already turning back to the door.<br />
<br />
“Be back in half an hour!” she yells back. Hopefully she and your sisters will be preoccupied tonight. You walk back to the door as it was time to figure out what’s going on. You open it a small crack, enough to reveal the two jackals. The situation quickly increases your anxiety, but Raksha looks you down, genuinely happy you came back to the door. “So! where&#39;s the beverage?&quot;  Looking to Skylar that he smiles wryly, but maintains his silence. With a yearning wave to follow, you find yourself crossing the grassy yard over to the garage.<br />
<br />
&quot;We keep the beer and drinks in a fridge that&#39;s in the garage. Follow me.&quot; You whisper. High-fiving each other, Skyler and Raksha follow you to the garage. You lead them to the garage and open the fridge. &quot;Score!&quot; Skylar whispers, and heaves a huge container onto his beefy shoulder, holding it up with his massive paw. &quot;Raksha, you grab those two.&quot; He instructs. Raksha goes forward and picks up two small boxes, one in each hand. You open the garage door for them. &quot;Thanks for the help, kid. We won&#39;t forget this.&quot; Skylar said. They walk out of the garage and back across the lawn. You watch them go up the front porch, but Before they had a chance to go in is when they set the beer down and wave. Waving back, you put your hand down as they unlock the door and go into the house. Shaking your head in disbelief that you you snatch out a few soda cans from the fridge for yourself and your sisters and head back to the dining room. closing the garage door behind you is when you wondered if you should go to that party this weekend and if this whole experience was just a dream.</p>
