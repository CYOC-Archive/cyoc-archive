<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the cosmic energy spreading toward the city Avery was rushing to get the suits ready. Meanwhile, Kent and his men were watching the footage extracted from X. It would be difficult to traverse but if the drones from earlier were to return they could use them to get to what had been the farm and then track down where X had left the jungle. Finally, Colt was busy watching the spread on his screen. What seemed to be random surges now looked more like waves of energy. At first, the energy was like energy blasts sent into the atmosphere. That is what got the attention of the world. But now that chaotic volcano was spewing out energy like magma. he had geologists brought to the base and set up a seismic radar to monitor for the next surge. The alarm bells went off across the base as the next surge began building up. &quot;Avery, your time to build those suits is almost up,&quot; Colt said as the plains-like area spread halfway to the city before changing again.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
While the suburb&#39;s evacuation east of the city was mostly a success the city itself wasn&#39;t so fortunate. Even though Las Sombra was a small city it still had almost 90,000 citizens. That with the addition of the eastern side of the town being advised against led to some major gridlock. It was so bad that some people had abandoned their cars to make a run for it. This of course only led to more traffic. Some even realized there wasn&#39;t enough time to escape. Brain Johnson was one of these people. He was an employee at the Sombra Zoo. All the other staff had fled but he realized these animals would be alone with whatever fate. Even though he only worked in the petting zoo section he felt like he was responsible for their well-being. As such he was feeding them when the sky grew dark.  <br />
<br />
From the zoo&#39;s exterior walls, a fog rolled over them. It soon became hard to see anything but Brian heard creaking and cracking and knew his fate was sealed. He sighed and picked up a clean carrot meant for the rabbits. Figuring he would probably be no smarter than them he decided he wanted his final meal to be his animal&#39;s favorite. The fog had made it hard to see the carrot wasn&#39;t orange but green. It had been hit with the tiniest bit of green energy. As a result, when Brian bit into the carrot he was shocked to feel himself growing. The seventeen-year-old soon began outgrowing his clothes as his muscles and height grew. Behind him, a lamppost appeared illuminating the area and clearing the fog enough for Brian to see his now green hands. His ears elongated as the green fur covered them. His clothes couldn&#39;t take the strain. His sleeves ripping at the shoulder seams. His stomach was almost completely exposed. The seems on his thighs broke revealing more green fur. His laces broke as the front of his shoes bunched up. Brian closed his eyes as his changes progressed but couldn&#39;t help but take a peak. His shirt ripped apart as the green fur reached his shoulders. It grew a little longer and spiky there. Mint green fur appeared between his pecs. Between his long pointed ears, his brown hair began dying green. Abs appeared on his exposed stomach as his pants were on their last legs. His shoes had broken open and revealed large lagomorph paws. His clothes finally gave as he instantly flexed his muscles. Green fur covers him from the tips of his long ears to his large feet. It was long and spiky around his elbows, armpits, and sides of his knees and upper calves. A big bushy rabbit&#39;s tail hung over his underpants, oddly those were the only articles of clothing to change with him. However, they looked more like a Speedo than Briefs. He had thick min green chest fur between his pecs, his nipples had turned mint themselves. His face had rapidly transformed giving him buck teeth and a triangular nose at the end of his muzzle. His ears took up most of the top of his head. A bit of his dark green hair remained between them, the small pine green streak still visible above his left eye. His blue eyes blinked in confusion. he felt like himself but was a foot taller than the lamppost. He also felt a year older. In the lantern&#39;s glass, he saw his new body. He didn&#39;t feel shocked, he felt amazing. Suddenly his destroyed clothing vanished, including his underwear leaving him naked. Around him, he became aware of noises. Looking around he saw male and female anthro&#39;s of his animals. That term didn&#39;t feel like part of his job. These multicolored creatures looked lost.  <br />
<br />
Talking to them revealed while they looked like adults they had the mental age of their ages. Given how he&#39;d known them since last year he knew that some were no older than two. Oddly enough he felt like a proud dad to these guys. A light is soon shown from where the animal&#39;s pens used to be. Know was what could only be described as a mansion. Holding a candle was an orange rabbit. Somewhere deep down Brian realized this was Sarah. From what he remembered Sarah was their oldest rabbit being sixteen. Before all this, he knew soon Sarah would have to be put down. Now however she looked like the only one besides him to have his level of knowledge, maybe a year off. Sarah and Brian talked and it seemed it was fate for them. Then they heard a gate open. A couple of lanterns revealed multiple anthros. Brian saw a yellow tiger man, a blue polar bear, and a red gorilla approach him. It was here he learned the entire zoo had become an anthro village. The problem was most of the villagers had the minds of kids. Felix the tiger was in his twenties, Aurora the polar bear was eighteen, and Tamu was the oldest at thirty. The three told Brian of their plight. Brian was the only former human and they were looking to him for guidance. Brian felt like this wasn&#39;t a part-time job anymore. <br />

Another person who knew there was no escape was Bianca. The woman was in the park enjoying her last moments when the fog hit her. Just before it did a pink energy hit her first. Her clothing disappeared as she became incredibly horny. Antlers pushed from her scalp as her ears grew. Her face pushed out into a muzzle as her breast inflated. Fur covered her head to all four hoofs. She now had her legs replaced with the body of a dear. Thick creme fur grew above her breasts and around her waist. Her deer body wasn&#39;t a doe&#39;s though, it was a mighty buck. She could feel the heavy balls sag in the dark brown sack and her new cock escaped its sheath. Unable to think she grabbed the new dick by spreading her rear legs as she laid down. Despite her new body Bianca still had her earrings, long blue hair, and mind. The latter is fogged in lust at the moment but still there. When she came to her senses she found herself in a winter wonderland. Looking at her new buck parts she felt oddly proud of her changes.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Diane decided to drink everything she could in her bar before her beverages were gone. Being an addict didn&#39;t help her decision. She was downing another beer as people ran past her bar. A fog seemed to enter the room from every vent and crack. The redhead didn&#39;t care as she guzzled her beverage down. Her clothing liquefied as her body gained a massive amount of weight. Her upper body gained some muscle giving her a pear shape as the more monstrous changes began. Her skin became a deep blue as she gained neon blue body hair on her elbows, between her breasts, bush, and balls. Above his new additions, a gigantic inhuman cock grew as long as her legs. It was thicker at the end than at the base. His breasts became moobs as he lost digits, two on his feet and one on his hands. His hair became neon blue spikes down his neck as he lost his eyes. His teeth melted into his mouth becoming a jagged line with a neon blue tongue. His nipples became neon blue and opened to reveal his new eyes. He stumbled out of his cave and saw a different city. However, due to him not being fortunate enough to be hit by the energy before the fog, he believed this was always the case. Seeing a small pink monster he approached her. The axolotl didn&#39;t want anything to do with him at first but Dick emanated a musk from his dick and the other mutant&#39;s inhabitants were gone. She latched on to that cock and began sucking.  <br />
<br />

<br />
Not all those about to be transformed were resigned to their fates. The couple Amelia and Robin were some of these people. They had successfully avoided going through the city and were at a gas station northeast of Las Sombra. The only reason they had gotten this far was the mayor&#39;s statement of not going east. The risk seemed worth it until they ran low on gas. Robin had forgotten to fill the tank when he left work the night before. As a result, they were struggling to figure out how the pumps worked as the workers at the station had fled. Robin then felt a rumble as he put the nozzle in his car&#39;s gas tank. Amelia had just gotten the pumps working when the landscape changed. Around them was now a barren desert. Robin called for Amelia to run to the car as he let go of the pump.  <br />
<br />
However, once he got in a blast of black and white energy hit his ride. Blinking his eyes he felt something was seriously wrong. He now saw the outside of his car. Pushing himself upright he found himself taller than the pumps. Looking down he saw tires connected to large black rods that bent when he tried moving his arms. he then became aware of the gas leaking from the hose. The reflection showed his black car with its white stripes and front bumper but it was wrong. On the bumper was a long line across it that extended down when he opened his mouth in shock. On the headlights were two tiny pupils that followed his gaze. Looking at the tires he came to the realization he was his car. The two had merged. When Robin panicked and thought he needed hands and feet he suddenly felt a stretching sensation. The tires on his new legs and arms began changing. He now had three-toed &#39;paws&#39; and hands.  <br />
<br />
Feeling himself up and down he found a bit of his green shirt was now stuck to him around his &#39;shoulders&#39;  he then let out a beep as the ground beneath him turned liquid. Not only that but the entire gas station melted into this oily goo. From it a small bog formed for the surrounding 100 square feet. Everything in it was made of either gas, oil, or tar. Robin inadvertently honked its horn when it saw something clawing through the gunk. Confusion went across Robin&#39;s face as it knew it was a car. It knew that wasn&#39;t true but its thoughts kept referring to itself as it and the car. It was shaken from its thoughts as the creature grabbed it.  <br />
<br />
Robin fought as the monster roared at him. he was large and buff. A long tail like that of a shark mixed with a snake hung from his rear. His face was just an open maw with strands of goo between the thin gaps, around his head tendrils wrapped around Robin&#39;s mouth. Robin was soon covered completely by him, in what it thought was the final moment the car realized that Amelia had been lost to the goo. &quot;Amelia&quot; its voice was mechanical and muffled. The creature seemed to stop before it continued. Robin then felt his mouth, gas tank, and exhaust pipe being filled by the manly beast. Oddly enough he liked the taste of it. Soon he felt his body be freed. Looking around he didn&#39;t see the creature he thought was Amelia. Then he felt his systems run a diagnostic. He soon found that &#39;Amelia&#39; was now what fueled him. Robin carefully got out of the bog and onto a path. This path led back to the city. It figured there was no point in escaping now. Well, at least they will be together forever like they wanted now. <br />

 Alex and his family were stuck in traffic. They had successfully escaped the suburb but unfortunately ran into the gridlock immediately after. With no other choice, the family had to abandon their car on the side of the road and walk. His wife Patrica held their nine-year-old son Austin&#39;s hand as they carried what they could on their backs. Behind him was his eldest daughter, Susie who was seventeen years old. Next to her was Tia who was a year younger. Even as they tried to flee on foot thousands of others were trying the same thing. A rumble was soon felt and screaming came from behind them. Alex looked back to see a thick fog enveloping even the highest buildings. Knowing there was no way to outrun this he instructed his family to go into the open cafe. Thankfully this helped his family avoid the stampede of people but not the fog. The second it completely enveloped them their changes began. Patrica was the first to start changing. Her breasts lost their perkiness and fell on her growing stomach. Her new pot belly ripped apart her blouse as her bra just disappeared. Orange fur soon spread across her body as her arms and legs gained a massive amount of muscle. Her shoes faded away to reveal a pair of hoofs. A long tail poked through her skirt as she rose to an impressive height of eight feet. Her ripped shirt became an open black sleeveless jacket and her skirt became a pair of green shorts. On his crotch, a large bulge grew and two almost as large bulges appeared beneath it. Patrica&#39;s neck thickened as she pulled down his pants a bit and fished out his huge cock. He gained an Adam&#39;s apple as he pumped his new cock. His face pushed into a snout with his nose becoming a triangle and becoming dull pink. Two tusks poked from his lips. His once long blond hair became a green mohawk-like main down his head and neck. On either side, his ears moved and became short triangles. His eyebrows became bushy and green. He let out a deep squeal as he painted the door with his cum. Opening his eyes revealed the whites were tinted yellow slightly and the pupils were small. Hearing a growl he saw a muscle grey wolf anthro who was pissed off at him. he wore a black sleeveless shirt that showed off his abdomen and shoulders along with a white undershirt ad blue shorts. The reason for his anger was clear. Despite the wolf&#39;s muscular torso both his height and cock were shorter than him. Pete had a good head over the wolf and his dick was several inches longer. He ruffled the man&#39;s short black hair and teased him. This led the wolf to punch the boar&#39;s stomach, his anger became shock and horror as his fist went into the fat and Pete gave an angry grin. With one punch he sent the wolf sailing across the room. When he got up the wolf seemed impressed and apologized. He introduced himself as Alex. A cough soon made the two realize they weren&#39;t alone. The one who coughed was a hooded cobra. He had black and red scales with a golden-scaled front and jaw. His clothing consisted of oddly sexual items like a spiked choker, leather straps across his torso connected to two steel rings which were redundant because of his lack of nipples, and a gold cock cover. Ty instructed them this gym was either for the pleasure of working not fighting. Behind him, a feral dragon was giving himself a blowjob before realizing he was being watched. He chuckled as he got on all fours and introduced himself as Streak the Bold. He was mostly black with a white underside. He had white horns and claws and blue markings and membranes between his paws, wings, and the spines down to the base of his tail. Next to him was Axe the wolf centaur. He was black with a white muzzle, arms and legs, and underside/front. His humanoid body was an anthro wolf and he had a large horse-like cock that made the two muscled anthros feel ashamed. Ty then asked where the two came from. Both tried to explain but found they couldn&#39;t remember. Turns out it wasn&#39;t just them, the other three had no memories before jacking off in the gym. However, through their scents, they found that they were related somehow. Streak suggests they were brothers seeing as they were the same age. The others agreed to this. Once that was out of the way the five of them began working out. Sadly none of them remembered their lives before. <br />

Kent and his group rushed into the lab. &quot;doc, we&#39;re out of time&quot; Kent said as they stood before Avery. John sighed as he unveiled four suits, well three and a half. &quot;we had to take precedence with the C.P.U. so even if the suits fail you&#39;ll still have your minds, hopefully,&quot; the doctor tried saying that last bit under his breath but they all heard him. &quot;yeah but um... who gets that one?&quot; Sam pointed to the half-finished one. &quot;I&#39;ll take it,&quot; Sally said. She blamed herself for not noticing the mushrooms. If she could take one for the team she would. John instructed Avery and X to help them with the suits as he monitored the spread. Colt opened the door to see four X&#39;s in varying colors, the five one showed a person inside it. On their chests were their first names. Kent was black with silver markings. Sam was green with black markings. Abigail was yellow with white markings and Sally was in the unfinished one which was unpainted. &quot;X insisted on painting them when they were done&quot; Cynthia informed him. X gave a happy emoji at that. A tumble was soon felt throughout the base. &quot;Kent it seems we won&#39;t be able to figure out what has happened here. You all need to get to that volcano and find out what happened and how to stop it. Then get to the first unchanged base you can locate and fix this if possible&quot; As Colt finished the fog was entering from the vents and doors. &quot;good luck&quot; Colt said as he, Doctor Avery, and Cynthia were covered by the mist. Sally let out a moan as a large dick broke through her pants. From the moans, Kent heard she was not alone.</p>
