<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Musca Domestica Merritt<br />
<br />
Merritt felt a degree of satisfaction at the transformations that he was now familiar with.  Female Merritt, bird Merritt, dog Merritt, black Merritt, doll sized Merritt.  They&#39;d all have their place in working undercover.  But he needed another form to come and go without notice.<br />
<br />
He knew he&#39;d have to do this.  So, he picked out an evening when he wasn&#39;t going to be with Etta, some sort of family thing she had and started going through the Chronivac early in the afternoon.  He was very careful in going through all the menus.  He had to be with this one as it was very dangerous.  It was so different and he&#39;d be so vulnerable. <br />
<br />
There were even extra warnings in the Chronivac menus.  <br />
**WARNING – USERS MAY FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO THINK IN A DESTINATION IDENTITY IN THIS CATEGORY.**<br />
<br />
On the menu for the choice of mental identity, Merritt slid the bar to make the destination identity&#39;s mind 80% his normal one.  The footnotes said that this would give him more natural command of his new physical form but would also make him feel its instincts very strongly, though he would be able to override them.  This seemed like the sensible thing to do.<br />
<br />
First he put some sugar crystals and some honey on a saucer on the counter.  He put a few drops of water on another saucer and placed it next to that one. <br />
<br />
He opened two window, not just the glass panes but also the screens.  He put a full length mirror on the floor against a bookcase in the living room to be able to watch his transformation.  As he stripped off all his clothes, he mulled over what his goal should be.  He decided that he was going to try to enter 7 different apartments despite the residents obviously having no wish for a tiny pest like he&#39;d be to enter.<br />
<br />
He got to the end of the menus and pressed START.  The Chronivac displayed the usual ARE YOU SURE? Message<br />
<br />
He pressed start again.  He&#39;d set the transformation for 1 minute&#39;s time and to last 5 hours.<br />
<br />
Immediately his nose flattened and then disappeared from his face and his ears disappeared as well.  At the same time, two antennae both black and hairy and 18 inches long shot up from the top of his forehead.<br />
<br />
Next, Merritt&#39;s extra round trackstar buns expanded backward.  He smirked.  This wasn&#39;t so bad.  He loved that he already had a rounder ass than any other guy he knew.  But his rear expanded and expanded and expanded some more.<br />
<br />
“Hey!”<br />
<br />
This was more than he&#39;d wanted but his freakish rear kept extending further and further back and then the two sides of him fused together and the end furthest from him narrowed a bit.  But his rear end kept  expanding backward and had such mass that he fell backward onto it.  <br />
<br />
There better not be anybody who questions my dedication, thought Merritt.  Look what I&#39;m doing to myself!<br />
<br />
He glanced back over his shoulder and realized that was the new abdomen of his fly body.  And just as he fell backward, his arms and legs became thin and black and another pair of legs sprouted from his ribs.<br />
 With six legs now, Merritt was officially an insect.<br />
“Merritt Sivertson, insect.” he tried to say but the only sound that got past his now thin black lips was a sort of high pitched hum.  “Mmm-mmm Mmm-mmm-mmm, Mmm-mmm,” he heard with his sensitive new antennae.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t see much of his transformation after that as his eyes bulged out into the many lensed eyes of a housefly and it took Merritt several seconds to adjust.  <br />
<br />
But he could feel his face totally change shape, his chest bulge out into his new housefly thorax, coarse black hair cover most of his new body and his new wings sprout at the upper side of his thorax.  <br />
<br />
Finally, he got the hang of focusing his new eyes and looked at his reflection in the mirror.  He was a foot and a half, maybe two feet high.  He realized that, at the moment, he was a 165 pound fly.  <br />
<br />
He had a few moments of panic.  <br />
<br />
I can&#39;t go out there as a 165 pound fly!  I won&#39;t be able to sneak around anywhere.  Hell, people&#39;ll start shooting at me with handguns.  <br />
<br />
But he realized that the transformation wasn&#39;t over.  He could feel his insides still being remade and before that process was done, he started shrinking.  He watched the progress of his diminishment in the mirror.  <br />
A foot high fly.<br />
An 8 inch high fly.<br />
A 4 inch high fly.<br />
An inch high fly.<br />
Finally Merritt achieved his final size, with a body 3/8 of an inch long and with a wingspan of nearly a half inch.<br />
<br />
Okay, here goes, thought Merritt and he flapped his new translucent wings.  He felt his ugly new body lifting off the ground.  He flapped harder and he took off.  At first he almost ran into the mirror and then, steering away from that, into his couch.<br />
<br />
But he decided that he&#39;d made the right choice to give himself a mind that was 20% housefly.  In just seconds he was flying around his apartment and it felt . . . natural.  The process of flying was something he just instinctively handled.  <br />
<br />
Nevertheless he practiced takeoffs and landings.  The takeoffs were easy.  He just worked his new wings.  The landings were tougher.  He came in too fast a few times.  Another time he&#39;d come in slow but had left himself two inches off the kitchen counter and slowed up his wings too much resulting in his just dropping from that height.<br />
<br />
But he soon realized that his bizarre new body was resilient.  Sure, he could be swatted or crushed by one of those homo sapiens he&#39;d heard so much about but housefly Merritt could take a pounding and keep going.  <br />
He figured he should charge up before going outside so he flew down to the saucer with sugar crystals and some drops of honey that he&#39;d set up on the counter  It now seemed enormous and the sugar crystals were the size of a Rubik&#39;s cube.<br />
<br />
But it didn&#39;t matter.  Merritt hopped on the saucer to the edge of the sugar.  He vomited on it and then sucked in the sugar and vomit mix he&#39;d just made.<br />
<br />
Mmmm-mmmm!<br />
<br />
He hopped to the edge of the honey and just sucked it in, the honey already being liquid.  Then he hopped to the adjacent saucer and sucked in some water.<br />
<br />
Okay, he thought to himself.  That was a bit gross but, hey, I&#39;m a housefly.  He took a deep breath and reminded himself of all the dangers outside, not just humans.  Birds.  Bats.  Other larger flying insects like wasps, hornets and bees were at least some worry as were other flies.<br />
<br />
As he was pondering this, Merritt felt himself excrete a big, for his tiny size, chunk of feces out the end of his ridiculous abdomen.  It just came out without any intention or choice on his part.  Merritt was to find that every five to ten minutes, he&#39;d crap out a pretty big, for his new size, turd no matter where he was.  <br />
<br />
Out the window he went flying along at nearly top speed across the lawn beside the apartment building, constantly scanning for birds or other predators who might eat him before landing on a low branch of a pine sapling.  <br />
<br />
Just off to one side at another branch of the same height was a female housefly.  He could somehow immediately tell and he was shocked that he immediately felt some kind of tingle underneath himself.<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
He&#39;d forgotten all about his penis.  He&#39;d turned himself into a housefly but he still had a penis.  And that 20% of his mind that was housefly wanted to use it.  Right now.  He felt the black, spiked tube slung under his abdomen become thicker.  He hopped to turn away from her. <br />
<br />
This is insane, he thought.  I&#39;m being distracted by a desire to fuck another insect.  <br />
<br />
He took a breath, feeling he&#39;d gotten himself under control and turned back toward her.  Somehow he could tell that she was attracted to him and that she was particularly taken with his abdomen.  <br />
<br />
He flew off.  Enough of this!<br />
<br />
He flew toward the entrance.  Part way there, a robin flew over him but several feet higher.  He landed on the back end of the handbag of an old lady and hitched a ride through the doorway, defecating in her bag as he rode.  Once inside, he flew off and circled behind her then followed her into her apartment easily unnoticed.  That was one.  He got out by flying out the gap between her slider door and the frame.<br />
<br />
Once outside, he easily followed a black boy inside, went back out through the open door of his apartment and then landed on some jewish guy&#39;s yarmulke, shitting on it as he rode it into that guy&#39;s apartment.  He got out under that guy&#39;s door and was almost out of the building again when a black girl saw him and frantically swatted at him.  If he&#39;d had a face that could smirk, Merritt would have smirked at the ease with which he dodged her.  He was so much quicker than she was in this new fly body and having a mind which could think like a human he easily worked out how to dodge her.  <br />
<br />
He went flying at full speed away from the building and, without any conscious plan of it, found himself by the apartment complex&#39;s pool.  He landed his tiny self on the horizontal bar atop the chain link fence surrounding it and surveyed those present with his many lensed eyes.<br />
<br />
Yes!<br />
<br />
There she was in a barely legal pink bikini, that blond girl from two buildings over with the great ass!  Yes!  He&#39;d nearly driven into a parked car gawking at her in tight jeans making her way from her car to her building as he&#39;d driven into the complex a few days ago.   Merritt loved a perky round pair of breasts but a great ass drove him wild.  <br />
<br />
Him getting a girl with a great ass seemed perfectly fair to Merritt.  Even before fine tuning his body with the Chronivac, he&#39;d been a guy who could win a best buns contest, who didn&#39;t need to feel embarrassed at all wearing tights in a college ballet class.<br />
<br />
The blond girl lay there sunning herself and rolled over onto her stomach.  Merritt flew into the air and quickly traversed the 50 feet between them.  He hovered over her magnificent ass, the triangle of the rear of her bikini failing, gloriously, to cover much of her.  <br />
<br />
What a sight!<br />
<br />
Merritt slowly lowered himself, flapping his wings hard but in very small circles so that he controlled his descent.  Finally, yes!<br />
<br />
He touched down two inches to the right of center, feeling her soft, perfect skin under his rough legs.  He could not resist and lowered himself so that his whole body contacted her.  His housefly penis swelled and lengthened with human desire beneath him.  He raised himself up on his rear legs and then pushed down and forward simulating a thrust.  He did it again.  And again.<br />
<br />
This was fucking awesome he had his whole body in contact with that blond&#39;s great ass and now he was mock banging her with every ounce of his strength.<br />
<br />
He might&#39;ve died like that, crushed as an insect but when a shadow passed over him, housefly Merritt realized that something was up.  He got up and launched himself into the air just before . . <br />
<br />
SLAP!<br />
<br />
From over the pool and then on the other side of it, Merritt saw that the blond&#39;s dumb boyfriend had slapped her ass, hard, trying to swat him and that she&#39;d jumped up and was now angrily confronting him.<br />
<br />
Merritt wanted to smile.  He wished there was someone else at the complex to whom  he could brag about copping a feel of that great ass.  He flew to the fence on the other side of the pool and landed atop it.  <br />
Calming down now he realized that he seemed to lack any impulse control with his human mind somehow crammed into this tiny fly brain.  Now that he had a handle on how to fly he decided that next time he did this he&#39;d make his mind 90% or maybe 95%.  He&#39;d have better mission control.<br />
<br />
He scanned around making sure there were no predators around.  He sighed at the sight of that old lady with the poodle walking the ridiculously shorn thing on the walking path that ran beside the pool.  The dog stopped and squatted and produced an enormous, to Merritt, turd.<br />
<br />
The dog walked on and Merritt noted that the old lady didn&#39;t pick up after her stupid dog.  Merritt flew over and landed on the turd and gave his best vomit before inhaling several mouthsful of the turd.  <br />
<br />
He stopped.<br />
<br />
Oh my God!  What&#39;d I just do?!  I-I just ate some of that dog&#39;s shit!<br />
<br />
He flew off toward a small fountain at a bend in the walking path and landed in the millimeter deep water atop the wall around it.  He awkwardly swished his stick-like legs in the water to sort of wash himself off.  He dipped his face into it, too, and twisted his body back and forth.<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe I wouldn&#39;t be telling anybody about this experience even if I could.<br />
<br />
He flew on to the nearest apartment building and followed a woman looking at her phone into the building.  It was easy.  <br />
<br />
Merritt got into seven apartments with hours to spare before the transformation ended.  As long as he didn&#39;t fly in front of them or near their ears so that they heard him it was pretty unlikely that he was even spotted.  At the last one, he landed on a tax form on a home office desk and tried to memorize the numbers.  It was difficult.  The portion of his mind that was housefly was not helping.  He resolved, again, to make his mind less housefly next time.<br />
<br />
He went back to his apartment and practiced his flying.  Several minutes before the transformation was due to be up, he saw the time on a display that looked the size of a mural painted on a building to him now.  <br />
<br />
He flew to the living room and deftly landed on the floor in front of the mirror.  At the prescribed hour, he felt the usual electromagnetic wave pass through him and he immediately started growing.  In a few seconds, he was a 165 pound fly.  In the reverse order of the last time, he got his human eyes back, then his face, then his upper body, his insides, lost two legs felt his chest return to normal, got his taut, round trackstar buns back and lost antennae while regaining his nose and ears.<br />
<br />
Then it was done.  Another transformation he could use.</p>
