“Spencer?” Eric asked watching his girlfriend stare into space thinking. They were still in the kitchen, putting the used plates into the dishwasher. <br />
<br />
“Oh sorry, just thinking.” <br />
<br />
“What about?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing much. But I’m starting to think Kenya may be more interested in the second serving of dessert than the second.” Spencer answers honestly. There’s no point in lying to Eric. <br />
<br />
“Well, she’s been giving me these weird looks. Like the kind my mom gives people when she wants to… you know.” Spencer gives Eric one of those looks. It takes a moment for things to click in his mind, but when they do he looks surprised.<br />
<br />
“Oh! So does that mean Kenya’s… not compatible for me?” he asked. <br />
<br />
“Not necessarily,” Spencer said, unsure if now was a good time to tell him she enjoyed the occasional night with the same sex.<br />
<br />
“Why do you say that?”<br />
<br />
“It’s complicated.” Spencer knew Eric wasn’t sexually experienced at all. There’s no way he could have done all the thinking and experimenting and crap Spencer did when she first started having sex. In the end, she found she liked guys, but certainly didn’t object to the idea of spending a night with a female were. <br />
<br />
“What do you want to do?” Eric asked. <br />
<br />
“It’s only a matter of time before our parents end up downstairs. And I’m guessing you don’t want to stick around for that.” <br />
<br />
“Not really no.” Eric admitted. He was growing more and more comfortable with the whole were-sex thing, but there he still drew the line when it came to his family, “You don’t think Nate would…?”<br />
<br />
“With your own parents, hell no. With my mom? Unlikely, though she’s got no problem with the idea. Mom’s a bit looser than most people realize.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
And at least her father didn’t mind sharing, so long as she came home to him every night. Spencer got the feeling William and Martha had a similar arraignment. But Nate and Kenya couldn’t have worked anything like that out yet. They’d only been dating for a few weeks. <br />
<br />
“Ben and Alex…?”<br />
<br />
“Obviously have no interest in the opposite sex. Actually, I think they already slipped away.” Spencer noted their disappearance ever since Ben went to the bathroom upstairs. Doing more than just their “business”. <br />
<br />
“So, do you just wanna go back to your place? I know your grandfather’s there and all, he won’t mind will he?” Eric gathered from everything he’d heard about Mike Lawson, the guy would prefer to spend the evening alone. <br />
<br />
“Dad already told me to go back and keep him company. And make sure he doesn’t destroy the house.” Spencer smiles a bit. She got some of her “bad streak” from Mike and some from her mother. <br />
<br />
“Does he know about me, about us?” <br />
<br />
“I told him. Actually, he said he was looking forward to meeting you.” <br />
<br />
“Really? Is that a good thing?” <br />
<br />
“Considering the last boyfriend I had, yes. Don’t look so nervous. Grandpa is nothing like Dad. They’re both military kids, but at least Grandpa has jumped off that boat, so to speak.” Spencer said. <br />
<br />
She and Eric rejoined the others. Ben and Alex were still unaccounted for, but no one else seemed to notice or care. You could almost feel the sexual tension in the room. The willpower the women were using to keep from tearing their clothing off, and Evan and William both sitting with their legs crossed. <br />
<br />
Nate appeared a bit uncomfortable, but Kenya looked like she was soaking in every scent in the air. When she saw Spencer and Eric reenter the room she tried not to let her imagination get the better of her. If Spencer didn’t want to, then there was nothing Kenya could do about it. Of course, seeing as her mother was obviously bi, maybe Spencer was too. <br />
<br />
“I still have to run the idea past Nate. I wouldn’t blame him if he said he wasn’t up to sharing. His parents might have an open relationship, but he might not be ready for something like that yet. We’ve only just started seeing each other. And I wonder if he’s still a little uncomfortable with my past.” Kenya thought. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Ben and Alex come downstairs, only to find that the large group had started to break off. Ben’s mothers were noticeably missing, as was Maggie Lawson. Martha, William and Evan were talking to Spencer and Eric. In Eric’s hands was a large bag, filled with leftovers and such. <br />
<br />
“…home tomorrow, I promise.” Eric said, assuring his mother that he would come home. Normal, to her relief. Not that she thought Spencer would do anything like that. But Martha knew how strongly Eric felt, and he might want to hurry things along. <br />
<br />
Kenya and Nate were muttering to each other on the couch, with Kenya darting glances at Spencer every other second. Ben wondered about that, the odd looks she’d been directing at Spencer ever since the Lawsons arrived. He knew the “exotic” felines weren’t necessarily gay or bi, but it was always a strong possibility. <br />
<br />
“Would Nate and Eric be alright with their girlfriends spending the night? Would Spencer even want to?” Ben wondered. <br />
<br />
“See you later. Behave yourself. And make sure your grandfather behaves himself.” Evan instructed his daughter. She snapped a soldier salute and nodded. After Spencer and Eric left, Nate and Kenya rose to tell Nate’s parents they were going to head back to her place. <br />
<br />
“You know you’re more than welcome to join us.” Martha said as politely as she could without weirding out her son. He blushed and said something unintelligible. <br />
<br />
“I may have to take you up on that offer some other time. But I think for now, I’m going to spend my nights with this sweet young man.” Kenya said, kissing Nate’s cheek. <br />
<br />
Though she was still planning on asking Spencer if she’d want to join her and Nate later. Provided Eric would be alright with that. The younger Anderson, Kenya was given to understand, was still warming up to some aspects of were society. The frequency weres had sex, and how open they were about it being one of them. <br />
<br />
“Take care you two. And be safe.” William said, reminding the two he wasn’t ready to become a grandfather. <br />
<br />
“Of course. Thank you for a wonderful evening.” Kenya said. William and Martha smiled as they watched Nate and his exotic girlfriend walk off. <br />
<br />
“Too bad, I was hoping to add another panther to our group.” William whispers in his wife’s ear. <br />
<br />
“She did say she’d be willing to join us another time. It’s only a matter of time. She probably just wants to make sure Nate is alright with the idea. Because I can’t see him being okay with joining us and his friend’s mother.” Martha said. <br />
<br />
“There are some things that are still off limits, even to weres.” said William. He and Martha drifted back into the house, Evan trailing them, eyes glued on Martha’s behind. <br />
<br />
“Almost makes the week I had worth it.” Evan thought, licking his lips.</p>
