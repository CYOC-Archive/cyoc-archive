<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bella towered over you and everyone around you.<br />
<br />
You turned your head to Skylar, who was looking up at Bella. You could feel Skylar’s thoughts; you both knew that the only thing stopping Bella was her own imagination… you didn’t know Bella, you had no idea how creative she was. From what you understood, Bella had something of a filter. She’d be very willing to insult, bully, make fun of anyone, but would be likely to keep her fetishes and fantasies to herself. The ring requires her to announce her wishes aloud, which would mean admitting to her desires. That was the only thing limiting her. It was like Skylar before she opened up. If Bella opened up… you had no idea what kind of kinks she may have. There was so much at risk, so you stayed calm, not giving any indication of what she has the power to do.<br />
<br />
Bella looked over at Cara, still looking a lot like her sister, still acting as if she’d just been… well you suppose she had just been born, but she was a complete blank slate,<br />
“Cara,” Bella said, her mature voice almost booming as she spoke,<br />
“Yeah?” Cara replied, not in any way frightened of her incredibly powerful friend,<br />
“Grab Skylar for me,” Bella commanded.<br />
<br />
You turned to Skylar, seeing Cara approaching her from behind. You stood up, lifting Skylar as you did, stepping in front of her. You knew Cara was much stronger than you, and could adapt and become even stronger if she wanted/needed to, but you had to do something!<br />
<br />
“Actually, grab the geek as well,” Bella said. Your eyes widened, now you were in real trouble. You grabbed Skylar’s arm, unable to find any way to avoid your fate. Without the ring, neither of you had any power.<br />
Cara held her hands in front of her, opening them wide. You watched her hands growing, getting bigger and thicker. They looking like they wouldn’t even be supported with her body anymore, but she did. She grabbed you with one hand, and Skylar with the other.<br />
You felt her hand squeezing you tightly, it wasn’t hard to breathe, but it was incredibly uncomfortable. You were able to turn your neck, seeing Skylar experiencing the same discomfort as you.<br />
<br />
“Bring them up to me,” Bella said. You feel Cara swing you and Skylar to face Bella, “Face to face,” she added. Suddenly, you began to lift higher off of the ground. Cara’s legs were getting longer! You couldn’t see below you, but you were much closer to Bella’s face. Her head was twice the size of yours and Skylar’s. Her whole body was… like a Godess. Like an Amazonian! Her muscles only enhanced that appearance, as well as her admittedly beautiful clothing. You looked deep into her purple eyes… they were filled with power, even without the ring!<br />
<br />
“Skylar and… you, I forget your name,” Bella said, brushing her hair away, clearly not interested,<br />
“Close enough,” you said. Bella looked at you with distaste,<br />
“Why do you BOYS have to always stare at me,” she said dramatically, getting very into her persona, “I want to give you a taste of our medicine,”<br />
“He’s not like other boys!” Skylar cried,<br />
“ZIP IT, FATASS!” Bella roared, silencing everyone, “I wish the rest of your body matched your dumptruck!” She said, smirking.<br />
<br />
You turned your head, seeing Skylar look more uncomfortable. From between Cara’s fingers, you could see her body pushing against them. Her whole body was getting chubbier, thicker, fatter! Within a few seconds, the only thing that hadn’t changed was her butt. You’d seen Skylar fat before, but never against her own will. It filled you with genuine anger… but you kept it to yourself, you didn’t want to provoke Bella,<br />
“What’s it like BEING a fatass instead of having one?” Bella teased, laughing to herself, “drop her,” she commanded. As she said it, Cara immediately opened her hand, allowing Skylar to drop to the ground,<br />
“NO!” You yelled. You almost broke your neck with how quickly you watched her.<br />
<br />
Luckily, Tonya and David were below, still standing. Both of them managed to catch Skylar in time. You could barely hear Tonya comment, “you’re a lot heavier than before,” which made Skylar let out a faint chuckle,<br />
“Takes one to know one…” she said, softly. Clearly not focussing on what she was saying. She was looking back up at you with a very worried expression on her face.<br />
<br />
You faced Bella, who was clearly getting bored of watching this all unfold. She looked at you intensely, “you know, we always thought you were cute,” she announced. You looked very surprised… sure, you were fairly average, but no way was Bella also into you… wasn’t it just Skylar,<br />
“I… didn’t?” You replied, unsure of what else you could even say,<br />
“Let me make it extra clear for you,” Bella said. She leaned herself over, planting a kiss on your… face. With her increased size, her lips had obviously gotten too big to match yours, as well as they’d gotten thicker in general, so it really just felt like a wet cushion on your face.<br />
She took her lips off of your face, you looked a little grossed out. There was an amount of saliva on your face, which you weren’t able to wipe off with Cara’s grasp around you, however, there was some around your lips. It’s smell was… enticing. Without really thinking, you licked it up,<br />
“Wow, you liked that, huh?” She asked, noticing your choice.<br />
<br />
Her saliva was gross, but somewhat delicious. It didn’t taste like a flavour, more like a feeling. For Bella, it tasted like the intention to cause chaos. Something about it, there was power in it… you felt the power in your mouth, down your throat, until suddenly…<br />
<br />
PHOOM!<br />
<br />
A surge of purple energy pulsed out of you, causing a surge of power to escape, pushing apart Cara’s fingers, allowing you to fall to the ground. Even Bella seemed to have been knocked back by it. That was weird, another byproduct of a wish.<br />
<br />
You landed on the ground, being caught by Skylar, Tonya, and David. You all looked up at Bella, who was looking very confused,<br />
“Of course, you took my kiss and RAN!” Bella yelled, sounding almost upset. You had a feeling she was not happy when she didn’t get what she wanted,<br />
“He’s my boyfriend, BITCH!” Skylar yelled back impulsively,<br />
<br />
“Boyfriend, huh?” Bella said, smirking again, “let’s see about that!”<br />
“W-wait!” You said, having an idea of she might do,<br />
“I wish your boyfriend is a girl!” Bella called out.<br />
<br />
You could already feel the wish coming to. Without much warning, you started feeling your body shifting. It all started inside, your organs rearranging in an odd sensation, followed immediately by your penis beginning to change. You felt your hips begin to widen, as well as your butt putting on a little padding. You looked down, expecting to see breasts starting to form, and just as you expected. They formed slowly, but began protruding through your shirt, especially your nipples looking a little pointier. Your face shifted, your jawline changing. The final change was your penis completely transforming into a vagina… but that was it.<br />
No gigantic breasts, huge ass… at the very least you could’ve gotten longer hair. But no, it just looked like you as you were… just as a girl.<br />
“A little anticlimactic…” you whispered to Skylar,<br />
<br />
“Now your boyfriend is your girlfriend!” Bella shouted, laughing to herself. You and Skylar looked at each other, knowing this made little-to-no difference, “how’s it feel being a lesbian!” She shouted.<br />
<br />
Skylar looked at her, utterly astounded that this was Bella’s worst form of punishment,<br />
“You really think making me fat and Yu a girl is… what, the most awful thing in the world…” Skylar asked,<br />
“A-are… are you really not annoyed that he’s a girl now?” Bella asked, dumbfounded,<br />
“Not even a little bit,” Skylar said, turning back to you. She looked you in the eyes, and plants a kiss on your lips. You embrace it, enjoying her performance. She takes her lips off of yours, “nice try, muscle-head, but I’m happy with him, any form you make him!”</p>
