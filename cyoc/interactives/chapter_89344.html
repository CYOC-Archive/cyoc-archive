<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Patrick went to school the next day and felt like he was floating through it. He felt happy with who he was and right. Other boys attracted his attention all day and he could not help checking them out. He ran into Brian during break and had to suppress a laugh as he remembered what he was doing last night. His eyes were drawn down until Brain moved to where his side was facing him. Looking up Brian was looking at him with an odd expression before he went back to talking with his friends and tossing a soccer ball between them.  Patrick busied himself with his backpack till they left and then slowly started to walk by hoping for another look.<br />
&quot;Hey Patrick&quot; Brian turned and tossed the ball to him. Patrick fumbled trying to catch the unexpected pass. Suddenly Brian was nose to nose with him pushing the ball and him against the locker.<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve been staring at me a lot lately, like what you see? Huh?&quot; God he smelled good, Patrick tried to focus, wondering if he should be scared or not but Brian&#39;s proximity was more pleasurable than anything else. As he hit the lockers Patrick tried to look confused.<br />
&quot;Well you ain&#39;t getting any faggot so stop.&quot; Brian pushed hard against the ball and the air rushed from Patrick&#39;s lungs. At that moment Mary walked by and Brian straightened up and started to strut over to here to say hi. Patrick couldn&#39;t help it and laughed both of them turned and looked at him like he was a piece of dog shit they scraped of their shoe. Mary turned and swept her hair behind her ear and gave Brian a smile before they started to chat. A surge of jealousy ran through Patrick at this sight. He turned and avoided them both for the rest of the day determined to implement his plan after school.<br />
Patrick raced home to a empty house and tossed his stuff down and grabbed the box. The clown nose leapt into his hand and he stood in front of the mirror thinking of Brian and Mary. Her hair flowing down her back, the soft pink lips, the smile she flashed Brian. He pocketed the clown nose, he would show her. Leaving a quick note for his mom he ran out of the house down to Brian’s house.<br />
Walking around the garage he heard a thump, thump of a soccer ball hitting the fence. Entering the back yard he saw Brian practicing as always. He hadn’t noticed him yet a Patrick looked him over and sighed, he was in shorts showing off his muscular legs, sweating from the workout he had took his shirt off and Patrick could see his sculpted chest glistening with sweat.  Patrick pulls the clown nose out of his pocket as Brian turns around.<br />
“What are you doing here?” Brian asks looking at Patrick like a piece of shit on his shoe.<br />
“Just thought we could play some ball.”<br />
“Ha, like you could keep up with me, loser.”<br />
“I brought a ball to play with.” Patrick showed him the clown nose in his hand and before Brian could react he tossed it in his face. The clown nose unnaturally found its mark and slid onto Brian’s nose with a suction sound. Brian’s eyes cross momentarily before he lets out a laugh.<br />
“Cool” Brian blurts out with a laugh “I guess I can show you some moves.” Brian kicks the ball up and catches it with a finger and spins it. Dropping it he aims a kick for the goal and misses.<br />
“Oops, haha”<br />
Brian and Patrick continue to play soccer and kick balls in to the goal. As much as Brian is a champion in soccer he appears uncoordinated this afternoon with most of his kicks going wide of the goal but then he could hop on the ball and walk it around the yard and do other amazing stuff. Patrick watched with jealousy as Brian was currently juggling three soccer balls.<br />
Patrick wipes some sweat from his eyes and Brian notices. Looking at him around the red smudge at the bottom of his vision he feels as though he was just seeing him properly for the first time. His blonde hair, boyish looks and deep blue eyes, Brian’s eyes swept over his body, he looked nerdish but for some reason it turned him on. <br />
“If you hot just take off your shirt.” <br />
“I don’t want to get burned and I am not as fit as you.” Looking at Brian Patrick notices that he seems paler and less sculpted than earlier, he probably needed to take back the nose. He didn’t want him going all the way like Jac, just changing his mind a little.<br />
“It’s ok. I kinda like it.” Brian reaches under his shirt and rubs his stomach before pulling of Patrick’s shirt. Patrick feels an electric shock roll over his skin at Brian’s touch, his warm hands caressing his chest. He doesn’t stop him from pulling of his shirt and raises his arms to help. Brian stands in front of him staring at his naked chest as his hands roam over it. Patrick gasps as he feels the hands and his heart starts to race.<br />
Brian loved his pale skin and smile, he felt new feeling float through him as he ran his fingers over his chest. His tan hand contrasting with his skin, he spent too much time outdoors and wished his skin was lighter. Looking down at his hand was he imagining it or was he getting his wish? God, Patrick was cute. All of this was gay and just this morning he told him off for staring at him and now he could take his eyes off him. He should be mad at feeling this way but he was happy, he felt ……. Silly.<br />
“I’m sorry about saying those things earlier and calling you a fag. You are good looking.” He reaches down and takes Patrick’s hand interlacing his fingers with his and steps closer. Patrick runs his hand over Brian’s lightening pecs and his nipples.<br />
“You look pretty good yourself.” Patrick moves closer to Brian their bare chests almost touching. Brian leans in and Patrick twists his head and meets him. Closing his eyes he feels a soft pressure on his lips as tingles begin to race down his spine. For the second time in his life he is kissing a boy. Brian forces his lips apart and a hand squeezes his ass.  Patrick melts in his arms as they continue to kiss eventually having to break for air. Looking at Brian’s strong face Patrick notices his hair starting to change as well as his skin turning dangerously white. Panicking he reaches up and pulls off the clown nose. Brain appears stunned for a second before laughing. Patrick waits in terror to see if he changes back but Brain grabs his head for another kiss. A car driving down the alley jolts both of them.<br />
“I should go my mom will be home soon.” Patrick says with regret<br />
“I have a game on Saturday, want to come?”<br />
“Sure”<br />
That night Brian was lying on his bed trying to get to sleep but his new feelings for Patrick kept getting in the way. Why did he feel this way? Did he really care how? No. His mom had come home and kept asking him if he felt alright for some reason, he was distracted all night so he really didn’t pay attention. He groaned he needed some attention and he pulled up his normal picture of Mary but found himself uninterested and finds himself pulling up Patrick’s facebook page and a picture of Patrick. His mind goes back to the afternoon and his nerdy body in the backyard. Why did he call him a fag? He is so cute. Is it really a bad to like a boy? Yesterday he would have thought so but today he found himself falling for a nerdy blonde haired boy. Felling no guilt about kissing him he marvels at his change of mind. Turning back to the picture of Patrick relief comes quick and tossing aside a damp rag he climbs into bed his mind full of Patrick and to his surprise clowns.</p>
