<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tiffany Chappelle was hardly a stranger when it came to boyfriends. She had several back when she was human. And she had lost her virginity long before the Outbreak happened. Her mother was a bit more hands-off with Tiffany&#39;s interest with boys, she knew she had inherited her own rather substantial sexual appetite. Mr. Chappelle knew it was pointless to tell his daughter know with his wife there, but he wanted to make sure Tiffany at least used protection. And if there were any boys she was actually going to keep, he wanted to meet them.<br />
<br />
After Tiffany&#39;s transformation into a poodle Animalian, that altered the flow in boyfriends quite a lot. Interspecies sex wasn&#39;t forbidden, but the pool for potential husbands just became a lot smaller. So many jocks and popular boys were wanting to become cooler, manlier animals. That wasn&#39;t to say there weren&#39;t any wolves, but they had their eyes on other wolves or dogs. A French Poodle had a harder time competing with the other bitches.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that was why Tiffany was so desperate to get Simon after he converted into a wolf. She wasn&#39;t the only one competing over him, though. Simon eventually chose Malice, and Tiffany couldn&#39;t hold her a grudge for that. Eventually, luck and love did come her way when Jamie finished sorting out which of her two suitors she preferred. Tiffany caught Riley on the rebound rather easily. She had to admit that when she started looking for boyfriends among the uplifted canines, she wouldn&#39;t have thought she&#39;d end up with a Rottweiler. But Riley turned out to be very attentive and caring, strong characteristics of his breed. He wasn&#39;t particularly aggressive, even if he had a friendly rivalry still going on with Trevor. And he certainly knew how to satisfy a bitch in bed.<br />
<br />
Though Tiffany wasn&#39;t considering marriage until she was done with college, she felt that Riley had serious potential. But first, he needed to have a more formal meeting with her father. They may as well do this sooner than later.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if this is a good idea,&quot; said Riley nervously, tugging at his collar.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, aren&#39;t I under-dressed?&quot; asked Riley. He was wearing a button-up shirt and pants, but that was it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just talking with my dad,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;It&#39;s not like it&#39;s a formal gala or a job interview. You don&#39;t see me dressing up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that&#39;s because you&#39;re going to the Bare As You Dare competition,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
Tiffany hadn&#39;t been the type to shy away from this kind of competition as a human and being an Animalian made her all the more bolder. Even her current cut reflected this. Tiffany typically kept her fur in a classic poodle cut, but with this competition she got even more bolt. She had shaved down her fur so now it looked like she was wearing a bikini made of fur. It didn&#39;t really create the illusion of clothing from up close. But from a distance, it could pass as an actual bikini. Though she was wearing other clothes on top of it before she headed to the competition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just be glad it&#39;s me entering and not my mom,&quot; said Tiffany.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom...&quot; said Riley, trying to wrap his head around that idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think she was really serious about entering. I think she just wanted to get a rise from Dad,&quot; said Tiffany, &quot;Compared to the two of us, you&#39;ll seem like a breath of fresh air. Just be yourself and honest and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ok,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now hurry up and talk with Daddy. I want you to be at the contest when I&#39;m on stage. Then we&#39;ll make sweet puppy love afterwards,&quot; said Tiffany.<br />
<br />
Riley&#39;s stubby tail wagged a bit at that. &quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Mr. Chappelle&#39;s den was what one would expect of a wealthy man with taste. Firstly, there was a whole wall line with shelves and filled with books and a few ornaments. There were also a pair of recliners that were facing a large Smart TV. Quite clearly, the den was a place where Mr. Chappelle was expecting to relax and entertain himself.<br />
<br />
Even so, Riley felt that if he had human sweat glands, he&#39;d be sweating bullets. Tiffany&#39;s father was not dressed formally either, but he was still giving the Rottweiler a critical eye. &quot;So, Riley. Is there a last name to go with that?&quot; asked Mr. Chappelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I was kinda thinking I&#39;d be using Jamie&#39;s last name, though that was mostly when I was competing to be her mate. I suppose that if Tiffany and I... Er, what I mean is...&quot; said Riley, stumbling over his words.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you and Tiffany ever do marry, and I say <i>if</i>, how are you intending on supporting her? What job are you looking to find?&quot; asked Mr. Chappelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, I haven&#39;t really thought that far yet. But I understand Tiffany wants to get a business degree. I&#39;m not saying she should earn all the money, but I do want to support her somehow,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;And then there&#39;s the matter of your puppies,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle.<br />
<br />
Riley felt like his heart skipped a few beats. &quot;I swear, we were using protection every time. If there was an accident-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle, &quot;I didn&#39;t say she was pregnant. I&#39;m just talking about the possibility of you having puppies. What is it called when a Rottweiler mixes with a poodle? Rottle, is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;Personally, I don&#39;t care much for the poodle mixes that are becoming so common these days. Hypoallergenic or not, they just seem ridiculous. Though I suppose I don&#39;t have much of a choice if I want grandkids,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now just a moment,&quot; said Riley, getting a bit angry, &quot;I might not be rich, have a head for business, or a purebred, but you can&#39;t just complain about Tiffany&#39;s breed. She didn&#39;t get a choice about what kind of Animalian she became. But I&#39;m glad she is a dog, even if she isn&#39;t the kind of dog you like. And I really think I do love her and not just because she&#39;s rich. She might be snobby and sometimes inconsiderate, but she really is a good girl under all that. And I don&#39;t care that she&#39;s a poodle. I&#39;d probably still love her if she was a Chihuahua.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A Chihuahua?&quot; asked Mr. Chappelle, a little incredulously, &quot;Riley, I know Tiffany is a bit of a valley girl, but I never would have gotten her a Chihuahua. Poodles are very respectable breed; smart, agile, and handsome. There is nothing wrong about Tiffany being a poodle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why were you complaining about that?&quot; asked Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was complaining about her puppies getting that ridiculous curly look,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle, &quot;And also to gauge your reaction. If nothing else, you are loyal to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, thanks?&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;But loyalty can&#39;t cover everything,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle, &quot;Tiffany will need a husband she can rely on, someone who&#39;ll be able to take care of her and bring in money if for some reason she can&#39;t. What I&#39;m saying, Riley, is that I want my daughter&#39;s husband to be an equal partner, not a lapdog.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, that was a little uncalled for,&quot; said Riley.<br />
<br />
&quot;True. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t want you seeing my daughter, but I do like you to have your own job and not relying on her for money,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess that&#39;s fair,&quot; said Riley, &quot;Though I&#39;m not sure what kind of job I should have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps I can help with that,&quot; said Mr. Chappelle.</p>
