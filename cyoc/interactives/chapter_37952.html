<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Marcia and Rusty decided that it would be best to split up, hit the different wings of the building and cover more ground even faster. There were two people, a man and a woman, standing at the exit of the entry room they just came from. The man extended his hand, as did the woman, to take their personal belongings to their room for the duration of their stay. As the two separated there, going up their own grand staircase that ran along the east and west walls of the main room which was the size of a grand ballroom. As the two separated, they waived at each other and signaled that they would see each other in the morning. Then, as they did for the night from the office, they turned and went their own way.</Br>
<Br>Walking along the main hall, leading to the men's wing at the western side of the estate, Rusty took notice of his surroundings. The hallway was plain and one could tell that it never really had been renovated. Rusty thought to himself that if it had been renovated, they renovated with new things that still kept the old appearance, which was quite possible with the money Christine's family had. The hall walls were painted a light beige and was decorated in a scattered fashion with old pictures of the men in the house. It looked as though there were both people that worked there and the males who lived there that were all related to one another. Rusty also noticed that there were no pictures of women, but figured that it was the same way where Marcia was at the moment and that there were pictures of both sexes in the common living areas of the grand estate. Another thing Rusty noticed was that there were candelabras jutting from the wall, surrounded by tulip shaped frosted sconces, adding to the age and realism the estate acquired.</Br>
<Br>As Rusty and his escort arrived at the entrance to the west wing or the men's quarters, the escort pointed toward the overhang of the door frame. Rusty saw that he was pointing out that there was a sign there in case Rusty wandered around and wanted to find his way back to the room. Rusty acknowledged the new information and the escort proceeded further, taking a right around the corner, as there really wasn't any other way one could go. After walking what felt like a quarter-mile, they both arrived at the actual building that housed the men's wing. What Rusty saw amazed him, not thinking that this place was as big as it was, but realizing that when the profile said that the land the estate sat on was forty-square acres, meant that the size of the actual building was enormous. The wing was set perfectly square at a dimension Rusty couldn't place a number on. To be short, the wing itself was huge. There were three levels, the top two levels had a banister that went around the open rotunda, which had a pool in the center, with several pool type furnishings as well as plants to give some sort of decoration. Looking toward the ceiling, Rusty saw that the area right above the open rotunda was nothing but vaulted glass for natural lighting, which probably was intended for the staff to be able to tan when not working.</Br>
<Br>Wanting to turn in for the night, the escort tapped Rusty on his right shoulder, bringing him back to the planet Earth and on the matter before them. Apologizing, Rusty followed the escort for a few more feet until he stopped, and extended his arm openly toward the door. Rusty figured that this was his room for the stay, went ahead of the escort and opened the door while the escort dropped his entire arm to his side then continued on to his room, leaving Rusty to whatever business he needed to attend to. Immediately after stepping into the room, Rusty flipped on the light switch, illuminating the room.</Br>
<Br>What Rusty saw was typical of a decent hotel room. At the entrance to the room was the bathroom which was nicely done, even for when the house was originally built as nothing was added to or changed about the floor plan, having all the common necessities. Rusty was relieved, as he was not fond of public nudity or showering. There was a closet to his immediate left, which was an adequate size for what he needed, since he didn't bring all that much to wear with him. In the rest of the room was a large armoire with a double door that opened to reveal a thirty-two inch screen television complete with a DVD player resting atop the set; there was a large and plush, blood red chair for sitting and reading a book since it was next to the only large floor lamp; then there was a queen sized bed that was neatly made; on each side was a small nightstand that had the chorded phone for in estate calls, as well as two small table lamps which would provide illumination for reading in bed if one chose.</Br>
<Br>Since it was not late for Rusty, he figured he would look around, as stuff usually happened during the later hours of the night or early hours of the morning, however you looked at it. Having set his small carry-on sized bag near the door, Rusty walked toward it but veered off into the bathroom where he proceeded to wash his face. As Rusty was finishing up, the soap rinsed off his face and the water turned off, a foul smelling odor filled the room to the point were he felt as though he might vomit. Finishing patting his face dry, Rusty moved into the main portion of the room to investigate the cause, immediately being reminded of what Christine had mentioned earlier, Rusty's heart rate sped up while excited about possibly seeing the hell hound. As he peered into the room, Rusty did not see anything, but the smell was still there and more intense than what he smelled while in the bathroom, even though it was not more than a few feet from the main portion of the room. Stepping further into the room, Rusty felt the hairs in his nostrils burn and curl inward from the intense rotting and sulfuric smells. Suddenly, without warning, the room started increasing in brightness and then the hell hound stood in front of Rusty at the foot of the bed. Rusty felt two things at once, which he didn't think that the current combination was even possible, but he was excited and terrified at the same time. The hell hound was exactly the way Christine described it, but it was more intense, as he realized that the feeling one got could not even be put into words. To Rusty it felt as though all the warmth from the air had been drawn into the creature even though it was almost on fire. Fire flared from it's eyes, adding to it's overall creepiness as sulfuric smoke billowed from its flared nostrils while breathing heavily. Rusty, not sure of how he should proceed moved to the bed and sat on it, while the hell hound followed every step of the way with it's entire body turning at the speed Rusty walked, just stared at the creature since he was not prepared for such a quick visitation. As Rusty found himself to get slightly more comfortable in the bed, the hell hound proceeded closer to Rusty as the intensity of the smell rose.</Br>
<Br>Quickly, Rusty found the room to spin slightly, while he slipped in and out of consciousness. He fought with himself to remain awake, but it was becoming increasingly difficult. It was as if the hell hound wanted Rusty asleep on the bed, as if it were planning something evil. Rusty didn't want to succumb, he wanted to remain conscious to study the hell hound and explore the rest of the wing, but found that it was not going to happen as he blacked out from the lack of oxygen.</Br>
<Br>In a moment of pure adrenaline to wake him, Rusty shot up from the position he collapsed in on the bed, trying to recall what happened. After a few seconds, Rusty could smell the faint odor of sulfur but the hell hound was no where in sight or apparently not in range. Scratching himself, as was his tendency to do when he first awoke, Rusty moved to document his experience before he lost it and realized that something was different now about the room, but Rusty couldn't place a finger on what it could have been.</Br></p>
