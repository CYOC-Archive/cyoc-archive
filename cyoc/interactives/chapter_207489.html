<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
Jeff inputted the proper stats, made sure everything was in order. Double and triple-checking was the name of the game when it came to reality shifts. He’d make sure Chuck was very happy with the results. The poor guy got picked on constantly. That wouldn’t be an issue when the changes were finished.<br />
<br />
As for Greg…well, he’d play ball (literally) one way or another.<br />
<br />
“I don’t know why you’re so eager to change yourself.” Greg was saying to Chuck.<br />
<br />
Chuck ignored Greg and handed Jeff a piece of paper. Jeff looked at the picture on it and grinned. So Chuck was a furry like his dad, huh?<br />
<br />
“It’s my OC. Can you do it?” Chuck said.<br />
<br />
“Fuck yeah, bro!” Jeff grinned and scanned it into the Chronivac to use as a template. “That’s one hot dog!”<br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Chuck said shyly.<br />
<br />
“Nothing is going to happen.” Greg said finally, crossing his arms. “Jeff is leading you on.”<br />
<br />
Jeff understood Greg’s position, of course. It was the smart approach….If he was the owner of the Chronivac. If only he’d played along with them, gave them something to work with, things wouldn’t end so…well, poorly from Greg’s perspective. Fuckin’ hot from Jeff’s.<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed [Execute], making sure to check mental shift on and reality shift on. He’d be the only person in the room to remember things as they were. Risky, of course. If something ever went wrong, mental shift would be the end of him. He’d let Finn know what he’d changed afterwards.<br />
<br />
-=-=-==-==--=-==-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
A minute of silence stretched between Jeff hitting the execute button and anything happening.<br />
<br />
Greg looked at Finn, who was watching Chuck expectantly. Jeff seemed less interested in Chuck and more interested in him. The muscular white tiger seemed overly familiar with Chuck and Greg. He was the quarterback on their football team, so he never hung out with the geek crowd.<br />
<br />
And now here he was, with a Chronivac, transforming Chuck into a fellow football star. A thought occurred to him, then. What if Jeff used to be a human geek too? That would explain how he knew where Greg lived. He’d just showed up at his doorstep. Greg knew he had the Chronivac and was turning people into muscular animals. It wasn’t that big of a leap to guess.<br />
<br />
“What are we waiting for?” Greg asked, checking his watch. “It’s almost been a minute already.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, it’s fucking slow during reality shifts.” Jeff rolled his eyes, clearly annoyed. “Plus I had to change the parents first. The reality shift rolls down from there.”<br />
<br />
“But I want to remember!” Chuck spoke up. “How can I really be happy with the change if I think it’s normal?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, don’t worry about that. Same geeky interests, bullied back in middle school, came into your prime in high school when you started working out more.” Jeff said. “Getting things right takes some finessing.”<br />
<br />
“So when’s this thing going to hit me?” Chuck asked, scratching his chest. <br />
<br />
Milky fur was growing out of his black skin. <br />
<br />
Greg watched in dawning horror as Chuck began to change. His big, wobbly gut and man-tits were slowly pulling back into his body. His wide ass was keeping its bubble shape but shrinking, firming up as it did, becoming muscular and toned.<br />
<br />
His formerly fat friend was quickly becoming fit, flab melting away, revealing bulging pecs and a row of abs. Greg watched in awe as A short tail shot out from above Chuck’s ass and began to wag. His heels lifted off the floor as his feet shifted into wide, sturdy paws. <br />
<br />
The entire time, Chuck was looking bored, completely unaware of the transformation. His muscles twitched and flexed, growing larger and larger. Light gray fur wrapped around his back and sides, transitioning to a light cream color on his chest and belly. His ears grew pointed and rose to the top of his head. With a series of pops and crunches, Chuck’s face pushed out into a distinctly canine muzzle.<br />
<br />
As the changes slowed, finishing up, Chuck’s eyes shifted from dark brown to bright yellow. Then his package bulged, cock and balls thickening up. Chuck scratched his head, then noticed Greg staring at him with his mouth open.<br />
<br />
“It happened?” Chuck asked.<br />
<br />
Greg just swallowed and nodded. <br />
<br />
“Am I hot?” Chuck adjusted his package with a meaty paw and winked at Greg.<br />
<br />
“Yes.” Greg said, cock inexplicably hard despite not being into furries.<br />
<br />
Greg was about to say more when a strange energy jolt him. <br />
<br />
He scratched an itch that started on his chest but quickly spread like wildfire across his body. He looked down, seeing milky white strands of fur push through his skin and considered shaving it. He liked showing off the definition of his big muscles.<br />
<br />
Greg blinked and shook his head. Big muscles?<br />
<br />
He actually grew shorter as his heels rose up, coming to eye level with Chuck. He stared at the pitbull, and memories began to flood into his mind. Growing up with him, their first day of school, being picked on in middle school and then working out in high school and joining the football team. Greg’s muscled swelled, cock growing hard as he remembered getting swole with his brother.<br />
<br />
Wait, brother?<br />
<br />
“You feeling okay, Buck?” Jeff asked slyly.<br />
<br />
“Who…what?” Grug said, voice shifting an octave lower, becoming identical to Chuck’s voice.<br />
<br />
“You alright, bro?” Chuck asked, looking at Grug with concern.<br />
<br />
Grucg’s ear’s twitched as they rose higher on his head. Something was wrong. He wasn’t supposed to be Chuck’s brother! But his memories were telling him otherwise. Mom and dad were both pit bulls, they grew up in the same house. A tail extended from his spine and began to wag as he remembered sharing everything with his brother. Hobbies, football (they were wide receivers)…men,<br />
<br />
His cock hardened and plumped up just like his muscles. Brucg and his twin did everything together, how could he ever forget that? The pitbull’s tongue grew out as he panted, eyes closed, remembering all the good fucks they’d shared together.<br />
<br />
He realized that he was being changed, that he was becoming Chuck’s twin. But it wasn’t so bad. He felt good, and strong, and powerful. Bruck allowed the memories in and relaxed, running his paws over his thick muscles, tongue lolling happily.<br />
<br />
Buck’s face crackled and popped as it grew out into a muzzle. He opened his eyes and leveled his bright yellow gaze at Jeff and smirked. Jeff smirked back and glanced at his computer. Buck’s body continued to grow until it was a perfect match to Chuck’s. Then the computer pinged merrily.<br />
<br />
“So are you going to change something about us?” Buck asked Jeff.<br />
<br />
The white tiger and the ram exchanged knowing looks.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, sure.” Jeff grinned. “I can make you a bit bigger.”<br />
<br />
“Make sure you get both of us.” Chuck walked over and threw an arm around his twin. “We’re a matched pair!”<br />
<br />
“You sure are.” Jeff turned to the computer and began inputting something. An angry beep came from the device. “That’s weird. ‘Reality alteration still in progress’, huh. Wonder what’s changing?”<br />
<br />
Jeff was so preoccupied with the computer that he didn’t notice his clothes disappear. Finn scratched his bare chest and wandered over next to the naked tiger, his own cock flopping with each heavy step that he took. <br />
<br />
Chuck and Buck moaned as their bodies swelled a little larger. Their clothing shifted into leather harness, paws stuck in leather boots. Their generous packages were cradled in leather pouches. They winced as gold piercings and tattoos covered their bodies.<br />
<br />
“Weird.” Jeff muttered to himself, looking at the alterations. “Nothing else should be changing.”<br />
<br />
A paw gripped Jeff’s shoulder and swiveled his chair around.<br />
<br />
Jeff found himself staring up at a rather handsome and naughty-looking pitbull in full leather gear. The tiger gulped, noticing the musky dog smell emanating from the tightly-packed leather pouch right in front of his nose. His nostrils flared and his cock stiffened. He expected to feel a tightness in his pants, but when he looked down, he realized he was completely nude.<br />
<br />
“Come on kitty-cat.” The pitbull smirked cockily and pulled Jeff to his feet. “Let’s get this party started.”<br />
<br />
Finn and the other pitbull were making out in the corner. Jeff realized what had changed. They weren’t just gay. Chuck’s OC was a dominant top! Which meant he and Finn were going to become…<br />
<br />
“B-Buck, wait!” Jeff protested as the pitbull reached out and grasped the white tiger’s shaft. A strange sensation rushed through Jeff. It was like the pitbull’s paw was growing bigger, encapsulating Jeff’s foot-long feline shaft. <br />
<br />
Jeff looked down and gasped.<br />
<br />
The pitbull’s paws weren’t growing, his cock was shrinking! Jeff felt his manhood shrink down to five inches, more than half the size it used to be. Buck smirked and fingered the nub. Jeff yowled, precum dribbling into the dog’s fist.<br />
<br />
“Come on, kitty. Time for bed.” Buck grasped Jeff’s cock and guided the confused tiger over to the bed.<br />
<br />
Jeff found himself pushed down on all fours, ass high in the air.He needed to stop this before it went further, ride out the reality shift, and then cancel the last reality alteration. He could make a few adjustments.<br />
<br />
“This is all wrong!” Jeff protested as Buck lubed up his doggy shaft. “Finn! Tell them! We’re not bottoms.”<br />
<br />
Jeff turned to Finn. The ram had his face in the bedsheets and his ass in the air. Finn was moaning as Chuck gently lubed the ram’s pucker. It looked…looser, more…used than before.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be silly, Jeff.” Finn groaned as the pitbull stuck a finger in his ass and rotated it. “We’re fuck-hungry sluts. Just like our dads.”<br />
<br />
“Finn, you have to-mmmphh!”<br />
<br />
Finn interrupted the tiger by pulling him into a long, loving kiss. He broke it after a minute, a string of drool connecting their lips together. The ram was looking at him with hazy, lust-filled eyes. Jeff felt his heart pound and went in for another kiss. Finn and Jeff made out, tongues wrestling as the two pit bulls made out as well, both twins jerking each other to full hardness. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry, Jeff. I’ll stretch out your hole.” The pitbull above him chuckled and slapped Jeff’s ass, making the bottom flinch.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to protest some more, but then Buck had lifted the white tiger’s ass up and spread cool lube across his furry hole. He moaned into the ram’s mouth as they made out. The ram extended a hand under Jeff and found its way around his small shaft. The clever hooflets began to jerk him slowly.<br />
<br />
The tiger bucked lightly in the ram’s firm grip and found himself reciprocating, paw easily engulfing Finn’s short cock. The two bottoms, whose asses were growing larger and more rounded, muscles becoming less dense, more lean, pleasured each other. Chuck and buck positioned themselves, big doggy dicks tight against their teammate’s holes.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt the pitbull’s red rocket begin to pierce his hole and flinched again, sphincter tightening. He wasn’t a bottom, despite what reality was telling him. He flinched again when a well-lubed finger thrust inside of him and began milking his prostate. Jeff was more surprised at how easily the finger had penetrated than the actual milking, which had his cook drooling onto his bedsheets.<br />
<br />
“Relax, Jeff.” Buck chided, inserting another digit smoothly, Jeff’s ass accepting it just as easily as the first.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned, feeling a strange sense of emptiness in his hole. It was like an itch that needed to be scratched. Another digit penetrated his ring and he moaned again. The fingers suddenly withdrew, leaving him feeling empty.<br />
<br />
They were quickly replaced by Buck’s thick rod. It slid easily inside of him, now that he was relaxed. The tiger yowled, claws flexing as the cock rubbed his prostate. Buck bottomed out, heavy balls lightly slapping the tiger’s.<br />
<br />
“Now tighten up.” Buck said.<br />
<br />
Jeff clamped his ring around the daring intruder. His cock juttered, burping up more precum. The smell of musk in the air rose. He-he wasn’t a bottom. Jeff just really enjoyed the sensation of the thickly throbbing cock inside of him. <br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Buck panted, tongue lolling. “Just like that.”<br />
<br />
The hoof on his cock began to stroke him again, as though Finn were rewarding him, and Jeff found himself reciprocating. The handsome pitbull above him bucked his hips and began fucking Jeff in earnest.  Jeff yowled but found himself in another long, deep kiss with his other lover, Finn. They sloppily made out while their doms plowed their holes.<br />
<br />
Another slap on his ass and Jeff moaned. Finn’s hoof was a blur on his shaft, but strangely, though it was pleasurable, Jeff just couldn’t reach his peak. Above him, the dog panted, pistoning his turgid scarlet shaft in and out of his hole.<br />
<br />
Jeff’s eyes rolled back in his head. This was too much. He couldn&#39;t hold out against the pleasurable feelings. The tiger writhed beneath his pitbull lover, feeling the cock stretch out his well-used hole. Jeff knew if he gave in, he wouldn’t want to change things back.<br />
<br />
“I…I want…” Jeff groaned.<br />
<br />
“Yeah? What do you want kitty?” The Pitbull above him growled in his ear as he fucked Jeff’s hole roughly.<br />
<br />
There was only one thing Jeff wanted, of course. He wanted…wanted…<br />
<br />
“I want you to cum inside my hole!” Jeff mewled, voice higher than before.<br />
<br />
The dog pounded his hole harder and harder. Jeff wanted to cry, claws extending and retracting. His balls were slapping against Buck’s and it was painful and pleasurable all at once. He could feel something big and bulbous bumping into his hole, now.<br />
<br />
“Gonna…breed you…like a bitch…!” Buck snarled.<br />
<br />
The big bulbous knot of the dog’s cock blew Jeff’s ring wide open. <br />
<br />
The twunk yowled in ecstasy, hole fully stretched, finally feeling full, and clamped down on the knot. Buck howled and came hard inside of Jeff. Ribbons of luscious pitbull seed painted the insides of the tiger white. The sudden flood of hot semen flooding his depths was enough for Jeff to go over the edge. He came weakly, the knot pressing too tightly to his prostate for a true cum-shot.<br />
<br />
Next to him, he heard the ram bleat and the other dog howl, and knew that they had just finished. The quad lay on the bed, letting the afterglow roll over them. They shared more kisses and then cuddled up together. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Mike and Todd and Dave came up after the football game and found them sleeping, limbs tangled together.<br />
<br />
“Aw, young love.” Todd said, the panda rubbing Dave’s wide shoulders. “You remember when we were their age?”<br />
<br />
Dave chuckled and embraced the panda, pulling him into a kiss.<br />
<br />
Mike sighed. The only guy without a proper partner. Even his son had…what, three other guys to date? The Chronivac was still open, the [Process Complete. Input New Changes] alert flashing on the screen. He wondered who and what he’d want his perfect partner to be?</p>
