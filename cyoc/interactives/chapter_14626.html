<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andrew said &quot;well let's get out of here and go see some of your friends.&quot; So the two of them left the bar walking as tall as ever sporting the most beautiful full mustaches either had ever hoped to have. They both got in Andrew's truck, and stared at each other. &quot;Damn you look hot&quot; Andrew said to Todd &quot;You too my mustached friend.&quot; Todd reached up and grabbed Andrew's chin and pulled his face towards him and kissed him again. They slowly rubbed their mustaches on the others' face, feeling the soft yet stiff hairs caressing skin. Both of their dicks were rising in their jeans. Andrew pulled away &quot;Man i could do that all night. But we have mustaches to show off.&quot; And with that he pulled out of the parking lot, and drove to Todd's frat house.<br />
<br />
Once there, Todd said &quot;I have three buddies that i think are hot. They always tease me about not being able to shave much. So I want to show them my new stache.&quot; He giggled to himself &quot;my mustache! that sounds great!&quot; Andrew and Todd went inside the frat house and sitting in the TV room were Todd's buddies; Ben, Matt, and Luke. Ben was Todd's age, 18 a freshman, 5'7 155lbs, athletic looking, dark blond hair, and pretty much hairless on his chest. Matt was 19, a sophomore, was much darker skinned that Ben, very black hair, and blue eyes. He was stockier than Ben at 5'9 and much hairier. Matt had a nice coating of straight black hair on his chest, and he sported a 5 o'clock shadow most of the time, though he never let it grow out. Finally, Luke, the most handsome of the three. Luke was model handsome; very strong jawline, dark brown hair, light dusting of hair on his chest, and the most beautiful green eyes any guy should have.<br />
<br />
The three guys turned their heads abruptly when Andrew and Todd walked in. At first the three guys seemed very startled, until they recognized Todd under his big mustache. Ben laughed and said &quot;Todd where'd you get that thing?&quot; pointing to his mustache. &quot;I would like to buy one of those for Halloween.&quot; Todd said &quot;man its mine, its growing out of my lip!&quot; Matt spoke up and said &quot; NO way man, you left here 3 hours ago cleanshaven, and you never could grow more than fuzz.I have the thickest beard here and even I can't grow anything like that.&quot; Todd said &quot;then come here and feel it!&quot; Matt walked over and  took his fingers and grabbed the long brown hair sprouting from Todd's face and pulled. &quot;OUCH!&quot; Todd said, &quot;I told you its growing out of me.&quot; Matt looked closer and sure enough, no glue, but the whiskers were actually sprouting from Todd's face. Andrew stood to the side and smiled as he watched all this take place. Ben turned to Andrew who he hadn't formally met yet, and said &quot;Then I guess yours is real too?&quot; Andrew smiled and said &quot;Yes, its awesome&quot;<br />
<br />
Luke had also been standing to the side staring in awe at the two mustaches on Andrew and Todd's faces. Luke had always wanted to grow a thick beard and mustache. And now his once smooth friend had the thickest mustache he had ever seen flowing from his face. Luke, Ben and Todd had always been jealous of Matt, who could grow a 5 o'clock shadow just by grunting. But he never wanted to let it grow out. Now as he stood looking at these two magnificent mustaches, he is thinking differently.<br />
<br />
Ben looked at Todd, &quot;OK, how did this happen? You left here smooth faced and now you are hairy as ever. I want to know!&quot; Todd looked at Andrew to see if he should tell them or not. &quot;Well, I kissed Andrew and then i grew a mustache.&quot; All three of the guys laughed, &quot;yeah, right&quot; said Matt. &quot;We knew you were gay, but not a liar.&quot; &quot;I am serious&quot; said Todd. &quot;Andrew has an ointment, that when it's applied to skin, it grows hair. I saw him in a bar and wanted to kiss his mustache, and after I did, apparently some of the ointment got on me, and my mustache began to grow.&quot; &quot;I want one!&quot; said Ben He looked at Todd and asked &quot;what do i have to do?&quot; Todd looked at Andrew then back at Ben and said &quot;kiss me.&quot; &quot;I'm not gay&quot; Ben said, then walked over and kissed Todd hard on the lips. He lingered  there allowing Todd's silky whiskers to stroke his face. In that split second, he never thought a mans mustache could feel so good. He even thought about sucking on the hairs as he kissed him. &quot;There&quot; said Ben as he stepped backward away from Todd. &quot;Now what?&quot;  &quot;Just wait a minute&quot; said Andrew. <br />
<br />
Then Matt said &quot;I wouldn't mind having one&quot;, though in his mind he was thinking how great it would be to be able to grow thick beard hair. &quot;But I don't know about kissing another dude, even for a mustache.&quot; As he finished, he looked over at Ben, and said &quot;Fuck, man! look at your lip!&quot; Already Ben had about 1/4 inch of extremely dense dark blond hairs growing from his once smooth lip. &quot;Awe man look at this!&quot; he said as he rushed to a mirror and stroked his very stiff new whiskers. &quot;OK! OK!&quot; said Matt as he walked over to Andrew this time, &quot;lets get this over with.&quot; and with that he leaned over and kissed Andrew. And just like Ben, he couldn't believe how wonderful it felt to kiss a thick bushy mustache. It was like slow motion in his mind as all he wanted to do was linger in the upper lip hairs of Andrew. &quot;Oh man!! that was awesome&quot; he said as he let go of Andrews mustache. &quot;Man I want a stache like that!!&quot; And he reached up and felt his upper lip, but nothing yet was there. He turned and once again looked at Ben, and was in awe as he saw Ben's mustache now over an inch long, looking like a whisk-broom of hair flowing from his face. It wasn't a fu manchu yet like Todd and Andrews, but more like a cop's groomed but very bushy butch stache. Ben couldn't stop stroking the new stiff hairs. Todd looked at Matt and said &quot;hey man, you better take a look at yourself&quot;, &quot;What?&quot; Matt said as he too rushed to the mirror. But what Matt saw was different. Not only did he have a mustache but he also had a very, very thick goatee growing completely around his lips. It was so dense with hair it almost looked as if it had been painted on. &quot;Wow! howd that happen?&quot;</p>
