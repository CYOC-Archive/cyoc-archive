<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke decided to go with something pretty risky - after all, he was not exactly known as the careful and conservative one around town. He enjoyed the lifestyle of a playboy, fucking and working out to maintain his edge, but he was curious now about what this little device that could apparently change him could do. He could do so much. He could restore himself to the age of 25, when he was as far as he was concerned at his hottest. He estimated that age was when he got the most sex even in comparison to now, when he thought he was in the best form he&#39;d been in for a while.<br />
<br />
Or he could switch over and see how the other side enjoyed things.<br />
<br />
Turning into a woman was an idea that appealed to him on some level if only to see what it was like. He wanted to explore sex and sexuality, and thus it&#39;d make sense for him to aim in the direction of experiences he&#39;d never had prior. And after all, what was this if not an invitation to indulge in things he&#39;d never before had the opportunity to try out?<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, it appeared to him even so much as his very species was capable of being changed. This was truly something else. A machine, capable of altering a human into an animal? And with what limits? Would those changed so remember who and what they were prior, or would they fade into the aether and leave an unthinking creature in their place? Luke cupped his chin and contemplated more about that...<br />
<br />
...and so before long he was browsing how exactly the animal transformations / species transformations would work. It appeared all his questions were ones the machine was readily primed to answer. Awareness, reality shifting, duration and length of the transformation were all things the machine was fully ready and made to answer. Luke licked his lips, excitement rendering him flush and ready to go. Even so much as his manhood was now erect, a sign of just how much he was enjoying this idea. He lightly tugged at it, smirking at the light stain showing in his pants.<br />
<br />
He found himself looking through the species options, and even doing so he saw some other options related to this; namely, the strength of the &quot;animal instincts&quot; of what he might turn into. His eyes went over the common options he guessed, and then through the less common ones as he browsed. Luke was well and truly fixated by this point, and his shirt was slung off, showing his muscled build covered in goosebumps and signs of excitement. He shivered and wiped sweat off of his forehead.<br />
<br />
Luke knew he needed to make a choice.<br />
<br />
He almost selected a few different options, but it was actually a text message on his cell phone that gave him the impetus to choose. Leticia, one of his recent flames, said he was &quot;a true latin stallion&quot;. His eyes widened and he clicked on to the image of a horse in the machine. He grinned, seeing all the different options. He contemplated for a moment...and then selected Clydesdale. He figured it would be a good place to start.<br />
<br />
Luke saw that there was an option to revert even if the transformation was ongoing, and figured that was for if the transformation might be interrupted by life&#39;s events. A useful tool to be certain.<br />
<br />
Deciding upon how long the transformation would happen, Luke decided ten days would give him a decent idea of how these transformations would feel. A very nice slow burn to get him into the experience of experimenting with the Chronivac. He turned off reality shift, and set animal instincts at 70% strength. That he figured would give him an idea of how it might feel with more animalistic instincts over time and still let him have sufficient dominion over himself.<br />
<br />
Duration...well, if he decided to go through with the transformation to its fullest, he&#39;d set it to last a month. He figured he could afford that kind of time investment. He just hoped if he did go through with it that he wouldn&#39;t come back to human form at a loss for musculature due to lack of time in the gym.<br />
<br />
And so he overviewed the terms and the exact info for the transformation he would be inciting upon himself. Ten Days until he was completely turned into a Clydesdale Stallion, and then if he completed the change it would last a month. Nodding, Luke hit &quot;begin transformation&quot;. There was a ding, and Luke sat there for a moment, as if expecting something to happen. He saw a Percentage Meter in the top corner of the Chronivac Menu, and he figured that was supposed to represent the percentile of how far along the change was.<br />
<br />
Shrugging, he decided to go and do some working out at the gym, maybe he&#39;d come back and be in time to see something happen to himself. Luke wondered why he was so excited for this, and figured maybe he should cancel some of his recent dates...nah, he still felt he could afford to go out with some women while he looked human...</p>
