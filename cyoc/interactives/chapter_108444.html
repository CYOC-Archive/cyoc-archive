<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Umm.&quot;  Derrick let the loincloth fall back to the straw.  &quot;Look, this is all a little too much.  Sorry.  Can I switch rooms?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course!&quot;  A familiar female voice came from the door.  Derrick gasped and spun to see the receptionist smiling at him.  &quot;I am sorry this did not meet your expectations.  I take it you are not as interested in monsters as you seemed to be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick turned red.  &quot;Well, uh, it&#39;s way more primitive than I thought it would be.  I mean, all this is amazing!  And a real minotaur!  But I guess I&#39;m not ready to sleep on straw and pee in a hole.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded.  &quot;I am sure Bull is very disappointed, but I understand completely.  I can give you one room change free of charge.  You understand that this is a very expensive and exclusive resort, so any further changes will be... very costly to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick nodded.  His dad would hit the roof if they got hit with a big fee.  &quot;Uh, yes, m&#39;am.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well.&quot;  She nodded to Bull.  &quot;I will take him from here.  Return to the lobby.  We have some athletes checking in that might be interested in taking this room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick really doubted anyone would be too thrilled by the overall package, but also wondered if he was making a mistake.  He sighed.  Too late now. <br />
<br />
The receptionist headed back down the rough passage, and Derrick scrambled to follow.  His bag!  Well, the hotel would move it, he figured.  He was confused when the woman made a turn into a passage he had not seen before, and almost immediately they were in a brightly-lit, ornate hallway trimmed with gold and intricate carvings.  Startled, he looked back and only saw the same fancy surroundings.  Where had the rock caverns gone?<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you will find this much more to your liking.  Definitely not sharing a room with monsters.  No ragged loincloths.  Very fancy and elegant, with absolutely amazing room service.&quot;  The receptionist stopped at a door with more gold trim and a relief carving of a heart shape with an arrow through it.  Was this the Honeymoon suite?  She opened the door and let Derrick walk in.  It was a large room with thick white carpet and pale blue walls hung with huge mirrors.  There was odd-looking furniture and lots of toys and stuffed animals scattered around.  A pretty young woman was facing away from him, and she turned with a smile.  He was shocked to see she was breast-feeding an infant.  <br />
<br />
&quot;This is a nursery!&quot;  He looked closer and saw that odd furniture was cribs, changing tables, and weirdly, racks with tiny white bows and quivers.  &quot;What the...?&quot;  As he turned back to leave, the door shut with a click, and when he tried to open it he found it was locked.  It was suddenly cooler, and he yelped when he discovered he was now naked!  Panicked, he spun around to find another way out, then clasped his hands over his privates, flushing as the woman simply grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing I haven&#39;t seen before, and I will be seeing a lot more of it in the future.&quot;  The toddler finished nursing, but instead of beings et down in its crib, the infant suddenly rose up from the woman&#39;s arms.  It had wings!  White, feathered wings!  <br />
<br />
Derrick was so surprised he forgot to cover himself and took a step closer to stare.  &quot;He can fly!&quot;  It was obvious the child was a boy, a little older than he had thought.  Maybe 3 years old, or 4.  Sorta old to be nursing.  This all connected somehow.  Flying babies, little bow and arrows, a heart with an arrow through it... The idea should have been silly, but he&#39;d just met a real minotaur.  &quot;Cupid?  He&#39;s Cupid?&quot;  Derrick&#39;s voice cracked, something that hadn&#39;t happened in a year or more.<br />
<br />
The toddler boy giggled and zoomed up to the ceiling, then dove down into a pile of stuffed animals.  &quot;He&#39;s -a- Cupid.  We have more than one, of course.&quot;  The woman walked towards him, her left breast still exposed.  He flushed and averted his eyes.  Man, she was big!  At least a head taller than him, maybe more.  Then he remembered he was naked and clasped his crotch.  His eyes went wide and he looked down.  While he was no porn star, Derrick was at least average with most of the few guys his age he had seen naked.  Or had been.  The nub he was looking down at belonged to a grade-school kid.  With a sinking feeling in his gut, Derrick ran over to look in one of the huge wall mirrors.<br />
<br />
The boy reflected back wasn&#39;t him.  Bad enough the kid was maybe 11 years old and still getting younger.  A tangled blonde mop of hair hung over the face of a blue-eyed, cute child who could have been a model or actor.  It was a nearly perfect face, and as he stared in shocked amazement, it did become perfect.  Angelic, sweet, cute, handsome, beautiful... and still getting younger.  &quot;No!&quot;  Derrick&#39;s cry came out as the high reedy whine of a child, which matched his 6 year-old&#39;s body.  As he stumbled back from the mirror,  muscles pulled in his back and shoulders and he both felt and saw wings push out behind him.<br />
<br />
He turned to run, only to be scooped up by the woman who carried him back to the mirror.  &quot;Oh, you do not want to miss this.&quot;  She smiled and tapped his nose with a fingertip.  &quot;How many people get to watch themselves become innocent again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot;  This time, Derrick&#39;s cry was like a little kid&#39;s, and he saw that he was no more than 4.  He squirmed, trying to get away, but the woman held him firmly, but gently.  The child in her arms shrank a little more, though the wings appeared to get larger.  Derrick found himself hypnotized by the reflection, staring as the little boy become a toddler, an exact duplicate of the flying boy who was giggling and playing with stuffed animals.  The angelic face relaxed into a happy smile, and Derrick felt himself relax, suddenly cheerful.  This was wonderful!  He waved a chubby hand and the blonde cherub mimicked his action.  <br />
<br />
The woman hefted him easily and kissed the top of his head.  Derrick watched the mirror, but he did not seem to change any more.  Yet he felt like something was different, that whatever magic was affecting him was still working.  He giggled, thinking about his friends at school and what they would think of this naked, winged little boy.  Friends at school?  He was puzzled, then realized there were snippets of memory floating in his head.  Playing football, riding a bike, going to movies, wrestling with friends.  Not enough memories.  He remembered being Derrick, but it was getting harder to come up with any of his past.  His small mouth opened in a small &#39;O&#39; and the woman gave him a gentle hug when she saw it.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s happening.  You are becoming innocent.  A happy being of love and laughter, never to feel doubt or worry, no responsibilities, no cares.&quot;  She hefted him again, this time lowering him and turning slightly so her erect nipple was in easy reach of his mouth.  &quot;You will be one of our Cupids forever, your body and mind forever pure and clean and happy!&quot;<br />
<br />
Derrick felt contentment drifting over his thoughts, but some small remnant of his teen self fought back.  A baby forever?  Nursing and playing with stuffed animals, never able to grow up, drive a car, do anything on his own?  Worse, never even comprehending any of that stuff!  Now he understood the &#39;amazing room service&#39;.  Someone to change his diapers, keep him clean, and feed him.  Pissing in a hole in the floor didn&#39;t seem nearly so bad now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on now.  Finish things up.&quot;  The woman murmured and used a hand to guide the back of his head, so that the teat brushed against his lips.  She wanted him to nurse.  Derrick resisted as best he could.  Nursing would seal the change, as the loincloth would have sealed whatever might have happened with the minotaur.  The woman made a disapproving sound.  &quot;Come now, Derrick.  This is your one free room change.  If you don&#39;t accept it, you&#39;ll have to pay the price.&quot;</p>
