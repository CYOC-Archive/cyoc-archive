<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oakmoss stood there, thinking of a possible answer, she had to admit that being a hen felt more relaxing than being a drake, and being dominated by a dragon like Karyu felt even better, but she didn&#39;t know about Hadad, she doesn&#39;t know alot about Elisa&#39;s leviathan, a part of her wanted to be part of the harem, satisfying both Karyu and Hadad, the other part didn&#39;t want to join the harem, because of the idea to be mated by two drakes almost at the same time did sound disgusting, and she didn&#39;t want to lay so many clutches, Oakmoss knew that Celestia would allow her to join the harem, but she was still in thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Said Oakmoss, with a sad voice while looking at the two hens.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw come on Oaky!&quot; Started Hilda, trying to cheer up the teal-green hen near her, &quot;Hadad gave you the look of a love-struck warrior! You can&#39;t deny that opportunity!&quot; mentioned Hilda, she was right, Hadad did give her a stunned look when they first saw eachother, maybe she should consider joining them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough Hilda.&quot; Interrupted Astrid, &quot;Stop pressuring the poor hen, she barely turned into one.&quot; continued Astrid, this made Oakmoss smile a little, ever since she turned into a hen, she became much closer with Astrid and Hilda, the tarnished bronze dragoness would always defend her from any argument or discussion, meanwhile the wheat colored dragoness always tried to cheer her up, succeeding most of the time, &quot;I don&#39;t even think Oakmoss has a body to bear so many clutches.&quot; mentioned Astrid as she looked at Oakmoss&#39; innocent form, the teal green dragoness wasn&#39;t as tall as the two hens near her, but she was still strong enough and capable of incapacitating both of them in a short amount of time.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t say i refuse, i said i don&#39;t know whether i&#39;ll be joining or not.&quot; Replied Oakmoss, breaking the discussion between the two hens, one of the things that Oakmoss hated is making decisions, she was never good at it, sometimes needing someone to persuade her into choosing the certain decision.<br />
<br />
A few hours have passed, the group walked towards the castle of the kingdom, Luka and Ethel were infront of the group, both of them holding hands, making them look like a young couple, Karyu smiled at this, he always wanted his Rider to be happy with someone, behind them were Celestia and Oliver, who were also holding hands, sometimes they would kiss eachother, just like Karyu, this made Oakmoss happy aswell, behind the second Kilin couple were Karyu who entwined his tail with Oakmoss&#39; and covered the delicate hen with his great wings, the demonic dragon god noticed that most of the time many of the citizens of the kingdom would stare at him, as if they know him, although he ignored them most of the time, lastly, behind the two dragons were Astrid and Hilda who gave an adorable look at Karyu and Oakmoss.<br />
<br />
Eventually the group reached the gates of the castle, a guard quickly approached them, Karyu inspected the garb of the soldier, the guard had red cloth armor with small implementations of plate, the guard&#39;s head was covered with a hood of the same color, meanwhile the face was covered with a steel mask with fine carvings of runes and other arcane symbols, on the torso of the guard was the emblem of the kingdom, a phoenix, the guard also held a javelin with the same carvings as the mask, Karyu could feel magic resonating both from the weapon and the guard, confirming that the kingdom was indeed one of the few kingdoms of magic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Halt, explain your purposes.&quot; Said the guard quickly with a determined voice, stopping the group from advancing.<br />
<br />
&quot;We wish an audience with her highness.&quot; Replied Luka, with a reasonable voice, the guard looked at each member of the group, after looking at each one, the guard quickly nodded and moved aside, with a swift gesture of his left hand, the gate opened, allowing the group to enter, &quot;We thank you.&quot; said Luka as she and the group entered the castle.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of walking through the beautiful hallways of the castle, the group finally reached the throne room, the royal guard opened the doors of the throne room, the group was greeted with the queen of the kingdom, Alyssa, who didn&#39;t lay on a throne, she laid on her knees in a small spot of burning magma, it didn&#39;t harm her, but it looked painful, the group looked at the queen, she weared a beautiful transparent white dress, which looked like to be on fire, but it didn&#39;t burn, the queen had beautiful long pale gold hair, the queen also weared a beautiful dainty leaf crown, behind the queen was her beautiful dragoness, Ravenna, who also laid on the magma, not causing any form of harm, the wings of the dragoness had a feathery look, and her horns were curved, the queen always kept her eyes closed, meanwhile the dragoness would keep her eyes open, staring at Karyu, who quickly noticed that her eyes changed colorations as each second passed, from a pale blue to a dark blue, the group slowly approached the queen.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you here, to my kingdom?&quot; Asked Alyssa suddenly, her voice being calm and tender, the group quickly paused, all except Luka.<br />
<br />
&quot;We come under the order of King Adam Solarius and Queen Elisa Solarius, to ask for a-&quot; Started Luka, only to be replied with an adorable giggle from the queen, who slowly got up from the magma and approached Luka.<br />
<br />
&quot;In desperation the king and the queen send their most trusted elites to ask me for an alliance.&quot; Said Alyssa with a small sigh, her eyes being closed all of the time, &quot;Most of their diplomats made fools of themselves by how they treated my Kilin citizens.&quot; mentioned Alyssa, &quot;I don&#39;t blame them, they were raised with the belief that dragons are nothing more than savage animals who were forced to obey their every order.&quot; said Alyssa suddenly, by hearing this Luka, Celestia, Oliver and Ethel looked down in sadness, the fact that their kingdoms treated dragons that way almost made them defect to other kingdoms.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, when i look at you and your group, i don&#39;t see the same belief.&quot; Mentioned Alyssa as she went closer to Luka, who quickly raised her head to look at the pale queen, &quot;I see something... That i never saw from any of the citizens from their kingdoms, i see four Riders, who treat their dragons as people.&quot; said Alyssa as she opened her eyes, revealing that just like her dragon, her eyes also change colors, but unlike Ravenna, the hue doesn&#39;t change, the color completly changes, from a celestine blue to an emerald green, from an amber yellow to a ruby red.<br />
<br />
Alyssa kept a firm eye contact with Luka, &quot;Now tell me my dear, how do you see your dragon?&quot; asked Alyssa as she looked at Karyu for a second only to look back at Luka, with a smile on her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see my dragon as a member of my family.&quot; Replied Luka, &quot;I don&#39;t care if we don&#39;t have the same blood, i don&#39;t care if we don&#39;t have the same appearance, i love him.&quot; continued Luka, &quot;I would throw myself against a hail of arrows just to save his life, i would descend the darkest caves just to hear his voice.&quot; finished Luka, this made Karyu open his mouth several times, but no words came out, a certain pride and joy filled his heart, Alyssa nodded.<br />
<br />
The queen looked at Celestia, &quot;Tell me sweetie, how do you see your dragon?&quot; asked Alyssa again as she approached the young chemist, who was close to Oakmoss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just like lady Luka, i see my dragon as a member of my family.&quot; Replied Celestia quickly, &quot;People can judge me all they want, i will forever see Oakmoss as someone who is part of my family.&quot; said Celestia with honesty in her voice.<br />
<br />
Alyssa questioned Oliver and Ethel how they see their dragons, then she asked the dragons on how they see their Riders, being only replied with positive responses.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the first Riders i&#39;ve met from abroad kingdoms who don&#39;t see their dragons as slaves, but as family or lovers.&quot; Said Alyssa with a happy voice, &quot;And for that, i will ally myself with your kingdoms.&quot; confirmed Alyssa.</p>
