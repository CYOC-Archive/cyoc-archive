<br />
A noise outside the bathroom door caused her to stop.  <br />
<br />
“Jim?” she asked  <br />
<br />
No answer.  She wrapped a towel around her waist and walked out into the bedroom and froze.  <br />
<br />
Von Crucial smiled as he looked at his prey.  “I see you have landed on  your feet Janice.”  And with a wave of his hand her expression went  blank and she stood rigid, transfixed completely naked.    <br />
<br />
He walked over to where she stood, and examined her top to bottom as if  admiring his work.  Reaching up he probed around her anus.  If she  could, she would have screamed but his magic had practically paralyzed  her.  <br />
<br />
“Anjiea, tell our friend in Tucson that it looks like we’ll have her  order delivered shortly.  I have one more custom modification to Work  Order 42225-4 before it’s ready to ship” he said telepathically   <br />
<br />
“Yes, Sir.  Are you ready to transport?”   <br />
<br />
“Give me 5 minutes… and can you give me the specs for Work Order 42225-8?”  <br />
<br />
“One moment while I query the database…ok…it’s the standard TX4RM-A.  Will you be transporting that as well?”  <br />
<br />
“Standby”  <br />
<br />
With is hand he brushed Janice’s breasts and they began to shrink.  Like  deflating balloons they lost their shape and hung as empty sacks  against her chest and upper stomach, nipples erect in the cool air  pointing to the floor.  <br />
<br />
“Initiating portal”    <br />
<br />
A bright light flashed and in the middle of the room a large oval  two-dimensional disk appeared standing nearly 6 ft tall and 4 ft wide.  <br />
<br />
Janice’s body was levitated and adjusted into a horizontal position, and  almost as if it were on a gurney, her empty breasts hanging off the  side of her torso,  it moved feet first into the portal and disappeared.  <br />
<br />
Jim had been concerned about Janice, and even though he didn’t want to  think about what was happening in there, she was still his wife, and he  had genuine concerns about her health and state of mind.  However the  who anus/face thing was starting to creep him out.    <br />
<br />
He walked to the door and knocked softly before turning the knob and walking in.  <br />
<br />
Von Crucial turned to face the door as it opened and smiled  <br />
<br />
“It looks like we have a TX4RM-A in inventory after all”  <br />
<br />
“Should I contact our customer?” Anjiea said  <br />
<br />
“Not yet, our friend in Cairo may also be interested as well…let him  know we just received shipment”  he replied as he contemplated a bidding  war between the two.  <br />
<br />
Jim entered and at first it didn’t register what he was seeing but  before he could react Von Crucial already had him.  With a wave, Jim  froze, his face locked into a wide eyed, open mouthed expression of  surprise and fear.  <br />
<br />
Von Crucial waved his hand again and Jim’s clothes vanished, leaving him  stark naked in the doorway except for the talisman Detective James had  given him.  Zombie like, he then took a few steps forward to where Von  Crucial was standing.  <br />
<br />
Von Crucial reached up and jerked the talisman from Jim’s neck and  smiled, as he knew now who this new stranger was as their psychic link  was once again reinstated.  <br />
<br />
“Did you enjoy the show Mr. Tome?” Max said in a bemusing tone.  <br />
<br />
Jim could not answer, but if he could have he would have a few choice  words for the man who did such monstrous things to his wife.  <br />
<br />
“She’ll be just fine Mr. Tome.  My collectors are very serious about  their artwork.  You can be assured she’ll be well taken care of.  As for  you, after a few modifications I should be able to have you prepped and  delivered promptly, to the highest bidder of course.”  <br />
<br />
“Anjiea, tell our friends bidding starts at 50,000.”  <br />
<br />
The first think he did was wave his hand and all of Jim’s bodily hair  disappeared so that he was as fresh and smooth as a newborn…except for  the hair on his head which was left untouched.  <br />
<br />
Stepping behind Jim, Von Crucial then started murmuring in a foreign language and Jim felt his body begin to tingle and vibrate.  <br />
<br />
Von Crucial placed his hand on Jim’s head and pushed down with gentle  but firm pressure.  Jim was helpless as he saw the room grow around him  and when his point of view stopped, he felt child like as the dresser  and doorways now towered above him.  He felt two hands grab each side of  his head and suddenly twist clockwise and in a quick moment Jim was now  looking directly at Max Von Crucial&#39;s belt buckle.   <br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Max stepped back for a better look at his work.  The alterations had  resulted in a very odd site.  Jim’s entire torso had either been removed  or compressed so that all his body was comprised of was a head and  shoulders resting directly atop a set of hips and legs.  The final  alteration and most visually shocking was that his head had been turned  180 so that he faced backward, over his buttocks.    <br />
<br />
Von Crucial frowned as he looked at he dimpled, pale flesh.  “This won’t  do at all” he thought and with a wave, Jim’s body shimmered and was  transformed again.  What was left of his body changed shape and his skin  softened and darkened slightly.  The hips and buttocks became more  rounder, firmer and defiantly feminine, as did the legs and around the  front, his male genitals now were replaced with the naked bald cleft of  female genitals.  <br />
<br />
“There, much better.” Von Crucial said aloud.    <br />
<br />
“Anjiea, do we have any bids?”  <br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like communications are breaking up, something is interfering with the feed&quot; Anijea responded  <br />
<br />
&#39;This wont do at all&quot; Max said looking pitifully down at the minuscule form of the former jim.  <br />
<br />
Suddenly, alarms sounded followed by voices outside the doorway.  <br />
<br />
Detective Jon James had just arrived back in the compound from the  failed attempt to apprehend Von Crucial at the old warehouse.  The  mission had been a failure and he even lost two men.  <br />
<br />
“Sir, sensors are picking up irregular continuum modulation in building 2”  Officer Joy Peal said as he entered the checkpoint.  <br />
<br />
“That’s where the Tome’s are staying.” He said with concern.  “Let’s go”  he said “I’m not losing another witness to this bastard send everything  you’ve got, initiate Code 9.”  <br />
<br />
“Code 9 Code 9” she said into her radio  “This is not a drill, report to your staging areas, I repeat Code 9.”  <br />
<br />
“Get your gear, meet me at staging area 2” he said the pretty young redhead.</p>
