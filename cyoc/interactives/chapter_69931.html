<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">30 year old Megan was a signal mother who had short black hair, blue eyes, and fairly tanned skin. She was <br />
tall and had a great body. She had a 6 year old daughter named Stephanie who was nicer then most kids her age. <br />
She had a sister named Selena who had a 12 year old son named Chris. Chris and Stephanie played together all <br />
the time and were close. Megan knew this and so she made Chris Stephanie's Godfather, should any thing happen <br />
to her. Little did she know how close that was. <br />
<br />
One evening Megan was driving home from a long day at work, she was really tired and started to doze off, <br />
suddenly she collided with another car. When the paramedics got to the scene they got her out of her car as <br />
quick as possible and rushed her to the hospital. They did everything they could but she had lost the will to <br />
live. As soon as Selena got the call her and Chris picked up Stephanie and rushed to the Hospital. <br />
<br />
Once there Megan's Doctor came in and told Selena that she wasn't going to make it. Too shocked for words the <br />
Doctors told Selena that they needed to speak with Chris in private and that they needed her to come and fill <br />
out some paper work. But really, they were taking her to a machine that would wipe her memory clean of Chris <br />
ever existing. <br />
<br />
One of the doctors took Stephanie to the daycare center and another took Chris to see his dying aunt. As he <br />
entered her room he saw Megan laying in her bed barely breathing but awake. He walked over to her and she <br />
looked over at him to speak. &quot;Chris, we both know how close you are to my daughter and how you promised that <br />
you would take care of her if something ever happened to me, but I don't want her to know that I'm going to <br />
die, I just don't think she could handle it.&quot; She took Chris by the hand and continued.&quot; So I had the Doctors <br />
take some of my DNA and modify it, and after I'm dead they will inject it into and you will turn into me&quot;. <br />
&quot;What? No! I don't want to!&quot; Said Chris backing away. &quot;according to the law sweaty you have no choice, the <br />
Doctors have already modified your mothers and Stephanie's memories&quot;. said Megan. She started getting weaker <br />
and weaker. &quot;Please...promise me.....that you will...take care...of my baby girl.&quot;. Chris sighed remembering <br />
how much he cared for his cousin. &quot;Okay&quot; he said. Then she died. <br />
<br />
After her body was removed one of the doctors came in and injected Chris with the modified DNA and told him to <br />
get into a hospital gown since he would get bigger and would rip his own clothing. As night time came, Chris laid in his bed thinking about how much different his life would be after this. Suddenly his whole body <br />
started hurting. He got up and went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror, that's when he realized that <br />
he was getting taller, as he did the gown seemed to shrink on him showing more of his changing body, his privates started going into him as a vagina formed making him a girl, her butt started growing larger becoming <br />
more heat shaped as her hips widened and she became more curvier, her stomach became more muscular as Megan <br />
worked out a lot, as her torso continued growing she looked down at her nipples to see to buds appear there, <br />
she arched her back to let them grow into breast, she heard her skin stretching as her breast grew from A-cup <br />
to B-cub to large C-cup breast, her arms grew longer becoming more muscular as her fingers grew longer, she <br />
leaned forward again back in the mirror so she her head growing as her face deformed to rearrange from a 12 <br />
year old boys face to a 30 year old gorgeous woman's face as it became more oval shaped and all her features <br />
changed into Megan's. The Changes stopped and Megan/Chris was able to catch her breath her breast jiggling as  <br />
she breathed heavily. Then she felt her new body, once she was done playing with her self she smiled at her <br />
reflection. <br />
<br />
The next day Megan/Chris was walking out of the hospital with her Daughter.</p>
