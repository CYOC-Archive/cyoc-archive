<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was something cold splashing his muzzle lightly...water. He heard a familiar voice murmuring at him, but couldn&#39;t bring himself to pay it any mind - in truth, he could barely understand it, it seemed so far away.<br />
He ached all over, but especially his ass and cock. Not pain, just ache, as if they&#39;d been in heavy use.<br />
Images flashed through his mind at that point - the stud shoving him into the breeding chute, the stud pinning him to the wall, the stud bouncing up in the air on the stud&#39;s cock...<br />
Tony smiled blankly, and the murmuring voice continued, a little clearer. There was that gentle splash again, and Tony thought he could make out<br />
&quot;Drink. Easy. Drink.&quot;<br />
so he opened his mouth and felt some sort of rubber tube slip in. Reflexively, he closed his mouth on it and began sucking. Cool, refreshing water trickled down his throat.<br />
<br />
He felt off somehow, but couldn&#39;t quite pin it down. The rubber tube was gently pulled from his mouth.<br />
&quot;Slow down, Tony, you&#39;ll choke. Easy, boy.&quot;<br />
Max, that&#39;s who it was. He opened his eyes...his vision was a bit blurred, but it was starting to come into focus. He brought a hand up, reflexively, to guide the water bottle back to his mouth as Max went to replace it. Hands...so he&#39;d been taken out of the harness...<br />
<br />
An image resurfaced from the jumble of his mind. They&#39;d passed out in the stall after a time, and when they&#39;d awoken both he and Roger were free from their harnesses. He woke first, and took the opportunity to finally top Roger in his addled state. Roger had certainly not seemed to mind, but no sooner than Tony had cum, Roger had ripped him off and shoved him in the chute, locking him in...Again, Tony could only smile dumbly at the sheer pleasure that had been involved.<br />
<br />
When he zoned back in again, Max was still stroking his face, giving him water. He tried to speak, coughed.<br />
&quot;Easy boy,&quot; said Max, &quot;Take it slow.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ro...ger?&quot;<br />
&quot;Bob&#39;s got him. He&#39;s basically got his head in a trough of an electrolyte solution. He came around a bit before you, and so once you&#39;re a little more stable I&#39;ll get you over to it as well. You both need to seriously restore yourselves before we do anything else.&quot;<br />
Tony nodded, grinning weakly.<br />
&quot;Mm, but it was worth it...&quot;<br />
Max chuckled, patting the pony&#39;s flank.<br />
&quot;I&#39;m glad, because Liz thinks it&#39;ll be a week before you work off the weight.&quot;<br />
Tony smiled, but then his brow furrowed.<br />
&quot;Weight...?&quot;<br />
Max smirked.<br />
&quot;Look down, slowly, so as not to give yourself a fright.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tony slowly turned his head, then finished more sharply, gasping aloud. He knew why he felt off, now.<br />
His gut was as big as a watermelon, and sloshing gently. Max patted it, sending a thrill of pleasure through Tony, who groaned.<br />
&quot;One of the finer points of being the bottom to a breeder pony, little brother. Especially when you were his *only* bottom for his entire first two days. It&#39;ll take days to clean all of your cum from that stall, but Roger was much tidier - all of his jizz is currently in your digestive tract.&quot;<br />
Tony groaned, sitting up, cradling his swollen gut.<br />
&quot;Fuck, how can I race like this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Poorly, which is why as your owner I&#39;m limiting you and Roger to only have marathon sessions when it&#39;s the offseason. Don&#39;t worry, like I said, Liz has plenty of experience with breeder ponies, and you&#39;ll digest or expel all of that over the course of a week.&quot;<br />
Tony nodded, groaning still, stroking his belly.<br />
&quot;How does this even work...?&quot;<br />
&quot;It&#39;s part of what your breeder nanites do in an attempt to keep you from injuring yourself when you intake large loads of semen. Apparently, some breeder pony owners really get off on seeing their ponyboys look like they were knocked up with a colt, so it&#39;s baked into the breeding program to handle it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max slowly helped Tony stand, wobbling on his feet. His cum-belly hung fairly high on his frame since, unlike a real pregnant belly, this weight was actually in his digestive tract. Still, it was quite jiggly, and it made Tony giggle slightly when he saw it. Max chuckled too.<br />
&quot;So poor Roger is gonna be producing massive loads like this his whole career, huh?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s be clear, that&#39;s two days worth of extremely high production. But, yes. Now that Roger&#39;s had the full treatment as a breeder pony, his cum is actually of a different chemical composition than mine or even yours; his jizz and that of the rest of the breeder ponies will become a valuable ingredient in cosmetics, so he&#39;ll be milked daily.&quot;<br />
Tony was a little wide-eyed, and Max smirked. <br />
&quot;And oh yes, brother dear, that&#39;ll include you once you retire from racing. You&#39;ll be earning me money for decades yet.&quot;<br />
Tony felt that familiar twinge of a little fear mixed with a lot of arousal, and licked his lips.<br />
&quot;So, Roger will be...&quot;<br />
&quot;Strapped into a robotic mare every morning to collect his daily produce, not counting the fuckings he&#39;ll be giving you to help with your mood and herd morale. And, remember, Tony, racing ponies have relatively short careers. You&#39;ll be in the same boat in...&quot; Max appeared to think, drawing out his brother&#39;s interest and enjoying the look of pure desire on Tony&#39;s face.<br />
&quot;Five years, give or take two.&quot;<br />
Tony gulped, but licked his lips.<br />
&quot;I gotta admit, that sounds...really dehumanizing.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh yes, utterly animalistic, pure livestock sort of thing,&quot; Max said calmly.<br />
Tony licked his lips again.<br />
&quot;...I&#39;m so looking forward to it.&quot;<br />
&quot;Ooooof course you are, you big perv,&quot; Max said affectionately, ruffling Tony&#39;s mane. <br />
<br />
He and Tony chuckled together as he helped his pony brother out to the paddock where the trough and Roger were.<br />
&quot;So, his jizz is different...&quot; Tony said thoughtfully. Max nodded.<br />
&quot;Mm. The downside is, of course, that it&#39;s no longer chemically capable of housing sperm. Breeders are ironically sterile. However, it&#39;s standard procedure to take sperm samples from volunteer breeder ponies before the transformation starts, so the process can be reversed if the volunteer chooses to retire they can have that part reversed.&quot;<br />
Tony brightened.<br />
&quot;So...Roger could still...&quot;<br />
Max smiled indulgently.<br />
&quot;Yes, someday you and Roger could still give me a niece or a nephew. I also had them take samples from you - just to be safe. But that&#39;s all years in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
They had reached the paddock. Bob, the new guy Tony vaguely recalled getting him off the trailer, was gently fanning Roger, who was slumped by the trough, electrolyte solution dripping from his muzzle. He waved at Tony weakly, who waved back, before wobbling over and slumping down next to him, leaning in to kiss his lover.<br />
&quot;Wow, you look like someone rode you pretty hard, Roger.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really? I wonder who could have done that...&quot; Roger said wryly. He gestured at Tony&#39;s midsection.<br />
&quot;I feel strangely proud of that, though.&quot;<br />
Tony wickered, before shoving his own head into the trough and chugging. Max came around the other side of the trough, hands on hips.<br />
&quot;Alright, now, you two. You&#39;ve got a lot of rest and such ahead, but first, there&#39;s a bit of work to be done.&quot;<br />
Bob was grinning and it was clear that Max was struggling to keep a straight face. Meanwhile Tony and Roger had no clue what he was getting at.<br />
&quot;But we just got up!&quot; Tony whined.<br />
&quot;Yeah, come on, master, have a heart!&quot; said Roger.<br />
<br />
Bob was clearly struggling not to crack up entirely, but Max just shook his head slightly.<br />
&quot;Oh, calm down, the pair of you. It doesn&#39;t require you to get up, just listen and answer my questions.&quot;<br />
Roger and Tony looked at each other dubiously, then looked back at Max, nodding.<br />
&quot;Very good. Now, listen closely. As your owner, I have a great many rights, but few obligations. One such obligation is one I am happy to fulfill now.&quot;<br />
Max half-turned to his brother, his eyes suddenly affectionate.<br />
&quot;Tony, do you agree to be the mate of Roger?&quot;<br />
Tony and Roger gasped, and Bob&#39;s grin broke out into a beam.<br />
&quot;I...I do?&quot; said Tony, looking at Roger. He felt his heart swell, not to mention other organs. &quot;I...I do.&quot;<br />
&quot;And you, Roger, do you agree to be the mate of Tony?&quot; asked Max, looking at Roger.<br />
&quot;With all my heart, I do,&quot; said Tony, gazing at Tony lovingly.<br />
<br />
Max clapped his hands.<br />
&quot;Then as your owner, I hereby declare you mated. You may kiss the stud.&quot;<br />
Tony and Roger pulled each other into a kiss, with Max looking on proudly and Bob giving a round of applause.</p>
