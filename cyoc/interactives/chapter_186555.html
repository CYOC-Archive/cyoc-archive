<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before long, clothes arrived from an intern for Carl - a tank top, new boxer underwear, shorts, socks, and a baseball cap. Carl grinned and got up, eagerly walking over to the pile of clothes left for him at the door, flexing his back while he picked up the shirt, knowing full well that Melissa was watching him. He could hear her let out a sigh as she observed him putting on the shirt. Carl looked at the tank top as he put it on - the shirt had tiny little thin fabric things that went over his broad shoulders, showing his chest and even nipples. He had no idea what a stringer tank was, but...<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, do young guys in athletic shape these days really dress like this...?&quot; Carl commented...and then flexed his arms immediately, enjoying the freedom of movement his new apparel gave him. Before long he fully got dressed, turning and looking at Melissa, &quot;Hey, so...how do I look? I mean, this is my first time wearing clothes from this generation rather than my own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look so handsome, Carl,&quot; Melissa went over, exercising her wiles and kissing his cheek, feeling his strong shoulder with one hand.<br />
<br />
Just that feeling made Carl gulp and yet again his manhood stiffened in his shorts. He didn&#39;t exactly remember how easily his body fired up like this, so he just wondered if this was normal, reacting this heavily to just a woman touching him. He certainly didn&#39;t remember being so easy to excite back in the day.<br />
<br />
It took him a moment to cool his jets so he didn&#39;t look awkward, Melissa stepping back while Carl tried to think unsexy thoughts. While he did, this time his manhood only went half-hard - though it was at least not as immediately noticeable as before. Hopefully he could retain control of himself better now. As Carl looked himself over, he realized just how little he really resembled himself any more. He had truly left the perils of old age and become a young, muscled modern day youth.<br />
<br />
Would Carl end up having to return to high school...? He certainly didn&#39;t look forward to the idea. He did definitely still remember everything, so maybe he could just lie a little bit about his age and pass himself off as his own grandson or something. &quot;Alright, Mel, let&#39;s head out. I&#39;ve got a car in the garage downstairs, and I know all the nice places around town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lead the way, big man,&quot; Melissa urged him on, and Carl beamed as he swaggered into the elevator, followed by Melissa closely after.<br />
<br />
As he got it going to the garage, he contemplated how this was gonna look to anyone watching. Maybe it&#39;d look kind of odd, but he didn&#39;t really mind. He was a man with money, even if he didn&#39;t exactly look like it right now. And he had the perfect cover story for his endeavors. As the elevator stopped in the garage, Melissa once again put a hand on his shoulder, making Carl lightly push his teeth against his lip. &quot;Just making sure...are you feeling alright? I mean, you seem to freeze up every now and then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m fine. Really. Let&#39;s just go get some lunch and have our date!&quot; Carl felt a burgeoning sense of eagerness. Melissa was now older than him physically at least. And while he retained his sense of how to handle himself on a date, his new youthful hormones were driving him forward with a new sense of urgency and eagerness. By the time they got in the car, Carl having to adjust the seat a few times in line with his new height, Melissa held off of any further touching.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t want, after all, to make Carl feel too awkward. He was obviously dealing with his new body&#39;s...issues.<br />
<br />
Carl found himself driving slightly more recklessly than he usually did when he actually bothered to drive. The testosterone, he told himself, it made him eager, prone to reckless behavior, wanting to show off for his lunch date. Melissa actually scolded him a little bit, &quot;Carl! You&#39;re kind of cutting it close there, don&#39;t you think?&quot; He just sighed at the time and held back on any further showy driving.<br />
<br />
Besides, he had a body he could use to show off.<br />
<br />
And a thing he had in mind to do as soon as they got there. Once they arrived at a rather fancy diner, as soon as Carl stepped out of the car and locked it behind him, he went ahead and prepped before doing an impromptu backflip right then and there. Landing squarely on his feet and feeling charged up, he looked at Melissa with a grin. She responded with applause and complimented him, &quot;Wow...my oh my, you really are quite an athlete at this age.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, you have NO idea!&quot; Carl led the way into the diner to get seated, Melissa watching his muscular back the whole way through.<br />
<br />
As Carl got their seats and paid for all you can eat at the diner&#39;s self serve area, Melissa noted that a couple of the wealthier guests were staring a little bit at him. He looked for all the world like a regular, rather unremarkable teenage boy - and yet here he was paying for lunch in an upscale diner. Already however it looked like for all the staring, Carl made a friend.<br />
<br />
Another young man from an upscale family approached him as both were getting some food. The young man had combed back blond hair, looked to be about two years older than Carl was now, and had a slightly less well built body, but Melissa could still see he kept himself in shape. His baby blue eyes were downright charming. &quot;I saw your trick out there! You&#39;re really in pretty impressive shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, thank you.&quot; Carl answered, &quot;I AM really into fitness.&quot; Carl looked at the polo shirt and jeans clad preppy lad and said, &quot;I can tell you&#39;re pretty in shape yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, nowhere near as good as you.&quot; The young man paused and said, &quot;My name&#39;s Thomas Arnoult, but you can just call me Tom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice to meet ya, Tom,&quot; Carl replied, &quot;My name&#39;s Carl Booth II.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! So you&#39;re related to old Carlyle Booth?&quot; Tom immediately stated, &quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re, like me, a bit of a trustfund brat.&quot; Tom chuckled a little in his self deprecation, &quot;My dad and his dad before him have some money in store for me. Technically I&#39;m Thomas Arnoult III, but I hate how adding that three to the end makes me sound.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I got you!&quot; He and Carl promptly fistbumped and returned to their seats. Melissa figured that Carl was just making friends, though as Carl returned to his seat, he couldn&#39;t help but think about his date...and about Tom. The beautiful, sexy curves of Melissa&#39;s body, the mystique and allure she represented, and the handsome, well put together features of Mr. Arnoult... hm, maybe it was just him being overcharged as usual. Carl just went ahead and started eating along with Melissa, figuring he just needed food in his stomach.</p>
