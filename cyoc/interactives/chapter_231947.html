<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Zoe was alone in a room curled up in a ball trying to block out all the sensations in her head... ALL THE BLOODY...<br />
It had started with her going outside and figuring out she kinda needed to sign up for some classes if she really wanted to make progress with the whole magic part of this magic school thing. Too many roadblocks in learning spells and the escape bedroom by just kind of winging learning magic. Then one of the [Puzzlers] in Solrss&#39; club mentioned the illusion classes which were notoriously hard to find. Zoe took that as a challenge not thinking about whether or not she actually wanted to study Illusions. Ill-u-sion, Ill-us-ion? As a hunch at the start Zoe used her new mana sight glasses to wander around the medical ward in places she could be and then found some weird mana trails, then found a corridor with 8 doors and the mana trails went to 7 of them. She knocked on the 8th door, heard a &quot;come in&quot; and found a succubus on a pile of men... All those things in the room were all illusionary and there seemed to be something on the other side of the room. Zoe sighed hating little tricks like this and decided to walk through the illusion... It was just a hologram right?<br />
She had moved slower as she got through the illusion, she tried closing her eyes but the illusion of blood, organs, and everything penetrated her eyelids. She felt warm gooky sensations, and &quot;CANCEL THIS SPELL!!! PLEASE CANCEL THIS!!! CANCEL CANCEL CANCEL-&quot; she had been screaming her throat hoarse as her mind just couldn&#39;t tolerate wading through literal bodies whether or not they were actually there. It took her a few good minutes before she realized she could feel someone hugging her. The sensation of being literally inside of a dozen bodies at once was gone, and she saw the succubus but she was wearing a wizard&#39;s robes... She was also still made out of mana entirely. <br />
&quot;Calmed down?&quot; She asked<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Zoe was still shaking and not entirely sure why she was comforted by this person who she didn&#39;t know very well who was hugging her, but not actually there, but-<br />
&quot;Relax [Relax]&quot; The Succubus said and Zoe stopped shaking &quot;I&#39;m sorry that little thing went too far. Usually people just ask me to cancel the illusion... or they are a bit too bloodthirsty and relish that part where we then end up kicking the person out of the school, but... I was curious how far you&#39;d go, and I apologize for things getting so far out of hand.&quot; The illusionary Succubus stopped hugging Zoe and said &quot;I&#39;m Professor Loveheart, and am in charge of the illusion curriculum. It&#39;s a little different from most in the fact that you have to find your way here yourself. There are of course a few routes, and you found one. Please don&#39;t share it around.&quot; <br />
Zoe felt a little intimidated, but was able to say &quot;I think I&#39;m more interested in Enchantment actually... I just wanted to see if I could find this place.&quot;<br />
Loveheart chuckled and said &quot;Do you think no one&#39;s used an illusion enchantment before? Besides I&#39;d thought someone like you may have been interested in having a succubus as an instructor.&quot; Zoe felt a little pale as the Succubus chuckled &quot;There&#39;s this little weird thing about us Succubi, we can just kinda tell when someone&#39;s doven a little bit into the sexual classes. A Shame you aren&#39;t a Succubus your-&quot;<br />
&quot;What if I could be?&quot; Loveheart looked puzzled at Zoe&#39;s interruption &quot;I mean... temporarily a Succubus... or something?&quot; Zoe wasn&#39;t sure how deep she wanted to delve into the perverted side but... she wanted more power for this run, and figuring out magics and... Surely this was some path towards a deeper understanding of magic. Zoe took out her wand for body enchanting and drew the complex formulas from her class, and with the mutter &quot;[Change Species]&quot; and Zoe willing her body to not resist she started feeling off. For those curious a Succubus in this world may be what you imagine Large breasts, butts, a devil&#39;s tail, some goat horns, and the ones here also had goat hooves. Zoe imagined her maybe enjoying the bump in figure, but she quickly figured out the spell she had cast didn&#39;t have safe guards for her flesh and bones stretching, reformatting, and manipulating her mass to a dramatic extent. Zoe writhed on the floor happy that her mage&#39;s robes were all she wore besides underwear since the robes had a nice enchantment in them... although the undergarments were a little more tight than she&#39;d have liked. <br />
&quot;Interesting... That&#39;s not a bound spell one would normally get as some fledgling, but that wand... makes some sense. Alright I&#39;ll take some time off to start tutoring you. I&#39;ll find you, consider yourself an Illusionist.&quot; Professor Loveheart said before her illusion vanished. <br />
<br />
Zoe was in pain, tired, and not interested in the other side of the door at the moment. She just walked out, went out through the corridor when a weird sensation flew into her chest as she past by some male students... They were checking her out and... It was like her body was sustaining itself on their lust... This was interesting, and with that [Ambient Mana Nourishment: limited] skill she wondered how long she could sustain herself on mere mana and lust alone. Walking down a more crowded hall people paid her a bit less attention, but when guys bumped into Zoe she made little whispers of a moan. Her whole body was sensitive, and with the press of body to body she could feel the lust seeping into her pores despite her mage&#39;s robes being in the way. More over with each of those small moans she could feel more and more lust being let out, and Zoe felt fear in her heart. Fear that someone might try something on her, and fear that she slightly wanted someone to try something on her. She gasped as she got to her room in the corridor few people went and entered her room where she found Solrss reading from his book of magic with a platter with all sorts of food on it. <br />
&quot;Why hello... Who are you miss?&quot; Solrss asked puzzlement on his face as he was trying to rectify this person who looked like Zoe, but was obviously not human. Zoe didn&#39;t even know what her face looked like as a succubus, but-<br />
Zoe took her wand out and before some weird instinct of this horny species could kick in &quot;[Change Species]&quot; and yet there was something about Zoe who wanted to have shown this spell to Solrss first, some part of the succubi who wanted to comfort him... maybe some part that made her feel like he was a bit of an older brother of sorts. Said motives and sentiment didn&#39;t matter at all in how bad of an idea that was for her considering unlike the mostly humanoid form staying mostly the same with a change here and there... Her succubus tail lengthened, became more rigid, wings grew out from her back, her hair sucked in as scales covered her whole body, and... Zoe collapsed saying &quot;Owie...&quot; <br />
Solrss looked concerned and confused &quot;A bound spell? Zoe is that?&quot; It didn&#39;t matter much what Solrss was asking as Zoe blacked out from the pain. <br />
