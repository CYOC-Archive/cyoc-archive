<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>as pointed out by LostYoshi<br/>
<br/>
i had made a number of errors but also maybe put the side at risk by having Copyrighted martial in the chapter so I had to edit it out. if you can describe &quot;trak wars&quot; or &quot;war star&quot; characters in a better way than I can feel free to do the Rave chapter.<br/>
</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Izzy while looking over his handy work and wondering what would it take even to cause panic, what would be made for the best possible trick to shack everyone to the core. he was starting to kind of enjoy the plots that he was coming up with to try and get a rise out of people. Maybe the old coyote spirit was rubbing off on him, or maybe Stockholm syndrome is finally kicking in as he was effectively a prisoner of his own body.  when a furry off-colored hand paw shoved a flyer into your face. the hand led back to this greenish violate-looking furry suit that had seen better days of some kind of shark wolf thing, the headdress that looked to be missing an eye hole, taped up with blunt gray duck tape reminded you and the spirit of cheese for some reason. <br />
<br />
&quot;yo bud, great furry suit, kind of reminds me of one of the old native American alien ghost spirit things from that new trek-wars remake remaster reimaging thing that came out last summer, here take this invitation to really be about to show off that tail of yours to your fellow sci-furs.&quot; the moaned voice from the suit said as you grabbed the paper from his grasp. <br />
<br />
it was an invite to a grouping of adult-themed room parties going by the &quot;Kirk effect&quot; that had an anthropomorphic green rabbit version of  William Shatner as his iconic character James T Kirk with nothing on by a blanket smoking a death stick while under said blanket nearly every popular alien race, protagonist and villain in suggestive poses like they just had a massive orgel<br />
<br />
&quot;what your mortals come up with surprising me sometimes...at least you humans are putting that cunning to some use even if it is just for the act of mating,&quot; coyote said in Izzy&#39;s head as he reads more of the flyer, it is an all-day party, and kindly ask only for donations of food, weed, and condoms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...ahh&quot; he looks at a small name tag on the fursuiters chest, cheesy the sergal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cheesy, ill try to make it up there if I...<br />
<br />
&quot;when&quot; coyote corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;...when I have the time to get up there.&quot; Izzy was forced to say as the Sergal made happy little cheese head sounds and marched off to find more furry sci-fi geeks...and the random hot guy to invite to the party.<br />
<br />
&quot;So...I saw that you have a great deal of peyote in your backpack and if your memory isn&#39;t off enough condoms for a room full of beastly weirdos back in your pickup.&quot; you can hear the coyotes grin in the tone of his voice as you know exactly what he was planning.<br />
<br />
A short walk back to your hotel and one elevator right later, Izzy had with him a paper bag full of his tribe&#39;s best peyote in one paw and at least 6 boxes of &quot;beastal urges&quot; brand condoms that some of your tribe gave you for the trip. Not sure that said about your love life to the tribe but at least it should be a good offering to the horny sci-fi furries. the doors open and you see that the room party is being held in one of the hotel Master suites. half the hotel floor with a view dedicated to all things sci-fi yiff, as you see a pair of dudes in mursuits of gray alien and a bigfoot like alien getting it on in the Foyer as you walk in, complete with working slits for junk as they fuck in front of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I should be here,&quot; Izzy said in his head as the pair of lovers eyed the anthro coyote&#39;s body and whispered barely audible to anyone but the man in front of him and a 6-foot-something animal person like Izzy was &quot;maybe we can fuck that later?&quot; as they got back to their foreplay.<br />
<br />
&quot;relax cub, they&#39;re just acting on their animalistic urges, sex is one of the most beautiful parts of nature and with my input on the matter, one of the most pleasurable ones at that, thank you very much.&quot; the Coyote said humbly as you walked through the halls trying to find where to drop off the party payment.<br />
<br />
Izzy placed a number of rooms each seeming to be a different flavor of sci-fi if not with a kinky twist. one room had a number of furry fandoms original alien races in fursuit from like Sergals from earlier, the robotic synths, and a few Protogen debating on who was the real &quot;illegal protogen&quot; whatever that means the two would never really know. The next place was a big dining room that&#39;s been turned into a large all-day rave party, the both of them see a number of cosplayers of differing quality of popular sci-fi characters. Izzy wasn&#39;t too familiar with the modern sci-fi trends but he could see a different big like aliens grinding on each other, a few scally aliens viving to the music, and space elfs of two of the most sci-fi shows twirling like its no tomorrow, all while a green anthro rabbit DJ is cranking out the noise. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel that I should know who that is,&quot; Izzy thought to himself as he passed by the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;like some evil force is causing you not to be able to call out the obvious&quot; the coyote added<br />
<br />
&quot;like you?&quot; Izzy accused<br />
<br />
&quot;o spirits no a stronger force is at work but I can&#39;t say for risk of bringing its wrath&quot; the coyote retorted.<br />
<br />
The next room the pair passed was the &quot;drone room&quot; if the sign was correct but unlike the robots on the con floor, big bucky with flashing lights and a 50s style, the robots or drones here were a lot more humanoid and featureless. one or two of them may be based on a robot you know or not most seem to be covered in thick latex suits in a style similar zentai. some of them even had numbers printed on their chest and strange lock icons on their groins. <br />
<br />
&quot;what kind of robots are they trying to be?&quot; Izzy asked to himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;the sex kind&quot; the Coyote answered for him, forgetting who was riding around in his head.<br />
<br />
Finally he makes it to a bar/loddy area that seemed to be converted into a tabletop RPG area...of a sexual nature naturally. Games like Starfinder, Traveller, Shadowrun and cyberpunk were heard from the tables as you see space dragons, goblins, and just some anthro fursuits of a cyberpunk nature. the pair spoted a sign at the bar labeled, &quot;party favor drop-offs&quot; where a barkeep in a cheap-looking purple naga costume was manning the bar.<br />
<br />
&quot;yes, I had some party good to drop off for entry proper.&quot; Izzy said pulling out the packs of condoms and drugs.<br />
<br />
the bar snake took a look over the goods and of Izzy and with a poorly done hissing accent &quot;yessss, thissss well do nicessssly, got to sssssaid nice Fursuit. maybe we can meet up later in the evening and we can smoke some of thisssss peace herb together.&quot; as the overweight snake-man poured the coyote man a drink unsatiated. thank the spirits Izzy have a good nose on him and could tell that it wasn&#39;t drugged but he could wash his hands more after his &quot;trouser snake breaks&quot; as the musk was getting to him.<br />
<br />
he grabbed the drink and thanked him for the drink he started to lap up with his tongue to the surprise of the barkeep who from the smell of things, found it arousing.<br />
<br />
&quot;we are not having sex with him&quot; Izzy yelled in his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;wasn&#39;t planning on it and faithfully I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;ll have a hard time moving on his own as a naga...if not right now&quot; the coyote spirit reasured as the two of you figured out what group to work on now.</p>
