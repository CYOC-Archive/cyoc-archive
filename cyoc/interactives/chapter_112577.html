<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Lineman/ quarterback, along with the rest of them begin to move into the next room the line and waddling the whole time out of breath ready to pass out from exhaustion. Another quarterback began laughing at him along with 3 other offensive and defensive lineman. &quot;Hey tubbies! Why don&#39;t you be useful and waddle towards the buffet where you belong!&quot; The lineman grouped around there new friend, helping him out, the one defensive lineman barking out &quot;without us you ass would be sacked every play! Show some respect man!&quot; The quarterback made a gesture like he was fat puffing his cheeks, saying &quot;ok big boy! I&#39;ll just waddle my way over to the next room!&quot; As he waddled he made sounds like a tuba was playing. &quot;Young man if you don&#39;t behave you&#39;ll be taught a lesson!&quot; Wilkson said to the mocking quarterback as they entered the new room. <br />
<br />
This room wasn&#39;t full of equipment like the others, instead there was a big vat of liquid, a large buffet, and pieces of what looked like rubber from large balloons that had broke. The lineman all waddled in, the 600 pound one being carried by the others. They all looked at the food displayed, which seemed to go on for the length of a football field. &quot;Bwahahahahaha! Look at you rhinos! The first thing you look at is food! Go waddle over and stuff your faces like the pigs you are!&quot; He said holding his stomach out again. Wilkson looked at him again, saying &quot;last warning young man or they&#39;ll teach you a lesson!&quot; He just shrugged his shoulders with a smile as he mocked behind them while they began to go eat. &quot;It&#39;s just like a buffalo heard!&quot; He said as he walked back and forth mocking there weight.<br />
<br />
Wilkson looked at the lineman, winked, and said  &quot;young man, you are rather smart, aren&#39;t you! I think your perfect for this next test! It&#39;s a new drink that makes you gain size, but lose weight at the same time!&quot; The quarterback looked around the room, then looked back at him saying &quot;why not! Long as these buffalo bellies don&#39;t gobble it up!&quot; And mockingly waddled over to him. &quot;This drink is condensed, I&#39;m afraid, but it&#39;s quite powerful! Just a sip will....&quot; and before he finished one of the lineman grabbed it and poored the whole bottle down his throat. &quot;This will teach your skinny ass to mock us!&quot; As the quarterback was forced to drink every drop. Chocking he blurted it &quot;you fat bastard! Why don&#39;t you shake the earth over by the buffet and leave me alone!&quot; All the lineman stood there waiting for something to happen, but nothing did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Wilkson looks like your drink don&#39;t work on me! Ha! I&#39;m gonna go over and grab some food before the others eat it all!&quot; And walked over to the beginning of the buffet. The other lineman joined suit, mostly waiting for a reaction. Before the last lineman left, Wilkson whispered into his ear that gave the lineman a smile bigger then his 600 pound body. Waddling over to the others he whispered the same thing. They all got around the quarterback, and one said &quot;since you wanna join us, let&#39;s make you part of the club!&quot; With a grab around the shoulder the lumbered him to the table as another brought a 2 gallon jug of water. Another brought a heaping pile of food, and they all chanted &quot;chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!&quot; As the quarterback gulped down the water.<br />
<br />
He polished it off in a second, surprised he was able to, as another gallon jug came around again. He began eating the plate, wolfing down the food fast, amazed at how hungry he&#39;d suddenly become. After he finished he chugged another gallon, then ate another two plates, then another 3 gallons. He burped loudly, walking over to the buffet, and the lineman began to laugh. The cloths the quarterback wore, seemed really tight on him, and he began to adjust as he brought another 3 jugs of water and 5 plates back again. The others noticed to, but they all began to dawn on why. <br />
<br />
As he ate and drank his body began to swell with muscle and fat. His once trim figure began to take on more of a heavier quarterback, maybe running back. His arms swelled, his legs gaining size along with his chest and back. His face and neck puffed out a little each time he swallowed a gulp. As all this was going on the lineman kept distracting him with more food and water. Soon he began to look more a linebackers size, and as he walked over to the buffet again he finally realized his pants buttons popped off! &quot;What&#39;s going on!?&quot; He cried finishing the water, the jug dropping to the turf floor. &quot;Well you see it only reacts with water, and for every gallon of it you gain about, hmm? I&#39;d say 100 pounds of size? But you&#39;ll actually lose 30 pounds of weight? Of course it was only meant to be drank as a thimble full, and that didn&#39;t end very well. As you can see by the mess around you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The quarterback panicked, but instead of running an insatiable appetite for more food and drink took over. His body swelled more and more as he walked over to the buffet, the lineman looking on laughing at him as he began to take there shape. Soon his gut hung over his waist, first a little, then like bread rising it cascaded past. He began to take on a waddle like them, his face and neck puffed out so much with size, you couldn&#39;t even tell where his  shoulders ended and neck began. Finally the lineman stopped him before he could eat anymore, but he still kept swelling. One of them yelled over &quot;hey wonka, how much can he take? Will he pop?&quot; &quot;The others did, I&#39;m afraid, but they were lineman like you, so if anything he&#39;ll out rival you in size and strength, but he&#39;ll be absolutely weightless!&quot; <br />
<br />
As he said this the quarterback now looking like  a true lineman began to take on a shine like rubber. He tried to waddle over to the food again, but the lineman stopped him with easier and easier restraint. Soon all the did was push him back with a finger as he reached with fat digits towards something to eat. &quot;Now your bigger then we are! Now you&#39;ll know what we go through!&quot; The quarterback/ 600 pound lineman said as the quarterback began to bounce off the ground like he was on the moon.  &quot;Wilkson, I&#39;m so hungry and thirsty, can you help me get more to eat?&quot; He said with a soft voice like a dog whimpering for a bone. &quot;I&#39;m sooo hungry, please give me more&quot; he cried moving his muscular arms up and down like a bird. His body now weightless as it floated up. &quot;Someone grabbed a string before he bumps the ceiling and pops!&quot; One of the players said, pointing to the sharp rafters above. They tied a rope around his ankle quick and pulled him down, Wilkson coming over to his now lineman balloon body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s see here, ha! His belly button! Of course!&quot; He said as the former quarter back tried to waddle and bounce in the air towards the water and buffet. &quot;See the plus side is his belly button is now a air hole, so we can deflate him. The down side is now he&#39;s stuck like this, except he won&#39;t be weightless.&quot; The others looked puzzled as he continued &quot;see he&#39;s going to gain back all his weight, plus new weight to compensate his new size. Permanent like our other friend here, but he&#39;ll be far bigger then any man, not to mention lineman, in the world. Let&#39;s see, ah yes! By the calculations I believe he&#39;ll be exactly 1,000 pounds. Oh my! Hell definitely be a slow walker! Better give him more food and drink to lighten him up! Not to much though or he will pop!&quot; The lineman let go of there new victim, as he waddled a few feet and puffed with exhaustion. He sat down, the others brining him more food and drink, and he swallowed down like a shovel crying for more as his now naked and cloths tattered body swelled to staggering new size. He began to waddle a little faster toward the buffet as the lineman blocked him. &quot;No......I want more food! I&#39;m so hungry for more.....&quot; he cried as the fellow lineman began to usher him into the next room, his body being shoved through the double doors with difficulty as the other moved forward.</p>
