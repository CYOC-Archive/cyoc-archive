<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">// Hi, sorry. Kinda lost the plot on this one, just trying to get this to some sort of conclusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;My turn to be the handler, I guess.&quot; John put on the wizard robe, feeling bliss as knowledge of the arcane arts flooded his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are the two of us doing?&quot; Scott said, feeling a wave of power wash through the room. Being a wizard yesterday taught him to feel magic, even though he didn&#39;t know any while he was like this. The robe was VERY powerful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know about you personally, but I&#39;d like to knock my boss down a peg or two. And I&#39;d like to transform into something, too.&quot; John stretched, looking over the costumes. &quot;You want the collar on you, puppy? Or are you fine for now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d like to keep my autonomy, yeah. What do you want to turn into? Is it safe to mix costumes?&quot; Scott crossed his arms looking down at the spread of costumes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s safe enough, yeah. And I can also just transform myself with my own magic. As to the matter of what to turn into…&quot; John focused his mind, trying to reach into Scott&#39;s. Scott felt the intrusion but couldn&#39;t do anything about it as his memories were being searched through.<br />
<br />
John opened his eyes, smiling. &quot;Something with big paws, and a nice dick. I actually wanted to try some alligator thing, for that whole lizard wizard pun, but I would love to please you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott blushed, but shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t reach into my head without my permission, alright? It doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, um… sure. Sorry.&quot; John muttered out. &quot;What&#39;d you want to turn into?&quot; He changed the subject, not wanting to linger on his violation of Scott&#39;s privacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, if we&#39;re trying to humiliate our boss, I&#39;d probably want to be something magical, too. I wanna be, like… a charismatic daddy-lookin figure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Human, or…&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tanuki. For them balls, yanno.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re such a furry.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This would require some work. John figured he should change himself first, which would be simpler. Pulling out a wand, he focused on the image of an athletic anthro hare as he pointed the wand at his feet. Immediately, they shot up with a sprouting noise as the feet turned into a set of brown, powerful, digitigrade hare paws, rest of the legs following suit as they bulked out. Scott had his eyes glued to the paws, blushing.<br />
<br />
<br />
John pointed the wand at his dick, the shaft turning into a sheathed blade, balls growing in size. Fur sprout all over John&#39;s legs, starting to climb up his body and onto the chest as the soft belly thinned into a hard set of abs. Moving the wand further up, he felt his pecs push out and his arms chisel out into a nice pair of guns. The fur started changing colour, patterns of splotches of white and black appearing between the sea of brown fluff. Pointing the wand at his head, he blinked and missed the whole transformation. His ears were standing on alert, catching all sorts of information. His nose was more precise, his face was pushed out into a muzzle, his teeth… he was a herbivore now. Flexing, he admired the handsome muscled hare body of his creation. And he KNEW that Scott was fully aroused, the smell of pre telling so much about him.<br />
<br />
He walked over to Scott, now standing a full 6&quot; taller than his friend, buck teeth shining as he smiled assertively. &quot;You look like such a tasty snack when I&#39;m like this, you know?&quot; He turned his head and kissed his boyfriend on the lips, pawed hand moving down to the shorter man&#39;s erection. &quot;You&#39;re SO small, so… weak…&quot; <br />
<br />
Scott couldn&#39;t say anything coherently as he was being felt up by his… HOT, sexy boyfriend. His wizard boyfriend. He relaxed his whole body, falling into the man&#39;s muscled form, the fur turning the hare&#39;s body into a perfect pillow. The two of them held each other for a few moments as John felt up Scott&#39;s butt. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d love to get naked for you, but I need the robe for magic.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you make it invisible?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a genius.&quot; John flicked his wand, rendering the robe invisible for the two of them. His 9&quot; sheathed cock stood on display, making Scott blush as his eyes traced the rest of the hare&#39;s chiseled form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time for you to get into costume too, right?&quot; John turned around, giving Scott a good show of his muscled butt, nubby tail hardly obscuring anything. He moved his hands over one of the costumes as it turned into a fursuit of a big tanuki, big in every sense of the word. &quot;Get in, cutie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s legs moved on autopilot, brain still focused on the handsome hare man&#39;s body. He took the chest of the fursuit, unzipping it and sliding into it. Looking down, he saw a pair of fluffy moobs and a sizable belly. The arms were pretty thick, too, looking balanced out between fat and muscle. He moved a hand down to the crotch, feeling up a big shaft and some big fluffy balls. They didn&#39;t feel like his, since he hadn&#39;t begun transforming yet. He put the feetpaws on, then the head, then the handpaws. John zipped him up as Scott felt dizzy for a moment.<br />
<br />
Scott&#39;s center of balance shifted suddenly as he stumbled on the floor. Opening his eyes, he saw the faux fur turn real as power (and fat) spread across his body. He was craving a snack, actually. He saw the room shrink as he grew out, towering a full foot over the hare once he finished transforming. He put his thick arms on his belly, feeling up its firm form… hah, he did look like a daddy. He pulled John in for a hug, squeezing his cute little form against the massive moobs, nuzzling the hare&#39;s ears with his new muzzle. John was strong, but he wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of this hold. The tanuki was much stronger.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So, am I charismatic yet? Is that part of the suit, Johnny?&quot; The tanuki&#39;s deep voice rumbled through the room, vibrations in his thick chest making John feel vulnerable next to the stronger man. Scott let the lagomorph escape his hold, crossing his arms under his moobs to make them stand out more. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, but you DO look very hot naked…&quot; John replied with awe in his voice. &quot;I&#39;m going to cast a spell on you to make everyone agree with whatever you say. That isn&#39;t charisma, I guess, but you can roleplay as if you&#39;re very charismatic. As a note, sometimes it might take multiple tries for someone to submit to you on something if you say something outrageous.&quot; John pulled out his wand and cast a little spell on the large tanuki in front of him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scott felt a surge of confidence. He didn&#39;t know if it worked for sure, though. What better way than to test it on the very man who cast the spell on him? He put an arm on his friend&#39;s shoulder, smiling as his deep voice took on a reassuring tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;You love paws, don&#39;t you, Johnny? That&#39;s why you turned into something with such majestic, delicious paws…&quot; <br />
<br />
John felt an effect similar to that of the collar burrowing itself into his mind. He DID love paws! They&#39;re quite supple...<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t care if you licked your own paws in front of me, John. You look like you really want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
It&#39;d be kind of pointless to say that John was erect. The two of them have been arousing each other the whole day. Casting a spell on himself to make his body more flexible, John sat down on the ground and moved his right foot into his face, the large footpaw covering his muzzle completely. The large fluffy toepads radiated a nice warmth and a familiar smell. The hare licked the paw, savoring the taste.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you want to mess with our boss? How are we getting to the workplace looking like this?&quot; The tanuki raised an arm in question as the hare slobbered his own paw, breaking him out of the state.<br />
<br />
&quot;We teleport.&quot; John said, wiping his mouth as he stood up. &quot;Also, I can make us look normal to everyone else. Or, well, suppress the part of their brains that makes them question whether or not this is weird.&quot; John raised his wand, a pulse of magic washing over the two of them.<br />
&quot;As an added bonus, we can both be naked without anyone thinking it&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! I&#39;d love to air my balls in that office, I find that their musk really turns other people on.&quot; He grinned, giving a wink to John.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t a sentence that would change anyone new they met, since they&#39;re not around to hear the words to be affected by the magic. John is, however. John began sniffing the air a little more, drawn to the amazing smell of his boyfriend&#39;s big balls. Worst of all, he wasn&#39;t noticing he was being played. Scott could say anything and John&#39;s mind would change to make it true.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, does the magic make our appearance and actions seem normal to everyone else?&quot; Scott said idly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, absolutely. Gives us a perfect chance to mess with the boss.&quot; John nodded.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Work&#39;s tomorrow, though. We&#39;ve got the day to ourselves. You feel like doing anything?&quot; John spoke a few moments later. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, not really. Just want to relax. I&#39;m probably going to watch some videos and jerk off a couple of times, maybe play some video games.&quot; Scott admitted shamelessly. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
<br />
John wasn&#39;t one to make eye contact. Scott knew this, so it wasn&#39;t weird to see the hare not quite meeting his gaze even as he looked in his direction. The tanuki did notice, however, that the wizard&#39;s eyes were glued to his crotch, a blush forming on his fluffy cheeks.<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I&#39;m probably going to do some chores with my magic, and then I&#39;ll hop on the computer, too.&quot; He spoke gently, trying to shake off the boner by flexing his arms, forcing the blood to move elsewhere. <br />
<br />
&quot;You look hot and bothered… cutie.&quot; Scott replied, mocking the way John acted before Scott put the costume on. The tanuki was the far more dominant of the two of them now, though, and he could get his boyfriend to do anything. No collar necessary. So, he could probably talk him into having sex… but it looked like John didn&#39;t want to, not completely. Consent was important, and manufacturing his friend&#39;s consent felt… weird. Obviously, if they did the same thing to their boss that would be completely fine. Their boss was a dick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, Scott, you turned out really hot. But there&#39;s things to do.&quot; The hare gave the tanuki a kiss on the cheek before turning around to start doing some chores, a bounce in his step.<br />
<br />
Scott decided that this was alright. He&#39;d test to see if the magic worked over the phone. Walking into the bedroom and squeezing himself into the creaking chair he waited for a scam call. He put on some videos to entertain himself in the meantime. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
John was cleaning the place left and right, the magic making it trivially easy to remove dust, stains, smells… he quickly washed up the dishes, then figured he should grab some groceries. Would be a good chance to see if his disguising enchantment worked. If it didn&#39;t, though, he probably shouldn&#39;t be out there naked… Everyone else could see the wizard robe, but there was nothing under it to hide his junk. Grabbing a jockstrap that was lying about, he slid into it, at first feeling a little uncomfortable but then relaxing as the jock&#39;s form adjusted. Wait, that&#39;s not what normal underwear does.<br />
<br />
Reaching down with his wand, he checked for enchantments on the jock. As suspected, it was a costume in it of itself. Checking for details, it seemed like it had a muscle enchantment and some mental changes attached. He didn&#39;t feel any more muscular, though. Checking himself out in the mirror, he was just as shredded as always. Big, wide shoulders, massive pecs, huge legs… thick arms… c-cute feet… He could knock any man down on the field, a thought pushed it&#39;s way into his mind.<br />
<br />
John was smart enough to realize that this wasn&#39;t the result of faulty magic. Whatever changed in him, it was because his brain was changed to make it normal. He should consult his boyfriend, he should be able to tell what&#39;s wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scott was in the middle of jerking himself off as he held his phone up to his mouth, whispering something to someone on the other side. Scott looked uncomfortable in that tiny chair. Pulling out his wand, John made the chair grow in size to accommodate the tanuki, then excused himself out of the room waiting for Scott to finish. It wasn&#39;t embarrassing to see a man naked, he&#39;d see plenty of those in the showers. None as attractive as his boyfriend, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scott noticed the chair changing, spreading his legs as he silently thanked his partner. Scott had an insurance salesman on the hook, turning the young man into a raging homosexual. By now, he convinced him to walk into the bathroom and jerk off. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sonny, something came up… you want to come, too, don&#39;t you?&quot; Daddy&#39;s sultry voice rumbled through the phone as Cole jerked himself off in the office bathroom. With a meek &quot;Y-yeah…&quot; he felt himself on the verge of orgasm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cum, slut.&quot; Cole quickly pulled his underwear over his cock as he came, balls emptying into his trunks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, dear, we need to do something about your occupation. You hate this job, don&#39;t you?&quot; Cole did. He ripped so many people off, mostly older people or single mothers. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah, daddy… it&#39;s just… I don&#39;t really see myself doing anything else at this point, you know?&quot; Cole admitted weakly. He wasn&#39;t very educated, having dropped out of highschool early. This was the only decently paying job he could get.<br />
<br />
&quot;You got any… nightclubs near you, Cole?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Uh, there&#39;s this one that&#39;s got this gay bar, I&#39;ve never really gone there but-.&quot; Cole was interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perfect! Listen, whatever job you can get there, it&#39;s going to be miles better than what you&#39;re doing right now, alright? You&#39;re going to see if they have vacancies open, and if they do, you&#39;re filling them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Cole found himself agreeing. He&#39;d have a better job, be in the community of his own people, and probably find some cute boys as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if it&#39;s like… embarrassing?&quot; Cole asked hesitantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Especially if it&#39;s embarrassing, son. Fuckin, stripper, pole dancer, if they&#39;ve got something horny like that you&#39;re going to apply to that first and foremost.&quot; Scott sounded eager, excited.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I wouldn&#39;t want to-.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck that quitter shit, Cole. You need to make something of yourself, alright? This ain&#39;t it. You love showing your body off, and you&#39;re happy to exercise to get your body into better shape. You&#39;d be a perfect fit at the bar.&quot; Daddy said aggressively.<br />
<br />
<br />
The words cracked whatever reservations Cole had. Yeah, he was a fucking exhibitionist. Yeah, he was kind of a twink, but he loved exercising and he&#39;d look hunky in no time. Whatever job he could get at the bar, he would. No questions asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A-alright, Daddy… uh… I-I think I need to go.&quot; Cole said, hearing someone enter the bathroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have a good day! Remember what I said.&quot; Scott stopped the call, leaning back into the chair as he continued to jerk off. Man, that felt cathartic. Rocking in the chair, he nearly punched himself in the face once he realized that he could&#39;ve kept on transforming the call center through Cole&#39;s phone. Well, whatever. One on one felt more intimate. He&#39;d get another call soon.<br />
<br />
Scott raised his voice to make himself heard by his adorable boyfriend. &quot;John, did you want something?&quot; <br />
<br />
John walked into the room giving Scott a nosebleed. Holy shit, John was shredded. Every muscle was, like, three times bigger. And the bulge on the jock was SO inviting, awakening some bottom instincts in the thick tanuki.<br />
<br />
&quot;John, a-are you here to give me a show, o-or was there something else?&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s brain reconfigured slightly, his intent changing. He smoothly got closer to Scott, his fluffy fingers running through his bulge as his other arm propped up his pecs. &quot;Well, maybe… but I put on this jockstrap, and I could tell that it has a bunch of enchantments on it that transformed me and then changed my mind so I wouldn&#39;t notice anything off. I was wondering if you could notice anything different?&quot; The muscular hare&#39;s shaft grew firmer as his nose picked up more and more of the tanuki&#39;s musk.<br />
<br />
Scott suppressed the urge to cum. He coughed into his elbow, rotating the wheelchair to face his hunk, keeping his legs spread as the footlong stood firm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I, uhh… you got a little shorter. And you used to be, like, deliciously toned, but now your muscles look like they belong to a star football player, not a wizard.&quot; Scott explained as the hare nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I… I see. I do remember playing a lot of football at college, yeah…&quot; John nodded as he looked at his muscles. He was really proud of those, yet to know they weren&#39;t earned was… eh, it didn&#39;t matter. He looked fucking hot. He turned around, flexing his arms as he gave his boyfriend a full show of his back. <br />
<br />
Blushing, the tanuki stroked himself a little bit faster. He didn&#39;t know what he wanted more - a piece of that ass, or of that cock…<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I should take the jock off, then. Who knows what other enchantments I have on it, could be dangerous.&quot; The hare said, sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-wait, n-no… at least let me take a picture first.&quot; Scott quickly shut his boyfriend down, reaching for a phone. <br />
<br />
John grinned, holding the pose until he heard the click of a camera. Turning around, he walked assertively towards the blushing tanuki, pulling down the front of his jock to unleash his white sheathed shaft. &quot;Want a front picture too, chubby?&quot; He closed his eyes, holding the base of his sheath in his hand as the other arm reached behind the back of his head. Waiting for a picture to get taken, he instead felt a muzzle wrapping around his cock. He gave a content moan as he grabbed the tanuki by the back of the head, beginning to gently slide his penis in and out. His other hand unstrapped his jock, letting it fall to the floor, then came to hold the back of the cocksucker&#39;s head as well. <br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for either of them to cum. Finishing inside the tanuki, John felt himself growing taller as his muscles shrank to their original size, a fog lifting as the spells receded from him. The experience of being a sexy jock did feel incredible. He could get so much ass with that body… still, it was risky unless he knew exactly what the mental enchantments affected. He ruffled his boyfriend&#39;s hair before jumping down onto the bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;ll just get the groceries delivered. You want anything?&quot; John said casually, ignoring that the tanuki just sucked him off. He reached into his invisible robe and pulled out a phone looking for the delivery app.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we have takeout as well? I feel kinda hungry…&quot; Scott said, wiping off his mouth from the semen.<br />
<br />
Ordering some Thai and groceries, the two of them happily spent the rest of the day together. They watched movies, pranked some scam callers, engaged in some casual sex, enjoyed some food… the two of them had a nice, sweet day.</p>
