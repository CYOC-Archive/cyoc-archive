<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“What were things like before you came here, Principal Calderon?”<br />
<br />
Principal Calderon paused, a distant smiled formed on his ruggedly handsome face.&#8232;&#8232;“Ahh,” He sighed, almost longingly.&#8232;&#8232;“College, those were the days, you know, in my freshman year I was on my way to being state champ in wrestling… Even was a letterman in football, had a few scholarship offers and all, but well… I realized I had a different goal in mind.”<br />
<br />
“Oh?” Doug prodded, hoping that his gamble would pay off.<br />
<br />
Principal Calderon smirked at Doug and raised an arm. He flexed, a decent shaped bicep poked through his suit as he clapped a rugged hand on the mass.<br />
<br />
“Bodybuilding, went pretty far too. Tore my rotator cuff and since then, shoulder never healed up right.”<br />
<br />
With that, Principal Calderon shook himself from his musings, looking back at the pair of teens.<br />
<br />
“However, that is neither here nor there, Mr. Savage. You and your girlfriend are still receiving detention.”<br />
<br />
“Ah but Principal Calderon, it’s so riveting to hear this side of you! Wouldn’t you had liked to retry exercising and reaching your dreams?” Nancy added, quickly. It dawned on Doug what was going on.<br />
<br />
The principal shrugged and smiled softly.<br />
<br />
“Who doesn’t want to be young and caught by their principal?” Calderon smirked, before shaking his head and continuing.<br />
&#8232;“You two don’t realize how good you have it, now no more dilly dallying and go back to class.”<br />
<br />
Doug smirked, grasping the coin as he realized the potential.<br />
&#8232;“Alright Principal Calderon,” Doug said, “Though I really do wish you had a chance to follow your dreams to be a bodybuilder.”<br />
<br />
Nancy’s eyes raised as the coin glowed in Doug’s hands. The wish he’d made was a success, but now was the time to see how it’d be fulfilled.<br />
<br />
Unlike the two teenagers, Luis appeared to freeze in place as a ripple spread throughout the office.<br />
&#8232;Doug and Nancy stifled a gasp as the changes began, gray hairs being slowly replaced by thicker dark hair. Calderon’s already rugged face was becoming sharper, more bright as he retreated in age gracefully. His jawline thickened, as he went from his early forties to his late thirties. <br />
<br />
The two gawped as Luis’ body swelled, becoming bulkier and firmer, even despite the injury from his younger days, Luis Calderon had maintained his physical fitness better than most men.<br />
<br />
Pecs bulged comically as they strained against the suit jacket and dress shirt, tears formed around the corners of the shoulders as Calderon’s lats extended outwards. His delts became wider, body still frozen despite reality warping around him. Calderon rose slightly, as his glutes became the cushion on his seat, round and firm, while his legs thickened considerably, to the point both teens blushing seeing the tear in his pant legs.<br />
<br />
Luis had bulked up exponentially, looking wider than his own door frame as his face, still frozen, was touched up. His goatee was groomed, a slight chinstrap beard making its way innocently across his mug… Before connecting and creating a rather dignified look overall.<br />
<br />
Calderon settled at the age of 36 just as his clothing began to change slightly in order to fit the new reality. His dress shirt, plain white, tinged pink, then a deep maroon. The pecs still strained the shirt as the previously cheap cotton changed to a silky look. His business jacket quickly was rewoven from a twill like material to silk as well, pinstripe for that matter. Doug watched as Calderon’s bow-tie undid itself, snaking around his neck and becoming a dress tie that perfectly encapsulated his bull like neck, his Adam apple jutting out ever so slightly.<br />
<br />
The office shifted once again, and Nancy turned around while Doug was still fixated on the changing man and realized that there was now a new glass shelve that housed trophies. Big, large, gold trophies and medals.<br />
<br />
She paused, drawn to seeing what the trophies were, as the gold began to coalesce at the tops and form a blob. Nancy’s eyes widened as the blobs rose up like wax figures, first formless and then humanoid, before defining themselves. <br />
<br />
They became tiny people, or at least, what seemed like people, before smiles were etched onto their faces. Much like Calderon, growing in stature and size before they posed, hair threaded onto the gold. Nancy realized exactly what they were: Bodybuilding trophies, the formless masses were becoming musclemen flexing in posers with comedically large bulges. One in particular stood out to her, seemingly very much akin to Calderon now as she looked back to see Calderon’s hair slick back and the trophy morphing to suit its muse.<br />
<br />
“Luis Calderon, 2023 IFBB Arnold Classic” Read the name on the plaque that was being etched right in front of her. &quot;267 pounds, 6 feet, 4 inches.&quot; Was his official stats.<br />
<br />
Doug, meanwhile, was entranced seeing the upgrades Calderon was going through, almost dejectedly sighing as the changes were beginning to halt. In a sense, he could feel himself yearning for the days he was older… Calderon had quickly become a behemoth, breathing even just a tiny bit of air caused his shirt to strain, something Doug could tell the principal enjoyed when he rolled up his sleeves or needed to intimidate freshmen into knowing he meant business.<br />
<br />
Reality seemed to get a grip on itself as the office ceased to ripple, the musclemen trophies freezing in place as the office ultimately became slightly more modern. <br />
<br />
Doug and Nancy’s memories came to focus as they recalled Luis was a bodybuilding pro that recently became the principal due to his intense focus on healthy lifestyles and its connection to learning. With a larger focus on the physical side of school, Doug remembered that he had made something of a bond with Calderon, who had emphasized to him the importance of academic scholarships and sports.<br />
<br />
Time caught up to Calderon as he blinked and quickly shook himself out of his stupor.<br />
&#8232;Noticing Nancy was still gawking at the trophy display case, the principal made a curt gesture.<br />
<br />
“Ahem.”<br />
<br />
&#8232;Spooked, Nancy made a small sound before skipping back next to Doug, who was sharing her confused expression.&#8232;<br />
<br />
“Yes, I know it <I>is</I> rather hard to think a principal has a life outside school, however, both of you I’m sure understand that <I>some</I> interests are best left away from school?” Calderon stated, voice now slightly deeper due to the changes.<br />
<br />
Doug and Nancy gulped, nodding their heads as they slowly came to grips on reality changing so much.<br />
<br />
“Wonderful, now that we have an understanding, I’d like you both to return to class, remember, we all have time to enjoy ourselves, but there’s a time and place for everything.” Luis smiled, wiggling his eyebrows.<br />
<br />
Doug was relieved the despite the changes, Luis still remained somewhat cool and laid back, even if he looked like he was larger than most high school seniors put together and then some.<br />
<br />
Nancy rubbed her arm sheepishly, feigning regret.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir, we’ll be sure to not to do this again, right, Doug?” She said, looking at Doug.<br />
&#8232;Still processing, Doug nodded.<br />
<br />
“Er… Yeah, scout’s honor.” He replied.<br />
<br />
Calderon mused and sat back down on his chair, pulling up some papers.<br />
<br />
“That will be all then, we’ll talk again once you both finish detention.”&#8232;&#8232;And with that, they filed out of the principal’s office, before Calderon’s secretary bumped into Doug as she entered the room.<br />
<br />
“Oh, pardon me kids,” Mrs. Oldenburg said, speed walking to Calderon’s desk and spreading out some files.<br />
<br />
“Principal Calderon, here are the teacher applications for this upcoming semester…” She replied.<br />
<br />
Doug almost felt the petty idea to use the coin on Oldenburg, but was caught up in being thrown off by her sudden entrance, he hadn’t.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, Janice, this is just what I need.” Calderon stated, before noticing Doug still in a stupor. “Mr. Savage, I believe I did remind you about returning to class…?”&#8232;<br />
<br />
“Right, sorry, yeah.” Doug shook off his thoughts and followed Nancy out the room.<br />
<br />
Nancy was already walking down the hall as Doug caught up to her.<br />
<br />
“Well, that was close,” Doug stated, nonchalantly.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, to think he wasn’t even here before we became younger…” Nancy noted, still woozy from the changes.<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t that kinda scare you?” Doug said, thoughtful.<br />
<br />
“A little bit. I still remember things, like, the old me. And I remember the new me. The new Calderon. It’s a little much right now.” Nancy said, holding herself.<br />
<br />
&#8232;Doug couldn’t help but agree, it did feel a bit strange…<br />
<br />
And yet…</p>
