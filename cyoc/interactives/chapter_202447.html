<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I&#39;ve decided your first punishment.&quot; the man had finished his shower, made and eaten breakfast, and was now drinking coffee and reading the newspaper while enjoying a pipe on the front porch. He took Jeff off the rope necklace and carelessly tossed him on the ground, Jeff bounced harmlessly as if made of plastic. &quot;Man up, boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could suddenly move and brought himself to a standing position but the world around him rapidly shrank as he soon became a full grown man.<br />
<br />
&quot;First things first,&quot; the man started without taking his eyes off the paper. &quot;You tricked me into not getting a new pipe and that simply cannot stand. You wanted to be used and so, use you I shall. You&#39;ll be doing the errand of taking my truck into town, finding me a good pipe, buying it, and bringing it back.&quot; Jeff tried to speak but couldn&#39;t so he gestured. The man glanced over at Jeff with a sigh, &quot;Speak up boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This sounds great, I want to repay you for accidentally messing up your life. Woah, is that my voice now? Anyway, I&#39;ve never driven a truck before and haven&#39;t gotten my driver&#39;s license. Also, what do you look for in a pipe? I want to get you one you&#39;d like, but haven&#39;t used one before so I have no idea what makes one good or bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kids these days don&#39;t know nothin.&quot; The man scoffed setting down his newspaper. &quot;You think I don&#39;t know what you need? You think I&#39;d find you impersonating my property and not look through every bit of information I can get on you? What kind of idiot do you take me for boy? Be quiet.&quot; Jeff tried to apologize but was struck mute once again.<br />
<br />
The man lumbered inside taking the last few gulps of his coffee. Jeff followed realizing how foolish he&#39;d been and hadn&#39;t meant to insult the old man. &quot;Sit.&quot; the man pointed to the couch and set down his pipe in an ashtray as he went to his bedroom.<br />
<br />
Jeff sat there silently as the minutes passed. He could hear the man typing and occasionally grunting as he found things... Jeff felt warm all of a sudden and realized he was wearing jeans and a green flannel shirt with rolled up sleeves showing his hairy and muscular forearms, shifting he found a wallet and wristwatch but alas, a cellphone did not materialize, not that he had anyone to call who would recognize him as a very muscular 20 something year old. <br />
<br />
The retiree was enjoying his new playthings, Jeff and the Chronivac. He retired early for a reason, and that was to get some peace and quiet. He hated questions, especially ones that could be answered with a tiny bit of thought. Clothing Jeff was easy, as was giving Jeff driving skills, and a fat wallet to make the purchase. Though Jeff hasn&#39;t noticed yet, he was now aged to 42 and sported a short beard which was filled with gray. That should keep him from getting carded. But Jeff did have a point about what Jeff should purchase... The man opened his profile and found his own traits, &quot;I wish I could just...&quot; The man found he could simply drag and drop his traits over to Jeff, no need to waste time explaining the sensations or preferences he had... In the click of the submit button Jeff suddenly had all the habits, triggers, and addiction the old man had.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a warmth wash over him again and though bored was honestly just glad to be human again... this isn&#39;t anything like what he hoped would happen but the alternative would be English Lit. class. He noticed the pipe sitting in the ashtray which was suddenly as familiar to him as his cell phone used to be and absentmindedly grabbed, emptied, refilled, and lit it as doing so was now second nature.<br />
<br />
The old man combed over Jeff&#39;s modifications ticking off the mental checkboxes making sure he had put everything in place. He stood and returned to the living room to find Jeff patiently waiting and smoking his pipe. &quot;Let&#39;s get a look at you.&quot; Jeff stood and twirled with arms out stretched and and as soon as he came to face the man again the pipe fell back into his mouth... &quot;It looks like you might make a decent man yet. Good boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man didn&#39;t mean to give Jeff the trigger word, he was just earnestly pleased with the transformation and how well Jeff took to it, and it slipped out of his mouth. Jeff immediately began bucking his hips as his body began a chemical cascade in his brain. He roared silently as an orgasm triggered which didn&#39;t culminate in ejaculation, feeling relieved but somehow even more pent up than before. Jeff collapsed backwards with a heavy thud onto the couch and took a deep drag from his pipe.<br />
<br />
The man walked past with a smile, feeling the immense power that even his idle comments held, &quot;I think you&#39;re ready. Boy, pick up a pipe you&#39;d like and come straight back, you can talk when you&#39;re off the property.&quot; The man threw the truck keys at Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff got into the truck and like the old man, wouldn&#39;t dream of going into town without having a smoke. Jeff began adjusting the mirrors seeing for the first time he was now almost his father&#39;s age, going gray, and had a lit pipe in his mouth. Despite his shock and desire to examine this further he was under command and his body took over using his newly begotten driving skills to take him to town safely. The only control Jeff had in the situation was how often to puff on the pipe, but in reality, it was how much more he would smoke. Driving was a trigger and the habit was to smoke the whole way to town. Jeff would take the pipe out of his mouth but find it back in his mouth by the next curve in the road. Every time he looked in the rear view mirror he saw it hanging out of his mouth, would take it out, but it would find its way back in.</p>
