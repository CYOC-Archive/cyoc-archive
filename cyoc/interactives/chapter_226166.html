<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You wake up hoping nothing too extreme has happened to you. At first, everything seems normal. Your room is still your room. Your bed sheets are still the same, as well as the pajamas you wore last night. If anything, you would believe the whole thing had been a joke.<br />
<br />
You raised, going to your mirror. The same old you looked at you, with a confused expression. The same hair, the same handsome face. Everything looked the same. Your shoulders, your arms, your pecs against your shirt. You took it off. You were glad you still had your muscles. After all, they had taken too much effort to just be lost while you slept. <br />
<br />
Then you realized there were differences. Your butt was bigger and rounder, as if it had more fat than before. Which was one good change, a bit boring perhaps, but good. It was, maybe, a bit too big to what you would have expected to look good on you, but you couldn&#39;t complain.<br />
<br />
You descended your hand to look for your cock, and then the other difference introduced itself: there was no cock to be found. Quickly you got rid of your pants, scared of what you may find between your legs.<br />
<br />
A pussy. You had a pussy now. Your entire body still look as masculine as the day before, except for your new pussy. And perhaps your butt. Maybe your hips were also wider.<br />
<br />
You wondered, for a moment, what could this mean. You took your phone, still the same as always, and looked up vagina. Now, instead of being attached to a woman, they were part of a man. With some quick searches, you confirmed that you now lived in a world where men had vaginas, and women had dicks.<br />
<br />
You sat on your bed, not knowing what you were going to do. The whole situation was scary, sure, but also hotter than anything you had ever imagined. You looked at your new sex. Your pubes looked the same still, far bushier than what you would have liked in a woman, but you did not want to get rid of them. You tried, hesitant, to touch your new organs. Slowly, you touched the crevice you now had between your legs.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, you shivered. Your finger had found your clit. You now had a clit. You missed your cock, but the simple contact between your index and your clit had made you considered that perhaps this was not as bad as you may have feared.<br />
<br />
You decided to wait before exploring your cunt. You wanted to confirm exactly what had changed in your life, or at least learn as much as you could on your own. You stood up once again, and quickly went to your dresser. Most clothes were the same you always used. Only the underwear was different. Instead of your usual boxer briefs, what you found were things closer to the panties you had seen models and your girlfriend use. Only that they were far less decorated. No ribbons, no flowers could be found. Most of them were the same colours as your usual underwear, and very few had some patterns. Other than they were very obviously designed for a person without a penis, you could have mistaken it for male underwear.<br />
<br />
You also found products for your period. Unlike in your world, the packaging was now black and blue, and had some weird slogan about feeling secure in your masculinity or something. Apparently, at least for what aesthetics were concerned, gender roles were the same between your original world and this one.<br />
<br />
Of course, you had to wonder now how did gender roles worked in this universe. You now were the one who would get pregnant, and carry a child. Maybe you were carrying one tight now, for all you knew. How did society evolve in this world? Was there still a patriarchy? And if so, how did it work?<br />
<br />
You, of course, had no answer for these questions. But before you were able to try to come with a possible answer on your own, you received a notification.<br />
<br />
Your girlfriend had sent a message. You opened it, and a photo of a dick shocked you. Under it, your girlfriend had wrote she had awaken thinking about you, and could not wait for today.<br />
<br />
It was impossible to determine how big she was based on the photo. The angle clearly was chosen to make it look bigger, but anything that could work as a reference for size was rather unclear.<br />
<br />
Right, you remembered, while trying to understand what she meant with her message. Today you were going to have sex for the first time. Until yesterday, the most you had done were receiving a blowjob or go down on her pussy. But mostly you sent photos and written lewd messages. Today was the moment for the next step.<br />
<br />
And instead of finally railing her, the one getting railed was going to be you.<br />
<br />
You gulped, yet you had to admit you were excited at the prospect. The idea of your small dainty girlfriend fucking you, a big fit guy, had made you wet. Wet instead of hard. How weird if felt! But you probably had to get used to it now.<br />
<br />
You almost thought of telling her to come now. But you considered your options. Perhaps it was better to explore your pussy on your own before being fucked. Just a thought. Maybe you could try to explore this brave new world, and see how people were different from your previous universe.</p>
