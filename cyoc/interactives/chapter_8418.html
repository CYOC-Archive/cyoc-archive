<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Felix Tal pulled into the car park, we recognised Richard’s 4x4 and the standard black Caddy of the FBM. He sighed, for all his trouble it looked like Cosgrove would be here. He swore lightly and got out of his hired car. He could mask himself, but what would be the point, he was here to buy some friends some dinner. Tal walked up to the entrance. He noted the Ward and slipped though it without registering. The Greeter stepped forward <br />
“Hello” Tal said. The Greeter smiled slightly<br />
“Do you have a reservation sir?” he asked <br />
“I am with Richards’s party” Tal said looking around for them. He spotted Tim at the High Table. <br />
“Ah, Mr. Tal, yes sir.” The Greeter looked round and a waiter approached. “Chi, take Mr. Felix to the High Table please” Chi lend off across the restaurant. Tal could feel eyes on his back and at least one assessing spell. He shrugged that off easy. Chi moved to take him directly to the table, but Tal stopped and place his palm on the trunk of the oak- the Earth magic was strong here……Tal took a deep breath and let the natural energy flow though him. Hum……..<br />
“Sir?” Chi’s slight accent jerked him out of his relaxation.<br />
“Sorry” he muttered “I like trees” he added weakly. The waiter smiled like he heard it all the time. Chi started walking to the table again. Tal beamed at all the familiar faces at the table. As he took his seat Tim spoke up<br />
“Can I introduce Felix Tal to you all, he’s been a part of a major turning point in mine and Kelvin's lives”<br />
“Do you prefer Felix or Tal?” Ruby asked. <br />
“Either really” Tal said smiling. Chi came back and took a beer order from Tal and a fresh round for everyone else.<br />
“So are you responsible for turning Tim and Kelvin into Shifters?” Manoesk said bluntly. Richard nearly spurted his drink across the table, Ruby turned bright red, Tim paused about to take a slip, and Kelvin chuckled. Tal inclined his head at the young man.<br />
“What makes you think that?” he said doing a quick Assessment of the young Shifter.<br />
“Deduction” he answered, aware all eyes where on him. “I have visited the yard before and I know Tim was never quite *this* large before, also his teeth have got pointed like mine and Dad’s. Also you touched the tree on the way in and rolled your eyes- the only people I have seen do that are those who have some power. So a magical stranger suddenly turns up and gets a glowing review from Tim, who has suddenly become a Shifter; deduction is you have something to do with the change” He took a sip of his drink and smiled at Tal. <br />
“Smart man” Tal said. “I will not lie to you. Yes I did have something to do with it. I toast your skills” He raised his glass to Manoesk who smiled a fanged grin back. <br />
“Are we that obvious?” Kelvin said concerned.<br />
“Not in the slightest” Richard said “if I had not known what to look for, you would simply be a big burly dude”<br />
“Or a big gay Bear” Henry piped up. Tim’s head whipped round to the 16 year old slipping his coke trying to look innocent. Kelvin burst out laughing. <br />
“You been surfing the net again bro?” Manoesk asked.<br />
“Something like that…..some of the guys at school where er…discussing it” a blush was spreading up the young mans face; however the tension had been broken. <br />
“Told you it was the shirts guys” Richard said with a laugh setting Kelvin’s mirth off again. <br />
“It was all that was clean!” Tim said. Ruby looked him in the eyes<br />
“Really?” she said with a grin. There was general laughter around the table. <br />
<br />
The party made small talk until Chi came over.<br />
“Ladies and gentlemen, may I present your starters” he said with a slight bow. Tal looked confused. <br />
“Bro is sorting up something special” Richard said to him. Tal raised his eyebrows but said nothing. Chi went back to the kitchen then propped open the door. Several other tables where turning to look. A trolley came out of the kitchen pushed by a lady of about 20 dressed as a chef, followed by a larger man who bore a strong resemblance to Richard apart from the sliver hair. The trolley was dominated by a huge dome platter covering. The young lady wheeled it over and stood at attention at the end of the High Table, with great ceremony she lifted off the lid to reveal what appeared to be a scale model of the Junk yard!<br />
“Wow” Rudy breathed. “Sliver you have outdone your self this time!”<br />
“No thanks to me” Sliver rumbled in a surprisingly deep voice, given he was not as big as his brother. “This young lady came up with the idea. Sandy Harper say hello to the family and a few friends!” he smiled wide and happy at the party.<br />
“Hi” Sandy said. “er…..enjoy!” with that she stepped back and quickly retreated to the kitchen. <br />
“All of it is edible, so I’ll leave you to it. Enjoy!” Sliver followed his chef. Richard and Ruby exchanged glances but said nothing. Chi lifted the platter off the trolley and placed it in the middle of the table. It smelt good, and Richard tentatively lifted off a roof tile from the house. He smiled and nodded before they all dived in. <br />
<br />
Agent Cosgrove watched the party at the top table dive into the strange starter, then into a massive streak dinner afterwards. His own team where also having streak, but the 3 Agent team was on the standard menu. Cosgrove had attempted to Assess Tal as he had come in but the man’s wards were simply too strong. The younger Shifter at the table, had quite a bit of potential power- Cosgrove got Agent Keswick to make a note to follow up on the family’s history. <br />
<br />
Cosgrove was waiting for an opportunity and he got it. Tal got up to go to the toilet. Cosgrove followed. Now he had a chance to pay him back! He almost lost control of his form as he walked to the bathroom, the Bear wanted his claws out! <br />
<br />
Tal heard the bathroom door open and did not need to look round from the urinal to know who had just come in, he could smell the hate and power from where he was. Cosgrove stood and waited for Tal to finish- he had something to say to his man and boy was he going to hear it!</p>
