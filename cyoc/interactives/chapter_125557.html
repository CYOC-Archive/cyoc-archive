<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Isaac felt responsible. Ever since he saw the smoke coming from the  town, he had been uncharacteristically selfish, reckless and hotheaded. If he hadn&#39;t distracted Nat and her magic club with his desire to find Nathan, then they would already be defending the town. Isaac knows from experience that every second counts in battle. Nat and her followers might already too late to save the town. The least he can do is to help lower those odds.  <br />
<br />
With his mind temporarily clear of distractions, he began running as fast as he can towards the battle.<br />
<br />
Ilivir and Mary kept pace with him.<br />
<br />
Mary tried one last attempt to dissuade Isaac. &quot;Isaac! The king&#39;s men will see us! This is just one town over many! If we lose the element of surprise, then the whole cloud kingdom will fall!&quot;<br />
<br />
Isaac couldn&#39;t believe what he was hearing. &quot;You&#39;d rather have you&#39;re childhood friend&#39;s home town get destroyed?! I guess I was wrong... You&#39;re nothing like me!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary looked taken aback for a moment before responding. &quot;Fine! But if the king&#39;s men finds out that I&#39;m here, then my village will be their next target! I&#39;ll be waiting outside of town. Don&#39;t let yourself be seen!&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that said, she ran off into the distance. Isaac couldn&#39;t help but notice Marry&#39;s guilt stricken face as she fled. Isaac and Ilvir were alone as they entered the battle field.<br />
<br />
The Battle field was in chaos. Members of the Magic club were firing novice magic, the villagers and king&#39;s men were using gun like projectile weapons and the rumored air dragon was nowhere to be seen. Amidst all the fighting, Nat was nowhere to be seen and Ilvir was quickly lost within the blur of battle. Isaac was alone.<br />
<br />
If Isaac knew what a gun was, then he would have called this a western gun fight. The villagers were firing their gun-like weapons behind a barricade from one side and the king&#39;s men were firing from behind another barricade from the other side. Instead of human guns, they were using weapons known as Air Razors. They are basically the cloud plane version of hand guns. Air Razor shoots highly compressed rounds of air that can pierce through all sorts of things.<br />
<br />
Of course, since Isaac doesn&#39;t know this, he blindly charged at the king&#39;s men, air razors shots blazing. <br />
<br />
Isaac&#39;s skin might have been pierced a little but Isaac was able to regenerate enough to break through the men&#39;s barricade and knock them out.<br />
<br />
As the ruble settled, Isaac scaned the the battle scene before him. Magic ice and fire balls and air bullets was flung everywhere as Magic users, Villagers, and the King&#39;s goons alike were die left and right.<br />
<br />
But before Isaac could rejoin Ilivir in the fight, the King&#39;s men began retreating. Once the town was cleared of goons, the surviving townsfolk started  cheering.<br />
<br />
That was was until they heard a load *ROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR*<br />
<br />
Silence descended upon the town as the elusive air dragon touched down right in front of Isaac.<br />
<br />
The air dragon looks exactly like the dragons from the books of legend back home. Except this dragon was completely made out of transparent air. It&#39;s a dragon completely made out of air. The only reason Isaac was able to see was because of the low amount of water vapor getting sucked into the dragon&#39;s  body of swirling air currents.<br />
<br />
The dragon tried breathing out razor sharp air breath at Isaac but he quickly dodged. He then countered with his own icy fire breath. <br />
<br />
The breath hit but it only made the dragon stagger. The dragon counters with it&#39;s wind claws.<br />
<br />
Thinking fast, Isaac blocked the claws with his enchanted dagger.<br />
<br />
 He got it now. So as long as the dragon is touching the blade, then it&#39;s corruption will eventually be adsorbed into Isaac. <br />
<br />
Isaac got more then was he expecting when the dragon began flowing into the dagger like a tidal wave.<br />
<br />
It seemed the enchanted dagger was sucking up the dragon&#39;s body like a vacuum but... something was wrong...<br />
<br />
The air dragon was being adsorbed into one specific small crack on the dagger. Isaac didn&#39;t noticed the crack on the dagger&#39;s blade until now because of how small and unnoticeable it was. Isaac doesn&#39;t know how old the dagger is, so it&#39;s safe to assume that crack formed over time. Yet the crack seems to be expanding in the matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
Isaac realized what was happening at the last moment. The dragon has compressed its air composed body into a impossible size and squeezed itself into the small crack. Before it could get adsorbed, it expanded itself and forced the crack to expand. By the time Isaac realized this, the crack has gained enough air pressure and his enchanted blade broke cleanly in half. One half has the handle and the other half has most of the blade.<br />
<br />
Isaac quickly picked the two halves of his broken dagger as the air dragon went to swipe Isaac again.<br />
<br />
As he evaded the incoming attacks, his mind was racing. He&#39;s gotta think of something quick until... wait... his small blade is made of enchanted metal and his possessed armor can assassinate metal...<br />
<br />
So Isaac did just that. He placed the broken dagger against his armor plates and the armor did the rest. As soon as the armor finished assimilating the dagger, it started changing shape. Spikes began protruding off of Isaac&#39;s armor. When it finished reforming Isaac gained spiked shoulder pads, spiked knee pads, spiked boots and spiked gauntlets. His armor also turned into a pitch black color. Isaac&#39;s choker of purity also began glowing white with the energy of purity. The choker started expanding and loosening up until it became a floating halo around his neck. Isaac also noticed that his glowing halo of purity was absorbing light and purity while his black armor was absorbing corrupted darkness.<br />
<br />
While Isaac&#39;s armor was reforming, the air dragon took the opportunity to slash at Isaac. It was a direct hit. However, instead of damaging the armor or hurting Isaac, the compressed air from the attack was absorbed into the armor.  The air dragon realized this and began backing away. <br />
<br />
Isaac grinned from this new development. So his armor can now absorb whatever corrupted essence it touches huh?...<br />
<br />
Isaac charged at the air dragon, his black gauntlets raised high. The Air Dragon screeched in pain as Isaac began punching the dragon relentlessly. Isaac was finally able to seriously hurt this untouchable dragon!<br />
<br />
But as the air dragon finally seemed to be getting absorbed into Isaac&#39;s armor, a intelligent glint gleamed in it&#39;s eyes as the armor started to suck the air dragon into itself. Once the air dragon was fully sucked into Isaac&#39;s armor, he began to feel light. Yet, he doesn&#39;t feel any different...<br />
<br />
Something was wrong.<br />
<br />
After a few seconds of silence, Isaac&#39;s armor began to budge. His body underneath the armor was also bulging. It was as if Isaac was being blown up by a nonexistent air pump!<br />
<br />
Idiot! Isaac should have realized that the air dragon would pull the same trick twice. This creature seems a lot more intelligent then it looks. It seems to think outside the box and use its abilities in creative ways reminds Isaac a lot like Nathan&#39;s fighting style... either way, it seems the dragon has somehow avoided touching Isaac&#39;s possessed armor by seeping through the cracks in the armor and invaded Isaac&#39;s body instead. As Isaac&#39;s mind race for an solution out of this predicament, he body is being blown up by the air dragon&#39;s body as it expands itself in his own body!...<br />
<br />
...Isaac let at laugh that rivals that of a berserker&#39;s. If only the dragon knew his enchanted armor wasn&#39;t the only thing that can assimilate living things. The ice, fire, granite and vines within Isaac&#39;s impossible body began crushing down on the air the makes up the dragon&#39;s body. Isaac can already feel some of the dragon&#39;s body being absorbed into himself. Some of the dragon&#39;s assimilated air was already becoming a part of his body!<br />
<br />
<br />
While Isaac was absorbing the dragon within himself, it felt like the dragon&#39;s air was invading his head! &quot;Save me Isaac!&quot; Huh? Did Isaac just heard the dragon&#39;s thoughts? It sounded familiar... Almost like Nathan&#39;s voice...<br />
<br />
That brief moment caused Isaac to hesitate and give the air dragon the opportunity it needs to counterattack. The Air dragon started expanding so fast and so strongly, that before Isaac can assimilate it, his body literally blew up!<br />
<br />
Shreds of plant, scales, fur, granite, air and ice was flying all over the place as the Air dragon was left standing.<br />
<br />
Isaac was nowhere to be seen.</p>
