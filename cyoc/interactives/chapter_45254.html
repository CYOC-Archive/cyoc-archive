<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jason...or as his sister was calling him at the moment, Erika...sat at the table in the crowded mall, torn between being comfortable with the situation he was in and being completely out of sorts.<br />
<br />
When his sister, Vicky, had discovered him it had taken Jason a half an hour to explain things, including the fact that he didn't have a penis and testicles anymore and he wasn't wearing some type of prosthetic over his genitals.<br />
<br />
After that it was another half hour trying to convince Vicky that he couldn't tell her at the moment how this change had occurred and then another fifteen minutes to convince her not to tell their mom that he wore he clothes sometimes and right now did not have the equipment normal for boy. After that Vicky grew real quiet and sat on her bed. After a moment she told him that she would keep quiet on the whole thing if he would do somethings with her.<br />
<br />
Hesitant, he had opened his mouth and asked what those things were. Grinning, she stood and telling him, &quot;You are rather androgynous looking for a boy,&quot; and began to go through her dresser.<br />
<br />
Pulling out a two piece swimsuit, Vicky told him, &quot;We're going swimming at the public pool and you are going to wear this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jason looked horrified and immediately told her, &quot;No way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky grinned, dropped the swimsuit and said, &quot;Fine. You can explain to mom why you dress in my clothes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sputtering, trying to see a way out this, Jason heaved a sigh and removed the yellow underwear and moving to the bed, he picked up the lower half of the bikini and asked, &quot;How does this go on?&quot;<br />
<br />
After dressing in his sister's swimwear, gazing in the mirror, Jason realised that he looked even more like a girl with the bikini on. Why he looked at himself, Vicky rummaged through her dresser and eventually withdrew a pair of button fly pants and a somewhat baggy t-shirt with two bright pink hearts on the front.<br />
<br />
Looking at her brother, Vicky noted that it wasn't just his genitals that made him look like a flat chested girl, but it was also his hips, waist, thighs and butt. Not saying anything, she handed him the clothes and went to go get an extra pair of high-top tennis shoes. Returning with the shoes, she handed them to Jason and told him, &quot;Try these on after I get you some socks,&quot; grinning and noting that the clothes made his face look softer, rounder and more feminine.<br />
<br />
After being dressed in his sister's clothes, Jason was handed a beach towel and the two went down to the local public pool. There, Jason would have enjoyed himself if not for the fact that three of Vicky's friends had shown up and Vicky had told them about Jason and his cross-dressing tendencies.<br />
<br />
Lucky she did not explain anything about his new genitals and the three girls just grinned and then one said to him, &quot;You look so cute. But Jason is not a good girl's name. For now we'll call you Erika,&quot; and with that all four girls fell into peals of laughter.<br />
<br />
Wanting this to end, mostly because he was deeply embarrassed but also because he was discovering he liked the way these clothes felt and made him look, Jason just wanted to get home and try to see if the computer program would alter anything involving people's current memories. Instead, after the swim, Vicky had insisted they go shopping...which she and the other girls bought Jason a couple of dresses and some underwear...and then to the food court for something to eat.<br />
<br />
What was even more troublesome to Jason was when they engaged him in conversation, he found that not only could he keep up, but he rather enjoyed being talked to like a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would you prefer Erika,&quot; one of the girls asked, pulling Jason out of his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Jason looked over at her, remembered that Vicky said her name was Julie, and then asked, &quot;Which would I prefer for what? I'm sorry, I was thinking about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Anna giggled and just as she asked, &quot;What were you thinking about,&quot; Julie asked, &quot;Would you use pads or tampons?&quot;<br />
<br />
Thinking he should be embarrassed by such a question, Jason found that he wasn't and looking at Julie, he told her, &quot;I would use tampons instead of pads.&quot;<br />
<br />
Registering the look on Julie's face, he instead turned to Anna and said in flat tone, &quot;I was thinking that guy over there had a cute butt.&quot; Which sent Vicky, Anna, Julie and Nicole in fits of laughter over what he had just said.<br />
<br />
A couple hours later, as they left the mall, Anna piped up and said, &quot;Hey, why don't we sleep over together.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking at Vicky, listening to the other three girls debate on whose house they would sleep over at, Jason said, &quot;I can't sleep over. I have school tomorrow. Do what ever your mind says is right, but I am not going to school dressed as a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
Vicky grinned and as the other three girls began to agree on Anna's house, Jason's older sister...by one year...told him, &quot;In case it slipped your mind, but tomorrow is a teacher conference day and that means an early weekend. There wont be school until Monday,&quot; and turning away, she began to talk with Anna, Julie and Nicole.<br />
<br />
Sighing, wondering how to get out of this situation, Jason absently rubbed his chest, which for some reason felt sore and tender...particularly in the nipple region. As he did that, he followed his sister, wondering what he had ate that was upsetting his stomach, which felt for some reason bloated and cramped. A feeling that resonated down into his abdomen and his groin.</p>
