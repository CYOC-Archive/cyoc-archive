<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sandy finished her pancakecake in LuLu's house and greeted Jellypie and all others for the food and ideas about her dad. She put her skates, big enough to being used with her clown Converses and ran to her house. Everyone greeted the mischievous little clown as she passed by, a tomboy but very girly in heart. When she came over her house she heard some sobbing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, I'm back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Sandy, don't come!&quot; said her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the freak came here, Rebeca.&quot; A drunken voice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, Tony, not her!&quot; plead Rebeca.<br />
<br />
Sandy entered her living room. Her mother Rebeca was over the floor, sobbing. Sandy looked to her dad and she felt herself very upset as she noted the tequila bottle he was carrying.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had drunk again, Pops?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your tongue with me, little freak!&quot; He said. It was like Petunia said Sandy: when drunk, her Pops was quite a devil. &quot;We should have given you to fosterage when we had a choice. Now I'm stuck with a cow and a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a freak, Pops, and don't you dare hurting Mom again!&quot; said Sandy. &quot;Don't clown with me. I'm a clown, but this is not a reason to take me by a fool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, the little freak speaks high, nah?&quot; sneered Tony &quot;Josh from the bar was right: you really need a beating to stay on your place!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And Petunia was right: you are with very very mean company, Pops. That Josh guy wasn't the one who tried to rob Mark-O? He was catch by the police and had a pie on his face by Jellypie. He deserved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough of this, you cursed freak. You have 10 seconds to say sorry or you'll have a hard beating.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll say something, for either you and Mom and this will make everyone here happier.&quot; she said, as her daddy starts to counts 10. &quot;It was Petunia and her family idea, and that will help us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;3... 2... 1...&quot; said Tony. Before he could say 0, Sandy said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, Pops, transformation or dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad stuck on shock, and her mom said: &quot;Sandy, what are you doing? It's brujaria, magia sinistra!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I had enough, mom! Dad calling me freak and hurting you. No more! Petunia suggested me to use the curse.&quot; then Sandy turned to her dad &quot;Hurry up, Pops, or it will be both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her dad still dumbfounded by the little tyke challenge for his authority... But the curse is a legend, he though.<br />
<br />
&quot;3... 2... 1... 0... Time's up. So there is both for both. I'll start with mom, and Pops'll be next.<br />
<br />
Mom, you'll be a clown, a whiteface as miss Petunia, LuLu's mother. You'll be prim and proper every time, and you'll be stern to those who aren't as proper as you, and no one will complain on you about this. As far as anybody knows, you always were a clown. You'll have a full knowledge of practical and impractical jokes, and everyone will think this is normal. You'll also have all cartoon physics. And you still will be specially stern on making Pops behave himself.<br />
<br />
For dare you will try and Transform or Dare friends. If they pick transform, you will make them into clowns for their transformation. If they pick dare, you will dare them to try Transformation and Dare their friends, and give them the same T &amp; D I'm giving you until now. And if they pick both , you'll give them both.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandy looks to her father with a mischievous grin on her face that made him shiver.<br />
<br />
&quot;For you Pops, Petunia and me thought on a special thing. You'll be also a clown, and have a full knowledge of practical and impractical jokes, and everyone will think this is normal. You'll also have all cartoon physics. But you'll be a hobo clown mom felled in love. As a hobo, you know you're the underdog of the clowns, so you could not be mean with mom or me no more. But you'll be a happy hobo and you'll like to make people happy.<br />
<br />
For dare you will try and Transform or Dare friends. If they pick transform, you will make them into clowns for their transformation. If they pick dare, you will dare them to try Transformation and Dare their friends, and give them the same T &amp; D I'm giving you until now. And if they pick both , you'll give them both.<br />
<br />
And there more on your dare:<br />
<br />
First, you'll no more drink booze. Two, you'll turn your drinking friends on hobos and daring them to no more drinking, like I'm daring you. So, Pops, you'll no more play big kahuna with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the curse starts to work its magic over Sandy's parents, Sandy starts to giggle. Her mother skin lost all her color, until turning milky white and her eyebrows turns a little thicker and blacker than it was, and big eyelashes flutters and bats over her green eyes. The auburn hair turns fire red and styled on a severe bum. Her nose appeared, little and snubbed and red. Her clown smile is very small and red, and her cheeks blushed in pink.<br />
<br />
Her clothes, a simple jeans and t-shirt, turned on a very Mary Poppins-esque dress, with a chocolate color. Her shoes turned a pair of petite Mary Jane, and with sober colors, as their socks. A big carpet bag and a umbrella shows over her arms. She put her bag on the floor and throw the umbrella, that flew to the hat stand, as a straw hat appears over her hair.<br />
<br />
Tony looked what his wife turned and now he knew it was his time. Her skins turns as it was sunburnt, and the eyes and muzzle turned covered on white. He face turns three-day bearded with black thick beard, and the top of her head lost all its hair. Her face looks a little wrinkled, and the skin on top hair looks sullen. Her hair looks a little sunburnt and his nose swells, but in a skin color, with a little dark on it. Her eyebrows goes thick as worms.  <br />
<br />
Her clothes POOFed away, leaving him just with white polka-dotted boxers and black socks. White shirts, clean but worn, appears over his chest, and navy patched pants goes over his boxers with leather suspenders. A navy blazer goes over the shirt and suspenders, patched.and wrinkled. A blue bowtie circle his neck as fingerless gloves covers his hands and very worn leathery clown shoes cover his feet. A bundle of clothes on a stick could be seeing where before could be seen the bottle of booze. To finish a navy very worn and wrinkled top hat cover her dad's hat.<br />
<br />
Sandy laughs very childish as the curse make its way over her parents' minds. It was when...<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatcha me done, Poppy?&quot; said her dad to her mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pops, you was very very potty mouth against Sandy. I will no more tolerate your boozing. This is why you can't stay on job.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Me drunk?&quot; said Pops.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, pops Pops. You were being mean with mommy and me.&quot; Said Sandy.<br />
<br />
&quot;I swear, no more boozing for me. This thing was ruining my life. Now I'll be a good husband and pops and no more days out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I expect.&quot; said Poppy, when she wrinkled her nose &quot;Good gracious, Pops! Where did you slept? You're stinking! Now to the bathroom for a bath, off you go. I will accept that rags as you're a hobo, as long you stay clean. But I'll not tolerate you stinking like a big skunk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, my.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'Oh, my!' said I! Great Scott, Pops! You can be more childish than Sandy, and that's something! Now to the bath, Pops! Spit spot! And you too, Sandy! We'll go to the Big Top! Pops and I'll act and you, little lady,&quot; saying you Sandy &quot;you'll behave yourself.&quot; said Poppy, taking control of your husband and child.</p>
