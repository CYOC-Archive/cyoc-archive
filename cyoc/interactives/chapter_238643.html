<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Leonard approaches Wallace&#39;s house, knowing his cousin will be alone. His father&#39;s car wasn&#39;t on the driveway, likely because Uncle George was selling another one of his fat cows. On the other hand, his mother was absent from the living room. Today is a Saturday, so she must be in the Town Library knitting with her club.<br />
<br />
Wallace embodies the original Trinkl qualities more than anyone —quiet, reserved, preferring solitude to the company of their relatives who doesn&#39;t know how to shut the fuck up. While the other cousins are always shouting and roughhousing, Leonard has always been able to connect with Wallace over their shared interests in video games and TV shows.<br />
<br />
As he draws closer, Leonard spots Wallace through the window of his first-floor bedroom. Wallace embodies the original Trinkl qualities more than anyone —quiet, reserved, preferring solitude to the company of their relatives who doesn&#39;t know how to shut the fuck up. While the other cousins are always shouting and roughhousing, Leonard has always been able to connect with Wallace over their shared interests in video games and TV shows.<br />
<br />
Leonard inched closer to the window. Wallace is hunched over his computer, engrossed in an online game with his online friends. Leonard can&#39;t help but feel a pang of envy. With his adorable looks, Wallace could easily have a steady stream of partners if he put himself out there. But he seems content to spend his free time gaming, even when he has the house to himself every Saturday while his parents are out.<br />
<br />
Leonard&#39;s mother rarely leaves the house, only venturing for groceries or visiting friends. He wishes he had the same freedom as Wallace to bring someone home for a night of fun. At nearly 18, Leonard feels left behind because all of his friends already dropped their nuts to someone. Even the dorky loner in their class already had his first if rumors were to be believed.<br />
<br />
Making up his mind, Leonard carefully opens the window to Wallace&#39;s room. He focuses his thoughts, feeling his body begin to liquefy and flow. In moments, he&#39;s a puddle of glistening green slime, oozing through the open window and splattering onto the floor. The gooey mass crept across the carpet, its wet sounds masked by the sound of gunshots on Wallace&#39;s headphones.<br />
<br />
Leonard slithers up Wallace&#39;s leg, thinning his gooey form into a string to avoid detection. Wallace was so engrossed with his game that he didn&#39;t notice the slime creeping up on his leg. Leonard reaches the dark inside Wallace&#39;s crotch and musters himself deeper until he is inside his cousin&#39;s boxers. He may have no skin, but he could feel the warm dampness of the area. Wallace must have played his video games as soon as he woke up.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Leonard spindles himself thinner. Aside from the alien&#39;s abilities he knew, it seemed vision in the dark was also in his arsenal. He could see his cousin&#39;s flaccid and uncut penis, expanding and contracting with his cousin&#39;s breath. He slips inside the crumple of skin and pushes himself with delicate care. He hears a soft moan escape his cousin&#39;s lips as he invades deeper regions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry guys, something&#39;s wrong,&quot; he mutters into the mic, his voice strained. &quot;&#39;I&#39;m going to pause the match for a second.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Wallace logs off and stands up, Leonard hears his cousin&#39;s sharp intake of breath. Wallace looks down, his eyes widening as he sees the puddle of green slime pooling beneath him.<br />
<br />
The element of caution vanished. Slow and steady didn&#39;t work, so he&#39;ll have to do the opposite thing. Leonard surged forward and forced more of his mass into Wallace&#39;s dick. The young man&#39;s eyes roll back in his head as he gasps, his knees buckling. Leonard takes advantage of his cousin&#39;s vulnerability, sending tendrils of slime shooting up to invade Wallace&#39;s mouth.<br />
<br />
Wallace screams, but the sound is muffled as Leonard&#39;s essence floods his throat. More and more flowed into him, enlarging him to painful sizes. Tears rained from his eyes by now. Eventually, the torture ended when Leonard&#39;s last bits entered his cousin&#39;s mouth. As Leonard fully inhabits Wallace&#39;s body, there&#39;s a brief moment where his cousin remains himself. Wallace staggers on the bed, his mind reeling from the alien presence invading his most intimate areas. He can feel the creature wrapping itself around his thoughts and insides.<br />
<br />
Wallace screams, his arms flailing as he clutches at his body. Overwhelming and unwanted pain throbs in his pants. He falls back onto the bed, his body convulsing and twisting in agony. But slowly, the pain subsides. Wallace&#39;s movements still, his breathing evening out. His eyes opened weakly, but it was not Wallace anymore. Leonard was in full control of his cousin&#39;s body. He sits up and looks around the room he has known all his life. Wallace&#39;s memories and knowledge dwell in his head, but they feel distant, like a movie he&#39;s seen rather than his own life.<br />
<br />
Leonard stands up to test his borrowed body. Well, maybe not borrowed since he never asked for Wallace&#39;s permission. The apt term is stolen. He rose to his stolen feet and explored his stolen body with stolen hands and eyes. Wallace&#39;s frame was typical for a 14-year-old boy – lean limbs and a smooth, unblemished torso. It was also cute to find his nipple pink in contrast to Leonard&#39;s brown. For a 14-year-old, there should be patches of hair here and there. It seemed puberty was going at a mellow pace for his cousin. Leonard&#39;s fingers ran through the younger boy&#39;s shoulder-length brown hair, expecting to encounter a greasy texture. To his surprise, the strands parted smoothly beneath his touch, revealing a clean, well-maintained mane.<br />
<br />
Leonard approached the mirror, his curiosity piqued by the prospect of seeing his own face reflected in his cousin&#39;s features. As he drew closer, he couldn&#39;t help but make a series of exaggerated facial expressions, watching Wallace&#39;s face mimic his every move. He grinned widely, stretched his cheeks, and even made a few lewd faces that seemed to suit his cousin&#39;s youthful appearance. It&#39;s so strange seeing his straight-faced cousin make these emotions.<br />
<br />
Satisfied with messing with Wallace&#39;s face, Leonard&#39;s gaze trailed downward. He began to undress until he stood bare before the mirror. His breaths were shallow, his very being alive with excitement and trepidation. He has seen his cousin naked multiple times, and he won&#39;t lie by saying he&#39;s got a cute body down there. His fingers traced the smooth, unblemished skin of his cousin&#39;s torso, marveling at the sensation of touching another&#39;s body. His hands roamed lower, his curiosity guiding him to explore the most intimate parts of his cousin&#39;s body. He let his shorts fall to the floor without remorse for the act. Wallace&#39;s cute and smooth groin bore before him.<br />
<br />
The logical side of his mind should at least feel a twinge of guilt for violating his cousin like this, but there was this sort of detachment as if he were merely exploring his own body. That must be because he was deeply embedded in Wallace&#39;s psyche. Still, his fingers traced the contours of his cousin&#39;s genitals. There were bits of slime still dripping from the folds of the foreskin. With a thought, he made them zip inside and felt a shooting jolt run across his spine. The thrill of seeing and feeling from his cousin&#39;s cock brewed a growing arousal deep within his groin.</p>
