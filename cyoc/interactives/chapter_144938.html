<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jeff&#39;s afterglow crescendoed and his balls began returning to their normal size, he laid back against the couch, relaxing happily. She, however, was still thirsty. Pushing a bit further onto her lollipop, she began to tighten her grip. With every contraction, she pulled her mouth and throat taught around the beast between his legs. Soon enough, her lips were vacuum sealed around his cock; she felt every twitch he made, and he moved to her whim. She began to vibrate her thoat gently, Jeff shifting and moaning as she did so. She waited for what felt like years before her favourite drink spouted from him, lapping it up as quickly as she could, while also continuing to suck.<br />
***<br />
Jeff suddenly awoke to an odd pain in his balls. Looking down, he found that his mother&#39;s hips pressed tightly against his own, a small scar of flesh joining them. He felt around it as a lump pass through into his mom, followed by a second. He then noticed a lack of weight underneath where his penis should be. He reached his hand under and found that where his balls should be was now only a flat piece of skin.<br />
Her ass then began to tighten its grip, spreading itself further up his pelvis. Jeff felt the warmth push down onto his legs hard, until suddenly, it stopped. The pressure disappeared entirely. Jeff inspected the cheeks around his hips and found that there was barely a distinction between where he ended and she began. He expermimentally tried to move his leg, but instead of feeling his leg shift, he saw his mom&#39;s ass cheek clench. The ass fat had absorbed his legs.<br />
With the clench came swelling. As her hips widened past her shoulders, her thighs became the size of chickens, and each of her mountains became the size of a turkey. Jeff tried to speak, but found himself unable to even breathe. However, he didn&#39;t feel like he was suffocating, just that his breath had died in his chest. He tried to reach up to get his mom to notice, but found his right arm moving away from her head. His body turned so his back faced up, leaving himself with a face full of couch.<br />
But his mom&#39;s ass hungered more, and began to suck Jeff into its cavernous maw. Jeff tried to counteract his sinking by pushing against her, but it was all in vain. His hands pressed into the plush, only sinking as he was dragged further inwards. The depth got to a point where no part of his hands was visible, only the indent on the assfat. Then, the cheeks vibrated, and the indents disappeared, Jeff&#39;s arms now stuck into her ass. As his torso sank between her mammoth cheeks, Jeff felt his organs melt and shift from him to her, her ass swelling all the bigger with the protein. His spine fused with hers, turning him into an ever shrinking tail. His throat connected to her rectum, followed by an uproarious burp. Jeff recoiled from the smell. Luckily, he wouldn&#39;t have to be sad about that for much longer, as as neck sank between the valley, Jeff felt his nostrils and ears close and his nose flatten.<br />
With a light thud, the back of his head hit his mom&#39;s tailbone, the transformation stopping for a few seconds. Another fart built up in her ass before releasing. However, Jeff found himself unable to stop himself from moving his lips. From the fart, he heard a voice very different from his own, possibly from multiple people.<br />
&quot;Join us.&quot;<br />
Us.<br />
There had been others who had been taken by her, becoming a collective. Others had been sucked dry by her and pulled between the plush mountains.<br />
He sat for what felt like hours on this subject, the transformation breaking the silence. He watched his hair fall out and disappear before it hit the couch cushion, his teeth absorbed into his gums and cheeks as his mouth shrank until it fit between the spread, and now much bigger, ass cheeks. He could taste the gallons of his salty cum he&#39;d pumped into her as it pooled in his mouth, his tongue stretching up and around her colon, covering every wall and valve, nook and cranny. Her panties then pulled themselves back up, wedging themselves between Jeff&#39;s eyes, his transformation complete.<br />
As if snapping out of a trance, Jeff&#39;s mom blinked and shook her head.<br />
Then, she stood up.<br />
Jeff watched from the best seat in the house as the gigantic fleshy doors made of both his mother, himself, and countless others closed; the things he&#39;d lusted over sealing his fate. Everything seemed to be in slow motion as his view of the living room shrank away. He felt as if he was watching both the most tragic and most beautiful movie ever made. A movie that was custom made for each person lucky enough to see it from the best seat in the house: deep between the performers. The doors slammed shut, but bounced against each other, causing them to reopen. The performance of the two jiggling twins was amazing, curtain close to curtain close. With a final clap, the curtains closed for the final time, the actors happily formed the warmest and comfiest home for him and gave him the most welcoming hug he&#39;d ever had. The twins then gave him the final act of their performance: What it&#39;s like to be an Ass. Jeff could feel as the Hello Kitty yoga pants were pulled up over him. He felt the light squeezes and rubs she made on the twins.<br />
Jeff&#39;s mom played idly with her butt. She couldn&#39;t explain it, but she felt like she was supposed to be preforming. She sat down on the couch and pretended to give someone a lap dance. Jeff felt himself jiggle this way and that, his mother not holding back against the couch.<br />
The twins did have one last surprise, however; a burp after their light snack.<br />
Making its way through Jeff&#39;s throat, it only stopped at his closed mouth, the pleasant taste sinking into his circular tongue. Jeff shut his eyes tight as the gas built up, eventually forcing its way out. With this last gigantic breath, he tried to say something.<br />
As Jeff&#39;s mom played with her ass, she heard a voice from behind her. It sounded like a kid, which was weird, since all the kids were upstairs.<br />
The voice said one thing.<br />
&quot;Fill us up.&quot;</p>
