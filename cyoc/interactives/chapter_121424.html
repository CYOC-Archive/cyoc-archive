<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You looked down and immediately saw two large orbs clinging to your chest, and you were startled. &quot;Waaah! What the...&quot; you began then paused hearing a new high pitched voice coming out of your mouth, a feminine one at that.<br />
<br />
You carefully inspected the rest of your body seeing green scales all over it. You face had a muzzle on it with sharp carnivorous teeth laying inside of it as well as a forked tongue. Your hands and feet were now 4 digit claws, and your feet were the same but digitigrade and reminded you of a velociraptor&#39;s legs. You then saw the emptiness between your legs and the scaled soft lips that bulged out in place of your penis, your vagina. Your ass was larger than before and a long lizard tail extended out of your rear, and you felt it and swung it at will.<br />
<br />
You looked around and saw a small pond and peered at your reflection, and staring back was a lizard woman who looked quite hot with her hourglass shape and noticeable scaled breasts and ass. You would be aroused right now if you hadn&#39;t known that the lizard woman was you. As you peered at your reflection you noticed spikes running down your back to the tip of your tail. Moments later the girl from before walked up to you and she began closely inspecting your body<br />
<br />
&quot;A kobold huh? Female too, good we don&#39;t have to worry about any....problems along the lines of gender.&quot; The girl said and you turned angrily and pushed her away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good?! You turned me into a lizard chick! Turn me back now!!&quot; You yelled angrily, but the tone of your voice made your threat sound innocent and harmless. You couldn&#39;t help but blush, embarrassed by the sound of your voice.<br />
<br />
The girl paused after seeing your expression quickly change from mad and vengeful to blushing, humiliated of your new body. You sat down on a boulder, and felt your new feminine emotions and hormones beginning to take effect and your eyes began tearing up for seemingly no reason. &quot;Damnit, why the hell is this happening to me?&quot; You asked and the girl walked up to you.<br />
<br />
You saw the girl approach and you growled at her,&quot;What do you want now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I just want to help you deal with your new feelings.&quot; The girl said<br />
<br />
You paused for a moment then growled again,&quot;First you turned me into this, and now you come to me saying that you&#39;ll help? What is your sick game?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I..It&#39;s not a game I swear. The form that you&#39;ve taken on was a random one based off of what you would possibly exist as in this world if you were born here.&quot; The girl said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ha ha, and why would I exist as this in this world?&quot; You asked laughing sarcastically <br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t quite answer that, but the universe is a large place so please just be open to this. You are my familiar after all.&quot; The girl said<br />
<br />
You gave the girl a puzzled look and said,&quot;Excuse me, I&#39;m your what?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Your my familiar, a creature that exists alongside and assists a mage of sorts. The relationship is almost always like a successor to a master, but some are more like slave to master in terms of a familiar to mage relationship. I personally would never consider another sentient creature as a slave.&quot; The girl exclaimed<br />
<br />
You then shot a glare at the girl and said,&quot;Why would I serve you after what you just turned me into a lizard woman?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are a female kobold, and the reason that you should is that our lives are now bound as one. If either of us die then the other fades with them, but if I die past a certain age then you will live on, and as a kobold you won&#39;t age at all. I will help you adapt first as much as I can before anything else once we get back to my home, or I guess now it&#39;s our home. But seriously we need to cooperate with each or we&#39;re both going to suffer for it.&quot; The girl said<br />
<br />
You puased for a moment to think then sighed,&quot;I guess....I&#39;ll cooperate, but who are you exactly?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Kathy, and yours should probably be.....Câlie okay?&quot; The girl, Kathy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Câlie....wait why do I need a new name?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t want to go walking around like that with the name of a human man now would you? Besides it&#39;s not a bad name, and it&#39;s a kobold name that matches your physique.&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
&quot;My...physique? What do you mean by that?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a complementary name due to your body retaining a feminine shape and structure while still being strong and thick scaled. Kobolds usually have thick scales, but yours seem quite thicker than many others that I&#39;ve seen.&quot; Kathy said, and you blushed once you heard what she said about your body&#39;s structure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you calling me....curvy?&quot; You asked blushing embarrassed <br />
<br />
&quot;Well yes, and your breasts seem remarkably firm for D cups. I imagine that you would be sensitive towards your body around males because of what it is. Besides you are a full adult kobold since they reach prime much faster than humans, just steer clear of anyone that tries to take advantage of you for the time being.&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
&quot;C...can we talk about something else besides my body now? It&#39;s kind of uncomfortable hearing you speak about my breasts like that.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why of course, but it&#39;s fine to talk about it, we&#39;re both women after all. I&#39;m straight by the way too so I&#39;m fine as long as you are.&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well yeah...I mean...I think I am, this whole switched genders thing is confusing me. Why do you know or care about that anyway?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m a healing mage or a doctor if you will, so it&#39;s my job to know about the male and female bodies. I also sometimes correct faults in ones physical body if needed, or change them in exchange for payment of course.&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
&quot;So like a plastic surgeon basically, except with magic?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
Kathy gave you a puzzled look and said,&quot;If what you call a plastic surgeon does what I do then yes, but I would prefer that you don&#39;t refer to me or others using terms like those. It could confuse them or offend them on occasion.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...alright then, sorry if I offended you by that, there&#39;s barely a difference really. So what do we do now?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;We go home to my cottage that also doubles as my workplace. Don&#39;t worry about any illnesses, I assure you that I make sure everything is quite clean, and if you get ill then I&#39;ll just handle it.&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
You stood up and looked back at your tail then down to your padded feet feeling the soft grass beneath you. You then looked up at Kathy and asked,&quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to have a spare cloak or something on you to cover up my....you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately no, but fortunately kobolds don&#39;t wear clothing of any sorts. You won&#39;t need to worry about humiliation in public for nudity, besides those spikes of yourse are like blades and would tear apart most fabrics that I could give you.&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
You sighed and lifted one of your breasts to see your dark green nipple, and you touched it out of curiosity and got a slight surge of pleasure from it and it soon got hard and erect. Kathy walked up to you and you blushed when you noticed her. &quot;The pleasure captivating for you isn&#39;t it? Just don&#39;t do it too much alright?&quot; Kathy said<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, its just...nostalgic to have these, let&#39;s go alright?&quot; You said and Kathy nodded pulling you close. Kathy snapped her fingers and a circle appeared around your feet, and suddenly a pillar of light shot up from underneath the two of you. The light soon dissolved and you and Kathy were standing in front of a cottage, her cottage. And it was in...</p>
