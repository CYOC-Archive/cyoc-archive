<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marco woke up first, and gingerly crawled out of the pull-out bed, trying his hardest not to wake Francisco. 
<br>

<br>
 Pulling on his trousers, he plodded to the kitchen and searched around for the makings for a pot of coffee. 
<br>

<br>
 Once the coffee was brewing, he tiptoed back to the living room to get the book. Not quite awake before, he hadn't really registered the mess the room was in. 
<br>

<br>
 A broken lamp littered the carpet; books, magazines and the remains of a box of doughnuts were spread on the floor, next to the upended coffee table. Behind the
<br>
 couch, a large shred of carpeting was torn, the floor beneath scuffed and pitted. 
<br>
 All the other furniture was pushed haphazardly against the walls. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco smiled and giggled softly. He had convinced Francisco to use the book to turn them both into centaurs. They had gotten rather -- rambunctious. Not that
<br>
 that was a bad thing - in fact, it was one of the best dates Marco had ever been on. But their unaccustomed dimensions had done a job on the room, that was for
<br>
 sure. 
<br>

<br>
 Idly scratching himself, Marco marveled at the memory - and the damage. &quot;Don't know how we didn't wake the neighbors, much less the boys,&quot; he thought. Marco
<br>
 nudged the bedroom door open and peeked in. Ric and Josh were both sound asleep. Marco quietly crept to the bathroom, finished, then back out to the kitchen,
<br>
 closing the door behind him 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Lord, 3 p.m. already,&quot; Marco thought, pouring his first cup of java. &quot;All that magic and excitement sure took it out of everyone. Probably not too long before
<br>
 everyone else gets up. If I'm going to arrange this, I'd better get started.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 He paged through the book, taking notes on particular spoells and pages. 30 minutes passed, then 45. 
<br>

<br>
 Josh was the first to interrupt him. Actually, the crunching sound of Josh's feet on the shards of the lamp made Marco look up first. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Morning, man,&quot; Josh said, yawning. &quot;What time is it?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Coming up on four in the afternoon, actually,&quot; Marco answered. Guess you guys were really tuckered out from last night. Coffee's fresh, if you want some.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Thanks,&quot; answered Josh, grabbing a mug from the dishrack. He filled it almost 3/4 full with milk first, then topped that off with some coffee and spooned in 5
<br>
 sugars. &quot;Ah, that helps,&quot; he said after the first sip. &quot;What're you up to?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh, a little something I dreamed up,&quot; Marco said. In front of Marco on the kitchen table was a potted plant and some scattered slips of paper, along, of course,
<br>
 with the book. &quot;Just give me a minute, OK? Why don't you go wake Ric before the whole day is gone?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; muttered Josh. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco read one spell after another, carefully moving one slip of paper from the pile to his left to the pile on his right after each one. When the last paper was
<br>
 moved, he shut the book and said a short prayer. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Hi, Marco,&quot; It was Ric, following Josh back into the room. &quot;Um, what happened here?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh, we, um, tried a few more changes after you guys fell asleep last night. We did a litle more, ah, horsing around than we probably should have. Things got a
<br>
 little, um, out of hand there for a bit. No serious damage, though. Tell you what - I think you two should be the ones to wake up Francisco,&quot; Marco said
<br>
 mischievously. &quot;Nothing he likes better first thing than a surprise.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Me first,&quot; Josh immediately shouted, as he and Ric raced into the living room and pounced on the sofabed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Wha -- hey!&quot; Francisco shouted. &quot;What're you -- oh, it's you two. Good morning.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;More like afternoon, Mr. Mendes,&quot; Josh said, &quot;It's almost 4 o'clock!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Geez Louise, I slept like a log,&quot; Francisco said. &quot;You guys OK? Find everything you need?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Sure. We only just got up, too,&quot; Ric said. &quot;Could you make us something to eat? I'm starving!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;How about pancakes?&quot; Francisco asked,&quot;with bacon?&quot; Both boys nodded vigorously. &quot;Just give me a minute to get it together, OK? Why don't the two of you go
<br>
 wash up first? Thanks.&quot; This last was directed to Marco, who had leaned over the top of the couch with a cup of coffee for Francisco. 
<br>

<br>
 Once the boys had gone, Francisco scooted out of bed and got dressed. Gathering the fixings for breakfast, he heard a pounding from the other room. &quot;What's
<br>
 that? That you, Marco?&quot; he stopped and peeked around the doorway. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco was standing on a chair, using the bottom of one of his shoes to pound pushpins into - it looked like a branch from one of the plants from the kitchen
<br>
 window, attaching it to the ceiling just inside the front door. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;It's OK, Frankie. Trust me. I'll clue you in in a minute. There. Done.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Shrugging his shoulders, Francisco returned to the breakfast preparations. 
<br>

<br>
 After the meal was cleaned up, Josh asked, &quot;So, whadda you guys wanna do today? Or what's left of it?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Well, I --&quot; Francsico began, but was interrupted by Marco. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Got a surprise for all of you. I've been studying the book and I'm pretty sure this will work out just right,&quot; he started. &quot;Now, you boys are old enough to know that
<br>
 Frankie and I are a couple, right?&quot; Ric and Josh nodded. &quot;OK, that's out of the way. And yesterday, you saw us as kids and you grew up, right?&quot; More nods.
<br>
 &quot;Well, do you think you just might be ready for a little more, ah, grown-up fun tonight?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Marco, that might not be --&quot; Francisco began. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Don't worry, Frankie, I've got all the angles covered. Sure of it,&quot; Marco said. &quot;Tell you what, I'll go first. But I've gotta warn you, I won't do this if it bothers
<br>
 anyone. Oh, and you're gonna see me naked, too, but nothing you didn't see last night, huh?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric and Josh were both intrigued about what kind of game Marco had set up. &quot;Um, yeah, I guess,&quot; Ric said, &quot;But I don't know about Josh. He's still a kid.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Who you calling a kid?&quot; Josh snapped back. I bet I can use the book better'n you anyday. &quot;'sides, I want to see what's gonna happen!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;All right, then,&quot; Marco said, pushing back his chair and standing. &quot;Francisco, I need you outside in the hall for a minute.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 The two men opened the front door, stepped outside and pulled the door shut. 
<br>

<br>
 Marco quickly filled Francisco in on his scheme. Reticent at first, Mr. Mendes peppered Marco with 'what-ifs' and 'just-in-cases' until all his doubts were erased.
<br>
 Hell, he couldn't say no to Marco in any case. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You guys OK?&quot; Ric's voice sounded through the door. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yeah, just a few more seconds,&quot; Marco shouted back. &quot;I'll go first, then you follow, Frankie, OK?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco smiled and gave Marco a high five. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Here it comes,&quot; shouted Marco before opening the door. 
<br>

<br>
 Stepping inside, he walked directly under the branch hangin on the ceiling. Before taking 2 more steps, his outline wavered and compreseed in on itself, softening,
<br>
 diminishing, until a much less buff Marco was there - Marco at 18. &quot;C'mon in now, Frankie,&quot; the new Marco said. 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco repeated the same path as Marco, with the same effect. He, too, was now 18. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Is that all?&quot; Josh asked, exasperated. &quot;We did all that yesterday. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Um, no, that's not quite all of it,&quot; Marco answered. &quot;First, I've put a spell on this plant, and used it like mistletoe. It will work on anyone who walks underneath.
<br>
 Next, whoever it works on will become 18. Physically AND mentally. Even you.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Yeah ... and ...?&quot; Ric began. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Give me a minute, OK? There's more.&quot; Marco walked around to the back of Francxisco and placed his hands on the other's shoulders. &quot;Watch.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Marco pushed down, and Francisco bent over backwards, then kept going, arcing further and further, into an impossible position that would have broken anyone
<br>
 else's back. The top of Francisco's head brushed the carpet now.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;See? That's part three. Everyone affected is made pliable. With just a little pressure, any part of your body can be bent any way you want!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Cool! I wanna try it,&quot; Josh shouted, and ran out the door, then back in. &quot;Total coolness,&quot; he began as he shot up to 18. &quot;Ouch!&quot; This in a baritone voice. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;What is it, Josh?&quot; Ric asked, concerned. Marco had a suddenly worried look on his face. Josh was fumbling with the too-tight buttons of his jeans. &quot;I think I - oh,
<br>
 yeah, that's better,&quot; he said as he stripped off the pants and underwear. Blushing, Josh explained that the crotch of his pants had ridden up and tightened so much
<br>
 that it was crushing one of his balls. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You next, Ric,&quot; Josh said, walking over and pushing his now-younger cousin towards the door. &quot;C'mon, man, one for all and all for one, y'know?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Ric went through the same change. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;So, now what, Marco?&quot; the boys asked. &quot;Um, I think I need a towel or something,&quot; Ric said, trying not to draw attention to the stiffening of his penis. Josh, too,
<br>
 was in the same condition, and covered himself with his hands. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Don't worry, boys, it's perfectly normal,&quot; Marco said. &quot;Frankie?&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco stripped off his clothes. He, too, was sporting a full erection. &quot;Yeah. Perfectly normal. Hell, the first time at this age I was like this, oh, about 20 hours a
<br>
 day!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;But this time,&quot; Marco began, stepping out of his pants, &quot;with a twist!&quot; He placed his hand gently on Francisco's hard organ, his thumb underneath the head and his
<br>
 index fingertip on top. Pushing upwards with his thumb, Marco began to roll Francisco's cock, like a jellyroll, around his index finger. &quot;See? No way anyone could
<br>
 normally do that with a hard-on! Hah! worked like a, well, like a charm!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Everyone laughed. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Oh, there's a part four I haven't told you about yet - that's the topper,&quot; Marco said, releasing Francisco from his grasp. &quot;The spell also makes anyone who is
<br>
 affected not only horny as hell, but we're all also now fully, um, bi!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;You mean, like, I would do it with --- a -- guy?&quot; Josh shouted. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;If you want,&quot; Marco said. 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;That's, that's -- that's just,&quot; Josh began, then stopped as hormones, the spell and realizations set in, &quot;so friggin' fantastic! You the man, dude!&quot; 
<br>

<br>
 Francisco and Marco both breathed a deep sigh of relief. Truly 18 in mind, body and spirit, any conseuqences were the last thing from their minds - all they knew
<br>
 was that they were goddy, horny and full of enough energy to do something about it! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;Now, the rest of the game for tonight,&quot; Francisco said,&quot;is that each of us get to call any two people we want and get them to come over here. Once they come in,
<br>
 there's no way to avoid the 'mistletoe.'&quot; He grabbed one of his wrists with the oppsoie hand and bent his armbackwards almost double. Bending Marco's neck
<br>
 backwards, Francisco bent over and plantyed a deep kiss on the surprised teen's lips. &quot;Should be one hell of an orgy. I'm itching to get started.&quot;</p>
