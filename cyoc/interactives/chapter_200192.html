<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Yes…” the shopkeeper began, “but you have to do it exactly the same way you did it before.”<br />
<br />
Both men stood there silently as they processed this information. “What happens if we don’t?” Miles asked with a hint of worry.<br />
<br />
“Then you will be stuck in your new bodies for the rest of your lives.” The shopkeeper said.<br />
<br />
The two men walked outside the shop and back to the car. Miles didn’t say anything on the drive back but he knew deep down he was too afraid. What if James refused to swap back? Honestly he wouldn’t blame him considering how amazing his body was. Miles glanced at the ring on his finger as he maneuvered the steering wheel, luckily Shamrock wasn&#39;t so short that he wasn&#39;t able to drive his car (not like he trusted anyone but himself to drive his cars) but it was a bit difficult to adjust to the car in his much smaller form. Previously he had been around 6&#39; 8&quot; now he would have to guess he was nearly 5&#39; 4&quot; which slightly annoyed him. Miles had gone through life always being the biggest man around whether in school, social status, or even in bed. But now it seemed he was reduced to the complete opposite of himself.<br />
<br />
Miles had decided to drive them back to his mansion quickly, in fact he wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. He glanced in the rearview mirror to see James sitting anxiously in the backseat. For some reason, James had refused to sit in the front even when Miles asked him to. &quot;I wish I knew what that kid was thinking,&quot; Miles thought to himself as he sped up.<br />
<br />
Contrary to what Miles believed, James did not want to be stuck in this body. Sure most men would see it as the opportunity to finally have everything they&#39;ve ever wanted: the perfect career, the perfect body, and the perfect life. But James was actually very selfless, in fact Miles was right about James being the complete opposite of himself, as he cared more about others and their best interests rather than his own. Growing up with his single Mom, James had learned to truly be grateful as his Mom worked hard to support him and his younger brother without any help. James likewise decided to work hard in school so he could attend a prestigious university to gain a good job to help support his Mom and Luke. But if James stayed as Miles who would help support his family? Furthermore, James knew deep down he wouldn&#39;t be able to live with himself if he could never see his Mom again as his own self.<br />
<br />
Miles parked the car and stepped out of the vehicle. He watched James struggling to lift himself out of the car due to his imbalance and unaccustomed center of gravity. Miles rolled his eyes and headed upstairs to his front entrance where his security system, a fingerprint scanner, was awaiting him. Miles attempted his own thumb before remembering the body he was trapped in. Annoyed at this realization, he turned around to yell at James to hurry up. After a few minutes, James made his way to the top of the staircase and pressed his thumb awkwardly on the panel as the doors opened and Philip awaited him near the entrance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh sir, your breakfast is already prepared in the dining room,&quot; the butler said eloquently. Miles felt another sense of irritation as he realized that Philip was facing towards James when he said this comment. James stood there in awe, clearly from never seeing his own personal butler before, but Miles had little time to spare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry Philip but we&#39;re busy at the moment,&quot; Miles said a bit stand-offish.<br />
<br />
Philip arched an eyebrow at Miles as if wondering who this stranger was to bark an order at him. But luckily James intervened. &quot;Thank you Philip but we have something important to discuss. But don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll try to finish before the food gets cold,&quot; James said with a bow.<br />
<br />
Philip stood there taken aback. Now it was James he was looking with the raised eyebrow, never in his life had Master Miles ever been so respectful and kind to him nor had he ever bowed. Philip was in such shock that Miles and James were able to head off back to the same room they previously occupied. The room Miles prepared for his &quot;special&quot; guests was a bit messy as the velvet sheets and the pillows were scattered around the ground but Miles had no time to waste as he threw everything off the bed so that they could have enough space to switch back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok so all we have to do is a blowjob and two sex positions before we&#39;re back to normal,&quot; Miles said as he glanced at James still awkwardly standing in the corner staring at him. James weakly nodded before taking off his suit jacket and shirt. Miles looked momentarily before understanding he would also have to strip as if he had never considered it. He took off the collared shirt exposing his skinny hairless chest before making his way to his pants. He unfastened the belt as the pants slid off before hastily removing his white briefs showing the rest of his twinkish body. Miles looked down as his unimpressive flaccid dick and small red bush before glancing at James towering over him with his previous nine inches staring him at the face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Gah!&quot; Miles said with a slight jump back. &quot;Don&#39;t sneak up on me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry sir! I just thought you wanted to get this done with,&quot; James stated apologetically. <br />
<br />
Miles then realized what he meant and gulped. James had given him a blowjob before they had sex, now it was Miles turn. Slowly Miles used his smaller hand to grasp his old cock and felt the girth and length overwhelm him as his face turned bright red. Choking back a few tears at the humiliation at servicing his own cock, James sat on the bed as Miles brought his mouth over to his dick. It was much larger in his new perspective and despite his best instincts, Miles felt himself getting slightly aroused in his new position. Just as before, Miles felt intrigued at being a dominant top trapped in a submissive bottom&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
James noticed Miles hesitation throughout the whole day and decided to take it nice and slow for Miles but the moment he felt his previous hands on his cock an electric shock surged through him as he began to become aroused. His new cock was much larger and girthier, and his stamina and sex drive were off the charts in Miles&#39; body. It became hard to control his desires as his cock gained an erection. Now standing nearly eleven inches, James watched as Miles look more apprehensive than before. &quot;Don&#39;t worry sir! Just take it nice and slow, you&#39;ll find it pretty easy after a bit,&quot; James said with an encouraging smile.<br />
<br />
Miles angrily glared at James, his arrogant expression and &quot;advice&quot; were nothing more than to torment him. That little brat was enjoying this! And despite his current erection and the claims saying he himself wasn&#39;t, Miles knew he couldn&#39;t let his intern win. Miles opened his mouth and took a slight taste of his cock noting the salty and strange taste it had. He&#39;d never had another man&#39;s cock in his mouth so the whole experience was new but then maybe he still hadn&#39;t considering his original mouth remained cock free. But even if had wanted to attempt giving a blowjob, he never knew it would be to his former dick. Miles slowly devoured his entire cock in his mouth and felt it make is way to the back of his throat before letting it out. Miles gasped for air as he realized that it would take getting used to just as Shamrock said. After a few more attempts, Miles became accustomed to his cock and started to suck rapidly and easily as he realizing while sucking how good his gag reflex was or Shamrock&#39;s was. No wonder he could give such amazing blowjobs!  <br />
<br />
James moaned in pleasure as he felt his former mouth suck off his dick. He&#39;d never felt so much pleasure before and he wasn&#39;t sure if it was from his new dick, sex drive, or from the fact that his old body could give a blowjob so well. But James enjoyed the experience so much he felt close to cumming. Suddenly Miles stopped and James looked down to see him getting off the ground where he had knelt before. &quot;I think that&#39;s enough...&quot; Miles said midsentence before pulling out a pube from his mouth with a look of disgust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re ready?&quot; James asked worried. After all bottoming was much more difficult than topping, not as if he knew how topping felt, and he thought that Miles was still scared deep down at the prospect of filling himself with his previous massive cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m ready!&quot; Miles said confidently. James decided to go along with it as he laid on his back as Miles climbed on to the bed. &quot;Ok so how do I do this?&quot; Miles thought as he climbed on top of his body, positioning himself so that he sat right in front of his old cock. He had never bottomed in his entire life and the whole idea of it was frightening to him. He felt his former cock pulsate behind him with warmth as pre-cum kept leaking and covering his back. Miles looked down at his original large muscular hairy body and the juxtaposition it had with the new body he inhabited, the hairless pale skinny body with his humiliating boner leaking his own pre and clearly not taking much space.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here let me help you get started,&quot; James said as he stuck his index finger in his hole. Miles gasped at the sensation as a large finger slowly wedged itself up his ass. His 4 inch erection started leaking like crazy as James repeatedly quickly inserted and removed his finger. The thick digit filled his asshole nicely and Miles felt himself experiencing a new form of pleasure as he unconsciously let out a few moans. Did bottoms always feel this good?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok now that we got you prepared it’s time for the sex,&quot; James said calmly. But deep down he was prepared to fuck his old body silly. Something about seeing his old reactions on his prior face and the moans Miles let out aroused him to the point where he was almost losing control. He could hardly wait anymore. He saw Miles nod as he confidently stood and climbed over his body and slowly placed his old ass near his dick. &quot;Here goes nothing,&quot;  Miles said as he threw his ass down in one big swoop. <br />
<br />
It seemed James had good experience placing things in his ass because this dick entered his body just fine but Miles still felt an odd sensation of discomfort. Clearly the dick was much bigger than the finger James had used earlier but Miles could nearly feel it approaching his stomach. He&#39;d never felt such a myriad of emotions at once: pleasure from the new experience, humiliation from bottoming to his old cock, and a hybrid of pain, fear, and anticipation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here I go,&quot; James said in a deep yet alluring tone. James had to admit he felt a bit exhilarated being in such a powerful body while having a new experience topping and the fact it was his old body he was fucking also made it a bit more hot. He held Miles&#39; wrists as he pounded his old ass repeatedly, thrusting his dick as far as he could manage. He knew that Miles could handle it, clearly James was able to last night, but he also knew that Miles must feel a great sense of pleasure of being filled up with such a massive cock.<br />
<br />
Miles grunted in ecstasy as his old dick plowed his ass with such force that he couldn’t help himself. &quot;I&#39;ll never admit it,&quot; he thought, &quot;but I had never felt so good in his entire life!&quot; Miles felt James&#39; dick... no his original dick constantly leaving his ass before being shoved back inside leaving him such a strange notion of craving it rougher and harder.<br />
&quot;Hurry Shamrock!&quot; Miles said as he was plowed repeatedly, half-hoping it would soon be over. Looking down, Miles watched his tiny dick bounce along with his tiny balls to the beat of the thrusts and felt so close to climaxing at that exact moment. He stared at James as he shut his eyes and drool leaked from his mouth while grunting repeatedly... had he always looked this hot when fucking those other interns?<br />
<br />
Then came the last part... well at least James had remembered about it. &quot;Sir, I think we need to finish this before we both climax,&quot; James said looking up at his old face. Miles panted from exhaustion with an expression of being unfulfilled. Miles had nearly forgotten but he was close to cumming he didn&#39;t even care what was happening anymore. He even nearly forgot the reason why they were doing it. But after a quick shake he understood what he had to do. &quot;Ok let&#39;s do it!&quot; Miles said.<br />
<br />
James grasped Miles over his lap before placing the twink on his stomach with his ass protruding in the air. Miles looked behind him to see his dominating figure towering over him before he watched his old cock renter. The position was completely different to the previous one in that Miles felt much more submissve here. James pounded his dick while Miles enjoyed how his nice bubbly ass felt so good cushioning the force James used thrusting. At last, Miles couldn’t resist it anymore, it felt good to bottom! He had finally admitted it and whether it was due to being lost in pleasure or from the fact that his original body just had the perfect dick to satisfy anyone or even that Shamrock was just built to bottom he just didn&#39;t care. He was having one of the best moments of his life right now.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, James thought Miles may have forgotten he went a bit rough and hard on him last night but James hadn’t. Whether this was good or not was not yet decided as James definitely understood the reasoning behind it. In Miles&#39; body, it just felt natural to want to dominate and destroy anything, with the powerful muscular build and the rush from his large dick, James couldn&#39;t contain himself from fucking his old self silly. He never knew how nice his ass felt and how it was able to perfectly take cock. He looked down at his hairy chest as his pecs bounced to the rhythm of his thrusts and his strong hairy arms grasped Miles&#39; shoulder blades tightly. Just the fact he was inside the huge beefy body he so enamored last night just fired him much more. Til the point that he couldn&#39;t hold it anymore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sir! I&#39;m ready...&quot; James boomed as he finally shot his load. This was the first time he had cummed inside another man, even more so with another man&#39;s cock and the feeling of pleasure he was experiencing was proportional to the length of his new equipment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh!&quot; Miles grunted as he felt himself cumming non-stop from his smaller dick while his old one filled him with warm fluids. The cum flowed into him as Miles fell to his side passed out from the pleasure as the cum slowly leaked out his ass. James fell beside him, causing the bed to ripple from the large mass falling, before it subsided and he drifted off. The ring emitted a familar glow but nobody was awake to witness it. <br />
<br />
The next morning they awoke to see...</p>
