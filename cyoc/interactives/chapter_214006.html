<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Erik stumbled into the gym, feeling like a fish out of water. <br />
<br />
He was not feeling baseball today, or any other sport for that matter. The thought of showering after class and showing everyone the goods was making him sweat. He had seen the other dudes in the locker room before and the comparison was brutal. They were all packing, with confidence that radiated from every inch of their bodies. But Erik, well, he was lacking in that department, and he was feeling all kinds of insecure about it.<br />
<br />
As he made his way to his locker, he noticed a dude standing at the far end of the locker room. The dude was unlike any of the other guys he had seen before. He was jacked, with a chest and abs that looked like they were carved from stone. But what really caught Erik&#39;s attention was the size of his junk. Erik instantly felt so small seeing his package, a symbol of all the things Erik wished he had but didn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t help but remember the first time he had laid eyes on Tyler&#39;s beast...<br />
<br />
...Erik&#39;s mind was transported back to a previous gym class, when he was in the locker room getting dressed. Tyler, the star athlete of the school, had walked in and started getting dressed. Erik couldn&#39;t help but gawk at Tyler&#39;s physique, especially the size of his junk. The comparison was brutal, and Erik felt a deep sense of inadequacy and shame. He remembered thinking to himself, &quot;How could someone have so much, and why do I have so little?&quot; It was long and thick, even when flaccid. Bouncing between Tyler&#39;s leg like a .. well, like a third leg!<br />
Erik was both amazed at the sight but also mortified by how he stacked up, or really how he DIDN&#39;T.<br />
<br />
He couldn&#39;t shake the image of Tyler&#39;s junk from his mind. He had never seen anything like it before, and the thought of it was seared into his brain. It was like a scene from a movie, every square inch permanently printed full size on a wall in his brain....<br />
<br />
... Erik&#39;s thoughts were interrupted when Tyler approached him, and he tried to snap back to reality. <br />
Tyler cleared his throat, drawing Erik&#39;s attention back to the present. &quot;Hey man, we&#39;ve gotta head out to the field for practice. Coach will kill us if we&#39;re late,&quot; he said, clapping Erik on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
Erik shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts, &quot;Sure, yeah I&#39;ll be right out.&quot; Tyler gave him a nod and headed out to the field for practice. <br />
<br />
As Erik began to undress, he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten something important - his jockstrap. He frantically searched through his bag, but it was nowhere to be found. He felt a wave of panic wash over him as he imagined the embarrassment of not having any protection.<br />
<br />
Erik was frozen in the spot as Coach stormed into the locker room, looking around with a stern expression. &quot;What the hell are you doing in here? We&#39;re supposed to be on the field five minutes ago.&quot; Coach barked.<br />
<br />
Erik stuttered as he tried to explain, &quot;I-I-I forgot my jock strap. I can&#39;t find it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Coach let out an exasperated sigh, &quot;Great, just what we need.&quot; But then he softened a bit as he noticed Erik&#39;s worried expression, &quot;Alright, let&#39;s see if I have anything in the lost and found.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik followed Coach to his office, where the coach rummaged through the cluttered drawer. &quot;Aha!&quot; Coach exclaimed, as he pulled out an old, worn jock strap. &quot;This should do the trick. Get dressed and get out to that field in two minutes, or you&#39;re going to be running laps until you drop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik gratefully took the jock, &quot;Thanks Coach. I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just get your butt out to the field and show me what you can do. That&#39;s all the apology I need.&quot; Coach said gruffly, but with a hint of a smile. As he made his way out of the office, Coach called back, &quot;Two minutes, Erik. Don&#39;t make me come back for you.&quot; And with that, he jogged back to the field, leaving Erik to catch up.<br />
<br />
As Erik inspects the jockstrap he just got from Coach, he can&#39;t help but be taken aback. The jockstrap is old, worn, and has definitely seen better days, but it&#39;s the pouch that catches his eye. It&#39;s massive, and Erik can&#39;t believe that a jockstrap of this size even exists. He wonders what kind of man could have left such a large jockstrap behind, and his mind immediately races to the size of the man who once wore it. He gulps at the thought, feeling both intimidated and fascinated. <br />
<br />
He balled up both of his fists and was stunned to see that the pouch completely covered them both, with room to spare. He couldn&#39;t imagine what kind of man it would take to leave this jockstrap behind. The thought of wearing something so massive made Erik both excited and nervous at the same time.<br />
<br />
Despite the jockstrap&#39;s age and wear, Erik knows he has no other choice but to put it on if he wants to make it out to the field in time. <br />
<br />
As Erik slid the jockstrap on, he was taken aback by how big the pouch was on him. His junk was swimming in the pouch and there was no bulge at all. He muttered to himself, &quot;This is not what I had in mind. But no time to worry about it now.&quot; Erik quickly got dressed and headed out to the field, jogging to catch up with Coach and the team. Despite his discomfort, he was determined to put in a good performance on the field.</p>
