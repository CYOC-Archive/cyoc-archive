<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aisha had wonderful dreams that night, though none of the erotic nature. She had more than satisfied her long pent-up thirst for sexual gratification with the attention she had personally given her breasts yesterday. As such, her mind went to the usual places it did when she was asleep. She dreamed about Jedis, wizards, dragons, cyborgs and androids, Federation starships, armies of Elves, Daleks being blown up by weapons from Quake and Halo, and all sorts of other fantastical things. She merely served as a spectater to these events (she had long been trying to learn how to lucid dream so she could join in on the fun herself), though the epic sights was more than enough to make her happy.<br />
<br />
Aisha’s mind, while extremely bright and incredibly well-wired for stocks and financial advice, was still secretly quite “geeky”, though she had always hated the term being seen as a bad thing. If anything, she wanted to be proud of it. Let it go free. Talk with people about Game of Thrones or Black Mirror face to face outside of anonymous chat rooms. Go to comic book stores without saying she was buying action figures and graphic novels for her nephew (who didn’t exist). Be able to walk the streets wearing a T-Shirt with an obscure reference to a show from the 80s everyone had forgotten about but she had loved binge watching. Last night’s dream was a prime example of this: she was pent up and ready to burst in terms of what she found cool and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
However, her parents had always seen things like Star Trek and Lucasfilm as “distracting” and “wastes of time”. Aisha was the only person in her school whose parents never let her own a gaming device of any kind, and her backpack was always checked from middle to high school to make sure she was reading only the books bought for classes and not the works of C.S Lewis or Stephen King.<br />
<br />
Aisha loved her parents, and they loved her, but they were extremely strict and reigemental (which annoyed Aisha, who, being of Japanese descent, despised negative stereotypes being unfairly reinforced by a select few people). It was all Aisha could do to make sure her parents never saw her room, and always had to ask Mary to hide her collectibles, posters, games, and other possessions before they arrived for a visit (Mary, being the good friend she was, was always as careful as she could be with them to help them retain their mint value, even though she knew almost nothing about what that meant).<br />
<br />
Sighing, Aisha grabbed her phone, glasses, and large locket, and got dressed. She didn’t try to wear a bra, as none of them would fit, and instead wore a pair of grey panties by themselves. As it was the weekend and she wasn’t in a hurry to leave the house today, she put on soms pajama bottoms and a “Breaking Bad” shirt she had stuffed in the back of her closet, which very barely covered her breasts and left her navel exposed. She shrugged, figuring it was a small price to pay. She yawned, scratched her head, put her plushies back on the bed (give Togepi another, extra warm hug before setting it down) and walked out to the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Aisha walked into the kitchen, and heard the sound of bacon sizzling. She smiled, as bacon was her favorite breakfast food. She began to enter the room, when her mind suddenly put two and two together. Someone was in the kitchen besides her. She assumed it was Mary (this was confirmed by a soft voice singing “We Are The Champions” after a few seconds), and Aisha began thinking about what she would do. She physically couldn’t hide her new tits from her best friend, and she couldn’t spend the rest of her life avoiding her.<br />
<br />
She figured that, since Mary was going to find out sooner or later, she should just be honest with her about it. Aisha decided to prepare her ahead of time. “Hey, Mary? That you?”, she called out from behind the kitchen entrance. The voice stopped singing, and responded in a friendly tone. “Hey, Ash!” (Mary nickname for Aisha due to her friends’ obsession for Pokémon). “What’s up? I got some bacon and sausages here if you want- OH! Oh, yeah, by the way, thanks. About, uh, you know, cleaning up after me last night. The blanket and pillow was really just too sweet of you. I’m sorry, I just... I had a long day. I’m sure you did, too, but... I’m sorry. I’ll cut back on the beer. I promise.”<br />
<br />
Aisha smiled. She had initially been annoyed at her for getting drunk last night and leaving her mess behind. But Mary was a good friend, even if she was flawed. Her mind went back on track, and she continued to say what she was going to say. “Look, Mary? I... I don’t know how to tell you this, and don’t laugh or anything, but... Something happened last night?”<br />
<br />
Mary paused. “Okaaaaaay. Ash, is everything okay? Come on out, you’re making me nervous.” Aisha couldn’t help but chuckle. “Yeah! Yeah, I’m fine! Better than fine. It’s just, WEIRD, is all... Mary, my breasts are bigger.” Mary shrugged, although Aisha couldn’t see this from behind the wall. “Cool. So, like, what? You think some natural growth of your Moo-Moos is something I would laugh at? I’m happy for you, buddy!”<br />
<br />
Aisha chuckled, not knowing how Mary would react to the reality of the situation. She decided to walk in and show her as opposed to avoiding it any more. Mary turned around to face her friend, and stoped before she could get a word out. She looked down at them, eyebrows raised, jaw hanging open slightly. Aisha put out her hands jokingly. “Surprise!..... Um..... Want to go bra shopping at the mall with me today?”</p>
