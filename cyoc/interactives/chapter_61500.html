<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Are you sure you want to do this?”<br />
<br />
“You must be living in a dream world Jeff. Nothing like this is even remotely possibly. The only thing that this program is going to do is make a morph movie of me. It might be kind of I interesting to see what I would look like as a man.”<br />
<br />
“Is that what you think is going to happen? Well I don't know how to make a morph movie with this program. The instructions say that the program is self correcting and will not make any changes without the approval from the programmer which is me, I think.”<br />
<br />
“Well hurry up or we will miss the movie you were going to take me to tonight.”<br />
<br />
“Was that tonight? I was so into this new computer program that I forgot about our date tonight.”<br />
<br />
“If you think that I'm going to let you weasel out of our date tonight, you have another thing coming.”<br />
<br />
 He could never say no to Jennifer. “Sometimes she could be so demanding.” Jeff thinks to himself.  “If only this program could do half the things it says it does I would be really happy.” <br />
<br />
Jeff scanned the picture he picked into the computer. The chronivac computer program did a few quick calculations and quickly displayed a three dimensional rendering of the picture. Off to one side was a listing of body part measurements. Jessica didn't want to see the picture despite the encouragement from her boy friend. She wanted to be surprised. <br />
<br />
 “I wonder what she would look like if she had a body that every girl dreams that her boy friend should have.” Jeff said to himself looking at the picture. “I think I give her a little more than she is expecting by adding to the picture.”<br />
<br />
Jeff looked over measurements to see what he should change first. He scrolled over each measurement with his mouse. As each body part and number was highlighted a plus or minis appeared beside it. Jeff was amazed on how detailed the measurements were. It even listed personal information about the guy in the picture that Jeff didn'tthink was possible. It listed body fat to muscle mass, weight, height, sexual preferance and of course his penis size, both flaccid and erect. How could a computer program know that much about guy just by inputting his picture? Did this program connected to the internet by its self to get this information? I wonder if the same thing will happen when I scan Jessica.”<br />
<br />
Jessica was sitting on the bed patiently for Jeff to finish playing with the computer program. “Is this going to take much longer?”<br />
<br />
“All I have to do is put your picture in the program and start the process. The computer will do the rest.” Jeff didn’t tell Jessica that he had made changes to the first picture. &quot;I need you to stand overthere next to the closet door so I can get a clear image from the web cam that came with the program.”<br />
<br />
Jessica did what she was told for a change. Unknown to her, Jeff had already scanned Jessica's stats when she first entered his room. One of the changes that Jeff had made was to make her a little more submissive over the course of the transformation. Jeff could have made the transformation happen more quickly but he wanted the time to savor the moment.<br />
<br />
&quot;All I need to do is to start the program and the computer will do the rest.&quot; Jeff pushed a few more buttons and the computer came to life. <br />
<br />
A few questions appeared on the computer screen.<br />
<br />
 SUBJECT AWARENESS:  <br />
(ON) – (OFF) <br />
<br />
 Jeff click choose OFF. “I don’t want her to know that she is changing.” <br />
<br />
WORLD AWARENESS: <br />
(ON) – (OFF) <br />
<br />
Jeff clicked on OFF once again. “I can’t have anyone thinking everything was not normal, now to set the timer to complete the transformation during the movie.”<br />
<br />
“The program says it will take three hours to complete the computations.” Jeff told his girlfriend. <br />
<br />
“That will be just enough time for the movie and a quick dinner.” Jessica said to her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
Jeff lied to his girlfriend about the timer. He had set the timer for one hour. “By the time we get back from the movies we will see what you would look like if you were a guy.”<br />
<br />
Jessica and Jeff had gone to dinner before the movie. Normally Jessica was not a big eater but tonight her dining selection would make a sumo wrestler look anorexic fashion model. Jeff just sat there at their table, with a stunned look on his face, watching his girlfriend put away enough food to feed a NFL team. The more she ate the more confused he became. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you putting all that food?&quot; Jeff asked his girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? I've hardly eaten a thing all night long.&quot; Jessica said as she stuffs her mouth with more food than humanly possible. No one in the restaurant thought that the sight of a young lady devouring enormous amounts of food was unusual. The only person that saw what Jessica was really doing was Jeff. Her once trim figure was bloated with the food that she had just consumed. Her clothing was being stretched to its limit. <br />
<br />
Without trying to be too obvious Jeff watched as Jessica’s clothing became less feminine and more masculine. At the same time her body was going through similar transformation. The round curves became more angular. Shapely feminine hips slimmed down to thick manly hips with a rock hard striated ass. Her entire musculature looked like she had spent hours in the gym working out. The muscle separation over her entire body was getting more evident. Jeff could almost see her muscles grow bigger with each passing second. But her face still had the look of a female. Jeff could feel the blood collect in his groin as he watched his girl friend change. With all the willpower he could muster Jeff was barely able to keep his cock from becoming an embarrassing bulge in his own pants as they exited the restaurant. A half an hour later they were sitting in a darkened theater watching a movie.<br />
<br />
By Jeff's recollection the computer program had been running for about two hours. He remembered the program asking him how long the process should take. He had to act quickly before his girl friend caught on what he was doing. The movie didn't start for another hour an a half so a two hour competition time would have them inside a dark theater. That time was fast approaching.<br />
<br />
In the dark theater Jessica was cuddling up to Jeff as they watched the movie. Although he couldn't clearly see the final stages of the transformation but Jeff could feel the muscles grow on his girl friend. His imagination was going wild as he felt muscular shoulders growing bigger still. Three quarters of the way into the movie positions were reversed and a big muscular arm was now on Jeff's shoulders. Jeff reached over and put his hand into the crotch of the person beside him, what his hand found was a surprise.  <br />
<br />
In the dark things always feel bigger than they really are but what Jeff was feeling was mighty impressive. He tried to gauge how big it was but the further down he went the longer it got. Not only way it getting longer it was also getting thicker. When he grabbed a hand full of whatever it way he was feeling he heard a low deep moan from the person beside him. Whatever Jeff was holding began to pulse to a regular rythem. The person sitting next to him began to breath in time with the pulse. The building of the movies sound track towards the climatic ending did little to quail Jeff's attempt to find out what he was holding. In short increments he moved his hand along the elongating bulge. Each move was in time with the pulse. The further he went the faster both the pulse and breathing got. When Jeff reached the end of the elongated  bulge the breathing sounded like a mother on lab. Just when Jeff thought rapid breathing couldn't get any faster the breathing stopped, the pulsing stopped and the bulge got steel pipe hard. Not knowing what had just happened Jeff felt something warm and damp under his hand. At the same time there was a sigh of relief from the person next to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessie are you feeling ok?&quot; Jeff inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;You tell me, how do I feel to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
The deep voice from his left suprise Jeff. But what suprise him the most was a large hand landing his. When he tried to pull his hand away he found that he couldn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't go now, it was just beginning to feel real good.&quot; The voice said.<br />
<br />
It was at that point that Jeff realised what he had his hand on. Jeff tried a couple more times to pull his hand before the hand finally released its grip. He didn't know who the guy was but he wasn't about to get involved with pervert in a movie theater. At first he thought that he might have been sitting in the wrong seat when he left for a restroom break. Then he thought he might have returned to the wrong movie theater. After all at this was a multiplex theater and the movie was playing in more than one theater here.  Jeff got up to leave the theater when the stranger graded his. hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going Jeffie?&quot; The stranger says in a low voice so is not to disturb the rest of the movie goers. &quot;Don't you want to see the rest of the movie?&quot;<br />
<br />
Only two people ever dare to call him Jeffie. One his was his mother when he was little. The other was his girlfriend when they were alone. Jeff had forgotten about the computer program that he had running on his home computer. Did the program actually work and turn his girlfriend into his boyfriend? Jeff had to come up with something quickly to confirm that this was his transformed girlfriend. He did have his own private nick name for his girlfriend dare he use it?<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessie, is that you?&quot; Jeff said in a questionablely low tone of voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it isn't than you are taking the wrong guy to the movies.&quot; Jess told Jeff as he pulled him back into the seat. &quot;Which brings up a question of who is this Jessica person you keep talking about all evening. Are you seeing another &quot;person&quot; besides me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff could not see too much of the guy in the dark by his silhouette but what he could make out was big. He had to choose his next few words very careful. &quot;Do you think that I would ever see anybody else besides you Jessie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You had better not or I would be tempted to do something that we would both regret later.&quot;  To demonstrate his point the guy named Jess squeezes the hand he was still holding until Jeff flinces it pain.<br />
<br />
The pain was not that bad but the concept of what this guy named Jess might do was excepted by Jeff. The temperament of this guy was a close match to that of his girlfriend Jessica. Jeff was always able to talk her out of or into doing things. Was this the guy that the Chronovac had turned his girlfriend into? He had to get a better look at this guy but that would have to wait until after the movie is over.<br />
<br />
It was an agonizing twenty minutes before Jeff was able to see the results of the transformation, and he was not disappointed. Everything about the guy named Jessie was beyond perfection. The 3D rendering of the guy that he had seen on his computer at home had been altered slightly to reflect the looks of his girlfriend Jessica. His/her face was that of Jessica but more angular. He/she had deep blue eyes you could get lost in and a perfectly trimmed five-o-clock shadow. His/her hair was a blend of light brown with blonde highlights blended in. His/her height was just a few inches taller than six feet rather than the originals height of six foot six. The clothing that he/she now wore did little to hide their new muscularity. The white skin tight shirt was tissue paper thin showing their eraser size tits and the surrounding area. The sleeves of the shirt rode high on the arms forced up by the huge biceps and biceps. High atop the shoulders deltoids and trapezus gave the neck appearance of their owner had done many hours of shrugs. From the top of their massive pectoral muscles down to the lower abdominals, and every muscle between, the torso was beyond perfection. <br />
<br />
Jeff was beginning to throw a boner in his pants just looking at the new Jessie. When his field of vision took in lower body he lost all control. The bulge in his own pants was minuscule when compared to one in Jessie's. Although not as tight as the shirt the form fitting jeans were bulging with massive leg muscles. The thick material could not hide the fact that the occupant was definitely a man. The obscene bulge going down the inside of the right leg was topped by a similar huge fist sized bulge in the groin area. Despite the sizable bulge already there in the right leg there was still room for a muscular leg.<br />
<br />
Both legs were bulging with enough muscles for two normal sized males but normal was not what Jeff had programmed for Jessie. The hills and vallies. that made up normal muscular leg were mountain ranges on these legs. From the bulging tear drop muscle in front to the leg biceps in the back the thighs excreted  with power. In the rendering on his computer at home Jeff had given Jessica a striated muscular back side. Although the striations did not show through two distinct gluts did. On the way back to the parking garage Jeff trailed behind like a little pup. The once feminine walk that Jessica had at the beginning of the date was replaced with a very muscular masculine swagger. Wide shoulders and huge arms swung front to back to counter the movement of the equally large legs.<br />
<br />
Jeff was so lost in the perfection that he had created that he forgot where he was and started to stroke his own boner in public as he walk.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jessie, do you feel any different tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, why? Do I look any different to you?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well  . . . . no but don't you ever feel like you are living a lie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok what did you do this time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well   . . . .  I ah . . . . have this program at home and I ah  . . . kinda got carried away with and I ah . . . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Spit it out  . . . .  what did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-turned-you-a-muscle-guy-during-movie-tonight.&quot; Jeff blurted very quickly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck are you talking about? Nobody can turn anybody into a muscle guy in just a few hours. It takes years to get body like this.&quot; To prove his point Jessie did a few impromptu poses for Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;In not so many words that is what you said a few hours.&quot; Jeff told his newly transformed &quot;boy&quot; friend. &quot;If you don't believe me than come back to my house. I will show you the program running on my computer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You might want to wait til we get home before you do that hon.&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Huh?&quot; Jeff quickly realised what he was doing but it was too little too late to stop what he had started. His painfully hard boner shot its load down his right pant leg creating an equally embarrassing long wet spot down to his ankle. “Oh Man!”<br />
<br />
Jessie looked back at his traveling companion with discuss. “If you are going to shoot your load every time you look at me I’m not going out with you again.”</p>
