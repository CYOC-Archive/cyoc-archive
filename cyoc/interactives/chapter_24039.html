<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>In a panic, Jake ran into the bathroom and draped a large white towel around his ... her body. She shook her head; what had just happened to her was crazy!</p>

<p>Her heart raced as she dashed down the stairs to get help. She stopped when she saw something even more shocking. She looked at the pictures that lined the walls heading down the stairs. The ones that included her all had a female anthro skunk in her place! In fact, her parents and sister were also anthro skunks!</p>

<p><i>What ... what's going on?</i> Jake reached her right hand out and touched the picture of her when she'd graduated high school. <i>Damn, she looks gorgeous in that gown. What about her looks familiar? It's like I remember trying it on as a skunkette!</i> Shaking her head, Jake removed her hand and then looked at a picture of the skunkette her and her friend Gabe. The young man was still human but now Jake was seeing him not as a friend she'd known since they were in the 3rd grade but as a friend she'd later asked out on a date.</i></p>

<p>Jerking her hand back, Jake gasped. She'd remembered that time she and Gabe had egged a bully's house when she and Gabe were in the 7th grade. Or at least, she thought she did. Now, she remembered the bully had picked on Gabe and she'd sprayed the bully. She remembered his scream and the stentch as the musk had struck him. He'd never picked on them since that. She'd felt terrible about it but knew that it was self defense and that he'd given her little choice.</p>

<p>In her 'other' life, the bully ended up robbing a liquor store in their Senior year in High School. He'd been caught and ended up in jail. Now, that spraying had taught him a lesson and ironically, he'd gone on to study law at University. Jake becoming a female skunk had improved the life of at least one person.</p>

<p>Jake again looked at the picture of Gabe. She felt something different about him. Now, instead of feeling a bond that friends tended to have, she felt love for him. He was more then just a boyfriend. They wern't engaged ... not yet anyway.</p>

<p><i>But if I was always this way then why do I remember being a guy. Do I remember?</i> She did remember but it was like trying to remember a dream. She was still Jake, no not Jake. In her mind, that name didn't quite stick; her name was Jackie. She <i>was</i> still Jackie. Her experiences were mostly the same, she just experienced them as a female anthro skunk.</p>

<p>Jackie looked at some other pictures, each time, new memories triggering other new memories. Instead of running downstairs, she walked back into her room to consider her situation. When she arrived in her room, it too had changed. She haden't noticed it before because she was too panicked. Now however, there were differences. Her bed was in the same place, but the sheets were gray rather then black. She looked through her drawers, somehow knowing what was in them and where. All of her clothes were lighter. Somehow, she knew that went better with her black and white fur.</p>

<p>She noticed a bottle of perfume on her dresser. Before, it had been cologne and a gift from Gabe. Now, it was a gag gift he'd given her. He'd always preferred her natural musk. Seeing it brought back happy memories. In fact, just thinking about the lad made her happy. She looked at her bed. Before, she'd always slept alone. Now, she remembered her first night sleeping with Gabe just two years ago. Her parents were away for the week and seemed all right with it. Jackie had assumed that they were going to say so long as they didn't have sex. But instead, they told Gabe and Jackie that since they were both adults that it was okay but they would be responsible for any consequences. Jackie and Gabe haden't of had sex, but they did sleep together. Now she remembered his skin against her soft fur. His fur body against hers. The memory made her body respond in a way that she knew was pleasurable.</p>

<p>Jackie dried herself off and wondered what she was going to do. Reality had been altered or had it? Was she always like this and just hallucinating that she wasen't. Could she truly know if her memories of being human and male were genuine, implanted or delusions? Even if reality had changed and she was getting memories of the new reality, was she worse off?</p>

<p>That bully was doing much better now. Jackie felt loved by Gabe where before they were just friends. It was a sensation she savored. Did she want to do something to change things back?</p>

<p>As one final check, Jackie opened her desk drawer and pulled out her year book. She flipped to her picture to see that yes, indeed she was still a skunkette. She then flipped to the back and saw Gabe's comment to her. He still used the same joke but now instead of a happy face, it had a heart beside it.</p>

<p>Jackie wondered what she should do next.</p></p>
