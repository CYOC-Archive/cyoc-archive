<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was an interesting walk for Mark to watch Aidan. Whenever Aidan felt unobserved, he would grimace at his clothes, and the smell and taste from the socks. Just like in his flat, Aidan´s shoes were slippery to him, and every step he took it splashed and slurped in them. Then there was the taste of his pacifier-sock, tasting like a combination of shit and sweat with a hint of cum. It was disgusting, but it was his tick after all, so he wouldn´t complain. And then there was his now wet face, as he had just rubbed his bib over his nose, intensifying the smell of his own piss he smelled the whole time.<br />
Mark laughed more than once about Aidan, but every time he redirected it to something around them, letting Aidan think he didn´t laugh at him.<br />
When they reached their uni, they separated to their own courses. The day was hard for Aidan. With his tick to use his sock-gloves as masturbation aid every evening, they now were rather stiff from his dried cum, making his work harder. He couldn´t grab his brushes and pencils as easily as he had before, not that he knows that. It was hard for him in general, after all.<br />
Mark´s day was more boring than anything else. It wasn´t that the topic was bad or unimportant, it was just Mark was more focused on his new toy and his primary target, Aidan, to concentrate on it. How could he make even more fun out of Aidan? What could he make Aidan do to even more resemble a baby? And what other ideas could be used, maybe on others? His annoying younger brother Chris or maybe that guy who always irritated him in classes, Luke?<br />
He collected a few ideas on a paper he had in front of him, beside his laptop where he was to gather information about their lesson. Not that there was much typed down on it today. The sheet of paper, on the other hand, was filling with ideas, but not much for Aidan. He had many ideas, but they wouldn´t fit with the baby theme Aidan had right now. And even if he could make more reset triggers for Aidan, that wouldn´t raise his fun about it. Only one idea struck him for Aidan right now.<br />
As he checked up Aidan´s profile, he was surprised that the program had even a list of his added reset triggers set, with everything setting them apart from the “back-up” the chronivac had created at the very beginning. Having another idea to make only Aidan´s mind, but not anything else change back, he added two new commands, working as short-cuts for specific reset triggers.<br />

Fooling everyone at not being disgusted by own habits<br />
“Reawake Aidan” - Aidan´s mind turns back, everything else remain the same <br />
“Submerge Aidan” - Aidan´s mind returns to the last active mindset<br />
<br />
Mark intercepted Aidan on his way into the cafeteria, steering him outside instead. “Hey, Mark, I wanted to get something to eat.” Aidan protested, but Mark didn´t bother with that, just taking the pacifier-sock out of Aidan´s hand before shoving it back inside his mouth, stifling his protest. Even if he got another idea from it.<br />
Reaching the quieter, more secluded area of the park opposite the uni, Mark finally stopped pulling Aidan, who quickly complained again about being hungry. “Okay, I get it, you are hungry. Should I let you eat a bit of the grass around us?” Mark said sarcastically.<br />
Aidan stopped his complains, looking disgusted. “That´s gross, Mark. For one, I don´t eat grass, I´m not a cow or a goat. Second, we wouldn´t know if a dog or another animal pissed on it. Gross.”<br />
Mark rolled his eyes at that. Just for that, he would normally let Aidan eat grass, but it wasn´t fitting to his role as a baby. Like he said, it would be more fitting for animals. But as he himself had nothing to eat with him, he would have to improvise something. Opening his laptop and the chronivac on it, he ripped out a few blades of grass and gave them to Aidan. “Let´s try if the chronivac can make them become something eatable, then. What do you want to have?” Mark asked, grinning. It would be the last thing Aidan would eat normally he decided.<br />
Aidan looked unsure if that would work, but the idea was good. He wouldn´t need to buy food anymore, just collect something to make it eatable. “Okay, but I hope it doesn´t still taste like grass afterwards. How about a hamburger and some fries then?”<br />
Mark laughed at that. “You could try out anything and choose that? Okay, let´s see if it works.” It was a bit tricky to find the blades of grass with the program, but changing them afterwards was easy. Soon, Aidan was happily eating his hamburger, while Mark made himself the same. He could still make something else later.<br />
With a satisfied sigh, Aidan asked after both had finished their meals: “Was there a reason for you to pull me out here? Or was it just for that test with the program?”<br />
Mark chuckled at him. As there wasn´t anyone nearby, he was safe to make a new change that he had thought when Aidan complained of being hungry. “There was another reason. Would you like some dessert while I explain it, Aidan?” To underlie the question, Mark ripped another few blades of grass out.<br />
Aidan thought about it, but quickly decided: “Yes, I think a dessert would be nice. Can you make it some ic…” He stopped short as Mark clapped his hands, dropping the grass when he did.<br />
Before Aidan could think further about it, not that he would remember what he wanted, Mark grinned evilly at him, replacing the answer with his own: “You want your normal dessert, right? Which would be a nice load of cum, right? You know how you get it, right, Aidan?”<br />
It was absolutely mean and had nothing to do with being a baby, but that would come later in a way. Aidan´s eyes cleared from the confusion Mark´s clapping had brought him, and Aidan nodded. “Yes, you are right. Mark, am I allowed to suck you off to get my dessert?” he then asked him.<br />
Mark petted Aidan´s head as he answered: “You know, I wouldn´t have asked if you weren´t allowed to, right? Yes, you are allowed to suck me off.”<br />
Aidan was quick to loosen Mark´s belt, pulling down his jeans and boxers, and started sucking immediately. Mark moaned as Aidan massaged his balls while he sucked, giving him the best blow-job he ever had. It didn´t take him long to give Aidan his dessert, who happily swallowed the whole load before sitting back, sighing satisfied. But Mark could see some deep sitting disgust in Aidan´s eyes. While Mark had made it Aidan´s favorite dessert, he didn´t really like to drink cum.<br />
Now there was only one thing left to do right now. As he had already decided that this had been Aidan´s last normal meal, he would simply have to replace the rest now. “Say, Aidan, do you know how to eat?”<br />
Aidan looked at him in confusion for that moronic question, but was still forced to answer: “Of cour…” But Mark stomped his foot on the ground, erasing that from Aidan´s mind as well.<br />
“No, you never learned to eat normal food, as you never chew on anything. So, you have stopped trying after nearly suffocating three times. You only drink things, right?” Mark explained, filling the just ripped gap in Aidan´s mind.<br />
Aidan accepted that like every time Mark edited his memories as the truth, simply throwing out what connected to it indirectly. So, while before he had just lost his ability to eat normally, the comment that he only drunk things erased the various foods he had eaten out of his mind. Only if that food could be liquidized it stayed, if vaguely. “Yeah, you are right Mark. I only drink things, as I nearly died trying to eat more solid things.” That he just minutes ago had eaten a hamburger with fries was now a shake with said taste, nothing more.<br />
Just to test it, Mark changed one of the dropped blades of grass into an apple, giving it to Aidan. “Why do you give me an apple, Mark? I just said I can´t eat solid things like this.” Was his immediately answer.<br />
Mark, in turn, started to laugh. That worked perfect. “It´s okay, Aidan. I just want you to keep it for me then. Or you make a drink out of it later, you know?” Mark replied after calming down. Aidan accepted that answer, and soon they headed back to the uni for their later classes.</p>
