<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A few hours have passed after the heated discussion of Anija and Vaestro against Adam&#39;s ruling, luckily as Elisa promised to Luka, she arrived to the kingdom of her brother with the ships, after a heartbreaking reunion between her and Adam, the two of them discussed about their kingdoms, Adam told Elisa about the heated dicussion he had with Anija and Vaestro, as she heared Anija&#39;s name being spelled out she instantly smilled, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t ignore the words from such a wise dragon as Anija silly!&quot; said Elisa with her cheerful voice, her brother told her about how many problems the kingdom had, he even doubted his ruling during the discussion, &quot;I should&#39;ve given the throne to Luka...&quot; said Adam with sadness in his voice, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, i will help you ruling it.&quot; said Elisa, the two of them quickly shared their ideas, most of the ideas Elisa gave to him were either unused or unthought to be used in Adam&#39;s kingdom, at first Adam thought that most of the ideas had no sense, but as Elisa explained them to him, he quickly changed his thoughts.<br />
<br />
While the two rulers were dicussing ideas about the kingdom, Luka has given birth to two beautiful Kinins, both of them were males, although the pain she felt while giving birth was awful, it payed of well as she held the two Kinin newborns, &quot;They look so beautiful lady Luka!&quot; one of the healers said, two healers were always present with Luka, incase any problem occurs, the healer that complemented the children of Luka came from Elisa&#39;s kingdom, an experienced and emphatetic healer, meanwhile the other healer barely entered the private nursery room Luka was in, bringing Karyu along, who had a worried face before entering the room, but as he entered it, a beautiful smile appeared on his scaly lips, he slowly went towards his rider, nuzzling her while also taking a glance at his two children, the two newborns looked alike, Karyu noticed that the newborns didn&#39;t present any draconic scales or horns, the only thing that was unnatural for a newborn was the fact that their nails were much longer, almost clawlike.<br />
Eventually the newborns felt the presence of their father, giving short giggles as they attempted to touch Karyu&#39;s face, by just feeling the tiny hands stroking his vermilion scales, Karyu smiled, he never felt so happy in his life, he mostly thanked Anija, who teached many secrets of healing magic to the healers of Adam&#39;s kingdom, by just sharing his wisdom, Anija saved multiple lives.<br />
<br />
Speaking of Anija, he slowly flew towards the study of the castle, he was rudely interrupted as a wave of pain struck his back, &quot;Argh!&quot; shouted Anija as another pair of feathered wings bursted out, with small details of gold at the tips, most of the feathers around Anija&#39;s body disapeared, while also retaining the appearance of an eastern drake, almost making him look like a quetzalcoatl, his horns also changed, almost looking as if a halo was connected around them and the natural color of his horns changed also into a shining gold, his claws also suffered the same pigmentation as his horns, his medalion still stood intact dangling around his neck, but there was something odd, the magic of the medallion was..... Gone? Anija gave a confused look as he touched the medalion, at first it had a silvery white color but now it had a rusted metal color, questions filled his mind as he realized something, the magic that filled the medallion became one with him, he was now permanently an angelic eastern dragon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I seriously need to learn more about this.&quot; Said Anija, by just being turned into an angelic drake, he felt his magical powers surging, he could still control them but... They were completly diffrent, almost suiting his desires of helping, Anija scrambled over the bookshelves, searching for any piece of information that could explain to him the traits of angelic dragons or the history of the medallion. After minutes of searching, Anija found two books containing the story of the medallion and the traits of rare species of dragons, including the angelic ones.<br />
<br />
Anija swiped left and right through the pages of a book containing ancient artifacts, there were many of them, the Crystal of Apollyon that is said to be the heart of the last demonic dragon, the Blade of Nature that is said to be the claw of a fae dragon, and last but not least, the Medallion of Eternal Chastity, the same object that turned Anija into an angelic dragon. According to the book, it said that the medallion belonged to an angelic dragoness named Lucina, it was said that she was hunted down by a clan of heretics severly wounding her, in her last moments walking through the land of the living, Lucina placed her medallion in the center of a dead forest and filled it with her magic, making the forest spring to life, a legend said that if any dragon touches the sacred medallion, that certain dragon will be reborn as the &#39;Angelic Dragon of Mercy&#39;.<br />
<br />
Lastly, Anija opened the book containing the species of dragons, quickly stumbling into the species he currently was, the book said that angelic dragons were the children of the goddess Aset, angelic dragons are listed as the most rare dragon species in the world, mostly because they were almost exctinct, due to the unnatural number of hunters that killed them in the hopes that they could harvest the feathers and horns of the angelic dragons, since it&#39;s told that they bring long life and fortune to anyone possessing them, this made Anija shudder a little, most of the time angelic dragons are depicted as feminine eastern dragons with horns that resembled halos and a pale white coloration of the scales.<br />
Anija quickly stumbled upon the powers of angelic dragons, this made him shocked as he saw the powerful supportive abilities angelic dragons had. Blessings, unnatural talent for fire and light magic, accelerated regeneration from wounds or infections, the ability to heal any disease and the ability to almost fufill any wish involving health. It was said that anyone who possesses an angelic dragon was an immortal, that it always had a guardian always by their side.<br />
While reading the list of powers, Anija also stumbled upon the powers that were also possessed by fae, angelic and demonic dragons. The ability to switch genders with just a twelve hour restriction while swapping genders and the ability to switch from a quadrupedal stance to a human stance, although retaining the dragon form. Anija heared of those types of forms, they were named &#39;Anthros&#39;, it was said that it could be the result when a female human mage was mated with a male dragon, he heard that many dragons despise those forms, although some of them used them to either feel somewhat human, in some rich kingdoms, most of the dragons were forced to learn a spell that painfully turns them into &#39;Anthros&#39; with a mana backlash that took about thirty years to recover, luckily for angelic dragons such as Anija, the time taken for him to switch from feral to almost human is only five years, he saw some dragons in that form when he was in Aquaria, they were most likely forced to use it.</p>
