<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty sat in the middle of a balloon massacre. Pieces of June littered nearly everything in every direction. In horror, Ty wondered what might happened if... he had killed her.<br />
<br />
No, musn&#39;t think like that, he closed his eyes. He willed June to come back.<br />
<br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
The shards of latex flesh remained unaltered. His gut sank horribly.<br />
<br />
He willed June to turn back into her normal self.<br />
<br />
Nothing. The shards didn&#39;t respond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no...&quot; Ty whimpered. He gulped and suddenly felt like he was sitting in the middle of a crime scene. Pieces of body everywhere.<br />
<br />
He concentrated as hard as he could. If he couldn&#39;t just turn her back, he reasoned, it might be because she was all broken up. He willed June to go back together.<br />
<br />
He felt the familiar warmth and opened his eyes. Something was happening!<br />
<br />
A million pieces of latex began to squirm and writhe as they came to life. The carpet seemed to begin moving, an all together unpleasant sight, as all the latex seemed to steam and liquify into goo at once.<br />
<br />
Ty gulped. He had no idea what was going on. He didn&#39;t dare move.<br />
<br />
The individual slugs of latex began to slither toward each other. One blob joined with another to form a larger piece. The larger piece joined with other smaller bits. The little pieces swarmed into each other from every direction. Behind the couch, on top of the TV, over by the coat rack. It was fascinatingly disturbing. Soon enough, a massive undulating blob of orange patchy putty had formed, equivilent to what a one foot tall giraffe would have been.<br />
<br />
Ty stared as the shapeless blob undulated towards him and paused, wriggling oddly.<br />
<br />
&quot;J-June?&quot; Ty gulped.<br />
<br />
The blob responded, a tendril pulling out from the main mass and approximating a head looking up, although bizarre and shapeless. It nodded slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God.&quot; Ty reached forward, scooping up the mass of soft putty like giraffe and hugging it to his chest. &quot;I thought you... I thought I killed you.&quot;<br />
<br />
The mass burbled oddly, and snuggled into Ty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank God.&quot; The teen sighed in relief. He looked down at the little mass in his hands and blinked. She was... literal putty in his hands. He felt his boner coming back and smiled slyly.<br />
<br />
He began squeezing and shaping her in his hands. She seemed to like this, oozing between his fingers, trembling as he rolled her out and squashed her back together. He pulled her into a ball, rolled her around in his palms, and then experimentally squashed her into a pancake. She began to pulled back into a mass again. Ty grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can... can you reshape yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
June approximated a shrug as best an anmorphus blob of giraffe putty could. She seemed to vibrate. Four points emerged from her &#39;sides&#39; ... legs!<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow! Keep going!&quot; Ty encouraged, delighted. &quot;You&#39;re doing it!&quot;<br />
<br />
A little stem grew from her &#39;back&#39; ... a tail. Well, the start of a tail. She pressed again and a longer strand shot from her front. It pulled up and stretched out into a tube. Her body lost mass as she tried to thin herself out. Her &#39;legs&#39; grew longer. Her neck stretched taller. A sagging &#39;head&#39; drooped above her neck.<br />
<br />
Apparently the effort was quite taxing. She let herself fall in Ty&#39;s hand and gathered her strength. He watched in utter fascination.<br />
<br />
June tried again. She pressed herself out. Her legs began to gain shape and definition back. Her neck followed suit, as did her tail. Soon they were recognizable as her body began to pull in and barrel out from a shapeless mass in Ty&#39;s hand. Her eye balls popped back from within, staring up at Ty from a barely formed snout. She closed them, concentrating hard, and pressed with all of her might. Her head snapped back to shape, droopy, but clearly a giraffe. Her horns splayed to either side of her head and she couldn&#39;t keep her ears up. Meanwhile, her body was shaping. Big proud front chest, firm little tummy. Her hips swelled back, her legs continued to lengthen. But she was very much soft putty and holding the shape was intensely hard.<br />
<br />
Ty decided this was enough, and tried to will her back into flesh and bone. No dice. She wouldn&#39;t change, and he suspected, wouldn&#39;t until she was at least a shape again. So he had to get her back to a giraffe state.<br />
<br />
She held her shape admirably, but the moment she tried to stand up her legs buckled in Ty&#39;s hand and she splattered down into his palm and began melting back into nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Well, bad news is you&#39;re stuck like this until we can firm you up a little. C&#39;mere, let&#39;s see if we can fix that.&quot;<br />
<br />
The familiar blue eyes remained on the front of the mass as June relaxed and melted back into a pile of goo. He carried her over to the kitchen and set her down on the counter while he fetched a rolling pin. June watched with interest as Ty grabbed some starch from the cupboard. It was obvious what was about to happen to her. Sure, why not?<br />
<br />
Ty looked down at the patchy mess staring up at him and shrugged. &quot;Well, do you have a better idea?&quot;<br />
<br />
She shook her &#39;head&#39; no.<br />
<br />
Ty proceeded to pour a healthy amount of starch over the goo his step mom had become and proceeded to carefully squish her togther and kneed it in. As he had hoped, she began to lose her runniness. He kneeded more in, and was startled as he wound up with a fairly firm lump of giraffe patterned rubbery elasticated something.<br />
<br />
June&#39;s eyes popped back in and she blinked several times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try again.&quot; Ty whispered.<br />
<br />
June did so, pressing herself back to shape, and found it much easier this time. Soon enough, she was sprouting legs again, slowly building herself back into a giraffe shape. It was working! She was holding! She built up, struggling to get herself back into shape, and began to emerge again. Legs, body, neck, ears, tail, hooves, horns. Everything firmed up to its proper proportions. She was a giraffe again! Admittedly, a little starchy goo giraffe, but she was now firm enough to at least stand on wobbly legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Try walking!&quot; Ty suggested.<br />
<br />
June the goo giraffe nodded, unable to speak just yet, and tried to walk forward. It felt weird. She was still viscous, and she almost pitched forward and splattered on the counter. Her legs stretched abnormally long, the weight of her hooves pulling her, and she scrambled not to fall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, man, I really messed you up, didn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
The giraffe looked up at Ty, annoyed, and nodded very firmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, we&#39;ll get you back.&quot;<br />
<br />
He tried to will June back to flesh, and was relieved as he felt the twinge. The little giraffe on the counter suddenly jolted, crackled, and let out a gasp of relief, panting, neck pulling down, as she turned back into fur, flesh, and bone again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God!&quot; She panted, in her cute little high pitched voice. &quot;You absolute freak! Do you have any idea how fucked up that was to pop like the fucking balloon I was?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, no...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kind of turned me on.&quot; She admitted, looking away meekly. &quot;Like... the ultimate orgasm. Explosion. Just... pow! Gone!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe we can...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; The giraffe stomped her front hoof on the counter. &quot;Never again!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sure.&quot; Ty rolled his eyes. &quot;Like you have a choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So now what?&quot; Little June the giraffe looked up. &quot;It&#39;s morning, sun is up, Mark is still sleeping. I&#39;m once again a tiny giraffe.&quot;</p>
