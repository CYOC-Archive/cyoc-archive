<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">October’s mother stood there, trying as hard as she could to resist the curse, but as a mortal her will was not strong enough. Her hands, like a magnet to another, were being pulled to the selection of 3 products.<br />
<br />
The Red Coloured Potion<br />
The Apple<br />
The Grey Coloured Potion<br />
<br />
Mandy saw the Apple, it looked perfect, it was probably some kind of trick, the grey potion looked too dull to be nothing, Mandy looked at the Red potion. It looks like cola, maybe it was just cola. It seemed like the best option she could see so she picked it.<br />
<br />
She held the potion in her hand, she was shaking. She’d allowed October to control her before but this was different, it wasn’t October directly controlling her. It was a different experience. She lifted the liquid to her lips, it touched her lips. It even fizzed a little bit like cola. She poured half of it into her mouth. It didn’t taste like cola though. It tasted like... well it wasn’t a taste Mandy had ever had before. She was tempted to spit it out, but she couldn’t do that. Not that she didn’t want to, she physically couldn’t. She couldn’t even try and understand the taste of it before she swallowed it. She placed the cup back where she found it. Only half of it was left.<br />
<br />
She stood there, expecting something to happen, but nothing did. She shrugged it off, maybe it was just a drink. She grabbed the glasses and bottles she was taking up the stairs. She made her way up and entered the kitchen where Sorin was seated, reading a book. He looked back at her and smiled, then returned to his book.<br />
<br />
Mandy made her way to the sink where she planned to clean the glass’ and bottles. She walked past where Sorin was seated, he looked up from his book and gave her a weird glare. She turned around,<br />
“What’s wrong?” She said, looking down at him. He got up from his seat and looked up at her, she looked down at him, “Sorin, is something...” then she realised. She was looking down at him.<br />
<br />
Sorin had always been around two inches taller than her, so they usually were around the same eye level, Sorin looked at his wife’s legs, they were longer, her torso was longer too, even her arms had stretched to match her proportions.<br />
<br />
“You’re taller. You must be like six feet tall!” He looked her up and down, “hold on,” he snapped his fingers, a measuring tape appeared in mid air surrounded by a red mist, he waved his hand and it moved to the top of her head, it flicked all the way down to her feet, he looked at the measurements. She wasn’t six feet tall, she was six foot seven. Sorin only knew one person nearly as tall as her, and that person was an actual giant!<br />
<br />
“Well...” she said, “how tall am I now?” She said, the slightest amount of worry in her voice,<br />
“You’re six foot seven,”<br />
“Oh my god!” She yelled,<br />
“No no! Honey I can fix this, let me find the source of this,”<br />
“I know what the source is,” she said, “it was a drink in October’s basement room,”<br />
“Why did you drink a random potion...”<br />
“October has a curse on that room, you didn’t see but just last week I grew a monkey’s tail,”<br />
<br />
“I’ll go have a look downstairs and see if I can fix anything,”<br />
<br />
Mandy watched as her husband headed down the stairs to October’s basement. While she was six foot seven though, she did want to admire it, so she headed over to a nearby full body mirror. They were all over the house because of October.<br />
<br />
She looked at herself, she sure was tall, her legs were so long, but for some reason they weren’t as slim as she remembered. In fact, they looked a little chubbier than they did last time she checked.<br />
Mandy looked herself up and down. Her body looked a little bigger, but it wasn’t fat. It was muscle. Her legs were meaty, her arms were large and muscular. Her neck was thicker too, her thin waist was larger too. And as she was looking at herself. She was still growing. She looked herself in the eyes, she saw her nose growing bigger. It grew longer out front and wider on the sides. Her head was getting bigger too. Growing in all angles. Now she was freaking out.<br />
<br />
Her lips were puffing up bigger too, she poked it. Then she saw her hand. It must’ve been almost twice it’s original size. It looked fairly normal on her massive arms. Her massive arms!? She looked as not only did the muscle grow, but they looked chubbier. She looked at her legs, they were the same, thicker than ever, chubby as hell. She looked at her feet as they burst out of her shoes. They were definitely double their original size.<br />
<br />
Her breasts were growing too, they were getting so much bigger that they were beginning to sag, but not long after her belly caught up with them and lifted them up. Her belly grew bigger and bigger, filling more and more, of her shirt. Her breasts burst a button right off them, it hit a glass on the counter and smashed it to bits.<br />
<br />
“Mom, are you okay?” Mandy heard October call from up the stairs,<br />
<br />
Mandy felt as her hips broadened and her butt grew giant. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her eyebrows grew thicker, they connected in a uni brow, her chin was now huge, her lips were so big that they almost drooped down. Mandy’s eyes were also bigger, the bags under her eyes had swollen just like the rest of her body. Her hair also grew, in all places. She saw the outline of her vagina get larger. Swollen and thick just like the rest of her body.<br />
<br />
Mandy was pretty sure it was over. She looked herself over. She looked awful. She was ugly. She was fat, she was too muscular, her face was huge in every place. Her body looked like an overinflated mess.<br />
She was awful looking.<br />
She was ugly.<br />
<br />
“Mandy!” A voice yelled from down the stairs. She attempted to make it to the stairs. Strangely for her unnatural size, she didn’t find walking too difficult. She made it to the stairs and tried to get down them. After the first couple steps she tripped and fell. Tumbling down until she arrived at the bottom. She looked up.<br />
<br />
In front of her, a much taller version of her husband. He was bloated and large like her. The only exception to him was that he didn’t have giant breasts, and his dick’s outline was huge. What was worse, he was still growing. <br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
“Yeah dad?” October yelled across the house, she looked around. They weren’t anywhere to be seen. She saw the door to her basement was wide open. She hated it when people left it open, as she went to close it, she heard movement from inside. She hesitated, nobody should be down there.<br />
<br />
She summoned a dagger and held it behind her back as she made her way, slowly, down the steps. As she turned at the end she saw the backsides of two people she didn’t know.<br />
She quickly drew the dagger and pointed it in self defence, “who the heaven are you two?” She said, angrily,<br />
<br />
“Look who finally arrived,” the one on October’s left said, it turned around. The one next to it turned too.<br />
<br />
“Mom? Dad!?” October yelled,<br />
“Look what you did to us!” Sorin shouted at her, his voice was slightly warped,<br />
“I- I didn’t do this to you... I told you not to come down here!”<br />
“Yes but you cursed the place, you know we can’t resist the curses you set,”<br />
“I know, but I did tell you, didn’t I?”<br />
“Listen here, young lady,” Sorin began, “you are grounded until you fix us, and then you’re grounded for a week after that!”<br />
“But this isn’t my fault!”<br />
“We don’t care,” Sorin said, sternly, “you must fix us!”<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
October was up late that night, looking through books on how to fix this kind of potions effect. But since it was a failed potion, there wasn’t anything she could find to fix it. Her parents looked like trolls. No, goblins. No...<br />
<br />
It was hopeless. She threw the book at the wall of her tower bedroom. <br />
<br />
That’s when she remembered.</p>
