<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was eleven-thirty-ish when Bobby pulled his Ford Escort into Colleen's drive.  He awkwardly clamored out of the car, grimacing as he did so.  Bobby wore his tightest pair of jeans with his largest, heaviest pair of boxers crammed inside and bulging out anywhere they could.  His unsightly fashion choice was hidden as much as he could hope by a long t-shirt.  By packing his crotch as full as possible Bobby hoped that he could make it impossible for himself to get an erection.  It was certainly impossible for him to sit for very long without bruising.  He made his way to the front door only to have find Colleen coming out to meet him.<br />
<br />
Colleen, virtually bouncing with joy, ran up and hugged Bobby, smooshing her breasts deep into his chest.  He had to admit that she looked good today.  Her hair pulled back into a simple pony-tail allowed her magically enhanced beauty to glow into the overcast day.  She wore a large fluffy sweat-shirt that hid most of her curves and a pair of stretch workout pants that did the opposite.  Her pert curvy but wiggled and bounced as she hopped into Bobby's car ahead of him.  He tried to follow as quickly as he could; his pants seemed a little tighter and he thought he was sweating down there.<br />
<br />
The Mall, he thought, this is such a bad idea.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so glad you could drive me today,&quot; Colleen said smiling.  &quot;Ever since the prom I have had, like, no bras that could fit me anymore.  And a good deal of my pants just slide right off now.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was more that Colleen said but Bobby was trying very hard to concentrate on the road.  All her talk about her body and ill-fitting clothes kept trying to draw his mind back to the last thing that he wanted.  Forcing his thoughts to wander Bobby was interrupted a few minutes later by Colleen swearing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it, Bobby, listen to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you're not listening to me then I'm just babbling and that makes my lips grow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bobby took his eyes off the road for a moment to look at his girl-friend.  Her lips did appear a little fuller.  &quot;Is that going to be a problem, C?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don't want them to get too big.  If they get too big then I will look stupid.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, I have to listen to your chatter just so you don't look funny?  Why don't you just stay quiet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen decided to not respond to that but she did commence pouting.  Bobby knew he would pay for that later but he was thankful to be able to finish the drive without being distracted by sexiness.<br />
<br />
-----------------<br />
<br />
The mall was buzzing with activity.  Summer had arrived and people were out to shop.  Colleen dragged Bobby by the hand through the crowd and up the escalator into one of the many trendy clothiers.  It was quiet er in here than the corridor and at the moment Bobby and Colleen were the only ones there.  Women's pants covered one wall and tops the opposite one.  A mannequin or two filled the windows at the front with particular outfits that anyone would love to wear.  The naked girl behind the counter was covering her tits with her hands.  At the back of the boutique was where the bras and panties were located.  Along with the changing rooms and the large posters of lingerie models.<br />
<br />
Colleen was dragging Bobby to that area now.  In a moment Bobby found himself regretting his pants choice.  Wincing, he was starting to regret his gender.  Slumping into a chair he tried to go into a coma.<br />
<br />
Colleen took the time to search through every bra on every rack.  She gabbed a little with the store clerk and Bobby was inching ever closer to unconsciousness.  After a while Colleen had two hands-full of items and made her way to the changing room.  Now alone Bobby was trying to prevent his eyes fixating on all the lacy and stretchy bits of clothing that surrounded him.<br />
<br />
His attention was eventually drawn to the sound of the store clerk moving through the racks near him.  She peered over one rack at Bobby, the only thing he could see was her head and neck.  She was brunette and had the glowing tanned skin that was same as everyone else that had been at the prom.  Searching his memory Bobby soon found the name that fit the girl even if the girl no longer fit her class-photo.  Sandra, like all her classmates was, now a stunning beauty, courtesy of Loki.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you still awake back there?&quot;  Sandra called out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe,&quot;  Bobby answered.  &quot;I think I may have finally found the best way to die; being buried in woman's panties.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sandra laughed a delightful little titter.  &quot;You would be surprised how many men get stuck in that specific chair for hours with nothing to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, at least it is a comfortable chair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is all a part of consumer science.  Like the lighting, the music and the smell of the store; the comfort of the chairs that men have to sit in are all designed to make the women buy as much as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I am nothing more that a rat in a cage, huh?&quot;  Bobby smiled.  This was the first conversation that he had with a girl that did not seem forced or awkward.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is all a part of business,&quot; Sandra said.  She too was smiling a great deal.  Slowly she moved closer to talk easier.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if the other girls at school are like Colleen then business will likely pick up in the next couple of days.&quot;  Bobby was going to say more but was suddenly dumb-struck when Sandra walked into full view.  He could not believe what he saw.</p>
