<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before I could say anything, Tommy said, &quot;You want me to become a woman, too, don't you?&quot;  I was a little shocked.  I looked at Myrintha and she looked just as shocked.  &quot;Come on, guys,&quot; he said.  &quot;I'm not dumb.  My only question is why do you want that?&quot;<br />
<br />
I got over my shock and straightened myself out.  &quot;The reason for that,&quot; I explained, &quot;is that everyone in our group has changed their identities in some way.  It's because we're going to change the world that everyone has some kind of change to their own person.  We're looking at it like a rebirth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OK,&quot; said Tommy.  &quot;Why the hell not?  But I have one condition.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; I asked.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I still want to wear glasses,&quot; he said.  &quot;They make me look distinguished.  And won't a hot Asian chick with glasses be sexy?&quot;<br />
<br />
I pointed at him.  &quot;And who said you don't have a sense of humor,&quot; I said.  &quot;You can keep the glasses, but we're going to have to make them look a little better than those monstrosities.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's fine,&quot; he said.  &quot;Are you sure there won't be any complications?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If any should arise, we can handle it,&quot; I said to him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; he said.  He took a deep breath.  &quot;Do what you have to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
I formed an image in my mind of how I wanted Tommy to look as a female.  I wished for him to change into that image.  By this point I'd watched this same change happen to two other people in addition to myself.  But that didn't mean it wasn't fun to watch.<br />
<br />
Tommy's hair grew longer and thicker until it had the same length as our hair.  His face changed next as it smoothed and rounded in the appropriate areas until his face had completely feminized.  Then he began to grow taller  He stood up as he felt this change begin.  I was making him grow to 5'11&quot;.  His lab coat and pants started to look very ill-fitting on him, but they did not rip and he did not remove them.  <br />
<br />
He just stood there and let the changes wash over him.  I could tell that his shoulders had narrowed.  I could also see hair recede from his arms.  I watched his hands become smaller while his fingers thinned and fingernails lengthened.  I heard the sound of fabric ripping as the outlines of breasts appeared on his lab coat.  He made a few pained expressions as his breasts blossomed.<br />
<br />
His pants fell down to his ankles, which told me that his waist had narrowed to a womanly size.  He made a few more odd facial expressions and began to moan softly.  His voice was certainly higher pitched.  I could only guess that his cock was shifting into a pussy while his ass and hips rounded to give him that great, curvy figure.<br />
<br />
I saw his legs change next.  They became thinner overall but also appeared to be more physically fit than they just had.  His shoes, which were still black since I hadn't changed them back, looked loose.  He stepped out of them with ease to confirm that his feet had grown smaller.  He also stepped out of his pants.  <br />
<br />
The very last change to occur was with his eyeglasses.  His rather ugly and clunky glasses became much smaller and thinner in size.  They became the type of glasses you'd expect to see on an intelligent woman.  And he was right, they definitely added a sexy factor to his appearance.<br />
<br />
&quot;This certainly feels different,&quot; he said with the changes now complete.  He didn't appear shocked at the sound of his voice.  It still retained that slight accent he had, but was very much female.  &quot;Sounds different, too,&quot; he added.  &quot;Let's see if you really made me look good.&quot;<br />
<br />
He unbuttoned the lab coat slowly and removed it from his body.  His boxers still clung to his hips, though they appeared overtaxed in that endeavor.  He still had a shirt on, but the shirt was largely in tatters.  His breasts had ripped through it completely.  I have to say he did look kind of hot standing there in a ripped shirt with his exquisite DD breasts protruding out.  He proceeded to simply tear the rest of the shirt off his body.  He cupped his breasts in his hands and massaged them to see how they felt.  I was pretty sure I heard him moan with pleasure once or twice.  <br />
<br />
After he finished with his breasts, he reached down and took off his socks.  He seemed pleased with the sight of his smaller feet.  He stood up straight again and looked at both of us.  With a shrug of his shoulders he said, &quot;Well, we're all girls here,&quot; and slipped off his boxers.  The first thing I noticed was that he still had pubic hair above his pussy.  He had that thin line that I'd heard others refer to as a &quot;landing strip.&quot;  This was how I imagined he'd look.  It was in contrast to the rest of us, who all had no pubic hair.  He ran his hands over his smooth hips and ass and then reached down to his pussy.  He stopped short of putting his fingers inside right now.  I admired his restraint.  I couldn't keep my hands off myself at first.<br />
<br />
He did a little twirl and asked, &quot;What do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you look great,&quot; said Myrintha.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are truly a picture of beauty,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;But what do you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now I'd say this feels great,&quot; he said.  &quot;So what else do you have to do, give me a new name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.  &quot;But if you have any ideas for yourself, that's fine.  I will say that, as you might tell, we all have names that aren't 'real.'  I've been opting for names that sound like they could exist in some kind of mythical of fantasy setting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not my area of expertise,&quot; he said.  &quot;Why don't you just come up with one?&quot;<br />
<br />
I said, &quot;OK.  How about...Quyresee?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds exotic,&quot; he said.  &quot;Quyresee it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the group,&quot; said Myrintha excitedly.  She ran over to Quyresee and hugged her tightly.<br />
<br />
Quyresee looked surprised but returned the hug.  When Myrintha released her, she asked me, &quot;So what else do you have to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
I explained to her that she had to refer to me as &quot;my goddess&quot; in front of others.  She laughed at this, but I reminded her that I was the one with the power.  I also made the needed wishes for whatever clothing I decided her to wear to be ignored like the rest of us, and for her to be able to go barefoot.  At this point, she surprised me again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm guessing you'll give me some kind of revealing clothing that you somehow are able to make everyone ignore?&quot; she asked.  Myrintha looked surprised, but I was able to keep my expression unchanged.  &quot;I mean, you're naked and you're practically naked, and for some reason I don't find that weird, so I guess you've done something to make it that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really hope this doesn't mean everyone else is so perceptive,&quot; I said.  &quot;I thought I'd made it so that people wouldn't care.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't 'care' if you mean that I don't find it unacceptable,&quot; she explained.  &quot;But I'm sure everyone notices your lack of clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, I think that was my intention,&quot; I said.  I'd honestly slightly forgotten the exact wording of my wish.  I was fine with it being how Quyresee saw it.  &quot;Since you're the science person, why don't you just wear your lab coat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was going to be what I suggested,&quot; she said.  &quot;Can you make this one a bit longer, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; I said.  I did as she asked and made her previous lab coat longer.  She put it back on but didn't button it up.  It extended down all the way to her lower legs.  I could see the idea she had.  She'd look all serious and buttoned down in her lab coat, and then reveal that she had nothing else on underneath.  &quot;Sexy scientist, indeed,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
She smiled.  &quot;I certainly hope so.&quot;  Then she frowned a bit.  &quot;You know, I feel like there's something I should have told you, but I can't remember what.&quot;</p>
