<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bella was running a little late today but she wasn&#39;t worried. Luckily her alarm had woken her up just in the nick of time for her to get ready and leave. She spit out her toothpaste and gave herself one last look over in the mirror. Her fiery red hair looked good as always, styled in a wavy cascade across her shoulders. Her makeup was on point, and her tight business suit gave just enough cleavage to make that old geezer of a superintendent happy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, let&#39;s get this over with.&quot; She told herself in the mirror. &quot;You got this beautiful.&quot; She gave with a wink before walking out into the main room to leave. <br />
<br />
&quot;By Happy!&quot; She waved at her male Persian cat who just meowed at her and fell asleep. &quot;Tch, such a lazy boy.&quot; She fake scolded him as she walked out the door.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hana managed to stay awake long enough to see that it had worked. She couldn&#39;t believe that she was looking at her own body when she saw the white paws. She tried to move them like she would her own thumbs but they just slightly split and went back. She could feel a tail swaying back and forth. She never had one before but somehow knew what it felt like and how to control it. She had fun for a few seconds, watching it sway back and forth, before she noticed another change. <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m male now.&quot; She internally chuckled. &quot;But, judging by the lack of balls I won&#39;t have to worry about horny thoughts in this form.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana felt a wave of sleepiness rush over her again. Just then, a white woman walked out of the bathroom. Hana assumed this was Boots if he was an adult white woman. As Hana drifted off, she heard the human Boots say &quot;By Happy!&quot; Hana tried to respond with &quot;By Boots&quot; as only a cute little meow came out before she fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Hana woke up sometime later a little disoriented. After a failed attempt at standing up, she quickly remembered that she was currently a cat. Panic struck her as she realized that she hadn&#39;t even checked if the camera was still there, butt o her relief it still sat on the coffee table. She crawled up the couch&#39;s seat cushion and was able to read &quot;12:30&quot; on her oven clock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, it&#39;s been hours.&quot; She thought. &quot;I could use the camera to change back, but there&#39;s no telling how I&#39;d change without Boots around. Just gotta chill for a few more hours and I can start tomorrow off perfectly fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
The next few hours were fairly uneventful. Hana tried to have fun with some cat toys and even a bit of cat nip, but with someone of her intellect it was all extremely dull. Just knowing the amount of good she could be doing if she hadn&#39;t of been so reckless last night killed her inside. At least it gave her time to explore the changes to the apartment. Apparently, human boots loved Modernist art.<br />
<br />
She eventually resorted to watching tv, which was hard to do without thumbs, but given that it was the middle of the day during the work week meant pretty bland reruns. After a while, it was finally close to when she herself would return home from work. Unfortunately, her body began to betray her as she felt extremely tired. She guessed that since she was a cat, she was nocturnal now. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well, I guess I can change us back at night right? While Boots is asleep, I&#39;ll just drag the camera over and change everything back to how it was.&quot; She thought before drifting off. <br />
<br />
<br />
A loud bang awoke her suddenly as the sounds of children could be heard near her. Disoriented, she frantically glanced around to see that not only was the apartment decorated differently again, but the camera no longer sat where it had been. She looked around panicking before she was greeted with a small fish tank that had not been there previously. <br />
<br />
Upon inspecting it, she found that the top had a large lid on it and a name tag sticker on the side that read &quot;Bubbles.&quot; Inside was an orange goldfish swimming around calmly.<br />
&quot;Boots?&quot; Hana thought. Before she could do anything, however, she heard a firm &quot;No Happy!&quot; From behind.<br />
<br />
Hana suddenly was lifted off the ground. She found herself face to face with an adorable little girl, no older than five. She had curly dark hair with a pink bow in it, chubby cheeks, and a cute dress. She looked like she was latino and she looked annoyed.<br />
&quot;No Happy.&quot; She said more firmly. &quot;Bubbles is part of our familia. No eating!&quot; She said in an adorable yet angry tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is something wrong Estela?&quot; An older male voice came from near the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Hana was violently smushed under the girls arm as she stomped around the couch. &quot;Yes Papa! Happy was trying to eat Bubbles again!&quot; She yelled, holding Hana up like Simba in the Lion King. Hana was greeted with a stressed looking latino man who was reading a newspaper. He put it slightly down enough to see a very dark skinned man with a fizzy mustache and bags under his eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hija, I already made it so that he can&#39;t, so don&#39;t worry.&quot; He replied before swiftly going back to his paper. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine.&quot; She grumbled letting Hana drop to the floor. Hana somehow landed on her feet and watched, still shocked as she walked away. Before Hana even had time to think, the front door opened and two more people walked in. There was a teenaged boy who looked a little emo with his dark clothes and bangs who simply walked past his family without a word. <br />
<br />
There was also a woman who closed the door and sat across from the father. She was a fairly plump but attractive woman, with a massive ass, curly black hair down to her shoulders, and breasts that could poke someone&#39;s eye out. She was wearing a business suit that looked close to bursting as she sighed while sitting. She sighed again but got no response from the father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh Francesca, how was your day?&quot; She sarcastically said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, sorry.&quot; He sighed. &quot;I&#39;ve just been stressed looking for work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I get that Juan, I really do, but you need to hurry. I definitely only got this job as principal due to the lack of people applying, and I think the superintendent is *this* close to firing me.&quot; She said while pinching her fingers. &quot;And what happens in the summer even if I do keep my job? What then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ay, I get it.&quot; He grunted before hiding behind the paper again. Francesca just rolled her eyes, standing up with a huff. &quot;Estela, Marco!&quot; She yelled. &quot;Dinner will be ready in two hours so make sure you get your work done!&quot; She yelled as she took off some of her more restricting clothing.<br />
<br />
Hana was shocked, but finally managed to get out of it as Francesca said &quot;shoo&quot; and swatted at her. She ran off back towards the former boots and tried to process this all. &quot;Okay. Okay okay okay.&quot; The thought. &quot;Calm down Hana, just use logic. Boots must&#39;ve come home and used the camera, making him a fish. Oh my God! These parents were the other people looking into moving into this apartment! They decided not to buy it when they couldn&#39;t scope out good work in the area, but I guess without me, a job and place to live were open... I gotta find that camera! If I don&#39;t, I&#39;ll have to be a cat living in my masters house forev- wait, master?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hana tried to think of the man in the chair as anything other than master, but she just couldn&#39;t do it. She remembered reading something about this last night. If changes happen without you using it and you&#39;re still aware, the more changes that happen mean the faster you&#39;ll adjust to the new role. &quot;Crap, I&#39;ll still be aware of the camera&#39;s ability, but I&#39;ll be nothing more than a dumb cat!&quot; She panicky thought as she started sprinting around, searching for the camera...</p>
