<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gloria and Kimmy were driving towards the beach. They were going there to find Kimmy&#39;s daughters and check on Gloria&#39;s, but they were very eager to check out the beach itself.<br />
&quot;I wonder how the beach is looking right now?&quot; asked Kimmy, &quot;You think it&#39;ll be totally covered in babes by now?&quot;<br />
&quot;If my girls have been busy, I expect it ta be,&quot; said Gloria.<br />
&quot;Ya know, I didn&#39;t use to like wearing swimsuits, but now I can&#39;t wait to show off mine,&quot; said Kimmy, looking down at her D-cup breasts with a grin.<br />
&quot;Yeah, me too-&quot; started Gloria as she looked down at her E-cup breasts. But then she realized something. &quot;Wait, wait, we can&#39;t go to the beach yet,&quot; she said.<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Kimmy.<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t got no swimsuit,&quot; said Gloria, lifting up her blouse. Her boobs were currently held up by a bra that could hold their size, but it was still not a swimsuit.<br />
&quot;So? You don&#39;t hafta go swimming,&quot; said Kimmy, &quot;All the fun&#39;s gonna be on the beach.&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh-uh. No way I can go on the beach without a swimsuit. I ain&#39;t gonna be the only one without one,&quot; said Gloria, putting extra sass into her tone.<br />
Kimmy pursed her lips as she thought before saying, &quot;I know just the place to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
*****************<br />
<br />
The swimsuit store was conveniently placed right across the street to the beach. Obviously it was there for people who needed a swimsuit but didn&#39;t have one. Gloria and Kimmy walked through the door and could immediately see a lot of potential. There were already a few customers there, looking at the swimsuits. But it was the swimsuits themselves that called out to the two dykes. They had a powerful urge to contaminate every piece of swimwear in the store. Their pussies were already drooling at the idea.<br />
&quot;Mmm... I don&#39;t know where ta start...&quot; moaned Gloria, fighting the urge to finger herself right there.<br />
&quot;How about with the cashier?&quot; asked Kimmy.<br />
&quot;Good call,&quot; said Gloria, &quot;You start with her, I&#39;m gonna find a new suit.&quot;<br />
The two of them headed in different directions. Kimmy made a beeline towards the cash register. The poor girl didn&#39;t look very enthusiastic about her job. She was wearing glasses, had limp, brown hair, and wearing heavier clothes than you would expect in a swimsuit store. Though that was probably to hide her lack of curves. Kimmy guessed she was a high school girl who only worked here because she really needed the money.<br />
&quot;Can I help you?&quot; asked the girl.<br />
Kimmy leaned over, allowing her a long look down her cleavage. &quot;Yeah, could you tell me your name?&quot; asked Kimmy.<br />
Gloria was perusing the various bikini sets. When no was looking, she put both her hands down her pants and fingered herself. But she wasn&#39;t trying to get off. She had now coated her hands in super-infectious juices. As she touched the various swimsuits, she left her infection, which was already spreading through the material. Just picking one up was a guarantee for infection.<br />
Gloria spotted a rack of promising bikinis that a pair of plump girls were looking at wistfully. Gloria put her hands on their shoulders and said, &quot;You can try them on if yah want. Nobody&#39;s gonna judge yah.&quot;<br />
&quot;I guess we could,&quot; said one girl.<br />
&quot;Thanks, miss,&quot; said the other. They each grabbed a bikini set and headed towards the changing room. Gloria could see them losing weight as they walked.<br />
Gloria smirked to herself before looking at the bikinis. She immediately spotted two sets that she liked. One was a white string bikini and the other was a black strapless one. But which one should she pick? Puzzling it over in her head, she went back to the cash register.<br />
She found Kimmy making out with the cashier girl, who was a lot sexier than when Gloria last saw her. Her hair was longer and more luscious and her body was starting to get curvier. The clothes she was wearing were shrinking, uncovering her arms and legs.<br />
&quot;Hey, Kimmy,&quot; said Gloria, &quot;Which one of these should I get?&quot; She held up the two bikini sets.<br />
Kimmy stopped kissing to look at the swimsuits. &quot;Hmm...tough pick. What do you think, Julie?&quot;<br />
&quot;You could get both,&quot; said Julie, &quot;We have a two-for-one sale. If I were you, I&#39;d mix and match.&quot;<br />
&quot;Got it,&quot; said Gloria, &quot;How about ya&#39;ll help out the other customers?&quot;<br />
&quot;Good thinking,&quot; said Kimmy, &quot;Wanna help, Julie?&quot;<br />
By now, Julie&#39;s clothes had been reduced to a floral bikini and her body was a super model&#39;s with DD-cup breasts. &quot;Count me in,&quot; she said, licking her plump lips.<br />
Gloria walked over to the changing rooms. She could hear a few moans coming out of one already. She walked to the men&#39;s changing rooms and opened one. It was already occupied and the guy inside gave Gloria an annoyed look. &quot;Hey, lady, can&#39;t you read?&quot; he snapped. Gloria just smirked before closing the door behind her. &quot;Hey! You can&#39;t just- What are you doing?&quot; asked the man. From outside, one could here the man starting to moan, his voice getting higher until it became distinctly female. Soon after, there was an orgasmic cry.<br />
Then Gloria walked out of the changing room, leaving a naked woman to keep fingering herself. Gloria rather liked her new bikini. She picked the white top and black bottom. She carried the other halves and her clothes under one arm.<br />
Heading to the register, Gloria could see the lesbian plague spreading. Everyone was in the store was a woman now and they were busy either making out and fingering each other or openly eating each other out. The infection was spreading to the swimwear in the store. Men&#39;s trunks were becoming women one-pieces and formerly modest swimsuits were becoming sexy.<br />
Julie was currently behind the counter, moaning and slightly humping her hips. Gloria put the other bikini halves on the desks and asked, &quot;Ya don&#39;t mind if I were this out, do ya?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Julie with a moan, &quot;That&#39;ll be $20.&quot; That was pretty low, even for a two-for-one sale. But Julie obviously cared for more than just business now.<br />
Gloria paid Julie and called, &quot;Yo, Kimmy! Ya ready to leave?&quot;<br />
Kimmy popped out from behind the counter and said, &quot;Sure am.&quot;<br />
&quot;But you can&#39;t go,&quot; protested Julie.<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s plenty of other girls who can help with your itch,&quot; said Kimmy, &quot;And I bet someone will walk through the door that could help too.&quot; She gave Julie a peck on the cheek before walking over to Gloria. She looked at Gloria&#39;s bikini and said, &quot;You look so hot.&quot;<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t I know it,&quot; said Gloria. The two leaned in for a kiss, their breasts pushing against each other. But then they headed out of the infected bikini store. They still had their daughters to find and the whole beach to search.</p>
