<br />
Publicized from an unknown organization, it was targeted for people, humans and furries alike, that has a love for zentai or spandex related fetishists. A zentai is a one piece bodysuit that covers an individual from head to toe in smooth tight spandex material, erasing/covering any physical features or identity. This also attracted strange people too after hearing about people being turned into zentai like beings as drones. Since then, it has gained reputation for their conversion methods as more and more people willingly wanted to join the ranks of the featureless/faceless zentai drones, months after this unknown organization publicized on converting people into zentai drones and built a zentai drone conversion convention center and a store in different parts of the country and are continuing to make other methods of converting willing people into zentai drones.<br />
Purpose-<br />
	While it targets people with this kind of fetish, the organization made a main purpose to make zentai drones. The main purpose of the zentai drones is to solve the economical crisis, and the overpopulation. While the space colonization is still an ideal dream, the organization decided to use this kind of method to reduce the human population and economic debt around the world. It also gives a person a choice to live their sentence in jail (probably life sentence), or live their life as a zentai drone (with moderate or high possibility of mental individuality wiped/erased); same goes for someone who are in heavy amount of debt.<br />
<br />
Zentai Drones-<br />
	Zentai drones were once human or furry that willing accepted the sacrifice of their physical identity and (a bit or all of) their free will to become owned by their family member, friends, owned by someone else, working at the store/convention center, or working as freelance drones. They come in many colors and patterns and are excellent living toys or servants with their obedient programming installed from their nanobots that converted them. Memory and personality are still intact, unless the person decided to wipe their past life if they wish to forget about their past and be reborn as a zentai drone. While their physical identities are erased by their spandex “skin” and given a designation (located either above the pec/breast, or at the forehead), there are some ways to tell who they are and once were after their conversion into a zentai drone. They can be used for either as a work force, someone to cuddle or for other kinds of play, or when a person feels lonely and/or needs someone or… thing, to vent on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zentai Drone’s Physical Identities or Features-<br />
	While they are featureless and faceless, zentai drones have some subtle ways of knowing who they once were judging by their simplistic characteristics for example, a human female zentai drone still retains her breasts and simplistic female shape of her torso or an average slim female body, while males have some form of pecs and a crotch that can swell into a bulge to show they are erect (or perma-erect). For furries is the featureless muzzle, tail, wings (if they are avian or draconian), and how they stand on their feet. The individual’s original name (if they didn’t get their memory or personality wiped) is found on the sole of their foot for their friend, or family member to let them know that is them of what they became. The drones also show useless features like their hands that are mittens and their feet into socks and their body is smooth, no blemishes or anything. Zentai drones are also lightweight and can be easily picked up.<br />
<br />
Types of Drones-<br />
Of course, there are people who can ask for specific modifications to their drone form for having fingers (probably for some work or tasks that would require digits like writing or typing) or toes or some subtle detail of a face, but not too much detail. There are several different types of drones known to the store-<br />
Worker Drones- These worker types help out their owners or a company doing a series of tasks like lifting objects from point A to B, typing, or serving their owner and have the ability to talk when ordered by their owner, sub owner, or given a certain time to talk freely, otherwise, when in idle mode, they can only let out muffled grunts or groans. They also have fingers that helps them in certain tasks. They can never get dirty when they are giving a task that makes them get wet or dirty. They also can work as waiters in restaurants or cafe too (which would require their speech to be intact).<br />
Pleasure, Personal, or Toy Drones- The zentai drones made for pleasuring their owner and/or friends that are with them. They’re mostly to sometimes useless due to their fully featureless hands that are reduced to mittens.<br />
Free-Willed or Free-Lancing Drones- Rather than waiting to be purchased on a shelf or somewhere in the store facility acting as store worker drones, they can still live their free life in their home, and stay idle until ordered or recruited by other companies or person to work for them in a certain amount of time. Of course, the everyday bill is paid from the organization that he/she has been converted from, or from the person or other company that hires him/her. Their featureless state or featureless idle mode are their base forms and are customizable for wide ranges of work given by their client as a temporary form to give them and reverts back to featureless state once the time of work schedule they are given is done. Their drone program wouldn’t work unless they are given a specific type of job, schedule and how long they will be working for.<br />
<br />
Conversion Methods-<br />
There are a variety of items that can convert an individual into a zentai drone. They are mostly done by nanomachines that does most of the conversion of skin to spandex, installing obedient program(s) to owner orders (or orders from the store/convention center’s network if the individual decides to work at the store/convention center) and calms the post transformed victim if he/she is panicking. The current methods of conversions are; gas canisters/tanks, liquid inside the needles, and a prototype ring station. The conversion is a one way ticket, once an individual is converted, they can’t go back to normal and live the rest of their life as a zentai drone or store worker. As for the process of the conversion, it is usually from low to moderate as some people like to watch their body change slowly right before their eyes. For personal zentai drones, the owner has a tablet that has access to the drone settings and shows a current battery status of the zentai drone and the tablet itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Drone Purchase-<br />
	Once a person has been turned into a zentai drone, they are tagged with a barcode and their designation with a letter and a two digit number or more (i.e; A-01) by some sort of laser scanner like device and are escorted to either an aisle or on a display at the front of the building or inside. They usually cost from 50-100 dollars, approximately or a bit more than that, depending on their drone form’s specifications. If they are a completely blank drone, no personality, memory, or anything of what they once were, they can customize the zentai drone to the customer’s making and give them a new personality, color/pattern, and role, they cost a bit less than a standard zentai drone. Though, purchasing a conversion item, maybe a bit less than being a converted zentai drone. Personal zentai drones have a special tablet that displays their battery life and have certain configurations. These configurations are: Drone programming, sensitivity, drone (muffled/grunt) and normal speech and language translators, and special features like furniture poses, and mannequin mode.If a personal drone is brought into a museum or a tourist site, the tablet automatically acquires a temporary app that is made for audio guide settings. This can allow the owner to have the drone talk about key interests if close within proximity of the location of the key target or not. The app goes away when they leave the tourist zone or museum.<br />
<br />
Rules and Morality-<br />
	Despite turning an individual to a zentai drone, there are some rules that needed to be placed and to avoid loopholes for any sort of illegal trafficking, use, or tampering with the program or the body that he/she/it is not capable of. Should there be any case of tampering or any illegal use of a zentai drone, an emergency beacon (created by nanobots and located either somewhere in the head or near the spine,) is transmitted to the zentai store and/or to any police officials or patrol cars or on duty cops in the area and sends the location to the abuser’s location. From there, the criminals are sentenced to jail, death sentence, or sentence to drone life (with a high chance to wipe away mental identity or individuality of the criminal). Same goes for any gang members or mafia groups who would use the drones for their own illegal purposes. For morality, it depends on the customer who purchases a zentai drone since they are considered living people that they once were, or use them as tools and objects for their normal day life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Drone Behavior and Abilities- <br />
	After the conversion, they have to follow the order(s) of their owner due to their programming to obey and be happy of their new life, though while in rare occasions, there are some drones that would like to maintain their free will and unowned by someone else and just enjoy their life as some sort of featureless being and expose themselves to the world for who they are and once were. Others are used as security, acting as guards and a living statue made of spandex. This kind of role, they have the ability to turn and/or capture other criminals or thugs into other zentai drones for their owner. However, when turning a criminal into a zentai drone straight without a trial would cause an issue to the public, and putting forth an investigation to the organization that created the conversion of people into zentai drones. When in idle mode, they would mostly act like any normal person would and look at their surrounding area at their free time or end up pleasuring themself by rubbing their bulge or sensitive spandex body against any surface, or find some other way to enjoy their time in their idle mode. Like normal store mannequins, they can be dismantled and can be used for easy storage for traveling. Though the dismantlement is pleasurable to the drone(s) so it doesn’t really hurt them. Their speech is only limited to muffled grunts or voice as their owners have to use a special device to understand what the zentai drone is saying when in idle mode, unless they are being talked to directly by saying their name or designation. As mentioned before, the drone’s program can be modified via tablet<br />
<br />
Drone’s Reversion, Lifespan, and their Future<br />
<br />
	While converted zentai drones live for eternity (approximately if the world is still around or time still keeps on going), there are some zentai drones that would like to live for almost in human or elven years, or shorter. Depending on the criminal’s sentence or the customer’s request, it can be modified, though can cause some complications on how long a person can live as a zentai drone and can either die by age and deactivating the nanobots within them to stop functioning around the brain and give them either a proper burial or cremation. Of course, there is another way which is by reversion. The reversion is complicated and depends on how long the person has been turned to a zentai drone and would require lots of medical and psychological attention. And when a person wishes to keep their memories intact, as a remembrance of their old life when they face an eternal life of being a zentai drone, their long term memories and would require a specialized memory bank in the conversion store’s underground specialized memory data banks as a copies. However, to criminals facing this kind of sentence will not be archived or at least fragmented into millions of pieces in another specialized section of their facility’s memory bank.<br />
<br />
Zentai Drone’s Pay<br />
	While being a zentai drone, the person still gets paid, somehow and is only deposited into their bank. Depending on how long they stay as a drone, their pay is approximately around 9.50 to 12 dollars an hour. Their work schedule depends on the drone’s owner, but their pay is still approximately the same.<br />
