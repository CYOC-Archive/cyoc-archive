<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;If we&#39;re both girls, it&#39;s no problem, right?&quot;  Ashley grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...what?!&quot;  Noah gaped at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, I bet you&#39;d be a hot girl.  At least a cute one.&quot;  Ashley gave Noah the dreaded &#39;puppy dog eyes&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, ok.  I mean, what could it hurt?  Let&#39;s see...first wish.  I wish that everyone but Ashley and myself will think her current height is normal for her, and not think it&#39;s strange at all.  I wish that Ashley has been emancipated from her parents, and lives with me and my brother, and no one thinks that&#39;s strange or immoral.  I wish that Ashley had plenty of money for bills, rent, and food.  I wish that Ashley had her own room, and she had clothing that she wants to wear and can fit her.  I wish that any time Debbie is abusive to Ashley in any way, she will grow slightly younger, physically weaker, and cuter, until she&#39;s an adorable little girl of six.  I wish that as Debbie gets younger, she will also become more impervious to harm, until it&#39;s almost impossible to cause her injury, but this won&#39;t affect her in any other way.  I wish that no one besides myself, Debbie, and Ashley are aware of these changes- people will know something is wrong, but not be able to figure out what.  They will not believe this is an abnormal event.  I wish that Debbie will be incapable of explaining exactly what has happened to her.&quot;<br />
<br />
He paused.  &quot;Whew, does that cover everything?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You gave me my own room?  Can it...at least have a door that leads to yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
Noah sighed but nodded.  &quot;I wish Ashley&#39;s room was next to mine, and there is a door that connects our rooms.  I wish Ashley had her own bathroom, and it has all the beauty and feminine products she requires.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, you are thoughtful!&quot;<br />
<br />
He shrugged.  &quot;I try.  But um, what about your sister?&quot;  He recalled Ashley had a kid sister in middle school.<br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s actually my half sister.  But nobody is supposed to know.&quot;  She frowned, clearly she had mixed feelings about it.  &quot;She&#39;s kind of a brat, but I love her.  You could wish her mom had full custody of her...she&#39;s nice...I don&#39;t think we should have her move in with us.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, so your dad...&quot;  Noah trailed off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, he had an affair when I was little.  Mom&#39;s lawyers made sure that she only got partial custody.  I didn&#39;t even know she wasn&#39;t my full sister until...&quot;  She stopped talking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess.  The fifth grade.&quot;<br />
<br />
She nodded, a sad look on her face.  &quot;It doesn&#39;t excuse anything, but yeah.  That...was part of it.  I&#39;m not quite ready yet.  I&#39;m sorry.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no.  Does her mom live far away?  I wouldn&#39;t want you to be unable to see her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So considerate.  I really hope I get to be your girlfriend.  You&#39;re too good for me.  But yeah, she lives in the next town over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, what&#39;s her name again?&quot;  Noah suddenly was afraid Ashley might have another sister or something, so he&#39;d better be careful about this wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Madison.  I call her Maddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right.  I wish Madison&#39;s biological mother had full custody of her, and she lives with her, but still goes to the same school, and that Ashley can see her whenever she wants.&quot;  Noah nodded.  &quot;So, how about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just one more wish.&quot;  Ashley reminded him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh jeez.  Ok.  I wish that I was a pretty girl.  I wish that everyone but me and Ashley will think I&#39;ve always been a girl.&quot;  Noah felt very strange.  His clothing became looser on his frame as he shrunk several inches in height, and his figure altered.  Hips flared and waist narrowed, and he felt a strange sensation in his crotch.  Female breasts formed on his chest, and his behind became heart shaped and slightly plump.  His lips became fuller, his hair became healthier, and his facial features became softer and finer.  Much of his body hair receded, and when the transformation was complete, he looked like a female version of his old self.  His clothing was too large and didn&#39;t fit him...her...body right.  His hair was only slightly longer, framing his face, and his breasts were noticeable under his shirt.  Very noticeable.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh this is weird.&quot;  As she spoke, Noelle realized her voice was softer, but also sounded a little sexier.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look amazing.  I&#39;m so jealous.  Uh..take off your shirt, would you?&quot;  Ashley was looking up at her oddly.  (Noah..that is...Noelle had shrunk about 4&quot; in height, making her 5&#39; 5 1/2&quot; tall).<br />
<br />
Noelle removed her shirt, and found that she had very large, but perfectly formed breasts.  &quot;Holy shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re going to need to wear a bra for sure.  I&#39;m super jealous now!  Those have to be D cups!&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle placed her hands under her breasts, weighing them experimentally.  They were sensitive, and it felt good to touch them.  &quot;They&#39;re heavy...and feel weird.  Am I going to be bouncing around all over when I move?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll need a lot of support.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll help you with all that in the morning.  Let&#39;s get ready for bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Noelle led her to her room.   Ashley&#39;s new room had appeared as an add-on to the house; Noelle lost her east window, and the only door connecting her room to the rest of the house was in Noelle&#39;s room.  Ashley ducked into her room, and came out wearing fresh panties and a silk nightie that was slightly translucent.<br />
<br />
Noelle didn&#39;t own pajamas, so she put on her boxers, and tied the drawstring tight so they&#39;d stay on properly.  &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t have a bra, should I put on a t-shirt or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I kind of want to touch them.&quot;  Ashley blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...uh, I guess that&#39;d be ok?&quot;  Noelle blushed too.<br />
<br />
&quot;Help me onto the bed, hon, I&#39;m super tiny now you know.&quot;  In fact, Noelle wasn&#39;t clear about Ashley&#39;s height, but she seemed to be 4&#39; 5&quot; or so.  She picked Ashley up and set her on the bed, before joining her.  Ashley nuzzled next to her, her hair just below Noelle&#39;s breasts.  That tickled, and Noelle shivered.<br />
<br />
Ashley giggled as they got comfy, and Noelle pulled the covers over them, and turned out the light.  She was going to enjoy this.  She reached up to place her hand on one of Noelle&#39;s breasts, caressing it, feeling it&#39;s heft, and lightly teasing her nipple.<br />
<br />
Noelle moaned softly in response.  &quot;Oh...that feels...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not sex, just heavy petting.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll stop before you get too wound up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Th...thanks...I don&#39;t know how to masturbate as a girl, and that&#39;d be rude with a guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ashley giggled.  &quot;Roommate, the word you&#39;re looking for is roommate.  And don&#39;t worry about that, I&#39;d be glad to help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh...what...but I&#39;m a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now you are, but you&#39;re also the person I love, no matter the gender.  Besides, it&#39;s not like it&#39;d be the first time I&#39;ve been with a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?!&quot;  Noelle couldn&#39;t believe it.  &quot;You&#39;re...bisexual?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure.  I mean, definitely bi-curious, and it was fun.  But I never met a girl I wanted to be with.  Until now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh.  Oh.&quot;  Noelle didn&#39;t know what else to say!<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh now, just sleep, honey.  I&#39;ll be right here.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two of them had the best sleep they&#39;d ever known.  And the next day...</p>
