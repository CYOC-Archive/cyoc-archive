<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His feet didn't even touch the floor! He looked around his room, and noticed that things seemed larger. He literally hopped off of his bed, and was horrified as he noticed the floor appeared closer to him!<br />
<br />
He walked over to his mirror. The one he liked to look at himself in. As he looked in the mirror, he could have fainted. He was gonna be sick instead. He was now a full 10 inches shorter, putting him at 5' even! He noticed that his muscles looked much smaller than before. He was a scrawny, short man now. He was still 21 it appeared, but now he could pass for a 15 year old! The only thing that made him still manly, was his body hair. That was one of the things he hadn't lost. His shaggy blond hair looked ridiculous on him now.<br />
<br />
He was afraid to do so, but he knew he'd have to eventually. He looked down at his cock. It had been a full 10 incher before. Now it was a puny 4 incher!<br />
<br />
He needed to find clothes to wear now. He knew none of his current clothes would fit him. He remembered that he had packed away his old clothes from when he was still in high school. He had kept them as sentimental objects, not realizing that he would have eventually needed them for something like this! He went into his closet, and grabbed his box of old clothes. He rummaged through the box looking for something decent to wear. He found a pair of blue jeans, and a black, ripped muscle tee. He threw the clothes on his bed, and went to his dresser for underwear and socks. Those should still stay up on him right?<br />
<br />
He was right, they did stay on. The only problem was that the slightest tug or pull, could knock them to the ground. That, and they looked ridiculous on him! He looked like he was trying on an older brother's underwear, or father's. His socks weren't much better. They at least stayed up... slightly. His feet were swimming in them though.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, maybe the old clothes will hold the underwear up...&quot; he thought.<br />
<br />
He slipped on the muscle tee. It was a little long, but it fit fine, and didn't look too baggy on him. Then he went to put on the pants. They were just the right length for his legs, but they slipped down and showed off his underwear a bit. He grabbed one of his belts, that he could almost wrap around his waist twice. He put it on the last hole. It was better, but not quite enough. His pants only showed the tip of the waistband of his underwear now.<br />
<br />
Next, he needed shoes. He had also kept a box with a few pairs of old shoes that were almost brand new, due to his feet out growing them. He meant to donate the shoes to a thrift store or something, but had never had the time. He was glad he hadn't. He reached up into the top of his closet now, and pulled out a small box, and opened it. He grabbed a pair of his old black low top converse. He hadn't worn these since he was 15! They fit snug on his feet though.<br />
<br />
Now that he found clothes to wear, he had to find out more about the ointment the old man gave him. He grabbed the ointment, and walked out of his house, and locked the door behind him. He got into his car and headed to the Ointment Store. He had to readjust everything in his car now. The seat was too far back and the he could only see the ceiling of his car in it. He also had to move his steering wheel down so it was easier to steer. After a few minutes, he made it back to where he had received the strange ointment. He parked his car, and got out.</p>
