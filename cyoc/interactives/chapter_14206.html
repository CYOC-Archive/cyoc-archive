<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bookshelves lined the walls in a long jagged pattern, some of the shelves reaching twelve feet into the air, others only going up five or six. Two floors of texts, tomes and volumes were contained within the massive hall, making this place one of the most impressive collections amongst the magic schools. A thin layer of dust often settled across the shelves, though the ancient wooden floors were kept clean and shiny by the caretaker that looked over it day after day. Tom often wondered how long it had been since some of these pages had been opened up and peered upon. Often he came up here in order to get away from things, to have some time to sit in silence and think. At this time during the night it was empty, and Tom knew he shouldn’t be shuffling around in here. He looked at some of the labels: ‘ Mind Altering Potions’, ‘Fire and Lightning – A Beginners Guide’, ‘Herbs and Their Properties’. Boring sort of stuff except maybe for the fire and lightning one, but Tom knew that his strength in that type of magic was severely lacking. He thought back a couple of months and remembered the time he tried to cast a small sparking spell. It fizzled of course, and left a burn across the back of his left hand that hurt for days afterwards. The teachers had taken him out of the class soon afterward and placed Tom into an element he was more adept at – water. Not that he really minded. A large book bound by a leather casing caught his eye, mainly because of the large gold print running down its side that read ‘Physical Sexual Transmorphing’. But it was the sub title that really caught his attention, it read. 'Making your own date, Volamorts guide to sexually enslaving your rivials!' <br />
Now shape shifting was one of the uncommon arts because there were few gifted in the ability, and because hardly any spells existed that allowed changing into anything more than common animals. Unfortunately many of the morphing spells lasted for weeks, months or years, instead of days or hours. With a certain fascination Tom took the heavy book down and wandered over to a large wooden desk, blowing the dust off the cover as he went. A hand touching his shoulder sent a rush of shock through Tom’s mind and body. <br />
<br />
He turned around hastily to see his old friend Jerome trying to hold in a mischievous laugh. He was dressed in plain working clothes and hIis straight red hair ran freely down to his shoulders. Jerome’s physical appearance reflected his personality, hardworking, free and given to the occasional joke. Certainly with his fair skin and thickly muscled body most folks would consider him at least handsome, but Tom never really thought of him that way. For Tom unlike his friend was not gay or even bi sexual, Tom liked females only. <br />
<br />
<br />
“ Gods, you scared the life out of me.” Tom laughed, sitting the book down on the desk. <br />
<br />
“ You know you shouldn’t be out here. What if the dean catches you?” Jerome said in a soft voice. <br />
<br />
“ He won’t. Besides, you aren’t supposed to be in here either.” Tom pointed out in reply, leaning against the desk. <br />
<br />
“ I guess not, but summer break starts tomorrow and I get so bored hanging around the dorms when everyone's gone. What is that you are reading?” <br />
<br />
“ Just something I found on the shelves. Morphing spells or some such.” <br />
<br />
“ Can I see?” He asked playfully. <br />
<br />
Tom nodded and opened the book. Inside were various chapters detailing spells for changing a human into mythical creatures of opposite genders with appropriate diagrams and charts written in beside the text. Luckily most of it was written in common, a language that Tom was capable of reading. It was an odd occurrence that the book actually showed someone how to cast the spells, rather than just having a description of the effects.<br />
<br />
“ It all seems rather advanced, don’t you think. I have trouble enough thickening a piece of paper let alone transforming a living creature.” Jerome commented. <br />
<br />
He was right of course, but maybe it would be worth trying a couple out just to see how good he was. <br />
<br />
“ I might attempt one.” Tom insisted bravely. <br />
<br />
“ Do you think that’s wise?” Jerome asked looking amused.<br />
<br />
“ Probably not, but I doubt I could even give myself tits, let alone alter my entire body.” <br />
<br />
Tom flicked through the heavy pages slowly, looking for a spell which he might be capable of succeeding with. Some of the concepts contained within the pages were entirely foreign to him, effectively wiping out the majority of the magic contained within. Finally he came to a spell that seemed simple enough for Keliv to cast, at least partially. Two blacked inked diagrams, one of a man and another of a normal human female were drawn neatly on either corner of the page. He was familiar with the energy used to cast the spell, as well as the methods. Unluckily it required that the caster perform it on someone other than .<br />
<br />
“ This one, do you think?” Tom asked Jerome. <br />
<br />
“ I don’t think this is a very sensible course of action.” He said doubtfully. <br />
<br />
“ Oh come on. Live a little.” Tom teasing in a wheeling tone. <br />
<br />
“ Alright, I guess; but you will have to look after me if something goes wrong.” Jerome conceded, arguing much less that Tom had expected. <br />
<br />
Tom looked over the words and started to clear his mind. Concentration was always the key to effective magic, which was why battle mages were so valued by almost all the nations of the world. Many mages would be unable to use their talents in all but the most serene of circumstances. He wondered for a second whether he could cast spells in such a chaotic time as war, before returning all of his thoughts to the task at hand. <br />
<br />
Two separate pulses of energy gathered within, bursting to life as Tom took a proper hold of them. Carefully he shaped the energy according to the book’s instructions and hoped that he wouldn’t make a mistake. A pressure began to build up within as he used his will to keep the energy focused and ready. A crystallization of the energy began to occur, an indication that the spell was working and was close to being cast. Within his mind’s eye Tom could see the crystal energy, the basis of all magic, glint and glimmer with a mysterious power. Beads of sweat dripped from Tom’s forehead as he tried to keep the energy under control, forcing it into the correct form with his mind and directing it to do what he intended. He strained to keep the thing underneath his will, threw all of his strength at holding it in place. The crystal form dissipated into a spell that surrounded Jerome’s body in a flash of white light. He relaxed. It had been cast. <br />
<br />
“ Did it work?” Jerome questioned uncomfortably. <br />
<br />
“ I don’t know, I suppose it must have.” Tom replied, letting his mind and muscles relax. <br />
<br />
A sudden realisation came to him. If the spell had worked then wouldn’t he… had noticed Jerome changing. Quickly turning over the page, Tom letting out a soft gasp. <br />
<br />
“ What?!? Jerome demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;It says that you will become a female for three weeks.” Tom admitted grinning wickedly<br />
<br />
“ Great!” Jerome said sarcastically. “Thats most of summer brea.. Ouch...” Jerome exclaimed clutching at his loin's as a grimace of pain shot across his face.</p>
