<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty had to make some changes to the guy. And as he was in the other room the changes occurred.<br />
<br />
The next time Brandy saw him he was fluttering through the door, which was some feat since he was now a 400 <br />
pound soft fairy dressed in a drag version of what Brandy had on.<br />
<br />
Now Ty had not intended to make him fat but that was the only way he could figure out how to give him cleavage <br />
and the curves to pull off the drag look. <br />
<br />
He was now quite the caricature version of Brandy.<br />
<br />
Hey Brandy, Ty said catching her eye as she and her friend stepped out.<br />
<br />
What are you doing here Ty? <br />
<br />
Just passing by who is your friend?<br />
<br />
Oh this? This is Tony. Well Antoinette as he goes by when he dances.<br />
<br />
Antoinette? Nice to meet you. Ty put out his hand to shake but He grabbed Ty and pulled him in close to his <br />
ample bosom. <br />
<br />
Ty was startled by the speed at which he was pulled into her embrace and he wasn't that upset about it. <br />
Although he knew he was a guy this really felt good to him.<br />
<br />
Where are you two headed Ty finally asked as he was released from the embrace.<br />
<br />
We are headed down to Ms. B's. I thought maybe we could get in and it would be Antoinette's first time at a <br />
college drag bar. <br />
<br />
Ty rolled his eyes in a mock annoyance with the choice of events.<br />
<br />
I know it isn't really your thing so I figured we would do that and I would catch up with you when Tony <br />
leaves.<br />
<br />
Oh Brandy you know I would do anything for you. Ty really wanted to see Tony's full change into drag queen but <br />
he couldn't act too enthused about it.<br />
<br />
No really Ty you don't have to go.<br />
<br />
But I would like to go with you and get to know your friend. It tells me what you are like and who better to <br />
dish than a drag queen. Ty shot a glance at Tony and he giggled like a school girl.<br />
<br />
Oh you flirt you. Tony pawed back at Ty.<br />
<br />
And off they went. Brandy knew that ID checking would be lax at this time of the day and they could sit and <br />
chat till things got going. And that is just what they did.<br />
<br />
There were a few others there and they had a few drinks and listened to the music. Brandy and Ty getting out <br />
on the dance floor a couple times. <br />
<br />
Brandy was amazed the first time that Tony asked Ty to Dance but he accepted and it was almost comical <br />
watching Ty dance with Antoinette. She was a great dance and that booty could pop like no other. The funny <br />
thing was that Ty danced like a straight white boy, he had no rhythm at all. But he seemed to be enjoying <br />
himself even more than when he was dancing with Brandy. <br />
<br />
As the night wore on Tony got hit on by many a guy and boy did he giggle. He was so flattered that all these <br />
college boys were interested in him and he kept busy all night long.<br />
<br />
When they left they were exhausted and headed back to Brandy's. Passing out they woke the next morning to a <br />
knock on the door. <br />
<br />
There as Brandy opened the door were two men. Carl, Jay how are you doing.<br />
<br />
Tony hopped up and pranced to the door. Daddy's. <br />
<br />
Well now we thought maybe you two might want to head out to breakfast but it looks like you two have been up <br />
all night.<br />
<br />
Oh Daddy we had the bestest time. We went to this place and danced and danced and danced. And there were these <br />
cute guys that I just couldn't keep my eyes off. They were adorable.<br />
<br />
Well get a shower and we can head out to breakfast.<br />
<br />
Daddy, Daddy this is Ty. Isn't he just scrumptious. <br />
<br />
Yes sweety he is. You did well first time at college. <br />
<br />
Oh silly he isn't mine he is Brandy's but he danced with me last night. He was just so precious.<br />
<br />
Nice to meet you ... Ty was it?<br />
<br />
Yes sir Mr. Carl.<br />
<br />
No no I am Jay. He's Carl.<br />
<br />
Well nice to meet you Mr. Jay and you too Mr. Carl.<br />
<br />
Well get dressed and lets get going. <br />
<br />
But daddy we were going to see the campus today. You can do that too we wont take up much of your time.<br />
<br />
So as Tony went to shower and get ready he came out in men's clothes and it looked like his shirt was a tent <br />
and let me tell you overweight men should never wear pleated pants but that was what Tony was wearing.<br />
<br />
Then it was Brandy's turn and then Ty's.<br />
<br />
They headed out and after breakfast Carl and Jay said their goodbyes. We are going antiquing we will see you <br />
tomorrow. Now no more of that partying. Brandy you know he is too young to get into those places.<br />
<br />
I know but he didn't have anything alcoholic. Brandy lied. But it wasn't much of a lie he didn't have too <br />
much. Just a couple of cosmos the whole evening and he nursed them.<br />
<br />
Ok. Huggs all around. Each one hugged the two men and when they got to Ty each one gave him a big hug too and <br />
as they were heading off Carl said to Jay. Too bad he isn't gay he has a nice ass. Did you feel it.<br />
<br />
Now Ty hadn't really intended to make Tony's parents both men but it seemed as though this came out of the <br />
changes he had made to Tony.</p>
