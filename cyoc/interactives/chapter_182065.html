<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael stood there,  in front of the mirror,  looking at the reversed reflected spitting image of Noah Baxter staring wide-eyed and slack-jawed right back at him. He stood there for some time,  unable to process that this impossibly youthful face, thick eye-length blond hair,  and big green eyes were now the features his mind was stuck looking through. Nothing of himself visible in the reflection. <br />
<br />
Long thin nose,  thick red lips, a small mole on one of his cheeks near his nose, and  his pale cheeks easily and uncontrollably blush. Which they were beginning to do now,  as he felt the heat in them beginning to rise. <br />
<br />
Mike looked downward at the rest of his new shrimpy form. His chest impossibly smooth and narrow. Same with his armpits. Nothing to his pebble-like biceps. All pale-skinned.<br />
<br />
 He especially noted his competely smooth armpits as he raised his left arm again. Absolutely devoid of even tbe slightest hint of even a single hair. <br />
<br />
And his tiny sad little impotent little boy dick! How small and smooth it was! Two tiny little orbs inside a perfectly smooth tight little sack,  sitting up high just beneath his short tiny little pecker. The thought hit him like a ton if bricks. He really WAS a little boy now, as he examined himself &quot;down there&quot; and looked back up at his still-youthfully shocked expression. His cheeks a little redder. The humiliation caused his pecker to stiffen a little bit as a rock formed in the pit of his stomach. A curious feeling<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the principal for whom he was attracted to as a man, suddenly appeared in the bathroom behind him!<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello there, Mike- I mean....NOAH!&quot; <br />
<br />
This scared Mike out of his wits for a moment, not expecting a visitor to just appear like that! His heart jumped as he quickly turned around and backed into the mirror on the door. Luckily,  it didn&#39;t break. <br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun checking out your new body?&quot; she said, looking down at his much smaller naked pale form. <br />
<br />
Mike instinctively covered up his little boyhood as he had to look UP! at this women he formerly had to look slightly down at when standing in front of her in her own office. What the was she doing here,  and how did she get here?<br />
<br />
Mike, in his new 10 year form as Noah, stood in front of his son&#39;s hot principal now in Noah&#39;s childhood home, inside a bathroom,  naked and covering &quot;himself&quot; with his hands.<br />
<br />
The woman chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,  Noah! You ARE adorable!&quot; she said. &quot;But you needn&#39;t hide your little &quot;THINGY!&quot; like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
He hands suddenly fell to his side,  as his tiny little boy pecker was revealed.<br />
<br />
Suddenly,  someone else joined the room. A man! Himself! His body! Both adults lookong down at him, both fully clothed. He was a naked little bky in front of two adults! One was his former self, and the other, the principal for whom he had the hots for. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hehe, I am now dating you. Or rather, the former you!&quot; she said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Im glad I am no longer a little kid. I get to now date my former principal. MY son&#39;s current prinipal. And YOURS!&quot; spoke whoever now occupied his body. Noah, presumsaly. <br />
<br />
&quot;And now I get to take your life, and you,  mine. Your former twin brother is now mine,  and you no longer have one. Instead, you have two older twin brothers who like to sort of pick on you a little bit, &quot; he continued. <br />
<br />
Mike tried to speak, but he suddenly became very shy and wanted to no longer be baked in front of these two fully-clothed adults. Instead,  he left out a little high-pitched squeak as he felt the heat rising in his cheeks. His little pecker standing at attention in its diminutive form, looking up at his domineering new principal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, turn around back to the mirror,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Mike found himself turning around and looking at Noah&#39;s naked image staring back at himself again. As well as the one he was familiar with behind him,  and that of the principal. Both standing tall and dark over his bright pale luttke pathetic form. His little dick standing as tall as it&#39;s own short thin little frame would allow. His cheeks fully flushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And as a reminder of my powers....&quot;<br />
<br />
Mike suddenly froze. His pale little form taking on an ashen color. Then turning gray as all color slowly left his body. He FELT his body hardening. Petrifying. A now familiar feeling as terror gripped his heart. He breathed in a final gulp of air in the attempt to protest,  but it froze in his hardened lungs. He watched helplessly as the green of his eyes turned gray and hardened into stone like the rest of his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nooo!&quot; screamed his trapped mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for your life. Noah!&quot; said the occupant of his former body. &quot;Have fun with mine,&quot; he chuckled. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right. This is your life now. Schoolboy! You just stand there for an hour and think about it. And think of my powers. I COULD keep you as a statue permanantly. And display you anywhere I like,  which would become your new oermanant home. So. No talking to anyone about who you once were. Ever! And I&#39;ll give you an hour of standing there, looking at your statuefied form. Unable to move. Not even so much as to look away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,  we&#39;ve really got to get going. Mike&#39;s family is going to wonder where he&#39;s at. Wouldn&#39;t want his wife to know she was cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both adults laughed as they disappeared, leaving Mike stuck as little 10 year old Noah forever. Stuck as a statue for an hour, forced to do nothing but ponder his new reality.<br />
<br />
Inside, Mike was panicking. He couldn&#39;t move anything. He was forced to stare straight ahead at his naked childish statuefued form. He couldn&#39;t even control his face, which had become an immovable solid mask. Not even his smallest of small boyish fingers. Nothing. No matter what he tried doing, his statue body refused to comply. And so, he was forced to just stand there in stony silence, looking at his own new little boy form. <br />
<br />
A half hour in,  a sort if calmness started sweeping over Mike. Ten minutes later, he found himself getting bored and wanted to do something. Like run around outside. He then began to wonder why he was just standing there,  and attempted to move away. But of course, his body was just made of stone. He tried mentally to move,  but his stone body continued to remain utterly motionless. Mike began to panic again.<br />
<br />
With 15 minutes to go,  he mentally calmed down again. Trying to move, only made it &quot;hurt&quot; in a weird way he couldn&#39;t express. So he stood there in silence still (he had no choice. He was, afterall,  just a stone statue.) But he silenced his mind.<br />
<br />
Five minutes went by, as he was in a trance-like mental state. His mind wandered to getting stuff done. He tried to sigh, as he was wasting the day away,  and wondered why he was just standing there. While in his dream-like trance,  he semi-forgot he was a statue of a young boy. And so, he &quot;woke up&quot; from his mental state and admonished himself for just standing around doing nothing. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why the fuck am I just standing here anyway? I got shit to do, &quot; he thought. &quot;All im doing, is standing here looking at a statue of a naked young boy like some sort of perv....&quot; <br />
<br />
His &quot;stomach&quot; dropped, as he slowly re-realized he was staring at his own reflection! Nothing had changed. At all. His strange youthful face (which wasn&#39;t actually his) was still a cold stone mask. His hands still at his sides. His fingers hadnt even budged even the slightest bit! He was completely and totally stuck! And had been for quite some time!<br />
<br />
He remembered the principal had appeared in the bathroom with him. Lectured him about having to &quot;obey&quot; his &quot;mother,&quot; and going back to grade school as his son&#39;s best friend! He wouldn&#39;t be allowed to tell anyone who he really was. He just had to live tbe life of a kid born merely 10 years ago! She turned him into a stone statue with a 1 hour time limit as a reminder of her power over him,  and the consequences  of making him a permanant fixture at his school.<br />
<br />
Michael had no idea how much time had elapsed. It felt like an eternity,  when it&#39;s only been less than one hour. He shuddered to think about this actually being an eternity. To never do anything ever again. To never talk to anyone ever again. To just be viewed as an object and nothing more. <br />
<br />
Just as hus mind waa beginning to break, he was suddenly released! He collapsed onto the floor of the bathroom on his little round smooth behind,  panting for each gulp of air to fill his once-again fleshy little lungs.  <br />
<br />
Michael started doing something he hadn&#39;t done in decades: he started to cry! Then the principal reappeared yet again in the bathroom! <br />
<br />
The intimidating woman looked down upon the 10 year old crying Noah Baxter, naked on the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Having fun yet?&quot; were her first words upon her latest intrustion. &quot;<br />
<br />
Michael immediately covered his small little boy privates with his hands. Which only made her laugh at his pathetic little form. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; she asked in a faux concerned mocking voice. &quot;You&#39;re upset? Perhaps at your new station in life? Well. You&#39;ll just have to get used to it. You&#39;ll be stuck as this ten year old Catholic school boy. Forever. Unless, of course, you want to be a STATUE of this pathetic little school boy instead? The choice is yours. Remember my simple little rules:&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You MUST dress in your new school uniform and attend the fourth grade. And you MUST keep your mouth shut about your previous identity. Otherwise, there is a stone pedestal with your name on it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But don&#39;t worry your pretty little blond head and big green eyes about it. You are so adorable. Grown women will get a kick out of you,  and you&#39;ll be well-cared for.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. And no need to cover that little worm of your between your legs in my presence. It is now your equipment, and it&#39;s so tiny, as not to be offensive to anyone who may see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then cackled as she vanished for the final time, leaving Michael to his own devices, alone in his new family&#39;s bathroom. Utterly humiliated.<br />
<br />
Sniffling in shame, Michael picked himself back up off the floor and approached the mirror again. A naked 10 year old Noah Baxter&#39;s big green eyes was staring back from under his long blond hair,  with impossibly smooth cheeks.<br />
<br />
He then started checking out the rest of his new shrimpified form,  catching a quick glimpse at the  little boyhood attached to him. Avoiding looking directly at it as he scanned his hairless armpits, his smooth completely flat undefined chest, long thin toes and fingers. As he was searching for any sign at all of his former manhood,  his new shoulder-length blond locks kept falling in front of his big green eyes. He eventually noticed he was flicking his hair from time to time,  and it felt like a habit. <br />
<br />
He looked back up at the mirror,  and was again greeted by Noah&#39;s impossibly young prebubescent face reflected back. Mike took a deep breath, and sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;So I&#39;m stuck like this. I&#39;m stuck as a ten year old....CHILD!&quot; <br />
<br />
The thought stirred something in his little boyhood. It caught his attention,  and looked down. A sad little nub of a penis between his soft smooth legs trying to do its best to stand up. <br />
<br />
The sight made him catch his breath. Not at all a sight he was used to seeing. His new balls the size of small marbles, wrapped up tight in milk-white skin. Not even close to being ready to drop yet,  and not even a wisp of hair anywhere in sight. The nub of his stick itself was short, thin,  and completely smooth.</p>
