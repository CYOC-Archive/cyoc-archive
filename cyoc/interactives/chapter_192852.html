<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Clay lay in his room staring up at the ceiling. It was only his second year of college and he was already flunking out. He had told his parents that he didn’t feel cut out for college, yet they insisted he go. Now he was feeling lost and frankly scared.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Clay remembered that he had the Chronivac 5.0 installed on his smartphone. He had had it for an entire year but only used it for one minor change. He had made his hair green for a day just for fun. Now that he was feeling lost, maybe this incredible program would have some way to get him a more stable footing in life.<br />
<br />
If only he could have a life like one of his parents, already successful and knowing that they are well prepared for the future. While thinking about this, Clay came across a transformation package called “life swap”. Apparently, you could live somebody else’s life and taking their body with it was only optional.<br />
<br />
“Well, I’d rather take mom’s life since she is the homemaker and doesn’t have to work,” said Clay, selecting his mother’s name from the Chronivac’s list of nearby people. He unselected the body swap aspect of the package, not wanting to be in his mom’s saggy body that would make him experience gender dysphoria. Awareness would be off for everyone but him.<br />
<br />
Hitting submit, Clay couldn’t feel anything change. “I knew this cruddy program was bullshit. Probably can’t do anything past changing my hair color,” he said.<br />
<br />
Just then, Clays mom opened the door.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing on my bed, dad?” Asked his mom.<br />
<br />
It took Clay a moment to respond due to the shock of his 50 year old mother calling him dad. He could hardly believe that the Chronivac was this powerful, When he collected himself he said, “Oh sorry mo— Kaitlyn. I had a dizzy spell in the hall and I had to lay down for a moment. I’m fine now.”<br />
<br />
Clay got off his bed and started leaving the room that was his no more than five minutes ago. On his way out, he saw an open dresser drawer and as he suspected, it now contained his mom’s clothes instead of his own. Maybe he had a bed and dresser in his parents’ bedroom.<br />
<br />
Clay got to his parents’ room, or rather his and his dad’s room. He found that his mom’s old dresser now had all of his normal guy clothes in it. To his surprise, there was only one bed in this room. Would the Chronivac really have married him to his own dad?<br />
<br />
As if to answer this subconscious question, Clay’s dad, Larry, walked into the room. “Oh, hey honey,” said Larry.<br />
<br />
“Hey,” said Clay, watching his dad undress after a long days work at the office. He could hardly believe it. His dad was getting naked in front of him like it was no big deal. Truth is, Larry was a bit out of shape. He had put on a bit of fat due to long days of desk work and being too exhausted to go to the gym except on occasion. Despite all of that, Clay thought that his dad was still a very fetching man. His little beer belly was accentuated by his very hairy body and his face was strong and handsome with a mustache, permanent five o’clock shadow, and short spiked up pepper and salt hair.<br />
<br />
Clay had never really let himself think of his dad as being attractive. It was probably from fear of his dad finding out. It was weird to now have the freedom to be attracted to his dad with it being normalized by the Chronivac. He massaged his boner, still watching Larry undress.<br />
<br />
Larry was down to nothing but his underwear, Hanes tighty whities. Clay could’ve jerked out a load just looking at how his dad’s shapely ass and front package were cupped by the white briefs.<br />
<br />
“What’s with you babe?” Asked Larry, “You never get all hot and bothered just from watching me undress. Hell, it’s been a year or so since we’ve even had sex.”<br />
<br />
Clay wrapped his head around what this must’ve meant. He must’ve inherited the history of his parents’ sex life with the life swap, meaning that his parents’ relationship had been not doing so well.<br />
<br />
“Well, I think I’ve been under appreciating you, Larry,” said Clay, still playing with himself and waiting for his dad to take off his underwear.<br />
<br />
Larry slowly and playfully took off his tighty whities, spining them in his pointer finger like a male stripper. Finally Clay could see his dad’s junk. Since it wasn’t erect, it was three inches long, and a bit thicker looking than Clay’s. His balls weren’t all that big but it was all a pretty package to Clay, who was practically drooling, staring at his dad’s junk.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Clay was struck in the face. It was his dad’s tighty whities that had been tossed at him. The smell coming from the crotch was intoxicating. It was making Clays dick leak.<br />
<br />
“I’m gonna take a shower, but maybe later tonight you can show me how much you really wanted the chance to ‘appreciate’ me,” said Larry with a wink to his son. As he left towards the master bathroom, Clay couldn’t help but watch his dad’s shapely ass jiggle with each step.<br />
<br />
“I think I’m gonna like this life,” said Clay to himself when he was alone once again. He held his dad’s tighty whities to his face and inhaled to his heart’s content.</p>
