<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul DeSoto couldn't help but stare.  It was as if -at his <br />
diminished size- his mind was more focused on sexual matters <br />
... he found himself getting more aroused as he looked up at the <br />
seven-foot-tall man.  But it was strange:  as he looked up at <br />
Steve he kept thinking of the neighbor boy, Matt.  It wasn't that his <br />
attractions were not focused on the giant in front of him (he <br />
couldn't deny that) but at his height -four foot six- he couldn't help <br />
but start fantasizing about Matt again.<br />
<br />
The dream from the previous night:  he knew, now, that it couldn't <br />
have been a dream.  But how had this happened?  What had <br />
done this to him, Matt, Steve and every other man he'd run into, <br />
today?<br />
<br />
Steve looked over his shoulder and looked concerned.  &quot;Paul,&quot; <br />
he said, raising an eyebrow, &quot;you're pretty messy, too.  Look, I've <br />
showered with other men back in my Army days ... why don't you <br />
come in here and get cleaned up before your brother and <br />
nephew arrive?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve addressing him brought his attention around once more to <br />
his host.  &quot;Yeah, that's right...  Mike and Josh are on their way...  <br />
Uh...&quot;  Paul stammered, realizing that being around Steve was <br />
only going to make matters worse.  &quot;Look, I dunno...&quot;<br />
<br />
The larger man looked down and put his hands on his hips, <br />
finally turning to face Paul directly.  Paul simply felt his gaze <br />
drawn down Steve's physique to the massive, bull-like testicles <br />
that hung heavily from the mat of curly brown hair that hid his <br />
relatively smaller penis.  Each of Steve's balls were nearly the <br />
size of an orange!  They were the biggest that Paul had seen on <br />
anything other than a horse!  Steve's cock looked abnormally <br />
small by comparison, but was probably normal in size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I won't drop the soap...&quot;<br />
<br />
Paul had to wonder, as Steve put a big hand on his shoulder and <br />
guided him towards the shower, whether or not Steve's words <br />
were foreshadowing.  He blushed and held his baggy clothes <br />
tighter to his body, worried that his raging hard-on would be <br />
seen by his large co-worker should he disrobe and join him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not what I'm worried about...&quot; he said, nervously.  &quot;It's just <br />
that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You got a stiffie; no problem...  Lot's of guys get that; it doesn't <br />
mean anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve's response took Paul off-guard and he looked up with <br />
greater admiration and a tiny bit of lust openly displayed on his <br />
face.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Matt ditched his bike in the bushes outside the house where <br />
he'd seen Mr. DeSoto's car stop.  The man who invited him <br />
inside was one of Mr. DeSoto's co-workers from the construction <br />
site; he was sure of that.  He'd even thought that the guy's name <br />
might be &quot;Steve&quot; but he wasn't sure.  But one look at Mr. DeSoto <br />
clinched it:  the stranger had bigger balls than his neighbor ... Mr. <br />
DeSoto had been shrinking pretty steadily on the drive to his <br />
co-worker's house.<br />
<br />
Having decided to skip school and follow Mr. DeSoto to work and <br />
beyond, Matt had followed him all the way out Route 7 to the <br />
second-string suburbs to this small, isolated neighborhood <br />
nestled in some old growth forest about 10 miles from <br />
downtown.  It was quite a ride and Matt's height of 5'5&quot; (he <br />
checked his driver's license again and it -reassuringly- still read <br />
that height) had made the going tough.  It seemed as if his <br />
wishes the previous day had cost him an inch in height, each ... <br />
something that he'd have to see if he could reverse, later.<br />
<br />
But, now, he had to see what was happening to Mr. DeSoto...<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Paul DeSoto stepped into the tub after Steve and shivered a bit <br />
as he felt himself growing hornier as the world looked slightly <br />
bigger to him.  Steve smiled warmly down at him and pulled the <br />
curtain shut, turning on the water thereafter.  The hot cascade <br />
poured over the two men as Paul turned around to find himself <br />
eyes-to-sternum with his co-worker.<br />
<br />
He'd shrunk about three more inches in the last 10 minutes!<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, Steve...?' he began, but was cut short by his large host <br />
starting to rub shampoo into the smaller man's hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold your breath,&quot; came the interrupting reply, and Paul felt <br />
himself pushed firmly under the flow of water.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;I've got to get in there...&quot; muttered Matt to himself, having walked <br />
around the house, twice, looking for an unlocked door or <br />
window.  His thoughts went to the wand and he drew it out of his <br />
pocket.  &quot;Well, if the price is an inch per wish, I think I could risk <br />
another...&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, he pointed the wand at his temple and said, &quot;I wish I <br />
could watch Mr. DeSoto, no, 'anyone', I wanted from afar...&quot;<br />
<br />
The teen felt a tingling in his eyes and soon, a mist seemed to <br />
rise up in front of them, revealing a steamy shower and the two <br />
men he'd watched earlier under the rich cascades of water and <br />
soap...</p>
