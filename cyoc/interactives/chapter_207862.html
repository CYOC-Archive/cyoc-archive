<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris followed Mike over to his large house. He hesitated to step inside. &quot;You want your check, don&#39;t you?&quot; Mike glared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Chris let out a huff, and did his best to hold his breath. It was better breathing through his mouth than his nose, but the distinct smell of sweat, sex and whatever else those animals must have been up to still permeated his senses. <br />
<br />
&quot;Let me go get my checkbook,&quot; Mike said as he headed to the master bedroom. He pulled out his phone and pulled up the Chronivac. And Mike was going to make sure that Chris really enjoyed him being his neighbor. &#39;Golden lab should do,&#39; he smiled as he slid his phone back into his pocket.<br />
<br />
Chris stepped inside, gawking at the large room. &quot;Pretty big space for just you,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have plenty of guests,&quot; Mike smirked as he wrote the check. &quot;Who should I make it out to?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just me&#39;s fine,&quot; Chris answered. He found himself wandering around the room a bit more than he should have. His conscious breaths were becoming less controlled as the smell didn&#39;t feel quite as imposing as when he first stepped into the house. If anything, he almost felt like he was enjoying it. The thick musk of men surrounded him completely. His stomach started to feel like it had butterflies in it. Though, that might have been more because of Mike.<br />
<br />
The massive muscular tiger was just in a pair of pajama pants and they did very little to hide anything to the imagination. A stupid smile filled his face as he watched that tail swing back and forth so consciously. Each swipe somehow more alluring than the last. But then his front was even more amazing. How someone as old as him could keep such a defined and muscular form was beyond belief. Mike had watched him for years, seen him work outside and just grow. His arms were massive defined boulders, chest and abs perfectly sculpted and cut to show off the clear definition. His neck was wide and imposing and legs looked to be built by the gods. <br />
<br />
&quot;--want?&quot; Mike asked.<br />
<br />
Chris felt himself jump. His eyes had glazed over and he wasn&#39;t quite thinking properly. &quot;Sorry. What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this all you wanted?&quot; Mike asked again. There was a deviousness behind his eyes, but Chris couldn&#39;t quite see it. Just the smell of his sweat filled fur was making it hard for him to think. &quot;Hmm?&quot; He held the check up to Chris.<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-y-yeah. That&#39;ll do it,&quot; Chris nodded. He reached out for it, but was surprised to see Mike pull it away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Mike tilted his head a bit. &quot;Is that all you wanted?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt like he had to clear his throat. He was suddenly feeling incredibly hot. Something felt different. His tongue lolled out of his mouth as he nodded. &quot;Ith ees,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s smile only widened as he watched the changes start to occur. When Chris&#39; tongue grew too large for his mouth and hung out, he knew full well he just needed a few more minutes to really seal the deal. Chris&#39; nose was already turning black and growing wet. Far larger and sharper teeth started to fill his mouth as a snout began to form where his human face had been. His brown hair turned to a bright gold color and quickly filled into soft fur. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; Mike continued. &quot;And what if I could offer you a treat?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Treat?&quot; Excitement filled Chris&#39; body at the word. He felt something in his back start to move. He didn&#39;t know how he could forget about his tail. It was why he was so bad at closing deals in the office. The moment anyone saw it start to wag, they knew he&#39;d get too excited over the offer. The extension behind him only grew longer and wagged faster. More golden fur grew on his tail as it continued to speed up at the word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. A real big bone,&quot; Mike smiled as he grabbed his cock. With just his pajama pants on, it was nearly impossible to miss. The large member easily filled the space in his right pant leg. &quot;How does that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chris felt himself choke out the word, &quot;G-g-good. Real good.&quot; His eyes were trained on the massive cock. He didn&#39;t even notice as his belly started to recede and thin lithe muscle took its place. His golden fur covered it up, but he didn&#39;t really care. Size was for guys like Mike. He just had way too much energy to properly lift the same way Mike did. And honestly, he preferred running to it anyways. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? So, you&#39;d rather like a taste of this bone than a check?&quot; Mike pulled out his massive cock and Chris&#39; jaw dropped. <br />
<br />
His puppy dog eyes went wide as he saw the massive rod pointed directly at him. The only thing he could think about was that cock. He followed it as it waved back and forth at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; Mike ordered. Chris felt his body pause. Every one of his muscles flexed as he wanted to leap up and suckle the massive cock in front of him. &quot;Wait...&quot; Chris was practically drooling as he saw the head leaking onto the floor in front of him. He panted in anticipation. &quot;Wait...&quot; Mike loved watching Chris&#39; ears pull back as lurched forward slightly after each word. &quot;Go get it boy. Go on!&quot; <br />
<br />
Chris jumped up at the signal. His face plunged into Mike&#39;s cock, running his tongue over the massive cock. He let out a deep breath as he licked the side, sliding it down the thick shaft and focusing on the head. Chris&#39; lips suckled on the tip. He felt Mike&#39;s massive hand grab the back of his head and push more of the cock inside of him. Chris&#39; looked up as he felt it throb inside him. His body felt light and loose as his snout pressed against Mike&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Mike&#39;s claws dug into his skull as Chris continued to lap up his cock. He could feel the blood flowing through him so quickly as the other man pleased him. And judging by just how fast that tail was going, Chris was enjoying it just as much as he was. Though, it was starting to get hard to hold on. Somehow, Chris was an absolute master. His tongue skills were better than Mike had expected. Or maybe it was just his enthusiasm as licked and lapped up every bit of his cock.<br />
<br />
Mike felt his dick throb again. His hand clenched the back Chris&#39; head and unloaded. A loud roar filled the quiet house as Chris took a massive load down his throat. The dog was not one to let his treat go to waste and whatever dripped out of his mouth he eagerly licked off the floor. &quot;Good boy,&quot; Mike said. Chris&#39; tail wagged faster at the compliment. &quot;Though, next time you wanna have some alone time. Just ask. Alright? No need to get this money business or threats or whatever.&quot; Chris nodded in agreement and went back to his treat as it dripped out of Mike&#39;s cock.</p>
