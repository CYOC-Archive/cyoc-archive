<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Let's freshen up first,&quot; Rachel said.  &quot;Oh, and get dressed, of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But why bother?&quot; I laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because,&quot; she explained.  &quot;We should let ourselves be affected by the no clothes wish even though we're <br />
behind it.  It'll be more fun.  And...&quot; she said as she got off the couch and gathered her pajamas, &quot;we should <br />
have some people come over to see the effects of the wishes on others, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
I moved myself to a sitting position.  &quot;OK, but who should that be?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Didn't you say you have siblings?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea,&quot; I said.  &quot;A brother and a sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How old are they?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're both younger than me,&quot; I answered.  &quot;My brother Scott is 26 and my sister Pam is 22.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm the same age as Scott,&quot; said Rachel.  &quot;And you're...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;29,&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, how about you invite them over after we've made the wishes,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'll call one of my girlfriends.  <br />
Someone you don't know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as they agree,&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
We took our time getting ready.  We had all the time in the world, since I wasn't due at work and Rachel <br />
didn't have to work today either.  Once we were both fully dressed we sat down on the couch.  With great care <br />
and detail we made the wishes we had discussed.  We wished that every man on the planet would change into a <br />
woman.  We wished for the change to be gradual, painless, and to be complete by night of the next day.  We <br />
wished that everyone, man or woman, would know the change would take place, but that everyone would be <br />
accepting of it and not be concerned with why it happened.  We wished that over the same time period, everyone <br />
would gradually shed their clothing.  We wished that to happen in such a way that at random times over the <br />
next two days, a piece of clothing would make a person uncomfortable so they would just take it off and never <br />
put it on again.  We also wished for it to be random as to what piece of clothing would do this, so as to <br />
create some differences in the process.  We decided to add the fact that no one would really be aware that <br />
this change took place, but that everyone just did it without a second thought.  We figured it will feel <br />
somewhat more natural that way.  However, once everyone was naked, we wished that everyone would understand <br />
and accept this as being normal.  We wished that everyone would stop physically aging once at their prime <br />
physical condition, and for everyone currently older than that to de-age until they were in such a condition.  <br />
We wished that people would still recognize family, friends and acquaintances, even after the changes <br />
completed.  We also made the necessary wishes for people to not be affected by weather and to be able to walk <br />
bare foot without suffering pain from anything that might cause it.  Since we decided to not make people <br />
overtly aware of removing their clothing until it was over, we decided this change wouldn't be evident until <br />
that time either.  And as a final wish for now, we wished that someone would find a way to make sure humanity <br />
could survive in a world of nothing but women.<br />
<br />
&quot;One more wish you need to make,&quot; Rachel advised.  &quot;Make sure everything starts now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yea,&quot; I agreed.  &quot;No since waiting around for this one.  I wish that all of the wishes I just made will <br />
begin to take effect immediately.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rachel and I looked at each other and smiled.  Then I saw the expression on her face change.  Suddenly her <br />
eyes rolled back into her head and she passed out.  Before I had a chance to figure out what was wrong, I felt <br />
an intense but unseen force hit my entire body.  My eyes rolled back into my head and then there was sudden <br />
darkness.<br />
<br />
The next thing I knew I felt a hand on my cheek and heard a voice frantically calling my name.  I managed to <br />
open my eyes as my senses slowly returned to me.  My eyes focused on the image of Rachel.  She slapped me <br />
lightly on the cheek and said, &quot;Joe!  Joe!  Joe, wake up!&quot;  She looked very scared.  &quot;Oh, thank heavens,&quot; she <br />
said as she spied my eyes opening.  &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head a few times.  &quot;I don't know,&quot; I admitted.  &quot;Something force hit me and...that was it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what I felt, too,&quot; she said.  &quot;Was that the effect of our wishes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so,&quot; I said.  &quot;Never thought that would happen.&quot;  I glanced at my watch.  About five minutes had <br />
passed since we made all of the wishes.  &quot;At least it didn't last very long.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how will we know everything worked?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
I grinned.  &quot;Hopefully this way,&quot; I said.  I picked up the remote control and turned on the TV to one of the <br />
news channels.  What we got was an emergency test pattern.  I switched to a few more channels and they were <br />
much the same.  &quot;I guess everyone got hit by that force,&quot; I said.  I went back to the original channel and we <br />
waited for a minute.  The broadcast returned and everything appeared to be normal.<br />
<br />
Normal, that was, except for the news story that was reported.  The news anchor reported that humanity was <br />
about to undergo a massive change.  With succinct precision, all of the changes we wished for were reported by <br />
the news anchor.  He reported that every male would change into a female by the end of the next day.  He also <br />
reported that people would stop aging physically and that older people would de-age.  He made no mention of <br />
clothing being shed, or of humanity then being resistant to weather.  So far, everything worked perfectly.  <br />
The news anchor added that no one knew how or why these changes were about to happen.  He also said that those <br />
things didn't seem important anyway.  He did say that the big question remained how would humanity survive <br />
with an all female population.  So apparently that news was still to come.<br />
<br />
Rachel bounded off the couch and jumped up and down in celebration.  &quot;Yay, it worked!  It worked!&quot; she <br />
exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like,&quot; I said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you mind if I get a little kinky?&quot; she asked.  I shook my head.  &quot;I really hope you end up with some big <br />
tits.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shot her an odd look.  &quot;Are you sure you're not only into women?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm,&quot; she said as she put a finger up to her chin.  &quot;Did we just have sex and did I not enjoy the hell out of <br />
it?  You're right, that was someone else.&quot;  She walked over to me and playfully slapped me on the cheek.  <br />
&quot;Naughty boy.  Soon to be naughty girl.  So come on, call your brother and sister.  I'll call my friend.&quot;</p>
