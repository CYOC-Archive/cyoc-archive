<br />
&quot;Sir?&quot; Agent Reed&#39;s voice was a surprise on a Sunday afternoon. Bryan Johnson was lying in his hotel room, watching a football game and reading a paper. <br />
<br />
“Brooke, what’s up? Didn&#39;t I tell you to relax? Take the weekend off?” Bryan asked, setting his paper to the side. <br />
<br />
“Um, yes. But I’m calling because a man has spotted Bower.” she said in her small voice.<br />
<br />
“Where?” Bryan sat up, and went into full US Marshal mode. He turned the TV off, and stood. He was in casual clothing, a sweater and jeans. He moved to his suitcase to find something a bit more formal as Agent Reed spoke.<br />
<br />
“A local picked him up at a rest stop. Wasn’t aware of who Bower was until later in the day. Saw a news bulletin about Bower. Anyway, you’ll never guess where the man dropped Bower off.”<br />
<br />
“Reed, I’m in no mood for guessing games. If Bower gets away again….”<br />
<br />
“He’s in Moon Lake sir. The local dropped him off on the outskirts of town. He’s got one bag with him, probably stolen. But he’s there sir. We’ll get him this time.”<br />
<br />
“Let’s hope so. I don’t want a big fuss. If he tries to contact the Lawsons, Evan knows to call. I just hope he won’t take matters into his own hands. You saw how angry he got when we told him Bower had escaped. Thought the man was going to explode.” Bryan said, changing into a proper shirt and tie. <br />
<br />
Evan Lawson certainly was an intimidating fellow. Then again, Navy SEALs generally were intimidating. They had to be. Bryan saw how Bower, and even Lawson’s own daughter, seemed to shrink back from him. If he’d had his way, he would have investigated the father further. Or the entire family. Something about them was off. Like Moon Lake. <br />
<br />
“Did you contact Walker?” Bryan asked. <br />
<br />
“Yes sir. He’s coordinating with the local police. I haven’t contacted Moon Lake’s mayor, or the Lawsons yet. I thought that you’d…”<br />
<br />
“Damn straight I would. Thanks Brooke. I want you and Walker ready to go. You’re at the headquarters…? Well be there. I’ll be there in fifteen minutes, after I make those calls. And keep this quiet. I don’t want a panic, and I DON”T want the media to find out.” Bryan said hanging up. <br />
<br />
On his way out the door, he was busy dialing the number of Moon Lake’s city hall. Then a thought occurred to him. It was Sunday. No one would be there.<br />
<br />
“Damn it.” he said. He got into the elevator, and tried to think of ways he could contact the mayor, or at the very least the town chancellor, Twist. Bryan did a quick internet search for her, and came up with her wife, Dr. Francis Twist MD, and her office number. <br />
<br />
“Better than nothing.” he thought. He doubted he’d get through to anyone, but it was better to try. He was even more surprised when someone picked up.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” A woman asked. <br />
<br />
“Um, hello. Is this Francis Twist?” Bryan asked. He’d entered the hotel garage, and began looking for his car. The dim parking lot lighting made it hard, and he was a little preoccupied with his phone call. <br />
<br />
“Yes, how can I help you?” <br />
<br />
“Um… sorry I didn’t think I’d get anyone on the phone. It’s Sunday and the listing said this was your office number.”<br />
<br />
“I have the calls forwarded on the weekends. Now, who is this?”<br />
<br />
“Oh right sorry. Agent Bryan Johnson, with the US Marshals. I was trying to get in contact with your wife, but…”<br />
<br />
“Say no more. I can go get her.” Francis said. Bryan waited until Samantha came to the phone. Meanwhile, he got into his car, and placed the phone on his dashboard, on speaker. He tore out of the parking lot, and headed for the marshal building. <br />
<br />
“Hello, Agent Johnson?” Samantha Twist asked, nervously. She knew that if he was calling on a weekend something serious must be going on.<br />
<br />
“Are you somewhere private?” <br />
<br />
“I can be. I take it this isn’t just a leisure call.” Samantha said, excusing herself. She and Francis were eating lunch with Ben on their porch. She slipped inside, and into the kitchen. She didn’t want to worry them. <br />
<br />
“No. It’s about Bower. I’ve got my agents in motion already, they’re in contact with the police. But I need you to alert the mayor, and anyone else you think should know.”<br />
<br />
“What do they need to know?” Samantha pressed, her anticipation building more than more with every passing second. <br />
<br />
“Bower’s been spotted. A local, didn’t know who he was apparently, dropped him off at Moon Lake’s city limits. He’s here.” Bryan said, taking a sharp corner. Samantha is silent for a moment, then she too springs into action.<br />
<br />
“The Lawsons, have they been told?” <br />
<br />
“I was going to make the call after I finished with you.” <br />
<br />
“If it’s all the same to you, I can tell them. I was going over to their place anyway.” <br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“It’s a long story.” Samantha said, not wanting to explain her entire life to Agent Johnson. <br />
<br />
“Well, if you think you can handle Evan Lawson, then by all means, tell him. But don’t cause too much of a scene. We want to capture Bower as quietly as possible. Discretion is key. Agent Reed and I will be along after I confirm things on my end.”<br />
<br />
“I’ll call the mayor, and the police chief after I see to the Lawsons.” Samantha said. <br />
<br />
“Thank you Ms. Twist. Despite all the problems we’ve had in the past, I appreciate the help you’ve offered.” Bryan said.<br />
<br />
“We all want the same thing. Methods may be a bit different, but at the end of the day everyone wants Jeremy Bower out of our hair.” Samantha said. With that, and a quick goodbye, she hung up. Then grabbed her car keys, and raced out the door. <br />
<br />
“I’ll explain later.” she said on her way out, kissing Francis and Ben who looked equally confused by Samantha’s haste. They sat on the porch, watching as she jumped into her car and pulled out onto the street in less than ten seconds. Samantha tore off in the direction of the Lawson’s house. <br />
<br />
“Did that have anything to do with the prisoner?” Ben asked. He’d heard the beginning of his mother’s phone conversation. And though he didn’t know much, he knew the man was dangerous. And a were, which complicated things to say the least. <br />
<br />
“I know it was.” Francis said, her voice filled with worry. Not just for her wife, but for the Lawsons. She knew Evan Lawson had an explosive temper, and nothing would stop him from keeping his daughter safe. Even if he did something rash, or even violent. Francis took out her own phone, and sent a quick text to Samantha before dialing another number. <br />
<br />
“Call Alex, tell him to come over to our place after Samantha finishes there. I have a feeling things are going to get pretty tense.” Francis said, the phone ringing in her other ear. Ben nodded, and went off to make his own call.<br />
<br />
“Hello?” Martha Anderson’s voice rang clear in Francis’ ear. <br />
<br />
“Martha, are you at the Lawson’s yet?” <br />
<br />
“Just got here, why?” <br />
<br />
“Can you go somewhere private?” Francis asked, knowing there were probably six or more sets of sensitive ears listening. <br />
<br />
“Uh yes. Hang on.” Martha said, mirroring the concerned looks on the faces around the room. She slipped into the downstairs bathroom and immediately asked Francis what was going on. <br />
<br />
In her car, Samantha slowed to read the text Francis sent her.<br />
<br />
“TELLING THE ANDERSONS WHAT’S GOING ON.” Francis had written. Samantha had forgotten about them, they’d be at the Lawsons, as would Alex. And presumably Elle and Jonathan. But at least the latter two knew the situation too. Samantha didn’t waste time to text anything back. She kept going, while her wife gave Martha the full story about Jeremy Bower, and why he had come to Moon Lake.</p>
