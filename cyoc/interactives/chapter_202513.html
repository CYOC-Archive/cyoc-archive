<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tom was laying on the cold hardwood floor of his kitchen, curled up next to his dog, now mate, Max. He was tired. In the middle of the night he had been taken, willingly, by Max five times. His pussy was sore, but he found he loved the feeling.  He felt like he was fulfilling a purpose. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up Tom!&quot; Samantha demanded, standing over Tom as he slept. <br />
<br />
Tom was jolted from his slumber and sprang to his four paws. His tail tucked, as it usually was, between his legs as he looked up at the angry black woman. <br />
<br />
&quot;Did you have a fun night? Slut?&quot; Samantha scolded. <br />
<br />
All Tom could do was look down and whimper. Even though he enjoyed being mated, he also felt ashamed. He had lowered himself from being a human man to being a dog and not only a dog, but a bitch. <br />
<br />
&quot;You should be ashamed of yourself.&quot; Samantha continued. &quot;and you know what?! If you enjoy being fucked so much I have an idea!&quot; Samantha quickly turned around and stomped out of the room. <br />
<br />
Tom watched his wife leave the room, he was too afraid of her to follow. Tom figured that it was because of being a greyhound that caused him to be so submissive, even after having his intelligence set to a 1, he figured that meant that 10 percent of his brain was infact transformed into a dog&#39;s brain. <br />
<br />
Max, during all this, had gotten up and walked over to his food dish, that Samantha had filled up before waking them both up. Tom realized that he had not eaten since being turned into a dog and he was starving. He figured that Samantha would not have prepared him any human food, so he walked over to the second bowl she has set out for him. Unfortunately for him, she had not filled it with any food for him to eat. Tom whined, looking at the empty bowl. <br />
<br />
Tom looked over that the bowl Max was eating from and couldn&#39;t help but smell the gross kibbles he was eating, but his hunger got the better of him.  Tom slowly padded over to his dog Max, his head lower in submission. As he got closer, Max stopped eating, his muzzle still in the food bowl. Then Tom heard a deep menacing growl coming from Max and next his muzzle started to show his sharp teeth. <br />
<br />
&#39;He won&#39;t hurt me.&#39; Tom thought to himself. &#39;I was his master who loves him and I let him mate with me all night!&#39; Tom continued his slow approach.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Max bark and snarled loudly and jumped at Tom. Max&#39;s teeth dug into Tom&#39;s neck as Tom was thrown to the ground and pinned their by his pet. Max held Tom on the ground, his grip growing slightly tighter. Tom was terrified! He thought Max might kill him. He couldn&#39;t help but piss on the floor in fear. <br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Tom heard another menacing growl and bark as another dog came running from the other room and pounced onto Max, throwing the beast off Tom. The two dogs tumbled onto the ground, growling and biting at each other. <br />
<br />
Tom didn&#39;t question it and quickly sprang to his feet and ran into the other room. He could hear the two dogs fighting in the kitchen. Only after he had gotten to a safe distance, did Tom become curious as to who his savior was. He peaked his head into the kitchen, and pinning his dog Max to the floor was a big, muscular, handsome, Rottweiler. <br />
<br />
The rottweiler had Max pinned to the ground by the neck, teeth digging into Max&#39;s neck much like he had done to Tom moments before. <br />
<br />
Max whined and whimpered. His tail tucked between his legs. This seemed to have satisfied the rottweilers need for dominance. Max was allowed to be freed. Max slowly stood up, tail tucked. Max looked over at Tom and slowly started walking over, but the rottweiler quickly moved between Tom and Max and snarled at Max. <br />
<br />
The rottweilers rear was aimed at Tom, and Tom couldn&#39;t help but look. Hanging between the rottweilers rear legs was a very impressive pair of balls in a black furred sack. The beast was a good 20lbs heavier than Max. His muscular legs and back covered in his short black fur was making Tom wet. He was a slut, he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
The rottweiler growled again at Max. &#39;Outside!&#39; Tom heard the voice of his wife speak and he could have sworn it came from the rottweiler. Max slowly lowered his head and turned to go out the back door that Samantha had apparently left open. <br />
<br />
Once Max was outside, the rottweiler spun around to face Tom. <br />
<br />
&#39;So? What do you think of this body?&#39; Tom heard the female voice of his wife, coming from the massive rottweiler before him. Samantha tried to pose, like a human body builder would do, in front of her husband. <br />
<br />
&#39;What....did you do?&#39; Tom whimpered. <br />
<br />
Samantha stared at her husband. &#39;I think it&#39;s pretty obvious, isn&#39;t it? I figured, if you can enjoy being female, I can enjoy having a dick and balls.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Why did you do this to yourself?&#39; Tom asked, his eyes slowly drifting towards Samantha&#39;s package again. He could see her sheath, and even though he couldn&#39;t see her red rocket, based on the size of her sheath he knew it would probably be massive when hard. <br />
<br />
Samantha noticed his stare. &#39;oh yea that thing. It felt so odd when that ball sack and penis pushed from my vagina, but it feels kinda nice now. Airy down there. Though, these balls feels weird when I walk.&#39; <br />
<br />
&#39;Well...how long did you set the transformation for?&#39; Tom asked curiously? <br />
<br />
&#39;I figured one hour would be long enough.&#39; Samantha stated.<br />
<br />
&#39;Long enough for what?&#39; Tom asked, starting to have a bad feeling.<br />
<br />
&#39;long enough to make sure you get to enjoy dog dicks for the rest of you sad shortened life....&#39; Samantha grinned, as much as a rottweiler could.  &#39;By that smell coming from your rear, I can tell you&#39;re attracted to this body. I figured you would be, you seemed like a submissive bitch who would love a dominating male.&#39; <br />
<br />
Tom could see Samantha&#39;s dick slowly starting to peek it&#39;s tip out of her sheath, as the sheath was growing larger from her growing erection.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh...that feels weird...but I like it!&#39; Samantha explained. <br />
<br />
Tom was transfixed on the growing penis. He watched it grow and push out of her sheath until it was fully revealed in all it&#39;s red, veiny, glory. <br />
<br />
&#39;Wow....&#39; was all Tom could muster. <br />
<br />
&#39;You are such a slut. You didn&#39;t even flinch when I said I was going to make sure I knock you up! I think I made the right choice!&#39; Samantha said as she made her way around the back side of her small greyhound husband. &#39;Oh and by the way. I set my intelligence to 4, so don&#39;t expect me to be gentle. I did that so I wouldn&#39;t back down from this!&#39;<br />
<br />
Tom had a brief moment of clarity after hearing this. &#39;Wait... Samantha...I&#39;m not sure I want to stay this way...&#39; he whimpered. <br />
<br />
&#39;Well too late buttercup. I can see that swollen pussy now and I can feel my instincts kicking in. You are about to be fucked. Oh and call me SAM!&#39; <br />
<br />
Tom started to panic and decided to....</p>
