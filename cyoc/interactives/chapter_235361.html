<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Oasis woke up, her head pounded with a dull ache, a reminder of the previous night&#39;s adventures. She groggily sat up, rubbing her temples, and squinted against the morning light filtering through the window. She glanced over at Maria, who was still asleep in the bed across from her, and decided to let her friend rest a little longer.<br />
<br />
She made her way to the kitchen, her steps slow and her mind still foggy from sleep. She opened the cabinet and grabbed the bottle of aspirin, popping two pills into her mouth. She filled a glass with water and swallowed the pills, hoping they would kick in soon and alleviate her headache.<br />
<br />
As she leaned against the counter, she heard Maria stirring in the other room. A moment later, Maria shuffled into the kitchen, her hair disheveled and her eyes bleary with sleep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Maria mumbled, rubbing her eyes. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oasis sighed, &quot;Morning. I&#39;ve got a bit of a headache, but I&#39;ll live. How about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria smiled, stretching her arms above her head. &quot;I&#39;m good. Last night was wild, huh?&quot; she said, grinning at the memory.<br />
<br />
Oasis nodded, a small smile playing on her lips. &quot;Yeah, it was something else,&quot; she said, her mind briefly flashing back to Jake and the intense experience they had shared.<br />
<br />
She turned to the fridge, opening it to grab some milk for her cereal. She frowned as she realized the milk carton was empty. &quot;Ugh, we&#39;re out of milk,&quot; she complained, her voice laced with annoyance.<br />
<br />
Maria looked over, her brow furrowing. &quot;Again? That&#39;s annoying. Guess we&#39;ll have to go out and get some more,&quot; she said, running a hand through her tangled hair.<br />
<br />
Oasis sighed, her head still pounding. &quot;I wish we didn&#39;t have to go out to have milk,&quot; she muttered, her voice groggy with sleep. As the words left her mouth, she froze, her eyes widening as she realized what she had just done.<br />
<br />
Maria chuckled, &quot;Well, unless you can magically make milk appear, we&#39;re going to have to. But it can wait till later. Let&#39;s just have some toast or something for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oasis nodded, her mind racing as she closed the fridge door and turned back to Maria. They chatted idly as they made breakfast, their conversation filled with laughter and shared memories of the previous night. But Oasis couldn&#39;t shake the feeling of dread that was settling in the pit of her stomach. She knew she had made another wish, and she had no idea what the consequences would be.<br />
<br />
As they sat down to eat, Maria looked at Oasis, her eyes narrowing slightly. &quot;Hey, did you spill something on your tank top?&quot; she asked, gesturing to Oasis&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
Oasis looked down and her heart skipped a beat. There were two small wet patches on her tank top, right over her nipples. She quickly covered her chest with her arms, her face flushing with embarrassment and fear. &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t know what that is,&quot; she stammered, her mind racing.<br />
<br />
Maria raised an eyebrow, a playful smirk on her lips. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re lactating, Oasis. Are you secretly a mom now or something?&quot; she joked, laughing at her own comment.<br />
<br />
Oasis forced a laugh, her heart pounding in her chest. &quot;Yeah, right. I must have just spilled something. I&#39;m going to go change,&quot; she said, quickly standing up and making her way to her room.<br />
<br />
As she closed the door behind her, she looked down at her chest, her eyes wide with disbelief and fear. Her nipples were protruding, hardening and darkening right before her eyes. She watched in horror as her breasts began to swell, the skin stretching taut, the veins becoming more visible as they snaked their way across her expanding flesh.<br />
<br />
She gasped, her hands flying to her chest, feeling the warmth and the weight of her growing breasts. They ached, the pressure building as they filled with milk, the sensation unlike anything she had ever experienced before. She could feel the milk ducts expanding, the tissue growing denser and more sensitive with each passing second.<br />
<br />
Her breasts continued to grow, the skin stretching to accommodate their increasing size. She watched as they rounded out, their shape shifting from their usual perky form to a much fuller, heavier globe. The areolas darkened and widened, the nipples growing larger and more pronounced, standing erect and proud amidst the swelling mounds of flesh.<br />
<br />
She groaned loudly, the weight of her growing breasts becoming almost unbearable. She could feel the pressure building, the milk filling her breasts, making them feel hot and tender to the touch. She cupped them in her hands, her fingers sinking into the soft, pliant flesh, the weight of them spilling over her palms.<br />
<br />
Her breath came in short gasps as she watched her breasts grow larger and larger, their size now comparable to that of grapefruits. The skin was stretched tight, the veins prominent and pulsating with each beat of her heart. She could feel the milk sloshing inside them, the pressure building to an almost unbearable level.<br />
<br />
A knock at her door startled her. &quot;Oasis? Are you okay?&quot; Maria&#39;s voice was filled with concern.<br />
<br />
Oasis hesitated, her heart pounding in her chest. She looked down at her swollen, leaking breasts, her mind racing with fear and uncertainty. Slowly, she cracked open the door, peeking out at Maria.<br />
<br />
Maria&#39;s expression shifted immediately as she caught sight of Oasis&#39;s transformed chest. Her jaw dropped, and her eyes widened in shock and disbelief. &quot;Oasis, what the hell happened to you?&quot; she exclaimed, her voice rising in pitch with each word.<br />
<br />
Oasis stood there, her body trembling, her breasts heaving with each breath. She had no idea how to explain what had happened, how to put into words the bizarre transformation that just took place.<br />
