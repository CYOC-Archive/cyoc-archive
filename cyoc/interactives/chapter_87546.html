<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Samantha felt the tingle rush through her body as she began to grow back up. Examining her body she could see she was beginning to grow taller. Although not looking in a mirror she estimated she was ten again. Looking over at Katie and Mary Elise Samantha&#39;s suspicions were confirmed, the girls had returned to their previous height and were rapidly approaching teen hood.<br />
<br />
Samantha looked over her body as she went from eleven to twelve. The signs of puberty were returning as her breasts began to inflate and her hips began to flare. As she became thirteen her height continued to increase as her breasts became the size of softballs. An odd feeling crept over Samantha as she felt a bra appear around her body. Alarmed at first Samantha remembered Katie mentioning that if choose to she could adjust people&#39;s clothes as they became older or younger. Finally fourteen Samantha let out a sigh of relief as she examined her body.<br />
<br />
Samantha appeared to be a typical girl of fourteen with slightly flared hips, small b cup breasts and coltish legs. What surprised Samantha the most was her outfit, her shirt had transformed into a purple tank top with stylish athletic shorts. Samantha&#39;s purple socks remained on her feet but Samantha didn&#39;t mind, the socks actually looked cute on her and if she found them too embarrassing she could always take them off.  Looking at Katie and Mary Elise she took in their appearance and smiled.<br />
<br />
Katie and Mary Elise had progressed to fourteen in a similar fashion. The girls now had delicate teenage feature with small perky breasts, flared hips and coltish legs. Their clothes had also adjusted so that they appeared to be ordinary teenage girls. &quot;Thanks for this Katie,&quot; Samantha said. &quot;Where&#39;s Jake I want to go see him.&quot; &quot;He&#39;s probably outside right now his regression should be complete.&quot; Katie said pointing towards the door. Samantha smiled widely and and quickly ran towards the door.<br />
<br />
As Katie and Mary Elise saw the teenage Samantha run towards the door Mary Elsie couldn&#39;t help but laugh softly. &quot;Now I understand why she was so mad about being a kid the first time.&quot; She said. Puzzled Katie looked at her sister. &quot;What do you mean Mary?&quot; She asked. Mar Elsie smiled at Katie before answering. &quot;Samantha has found her soulmate. Someone that no matter how long your around them, no matter how different you might be from that person every time you see them is like falling in love for the first time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think we might find our soulmates right here,&quot; Katie asked. Mary Elise smiled. &quot;Finding a soulmate is one in a billion,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s just find a nice guy to give you a first kiss.&quot; <br />
<br />
As Samantha exited the parking lot she could feel her heart racing. She wondered what Jake would look like as she had only seen old pictures of him as a boy. While the idea of them being the same age was exciting she was saddened a little by the idea. She always liked the he had been older than her as if he were her big protector. Staring across the parking lot her heart skipped a beat.<br />
<br />
A young teenage boy in oversized clothes was looking over the parking lot. The boy had a confused look on his face as he tried figure out where he was, what seemed to trouble him even more was the fact that the slacks and short sleeved shirt seemed overly large. Samantha&#39;s heart fluttered as she approached the boy. &quot;Hi there,&quot; she squeaked.<br />
<br />
The boy turned to face Samantha and smiled. Samantha immediately knew it was Jacob. While his face was now smooth and young his steel grey eyes were an immediate identifier. The boy quickly ran his hands through his dark hair and approached Samantha causing the girl to flush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi how are you,&quot; Jake said, his voice cracking slightly. Samantha giggled at the sound of his pubescent voice. &quot;I&#39;m good,&quot; Samantha answered averting her eyes from the very cute boy in front of her. &quot;You left in such a rush I was wondering if you wanted to grab something to eat.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob looked at the young teen with a confused look on his face. His thoughts were a bit muddled but the girl looked familiar looking at her pigtails Samantha&#39;s name immediately popped into his head. &quot;Your Sammy right,&quot; Samantha nodded enthusiastically and smiled. &quot;Yeah I remember talking to you inside how could I forget those pigtails.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pigtails?!&quot; Samantha questioned as she reached for her hair. As her hands brushed against the long pigtails in her hair she turned a deep crimson. In her haste to find Jacob she had forgotten that her hair was still braided. &quot;Oh..yeah..the uh...pigtails...yeah.....damn it.&quot; Samantha sighed, once again she had embarrassed herself,this time in front of the love her life. Jacob laughed softly and placed his hands upon the young teens shoulder. &quot;I love the pigtails, it&#39;s definitely different...I like different.&quot;  He said blushing slightly himself. &quot;Lunch sounds great Sammy let&#39;s go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jacob wiped his sweaty palm on the side of his pants and held out his hand. Excitedly Samantha grasped his hand as the two teens reentered the restaurant.</p>
