<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">August was overtaken by lust, you were conflicted on what to do, and Barsein was only going to be gone for a few minutes. You don’t want your adventurer days to end with you becoming some centaurs partner. But becoming part horse would feel good. Besides, you’ve already got so much of their magic worked into you. You’re just some small submissive guy waiting to be bred and loved and protected and-<br />
<br />
The door creaks opened, a spotted orange and black furred hand turning the handle. An animalistic head poking through the small opening. It looks like a hyena, a gnoll?! No, the fur isn’t wild enough and the heads a bit small. A beastkin then? Half beast and half human, they’re more sane than a full monster. But also still very dangerous.<br />
<br />
The hyena’s head turns to you, mischievous look joined by a distinct laugh. Though he keeps quiet as he steps inside and closes the door. A more athletic type, with torn brown shorts. Clearly once long pants, just altered to end just above the knees, and to have a hole for his tail. His shirt doesn’t fair any better, torn in the centre to show his runners chest, and ripped before the elbows to let his arms breath. The beastman covered in mostly dull orange fur, though it’s spotted around his shoulders and back. <br />
<br />
The hyena holds a brown sack in his right arm, flung over his shoulder and about a quarter filled. It’s bigger than his torso, well made and sealed by a knot of rope. The beastman moving over to the nearby table and drawers. Taking whatever valuables he can find. From gold to gems, and stuffing it inside. Robbing this centaur as if it’s his routine, and making small talk while he’s at it.<br />
<br />
“So. How’s your day been?”<br />
<br />
“U-uh”<br />
<br />
“That good huh? Yeah, well. Horses are like that. Should see the horsemen back home, they’re something else!”<br />
<br />
He has already taken everything he can and moved closer to the kitchen. Deft hands working with keen eyes, nabbing objects at a rapid pace. So fast that you can’t even catch what he steals. This hyena offering you a few sneaky looks. Exaggerating his expression while doing so. Giving you a good show of his sharp teeth as he finishes up in the current area.<br />
<br />
“So been here for long?”<br />
<br />
“A... Minute?”<br />
<br />
“Nice! Enjoying the sights?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yes?”<br />
<br />
His idle chatter confuses you. Why is he speaking to you? Or here to begin with? The man now gathering more objects that are by your side. Having taken almost half the house, then stealing the last thing he’s after. Picking you up by the shoulder. Straining a bit as he gets the bag opened and throws you inside. You realise what’s happening too late to struggle, cut off from the light, and landing in a pile of valuables and commodities. You start to cry for help, and hear the suddenly more serious beastman shush you.<br />
<br />
“Quiet down. Or do you want to end up as a centaur?”<br />
<br />
“No I don’t –“<br />
<br />
“Cool, then stay quiet.”<br />
<br />
You settle as best you can in this sack. Thanks to your new fragile self, you’ve got plenty of wiggle room. Only having to deal with the occasional bumps into the objects this hyena has stolen. Though they’re all blunt, nothing that would hurt to press against. Was he planning to steal you from the start?<br />
<br />
You do hear movement from out of the bag. The gnoll running, jumping, and rushing to somewhere else. There’s the occasional trotting of centaurs and at one point a horn sounds.<br />
<br />
“They’ve noticed you’re gone. Lucky you’re with me.”<br />
<br />
It’s weird casually talking to someone who has basically kidnapped you. But if he didn’t, you’d be a centaur right now.<br />
<br />
“Thanks. Do I still need to be quiet?”<br />
<br />
“Nah. We’re far enough. Stay in the sack though, you’re pretty mangled from monster exposure.”<br />
<br />
While not hurt or injured, you do feel odd. Caused by the toll of dealing with the Naga, then the centaur. As well as your eagerness to prove yourself leading to failure upon failure. The small bit of muscle you had stolen away as a result of these encounters. You sigh and settle, not sure what staying in the sack will do, but giving this beastman the benefit of the doubt.<br />
<br />
“Names Zak by the way, and consider me a curious little beast. But what’re you doing all the way down here?”<br />
<br />
“I am.... Was an adventurer. Party member turned into a monster, I ran away.”<br />
<br />
“Sorry to hear it! Well, you’re in good hands with me.”<br />
<br />
The sack begins to feel more restrictive as you talk with Zak. More knickknacks bumping into you, your shoulders pressed closer together. Knees brought up closer to your stomach, which starts to show signs of training once more. The barest bits of muscle shown, which was what originally gave you the confidence to start spelunking.<br />
<br />
“So, Zak. You’re not just dragging me away to keep me for yourself... Right?”<br />
<br />
“What? Noooooooo. Of course I wouldn’t do that.”<br />
<br />
He has the same chuckle from earlier, that hyena cackled that ends as soon as it starts. Your hands forming fists as you realise this might just be another trap. You trusted that centaur, and it led you to being his captive. Now if this keeps going, you’re just going to end up another hyena. Resting in here has made you feel stronger, and so you start to use that strength. Thrashing about, trying to open up the tightly sealed bag. Punching at it, using your new muscles.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Easy you don’t need to- was just joking and- hey!”<br />
<br />
As you get bigger, the task gets easier. Your attention brought to the back of the hyena. Giving him a kick and punch, knocking him off his feet and causing him to let go of the sack. Removing that pressure around the rope, and letting you push it open and climb outside. Back into a denser part of the woods, Zak already on his feet again. Though he keeps his distance, hands up in the air.<br />
<br />
“Rude way to treat your rescuer.”<br />
<br />
“Kidnapper.”<br />
<br />
“I can be both! Geeze, talk about ungrateful. After I worked all of those curses out of you and everything. Could’ve at least given me some gold.”<br />
<br />
The annoyed look from Zak seems to be nothing more than an act, as he settles into a impish smirk. His eyes glancing at you, the normal you. No more curvy hips or wide ass. No old hunter in your head. No small dick. Just a slightly muscled adventurer, that needs to get out of here. Though you do feel a little bad beating this guy to get out.<br />
<br />
“Oh. Sorry, didn’t think you were actually-“<br />
<br />
“Trying to help. Yeah that’s fair. Don’t blame you, just doing what I do.”<br />
<br />
He picks up the sack. Gathering up his spoils that broke out with you, and putting them back in place. The hyena settling, giving you the side eye then looking to the path ahead. Tail swaying once, shoulders rolled and foot patting on the ground.<br />
<br />
“So. You don’t know the way out. But, I do. I’m a devious scamp that’s had the run of this place for ages! Hah, ask any monster and they’ll say I’ve stolen from them.”<br />
<br />
He seems genuinely proud of that.<br />
<br />
“Great... So uh. That mean you’re willing to help me get out?”<br />
<br />
“Of course! Just stick by my side, I know the way past monsters and traps. You’ll be safe with me, as long as you can deal with me.”<br />
<br />
He lets out the same laugh as before, and guides you ahead. Making idle conversation as you travel. While he’s cocky, and quite the talker. He seems more interested in you and what you’re doing than bragging about himself. Asking about where you’re from, what it’s like there. Who you’ve met and why you’re travelling. It’s strangely pleasant. You almost forget that this man is a part hyena beast that could turn you into a monster in minutes. <br />
<br />
The glow from the roof starts to fade as the hours pass. This forest seems endless, but Zak swears you’re making progress<br />
<br />
“It dulls at night. So I’ll set up camp.”<br />
<br />
He tells you as the light continues to diminish. The two of you finding a cluster of trees on a higher bit of ground. Almost forming a wall that he sets his sack against. Zak starting to prepare a fire in the middle of this clearing. Gathering leaves and twigs into a pile, then snapping his claws. The black spots of fur turning a bright red, and fire forming from the tip of his finger. Igniting the woodpile, and providing warmth for the both of you. Now would be a good time to learn more about your new companion.</p>
