<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Very slight violence at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I assumed that if Hector is one of the world&#39;s top scientists, he&#39;d have at least one Ph.D.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You step through the portal back into Hector&#39;s old lab. You&#39;re both very curious about what other things he might have tucked away here, as well as looking forward to some time alone. Your head is all a-whirl from the tremendous shifts in your life, and kind of need a break from your minions to process it.<br />
<br />
After taking a moment to ensure that the portal is stable -- easier then casting repeated teleportation spells, and you still have some idea of using this place -- you look around. The lab is as you remember it, with unfamiliar machines and shelves of unknown gadgets; the wrecked car lying amidst a few discarded tools in an engineering bay. You walk over to it idly, your heeled boots clacking on the tiled floor, giving you a satisfying rush of power to know that the leather gripping your shapely legs was...<br />
<br />
&quot;Agh...&quot; You put a gloved hand to your forehead, wincing at a brief twinge of pain. Something seemed out of place for a moment. <i>Who</i> had you summoned, again? That knight, right? Who had killed your mother -- but that didn&#39;t seem right.<br />
<br />
You lean on the frame of the car, trying to sort out your memories. Your mother as the boy Jared was still very much alive, and you felt a momentary pang as you thought of her. But then something quashed that, and you recalled your real mother, slain by those heroes. Though you are not sure how you remember the incident so clearly, as you were only two at the time.<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath. <i>It doesn&#39;t matter now.</i> You wonder, was that in the past? Or in another world altogether? You put another hand to the latex tightly hugging your breasts, and give a tired smirk. &quot;Like it, knight? A lot of men would kill to get to touch my boobs like this. You&#39;re lucky I allow you to serve me like this.&quot; You shiver at how <i>wicked</i> that makes you feel, even as you enjoy the jostling of your breasts.<br />
<br />
You decide it doesn&#39;t really matter where the knight came from. He&#39;s been put in his place. Maybe you&#39;ll try to find out more later. For right now...<br />
<br />
You close your eyes. Your goal is to take over the world, right? You&#39;re not entirely sure why you want to; it feels like some inner voice is insisting on it. <I>Your mother.</i> Right, it&#39;s what she wanted; whether it was this world or another doesn&#39;t really matter, you suppose. Besides, you deserve it. You were born to be a queen; you <i>deserve</i> to rule this pathetic world.<br />
<br />
You straighten with renewed confidence. You run your hands through your hair, using a touch of magic to fix it, before turning to examine the car. You smile wryly at the damage the scientist&#39;s own security did to it. What was so special about this hunk of junk, anyway? -- then you notice the lack of wheels, obviously a design choice. <i>Was this meant to fly?</i> If so, then your girlfriend -- er, guards...<br />
<br />
You feel another wave of confusion, but shake it off determinedly. <i>You</i> had cast the spell that located the smartest scientist in the world. Though it didn&#39;t exactly feel like it. You felt like you&#39;d been running on some kind of autopilot since this amulet had appeared around your neck. Becoming a sorceress had only somewhat alleviated the feeling that the thing was acting of its own accord.<br />
<br />
You tap a long, black nail thoughtfully on the red stone at your throat. &quot;Hm.&quot; Where <i>had</i> this thing come from? Had it been your mother&#39;s? <i>That must be it.</i><br />
<br />
Dismissing such things for now, you strut over to a desk with a computer monitor atop it, along with mouse and keyboard. Waking it from standby, you see detailed schematics for... a hovercar? <i>Well, that confirms that.</i> You close the window, then begin browsing around. However, while you see some interesting things, you don&#39;t know the science involved, and without a clear idea of what you&#39;re looking for you can&#39;t find anything useful.<br />
<br />
Sighing in frustration you leave the computer and make your way to the still-open door. As soon as you step through it, however, a dozen or so wall-mounted and mobile turrets turn to you, and a synthetic voice announces,<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;Unidentified intruder detected. Halt and surrender, or be terminated.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
The message repeats as you sigh in exasperation. There are a lot of them, and a number of sealed doors. Using your magic to dispose of all of them would be tiresome, especially as the amulet&#39;s power was already pretty depleted from the extensive changes it had wrought earlier. Then you recalled something the scientist had said about voice recognition. You smile; a single, simple spell is all it would take.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stand down,&quot; you command, your voice now a perfect imitation of Hector&#39;s bored monotone. To your relief, the turrets fold up, no longer making you a target. Having to individually destroy them while shielding yourself from bullets, lasers and rockets could have seriously cut into your reserves. Now you can make them work for you. All you need to do is find some kind of master control to make them recognise your voice instead of Hector&#39;s.<br />
<br />
You stride down the corridor. The doors are all shut, and unlabeled except for numbers. However the far end is open, beyond it seeming to be an office space. Entering it, you are certain that this is his office. There&#39;s a little break area with a fridge and table, some filing cabinets to store hard back-ups, a door to a bathroom, and most importantly an elaborate computer console built into the wall. At the other end of the room is what appears to be another short hallway leading to blast doors. Seeing them, you realise you haven&#39;t seen any windows; are you in some kind of bunker?<br />
<br />
You are bemused for a moment to realise that your spell found you -- presumably -- the world&#39;s smartest scientist, but not any real details about him. Oh well, that&#39;s why you were here now.<br />
<br />
But, just as you turn to the large terminal, there is a hydraulic hiss. To your surprise, the blast doors begin to slide open, and a young woman steps into the hallway.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Gonzalez?&quot; she asks uncertainly, then gasps when she sees you.<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Beatrice Palmerston had been employed by Hector Gonzalez to act as his liaison to the outside world. The man had big dreams, but to fuel them he needed money. After accruing enough he&#39;d bought and renovated this abandoned public bunker to set up as an independent inventor-for-hire, funneling the profits from R&D jobs for big business into private projects like his hovercar. But he was a scientist, not a businessman, and that is where Beatrice came in.<br />
<br />
A college student majoring in business, about to graduate into an uncertain market with a lot of debt, Beatrice had felt rather lucky to land this job. Dr. Gonzalez might not have been the most affable boss, and he expected a lot of her, but it paid well and was relatively simple. All she had to do was man the front desk and handle the dealings with his clients.<br />
<br />
She had just hung up from talking with her boyfriend when the security alert on her desk began to beep and flash red. She jumped, and stared at it wide-eyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck...?&quot;<br />
<br />
The lab downstairs was virtually soundproofed, so she had been unaware of the little fracas between your guards and Hector&#39;s &#39;bots. But your encounter with the automated security had set off the alarm. And just as soon ended it, leaving Beatrice staring at the suddenly-dead light in confusion.<br />
<br />
<i>False alarm?</i> she wondered, shaken. She swivelled in her chair to look at the door to the stairs down; still locked. Surely there was no way for someone to be down there?<br />
<br />
She wished she could contact the doctor; but there was no intercom system. Hector was that adamant about not being disturbed. There was just an alarm she could trigger from her end if someone tried to break in. But it seemed silly to do that when everything was fine <i>here.<br />
<br />
Still...</i> She decided to check. She opened the drawer with the handgun he&#39;d given her, but decided to pass. She barely remembered how to use it. Besides, if there <i>was</i> a threat down there that his crazy security &#39;bots couldn&#39;t handle, she doubted a little handgun would do much.<br />
<br />
So she just grabbed the keys, and unlocked the door down to the converted bunker. She braced herself. This was probably just a glitch, and Dr. Gonzalez would berate her for disturbing him. But as she descended the plain concrete stairs, she couldn&#39;t help but entertain fantasies of shadow-porting ninjas or dimension-shifting abominations. She always felt a strange mix of wonder and unease on approaching the doctor&#39;s sanctum, feelings which mounted as she pulled the lever to open the sealed doors.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dr. Gonzalez...?&quot;<br />
<br />
~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br />
<br />
Her voice trails off as you turn to her and your eyes meet. She sees a tall, cuvaceous woman whose red eyes and commanding pose make her ensemble of black cape, latex outfit and silver tiara seem regal and menacing.<br />
<br />
You see a young, blue-eyed blonde, pretty but not stunning, dressed in a white business jacket and blouse, and a plain black skirt. Her surprise is quickly turning to fear as she puts a hand to her mouth. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my Go-&quot;<br />
<br />
You raise your own hand, cutting her off as magical force pulls her towards you. She chokes on her own scream as her body flies across the room, your fingers closing on the front of her blouse. You grin down at her limp form -- limp not from shock, but because you&#39;ve taken the precaution of paralysing her apart from vital functions and speech.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have we here?&quot; you ask, your mind beginning to churn with ideas for her.</p>
