<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, to hell with this.&quot; Tyler said, as he undid himself from the sports bra Misha had given to him. As he pulled the bra over his arms, he heard her gasp in surprise because of... something. As he looked over at her, he saw her intently stare at his chest. He looked down, and was met with both lumps which he&#39;d expected to disappear as he pulled off the bra.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are they still there?!&quot; He looked at them in shock, then touched them. The contact of skin to skin confirmed their authenticity. &quot;No way in hell...&quot; he followed as he swiftly moved his hands to the panties he was wearing. He pulled them down, completely removing them from his body. There he stood, completely naked, in Misha&#39;s hallway. Nothing had changed back to anything male. His hair was still long, his chest wasn&#39;t flat, and above all, he still had female genitals. He felt tears well up, only holding them back because he&#39;d be ashamed if he cried in front of a girl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look what you did Misha. A stupid prank turned completely insane, this is impossible!&quot; Tyler exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m seeing it in front of me though.&quot; She snapped back. &quot;Put on the clothes I gave you again, there&#39;s no point in arguing now.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two walked back to the sitting area in the living room. Tyler followed Misha&#39;s instructions, and sat down again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you really are a girl, I still can&#39;t believe it.&quot; Misha admired Tyler with glee, from tip to toe. Tyler just sat there, waiting until she was done, slowly drinking the juice which he&#39;d poured beforehand.<br />
<br />
The washing machine was still spinning, sounding loudly in the background. Tyler was shaking, impatiently waiting until his clothes would be washed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ty,&quot; Misha began, &quot;explain to me precisely what had happened, while you were in the bathroom.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler spoke, &quot;Well, the weird stuff started after dried myself off, having just showered. I was looking around for my clothes, but remembered I&#39;d thrown them out of the bathroom for you to pick up, so you could wash them. Taking a peek outside, I was met with the clothes you handed me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, the clothes you are wearing right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Indeed. As I put on the clothes, one by one, I started to look more feminine, but only in the places on which these clothes were put.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is... the panties were the cause of you getting a pussy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A vagina, yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Quit the formalities, I&#39;ve seen them before, you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t though, I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot; Tyler brought his hands to his head, and looked downwards, to the floor. He was seated with his legs spread, his elbows resting on his legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just like with the bra. First, only your nipples had become female, because you&#39;d put on my vest. Only as you put on the bra, you developed boobs which turned into a B-cup.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that must be it.&quot; Tyler looked up again.<br />
<br />
&quot;So your body adapts with every different clothing you wear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think so?&quot;<br />
<br />
Misha bent to Tyler, giving him a pat on the back. &quot;You&#39;ll be fine, Ty. I think that, once you put on your own clothes, you&#39;ll be completely male again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler let out a breath in relief. That must be it. So he could turn back after all?<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s as if your body takes this saying too literally: the clothes make the man. And vice versa, of course.&quot; Misha said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never had this before though.&quot; Tyler stated.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever tried to put on woman&#39;s clothes before then?&quot;<br />
<br />
A silence fell.<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot; Misha chuckled to that reaction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on Ty,&quot; Misha said it in a way that made Tyler think he had to hold on to something, &quot;I have something else to try. You see, my friends gave me this really awkward present once as a joke, well... you&#39;ll get it once you see it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Misha ran back upstairs again. Tyler re-positioned himself in his chair, so he could see when his friend returned.<br />
<br />
What could it be she was looking for? What kind of &#39;joke&#39; had her friends made, that was so awkward? She was a girl, it could just as well be a giant dildo or something. Talk about a &#39;joke&#39;.<br />
<br />
Misha peeked her head into the living room, trying to hide this &#39;present&#39;. She saw Tyler look at her. &quot;Wait Ty, close your eyes, or move your head to look elsewhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler obeyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Misha continued, Tyler heard hear approaching him. He got a bit nervous. &quot;Now put off your vest and bra again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler laughed nervously. &quot;Say, how many times do you want me to change?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, yeah I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Was the answer he got.<br />
<br />
Tyler unzipped the vest, and disposed of it. He stopped at his tracks.<br />
<br />
&quot;You bra too, silly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler hesitated for a moment, but then continued. Once again, he pulled off the sports bra, and waited for the next instruction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, now lift your arms.&quot;<br />
<br />
He lifted his arms, and noticed Misha was standing right behind him. She brought something in front of him, and he felt it come into contact with his skin on his chest area. A last sound of some clip being closed, and Tyler was allowed to open his eyes again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Tyler looked down at himself. Misha laughed at him maniacally, but once again admiring her work. As Tyler looked down at himself, he was met with the cleavage of a, so to say, very gifted woman. He himself wasn&#39;t happy with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;A G-cup, Ty. That&#39;s what you have right now!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler tried to reach his back, hoping to find the clip of that bra. He was now cursed by his G-cup breasts though, as they were in the every time he made an attempt. All he experienced while trying, was the discomfort of his boobs being squished or being unable to breathe. After a couple times, he gave up, panting.<br />
<br />
Misha had seen the whole show with amusement, but helped Tyler out in the end. As he was bent over to try and catch some breath, she unclipped the bra for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks...&quot; Tyler groaned.<br />
<br />
Now his breasts were in full display again, sticking out further than ever before. He felt how his balance was altered drastically, and his center of gravity moved to somewhere else, thanks to the weight of these two... melons.<br />
<br />
Not wasting any more time, he picked up the sports bra again, in hopes of reducing the size. It still wasn&#39;t confirmed it would work, so Misha also fell silent for a bit. She realized what she&#39;d done, and how badly it would turn out if it didn&#39;t change back anymore.<br />
<br />
Tyler brought the bra down to his collarbone and neck, and then grabbed the underside, stretching it out, so it would go over his G-cup breasts. Magic did its work however, as both saw how the sports bra could fit over it, without any pain or discomfort. Once again, the clothing hugged his body. Tyler hadn&#39;t looked away from it yet, and saw how not his boobs got to a B-cup again, but instead, the bra had expanded. He brought his eyes over to Misha, worried. She seemed relieved however.<br />
<br />
&quot;The bra has changed to fit my breasts Misha...&quot; He stated. Misha looked at him confused. &quot;No they have not! They&#39;re a natural size again!&quot; Tyler looked down again. And indeed, there they were, a &#39;measly&#39; B-cup. &quot;Oh, that is weird.&quot; So as long as he didn&#39;t look away, the size of the breasts would stay the same, or better yet, the shape of his body underneath the clothes would stay the same. It was only if he turned away and then back again, that they&#39;d fit normal shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is good to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Another half an hour had passed, and the washing machine was finally finished with washing Tyler&#39;s clothes. Misha was now blow-drying them, so that Tyler could wear them sooner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Misha started, &quot;your clothes are dry. Let&#39;s test my theory, to see if you can in fact turn back into a boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler gulped, it&#39;d have to work. Otherwise, how could he explain this to his parents? He unzipped the vest and removed the bra. Then he put on his own shirt, the one he&#39;d bought when he was male, the shirt, usually worn by men.<br />
<br />
He looked down to check, and the sight confirmed it, his upper body was male again. Misha looked at him with a big smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Mi-&quot; He cut himself off quickly, surprised by the sudden lowering of his voice. That was definitely male! Misha celebrated in amazement with a cry, clapping her hands. &quot;You can turn back!&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
Once again, relief washed over him. &quot;Thank you, Misha.&quot; He said, silently.<br />
<br />
&quot;What was that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I couldn&#39;t hear you.&quot; Tyler looked at his friend in front of him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you serious Misha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dead serious.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I said thank y-&quot; The sound of a door opening interrupted Tyler as he spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon!&quot; He could hear someone say from the hallway.<br />
<br />
Misha&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Oh crap, that&#39;s mom. Quick change your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler didn&#39;t let that slip, as he jumped into action. He put off the leggings, and wanted to remove his panties too, but Misha stopped him. &quot;No time for that, I haven&#39;t dried your boxers yet.&quot; Misha, had grabbed Tyler&#39;s bag, and threw in the jogging pants and vest Tyler had worn, as well as his own shorts.<br />
<br />
Well shit. Tyler groaned, as he quickly put on his pants. He was just finished buckling his belt, as Misha&#39;s mother entered the living room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi mom!&quot; Misha began, as if everything was as usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi darling.&quot; Her mom looked over at Tyler. &quot;Hey Tyler! That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen you here. Misha informed me about it. I understand you don&#39;t want to arrive home soaking wet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyways, Misha, I&#39;m going to start dinner soon, is he dining with us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Oh, no. He was about to leave. Here Ty, your bag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Misha approached him, giving him a wink as she gave him a quick glance inside his bag. Her clothes were indeed in there. Misha looked behind her, seeing her mother trying to hang her coat on a clothes hanger. Misha quickly whispered something in Tyler&#39;s ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep the spare clothes in your bag. I don&#39;t think we have enough time to hide them anymore. My mother sees almost everything.&quot; She zipped the bag closed, and then headed to the hallway to bring him his own jacket.<br />
<br />
Misha now started talking in a normal tone. &quot;Your coat is still wet, but at least the weather&#39;s dry again. I think it&#39;s warm enough to go outside without wearing it. It&#39;s still wet, you see.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s obvious. You can&#39;t was that, but thanks anyway, for the advise as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler opened his bag again, stuffing his jacket in it. It immediately made a good hiding spot for the clothes underneath, as they were now completely out of sight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then,&quot; Misha&#39;s mother said, &quot;off you go!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler stepped out of the house, and waved both women goodbye. After a moment of walking, the door closed behind him. He stood still for a moment, and breathed out, slowly. *sigh*, what an experience...<br />
<br />
Tyler walked on, following the sidewalk. He felt something odd in his groin. He continued walking as he realized. He hadn&#39;t managed to put on his own shorts yet. Right now he was still walking around with Misha&#39;s panties! He still had a pussy!<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax for now Ty,&quot; he said to himself, to calm down, &quot;homes is only a couple of blocks away, we&#39;ll see it then.&quot;</p>
