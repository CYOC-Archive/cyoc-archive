<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle pushed Jeff onto the couch and worked the boxers down.  He <br />
placed the iPhone back on Jeff's crotch and it stuck there.  A <br />
feeling of completeness ran through Jeff causing him to sigh.  Kyle <br />
pulled the boxers back up and closed his eyes for a moment.<br />
<br />
Kyle opened his eyes and pulled down the boxers. There attached to <br />
Jeff's crotch was a slice of strawberry birthday cake with white <br />
frosting and a cock shaped candle on it sitting on a plate with a <br />
fork. Jeff looked down at his cock's new form and started to freak <br />
out. &quot;Oh my god, you're gonna eat me! No way!&quot; Jeff hurriedly pulled <br />
the boxers up as well as he could, some of the icing pulled off by <br />
the waistband of the boxers, causing Jeff to cringe at the unusual <br />
sensation.<br />
<br />
Jeff took off running into the kitchen to get away from Kyle, with <br />
Kyle calling after him &quot;Don't worry, it will come back!&quot; Jeff kept <br />
running as Kyle gave chase. Jeff the made the mistake of running into <br />
the bedroom. Kyle advanced slowly on Jeff, who was cornered in the <br />
bedroom. Kyle knelt down and grabbed Jeff around the waist and licked <br />
some of the icing off the front of the boxers. Jeff softly moaned at <br />
the pleasant sensation, though he was slightly disturbed by the <br />
sensation of the frosting dissolving in Kyle's mouth. Kyle sat back <br />
on his heels and told Jeff &quot;Pull them down yourself.&quot; Jeff, on the <br />
verge of tears, slowly pulled the boxers down exposing the cake on <br />
the plate. Kyle pulled the boxers down the rest of the way, and <br />
grabbed hold of the plate and gently pulled it off. &quot;Since it is my <br />
birthday, we should light the candle&quot; Kyle said as he opened the desk <br />
drawer and pulled out the lighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Jeff cried, and tried to stop Kyle, but tripped because of the <br />
boxers around his ankles, falling face-first to the floor. Kyle lit <br />
the candle, and Jeff felt a heat on the head of his cock. The <br />
sensation wasn't painful, in fact it was turning Jeff on. As the <br />
candle slowly melted the pleasure grew and grew within Jeff. Jeff was <br />
so focused on the pleasure radiating from the melting candle, he <br />
didn't notice that Kyle was singing happy birthday to himself. When <br />
the song finished Kyle blew out the candle, causing Jeff to have an <br />
orgasm.<br />
<br />
Jeff thrashed on the floor some as Kyle looked down with a grin on <br />
his face. &quot;See, I told you this would be fun.&quot; Kyle pulled the candle <br />
out of the cake and took the icing covered end into his mouth and <br />
sucked on it making Jeff moan, and his hips buck. &quot;But the fun has <br />
just started.&quot; Kyle set the candle on the plate as he picked up the <br />
fork and cut off a bite of cake. As Kyle took the first bite into his <br />
mouth Jeff moaned. He could feel Kyle chewing on his cock, but the <br />
sensation was immensely pleasurable, even as his cock was swallowed <br />
and digested. &quot;Baby, would you like a taste, its very good&quot; Kyle said <br />
holding out the fork with another bite of the cake. Jeff leaned <br />
forward and took the bite into his mouth. The feeling of pleasure <br />
growing as both of them were eating some of the cake.<br />
<br />
The sensations were keeping Jeff right on the edge of cumming, but it <br />
just wasn't letting him find that release. Finally unable to take it <br />
anymore, Jeff tackled Kyle to the bed. Taking the piece of cake Kyle <br />
was about to eat into his mouth, Jeff began to french kiss Kyle, <br />
swapping bit of the cake back and forth. Jeff started to rub Kyle's <br />
cock through his shorts, feeling a little jealous of Kyle's cock. <br />
Though he missed his cock, Jeff was excited about its new form, it <br />
was so new, so different, so good.<br />
<br />
Taking a bigger bite of cake into his mouth, Jeff pulled down Kyle's <br />
shorts and started to suck on Kyle's cock. Jeff felt the sensations <br />
of the blowjob as he sucked on Kyle's now cake covered cock. After a <br />
couple minutes Kyle pulled Jeff off his cock, and pushed him on his <br />
back on the bed.<br />
<br />
Taking most of the remaining cake in his hand, Kyle smears the cake <br />
onto Jeff's asshole and begins to lick it off. Jeff moaned at the <br />
sensation of having his ass eaten out at the same time as his cake <br />
cock eaten. &quot;Ohhh, fuuuck mee!&quot; cried Jeff, thrashing in pleasure <br />
from Kyle's ministrations.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, not a bad idea&quot; Kyle said, sitting up right. Kyle grabs what is <br />
left of the cake and smears some on his cock and the rest onto Jeff's <br />
asshole. Jeff moans again, his hole twitching in anticipation. Using <br />
the cake as lube, Kyle slowly pushes his dick into Jeff's ass. Jeff <br />
moans at the pleasure, feeling as though he is being double fucked, <br />
while fucking someone.<br />
<br />
Kyle starts to fuck Jeff fast and hard, the two of them moaning <br />
loudly. &quot;Oh baby, I'm getting close&quot; Kyle shouted as he ruthlessly <br />
pounded Jeff's ass. Jeff was lost in a world of pleasure, in a way <br />
grateful that he couldn't cum, because he would have exploded by now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea baby, fill me with your cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Aaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!&quot; Kyle cried as he shot his load into Jeff's ass. <br />
Jeff moaned as he felt Kyle's cum flow into his ass, mix with and <br />
dissolve the remaining cake. Kyle collapsed on top of Kyle, <br />
exhausted. Kyle tipped over to one side, spooning Jeff, his softening <br />
cock still lodged in Jeff's ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh man, that was intense. You can eat me anytime you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry, we'll definitely do this again.&quot; Kyle and Jeff slowly <br />
drifted off in a satisfied state of bliss.</p>
