<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">{{Considering I already used the most obvious title choice &#9835;Afternoon Delight&#9835; for a previous episode, I had to come up with another option for this one.—tmw.}}<br />
<br />
The two young lovers held each other close, human flesh and were-mer scales pressed tightly, as they basked in the afterglow of their recent love making session.<br />
Eric Anderson and Julie Stovall were sharing romantic kisses together even as he caressed her soft cheek and stared deeply into his fiance&#39;s eyes.<br />
The fact that his were-mermanhood was still hard and buried well with her tight love grotto wasn&#39;t lost on the two of them either.<br />
&quot;Julie...&quot; began Eric, even as they felt their respective flippers brush against their mates.<br />
&quot;I know, dearest,&quot; she replied, staring at her one true love. &quot;But we still have to get dressed and back downstairs to tackle our homework, let alone see if there&#39;s any time to try to squeeze in another dance lesson before you have to walk me home for the night,&quot; Julie pointed out.<br />
Eric&#39;s only reaction was to sigh as he laid his head upon her chest. A moment later, he looked back up at her and said, &quot;I can hear your heart beating!&quot;<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure you can. A were&#39;s hearing can be really sensitive, depending upon the species and what they&#39;re listening to,&quot; she explained. &quot;I&#39;m also sure that if we could listen to each other&#39;s simultaneously, we&#39;d discover that my heart is beating in time with yours and vice versa,&quot; added Julie, before kissing Eric on the forehead.<br />
&quot;You are the best thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. I am so happy you took the time to get to know me, let alone have our friendship develop into love naturally.&quot;<br />
&quot;The only thing better than today with you is tomorrow with you Eric,&quot; replied Julie, before giving him another romantic kiss on the lips.<br />
&quot;I know my Jewel,&quot; he said, kissing her again.<br />
When their lips finally parted, Julie said, &quot;Two things. First, I have to come up with an appropriate term of endearment for you in time, like you keep calling me your Jewel.&quot;<br />
&quot;Because of the unique deep sea blue coloring of your eyes. I think that physically, that feature attracted me to you first.&quot;<br />
&quot;That is so sweet,&quot; she said, briefly hugging him tighter. &quot;But secondly, we really do need to get up and dressed and downstairs to our homework now.&quot;<br />
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; teased Eric, briefly moving his hips to indicate the current status of their interlocking parts.<br />
Julie moaned in pure delight well after Eric grew still again. With him still laying on top, she turned her head to peek at the digital clock on his nightstand. &quot;Well, we <i>might</i> still have time for an encore...&quot; she said with a smile, before starting to thrust her own hips against his.<br />
The two young lovers locked lips in a more passionate kiss as their intimacy resumed.<br />
<br />
MEANWHILE...<br />
Across town, another pair of lovers were having non stop fun themselves.<br />
As soon as she closed and locked her apartment door, Coach Katherine &quot;Kat&quot; Johnson literally pounced upon her guest Martha Anderson, fervently kissing her lover even as she began hastily taking Martha&#39;s clothes off.<br />
Not to be outdone, Martha started returning the favor.<br />
Soon, two naked women were rubbing their cunts against the other&#39;s leg, even as both let loose their respective fursonas.<br />
Martha the bi-werecat and Kat the lesbian weretigress rolled down on the floor in each other&#39;s arms as they switched positions and started drinking deeply from each other&#39;s furry chalices, neither asking or giving quarter as both ladies moaned in pleasure between licks until long after each had given the other multiple orgasms.<br />
Now, having finally made it to the bedroom and Kat&#39;s King sized bed, the two laid together after yet another frantic round of sex. If either of them noticed the lack of romantic intimacy (like when Martha cuddled with her husband William after sex) neither of them commented upon it.<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; said Martha, staring at the weretigress. &quot;Like most women, I find having my breasts loved erotic and stimulating, but you&#39;re the first female I&#39;ve ever met who actually has an orgasm just from having her tits suckled.&quot;<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; asked Kat with a smile on her muzzle, while tenderly running a paw along Martha&#39;s furry body. &quot;There a lot I know that I would love to show you.&quot;<br />
&quot;And I would love to learn it all too, but I&#39;m afraid we don&#39;t have much time left this afternoon,&quot; commented the werecat, after glancing at the clock on the bedroom wall.<br />
&quot;Do we have time for another round before you have to leave?&quot; wondered Kat, moving closer to hold her lover of the moment.<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, no,&quot; admitted Martha, as she got up and stretched her furry body the way some natural cats do. &quot;Not if you want to help me clean up before I have to leave,&quot; she added with a smile, before swaying her hips and swishing her tail seductively as Martha walked to the bathroom to take a shower.<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll take what I can get,&quot; replied Kat, as she got up to follow the werecat, <i>but what I really want is you,</i> silently added the weretigress.<br />
<br />
ELSEWHERE...<br />
&quot;So, I know it&#39;s short notice and you&#39;ll need to check with your family, but the next few days are the only vacation time we could get from our respective jobs,&quot; explained Mrs. Ramsey, while providing a snack to her son Alex and his lover Nate Anderson.<br />
The three of them were sitting around the Ramsey family&#39;s kitchen table as she added, &quot;We would just need you to keep an eye on Alex and help keep him out of trouble while we&#39;re gone. No wild parties or anything.&quot;<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; answered Nate, although he couldn&#39;t help thinking about the unrestricted access to his boyfriend that would grant him. <i>After all, it&#39;s not like either of us could ever get pregnant.</i><br />
&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be right to take Alex out of school for a few days just because his father and I want some time alone to ourselves,&quot; added Mrs. Ramsey.<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s all it is? Just some time to be adults?&quot; wondered Alex.<br />
&quot;Yes son. It&#39;s not like our marriage is on the rocks and this is a last ditch effort to work everything out. After all, you know how happy we are,&quot; replied his mother, staring at him to relieve his concerns. &quot;But, depending upon how receptive your father is to the idea, I <i>might</i> be coming home with your new baby brother or sister underway.&quot;<br />
&quot;REALLY?&quot; asked Alex in disbelief.<br />
&quot;You sound surprised,&quot; his mother said in return. &quot;Don&#39;t be. You&#39;re parents aren&#39;t even 50 yet, so nowhere near the proverbial prime of life or even the dreaded over the hill for a were. Besides, you graduate at the end of the next school year and go on to college after that. Your dad&#39;s been talking about converting the unfinished basement into your own private bachelor pad, which would free up your old room to be a new nursery if we do decide to bring another cub into the world now.&quot;<br />
Alex and Nate gave each other a brief glance. Having their own &quot;residence&quot; in the basement was part of the dreams they shared about living together and getting married after they graduated high school, which still seemed kind of far off at the moment considering they were both only Juniors.<br />
&quot;Like you said, I&#39;ll still have to ask my folks, but I&#39;ll help keep an eye on Alex,&quot; promised Nate.<br />
&quot;Good. I already know for a fact that you&#39;ve won his heart,&quot; revealed Mrs. Ramsey, a statement which made both teenagers start to blush, &quot;so his father and I won&#39;t mind if the two of you have some... cohabitation while we&#39;re gone,&quot; to which both boys started smiling, &quot;but we still expect to come back to find both the house and our son in one piece.&quot;<br />
Nate promised they would while Alex jumped up and hugged his mother. &quot;You&#39;re the greatest,&quot; he whispered in her ear.<br />
&quot;So are you dear,&quot; she whispered in return, while returning the hug.</p>
