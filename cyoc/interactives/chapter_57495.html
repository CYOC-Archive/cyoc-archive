<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gillie knew there was one way to end the lion madness, and that was find someone with a <br />
turn of the game, convince them either to use it as Gillie instructed, or have them <br />
harmlessly use it or her or use it to change her 'back' and then have Gillie use a carefully <br />
worded turn to stem the tide. <br />
<br />
Gillie nearly fell over as she was hit by a dizzy spell as her gut instinct screamed that <br />
would be a '-BAD IDEA-'. Everything warning her and telling her that course of action <br />
would cause more harm than good. <br />
<br />
Gillie couldn't know, but such an attempted flip flop of reality mighty very much cause <br />
existence to throw up it's hands in frustration and simply dispose of everyone related to <br />
the recent use of the game in fell stroke like a scythe upon wheat stalks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay Gill?&quot; Serenity asked concerned helping her nine foot tall companion stand <br />
as they walked into her house before the two parted. <br />
<br />
&quot;... I will be...&quot; <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
The siblings, Terri and Sandi walked out of the medical wing and ultimately through the <br />
entriy way with Eri. The metallic Hokkaido Lupman looked at the five entry way statues and <br />
politely bowed her head at them. <br />
<br />
Seeing this Terri (who was blue green) and Sandi (who was teal) looked at each other. Terri <br />
spoke first, &quot;You know Eri.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Terri-Kappa?&quot; Eri said, using Terri's letter as her suffix. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kappa Sandi and I have been thinking... we appreciate how beautiful the statues are, they <br />
really are a work of art. But the vast majority of the pack isn't Shinto. If Anne-Theta is <br />
trying to have the pack to build a mini-chapel to balance out Amy's small shrine: it might <br />
be a better idea to have the statues dismantled and reassembled in or around Amy's <br />
shrine. Otherwise it seems like the pack is something it's not. I know you're part of that <br />
religion Eri-Mu, that faith, but it's not fair to the rest of us who aren't.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If the vast majority of the pack was Shinto, and it was a depiction of your god who took <br />
up the entry way... would you accept if I asked you to move it to prevent a 'false image' <br />
from being projected onto the pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Terri said, &quot;I honestly don't know, I suppose I would have to be your paws to know for <br />
sure. Also, all that aside, they are more expensive and grander than the little statues in <br />
Amy's shrine. Wouldn't it be logical to have them there therefore instead of here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eri said nothing for a few moment, the metallic gold she wolf looking rather like a statue <br />
herself before saying, &quot;Once everyone is healed I suppose.&quot; <br />
<br />
The siblings only nodded at that. <br />
<br />
Ulysses meanwhile sometime later didn't care if what he was doing was crazy. It just felt -<br />
right-. Late in the evening, he laid down at the foot of the wolf headed goddess of festival <br />
and slept the night in her presence. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... the letter was me thank your son and... I had no idea he was lost and presumed <br />
dead...&quot; Katy politely explained to the non-felman on the phone. <br />
<br />
&quot;I know. But I'm just glade to know my son was a hero even when he was in fear for his <br />
life.&quot; Said the mother of Trevor apparently. <br />
<br />
&quot;It was him who saved me, I owe him... I... I'm the one who wanted to just thank him for <br />
that and ... please tell me more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marie Tyson laid it all down, the child killer, the supposed suicide of a child, Madam <br />
Serenity, the chaos of the game, (which shocked Katy to her core to learn that Trevor, a <br />
cub, had taken part in a battle to save the world!!!). <br />
<br />
&quot;I... that is... your son really is a little hero..&quot; Katy said, &quot;You... really should be proud of <br />
him...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am. I am... Oh! Excuse me! Our Pride's Matriarch game arrived, it was a pleasure to speak <br />
to you dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And.... you too.&quot;<br />
<br />
They hung up. <br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Trevor as told Mother Glen was in the house, and Trevor the innocent child he was <br />
immediately came not having seen he in what felt like forever... and then he was pinned to <br />
the floor for five minutes as Mother Glen nuzzled and licked his face in the Leoman <br />
equivalent of kissing him silly.  And Trevor was as helpless as a mouse under the giant <br />
lioness. <br />
<br />
Jacob and Marie smiled. Sabrina giggled until her sides hurt. <br />
<br />

<br />
1689 August <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz then said, &quot;I call my first witness, the child Joella.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT?&quot; Everyone in past and present said. <br />
<br />
Marie-Eliza said, &quot;This was before it was even considered possible that children could lie, <br />
or conjure things, or at least, for the puritans at least... there was no debate in her being <br />
able take the stand.&quot; <br />
<br />
For all intents and purpose CRAWLING along floors so as not to damage himself or his <br />
surroundings further, Vatican helpfully pushed the jewish girl into the make shift court <br />
room. This looked at all of this in pain, pity and horror. <br />
<br />
Kathrine silently looked at Marie not believing this, 'Marie... how could you?' <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz simply led Joella to the witness chair, Joella accept her hand, but Marie felt her <br />
shiver at the touch. <br />
<br />
<br />
She then stood before her as she held a Bible in front of her, &quot;Do you swear to tell the <br />
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?&quot;<br />
<br />
Joella looked at the book, not sure if it applied to her or not, the witches having known <br />
none of Joella's faith, and thus this Joella didn't know the previous Joella's faith or her own, <br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; She finally said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Joella, how would you describe your guardians?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My mothers are-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Joella!&quot; Gaal declared, &quot;We told you not to call us-&quot;<br />
<br />
THe hammer came down, &quot;You shall not interrupt the witness!&quot; <br />
<br />
The witch was silent. <br />
<br />
&quot;My... protecters are ... they care about me. Our family. Everyone and everything. They give <br />
out candy to children-&quot; <br />
<br />
Marie's Cruz proved she was more than a match for a Leoman cub with fangs and claws as <br />
she quickly put a lid on Mal'Akh before she could even interrupt Joella. <br />
<br />
&quot;-they took in the other children who were struck by the wandering demons. They took <br />
me in. They took care of me, they looked after me, I wanted for nothing ever-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OBJECTION!&quot; Linus snapped, &quot;This girl is nothing more than another of the witches <br />
puppets! Anything she says she clearly is merely parroting what her masters manufactured <br />
her to say!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If Joella was nothing more than a puppet, she'd be on the ground lifeless right now with <br />
her strings cut sine the witches power is not severed from their protectors, slaves, and <br />
victims.&quot;<br />
<br />
The good doctor said, &quot;Objection overruled. The witness may continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;.... They've wanted everyone to be happy. They made Glendale beautiful. They provided it <br />
with protectors with the boxing trees. They reunited the fairies families.  They were even <br />
going to use their magic so the whole world would want for nothing and so people <br />
wouldn't have to fight over things. But I guess people with money wouldn't like that would <br />
they?&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;The witness shall refrain from conjecture...&quot;<br />
<br />
Joella continued speaking, &quot;They were even willing to take in Aimiliona after her mad dog <br />
murdered Solome in cold blood.&quot; <br />
<br />
JOSHUA WAS NOT MAD!&quot; Mal'Akh roared.<br />
<br />
&quot;SILENCE IN THE COURT!&quot; Mal'Akh was cowed just from one look at Dr. Azrael swearing she <br />
had seen this man before. <br />
<br />
Marie Cruz sighed, &quot;So Joella, would you describe your guardians as evil?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No never. Their only goal is to make everyone else happy. How can that be evil?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Have they ever done anything you felt uncomfortable with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Once...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A ... bunch of bad men came to our house... a bunch of humans and two lupmans... all <br />
with guns...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Part of the Glendale pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I think they were lone wolves. I didn't recognize any of the men from being from <br />
Glendale or the praying town.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... They said how the witches were evil, and how I was their familiar along with everyone <br />
else there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you their familiar?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Continue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The bad men with guns, yes they all had guns, said they had to kill the witches, because <br />
witches were bad, and that they had to kill me, Aimiliona, the Witch Pride, Smamantha and <br />
her whole family, and then everyone in Glendale just to make sure the witches were really <br />
really gone... Then they shot at me... but Gita protected me... and the ball just fell to the <br />
ground... I'd never seen her so angry... and then and there she turned them all into <br />
children, a lot of them into girls too. And made then forget they had ever been bad men <br />
who wanted to hurt people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And would you say this was wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I don't know... Lark, Rosalie, Jimmy, they all seem so much HAPPIER than they were <br />
before... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have you ever told them who they were before?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... after Mal'Akh said some awful things to Lark after Lark said they could be sisters then <br />
Aimiliona could be both their sister, Mal'Akh told her she wasn't a person... Lark was <br />
scared, she thought she was a bird who was made a person and that was why she couldn't <br />
remember before being with the witches... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you didn't tell her the truth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't want to hurt her more.... she's alive, she has a heart all her own, she has dreams <br />
and fears. I don't want to live in a world where she and the rest of my family doesn't <br />
exist... but I know that a bunch of people are gone now forever...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;After they tried to kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And do you think that was right for them to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you consider that one incident to be the one time where you've wondered about <br />
weather your guardians did the right thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I love Lark and the others. I wouldn't want to be without them. Both I know my <br />
moth-, my guardians could have dealt with them lots of other ways.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do you think they didn't?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they were angry, and wanted to protect me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would they?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they love me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you say your mothers WANT to change the world Joella?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they feel the world is unfair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think it's unfair?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. They want it to be fair because they want it to be fair for me, and all of our family... &quot;</p>
