<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Marcus threw the dice for a fourth time. Somehow he was still flexible enough to perform any action necessary. He rolled a 3, which left him on a pink space. He took the card and read it aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad, no changes for you! But you can choose the player that rolls the dice next!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus grunted for a short second, but figured this was enough... for now at least. He looked around the room and suggested that Josh should have the next turn, hoping he would get unlucky since it would be hilarious.<br />
<br />
Without further ado, Josh rolled the dice, got a 10 and landed on a purple spot. The card read:<br />
<br />
&quot;Copy the body of any of the players participating. That same person has the next turn. You are free to choose who!&quot;<br />
<br />
With no second thoughts needed, he immediately picked Marcus. Finally, he was the one to be lucky!<br />
<br />
His body underwent the same treatment that Marcus has been getting for the last few rounds, only much stronger since all of this is happening at the same time. Within two minutes, he copied every part of his body expect the person itself and its face. He now also was incredibly muscular, hyper strong with extremely dense muscles, 7 feet tall and sported a large dick. He flexed as hard as he could, engulfing himself in muscles too strong for this world. He was so excited that she accidentally hit the floor with his fist, causing all his friends to be heaved up by the sudden earthquake. Everyone except Marcus, the other titan. Josh was agape as he saw the inprint of his fist in the floor, surrounded by a small crater.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops!&quot; he said jokingly.<br />
<br />
Now it was back to Marcus to roll the dice, and so he did. With a roll of 5, he landed on a green spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steal all the changes made to a player! Additionaly, it will be your turn next round!&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus looked around. Of course, he didn&#39;t want to inherit the changes made to Kenneth and Allison. And since Lisa wasn&#39;t changed yet and Josh was a titan just like him... he of course chose Josh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you kidding me? Just when I got a good change, Marcus gets ANOTHER one, but even better? This game is rigged!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sadly for Josh, it wasn&#39;t. But it sure was Marcus&#39; lucky day.<br />
<br />
As Josh&#39;s muscles, height and crotch were all shrinking, dwinfling in size, Marcus prepared for the huge growth inbound. He saw his gigantic arms reach new heights as the internal power rose, all the while it was densening his already inpenetratable muscles. Half a ton of weight changed to a ton of weight, the strength to lift a 3,000,000 pounds object rose by a third, while more changes were happening just as quickly.<br />
<br />
As everything finally stopped growing, a new and improved ultra titan greeted the weaklings he called friends.<br />
<br />
He was 8 feet tall since Josh was a little smaller than he was. His penis lenghtened to 18 inches, also thanks to Josh. His mountain-range of muscles expanded to whole states. His flexed bicep rose far, far above his head, almost reaching the ceiling if he were to stand up. The sound it made was deafening and proved his unmatched superiority. His legs were each bigger than large fridges while his pecs were as big as a wardrobe themselves. His 12 abs were sticking out like steel beams, only much, much harder and denser. Seemingly endless rows of obliques spread across his waist. And as if that wasn&#39;t enough, he had the unreasonalbe strength to like nearly 6,000,000 pounds. Just the idea of him casually lifting 1 or 2 million pounds as if it was a six-pack of soda bottles was frightening.<br />
<br />
Marcus was literally glistening with power. No living being on earth should have ever possessed the amount of power that he now has at his disposal. If he wanted, he could take over the world. While he surely couldn&#39;t lift everything on earth, he was basically invulnerable to any sorts of damage. His muscles were way too hard to allow that. Actually, be could most likely take a swin in lava or take a rocket to his chest as if it was a ball of paper.<br />
<br />
&quot;This feels gooood!&quot; he exclaimed with a voice so deep, manly and strong that it made Josh and Kenneth fear him and Allison and Jill cum in that second.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, a ringing noise and a flying rainbow card was in the middle of the playing field.<br />
<br />
&quot;Special Tile: Create your own partner! You can choose from any media and then adapt her mind and body as you like! Much fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, this sounds interesting.&quot; Marcus exclaimed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah... interesting for you. So, who are you gonna choose, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think I know already...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My girlfriend is Powergirl. She will be very strong like me, but always weaker than me. She is completely and utterly devoted to me and would never do something to hurt me, only please me. She has gigantic boobs, as big as beachballs, is 7&#39;4&quot; tall and has a huge, tight ass. Her waist is tiny and absolutely cobbled with impossbily dense muscles, just like the rest of her body. It is toned to perfection and feminine. She is ten times more beautiful than in any comic-iteration. Lastly, whenever she kisses me, I grow taller, more hung and much, much stronger, denser and bigger muscles.&quot;</p>
