<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was indeed likely and in fact could only be the game that had altered Jack and Marcine <br />
into the dear they now were that their horn growth and ability to bear fawns was out of <br />
sync of natural dear. Their biological clocks would likely work themselves out once the <br />
year had come full circle, it was the fundamental nature of animals to adapt to to their <br />
environment. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's wonderful dear...&quot; Marcine moaned out in words only another deer could comprehend <br />
(as much as their ignorant and instinct driven brains could). <br />
<br />
&quot;And you are a wonderful deer.&quot; Jack whispered, the buck pushing into his doe deeper and <br />
deeper, it hurting ever so slightly as he did so, but at the same time were shock waves of <br />
pleasure ran through Marcine, some distant part of her glade that they had moved out of <br />
sight of the wolves before they had begun the future of their herd. Hadn't they? Things felt <br />
fuzzy as the pair thought about it. <br />
<br />
Jack and Marcine thought about the last twenty-four hours, they had been happily <br />
watching a... something... sleeping in a .. something the night before last... and had been <br />
given something for diseases by... someone a couple months ago... and there were... <br />
someone who make sure they weren't hurt in their sleep or had their... something or other <br />
taken from them. 'Well, I guess they weren't important if we can't remember them.' Jack <br />
thought. <br />
<br />
Jack tried to remember if anyone would miss them now that they were dear, but as he tried <br />
to remember they all became faceless blank ghosts who meant nothing to him.  'I guess <br />
we aren't really leaving anyone behind then are we?' <br />
<br />
What came through crystal clear however was traffic jams, taxes, tele-marketers, bad <br />
sitcoms, muggings... 'And we'll never have to deal with any of those things again ever...' <br />
Marcine thought as waves of relief joined the waves of pleasure. She was GLADE she got to <br />
leave humanity and human civilization behind... what had any of those done for either her <br />
or Jack... yes... this was better... so much better... Jack released inside her as she released <br />
as well. <br />
<br />
'Yes...' Jack thought, 'Marcine, my doe, and the herd we'll gather, and the fawns who will <br />
survive and carry on.. they're all we need... all we ever needed.. yes.' <br />
<br />
Their minds swam in a sea of bliss. <br />
<br />
&quot;What should we name our first fawns dear?&quot; Marcine asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jack and Marcine Jr of course...&quot; Jack said, &quot;We're starting a line after all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right.. of course... my buck...they'll carry on when we're gone, then the next Jack <br />
and Marcine will do the same... &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;And on and on and on...&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Who knew lizards could jump that high ...&quot; Kevin said looking at Animal Planet's current <br />
documentary on life in the desert. <br />
<br />
Marcy added, &quot;Or that they really could be rainbow colored without mom's help.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What fabulous creatures they are.&quot; Alice said looking at them, &quot;And the dragon files they <br />
are eating are so colorful as well, do you think that is how they become so colorful <br />
themselves?&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcy and Kevin looked at each other, it made sense. And Alice was technically older then <br />
they were now, and what she said often made so much sense... &quot;You really think so?&quot; Kevin <br />
asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you cut celery and put it in red water, it's veins will turn red yes? Then why cold not <br />
lizards do the same?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just because someone say something that makes sense does not make it true.&quot; Martha <br />
heads said shadowing over the glass wolf child. <br />
<br />
Alice looked at Martha curiously, no fear or worry in those eyes, only a pure innocent <br />
desire to simply know what she did not. &quot;Does that mean what doesn't make sense isn't <br />
necessary untrue?&quot; <br />
<br />
All six of Martha's eyes blinked, she hadn't really expected that question. <br />
&quot;I.. I suppose...&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice went off on her own question and answers, &quot;But would not that also be like saying 'I <br />
eat what I see' and 'I see what I eat' are the same? Or 'What I say I mean' is the same as <br />
'What I mean I say?' ... No... that does not sound right...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kevin and Marcy's heads were soon spinning while Martha's just look upon the glass wolf <br />
cub as she went into a massive though experiment involving semantics and the <br />
fundamentals of logic. <br />
<br />
Anne herself as she wondered weather they should bother cleaning the windows or not (or <br />
let them go dirty so as to deter prying eyes), was caught up in Alice's voice and words and <br />
stopped what she was doing and simply gazed transfixed by the little glass she wolf. <br />
<br />
By the time Alice was causally mentioning how biologically impossible her own existence <br />
was one thought went through Martha's brain.  'Alice is going to sooner or later need some <br />
girls her own age that speak her 'language.' '<br />
<br />
Martha wondered for a moment what had really set Alice off, but remembered how the <br />
absurdity of Alice's situation in Wonderland had always caused Alice to rebuke it's very <br />
existence when it reached a boiling point: to which she'd awaken back in the real world. <br />
<br />
Finally Martha came behind Alice, and hugged the living mass of glass with all for of her <br />
arms, her muzzles flanking Alice's head, &quot;Alice... I am here... I am real.. I am alive... you're <br />
here, you're real, you're alive...  I don't know if this is a dream of the Red King or not... but <br />
I was remade to look after you and the other pups, and I promise I will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alice stopped her tirade as it almost reached a historical level. Alice closed her glass eyes, <br />
not sleeping, but feeling relaxed in the she wolf's grasp, &quot;Thank you miss Martha.... thank <br />
you...&quot; <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Dis... is annoying...&quot; Bart groaned in the office sitting on the desk.<br />
<br />
'Yeah yeah I hear ya.&quot; Jenny retorted to her brother going over the files as well.  They were <br />
writing up correction notes to explain how they had mistaken three women for men, and <br />
trying to do so without sounding like compete morons. &quot;Look on da bright side.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What bright side?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Once we write up these letters, deal with grandpa/great-grandpa, and Fran's old family... <br />
it'll be smooth sailing fer da pack from here on... personally I'll be happy fer once we get <br />
al' da dust settled. It means the pack can have just some time to ourselves...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still think a Wolvesdale would be cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too! But with five people at a time, and limited to the city limits, and not to mention <br />
the army if they think we're martians... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if we include in the transform for everyone to see us as normal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Alice proved that at least hat goes beyond Glendale.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see what happens sometime what happened if we ask someone the game when <br />
they're standing in a plot of dirt taken from inside the city limits....I wonder... could we -<br />
dare- and -transform- someone into being king of the entire world?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny started, &quot;I have no idea... the website didn't mention a thing... and  I bet nobody <br />
even THOUGHT of that before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ya can say that again.&quot; Bart said, &quot;I checked on-line, seems all anyone ever did with this <br />
curse as to make one person's life miserable, or to make some random girl into a brainless <br />
puppet. Dad is about the first to think big with it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, isn't he great?&quot; Jenny asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep! Heck! Do you think you could Transform someone into a super powerful wizard or <br />
into a god?&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny felt a chill down her spine, &quot;I really don't want to try and find out... Do you think <br />
after we have everyone we need we should try and find a way to seal the curse? To make <br />
sure it can never be used against us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ya know what dad would say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny did indeed know, &quot;Yeah.. I do. Along the lines of 'forget it, end of discussion!' Dad <br />
would never give up that kind of power he has now.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;If we do any more Transform or Dares, we really need to include some more safety <br />
measures.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I know...still, at least we have all of today to clean things up before gramps shows <br />
up.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
With the inspection done and the revamp of the mansion taken care of, and the orders <br />
from ebay having been starved off for now, the five males sat in the room that was theirs <br />
as Zackery met with his fellow males in a formal like manner.<br />
<br />
ALL of he lesser wolves were MORE than happy after the exhausting marathon yesterday to <br />
have some down time! <br />
<br />
The purple Ulysses merely meekly waved at the four grown men in the room who mostly <br />
ignored them, making Ulysses feel like a pariah. Nick kept a respectful distance from <br />
Zackery. Roger was glade to have some breathing space from his sister after the <br />
misunderstanding this morning, while Lawrence was curious about the new member of <br />
their little group. <br />
<br />
Zackery pretty much just looked right through Ulysses, treating the boy as if he wasn't <br />
even there almost. The more he looked at Roger and Lawrence, the more he felt they were <br />
both wastes of a Y chromosome, they'd have functioned so much better as she wolves, and <br />
he and Nick were really all the females would need for relief when Jennifer/Jesen couldn't <br />
or wouldn't be pleased by them. <br />
<br />
&quot;So where are those girls that you came in with? Still with Master?&quot; Roger asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;They're with Jensen yes.&quot; Zackery said. &quot;Their Transform included them to respect and <br />
obey Kaylee the way they used to Jennifer...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah.&quot; Nick nodded, &quot;Cool, cool, I was gonna see if any the ladies and Nicole felt like some <br />
pleasurable company, how about you guys?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I.. I really don't want to.&quot; Ulysses said to the dark gray wolf. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to find something to read, lay down and relax.&quot; Lawrence admitted.<br />
<br />
Roger admitted, &quot;I was going to ask Maxine if she was going to have a spot at the card <br />
game this week ...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don't worry Nick,&quot; Zack said putting a hand on his shoulder, &quot;I knew exactly how you feel, <br />
and I know precise what you mean... it's what we were made for? Right? Why shouldn't we?<br />
&quot; Zackery asked. &quot;Think of all the females who need pleasing, just for you and I.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick was surprised by Zack's friendly attitude and really hadn't been prepared for <br />
something like that.  &quot;Well, that is, thanks dude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zack leaned in closer, &quot;After all, these three are nowhere nearly as manly as us, one little <br />
boy and two who should have been female? What should we care right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick was kinda confused but nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come along, let's find some ladies who need some relief after last night...&quot; The charcoal <br />
black Zackery said calmly leading the gray Nick along. <br />
<br />
&quot;Were we just insulted by the new guy?&quot; The pastel green Roger asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Lawrence replied in a calm collected tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, just checking.&quot; <br />
<br />
Ulysses said nothing. <br />
<br />
+++++++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, won't Jennifer be surprised to see -me- a day early, now I can get a sneak peak at <br />
how my family's -really- been living when I'm not around.&quot; An old man said as he wore a <br />
black coat and black hat and dark sunglasses with a relatively big suit case.  He stood out <br />
so much like a sore thumb that every politely kept their distance on the nondescript bus <br />
he had taken into Glendale. <br />
<br />
When he had gotten off the bus and was at the front of the estate, he could only say, &quot;Of <br />
all the wastes of money... Jennifer, if you were going to guy and display art, couldn't it <br />
have been at least GOOD art?&quot; The old man said looking at the massive winged wolf <br />
dragon thing beasts statues on the walls. He mentally chalked that to one more thing he <br />
had to talk to his granddaughter about and his grandson in law. <br />
<br />
He considered ringing the buzzer, but he wanted to keep up the surprise as long as <br />
possible.  As he walked. Something alive yet made of stone sniffed the air, smelled that <br />
the old human had a similar scent to the Master, and thus was likely a member of the pack <br />
and was, for the moment allowed to pass.. though when he wasn't looking, the old man <br />
could swear he felt eyes on him. 'About time they bloody installed a security system in this <br />
place better than a gate and some locks, it's a wonder they haven't been robbed already.' <br />
He figured he was feeling hidden cameras watching him. If so, that would ruin his <br />
surprise, but at least it was a sign his family's common sense had improved and arrogance <br />
dropped down some. <br />
<br />
When he opened the double-doorway, he was stunned to find no doors anywhere inside, <br />
'So much fur security...' <br />
<br />
That was when he noticed two children shaped wolves that moved on his hind legs sitting <br />
on the couch listening to the nature channel, and some THING that looked right out of the <br />
theme park version of Hindu theology with a glass statue in it's lap. Behind it was one or <br />
two adult women covered in bright colored fur with a wolf's head, or was it a wolf shaped <br />
like a woman? <br />
<br />
When the close closed behind him from the air temperature difference, six heads all <br />
turned towards him.</p>
