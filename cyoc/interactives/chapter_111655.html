<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Come on Kiddo, shake a leg I need to beat the traffic into work today.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel sighed and shifted his backpack as he jogged down the stairs.  Mom and Dad had explained neither of them could afford to keep the house he&#39;d grown up in, but Mom had found this split level townhome within his school district.  She&#39;d said they&#39;d need to look at moving again once he got to high school, and for months Daniel had avoided unpacking more than his clothes, sure at any minute she&#39;d tell him they had to move again.  The school counselor had met with him a few times after the divorce and his grades started slipping.  She finally talked him into packing a small bag with his favorite things he kept in the hall closet.  Having that ready had finally let him relax and unpack the rest.<br />
<br />
He checked the lock on the way out, making sure the front door was firmly shut & locked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So now that the science fair is done what will you be studying?&quot; Lynn asked as she wove through the early morning traffic.  She didn&#39;t have a whole lot of time to speak with her son before she dropped him off, but wanted him to know she was interested in him.  She hadn&#39;t asked about the chronovac, but it hadn&#39;t been on the counter after Daniel set his bag by the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Standardized tests and independent study.  When I&#39;m not filling in bubbles or in study hall I&#39;ll have one-on-one instruction with Ms Ellsworth and Mr Mills.&quot;<br />
&quot;How long will that take?&quot; Lynn asked, catching a yellow light to turn onto the street that would take them to the less congested side entrance to Daniel&#39;s school.<br />
&quot;A couple hours each day, I think.&quot;<br />
&quot;Mr Mills is the vice-principal, right?&quot; She asked.<br />
&quot;And the gifted student coach, everyone get a different secondary.  Bobby gets coach Liddel &#39;cause he wants to be a physical therapist.&quot;<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll do her best to help him study.&quot; Lynn glanced at her son out of the corner of her eye. &quot;Is there something wrong with Mr Mills?&quot;<br />
&quot;No, but all the guys in class would rather have coach Liddel.&quot;  Daniel blushed and stared at his feet.<br />
&quot;Hmm, I expect I can see the appeal.  Listen Kiddo, I understand being your age.  Boys and girls start to notice eachother are different.  A woman like coach Liddel is a bit out of your league though, what about that Alice who came over to help you study algebra, and interest there?&quot;<br />
&quot;Mom!  Alice is nothing like coach Liddel, and it&#39;s not like anything would happen, I just ... whatever.&quot; Daniel pulled the door open and hopped out.<br />
&quot;Okay hon, be good!  And remember to grab the bus home, I&#39;m working late tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel stalked across the scrubby grass.  He&#39;d talked some with his dad after the school sponsored sex-ed class, and again now and then afterwards.  He ought to have known his mom wouldn&#39;t let something like that go, it was always a lecture with her.  He slipped though the fire door that never latched properly and headed to his classroom.  &#39;Early start&#39; students were supposed to go to the cafeteria or library, but if he could make it to his classroom without running into any teachers no one would come looking for him.<br />
<br />
He grabbed his homework out of his bag and dumped it in the tray on Ms Ellsworth&#39;s desk.  She usually came in after the first bell so Daniel figured he had a half hour or more to read before the other kids started showing up.  He hung his bag on the back of his chair then pulled out the chronivac emitter.  He couldn&#39;t do much with it now, but during study hall he could try hooking it up to a computer and see if he could poke around in it a bit more.  He was startled by the classroom door opening and dropped it. He froze as Ms Ellsworth strode in carrying a steaming cup of coffee.<br />
<br />
She glanced at the papers in the homework tray, then continued on past her desk to the storage closet door, fishing a set of keys out of her pocket as she walked.  She was wearing her usual white blouse and tan slacks.  The girls had asked her once if whe owned any other clothes.  She explained that she valued a professional image and wanted her class focused on what she said, not what she wore. She opened the door and stepped behind it, humming lightly as she shifted things.<br />
<br />
Daniel picked up the emitter and tried to decide whether to try and hide and hope she&#39;d leave, or sneak out the door while she was distracted.  He felt a faint vibration and looked at the emitter. The light that was normally blue was yellow, as was the large main button.  He pressed it and it flashed red, then green before going dark.  The light cycled back to blue.  Ms Ellsworth made a sound somewhere between a hiccup and a shriek before her coffee cup smashed to the floor.  Daniel realized the chronivac was pointed directly at the closet door she was standing behind.  She cursed loudly and began talking crossly to herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;  Daniel slapped his hand over his mouth and stuffed the emitter into his backpack.<br />
&quot;Who is that?  Who&#39;s there?&quot;  Ms Ellsworth peeked around the door, her normally tidy hair dangling over her face.<br />
&quot;Um, it&#39;s me.  Daniel Perez.&quot;  Daniel sunk lower in his seat. &quot;Do you want me to get some towels?&quot;<br />
&quot;Daniel?!  What are you doing in here so early?  Stay there! I need to, just stay seated okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel heard cloth rustling, and after a little while Ms Ellsworth stepped out from behind the door wearing the red poncho she put on for recess when it was raining.  She was holding something white and brown and with a jolt Daniel realized it was her blouse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you play a prank on me? Wire something up to give me a shock?&quot; She asked suspiciously.<br />
&quot;No Maam, I camen in early to read.&quot;  Daniel tried to look honest which was difficult knowing his teacher probably had nothing on under her poncho but her underwear.<br />
&quot;okay, I need you to run down to the janitor&#39;s closet and bring back a mop, I spilled coffee on myself and we need to get it cleaned up.&quot;  She gestured at the hall.<br />
&quot;Do you want me to take your t-top to start it soaking?  I help my mom with the laundry and she says stains come out faster when you get them into cold water.&quot;  Daniel felt like his cheeks were on fire, and he hardly knew what he was saying.<br />
&quot;I, um,&quot; Ms Ellsworth looked at the coffee soaked shirt she was holding. &quot;I think,&quot; she glanced at Daniel, who pulled his eyes from her chest and trembled, afraid what either of them would say next. Her posture relaxed slightly, and she gave him a half smile.  &quot;I think maybe we&#39;d both better go.  She stepped carefully out of her shoes, leaving them in the puddle of coffee, and headed towards the door. She half-turned and spoke to Daniel, the brighter light from the hallway bringing out her silhouette against the thin red nylon. &quot;Come along now Daniel, I&#39;ll want your assistance.&quot;<br />
<br />
She was out the door before Daniel managed to stand.  He told himself he must have imagined that smile, Ms Ellsworth frowned at any boy she thought was staring at the wrong place, or parts.  She was waiting for him when he opened the door and Daniel swallowed a yelp as she took his arm and hurried him along.  Her stockings slipped on the floor and she was as much skating as walking by the time they reached the janitor&#39;s closet.  She swung it open and pushed him in fallowing closely behind.  She was panting and smiling at him like they&#39;d just done something they shouldn&#39;t have.  Daniel was confused and backed against the door.  Ms Ellsworth was certainly not herself this morning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look on those shelves for a large clean basin.&quot;  She directed.  Relieved to have something to do, Daniel edged past her and started looking.  He heard a couple pops and his teacher let out a sigh.  Daniel turned around with a dusty plastic pail in time to see Ms Elssworth pull a coffee stained bra out from under the poncho.  She held it and her blouse out to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;If that&#39;s clean bring it here so we can start these soaking.&quot;<br />
<br />
Daniel forced himself to take a step forward.  The steam pipes rattled, and far away he could hear children&#39;s voices.  The smell of coffee and dank mops filled his nostrils.  He shuffled forward again and Ms Ellsworth dropped her spoiled clothing in the pail.  He could see dark rings where her poncho draped against her chest.  Daniel couldn&#39;t look away.  He&#39;d seen pictures of naked women on the internet.  He knew he was staring at his teacher&#39;s nipples.  She bent over and lifted the pail, trailing his nerveless arm and set it under the faucet in the sink.  She jerked the tap on and the thunder of water broke Daniel&#39;s mind free.  He stumbled back against the shelves.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry...&quot;<br />
&quot;Hush Daniel!  We don&#39;t want anyone to hear you and come investigating, do we?&quot;  She smiled at him again, and brushed her hair back behind her ears.  Daniel watched open-mouthed as the poncho was briefly pulled tight across her chest, across her breasts, before she put her hands on her hips.<br />
&quot;Oh, we should soak these too.&quot; She said, slipping her hands under the hem of the poncho. Another popping sound followed by a whir, and Daniel watched his teacher slide off her tan slacks, step out of them, and push them into the pail of cold water.  And she&#39;d done it while watching him as he stared at her, speechless.<br />
&quot;Brr!&quot; she said, shaking water from her hand.  She folded her arms across her belly and slid them up under her breasts.  The red plastic clung to her soft curves, and the dark circles were centered now around sharp points. &quot;This poncho isn&#39;t the warmest, you know, and here I am in just socks and, well,&quot; she reached down and flipped up the hem of the poncho, smiling broadly.  Daniel saw a flash of yellow and swallowed convulsively before turning his head away.<br />
&quot;Hey, Daniel?  Are you okay?  I&#39;d have thought, as hard as you were staring, that you&#39;d be enjoying this!&quot;  <br />
&quot;I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s happening.  Why are you doing this, showing me your... I want to leave.&quot; Daniel felt hot tears pouring down his cheeks.  He felt ashamed, and couldn&#39;t understand why, and his body felt hot and tingly and his dick hurt.<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, calm down.  Daniel, look at me.&quot; He heard rustling and turned away to face the dusty shelves.  &quot;Look. At. Me.&quot; That sounded more like his teacher.  Daniel felt her hands on his shoulders and let her turn him around.  Something scratchy rubbed his cheeks. He opened his eyes and saw Ms Ellsworth had grabbed an old rag and was kneeling in front of him wiping off his face.<br />
&quot;Blow your nose.&quot; She said, holding the rag in place.  Daniel blew, feeling very much like a small child.<br />
&quot;Okay, here&#39;s what happened this morning.  I was getting something out of the storage cupboard when you burst into the room, which startled me and I spilled my coffee.&quot; Daniel nodded.  &quot;You knew you shouldn&#39;t have been there, and I yelled at you because I scalded myself.&quot; Daniel nodded again and sniffled.  &quot;I marched you down here, handed you a mop and ordered you back to clean up the mess, and said that you have a detention every day this week for being somewhere you shouldn&#39;t have been.&quot;<br />
&quot;My mom is gonna kill me!&quot; Daniel wailed.<br />
&quot;And crying about that is why you didn&#39;t go straight back in case any of the other students are there.  Okay?&quot;  She stared at Daniel, holding his gaze.  &quot;Can you remember that?&quot;  <br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good.&quot;  She stood up and pulled the mop off the wall, handing it to Daniel. He watched her check the hall and motion him out.  Daniel staggered back towards his classroom, hearing the first bell ringing in his ears.<br />
<br />
Ms Ellsworth did not appear when the third bell indicated everyone should take their seats.  Daniel had had told the other students as they arrived that their teacher had told him to clean up the mess and he didn&#39;t know where she was.  A couple tried to get more out of him, but once he&#39;d gotten the floor as clean asit was going to be he slumped in his seat without talking or looking at anyone.  After a few minutes Mrs Bryce from the next classroom over stuck her head in to see what all the noise was about.  <br />
<br />
A few minutes later the school secretary came in and began taking attendance and handing out testing papers.<br />
&quot;You all know which rooms to go to, hurry up now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rumors swirled until lunch time, when Ms Ellsworth, wearing a school sweatshirt over her usual white blouse, was spotted eating at the faculty table as if nothing odd was going on.  Daniel felt sick every time he looked at her.  He dreaded his one-on-one that afternoon.</p>
