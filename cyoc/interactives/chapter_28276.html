<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(Written by author of the previous chapter)<br />
<br />
Dean had just left the hotel leaving his drunken younger brother behind.<br />
He walked along the dark streets bustling with other night owls.  Dean looked at his map then up at the street ahead of him.<br />
&quot;So this is Downtown Pleasure island...&quot; he says looking at a sea of buildings with bright neon signs.  Dean walked into the nearest strip club and seated himself next to the stage.  As the strippers came out and started dancing Dean didn't notice that the entire club had emptied.  Dean watched the dancers seductively dance around poles taking scraps of clothes off showing everything they had to offer.<br />
&quot;Heya Dean enjoying the show?&quot; a voice says from the back of the room.  Dean went to get up and turn around when he realized he was tied to the chair with ropes<br />
&quot;What the hell? I don't know who you are but I am not this Dean you speak of...&quot; Dean says hoping whoever this was didn't really know anything about him<br />
&quot;Save it, I know who you are and why you are here.  But most importantly I know what you did&quot; says a man who walks onto the stage as the strippers all vanish into white smoke. <br />
&quot;And what exactly did I do?&quot; Dean says<br />
&quot;Remember a while back at a university you found a trickster, tricked it, and killed it?  Well guess what, he played you as a fool, and put a bounty on you and your brothers heads!&quot;<br />
&quot;So your going to try and kill us?  Look pal nothing personal, but he was killing people first and its just what we do!&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh no, we aren't going to kill you or your brother.  You have given us a marvelous opportunity.  Do you even know what Pleasure Island is?  Its a Trickster city!  Everywhere you go we are watching every move you make will let us mess with your life.  You've only been here a few hours and already you have fallen into our tricks so much for your famous intuition.&quot; the man says walking around the tied up Dean.<br />
&quot;And what tricks are those?&quot; Dean says not believing they had already fallen prey so easily<br />
&quot;You remember these don't you?&quot; The man says a tray holding two drinks appears in his hand &quot;The ones you and your brother drank without giving a seconds hesitation, you should no better then to drink in strange bars especially when the drinks are filled with powerful mojo&quot;<br />
&quot;Well your drinks sucked anyway, and don't do much I feel perfectly fine!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well you did order one of our more bland drinks, your brother on the other hand drank a incredibly  powerful one.  He and Max are going to have a lot of fun together...&quot;<br />
&quot;Max?&quot; Dean asked confused<br />
&quot;Your brothers twin... you should know, I mean you saw them having sex when you were both still living at home, you always thought it was a phase but you saw them again when you went to pick up Sam and Max from college to find your dear dad... don't your remember?  Oh wait those memories wont surface till you fall asleep... damn I forgot to mention that didn't I?   Every time you sleep in our paradise here you will wake up thinking everything is perfectly normal.&quot; the man says trying his best to make Dean suffer as much as possible<br />
&quot;I'm going to kill you... I'm going to kill every last one of you in this park!&quot; Dean says struggling violently against his bonds.<br />
&quot;Please you couldn't kill one of us and you want to take on hundreds at a time?  Your not going to even remember any of this by morning, but you did make a good point.  Its a shame that your brother gets to experience so much of what we have to offer and you so little...&quot;  With that the man snaps his fingers and the room suddenly fills with half naked frats covered in body paint and load music partying.  the man snaps his fingers again and two frats walk up with a keg, a tube, and a funnel.  Dean suddenly realizes his own shirt is gone and he has the word ass painted onto his chest.  Suddenly the end of the tub is shoved into his mouth and for some reason he cant force himself to spit it out.  Dean felt his mouth fill with beer as the frats around him chanted.  Dean couldn't help himself as he started to swallow the constant supply of beer.  As he drank Dean felt a tugging on the back of his pants.  His bonds now gone Dean got up still drinking the beer  bending around Dean drank as he watched a lump appear in the back of his shorts ans slowly stretch downwards down the pant leg.  Dean watched as a tasseled tail poked out the bottom of his shorts grabbing it he found that it was real and his.<br />
<br />
Dean panicked he tried to yank the the tube out of his mouth to no avail.  Dean stumbled toward a mirror and watched as his ears sprouted hairs and began to grow. Grabbing his ears he gave them a yank and feeling the pain knew they were his as well.  Rubbing the back of his neck he found his hairline was growing lower down his neck ending at the collar line.  Dean tried to scream letting loose a load bray revealing a set of large equine teeth, and sending beer everywhere causing the many frats to cheer.  Dean knew what was coming next he could feel as he was drinking the beer.  He watched as the front of his shorts bulged out to comical proportions.  It continued to grow becoming painfully confined.  Dean reached down and attempted to lower the zipper to spare him the pain, but as he was about to reach the zipper he realized his nails had become long and dark resembling five mini hooves.  Pain brought him back to reality as the bulge was attempting to grow past the confines his shorts would allow.   Dean tried to pull down the zipper but his hardened fingers couldn't grip the small metal tab. With a quiet pop the zipper burst and a large light tanned sheath flopped out.  With what could only be assumed as a gasp Dean fell on all fours as a long pink cylinder poked out of the sheath and extended almost to Dean's hard pecs.  Dean started making animal noises in between gulps as his face and neck began to push out forming a still human looking mussel.  Dean continued to make distressed animal sounds as his hips started moving up and down.  The frats pointed and laughed as Dean the donkey boy masturbated on all fours.<br />
&quot;See Dean this is our island and whatever we can think up is what goes.  You my even find yourself enjoying this place&quot; the man said as Dean let out a load neigh dropping the tube out of his mouth and started spraying cum everywhere.  With each shot Dean slowly returned to his formal self on his knees gasping cum all over the floor, walls, chest, and face.<br />
<br />
The room returned to normal, the frats disappeared, and Dean's mess disappeared with the exception of the word ass painted to his chest.<br />
&quot;Now that I have your attention, your going to listen closely.&quot; he says to a very drunk Dean &quot;I'm going to give you a parting gift since you seemed to enjoy my earlier demonstration.  Every time you hear the word 'ass' you are going to change back into a donkey till you return on all fours and pleasure yourself like the animal you are, oh and before I forget you'll keep the sheath an hour longer for every time you heard the the word ass muttered!  The best part about all this is you will not even realize that anything is happening even after its over.&quot;   Dean tried to stay awake, but as the man finished his speech he passed  out.<br />
<br />
Dean woke up the next morning in a dumpster behind the club.<br />
&quot;Ugh what happened&quot; Dean said getting out the dumpster.  Looking at his chest Dean read the smeared word that was there.  Dean slowly walked back to the hotel, he needed to shower he smelt like shit, and knowing his younger brothers they were probably getting nothing done that he asked them to do.  Why he always had to be the responsible one was beyond him, but he had given up trying to get them to stop playing around with each other and focus.  Thats why he needed the night alone, but that didn't seem to have helped anything.<br />
<br />
Bursting into the hotel room Dean charged for the showers barely noticing what his brothers were doing.  Stopping and muttering a insult he walked into the bathroom and started the shower.  Moments later he heard a knock at the door and a few muffled words.  Opening the door to the bathroom Max looked at the smeared word on Dean's chest and said &quot;Whoa what happened to you!?&quot; <br />
&quot;Leave me alone Max!&quot; Dean said shutting the door.<br />
&quot;Sorry for trying to apologize ASS&quot; Max said smirking as he said the last word.<br />
<br />
Sam had started getting out of bed<br />
&quot;Oh no you don't I just bought us a good five minutes of doing anything we want&quot; he said as he pounced back onto Sam and despite his protests Max resumed his position.  Sam soon exploded in his twin brothers mouth who in turn shot his load into the bed sheets.<br />
&quot;That was fun wasn't it?&quot; Max said rolling next to Sam<br />
&quot;Ya... it was...&quot; Sam said before he snapped out of it and realized exactly what just happened &quot;Wait no this isn't right this isn't how its supposed to be I need to talk to Dean..&quot; Sam said getting out of bed and zipping up<br />
&quot;Now your starting to sound like Dean...&quot; Max said sitting up<br />
&quot;Dean I need to talk to you!&quot; Sam said knocking on the door getting answered with a loud bray<br />
&quot;Hes got another good three minutes before he'll be able to talk... so whats up man whats eating ya?&quot; Max said<br />
&quot;I don't know you, I don't know whats going on, this is all just wrong!&quot; Sam said shaking his head trying to figure things out<br />
&quot;Oh shit your serious aren't you... what is it like amnesia?&quot; Max said<br />
&quot;Maybe, but my memory contradicts what you said before... maybe a reality altering demon?&quot; Sam said trying to figure out the possibilities.<br />
&quot;Okay... we are going to have to talk to Dean about this when hes... able to talk he knows more about what might cause this then I do...&quot; Max says getting up and standing next to Sam and giving him a encouraging pat on the shoulder &quot;So what now?&quot; Max says...</p>
