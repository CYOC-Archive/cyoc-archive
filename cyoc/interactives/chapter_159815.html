<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the mall, Jake parted ways with Gina and Brin as he went to a different store.<br />
<br />
He went to the sports store to buy a pair of shoes.<br />
He wanted to be taller, but after the experience with Gina’s body, he decided that he didn’t want to be that tall. With that in mind, he picked what he thought is a fitting size. He also bought some larger socks to suit his feet due to them going to be larger.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the two towering sisters went to an underwear store to buy bras.<br />
Gina wanted to have bigger breasts than her current B cups, but she knew that too much would become a hassle in basketball. With that in consideration, she chose bras with a fitting band size and the label D.<br />
<br />
Next to her sister, Brin wanted to be extreme in breasts. The B cups she had currently were better than the flat board she had earlier, but it wasn’t anything to brag about. Especially for a person that is now a seven footer.<br />
Looking at the band size her sister chose, she picked bras with the same one. They had the same body proportion now at the end of the day aside of Brin having longer limbs and bigger feet.<br />
The big difference with the bra Brin chose next to her sister was the fact that the cup size was H, largest cup size in the shop.<br />
<br />
The bras were more expensive than the ones Gina used to buy before, especially Brin’s, but their family was wealthier than average, so it wasn’t problematic.<br />
<br />
As Jake and the amazons reunited near the car, Brin thought of an idea.<br />
“I think I’ll walk home from here.” she said. “It’s a nice day and I want to put these legs to the test.”<br />
“Besides, when the only shoes that fit me are made for sports, I better use them for that” she added, lifting one of her legs to show what was originally Gina’s “just in case shoe”, the one Brin used to get to her towering height in the first place.<br />
<br />
With that she placed her newly bought bras and started to walk to her home and Jake and Gina drove right after.<br />
<br />
Obviously, the pair in the car got to the sisters’ home first and bright the newly bought shoes and underwear, in addition to the medallion (inside the bag) that stayed in the car, inside.<br />
<br />
Then, Gina took one of the bras she bought, and the medallion out of the bag, held them together and felt the familiar shock.<br />
“Your turn” she said, handing the medallion to Jake. “I doubt Brin will get here soon even with those stupidly long legs, so let’s do it now.”<br />
<br />
After some hesitation, Jake grabbed the medallion and took one of the shoes he bought from the box, and then, he also felt the familiar shock.<br />
“Now comes the waiting game” he said<br />
<br />
As both waited, the minutes passed while both sat down.<br />
A few minutes later, Jake felt his shoes digging into his feet, his toes having to bend to stay inside. The difference to last time it happened to him was that he knew what was happening, so he removed the shoes and socks without hesitation. Looking at his feet, he saw as they slowly expanded.<br />
For comfort, Gina also removed her own shoes.<br />
A few more minutes, and Gina’s bra felt uncomfortable. Although a lot less subtle than simply removing shoes, Gina suddenly took off her shirt and then her bra before Jake could react, revealing her two mounds puffing up and up, with her nipples slowly becoming bigger.<br />
<br />
Jake tried to look away, but Gina pulled his face back.<br />
“Don’t you look away” she said teasingly as she pulled him in for a kiss.<br />
They were both still very inexperienced in kissing, but it was still a very pleasurable one, and slightly less awkward than last time.<br />
<br />
After letting go, Gina pulled Jake’s now larger hand into her swelling breast. “Touch them”<br />
Jake didn’t back away. It felt soft and warm, and he could feel the flesh slowly getting towards him. He felt his underwear becoming tighter in the front.<br />
A minute or so after, Jake backed away. “Brin will probably come soon” Jake said. “We should prepare.<br />
<br />
Soon after, Gina didn’t feel her breasts growing anymore. They stuck out more by a notable amount, and the nipples were bigger.<br />
“Well, what do you think of my new boobs?” She asked Jake, but then looked down and got the answer. “Looks like it’s a yes”<br />
<br />
Putting on one of her new bras, it was a perfect fit, and also formed some nice cleavage. She then put on her shirt, which still fit.<br />
Afterwards, she stood up, and Jake followed after.<br />
The height difference between them was now a lot smaller, though still drastic, and looking at his clothes, they were too short, but they still fit.<br />
“Well, looks like you are not so short anymore” Gina said, as Jake formed a little smile on his face.<br />
<br />
Then they were interrupted by a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
During all the experience between Jake and Gina, Brin walked home, enjoying her higher view and longer strides. She was a magnet for attention, towering over everyone, and she loved it.<br />
It took her 45 minutes to get home, but it would have usually taken her well over an hour to cover that distance, so she walked far faster than normal by just casually walking with her record breaking legs.<br />
She knocked on her home’s door.<br />
<br />
As Gina opened the door, Brin noticed how her chest was a lot more ample than before, and looking at Jake, he didn’t appear as short as before from her high vantage point.<br />
Brin was a bit angry, but calmed down quickly afterwards.<br />
“You changed without me! Then again, my change of height was far more drastic than Jake’s and my upcoming change of bust is going to be far more drastic than yours... You know what, I’m fine with that... this time...”</p>
