<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"O-o-okay," Jennifer decided. "Traaansform or Daa-aa-aare?"
<P>"Transform," Claire said, a bit hesitantly.
<P>"Yo-o-ou're going to tu-urn intooo a spider-girl whooo caa-aa-an ma-a-ake the be-
e-est silk in the wo-o-orld, a-a-aaand everyone but yooou a-a-and mee-ee will act like 
yoou've alwa-a-ays been thaa-aat waa-aaa-aaay."
<P><I>Jeez</I>, she thought, <I>I'd better remember to ask Claire to take this stupid 
bleat out of my voice.</I>
<P>Jennifer heard a shriek over the line. "A spider? A <I>spider?!</I>"
<P>"Whaaa-aat's the deal?" Jennifer asked. "Yooou wa-aaanted--"
<P>"I'M AFRAID OF SPIDERS!" Claire took a couple of breaths and her voice calmed down. 
"Very funny, Jen. You had me going for a second. We'll see if I ever talk to you aga--"
<P>Jennifer heard Claire pause in mid-sentence and she knew it had begun.
<P ALIGN=CENTER>* * *
<P ALIGN=LEFT>Claire had been in her bedroom, doing homework. She was wearing a 
pink tank top that ended above her belly button and bell-bottom jeans. She had removed 
her socks in favor of a pair of yellow bunny slippers. She had been talking to Jennifer at 
her desk, but a sudden twisting that could be felt all over her body caused her to drop the 
phone and come uneasily to her feet.
<P>Her entire body felt distorted. It wasn't exactly painful, but it was certainly a 
disturbing sensation. She moved her arms across her upper body, trying to feel out 
anything unusual. It wasn't until she looked in her vanity mirror that she began to realize 
the Transform or Dare curse was real.
<P>Her tan skin grew to a dark brown, and thin feelers grew at irregular intervals out of 
her arms. A new flurry of sensations in her pants made her realize they had grown on her 
legs as well. Lumps appeared underneath her top, on either side of her body. She watched 
the lumps twist and grow, attempting to escape from the confines of the fabric. Claire was 
so afraid she couldn't even lift it off herself. Eventually her new pair of arms tore their way 
out, looking very long and lanky and with feelers of their own. Their thin hands only had 
two thin fingers and a thumb the same size. Claire saw that her original hands were 
reshaping to match; her pinky and ring fingers shrunk and disappeared into her thinning 
palms, and her remaining digits thinned and grew slightly longer. They all ended at fine 
points.
<P>"This isn't happening...," Claire stammered. "Jen...tell me this isn't happening!" She 
hugged her body tight with all four of her arms, shivering with fear.
<P>Then she felt a pressure at the base of her spine. The waist of her pants began to 
tighten. In the mirror she could see another bulge forming...this time above her rear. The 
tightening grew worse, yet she couldn't bring herself to undo her pants and behold what 
new horror was being done to her. After another excruciating minute, a large mound of 
flesh tore her pants apart. Its connection to her lower back was very slim compared to its 
sheer size. It was the size of four footballs--and it had a similar shape--but it hadn't 
stopped growing.
<P>Now that her pants were demolished, they had fallen to her feet. Claire saw the 
familiar brown skin and feelers on her legs. Kicking off the pants and slippers, she saw 
that her feet, like her hands, were longer and thinner now. They both had only two toes, 
short and pointed. On each foot, the toes curved toward each other like pincers.
<P>Her vision split. It was as if she was seeing six or more pictures of her room all 
overlapping. She placed a couple of hands over her head, disoriented, and suddenly her 
vision cleared. She looked in the mirror and saw where her hands were placed. A cold chill 
ran through her as she slowly lifted them to reveal six brand new eyes. One pair had 
grown next to her original ones, toward the sides of her face. All four looked identical. 
Another pair was placed in the middle of her forehead, and diagonally outward from there 
was the final pair. These four were small and beady, and all eight of her eyes were a deep, 
cold black.
<P>She opened her mouth and tried to mutter something, but her shock was too much. 
She slowly backed away from her mirror in disbelief and disgust at what she was 
becoming. Meanwhile, her spider abdomen was continuing to grow, causing her significant 
trouble balancing. After only a few steps, she fell over, experiencing a sharp pain from her 
new protrusion. She rolled to her side, her hands clutching the soft carpet, eyes shut in 
denial.
<P>She felt the next stage of the transformation. Her legs split apart, forming an identical 
pair only a foot from the original. Her waist lengthened slightly to accommodate. Her teeth 
sharpened and two small bulges formed on either side of her gums. Soon they sprouted 
four-inch opposeable fangs that curled inward from either side. Her lips reshaped to allow 
these fangs to always protrude out from her gums while keeping the rest of her mouth 
closed. Finally, her short blond hair darkened to a deep, silky black. Although the strands 
were thinner, they had a vibrant shine to contrast their shade.
<P>Lying still on the carpet in silence, Claire heard Jennifer's faint voice over the phone.
<P>"Claa-aaire? Aaaare yooou o-o-okaaay?"
<P>"Jennifer," Claire whispered. "She did this." Claire slowly tried to stand up. It was 
difficult attempting to maneuver four legs and a bulky abdomen sticking out of her back, 
but she eventually succeeded. She saw that her abdomen had grown to a frightening size. 
It was almost three feet long and very plump. She wondered how this ghastly thing could 
stay attached with a connection at her spine only a few inches across. Looking at its other 
end, she saw that it came to a slender tip which curved slightly downward. <I>So I'll be a 
silk spinner for the rest of my life, huh?</I> she thought. <I>Let's see if I can share this 
pain with Jennifer.</I> Claire's fear had turned into anger and hatred. In fact, the more 
she looked at her newly transformed body, the more she started liking it, much as it 
scared her to admit.
<P>Jennifer's voice was still calling over the phone. Claire walked back to her desk, 
finding that her four new legs and long feet had made it much easier to balance her 
strange body. She accidentally brought both left arms down to grab the phone, and after 
some confusion over which arm was getting what signal from her brain, she managed to 
pick it up.
<P>"Okay, you bitch," Claire said vindictively. "If this curse stuff is real, then you're about 
to get a doozy."</p>
