<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;You look so happy..&quot; Tabitha said. &quot;And even better looks than me! I wish I had your body.&quot; I grinned at Tabitha. &quot;What?&quot; she inquired. And then it dawned upon her, and suddenly I was looking at my former body. I had the ring again! I expected Tabitha to cry out or something, but she, in my former body just giggled and absentmindedly rubbed her breast. Looks like Tabitha's ideal lover has a few modifications, and I wanted to find out what they were. <br />
<br />
It is my real body, after all, and I intend to keep it that way. &quot;I wish that the &quot;ideal lover&quot; wish was undone.&quot; Tabitha stopped rubbing her breasts, and seemed to realize where she was. &quot;Wha?&quot; was all she managed to get out. I quickly slipped the ring on her finger, and still touching it, wished that I was back in my real body. A second later, I was looking up at Tabitha. I quickly sprang off the couch, now in my real male body, and said quickly, &quot;I wish you were unable to move.&quot; <br />
<br />
Tabitha looked at me with hate in her eyes. &quot;I wish you would tell me what characteristics your ideal lover would have.&quot; I said promptly. She involuntarily opened her mouth and said in a flat voice, &quot;My ideal lover is a woman, same age as me, long light brown hair, tits the size of mine, with bigger nipples, she has the same height as me, a...&quot; <br />
<br />
She went on and on with the basic stuff. Basically, her ideal lover would be a hot woman with the same kind of body as her, lesbian, of course, which was all typical for a lesbian, I suppose. But then something she said got my attention. &quot;A longer tongue, breasts that lactate constantly, 2x the regular vaginal fluids, greatly increased flexibility, a constant urge to have sex, a high body sensitivity, a low IQ, (I remembered the ditzy feeling I had) a very suggestible and submissive attitude, and an ability to live healthily on the bodily fluids of a woman. And there she stopped, while I absorbed all of this. I smiled. &quot;Now, I wish for you to become the ideal lover you just described.&quot; <br />
<br />
Hate flamed in her eyes, soon replaced by an almost blank expression as she began to change. She managed to hold on to one sentence though, and said it to me. &quot;I wished, when I had the ring, that if you ever somehow got the ring again, and returned your body to normal, you would turn back into my ideal lover. When you complete your change, it will be permanent, and no wish you make can change your mind or body. I also wished you would give the ring back to me.&quot; She giggled, smiled a bit, and started giggling a bit more as the changes took place in her.&quot; And one more thing. You have been effectively erased from history and from people's minds, and there's another affect..it happens when..*groan..when..*ahhhh...&quot; She stopped talking, and seemed to lose awareness of her surroundings as the changes overtook her. I was horrorstruck. Already I could see the changes that had been going on, unnoticed, as I listened to what she was saying about her ideal lover. I could feel my mind starting to cloud. And then there was that second wish she made to worry about... I let out a small giggle. I stifled another one, and tried to concentrate. I began walking to her, involuntarily, hand outstretched, with the ring on it, offering it to her. <br />
<br />
I managed to let out one last gasp. &quot; I wish that I could-&quot; My chest heaved, and two perfect breasts grew from it- &quot;think clearly.&quot; Instantly, the heavy, cloudy feeling I had dissipated, and I could think clearly. There was no time to lose. My waist thinned, and my butt inflated. I had to make a quick wish, before my change was complete. &quot;I wish that I didn't have to give the ring to Tabitha.&quot; My legs halted, and I could move them again. I made another wish, quickly, because I didn't know when the transformation would stop. &quot;I wish that my personality wasn't submissive or suggestible.&quot; My face rearranged, and some internal organs moved about. I felt a stirring in my crotch. I thought fast, trying to make use of the time. &quot;I wish-&quot; Too late. The tingling stopped, and my change was over. And permanent.<br />
<br />
I looked myself over. I was just like before, when I first wished to become Tabitha's ideal lover, with a few differences in personality and IQ. Due to Tabitha's wish, there was a small stream of milk going down from my new breast. I grimaced when I looked down a my little bush of brown hair. Of course, Tabitha's image of a lover is a lesbian, so I was still attracted to women. Thank God for that, I couldn't imagine having sex with a man. But, according to her, no one in the world remembered me; I had no record, no birth date, nothing. I had my wallet in my pocket when first came to Tabitha's apartment. I got it out from my pants, which were discarded during Tabitha's brief dominance of me. There were no Visa cards, no drivers' license, just the money that had been in there earlier. I then realized that she hadn't said anything about wishing to change anything else about me other than my body. I could wish myself an identity again! But as I thought about it, the more reluctant I became to doing it. There would be no bills to pay, no people inquiring about me. I looked around Tabitha's apartment. I suppose I didn't have my house anymore, so I could live here. Tabitha was on the floor seemingly passed out. We were practically twins. I left her, despite my urges, and explored her apartment.<br />
<br />
As I went into her bedroom, her telephone rang. I decided not to pick it up, and an answering machine answered. &quot;Hello, this is Tabitha, I'm busy right now, so please feel free to leave a message after the beep.&quot; said the recorded voice. Another voice came on, a woman's. &quot;Hello Tabitha, I just wanted to remind you I'm coming over for one of our usual &quot;visits&quot;, I'll be there in five minutes. See you!&quot; The answering machine clicked off. I decided there was nowhere else to go, and so sat down near the door. I wished that no one would notice that neither the unconcsious Tabitha nor me were naked, or notice anything strange about anything we did. It got me aroused to think of walking around naked with Tabitha. I made a wish to conceal the ring to anyone else but me, unlocked the door, and waited for Tabitha's friend to arrive. I had the ring. Nothing could happen to me now.</p>
