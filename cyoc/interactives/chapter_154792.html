<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You and Yasmin are back at the lagoon, hanging out on the rocks under the waterfall. It&#39;s pretty relaxing, feeling the cool water splash down from on high and run down your back and your fish-tail. Your mermaid companion looks positively enticing with the rivulets and droplets of water coursing down her hair and breasts. You&#39;ve been catching her up on movies she&#39;s missed in the last four decades, and she hangs on your every word.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ewoks?&quot; she giggles. &quot;Seriously?&quot;<br />
<br />
You shrug. &quot;Blame George Lucas.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin wiggles her scaly butt so that she can shimmy closer to you on the rock and cuddle up close to you. She places a hand on your chest, and her tailfin brushes suggestively against yours. She gazes into your eyes and says quietly, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen a film in nearly forty years, and I haven&#39;t seen a man in just as long. So I&#39;m going to kiss you now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You don&#39;t object, and so the mermaid leans closer and brushes her lips against yours. You respond to her kiss enthusiastically and take Yasmin into your arms, and she moans into your mouth, clearly enjoying herself. Your tongues touch, and as the minutes tick by your lips become pleasantly numb from making out. Then you feel Yasmin&#39;s tail wrap around yours and pull, and the both of you slide off the rock and plunge under the water of the lagoon together.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s heaven: hovering under the water in a tropical paradise of a lagoon, a sexy mermaid wrapped around you, kissing you with abandon. You reach for both of Yasmin&#39;s buoyant, melon-sized breasts and give them an experimental squeeze; they&#39;re most exquisite pair that you&#39;ve ever felt. You&#39;re just about to take things to the next level and play with her nipples, when she breaks off the kiss and stops you. She&#39;s breathing heavily (it&#39;s just now that you really notice for the first time, neither of you has anything like gills; somehow, your lungs are equally adapted to breathing water and air), a dazed look on her face, and she says, &quot;Wait. Before we take this any further, I have to explain Rule Number Three.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; you say. You&#39;re feeling pretty hot and bothered now too, and your pulse and heavy breathing reflect that. &quot;Uh . . . Rule Number One was don&#39;t try to leave the island or you&#39;ll die. Rule Number Two, the mer-change thing is permanent, so get over it. And I&#39;m guessing that Rule Number Three has something to do with sex?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin nods. &quot;Simply put, mermaids can&#39;t have sex. We don&#39;t have the anatomy for it. We can&#39;t even orgasm. And believe me, some of the mermaids have been here for literal centuries, and they&#39;ve tried everything you could ever think of, and some things that would never occur to you. And it&#39;s never happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never even once?&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin shakes her head sadly. &quot;Not that any mermaid has ever heard. Basically, we&#39;re all still wired just like humans in terms of hormones and brain chemistry and everything, and we still *want* sex. But it&#39;s just plain impossible to make our fishy parts feel pleasure enough to climax. We can get really close from nipple-stimulation, but in the end it just leads to unsatisfied arousal and constant sexual frustration.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn,&quot; you breathe. &quot;That . . . really sucks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; says Yasmin. She&#39;s still holding onto you in a loose embrace, but she doesn&#39;t make another move to continue your love-play. She&#39;s waiting for you to decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
You think for a moment and ask, &quot;So, uh, even if we can&#39;t have sex, do mermaids still have — uh, genitals, or anything like that? Some way to reproduce?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well reproduction has always been out of the question,&quot; said Yasmin, &quot;because there have never been any mermen until you came along. But to answer your question, yes, we do have a . . . a hole there,&quot; she indicates her midsection, where her groin would be if she were still a woman, &quot;tiny, and just about impossible to open if it&#39;s not the right time of year.&quot; She smiles sadly and explains, &quot;On one particular day every spring, all of us mermaids suddenly feel compelled to lay our eggs out in the open waters. It&#39;s . . . it doesn&#39;t feel like anything. Except maybe cramps and squirting — like having a really chunky period.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ew.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah.&quot; After a long pause, Yasmin continues. &quot;Still, it&#39;s just been so long since I&#39;ve been held in a man&#39;s arms, I&#39;d really like to keep going with you for a while. If you don&#39;t mind. Even knowing how this will end.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; you say. &quot;But, uh . . . maybe we could start by checking to see how my, uh, anatomy is different from yours? I have to admit, I&#39;ve been curious about it, and I haven&#39;t really had the chance to, um, check myself out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin smiles, and this time it genuinely reaches her eyes. &quot;That sounds like a lovely idea. Now you have me curious too, to find out what a merman is like below the belt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m, uh, pretty sure I don&#39;t have a penis anymore,&quot; you admit. &quot;I mean, you&#39;re super hot, so if I did, I&#39;d definitely be feeling it, and, uh . . .&quot; you blush, embarrassed to admit it, &quot;I&#39;m not really feeling anything down there now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin smiles at the complement, and then sighs and lets herself sink down a couple of feet so that her head is level with your waist in the water. &quot;That&#39;s typical for us,&quot; she says. She starts feeling around the front of your tail, and as she examines you, she says, &quot;So far, you&#39;re one and one when it comes to our expectations: on the one hand, none of us ever expected to see a merman; but on the other, you&#39;re trapped here just like we are.&quot; Then, you feel something tickle you in the general groin-region of your fishy midsection, and Yasmin pronounces, &quot;Well, you&#39;ve got a slit here too, but it&#39;s even smaller than a mermaid&#39;s—I almost missed it.&quot; <br />
<br />
She lightly kisses your scales and runs her tongue over the minuscule opening. The feeling is pleasant, but underwhelming, and when Yasmin asks about it, you say as much. She sighs again and says, &quot;Well, so far that makes you two and one in the—oh, hello.&quot; She notices a slight bulge in your tail, just above the slit. &quot;What have we here?&quot; She prods at the spot with her finger, and your eyes practically roll back into your head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um . . . careful there. That was definitely one of my balls.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin gasps and covers her mouth with her hand. &quot;Oh my God, I&#39;m sorry! Did that hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just please don&#39;t ever hit me there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin giggles; then she gets a look of wicked mischief on her face, and she begins to kiss at your slit and play with the twin bulges with her fingers and lips. That feels . . . well it&#39;s certainly something else. Arousing, but nothing like sex. Nevertheless, the excitement of making love to a mermaid returns, and you now return the favor to Yasmin, spinning your bodies around in the water so that you&#39;re floating opposite to each other, not quite in a sixty-nine position, but instead angled so that you can play with her breasts and suck on her nipples, and Yasmin can simultaneously do the same to your masculine chest.<br />
<br />
You drive each other to the limits of arousal, and eventually, as you know that it must, frustration wins out. You and Yasmin collapse together into a loving embrace as you sink to the bottom of the lagoon.<br />
<br />
As you come down from the buzzing, painful-pleasurable feeling of over-stimulation in your nipples, you lie on the sandy seabed with your arm and Yasmin&#39;s shoulders, and she cuddles you close. She casually draws a finger down, following your pecks, your abs, and down to the front of your tail again, and she once again comes to the spot where your gonads are locked away underneath a layer of muscle and fish-scales. She plays with the little bump again and swirls her finger around your slit, and quite by accident, she triggers a different reaction in your body: you feel your testicles tighten up, and the muscles in your fish-groin contract, and suddenly a cloud of milky white fluid spurts out into the water. <br />
<br />
You and Yasmin both stare at the floating semen-cloud in no small measure of surprise. She gawks at your ejaculate and exclaims, &quot;Did you just *come*!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; you say. &quot;I mean, yes, obviously, but also no. There was no orgasm, no tingle, no nothing. Just . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just what?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know, a kind of relaxing feeling?&quot; you explain. &quot;It felt . . . more like peeing than cumming.&quot;<br />
<br />
For some reason, Yasmin finds that hilarious: she bursts into peals of laughter and says, &quot;Oh, well that&#39;s good then, both of our genders&#39; reproductive acts can be equally gross together.&quot;<br />
<br />
You snicker along with Yasmin and then roll over and kiss her. &quot;Well, now I guess we know how you make a merman fertilize mermaid eggs when the time comes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin&#39;s eyes go wide. &quot;You&#39;re right! We could actually . . . reproduce! For the first time in hundreds and hundreds of years, we could make little mer-babies!&quot;<br />
<br />
You freeze up at the notion. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like such a good idea,&quot; you say. &quot;The area within the Barrier is so small—would there really be enough food to go around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that doesn&#39;t matter!&quot; says Yasmin. &quot;Mermaids are immortal! We can feel hunger, but we can&#39;t ever starve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yasmin ignores your comment, suddenly very excited. &quot;I think I have to tell the others about you as soon as possible. The Queen is definitely going to want to meet you, and—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a Queen? A Mermaid Queen!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; says Yasmin. &quot;The eldest mermaid. She and her closest friends have been here the longest. Now, let me see; what must I do to contact them?&quot;<br />
<br />
While Yasmin ponders and mutters to herself, you take a little swim around the lagoon. It&#39;s really a beautiful place; and you also discover something interesting. There&#39;s a little cave behind the waterfall, a tunnel that leads somewhere into the cliffs that surround the lagoon. Hm, you think to yourself, that might be worth exploring. You also remember that there are other beaches on the island where you could maybe explore inland a little bit, and a few shipwrecks to check out.</p>
