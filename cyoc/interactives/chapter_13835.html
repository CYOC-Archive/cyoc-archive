<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There, waiting for the two naked Tonys was Mark.  <br />
&quot;Um, sorry, um . . Claire.  I didn't mean to do that to you.  Um, which one of you is Claire, anyway?&quot; said Mark looking at the two absolutely identical nude model bodies, every muscle, every square inch of perfect, velvety skin the same.<br />
&quot;I am&quot; said the naked Tony on the left in Tony's deep voice.<br />
<br />
Mark dug out the running suit he and Tony had brought for her and tossed it to that nude young man.  Meanwhile, Tony took a few quick steps to one side and peered around the corner.  A little ways off, a group of spectators was approaching.  <br />
&quot;Alright, change her back&quot; said Tony over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
A moment later, Tony felt the mild sting of the electric wave passing through his body.<br />
&quot;Hey, what're you doing?&quot; he demanded of Mark and advanced on him and saw Claire, pulling off the running suit she'd just been pulling on over her new masculine body.  She tossed it toward Tony.<br />
<br />
Tony noticed his perspective changing such that he was now looking Mark in the eye.  He saw the muscles of his arms and shoulders diminishing and felt his shoulders narrowing.  He felt an urge to cry at this loss of strength.  As he watched, in shock, his already narrow waist squeezed even thinner and his hips widened and his thighs became much thicker.  He felt his widened ass with hands that had become much smaller without his noticing and was shocked at the wide expanse of his new buttocks thinking he was measuring them with his old, masculine hands.  As his hair was rapidly growing out to shoulder length and face reshaping, Tony's focus was on his chest as his small pink nipples grew larger and then beneath them, two perky, apple sized breasts pushed out from the diminishing muscle of his chest.  Finally, his tangerine sized scrotum and pulled back inside him and he could feel his new vagina and ovaries forming.  At the same time, his giant penis dwindled to just a pencil eraser sized clitoris.  Toni looked at her reflection in a puddle of water and saw Claire.  Mark had transformed him into a perfect physical copy of his own girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very funny, Mark!&quot; said Toni and she instantly covered her mouth with both hands, shocked at hearing Claire's high soft voice.  &quot;Change me back!  Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mark laughed.  &quot;Get dressed, honey!  The battery's too low now to process another change&quot;<br />
&quot;What?!&quot;  Toni stormed over to the laptop, pulling the running suit pants up over her full, round, female butt and the top down over her lovely girlish tits as she inspected the laptop to be sure that Mark was telling the truth.<br />
&quot;This-this isn't funny, Mark!  I-I have places to go and things to do, today.  I-&quot;<br />
&quot;You're going to your ballet class, Claire, where you'll be partnered by your boyfriend, Tony&quot;<br />
Toni stood there sputtering at the sight of Claire, in his old body, smirking from where she stood behind Mark.<br />
&quot;I always wanted to take ballet class with you, but you never wanted to do it&quot; Toni heard Claire say in his old, deep voice.  &quot;Now we can take class with Mark.  And we can get together afterward, too.  You never wanted to go along with my wearing a strap-on and doing you.  Well, I've got the best strap on a girl could have now, yours!&quot; said Claire with a pat of her thick new penis.<br />
<br />
Toni fumed while Claire laughed and Mark smirked.<br />
<br />
Just an hour later, Toni found herself in the girls' locker room at the ballet school, squeezing what were actually slender girls' hips that seemed massively wide compared to her old body into a unitard.  Toni pulled on her toe shoes and went out with the other girls.  To her surprise, she somehow knew what all the steps were supposed to be.  She effortlessly danced with her boyfriend Tony.  She had to call Claire that in public.  Their partnership was a seamless unison of steps.  The instructors were very impressed.  <br />
&quot;You two were meant to dance together&quot; said the teacher.  And while &quot;Tony&quot; smiled at this, Toni fumed.  It seemed like it was saying he was meant to be the female of the partnership.  Toni's annoyance at that implication fueled her further annoyance at something else that occurred during class.  She caught herself staring at &quot;Tony's&quot; and Mark's buns and absentmindedly licking her lips at the sight of their exceptional boy buns.  It wasn't surprising that being physically female should affect what she found attractive, but the tingle she felt at the sight of the twin arcs of muscle barely contained by their tights still infuriated her.  The sight of their dance belt shaped packages was just as maddening.  <br />
<br />
But Toni played her part and danced her best.  She showered and changed afterward and was spun around and french kissed by Claire as soon as she emerged from the girls' locker room.  She returned the affection only as minimally necessary.  To her annoyance, Claire seemed to be relishing her fantastic new body and taking an aggressive role.  But, Toni endured Claire's big hand on her new female derriere, squeezing and patting all the while as they walked out of the dance school to the parking lot.<br />
<br />
She endured it because she expected immediate relief as soon as they got home.  They'd barely entered the St. Martin house before Toni was whispering angrily.  &quot;Change me back!  Change me back!&quot;<br />
&quot;Alright, alright&quot; Mark promised, but when they got to Tony's room, the AC adapter was gone.  Toni fumed and threatened violence even in her 115 pound state.  Mark ran downstairs and asked their mother what had happened to their AC adapter.<br />
&quot;Oh, Cindy and her friends took it.  They're going on that school trip.  I figured it was more important for them to have it.&quot;<br />
Mrs. St. Martin couldn't understand why Tony's girlfriend got so huffy about the whole thing, calling her names and accusing her of all sorts of things in the raising of her children before Tony and Mark almost literally carried her back upstairs.  She must have gotten over it because Mrs. St. Martin was sure she heard her and Tony making out a short while later, the floor creaking slightly as their bed bounced up and down.</p>
