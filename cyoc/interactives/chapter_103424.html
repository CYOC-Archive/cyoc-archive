<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning came quietly out to the campsite where Nate and Alex were at. Their night had gone well with s&#39;mores and Alex felt that Nate had told a pretty good ghost story before they retired for the night. They both awoke in their sleeping bags to hear the sound of a soft breeze rustling the trees around them and to feel the morning sun shine through the material of the tent. Nate gave a low yawn as he sat up and looked to Alex as he sat up as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning,&quot; Nate said to his boyfriend as they sat up, &quot;have a good night?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; Alex said slowly and gave a yawn and stretched, &quot;thankfully no nightmares from your ghost story.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think I&#39;d try to give you nightmares?&quot; Nate asked slightly teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... but the point of a good ghost story is to be spooky,&quot; Alex gave a smile, &quot;and your story was good in that regard. And a good spooky story has the chance to do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate nodded and rolled over partially to pull some clean clothes out from his duffel bag. While he pulled on a pair of dark blue boxer-briefs he could hear Alex doing roughly the same thing. Neither of them knew about the man that had been sent to spy on Jennifer Harper and the town and the Skulk&#39;s effort&#39;s to protect Moon Lake&#39;s newest werevixen, but that wasn&#39;t entirely Nate or Alex&#39;s concern. They were happy have time together without real interruption. It also let Nate think over the things that they had studied over the day before at the college, on being a teacher while also writing on the side, and if Alex liked his story, that gave Nate some confidence in doing that.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you liked the story?&quot; Nate asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Alex answered, &quot;it was good and spooky, just like any ghost story SHOULD be. If you put similar effort into whatever novels you decide to write, you know I&#39;ll buy your books.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate smiled, as while Alex might not be a professional critic, his opinion did matter to him. Alex&#39;s support gave him plenty of confidence with regard following the route that had been offered for him as an idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; Nate smiled and gave Alex a kiss on the cheek, &quot;though hopefully others have the same opinion as you. Because we really wouldn&#39;t have much success if our only financial income from the sale of my stories comes from you... especially when I&#39;d probably just GIVE you a copy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded and the two continued to get dressed and then began to crawl out of the tent. They both stretched as they got out of their tent and looked out to see the bright new day. Alex was quick to move over to his car and the trunk of it. Nate heard the trunk pop open and then Alex going through a large igloo that held all their food. While he felt pleased with what Alex felt of his storytelling, he wondered a bit on what would be the plan for Saturday. The campsites, both for weres and normals wasn&#39;t too far from the lake, and they could enjoy some time swimming, which could be fun. Nate had been to a few &quot;pool parties&quot; back in Minnesota before the Anderson family left. They had been fun, and Nate even enjoyed some of the &quot;cannonball contests&quot; that had gone on. There was also the possibility of going hiking, which made sense in a sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you want to do today?&quot; Nate heard Alex ask to him for a moment.<br />
<br />
Nate blinked and then turned to Alex who was standing there with a box of cinnamon buns. They looked and smelled pretty good, even though they&#39;d be cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you want to do today?&quot; Alex asked again as he held out the tray of cinnamon buns.<br />
<br />
Nate took one and sniffed at the frosting on the bun, and relished it deeply. The two of them then made their way to the bench that they had sat at the night before. As he sat down Nate gave a bit of a shrug to Alex.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really sure on what to do for today,&quot; Nate commented, &quot;I mean we could obviously go swimming or go hiking while we&#39;re out here... since we can&#39;t spend all day in the tent if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Alex agreed, &quot;well... the lake would be pretty cold right now. It might be best to go hiking. There are a few good hiking trails that are here. They&#39;re all pretty easy trails to use and follow, that will give views of the lake and the town as they go up into the mountains near the camping areas, as well as a side area that&#39;s rather special for town events.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Town events?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you know how there are some days that they&#39;ll let us transform during the day, right?&quot; Alex said to Nate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorta like a holiday,&quot; Nate nodded and took a bite of his cinnamon bun, &quot;as a special occasion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex nodded, &quot;Yeah. Well, for the town celebrations on special days when we can transform in public during the day... it&#39;s in a more open area that&#39;s off the roads and private enough that we can all be together and people driving through Moon Lake on their way to Seattle or the Pacific coast cities, we won&#39;t be revealing ourselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So everyone comes out here and then hikes there?&quot; Nate wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everyone that wants to come,&quot; Alex nodded.<br />
<br />
Nate nodded, and thought for a moment. That gave him some contented chewing on the cinnamon bun as he thought things over. Eventually he did come to a decision and swallowed the bite of cinnamon bun that he had in his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that sounds interesting,&quot; Nate said after a moment, &quot;once we get things done with breakfast, a good hike and seeing this field could be fun. We can go swimming later... and hopefully Eric and Julie don&#39;t decide to come to the lake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...?&quot; Alex wondered, &quot;You don&#39;t like him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I love him as my brother,&quot; Nate answered, &quot;but I don&#39;t want to be shown up by him since he is a weremer. Swimming is probably his thing now.&quot;</p>
