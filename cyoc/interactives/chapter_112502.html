<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle suddenly felt an Erge to relive himself as he got an erection all of a sudden. His penis grew to almost double the size. <br />
<br />
He went the the bathroom and put a tight grip on his penis and began to masterbate. He knew how to do this because he had learnt about it in sex education at school and he also had seen some inappropriate videos online. He kept going as it felt even more pleasurable until he finally ejected semen into the toilet.<br />
<br />
He washed up and he went back to his room (still naked). He was about to change back when he fought &quot;What if I can keep this body&quot;. Then he thought how weird it would be for his mum to see him as an adult so he thought for a second. He then remembered that maybe he could find something else to help in the magic shop. <br />
<br />
Kyle glanced at the time and it was 4:37pm and his mum gets home around 6:00pm. He had to get to the shop quick but he had no clothes that fit him. Even his boxers were too tight to put back on.<br />
<br />
He went into his parents room and found some of his dad&#39;s clothes. He got a pair of black shorts with a dark red t-shirt, some larger boxers and some ankle socks. He thought the shorts would be a good choice to show off the muscle and hair on his legs. as he was about to close the draw, Kyle caught a glimpse of his dad&#39;s red speedo and he thought &quot;I gotta try this out&quot;.<br />
<br />
Kyle walked over to the mirror and put on the speedo, luckily he was just his dad&#39;s size. He thought it looked so sexy while flexing his muscles. His bulge in the speedo made him feel even more manly, the bulge wasn&#39;t that tight either because the groin area was a bit stretched from his dad wearing them.<br />
<br />
He realised that time was sliping away so he took off the speedo to once again to reveil his huge penis and low hanging testicals.<br />
<br />
He put on the clothes he took out of the draw earlier (black shorts, dark red t-shirt, larger boxers and ankle socks) and went down stairs. It was now 4:56pm. When he got down stair he grabbed his trainers but then realised that they wouldn&#39;t fit him now so he had to get his dad&#39;s. He put his trainers back and took his dad&#39;s. When he put his dad&#39;s trainers on, he decided to undo the top buttons on his shirt to show off some of his sexy chest hair.<br />
<br />
He grabbed some money and started walking to the magic shop. Loads of women gave him the &quot;I want you look&quot; and the new sexual drive that came with his older body wanted him to go up to the women but he pushed the drive aside (for now) and continued up the road to the shop because he was on a tight schedule.<br />
<br />
Kyle reached the shop at 5:03pm and he went up to the woman at the register and asked to see the manager. The woman went through the door behind her and soon came back with a man with a tag saying &quot;Manager&quot; on his shirt. Kyle said he wanted to talk in private. The manager agreed to this and took Kyle to his office in the back. Kyle had explained what had happened and that he wanted to keep his body but if he did, it would create a weird situation at home. The man said that he had a life alteration spell where the user can alter its or anyone else&#39;s life to whatever they wish.<br />
<br />
Joey assumed it would be a lot of money so he asked how much. The man said that it was gonna be (British) £120. (American) $148.21.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT&quot; screamed joey at the top of his lungs in his newly deep voice. Joey said that he didn&#39;t have that kind of money right now but he would see what he could do tommorow because he was still on a tight schedule and he had no time to chat any longer.<br />
<br />
 It was now 5:42pm. Joey left the shop and had to run back to his house before his mum got there while trying to ignore to women again. The women in the street were trying even harder to get his attention with winks and such because they thought he was even hotter as he ran. He over came the temptation due to the panic of his mum getting home before him.<br />
<br />
 Kyle finally got to his house and his mums car wasn&#39;t in the drive yet. He ran inside and quickly took of his dad&#39;s clothes so he was once again showing his naked body. Muscular, hairy legs, a strong chest covered with hair, giant genitals that any girl would die to have inside them.<br />
<br />
 He quickly foulded his dad&#39;s clothes and put them back in the draw with the speedo that he left on the floor. As he just finished putting them in the draw his mum began pulling up in the drive way so Kyle ran to his room and grabbed the box. Kyle pressed the red button and he was shot with a red wave of energy on the forehead. The transformation he had previously undergone was reversed and he was thirteen again. <br />
<br />
Kyle quickly grabbed the box again and threw it in his desk draw. He quickly grabbed his own boxers and slipped them back on as his mum came in the front door. Kyle ignored the fact that his boxers were quite baggy after getting them stretched out a bit earlier when first transformed. Kyle grabbed his phone and jumped into bed and put the covers over himself.<br />
<br />
The door opened to his bedroom and his mum stepped in. She asked why Kyle was in bed at 6:00 o&#39;clock and Kyle said that he was just tired as he started playing a game on his phone to look less suspicious. His mum put on a face of disbelief but she decided not to question him and went to get the shopping out of the car.<br />
<br />
Kyle sighed with relief and the day continued as an ordinary day in his house.<br />
<br />
Note from the author: I hope you all have enjoyed the story SO FAR. Yes i am continuing this story to part three. I was gonna Finish the story in this part but I thought that would make this part unessaserily long. I&#39;m gonna work on part three straight away. Stay tuned. Oh and yes, Kyle is going to turn back into a man, I just felt turning him back to a thirteen year old again was nessasery to the plot right now. See you next part.</p>
