<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Having P.E. as the last class of the day may sound like a good idea so you can just go home and shower afterwards... However when you are a stressed out Dragon with your disguise magic being unconsciously used... Well dodgeball may be the wrong activity for you. Being a small target Suzan was able to not be targeted till the later end of the game where there were fewer people to target. They were giving the balls to the more sporty people on the other team so when Suzan was hit the thing hurt a little, and her subconscious let go of the human transformation at the point of impact. The blue scales looked more like a bruise on her mostly human form. Thankfully Megan was nearby and ended up catching the ball before it hit the ground. <br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry Suz you&#39;re not out.&quot; Megan said <br />
&quot;...thanks...&quot; Suzan meekly said &quot;Look Out!&quot; she then shouted out, but sadly her speaking speed was slower than the ball which hit Megan at around the U of out. One by one more people were knocked out till it was basically just Suzan feeling nervous as the teams were not balanced. It was basically 1 v 10 at this point, and the other team were preparing for a firing squad approach. Suzan intimidated knelt down a little and held her arms out as she just made herself an easier target to get pelted with all the balls. Not all of them hit hard, but enough of them did for her subconscious to drop her fleshy arms. As the balls fell away they were able to get a better look at the girl they all pelted. <br />
One guy said &quot;Sorry if you got hur... Can you bruise that fast?!?&quot; people were looking and thinking that those bruises on her arms looked kinda like scales. <br />
Suzan scared looked at her arms and got scared at her blue scales on her forearms &quot;What&#39;s happening!?!&quot; Her completely shaken mental state making the transformation magic unstable made the change back happen slowly. Although it was more obvious as the change made it to her hands and shoulders. It felt horrific watching her fingers fuse into 4 claws. It didn&#39;t hurt, but Suzan was convincing herself this change was hurting and was screaming in shock. Her form was getting significantly larger as the change was spreading to her torso and the start of her face. <br />
The coach was keeping people a decent distance and got two students to get the school nurse and alert the principal. Most of the students were kinda scared as they were watching one of their classmates turn into an emotionally unstable dragon the size of a car. For sure her gym clothes were in tatters, and her cries for help came out as a howling growl. Suzan so used to using her mouth instead of some amount of telepathy. Soon she was able to hear someone else saying something... &quot;Suzan! Are you in there! Are you in there Suz!?!&quot; Suzan was able to snap herself out of her panic a little bit. She looked and saw Megan was a distance away and for sure a bit scared, but she was trying to reach her friend inside this monster. Suzan still panicked calmed herself enough and carefully lowered herself into a laying position. &quot;I&#39;m here... Are you in pain?&quot; Suzan tried saying something, but all that came out were grunts so she just shook her head no. After things calmed down a little bit the nurse and principal came in wondering what was going on, and how badly a dragon could&#39;ve been injured. <br />
The Principal asked &quot;Alright, where is she hurt?&quot;<br />
&quot;Hurt?!? She&#39;s a fucking Dragon!&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes, it&#39;s in her file. I&#39;m trying to figure out where she&#39;s hurt. Must&#39;ve been a lot to make her think she needed to go back into her actual form.&quot; Suzan really surprised tried asking something, but all that came out were her grunts. <br />
&quot;What do you mean it&#39;s in her file?!? I&#39;ve been her friend since forever. I think I would&#39;ve known if she was a Dragon or not!&quot;<br />
&quot;Listen, all I know is that we have her as a dragon in her record. Also our little interview with her caretaker led us to believe she knew she was a dragon.&quot; Suzan just shook her head. The principal didn&#39;t like the situation and when the nurse asked if she was hurt anywhere she could only shake her head no. <br />
<br />
Shawna was just told to come to the school, and by the time she got to the gym she saw that her Suzan was now in her dragon form. &quot;Are you alright Sweetie!?! Come on, go back to your human form and let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; <br />
Megan asked &quot;Shawna?!? You knew she was a dragon?&quot;<br />
Shawna nodded &quot;Yes, I held her egg while she hatched. I watched her change into her human form...&quot; a bit of guilt formed as she understood what happened &quot;She didn&#39;t know she was a dragon?&quot; Suzan shook her large blue head &quot;Well umm... Bit of a short story. You&#39;re mother and father are dragons. I was friends with your mom back when she was human, and when she saw you morph into a human baby with me. Well she thought it&#39;d be better if you were raised more like a human. Sorry, I thought you knew you were a dragon.&quot; The more important part was figuring out how to get Suzan back into her human form. They tried some calming mental exercises, music, and in the end...</p>
