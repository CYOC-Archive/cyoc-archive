<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">John decided to stay and try to explain things... and right about then the door was just a crack open and John realized she was currently slowing the flow of time... &quot;Um... I think I can feel the energy maybe if I-&quot; WHAM!! Very quickly John realized a few things. First based on the imprint the door handle left on the wall yes don&#39;t mess with Mom and she very much did love her very much, and that currently said pissed off mama bear was viewing her as a stranger. <br />
Cindy said with a glare in her eye &quot;Alright missy, where&#39;s my son? I heard him screaming at the top of his lungs and now he&#39;s gone. WHERE IS HE?!?&quot;<br />
John stammered and said &quot;Uh... yeah umm.... I&#39;m here kinda... ever hear of those deals with devils or genies that don&#39;t quite go the way you think?&quot; <br />
Cindy&#39;s eye was picking up parts of her son in this random young woman but still critical said &quot;Do you take me for an idiot why should I believe you?&quot; as she went for her phone in her pocket. <br />
A voice in John&#39;s head said &quot;My my, your mother seems so very stressed. Not even from this latest predicament, but her whole body seems stiff. Why not rewind her body a few years and relieve her aching body a bit?&quot; John sorta thought that made sense in the moment and tried to focus her time energy into her mother, and noticed the color in her hair turning a little more vibrant, The wrinkles she had been trying to fight disappearing, Her rather generously sized breasts shrinking back into her chest... Wait... <br />
Cindy&#39;s squeaky voice came out &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?!?&quot; Luckily for everyone involved as Cindy&#39;s body had been rewound the clothes she had been wearing had shifted to some overalls as Cindy was turned into a little girl. <br />
John said &quot;Sorry, as I was explaining I had gotten some time power from Chronos and didn&#39;t think that much would do... that much?&quot; Cindy looked at her old clothes from her childhood her own mother had thrown away when she had grown too big, the lack of anything that could be called a boob on her chest, she had been regressed to a child, and if the explanation was a god did it... Well she couldn&#39;t think of any other explanation. John continued to try to explain &quot;So Chronos came into my head and offered me time power for helping him with some prayers... and then that did this to me?&quot; <br />
Chronos spoke to John&#39;s mind and said &quot;Yeah... your body wasn&#39;t quite fit to handle the power of time, but for some reason the female form is more suited to it. You can thank Aphrodite for that.&quot; <br />
Little girl Cindy muttered &quot;...Yeah... Now that I&#39;m more calm... I do see you in well... you John... Sorry.&quot; <br />
John sighed and said &quot;No problem, we should probably inform Dolly about this development shouldn&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
&quot;I think so, she should be downstairs in the living room... You&#39;d think she&#39;d have been at least curious enough to come see what was happening.&quot; Cindy and John walked downstairs and saw Dolly was on the couch watching some video... probably having some noise canceling ear buds in her ears. <br />
<br />
For sure Dolly noticed the two unfamiliar figures walking in her peripheral vision, took out her right earbud, and asked &quot;Hey, who the heck are you two? John&#39;s... girlfriend and child?&quot; Holly supposed John might have had a girlfriend, but she was surprised that John was dumb enough to get her pregnant. <br />
John said &quot;Nope, this is mom. I&#39;m John and now I&#39;m some sort of Priestess of Chronos.&quot; Dolly was silent with her stoic face as she tried to detect any hint of a smile on some maybe would be pranksters. Heck maybe the little girl was just this young woman&#39;s sister or something. <br />
Dolly got up and simply stated &quot;...Sorry this is a little too hard for me to believe. If you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot; <br />
&quot;Freeze little miss!&quot; John stated as her magic started to make Holly shrink younger. Seeing her now little sister&#39;s confused expression on her youthening face John explained &quot;Just a little proof to show I&#39;m not lying about the whole Chronos thing.&quot; <br />
Dolly however was panicking on the inside and yelled &quot;Turn Me BACK!&quot; <br />
John was kind of enjoying herself now as Dolly was actually acknowledging her existence and said &quot;Come on, your in safe hand. Do you believe that I&#39;m John now?&quot; <br />
Cindy said &quot;Now John, stop teasing your sister!&quot; <br />
Dolly thinking asked &quot;So... is that mom?&quot; Cindy nodded and then dolly continued &quot;...I guess I kind of believe you... Can you turn me back to normal?&quot; <br />
Cindy pouted and said &quot;Aw... Couldn&#39;t we stay like this for a little bit and play some board games like we used to when you were a kid?&quot; Then turned to John with an excited gleam in her eyes and said &quot;Ooo Can you turn yourself into a little girl as well?!? We can make this a sleep over! I&#39;ll get the jump rope an-&quot; <br />
John frowned a bit and said &quot;Um... Jump rope in the house mom?&quot; <br />
Cindy tried calming herself down and then said &quot;...Yeah... got a little too carried away though, but could we play some board games at least!?! Come OOOONNNN!!! Let&#39;s have some family fun for once in a decade!&quot; John not used to the whole Chronos magic thing forgot to age either of them back up, and ended up being the girl to bring out all the juice, soda, snacks, and games. It was a fun night, but in the end John was left with two little girls that was once hyped up on caffeine and sugar that crashed hard falling to sleep. She brought them both to their own rooms before returning to her own room... Odd in all the confusion John had forgotten to take care of the levitating controller... Wait that was Chronos&#39; thing... Maybe she could? Thump! Yep John could return things to an unfrozen state... It was late though and out of habit John started to strip to her boxers and jump in bed... except yeah they weren&#39;t boxers they were... a bra and panties. Black with some white frills, containing a lot of some female naughty bits... The guy in John was dead as John reacted to seeing her DD breasts as if she&#39;d seen them a thousand times before. They were her breasts after all... Taking a quick glance into her closet she found the rest of her clothes hadn&#39;t changed with her... Figures... Whatever a problem for future John. John turned off the lights to get some sleep. In the middle of the night John&#39;s door opened quietly this time and a little girl tip toed to the only technically adult in the building. <br />
Cindy asked &quot;...I know it.... sounds childish but... I had a nightmare and... could I sleep with you?&quot; <br />
John half asleep muttered &quot;...sur...&quot; at which Cindy snuggled in still clothed in her overalls. &quot;...stop... their sensitive...&quot; John muttered. <br />
Cindy chuckled &quot;but their so warm, squishy, and considering our placement it&#39;s hard for me to-&quot; <br />
John yawned and muttered half asleep &quot;I&#39;ll deal with it.&quot; When the two woke up...</p>
