<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I wish all of us would go back to the way we were before we started this dumb game.&quot; Emily announced, speaking clearly. <br />
<br />
It was like a wind being swept through the room, all four of them felt something powerful rush through the room. <br />
<br />
Emily felt it first, she felt her body changing and stretching, but it didn&#39;t hurt. Her cat ears shrunk down into her head, returning to normal human girl ears. The tail coming from her ass receded back into her spine, eventually passing into nothing. Then she felt herself getting taller, her mind getting older. Her bones shifted as her hips widened and her thighs gained some plump definition, her ass curved out, and her feet got bigger.<br />
<br />
All she had left on her was her shirt, which had previously been oversized and baggy, but was now being filled out by not only her size, but her breasts as they gradually swelled to their original size. What had taken her almost a year in her childhood, she accomplished in roughly five seconds as her cups flew past A, B, C and all the way to her proud D that she had come to loathe. But now as she saw them fill out her shirt and her nipples press against the fabric, she had never been happier to be so blessed with the biggest tits in her friend group, she would never complain about bras again. Her exposed pussy widened and stretched to match her mature hips. She happily hugged her breasts as her hair grew to its full length.<br />
<br />
Samantha gasped in a lungful of air, something she hadn&#39;t even realized she wasn&#39;t doing in. She felt inside her organs returning and operating to their functions, her slimy transparent skin began to solidify and return to its original color her appendages once again became defined limbs, she counted as each of her fingers reformed itself. She watched in sadness as her self inflated breasts returned to their normal size, but still she was happy to be normal again.  Her head and face returned to normal, crafting and twisting out of the slime, her long brown hair sprang from her scalp, returning to its full length. She shuddered as her pussy reformed and the magical gust of air blew across it, her clothes were still on the floor, but she didn&#39;t even care. She was happy to show of she was human again.<br />
<br />
Tracy sucked in as he felt a pressure against his cock, he felt it gradually release pressure against his pants and panties, and pulled back the hem to watch the once sizable cock pull into his crotch, along with that gross ball sack that had started this for her. She watched in delight as a small slit formed between her legs, surrounding itself with thick pussy lips, and inside she felt something press against her intestines, her uterus was back. <br />
<br />
She closed her eyes in bliss as her frame began to become smaller, the defined muscles fading away and the coarse body hair going back beneath her skin. She winced only a little as her two extra arms shrunk back into her sides and her torso went back to normal size. She watched with a smile as her pecs gained definition and soon a rounded shape, inflating to her proud and happy c-cups. She ran her hands through her hair as it changed back to her beautiful blonde and grew out past her shoulders and down to the small of her back. <br />
<br />
Finally Sandra felt confident to stand up, knowing she wouldn&#39;t be sitting back down on that horse ass ever again. She stretched her back as the disgustingly large wings shrunk down and almost folded back into her body. Sandra gave a smile as her fangs and sharp teeth returned to normal human chompers. She held out her hands and watched as her claws returned to fingernails. She felt a twitch on her head and patted her ears as they shrunk down and came back to the sides of her head, where they belonged. She felt a tickle on her tail, and looked behind to see it all recede into her rump.<br />
<br />
Now she watched excitedly, as her massive lower half began to reduce in size rapidly, her own body shrinking down to her original height. Her back legs began to raise off the ground, as they were pulled back into her bum. The horse rear pressed itself against Sandra and eventually returned to the normal curve of her bum, her pussy returned to its rightful place between her legs, still just a little wet from the memory of what Tracy was packing. She watched as her legs returned to their normal pale fleshiness, she may have just been a pale ginger, but it was better than being a freak of nature any day. Besides, boys loved gingers. <br />
<br />
She felt a tension in her stomach and looked down as her second set of breasts began to flatten themselves against her belly, eventually becoming pinpricks, then nothing. Just her two breasts she&#39;d had since the 6th grade. She knew boys liked those.<br />
<br />
The girls all looked at each other, in their various states of undress, it was an odd sight without knowing what had happened, but they all knew. And they would never forget. They all came together in a hug, they cried and laughed and cheered and whooped. None of them failed to notice how hot the room had gotten from their rapid transformations, they had created a lot of heat energy, but they didn&#39;t care. They especially didn&#39;t care that in their hug, they kicked the game board and tossed it aside, messing up the stack of cards and throwing the pieces.<br />
<br />
However, when Samantha happened to glance down, she noticed something odd. All the cards were scattered, but only one of them had anything written on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Guys look. All the cards are blank.&quot; Samantha pointed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh who cares? Keep that awful thing away from me.&quot; Sandra turned away.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, she&#39;s right. Do you thing they were always like that? Blank the whole time? Only filling in when we drew a card?&quot; Tracy investigated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t like that thought. Everything that happened today? That would be the weirdest.&quot; Samantha said with a shudder.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s the last one say?&quot; Asked Tracy, pointing at the only card with words on it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t read it!&quot; Sandra sputtered, &quot;Do you want to start this all over again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I think it&#39;s ok.&quot; Said Emily, picking up the card, her tits swung inside her shirt as she leaned over. &quot;You&#39;ve beaten my game / I wish you could stay / but the alas the game is yours / to keep or throw away. Hell no we&#39;re not keeping this shit!&quot; She threw the card.<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Sandra exclaimed.<br />
<br />
But Samantha frowned, &quot;Well, hold on guys. Think about it. It only messes with us if we choose to play it. And we&#39;ve just seen that the wish works perfectly. It could be fun to keep.&quot; She reasoned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing about that was fun.&quot; Tracy insisted<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree, being a little girl isn&#39;t as fun as it looks.&quot; Emily argued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, you remember how it messed with your mind, maybe next time it won&#39;t go as smoothly.&quot; Said Sandra. &quot;If you could even call that smooth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just saying, maybe it could be fun to keep. We can keep it at my place. You&#39;ll never even have to think about it unless you want to.&quot; Samantha was almost pleading.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it&#39;s not up for debate.&quot; Tracy said firmly. &quot;The game&#39;s too dangerous. C&#39;mon girls, let&#39;s get dressed and take it back to that creepy guy&#39;s store.&quot;</p>
