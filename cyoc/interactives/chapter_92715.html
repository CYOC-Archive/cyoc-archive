<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff look Inanimate section and the variety of vehicles he wanted to choose.  Any of them would be good, but he wanted to find one that would be perfect for him to change into.  Looking through his options, he remembered something that he liked the most.<br />
<br />
Recently, there were news of video drones going around towns and cities, most likely interfering with airline traffic and disrupting the rules and regulations.  Despite those negative claims, the video drones are really fun to play with.  The way you let it fly around wherever you want and the thrill of it makes it all so exciting.  Jeff always wish to have one of those drones, that way he can fly them to wherever he wants.  The problem is that the video drones are so expansive and he doesn’t have that type of money to afford it.  But looking at the Chronivac, an idea came to his head.  If he can’t get a drone, why not become one?  This would give him a chance on what it feels like flying around and taking pictures and video.  Could be a very memorable moment for him.<br />
<br />
Getting back to his computer, he checked to see if he could find the one he was looking for what he wants.  Looking to the list, he spotted the one choice, and that choice is ‘Video Drone’.  Smiling to himself, he clicked on it and wanted to see what it can do.  But the moment he clicked on it, there were multiple options and drop down lists scattered about.  Looking at this, Jeff was very confused.  That’s when he remembers that there need to be choices before he can start the change.  So giving that, he decided to look through his options.<br />
<br />
The first was the mental changes, to see if his memories would remain intact.  This is something he was scratching his head on.  It would seem that not only you would change physically, but mentally as well.  He thought of his options and decided on mental change on.  Giving what he wanted to be, he needs to be sure that the changes work physically and mentally.  Choosing the on option, he proceeds to the next one.  The next one is if he would be aware of the changes.  His guess is that even after the change, he can either be aware or not of the changes that’s happening around him, even if he forgot his human life.  Curious, he chooses the on aware option.  Even if he’s going to be an inanimate object with no memory of human life, at least he could experience what is like to be a drone.  Next option, changing reality.  Jeff looked at it and knew what it means.  Once he changes, this option can let him change his reality or not.  Seems like an interesting option.  And since he’s going to change, it’s going to be a matter of time for his family finding out that he’s missing and a lone drone was in the room.  Thinking of this, he decided to have the Reality Altering option on so that his family wouldn’t suspect a thing.  Next is the duration of change as he can type down how long will the change take.  I could be seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years.  The sky is pretty much a limit.  Jeff pondered about this one, as it’s difficult to decide.  He doesn’t want to do it too long or too short.  Coming up with a good option, he typed down ten minutes, the time of the change that’s just about right.  Finally, he moved to the last option, that option is how long will he remain as a drone for.  Once again, there were options on how long that would last, for seconds to years and Jeff is conflicted.  He can’t decided on what to do with how long this would take, giving that he has school and family to take care of.  He could even see an option to make the change permanent, as he could be a drone for the rest of his life.  That’s the one thing he doesn’t want.  Being stuck as a drone for the rest of his life isn’t a picnic.  Going through his options, he came up with a good one.  See, he started spring break just for today and he has a full week to kill.  If there’s anyway to spend it, it’s as a drone flying around, right?  So knowing about this, he set the time of the change to 11 days, for one week and two weekends.<br />
<br />
Once he was finished with his option, he made a quick skim and was pleased with what he got.  Spending an entire week as a video drone is the perfect opportunity in experiencing life in a different perspective.  But as he was thinking about that, he also wondered if he would remember any of it after his week is over.  Not to mention if he turns into a drone, what he would actually see.  But the only way he could see for himself is to really become a drone.  Moving the arrow down to the ‘Start’ button, he pressed it to start the change.  Just as he pressed it, a warning message appeared saying…<br />
<br />
‘Attention!<br />
<br />
You are about to transform into a vehicle of your choosing.  By selecting these options, you are responsible for your well-being.  If you are damaged during the duration of the changed vehicle (Such as a scratch, dent, or completely mangled) you cannot return to your normal self.  The Chronivac isn’t responsible for any damage on yourself.  Do you really want to continue?’<br />
<br />
Below it is a ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ option.  Jeff’s guess is that the program wants him to decide on whether or not he wants to change his mind and go back or continue with the change.  Reading the message, he said to himself, “Are you kidding me?  Hell yeah I want to continue!  I always want to see what it’s like to be a drone.  Besides, it’s just for a week.  It’s not like I’m going to be heavily damaged or anything.”  So taking this risk, he clicked on the ‘Yes’ button and another message appeared with a timer below it that said…<br />
<br />
‘Thank you for choosing the Chronivac 4.0.  Enjoy your change.’<br />
<br />
The timer then started from ten and immediately counted down by the seconds.  The moment it started, Jeff could feel a tingle spreading from head to toe.  He knew that the change was starting and got off his chair to approach his mirror to see the changes himself.  So far, he noticed nothing yet as he thought that maybe the program is either broken or a rip off.  But as he kept starring, something strange happened.<br />
<br />
Taking a closer look, he noticed that his shirt was forming a hole and it grew to reveal his skin.  But his shirt isn’t the only thing that was being tired.  His blue jeans started to rip at the bottom hem and it was showing his legs while his socks were being ripped at the top. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but it looks like something was stripping him and getting him naked.  He starred at this in astonishment as his clothing was revealing more and more skin until there was no clothes left.  He then notice his boxers, which was his only clothes left, was starting to rip from top to bottom and was getting close to his privates.  Jeff started to panic as he tried to cover himself up.  But oddly enough, he couldn’t move.  It’s almost like he was turned into a living statue.  Only his eyes is the only thing that can move as he watched helplessly as the last of the thread vanished, leaving his penis exposed.  Soon enough, he was completely naked and he couldn’t move an inch.  It was strange for him, but at the same time unique.  He believes that it was suppose to be part of the change, giving that he was naked and immobile.  Jeff started to wonder what other changes would happen next.  Starring at the mirror, he could see the next stage of the change.<br />
<br />
An itching sensation started on his scalp as his short and messy hair was shrinking up his head.  He watched in fascination as his hair continues to shrink from short hair, to a buzz cut, all to way to a complete baldhead.  He couldn’t help but to laugh at the sight of his cube balled head, as it looked completely comical on him.  He then noticed the rest of his body changing a bit as well.  The hair on his chest, arms, legs, and privates shrank into his skin until his skin was completely smooth with zero course hairs.  The blemishes on his skin faded out of existence, as there were no deformities anywhere.  His finger and toenails absorbed into his skin and vanished away.  His navel started to fill in sealed itself on his stomach.  His nipples shrank away as well as they left his chest nipple less.  He can feel his ass crack sealing itself up, leaving his rear without an opening.  Starring at himself in the mirror, Jeff could tell that these changes were a little freaky.  But being that he’s being turned into a video drone, it interests him to see what will happen next.<br />
<br />
Looking downward with just his eyes, he could see his penis is starting to get erect when he doesn’t feel aroused in any way.  Almost like it was acting all by itself.  Suddenly, he could feel an invisible force trying to pull hit dick.  In a matter of seconds, his privates were yanked off and fell to the floor still erect.  He then looked to where his privates were and saw a smooth surface on his crotch.  Looking back to his dick, he wondered why it got detached from his body, that’s when he saw it changed as well.  First, the skin of his balls grew darker until it was solid black and shaped and flatten into a rectangular shape.  Two big sticks then appeared on the left and right while multiple buttons grew in the middle and a switch on the bottom.  His shaft started to grow long and thin as the hole on the tip sealed and the mushroom head compressed.  The skin of it lightened to a silvery color and started to get all shiny.  Once the changes are completed, Jeff’s dick and balls have turned into a remote control used to pilot something, mostly a drone he’s going to turn into.  Jeff looked at that and was amazed by what had happened to his private parts.  It was so surreal for him to see his dick changed, but it meant that he was halfway in turning into what he wanted to be.  He even wondered what changes will happen next.<br />
<br />
That was when he got his answer as his arms started to tingle.  Looking into the mirror, he could see that his arms were lifting up on their own accord and then stopping in an upper diagonal position.  It was then that the changes started to take place.  His first four fingers started to drew closer together and bended in two separate directions.  The four fingers then merged into two appendages and flatten while the peach color darkened to solid black, creating propellers.  His thumbs then moved all the way down to his palms and extended a little longer, hardening and darkening into a pair of stands.  His own hands in a way grew smaller and smaller until they’re none existent and blackened as well, leaving nothing but a thin stump in between the propeller and stand.  The top of his arms began to compress while the ones connected to his shoulders grew a large mass, shaping into a curve triangle shape while the color went to black as well.  Seeing them, he could tell that his hands and arms turned into the first half of the mechanics to make him fly.  Jeff tried to move them, but they were completely stationary, almost like they don’t want to be moved.  It was so alien to him, yet as the same time it was very comforting.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he could feel his feet and legs tingling as they spread out to the same height as of his former arms.  Peering his eyes all the way down, he could see his four tiny toes on each foot merged, extended, and thinned while his bigger toes migrated to the back of his heels and grew and hardened.  Forming the other side of the drone’s propellers and stand, his feet grew smaller as he nearly lost his balance.  Trying to fight off the lot of footing, he lost the battle and feel backwards on his back.  Luckily the stands that were created prevented him from suffering a concision and broken back and he was lying like that with newly formed arms and legs sticking out.  He wanted to get up to see the progress, but he was frozen as a statue, using his eyes to see what has transpired.  Too bad that he’s looking at the ceiling, but that doesn’t mean that he could feel the changes continuing.  His knees and legs are change just like his arms, as it got thin on the former feet and fattening at the base to create the same black like structure as the top part.  Now his arms and legs have become the set of wings and propellers for the drone.<br />
<br />
As the changes finished there, other types of changes were taking place as Jeff could feel his body compressing and bloating.  That type of change caused his newly created propeller arms to draw closer together as his body is getting into its distinctive shape of that of an actual drone.  The body type of unrecognizably human while his skin color darkened into the black paint as the rest of his body.  His insides shifted around as they all turned into motors and circuits to operate his new form.  He even grew smaller to the actual size of a drone with a human head on the side.  Jeff really wanted to see how much he has changed, but due to his immobile new body, it was impossible to view it.<br />
<br />
Just as he was thinking about it, he felt a shiver in his head as the last of the changes happened.  He felt an invisible force pushing his head as he bent downward and migrated to the bottom middle of his newly formed body.  Stopping there, he could see himself in the mirror again and looked hysterical with his human head in his drone like body.  But then, he could see changes more in detail.  Parts of his head started to disappear bit by bit.  His ears grew smaller and smaller and merged into his head as the holes filled in, leaving him completely deaf.  His nose smoothed over and had two more holes filled up where he would breath.  Still, he was alive for some reason as the Chronivac is keeping him like that.  Then his mouth zipped up by itself and the lips flattened up, making him unable to speak.  Now all that’s left were his eyes as he looked at his featureless face to see what happens next.  That’s when he notices his eyes drawing closer together until they merged into one eye.  He was almost like a creepy looking Cyclops.  His they then started to grow big as the while surface of the eyeball dissolved away, leaving nothing but blackness.  His iris shifted and crystallized, looking a lot like a camera lens.  His head entirely shifted around completely and compressed smaller, turning into a black rotating camera that can more and record in any direction.  His brain then formed into a highly advance microchip as all of his human memories disappeared in the change.  Though he forgot who he is and his human life, he was still aware of the changes.<br />
<br />
After nearly ten minutes, Jeff went from being a teenage boy to a non-living video drone sitting in his room.  The room then shifted around as the reality changes started.  Everything became a complete and utter blur as everything swirled around him.  Soon as it was over, he was in a dusty garage of a random house in a random place.  The former Jeff was excited as he’s going to be a video drone for Spring break.  He can’t wait to see who’s going to come and play with him.  Just then, the garage door opened up and someone was coming in.  That someone is…</p>
