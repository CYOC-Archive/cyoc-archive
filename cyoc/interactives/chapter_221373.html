<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle heard his mother leave for work, and gathered the courage to go downstairs to the living room. He walked as best he could, but it was more of a waddle, gingerly going down the stairs, he reached the bottom step when he felt his cock lurch again, growing three more inches, and drooping even more at thirty four inches, he was nearly three feet long. All of this growing was leaving him horny and hungry, ignoring his sickening lust he made his way over to the kitchen to make some breakfast. <br />
<br />
It was now eight in the morning and as he made breakfast he grumbled to himself about how stupid he was for calling Jarred. &quot;I should have just called someone else. Not that I know anyone else.&quot; Kyle had made a lot of enemies with his attitude, any of them would have made it worse. &quot;Should have just kept the curse to myself.&quot; Kyle made his way around the kitchen as best he could, his massive cock bumping into things, shoving the chairs around, and pressing itself against the oven as he tried to cook. Kyle was not a tall man, only coming in at 5&#39;2&quot;, he tried not to do the math of just how much more he had to grow. Having managed to make scrambled eggs and bacon, he sat down to eat at the table, and a new problem made itself apparent, his balls sat on the floor, and lifted his cock, banging it against the bottom of the table. &quot;FUCKING COCK! I WISH YOU WOULD JUST FALL OFF, I&#39;D BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU!&quot; Kyle punched his cock and winced in pain.  Now pissed off, and in a miner amount of pain, he hastily ate his meal, practically shoveling the food into his mouth, he finished breakfast. Just as he was about to get up he glanced at the clock and saw it turn to nine, he felt his cock expand further, and felt as it&#39;s tip land on the chair opposite of him and even shove the chair a little. <br />
<br />
He groaned, he was being tortured by the need to release, but by now it became nothing but a dull ache to him, but to know his cock needed it&#39;s own chair to rest it&#39;s tip on was much more frustrating. He pushed his chair back, and maneuvered his package around and from under the table. This was going to be a long day.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
Kyle spent most of his day sitting in the living room, watching t.v. and trying to distract himself from his ever growing dog cock. By three he had reached fifty five inches, four and a half feet long, and nearly two feet thick. He tried to shift himself around during the day to keep his cock out of the way, but with each growth it took up more of his view, sitting on the couch allowed it to raise to an angle. Giving up on the couch he finally gave in, and got up, the weight of his increased size, very apparent, and maneuvered himself to sit on his now beach ball sized balls. It was at this moment, his legs resting over his balls, testicles behind him like a seat, and massive cock pressing against the floor he was struck by the size of this cock. And a sense of dread hit him, how big was this really going to be?<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
It was seven, when his mother came back home and he had grown another foot by now, he had watched, no longer in fear but defeat as it had lurched it&#39;s tip closer to the t.v.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi honey, I&#39;m glad to see you&#39;re feeling better, I got pizza, don&#39;t try to get up, I know how hard it is for you when you get, well, hard.&quot; She smiled at her joke. And for some reason Kyle laughed at that a little, they spent the evening together, eating pizza, which he packed away two whole supremes by himself, which figured, he was a growing boy after all. By the time his mother went to bed at eleven, he grew another foot, and he just couldn&#39;t find it in him to care anymore, but he was still horny as hell. Finally he decided to go to sleep, no use in trying to move, his cock was too large to fit through the hall, he just lay forward and rested on his monster and went to sleep.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Kyle slept soundly, and woke up to sunlight. What was weird was he had fallen asleep in the living room, and the way he was looking was actually a solid wall, he was looking out the window and directly at his house. Groggily he sat up and through bleary eyes looked in front of him, then let out a loud and blood curdling scream. In front of him was his now eight foot and three inches dog cock, it&#39;s girth now a monstrous three feet thick, it filled most of what looked to be a single room guest house, it&#39;s tip nearly touching the opposite wall. He scrambled to get off of the cock only to find his back against something large, warm and furry, he looked back and let out another scream, his balls now pressed against the wall behind him sat behind him like a couch, filling the back of the room. His cock started to pulse with hunger and he found himself shuddering and gagging as he was overwhelmed with lust. There was no way he could move like this, Jarred had sentenced him to hell, and Kyle was now the frightened owner of the worlds largest dog cock.<br />
<br />
Kyle spent the rest of his day moaning and crying as he tried time and again get his monster to cum the get some relief, having forgotten that he wouldn&#39;t be able to until midnight. His mother had come out to clean him, the soap and hose made it even worse, edging him closer but never close enough. His mother seemed not to notice his suffering, even helping him to eat because of his state, morning turned to afternoon, then night and he sat there, trying not to move and make the hunger worse. <br />
<br />
Finally, he got used to the lust, and through a daze looked up at the clock on the wall, it turned to midnight, and Kyle felt something new. A heat started building in the base of his cock and Kyle moaned pleading for it to stop as his cock finally exploded. Cum flowed out of the tip like a fire hose, he rolled his eyes into the back of his head as he cam for what seemed like hours, torrent after torrent of cum, one after another leaving mere minutes in between them. Kyle passed out as his cock unloaded a full three days worth of frustration, the cum emptying into a gutter on the other side of the room, this building was seemingly built with this cock in mind. Finally, after an hour, the cock cam it&#39;s last and calmed down.<br />
<br />
Kyle woke up in the morning in a state of bliss, the lustful hunger was gone, but the cock was still here, it&#39;s mass still laying in a softened state on the floor, it had retracted to a four foot length, but barely fit in it&#39;s sheath. Kyle groaned, and took stock of where he was.</p>
