<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jessica got up from the desk after hanging up the phone. “You know, you&#39;re lucky Jen. You get to live one of my wildest fantasies in my body.” She started to stretch, touching her toes. “This will probably be the last time you can do this properly, take it in, because I know that there&#39;s a cosmetic surgeon&#39;s office almost within two miles of here.” Jen started so panic inside of her head. “Maybe you&#39;ll get lucky, maybe you won&#39;t, we&#39;ll have to see, but hey, I know you&#39;ll love being a big titted bimbo like me. Oh wait, you are me now! You are a big titted bimbo! And your about to get a lot more.” She sat her old body on the bed. “Now if I were you,” She said looking at her reflection, “I&#39;d sit here just in case. Don&#39;t want to fall on your new tits now do you? Goodbye Jen. I wish you had been a better daughter.”<br />
<br />
Jessica left her body as she felt her breasts start to swell, Jen gasped as the oppressive spirit let go of her and stared at her expanding bust. “Please be wrong.” Jen whimpered. “I don&#39;t what huge tits.” She watched as the saline from one set after another transferred into her chest. Six times her bust expanded, it&#39;s content reaching 2,000 ccs from the neighbors alone, the curse looked through the neighborhood and reached the clinic.<br />
<br />
Jen assumed that she was done and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that she was done growing Jen relaxed, laughing to herself as she thought her mother&#39;s curse was over. The clinic was slightly within two mile radius, enough that part of the building was in the circle, and that part was the storage room, where they stored any implants for operations. There were twelve sets of 400cc implants, they kept the most common ones there, and saline bags ready for operations, there were fourteen of those, each with 1000ccs of solution, standard for an IV bag. The curse snatched these, the last of what Jen would get, but it was a lot to have.<br />
<br />
Jen felt her breasts bump up again, she looked wide eyed as she realized what was happening and froze, fearing what was coming to her, her breasts expanded bit by bit, twelve times they bumped up, finishing at a massive size, her breasts now the size of volley balls they rested on her chest, she had thought the changes were done when they started to swell rapidly, loud squeaking sound came from the implants as a trickle turned into a torrent, her bust started filling her lap as she started to scream. The breasts swelled, well past the record sizes from the biggest fetish models, zipping past the size of basketballs, her breasts now spilling over the sides of her lap, and nearly touching her knees she started to cry, her father started banging at the door.<br />
<br />
Just as the implants reached their final size, filled with an astounding 20 liters of saline, her father kicked open the locked door, and froze, seeing his daughter&#39;s middle aged body with tits the size of yoga balls was a sight to behold. She was crying as the next change happened, her breasts were lifted by some invisible force, as if a massive bra were clad around them, the breasts struggled for room on her frame as the last change was made. Her tits sat proudly on her chest, two mammoth mammaries, round and proud, seemingly light as air were now glued to her chest.<br />
<br />
From Jen&#39;s point of view they were were everywhere, the invisible bra had lifted them like a push up bra, their size and fullness made them nearly spherical, Jen was too distraught to take them in and looked over her tits to her parents. “HELP ME! PLEASE HELP!” Their faces filled with shock and horror shifted as the last part of the curse kicked in, they looked at her with wonder and pride, smiling widely. <br />
<br />
“Oh honey!” Her mother cried. “I&#39;m so proud of you! Look at you taking this burden on yourself!”<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s my girl! Always thinking of others.”<br />
<br />
“WHAT?” She cried. “YOU THINK I WOULD JUST DO THIS?”<br />
<br />
“Yeah! Just the other day we were talking about it. All these bimbos in this neighborhood, thinking they need implants to look pretty.” Her dad said.<br />
<br />
“Someone should do something about it!” Her mother said. “That&#39;s what I said, and look at you! Being a trooper!” She walked over and hugged her daughter from the side. “Oh I knew you&#39;d do something, but I thought you&#39;d just tell them they were wrong, and try and give them confidence, but instead...” She caressed the side of her right tit. “You just took their implants! And stopped the clinic from selling more! Good Job!” She got up.<br />
<br />
“Our daughter, always the saint, well, now we know what that noise was! Goodnight honey, we&#39;re proud of you, get some rest you deserve it.” They shut the door and walked back down the hall and left a distraught and confused Jen sitting there with her massive tits. She wept, trying not to look at her tits, but they were everywhere in front of her, she finally wiped her eyes with effort, having to reach around her bust to get to her face. She took in her new permanent view. Breasts should sag, even implants, but her invisible support was tight, making them round but still squishy. The spheres sitting on her chest were lifted by her invisible bra, making their shape very apparent, as if she were just holding two yoga balls to her chest, but the squished together in middle, making a valley, no canyon of cleavage, the center split in a curved V shape as the slopes reached the top of her tits. The peaks sat at nearly eye level, filling half of her field of vision with her absurd bust. <br />
<br />
“Please... could... could you just lower them so I can see.” She whimpered to no one, but in response her support was loosened, letting her breath easier and lowering her breasts, letting them rest in a more &#39;natural&#39; shape. “Say when.” Whispered a voice in the back of her head, she looked forward as the breasts lowered, still very prominent in her view as they would always be. She waited, going by feel rather than view, finally okay with the support she muttered. “When.... thank you.” <br />
<br />
“No problem.” The voice whispered.<br />
<br />
“Now I&#39;m hearing things too.”<br />
<br />
“No...” the voice coughed a little, a British woman&#39;s voice spoke to her. “Look love, do you really think an &#39;invisible bra&#39; is a thing? The curse made me for you.”<br />
<br />
“What...”<br />
<br />
“Nanites honey, little tiny robots, a new companion for you. No one will think your crazy for talking out loud to me, just tell them it&#39;s your nanite bra and they&#39;ll be okay with it... very nice breasts you have now.”<br />
<br />
“No there not.” She shivered.<br />
<br />
“Maybe you should sleep a little, I suggest you just lay on your back.”<br />
<br />
“With these?” She grumbled.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I&#39;ll keep them from falling on your face love. I&#39;ll even make some white noise for you to get comfortable with.”<br />
<br />
Jen reluctantly lay on her back, trying to get some covers on her bust as it spread out due to gravity. She sighed, knowing that no one would help her out of this, and tried to get some sleep.<br />
<br />
The next morning Kyle and Kelly were watching tv when an ad for the local news came on.<br />
<br />
“Breaking News, see how this local girl took on superficial beauty with an ultimate sacrifice, her implants are now a record breaking 20,000 ccs!” It showed Jen shyly trying to not look at the camera with enormous naked breasts. “More this morning at 11.”<br />
<br />
Kelly looked over at Kyle, who looked shocked and then looked at her. “You owe me a blow job.”<br />
<br />
“We should go see Jen.”<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, now as for that blow job.&quot; Kelly purred.</p>
