<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">By the time Erika woke up her mother had already left for work meaning that she could relax and not worry about hiding her tail.<br />
<br />
The first thing she did was make sure that it had not been all a dream, for now it seemed impossible to think that she had randomly grown a tail. It hadn't been a dream though, a quick flick of her tail revealed that it was still there and now nearly as long as she was tall and almost as big around as her wrist at the base.<br />
<br />
Her next concern was getting dressed. She couldn't wear a skirt since her tail would push it up, nor did she want to wear pants which would leave her unable to move her tail. <br />
<br />
A few moments of brainstorming and she had a plan. Somewhere in her closet she was pretty sure that she had some old clothing that she had either outgrown or damaged and hadn't thrown out yet. Sure enough, she was able to find what she was looking for in an old shopping bag, hidden by her winter blankets and a box of old stuffed animals. In with the too small shirts was a pair of pants she had ripped the knees of last winter. The pants were beyond repair, but they still fit her.<br />
<br />
Some quick scissor work later and she had cut a tail hole in the pants and was able to get dressed.<br />
<br />
While she dressed she tried to think back over what happened yesterday to try and figure out if something had caused her to grow a tail or if it had just happened at random. Mentally she replayed everything she had done the previous day. Everything had been the same as always  until she got to the walk home from school where she found the strange spray bottle. Could that have caused her change? There was only one way to find out.<br />
<br />
She went over to her desk and took the bottle off it, turning it over in her hands as she tried to figure out where to spray herself. She really wanted to try, but she also didn't want to put it on any place that would be visible, just in case it really was what had caused her to grow a tail.<br />
<br />
Looking down at her feet she found inspiration. <br />
<br />
Two quick squeezes later and she had sprayed both her feet with the strange substance. Now all there was left to do was wait and see.<br />
<br />
In the mean time she decided to get something to eat.<br />
<br />
It was just as she was finishing her bowl of cereal that she began to feel a sensation of warmth on her feet.<br />
<br />
She put her bowl in the sink and went to the living room to sit down on the sofa to get a closer look at her feet.<br />
<br />
There didn't seem to be anything different about them, but she wasn't sure what she was looking for to begin with. Maybe the only reason she was feeling anything was because she was hoping to.<br />
<br />
Disappointed, she wiggled her toes, hoping to find some hint of change that she might have missed.<br />
<br />
Still nothing.<br />
<br />
It figured that her tail was a one time deal and that no more amazing changes would take place. At least she still had her tail.<br />
<br />
Like the previous night, she used her tail as much as she could while washing up.<br />
<br />
Her foot itched as she was walking back to her room, and absentmindedly she rubbed her other foot against it to scratch it, only to make a wonderful discovery. She could feel fur growing in on the top of her feet.<br />
<br />
Closer examination showed that it was the same shade of brown as on her tail. Even more interesting was that her toes looked a little longer. That was even more interesting than the fur.<br />
<br />
She wiggled and flexed her toes, finding that in addition to being longer, they were more dexterous. In fact, they reminded her of monkey paws.<br />
<br />
Was the spray making her like a monkey wherever she used it? Again she was tempted to use it, but she decided against it. First she wanted the changes to her feet to finish.<br />
<br />
Now that the changes had started, they seemed to progress much faster, but that might have been because she knew what to look for now.<br />
<br />
It took about an hour for her toes to double in length before she got bored with waiting and decided to finish her homework.<br />
<br />
By the time she was done with the reading she needed to do her big toes were starting to look more like thumbs.<br />
<br />
Curious about just how much more flexible her toes had become she dropped her book to the floor and used her feet to pick it up. Getting the book opened to the last page she had read was a bit more difficult, but after only three tries she managed to do it.<br />
<br />
Next she decided to see just how much she could do. She went over to her desk, got her diary and a pencil, sat down on her bed and tried to figure out how to sit down to use her feet to write.<br />
<br />
After a few sloppy scribbles, she had the knack of it, and maybe also because her toes were getting even more like monkey paws. Soon her writing with her feet was just as neat as what she could manage with her hands and she spent most of the afternoon writing about her changes and what she might want to try. The biggest desire of hers at the moment was to try and climb a tree.<br />
<br />
When she was done writing, the changes to her feet were done as well, leaving her with prefect monkey feet, hairy on the tops up to her ankles and with dark brown toes that looked nearly identical to her hands.</p>
