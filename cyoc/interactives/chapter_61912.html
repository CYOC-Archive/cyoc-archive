<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The new Chad found that he liked sliding his new dong down Alan's throat. Holding him by the back of the head <br />
while his throat got use to the size of his cock. Not the biggest thing but it was a nice size. As a matter of <br />
fact it wasn't even as big as his old one. But damn did it feel good going down his old throat and the balls <br />
shot load after load. So much more than he was able to do in his old body.<br />
<br />
As Chad thrust his new cock down Alan's throat he would hold his head close so that Alan couldn't remove it <br />
and would start to gag. Chad enjoyed the spasm that massaged his cock into stimulation. Holding Alan there <br />
till he looked like he was going to pass out before he loosened his hold made Alan more use to keeping a cock <br />
down.<br />
<br />
When Chad got done with using the old Chad in the new Alan body Alan collapsed on the floor. His jaw looking <br />
like it was in a permanent O. A line of cum dibbled out the side of his mouth when he felt himself begin to <br />
float from the cold hard floor.<br />
<br />
He saw someone handing his old body a wad of cash as he floated out the door and into the back of a big black <br />
Hummer.<br />
<br />
As he laid on the floor in the back of the Hummer he listened to the people that put him in the car and it <br />
didn't sound good.<br />
<br />
Did they say they had a male brothel? And were they talking about him being their new acquisition? And what <br />
was that about training?<br />
<br />
It was a long drive and Alan became more conscious from time to time but his sore jaw made him feel better if <br />
he were sleeping.<br />
<br />
When they stopped he found himself floating again and eventually in the middle of a white tiled room. Eye <br />
hooks from the ceiling. Straps here and there. A drain in the middle and a hose attached to the wall. Alan was <br />
held up and stripped from head to toe. Straps were wrapped around his body and between his legs. He was not <br />
familiar with the apparatus but he soon found out is was a harness. It had links on it that were attached to <br />
chains linked to the eye hooks hanging from the ceiling and able to hold his hands and legs in position. This <br />
was when he realized why he felt as if he were floating. His new body was a skinny build, nothing like his old <br />
body, and he found himself floating again but this time he realized why. These big black muscled men were <br />
transporting him like a rag doll. They lifted him in place and secured him.<br />
<br />
Alan hung there for what seemed like days before they returned. Looking at the stark white tiles that were <br />
from ceiling to floor. When they returned one had a huge bucket with a spigot running out the bottom of it. It <br />
was hung from the ceiling and a hose was attached to it. the tube was unceremoniously inserted into his ass <br />
and the valve was turned on. A thick liquid soon filled his ass working it's way up his intestines till he <br />
could tell it had made it's way to his belly. The spigot was turned off and the tube allowed to stay in. The <br />
big black men massaged his belly working the liquid into every nook and cranny of his body and as the cramps <br />
hit they massaged more.<br />
<br />
They left him filled for some time. It was impossible to figure out how long in the room since there were no <br />
clocks and no windows. They pulled out the tube and began pressing at his abdomen to get all the fluid out. <br />
The did this 5 more times with more forced in every time. Alan's head would be dropped while he was in a <br />
waiting position allowing the fluid to work it's magic and the big black men would take turns at his mouth <br />
forcing it to open more than it had ever been forced open. His throat opened wide and would eventually take <br />
those long thick cocks down with ease.<br />
<br />
Being filled from both ends was hard but he found it to be highly exciting at the same time.<br />
<br />
When the fifth time fished the fluid was released and the hose stuck up his backside and he was flushed out.<br />
<br />
His insides were now use to massive quantities but his sphincter was still only use to small things. The big <br />
black men were then able to fix that. Alan road their cocks till he was stretched to the max. Alan was <br />
exhausted.<br />
<br />
When they were through with preparing him they took him down from his dangling imprisonment and hooked a leash <br />
around his neck and led him out to what appeared to be a stage. There was an inclined bench that he was made <br />
to lay face down upon and chained in place. Alan was exhausted so laying down felt good to him.<br />
<br />
He heard someone come up behind him and soon a rough body was mounting him. This was different than the black <br />
men and soon they came deep inside of him. There was a roar from the audience. There was something else that <br />
came up behind him and it entered him deeply. THEY WERE ANIMALS MOUNTING HIM!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Over and over he was mounted by bigger and bigger cocks eventually having a horse mount him. When his ass was <br />
fully loaded and the mucus plug firmly holding all the cum inside of him the audience was then allowed to come <br />
and use him. Men would stick their dicks up his well opened ass and lay on top of him. He could feel the <br />
animal cum moving inside of him working it's way through his body. Others would force their cocks down his <br />
throat all night long. <br />
<br />
Alan passed out several times just to wake with more different men using him.<br />
<br />
When the night ended he was once again suspended from the ceiling by the big black men. The human cum dripping <br />
from his ass drying on his ass cheeks but the plug kept the animal cum deep inside of him.<br />
<br />
When morning came, or so he thought, the big black men once again emptied him out with the thick liquid and <br />
prepared him for the next event.</p>
