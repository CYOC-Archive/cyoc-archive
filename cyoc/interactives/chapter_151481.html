<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Melissa knew plenty of people in her online gaming circle. Some people preferred to be faceless on the internet, but not Melissa. She wanted to know the people she was playing with, to see if she had anything in common with them besides gaming. It turned out she and Angie had a lot more in common than she would expected. Both of them had lost limbs in vehicular accidents. But while Melissa only lost her legs, Angie lost both legs and her arms. The only way she was able to play was because of the latest in pupil-following webcam software. Angie had tried to make light of it, saying that perhaps modern technology will allow her to directly jack into computers to play, but Melissa could tell she was hurting bad inside. When Melissa converted, she tried to arrange for Angie to become an Animalian too.<br />
<br />
The process for this took a while. The recent drop in conversion costs helped speed things up. A main part was convincing Angie&#39;s parents to go through with the procedure. While not against Animalians, they had trouble accepting the idea of their daughter becoming one. It took some time to convince them that being an Animalian wasn&#39;t like getting a tattoo she&#39;d regret later in life, but a way to have four limbs again. However, the way she wanted four limbs caused another round of argument.<br />
<br />
Even before the accident, Angie spent a lot of time online. Given her current lack of mobility, she was online even more often. She had always found nagas fascinating and beautiful creatures. She had considered a snake conversion as one of her options, though her parents wanted her to have legs again. But as soon as the polymelia project started, Angie immediately decided she wanted to be a four-armed snake. That caused a lot of arguing both with her parents and with some Horizon Labs scientists. The polymelia gene has barely been studied. They couldn&#39;t just slap four arms onto anyone who wanted it. But Angie had a will of steel and she refused to bend for anyone. Eventually, they capitulated and Angie would be going to Horizon Labs for her conversion.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Naturally, Melissa was there to support her friend. Andre went with her as well. Andre was mildly confused of why Melissa was looking worried. &quot;You&#39;re not the one who&#39;s converting,&quot; he told her, &quot;What&#39;s got you worked up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is the first time I&#39;m meeting Angie face-to-face,&quot; said Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing online chatting doesn&#39;t count,&quot; said Andre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not really,&quot; said Melissa, &quot;I&#39;m just worried about what she&#39;ll think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a sexy lizard woman now,&quot; said Andre, &quot;I think she&#39;ll be excited to be like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, she will be more like me.&quot; Melissa and Andre looked to see Sylvia Rattlerton slither in. They hadn&#39;t really met, but Syliva did have some renown in Animalia.<br />
<br />
&quot;What brings you here?&quot; asked Andre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just showing some support,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;I know what it&#39;s like to lose a leg in a car accident and become a snake.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ended up a lot luckier than her,&quot; said Melissa, not trying to sound bitter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Comparatively,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;But she may want as much support as she can get. Especially with the x-rays.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What x-rays?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;When I got converted, the scientists wanted to see how my bones shifted with a fluoroscope. I get the feeling they&#39;ll want to see the same with Angie,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I can see that happening,&quot; said Andre.<br />
<br />
&quot;But would it be safe?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. It might make her grow extra bones,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Was that a joke?&quot; asked Melissa, sounding surprised than insulted.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? You think I don&#39;t have a sense of humor?&quot; asked Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just seem the straight-laced serious type,&quot; said Andre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ve been hanging around Muxing too long,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;Then again, maybe I could introduce Angie to her. That might open some new perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eventually, Angie herself arrived. She looked rather small in her wheelchair, even smaller with only stumps for arms. Her parents were pushing the wheelchair in behind her. To Andre and Sylvia&#39;s surprise, the family were quite clearly Indian. Melissa wasn&#39;t so surprised. &quot;Angie, it&#39;s good to see you,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to see you too,&quot; said Angie, &quot;You&#39;re taller than I expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Having new legs help,&quot; said Melissa, &quot;This is my new boyfriend, Andre.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi there,&quot; said Andre, &quot;Uh, sorry for asking, but I wasn&#39;t expecting you to be, uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hindi?&quot; asked Angie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Er, yeah. I mean &#39;Angie&#39; isn&#39;t what someone would think of...&quot; started Andre.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s short for Anjali,&quot; said Angie&#39;s father, &quot;She shouldn&#39;t have to hide who she is online.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like people don&#39;t hang up the phone when they hear your accent, Dad,&quot; said Angie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tech support?&quot; asked Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Real</i> tech support, thank you very much,&quot; said Angie&#39;s father, &quot;I&#39;m not one of those scammers who hound after people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie&#39;s mother looked at Sylvia and asked, &quot;Are you one of the nagi here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just a snake Animalian,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;I&#39;m working on getting my law degree. I&#39;m probably not the kind of naga you&#39;re thinking of.&quot; She rattled her tail for emphasis.<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps you can give us your opinion,&quot; said Angie&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legal opinion or just opinion as a snake?&quot; asked Sylvia, &quot;The latter probably doesn&#39;t have a lot to offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we&#39;re agreeing to our daughter&#39;s strange request to have four arms, but there are certain things we won&#39;t let her give up,&quot; said Angie&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
&quot;That being?&quot; asked Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her hair,&quot; said Angie&#39;s mother, &quot;I&#39;ve spent so long combing and brushing that lovely hair of hers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...&quot; said Angie in embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I hear people tend to go bald when they turn into reptiles but you didn&#39;t,&quot; said Angie&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, that mainly happens with Dinotopians,&quot; said Melissa, &quot;There&#39;s a chance some people will lose their hair when they become reptilian Animalians, but there&#39;s no real guarantee.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which would most likely take away her hair?&quot; asked Angie&#39;s father.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it might be the cobra,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;I&#39;m not sure why. Maybe the hood overwrites the need for hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shoot,&quot; said Angie, &quot;That was one of my top picks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not going bald on me, daughter of mine,&quot; said Angie&#39;s mother sharply, &quot;You can be a four-armed monkey, as long as you don&#39;t lose your hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kinda of an odd thing to be obstinate about,&quot; whispered Andre to Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, her hair would probably be the only thing that will make her look like her original self,&quot; whispered Melissa, &quot;I think her parents want to cling to that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, how about a python? Is that a problem?&quot; asked Angie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Probably not,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;Though I haven&#39;t really met a lot of pythons. Plenty of anacondas though and they haven&#39;t lost their hair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no strict guarantee she&#39;ll keep her hair though,&quot; said Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it&#39;s as close a compromise as we&#39;re gonna get,&quot; said Angie.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
The scientists were wanting to observe Angie&#39;s transformation on the skeletal level. They even brought her to the same room where Sylvia was converted. Though unlike Sylvia, Angie wouldn&#39;t be changing in the nude. Her parents refused to let her be seen like that so she was wearing hospital gown, one with extended slits down the sides to make room for her new arms. &quot;Uh, just how much is this going to hurt?&quot; asked Angie as she was put on the slab.<br />
<br />
&quot;Considering you&#39;ll be growing new bones have others rearranged and altered, there should be some discomfort,&quot; said the scientist overseeing it, &quot;But nothing that should be unendurable and it won&#39;t last long either. Are you certain about your choice of animal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I wanted to be a four-armed snake and I&#39;m going to be one,&quot; said Angie. The snake she ultimately went with was the Burmese python, not the rarest of species, especially with how many have gotten loose in Florida.<br />
<br />
&quot;In that case, let&#39;s get started,&quot; said the scientist. He injected one needle into her right arm stump and one needled into her right leg stump. Then he walked over to the fluoroscope controls and turned it on. An image of her skeleton was soon visible on the screen.<br />
<br />
The first thing Angie felt was itchiness where she was injected. Which was pretty frustrating as she had no means to scratch. Then it felt like fire was burning where her arm and leg abruptly ended. The feeling spread to her other truncated limbs as well as the base of her spine. Angie watched as her arms slowly started to grow out. As they grew, scales started to appear on them. But then her attention was driven away from her regrowing arms as her legs suddenly dislocated with two painful pops.<br />
<br />
On the fluoroscope&#39;s screen, Angie&#39;s femurs could been detaching from her hips. Altering muscles and tissues were drawing them upwards even as they were being turned into new humeri. Eventually, they settled a few inches under her original arms, connecting to a newly-formed extra pair of shoulder blades. Once they had settled, the regrowth of her arms began in earnest. New radius and ulna bones grew from each elbow. Once they got long enough, new hand bones started to bud. For Angie, it felt very weird for her to move the arms she had once lost. It felt even weird for her legs to be moving like arms.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Angie&#39;s coccyx extended further, threading through her reshaped pelvis. Her lower body was quickly assuming a serpentine shape as it grew longer and longer. The scales were spreading aggressively over her body now. The blotches that typical of the Burmese python retained her original brown skin tone, but they were edged with black scales and khaki scales appeared between the blotches. Her front was covered in paler scales which showing the definition of her growing muscles. Angie tried to keep her moans to herself as her previously-modest breasts were growing much, much larger, taking up a lot of room in her hospital gown. Compared to the rest of her body, her neck didn&#39;t extend much, though certainly more than a human&#39;s. It felt a little uncomfortable when her face extended into a snake&#39;s muzzle, but not nearly as much as the rest of her.<br />
<br />
When her transformation came to a stop, the scientist asked, &quot;Anjali, how are you feeling?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;sss ssstill Angie,&quot; said Angie as she propped herself up with her original arms. She lifted up her new arms and flexed her new hands in front of her. &quot;And I feel really good now,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sure your parents will want to see you now,&quot; said the scientist.<br />
<br />
Angie brushed a lock of her hair away from her face. She kept her hair, like her mother wished, so that would be one less hassle. &quot;Not jussst yet,&quot; said Angie, &quot;I wanna sssee what I look like firssst. Alssso to figure out how to ssstop hissssssing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a normal thing for new snake Animalians,&quot; said the scientist, &quot;I think you should your parents first though.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angie sighed and said, &quot;Fine.&quot; She really should talk with her parents anyways. But as soon as she could, she was going to check out her new body.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Some time later, Angie was finally able to get some alone time. Making sure the door was locked, she stripped and looked at herself in the mirror. &quot;Wow,&quot; she said, &quot;The nagasss in World of Warcraft wisssh they could look thisss good.&quot; As a Burmese python, she was one of the largest snakes in the world and her body showed it. Her tail was 9 feet long she was 5&#39;9&quot; at the shoulder. She heard that snakes kept growing throughout their lives so she wondered if she&#39;d get bigger still. But the two doses certainly made her both older and stronger. Her muscles were very detailed, especially in her four arms. She also had a very large pair of breasts, each looking like a pumpkin in size but supported by her four pectoral muscles. Her black hair and the patterns on her back side added to her exotic allure.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m definitely a sssexy sssnake,&quot; said Angie as she posed in the mirror. Using four arms took a bit more concentration than expected, but she was sure she could get the hang of it. &quot;But to make sssure...&quot; She slithered over to the bed before lying down on it. Once she was comfortable, she started groping her large breasts with her upper arms, teasing her scaly nipples. Angie moaned. This already felt good. But she could do more. With a little work, she got her lower arms feeling around her pelvis. She did this before with just two hands, she just need to... There it was. Her lower hands teased her lower lips before she slipped some fingers inside herself.<br />
<br />
Angie moaned louder as she pleasured herself. With four arms, she could pleasure both tits and slit at the same time. Her tail curled in on itself as she felt her pleasure climbing. She had never been able to get herself off this fast before. She just needed a little more time and... Angie let out a hiss as her lower lips let out a small gush, her nipples dripping milk for the first time. &quot;That wasss good,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll need to figure out how to go ssslower later.&quot; She looked down her serpentine body and said, &quot;Thisss wasss totally worth it.&quot;</p>
