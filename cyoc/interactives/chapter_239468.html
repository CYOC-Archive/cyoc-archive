<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The next few minutes were grueling.  Much to Steve’s agony, his body had insisted that his stomach was going to tear itself apart as he rocked back and forth in the fetal position.  But for every nerve that screamed “I’m being ripped apart!” the ripping never came to pass.  Instead, Steve was just forced to sit there and bear it as the baby’s head pressed vainly into his cervix.  Then the switch inside of Steve’s brain flipped off and the contraction ended.<br />
<br />
Still panting, Steve looked down at the sentence and began trying to figure out how to change it:<br />
<br />
“The anthropomorphic rabbit is in labor.”<br />
<br />
There were so many possibilities, but Steve couldn’t see one that would get him out of this in a single change.  For example, what would happen if Steve first changed “anthropomorphic rabbit” to “human man” – Steve knew what mpreg was, and the last thing he wanted was to find himself giving birth through his dick.  So that meant he needed to make the first change to “in labor.”  But how to do that without making his situation worse?<br />
<br />
If he changed “is” to “isn’t”, then changed “anthropomorphic rabbit” to “human man” he would end up with “The human man isn’t in labor.”  That would imply that he was still pregnant and, once again, he didn’t want to end up in an mpreg situation.  This app was a monkey paw, if it could find an ambiguity to screw him over it would.<br />
<br />
He kept pondering until he came up with a possibility.  What if he changed “labor” to “bathroom” and then changed “anthropomorphic rabbit” to “human man”?  That would end up with “The human man is in the bathroom.”  That would be a true sentence that doesn’t mention pregnancy.  He though it over and couldn’t think of a way that it made his situation worse, so with no better idea, he decided to go with it.  Making the first change, he saw the sentence change to:<br />
<br />
“The anthropomorphic rabbit is in the bathroom.”<br />
<br />
Steve didn’t really expect anything to change.  As much as he was hoping that removing the reference to his current status as a soon to be mother would have ended the labor, the moderate cramping coming from his slowly dilating cervix told him that his body was still very much moving towards giving birth.<br />
<br />
Steve continued to sit there, fully intending to wait out the timer, when he felt a new sensation well up inside of his belly, from an area just below the baby.  It was a feeling of intense pressure that radiated down into the top of his vagina, almost like he had to… GO PEE!<br />
<br />
The urge rapidly intensified as he felt his bladder being squeezed between the bones of his pelvis and the bulbous head of the baby inside of him.  It was only then that Steve realized the disaster that the app had set up to cause him to fail.<br />
<br />
After editing the sentence Steve had lowered the phone to rest on his thighs – right in front of his cunt.  The baby inside of him thrashed, applying an inordinate amount of pressure to overfilled bladder that it was resting against.  And unlike when he’d been a man, whose body had a valve to shut off the flow of urine, his female anatomy lacked any such safeguard.<br />
<br />
With his bladder depressed, he could feel a tiny spurt of urine pass down into his urethra despite his best efforts otherwise.  And as small as the spurt was, it was still enough to kill his phone, which it was currently headed straight towards.  Fortunately for Steve, he’d managed to realize what was going to happen just in time to lift his phone above his belly, which meant that when the jet of urine passed through the thin elastic of his yoga pants, it just splattered harmlessly on the already soaked tile floor.<br />
<br />
“Thank god…” Steve panted as he placed his phone on a dry patch of floor beside him.  With that crisis avoided, Steve was brought back to the reality of the fact that his bladder was still full and he had to go, now!<br />
<br />
Steve was once again reminded that rising to his feet was a much more arduous task as a laboring woman than it was as healthy man.  He started by tucking his legs up against his belly, then pushed off of the floor with both his hands and feet.  Managing to keep his back rigid to avoid compressing the baby inside of him, Steve slowly rose to a standing position, then looked at the toilet.<br />
<br />
The addict, his “husband” according to the app, was still passed out in front of it.  At first figured he could just pee past him – the unconscious body didn’t occupy much space, after all.  Pulling his yoga pants down, Steve tried to mentally map out where his penis was as his hand reached under his bloated belly and grasped for it.  <br />
<br />
Steve was used to the feeling of his dick riding up into his body, especially when it was cold, but his mental map seemed completely confused.  He could still feel his cock, but it was just a tiny nub at the top of his crotch, while his balls felt completely absent.  Steve’s hand grasped at empty air, then moved closer and closer to his crotch until he felt his fingers grab onto the tiny nub that existed in his mental map of his body.<br />
<br />
The nub was so small that he could barely pinch it together.  Something wasn’t right about it; he shouldn’t be this flaccid even if…<br />
<br />
Steve’s stomach sank, or at least it would have were it not blocked by the enormous baby inside of him.  No, he realized, what the app had said earlier was true, there were two babies inside of him.  And he was now a she.  Or, Steve wasn’t a she, but his body very much was.  <br />
<br />
He felt the world swirl, though this time it wasn’t due to a drug but rather to the incongruity between his instincts and his realization of how inappropriate those instincts now were.  Over the past 30 something years he’d programmed his brain on how to go to the bathroom.  That involved dropping his pants, grabbing his dick, pointing it at the toilet, and then pissing.  That program was so ingrained his brain, he realized, that he didn’t really have any input in going to the bathroom anymore, it was just something that his brain did on autopilot for him.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that he was now trapped in a female body, when he’d given the command to go pee, his brain had run the same program that it had in his male body – a program that was now completely inappropriate for the body he found himself in.  But despite how inappropriate that program now was, he didn’t even realize that he was doing it until his fingers had pressed into his clit.  It was only then, when the nerves inside of it screamed out “I’m a clit not a dick” that he had realized what was happening.<br />
<br />
His mental map adjusted, and he realized that his clit wasn’t any more useful for peeing than his old male balls were.  No, his mind told him that there was a small hole below his clit and above his vagina.  That was where his body peed from now, and all he’d managed to do if he tried to pee standing up was to soak the floor below him.<br />
<br />
Steve tried to use his legs to push the male rabbit’s body out the way to the toilet, only to find that his pregnant, female body he didn’t have anywhere near the strength to do that.  Sighing, he just climbed on top of the unconscious body, using it as a sort of footrest, as he turned around and sat down on the toilet.<br />
<br />
As he began the process, Steve felt just how tiny his new urethra was.  Whereas as a man, a literal torrent of piss would erupt from his dick, as a woman it was now a slow, trickling stream.  Then there was the fact that his bladder was full to the point of bursting – given how little flow was coming out of him, he’d expected to be there for a few minutes.  Instead, after a few seconds the flow stopped and Steve felt the urge to go to the bathroom vanish.<br />
<br />
Of course, he realized, his bladder might have felt full, but it wasn’t really.  No, what was going on was that the area where it was supposed to be was now under the hostile occupation of the two fully grown babies squirming around inside of him.  That meant that, if Steve’s plan didn’t work, he could expect end up back on this toilet anytime the slightest amount of fluid made its way to his bladder – at least until the babies were no longer inside of him.  The thought of how exactly those babies would get out of him caused him to shudder.<br />
<br />
“Please body, no more contractions,” he muttered to himself.<br />
<br />
“I’m not a girl,” he said in an overly feminine voice.<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to give birth,” Steve whispered as the cramping in his pelvis told him that his cervix was continuing to dilate.<br />
<br />
“I’m not going to be a mother.  I’m going to turn back into a man, a human man, and then everything will be ok,” said the pregnant rabbit girl, who was now in the early stages of a long and difficult labor, despite the fact that she knew that her only salvation lied in a magical app that was more malicious genie than anything else.</p>
