<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before Karl can answer the receptionist that who to show up then the owner of the veterinary clinic as he enters, Chad&#39;s dad. &quot;Hey, doc, As you can see that Rex here needs his shots.&quot; Karl explained to Chad&#39;s dad the veterinarian.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Karl. Ah, such a fine looking German shepherd you have with you today! You don&#39;t normally see to many of these fellows now a days. are you going to neuter him? if so, do You want me to microchip him?&quot; Chad&#39;s father asked while petting Chad all over that Chad knew it was part of the exam, feeling the animal&#39;s body for anomalies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, could we just get started with his shots first? I kind of want to think about them for a while.&quot; Karl asked while smirking down at Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;why, certainly. i can understand why you want to think it over as it may be a permanent choice for him. Has he had any shots yet?&quot; Chad&#39;s father asked Karl while later showed his reaction he mad a joke about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only tetanus, I think..... It, it was just a joke, but really, No. this dog hasn&#39;t had any canine vaccinations to my knowledge, as of yet.&quot; Karl said while he was looking at whimpering chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s sure is a bit squirmy today. His muscle tone is good that even his organs seems to be healthy. why don&#39;t we bring him out back to the exam room.&quot; Chad&#39;s father said while Chad couldn&#39;t escape from his firm grasp that His gloved hands were basically everywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;That sounds like a great idea, doc.&quot; said Karl with an evil grin while leading Chad in the exam room. Chad whimpered softly as he had been here plenty of times when he was human, but this was his first time as a dog and his whole perception of the place changed that he was so much shorter than before as It smelled of sick animals. The ceiling loomed high over head that His ears perked up when he heard a dog in the operating theater as it let out a muted whine, but Why did dad had to be a vet?<br />
<br />
&quot;you know, I&#39;ve heard that dogs like this one sometimes have alimentary issues. do you think you could scope him out?&quot; Karl spoke that Chad&#39;s eyes went wide. were They going to stick something up his ass!?<br />
<br />
&quot;let us see. come on, up up. Hm, you do have a well-trained dog, Karl.&quot; Chad&#39;s father said when he jumped up on the table. <br />
<br />
&quot;hm, he looks pretty healthy. I usually don&#39;t do it, unless there was blood work that suggests it, or symptoms if something was wrong with him.&quot; he said while rubbing his head gently.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, I just thought he might have eaten something which will disagreed with him later. his stools were pretty much a mess this morning, so do you think you could do the endoscope thing?&quot; Karl said while hiding an evil from Chad&#39;s dad, but easily showed it to him that Chad glared at Karl.<br />
<br />
&quot;um, Okay. i&#39;ll do it. so, have you decided to pop his balls out? We have some nifty silicone replacements that he&#39;ll still look like a stud to most, but he&#39;ll uh be fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why does everybody wanna cut off my nuts?&quot; Chad thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds nifty, doc, but I was thinking about keeping him as a healthy stud for now. maybe we&#39;ll consider ping pong balls for his nutsack after he graduated from obedience training.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karl soon leaned over to Chad and told him to calm down. &quot;now you behave and calm down. do what the doctor says, or i might change my mind about your nutsack.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;hm, I&#39;d think we should probably collect some of a sperm samples. to make sure he&#39;s normal while checking the count, if you like?&quot;.&quot; Chad&#39;s dad said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, definitely. I want to do every test to make sure my stud is up to his the task ahead.&quot; Karl said grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, what a life. mounting females for a living,&quot; remarked Chad&#39;s father, little did he knew at the time was he was actually testing his own son in the body of a German shepherd.<br />
<br />
Damn, his dad&#39;s gloved hand was feeling his nutsack that Karl stole a quick glance at his iPad. Chad didn&#39;t know it at the time, but every word he was thinking, or even tried to say was being transmitted to Karl&#39;s tablet. Karl suppressed a snicker as he read Chad&#39;s whiny complaints while Chad&#39;s dad grabbed his dog cock and squeezed it gently that he quickly He began massaging the foreskin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck this, I&#39;m a dog! Why didn&#39;t I-oh no, not there! dad, don&#39;t! St-stop this!&quot; Chad whined as Karl just watched and enjoyed the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hm, he doesn&#39;t seem to cooperative. guess i&#39;ll have to use the Pheromones. The scent of a bit cheaper in heat.&quot; Chad&#39;s dad explained as he then stoppered a brown glass bottle container that Chad&#39;s eyes went wide. he started yapping like crazy that he didn&#39;t realize his red cock swelled out of its furry sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great, He&#39;s my dad! now he&#39;s uh, he&#39;s, um, ugh, oh, giving me a ha-a-a-and job. Ooh, aah,... No, no, Noooo-!&quot; Chad&#39;s mind screamed that His own father was giving him a hand job while his balls were being milked into the vial as his red dick was fully erect while The glass vial was being fitted into place.<br />
<br />
Karl moved in for a better view, planting his crotch just inches from Chad&#39;s nose when Chad was doing a downward dog yoga stand. All he could do right now was smell Karl&#39;s crotch as he thought of standing back up, but didn&#39;t due to his dad&#39;s nifty hand job. Damn, his dad&#39;s hands were too skilled as it felt so good that He didn&#39;t want to, but the presser kept on building up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, puh-lease, n-o-o!&quot; he thought helplessly as he quickly soon after blew his load out. he couldn&#39;t believe it, his first time having a hand job as a dog by his own father that he felt violated, but even more when Chad&#39;s body started to limp after administering three shots in rapid succession over his flank. before setting Chad back down on the exam counter that they unfitted the glass vial off. A four foot drop from the exam table was pretty far when you&#39;re a dog, even for Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;do You think that&#39;s enough, doc?&quot; Karl asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s plenty. if you want to see how much he can produces, I could drain him?&quot; Chad&#39;s dad said.<br />
<br />
&quot;na, we&#39;re good. sir.&quot; Karl said with a kinder grin to Chad while typing on the app.<br />
<br />
he wasn&#39;t sure if Chad was just imagining it, or if Karl could really communicate with him. &quot;There, That&#39;s a good boy. you see, that wasn&#39;t so bad was it Chad, was it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad discovered another change that Karl had made as He saw the same breed he was, but in heat in the cage while trying to paw its way out of it. Chad thought Karl was sick, he was going to make him fuck female dogs that he&#39;s a stud dog to this female. soon after, The computer monitor hooked up to the microscope to display thousands of squirming sperm from Chad&#39;s sample.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Nice volume your dog has. looks like Rex&#39;s a good candidate for breeding.&quot; Chad&#39;s dad said as he was soon set in an animal cage next to her. He sniffs weakly as It hasn&#39;t been washed in a long time as it reeks of a thousand animals that it was really bad to his sense of smell.<br />
<br />
He was unable to move much, but aware of what&#39;s going on that He hears a almost familiar voice as his ear quickly perks up on it. The voice was near and muffled, yet faraway that it was clear. He could differently hear it that he turned his head as it was coming from the dog, but what shocked him more was the fact this dog was once his girlfriend. Silently, He was growling that Chad growled in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck! You&#39;ve gotta be kidding me! How could an app not only do this to he, but to my love as well?&quot; Chad whined unhappily as he couldn&#39;t make it, so he can enjoy her! he was totally screwed. Chad&#39;s dad wouldn&#39;t knowing the dog was really his son, would he?<br />
<br />
soon Karl left as Chad&#39;s dad kneels down in front of his cage that he slowly opened it. &quot;you know Rex, &quot;We&#39;re more alike then you think. We always try to be the best that we can as I&#39;m the best vet here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rahr?&quot; Chad barks groggily while trying to say his father&#39;s name as Chad&#39;s head, ass, and crotch ached. He was becoming more  like a dog.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woof, woof, woof. Arf?&quot; He was having trouble with his word, to have dad understand that he wasn&#39;t a dog, but his son. Right?<br />
<br />
&quot;if only you knew, my son. if only you knew.&quot; he said while rubbing Rex&#39;s, no, Chad&#39;s head. will He rescue him if He knows?</p>
