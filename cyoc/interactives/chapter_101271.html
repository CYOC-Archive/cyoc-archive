<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Eric did return to the dance class, and he and Julie did their best to move with the music that Nate played. A real part of him was still a bit uncomfortable with a lot of it, and he really hoped that Nate could give them some real pointers on what worked and what didn&#39;t. However, Nate had found himself coming more and more to the rescue of Alex, who tried to copy his boyfriend and ended up looking more awkward than Eric or Julie felt. The rest of Eric really didn&#39;t care so long as he could see the lights twinkle in Julie&#39;s eyes... or maybe they just twinkled on their own. All Eric knew, was that when Julie&#39;s eyes twinkled, she was happy.<br />
<br />
They kept going for a little while while Nate did his best to give as much help to his class as he could, and figured that Eric was catching on fairly well, though both he and Julie also seemed highly focused on each other. Alex did catch on a bit and managed to avoid looking too bad, but as he noticed the door open to announce his father&#39;s return home from the college, with his briefcase in one hand and a bag of ice and a case of soda in the other, Nate got the sense that they were probably getting to a point where they&#39;d need to stop. William and Eric might not have anything big coming up for the night, but Nate and Alex had a pack meeting and Martha and the pride was apparently having an impromptu picnic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dance class?&quot; William asked to Nate as he approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nate nodded, &quot;Picked up a little more than I expected... but I think it went well... everyone&#39;s got a good start.&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded and looked over to Eric and Julie, &quot;so long as every couple has a good time together... in the end that is all that matters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nate nodded.<br />
<br />
Nate felt a hand touch his shoulder from behind. He glanced back to see Alex standing their calmly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m going to go get my bag and will come back here,&quot; Alex spoke, &quot;that way we can meet with Ben for the pack meeting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pack meeting?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;A new family recently moved in... though they&#39;re ALREADY weres, with the son being a werewolf,&quot; Nate informed him, &quot;He&#39;s apparently joining our pack. We found out about it lunch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... well, have a good time, and be sure to be polite to whoever this new werewolf is,&quot; William spoke and then turned to Eric and Julie again, &quot;and how is Moon Lake&#39;s cutest couple?&quot;<br />
<br />
Both Eric and Julie blushed at the compliment.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re doing good,&quot; Eric said slowly as he looked down to his feet.<br />
<br />
Eric paused again as he heard Alex go out the door while Nate went upstairs to get his things ready for the pack meeting. He then turned back to see that his father was smiling to him and Julie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any plans for the weekend?&quot; William asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was thinking... since Nate will be out for the weekend with Alex, Mom has to go in for in-service, and you&#39;ll have classes, could I go and hang with Julie tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
William watched Julie smiled and squeezed his hand before he answered, &quot;Assuming you can be back in time to go to the official Skulk welcome... I have no problem. If you&#39;d like, I could try to get Ms. Tachibana on the phone and ask if you and Nate could bring a &quot;guest&quot; to the ceremony.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to get in your way,&quot; Julie spoke, &quot;it&#39;s more family business...&quot;<br />
<br />
William nodded but thought, &quot;but if your mother is right... you WILL be family... a daughter-in law.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a brief silence before finally Julie said to Eric, &quot;walk me home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything for you,&quot; Eric replied, sounding completely lovesick for the blond haired weremermaid. William only smiled as the two walked out.<br />
<br />
Eric took Julie&#39;s arm as they stepped out the front door and prepared to walk home. He looked to her, saw her eyes twinkle, and she smiled. He responded with a rather dopey grin and felt almost weak in the knees.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know... I was actually going to invite you over for tomorrow,&quot; Julie commented as they left the house.<br />
<br />
&quot;It seems we had the same idea then,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;be with the ones we love.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric did his best to keep from saying, &quot;and do everything.&quot; Throughout the day, Julie was the only think he could really think about. How she looked. How she talked. The things she liked. They were both only fourteen and really only just starting puberty, but Eric couldn&#39;t picture anyone more beautiful than her. Her bright blue eyes, her bright blond hair that framed her face perfectly. That was all he could think about over the day, and the ride home only reminded him of a few things that he&#39;d been noticing about her recently as well. Not only was she beautiful but rather sexy as well, with a firm well toned butt, and firm but soft breasts, sure Eric had only felt those things through the material of Julie&#39;s clothing in one hug the other day and in the back seat of Ben&#39;s car in a very heated make out session, but they did play to his young teenage mind and the passionate love that burned brightly in him.<br />
<br />
Julie&#39;s hips weren&#39;t as wide as her mother&#39;s, yet, and Eric guessed she only had a B cup chest at present, but he knew like him, she was only just starting to grow up and mature. By the time they turned eighteen, her hips would widen out and her breasts would grow to the DD/E cup range, and best of all... Eric figured that Julie wouldn&#39;t suddenly dress provocatively because she knew she was growing up. She would always be smart and kind, funny and outgoing. She would always love him, and a good part of his mind screamed at him to show her he loved her back... that he needed to show her his love... to be with her forever and always. He needed her to know he loved her. He needed her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Great minds do think alike,&quot; Julie gave a shrug as they walked along, &quot;And we&#39;ll have pretty much all day for some fun and to be together.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of fun?&quot; Eric wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;ALL kinds,&quot; Julie answered, thinking back to the car ride home from school. On some level, she was grateful that Alex had stopped them. A voice in her own head seemed to scream to her show him how much you love him. Love him with all your might, and she had a hard time resisting it, and while Eric&#39;s massaging of her chest had been a bit clumsy, it was still soft and felt very nice And in massaging the area between Eric&#39;s legs, Julie had felt something that a part of her was eager to feel more of. That voice was hard to resist, and she was probably certain that if Alex hadn&#39;t interrupted them, they might have ended up having sex in the backseat of Ben&#39;s car, which wouldn&#39;t be right, would have killed the plan for tomorrow, and might even give some the political fuel to hurt her dad or her family.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds interesting,&quot; Eric commented, &quot;any board games or TV you want to watch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll have to see,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;it all depends on how GOOD you are with me...&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric gave a puzzled gulp at that. There was some sexual undertone to it, and he could tell that by some of the flirtatious conversation he&#39;d heard his mother give to the Twists and to his father since their respective transformations. It reminded him of something Julie had said to him in chat that married weres tended to be very passionate with each other. The reminder that he loved her and the she loved him then hit him like a ton of bricks. Julie was planning that they would do more than just hang out tomorrow. She planned to turn him into her weremerman and he could show her just how much he truly loved her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I am good for you,&quot; Eric thought nervously, mostly fearing that he&#39;d be bad and Julie wouldn&#39;t want to see him again for it. After a moment he did say out loud, &quot;I&#39;ll do my best... because... I want to be with you forever... to swim with you... read to you... talk with you...&quot;<br />
<br />
By this point, the reached the front gate to the Stovall home as Eric spoke. Julie looked back to him and smiled. His eyes were a brilliant blue, and she could see them twinkle just as he said her eyes did.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is so handsome... polite... smart... maybe awkward at times in a goofy way... but overall he&#39;s wonderful,&quot; Julie thought to herself and then said, &quot;Oh... Eric.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric stood in polite surprise as Julie leaped into his arms and wrapped hers around his shoulders. She leaned in and brought her lips forward, and on cue, he leaned forward as well, and in a manner of seconds the two of them were locked in a bout of very passionate tongue wrestling. Julie felt herself grow warmer as they kissed and managed to pull apart just before either of them really began to go beyond just kissing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should go in,&quot; Julie said with a weak smile and headed in toward the door, &quot;See you tomorrow?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it, when should I come by?&quot; Eric asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... nine at the earliest,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;we can talk, plan what to do for lunch, watch some TV...&quot; She then quietly thought to herself, &quot;show each other how much we truly love each other... and get ALL our needs out of the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Eric smiled to her as he watched her eyes twinkle like sapphires in the sun, &quot;love you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too,&quot; Julie answered and went inside.</p>
