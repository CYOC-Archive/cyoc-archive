<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">”Fucking Mutant”<br />
I stop on the half-shark half-humanoid husk’s arm crushing it with my raw masculine strength feeling my cock get rock hard. I then grab my flame thrower and light the fucker on fire. The screams of the mutant get my two battle brothers hard and they let their long cocks fly free and jerk themselves off. Privates Webbleson and Michealson fight and knock each other to see who the mouth whore will be today. My superior, General Roger Lineman does 10 lines of coke on the field computer.<br />
<br />
I am Robert Michaels lieutenant general of the Rhinostone company. We are the toughest regiment within the kingdom of boy’s military. We took over the moon from those whores from the Dominion’s Epsilon legion. We wiped them out with the addition of our mutants developed by our amazing science officer. Once we took over the moon, we terraformed the fucking rock giving it an atmosphere make it a water world with one large continent-sized island in the middle. We had even renamed the place Earth 2 just to rub in to the those over emotional and sentimental bitches over at the Dominion of Girl. We are over a force of the 30 million strong. We are the protectors and in order to reach our capital planet of Mars those fuckers at the Dominion have to go throw us. Ever since we took over the girls have been only limited to Venus and Mercury while we have Earth 2, Mars, Phobos and, Deimos.  We have been using Earth 2 as the building grounds for our military and have over 50 percent of it here. Once we wipe the Dominion out we are going to spread boyhood to the stars. <br />
<br />
We did have one set-back. Our scientific officer Dr. Smith recently died due to an assault by the Zeta legion. It turns out he was the only that knew how to control the mutants and they went ballistic and attacked all of us. We did lose some troops but they were weak because they lost to a mutant. Even without our scientific officer and fancy mutants, we could still wipe out the Dominion due to our sheer man power. Unless they could somehow convert all of us to their side they were not going to win. Who in their right mind would want to give up being a boy we are just so much better. <br />
<br />
We are about to get ready for combat drills when we see something in the sky. It is a Dominion Kappa class fleet ship, the pink ship disgusts me and we see the flag with our binoculars. It was the Zeta legion, even though they won the battle with Dr. Smith they lost 70 percent of their legion and all of their jet troops. The Zeta jets did something odd, the Zeta legion is known for advanced flying maneuvers and formations yet they were just randomly buzzing around the fleet ship like the flies around a mutant corpse. Something felt odd yet it didn&#39;t matter Rhinostone got rid of Epsilon Legion and now we would get rid of Zeta Legion. We also took a lot of the tanks and walker the Epsilon legion had and repainted them our glorious blue. We thought it would really piss them off if we used their tech on them. <br />
<br />
Then the fleet ship starts to fire an odd projectile, using the spider-drone tank we shoot it mid air. Then a pink gas comes out. The fleet ship keeps doing this but we keep hitting the projectile before it hits us. We even took out a good amount of Zeta Legion jets. Though I noticed something. This pink gas wasn&#39;t going away it was only growing and getting thicker. It was hugging the atmosphere. The general also noticed<br />
<br />
&quot;Men they are trying something!&quot;<br />
<br />
As was saying this we noticed his short sliver hair turning darker and growing longer. His voice was becoming more high pitched and we saw his glorious Adam&#39;s apple go away.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gentlemen we have to fight the urge of filth, brothers avenge me!&quot; General Lineman then takes his sword and shoves though his chest. He knew what was going on. Those disgusting girls are converting us into them somehow. General Lineman made the right choice before being fully converted. I guess I am now leader/general of the Rhinostone company.<br />
<br />
Wait what am I talking about femininity is much better than being a boy. Wait what did I just say? Cocks are cooler! No pussies are better! What is going on? I feel enlightened now. I now feel the power of feminine thought and it is pure and right. Boys are the inferior template of what Homo sapiens should be. Girls are the final and superior form of Homo sapiens. I now understand this and never want to turn back. I rip my disgusting Royal Blue uniform off with the rest of my battle sisters who have seen the beautiful pink light. All 28,978,872 of us await our transformation. I feel mine coming and I cry tears of joy. I feel my height of 6&#39;8&#39;&#39; decrease to 5&#39;10&#39;&#39; and then my body becomes athletic and curvy. I love my new wide hips. I moan in pleasure as my ample D cup breasts grow on my chest and flick the nipples and I moan even louder. I feel my vocal cords change and now I have a high pitched feminine voice. My neck line and skull shift and I feel my long blonde hair flow out a little past my mid back and I know they will match my green eyes well. My disgusting cock and balls become a vagina and womb. I feel complete like the perfect feminine form I was always supposed to be. <br />
<br />
I then look at all of my new sisters in arms. We all are ultra feminine and love it. We instantly feel a deep emotional connection to each other something we missed out on as eww boys. I feel my pussy get damp and I can help but touch myself. I love my new female fingers and how they can penetrate my amazing hole. Just entering my new hole is 10x better than jacking off as a diseased boy. I keep going and hearing 28 million other beautiful women moan is only making my orgasm better. Eventually another ship arrives it was the Chancellor&#39;s ship. Within hour&#39;s we are given new stylish yet highly functional Orchid Pink battle armor and the Zeta Legion came down in their carmine pink. My troops stand at the attention of the Chancellor. I stand in my new officers uniform on the stage with my long honey blonde hair in bun. I am accompanied by the Surgeon Master(s?) (why is there two of them?) and the Zeta Grand Commander Lilith Janice The Chancellor speaks<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, former Rhinostone Comapny, this war has cost a lot of lives and needs to end. The other side has shown it is either us or them. We intended to end this war now. You all have been shown the glorious feminine light and we intend to spread this across the universe until boyhood is only a bad memory. All of you have been reborn as your true feminine selves, thanks to the work of both Drs.Covaks, keeping with theme of rebirth we have given you the same color as the former Epsilon Legion and you will help lead us to victory. You and the Zeta legion will lead the attack on Mars. Rebecca Michellen formerly Robert Michaels is now your Grand Commander&quot; <br />
<br />
Being an Epsilon is an honor but I feel bad that I wiped out the original Epsilon legion and a good chunk of the Zeta legion. Zeta Grand Commander Lilith Janice greets me but I am too ashamed to look her in the eye. I start to cry in tears of sadness and shame <br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry for what I have done!&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulls me in for a hug and then kisses me dirty. I wanted to fuck her sexy athletic pear shaped body right then and there but we had more pressing matters at hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is okay Grand Commander Michellen, you were a diseased person back then, now you are different and pure. Don&#39;t worry we all love and forgive you. No one will go in vain once we erase boyhood for good. I am here for you if you need someone to talk to.&quot;<br />
<br />
I kiss her on the cheek <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, I look forward to working alongside you, my sister of battle&quot;</p>
