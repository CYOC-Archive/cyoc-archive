<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Authors note: Cowritten with Anonymous aka Real History <br />
<br />
A stern expression crossed Arions face as yet another attack set a soldier ablaze. Despite eliminating close to 20 soldiers, the fairy army was taking heavy casualties.<br />
<br />
Forty percent. Those were the estimated casualties of the fae army with countless others injured. Arion lost over a third of his army and still at least 100 Normal soldiers remained. The battle scarred fairy wondered if victory was obtainable.<br />
<br />
&quot;General Arion, THE SHIELD!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Arion turned towards the voice, his eyes growing wide in alarm. On the far eastern side of the capital, Arion watched as the shield that protected the area seemed to waver before visible cracks appeared before splintering. This single area now open to attack, the Normal immediately igniting the buildings in the area. Arion could make out fairy mages now tending to the fire, strengthening the remaining shield and attempting to put out the blaze.<br />
<br />
&quot;All fairies,&quot; Arion commanded. &quot;This is General Arion. The city shields have been breached. All units concentrate on the far eastern front and attack!&quot; Arion listened to his subordinates relay his message. The fairy general listened as some of his officers tried to stop Arion from leading the charge. They understood that this was a suicide mission, that the capital was surely lost. Arion would be needed in the resistance movement to come.<br />
<br />
The mighty red fairy though would not listen. For centuries he served the fae realm with honor. He was the protector for the royal family and if his life needed to be given, he would do so. &quot;Soldiers of the Fae! Tonight we dine in Avalon!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a mighty war cry, Arion now dove towards the group of attackers. Four soldiers were clustered on the eastern edge, trying to enlarge the breech and burn more of the capital. Seeing this Arion mustered a group of fairys, diving straight towards the fuel tanks. The attackers though were ready, two immediately turning towards the dive bombing Arion and unleashing a wave of fire. The fairy general was faster though, maneuvering out of the way.<br />
<br />
The cries of fairy soldiers though echoed behind Arion. Turning his head slightly, he watched in anguish as the burnt bodies of the fairys following him floated to the ground like embers from a burning leaf. An angry cry now escaped his lips, pushing him forward to have his revenge.<br />
<br />
One..Two...Three tanks were cut, Arion useing his blade to severe the lines and ignite them. The explosions occurred in quick succession, the soldiers going off like fireworks as their tanks exploded. The mighty general had fell three Normal soldiers in quick succession but not the fourth.<br />
<br />
This fourth soldier, seeing his comrades explode in flames, dodged at the last moment. As Arion soared past, the soldier turned his weapon on the fairy general and fired. Arion winced as he felt the heat of the flames, only for pain to wrack his body. Turning the general noticed the lower half of his right wing now burning. Quickly putting it out, Arion realized his ability to fly was hampered as he now crashed into the soft ground below.<br />
<br />
&quot;General Arion is down,&quot; a fairy voice yelled to the army. &quot;I repeat the general is down.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arion was dazed, noting his damaged wing. In time it would heal, but not in time to continue to protect the capital. Glancing up at his attacker, Arion was stoic, closing his eyes as he awaited his fate.<br />
<br />
&quot;HA!&quot; Arion heard a female voice shout as he looked up to see the Normal soldier get knocked down by a stun baton and then proceeded to get shocked with it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Spread out! Take down any Normal soldier you can find and make &#39;em regret coming here!&quot; The fairy woman shouted as more soldiers came in, each looking different than the last. Finally another fairy flew in next to Arion&#39;s savior as he recognized it to be Aloe&#39;la.<br />
<br />
&quot;You alright General?&quot; The fairy female said extending her hand to Arion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely am now. Where&#39;d you all come from and what is Aloe&#39;la doing here?&quot; Arion asked standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;S.P.E.A.R., and we&#39;ve brought help.&quot; Aloe&#39;la explained to Arion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I&#39;m just happy we got the help, we were certainly getting our asses kicked.&quot; Arion said as he looked at his wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw damn, it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re going to be able to fly for a while.&quot; Aloe&#39;la said examining his wings.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get him off the field. Aoloa, take him to my mother, she&#39;s still at the capital, I presume?&quot; The fairy woman asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who&#39;s your mother?&quot; Arion asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen Glitter, the long-short explanation is I&#39;m the long hidden daughter of hers, Princess Sarathea, and I&#39;m here to protect my birth home.&quot; Sarathea explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, I guess you can tell me about that later. Right now, I think I do need a medic.&quot; Arion said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, Aoloa, take him to the capital, I&#39;ll help the rest of the troops keep the Normal away from the capital.&quot; Sarathea said as Aoloa took Arion&#39;s arm and wrapped it around her shoulder.<br />
<br />
They watched as Sarathea raced to a soldier. Transforming between fairy and human form, she delivered a solid punch to the face as two more gathered around her to corner her before she shrank, returning to human form as she kicked one in the gut before using her stun baton on the other&#39;s chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, is she really Queen Glitter&#39;s daughter?&quot; Arion asked as he and Aoloa took of flying for the capital.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn right she is. She is all that and more!&quot; Aoloa replied with a smirk.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile a little earlier after everyone had come through the portal, Lancelot and Hailey found themselves fighting close to each other. Lancelot was impressed by Hailey&#39;s fighting while Hailey was impressed by Lancelot&#39;s strength in taking out couple of soldiers by pushing a tree down onto them crushing them. As well as deflecting several shots with his long sword.<br />
<br />
At one point, a soldier grazed Hailey&#39;s shoulder, Hailey saw the blood and turned to face the soldier as her eyes went red and she raced towards the soldier as she punched him hard in the gut and he fell onto the ground. Hailey then sat on the soldier&#39;s stomach as she pounded over and over at his face into the helmet bruising him up very badly, she almost didn&#39;t seem like she would stop. Suddenly she felt a hand on her shoulder and turned around to throw a punch, but saw it was Lancelot.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think you got him.&quot; Lancelot said as Hailey calmed down and took a few deep breaths.<br />
<br />
Lancelot noticed the bruised and wounded soldier was shakily holding out his gun and took a shot at Hailey as Lancelot quickly pushed her out of the way and he dodged it just in time as the bullet grazed his ear and the soldier took his last breath.<br />
<br />
&quot;You okay?&quot; Lancelot asked looking at Hailey who was still a little shaken but nodded. &quot;Good, stand up. It&#39;s never a good idea to stand still in a battle field.&quot; Lancelot said as he and Hailey stood back to back as some soldiers came their way.<br />
<br />
Sarathea was flying around finding any fairy she could and give them a hand. Some looked injured and she flew them as fast as she could to a medic. Two fairies were barely holding their ground against a tough Normal soldier until Sarathea came in and gave them a hand and they were relieved by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who....who are you?&quot; The female fairy soldier asked as she and her male fairy counterpart were looking at her in shock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sarathea, and if you&#39;re able to still fight, then stand tall. Help&#39;s arrived and I say this battle&#39;s not over yet!&quot; Sarathea said encouraging the two fairies as they nodded and managed to get a second wind.<br />
<br />
Some other fairies saw the three of them and were inspired to get back up as well and fight alongside them. Sarathea couldn&#39;t say it of course, but she felt like a leader to people who didn&#39;t even know her yet.<br />
<br />
The tide of battle was beginning to turn, S.P.E.A.R and it&#39;s reinforcements pushing back the attackers. Anna and Henry transforming into werewolves, tearing through the panicked troops as Deputy Director Francis, Michelle Wong, and Greg Wesker provided covering fire. Their actions were only strengthened as Spark and Connor bounded out of the adjoining woods to fight the Normal hand to hand. As the troops sought to retreat and regroup, they found Pryyha the Mummy Princess, Geshp, and Matt the Dragon King.<br />
<br />
Pryyha now used her magic to conjure a sandstorm, momentarily blinding the Normal as Geshp cast a spell, opening a portal to the underworld. Several soldiers screamed in terror as hands dragged them into the abyss. &quot;Are you planning on helping your highness or are we going to have to do all the work,&quot; Geshp asked, a smug smirk plastered on his devilish face. Matt scoffed, a grin on his face as he began to transform. Now, instead of a young man a massive gold dragon stood snarling at the attackers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just try not to burn the rest of the forest down,&quot; Geshp sighed.<br />
<br />
Matt attacked, fangs and claws sending the remaining soldiers sparing into the air. The attackers were shattered, the few remaining retreating away from the royal palace. Despite the fire and damage, the fairy castle still stood. The fairies who remained on the battlefield cheered for their victory and hugged their compatriots.<br />
<br />
Lancelot now stood with Hailey, both having gotten some battle scars, but nothing that couldn&#39;t be patched up. They watched the fae celebrate their victory as Connor and Spark now approached them. Both teens aware of the vampires yet astounded to find them here. &quot;Thank you Hailey,&quot; Connor said, hugging the vampire agent in a tight hug. &quot;You really saved our butts.&quot; Turning to Lancelot, the teen now stared intently at the vampiric knight before shaking his hand. &quot;Connor Moreland, nice to see you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lancelot,&quot; Connor began reply, before Lancelot cast Connor a curious look. &quot;Young Moreland is it me or are you getting shorter?&quot; Connor and Spark both looked at each other and realized that they were shrinking back to fairy size.</p>
