<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rick&#39;s lanky body swayed suggestively as he walked toward Chad.  <br />
<br />
The sowboy Chad slobbered as Rick approached.  The smell of Rick&#39;s sweaty body worked like an aphrodisiac on Chad.  He remembered vaguely that human male sweat androgen was an analogue of pig pheromones.  Rick&#39;s fathered had sprayed him with it before the boar mounted him last time. Chad&#39;s mouth closed around the pouch of his old jockstrap, and he started giving Rick head.  The jockstrap ended up around Rick&#39;s knees.  Chad ended up on his back as Rick shoved his slimy boner into Chad&#39;s piggy hootch.<br />
<br />
&quot;OINK!&quot; squealed Chad.<br />
<br />
As  Rick pounded Chad rhythmically, the lean runner/football receiver began to feel heavier on top of Chad, and Chad felt the mud shifting beneath him. Chad moaned as Rick came again, and again.  The gem around his neck was pulsating. The leather cord was growing tight around Rick&#39;s widening neck.  As wave after wave of cum pulsed out of Rick&#39;s cock into Chad, a wave of fat pulsed out of Chad&#39;s huge body up Rick&#39;s cock and added to Rick&#39;s mass. Rick could feel his cock twisting.  He really was making a pig of himself, and it wasn&#39;t just the bulging legs, arms and torso that had changed. <br />
<br />
Chad felt his cock restored, as Rick grew engorged on top of him.  With effort Chad used his muscles to shift Rick over on to his back.  Chad seemed to be attached by Rick&#39;s now corkscrew shaped swollen penis was lodged deep in him. Chad&#39;s own erection flopped embarrassingly as Rick moaned and dozed in the oozing mud.  The passionate sex and whatever he drank or smoked earlier had taken its toll.  Rick was dead to the world, but his erection was still going strong. Chad lifted his balls, and stared in disbelief, he still had a vagina.  He wondered if he was still pregnant.  His first litter had been twelve piglets.  He felt the last pulses of fat oozing out from under his skin revealing his long lost six-pack abs.  He watched as the ripples of fat moved across Rick&#39;s growing belly.  The orange light of the gem glowed preternaturally.  Rick started gasping for air as the cord seemed to tighten around his swelling neck.  His eyes bulged and he flailed his arms and legs.  Chad realized Rick was choking, and managed to break the cord freeing Rick from asphyxiation.  Rick passed out.  At last his corkscrew penis deflated at the tip first, then farther back.  As Chad disentangled himself from Rick&#39;s now straight flaccid penis.  Chad picked up his mud soaked jockstrap from where it floated nearby.  It had fallen off Rick during Chad&#39;s rape.  He held it gingerly, and then he looked at the charm in his other hand.<br />
<br />
Chad  looked at the now dull grey stone in his hand and back at the sleeping pig boy that Rick had become. From the gate connecting Chad&#39;s pen to the pig barn, there came a loud snorting.  The boars were horny.  Chad was tempted to open the gate, but instead he climbed out of the pen, and used a nearby garden hose to wash the mud, and cum off his body and his soiled jockstrap.  He hung the jockstrap on the fence post on the other side of Rick&#39;s jeans.  Then he stretched, and walked around the barnyard naked.  This had been his home for the past couple months, but he hadn&#39;t been outside the pen until now.  He had been to Rick&#39;s house in town, but Rick&#39;s parents were divorced, and Rick lived with his mother.  His pa ran the farm.  Rick started snoring.  Chad was tempted to go into the house to find something to wear, but it was locked.<br />
<br />
He wondered if the boars wanted him or Rick now?  He had his cock and balls back, but he still had a vagina, at least that&#39;s how it seemed.  He wondered if Rick had a vagina too.  He hadn&#39;t looked when he was in the pen, and he had absolutely no desire to go back in the pen.  For all he knew, he might absorb Rick&#39;s fat back, and end up trapped on the farm.  It seemed like he was thinking clearly for the first time in ages.  <br />
<br />
He walked back to where Rick lay snoring.  He needed clothing.  His body was dry now.  It was a hot dry day.  The jockstrap was a little damp.  Chad picked it up, and sniffed it.  It was his.  He wanted his jockstrap back, but he decided he&#39;d wash it first.  He pulled on Rick&#39;s jeans, but they were a tad long and tight.  He only buttoned the first three buttons of the fly, and rolled up the pant legs,  the boots were a tad tight too, so Chad left the socks off.  He wore the shirt unbuttoned, and shoved the jockstrap into the front pocket of the jeans, and dropped the stone into his shirt pocket.  He thought about calling for help, but Rick&#39;s phone was locked with facial recognition software, and if he took it, he might be tracked.  So he figured Rick&#39;s swollen face wouldn&#39;t work to unlock the phone, but he didn&#39;t want to risk Rick phoning for help, so he hurled the phone into a nearby copse of trees.<br />
<br />
Chad started walking toward the farmhouse. He searched Rick&#39;s pockets, and found some keys.  He saw the sticker on the window saying ARMED RESPONSE, and he could see the flashing alarm touch pad through the window.  He decided not to try it.  If Rick&#39;s pa got back here before Chad escaped, he might find himself naked back in the pig pen.  He put looked at the key ring, and walked over to Rick&#39;s motorcycle.  He&#39;d ridden on the back of a motorcycle before, but never driven on before.  He started up the bike, put the helmet on, and the next thing he knew he was picking gravel out of his clothing, and the motorcycle was lying with a bent front wheel next to a concrete wall. The motorcycle roared, sputtered, and went silent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oops,&quot; said Chad taking the helmet off, &quot;Guess, I&#39;ll walk.&quot;  He walked down the gravel path to the barbwire topped gate.</p>
