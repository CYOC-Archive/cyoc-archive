<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In a flash of white light, Ben was instanlty transported back to the entrance gate. He was about to lay a hand on the gate when suddenly he heard gods voice. &quot;In a time of great peril point your sword skyward and you shall receive aid.&quot; Ben, with his newly found courage, burst through the gate and was instantly greeted by the mistress of the island (second in command). &quot;BEN!&quot; she said with a snarling growl. &quot;HOW DARE YOU KILL THE MASTER!!&quot; She wailed at him, whilst reaching behind her. &quot;YOU WILL PAAAY!!&quot; Ben immediately reached for an arrow, and strung up his bow ready to fire. &quot;Tell you what, if u surrender here and now you&#39;ll be the last of the abomination in this place to feel the holy powers of god.&quot; With insane fury she pulls out a wicked sword with thorns that looked to have some red liquid on it and lunged at ben, swinging wildly. &quot;DIE DIE DIE!!&quot; She yelled as she hacked and slashed trying nothing more than her best to carve away at his flesh. But Ben, being stronger and more agile had avoided her mad salshes with little effert.<br />
<br />
Finaly her strength had diminished and could only stare at Ben with hatred in her eyes. With that Ben strung his bow once more and said &quot;Its over, with you gone the rest of the abominations should fade aswell.&quot; She forced out an exhausted laughter &quot;over?&quot; She exlaimed &quot;No, i dont think so, this feeble body was just a test, now the real fight begins.&quot; With the snap of her fingers, Ben saw shadowy figures form out of the thinness of the air. To his suprise he was now surrounded. As he stood there for a while thinking of what to do next, the figures began to take shape and formed into sick twisted demons of various types. Some were on all fours, some stood upright, others were flying but all were naked. Ben decided to take flight as there were too many to fight on foot. As he did, he looked down and saw the few that were able to fly came after him. Out of pure instinct he pulled out his sword and cut down the first, second and third demon. &quot;Only a couple of flying bugs left.&quot; He said as he pulled an arrow from his quiver, suddenly he felt somthing wrapping around his right leg. It was a chain with sadistic markings as red blood on it, the markings emitting a glow and Ben was pulled forcibly pulled back down. He tried cutting it off with his sword but to no avail. The demon on the other end chuckled as it said &quot;this chain cant be cut&quot; and gave the chain one last pull.<br />
<br />
Ben was surrounded again but this time he felt preparred. He glanced were the mistress stood, but she had vanished. The demon conitued to say. &quot; puney human prepare for a fate worse than death.&quot; The demon dropped the chain and charged at Ben and attempted to imaple him with the horns on its head. Ben was able to dodge it but was imideatly grabbed by another demon and thrown into the wall of a bar. The wall gave-way and he found himself laying on the floor in the center of the bar. The poeple in the bar watched him as he got up, some of wich gasped at the sight of his heavenly form. Ben got to his feet and said with haste &quot;This place is evil, youre souls will be devoured if you dont run-&quot; a scream rang out from a woman as she pionted behind him. A small grotesque demon entered the bar from the smashed wall. Without hesitation Ben stabbed the demon between the eyes and it burst into a cloud of thick black smoke. With terror and fear, everyone in the bar flooded out into the street only to find the other demons lying in wait. The demons didnt pay much attention to them but when one of the bigger demons reached out to grab a partialy transformed human trying to flee, a string of light burst through the wooden doors, dimalishing them and cut off its arm. It let out a shreeking howl as ben walked out of the bar. &quot;Damn you!&quot; Said the demon picking up its arm from the ground &quot;Ill have to return the favor&quot; it said reattaching its arm to its body. <br />
<br />
For hours Ben fought the demons until finaly there were two left. He slowly approached them with his holy sword gleaming in the partial moonlight. &quot;Not another step!&quot; Yelled a familiar voice. The demons stepped aside to reveal the mistress. &quot;There you are, hell hag. Time to put you were you belong.&quot; Said ben stringing his bow with another arrow. &quot; I wouldnt do that if i were you&quot; said the hag with a smirk on her face. &quot;Oh, and why is that?&quot; Said ben. She pointed towards the bar and said &quot;take a look for yourself.&quot; Ben turned and saw his friends Jeff and David who only had donkey ears and hooves for hands and feet. Their eyes went wide as they looked at Bens wings and halo. &quot;Don&#39;t worry guys, god is on our side!&quot; Ben said with a reasuring tone. The mistress gave a look at the demons holding Jeff and David, giving a nod. Ben took notice and looked back at them. The demons held his friends close to their unholy forms. He stood there frozen with same paralizing fear as when he saw them first transform into donkeys. Their legs had melted into the demons that were holding them hostage. &quot;AAAAAHH HELP US BEN!!&quot; Screamed Jeff at the top of his lungs. David who was ready to give up said with a whimper &quot;Ben.. please... save us.&quot; One of the demons chuckled menacingly &quot;dont worry, he too will join you.&quot; It said to david and he began to cry.  The demons stopped before they consumed what was left of his friends. Only their upper chests and heads were visable sticking out of the bastards own chests. &quot;What will you do now Ben?&quot; The mistress said clutching her sword in hand. &quot;I wont give up, I REFUSE TO GIVE UP!&quot; With that Ben pointed his sword high into the morning sky and from the tip of it flashed an immense holy light demolishing the four lesser demons, also realsing his freinds. &quot; BEN!&quot; They yelled in joyful happiness as well as in unison as they ran up to him, free of corruption and butt naked. &quot;What... how..&quot; david fumbled trying to ask what just happend when the mistress slowly stood up. It looked like an explosion went off right by her, for she was missing chuncks of flesh from her now deformed body. Still hanging on to her sword she screams with her charred vocal cords &quot;THIS ISN&#39;T OVEERR!&quot; She turns the sword on herself and pierces her blackend heart. &quot;Gugh.. Heheh.... I... win..&quot;  she said stamering backwords. The same thick black smoke that the demons were reduced to when Ben had killed them suddenly surrounded her and fused to her flesh creating...</p>
