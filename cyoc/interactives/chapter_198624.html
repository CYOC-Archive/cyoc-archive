<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Okay, good. Now this might be a bit unusual but I am certain you will both perform admirably. Now we make a lot of things here and the execs and stockholders are always clamoring for more money. So we are branching out. So we have been experimenting in... what you might call adult products.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, like alcohol or something?&quot; Angle asked, shifting in her chair causing her breasts to shift in her dress. She pulled a plain pen that had been tucked sexily on the top of her ear and took a few notes. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not exactly. Now the office you have been given has been fitted with the same glass I have here.&quot; Dave gestured to his glass walls which to everyone but him were frosted, preventing sight either way. &quot;The team was struggling with finding test subjects so you will have to do. Now hurry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Angel and Jasmine quickly got up, very surprised and made their way to their new office. A plaque was in place on the door of the next office down. &quot;The assistants to Dave --------&quot; <br />
<br />
Angel opened the door and gestured for Jasmine to go first. Jasmine acquiesced but frowned at the girl who was so clearly trying to suck up to the incumbent of the position. The opened a box on the left desk, the one tagged for Jasmine. Inside were many other smaller boxes but one had a note of read first. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please put on the paired wrist bands specially designed to aid in struggling marriages.&quot; <br />
<br />
They sighed and opened the box and pulled out two simple silver wrist bands. Shrugging Angel tried it on first and Jasmine didn&#39;t lag much behind.<br />
<br />
As Angel and Jasmine waited in their seats, examining their new office. They started to feel warm. &quot;Uh hey, do you think it would be okay if I took off my dress. I know its not proper but were both women and I am it is getting way to hot.&quot; asked Angel<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, do whatever you want.&quot; Jasmine felt the same thing but she was counting on someone to walk in and catch Angel undressed and get thrown out. <br />
<br />
As Dave watched through the actually transparent glass he frowned. Angel slid off her dress, her nipples erect in her bra and sweat running down her flushing face. She was wearing a sports bra and briefs under all that sexyness. A few quick strokes of his pen and Angel sighed at how hard she was going to land this job. She couldn&#39;t believe she put on lingerie to try to land the job. She really hated dressing like this. Just how much was visible made her very uncomfortable. Especially with Jasmine&#39;s eyes on her every moment waiting for a mistake.<br />
<br />
Jasmine just scoffed. The slut wearing that under her dress. It was getting hard for Jasmine to keep her outfit on but she wasn&#39;t going to lose this job. Dave was disappointed in the proceedings and sought to solve those issues with more frantic scribbling.<br />
<br />
Angel looked up smirking at her lingerie. She never had worn such sexy clothes before but needed every advantage she could get if someone as young as her was going to get a job at the prodigious corporation. Though she actually loved how sexy it made her feel and she honestly didn&#39;t think she would ever go another day without.<br />
<br />
Jasmine tore off her outfit and stocked over to the one of the boxes tearing it open. He mouth dropped open. It was a dildo but it looked incredibly real. In fact it also had a harness as well making it a strap on. It also had a part that would get inserted into the ass and a bit that would go into the vagina.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck!?&quot; Angel  walked over and was likewise horrified.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to get out.&quot; Angel quickly walked over and tried the now locked door. She was about to turn around when she felt something strange. Looking down she had put on the strap-on. She didn&#39;t remember when but she knew she couldn&#39;t help herself. It was just so sexy. She wanted to feel what her ex-boyfriend had felt as he plunged into her hot cunt as she played with her breasts. <br />
<br />
Dave was happy with his corrections watched as it progressed to plan. Jasmine was reclined on a new couch legs spread and eyes closed as she pounded away at her vagina. It was clear Angel was aroused as well, the semi- real strap-on actually harden even more and swelled in all dimensions slightly. <br />
<br />
In a haze of sex the relatively sexually inexperienced Angel stumbled over to her significantly more skilled co-worker who was currently occupied, Jasmine. Dave scribbled away as he released his hard penis from his pants, making small tweaks. <br />
<br />
Angel stepped up onto the massive mattress that had been a couch. In front of her was a blindfolded Jasmine. A woman she hadn&#39;t even know for 5 minutes but who was no in front of her trying to desperately sate her lust.<br />
<br />
The bracelets glowed with power as Angel positioned her penis in front of Jasmine&#39;s needy hole. Angel plunged in and as Jasmine gasped in pleasure it took everything she had not to respond with like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh god, I love your dick Dave.&quot; Angel loved how the small tip on the inside of the strap-on vibrated with every thrust, just as the attached buttplug did. She especially liked how debased her snotty coworker was. Getting off on getting fucked by her boss while her enemy fucked her instead.<br />
<br />
Jasmine&#39;s blindfold slid off during the commotion. Her eyes widened when she saw who was actually fucking her. But she couldn&#39;t bring herself to care, especially as Angel&#39;s smaller boobs bounced in the sexy bedroom wear and her penis kept pounding away.<br />
<br />
They both orgasmed loudly in the soundproofed room. It took a few moments to collect themselves before they cleaned themselves up.<br />
<br />
A note that they hadn&#39;t seen was now on the desk with their next task.</p>
