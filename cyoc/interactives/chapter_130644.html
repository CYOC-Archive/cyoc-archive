<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There were plenty of conversions going on at Horizon Labs. Most typically, they were new species being uplifted or converted, which naturally included all the volunteers for the three de-extinction projects. The next most likely place to occur was at the hospital, which was were volunteers for Project Phoenix were most likely to go, both to make sure their medical conditions don&#39;t cause a problem before conversion and to make sure their bodies were still healthy post-conversion.<br />
<br />
But an increasing amount of conversions were happening at home. The most common thing were for an Animalian converting a human lover to become a mate. But there needn&#39;t be a scientist or an Animalian involved, especially for couples who wanted to change alone. Once Miss Vivian had signed the check to pay for Woodrow and Carla Wolfe&#39;s conversion, all they had to do was go to Animalia Town Hall to get registered and set up. Finding a sponsor for their conversion was easy. Wolves were one of the most common Animalians around, thanks largely to the APD. It didn&#39;t take long before the Wolfes possessed a bottle that held enough wolf milk for a double-dose. They could have gotten to such bottles, but Woodrow and Carla had particular plans for how they were going to change.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Naturally, they planned to do their conversion on the night of the full moon. It wasn&#39;t every day you could play out your werewolf fantasy for real and considering conversions were a one-way street, this was their only chance to do it right. Woodrow and Carol had rented a cabin at Lover&#39;s Woods, specifically with a bedroom where the moonlight would be able to stream in without impediment. Of course, the tricky part was doing this roleplay without sounding like a cheesy romance novel.<br />
<br />
Woodrow looked out the window at the full moon with a dark look on his face. &quot;I can&#39;t stand by, anymore. They took everything from me: my home, my family, my lands. I have nothing left to lose while they continue to squeeze every last drop of fortune from the people they should be protecting,&quot; said Woodrow. His character was of a noble who had been robbed of his lands by rival lords. His family had been slaughtered and his home had been destroyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;My lord, please reconsider,&quot; said Carla, &quot;There has to be another way.&quot; Her character was a gypsy whose clan has suffered much by the hands of the cruel lords. She also had a close connection with the witch of her clan, who had been unjustly executed along with several of her people.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is no other way,&quot; said Woodrow, &quot;Without my money and lands, I nothing more than another peasant. The king cares not what happens in these backwoods and the judges will side with whoever can pay them the most. There is no justice to be gained as a man, so I must exact vengeance as a beast.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But once you take the potion, there is no going back,&quot; said Carla, &quot;You shall be a wolf for the rest of your days. Is it really worth giving up your humanity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is only humanity of the flesh that I stand to lose,&quot; said Woodrow, &quot;Those bastards have already surrendered the humanity of their souls, if they ever had them to begin with. I can wait no longer. Give me the potion.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carla seemed to hesitate before giving Woodrow the dark glass bottle that held the potion (really the wolf milk). &quot;What if you cannot control the beast?&quot; asked Carla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you must flee while you can,&quot; said Woodrow, &quot;The first victim of the wolf should not be you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I cannot leave you, my love,&quot; said Carla.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I hope my love for you is stronger the wolf&#39;s rage,&quot; said Woodrow before breaking character to ask, &quot;Was that too corny?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not vomit-inducing, but don&#39;t push it any further,&quot; said Carla, briefly letting her character slip, &quot;Just hurry and drink it before you get too hammy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Woodrow uncorked the bottle before quaffing down the contents. The milk didn&#39;t have the same richness as cow&#39;s milk. Not really something to put in one&#39;s tea or coffee. Even before he drank the last drop, he could feel the changes starting. The hairs on his arms were standing on edge as they grew denser. As he put the bottle down, his fingernails were getting sharper. The balding spot on his head was filling in with new brown hair as more hair grew on his face, his mustache becoming less distinct amidst the rest of the hair. Already his ears were growing pointed and his eyes becoming a more luminous brown than before.<br />
<br />
At this stage, Woodrow really looked like the class Lawrence Talbot-style Wolf-Man, a man with distinctly lupine features. But soon the lupine features started to overshadow the man&#39;s. His bare feet which had already grown claws were being forced upwards as his ankles lifted and forced him to walk on the balls of his feet, which were quickly becoming his new paws. The palms of his hands became rougher as they became padded like a wolf&#39;s paw as well. The brown fur was growing denser as well as more easily seen as Woodrow&#39;s shirt was being pulled tight. Rips were starting to appear as his muscles grew larger. With a snarl, he slashed the back of his pants to allow his growing tail to grow out. Woodrow grimaced as his face finished growing out into a muzzle, his teeth fully sharpening into fangs as his ears moved up to the top. The human feature left on his head was his brown hair, which thicker and longer than it had been before. Woodrow lifted his head and let out a loud howl.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you look better than I thought,&quot; said Carla, eying Woodrow up and down with naked desire.<br />
<br />
Woodrow looked at his new reflection. &quot;Well, it certainly lived up its promise,&quot; said Woodrow, flexing one arm. The act of doing that created more rips in his shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, are you going to keep all that to yourself?&quot; asked Carla in a suggestive manner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, right,&quot; said Woodrow before getting back into character, &quot;You see? I have control over the beast. My soul was never at risk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you can claim your vengeance upon the lords who wronged you,&quot; said Carla, also back in character.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, vengeance should not be just mine,&quot; said Woodrow, &quot;You can share in this gift as well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? But if I become a wolf...&quot; said Carla with false uncertainty.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of your clan is already gone, destroyed by those thieves who think themselves nobility. What remains will surely see the purity of what we do, of what we are. Join me, my love. Become my mate and we shall seek the justice denied to both of us as humans,&quot; said Woodrow.<br />
<br />
Carla pretended to hesitate a bit more before opening her shirt to bare her shoulders. &quot;Just be gentle,&quot; she said, acting being genuine here. Woodrow&#39;s new fangs looked rather sharp.<br />
<br />
&quot;As gently as possible,&quot; said Woodrow. He approached his wife and grasped her upper arms. Lowering his head down, he carefully nipped her left shoulder. He didn&#39;t bite deep, not wanting to harm her more than necessary, but he did lick the bleeding spots to make sure his saliva got in there.<br />
<br />
Carla made a soft moan as she felt the heat start to spread through her body. His brown skin was starting to become covered in black hairs. Her hands clench a bit as she felt them growing pads and claws. Her feet were already bare to avoid getting her new paws squashed inside shoes. At least her tail didn&#39;t have problems growing considering she was wearing a skirt. It definitely felt weird to have her face stretch forward to become a muzzle. As she felt her transformation reach its crest, Carla lifted her head and let out a howl.<br />
<br />
Woodrow looked up and down at his wife with approval, &quot;Now there&#39;s a proper she-wolf.&quot;<br />
<br />
Carla looked at herself in the mirror. Her black fur did look beautiful, especially in contrast with her now-golden eyes. She felt like her body could be in better shape, but that&#39;s what the next part was for. &quot;And this is only from a single dose,&quot; she said, giving Woodrow a not-so-subtle hint.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t wait to give you your second dose,&quot; said Woodrow as he tore open the front of his pants and his underwear. His canine cock emerged from its sheath, a clear 8 if not 9 inches between the tip and the knot.<br />
<br />
Carla&#39;s eyebrows shot up at that. &quot;My, what a big dick you have,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the better to fuck you with, my dear,&quot; crooned Woodrow.<br />
<br />
Carla couldn&#39;t resist her lust any longer. Her claws made quick work of the clothes she wore. She got on the bed, standing on her hands and knees with her tail lifted high. &quot;Show me what a big bad wolf you are,&quot; she said with a lustful growl.<br />
<br />
Woodrow shredded what little clothes were left on him before approaching his mate. He sniffed her wolf pussy, taking in the heady aroma before applying his canine tongue to it. Carla moaned appreciatively before Woodrow pulled away. He carefully lined up his cock to his wife&#39;s dripping hole. With one thrust, he was inside her.<br />
<br />
Carla crooned as Woodrow humped her, feeling his big dick stretching her out. As he thrust, she could feel the other changes happening. The growing ache she had felt the last few years faded away. She could feel her muscles burning with energy as they became stronger, more defined. The unwanted fat was melting away from her body. She gave a bit of a yip as her breasts started bouncing harder from Woodrow&#39;s thrusting. They were growing larger, rising higher. Carla&#39;s tongue lolled out of her mouth which was wearing a happy dog grin. She feel Woodrow&#39;s knot bumping her lower lips until it finally pushed past them. Carla yelped as she gripped the quilt. She could feel Woodrow taking up all the space inside her and his hot rod was pushing her to the edge. His frantic thrusting told her he was reaching his peak as well. Finally, both wolves let out a howl as Woodrow erupted inside Carla, spewing hot spunk deep into her body.<br />
<br />
Woodrow and Carla laid down on the bed to cuddle. They didn&#39;t have much of a choice seeing how Woodrow was knotted inside Carla. Woodrow panted a bit before saying, &quot;So, was that as good as your fantasy, Mrs. Wolfe?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Better than that,&quot; said Carla, &quot;I guess those romance werewolf books were onto something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe, though I guess we can&#39;t get too wild. We do need to report to the Boutique for work in the morning,&quot; said Woodrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you out of your gourd?&quot; asked Carla, &quot;After what we just had? Besides, Miss Vivian would know better than anyone what we&#39;ll be doing all night. She&#39;ll understand if we have a day off first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well in that case...&quot; said Woodrow before reaching over and feeling Carla&#39;s bigger breasts, making her moan. &quot;My, what big tits you have,&quot; said Woodrow.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the better to nurse you with, my dear,&quot; crooned Carla. This was going to be a long and wild night.</p>
