<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Susan sighed as she went over her schedule, being David&#39;s secretary was sometimes not worth it.<br />
<br />
David, being a middle manager, had several people working underneath him including his personal secretary Susan. When Susan had gotten this job she had high hopes of moving further in the company. She had started right after David had been promoted. At the time David was seen as a fast riser, someone who would be making waves in the future. Now, 10 years later, a now 35 year old Susan felt she would be forever stuck answering David&#39;s phone.<br />
<br />
Then the most unexpected thing happened. David had returned from his meeting with Dr. Dunn looking like a college student, a very fit college student. David smiled at a gawking Susan, flexing a bicep that strained the raven haired man&#39;s business jacket. &quot;Hold my calls Susan,&quot; he grinned, running a hand through his thick raven hair as he entered his office.<br />
<br />
For the next hour Susan took messages, constantly gazing at David&#39;s door as she wondered how he had done that? David had looked fantastic. A handsome youthful face with thick raven hair and an obviously strong body. Susan had be daydreaming about the young man. David could be a jackals but their was no denying that he was handsome, even at 4o with a touch of grey. Now though, he looked like a young and verile young man. Fantasies of being David&#39;s personal Mrs. Robinson made the woman flush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Susan I need you!&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan shook herself from her stupor. David only called her if it was important. Maybe, thw young man wanted to try out his new body with an older woman. Still, something bothered her. Had David&#39;s voice sounded higher?<br />
<br />
Smoothing her blouse Susan now made her way towards the office. Taking a deep breath, she now composed herself as she opened the door only to gasp in shock. &quot;David?!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was David just a much younger version. The boy in front of her couldn&#39;t be more than 13 or 14. David&#39;s business suit hanging on his now lanky body. The boys face now round and childish as he fearfully gazed at her. &quot;Somethings wrong,&quot; the boy squeaked as he held his arms out. &quot;I&#39;m getting younger!&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan now approached him, finding David had lost a few inches in height. Susan stood at 5&#39;5&quot;, average height for a woman while David stood at an average 5&#39;9&quot;. She had grown so accustomed to looking slightly up that it shocked her to find herself eye to eye with the boy. &quot;What do you mean younger,&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It means I&#39;m getting younger woman,&quot; he yelled. As he did he now shrank another inch or two. David now sitting firmly on the line between teen and preteen. &quot;Damn it it&#39;s still happening,&quot; he cried, his voice cracking. &quot;Look at me I&#39;m what 12! 13!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Susan said softly. &quot;Just relax. Tell me how this happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax,&quot; David exclaimed. &quot;How am I supposed to relax! Look at me!&quot; David now glared up at his secretary, raising his hand as he began to bark orders. &quot;Dont tell me to relax! Call Ethan Dunn NOW!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
As David began to yell, Susan watched as the boy began to grow younger once more. Slowly David&#39;s hand began to recede into his jacket, the material eventually dangling a few inches off his smaller hand. Susan watched the boy seeming to melt into his business suit. David grew smaller, his face rounding as his collar began to grow larger around his skinny neck. As David hit 10 his pants lost hold of his narrow hips, snaking their way down his pencil thin legs. &quot;NOooo,&quot; he whimpered.<br />
<br />
Susan gazed at the rather cute elementary school boy with a mix of pity and motherly love. Susan had never been very maternal, but those feelings were now beginning to surface. Placing her hand on the boys shoulder she nowbtried to guide him towards his chair. David stepped out of his massive shoes and pants as the boy now sat, his eyes growing wide as he realized his sock covered feet barely grazed the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh its okay Davey,&quot; she soothed. David now cast her an incredulous look, he wasn&#39;t a little kid he was her boss. &quot;It will not be okay Susan call Ethan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No need to yell Davey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;STOP CALLING ME DAVEY!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
David began to whimper once more as he began to grow younger yet again. Leaving behind double digits, David grew smaller, his face rounding as his legs shrank further away from the floor. Now only 6 years old Susan gave the adorable boy a maternal look as she now picked him up and placed him on his desk. &quot;Hey what are you doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Its easier to see you when your higher up baby,&quot; Susan said with a warm smile. &quot;I&#39;m not a baby,&quot; David pouted, folding his arms across his chest. Susan couldn&#39;t help but chuckle, he looked like a little boy trying on his daddies work clothes. Eyeing the boys sock covered feet an impish smirk crossed the womans face. Susan had realized that David&#39;s tantrums seemed to dictate when he regressed. She now wanted to try an experiment to prove her theory. Grabbing the extra material hanging off David&#39;s small feet she now began to pull.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey what are you doing,&quot; David exclaimed in alarm as Susan pulled his socks off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Testing something,&quot; she said. Grabbing David&#39;s small feet she now began to tickle him, watching as the small boy began to squirm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop that tickles,&quot; he laughed. Susan now watched carefully, a smirk crossing her face as David grew younger yet again.<br />
<br />
&quot;No don&#39;t,&quot; David said weakly as he became 5. &quot;I&#39;m getting littler Susan. Call Ethan!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In a moment,&quot; Susan grinned as she began to tickle David yet again. David squirmed, the boy pleading for his secretary to stop as he crept closer to toddlerhood. &quot;Stawp it Suzwen,&quot; the 4 year old lisped. &quot;I gettin smaw wer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Susan grinned maliciously. David&#39;s eyes growing wide in fear as he desperately tried to get away. Unfortunately the toddlers clothes now effectively restrained him, David&#39;s tiny 3 year old body completely swamped by his adult business suit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know David,&quot; Susan said softly. &quot;You&#39;ve always been a real jerk. Acting like some alpha male. Threatening people. Hell, you haven&#39;t given me anything for my birthday or even Christmas in years. You treat people like dogs. I wonder if you were always such a prick.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I boss,&quot; the 2 year old David lisped, watching as his tiny feet now disappeared underneath his huge business jacket. &quot;I boss! You mean Suzwen!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats mommy little boy,&quot; Susan grinned, watching as David hit a year old. David&#39;s collar now rested around his shoulders, the boys body threatening to emerge from his shirt like some odd birth. Susan watched as the boy began to cry harder, David&#39;s dark hair thinning, his teeth vanishing into his gums. David&#39;s age could now be measured in monthes, as the boy cried harder. Finally his business suit fell away, pooling around the now naked 6 month old infant.<br />
<br />
Susan now picked up the baby. David was so light, probably less than 20 lbs as she began to soothe the boy. David quivered for a moment, before settling into a peaceful slumber. &quot;Its okay baby mommy&#39;s got you,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Now, let&#39;s go thank Ethan.&quot;</p>
