<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mark woke with a start. Apparently he had fallen asleep during the change so Mommy let him rest but as the doorbell rang and the mystery guests arrived Mommy&#39;s brisk walk shook him awake. It was Mommy&#39;s best friend, neighbor and smoking hot 25-year old blonde, blue eyed preschool teacher Brianne. Mark remembered back when he was an adult, how Jess was basically an older mentor to the young, sexy, athletic, but also really shallow, dumb and submissive girl. She had a Master&#39;s degree in Ballet Theory and Practice, but deep down everyone knew (especially her) that her mind was only good for babies. She never could find a job after she graduated from the conservatory at 22, and so the story goes, she got tired of seeing all the sluts around her age and younger with 3, 4 and 5 kids while they sit on welfare, so she found a handsome father from the private pre-school she worked at and decided to make a baby of her own. <br />
<br />
The man she chose was a successful 45-year old car dealer named Rick McKenna, a soft-hearted man who had an on/off marriage with his wife, which was, unfortunately back on again for Brianne. Brianne had gossiped in detail to Jesse over the phone as Mark listened raptly to stories of how she seduced him gradually over the better part of a year, sabotaged a Costco-sized box of condoms and drugged him with a nasal nano-spray to massively increase his sperm count, productivity and potency. They went from fucking the first time in a car in a covered parking lot because he was so paranoid of being caught, to fucking openly in her closed, locked and soundproof office for nearly two years. Brianne was able to get her 18 month old daughter Sydney from it, but she was caught when Rick&#39;s other daughter 2.5 year old Kerrie complained Daddy was taking too long to take her home after school and her Mom came down there and caught him adjusting his pants as the door opened, weakly pretending to thank Brianne for &quot;a nice, long, insightful conversation&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was basically a dead giveaway what was going on, because Rick had done the right thing from the second Sydney was born, signing the birth certificate and giving Sydney his last name even long before he was discovered. Brianne also wasn&#39;t shy about telling Kerrie about her sister, although she never said anything about her father directly, she always told Kerrie that &quot;even though Sydney is my daughter, she&#39;s your sister because you have the same last name.&quot;  Brianne was fired from the preschool when the parents put her bosses under pressure because suddenly all those moms were enraged to see the young gorgeous blonde poaching away a father - that thought terrified those &quot;professional&quot; and &quot;successful&quot; but also ugly, middle aged and over the hill women. What good would all their success be if they couldn&#39;t keep a man?<br />
<br />
Rick had thoughtfully purchased the apartment next door for Brianne and transferred it to her before all this happened, but he was now banned from there except for 30 minutes a week to visit Sydney. He was required to make a video of what he did while he was there to ensure he wasn&#39;t still fucking Brianne. The effects of this was highly destructive to Sydney&#39;s psyche. Her daddy and sister were now out of her life, and because Brianne had to find another job (no other private preschools wanted to hire her) Brianne forced her off the tit, cold turkey. The now 2-year old Sydney was feeling abandoned and betrayed by the two people she loved most, her mom and dad.<br />
<br />
Mark had already wanted to help them out - but as he peeked his head out of the boob tent perch and drank in the sight of her, he was in love. Brianne was an absolutely perfect long-haired blonde statuesque beauty with the deepest ocean colored eyes. The type of beauty she had was largely amplified by her relative youth but he was certain that she would remain beautiful with time. Sydney on the other hand looked like she had the potential for beauty (definitely good genes) but she looked stressed and unhappy. She looked tired, as though she was crying non-stop for a long time. When Mark was an adult he always gave Jesse space and never really wanted to intrude into her friendships, but now he deeply regretted it. Mark remembered that Jesse had suggested to him to father Brianne&#39;s baby, but he was always thinking it was a trick to test his faithfulness and he loved Jesse too much to risk it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Brianne would stay over tonight.&quot; he started, with coin in hand, Mark resolved that he would fulfill Sydney&#39;s wishes first and then fulfill his own. &quot;I wish that Brianne would unwean Sydney, and give her titty on demand. I wish Rick&#39;s wife would let Sydney have lots of time with her father and sister at his house so I can have time alone with Brianne.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly out of nowhere the buxom beauty popped open her blouse. &quot;My tits have been aching non-stop since I weaned Syd 6 months ago Jess, I can&#39;t take it anymore! I miss her so much. I miss how close we were! Now she is so mad at me because she misses her daddy and her milk. I can at least give her milk even if I lost her daddy.&quot;<br />
<br />
The red-eyed baby looked up at me, tear-faced sadness seemingly swept away by a victorious smile. Suddenly a ring of the doorbell revealed Rick, his 35-year old wife Susan (head of a major law firm) and their 3-year old Kerrie. <br />
<br />
Brianne got up quickly, Sydney still nursing as Brianne waved and said, &quot;Hi...guys&quot; not quite knowing what to say.<br />
<br />
Susan was all business with short black hair but that kind of butchy look seemed to camouflage a beauty that it seems Susan was embarrassed to show off as though it would make her less professional. Susan was visibly upset about something and after what seemed like a few minutes Susan finally spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen Brianne, I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot of things. I don&#39;t think you know this yet, but my husband has brain cancer. I don&#39;t know how long he has or what&#39;ll happen, but I do know he loves you, and he loves your daughter. And I also know I have to keep my firm open, or we&#39;re going to be broke as well as having lost my husband. So I have a proposal - move in to our house with Sydney. If you help me take care of my family from Monday to Friday and then come back here on the weekend, I will let you carry on your relationship on 3 conditions. 1, don&#39;t fuck him when I&#39;m there, 2, don&#39;t fuck him in my bed and 3, let my Kerrie have the tit along with Sydney - she&#39;s been quite angry since I weaned her, and it must be good with how Sydney is attacking the tit there.&quot;<br />
<br />
All Brianne could say was &quot;Mmmm-hmmm,&quot; before Rick came up and hugged his daughter peppering her with kisses.<br />
<br />
About an hour later I was put in a playpen with Kerrie and Sydney and as I laid down for a nap she cuddled up next to me and gave me drooling kisses to my head and face. Sydney&#39;s eyes shone blue like her mother. I rubbed her back to help her sleep and she gave me a loving kiss right on my lips. She was clearly in love with Baby Marky. Suddenly as I sniffed the air I realized - I smelled like poopoo!<br />
<br />
As Brianne got ready for bed that night, I got to nurse with her and the girls and Brianne changed me lovingly and that wasn&#39;t even the best part. The best part was when Brianne actually put the boob tent on correctly and it was actually like a baby hammock. I rocked to sleep suspended from her luscious tits while I had Sydney and Kerrie fighting for my affections. MMM...the thought of sisters of any age fighting over me was extremely satisfying.</p>
