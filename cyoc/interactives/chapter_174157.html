<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three years had passed since Kellie, Jack, and their friends had won the War of the Timelines. While their lives had been peaceful, things were not exactly quiet.<br />
<br />
Magic was commonplace in Kellies timeline. Anthros, kitsune, dragons, and all manner of magical creatures now coexisted with mortals. While mortals and magical beings lived together relatively peacefully, it didn&#39;t mean that their weren&#39;t problems from time to time.<br />
<br />
Some mortals were not as accepting of magic as others. The so called One Humanity, was a human only rights group that often came into conflict with magical beings. Kellie and Jack had some dealings with this group, quickly seeing them for what they were a hate group.<br />
<br />
Magical beings were also problematic at times. Nekomata were involved with gangsters, Dragons maneuvered their ways into powerful positions accumulating insane wealth at the cost of others, Liches were openly hostile to mortals, giving the undead a bad name despite the mummies best efforts. For Kellie and Jack it seemed that even with magic now prevalent in the world the same problems that existed before magic continued to exist.<br />
<br />
Kellie though had to say that despite all of these problems, things were going well. The young woman had moved into a position of responsibility, taking over many of Merlin&#39;s duties as he moved into semi retirement. Jack had done the same, operating Circes amusement park as the three witches now spent more time behind the veil. Today though the two young wizards were untied as they now saw their youngest daughter off to her first day of high school.<br />
<br />
Ann Pendragon, sole survivor of a now erased timeline and daughter of Jack and Kellie, was returning to high school. The time refugee had returned to childhood shortly after her arrival in this timeline. Since then she had grown close with some of the other magical children that resided here. Zack, Mia, Winery, Pryyha, Faye, her sister Terumi, and Drake all now called Ann a friend. Couple that with this timelines Jackie and Gloria and Ann was finally beginning to think if this timeline as home.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are you excited,&quot; Kellie asked as they now pulled up to the school. Ann shrugged, gazing out at the school as anthros, mortals, and other magical beings milled around outside. &quot;I guess,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;I mean technically over done this before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Jack stated. &quot;But I&#39;m pretty sure high school didnt look like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann chuckled softly as she now watched an anthro tiger football player flirt with a Nekomata and her Tanuki friend. &quot;Yeah this is definitely a little different dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Kellie smiled. &quot;Your going to do fine. I mean, Wests nickname is Magic High.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann nodded, Kellie was right, their hometown was practically ground zero for magic. The town was so accepting of magical beings that things were peaceful for the most part.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann relax,&quot; Jack smiled. &quot;Just be yourself, you&#39;ll do fine.&quot; Ann gave her father a nod, exiting the car as her parents waved.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont forget to tell Akira I said hi,&quot; Kellie yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Akira,&quot; Ann asked in genuine surprise. Kellie smirked, giving Ann a knowing wink as they now drove off.<br />
<br />
For the most part Ann&#39;s day went off without any issues. The first few classes were unremarkable but at least she had her friends with her. By third period all of the incoming freshmen found themselves in the auditorium for orientation. Ann quickly scanned the auditorium spotting Mia, Jackie, Faye, and Gloria. &quot;Hey guys,&quot; Ann smiled as she took a seat. &quot;Where the others?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Over there,&quot; Mia frowned, gesturing towards a group of students. Ann looked over seeing Zack, Winery, Pryyha, and several other popular students. <br />
<br />
&quot;Since when did Zack start hanging out with the jocks,&quot; Jackie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right around the time he started dating Winery and joined the football team,&quot; Mia sulked. &quot;Ugh she gets on my nerves, always nitpicking what Zacks doing. I swear she even had him change his wardrobe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It cant be that bad,&quot; Faye said as she flitted between the group. Mia raised an eyebrow as she now scowled at the wolf princess. &quot;Oh its bad,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;When I went to remind Zack about seeing Yuki after school Winery tried to pull him away. Something about hanging out with her and the other rich kids afterschool. He knows damn well we were supposed to check on Yuki today. It&#39;s her first day of preschool!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ann rubbed her neck sheepishly as she watched the young witchling seethe. Zack was Mia&#39;s best friend but it was pretty obvious she had a crush on the young werewolf. &quot;Try not to start a fight with Winery again please,&quot; she sighed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey that fight at summer camp was her fault,&quot; Mia replied defensively. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not the way I remember it,&quot; Faye teased. &quot;Besides you two are friends.&quot; Before Mia could respond the students were called to attention by the principal. <br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome new students,&quot; the principal said. As the principal now welcomed the new students, Ann now found herself people watching. The class was definitely diverse, a fairly even breakdown between mortals and magical beings. Watching her friends Ann worried what the love triangle of Mia, Winery, and Zack would affect everyone&#39;s friendships. She liked all three and really didnt want to take a side.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now class,&quot; the principal stated. &quot;I would like to introduce to you our new head of security. Mr. Akira.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mia, Ann, Gloria, and Jackie&#39;s jaws dropped as they now watched the five tail kitsune step on stage. Akira was now dressed in a custom charcoal suit, the kitsune narrowing his eyes as he looked out at the incoming freshmen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you know Akira was working here,&quot; Ann whispered.<br />
<br />
&quot;He never said anything to me,&quot; Mia said in awe. As the group of freshmen now stared at the stage they realized &#39;Magic High&#39; was going to be interesting this year.</p>
