<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I... I...&quot; Jeff stared at his hand, which had gotten somewhat larger, grown black fur, and lost its human nails to sharp brown claws. &quot;Uh...&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t notice the fur filling out over his whole body, black and orange stripes forming under his clothes and over his face, white fluff running from under his chin down his front. He <i>did</i> notice his body start to bulk up -- because suddenly his clothes were tight and getting tighter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well don&#39;t just <i>stand</i> there, you idiot!&quot; hissed Veronica. &quot;Come inside!&quot;<br />
<br />
To add emphasis to her words, she tugged on his arm. A few moments before, she would have jerked him inside; Veronica was tall for a girl and a good athlete on top of everything else. But Jeff&#39;s increased muscle mass was now too much for her to budge him. Fortunately her words registered enough for him to follow the motion. Though he tripped as his feet shifted and burst through his shoes, leaving him to sprawl on the carpet beyond the door.<br />
<br />
Veronica quickly closed the door, praying to the Universe that nobody had seen the dolt. Then she turned to watch, eyes sparkling, as the nondescript young man finished turning into a muscular anthro tiger. She had seen this a hundred times in her imagination, but it was something else to have it happen on the front room floor.<br />
<br />
Jeff&#39;s clothes quickly followed his shoes, seams giving out with satisfying (to Veronica, anyway) <i>riiiips</i>, leaving him naked. A long, limber tail poked up from his butt, twitching in the air. His hair had changed from blond to black, to match his pelt, and his blue eyes had turned a tawny yellow. Eyes that now blinked up at Veronica in confusion as he rolled onto his back, subconsciously shifting to let his tail slide out to the side.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to me?&quot; he asked in a deep, throaty voice that made him sound confident despite himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;You changed!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Why the fuh- fudge didn&#39;t you <i>tell</i> me you were a weretiger!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I&#39;m not!&quot; he protested. &quot;I have no idea -- wait, tiger!?&quot; He looked down at himself, then gave a startled cough as he saw his exposed sheath and balls, clapping massive padded hands over them. &quot;Sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t be. In fact, I want to see it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-&quot; His hands lifted away from his crotch, coming up to fold behind his head. A sexy smirk played across his thin black lips. &quot;Oh? Like what you see, babe?&quot;<br />
<br />
<i>Wait, what?</i> For a moment Jeff had lost his voice -- or at least, the voluntary ability to use it. Then a stab of fear chilled his heart as he remembered the settings on the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
<i>Body.<br />
<br />
Actions.<br />
<br />
THOUGHTS.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Very much.&quot; She knelt down, stroking her fingers over his soft sac, and up his sheath. A rumbling growl came from the massive chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, babe... you sure know how to treat a guy...&quot; Behind the confident words, Jeff was panicking. He was even starting to <i>feel</i> like a big feline... jock? Warrior? Alpha male? Not like himself, for sure!<br />
<br />
What had he gotten himself into!?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you have <i>no</i> idea...&quot; she said deviously. Then she looked up, curiosity overcoming her lust for the moment. &quot;So, if you&#39;re not a weretiger... then how do you explain this?&quot;<br />
<br />
With the question, the strange sense of losing control to another, dominant personality abated a bit, and in a more Jeff-like voice he answered, &quot;I um... wait! It&#39;s gotta be that thing!&quot; He looked around, then reached towards where the Chronivac emitter had come to rest on the carpet.<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Oh.</i>&quot; She walked over and picked it up. &quot;This is what you were talking about, then... <i>Amazing.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
Fortunately the device was quite sturdy and falling a few feet onto a carpet had done it no harm. Veronica switched it on, and her eyes lit up even more as she saw the default options on the ten slots.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jeff&#39;s mind -- freed from the tiger-man thoughts for now -- was racing. He wasn&#39;t the smartest mind of his generation, but he wasn&#39;t stupid either -- when he bothered to think. And he was starting to realise both what he had actually set the Chronivac up to do, and <i>why</i> he had turned into an anthro tiger.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait...&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Are you a... a furry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, still riveted on the machine. And she assumed that Jeff was too -- thinking that he had deliberately done this to himself. He soon disillusioned her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh great,&quot; he groaned. &quot;My girlfriend is an animal-loving freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<I>Excuse</i> me?&quot; Her eyes snapped to him, suddenly filled with outrage. &quot;First off, I&#39;m <i>not</i> your girlfriend. Secondly, I am <i>not</i> a freak.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, of course not babe.&quot; Jeff winced internally at the words his new alter-ego used. &quot;I&#39;m...&quot; The confident tone petered out. Apparently even his tiger persona couldn&#39;t figure out how to get his foot out of his mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;How about <i>&#39;sorry?&#39;</i>&quot; she prompted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, sorry.&quot; He felt himself blushing.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, hmm... if you&#39;re not a furry, then why turn into one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t! I mean...&quot; he swallowed. &quot;I set the device to turn me into whatever you thought was sexy. I... I didn&#39;t realise you, um... <i>liked</i> handsome guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was <i>not</i> what he had meant to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh. <i>Ohhhhh.</i>&quot;<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t like the way her exclamation trailed off into an evil chuckle, either. But his tiger mind interpreted that as a good sign -- that she was into him and willing to forgive his human half&#39;s indiscretion. Had either side known what was really behind the return of her devious smirk, Jeff would have grabbed the emitter and bolted before it was too late.<br />
<br />
Because furrification was just the beginning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever I find sexy, hmmm? I wonder...&quot;<br />
<br />
She came back to squat between his legs, sliding the emitter into a pants pocket for now. She began diligently rubbing at his loins again. While her flirtations were mostly for show -- her parents being strait-laced -- she did have <i>some</i> experience with boys, and it wasn&#39;t long before a bumpy feline penis was standing proud above his belly.<br />
<br />
The rumbling growl-purr returned. While this was weird and... almost creepy for Jeff, he had to admit it felt really good. So he didn&#39;t mind the tigrine takeover, and just relaxed for the ride...<br />
<br />
...Only, something was starting to feel off. &quot;Ohhhhh...&quot; <i>The fuck? Is my voice higher?</i> The sensation of her fingers over his cock was getting more intense, but it seemed like there was less and less there. And his balls... were they... pulling into his body...?<br />
<br />
&quot;What the...&quot; He tilted his head down, only to have his view of his crotch obstructed by several white mounds. He blinked at them, his mind oddly fuzzy. Veronica&#39;s fingers were starting to feel <i>sooooo gooooood</i> as they slipped in and out of him, playing with his tiny, hyper-sensitive cock.<br />
<br />
<i>Something isn&#39;t right here...</i> Both his minds were in agreement, but he was just too horny to interfere in Veronica&#39;s ministrations, even as he felt his body gripping at her invading hand in a way it <I>really shouldn&#39;t have been able to do.</i><br />
<br />
&quot;Ohhh Veronica I feel so... so...&quot; He couldn&#39;t put a word to it, but his body was heating up. There was a need to be touched. A need to be filled. &quot;Wh-whatever you&#39;re doing...&quot; he groaned in his husky feminine voice, &quot;keep d-doing it... ah... AH...!&quot;<br />
<br />
With a contralto roar, his black-lipped pussy squeezed around Veronica&#39;s hand, femcum squirting over her arm. Panting, he sat up, feeling new weights on his chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha...&quot; He reached up, giving one of the mounds a squeeze. The jolt of pleasure finally woke him from the spell he&#39;d been under. &quot;WHAT THE HELL?&quot;<br />
<br />
He stared down in horror at the four breasts on his much smaller, much trimmer, much more <i>female</i> torso. At the broad expanse of his haunches, covered with smooth fat now instead of bulging muscle. At the cock that <i>should</i> have been there... but wasn&#39;t. He couldn&#39;t see what <i>was,</i> past the boobs, but he had a horrible suspicion.<br />
<br />
Then he looked up at Veronica&#39;s face. She was licking female tiger juice from her fingers, but stopped to give the tigress a devilishly &quot;feline&quot; grin of her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you&#39;d turn into whatever I think is sexy. And I think that my touch reducing big, strong, confident guys to squirming, submissive sluts is <i>very</i> sexy. Glad to see it works like you said.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stood up, stretching, Jeff following the movement with wide eyes. Despite the fact that she was still technically bigger than Veronica, with sharp claws and fangs, the human girl&#39;s presence seemed to fill the room. And it was all Jeff could do not to cower back from her.<br />
<br />
&quot;But enough games. It&#39;ll be hours before my parents get home from work; so I&#39;ve time to see what this baby can <i>really</i> do.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pulled the emitter out of her pocket. The default ten options all met her needs -- for the moment, though she hummed in disappointment that there were no more... exotic... selections available as she adjusted it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh well,&quot; she muttered. &quot;This should still be fun...&quot; She turned the device on herself, and hit &quot;Save.&quot;</p>
