<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty studied the picture of Gavin ad Kai for a minute as Kai studied Ty from behind… In the non-perverted way, of course. He noticed Gavin was larger than Kai, and a bit hairier too. Ty though he was also incredibly strong and obviously outgoing, since he was in a speedo flexing his arms whilst his son Kai was in a normal bathing suit and a tank top with his arms crossed. Ty also noticed that Kai was smiling, which he though ol' Poker Face Kai was incapable of doing; he must have been having a fun day with his dad. There were a few thoughts rolling through Ty’s head, most of them commenting on Gavin's, but mostly on Kai's physic. He thought they were sure impressive, especially since those two were probably all natural in the muscle department. Ty figured all the guy Tiger-thingies had built up figures like theirs. He quickly shook those thoughts from his head before they developed into something a bit risque, the last thing he needed to do was 'go camping' in Kai's house.<br />
<br />
“Are you okay Ty? You seem nervous.” Kai asked as he approached Ty; as if Ty needed a large guy to loom over him when he was already fidgety.<br />
<br />
“Uhno! I’m fine! Like pine. Or somethin’.” Ty quickly responded as he waved off Kai, signaling him to step away and give him some personal space.<br />
<br />
“... Pine? Well, if you say so, please just concentrate. I am sure my father has been through enough mishaps already…” Kai said, making Ty a bit more uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, this discomforting pressure made Ty really focus on what he should be doing and what should be shaped like what. Ty began taking small mental notes here and there about Gavin’s body, on the count of this not being a “grow and wait” procedure.<br />
<br />
-There’s the height of this dude, which I figure is about 6’10” to 7’.<br />
-Then there’s the mass of this guy, which I assume is around three hundred pounds, not a smidgen of it seems to be fat either.<br />
-The definition of his eight-packed abdomen and chest are so… wow… I have to be careful with these parts... His chest is probably 60 inches and that waist of his can’t be too far behind… I’m guessing 36 inches…<br />
-His arms… Uh they’re pretty massive too… The biceps are about 23 or more inches around… The forearms are about 17 or so inches…<br />
-The thighs have got to be around 30 inches and those shapely calves gotta be 20 or so inches…<br />
-There’s also the hair to count in, I guess it isn’t a crazy amount. Short shaggy hair on his head, lotsa body hair aaaand I guess some goes ‘down there’ too.<br />
-That face… Mmm… That should be easy, I mean, his skin is just a little too… Ew… Saggy. The neck under that handsome lil thing is 19 inches around? Maybe… More? Bah! I'll wing it!<br />
-I think that’s about it… Urg… I should’ve written this down on paper…<br />
<br />
Ty almost pulled his hair out over this one since he didn’t want to mess up. He wasn’t too familiar with a body like this, nor did he want to make Kai’s dad look like a disproportioned freak. Which probably wouldn't be much better than being a double for ever-so-bony Crypt Keeper. He knew Kai was watching and Kai was probably expecting a lot out of him, especially after all the boasting Ty had done earlier.<br />
<br />
Ty closed his eyes to concentrate, then opened them, revealing glowing emeralds for irises. With that, the Skeleton began to change ever so slightly. At first, one would assume nothing was happening. But upon closer inspection, one would notice the slight changes in Gavin’s appearance. The man’s skin was tightening and darkening, followed by tiny follicles of hair forming in the now-stable pores covering the man’s body and head. Beads of sweat could be seen forming before they slowly rolled over Gavin’s body.<br />
<br />
Next was the height, which should be about three feet added onto the short thing that was Kai’s father. The stretching of the man’s skeletal frame made him clench his teeth as air seethed out from his altering form. It must’ve painful to have previously stagnant joints, muscles and ligaments stretch along with the underused bone structure. A minute or so passed before Gavin’s reached his old stature. The bed he rested in seemed to be the right size now, length wise that is. The clothes he wore seemed like a belly shirt and a pair of hot pants, almost like something a normal gal would wear for pajamas.<br />
<br />
Then came the hardest part, Ty had to reshape his muscular structure since his current one was totally askew and could not be used to support his old muscles. It wasn’t exactly a hard task, rather, getting the extremely precise definition of Gavin’s previously chiseled body was. First Ty had to build up the mass, which surely there was a lot of it. Ty didn’t know where to start, but usually starting from the bottom and working your way up would work for most building projects- so why not this?<br />
<br />
Gavin’s calf muscles, along with all the muscles in his thigh began ballooning out until a choir of grunts, pants and sounds of tearing attire rang out. The groin and hip area was easy, since it just needed to be widened slightly followed by some muscle mass in the buttocks and the pelvis parts, along with the lower abdomen. The balloon effect kept spreading throughout Gavin’s body, making the man to become ecstatic which caused him to pant, groan and sweat bullets. His chest looked silly, taking the form of a halved barrel whilst his abdomen was just a flat plate of muscle that could no longer be covered by that raggedy shirt-vest of his. His neck widened a bit and his face seemed to fill out more – becoming broader and more masculine like it looked in the picture. Ty even made sure to add the goatee he had before moving onto the final phase.<br />
<br />
Ty approached the bed a bit more to view his handiwork so far. He was quite satisfied with what he saw, not only because Gavin was beginning to look like himself, this Tiger’s furriness or hairiness or whatever it’d be called… Was what Ty always pictured a Tiger Whozawhatzit should look like. Besides that, there was still a generous amount of extra fat that seemed to have blown up with the muscle around his body, so he’d deal with that next. The extra bulk tore the front of the shirt he wore open, turning it into a makeshift vest of sorts, while the slightly baggy shorts he wore were now like tattered boxer briefs. But before Ty got to work, he glanced over his shoulder to see Kai, and was surprised how calm he seemed. Ty thought Kai would be happy or excited or something to see his father being returned to normal, not to mention the sight of it all happening was something spectacular and slightly awkward. But nope, the young Tiger just had his generic mask on, eying Ty as Ty eyed him… Not unsettling at all!<br />
<br />
Ty touched Gavin’s stomach with his finger and began tracing around the flat slab. The flat slab reacted by caving in where it was touched, forming a mighty eight pack of sorts; an inhumanly solid core, if you will. After Ty got a hang of defining Gavin’s muscles manually, he figured he should do it without contact to speed up the process. Especially since Gavin seemed to be much sweatier than Ty had expected. His pectoral muscles ballooned forth from his deformed chest, slowly shaping into hard square slabs of meaty muscle. His neck also tightened up; rather, the fatty tissue around it was melting away, leaving tiny blue and violet snakes in its wake. His thighs and calves seemed to deflate a bit as they concentrated into a tighter mass, revealing even more shapely muscles upon the large man’s frame. Lastly, Ty noticed Gavin’s arms form into shapes resembling large hills on both sides of the new man, but the hills began getting new crevices as the fat dispersed and the skin stretched over them.<br />
<br />
Ty stepped back, grinning at his accomplishment. He was sure Gavin was back to normal, or at least close to it. Both Kai and Ty watched as Gavin sat up in bed and looked over at his arm as he flexed it. The hill rose each time his arm curled and his forearms expanded a bit; both revealing a good portion of his upper body strength. After a minute of this, he seemed satisfied – as they were the arms that he was once use to. He stood up and began thrusting his knees up towards his midsection to stimulate blood flow into his underused limbs, as well as seeing how they bulked out each time they rose. Yup, those too were once his. He looked down at the plateau’s that were on his chest and a smile crossed his face as he flexed them rapidly – making them dance. He could barely see his abdomen, but he knew what was there. He ran his strong hands over his midsection and silently counted each separate brick that resided on his stomach. Then those risqu&eacute; thoughts started pouring into Ty’s<br />
<br />
<br />
Afterward a minute of ‘playing with himself’, Gavin looked up at Kai. He began itching the back of his head and letting out a awkward laugh, as if he was saying “Yeah… Uh… Thanks?” without getting too verbal. He was never much of a talker anyway. As to thanking Ty, he gave him a hug – lifting him off the floor and almost crushing the lil helper with his unfamiliar bulk. Ty reacted by having all the air forced out of him followed by a few grunts of pain. He could’ve sworn he heard cracking and winced as he thought about what it could’ve been. The Tiger, who finally noticed Ty’s discomfort, backed away and sniffed himself… He figured it was his body odor that was offending the human, and not his incredible strength. With out another sporadic motion, he dashed out of the room to the bathroom to clean himself up, he didn’t want to seem rude and/or offend his guest!<br />
<br />
“I guess that means you did a great job.” Kai said through his hand and a series of coughs, possibly trying to hide his laughter and his slight grin.<br />
<br />
“So… Bleh…” Ty said, repulsed by the amount of sweat that stuck to him. His entire front was covered with it, including his face and hair.<br />
<br />
“Heh, he was always better with doing things rather than saying them when it came to thanking someone. I got a change of clothes and I could get you some soap and a wash cloth to clean you up, if you would like.” Kai placed a friendly hand on Ty’s shoulder and gently guided him to Kai’s room downstairs before he could say yes or no.<br />
<br />
“Er… Well, glad I could help anyway! Sure the sweaty part stinks and all, but at least your dad’s back to normal again.” Ty couldn’t help but smile, even with himself being drenched in some else’s sweat. They were now in Kai’s room, where Kai had his own bathroom. He led Ty to the sink and was about to walk out before Ty began speaking again. “You know, it felt really good to help your dad…”<br />
<br />
Kai stopped in the doorway and turned around to respond, “Why is that?”<br />
<br />
“Well it’s like a good deed or somethin’, you know? Imagine, I could use my talents to help out people like your dad, or punish those who use their power to bully others! It’s sort of a weird adrenaline rush.” Ty stopped talking as he began splashing his face with water whilst applying soap to his face.<br />
<br />
“Yes, that seems like a fine way to use your talents.” Kai smiled as he fully turned around and crossed his arms. “For a human, you are not so bad, Ty. I am really glad I met you… Though you are kind of eccentric… But I have no room to talk, now do I?”<br />
<br />
“No, I believe you do not my good sir.” Ty retorted, trying to mimic Kai’s way of speaking. It was terribly executed, but both of them laughed anyway.</p>
