<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Just as you were looking over at the kid, whom you had changed from a short, skinny soccer player into a tall, hunky hoopster thanks to your magic ring, Wade arrived and sat down on the opposite side of the table. You tried to say something when the waitress took your order. Both of you ordered soups and salads and some chicken wings as an appetizer with refills on your drinks. <br />
<br />
You were about to strike up the conversation with Wade, when two people walked up out of nowhere. A lady joined the table where the kid was sitting, and another person walked up to your table. <br />
<br />
“Wade? Ohmygosh! Is that you?” the young man said. “It’s me, Richard from math class in college, last year! Remember me?” <br />
<br />
“Richard! Of course! Here, grab a seat!” Wade offered.<br />
<br />
“Here, let’s have Richard sit opposite of you!” I suggested, as I scooted out of the booth so Richard could slide in first, allowing him to be seated exactly opposite Wade. <br />
<br />
As Wade and Richard started talking, you looked over and noticed the woman who sat down next to Jason’s mom. <br />
<br />
“Oh, my goodness! Is that Jason? Wow, he has grown so much!” the lady spoke aloud. “Julia! What are you feeding this boy?” <br />
<br />
Jason couldn’t help but blush a little as the lady complimented him. This gave you an idea. Using the ring, you made another silent wish. Every time someone complimented Jason on his looks, he would gain another pound of pure, solid muscle! You looked over with a big grin, hoping to see the changes as they took place. If Wade and Richard were talking, they left you alone, so you could focus on the other table. <br />
<br />
You were already so impressed by what you have been able to do thanks to the power of the ring, you just wanted to see how you could make the boy grow some more. It was just so much fun to see the kid grow before your very eyes. In fact, it was intoxicating. <br />
<br />
“Wow, Julia! I remember seeing Jason as a little kid. Look at him now! He’s a big MAN!” the lady continued.<br />
<br />
“Oh, Kate. He’s going through a growth spurt. That’s why he looks different!” Julia added. <br />
<br />
Jason just smiled and nodded as he felt an odd tingling in his chest. It was as if… He was gaining more muscle!<br />
<br />
“So, he’s wearing a tank top now, huh?” Kate smiled. “Gotta show off those big muscles, right?” <br />
<br />
“Awww…” Jason giggled. <br />
<br />
Indeed, Jason felt his biceps and his triceps bulge a bit as she complimented him. <br />
<br />
“Gotta show off for all those cute girls in school! Plus, you wanna look good for summer, right?” Kate smiled. “Gonna be the hot guy on the beach, huh?” <br />
<br />
“Ohhh, man…” Jason was feeling a bit embarrassed by his crazy aunt, who was complimenting him. In the meantime, his arms were growing bigger!<br />
<br />
“He just signed up for the basketball team! He just got his new uniform today! That’s what he’s wearing right now!” Julia explained. <br />
<br />
“Basketball, huh?” Aunt Kate laughed. She leaned a little closer to him. “So, when is the NBA draft, huh? Gonna make millions of Dollars after going pro, big guy?” <br />
<br />
“Owww, jeez, Aunt Kate! I just started!” he smiled. <br />
<br />
“Kate! Quit putting my boy on the spot!” Julia added. <br />
<br />
“Hey! I see this guy making millions in a few years! Can I have your autograph now, before you become famous and appear on ESPN?” Kate chuckled.<br />
<br />
“Awwwww, man!” Jason groaned as he raised his arms and covered his face with his hands. He was blushing profusely. <br />
<br />
As expected, his arms bulged even more, and now his triceps and biceps were clearly visible. Kate caught on and smiled.<br />
<br />
“Look at him! I bet he’s already working out in the gym! Look at all that muscle on this big kid!” she continued. “I bet he’s already the biggest and the strongest kid in his class!” <br />
<br />
“Aunt Kate! Stop!” he just said aloud. <br />
<br />
“Kate! Are you done embarrassing him? Julia said to her. <br />
<br />
“I need to go to the restroom!” Jason said. He just needed a break from the conversation.<br />
<br />
He slid out of the booth and walked to the restroom as Kate watched him. A few minutes, he returned and took his seat again. <br />
<br />
“Did you wash your hands?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, mom! I washed them with soap!” he replied, showing his clean hands. <br />
<br />
“Wow! Look at those big hands! Big enough to grab and hold a basketball, huh?” Kate grinned. “Those aren’t hands. Those are shovels!” <br />
<br />
“And did you see how TALL this guy has become? Wow! He’s taller than ME!” Kate laughed as she looked at Jason. “What’s up with that, big guy?” <br />
<br />
“Well, he is a basketball player, Kate! Basketball players are known for being very tall!” Julia confirmed. <br />
<br />
“Well, mister basketball! I also saw those big, long legs when you walked to the restroom. Ohhh boy, the girls are gonna go NUTS over this guy! Julia, you better be ready!” Kate giggled. “The chicks are gonna come knocking on your door over this heartthrob!” <br />
<br />
“Ohhh come on…” Jason closed his eyes as he leaned back in his seat. <br />
<br />
“So… Who’s the lucky girlfriend, huh?” Kate insisted as she was trying to get some information out of the boy. <br />
<br />
“Uhmm… I don’t have a girlfriend…” <br />
<br />
“WHAT? You don’t have a legion of girls chasing after you?” Kate growled back. “What’s the matter with you?”<br />
<br />
“Uhh… Not had any time?” Jason replied innocently.<br />
<br />
“Ohh, I got it! Well, hot shot! You’re gonna be the big man on the basketball court! I think you’re gonna do great! You’re a good kid and you’re tall and strong! You’re only gonna grow bigger and taller from this point forward, so the sky’s the limit, my boy! You go out there and play your heart out and show them who you are and what you can do! Make all those big shots in basketball and someday you’ll become rich and famous!” Aunt Kate grinned.<br />
<br />
“Awww… Thanks, Aunt Kate!” Jason smiled as he felt a tingling all over his body as his quads, his calves and his pecs grew a little more. From where you were sitting, you could tell that his shoulders seemed even wider, and his pecs stuck out a bit more. Jason was becoming quite buff for a kid of his age! <br />
<br />
Finally, Kate’s phone rang, and she answered it. She hung up a minute later and she looked at Jason.<br />
<br />
“Uncle Joe came to pick me up! Gotta go! I’m proud of ya, Jason! Keep up the excellent work, kiddo!” <br />
<br />
She got up and left. About ten minutes later, Julia and Jason also got up and walked away, after Julia paid her tab. As you looked on, you noticed how tall and how muscular Jason had become. You felt incredibly pleased by your work, and you quietly wished for Jason to stop growing due to your previous wishes. <br />
<br />
Wade and Richard were still talking, but that was okay. You were now looking around, wondering who you could change next, using your awesome, magical ring?</p>
