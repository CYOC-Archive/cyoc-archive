<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Having internal quarrelling in making a decision, you hesitate before completing your answer.</Br>
<Br>"...Uncle Jack, or I guess I should just get used to calling you Jack, I have decided that I am going to go with option number one."</Br>
<Br>"Are you sure because once I do this, I cannot undo it just like with the werewolf costume you left on last night."</Br>
<Br>"You know uncle Jack, I am kind of tired of the life that I have been living till now. My parents never were the best to me, always putting themselves before me, especially forcing me to be here... even though it has turned out for the best. My friends... well, they really aren't friends since I know they like to talk about me behind my back when I am not around. School... I am sick of. I like learning, but I would always be picked on about my looks, but no more since I am making this decision and even if I wasn't, I'm big enough to not have to put up with any of it any more. Since you have a great thing going here, I am willing to go with option number one, for certain."</Br>
<Br>Jack smiled wide, happy that you made this choice, knowing that you were always a good kid and always wanted things for others, even if it was at your own expense.</Br>
<Br>"Alright, I am about to cast the magic to manipulate the world that knew you before you changed. Everyone that knew you, wont anymore and only you and I will know the truth."</Br>
<Br>You watch as Jack moves both his hands in a small circular motion just in front of him. As he continues to do this, you watch as two balls of blurry air form and build. Continuing to watch, you see it grow bigger and bigger which only took a couple of minutes, until Jack thought it was a perfect size to affect everyone. Then, in a burst of fluid motion, he made a short pushing motion as he spread his fingers out wide. Watching, you notice the energy turn into a wave that flowed over you and spread out as it moved, eventually covering the planet.</Br>
<Br>"So... was that all that needed to be done?"</Br>
<Br>"Yup, now we just need you to get clothed and I will get dressed, which we will begin the first day of your new life."</Br>
<Br>After the two of you get dressed, wearing plain and casual clothes, you walk down the steps in front of Jack and proceed to help him open the shop, not to mention run it. Several hours pass by without a single customer, but then the door opens and the bell chimes. Wondering who exactly was there, not that they would have even known you in your old life, you look up and see that it was your father. Just when you were about to call out to him, you stopped yourself because you knew that he would not know who you were. Wondering what he may have wanted, you walk up to him and greet him with a smile.</Br>
<Br>"Hello there sir, is there anything that I can help you with or help you find?"</Br>
<Br>"Not exactly, unless you know where my brother Jack is."</Br>
<Br>"I actually do know where he is sir. I will go and get him for you."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... well hey, thanks. I never did catch your name and you don't have a name tag to make it obvious for me."</Br>
<Br>"Oh... yeah..." You chuckle, remembering that he didn't have a clue in who you were. "My name is John."</Br>
<Br>"John... I have always liked that name and if I had a son, which I don't since my wife can't conceive, I would name him John. Well John, I would love it if you could go grab my brother."</Br>
<Br>"Sure thing!"</Br>
<Br>You smile to yourself, unbelieving how well the wolf costume and now this worked. As you walked to the living area of the place where the entrance was at the back of the store, you call out to Jack and announce that his brother was there. Within a couple moments, Jack came to your side and you both walked toward his brother.</Br>
<Br>"Gary! It is great to see you! What brings you out to my neck of the woods?"</Br>
<Br>"Not much, just passing through the area and I thought that I would check up on you. So... did you finally find yourself a boyfriend?"</Br>
<Br>"Actually, yes! John here walked into my store one day, looking for a particular costume since he heard that I have everything." Jack extends his arm and wraps it around your outer left shoulder, squeezing and giving you a sideways hug. You look at him and he looks at you for a moment, to which you caught a kind of sparkle in his eyes. "Then we talked for several hours and from then on we really hit it off." He finished while smiling wide, happy with the convincing story, but the honesty of having a companion of sorts.</Br>
<Br>Gary, happy for his brother Jack, slaps his right shoulder lovingly and smiles. "Aww... well I am glad that you finally have found somebody right for you! Go on, why don't you give your man a kiss and show him you mean it."</Br>
<Br>Looking at each other, somewhat gazing into one another's eyes, you both hesitate. You both knew that this would happen at some point or another, but didn't think it would come this soon... especially not being able to talk about it. You even semi wanted to just kiss your big bear of an uncle, having always been curious about being with another man.</Br>
<Br>Sensing your hesitation, Gary looks at the two of you sternly. "Go on, give your man a kiss Jack! You know that I don't have a problem seeing two guys kiss. I mean hell, you always have to put up with watching men and women kissing on television and in movies, so I suppose it is only fair. You are my brother and I love ya' regardless if you kiss another guy in front of me or not."</Br>
<Br>You and Jack both smile at Gary's kind words. Returning your gazes toward each other, you peer deep into each others eyes, while your lips slowly meet. Feeling that this was right, especially for you, the kiss turns open mouth and you two kiss passionately for a second with your tongues exploring each other's mouths. Once you break off and look at Gary, you see that he is not only smiling, but a tear rolled off his eye.</Br>
<Br>"Man... you two must really love each other. I always kiss Maya like that every time I can, which always reminds me of our deep love for one another."</Br>
<Br>Gary then walked up to Jack with open arms, brothers giving each other a loving hug and ending it with patting each other on the back a little roughly. After the hug was over, you both smiled as Gary did.</Br>
<Br>"Well bro... I just stopped by to say hey and see how you were doing. I have to get back to get to Maya at a decent time since she told me that she has a surprise for me. I see that you are in great hands and I will leave you two to it."</Br>
<Br>As Gary walked out of the door, then to the left to get into his car, Jack followed Gary to the door and paused for a second. Still feeling good about the sensual kiss you two just shared, Gary looked toward you and saw the glimmer in your eye. Not sure about things at this point, more of where they might lead, Jack flips the open sign to closed and locks the door. As Jack walks back to you, he just stares at you and you begin feeling something more for him again.</Br>
<Br>Seeing the look in your eye, Jack moves in for a quick, but very passionate kiss that lasted a few minutes of swapping saliva and wrestling for kissing dominance.</Br>
<Br>Wanting to know your thoughts, Jack begins to speak. "John, these past couple of kisses were awesome, but I just want to be sure this is something that you want."</Br>
<Br>"You know unc... er Jack, I thought that me wanting to be with another man would be weird, but it isn't and it feels great! I can't think of another man that I would want to be with right now, other than you."</Br>
<Br>With the two of you being so close, chest to chest and crotch to crotch, you can feel his big bulge swell against yours. As you lean in for another short kiss, you cup his cock and balls at the same time. Knowing that this might further things, you give a slight upward thrust with your entire palm. Jack moans slightly, enjoying what you just did to him.</Br>
<Br>Jack smiles while talking. "Well... you know just how to get my motor running, don't you? I just want to make sure you are alright with this and this just isn't something you are doing to repay me for making your life easier."</Br>
<Br>You just smile as you lean in for another short kiss, while your free hands move to open his fly and pull out his semi-flaccid, but quickly swelling thick cock.</Br>
<Br>"Well... I guess you just need some proof then, don't you?" You say as you jack his cock a couple times, getting your hand coated in his thick and stringy pre, not to mention getting his cock as hard as a rock.</Br>
<Br>You drop to your knees and his eyes grow wide, while you open your mouth wide. Before he has a moment to say anything else, you push your open mouth down on his thick and nectar covered head, which you enjoyed more than you thought you would at first. The taste of his juice was sweet and delicious. As you pulled off seconds later, you took your time and dragged out another thick bead of pre, which you sensually licked off with the tip of your tongue.</Br>
<Br>Just as quickly when you got to your knees, you stood right back up and squeezed his cock tight with your right hand. Feeling pleasure beyond anything he had in his past, Jack was lost in euphoria, but quickly snapped back out of it. He moved quickly to stuff his enraged cock back into his pants to your dismay. Wanting this to progress further since you really got him going, he grabs your hand and pulls you up the stairs while shutting off all of the lights to the store. Not having any other intention of doing anything else, you follow close behind and allow Jack to let go of your wrist. Once in the bedroom, the two of you madly kiss one another, breaking only for a few seconds to disrobe a portion of each other's bodies. Once the two of you were naked together, you both looked at one another in all of your manly splendor. Just seeing one another brought a whole other level of passion to your heightened lust, which brought the two of you to kiss madly and wildly while exploring each other's bodies with your equally manly hands.</Br>
<Br>Not wanting to waste any further time, the two of you move slowly to the bed and begin making manly passionate love to each other. Wanting to help Jack out more than anything else, you go back down on Jack and take as much of him in you as you could.</Br>
<Br>In a throw of passion Jack exclaims "Oh man! I can't believe this is what it feels like to make love with a werewolf. If only you could transform and we could make love that way."</Br>
<Br>You just chuckle with his cockhead in your mouth, but you suddenly feel a wave of energy course over you. Suddenly, you realize that Jack must have worked his magic over you and released you from the bonds of the moon so you could give him what he wanted. Before you knew it, your face pushed out and your teeth sharpened which allowed you to take all of his cock in your mouth. Slowly, but surely, your body grew slightly more muscular than your already impressive human form, while the fur raced to cover you. When the transformation was over, you pulled off of his cock for a second, threw your head back and howled in the thrill of the moment. Jack, being far more turned on, jumped up and pinned you to the bed, placing his still leaking cock at the tip of your muzzle. Not wanting to waste any of his tasty fluid, you open your muzzle and he thrust his throbbing member in, to which you relaxed and let him fuck your muzzle. Even though you could dominate him anytime you liked, you rather enjoyed letting him be aggressive and thought it was kinky that he was fucking your muzzle. Not wanting to get off just yet, hornier than ever, Jack had other plans.</Br>
<Br>Jack unpinned you and laid back down while pointing to you. Thinking you got the hint, you moved to keep sucking on him, but he smiles while waiving his pointer finger from side to side. Jack grunts and says "I want to tap that werewolf ass of yours. You think you could do that for me."</Br>
<Br>You shrugged your massively muscled shoulders, moved to position your tail over his cock and slowly lowered down. Not knowing what to expect, you relax and let him enter you, which sent a pang of pain and pleasure through your body. Enjoying how it felt, you lower yourself completely down, then back up slowly till just the tip was at the outer ring, then you moved back down again. Eventually, feeling that you were fully relaxed and your hole was too, as you move Jack matches your movements to bring even more pleasure to the two of you.</Br>
<Br>After a while of being fucked, Jack began feeling the warning signs of losing his load. Wanting you to be the one to decide where that load goes, Jack passionately asks. "Hey my sexy werewolf, where do you want me to cum? I can only take a little bit more of this."</Br>
<Br>Hearing this, you pull off while clenching your butt muscles around his cock, bringing him even closer and when it comes out, it did so with a wet *pop*. Not wanting to lose the chance to taste the full flavor of the real load, you go back down on his cock slowly, tasting your own insides, which didn't taste like anything to your surprise. With a couple long and drawn out movements, you feel his cock twinge and he erupts in your mouth while he flinches. Unknowing of what you did, your saliva swells with the virus that changes people into werewolves from a bite and floods the fluids that were in your mouth. As his torrent was over, which was somewhat lengthy for a human, his cock goes limp and begins shrinking in your muzzle. When you pull off completely, Jack pants while you whimper, wanting the same release you just gave him.</Br>
<Br>Catching this, Jack smiles and moves to take your massive cock in his mouth, enjoying what you had to give him. As he passionately works to engulf your cock, Jack begins to feel more relaxed as his gag reflex lessens, allowing him to go further down on you. Before the two of you knew it, Jack was going to town completely on your engorged cock. Not thinking anything of it, he continues to work on you while things begin to change slightly.</Br>
<Br>Jack's muscles became slightly more defined, his body hair grew slightly thicker and lost it's gray, while he also lost the slight bald spot he just had. Feeling that you were about to release, Jack stops and presents his hole for you to mount. Not wanting to look this in the wrong manner, you quickly thrust your impressively thick cock into his somewhat tight hole. Jack at first yells out in pain, but quickly the yells turn to moans of pleasure. Relaxing and completely giving himself to you, your rod gets harder and harder, getting close to releasing your huge load into him. As you thrust into him, you both realize that his hair was now fur. Not caring, wanting him to be like you, you continue thrusting harder and faster. You watch as his hands and feet change into paws with claws and the thick pads that were normal, his ears grow pointed and move to the top of his head as his face pushes out into a muzzle. Jack's moans turn from moans to whimpers of lust while his teeth elongated into fangs. You just keep thrusting and thrusting, getting closer and closer until you release your huge load into his bowels while his cock enlarged slightly, his balls grew slightly larger, his tail sprouted just above his hole and he erupted again into the sheets that was the same size as the load he lost in your mouth.</Br>
<Br>Satisfied, you pull out while he clenches his new tail hole to keep your seed in him and then you looked at each other in your new wolven forms. He smiled over his sharp white fangs, completely satisfied and felt more invigorated than he ever had, like he could go again even though he just lost two wads. The two of you embrace in each other's massive and wolven arms. Jack smiles, realizing what he didn't think of, that the transmission of the werewolf gene would be contained in both saliva and semen. Jack chuckles, thinking it was the sperm, but would never know that you accidentally nicked his cock when he came the first time. You knew, but you didn't want to say anything, especially because now you weren't alone in being a werewolf.</Br></p>
