<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Edwin woke up after a brief nap. Luckily, he still had time to fill the survey. It was quite simple, a few questions about himself, his body, hobbies and likes. At the end, the age he wanted to become.<br />
<br />
He had thought about it since he arrived to the hotel. He definitely wanted to be older but he hadn&#39;t thought how much. While he was thinking about it, he turned on the TV and watched a football game. It wasn&#39;t anything special but he enjoyed to pass his time doing it despite his sister&#39;s dislike. Something that he had learned from his father before he passed away.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got an idea.&quot; Edwin told himself while he took the survey. &quot;I want to enjoy this game just as dad would do it and I can be a father figure for my sister too. I&#39;ll be a fifty years old man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just after he wrote it, Edwin immediately felt a hot flush rushing through his body, making him bend over slightly and moan with discomfort. A cracking and creaking came from within him as his body began to stretch, bones extending as he grew taller, soon stretching well over six feet.<br />
<br />
The legs on his jeans and sleeves on his shirt pulled up along his limbs, looking ridiculous on his taller body. They then began to feel tighter and tighter, the cloth stretching nearly to breaking point as Edwin&#39;s muscles burned with heat and strange exhaustion. They swelled and hardened, weak scrawny arms and legs pumping up to the huge trunk-like limbs of a long time football player.<br />
<br />
With a long, slow tearing sound, his clothes finally gave way, shirt ripping apart and jeans breaking at the seams. Edwin looked down at his chest, which was still widening, and watched as his muscular pecs bristled and itched, black hair growing and spreading to become a manly pelt.<br />
<br />
Amazed, he lifted a hand to his face, wincing slightly as it creaked uncomfortably, growing like the rest of him. His skin toughened and became rougher and calloused, as the black body hair grew out on the back of his powerful worker&#39;s hands.<br />
<br />
His shoes felt painfully constricting, and he leaned down to pull them off, just in time to see his growing feet break through his socks, tearing them to shreds. His muscular, wide feet beneath were as hairy as the rest of him, and he wiggled his toes as he admired the change.<br />
<br />
Quickly tearing off the scraps of his torn clothes, Edwin ran to a full-length mirror, looking himself over. He was wearing only boxers, tight over what he could tell was now a much more endowed package, and his body was the muscular hairy form of a much older, stronger man. As he admired himself, his face began to change too, chin widening into a square jaw, soon covered with bristling stubble. His eyebrows thickened, and his skin darkened slightly, giving him a much more mature, handsome exterior.<br />
<br />
Finally, Edwin shuddered as a slight feeling of weight and tiredness settled gently on him. His stomach bulged a little, rounding into the hard musclegut of a strong older man who had let himself gain a little weight. His hair and stubble grew a few flecks of grey, and his skin felt thicker and rougher.<br />
<br />
A breeze fluttered through the room, and suddenly Edwin was wearing a bigger version of his former clothes. Brown sandals, jeans and a black sleeveless t-shirt that now looked old fashioned on him. He stared at the mirror, into the eyes of a middle age man and suddenly realized he really badly wanted to watch the game.<br />
<br />
He took out his newly formed sandals and put his bigger smelly feet on the footrest while he took off his other clothes leaving him wearing just a pair of cotton boxers. He didn&#39;t know it but he had got some of his father&#39;s behavior including his lack of shame to be seen almost naked, something that Edwin had forgotten his father used to do and that he occasionally was embarrassed of. He scratched his hairy belly, then his balls and armpits before he sniffed his smelly fingers and farted. He was a man.</p>
