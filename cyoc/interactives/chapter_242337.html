<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Taylor was so excited for her next dream lesson with Shaman Kweli that she had trouble actually getting. Even after all the sex she had, she was still buzzing with energy. There was also a bit of anxiety about falling asleep. That snake spirit might still be lurking about and she wasn&#39;t sure if it could get into her body while she was sleeping. Still, Taylor had to open up spiritually to be able to link with Kweli in her dreams.<br />
<br />
First, Taylor made hir offering in the bathroom, jerking off into the toilet to both open up spiritually and spend a little physical energy to make it easier to sleep. The amount of spunk hir hyena dick spewed into the toilet was smaller than usual. Probably due to all the sex she already had that day. But after flushing it down and changing into both hir human form and pajamas, Taylor had another offering to make: warm milk. A glass for her to help her fall asleep and a bowl for Sholeetsa, hopefully for a bit of guidance.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, it didn&#39;t take much encouragement for the spirit cougar to appear. &quot;Sholeetsa, I&#39;m about to meet with Shaman Kweli for another dream lesson, but I wonder if I could ask a favor,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d like me to guard your physical body in case S&#39;alaln tries to possess you again?&quot; asked Sholeetsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that what that snake&#39;s name is?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s as close as you&#39;re able to say it,&quot; said Sholeetsa, &quot;Some names are not going to be easy for your English-speaking tongue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I am going to need to learn how to speak like a shaman if I&#39;m going to be one,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Often the emphasis behind the words is more important than the words themselves,&quot; said Sholeetsa, &quot;Anyways, S&#39;alaln is a troublemaker. Not enough to endanger the world or even your town. But he would cause a lot of trouble if he manages to get his coils inside you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor shuddered and asked, &quot;Any other unfriendly spirits in this area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some, but none that can&#39;t be chased off. However, I can&#39;t always be around to protect you. So you&#39;ll need to work on your own defense,&quot; said Sholeetsa.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I plan to ask Shaman Kweli, among a few other things,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
Sholeetsa nodded and said, &quot;You are young and coming into your power. That would make you a prime target for many dark forces, not just in the spirit plane. Be careful. And fear not, S&#39;alaln and any other malevolent spirit will not harm you tonight. I shall stand guard.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Taylor with great relief before giving her the bowl of the milk. She drank her own milk before getting into bed. She&#39;d thought she might be awake longer, but she soon drifted to sleep.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Instead of appearing in the savanna in the form of a feral hyena this time, Taylor found herself inside what looked like the inside of a hut, already in her bipedal shape. Kweli was also there, dressed in hir beads and bison headdress. &quot;Good evening, Taylor Wagner,&quot; shi said, &quot;I thought we might start in here today since tonight&#39;s lesson will be more hand&#39;s on and practical.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taylor looked around the hut, noticing several things hanging from the ceiling like dried herbs, roots, and what were probably shamanistic talismans. There were also several jars filled with various different things, quite a few with some preserving fluid as well. The center of the hut had a large pot over a fire. &quot;Is this based on your own hut?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, though my own hut isn&#39;t quite as well-supplied,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;It&#39;s so hard to get them in our rural part of Oklahoma. And so we&#39;re going to focus on potion-brewing tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Before we get started on that, there&#39;s something I need to talk with you about,&quot; said Taylor. Shi described how shi had sex with Taylor while they were smoking weed, the spirit snake that tried to attack her, and how Sholeetsa drove it off. Kweli listened to her apprentice with absolute seriousness. &quot;So Sholeetsa said that we should work on my spiritual defense before S&#39;alaln tries again,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;And she&#39;s absolutely right,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;I owe you an apology. I thought your area would have less active spirits with so many vampires present. Nature spirits tend to be repelled by the undead. And it is good that she told you that spirit&#39;s name. It&#39;ll help you give more protection against it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I can get it completely right,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your defenses against it may be a little weaker until you&#39;ve fully mastered that, but fortunately this S&#39;alaln doesn&#39;t sound like a strong spirit. There are lesser dark spirits that will try to attack and possess novice shamans as that is the only opportunity they have to do so. Once you have spiritual defenses built up, they&#39;ll be nothing more than annoyances. Of course, if there was a big threat, that&#39;s a completely different story,&quot; said Kweli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like what? Ghouls?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Potentially, but you&#39;re extremely unlikely to find any in America,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;I&#39;d be surprised if any ghoul managed to leave Africa without being slain by a werelion or werehyena. It&#39;s one of the few things that we agree upon. And if any werehyena had done something horrible enough to bring down the curse upon hirself in America, I would know about it. No, any dark spirits you&#39;re likely to face would be native to these lands. I don&#39;t think a skinwalker or a wendigo would be near your area, but it never hurts to be careful. So then, would you rather focus on spiritual defense tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d still like to know about potions,&quot; said Taylor, &quot;Maybe if we have time later, we can work on that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;Now, the first thing to know about potion brewing is it is not just like cooking or chemistry. It&#39;s not just throwing ingredients into a pot and letting it cook. Any normal human doing that would just get a very disgusting soup. A magic user must infuse their concoction with some of their own magic. Of course, there are ingredients that have some inherent magic of their own.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like eye of newt?&quot; asked Taylor, noticing a jar that shi was pretty sure filled with eyes.<br />
<br />
Kweli rolled hir eyes and said, &quot;Yes, yes, eye of newt, toe of frog, wool of bat, tongue of dog, all that Shakespearean rigamarole.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I hope I never need to make a potion that requires a dog&#39;s tongue,&quot; said Taylor, &quot;And I don&#39;t know if bats can grow enough hair to count as wool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about that. A lot of things in that list are just garbage,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;In fact, most of them can&#39;t be taken literally. They&#39;re just poetic name for different names. For instance, &#39;eye of newt&#39; is actually mustard seed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So newt eyes aren&#39;t used for anything?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
Kweli paused before admitting, &quot;Ok, they do enhance potency of potions in general just a bit. Though really any amphibian eyes will do. And of course, dragon scales are potent ingredients, but not easy to come by.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m guessing a lot of ingredients aren&#39;t easy to get,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, quite often we potion-brewers have to improvise. Of course, Morgana has her suppliers and she supplies, but it can get rather expensive,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;But for the basics of potion brewing, one requires a few things.&quot; Shi picked up a ladle and tapped it against the pot, &quot;First, a proper pot for brewing. It&#39;s hard to go wrong with iron, but ceramic will also do.&quot; Then shi pointed at the bubbling liquid within and said, &quot;Then there&#39;s your base. Some potions require a specific base to begin with, like wine, swamp water, or blood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The last one&#39;s for dark magic, right?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, though there are some potions that do require a bit of blood,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;For instance, the breeder-to-warrior potion requires a bit of blood from a warrior. The best results are from a warrior&#39;s life blood after they&#39;ve died in battle. Though it&#39;s much easier to just use blood that was drawn in battle, which includes sparring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s good to know, though I think more of my pack want to be breeders than they want to be warriors,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, and those potions are very similar, though they require some key differences. But for now, we start with their bases. First, a pot of water. And it&#39;s best to not use tap water, or at least tap water that&#39;s been left out long enough for the fluorine to dissipate. Then there some of your own fluids to add,&quot; said Kweli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me guess,&quot; said Taylor, stroking hir dick until it was fully erect, &quot;It needs a little cum?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just from that,&quot; said Kweli before reaching around stroking hir apprentice&#39;s slit, &quot;It also needs some juice from here. That&#39;s one of the differences between a warrior-maker and a breeder-maker.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Warriors can have their own cubs, you know,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is true, though the bulk of the pack&#39;s cubs will come from breeders. On the plains where predators are numerous, particularly werelions, it&#39;s important for a pack to have as many cubs as they can to replace those that don&#39;t live to adulthood,&quot; said Kweli.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s...not likely to happen here, is it?&quot; asked Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think there are any werelions in this part of the country, but there are predators who won&#39;t hesitate to go after the young. I hope your pack doesn&#39;t have to deal with them. What&#39;s important is that breeders produce cubs more quickly and often have more than one cub at a time,&quot; said Kweli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not sure anyone&#39;s planning on having cubs so soon. Well, except Zoey, of course,&quot; said Taylor.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will be time for that when you have your own land,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;So, shall we practice a bit here?&quot; Taylor nodded before crouching down. Kweli took the pot off the fire and put it under Taylor. Taylor was pretty sure if this were real, hir balls would feeling an uncomfortable amount of heat and steam, but this was a dream. Kweli then started stroking Taylor&#39;s dick with one hand while fingering hir slit with the other. Taylor was soon moaning. The shaman obvious had a lot of experience with &#39;milking&#39; a werehyena for bodily fluid. Before long, hir administration brought Taylor to climax. Hir dick shot off a big loud while hir pussy gushed. Both excretions landed in the pot and quickly dissolved. Taylor panted happily from the release.<br />
<br />
&quot;It doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be your fluids in the potion,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;But it is more fun that way. Another key ingredient for the breeder potion is milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As in werehyena milk?&quot; asked Taylor, &quot;I don&#39;t think Zoey is far along enough to produce any milk.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In this case, any type of milk will do,&quot; said Kweli, &quot;Organic milk will have the best results. But you ought to practice with milking.&quot; Shi thrust out hir chest, all four breasts on proud display. &quot;Of course, I&#39;ve recently milked myself to make the potion that allows me to link with your spirit, so you work on me.&quot; Taylor nodded before shi started tweaking Kweli&#39;s nipples. The shaman frowned and said, &quot;Gentler. I&#39;m not a cow. Milk needs to be coaxed out.&quot; Taylor nodded before shi started massaging Kweli&#39;s breasts. Kweli sighed and said, &quot;Much better. You can suck on them to draw out the milk, but don&#39;t let your saliva mix in the pot.&quot; Taylor nodded again before administrating hir teacher&#39;s breasts. Judging by the way Kweli was moaning, Taylor was doing a good job. Shi licked and sucked on the nipples until one of hir lower breasts started leaking. Taking hir mouth away, Taylor massaged that breast more until the milk was more free-flowing. Then shi squeezed the breast gently until a stream of milk feel down into the pot.<br />
<br />
Kweli sighed and said, &quot;You&#39;re going to make your mate happy one day. Of course, there&#39;s more to it than that.&quot; Shi proceeded to lecture hir apprentice on what other ingredients were needed for the potion, what words to chant to infuse it with magic. The demonstration in the dream will allow Taylor to remember it clearly when shi wakes up. And Morgana will be able to give her the supplies shi&#39;ll require.</p>
