<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kayl could feel his consciousness slipping away, and not just in terms of his control over Merse&#39;s body.  Merse also felt her awareness dim as her body ran out of breath deep beneath the lake&#39;s surface, still entangled in the krake&#39;s tentacles.  <i>  I&#39;m not dying here! </i>  Merse pulled herself together and in one last effort launched herself at the wolfen&#39;s soul, which still controlled her body, but just barely.  Kayl was too weak by this point to resist much.  Even the spider&#39;s soul had seemed to lose its vitality.<br />
<br />
However, before Merse could reach Kayl, reptilian eyes and a set of huge maws exploded out of the darkness, one heading for Merse, the other for Kayl, and one even going after the spider.  Before any of them could react, all of them were thrust aside, and Merse&#39;s wolfen-shaped body began to contort and grow.  Before the juvenile krake could realize it had bitten off more than it could chew, it was locked in close combat with a three-headed hydra.<br />
<br />
The hydra, a swamp-dweller, was extremely capable under the water, and in a strong lunge managed to get one of its head&#39;s nostrils just above the surface long enough to fill its lungs.  Although the hydra was obviously stronger offensively, having three toothy mouths, the krake did not lack for strength.  As the two foes intertwined deep below the water, the krake in desperation actually managed to tear one of the hydra&#39;s heads from its neck.  However, it was obviously an act of futility, as two new heads burst from the bloody wound.  Jaws snapping in every direction, the water was soon a scarlet mess of severed tentacles, the krake never having had a chance.  The hydra took a few large swallows of the remainder of the krake&#39;s body, as pieces and blood created a large red slick above its heads on the water&#39;s surface.<br />
<br />
Merse was aware of everything that was happening, although it seemed more akin to a dream state than her other transformations, probalby due to the fact that she had nearly drowned.  The oddity of having three heads was only superseded by having one of those heads removed and two grow back in its place.  As the krake fell to pieces, Merse realized what was to come and steeled herself, although she could not prevent her soul trembling in dread.  Surely enough, tentacles snaked out of the darkness in Merse&#39;s mind, tearing Merse&#39;s soul apart as she flailed in agony.<br />
<br />
However, unlike her previous experiences, Merse did not completely give up control.  Perhaps the shaman&#39;s tale had given her a strange sort of hope.  After tormenting her, the krake&#39;s soul seemed to withdraw, then turn to the hydra, which still maintained sway over Merse&#39;s body.  As though it bore a grudge against the creature that had killed it, the krake bitterly clutched at its enemy, and the hydra&#39;s soul was soon too busy dealing with that of the krake to concentrate on maintaining control over Merse&#39;s body.  Quivering but still alert, Merse regained dominion over her form as, still below the surface of the lake and hidden from all eyes, the massive four-headed hydra shrank down into the form of a nude human female.<br />
<br />
Swimming as fast as she could towards the shore opposite the wolfen encampment, Merse managed to put a good deal of distance between herself and the wolfen on shore, only barely breaking the surface for a breath or two before plunging below to ensure she wasn&#39;t seen.  As night drew close, Merse finally dragged herself into the reeds and bushes lining the lake.  She could see figures moving on the opposite shore, and knew the wolfen would soon be searching the shores for any sign of Kayl.  She paused a moment remembering the warmth of Kayl&#39;s family, tempting herself against her better judgment to stay.<br />
<br />
<i>  Please, I have to go back! </i>  Kayl gasped, too weak to fight Merse for control.  <i> Please! </i><br />
<br />
<i>  Soul-stealer, indeed, </i> Merse frowned.   Merse resolutely turned away from the lake and took off as fast as she could in the fading light.  She bit her lip and quickened her steps as she ran from the sound of howls rising from the opposite shore of the lake, one shriller than the rest and calling out desperately, &quot;PAPAAAA!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Merse did not stop until she could not see her hand in front of her face, all the while ignoring Kayl&#39;s fading pleas.  Naked and unarmed, she picked up a tree limb to use as a rather feeble weapon, considering the circumstances.  Then again, Merse smirked to herself, she did have a wolfen, spider, hydra, and krake locked inside her.   Any beast unlucky enough to come after her was in for an unwelcome surprise.<br />
<br />
Stumbling forward in hopes of finding shelter, or at least a road, Merse spotted something in the distance.  <i>  A fire! </i><br />
<br />
**********<br />
The archmage from Dregsbale sat in contemplation before the campfire, but she could not help but be aware of the grumbles of the accompanying soldiers.  The soldiers stationed in Dregsbale were not known for their fastidiousness, but rather for their willingness to bend the rules or take a small bribe.  Needless to say, few had been amused when the representative of the Sorcery Conglomerate demanded a protective detail, and much less so for the particular purpose that archmage had in mind.  However, considering the money the Conglomerate was willing to pay, there was little difficulty in assembling the necessary group.  Nevertheless, that did not mean that they went eagerly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s bad enough we gotta be traipsing around as handmadens to a bunch of wizards,&quot;  the sentry grumbled to his partner as they circled the area.  &quot;But what the hell are we doing bringing a damn wolfen corpse along?&quot;<br />
<br />
The archmage gave no indication of having heard, but rather focused on her intended course of action.  The Conglomerate had long had dealings with every major and most minor powers in the eight realms, even with metabeast tribes, although mainly through local merchants and middlemen in order to keep their hands clean.  Following the only clue she had, the archmage had located a contact in Dregsbale who had done business time to time with the wolfen packs, and convinced him to take her down to meet one.  And not just her, of course, but the dead body of the wolfen who had remained intact through the spider massacre as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you?&quot;  The archmage muttered to herself for the hundredth time since Dregsbale as she stared dully at the covered wagon on the edge of camp containing Kayl&#39;s dead body, still covered in all its talismen, save one.  &quot;Why only you?&quot;</p>
