<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I turned my face to the side and took a couple deep breaths.  Which didn&#39;t do as much to clear my head as I&#39;d hoped, since the sensation of my chest pressing against Anne&#39;s breasts was quite frankly amazing.  Anne must have sensed or noticed something, because she gave me a squeeze and stepped back.  I was sorry to break contact, but it did finally help my head clear.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was amazing!&quot; I said with feeling. &quot;And I wish--&quot;  I stopped myself from saying anything, barely remembering the wishing ring in time.  &quot;I mean, if we weren&#39;t in public like this...&quot; I glanced up to meet her eyes and we shared a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m pretty much feeling the same way.&quot; Anne admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hoo-kay,&quot; I shook my arms out and bounced on my toes.  I felt as tense as I did before a big meet.  I&#39;d run track in high school, and even though I hadn&#39;t joined the college team the tricks to limber up were still second nature.  I noticed Anne giving me an approving once-over as I stretched, no freshmen 15 on me.  I wished my erection away, again, thankful that at least I didn&#39;t have to worry about blue balls any more.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, where were you headed before everything happened?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, it seems so long ago.&quot; Anne ran her hand through her hair.  &quot;I was headed to the boutique to do some shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets finish your errands then!&quot; I suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie said you enjoyed going shopping with her.&quot; Anne smiled.  &quot;That sounds nice.&quot;<br />
<br />
I picked up my shirt, we&#39;d dropped it during our kiss, and brushed it off before holding it out to her.  &quot;Did you want to, ah?&quot;  I shook it at her, glancing at her chest.<br />
<br />
Anne looked down, then over at herself in her car&#39;s side mirror.  The stretchy red material showed off her breasts wonderfully, and more distractingly, her still perked nipples.  &quot;I normally wear a jogging bra under this, but it was still sweaty from my workout.&quot;  She took the shirt from me and put it on, letting it hang open the way I ordinarily wear it.  She didn&#39;t seem embarrassed, by either her nips or my alluding to them.  It covered up her lack of a bra, and even though I suggested she wear it I was a little sorry she&#39;d agreed.<br />
<br />
I caught myself wishing that her nipples would be perky like that whenever we were together.  I half choked, then wished the ring wouldn&#39;t grant my idle wishes any more, just the ones I intended to happen.  I glanced over at Anne, who was watching me with a bemused smile.  She ran her hands down my shirt, lightly cupping her breasts for an instant.  &quot;So, how do I look?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You look good, great!&quot;  I said.  I mean, she&#39;d have looked good in a gunny sack, but the shirt made her look younger somehow, more playful perhaps.  Or maybe I was just seeing what I wanted to, after she&#39;d come onto me like that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks!  Though I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an impartial judge at this point.&quot; She took my hand, gave me a peck on the cheek, and we started walking.<br />
<br />
As we passed the hardware store I suddenly remembered I was supposed to be working.  I silently wished my shift had ended when I followed the old lady to the bus and crossed my fingers that it had worked.  Anne seemed content to just hold my hand so I had some time to think.  I was thrilled about going out with her, even if it was just because of the ring, but wasn&#39;t sure what Katie and my friends would think about it.<br />
<br />
Well no, the guys who&#39;d met Anne would be green with envy, and a couple might make passes at her.  Katie&#39;s female friends would probably be pissed at me, even if Katie was somehow okay with it.  Okay, not &#39;somehow&#39;, I could wish her to be okay with it.  Hell, I could wish to date both of them if I wanted!  <br />
<br />
That thought scared me. Not that I couldn&#39;t handle having two girlfriends who were mother and daughter, but that I might go power-mad using the ring.<br />
<br />
I noticed we were walking slower, and that Anne&#39;s hand was shaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;What, what if whatever happened to my clothes happens again?&quot;  Anne looked at me teary-eyed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey!&quot; I pulled her into a hug.  &quot;I&#39;m here to protect you, whatever might happen.&quot;  I felt kind of awful being the source of her anxiety and also profiting from reassuring her.  Anne gave me a quick squeeze and stepped back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Joe, you&#39;ve been a prince.&quot;  She wiped a tear away.  &quot;Who&#39;d have thought all it took to steal my daughter&#39;s boyfriend away would be him seeing me stark naked on the side of the road?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t talk like that.&quot; I frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t understand what happened to your clothes, but my feelings aren&#39;t as fickle as all that.&quot;  I scuffed my shoe on the sidewalk. &quot;I&#39;ve kinda had a thing for you since Katie introduced us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, you&#39;re much nicer than the usual jocks she brings home.&quot; She smiled slightly.<br />
<br />
I rolled my eyes. &quot;Come on, lets go shopping.  Retail therapy, am I right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re just hoping I&#39;ll model some underwear for you.&quot;  She teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, eventually I suppose.&quot; She stared at me. &quot;What, you don&#39;t like showing off for your boyfriend?&quot;  I wiggled my eyebrows.<br />
<br />
Anne turned to face me, pulled my shirt open and stuck her chest out.  If anything her nipples looked even perkier than before. She folded the shirt closed with a snap and gave me an arch look.  &quot;What do you think?&quot;  She asked.  &quot;I&#39;m still--horny--&quot; she whispered &quot;from being--naked--&quot; she whispered again, &quot;and making out with you earlier.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I should have asked you to drive me home.&quot; I said ruefully.<br />
<br />
&quot;There still time.&quot; Anne said.  &quot;Come on, I desperately need some panties.&quot; She turned ad started walking.<br />
<br />
I stepped up next to her and put an arm around her waist. &quot;Ida know,&quot; I slid my hand down to squeeze her ass cheek. &quot;Knowing you&#39;re commando has me pretty turned on too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re a cute kid Joe, now get your hand off my ass, at least in public.&quot;  Anne replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Maam!&quot; I gave her another squeeze and let go.<br />
<br />
The boutique had an array of women&#39;s clothing, from business formal to dress formal and a wide range of casual in between.  Anne had intended to look for a new purse.  Instead she pulled half a dozen outfits down and had me trail after her while she chatted with the clerk.  I was startled how much a bra her size cost, and how many she had to try on to find one that fit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay Joe,&quot; she said stepping out of the changing booth.  She had on my shirt and a pair of designer jeans she&#39;d selected earlier, and I assumed a pair of panties since she&#39;d grabbed several of them to try on as well. &quot;This is the strapless beige,&quot; she turned so I could admire her from the side. &quot;Does it look better or worse than the almond one I had on earlier?&quot;  <br />
<br />
The clerk was positively cackling.  I don&#39;t know what Anne had said to her, but she&#39;d found my frequent blushing and stammering highly amusing pretty much the entire time we&#39;d been shopping.<br />
<br />
&quot;I, um, can&#39;t see the difference?&quot;  I thought seriously about making a wish that I had just dragged her into the backseat of her car instead of suggesting shopping.<br />
<br />
Anne gave the clerk a look, rolling her eyes.  &quot;Here, I&#39;ll make it easier.&quot; Anne swiftly removed her top and handed it to me, standing there in just the jeans and bra in question.  &quot;You see?  The demi cups support, separate, and constrain my bosom while leaving my upper chest bare for formal gowns.&quot;  She turned and stepped into the booth unhooking the bra and removing it while her back was to me.  In a flash she had another bra in place and turned to face me as she reached behind to hook it.  &quot;While this almond one has more natural shaping that enhances my cleavage.&quot; She posed, one foot slightly in front of the other with her knee bent. The clerk had a coughing fit she was laughing so hard.<br />
<br />
I waited for my pulse to stop racing.  &quot;I think there are good things to be said for either bra, and that if you&#39;ve found two that fit well and are comfortable you should buy them both.&quot; I replied finally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, he&#39;s a keeper alright!&quot; Roared the clerk as she nodded at Anne.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll wear this one out, if you could get the tag?&quot;<br />
<br />
The clerk snipped the tag off it and a green v-neck sweater and hauled Anne&#39;s other selections up to the counter.  Anne sinuously pulled on the sweater, unselfconsciously &quot;fluffing&quot; her breasts so the sweater showed a deep well of cleavage.  She stepped close and put her arms around me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope this makes up for making you stand around all this time?&quot;  Anne whispered to me, tipping her head to the side and brushing her lips against mine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Completely!&quot; I said and kissed her hungrily.</p>
