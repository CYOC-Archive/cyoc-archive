<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
&quot;Oh, that tingles,&quot; said Crystal with a smile.  She ran her gloved hands down her body, enjoying the feeling. Suddenly her smile turned to a frown.  &quot;Ouch!  It&#39;s getting really tight!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just relax. It did that to me, too.  It&#39;s all part of the process, &quot; Kyle said, trying to reassure her.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, ugh.  You don&#39;t understand, ow,&quot; grunted Crystal, as she continued to twitch and shift uncomfortably, pulling at the wet suit attached to her body.  &quot;It&#39;s squeezing me!  It really hurts!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle could see the wet suit pulsing and bulging.  It did appear to be squeezing her.  He didn&#39;t remember this happening before when he used the suit to change into a frog.  Did he do something wrong?<br />
<br />
&quot;Kyle, something is wrong, &quot; whined Crystal. She moaned loudly and feel to the floor, writhing in pain and still tugging at the suit with her gloved hands.  &quot;Please!  Get it off! Now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle began to panic.  He looked to the device and tried to find some kind of cancel button.  But all he could see was a large progress bar, and a warning message that the process must be run to completion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw!  My eyes!  I can&#39;t see!&quot; yelled Crystal.  Kyle looked down and say the hood pressed tightly against her head.  The tip was stretching down like melting plastic, slowly covering her face.  &quot;I can&#39;t breath! I can&#39;t bre....&quot;<br />
<br />
Crystal&#39;s complaints stopped as the hood covered her mouth and nose, completely covering her head. Kyle had seen enough. He dropped the device and crouched down, trying to pull the suit off her somehow.  But as he grabbed her arm he was shocked by the texture of the suit.  It was rough and bumpy, almost like .... alligator skin.  He watched with shock as the texture became more defined, gaining more uneven lumps and ridges as well as a dark green hue. <br />
<br />
A sudden gasp brought his attention back to her face.  The hood had stretched into a long tube, and as Crystal shook her head the tube split apart with surprising force, revealing a long snout lined with growing sharp irregular teeth.  Crystal breathed in and out rapidly, gasping for air.  She still continued to wriggle on the floor.  Her hands and feet moved spastically, but as he watched Kyle could see the individual digits moving between the webbing, just like real fingers and toes. These were no longer gloves and flippers.  They were part of her body.  Crystal&#39;s breathing was now less ragged, and began to sound more like moans. But they were no longer moans of pain, but rather of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Crystal&#39;s body flopped on the floor.  The suit still seemed to pulse, but it no longer appeared to be shrinking and squeezing.  Instead it seemed to be stretching, expanding.  With each pulse of growth Crystal lifted up and pulled her growing body a little further along the ground, allowing it to stretch bigger and longer. At the base of her spine a fat bulb appeared, pushing out against the suit. With each pulse of growth it grew  longer and fatter, spines and ridges slowly rising up as it stretched.  <br />
<br />
Finally, the growth seemed to slow.  But her changes weren&#39;t done yet.  Long, wicked black claws pushed out of the tips of her fingers and toes.  The changes complete, Crystal rested for a moment.  Then she opened her cold new reptilian eyes.<br />
<br />
Kyle stood up and backed away a little.  Her eyes made her look like an inhuman monster, the eyes of a predator.  But he knew it was still his friend. It had to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;Crystal, are you okay?&quot; asked Kyle nervously.<br />
<br />
The creature&#39;s jaw snapped shut with an audible click.  Her eyes rolled and turned to look at Kyle.  Then she smiled.  It should have been comforting but on the face of an alligator it made her look all the more inhuman.<br />
<br />
Crystal raised herself up on her hands, then slowly stood up. She was a little unsteady, not used to standing on the balls of her feet and using a tail for balance.  But she soon got the hang of it.  She looked up and down her new body, admiring it and continuing to smile widely. <br />
<br />
Her whole body was covered from her to toe in thick, leathery scales. The scales lining her back and sides were a dark green, but the scales running up the lower side of tail and her belly all the way up to her jaw were a pale white. Her whole body was thicker, with more powerful thigh and arm muscles.  But she still had her human figure with wide hips and a narrow waist.  Her belly bulged and protruded a little, undoubtedly to accommodate her larger stomach.  She still had a B cup size bulge on her chest, but there was no sign of her breasts or nipples. They were either gone or completely covered by scales.  Her hands and feet were webbed, with thick short digits ending in sharp claws.  But she could still flex them, and could grab objects if needed.  But the most alien feature was her face.  There was no hair, no ears, no trace of her humanity.  It looked like an alligator head, with a long snout filled with sharp teeth and two large yellow eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel fine.  Great even, &quot; she said happily.   She walked unsteadily over to Kyle.  &quot;Oh thank you so much!  I love it! It is a dream come true.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle buckled a little under her tight squeeze.  She was pretty strong, and it was a little hard to breathe.  Crystal quickly released him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, sorry, &quot; she said apologetically, as she backed away from him to let him recover.  <br />
<br />
Then she realized she was looking down at him.  She was over a foot taller than him now!  The thought made her giggle.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look so small now,&quot; she said. &quot;But don&#39;t worry.  I still think you are cute.  Wanna make out?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle was shocked.  &quot;What?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on now.  I am not a fool.  I know what you were doing with those other girls when you were a frog.  There is no need to be embarrassed.  I completely understand.  This new body feels so good.  I feel so full of energy and so.... horny, &quot; she said with a giggle.  &quot;I really want to try this out and I think you deserve a reward.  I know you like gators as much as I do.  You said so yourself.  And I know I am one sexy gator. So let&#39;s have some fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
Crystal locked her arms behind Kyle&#39;s neck and gently pulled him towards her.  She planted a large short wet kiss on his mouth awkwardly  with her snout, then licked her lips with her large tongue.<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you say, Kyle.  Want to get a little wild?&quot;</p>
