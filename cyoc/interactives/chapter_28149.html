<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alexandra screamed in terror as the wolf things came out of the castle walls <br />
wherever she went. What were they!? They seemed to be created using the <br />
castle's magic, it was like the castle's magic itself had gone out of control! <br />
<br />
She had run into one of the maids, her name was Laura, the wolf things had <br />
come out of the walls and gone into her from behind. Laura had transformed <br />
into a muscular she wolf with a look of pure savagery in her eyes. <br />
<br />
Alexandra screamed again and ran as fast as her digigraded feet could carry <br />
her. Where was the master? Why was the master letting this happen? Didn't <br />
he care? -Of course he cared.- -He was master!- <br />
Alexandra knew this castle inside and out, she could actually -feel- the castle <br />
shifting shape around her, but into what?! <br />
<br />
Alexandra started to go down one way, felt it alter into a loop to where she <br />
had been before and quickly went down another way, to where she felt, <br />
where she -needed- her master to be. And all the time, those wolf things <br />
made out of sand kept coming from the walls. Thankfully they were fast, but <br />
not -that- fast, and proved rather clumsy. But they would just sink into the floor, <br />
as they, or new ones, (she couldn't tell, they all looked exactly the same) <br />
appeared in walls near her. <br />
Two leapt at her from opposite sides at the same time, Alexandra slide down <br />
past them, and they smashed into each other scatting into bits of sand. <br />
Alexandra didn't miss a beat and almost running on all fours ran like lightning <br />
praying that master was all right. The wolf things were in hot pursuit.<br />
She turned a sharp corner at the baths which they couldn't match and they <br />
flew into the water turning into sandy muck. Alexandra wasn't thinking about <br />
them anymore, because she saw him. She saw him! She saw master! She <br />
bolted pouring all her strength into her legs before she forced herself to come <br />
to a stop least she skid into Master Karther, which was unacceptable. <br />
But... who was... this vixen with him? She gave off an aura of power that made <br />
Alexandra feel utterly small, and her figure was the like to put even a greek <br />
sculpture to shape, and she had, -six- tails! That last fact more than anything <br />
made Alexandra feel inadequate around her.<br />
But Master, yes master! Tend to master now! <br />
<br />
No one is perfect, as much as Karther hated to admit it, this included himself. <br />
So when he had separated a piece of himself to make the castle literally an <br />
extension of himself, he had chosen the parts of himself he wished to do <br />
without. This included his base phobia of wolves, and the more uncontrollable <br />
side of his Id. Given how Karther acted regardless this said something about <br />
what his more savage side would be like. Thus now the castle was <br />
manifesting Karther's fears, and his most base desire, to make everything like <br />
him to serve him. Though this was utterly perverted by the fact the castle <br />
wasn't meant to act on it's own. <br />
Who knew what these wolves would do once they had converted everything <br />
in the castle, or even beyond that... still... they were still animations of the <br />
castle, which meant they couldn't go beyond the castle walls... <br />
<br />
While Tammia had placed huge emotionally controls, and emotional <br />
modification on Karther, on top draining him of pretty much all his magic and <br />
absorbed it into herself to fight the Angel Fox who was Tabra and Janice, he <br />
was still sentient and himself. So he saw that one of His Queen's fox ears <br />
morph into a wolf one. Seeing his Dear Loving Queen change in such an <br />
obvious way the emotional changes compelled him to act, much like the <br />
changes he had made to Alexandra. Gathering up enough wits to actually <br />
speak, he said, <br />
&quot;M-my Dearest Loving Queen.&quot; He croaked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes my love?&quot; She turned and looked at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-your ear, your left ear! It's become like a wolf's!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammia blinked and felt her left ear, it was shaped like a wolf. She giggled, <br />
had it always been shaped like a wolf's? No, of course no, she was vixen, so <br />
why would it be shaped like a wolf's? Must have been a slight side effect of <br />
that cute little wolf who had tried to play with her. <br />
She remolded her ear into a fox one, this seemed to pacify Karther somewhat. <br />
Of course Tammia was only treating the symptoms of her infection, not the <br />
disease.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Master Karther!&quot; Said a vixen out of the blue who almost ran right into <br />
Karther. <br />
<br />
Karther dully looked at her, after all, all he needed was his queen, she was <br />
the only one for him, he was the only one for her. What was her name again? <br />
Oh yes, Alexandra. <br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Alexandra blinked at the superior vixen. <br />
<br />
&quot;I am Queen Tammia.&quot; She said proudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammia.... Tammy... so you've become queen! I'm so happy for you!&quot; Though <br />
Alexandra felt a pang of jealously. She knew better than to question her <br />
master's choice for his other half, he was master, he couldn't make that kind of <br />
mistake. &quot;Where is your friend Janice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have we met?&quot; Tammia thought, struggling to remember before she was <br />
queen, which was rather like seeking knowledge before the dawn of time, but <br />
she managed to draw it out somehow, must have been her magic. &quot;Ah yes... I <br />
remember you... the chef for my prince.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But since he has a queen, doesn't that mean that our master is king now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have yet to consummate our union ... as for my other body, she has... <br />
gone astray... she is clearly in need of great help...&quot;<br />
<br />
'Other body?' Alexandra tried to figure out what that meant. But it sounded like <br />
the Queen's best friend had suffered somehow and was in need of help. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you can count on my help my queen!&quot; Alexandra nodded loyally. While <br />
she had wished for the master to chose her, she wasn't about to betray her <br />
duty to him by sulking her responsibilities to his queen.<br />
<br />
That was Alexandra finally noticed something. &quot;What... what is wrong with <br />
master? His magic is ... gone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tammia just smiled. All the time blasting the wolves to sand before they got <br />
close. &quot;It is not gone. It is right here.&quot; She patted herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;You... you -stole- the master's power?&quot; Alexandra was mortified. <br />
<br />
&quot;I did no such thing!&quot; The queen boomed and Alexandra was on her knees <br />
and hands in an instant. <br />
<br />
&quot;I was given his power for the moment so that I might better retrieve my <br />
second body.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Second body' again, Alexandra wondered what that meant, but if she needed <br />
to know she was sure she would be told. &quot;Is this true my master?&quot; She asked <br />
Karther.<br />
<br />
&quot;You doubt the word of my Dearest Loving Queen?&quot; Karther asked.<br />
<br />
Alexadra realized the betrayal of her words. &quot;No! No! Of course not! Never! I <br />
wouldn't ever! I merely wished to hear it from you my master!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You are forgiven this time.&quot; Tammia said calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;My queen... &quot; Alexandra said. &quot;What are these monsters that have infected <br />
the castle? I saw them turn Laura into a beast! What is happening?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Obviously they are the work of the invader who had intruded on the castle not <br />
only to steal my prince's harem, but to steal my other body as well.&quot; Said <br />
Tammia perhaps believing what she had just said.<br />
<br />
Alexandra gasped that someone could invade the castle, it was unthinkable <br />
to her mind, but it was true all the same. <br />
<br />
&quot;I may be of little importance to the castle as a whole but,&quot; Alexandra grew <br />
firm. &quot;Command me master! I shall do all I can to aid you in repairing this <br />
damage done to your queen and your kingdom!&quot; She said boldly to Karther. <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent.&quot; Said Tammia smiling. <br />
<br />
+++++++++<br />
<br />
Summoning up a chain whip, Janice and Tabra had torn the sand wolves to <br />
pieces, rendering them inanimate sand in a matter of seconds after they <br />
emerged, and the castle quick began to lose mass and took for it was a <br />
moment to breath. Janice and Tabra did the same. <br />
<br />
Janice asked. &quot;So... when you fight... is it always this intense?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Little girl-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a girl!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;-Look in a mirror! As I was saying, you don't know what intense is. I gave you <br />
a taste of my memories, but I've been carried away on a stretcher from battles <br />
that give you nightmares.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'm already going to have nightmares when this is all over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'When' this is over, I knew there an optimist in you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I'd rather not consider the other possibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider it, then have a stronger motivation not to lose.&quot; Tabra and Janice <br />
put both hands against the sand wall, it glowed white hot and it spread to the <br />
ceiling, wall, and floor of the immidate area. Super heating it until it turned to <br />
glass.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we have just burned ourselves?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was our power, so no. The castle shouldn't be able to animate glass so we <br />
should have a moment for you, for -us- to catch our breath.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice looked back the way they came confused. &quot;Where's Tammy? Wasn't <br />
she just behind us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think those wolves things slowed her down, I can sense her a while back <br />
but she's stopped, she still with Karther and another presence has joined up <br />
with her, I can't tell who though, but it's someone whose programming is still <br />
intact.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So there's someone else whose free around here?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I de-brainwashed the rest of the harem after you two ran for it. I gave one of <br />
them my cross so they should be safe at least from getting their brains <br />
rewritten again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What will a lower case 't' shaped piece of metal do?&quot; Janice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not the symbol! It's the power that it's represents!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you ever going to stop trying to convert me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Janice, you're bunking bodies with an angel, if this doesn't convince you then <br />
I'm not even going to try. I'm just stating a fact.&quot;<br />
<br />
Janice was eager to end this discussion. &quot;So do we keep with our original <br />
plan? Draw Tammia out of the castle so she can't keep changing the sand on <br />
us?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That might be best... But we're sharing this body, so we need a minute to <br />
catch our breath and recharge, I've used up a bit of power when I opened my <br />
real wings for a split second.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we at least generate some clothes?&quot; Janice moaned folding her wings <br />
around herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;I have some battle armor, but it's not made for this shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You just want to ogle this body don't you? I know you can change the shape <br />
of things you have!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;WE have. Remember that. But the armor I have that could actually block <br />
magic that Tammia now has would take too long for me to customize into <br />
something we can wear. Once we smash our way out of here and Tammia <br />
won't be able to use the castle to pin point on us anymore, I have about a <br />
million safe places we can go to get better prepared. There's an oasis several <br />
miles north, we can go there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not leaving Tammy! She's my best friend!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Starting worry about Tammia turning us back into her clone. If we can lure <br />
her into a fight outside, all the better for us, we might be able to disable her <br />
enough to begin the slow process of repairing her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It took you a couple seconds with her before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn't have two magical forces running through her and hadn't gone <br />
through at least two transformations. It'll take a while to dig out her real self out <br />
of the MESS that her mind is now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can save her still?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn't be mentioning it if it wasn't possible.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, I hear something.&quot; Janice flicked an ear to in the direction of the sound <br />
she heard. &quot;Do you hear it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have the same ears, guess. And I think I recognize who it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The shiva wolf that used to be Robert chased after the grand total of nine <br />
vixens and one Shiva vixen who was once named Gene whose base magical <br />
instructions were coming under some serious confusion. <br />
Luna had bought them some time by grabbing Robert on those two spots on <br />
the chest all women hurt. Seriously, what was Karther THINKING by leaving <br />
THOSE exposed? For all his power and cunning, the guy seriously lacked <br />
common sense sometimes. <br />
<br />
A sand wolf come out of one of the walls and made a leaping up at Keiko. <br />
Keiko saw it coming and remember what she herself had said, 'no one cares <br />
enough ABOUT us to care what happens TO us.' <br />
Vicki saw it too and made a choice. <br />
<br />
Vicki pushed Keiko out of the way just in time for the wolf to jump in and <br />
possess her. Or that's what should of happened. Instead of merging with her, <br />
the wolf's impact merely knocked Vicki off her feet and onto the sand stone <br />
floor. Vicki felt the crucifix around her neck heat slightly. Vicki almost laughed, <br />
it seemed that T's gift meant to protect her from re-brainwashing kept her from <br />
picking up hitch hikers. <br />
<br />
However, Vicki found out, just because she couldn't be possessed, don't she <br />
couldn't feel pain as the angry wolf raked it's claws against her back sliced at <br />
the hole in the armor. While Karther had made the armor they were wearing to <br />
be sturdy, being the pervert he was, made made the upper arms, upper legs, <br />
and waist visible. Any armor designer would have rejected the design at the <br />
bat of an eyelash, but Karther was a mage and a ruler, not an armorer. <br />
Vicki cried in pain and felt the blood move down her back. She turned in one <br />
motion and sliced the wolf's head off with her scimitar and it fell over, back into <br />
sand. <br />
The Shiva vixen made a half-hearted attempt to attack Vicki but she just <br />
kicked her away. <br />
&quot;Dammit Gene! We're not your enemy! Can't you see these wolf things are?!&quot; <br />
She hoped she had phrased it in such a way that it could get through to Gene. <br />
Vicki wondered if she could de-brainwash Gene the way she had all of her <br />
sisters. But she was doing this blindly and she had no doubt that Gene's <br />
brainwashing would protect itself if push came to shove. <br />
Four wolves came at Gene at once and the Shiva vixen switched targets and <br />
attacked all four wolves at once with all four of her arms. Vicki wasn't sure to <br />
be grateful to Gene for blocking off the wolves, or the wolves for keeping <br />
Gene's target sight off of Vicki and her sisters. <br />
Keiko did her best to avoid being on the front line, offer what support she <br />
could. Luna and Barbara were fighting back to back. Anna, Charlene, Lisa, <br />
and Erica formed a circle covering each other's flanks holding off Robert. <br />
Lucy... made foolish mistake of leaping right into the den of wolves... she cut <br />
them restlessly to pieces... The other called her to come back, but she had <br />
made her choice... Louis... her real name was Louis, she remembered just <br />
before the wolf dodged her halberd, and dove into her. A moment later, a <br />
humanoid she wolf was in her place, fighting along side Robert. Anna cried <br />
out in dismay and horror. <br />
&quot;She's just the first, soon all of us-&quot; Keiko started.<br />
&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; Luna snarled and jump kicked Lucy up the jaw and send her <br />
flying into the sand wolves, smashing them under her muscular weight. &quot;Shut <br />
up! Shut up! We're not dead yet! That means there's a chance of getting out of <br />
this alive! I don't ****ing buy the whole 'no win' scenario! You shouldn't either! <br />
So let's go!&quot; Thankfully Luna didn't follow Lucy's mistake and didn't kamakazi <br />
herself against an enemy that was able to constantly it seemed resupply it's <br />
numbers. The enemy had cut off both routs... they were being forced into a <br />
smaller and smaller space until...<br />
A blast of white light smashed through one wall and then another, knocking <br />
out Lucy and Robert and burning some of her fur, the sand wolves were all <br />
turned into hot glass. Out of the smoke and rubble came out an odd figure. <br />
&quot;Do NOT ask me to do that again.... EVER!&quot; The vixen with angel wings and a <br />
single tail said intensely.<br />
The winged vixen turned to Vicki. &quot;Hello Vicki, glade to see you held onto my <br />
gift... &quot;<br />
Gene made a leaping slash at the angel fox, she dropped both legs from <br />
under her so Gene went right over her, the winged vixen then gave a powerful <br />
upper punch to Gene's gut, causing the shiva vixen to gasp and her eyes <br />
rolled into the back of her head, dropping all of her sword. The vixen caught <br />
her, and looked at the sisters. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot; The vixen she happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;You another of Karther's pet?!&quot; Luna snapped.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was, would shiva here of attacked me, and would I have just saved you <br />
from those wolves when you were about to lose? What point would there be?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;One of Karther's games!&quot; Luna replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Karther might have left his battle scars on me, but I can promise you he's very <br />
busy himself right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you?&quot; Vicki gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep, it's me. Sorry you lot had to be dragged into this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you?&quot; Vicki asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like I said, had trouble with Karther, right now we need to get OUT of this <br />
castle . . . .&quot; She looked at Lucy and Robert. &quot;And bring them along, they <br />
should stop being zombified once we're out of the castle. Zombified?&quot; The <br />
Vixen seemed to be asking herself. &quot;Look at their auras, don't look at them, <br />
look at their auras, their spirits are tainted by an outside force, this castle to be <br />
precise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you talking to yourself?&quot; Luna raised an eye brow. <br />
<br />
&quot;A long long LONG story! And we don't have time for right now!&quot;  The angel fox <br />
said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Barbara asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Because the castle -still- can't extend itself beyond it's own boundaries. <br />
Which means it can't get up on legs and chase after you once you're out of <br />
here... And the main wall that separate the castle from the outside is round <br />
about two and a half room that way.&quot; The angel fox pointed east.</p>
