<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary decided to hang out with Thunder.  After all, he was just a horse and she was really a human. She could easily outsmart him if he caused any trouble.  And it did sound like fun.  If she was going to spend some time as a horse, she might as well make the best of it.  Running wild with a stallion sounded like a lot more fun than learning a bunch of rules with the boring girls.<br />
<br />
In the morning, John quietly opened the doors to all the pens, and let the horses enter the pasture around the stable.  When Mary walked by he slapped her hard on the rump.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven&#39;t forgotten about you, girl, &quot; said John with a smile. &quot;As soon as she picks the design ...&quot;<br />
<br />
John imitated pushing a brand into her side, and made a sizzling noise.  Mary shuddered.  Surely Amy would not let it go that far.<br />
<br />
Mary trotted through the horses, looking for Thunder, the white stallion.  She found him talking to some other female horses. One of them was Beauty, the black stallion that had given her a hard time last night.<br />
<br />
Thunder turned to her and smiled. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m glad you came.  See you later, ladies,&quot; said Thunder.  <br />
<br />
The other horses giggled, and trotted away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun, &quot; said Beauty with a smirk, as she walked past Mary.<br />
<br />
Mary turned back to Thunder, and saw him quickly trotting away.   &quot;Well, wait are you waiting for.  If that&#39;s the fastest you can go, this is going to be a long day!&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary galloped past him, then Thunder raced past her.  Soon they were both running as fast as they could across the field, laughing gaily.<br />
<br />
Mary had to admit she had a lot of fun.  Running in her new body felt exhilarating.  And Thunder was very nice.  He showed her the pond when she was thirsty. A nice shady spot to rest when the sun was at its peak.  Where the really tasty plants grew.  Walking along the west fence they were startled by a fierce coyote.  But Thunder bravely charged him, stomping his hooves to drive him away. He nuzzled her to make sure she was okay.  His warm body felt safe and comforting, and she nuzzled him in return.<br />
<br />
The sun was beginning to set.  It had been the end to a wonderful day.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary, there is just one more thing I want to show you. I think you are going to like it, &quot;said Thunder.<br />
<br />
He walked her behind a tree near the edge of the fence.  It was far from the house, and the tree shielded them from view.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are, Mary.  Have a look.  Aren&#39;t they the prettiest flowers?  And delicious, too, &quot; said Thunder.<br />
<br />
Mary bent her long neck to examine the flowers.  They were pretty.  She began to nibble them, and they tasted sweet in her mouth.<br />
<br />
Thunder walked behind her and sniffed her rump. Mary thought he was just trying to get her scent, like she had seen dogs do, so she lifted her tail to let him get a better whiff. Thunder surprised her by sticking out his long tongue and licking her vagina.  It startled her a little, and she moved forward.  But Thunder was not to be denied.  He leaned forward and began to lick more eagerly, running his long tongue inside and along the thick lips of her vagina.  Her cunt felt wet and warm, but also strangely stimulated.  She could feel it engorging as it filled with blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing? &quot; said Mary weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just getting you ready, &quot; said Thunder, as he stopped licking.  Her vagina was still wet, and natural vaginal lubricants dripped out of her body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for what?&quot; said Mary weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ready for this!&quot; said Thunder, as he leapt on her back.<br />
<br />
Mary felt his heavy body pressing down on her.  She felt his long hard cock bounce against her abdomen.  Thunder reared back and launched himself forward again.  Her back ached, and she felt his throbbing cock slap wildly against her body.<br />
<br />
He&#39;s trying to penetrate me, thought Mary with shock and revulsion.  She moved forward a little, trying to work her way out from beneath his body.  But her movement was all he needed to get access.  He thrust forward again, driving his cock into her wet cunt.  <br />
<br />
The pleasure was intense.  His cock was humungous, but she could take it.  Her vagina was deep and wide, but the muscles contracted tightly around his cock, sending intense sensations of joy throughout her whole body.  He continued to thrust, and her vaginal muscles tightly milked his cock with every movement.  <br />
<br />
&quot;No, stop, &quot; said Mary weakly.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Thunder did stop.  She could feel his cock wilting in her vagina.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure, Mary?  I won&#39;t do this if you don&#39;t want me to, but it looked like you were having a good time.  I know I was.  But I won&#39;t force myself on you.  Tell me now. Do you want me to stop?&quot; asked Thunder.<br />
<br />
As Thunder&#39;s cock shrank she could feel the bliss receding. She had never felt that good before.  And she had been so close to an orgasm.  She wondered how great that would feel in this body.  She licked her lips.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t stop, &quot; said Mary.  &quot;I want you to finish. I need you to finish.&quot; <br />
<br />
She punctuated her statement by clenching her vaginal muscles tightly against his dick. His cock responded by rapidly expanding and filling her cunt.    He began to thrust more rapidly, and with more power. Finally her body exploded in an intense orgasmic bliss as she came.  Her vaginal muscles contracted rapidly, urging Thunder to cum also. He in turn exploded, sending a massive amount of his seed into her womb.<br />
<br />
Slowly his dick wilted, and he dropped down off her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, Thunder, &quot; said Mary with satisfaction. &quot;You kept your promise.  That was truly unforgettable. We need to try that again sometime.  Would you settle for some nuzzling for now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Mary.  I have to go.  I think I see that coyote again. You can find your own way back to the barn, right?&quot; asked Thunder.<br />
<br />
Mary nodded her head. &quot;I guess so.  Will you be back soon?  Can I see you again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, sure, &quot; said Thunder distractedly, as he ran off towards the west fence.<br />
<br />
Mary trotted back to the stable.  She could see John, Amy, and their mother corralling the horses.  Some of the female horses giggled as Mary passed by.  The family remained uninterested.  The giggles just sounded like snorts and whinnies to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun, Mary?&quot;  asked Beauty with malice.  &quot;Did you enjoy the flowers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Enjoy the flowers? thought Mary. Had Beauty seen them?  <br />
<br />
Mary felt embarrassed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did he save you from the big bad wolf, too?  Or should I say coyote?&quot; asked Beauty.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you know about that? Where you following us?&quot; asked Mary angrily.<br />
<br />
The other female horses just laughed, and trotted off to their pens.<br />
<br />
Belle sighed, and walked up to her side.  With a shock, Mary saw that she was pregnant.  Mary hadn&#39;t even considered the possibility that Thunder might have impregnated her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Mary.  He does it to all the new girls.  I tried to warn you.  But you aren&#39;t the first girl he tricked and you certainly won&#39;t be the last.  He has a deal with the coyote.  It was just an act to make him look brave, &quot; said Belle.<br />
<br />
Mary was furious!  She had been tricked.  It was all a ruse just to seduce her.  She had been outsmarted - by a horse!<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon, Mary.  It&#39;s been a long day.  Let&#39;s just go to sleep.  You are still welcome to hang out with us girls tomorrow.  You have nothing to be ashamed of, &quot; said Belle.<br />
<br />
But Mary was ashamed.  And angry.  She vowed to get revenge on that horse when she became human again.  Maybe she would use a vial to turn him into the toad he really was.  But for now she was content to just fume. Belle was right.  She was very tired.  She let Amy lead her into her pen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry I couldn&#39;t play with you today.  But I&#39;ll try to come by tomorrow.  I hope you had fun with the other horses, &quot; said Amy, as she closed the gate to Mary&#39;s pen.</p>
