<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike sat and thought about all his options for a while. He could make males dominant again, or make them essentially sex slaves to females. He could make females dependent on males, or even blur some gender lines. His choices were truly infinite. However, no matter how much any of these options interested him, they didn’t motivate him enough to actually choose them. <br />
So instead, Mike decided to take a mental step back. He asked himself, ‘What are you trying to achieve here, Mike? What do you want out of this?’<br />
His answer came easily. ‘I want to create an easy, simple, hypersexual life for myself.’ And with that answer came new ideas that brought pen to paper. He wrote, scratched, rewrote sections of the text on both pages, sometimes two or three times to get it just right. His mind moved fast as he did, and he didn’t notice that even his handwriting was gentler and more elegant than it was before he had edited any text. A half hour passed by the time he had finally placed the final period in the now revised text. The words shifted into printed text as he closed the book, feeling the edits to reality take shape as he placed the book in a drawer next to the couch.<br />
Shortly before the edits were finalized, Sarah woke from her nap, revitalized and refreshed. She sat up and looked down at her body, simultaneously aroused and disgusted by the dried and caked-on sweat, semen, and vaginal juices that covered her torso. She heaved herself off the bed and into the shower, where she cleaned herself off using the bottle of 3-in-1 women’s shampoo/conditioner/body wash she kept at Mike’s apartment. She exited the shower and dried herself off, exiting the bathroom with a towel around her waist when the edits began to affect reality.<br />
<br />
The new text in the book read as follows: <br />
<br />
<b>Secondary Sex Characteristics</b><br />
<i>Testosterone affects the development of males after puberty and includes:<br />
-Breast Development: Significant growth of breasts, with the development of mammary glands.<br />
-Hip Widening: Widening of the hips.<br />
-Body Fat Distribution: Increase in body fat, particularly around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.<br />
-Menstrual Cycle: Onset of menstruation, indicating the beginning of reproductive capability. A male will menstruate approximately every 28-34 days, lasting for 1-4 days. During this time, their penis will remain fully erect and ejaculate sperm-concentrated semen frequently, which has a high chance to cause a pregnancy if ejaculated into a female. This can be controlled with masturbation and sex, or will occur when needed automatically. They will experience rapid mood swings, heightened arousal, and may experience other effects on a person-by-person basis. Semen ejaculated when a male is not menstruating will not contain sperm and therefore cannot cause pregnancy.<br />
-Skin Changes: Smoother skin with changes in skin texture and elasticity.<br />
-Voice Changes: Slight deepening of the voice, but not as pronounced.<br />
-Males obtain the innate ability to walk on their tiptoes with ease, making walking in high heels just as easy as walking flat-footed.<br />
<br />
Note about males: the sperm in a male’s testicles is limited in quantity, Once it runs out, when the male turns around 50-60, they will begin menopause, during which they will experience effects such as arousal flashes, expansion of breasts, inability to produce semen (commonly referred to as ‘dry orgasms’ or ‘shooting blanks’), cessation of physical aging, or even inability to become soft.<br />
<br />
<br />
Estrogen affects the development of females after puberty and includes:<br />
-Increased Height: It is uncommon to see a female shorter than 6’6”<br />
-Facial and Body Hair: Increased growth of hair on the face, chest, and other parts of the body.<br />
-Voice Changes: The voice becomes deeper due to the enlargement of the larynx and lengthening of the vocal cords. Most females exhibit voices within the bass range.<br />
-Muscle Mass: Increase in muscle mass, density, and strength, with a significantly pronounced muscular build. Most females find it incredibly easy to build and maintain muscle, especially in their arms, chest and glutes. Females display an unconscious expert control over their significant strength, finding nimble and delicate movements just as easy to perform as lifting twice their body weight or more. This also leads to a conscious ability to flex singular muscles, or use specific muscles without affecting nearby ones (such as performing a full flex of a bicep without involving any other muscles).<br />
-Bone Structure: Broader shoulders and a more angular jawline. Bones are denser to accommodate muscular growth.<br />
-Body Odor and Sweat: Increased production of sweat and changes in body odor. This odor is known to be considered pleasant to males who are attracted to the female. Females also gain the ability to willingly release a pheromone that will send nearby males into fits of arousal, though most females usually  restrict the use of this ability to private affairs.<br />
-Adam&#39;s Apple: More prominent due to the growth of the laryngeal prominence.<br />
-Podiatric Growth: Feet will grow to a large size, proportional to the body. The bottom of the foot will also become numb and tough, making walking barefoot a common practice, though the foot will remain soft and smooth.<br />
-Body Temp Control: Gain an unconscious ability to warm their own body in colder climates. Their body will remain a stable healthy temperature even in below freezing climates. This ability only begins to fail after 48 or more consecutive hours in below freezing climates.<br />
-Females will begin feel a biological need to perform physically exhausting tasks for at least 30 minutes per day. Any kind of workout or other labor-intensive task fulfills this need, so long as they manage to sweat at least moderately through the task.<br />
-Females will gain an innate confidence in their body. Physically, they will always perceive their body as their perfect form and actively enjoy their body in whatever form it’s in. The physical body of any male partner will also be perceived as such. <br />
<br />
Note about females: Due to the need to always produce eggs to make pregnancy possible, females are able to produce a virtually infinite number of eggs, and will create enough to fill their womb daily unless pregnant. This constant creation of eggs also requires the female to ejaculate via orgasm at least four times per day, or they will begin to experience extreme discomfort from the large quantity of eggs held in the womb. The constant production of eggs also causes a significantly exponentially higher amount of estrogen in females compared to the testosterone levels in males, leading to an extremely exaggerated appearance of secondary sex characteristics. This also causes near constant arousal in females, though most are able to keep it under control when necessary. Lastly, this causes the female metabolism to be incredibly fast, requiring a female to consume a minimum of 5,000 calories per day. This also causes females to burn body fat incredibly fast, even able to notice differences after a single workout, and makes it difficult for a female to gain body fat.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Social Norms by Gender</b><br />
<i>Males:<br />
Males are seen as the predominantly weaker gender in all regards. They are weaker, more easily injured, and have too many of what is widely referred to as ‘weak spots’: the breasts, the penis and the testicles. As a result, they are socially restricted from any kind of labor intensive work. They are kept from working more than 25 hours/week and are prohibited from working during menstruation in most countries. Males are unable to hold positions of power, and few males are given the opportunity to participate in highly skilled work such as doctors, nurses, teachers, scientists, or engineers. While males are seen as individuals with rights, a vast majority of people, including males, agree that they should not have a say in government affairs or make other important decisions without consulting a female, to prevent males from being ‘corrupted by difficult thoughts or ideas’. <br />
While males can be competitive with one another, males find fraternal bonding quite easy amongst each other. It is not uncommon for males to experiment sexually with male friends, and is considered a normal part of male interactions and are never considered to be infidelity, and romantic feelings do not occur between males. Males are widely perceived to require protection and companionship by females. Most females even pity males for their weak forms and . though for unknown reasons it is not possible for a male to notice or understand these feelings toward them, even if told directly by a female. Due to this, males are incapable of intentionally taking advantage of this.<br />
Males are expected to be scantily clothed in public at all times, their cleavage, rear and/or bulge  on display at all times. Minimal clothing, with only the males breasts, rear, and package covered, is considered acceptable wear in all situations except formal occasions, where more modestly is expected and only their cleavage or bulge may be displayed. A dress or suit are equally suitable for a formal event.<br />
<br />
Females:<br />
Females are the superior gender in every way. They are physically larger, carry a significantly less risk of injury, and their bodies are developed solidly and are much more durable than those of males. As such, they hold all positions of power in both the workforce and government. Despite their near constant state of arousal, females are widely considered much more mentally sound than males. <br />
Females hold a universal enjoyment of their own bodies, typically spending 30-60 minutes each day examining themselves, massaging or worshiping their own muscles, flexing in a mirror, or some other task that allows them to enjoy their body. This is a purely non-sexual enjoyment for the female, though males often enjoy watching such displays of self-affection for sexual purposes. A female will typically allow close male friends or male family members to observe their sessions of self-enjoyment. Any kind of self-grooming, bathing, showering, workout, or sexual encounter does not fulfill this need.<br />
Almost all females hold the belief that females are meant to be protectors of the weaker males, and as such some females have become incredibly protective and nurturing of important males in their lives. An important part of a females upbringing is proper care and treatment of males, especially how to best care for males when they menstruate (for example, a female will attempt to give a male a blowjob or handjob every couple hours to assist their need to ejaculate). Females generally have a mutual respect for one another, and it is easy for females to get along with one another. In female-only spaces like most workplaces, or in spaces where the only males present are close friends and family, it is completely acceptable for a female to masturbate publicly to alleviate their need for ejaculation. <br />
Females are typically required to be clothed in indoor public spaces from the waist down, and an item such as a necklace, nipple piercing, or armband is considered a suitable upper body covering in public spaces, including formal events. Most governments have laws that allows females to wear only vaginal and anal coverings in all public spaces, so only an undergarment such as a bikini bottom would be required, though this is only utilized by about 20% of females. Some females will wear clothes at the request of a male partner, though females  will strictly wear form-fitting clothes, and female-sized shirts never feature sleeves and have deep necklines, exposing as much of the chest as possible, since females generally find shirts too uncomfortable to wear otherwise. Formal wear for females typically consists of a necktie nestled between their pecs or a bowtie, and tight formal slacks.</i></p>
