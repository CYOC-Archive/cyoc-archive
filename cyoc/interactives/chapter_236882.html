<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Lilah Roberts sat in her chair, looking down at both the swirling glass of alcohol in her hand and the pictures she now scrolled through on her phone while awaiting her date. <br />
<br />
Lilah Roberts had her own place, whereas most students here either lived at the student dorms or just rented a place. Probably one of the local high scale apartments. But dear old daddy had made damn sure - Lilah was going to live deliciously as she attended this prestige private school. She was 18, and here she was with a drink in hand - after all, the rules were for poorer people.<br />
<br />
This was her first date since her last relationship imploded rather spectacularly. A sip, and she reminisced. As far as she was aware going into it, Caleb was the most typically &quot;Alpha Male&quot; looking guy of his friend group at school. He played football and wrestled, he was tall, well muscled, handsome...and despite the stereotypes, he was also well read and not wholly a mentally lost cause - hell, he even did theater. Which possibly should&#39;ve been a hint. But it did seem like they were going to be quite a power couple. She was the daughter of a wealthy contributor to their private school, and he was going to one day succeed his father as a base line or become a successful football player...<br />
<br />
And then...Caleb came out as gay. <br />
<br />
He admitted he only dated her because he felt an obligation to date a pretty girl and that he felt a need to portray himself a certain way in public. Caleb admitted it made him feel pretty damn weird whenever she had him take a dominant role in bed, as he privately identified more as a &quot;bottom&quot;, or whatever. He even admitted he&#39;d been seeing an older guy named Paul, who from what she scraped together from online sleuthing was a big tough hairy guy with a gut.<br />
<br />
Lilah had been...well. It would&#39;ve been a weaker girl that would be devastated by this. Oh no. Lilah was absolutely, horribly furious. She would never accede to just being The Beard, letting some queer make himself look presentable. As far as Lilah was concerned, her perspective was he sure SEEMED into it at first, only to suddenly just...not be. She did her work. She looked up everything to do with it. She had compiled a list through her shall we say little birds. <br />
<br />
Of the club he went to, the man he saw fit to hook up with, of the days he spent with Paul when he claimed he was out with her.<br />
<br />
If he saw fit to do this to her, she saw fit to undo everything.<br />
<br />
She sent his father the relevant information, and it did not take long for Paul to flee the city after meeting with the kind of people Caleb&#39;s dad could employ. The gay club he loved hanging out at so much? Closed down. And Caleb was outed to the entire school, and due to the Coach just...loving to hump that dear little Bible so much, an excuse was made to throw Caleb off the relevant teams. She didn&#39;t much care for the social conservative points - after all, she very much enjoyed a good dick not attached to a God ordained husband - but she did enjoy the work they did for her.<br />
<br />
It hadn&#39;t taken long for Caleb to piece together just how had upended his entire life. Gotten him disowned and made a pariah. Their last meeting was more of a heated confrontation. With a crying Caleb denouncing her to her face - and making some kind of bizarre show of it. He produced some kind of item. It looked kind of like a doll or something. And he screamed in her face, &quot;GAYER...GAYER!! THAT&#39;S WHAT YOUR BOYFRIENDS WILL BE!&quot;<br />
<br />
He sure seemed to be drunk. Drunk or high. Not that she&#39;d be surprised with how many drugs got passed around in that wretched club...<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
Oh there was the door creaking open and then shut.<br />
<br />
She looked up from her phone, where she&#39;d been scrolling through the hunkiest boys on the Fitstagram side of things. One day she would be able to just call up the likes of Mr. Seid and get it from him as much as she wanted in exchange for a nice modeling gig with whatever clothes her company would be selling. She did love the tanned look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey babe,&quot; the young man who walked in immediately caught her eye. She&#39;d seen Cole a couple times around campus. Usually at the track and field area, where he did shot put. He had some pretty nice muscles, and usually ran around without a shirt on, giving her a neat little treat whenever she came by. Even when she was with Caleb, she would go by there to look at and flirt with Cole. She just liked having a certain degree of...options.<br />
<br />
Options that it turned out had now panned out when it turned out her last boyfriend preferred taking up the ass.<br />
<br />
Cole had thick, straw blond hair, light brown eyes and a nice tan. He usually had athletic, lean muscles that were nice looking when the shirt was off, but which made him look skinny when he was in clothes. Yet today... something was different since the time she had officially invited him out. Cole&#39;s arms seemed thicker, his biceps were straining his shirt sleeves, fighting for room in there with his triceps, which likewise seemed bulkier and more well formed. His chest pushed out the front of his dress shirt, the buttons holding for now but definitely showing more strain.<br />
<br />
His shoulders were broader and wider, his trapezius muscles seeming thicker set and almost unnaturally big even by comparison to the rest of him.<br />
<br />
His legs were a standout. They&#39;d always been strong but now they were thick. His quads, thighs and calves all bulged with new muscles. All in all, it looked like he&#39;d jumped on some steroids a while ago, and only now were they really showing the breadth of their effect... and Lilah was a fan. Honestly, she kind of wished more of her dates would jump on steroids for a while in advance of dating her. She deplored the idea of dating a small, weak little shit. She wanted someone who could carry her up a flight of stairs with no problem. A regular boddice ripper of a man.<br />
<br />
Cole stood there for a moment, enjoying the way she just looked at him. &quot;Dunno what it is, babe...&quot; he flexed his bicep, watching his sleeve strain with the muscle, &quot;But I&#39;ve been feeling pumped lately.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t need to---oh never mind...&quot; She just assumed he was making up some lie to avoid talking about the obvious steroids. She set down her drink, deciding that could wait until later in the night. &quot;You are a sight, that&#39;s for sure, and I don&#39;t much care how you got this way so much as the end result.&quot; She got up and wrapped her arm around Cole&#39;s waist, watching him grin as he pressed himself against her. Letting her get much easier access.<br />
<br />
Feeling his tight, muscled ass. That was another point where she was pleasantly surprised. It was like fucking concrete back there! <br />
<br />
&quot;Man,&quot; Cole said with a smirk, &quot;You sure love getting right to the fun part. Glad you like all of this so much.&quot; Evidently as far as she could perceive, Cole gave up trying to come up with explanations or justifications. He was just enjoying this. Cole started opening up buttons on his dress shirt - and for her part, Lilah began leaning over and helping out - popping a button on his chest and licking the smooth pectoral. Huh. Did he also shave up his chest for her?<br />
<br />
She swore that when she saw him in the field, he had a bit more hair on his chest than this. Not that she cared. If he did shave up for her benefit, she liked that well enough. Once the shirt was off, Cole stood and did a little bodybuilding pose, his abs pulled in and flexed. Lilah swore they looked even more toned and powerful than usual - and she couldn&#39;t help herself but start running a hand over them.<br />
<br />
&quot;You like my abs?&quot; Cole said impishly, a grin on his face. &quot;Then you&#39;ll love everything below them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love a strong, tall, good looking man.&quot; Lilah started kissing the side of his neck as if she was every bit the vampire Caleb called her - and then moved up, kissing his nice, slightly thick lips. Lilah looked at those dress pants - seeing that the size on Cole&#39;s quads and glutes made his bulge so much more visible. The thick cock stuffed in the front. She didn&#39;t need to be told twice. She started to pull his zipper down, and sighed when the bulge outright helped push the zipper down just from sheer size.<br />
<br />
The heiress pulled down Cole&#39;s pants and his tighty whitey underwear, licking her lips when she saw how big and thick his erection was. Definitely no issue with interest today. Though she did notice as she looked at his organ that it seemed like while his manhood was thick and strong, his balls seemed small by comparison. Like how she heard roidheads would end up with tiny balls...though she did not see much reason to draw attention to it.<br />
<br />
After all, she didn&#39;t insert his balls into her.<br />
<br />
Kneeling by his side, Lilah cleaned her mouth with a swish of water, and then went in. <br />
<br />
She took that nice, thick cock in her mouth - feeling how strong it was for herself. Immediately, Cole wavered on his feet and groaned, biting his lip as he registered her blowjob. Lilah was quite proud of her skills in that regard - some of her old boyfriends called her &quot;the throat GOAT&quot;, and while she officially didn&#39;t dignify it with a response, she did feel in a sense it captured the scope of her skill well enough. She&#39;d learned through experience just where men were sensitive.<br />
<br />
Some guys had quite sensitive balls, others were more responsive to the head than a lick to the length. She even remembered a couple guys almost going limp and needing to sit down when she did that nice little trick with her finger and their anus. Men so often neglected their G-Spot. Lilah began rubbing Cole&#39;s taint with two fingers, watching him hold on to the table and let out pleased little moans that made her pussy wet.<br />
<br />
But she swore as she kept on sucking Cole off that something looked a little different than when he walked in. <br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t some cheer squad bimbo. She didn&#39;t let herself get lost in the---you know. She was perceptive. She didn&#39;t exactly know how much she cared in the heat of the moment. Not when she needed this so much. But...</p>
