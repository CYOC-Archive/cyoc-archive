<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite passionate cries and a great deal of righteous anger, cooler heads finally prevailed. A heated meeting with Merlin, Katie, and Katie&#39;s mom Kellie finally convinced Gloria and her friends that trying to find the kitsune that attacked Mika and Claudia would be a fools errand. Besides, a joyous event was about to take place.<br />
<br />
Samantha and Mike&#39;s wedding date had finally arrived. Gloria and Katie were both up early as Lisa now helped her adopted daughters dress, with baby Lynne on her hip.<br />
<br />
Despite the rage both girls felt about the attack, they put those thoughts out of their minds. Katie would be acting as Samantha&#39;s maid of honor, while Gloria would be pushing Morgan down the aisle. Despite some light hearted teasing from her friends, saying she was essentially a stand in flower girl, Gloria didn&#39;t mind. Gloria and Jackie both saw how adorable both Lynne and Morgan looked in their dresses and knew they would easily be the most memorable parts of the wedding. As an added bonus both Gloria and Jackie were able to invite dates, meaning Nate and Aunt Jackie would both be in attendance.<br />
<br />
As plans for the ceremony began, Gloria found her head spinning. Samantha, Katie, Kellie, Mika, and Mary Elise were rushing every where taking care of last minute details. Claudia&#39;s injuries had meant the bridesmaids had to pick up the extra slack. While it did mean that Claudia couldn&#39;t help as much it didnt stop her from attending. Claudia sat in a wheelchair, holding Kari as she now directed traffic from a seated position. Gloria and Jackie stood back, stifling a giggle, as Katie and her friends rushed madly around while Claudia barked orders.<br />
<br />
As the ceremony began Jackie and Gloria smiled at one another as they began to led the procession. As they pushed the two infants through Samantha&#39;s backyard they were pleasantly surprised by what they saw. Pretty much everyone they knew was in attendance. Gloria could see her parents wave as they sat next to Cole and Kumiko who beamed with pride as Tommy acted as ring bearer.<br />
<br />
The Harris, Tozawa, and McKinnon families sat towards the back oooing and awing as the the two infant flower girls gazed out at the crowd. Tom Harris smirked, snapping a picture before motioning Cole to follow him. The two former marines were taking no chances after what had happened to Mika and Claudia. They insisted on providing security for the event. After watching Tommy they quickly made their way to the front of the house to stand guard. Gloria couldn&#39;t be sure but she could of sworn the two men were armed as they now disappeared from the backyard.<br />
<br />
As Gloria and Jackie now waited for the rest of the wedding party she saw Kackie blow a quick kiss to a teenage girl seated next to Jason and Lisa. Gloria smirked as she saw her now teenage aunt Ann blush before shyly mouthing the words I love you. Gloria had to admit her aunt looked stunning, a recently dyed strip of purple hair accented the purple dress she now wore, which hugged the young teens slight curves.<br />
<br />
As the wedding party now entered Gloria could see Mike flanked by Shiro, Sebastian, and a couple of guys Gloria didnt recognize. As they now waited at the makeshift alter in Samantha&#39;s backyard the music began to play. Gloria smiled as Katie and her friends now proceeded down the aisle. Mika pushing Claudia as Mary Elise, Kellie and Katie followed. Finally it was Samantha&#39;s turn. <br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s jaw dropped as the pregnant bride was escorted by her step father. Samantha had chosen a simple yet beautiful design for her wedding dress. Gloria had never seen Samantha so dressed up, the girl despite a very pregnant stomach was amazingly beautiful. Turning towards the groomsmen Gloria chuckled as she saw their reaction was similar to her own.<br />
<br />
In keeping with their quirky yet charming ways the couple had written their own vows. Mike vowed to forever be with Samantha, she made his life brighter just by being there. Samantha in turn recalled their first date, drawing a chorus of laughter as recalled headbutting Mike during their first kiss. She promised she would always love him and thanked him for making her think of herself as beautiful. Blushing and smiling the two now kissed becoming Mr. and Mrs. Davis much to everyone&#39;s delight.<br />
<br />
As the reception started Gloria now found herself with some free time for the first time all day. Pictures had already been taken of the wedding party so she was free to do as she pleaded. Glancing over the makeshift dance floor she could see the newlywed couple happily dancing with their friends. Gloria smirked as she saw Katie and her friends, obviously the drinking had begin somewhat early as the group seemed to sing off key renditions of their favorite songs. Gloria could also see that Jackie and Ann had found eachother as they now slow danced with one another. Glancing out towards the rest of the guests Gloria was shocked to see two groups of teenagers along the periphery happily watching what was transpiring.<br />
<br />
Lynne and her friends had made the journey back in time to watch the wedding.  Tricia lay her head on her best friends shoulder, a small smile on her face as tears streamed down her cheek. She couldn&#39;t be happier to see her parents wedding.  Gloria would talk with her future sister shortly, first she needed to see Kellie.<br />
<br />
Kellie and her friends had also traveled to se the wedding. Gloria recognized most of the people (seeing as they were teenage doppelgangers of the people she knew). She was a bit surprised by the large Samoan girl that looked like Samantha as well as a teenage boy and mousey looking girl with glasses. Oddly enough though Gloria could see a sullen looking goth girl standing near Kellie and the boy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Aunt Kellie,&quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Kellie turned, smiling at her niece. &quot;Hi Gloria,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Beautiful wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah it was,&quot; she said. &quot;See you brought everyone with you. Although really havent met everyone yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah brought the whole crew&quot; Kellie said. &quot;You havent met Karen before.&quot; Karen pushed up her glasses, giving Gloria a timid wave to which Gloria responded politely. &quot;So who are these two,&quot; she asked, pointing to the teenage boy a goth teen that now was slinking behind Kellie.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is where it gets weird,&quot; Kellie blushed. &quot;This is Jack, hes...um...Katie&#39;s dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria&#39;s jaw fell open as the handsome teenage boy now smirked, extending his hand. &quot;Pleasure,&quot; he said with a devilish grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dont try buttering her up Jack,&quot; Kellie frowned. &quot;Just cause you and me aren&#39;t fighting doesnt mean I trust you.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the couple now began arguing Gloria gazed at them still dumbfounded. &quot;Wait hold on why dont you trust him?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hes Morgan LeFays replacement,&quot; Kellie grumbled, much to Gloria&#39;s shock. &quot;So yeah, hes evil.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey we have a truce right now,&quot; Jack retorted. As the couple now began to argue once more Gloria could see the sullen goth girl that looked like her Aunt Ann groan in diagust.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh mom, dad,&quot; Ann groaned. &quot;Can you two like chill for a minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kellie is that Ann,&quot; Gloria asked curiously. &quot;Why is she calling you mom and dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie and Jack blushed, apologizing quickly before turning to Gloria. &quot;Yeah that&#39;s Ann,&quot; Kellie said quietly. &quot;But um, heres the thing. That&#39;s not the Aunt Ann you know. That&#39;s not even the Ann from my timeline. Shes from another timeline all together. A timeline where shes mine and Jack&#39;s daughter and yours and Katies sister.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria now gaped at the teen who frowned at her. &quot;You know you can close your mouth sis,&quot; Ann sighed. &quot;I&#39;m just as shocked as you. I had no idea til mom and dad told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gloria rubbed her temple as she now tried to process what was happening. A third timeline now existed, one where Ann was her teenage sister. Gloria now began to worry, what trouble would this new timeline cause.</p>
