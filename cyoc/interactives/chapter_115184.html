<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">when Nate woke up that he knew that something was wrong as Nate slowly shook his head while he tried to organize his rambling thoughts. When he slowly regained consciousness that he couldn&#39;t remember where he was right at the moment, or what he had been doing off the bat. He slowly opened up his eyes, but quickly closed them again. Everything was looking a bit different, and yet strange to him as it only made his headache even worse.<br />
<br />
He slowly got up as he placed his hands firmly on the bed and tried to firmly stand himself up, but He quickly fell off to the ground as he felt unsteady on his feet. They somehow felt very odd to him, almost like he couldn&#39;t even place his heel onto the ground floor. He continues to open up his eyes more slowly, but this time to allowed his eyes to gradually adjust as Everything seemed to be a little too bright. He wanted to slowly get up and turn off the lights in his room.<br />
<br />
&quot;My..my room.... I&#39;m in my room.&quot; he thought. &quot;I was in my room ... doing something.&quot;<br />
<br />
He slowly rubbed his head while he tried to remember that His hair kinda felt strange. it felt Too shaggy, like he needed a haircut. his eyes had now adjusted that he tried to stand up again. getting onto his haunches as he pushed himself up that He even used his bed to brace himself while he slowly rose onto his unsteady feet. He tried to stand upright as he could, but his back refused to straighten out as he assumed a hunched posture (like Quasimodo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame). He held onto the wall as he was trying to step towards the light switch on the wall that He almost fell again as His very own two feet refuses to cooperate and lay flat for him as he was forced to balance on the balls of his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on here?&quot; he growled in a deep soprano. &quot;my... my voice.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was a little surprised by the sound of his voice that He immediately brought his hands to his mouth - or rather, the long muzzle where once had been his mouth as it was now replaced. slowly crossing his eyes as He looked at what looked like a snout between them that He quickly pulled his hands away from it and looked at it. taking his eyes off of his snout and onto his hands that they had fur as his fingers ended in long black nails (claws). He looked down as he saw long thin paws ending in wide, thick, clawed toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It worked! not a werewolf I wanted to be, but it worked!&quot; he said with excitement and a mix of disappointment as he released his grip from the wall. Now fully remembering everything from before that he was able to shift his weight while balancing onto his new hyena paws.  &quot;I have to see what I look like!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate bounded across the room and into the hallway, till he got to the mirror on the door of his bathroom closet that He was almost pleased at what he saw of himself. as he stood about seven feet tall on the balls of his feet that He had to duck down a little, so he could get a good look at himself. He was covered from his head to his feet in brown fur with black spots that His feet looked completely like a hyenas with a long thin body frame as it ended in thick pads on his feet. He was resting on the balls of his feet-paws while his ankles was bending sharply in the air that they were connected to a short thin calf. His thighs were thick with powerful looking muscle that his tail poked up from behind the remnants of his shorts as it hangs limply, but happily.<br />
<br />
&quot;well, I Guess I should of have paid more attention to those warnings about the clothes.&quot; he thought. &quot;Oh well, live and learn I guess.&quot;<br />
<br />
He ripped off the tattered remains of his clothes to get a better look at his body, till he was butt naked as  His inner thighs and groin while looking down there was covered in the same dense of fur that coated the rest of his body. his penis was hidden in a sheath that Nate thought it must of also changed as he wanted to see it from out of curiosity.  His chest as it was also covered in fur, but was decidedly more human looking that He had a broad chest while he had long arms packed with thin, wiry muscles.<br />
<br />
when He flexed that he felt power in his slender arms as they felt more stronger then before. Aside from the fur and the claws he had that his hands also looked more human with five long flexible digits. His back however had betrayed his inhuman nature that It was curved, forcing him to assume the hunched posture associated with Hollywood monsters.<br />
<br />
His body looked great, but the pièce de résistance had to be examined. his head. It was unable to describe for words that Nate had a long muzzle filled with sharp teeth, as well as a long tongue. The nostrils of his flat, wet black nose twitched as he was assaulted by the many new scents he could now smell with that thankfully His eyes stayed the same as they were, but the sclera (the white part of the eye) was more yellow. his ears were now large pointed, rounded ears that they sat atop at the back of his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is so weird, and so cool!&quot; Nate said with excitement as he was continuing to stare at his reflection while admiring his new changed body. he looked like one of those sexy body models, but furrier.<br />
<br />
He was making a few faces in the mirror that one of he did was him snarling, baring his fangs. when he turned around to show off his back that made it wag in a cute way. Nate&#39;s ears pick up when someone knocked on the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;hello? Nate? you in there?&quot; asked the voice.<br />
<br />
Nate&#39;s ears suddenly flattened and dropped down to the side of his head as he began to panic. Who could that be? And what were they doing here now? He couldn&#39;t let anyone see him like this! not now, but even if he did, How would he explain it?</p>
