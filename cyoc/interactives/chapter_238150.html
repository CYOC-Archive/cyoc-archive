<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">-At the Ferreira household-<br />
<br />
“Eileen honey please bring me the phone!” Becca calls from another room in the house as she is currently getting ready for work. “Yes ma’am” Eileen quickly grabs her mothers phone ringing on the bed and brings it to Becca “here you are mom” she smiles sweetly to her mother who she doesn’t remember was once her daughter. Eileen proceeds to head back to her room where she continues to study for an upcoming test Monday. Eileen was once Ty’s neighbor and long time crush when Ty was younger and Eileen was much older. After turning 15 Ty and gaining his new powers, he and Eileen were able to spend some more time together on a more deeper level with the fact that Ty could age himself to fit her age or make her fit his. Of course the two of them couldn’t have been closer if they tried, eventually with Eileen inviting her best friend Jill over one weekend to catch up Ty had inadvertently turned both of them into teens which (due to the accidental transformation) caused them both to forget who they once were until Ty brought back their memories (of course after spending very intimate time with the two friends) eventually turned back into adults. Jill had developed feelings for the young Ty and so did Eileen, however Eileen decided to let her friend have a whole new life with someone who would treat her right, better than her previous life could ever dream, thus we find ourselves with a young 14 year old Eileen and her daughter (now mother) 49 year old Becca. <br />
<br />
“Hello?” Becca spoke on the phone with the speaker on as she was currently drying off from the shower. “Hey Becca it’s Jill” Jill said through the phone. “Oh hi Jill, how are you? How’re things with Ty and school?” Becca asked Jill as she placed her hand on her hip now more engaged in the phone conversation. “College is great Becca, of course you know I study very hard for my future” Jill laughs a bit and looks to Ty who is still dressing “and Ty is great as always, the perfect boyfriend.” Ty smiles at Jill’s words. Jill adjusts her glasses on her face “I was calling to see if maybe I can make a bit of extra money” as she used to baby sit for Eileen back when she was little. “Oh? Really? Yes of course you can, are you guys coming here or should I drop her off at Ty’s place?” Becca asked as she was almost completely dressed in her usual business attire; black heels, stockings, skirt that went to just above the knee, red button up with a black blazer buttoned up to push her 36DD breast to show enough cleavage but not too much. “Ty’s place is fine you think you could drop her off in 20?” Jill asks, Becca smiles “20 sounds perfect, I’m gonna be out for the majority of the day and probably won’t be back until 9pm if that’s ok with you two” Becca says as she begins to tie brown hair in a tight bun. “That works perfectly for us, we love having Eileen over, it’s almost like we’ve been the best of friends” Jill says reminiscing her life with her rowdy friend Eileen. “Ok I’ll get her over there in a few, thank you so much Jill, see you soon” she hangs up and calls her daughter down “Eileen baby come downstairs and get ready, I’m dropping you off at Ty’s house!” Becca called for her daughter who excitedly started to pack “oh! I can’t wait, he always makes me laugh, he’s a sweet man” Eileen says as she’s always had a crush on him almost as if she felt an attraction to him in another life. <br />
<br />
“Love you mom” Eileen kisses her mother on the cheek wearing a blue shirt and jacket, leggings and brown boots with fabric instead of leather “I’ll see you soon honey, you be the best girl ok?” Becca says to her loving daughter “yes mama I’ll be sure to be on my very best behavior”. Eileen hurriedly runs to Ty’s front door and knocks only to be greeted with Ty’s “little” sister June “oh hi Eileen, Ty is upstairs I can get him if you want but I was going to hang out with Brandon” she says having a little attitude but it changed quickly as if her new life dictated a nice kind little sister. “Sorry I’ll get Ty” June then runs upstairs to get her big brother. “Ok I got to go I love you” June says and kisses her big brother on the cheek and runs outside waving bye to Eileen. Eileen smiles and runs to Ty’s not even giving him the chance to come downstairs. “Ty! Oh my gosh! Is Jill here too? I know you both always spend time together” she laughs pushing him playfully still acting like the rowdy kid Jill has always known. “Yeah she’s upstairs she should be-“ just then Jill kisses Ty’s cheek “here” she smiles and looks at Eileen “hey bestie!” She laughs as an inside joke to herself and Ty but Eileen just shrugs it off knowing it’s what she always calls her for some reason “hey bestie” Eileen giggles “you two are so cute together! I can’t wait till I’m your age so I can have a handsome man like him” Eileen blushes<br />
<br />
Jill, Ty and Eileen all gather in the living room “do you really wish to be our age? It’s not all that fun” Ty laughs a bit at Eileen who removes her shoes and leaves them by the door as to not be rude in a guests home. “Of course I do! I can’t wait till I’m as beautiful as my mom” she sighs “she can’t walk down the street without some guy whistling or making some pass at her and her stunning looks” she says to Ty and Jill. Ty smiles “she is pretty but I know she got her looks from someone” Ty says and Jill looks at the young Eileen “are you sure you want to be older?” She asks again “I mean being a kid is pretty great” Jill laughs and Eileen joins in “I can’t wait till I’m older, gosh to be a grown version of myself, I would be overjoyed” ty smiles “you said the word Eileen” Ty then snaps his fingers just then Eileen starts to feel funny “woah I’m…I feel strange” she points out just then her body begins to shift and change. Her clothes instantly disappear off her body leaving her completely naked “woah what’s happening” she blushes deeply “it’s ok we aren’t looking but you said the word” Ty smiles as he and Jill can’t see her transformation. “Word what word? I don’t know what- ahh” Eileen begins to moan “oh god that feels” her voice starts to shift and change becoming more mature and adult “mmmm good” she says her lips begin to grow and expand making them full and luscious just like her mothers her face starts to reshape from acne and blemishes to natural unmatched beauty. Her eyebrows picked neatly leaving them beautiful and full, her cheeks thinning out become solid and beautiful with such delicate features appearing  almost to look like her mother if not for the fact she’s becoming even more beautiful than her own mother. Her hair growing longer as it reaches to her middle back. “God it feels…mmm so good” she moans as her mind begins to mature and change thinking of filthy thoughts as the pleasure builds in her body and everything heats up. <br />
<br />
Eileen’s legs begin to grow expanding her body from a short 5ft 14 year old to that of a 6’2 sexy mature woman, her calves growing wide to support her thighs, which expand and would’ve ripped through her pants like paper if she was still clothed, her ass begins to expand so big and so wide that you would need both hands just for a cheek. “God I feel so hot” she moans as her pussy begins to mature growing a nice patch of hair neatly trimmed over her pussy which increases the pleasure of the transformation even more. Her stomach now thinning and shaping itself to a nice hourglass strong figure with light abs from her constant work outs and sports she played carrying onto her mature body only defining her beauty more so. Her chest begins to expand from an already large size due to her mother gifted genetics, she has already passed her mother in all the shape and sexy look she would’ve ever imagined herself having. Her nipples nice and soft with areola that are lightly colored compared to her already copper skin and beautiful dark undertones. “Fuck papi” she moans gaining a accent her mother didn’t have but she did in her previous life. The form she takes starting to look like her previous life but with major improvements. Eileen was no longer the young 14 year old neighbor she was now the 46 year old Milf Ty had a crush on when he was 15. The smoke cleared and Eileen was dropped lightly on the floor her sweaty naked body curled up on the floor “woah…Ty she looks..” Jill started “Different…but why..” Ty said covering Eileen with a blanket that only barley covers all of her new curves leaving a barefooted naked Eileen on the floor with only covering a minimal amount of her new exciting features. She’s back.</p>
