<br />
Jamie was not a popular girl.  It wasn&#39;t that she was bad-looking, or had bad hygiene, or was even particularly weird.  She was a perfectly normal girl with short brown hair and hazel eyes.<br />
<br />
She was smarter than most of her classmates, to be sure, and privately, she had a few interests like anime, superheroes, and cartoons that some would ridicule her for.  Why privately?  We&#39;ll get to that.<br />
<br />
Jamie wanted to be a writer someday, and often posted fanfiction (anonymously) online.  She got good reviews, but she was too terrified to be anything more than a ghost to her fans.<br />
<br />
She was definitely on the short side, and could be charitably called a “late bloomer”, thought at 14 she wondered if she&#39;d ever get large enough breasts to need to wear a bra.  She even lacked pubic hair, which wasn&#39;t really a big deal...except.<br />
<br />
Jamie had an enemy.  Her name was Kelly.<br />
<br />
Kelly was everything Jamie was not.  Tall.  Beautiful.  Long blonde hair, and a body that was the envy of all the girls her age (and some older girls as well).  Kelly always had the nicest things to wear (while Jamie&#39;s clothing could best be described as “conservative”).  People loved Kelly.<br />
<br />
And Kelly hated Jamie.  Why?  Jamie didn&#39;t know.  If she was caught writing, Kelly would take her writing and read it aloud, treating it with derision and scorn.<br />
<br />
Anything Jamie liked, was for babies.  If she caught Jamie while dressing in P.E. (or worse, after showering), she would make pointed remarks about how she looked like a middle schooler.<br />
<br />
And the one thing that drove Kelly up the wall, was when Jamie got recognition for anything.  Good grades?  Perfect attendance?  Helping out other students?<br />
<br />
This enraged Kelly, and she would find new ways to humiliate the girl.<br />
<br />
After school, however, Kelly went too far.  She and her cronies jumped Jamie on her way home after school, and pulled her behind some bushes, stuffing a sock in her mouth so she couldn&#39;t cry out.  They stripped her naked and stole her clothes, phone, and backpack.<br />
<br />
Then left her there, crying and terrified.<br />
<br />
She had waited until it was dark to sneak back home.  She didn&#39;t dare bring it up with her Mom- Terry was only her Stepmom, and her Dad worked for months at a time on an oil rig.<br />
<br />
Terry didn&#39;t care one bit about Jamie, and would abuse her almost as bad as Kelly did.<br />
<br />
And she knew she&#39;d be in trouble for losing her phone.<br />
<br />
And the worst part?  While leering at her naked body, Kelly had said she ought to take her virginity right there.  Even kissed Jamie.  Then sneered that “you fucking lesbian, you&#39;d enjoy that, wouldn&#39;t you?”<br />
<br />
You see, one of the stories Kelly had taken was a sweet story about two girls finding love.  <br />
<br />
And the worst part of it all, was that Jamie did, in fact, thing Kelly was lovely.<br />
<br />
After showering and doing whatever she could to get the taste of sock out of her mouth, Jamie signed onto a Discord for authors like herself.  Normally she didn&#39;t share her personal life, but she asked if anyone was willing to talk.<br />
<br />
A few people she&#39;d chatted with, in the past, no doubt curious, got into voice chat with Jamie, only to find out that one of their favorite fellow authors was just a kid!<br />
<br />
But surprise turned into concern when she told her story, sobbing.  Everyone had given her words of support, some saying she should go to the police, while others pointed out she had no proof.<br />
<br />
Still, she felt better, when she got an alert from someone she didn&#39;t know.  Who wasn&#39;t even on the Discord server.  The message was simple:<br />
<br />
“do you want revenge?”<br />
<br />
“yes”, she replied.<br />
<br />
They posted a link before going offline.  Following it, it gave her instructions.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was late that evening when Jamie finished drawing the circle in chalk in her Dad&#39;s “workshop”, the small building attached to the garage where he would work on various home improvement projects when he was home.<br />
<br />
<br />
She uttered the incantation.  This was probably a waste of time, but she was desperate at this point.<br />
<br />
There was a flash of light, and smoke filled the room.  A voice boomed out.<br />
<br />
“Foolish mortal, I am Gemory, Duke of Hell! For what purpose have you summoned me!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamie blinked behind her glasses.  Standing before her was a girl noticeably shorter than herself.  She was wearing a white pantsuit, and some expensive looking strappy heels.  She was very beautiful, probably the prettiest girl Jamie had ever seen, with long blonde hair.<br />
<br />
She had her arms folded in an impatient manner.<br />
<br />
“Uh...you&#39;re a demon?”  Jamie managed to get her mouth to start working.<br />
<br />
“What?  Oh right.  I bet you were expecting someone 7&#39; tall or something.”  Gemory buffed her nails.  “Well too bad, my fiancee has a thing for short girls, even if she won&#39;t come out and say so.”<br />
<br />
“Your...fiancee?  Demons can get married?”<br />
<br />
“Why couldn&#39;t we?  Listen, did you call me to grill me about my social life, or did you have a request?” Gemory snapped.<br />
<br />
Jamie couldn&#39;t take it, after the day she&#39;d had, this was too much!  She started crying.<br />
<br />
Gemory opened her mouth, then shut it again.  “Of for the love of Evil...”  She sighed.  She could hear Danielle&#39;s voice in her head, admonishing her for being cruel.<br />
<br />
She wanted to protest.  I&#39;m a Fallen Angel!  A Duke of Hell!  I&#39;m supposed to be cruel!<br />
<br />
But instead she walked over to the girl and pulled her into a hug.  “Hey.  I&#39;m sorry, what&#39;s wrong?”<br />
<br />
Between choking sobs, Jamie got out her story.  She then flinched when she saw Gemory&#39;s eyes start blazing, tiny flames dancing in her pupils.<br />
<br />
Gemory noticed her fear.  “Ah, sorry.  Don&#39;t be afraid of me, dear...Jamie, wasn&#39;t it?  I&#39;m here to help.”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s just going to cost me my soul, right?” Jamie wasn&#39;t going to back out now.<br />
<br />
“Wellll...normally yes, that&#39;s the deal.  However, you&#39;re in luck.  I want to punish that bitch Kelly on general principles.  And people call me Evil!  So how about this.  You agree to serve me for, oh, a hundred years.  I&#39;ll give you some work to do, and when you die, you will come work for me in Hell.  Then, after that, if your soul is still good enough to go to Heaven, off you go.”<br />
<br />
“...I think if I make a deal with you, I&#39;m going to probably go to Hell anyways.”  Jamie pointed out.<br />
<br />
“Ugh, yeah, Angels can be dicks about that.  Ok, well, how about this.  No suffering, no eternal torment, you get to Hell, I&#39;ll make you into a demon and give you a nice cushy desk job?”<br />
<br />
“Really?  I thought, you know, Hell was a bad place.”<br />
<br />
“Oh honey, I just don&#39;t have the time to explain just now.  But trust me when I say it doesn&#39;t have to be bad.  Some parts of Hell are quite pleasant.”  Gemory smiled at the girl.<br />
<br />
“Even if you&#39;re lying...ok.”  Jamie said.<br />
<br />
“Now, as for my end of the bargain.”  Gemory produced a gold ring.  “This ring will make whoever wears it your absolute slave.  They will do anything you ask.  Even some things that are impossible, like if you wanted to transform them in some way.  Make them smaller, weaker, make their hair fall out, I&#39;m sure you can find uses for it.”<br />
<br />
“But what about Free Will?”  Jamie asked.<br />
<br />
“Boy, you are a smart one.  Well it&#39;s true, I can&#39;t subvert Free Will.  However, what the ring does is it makes obeying you feel good.  Really good.  So she will be able to resist, but it will be hard for her.  Plus, she has to put it on willingly.  Once she&#39;s done that, well, too bad, so sad.”  Gemory explained.<br />
<br />
“How do I make her put it on?”  Jamie frowned.<br />
<br />
Gemory produced a gold chain and put the ring on it.  “Just wear this around your neck.  If I&#39;m any judge of character, she&#39;ll do the rest.  Now, once it&#39;s on, only you can take it off.  This is important if the wrong person puts it on.”  She handed Jamie the chain.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m almost tempted to give this to my Stepmom.  But I hate Kelly more.”  Jamie said.<br />
<br />
“Hm.  One moment.”  Gemory materialized a pair of reading glasses and a black book.  She looked into it.  “Ah, here we are, Terry Bradley.  Wife of Jonas.  Step-Mother to Jamie.  I&#39;ll tell you what, I&#39;ll have one of my people pay her a visit.  I&#39;m sure after that, she&#39;ll be much less of a hassle.  Woman&#39;s well on her way to Hell already.  Did you know she was cheating on your father?”<br />
<br />
“What?!  That bitch!”  Jamie yelled.<br />
<br />
“Don&#39;t worry, I have just the person to deal with her.  She&#39;ll get the usual too good to refuse offer, and when she takes it, well, she&#39;ll find out that you should be careful what you wish for.  Now, if you need any technical support, as long as this circle remains intact, you can call me again.”<br />
<br />
“Thank you.”<br />
<br />
Gemory smiled and gave the girl a kiss on her forehead.  “Good luck.”  Then with a flash of light, she was gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
The next day, Jamie felt a lot better.  She put on one of her few nice dresses and went to school, putting the chain around her neck.  Several of her classmates noticed the change in her demeanor and complimented her.<br />
<br />
Jamie felt stronger, more confident.  It was psychological, of course, but a demon had her back!  That felt nice.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long for Kelly to see her, and glare, a look of hatred...and something else, something Jamie couldn&#39;t quite place...in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Kelly made move during P.E..  While getting undressed, she felt someone snatch the chain off her neck.<br />
<br />
“What&#39;s this, lesbo?  You got a secret lover?”  Kelly sneered.<br />
<br />
“You should really give that back, Kelly.”  Jamie remained calm.<br />
<br />
“Or what?  You going to cry?”<br />
<br />
Some of the other girls laughed.<br />
<br />
“Well, whatever you do, don&#39;t you dare put it on, that ring is special!”  Jamie wanted to grin.<br />
<br />
“Bitch!  I&#39;ll do what I want!”  Kelly took the ring off the chain and slid it on her finger.  She got a funny look on her face.<br />
<br />
“Apologize to me, right now, Kelly.”<br />
<br />
“I...” Kelly froze.  “I&#39;m sorry.”<br />
<br />
You could hear a pin drop.<br />
<br />
“Could you say that again please, louder?”  Jamie did grin now.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;m sorry, Jamie.  I&#39;ve been a real bitch.”  Kelly said, then clapped her hands over her mouth.<br />
<br />
“Apology accepted.  Now hand me the chain back.”<br />
<br />
Kelly gave her the chain. <br />
<br />
“I&#39;d like the things you stole back as well, unless you pissed on them or did something else nasty.  In that case, I expect you to replace them out of pocket.  Do you understand, Kelly?”<br />
<br />
Kelly nodded while her friends looked at her with shock.<br />
<br />
“Good.  Come find me after school. Have a nice day!”<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of the day, Kelly felt like a zombie.  She couldn&#39;t explain why she&#39;d done all those things.  Her friends thought she was sick.  But it had felt...good...to do what Jamie had told her to do.  She shivered, and stared at the ring she wore.<br />
<br />
Jamie hadn&#39;t asked for it back.  It was pretty, if simple.  A gold wedding band set with a ruby.  She blushed and a goofy smile formed on her lips.  &#39;Jamie gave me this ring!&#39;<br />
<br />
She wanted to slam her head into her desk.  Why did that make her feel happy?!   <br />
<br />
She was in a foul mood when she caught up to Jamie after school.  The shorter girl was sitting on a bench under a tree, smiling.<br />
<br />
“Here.”  Kelly shoved a backpack at Jamie.  “Your phone is inside, I didn&#39;t mess with it yet.  Uh.  I&#39;ll have to buy you new clothes.”<br />
<br />
“Good, we can go to the mall.  You can call us an Uber, right?”  Jamie smiled sweetly.<br />
<br />
“Uh...yes, but...”<br />
<br />
“Good, it&#39;s a date then!”<br />
<br />
&#39;A date?  With the weird lesbian girl?  No way...&#39;  But instead she smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
“What have you done to me?!” Kelly hissed.<br />
<br />
“I didn&#39;t do anything.  You did this to yourself by stealing that ring.  Now you&#39;re my slave.”  Jamie explained.  “But don&#39;t worry about that.  I order you not to tell anyone about it.”<br />
<br />
Kelly froze.  “No...that&#39;s not...there&#39;s no such thing as magic rings!”<br />
<br />
“Oh no?  Kiss me on the cheek.”  Jamie said.<br />
<br />
Kelly sat next to the other girl, and lovingly kissed her on the cheek.  Several other students saw it, and she heard whispering.<br />
<br />
“Gah!  Why did you make me do that?!  People are going to think I&#39;m a sick lesbian!”<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled.  “Oh but you are, Kelly.  You have no interest in boys at all.  The thought of having sex with a boy freaks you out.  From now on, you&#39;re attracted to girls, and have the sex drive of a perverted teenaged boy!”<br />
<br />
Kelly whimpered as she suddenly became keenly aware of the girls around her, eyeing the ones showing a little skin, or with nice tits.  “No...”<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s sad that I&#39;m not as good looking as those girls, I know.”  Jamie said.<br />
<br />
“What?  No, you&#39;re cute.”  Kelly said.  She then clapped her hands over her mouth and blushed.<br />
<br />
“Kelly!  I didn&#39;t tell you to say that.  Is that what you really think?”<br />
<br />
“Yes!  I&#39;ve always thought you were cute.  And so much smarter than me!”  Kelly wanted to cry.<br />
<br />
“So all this time, you hated me because you were...jealous?”  Jamie had a hard time believing it, but Kelly couldn&#39;t lie to her!<br />
<br />
“...yes.  When you won that scholarship in the 7th grade, my parents were upset.  They asked why I couldn&#39;t be a good at school as you.”<br />
<br />
“Jesus.  So you just decided to make my life miserable instead?  Call the Uber.”  Jamie turned away, upset.<br />
<br />
Kelly did as she was asked.  But then she felt...terrible.  Jamie hated her!  She didn&#39;t even want to talk to her!  She stared at her feet, dejected.<br />
<br />
When they got to the mall, however, Jamie held out her hand.  Kelly wanted to jump for joy!  She took Jamie&#39;s hand, and felt a thousand times better.<br />
<br />
In the back of her mind, a voice tried to tell her this wasn&#39;t right.  But she didn&#39;t care.<br />
<br />
“Ok, you know what good stuff is.  I&#39;m no good at fashion.  So you get to pick the outfit.”  Jamie said.<br />
<br />
“Sure thing!” Kelly was on cloud nine as she brought Jamie to all her favorite stores.  She bought Jamie a white high-waisted lace-trim ruffle skirt with a matching crop top, some thigh high white stockings, and then, at Victoria&#39;s Secret, a light pink lace bra and panties.<br />
<br />
Jamie felt self-conscious trying things on, but Kelly seemed to enjoy seeing her come out of the dressing room each time, and complimented her, which made Jamie smile.<br />
<br />
Finally, she got Jamie into a pair of simple white pumps with a low, block heel.  Jamie felt a little uneasy, as she hated heels, but Kelly&#39;s encouragement helped a great deal.<br />
<br />
“Looking good, girl!”  Kelly smiled.<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled back.  This wasn&#39;t how she thought her revenge would go, but...she liked it.<br />
<br />
They held hands as they walked to the food court.  Some girls who knew Kelly saw them, but Kelly was blissfully unaware, enjoying her date.<br />
<br />
Jamie realized she&#39;d need to talk to Gemory again.  As much as Kelly would deserve it, she was going to be ostracized and bullied, and Jamie found she didn&#39;t like that idea as much as she&#39;d thought.<br />
<br />
As they ate, Jamie looked to Kelly.  “Answer me truthfully, please.  How do you feel about me?”<br />
<br />
Kelly frowned.  “I don&#39;t know.  I think I should be really mad at you, but I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m really having fun, being with you.”<br />
<br />
“So what do you think would happen if I took the ring back?”<br />
<br />
Kelly&#39;s eyes got big.  “No, please, don&#39;t!”<br />
<br />
“Really?”<br />
<br />
“I don&#39;t want to go back to being a hateful bitch!  I know I&#39;d do something terrible...Jamie, I&#39;m a bad person, I really am.  I hurt you because I was jealous of you!  Please don&#39;t ever take it back.”<br />
<br />
“You realize that&#39;s the ring talking, right?”  Jamie frowned.<br />
<br />
“No.  It&#39;s not.  I mean, yes, it makes me feel good to do what you ask me to do.  But I feel like, I don&#39;t know, like I&#39;ve been in a fog this whole time, and now everything is clear.  I want to be your friend, Jamie.”  Kelly explained.<br />
<br />
“Ok, well, if you&#39;re sure.  I was really angry with you.  Really angry.  That&#39;s why I got that ring.  But now...you&#39;ve been really pleasant, and it makes me feel bad for doing this to you.”<br />
<br />
“I deserve it.  In fact, you should probably punish me.”  Kelly then blushed.<br />
<br />
“Eh?  Explain.”<br />
<br />
“I...uh...”  The taller girl shifted her legs nervously.  She didn&#39;t want to say this, but being truthful would feel good... “I guess you could say I have a kink.  I like people who are strong enough to boss me around...and I like being punished.”<br />
<br />
Jamie blinked.  “Kelly, you&#39;re a bully and an alpha bitch!”<br />
<br />
“I know!  I don&#39;t understand it either!  That&#39;s why I always went for big strong guys!”<br />
<br />
“I guess I screwed you big time by making you a lesbian.”  Jamie sighed.<br />
<br />
“It&#39;s...it&#39;s ok.  I...was already bi.”  Kelly admitted.<br />
<br />
“What?!  After all that shit you gave me!?”<br />
<br />
Kelly seemed to shrink, looking pathetic and sad.  “I&#39;m sorry!  I wish I could take that all back, but I can&#39;t.  I was horrible to you!  And not just you...but what I did yesterday...”  She shuddered.<br />
<br />
“I really did want to...do things with you.”<br />
<br />
“You threatened to take my virginity.”  Jamie glared.<br />
<br />
Kelly flinched.  “I..yes.  I know.  But I really wanted to...kiss you...and...other things.”<br />
<br />
“But you hated that part of yourself, so instead you just picked on me.  Kelly, you&#39;re fucked up.”<br />
<br />
Kelly started crying.  “I know!  That&#39;s why...that&#39;s why you have to let me keep the ring.  As long as I&#39;m your slave...you can keep me from being like that.”<br />
<br />
Jamie sighed.  “Despite everything, I really did want you to touch me.”<br />
<br />
Kelly sniffled and looked up.  “If you can ever...forgive me...I&#39;d be happy to.”<br />
<br />
“I think I can.  But you&#39;re right, you do need to be punished.  Kelly, how tall are you?”<br />
<br />
“5&#39; 7”.”  She replied.<br />
<br />
“Ok, we&#39;ll start small.  I want you to shrink 2 inches in height.”<br />
<br />
Kelly shuddered and before Jamie&#39;s eyes, she became a little bit shorter.  “Oh...shit...that felt...” she moaned softly.<br />
<br />
“Woah.  Was the the ring or...your think?”<br />
<br />
“Both?” Kelly blushed.  “It felt really good.  So I&#39;m 5&#39; 5” now?  That&#39;s not so bad.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah well, if I shrank you to my size, people would freak out.”<br />
<br />
Kelly bit her lip a moment before speaking again.  “I&#39;d like to be smaller than you.”<br />
<br />
Jamie thought about Gemory and her mysterious fiancee.  “Hm, that might be fun.  Now, how big are your breasts?  B cups?”<br />
<br />
“Almost C.  My Mom is pretty big.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I&#39;ve seen her...wait, those are real?  Well.  For now, you&#39;re going to lose half a cup size.”<br />
<br />
Kelly felt her breasts tingle, and she looked down her blouse.  Sure enough, they were shrinking!  She gasped.<br />
<br />
“I&#39;d shrink &#39;em more, but again, don&#39;t want people to freak out.”  Jamie grinned.<br />
<br />
“Please...punish me more.”  Kelly pleaded.<br />
<br />
“I want you to apologize and be nice to the other girls you&#39;ve bullied.” <br />
<br />
“Yes...I will...”<br />
<br />
“And also...start wearing your glasses instead of your contacts.”  Jamie grinned.  Kelly had always teased her about her poor eyesight, despite the fact she herself wore contact lenses!<br />
<br />
“Should I take them out now?”  Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
“No, just show up tomorrow at school in glasses.  We should get going, I need to get home.  Not that Terry cares.”  She shrugged.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s your Stepmom?  I never met her, what&#39;s she like?”<br />
<br />
“You, but older.”<br />
<br />
Kelly winced.  “That bad.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah.  Bitch has been cheating on my Dad.”<br />
<br />
“Is that all the punishment you have for me, Jamie?”  Kelly asked.<br />
<br />
“There is one more thing, but I&#39;m going to hold off on it.  You know the other girls are going to try and bully you now.”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  They will try.”  Kelly&#39;s eyes narrowed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, that&#39;s my girl.  Still, they&#39;ll tear you to shreds.  Even if you deserve it, you&#39;re mine.  Nobody bullies you but me.”<br />
<br />
Kelly whimpered.  This shit really did turn her on!  <br />
<br />
“Ah, I know.  Kelly, you&#39;ve been working out, getting stronger.  Even if you don&#39;t look it, you&#39;re stronger and tougher than anyone at school, even the boys.”<br />
<br />
Kelly shivered as she felt...changes...inside her body.<br />
<br />
“Also...I don&#39;t even know if this will work, but...you know how to fight.  Like for real fight.  You can stop anyone dead in their tracks, and you know how to -hurt- people.”<br />
<br />
Kelly felt new knowledge enter her mind.  Knowledge of joint locks, pressure points, weak points in the human anatomy.  Fighting styles like Krav Maga, Muay Thai, Savate, even “52” or “Jailhouse Rock”.  “Oh shit...I can fight.”<br />
<br />
“Huh, so it did work?  Hm.  Let&#39;s try this then.  From now on, you&#39;re a better student.  You pay more attention in class, and you have an easier time learning.”  Jamie figured this could only benefit her slave.<br />
<br />
“Oh wow.  My head is spinning.”  Kelly said.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, that&#39;s enough for today.”<br />
<br />
<br />
As the Uber driver pulled up outside Jamie&#39;s house, Kelly squeezed her hand.  “Can I...kiss you?”<br />
<br />
Jamie nodded, and the other girl planted a kiss right on her lips!  It felt...good...Kelly&#39;s lips were warm and soft.  For a moment, Jamie thought the other girl was going to do more, but she stopped.<br />
<br />
“I..I need to earn that.”  Kelly said.<br />
<br />
Jamie smiled  “Good girl.”</p>
