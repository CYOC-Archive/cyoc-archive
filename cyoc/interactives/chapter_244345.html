<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The twins were woken by knocking on the door of their resort room shortly after 10 am the next morning. At least Jordan woke. Sam heard the noise and just groaned and rolled over.<br />
<br />
Jordan put on a gown and went to the door asking &quot;Who is it?&quot; she hoped none of the guys they had entertained last night had followed them home.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s me&quot; said a voice Jordan immediately recognised as her own, Followed by &quot;Skeesy. Let me in. We need to talk&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan opened the door and Skeesy entered. Jordan locked the door once the brunette was inside. She noticed Skeesy had found herself a pair of blue jeans and a khaki shirt, looking much more respectable than the last time she had visited. &quot;You girls need to get yourselves some phones. I don&#39;t enjoy having to come around here every time I want to talk to you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We might have enough money after last night. Let&#39;s just say Samantha got a lot of tips&quot; Jordan didn&#39;t mention she had got a few tips herself from doing lap dances. After witnessing Samantha whoring herself she had somehow rationalised to herself that, as she was not in her own body, she had a hall pass to be promiscuous. &#39;Emma&#39; could be a whore. It didn&#39;t mean that Jordan was. The cash would come in handy.<br />
<br />
&quot;That answers my 2nd question. You must be Emma. I heard you did well. Bella reported that you two were quite a hit&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We did our part of the bargain. Now you do your part. Did you bring the medallion?&quot; Jordan asked. She was surprised to see Skeesy still in her female form. It had been well over twelve hours since Skeesy had changed. Hadn&#39;t she figured out yet how it worked?<br />
<br />
&quot;No. It&#39;s hidden and only I know where. I need you to tell me how it works&quot; <br />
<br />
Clearly Skeesy didn&#39;t trust them. The girl was no doubt heavily traumatised by finding herself as the opposite sex. Jordan realised that her only bargaining chip was that Skeesy didn&#39;t know how the medallion worked. &quot;I can tell you how it works, but how can we guarantee you will return it to us? You might decide you want to keep it&quot; <br />
<br />
Jordan could see Skeesy was agitated. &quot;I tried doing what the computer said, but it didn&#39;t work. I need help. Help me change back and you can have the medallion. As far as I&#39;m concerned, once I have my own body back I never want to see that medallion again&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Go and fetch the medallion then bring it here. I have no desire for you to stay in my body&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re body?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. That&#39;s my body you currently have. The person you stole it from had used the medallion to steal my identity. That&#39;s why we needed your help to get back to my house and try and find it. I should have warned you not to touch the medallion if you found it. I certainly didn&#39;t plan on you changing. How did it happen anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was caught upsatirs when they arrived and hid in a bedroom. I ended up hiding under a bed while they had sex above me. When I heard the big guy leave and the woman go to have a shower I thought it was my chance to sneak out. While under the bed I had overheard them saying earlier that the medallion was in the woman&#39;s handbag. It had sounded very valuable so I couldn&#39;t resist having a look in the bag and sure enough I found it. The woman must have spotted me though and she tried to snatch it out of my hands. We wrestled for it and I won, then took off down the stairs and to my car and started driving home. I was partway home before I noticed anything amiss&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When you were wrestling with the impostor did you feel a bit of a shock? A bit like static electricity?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now you say it. Yes&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you most likely did a body swap with her. She is now likely to have your old body&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A body swap?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. If two people touch the medallion at the same time they will swap bodies. We need to be on the look out for your old body. He is likely to come back here looking for the medallion&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In my research last night I read stories about a medallion that would swap peoples bodies. It was hard to separate fact from fiction though. And doing what the stories suggested didn&#39;t work for me. I&#39;m still stuck in your body&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we have no choice but to trust each other. Go and fetch the medallion and some clothes for your own body, just not what you have worn since the swap. I should be able to help you swap back. But be discrete. If you see your old body hanging around stay hidden until it is safe. We won&#39;t leave the room or let anyone in here until you return&quot;  <br />
.......<br />
Meanwhile Janet and Bruce had almost completed the two hour drive from Barracuda beach. Janet didn&#39;t want to become a woman again but his wife was insistent that she wanted to be the man in the marriage. Janet didn&#39;t have the heart to tell Bruce that she would be remaining a woman for at least the next 9 months. Janet hoped that by then with their child born she would be happy to stay as Mrs Jordan Colson. Meanwhile he was willing to appease her by taking her to Barracuda beach. He had to admit he didn&#39;t want the medallion to be in the hands of the original Jordan and Sam. By his reckoning the twins would still be on their periods and they would not yet be able to change, however within 24 hours that situation could change. <br />
<br />
Janet was a bit disappointed in what Bruce was wearing today, simple blue jeans and a khaki shirt. She looked absolutely gorgeous in a dress but was apparently rebelling about her sex. At least she saw the sense in wearing a bra. Janet was getting a stiffy at the thought of undressing Bruce and revealing the lacy bra and panties that was hidden underneath.</p>
