<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gabriel a 30 year old man had gone to bed as usual and fell asleep as usual, but to him only a few minutes later he finds himself awake not in his bed in his house, but on a lab table in a sterile room. He found himself bound by some energy field. Gabriel struggled thinking he would remain stuck, only to his surprise the energy field disappeared and he could move. He found himself completely naked, but at the moment that was the least of his worries, he needed to find a way out of here before whoever abducted him comes back. Gabriel went to the door and found it has motion detectors, since the hissed open the moment he got near them. <br />
<br />
Gabriel made his way through through the round corridors for awhile before finding a window. He looked out and saw the starry night sky? He quickly realize he wasn&#39;t looking at the stars from down on earth he was seeing them bright and clear from space. Gabriel recoiled realizing he is on a spaceship, which in turn means aliens are real and have been visiting earth. <br />
<br />
As many thoughts entered his mind at the implications of that he didn&#39;t notice as an energy barrier formed around him to block his escape. After collecting his running mind he bumped into a shimmering energy field. He quickly realized he was now trapped and whoever own this spaceship will be coming for him very soon. A few minutes passed as Gabriel waited to meet the owner of the spaceship, he heard the sound of hooves? He looked toward were the sound was coming from and the owner of the ship came into view from around the bend.<br />
<br />
Gabriel saw a blue skinned, 8 ft tall, alien? monster? come to a stand still in front of the energy barrier. Gabriel took in the sight of the alien? She, He, It had hooved feet hairy/furry muscular legs, the fur on the legs being dark blue, the legs being as thick as his hips, in front of him for all the world to see was a large horse or bull cock that was as long as his arm and just as thick as his thigh below which sat to heavy watermelon sized balls, on the alien&#39;s muscular human torso was a pair of large tits the size of his head, the overall shape of the alien was very curvy, it had a large ass with a thin tapered tail coming out from somewhere just above it, the alien&#39;s head was that of a human women with large pouty lips, a pair of black horns coming out from its forehead, dark blue hair reaching down to its hips, a long forked tongue, and with eye that where black except the iris which was a nice light brown color. Honestly it didn&#39;t look like any alien he could think of, it looked more like a demon. <br />
<br />
The alien? demon? spoke it said in a soft feminine voice &quot;shit now I&#39;m screwed, fuck! Danmmit, I knew I shouldn&#39;t have gotten the cheap stuff.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Gabriel blinked unsure if he should speak up or stay silent. He opted to stay silent hopping that by not drawing unnecessary attention to himself he might be able to..... to do what he wasn&#39;t sure of went, but he didn&#39;t want to piss of the creature in front of him anymore then it was.<br />
<br />
&quot;sigh. I guess now i have to explain to you what&#39;s going on and what&#39;s going to happen to you.&quot; <br />
<br />
The alien then went on to explain to Gabriel, she was a demoness as in the fantasy kind, that fantasy creatures used to have colonies on earth, but they decided to leave since their relations with the natives (ie humans) got complicated and they didn&#39;t want to cause more problems, the had arrived on earth via their spaceships but have since decided not to use them outside of their space dimension, the little green and grey aliens that are popular on earth do exist but they are essentially black-market dealers who occasionally come to earth to get some things that sell well on the market.<br />
<br />
She then went on to explain she bought this spaceship from the black-market since it&#39;s illegal to go to earth and had wanted to only abduct him for a few minutes to gather his DNA so she could make sex drones from it to service her carnal needs, but since he woke up the ship went into space meaning the time frame she had to drop him off back home is long gone due to the rotation of the earth, so now by galactic law she has to make amends by taking care of him or else she will become a slave despite having already broken a law. <br />
<br />
Gabriel was in complete shock at what she said, but at least he didn&#39;t need to worry about getting killed. <br />
<br />
The demoness then introduced herself as Yrelaris, Gabriel introduced himself in kind before asking if she had any clothes for him.<br />
<br />
Yrelaris laughed saying that as a sexy demoness she didn&#39;t have need for clothing. She went on to say that Gabriel didn&#39;t need to worry about things as the ship will maintain itself at the perfect temperature for humans. <br />
<br />
Yrelaris then clapped her hands and the barrier around Gabriel dissipated, she then made it clear for Gabriel to follow her as she will take him to the only bed room on the ship. As they walked Yrelaris told Gabriel about the unique ability of demons<br />
<br />
&quot;Demons have the ability to turn humans into demons as well, we do this by making the human ingest our breast milk, cum, or pussy juice. When they have drunk some they will become their deepest most perverted desires that they are unaware of and their souls will become crystals not at all different to a slimes core. Since demons are their hidden desires made manifest we come in all shapes and sizes, as well as being other races at the same time. For example: a human women gets raped by a demon and then is made to ingest his cum, she may turn into a powerful demon who looks like a troll and has the attributes of a troll but who has a crystalized soul instead of a regular one, alternatively if her mind broke she may simply become a bimbo demon or a submissive succubus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel let Yrelaris&#39;s words sink in as she then went on to explain that their are no differences between the sex demons Succubi and Incubi and demons.<br />
<br />
&quot;All female demons are Succubi and all male demons are Incubi there are no differences. we mainly stick with the term demon and demoness because many are Herms or some intersex combination and as such don&#39;t fall under the term Succubi which is only for fully female demons and Incubi which is only for fully male demons.&quot;<br />
<br />
She then went on to make it clear that demons don&#39;t kill people when they have sex, they do drain someone of a lot of their energy, but not their life force, it was a lie made up by the church and when the person they had sex with is very tired from all the milking of their energy the demon will take care of them, allowing them to recuperate.<br />
<br />
Gabriel nodded doing his best to absorb the info since he will now be going to the demoness&#39;s home and he didn&#39;t want to get on anyone&#39;s bad side.<br />
<br />
They entered Yrelaris&#39;s bed room on the ship and she asked Gabriel if he wouldn&#39;t mind sticking his dick in her cunt while they sleep for the hyper travel to her, the demons home world. <br />
<br />
Gabriel blushed at the proposal, but knew he would have to share the bed with Yrelaris since there were no others and the alternative was to be at her front and have her large cock pressed against his back. Gabriel agreed. Yrelaris then said &quot;we will stop 2 days before reaching my home world so that you can decide on whether you want to become a demon by my hand or a demon by someone else&#39;s.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gabriel asked &quot;what do you mean by that?&quot; <br />
<br />
Yrelaris responded &quot;well the likely hood of you staying human on a planet with sex hungry demons who haven&#39;t seen a human in decades is very low so better to do it with someone that won&#39;t forced themselves on you. I might be able to convince a friend if you aren&#39;t sure about changing with me.&quot; &quot;Aaannndd before you ask since I nearly forgot to mention when a demon changes a person willingly it&#39;s custom to adopt them as their children, also demon being demon their really isn&#39;t any problems with incest either, unlike you humans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gabriel nodded and said thanks for the choice. Now it was time to think over the choice while they go into hyper sleep and wait for their return to real space from hyper space.</p>
