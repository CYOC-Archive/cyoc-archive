<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Selicia stretched her left leg and crossed it over her right as she lounged across from Debbie. The woman seemed to still be sorting herself out as she&#39;d left her guard down. Hands on her thighs as her eyes moved about seemingly without destination. She most definitely hadn&#39;t made any moves in the name of modesty... Wonder why that was... Maybe she wasn&#39;t as prudish as she pretended? Possibly a side effect of being left in such a form for so long...? Selicia huffed softly at that consideration, possibly a realistic one but, she couldn&#39;t know for sure now. The last thought left a certain humor in her eyes as Selicia considered maybe Debbie was just attracted to her or at the very least comfortable~<br />
<br />
Having noticed Selicia&#39;s eyes on her Debbie sidled up to her side of the bath and sighed. &quot;You&#39;ve already seen everything I have to offer, so no sense in trying to hide it now... Especially since you even -played- with me -twice- now...&quot; Now, she&#39;d seemed to have a pout about the whole situation.<br />
<br />
Seeing her acting like that sent a twinge through Selicia. Taking a deep breath while forcibly suppressing that sudden desire to do it all again. The situation still being quite fresh in her mind and having gotten nothing in return had made it hard not to. Selicia settled for sliding that former thief become fuck toy along the bottom of the bath and not so subtly settling herself down its length. The slow gyration of her hips taking the edge off while Debbie seemed distracted by her prior plight.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you say so, Dear. If you say so~&quot; The words rode a sigh of relief as the tension melted into the water. &quot;I could always play with you some more, if that&#39;s your goal, you know~&quot; Following her statement with a sultry purr, Debbie seemed to come around and shake her head with a red faced fervor.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve quite enough for a lifetime, thank you very much!&quot; Cried Deborah as she hugged her body protectively.<br />
<br />
It was a futile gesture, the both of them knew but, it had a charm to it. Maybe there was more behind that denial than she even knew herself. Selicia might just explore that possibility at some future time~ For now, she just enjoyed her time in the bath and the soft lamentations of the once thief in her loins. Reaching out toward the thief&#39;s former partner, the finely shaped luffa, Selicia set it in the water toward Debbie.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, would you like to wash first or would you care to use it after me?~&quot; Accentuating her statement with a sensual grip of her own breasts, Selicia delighted herself with tormenting the other woman. She arched her back gripping her breasts tightly as she nearly released the former thief from her fleshy prison. Settling back down firmly just as the tip of the shaft nearly exited her lips.<br />
<br />
Debbie snatched the luffa out of the water, obviously flustered by the insinuations made. She hadn&#39;t taken note of it&#39;s shape yet either, that was until she&#39;d seen the bottle of soap. The third of the thieving trio permanently forced to dispense whatever she&#39;d contained. Seeing the glass form of a former woman made Debbie pause before cautiously even inspecting the luffa. Dropping the sponge woman back into the water, she stared at Selicia for confirmation and received it in the form of a coy smile and nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;W-Why though? I mean, I guess I could say... Why all of this...? What do you get from doing this to people?&quot; Inquisitively, Debbie pressed the questions out of her mouth with only a minor choking feeling. Obviously, this wasn&#39;t meant to be her fate... Or at least not yet... So she pushed her luck a bit further having little else to do.<br />
<br />
Selicia rolled her head along her shoulders taking another stretch and dropping firmly again. Settling her eyes on Debbie, Selicia grinned deviously as she rattled out her response. &quot;Servants, furnishing, clothes, housewares, linens, toys, et cetera. Simple really, you didn&#39;t know that already?~&quot; Knowing full well what Debbie had really meant, Selicia chose to playfully dodge the question.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right... No... I meant, why people? You could make all of it out of anything right? So why people?&quot; Debbie pressed further than she&#39;d felt comfortable seeing how she was being led on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, there we are, Dear. I do it simply because I can. Because I -want- to. There are so many people, you know. Not all of them deserve to even be human. These three for example...&quot; With a pause and a flourish of her arm toward the items in the bath. &quot;These three were merely leeches living from the gains of others.&quot; A snicker escaped her lips as she recalled how she&#39;d come to claim this place as her own. &quot;Now they serve a purpose higher than their own. Keeping my body clean and refreshed every evening~&quot;<br />
<br />
Deborah saw the floating luffa and the glass bottle of soap resting on the side of the bath. She couldn&#39;t however find the &#39;third&#39; that Selicia had mentioned. Was... Was it the very tub that they were laying in?! Settling before she panicked at the thought, she spoke up. &quot;Three?&quot;<br />
<br />
With a shuddering sigh, Selicia slid herself off of the thief she was riding. With a fishing motion, she pulled the dildo free of the bottom with audible thump. She held the dildo aloft for Debbie to make out the shrunken form of a woman &#39;molded&#39; in rubber. Every minor detail had survived the transformation making it obvious that it was in fact formerly human. The woman had even retained her coloration looking like a limbless statuette. Her eyes firmly shut and mouth wide open in the throes of horror and... pleasure...? The biggest oddity was the woman&#39;s anus had been made to serve as a suction cup at her base. Refusing an unspoken offer from Selicia&#39;s sparkling eyes, she watched the former woman disappear under the water and Selicia settle herself once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;As much as I hate to say it... That makes sense for you to make in the line of pleasure. So... Why do you make male toys?&quot; The question left her lips unbidden as Deborah realized how unnaturally she&#39;d calmed herself. Those sparkling eyes had held more than an offer...<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ll have to be more specific than that I&#39;m afraid~&quot;<br />
<br />
Just letting the feeling take her along for the ride, Deborah gave into the will of the more powerful woman. It was obvious that she&#39;d wanted to answer for her actions... &quot;I mean, like what you did with my... former &#39;comrades&#39; in the other room.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! That. That my dear, is merely for the fun of it. I take what serves so little purpose to me and give it new purpose. In their case, the only purpose they&#39;d had was bothering me and disturbing my work. So, with that in mind I reduced their overall purpose in existence to just one~&quot; Lifting a single finger above the water, Selicia sneered. &quot;An object of perverse release for others, one that I have no use for naturally. Thus now they have an unfulfilled purpose that they will be denied so long as I will it. In their special situation, aside from the little mage, none of them will -ever- serve that purpose. Thus they are denied their reason for even existing.&quot; A truly malicious grin spread across Selicia&#39;s face as she clamped tightly on the dildo underwater.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, dear. If you&#39;re going to wash, you may wish to hurry, I&#39;m edging myself as is~&quot; Selicia&#39;s expression changed to one of flushed amusement. This amusement was further fueled by watching Debbie reluctantly use the luffa and soap after all.<br />
<br />
Once out of the bath, Selicia gave Debbie one of her shorter gowns and slippers to wear as her clothing was quite literally no more. That didn&#39;t mean she&#39;d given her any underwear however~ Not that any of hers would fit anyways~ Seeing Debbie eyeing the shelf where she&#39;d been left for a month, Selicia inquired first. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, hmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
Deborah shrunk back a bit before, sighing softly. &quot;Mollie-&quot; Seeing an eyebrow raise in response, she &#39;corrected&#39; herself. &quot;The clear one... She&#39;s not going to last much longer... She was fading away more and more the whole time I was up there...&quot; Watching Selicia calmly nod as if considering what she&#39;d said. &quot;Is there-&quot; With a hushing finger against her lips, Deborah stopped speaking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, I&#39;ll preserve that one, wouldn&#39;t want them to escape would I?&quot; With a small gesture, Selicia felt the young woman&#39;s mind recover before locking it in it&#39;s state. She&#39;d taken the time to do the rest as well. Before returning her gaze to Debbie. &quot;There, all better~&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Does that mean...?&quot; The finger hushed Deborah once more followed by the shake of Selicia&#39;s head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that one is long gone, Dear. She&#39;ll remain that way as well. I won&#39;t fix what has been done to her psyche. She&#39;s better off that way.&quot; Selicia ushered Debbie out the door into the hallway without entertaining a further question in that regard. &quot;What say you, that we take a walk on the town, hmm?&quot; Without waiting for the response, Selicia magically transported the two of them to the downtown area.<br />
<br />
Watching Debbie momentarily swoon from the sudden change of scenery, Selicia set her eyes on a few opportunities. She&#39;d purposely picked the familiar diner as their starting point. Just wanting to ease the impact on the other woman. As they stood their, a familiar cheery woman passed the pair on her way into the diner. The former man had apparently very happily settled into her new life even further than expected. Wearing her uniform and humming a little tune as she entered the diner.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why... are we taking a &#39;walk&#39;?&quot; Deborah held her head and tried to shake out the fuzz in her thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to you -see-, Dear. I&#39;m going to show you just what I&#39;m capable of.&quot; Hushing Debbie a third time knowing a protest was coming, Selicia came upon her first target.<br />
<br />
A dark skinned woman was speaking curtly with another woman at a nearby outdoor table. She was a bit on the thicker side of things with her clothing clung tightly to her form. She seemed to be driving the conversation as her partner seemed to be responding more automatically than out of interest. Walking over to the pair, Selicia made certain to catch the latter&#39;s eyes as she interrupted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind my intrusion but, I&#39;d like to partake a bit. As long as you&#39;re fine with that.&quot; The dull eyed woman nodded before tuning out the conversation over again.<br />
<br />
The former woman scowled deeply at Selicia and opened her mouth in protest. Suddenly finding herself frozen in place as her eyes frantically searched for a cause. &quot;Settle yourself, it&#39;ll be over quite soon, I promise~&quot; With a snap of her fingers, the woman&#39;s clothing vanished leaving her exposed to the world. A swirl of colors and the former clothing had reformed into a large and thick ceramic mug at her feet.<br />
<br />
Deciding to be a bit show this time, Selicia settled the magic into the woman forcing her to kneel directly over the mug. A moment later her sex impossibly loosed a puff of steam before a dark fluid drained out into the mug. As the fluid flowed steadily from her lips to the mug her body seemed to melt from her head downward. Her head was already gone as her arms drained up into her shoulders. Steam drifted out of the mug as her breasts sunk into her dwindling chest. The next impossibility was when the woman&#39;s legs drained away leaving the vagina hovering above the now full mug.<br />
<br />
Selicia reached down cupping the vagina turning it in her hand to reveal it was now no more than a suggestively topped chocolate muffin. Collecting the mug from the ground with her other hand, she brought the muffin to her lips and took a hearty bite of the top. Thoughtfully she chewed the chocolate chip clit having settled for taking the &#39;best&#39; part for her bite. Licking the crumbs from her lips, she took a deep sip of the steaming dark liquid before setting both before the remaining woman. &quot;Just a bit bitter for my liking. Thank you for allowing me some though~&quot;<br />
<br />
The woman didn&#39;t even look at Selicia before lifting the mug toward her silently and taking a large draught of the coffee. After the following bite of the muffin, Debbie stepped forward with a look of disbelief.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did... Did you just feed this woman her friend...?&quot; She kept her voice down barely containing her shock at what she&#39;d just witnessed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? No~ I just asked for some of her coffee and muffin~ Isn&#39;t that right, miss?&quot; Another absent nod followed by a sip of coffee. &quot;It&#39;s so nice of them to sell it in such a large mug as well. Not to mention complimentary to take home~&quot; Selicia chuckled with a motion to move on.<br />
<br />
&quot;She just... She just watched you do it and -still- she just consumed her knowing...&quot; Hushed again, damn it all...<br />
<br />
&quot;She has no recollection of there ever being such a woman, nor does anyone else really~ She believes she came alone for a nice cup of coffee and a sizable muffin. Far be it from me to dispel her of that belief. I mean really, Dear. It&#39;s like this one over here...&quot; Selicia grabbed a hold of a skinny woman who&#39;d been arguing with a vendor over some nonsense.<br />
<br />
As her hand laid on the woman&#39;s shoulder, the woman near instantly deflated. Her clothes fell to the street and the vendor casually collected them before throwing it all directly in the trash can nearby. In Selicia&#39;s hand was the nude flattened form of the woman she&#39;d grabbed. The flattening had done her know favors taking away what little she&#39;d had in curves in the first place. Her face was still a visage of anger even as Selicia started her next show for Debbie.<br />
<br />
Starting from the top of the woman&#39;s head, Selicia grabbed there with both hands and pulled opposite directions. There was the sound of tearing paper... She&#39;d now held half of the woman in either hand. Giving Debbie only a moment to process what was going on, she layered the two halves together and tore them in half again. Repeating over and over again until she held a pile of flesh colored scraps in her hand. &quot;Ready?~&quot; As Debbie made to finally speak, Selicia threw the scraps into the air. The former woman fluttered down around them like confetti.<br />
<br />
&quot;You just killed her!&quot; Debbie&#39;s words burst out of her through the shock of it all. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you! You&#39;re a...&quot; A sinister stare cut her words short as the understanding that she was about to overstep dawned on her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I did no such thing... I merely tore up a nasty poster and scattered the remnants. That was no more a woman than that billboard across the street... You see, once what&#39;s done is done, it&#39;s not human anymore. Besides, she&#39;s not dead... Scattered certainly but, not dead. She&#39;ll persist like that until she can&#39;t anymore.&quot; Selicia shrugged matter-of-factively, marching forward down the street.<br />
<br />
&quot;You see, this is only a margin of what I&#39;m capable of. I can do whatever I want with most anyone I come across. However, I&#39;m not one for wanton acts of savagery and destruction... Ordinarily. I prefer to collect rather than consume and destroy. It&#39;s more of a hobby that way and little goes to waste.&quot; Eyeing one final example for their little trip, she spotted a prime opportunity that was just too perfect to pass on.<br />
<br />
One... Two... Three... Four... Four identical woman were standing outside of a store laughing and talking to one another. Even better for them and for Selicia was their bodies were quite something to behold. Each as pretty as the last and with breasts and asses the thing of jealousy~ Debbie must&#39;ve saw the gleam in her eye because she hung back at a considerable distance. Selicia approached but, maintained a respectfully distance for her show.<br />
<br />
Sending the line of magic forward, it ensnared the first of the women. Slowly a heat overtook her body and without any concern for her surroundings she&#39;d started to strip right in front of the others. Still the heat persisted uncomfortably, that was until her hand strayed over her sex. On a whim, she&#39;d sent one finger inside and relief poured over her. The more she rubbed and stroked herself the cooler her body had felt. At the same time, she&#39;d begun to shrink in a rate directly proportionate to her rubbing. Faster she&#39;d dwindle as she&#39;d picked up the pace, moaning languidly in her loudest voice. Soon she buckled onto all fours feeling the climax so close. Her tiny voice slowly disappeared as she&#39;d frozen on all fours only a foot tall could she stand. Her shimmering climax still dribbling from silicone lips.<br />
<br />
The next identical woman became ensnared but, this time she&#39;d simply had a strong desire to disrobe. So she did just what her heart told her to do. Moving to where the first had stood, she&#39;d unbuttoned her shirt and flung it aside. Next her bra came off and became hooked on a parking meter. Unzipping her skirt down it&#39;s side, she haphazardly tossed it onto the store&#39;s doormat. Her panties were sopping from her exhibitionist excitement when she removed them. With a mischievous giggle, she&#39;d slingshot them onto her sister&#39;s face. The wet panties clung to her cheek but, she&#39;d paid them no mind as she spoke to the other sister.<br />
<br />
A giggle escaped her lips, as she fondled her breasts roughly. She knelt down over the former sister giving her breasts a firm squeeze. She didn&#39;t even seem surprised when the thin streams of milk dribbled out. In fact, she&#39;d brought one up to her lips and give the nipple a lick. Paying no mind to her now shrinking body, she sucked hard on the nipple taking a mouthful of her milk in her mouth. As she swallowed, her climax came releasing itself and soaking her former sister beneath her. At the end of her show, she&#39;d ended up on all fours as well, holding her breasts together letting them dribble with nipples pointing forward. What was left was an identical silicone figure in a new pose.<br />
<br />
The next sister was grabbed by the pull of the magic and drawn to stand over the first two. Her clothing seemed to just lose it&#39;s hold on her. Down fell her dress encircling the two figures beneath her. She&#39;d surprised even Selicia seeing that she&#39;d gone commando today. It was her little secret from her sisters that she&#39;d enjoyed doing it. Even more so that she&#39;d secretly slip out in the dark of night to stroll nude through empty streets. Just the memories had already made her shudder out an orgasm already. Despite her desires and preferences, she&#39;d been content to grab both of her ass cheeks and fondle them firmly.<br />
<br />
She gripped, pulled, and parted her ass cheeks as she bit her lip in pleasure. Fuck why it was working for her, she&#39;d just felt amazing right now. Another orgasm dropped her to her knees as she coated the figures between her legs in another thin coat. She howled during that orgasm but, all that was heard was a tiny moan from the foot tall woman. Finally, she&#39;d frozen in place balanced on her knees and her hanging breasts as she became silicone like her sisters.<br />
<br />
The last sister fell under the spell at last and decided outshone the others. With a crazed fervor, she&#39;d ripped off her clothing. Shirt torn, shorts buttons popped, Bra straps snapped, and panty elastic broken. She huffed huskily as she&#39;d needed something, anything to satisfy this raging need. Reaching into her handbag that within moments found a new home in a decorative bush, she revealed her answer. She proffered a thick metal flashlight she carried for light and defense.<br />
<br />
Settling herself in the same spot as her sisters, she brought the flashlight down between her legs. In the flashlight went, her sex pulsed and gripped the rod greedily. Thrusting the impromptu toy deeply as she pinched and gripped her right breast. The light turned and off as the switch caught inside and outside of her sex. The sisters glistening in their special spotlight as a rush of juices glistened raining down upon them. Her mind consumed by the need for more, her tongue hung from her mouth as she removed the flashlight and readied it for round two.<br />
<br />
Positioning the rod underneath her anus, she shoved upward and buckled to her knees from the rush. She howled as a new flow of fluid gushed over her former sisters. Still she fought on the tighter hole refusing to take the flashlight past the switch. Frustration mounted as the flashlight didn&#39;t reach as deep with each new thrust. In desperation she squatted on the ground cramming the rod deeper by force. Pleasure mounted as again she&#39;d started to lose depth with the rod. She didn&#39;t care anymore however, as her shrinking body slid up the length, she climaxed one last time. Something tipped her over leaving her on all fours like the others. That was fine though, meant to be even, she thought as there was a pop before she too became silicone.<br />
<br />
Selicia had tapped the last of the sisters over with her foot watching as she flashlight audibly popped free. At her feet lay four identical statues with slightly different posing. The driest required only slight adjustment to be perfect for her intention. Easing the arms and hands into position, the former woman was balanced like her sister prior except her hands kept her anus widened enough to peek inside. Her tongue hanging out of her mouth in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
The next sister was balanced on knees and breasts as her hands parted only her ass cheeks to see the puckered lips inside. Her eyes still burning with desire. The third sister in the pile dribbling milk from her presented nipples. Milk had even dribbled from her mouth still hanging open. The first and yet final sister dripped fluids mixed from all of them together. Her fingers still thrust into her parted sex as she silently howled her pleasure.<br />
<br />
As Debbie approached Selicia seeing the spectacle was finally over, Selicia added the finishing touches. She stacked the sisters in the order that they&#39;d been changed. The first sister soaked in fluids at the bottom while the last sat on top of the stack. The sex of the one higher dribbling down the rear of the next one down. Turning she displayed the stack to Debbie who recoiled in surprise. &quot;What? Don&#39;t like my little totem pole? I think it&#39;s just lovely~&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing Debbie about to disapprove, Selicia sighed. &quot;Some people just don&#39;t understand true art...&quot; With a pause for consideration that made Debbie take a few steps back, Selicia shrugged. &quot;Well Dear, I think that&#39;s enough excitement for you today~ I&#39;ll see my way home, we&#39;ll be in touch. I promise~&quot; Having said her piece, Selicia took a step and found herself at home again. &quot;Now... I just need a place for all of you~&quot;</p>
