<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan just sat on his bed for a few moments, too shocked to do anything else.  &quot;I guess she wasn't kidding,&quot; he thought, &quot;She really is a witch.  And I guess I get to be her new plaything,&quot; he thought glumly.  &quot;Really, turning her own brother into an animal?  That's sick!  Telling me all about how my humanity's going to slip away, piece by piece...&quot;  He shook his head, new ears moving from side-to-side as he did.  &quot;When Mom and Dad find out...&quot;  But he trailed off.  Deep down, he knew his parents wouldn't really do anything.  Kat could act dumb, but she was smart enough not to do something that would get her in serious trouble.<br />
<br />
Best case scenario, they were appalled at what had happened, but Kat convinced them she hadn't meant to, and was still getting used to her powers.  He would be turned back to normal, but she'd be fine, and she'd likely do more to him whenever she wanted, with another &quot;accident.&quot;  Then there was the worst case scenario: like she said, Mom and Dad would be fine with it.  He shivered as he considered that they might be fine with their son living the rest of his life as an animal.  It seemed crazy, but so did the idea of magic, about which, as he gave his new ears a poke and winced at the twitch they gave, he could no longer be skeptical  But he had enough faith in his parents to think they wouldn't leave him like that.  Still, family dynamics might not be so fun.  He thought about fantasy stories, where the magic-users sometimes turn into the upper class, with freedom to do whatever they like to the powerless commoners.  He'd always thought his sister was the favorite, and it might be practically official, now.  She might be allowed to do whatever she liked to him, as long as she didn't kill him.  Considering how power-mad she seemed to get when allowed to babysit, he trembled at what she'd do with actual magic.<br />
<br />
Realizing how his life might soon suck beyond his wildest dreams, Dan got rather pissed off.   &quot;It's not fair!  I've always been a good, hard-working person, and she's been a lazy bitch, so how come she gets magic?  If I could do half of what she can, I wouldn't have said, 'Animal time for Kat!' right off the bat!&quot;  It spoke to his honesty that Dan didn't claim he would NEVER consider transforming his sister.  &quot;I'd do something good for the world!  I mean, what right does she have?&quot;  But he knew all too well what right she had: that of the strong over the weak.  A right he would become intimately familiar with if he was truly joining the animal kingdom.  The realization numbed his rage.  There wasn't really anything he could do, at the moment, so he decided he should pass the time guessing at what he was turning into.<br />
<br />
No other animal features had sprouted in the last few minutes, so Dan started with the ears.  He ran his fingertips along his ears from the base up.  After at least six inches of furry length, he finally reached their pointy tips.  &quot;Hmm, what animal has long, pointed ears?&quot;  There were plenty of others, but there was one that came to mind.  &quot;I might be turning into a rabbit.&quot;  He frowned.  &quot;That would be kinda lame.  I was hoping I'd at least be a predator, not a little bunny.&quot;  He sighed.  He then remembered Kat had said the animal would reflect his inner self.  &quot;...  So, what does a rabbit mean?&quot;  He then remembered The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, and chuckled a little, despite himself.  &quot;That's right, stepping into the Dark World turned people into their true forms, and Link turned into a bunny man.  ...  Heh, I guess it would be something if a rabbit means I'm heroic.&quot;  He was still scared of the whole situation, but he felt better that he was at least able to laugh at it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Link turned into a pink bunny, so I guess I should get a look at the color.  And it couldn't hurt to get used to seeing myself with them, I guess.&quot;  With some hesitation, Dan hopped off his bed and walked to a mirror that had come with his room.  He looked at himself, finding his image very odd with those alien things on his head.  He scratched at one of them, and watched it twitch in the mirror.  &quot;Hmm, gray.  Link's fur was the color of his hair, so I thought they might be brown.  Come to think of it, pink was one hell of a weird...&quot;  He trailed off as he realized something.  The only animal he'd thought of was a rabbit.  But, now that he saw himself with long, gray, pointed ears, he finally caught up with the rest of the CYOC viewers reading this and thought of another.  &quot;...  Oh, no.&quot;<br />
<br />
Over the past few hours, he had thought about animals he'd be alright with, and creatures he would hate to become.  The present consideration was squarely in the second camp.  &quot;A donkey!?&quot;  He felt, as he saw in the mirror, his ears flatten against his skull, an alien feeling that only set his heart pumping even faster.  &quot;No, no that's not it.  It's not.  Yeah, I think they really do look like rabbit ears.  Yeah.&quot;  He didn't know enough about animals to tell just from appearance, so his words rang hollow.  Dan truly did not want to become a beast of burden spoken of in fables for its stupidity and stubbornness.  Kat's words about the creature representing his true nature would be the twist of the knife.  Particularly since he had far too easy a time coming up with ways a jackass suited his personality.  Whether this resulted from personal honesty or an inferiority complex didn't much matter to him.<br />
<br />
So, Dan stood there for a time, staring and prodding at his new ears, and whispering, &quot;C'mon bunny, bunny, bunny...&quot;  Part of him wanted another change to answer the question of what he was becoming.  But he mostly wanted to hang onto his humanity as long as he could.  Regardless, he wondered when the next change would come, and what it would be.</p>
