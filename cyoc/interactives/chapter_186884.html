<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After class was done, Zeke decided to go ahead and check on Cole a bit to see how things were altered with that drastic shift in reality. Cole seemed a lot different from Clyde, and seeing what was going on with him might provide some more inspiration. The first thing he was struck by after class when he went outside was how popular Cole was. Clyde had been more or less a wallflower - whereas Cole was outgoing, energetic, confident bordering on cocky, but also very intelligent.<br />
<br />
He wore a tank top that exposed a good deal of his pecs, shoulders, and arms, sitting pretty at 220 lbs of muscle mass, tight, booty hugging jeans, and sneaker shoes. His features were more or less based on Clyde&#39;s thin features but with the addition of all that muscle, Cole had become a handsome, model-like figure. He was almost as ripped as Zeke was, and with the changes to the world he could kind of remember working out with Cole a few times. Huh. Weird. He would have to try and limit using that reality changing option so willy nilly. That was a shift he hadn&#39;t exactly thought might happen.<br />
<br />
Everybody wanted to talk to cool guy Cole it seemed, and he wasn&#39;t exactly averse to it. Unlike Clyde who had been keen to socially isolate himself.<br />
<br />
Once Cole and Zeke started walking alongside each other, Cole clapped Zeke&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;Man, last night&#39;s leg workout was killer! Remember hitting those last sets of squats? Fuuuck...&quot; Cole ran a hand through his hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah man, you knocked it outta the park. How&#39;d you even get through that last set?&quot; Zeke found himself remembering it off the top of his head - remembering lifting with Cole. Both their shirts off, both wearing tiny short shorts. The way Cole&#39;s powerfully built legs bulged with muscle when he squatted down, how his ass displayed itself through the thin fabric...it was almost lewd in the way it looked. But it was indisputably masculine. <br />
<br />
Both of them had showered afterwards - Cole even going as far as singing in the showers. Of course on top of everything else, Cole had a wonderful singing voice.<br />
<br />
Zeke almost wondered if he made Cole simply &quot;too good&quot;.<br />
<br />
As they continued walking, Zeke asked Cole, &quot;So, what class do you have next?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honors Economics,&quot; Cole answered with a sigh, &quot;And you know how that is, right?&quot; Cole seemed oddly resigned about this for some reason. What a weird downward emotional turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Is...something wrong with that class? I mean as far as I remember you ace it like you ace everything else.&quot; Zeke responded, wondering if there was some part of Cole&#39;s life that wasn&#39;t quite doing so hot all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Cole started, &quot;The teacher, Mr. Blake, isn&#39;t exactly really supporting his students very well. He&#39;s always late to class, he&#39;s always on his phone, and more focused on his girlfriends than teaching.&quot; Ahh yes, Mr. Blake. Well, Zeke was pretty interested in this case now. Maybe it could be a source of inspiration for something else to do with Cole. Decisions decisions decisions...<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re pretty fired up about this,&quot; Zeke said, thumbing the Chronivac enabled phone in his pocket.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve always been really passionate about teaching, learning new things, strengthening and bettering myself - making sure others have the same opportunities,&quot; Cole stated as he crossed his arms in front of his broad chest. &quot;I just wish I could show Mr. Blake how it&#39;s really done. How to really be a teacher that can inspire his students.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, that was a wish Zeke decided he could fulfill. Now, he liked Cole, so he decided not to make the change that occurred stay that way for too terribly long. A mischievous smile tugged at Zeke&#39;s face, which he suppressed and he commented, &quot;So you&#39;d like to try being a teacher yourself then, if you could.&quot; Zeke wondered if he would go as far as---<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, yeah actually I would,&quot; Cole smiled and flexed his bicep, &quot;I want to be able to set a good example as someone who can be both physically engaged and mentally capable. If the teacher can&#39;t do the job because he&#39;s distracted by all these things...well, I just kind of wish I could give the job a try. See how I can do.&quot; A sigh from Cole, &quot;I just...don&#39;t have any experience. I am after all eighteen, like many others in the class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, Zeke decided, he could well change that! &quot;I&#39;ll be heading off to get ready for class, bro. See you around?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, make sure and study for that test you got coming up in English!&quot; Ah Cole, as usual academically minded and physically brilliant. Zeke figured he could let him keep those attributes even as he changed. Well, as best as he could. He pulled into a men&#39;s bathroom and pulled out the phone with the Chronivac open to engage. He pulled up Cole&#39;s file - and gave a whistle. <br />
<br />
Cole had gone through a few relationships according to this file, none of them ended in a bitter way - more just a case of high school sweethearts growing apart. His current girlfriend was Miranda Hollis, from the cheer squad - a raven haired beauty who often came in to watch Zeke and Cole workout. Zeke remembered seeing her distinctly appreciating the sight of Cole and Zeke in their short shorts. As far as other elements, Cole came from a pretty well off family now, he maintained a fitness instagram dedicated to giving out fitness advice to struggling gym goers...<br />
<br />
Good guy, all around.<br />
<br />
Now to look at Mr. Blake. Tom Blake on the other hand was a dark haired teacher slowly growing out of his handsome earlier years, he was the Honors Econ teacher AND the regular Econ teacher mostly due to a lack of people with those expertise. He was muscular, still, but starting to put on a few pounds on the edges. He still tried to live the life of a young lothario, prowling the bars and night clubs for willing young women. He styled his dark hair back to minimize the look of his declining hairline. And he apparently disliked being a teacher - it was more something he went for when every other opportunity dried up. Tom was 43 years old, and apparently lived with his similarly wastrel-like sister.<br />
<br />
Now for the transformation.<br />
<br />
Zeke started with Cole - deciding to give him what he wanted. He set up the transformation such that eighteen year old Cole would age up such that he could become the experienced teacher able to provide for his students as he wanted. He debated internally about how much experience was good enough experience, and went with making it end with Cole at 50 temporarily, at least until the school could hire a new teacher after all was said and done. He filled out some expertise to add to Cole&#39;s existing smarts.<br />
<br />
The change would take place over a week, and in order to make sure Cole didn&#39;t decay during that, Zeke added a bit where 50 year old Cole would &quot;workout for aesthetics and longevity, being the buffest teacher on campus by far&quot;. The change would last for an entire month, during which Cole could act as the Honors Economics teacher.<br />
<br />
Now for Mr. Blake. The man obviously had no liking for teaching, so maybe it would be best to return him to student and see if he could have a better second attempt with better guidance. So Zeke went ahead and set up a change where Tom Blake would, over the course of a week, regress back to 18 and become a student. Ironically enough, in Cole&#39;s own class.<br />
<br />
With that, Zeke set up the change and got it started. He honestly felt eager to see where this one went. He now had the cases of Nate, Brad and Danny to look forward to today, Chris to check up on, and the switching positions of Cole and Mr. Blake over the course of a week. Honestly, as Zeke headed off to class, he felt pretty accomplished!</p>
