<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Science class was actually normal and since they had a test, something that would have happened even before the entire world changed from her point of view after they finished the teacher let them look at their phones. Since Science was one of her best classes she breezed through the test with ease and got onto her phone. She began to move her fingers as fast as she could across the touch screen as she began to do some research on the world she now found herself in.<br />
<br />
To her horror, it was just as she was told, arranged marriages where the custom borderline law. Yes there was some give and take, an 18 year old like she was often married within months of the fair happening but a year wasn’t unheard of either but 20 was the deadline. As for saying no, that was a no go unless for abuse of any kind and even then, legally it could end but she would just retire the system but at a higher age bracket and go through the process all over again, the only benefit of going through again was that she would have more say on whom she married but she would be married either way. The only time she would not have to go back into the system was when she was a senior citizen, they where allowed to remain single but from her 20th birthday at the latest till she was 65 she would have to be married or in the process of getting remarried. <br />
<br />
She always hated history, but she pulled up the history of marriages on the internet and this type of system had replaced traditional marriages and dating as far back as recorded history started. There parents would sell their sons and daughters for cows and sheep. Now it was cold hard cash, stocks or even business deals. She read a headline about the heir to some company being sold to son of another major company and now the companies where merging together. <br />
<br />
There where self-help books and guides on how best to put on a show to get the most out of yourself and shows helping people do that. There was even reality tv shows following around teens as they prepared for the event. She searched up stories like Romeo and Juliet only to find it had changed from a story of tragic true love to one of kids not accepting their parents wishes only to find their parents where right and falling in love anyhow. Their union ending a war between families instead of both dead. Other stories where the same.<br />
<br />
“This can’t be.” Whispered Jen as the teacher eyed her which told her to be quiet.  <br />
<br />
It seamed that this world she found herself in, she did notice that gay/lesbian marriages where now totally accepted and there where even stories about polygamy families with one women having multiple husbands instead of the opposite which was more often the case in her world. <br />
<br />
The bell was about to ring as she looked to her right to see Stacy talking with Alex, Stacy wasn’t on the cheer squad with her and Alex but Stacy was Alex’s best friend and captain of the swim team which earned her a high position on the hierarchy of the school. She was also in a very long-term relationship with Adam who was a linebacker on the football team. The two of them had been dating each other since middle school and everyone saw them as destined to be married with a house and children with a white picket fence.<br />
<br />
“Ya…my father and Adam’s family have already come to an arrangement.” Said Stacy in a cool voice. “Both of us want to be together and once Saturday comes we will make it official and within 2 weeks I will be married, I can’t wait. All they are waiting on is our test results and I get mine next period.”<br />
<br />
Jen gulped, she had never had a long term boyfriend and as she looked around she began to get a sense that Stacy wasn’t the only one who already had arranged marriages lined up. <br />
<br />
“My parents have already taken offers from three families for my hand.” Said a boy with pride. “I hope they pick the hot girl, I don’t really want the other one.”<br />
<br />
“It will be the other girl, she has had a crush on you for years and her family is loaded.” Laughed his friend. “Your parents will take the money for you.”<br />
<br />
“I hope not, but it would be better than the guy who’s family put an offer in for me.” admitted the first guy as the color drained from Jenn’s face. “Maybe I’ll just put on a huge show and get someone from outside our area to pick me up.”  <br />
<br />
The bell rang as Jen got up and headed out the door to her next class, sexual orientation and you. She found the class easy enough it was the health room but now it had taken over the religious studies classroom as well making a massive room near the heart of the school. She walked in behind Stacy who took a paper from the teacher and scanned it.<br />
<br />
“Yes…I got an above average!” yelled Stacy as Jen looked at her confused until she was handed a paper as well.<br />
<br />
Results of Fertility test.<br />
<br />
Above Average, no defects found, followed by a list of medical text and a state seal. <br />
<br />
“Remember keep this your parents will need it for your showing, now go back and get ready to present you reports on your kinks or fetish.” Said the teacher a middle age woman, as Jen looked around the room.<br />
<br />
 The room wasn’t as big as she though, but she saw two doors in the back, one marked men, the other women and everyone was going toward them as if they where locker rooms. In the center of the room was a series of desks but around the room where multiple sex toys, a stripper pole was in each corner, three beds, one of which had handcuffs on it and other stuff. As she watched a boy dressed in a leather horse outfit with bit and everything came out of the guys locker room as a girl in a sexy horse rider top came out the girls. Both paired up and began to talk about how they would present their topic as if it was nothing more then a normal book report. <br />
<br />
“Jen hurry up.” Said the teacher as Jenn rushed into the girl’s locker room. What she saw took her breath away, all around her where her classmates getting into pieces of lingerie which they pulled from small lockers with their names on it. One of them was busy getting into a furry suit, another was making sure leather latex was ready and two of the girls where practicing a make out session while another was doing a practice blow on a fake penis strapped to another classmate’s bikini bottom. <br />
<br />
Jen looked down trying not to scream when she moved to a locker with her name on it. She opened it up and found her finished report on the kink/fetish she would be reporting on and everything she would need to present the topic. <br />
<br />
“God…no.” whispered Jen as she looked at the report.</p>
