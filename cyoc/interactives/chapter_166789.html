<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It seemed that your Dad and Tim were becoming incredibly on edge. The three of you had recently used the magic socks to become each other and throughout <br />
the process had experienced new sensations and perspectives but it had been long<br />
<br />
Incredibly Long&quot; as Tim had put it. He had begged you nonstop to try the socks but you told him that it just wasn&#39;t the time. After all, your Mom still had no idea of the magic socks and the three of you did not want her finding out. But although Tim consistently begged you your Dad only pulled you to the side one morning to ask if he could use the socks Friday. &quot;Why do you need them?&quot; You asked him.<br />
<br />
Your Dad became quiet for a moment before telling you that your Mom was going to visit some family over the weekend and that it was the perfect opportunity to try the socks. You agreed before realizing that Tim had a soccer game that day. &quot;Do n&#39;t worry I can drop Tim off and come back home&quot; Your Dad said. &quot;But what about when you pick him up?&quot; You asked. &quot;Don&#39;t worry the game ends in two hours, by then we&#39;ll change back&quot; He responded.<br />
<br />
You decide to agree with the plan so on Friday you tell you Mom goodbye and watch your Dad pull out of the driveway with Tim who had no idea of your plan.<br />
While the two of them were gone you headed upstairs and grabbed the magic sock from the hidden compartment of your sock drawer. You take off your clothes and put on the magic socks. &quot;Now who do I want to become?&quot; You ask aloud.<br />
<br />
You begin to walk in the hallway and spot Tim&#39;s bedroom opened. You shrug your shoulders and decide to become Tim. You walk in and find a pair of his shoes hifden under his bed. You placed them on your feet and find yourself shrinking. You begin to regress losing body hair and muscle mass until you had become a prepubescent boy again. &quot;I&#39;m definitely going to enjoy this&quot; you say knowing that this time you were in full control of how long you had to remain as Tim.<br />
<br />
You open Tim&#39;s door and race into the bathroom to see your reflection. You caress your body which feels incredibly smooth. Your eyes fall to your penis and remembering what your Dad had done before you begin to touch your balls. The odd sensation returns and you find youself enjoying the feeling. &quot;What are you doing son?&quot; A voice says. You open your eyes to see your Dad staring at you caressing your balls in Tims body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! I was just...&quot; you stammer before your Dad holds his hand up. &quot;It&#39;s ok son. After all, when I was Tim I also explored his body but you might want some help&quot;. You give your Dad the magic socks and when he returns he had become Tim. &quot;Wait! Dad weren&#39;t you goin to become me?&quot; You ask him. &quot;Well I know you want someone with you while you were exploring so I decided I might as well be Tim&quot;. <br />
The two of you leave the bathroom and decide to go to your parents bedroom instead.<br />
<br />
When you enter, your Dad instantly comes behind you and begins to touch your body. &quot;Dad!&quot; You exclaimed in surprise. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Son Im only trying to give you some advice&quot; Your Dad said. He touches your balls and dick and rubs your nipples. &quot;See no matter how much you try you can&#39;t get hard&quot; Your dad said. You blush as you feel your Dad touch your body which he was now an exacr copy of.<br />
&quot;Dad I think I can do it by myself&quot; you tell him and he backs off. &quot;Ok son I&#39;ll be rig<br />
over here tryin some things on my own&quot; Your Dad said.<br />
<br />
You watch him enter his bathroom and you follow him to see him touching himself. &quot;It feels nice to not be so heavy anymore&quot; your Dad said rubbing his belly. &quot;But I do miss my beard&quot; He said rubbing his cheeks. &quot;Dad? Do you want someone else to lend a hand&quot; you ask him before rubbing his balls. This time your Dad closes his eyes and moans. &quot;Son! That feels so dann good!&quot; He says before rubbin yours.<br />
<br />
The two of you caress each other and as the two of you feel pleasure your Dad stops. &quot;Wait here! I have an idea...&quot; your Dad runs off leaving you alone. &quot;Man Dad was right! Being young again is awesome&quot; You stare at the mirror realizing you were slowlybecoming acquainted with Tim&#39;s reflection.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe I should change back soon&quot; You say before you hear your Dad say&quot;Wait&quot; In an oddly familiar voice. You step out of the bathroom to see your body standing in the middle of your parents bedroom with a boner. &quot;Dad! What are you doing?&quot; <br />
You ask him beginning to become embarrassed. &quot;I thought we could try your body next&quot; He said. &quot;But Dad thats already my body... I won&#39;t experience anything new I might as well stay in this one&quot; you whine.<br />
<br />
&quot;If my son keep that attitude up I might just have to discipline him&quot; he walks over to you and you look up at your imposing figure. &quot;Dad what are you...&quot; but your Dad doesn&#39;t wait and hoists you onto the bed. &quot;Lets see how this feels&quot; he says climbing on top of you and placing your dicks together. Once again the difference is embarassing but your Dad cotninues to use his body to compare yours......<br />
<br />
He then lifts you up and places you on his lap with his greater strength . &quot;How do your balls feel?&quot; He asks as he holds you sitting front to front. Your hands waver as you feel your Dads balls which seem huge in comparison to yours. Even your balls had dropped a bit in your old body. &quot;This is what a maturing man looks like&quot; he says exposing your body hair. You watch him frolic your pubes and dick. Before comparing your own dick.&quot;Dad I surrender just stop this is so embarassing&quot; You say. &quot;Nothing wrong in two boys comparing their bodies just one happens to be a few years older&quot; he says. He puffs out his chest and lets you go. &quot;Dad why did you do that?&quot; You ask him. He gives you a look before saying &quot;I figured if you wanted to stay in that body you might as well realize how much you really compare to an older boy&quot;. You apologize realizing just how weak you were as Tim.<br />
<br />
Perhaps your Dad was right. You couldn&#39;t just become Tim anytime, especially if Tim was in a stronger body. It could probably put you in trouble. You tell him you were going to immediately change back to normal. &quot;Actually there&#39;s something else I wanted to tell you&quot; your Dad sayss. &quot;I got a call from school saying you skipped last week&quot; he says glaring at you with your annoyed expression. &quot;But Dad! Nobody goes on the last day of school and I only left a period early&quot; You explain. He shakes his head &quot;No excuses! As punishment I&#39;m going to leave you in Tim&#39;s body for the resf of the day&quot;<br />
<br />
You frown and begin to speak but youe Dad cuts you off. &quot;Don&#39;t worry I won&#39;t let Tim find out but until tomorrow you are to stay in your own room and that body. You storm out of your parents bedroom in a mad manner. You couldn&#39;t believe it! Your Dad was grounding you from using the magic socks until tomorrow. Even worssa, he was fprcing you to stay as Tim until then. You enter your room and sigh in disappointment. Looks like you were going to stay as your younger brother for a little longer. <br />
<br />
You ythen spot your clothes lying on the floor. &quot;Man I used to fit into this!&quot; You say grabbing your boxers off the floor. You try to attempt to put them on but they only fall off your tiny body. &quot;Looks like I need some of Tim&#39;s clothes for the now&quot; you say aloud and entering Tim&#39;s room You find some of Tim&#39;s clothea in his dreaser and put on some of his cartoon briefs and a pair of his pajamas.<br />
<br />
You walk out of your room to see your Dad back in his body and dressed. Don&#39;t worry I put everything back. But im not going to give  you the magic socks back until tomorrow&quot;. He says. &quot;Fine! But make sure Tim doesn&#39;t find out&quot; you say. Your Dad says he promises he won&#39;t tell Tim and leaves to pick him up from soccer. You walk back to your room and close the door before laying on your much larger bed.</p>
