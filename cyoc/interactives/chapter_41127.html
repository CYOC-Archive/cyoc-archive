<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Russ knew of a man, an elderly man, a nice ma, a good friend to all those who liked what he liked, ponies.<br />
<br />
Almost every day Russ went to help this man with his ponies, and the thought of being one lay in his thoughts for some time. The granted wish of the gypsy woman upon the two boys had them thinking often to be as various forms, and then they would change into those forms, usual those belonging to animals, pet and the like.<br />
<br />
One of the first they both tried, the becoming of two pet Labrador retriever dogs, both as stud mature males, but it was Jack who got them in trouble.<br />
<br />
They were as if the pair of dogs owned by classmate Karen Addison and her parents. Spending of a day and a night both as if her two dogs tended to bring odd sensing wants, as if they should forget their own selves, and remain then as dogs.<br />
<br />
They agreed to go it for a second day and owe up to wandering off as a reason for their disappearance to loving parents.<br />
<br />
Jack became too friendly with Karen and she had a slumber party of friends over for a Friday night party. The parents away, the cheap wine flowed and girls became unruly. <br />
<br />
Jack was the center of attention, while Russ went off to lie down and sleep off a busy day of dogged play.<br />
<br />
Tina Measly was a well endowed young female, and drunk as she was, she began to feel up the big male doggy. One thing led to another, this Jack made mention of later. Jack became aroused, really up and when his big Labrador red prick protruded his sheath, a drunken young lady took hold of it, jerking it, and seeing it spurt and spit, she mouthed it in front of all her friends.<br />
<br />
One girl pleasured was not to outdone by another, and when the play got round to Karen taking her turn, she lay then out flat for the big dog to give her a good licking.<br />
<br />
Jack licked, his thoughts going the way most young males do of his age, and spirited on by being then as is a male dog, he took added liberties. Liberties that had him soon humped over the back of Karen, he thrusting, poked into her, and was coming close to having a male dog orgasm.<br />
<br />
Karen felt the coming spurts and pulled out the doggy prong. She got angry at her friends, sending them to take a cold shower and sober up. <br />
<br />
Tina corral Jack, he still horny as all hell, he went with her into a bathroom and there did complete his sensual time with a drunken slut of a female.<br />
<br />
Jack reported he felt no remorse for Tina, especially when his semen spewed inside her, and she nearly howled form her sensations.<br />
<br />
The two friends learned a rule of caution, one of which Russ forgot when he had Jack come and help him while working an afternoon at the pony farm.<br />
<br />
Drunken girls get horny, but mares in their times of estrus become vehemently more than horny, they would accept any male able to stand behind them and do it! So as they worked helping the friend to Russ, Jack saw and met then with a red roan mare by the name of Francine.<br />
<br />
Francine, a Connemara Irish bred pony mare, she having a sleek and lusty body, of such conformation her owner kept the mare only for breeding purposes.<br />
<br />
Beguiling to Jack, he got Russ to looking at the mare and then poised to question of the two friends becoming stallion ponies and he getting it on with this lusty mare.<br />
<br />
Russ wanted not of that, as the mare though in her six month period of estrus, her owner had on plans to mate her then or soon. He remarked that the having and caring of nine ponies was enough of a financial burden to his pocketbook.<br />
<br />
Jack did not care, and with some major verbal maneuvering, he coaxed Russ into joining with him and making a wish they be a twin born pony stallions, they of the same sleek breed as was Francine. Jack worked his plan with great skill and cunning, he asked the farm owner if he might place with him two identical pony stallions, and have them boarded there for a few days.<br />
<br />
The friendly man agreed, but on the basis the ponies were as temporary residents there, and not for a long term stay.<br />
<br />
Later one night the friends met at the stables, they wished their wishing and soon each stood in a box stall, both identical to the other with the exception that each knew the other and of their own past, present, and personal feelings.<br />
<br />
Jack got his wish and as well opened his stall door, striding over to the mare, he stood there, did the equine ritual of a stallion asking to mate with a mare, and then he stood up behind her.<br />
<br />
Russ whinnied his disgust, doing so, so loud was he that the farm owner came to his stables and discovered one of the boarded stallion ponies busy inseminating his prize mare.<br />
<br />
Angered by this, the man had the two ponies boarded at a nearby farm, the stables more a mess and the care much less than what Russ liked. Once there the friends found themselves slit up, Russ placed in the far back pasture, he with the geldings; while horny Jack found his newest residency in a pasture and near nineteen friendly mares.<br />
<br />
In order to assert their transformation back to being those troublesome boys again, the two needed to touch noses, make the same mutually wanted wish, and soon find they were changed. Russ stayed the month in his pasture, whether rain or shine, by day and nights, stuck there and unable to wish himself back to being his original self.<br />
<br />
Jack continued to relish in his many courtships, he mated with a mare five times and some more before his seeds did them their trick.<br />
<br />
They arrived in that pasture during the wet month of March, but as September became October and tree leaves turned colors, Jack looked at his pastured friend with a longing to go home and take a needed hot shower.<br />
<br />
Fall times and the October Fest festival meant a parade and the farm owners got together, each harnessed up a team of fine horseflesh and went to join in and be a part in a parade through the town.<br />
<br />
Luckily, as for Russ and Jack too, they found their exceptional pony male bodies as needed to be a part in the parade; this offered them time together and a time when to pressing noses, they might change back in time to study hard and graduate with the rest of their friends.</p>
