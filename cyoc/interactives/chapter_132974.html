<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Of the choices that you saw, it was the fox that caught your eye.  The image presented was a majestic looking vixen with orange fur and that canine stance.<br />
<br />
Upon your selection, the screen came up, presenting an already selected name, &#39;Vicki&#39;.  A bit generic but you were likely just going to get a doll or certificate at best. Moving on, the questions got strange.  You were presented with a slider, with one side labeled &#39;Cold&#39; and the other one &#39;Hot&#39;. Unsure what this could mean, and trying to reason this out, it&#39;s easier to take clothes off than put them on so &#39;Hot&#39; seemed the better choice.<br />
<br />
The next two questions presented a slider ranging from 0 to 10. &#39;Litter Line&#39; was first, followed by &#39;Cycle&#39;, with it starting on 5 for &#39;52 D&#39;, whatever that meant.  Giving little care other to get through it quickly, you pushed each slider to 10 and moved on to the last screen, which simply asked you to confirm that you wanted to take the &#39;Bullseye challenge&#39;.  There wasn&#39;t an option other than to confirm so you did, and were rewarded with a smiling pixelated fox face with hearts over its head.<br />
<br />
Stepping back from the screen, there was a rattling like something tumbling down a chute.  Not a moment later, a pink collar with triangle tag slid out from a hole at the base of the wall to stop between your feet.  Before you could look, the door was shut and silence followed.<br />
<br />
Ever the curious one, you pick up the collar and look it over. It appears to be just pink nylon with a tag that, when turned, revealed a fox head in the inverted triangle, with pink bow to boot. And then, taped to the back of the collar, you notice a tiny slip of paper.  Unfolding it, the tiny text requires you to lift it right to your eyes, the collar now dangling from your fingers near your neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Breed and be many,&quot; you read from the minuscule print. You only have a moment to ponder the meaning when the air catches in your throat and you feel something tighten your voice away.  Your hands go to your neck, trying to pry the collar off which seemed almost possessed. Or some futuristic pet tech. Even with all your might, the back clipped and the release sealed shut.  Tugging at hard as you can, you only make it harder to breath than it already was.<br />
<br />
You let go and take a moment to catch your breath, trying to comprehend how the hell that just happened. There is just enough of a shine on the small screen to see your reflection.  The collar is tight on you, just to the point of not leaving any lasting marks. The tag now hangs at your neck.  Turning it in your hand with a sigh, you notice the name &#39;Vicki&#39; has been lightly carved into the metal. Your eyes fluttered as you felt a strange heat emanating from the collar.<br />
<br />
Just as you let go of your new tag, you notice something odd in the reflection.  You turn your hands to confirm and feel pit immediately form in your stomach.  Your nails were all turning dark from the cuticle while a very light black. Looking at your other hand, it was a similar story only the new shade had grown to the tip but was still growing out into almost sharp nails.<br />
<br />
Your hand slap to your side and you&#39;re trying to catch your breath.  Telling yourself it was just the trick of the light and the slight blood loss to the head. It was the twinge at the base of your spine that very frightened your senses. As goosebumps popped up all over your skin, your hands slid slowly around to butt, then up to the oddly loose waistband of your jeans.  You unbuckle your belt for some room, only thinking to check if anyone was looking once your underwear were exposed.  <br />
<br />
With more worry in your mind as to what was happening to you than of embarrassment, you pulled down your underwear and hoped you wouldn&#39;t feel what you were starting to dread was there. Sooner than expected, your fingers found five inches of grown tail extending from above your ass. Shutting your eyes, as if to try and think clearly, you quickly realize your mistake.  You&#39;re suddenly in tune with more than just your tail and nails.<br />
<br />
The tugs at your ears hurt, at they started to take on a point and slowly slid up your head. Your toes were feeling cramped in your shoes, and your nipples were hard. It&#39;s when you feel a tingling in your cock that you quickly shove your tail- just starting to plume its first fur- into your pants and then tighten your belt to a point where you&#39;re lacking notches. Dumbfounded for a moment, your lips start to tremble as the reason for your hasty modesty made itself known.  A weak, trembling orgasm barely registers to you, but the emptying of your testicles and the staining of the front of your jeans were things you could feel.<br />
<br />
You then feel as if you&#39;re not alone anymore.  Ears twitching on their own, you&#39;re directed down at your feet where a fox, and a male by his scent- his scent?-, was rubbing against your leg. You let go of your pants as you put your hands across your chest to guard yourself from the new company. This only results in your pants falling around your ankles, your underwear falling mostly to the ground, and the realization that you had more than two nipples now.  <br />
<br />
Hands moving up and down your chest, you look down and see the two rows budding under your shirt.  Eight already and not to far above your groin, nine and ten were showing still as red splotches.  Soon to grow though.  It was below that where you felt the worst. With your stomach and frame losing mass, it allowed you a clear line of sight to the shriveled nub that was your cock, barely recognizable.  Below that, your testicles had re-purposed to what you had been feeling since you felt that tail coming in. <br />
<br />
Not letting you ease in, the fox jumps as your leg and easily slides between your thinned legs to that wet sweet spot that was your swollen vixen cunt. You wanted to cry out but instead managed a shaky bark, leaving your face incredibly numb.<br />
<br />
You lean forward over the screen, arms on the wall while trying to figure some way to stop this. Punching the screen was made difficult by the shortening of your fingers and pads starting to form on your palms. Still, you managed to bring up a menu while also keeping the fox at bay from you.<br />
<br />
There had to be a way to reverse this, but all options were greyed out but &#39;Details...&#39;.  Desperate, you press the button, only to bring up that fox face again, this time with a dialogue bubble.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Vicki,&quot; the greeting read, making your body shiver and shrink a bit faster than it already was.  With the screen quickly starting to get above you, you tried to read the text in hopes of some reprieve.  &quot;Your new mate, Victor, will bringing you into your new life by way of your choices.&quot;  <br />
<br />
A tear ran down your cheek, hearing the fox yipping for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heat has put you into peak condition for fertility. As this will be your first, we congratulate you on being a new mother in the coming [two weeks],&quot; at the last part you lost your grip on the fall and fell forward to your hands.  You were maybe 3 foot 9 now but still losing size and mass.  The fox growing bigger and bigger every moment.<br />
<br />
When you tried to get back up, your spine refused and when you cam crashing back down, your hips cracked and pelvis rearranged so that four feet was only way you would get anywhere anymore. It was then, when your now furry ass became presented that the fox made his move.  Just as you were trying to get to two feet again, he&#39;s on your rear and tugging you back towards his red throbbing member.  This was made worse by the fact that he was starting to overpower you.<br />
<br />
You yelped again, only to watch your face start to stretch forward into the muzzle you were now destined to have.  Nose blackened, tongue hanging out, you shrunk into the folds of your shirt while the fox behind you wasted little time in doing what he came to do. Your tail bent over your back, white fur now covering your row of teats as copper orange fur takes your back,  Then, the fox takes you.<br />
<br />
In another echo you yelp, though this time, it lacks any semblance of humanity. He forces his cock into you, driving out any hope you would leave with any dignity.<br />
<br />
The screen above flickered and audio began to play, &quot;Your change is 95% complete!  Please, accept your fate, as God has willed you more useful as an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
With &#39;accept your fate&#39; in your mind, you feel the fox&#39;s knot starting to swell and you realize that you are well and truly, fucked.<br />
<br />
Your mind hazy, you lay with your new mate as you two are attached.  You feel afraid and nervous, but when you look down at your belly, already starting to swell with a litter- which would number 13-, you decide the vixen wins.<br />
<br />
You and your mate were released into the forest behind the attraction, your friends and family always left to wonder what came of you.</p>
