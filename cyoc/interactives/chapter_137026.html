<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">...donkey?<br />
<br />
Arnold wakes up from her slumber. Apparently, she heard some screaming coming from the room that her master sleeps in. She heard footsteps coming from her room, getting closer and closer to where Arnold saw her last. Then she saw something pop out of the door-frame.<br />
<br />
A grey furred muzzle. &quot;Oh no&quot; Arnold thought. She knew what has happened. She knew what was coming through that door. She told her that this would happen. A donkey left the room and started stumbling towards Arnold, trying so hard to rush at her in anger.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done to me? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!?!&quot; Susan shouted at Arnold, looking at herself. She had fur, thick grey fur all over her body. Her mouth and nose combined and pushed out to create this lighter grey donkey muzzle. Her hands and feet were killing her as they were now hooves. Solid black hooves attached to her fur covered arms and legs, if she still had arms, as her arms were now legs as well. Her ears stretched beyond human length and pointed themselves into donkey ears. Her spine extended passed the usual length, creating a tail that swung on it&#39;s own accord. Her hair almost changed completely. She still had her haircut, but her hair turned from a nice, autumn brown to a jet black with bits of grey on the tips of her hair. Her hair also extended that it almost reached past her back. She snorted in anger and fear.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, I&#39;m sorry but this is what you wished for&quot; Arnold replied, trying to calm her master down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never wanted to be this, I NEVER WISHED FOR THIS AT ALL!&quot; Susan continued to yell, her new tail shaking faster in anger.<br />
<br />
Arnold was sorry, but she did wish for this to happen. Arnold raised her hand to where Susan was last night, as smoke seeped out of her hand. Susan was shocked, scared that something was going to happen to her again, she was already unhappy that she was now a common mule. The smoke vaguely shaped into people, or at least one person. Susan couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing, the cloud shaped finely until it was exactly shaped like her. Arnold&#39;s eyes glowed, projecting an image of Susan onto the thick cloud. The cloud moved like it was Susan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah? So if you are a genie, Arnold...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no&quot; Susan thought. She wasn&#39;t thinking straight that night, she thought it was all an elaborate prank, all for views or whatever they call it nowadays. It wasn&#39;t a prank. She was a genie. An actual genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;...I wish that I looked like an animal&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan gulped in embarrassment. She did this to herself. Her belief in Arnold at that moment cost her her own body. She had to change back, she had to do something. Surely, she could wish to have her own body back, right?<br />
<br />
&quot;Change me back, I wish that I could change back!&quot; Susan demanded.<br />
<br />
Arnold&#39;s eyes stopped glowing, the cloud Susan faded back into her hand, and she looked back at the donkey looking up at her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Master, but the previous wish was unstable. You didn&#39;t mention an exact animal, so it will be a while before I will be able to change you back&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;A while? For how long?&quot; Susan asked, panicking that she could be stuck in this donkey body for longer than she wanted, and she didn&#39;t want to be in the body of a donkey at all. Arnold looked away, she couldn&#39;t tell her how long this was going to take to change her back, her master would freak out!<br />
<br />
&quot;Arnold, TELL ME!&quot; Susan demanded, stomping her hooves on the floor of her apartment, possibly waking up the downstairs neighbours.<br />
<br />
&quot;A few weeks, Master. Maybe even months&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;MONTHS?!?&quot; Susan screamed, her eyes widening in shock and despair. &quot;I&#39;M GOING TO BE STUCK LIKE THIS FOR MAAAAWTHS?!&quot; Susan stopped talking. Did she just bray? Like a donkey? Oh no, it was getting worse for Susan. She already looked like a donkey, she didn&#39;t want to sound like one too. Susan almost fainted, she was going to be like this for months, possibly even several months. She laid down, put her donkey head on the ground, and started to cry. &quot;I&#39;m gonna be like this forever, aren&#39;t I. A stupid donkey. Why did I wish for this? I just wanted my stuff back&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Master, please, it will be okay&quot; Arnold tried to console the broken down Susan, petting her new mane.<br />
<br />
&quot;Speak for yourself&quot; Susan replied &quot;I haven&#39;t got a job anymore, My boyfriend has cheated on me, and now look, I&#39;ve got the body of an ass. Perfectly fitting, don&#39;t you think? A dumbass. That&#39;s what I am&quot;. Tears rolled down her furry face, her tail laid down on the floor, and her ears flattened in sadness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you prefer to be taken to another location, master?&quot;<br />
<br />
The tears stopped running down Susan&#39;s fur, as she felt very offended at the question &quot;WHAT, like a FARM?!&quot; She stood back up and faced Arnold &quot;Was this your whole plan all along? Make me look like a donkey so you could sell me like a common farm animal?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, master. I meant would you to leave this area? This place seems to cause you a lot of trouble, so I thought it would be nice to move the inside of this place into a different outside&quot; Arnold tried to explain to Susan.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am in no position to move house, you... you... you thing! How could I move house? I can&#39;t even grab things with thes-Oof&quot; Susan tried to say, until she was cut off by trying to lift her front hooves and ended up slamming into the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;You would not move house, everything around you would stay the same. The inside will move into another area, creating an outside that looks different&quot; Arnold explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait&quot; Susan said, standing back up in her four legs, trying to get her bearings &quot;You mean this room will be the same, it will just be in another house?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Correct, master!&quot;<br />
<br />
Susan had a headache, but she couldn&#39;t deal with it now, she had to escape before anyone saw her like this. &quot;Sure, whatever, I wish for that&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you wish, Master!&quot;<br />
<br />
The windows outside went brighter and brighter, just like the transformation that happened before to Susan. Ribbons of light surrounded the room, like a spider capturing a fly, wrapping the room in it&#39;s web. The light became brighter and brighter, causing Susan to tightly close her eyes, as it surrounded the room and everything inside it. Susan opened her eyes again. The brightness stopped. The room was the same. Exactly the same. Susan was going to doubt Arnold, but she remembered that the last time that she doubted her, she changed into this stubborn mule body. Susan looked outside. There wasn&#39;t a grey apartment block covering the city skyline anymore, in fact, there wasn&#39;t a city in the background anymore. It was green, really green. Trees surrounded the area in the distance. The sky was a bright blue, without a cloud in the sky. She was right. The room moved, but the building didn&#39;t. They were somewhere beautiful, away from all her problems in city. There was no fast food place where she used to work, where people put the blame on her several times. There was no ex-boyfriend, cheating on some girl that will be treated the exact same way that she was treated. Nothing like that at all. All she needed was now away from the city. Well, nearly anything. In the city, she at least had fingers, thumbs, toes, feet, hands, a human body. Now she was stuck like this, in the body of a female donkey.<br />
<br />
She had to know what was outside this door. <br />
<br />
&quot;I hope I did well, master, I hope the new location is a good choice&quot; Arnold said, hoping that the location was perfect for her master. Arnold opened the door without going near it. Susan looked outside, the smell was brilliant. It was like freshly cut grass, hinted with lemon, all clean and nice. And then she turned the corner to see what else was there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Arnold&quot; Susan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, master?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re on a farm, aren&#39;t we?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yes, master&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Arnold, we are going to have a long, long talk...&quot;</p>
