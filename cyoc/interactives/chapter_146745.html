<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dave remained stiff under the care of Kyle&#39;s calloused hands. His friend (his only friend after Jayden&#39;s betrayal...) had been fascinated ever since Hugo had offered Dave on a silver platter. The rubbing felt nice, almost like being embraced by a lover, melting under the warmth of another&#39;s skin, but... <br />
<br />
&quot;So that&#39;s where you disappeared to,&quot; Kyle said to himself, amused. &quot;Dude, there was no need to skip classes for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Seriously?&quot; Dave asked, perking in Kyle&#39;s grip. &quot;You don&#39;t think being reduced to a talking cock warrants a few days off to accept what changed in my life?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle laughed and rubbed his thumb over Dave&#39;s slit, smattering precum all over Dave&#39;s dickhead. &quot;Ah! As if, the dean, Bruce Bullheart, got turned into his own dick during the finals. And you know what he did?&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s breath hitched up. &quot;C-cum all over the place?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle paused his stroking, taking in the image of the dean&#39;s mammoth cock bursting with cum. The idea alone made his body hotter, and his pants tighter. He made sure the shutters were closed before he leaned back in his chair and unzipped his pants. Then, with a cocky grin, he pulled out his cock. Twitching against the air. Dave, despite being only a dick, appeared suddenly very invested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nope,&quot; he popped out the word. &quot;That strange guy, Hugo, got him a drone or something, and Bruce started proctoring the exam like normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave snorted. Precum dripped off his slit. &quot;You mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kyle said with a smirk. &quot;We had the fuckstick of a pornstar hovering above our heads throughout the exam. You&#39;re lucky you didn&#39;t have to take it. Hell, I think half the guys that cheated just couldn&#39;t help looking over their shoulders to keep an eye on Bruce&#39;s monster cock. I know I almost did.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dave tried to imagine it. Tried to think of himself as a man again, writing on a sheet of paper at a desk, and just turning his head to see a magnificent penis floating just levels with his mouth... He would have licked his lips, opened his mouth... But the image faded almost immediately, replaced with himself as a dick, cowering before a cock much bigger than himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck,&quot; he breathed out. &quot;Now I&#39;m angry I missed it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle chuckled and pushed Dave against his own cock. Slow and easy, he grinded against his friend, biting on his bottom lips. &quot;Y-yeah, sooo, you... you can see. No excuses for not...&quot; He squirted a few globs of pre over Dave. &quot;For not telling me and the rest of the guys about your... your new condition... as a, oh fuck, as a prime dickhead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s... That&#39;s not the reason,&quot; Dave said. &quot;I was too angry... Jayden... Jayden betrayed my trust.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kyle rolled his hips, head lolling back as his body flooded with need. &quot;W-what did he do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Swore...&quot; the words barely came out when his slit was already filling with cum &quot;swore, blub, swore that we&#39;d get dicked together. As best friends and fuck buddies. Didn&#39;t. Waited... all... all alone...&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle&#39;s hand jerked frantically, drowning out Dave&#39;s words under rhythmic slaps of wet flesh. Their balls were clenching, quivering. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fuuuuuuuck!&quot; Kyle shouted, cum erupting from his cock and covering his stomach and Dave.<br />
<br />
Dave&#39;s own orgasm had finished coating himself and Kyle&#39;s cock with white, a dripping hot sticky mess. For a moment, they lied down together, Dave softening on top of Kyle, shrinking back to his normal state. Kyle almost drifted to sleep, mind overtaken by satisfaction, but Dave&#39;s words echoed back in his mind. He never thought Jayden would be that kind of asshole. <br />
<br />
Gently, Kyle stroked Dave&#39;s sleeping form, running along the length of his shaft. <br />
<br />
First, he needed to talk with Hugo.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Jayden got out of his car with an hour to spare before one of his final presentations. He was getting pretty jittery. He&#39;d miss almost a week of school, coming down with a illness that had left him bedridden most of the time. He was good now, but he&#39;d missed one final exam already, and he didn&#39;t want to have to retake all of them. At least, he had a doctor&#39;s paper to justify everything with the dean. As soon as he was done with the oral presentation, he would find Mister Bullheart and explain the whole thing. <br />
<br />
Running into the campus&#39; building, he saw Kyle waving him over into the computer labs. Perfect. They&#39;d be able to get one last practice run before they had to show things to the jury of teachers. Bruce was always sucha hardass, it wouldn&#39;t hurt to be extra prepared. <br />
<br />
Kyle welcomed him into the computer lab with a friendly grin. &quot;Jayden! Finally back on your feet, huh? And just in time for our presentation too!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jayden said, apologetic. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry you and Dave had to finish the project on your own. I mean, it was almost done, but I feel terrible for not being there to help you two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle, for some reason, looked a little annoyed. &quot;Well, it would have been hard for Dave to complete it, the way he was.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jayden put down his backpack, then the words registered. &quot;Wait, is he okay? Anything happened to him?&quot; When had he last seen him again? The party? Honestly, he&#39;d gotten so drunk he didn&#39;t even remember leaving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, he was a little mad, but he&#39;s been feeling a lot better recently,&quot; Kyle replied mildly. &quot;Anyway, take out your material, we&#39;ll set up the presentation.&quot;<br />
<br />
They worked in silence, something awkward between them preventing Jayden from asking where Dave was. God, things had gone wrong during the week he&#39;d lost. He could already tell it would be an uphill battle to get things back to normal. Still, after maybe ten minutes or so of setting up, they were ready to practice. <br />
<br />
&quot;Done,&quot; Jayden declared. &quot;We&#39;re good to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, everything&#39;s perfect,&quot; Kyle agreed, glaring. <br />
<br />
Before Jayden could ask, Kyle brought out a camera and a flash of light blinded Jayden. All of a sudden, Jayden felt weightless, paralyzed as he fell, naked. He hit something soft, which left him dizzy, but not enough to miss the giant furnitures all around him. And the towering figure of Kyle, still glaring with that camera in hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;That,&quot; Kyle said, suddenly cold and angry, &quot;was for backing out of your deal with Dave.&quot;<br />
<br />
That&#39;s when Kyle pulled out a dick out of his pocket, a very familiar dick indeed. From his position on the ground, Jayden could only see the red, bulging dickhead, and he suddenly remembered in flashes the frat party they&#39;d gone to together. They had been playing poker, and some dude had brought a camera and... <br />
<br />
... turned Danny into his own dick... <br />
<br />
... turned Bryan, after he&#39;d lost a bet...<br />
<br />
Shit! He&#39;d bet and got Dave to get turned instead! <br />
<br />
Now, Kyle had transformed him!<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you&#39;d leave me hanging for more than a week, bro!&quot; Dave&#39;s voice came out of the angry cock at screaming levels. &quot;You swore we&#39;d do this together and I waited all alone for days. Not cool, Jayden!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Jayden thought, hyperventilating. &quot;No, that&#39;s not what happened! Dave agreed to take my penalty at poker if I gave him some cash! Kyle, come on, please, you can&#39;t dick me! Dave was already drunk then. Change me back to normal!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle rolled his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;d deny it, Jayden. Too bad cocks can&#39;t talk, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
His giant hand loomed over Jayden&#39;s panicking, unmoving penis. The light in the room dimmed behind that wall of flesh and Jayden wanted to sob in panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; rumbled Kyle&#39;s stern voice, &quot;what will we do with you traitor?&quot;</p>
