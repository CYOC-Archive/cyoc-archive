<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Tanner sat happily in Derrick&#39;s lap, all thoughts about his life as a human nearly erased by his former brother, now owner. They watched tv for half an hour when the doorbell chimed.<br />
&quot;Have you invited someone, Tanner?&quot; Derrick asked. Tanner looked confused up at him and squeaked, not knowing what he meant. Derrick stood up with Tanner grabbed in his left hand and got to the door with his squeaking toy. At the door were two friends of Tanner. Phil was a classmate of him and a good friend for years, while Jeremy was his best friend since their early childhood as he was their neighbor.<br />
Both looked confused at Derrick, having never seen him here before. &quot;Uh, hello&quot; started Jeremy: &quot;We were looking for Tanner. Are you a friend of him?&quot;  While Tanner squeaked confused, not remembering them, Derrick answered: &quot;Yes, we are friends. He is in the bathroom, do you want to come in? I´m sure you can wait inside.&quot;<br />
After he let them sit waiting on the couch he went upstairs to tell Tanner as he said, but headed straight into Tanner&#39;s former room to get to the chronivac. As he didn´t need three human action figures he quickly edited the profiles of his guests to his liking, put in three minutes of waiting time and hit save before returning back downstairs to his soon to be toys.<br />
Tanner had been with him, still confused but happily watching his owner at the chronivac, not that he could read what Derrick typed in. When Derrick had changed him he had erased such useless skills from his toy. What Derrick had failed to notice was that he had no back-up-files for Tanner, and had created neither for Jeremy and Phil as well. If he planned to change them back it would be much work for him, and that wouldn´t replace their knowledge or memories then.<br />
<br />
Back down with Tanner again in his left hand he stood between Tanner&#39;s friends and the tv facing them. &quot;Who are you, by the way?&quot; Jeremy asked Derrick as he noticed they hadn´t asked him. &quot;I´m Tanner&#39;s brother Derrick but he made me his age before.&quot; Derrick replied. They looked at him before laughing. &quot;That was a good one. You and being that pipsqueak.&quot; Phil said in between the laughing. Derrick smiled evilly at them, ignoring the comment, as Phil would get his answer soon. &quot;So, where is Tanner then? It would be really long for a bathroom break by now.&quot; Jeremy realized, already calmer than Phil. Tanner squeaked when Derrick showed him to them. &quot;He is here.&quot; he said simply. Before they could reply the three minute were over and their changes started, shocking them even more than the Tanner toy if Derrick was to be believed.<br />
Like Tanner&#39;s before them their clothes were the first thing as they vanished into nothing, leaving Phil and Jeremy naked. They both yelped surprised, and while they weren´t paying attention Jeremy&#39;s body hair was sucked in, together with both boys nipples. Their belly buttons filled out, leaving Jeremy&#39;s chest a smooth surface, while Phil still had hairs on it. Both bodies gained a sheen of plastic instead of flesh on their hardening skin. Another yelp came from them when in a swift motion their dicks and balls were sucked into their bodies, giving them a small bulge but nothing more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is happening?&quot; Jeremy asked loudly. They both had jumped up, standing in front of the couch and looked at the smirking Derrick, who had placed Tanner on the table between them, watching their changes. &quot;You wanted to Tanner, and as he is an action figure now you must be too to play with him.&quot; Derrick replied, laughing at their shocked faces.<br />
Phil dropped forward and down on all fours before both were frozen for a couple of seconds. With some creaking sounds from their newly formed ball joints they regained their movement, but Phil couldn´t stand up again. Both wanted to scream at Derrick to stop this, but Jeremy just squeaked like Tanner did while Phil also squeaked, but it sounded like a mix of a squeak and a bark. &quot;Oh, stop complaining. You will both be living action figures, special ones like Tanner. But as I didn´t want three boys I now get just two boys and their dog. Don´t worry, you will like it. And you won´t need to speak anymore, you are just toys after all.&quot;<br />
Phil felt itchy all over his plastic skin as his body hair got more and soon he was completely covered by it, as it resembled brown fur. Said fur then melted together again, forming a solid surface of plastic fur all over his skin. Jeremy&#39;s hair also turned into a solid mass of plastic on his head. Before they even tried to move more they felt some vertigo as they started shrinking smaller. Phil also had his body reformed while shrinking, as his hands and feet became paws complete with small claws. He also got a muzzle and a tail growing out. Jeremy stopped shrinking at six inches tall, the same size as Tanner, while Phil got down to four inches in length and three inches in height. Doll clothes appeared on Jeremy&#39;s body while Phil only got a collar with a rubber leach clipped in it, earning a more confused sounding squeak form both of them, as their minds already started to fog up.<br />
<br />
“Now we can continue watching tv, right boys?” Derrick said, grinning at his newest additions.<br />
“What? Turn us back! We´re humans, not toys ... master. Master? What … Stop this, I´m not your stupid toy dog, even if I´m well made. Nooo … I´m not a toy … I´m hum… I´m … Phil … Master Derrick&#39;s loyal dog toy figure.” were Phil&#39;s last thoughts as he was lost in the changes, now nothing more but a toy dog figure, even lower than Tanner and Jeremy.<br />
Jeremy wasn´t fairing any better than Phil. “Stop toying with us... We aren´t your toys... I think... We´re humans... I´m your neighbor … I´m no stupid toy... I´m a lifelike model action figure... N... No, stop, I´m … Jeremy... I´m one of Derrick&#39;s happy living toys.” And with that Jeremy the human also vanished from the world, as he stood there blinking.<br />
Seeing their eyes lose their light Derrick smiled. The physical change hadn´t taken more than a minute, with the mind adjusting had taken another. Derrick sat down o the couch and he took all of his toys, placing Tanner on his left leg, Jeremy on the right one and Phil in between them, with his leach placed loosely in Jeremy&#39;s hand. Each of them squeaked as Derrick lifted them up, and after sitting down watched tv with him, even if they didn´t understand it much.</p>
