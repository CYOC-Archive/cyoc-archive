<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The floor loudly groaned under his 750 pound mass, but it somehow managed to stay intact. Though he did bust a couple of floor boards. <br />
<br />
For the first time, he began to really feel helpless and hopeless. He wanted to cry, but donkeys don&#39;t cry. All he can do, is stand there and feel sorry for himself while softly braying in and out. Eeeerrrrrggggghhhh hhhhhhhaaaawww eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaww eeerrrrrggghhh hhhaaaaeww, with his chest heaving as he sucked air into his oversized donkey lungs.<br />
<br />
He looks back over to the chronivac to see how much time he has left, but the screen is completely blurry. He tried wiping his eyes with his phantom right hand. But of course, he can&#39;t. He has legs and hooves, instead of arms, hands, and fingers.<br />
<br />
Hooves clopping across the wood floor of his bed room, he wandered back over to his chronivac to see if he can get a better look at the readout. It felt like he&#39;s been like this for an entire day already. But when he looked, he still had 23 hours, 10 minutes left. <br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, that only took 20 minutes to try to open the door!?&quot; was his first thought. <br />
<br />
But then, his second thought was &quot;ONLY 20 minutes to open a simple door!? &#39;ONLY&#39;&quot;!? HHHHHAAAAWWWW he blew out his frustration for about what must have been the millionth time.<br />
<br />
He could still smell that horrid fishy musk that came from his own body. That&#39;s when he noticed his gigantic dick was hard again! He wasn&#39;t paying a lot of attention, but his mounting frustrations in trying and failing to open a simple door was causing his donkey balls to churn overtime. And his penis was steadily growing. Now, with the smell of his own scent still strong in his nose, it began to slide out of his donkey body&#39;s sheath. <br />
<br />
Without thinking, he went to touch himself with his left hand like he did before. And like before, all he really managed to do was brush the left side of his dick with his hoof. &quot;Oh God, not this again,&quot; he thought. <br />
<br />
He decided to try to ignore it this time. Little did he know, his fat middle-aged donkey body&#39;s hormones are much more powerful than what a 13 year old boy could handle. But ignore it, he did. For the time being. <br />
<br />
He still wanted out of his room. He didn&#39;t want to be trapped in there any longer. So pushing his sorrow, frustration, and horniness to the back of his mind, he tried the door again. This time, he would start from just left of the door, with his body as far back he he could get it while stretching his neck as far forward as possible. That way, his body will be out of the way, meaning he would have room to swing the door towards him with his head. And he&#39;d be at the right angle to swing it all the way open. <br />
<br />
He had to squint his left eye shut, and focus on his right eye to see the knob as well as he could. He didn&#39;t want to mess around with trying to find it like he did before. And it worked! Good! He was able to grab the doorknob with his teeth on his first try. He was able to turn the knob, then gently pull the door open, swinging it as wide as possible towards him. <br />
<br />
Success! He managed to FINALLY open his bedroom door, and he could see out into the Hall! He felt like having a small celebration. But the idea of how much of a victory such a mundane little task had become, struck in his mind. &quot;eeeerrggghhh hhhaawwww!&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind. The door is open now! Time to get to the bathroom and try to use the shower.&quot; <br />
<br />
And so, he proceeded forward through his doorway. But then he stopped. He was stuck! He had the body of a 750 lb beast of burden, badly overweight. His sides stuck out in his obesity. He couldn&#39;t make it through his doorway! He tried putting his right front leg through first, to see if he could squeeze through. But it was no use! He tried every which way he could.<br />
<br />
Mounting frustration again, it was the first time he wondered why the chronivac made him so large in the first place! In fact, he didn&#39;t realize just how large his new body really was! He didn&#39;t realize he was fat. He wasn&#39;t fat as a boy. In fact, he was skinny and scrawny; short for his age even. He never realized how truly immense he was now!<br />
<br />
After spending all that time and effort at opening the stupid door, he never thought fitting through would even be a thing! He just took it for granted, like he took having human hands and human nimbleness for granted. <br />
<br />
He did try one more time. He managed to slip his right shoulder through. He used his right front leg to paw his way forward as much as possible. Contorting his left side as much as he could and bringing his left leg forward as much as possible, he managed to slip his left shoulder through. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhaawwww,&quot; he breathed trying to say &quot;ok,&quot; forgetting once again that he can&#39;t talk. How embarrassing! How frustrating! He wanted to say at least one word for once! That thought, and the thought of his obese, overgrown jackass body, his inability to manipulate his mouth and vocal cords properly and the smell still emanating from him, his body&#39;s hormones started going into overdrive. Again. His penis was becoming engorge, as it started sticking straight out like an accusatory finger when he looked down between his legs at it. Just a very large, black blob, it looked like to him.<br />
<br />
He tried getting the rest of the way through the doorway, but his side and rump were much too much large for the task. It was also even less nimble than his front end. <br />
<br />
Digging in, he decided he needs to try to back up. But now there&#39;s yet another problem:<br />
<br />
Equine and ungulate front legs are desiged to move forward. Not back. There is very limited mobility for the front legs to move backwards. He tried lowering his left shoulder and squeezing his left leg through like he did with his right leg to get to this point. But alas, his sides stuck out way wider than his neck, and his front legs cannot move backwards as easily as they could move forward. <br />
<br />
Huffing and blowing, he continues to try to get out of the doorway one way or the other. His inability to move in either direction, his inability to spread his fingers and grasp onto something; his inability utter even a single word, and his growing anxiety and claustrophobia with his uncontrollable, raging donkey-level hormones, made his penis as stiff as a flag pole and opened wide his meatus as his donkey sperm started raging forward. <br />
<br />
&quot;HHHHHHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!! EEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH HHHHHHHHHAAAAAAAWWWW!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Once again, fireworks exploded in his mind and throughout his body like a tremendous thunderclap. All he saw, was an explosion of colors in his mind&#39;s eye. And his penis pumped. And it pumped. And it pumped some more. A seemingly never-ending stream of ejaculate. Jeff was frozen solid in his doorway, totally unable to think, and involuntarily braying with his huge teeth sticking out. This time was even more powerful than the first. So much so, that he began to black out. <br />
<br />
As it slowly, ever too slowly, began to subside, he felt a tremendous exhaustion come over him. It was impossible to keep his eyes open any longer, and so, he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
