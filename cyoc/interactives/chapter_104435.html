<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The giant spider, upon locating each and every one of Reton&#39;s hiding crew, eagerly injected them with digestive fluids and hung them on its newly fashioned web.  After all the humans were disposed of, it turned towards the largest of its victims:  the wolfen metabeast.  The spider was quite satisfied with its haul, knowing that the wolfen alone would make for a fine meal.  The spider clambered over to where the wolfen&#39;s body lay, a large mass upon the cold street.  However, as the spider reached out towards the wolfen, it suddenly paused.  Although its expression remained inscrutable, something akin to recognition flickered through its eight eyes.<br />
<br />
Having suffered through similar experiences twice already, Merse&#39;s consciousness huddled in a dark corner of her soul, terrified at what new horrors might await her.  She didn&#39;t even attempt to fight to return to the light of full awareness, somehow aware of two points of reflected gleam in the darkness beyond, causing her to shudder with fear.  However, as the two glowing orbs neared the realm of her awareness, something strange occurred.  Unlike the reptilian eyes, which still slithered through the dark, and the spider, which now took center stage, the gleams made no attempt to attack her consciousness and assert superiority.  Rather, they seemed more concerned with what was going on in the outside world, and much to her surprise, burst upon the spider and drove it back into the darkness.  Only then could Merse recognize the form which now stood in the light of her awareness.<br />
<br />
To an observer, it may have seemed like the spider had paused as might a cat with a mouse, contemplating what to do with its prey.  However, what happened next would have seemed beyond the realm of imagination.  The spider&#39;s eight legs began to draw inward, it&#39;s body shrinking and reshaping itself.  Nevertheless, what emerged was not a female human.  Rather, fur sprouted forth, then a tail, four clawed limbs, and finally a muzzled face.  A few moments later, standing in the deserted street, was an exact living duplicate of the wolfen corpse that lay at its feet.  It reached out, retrieving something from the body, then quickly and stealthily made its way out of Dregsbale.<br />
<br />
**********<br />
<br />
Kayl was not sure what had happened.  A few days ago, he had left his pack, desperate to hunt, and ventured further out than usual.  However, he soon found himself the victim of a gang of slavers who, ecstatic at the prize they had obtained, wasted no time in placing a subjugation collar on him.  What followed were days of the agony of being trapped within his own body, unable to resist even the most abhorrent orders.  When he was taken to Dregsbale and sold to a thug named Reton, he despaired of ever seeing his home again.  When told to attack a female rogue, he was almost a disinterested observer, his body moving on its own.  That is, until he got the shock of his life.<br />
<br />
Dying did not surprise him.  Rather, it was the manner of his death.  While the criminals pinning down the female rogue probably did not see nor understand what happened next, Kayl&#39;s wolfen senses caught it all, even though he could not make sense of it.  Where one moment stood a woman covered in ropes, the next lay scraps of clothing as a giant spider burst forth, launching its tormentors in all directions and sinking its venemous fangs into Kayl&#39;s shoulder.  As he felt his life slipping away, Kayl&#39;s only regret was not being able to return to his pack, to protect it from the dangers it faced.  He readied himself to face the souls of his ancestors.<br />
<br />
However, Kayl did not find himself facing the wolfen gods, or the stern glares of his forefathers.  Rather, he seemed to be in a dark place.  Looking about warily, he noted the female rogue also in the darkness, although she appeared terrified, and something else, something reptilian slinking through the shadows.  He also saw illuminated the spider which had killed him.  Knowing he was dead, at first Kayl did not feel any anger or hatred for the spider, but simply observed it.  Nevertheless, as his consciousness relaxed, Kayl became aware that he could sense the world around him ever so slightly.  The spider had finished binding most of its prey, and was moving toward the last corpse:  his.<br />
<br />
Initially, Kayl did not bother taking any action.  However, something caught his attention:  a inconspicuous necklace which he had worn for years.  Suddenly, Kayl was hit with a whirl of emotions:  regret at losing his pack, determination to see his home again, and an intense revulsion at the thought of losing that necklace.  Without considering the whys or wherefores, Kayl launched himself at the illuminated spider in a mad attack.<br />
<br />
When Kayl came to himself, he was standing in the street looking down at his dead body.  Although he knew the body he was currently in was not really his own, he wasn&#39;t too concerned with finding an explanation, as it seemed an exact copy of his old body.  Whatever the reason for his new life, he had an opportunity to put to rest his regrets, and he wasn&#39;t going to waste the chance.  Reaching out to remove the necklace from his corpse, Kayl hurriedly made his way out of Dregsbale.<br />
<br />
Merse watched in awe as the spider faded into a wolfen.  Although she was too wary to approach it, she sensed the consciousness of the wolfen was somehow different from that of the spider or the hydra.  Unlike the sheer instinct of the latter, the former had memories, and emotions, and a palpable determination.  While the spider had reliquished her body after a few hours the last time it had taken over, Merse had no idea if or when her body would be her own again this time.  Watching the wolfen exit Dregsbale, Merse began to realize that she might have a longer wait than she thought.</p>
