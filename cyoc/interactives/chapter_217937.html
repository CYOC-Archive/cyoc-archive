<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill glared at Gloria and squeezed the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone tight in his fist, unaware that the magical artifact had been damaged from it&#39;s recent airborne journey down the hall. It hadn&#39;t been enough to simply make them all old, and turn Tom into Bill&#39;s wife, and now his girlfriend, no no, Gloria had altered his family entirely, making him no longer born to Martha and Greg Strasserman and had erased his little sister from existence entirely! And had warped the daughter that he and Tammy had been given in the future into his older sister! And despite the three teens not realizing it, BIll himself had gone a subtle shift in appearance, his genetics changing to fit that of his new parents. Bill looked over at Tom...Tammy, the cute, geeky blonde currently caught in a loop of examining her newer, younger body and looking at Bill in worry and concern. Only a few minutes ago the curvy, short girl had been the best male athlete in Shermer, but thanks to Gloria was now twisted far and away, not just physically but mentally, from his original form. All because Gloria couldn&#39;t stop meddling with people&#39;s lives.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is all your fault!&quot; Bill hissed, pointing a finger in Gloria&#39;s face as he raised his hand holding the strange wishing Stone high in the air.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-I&#39;m Sorry!&quot; The dark haired cheerleader cried out, large, watery eyes flicked between the enraged teen&#39;s face and the sickly off-green light in his hand, the tell-tale sign that the Stone was ready to grant a wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s too late for apologies! All you do is hurt people Gloria! You&#39;re just as bad as Rob Bolstrum or Big Jon! I WISH YOU COULD NEVER HURT ANYONE AGAIN!&quot; Bill roared, lowering his glowing fist and shoving it in Gloria&#39;s face right as the light pulsed.<br />
<br />
&quot;NO!&quot; Gloria screamed at the top of her voice, and then everything went green.<br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to all the teens gathered in the upstairs hallway of the new Strasserman household, a red-headed giant was watching them from down below, hateful eyes glaring upwards at them as the trespasser, Rob Bolstrum, wondered just what the hell was going on. The disgraced bully was there to try to convince Bill to help him take down Big Jon, but he hadn&#39;t expected Bill&#39;s mousy little girlfriend or the queen bitch of Shermer High to be there! Or Bill&#39;s hot sister Willow. He&#39;d thought about bailing, but then the fight between Gloria and Bill, the strange other-worldly light had captured his attention.<br />
<br />
But unknown to everyone in Bill&#39;s house, from the three time-traveling teens to the bully and the daughter out of time in the garage, Bill&#39;s wish was not going to be granted as he wanted, and the damage done to the Stone lashed out at all of them as their bodies began to change. And then as quickly as it had begun, the changes were over.<br />
<br />
As the world returned, there was only darkness and heat, and the rhythmic thumping of something behind him told Bill that his wish had gone very, very wrong.<br />
__<br />
<br />
Willow busied herself at the kitchen counter, mature hands gliding over four pieces of bread as a knife spread a creamy application of golden-brown peanut butter upon the exposed sides of two of the slices before placing their companions on top of them, and then using the sharp blade to cut both of the new sandwiches in half, creating four small rectangles. The curvy, curly haired woman dropped the knife into the sink as she minced across the kitchen and retrieved the plastic wrap from one of the higher shelves and returned to the counter, quickly tearing off several pieces and expertly wrapping the small sandwiches up securely. With that chore done she took the small delectibles and placed them within the nearby brown paper bag, along with a small bag of grapes and a Capri Sun juice pouch.<br />
<br />
&quot;There we are...&quot; Willow said quietly to herself, glancing up at the kitchen clock that now read &quot;7:00AM&quot;. She smiled as she rolled the top of the bag down until it was reduced to half of it&#39;s original size.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still plenty of time. Way to go Wills! You&#39;re on it this morning!&quot; The big-bottomed woman allowed herself a little victory dance in the kitchen before swooping the brown paper bag off the counter. She moved out of the kitchen and into the foyer of the large house, placing the brown lunch bag next to a pink backpack that had a cartoon pony emblazoned upon it, and in one fluid movement moved to and up the stairs. She passed by the wall of family photos that where hung there, the numerous pictures of her and her parents, of her husband Rob (who was already at work for the day), the two of them on vacation, the look of happiness on both their faces, and of course, the swarm of photos as a small child appeared in their arms.<br />
<br />
She slowed her pace however as she came to the upper floor of her home, creeping out onto the second story landing and making her way quietly down the hall to a door that was covered in a mess of multi-colored streamers. Willow&#39;s hand softly grasped the door knob and gave it a slow, quiet turn, the latch releasing and the door sliding open just as quietly as the adult woman prepared for one of her favorite parts of the day.<br />
<br />
The door swung upon and there, nestled in a mountain of covers, was her precious daughter, Tammy, the five year old&#39;s eyes still softly shut as she lay snuggled in her bed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh, my baby!&#39; Willow thought, her heart almost exploding with motherly love as she padded across the toy-covered carpet. She lowered her substantial rear to the bed and brushed at the thick, burgundy locks that covered her daughter&#39;s face, and the small child shifted in her sleep, digging deeper under the covers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tammy...&quot; Willow whispered softly, giving her daughter&#39;s face another soft stroke, &quot;It&#39;s time to go to school!&quot;<br />
<br />
The child grunted and slid almost entirely under the covers, and Willow fought back the urge to laugh at how cute it looked. Instead she simply stood and slowly peeled back the covers as if she was peeling an orange. As the covers slipped away Willow watched as her daughter curled into a small ball of Paw Patrol pajamas and two tiny bare feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon baby, time to get up!&quot; Willow said in a singsong voice as she sat back down on the bed, placing a hand on Tammy&#39;s back. After a moment her daughter began to truly stir, the small body unfolding from the tight ball as tiny limbs stretched out, a squeak of a yaw escaping from a between tiny, chubby cheeks. From out of the center of the ball two small toys tumbled out of her embrace and onto the bed; a traditional plushy rag doll that was looking a little worn from years of use, and Tammy&#39;s newest toy, a posable plastic doll.<br />
<br />
&quot;There you are, booger!&quot; Willow said with a laugh, plucking the toys off the mattress and setting them on the small beside table, where they slumped against each other, their warm surfaces cooling as Tammy&#39;s body heat faded away into the morning air. But Willow didn&#39;t pay any mind to her daughter&#39;s favorite, (and oldest) toys as she scooped the small wiggling child up from the bed and blew a big raspberry on her belly, resulting in a loud squeal of delight from the five year old in her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s go get you ready&quot; Willow said, and without a second look to the bear and doll, carried her daughter out of the bedroom and towards the upstairs bathroom to get her ready for the day.<br />
<br />
&#39;Oh god. OH GOD!&#39; Gloria screamed in silence as she found herself unable to move, her eyes locked straight ahead as her new body failed to respond to her commands. Her cotton filled head had flopped at just the right angle for her to see her new body in the closet mirror; she was small, so very small, and her hair, if it could still be called that, was a mop head of black yarn that was stitched into her over-sized, flesh colored felt head that hung down past where her ears should have and ending at the nape of her new neck. Her eyes were two bright green buttons and her mouth was a thin line of pink colored stitching curing upwards in a smile that Gloria definitely was NOT feeling, and her plushy neck disappeared down into a oblong tube shaped body that was clothed in a large black and white polka dotted dress. Curved, digit-less limbs poked out of the obnoxious fabric, two arms she couldn&#39;t move and two legs that didn&#39;t support her new, almost weightless, body.<br />
<br />
She COULDN&#39;T be a doll! She was Gloria Vanapolous! The queen of Shermer High! SHE WAS A PERSON NOT A TOY!<br />
<br />
&#39;MOMMY!&#39; She wailed in absolute terror.<br />
<br />
&#39;What...What happened!?&#39; Bill wondered as he underwent the same realization that he couldn&#39;t move. His eyes looked straight ahead in the closet mirror as he took in his new form. He looked like Gloria! Or rather, a Barbie doll version of her! He was wearing the exact same clothes as she&#39;d been wearing before he made the wish, and his face was painted up to look like a much more friendly and happy version of the dark haired bitch that had ruined everyone lives this morning!<br />
<br />
&#39;You have GOT to be fucking kidding me!&quot; Bill swore in the lonely expanse of his own mind as he struggled to figure out what had gone wrong.<br />
<br />
And unseen by both newly produced toys, the Ahn&#39;Ger Stone slid deeper beneath the pillows of Tammy&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
Option 1: Bill and Gloria are now toys belonging to Tammy Bolstrum, the new daughter of Willow Bolstrum and Rob Bolstrum, who had been transformed by the damaged Stone as well. Unable to move, unable to speak, little more than a few pieces of fabric and plastic, they are vulnerable to the world and completely incapable of changing back on their own. Tammy and Willow return after a few minutes, and a glimmer of hope emerges as the little girl begins searching for the Stone.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Bill and Gloria live the life of toys as no one else seems to remember the previous reality. then one day, perhaps because of the broken magic of the Stone or perhaps just Tammy&#39;s childlike belief that her toys are &#39;real&#39;, Bill and Gloria find that if they focus enough, they can move and even speak to each other!</p>
