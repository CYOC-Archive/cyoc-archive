<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Maybe being an adult is cool. I liked to try it.&quot;, Jeff think. &quot;Help me with this, please.&quot;, Jeff said as he handed the device to the new adult. &quot;Okay.&quot; Dean holds the device, and then pointed the device at Jeff. <br />
<br />
As he standing infront of Dean, the device scanned him from top to the bottom. The screen then shows a data being processed, gathering all information that maybe suited for bodily transformation. &quot;Uh, how old do you want to set?&quot;, Dean asks as he switch his sight from Jeff to the screen. &quot;As old as you are now, I think... maybe.&quot;, Jeff said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Set up the age to 25 then.&quot; Dean inputs the parameter on the Age options. The screen then shows that the process is ready to be executed. He just need to click on the start button, and voila, new Jeff pops up. Jeff seems a bit uneasy for what&#39;s about to come. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, are you scared?&quot;, Dean asked. &quot;A little. I just wondering how would I looked like if I&#39;m older like you.&quot;, Jeff said, shy. &quot;No need to be afraid. It just two of us here. Nothing will judge of how your appearance will become. I swear I won&#39;t. I promised!&quot;, Dean reassuring his best friend. &quot;Okay, if you say so.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff then start stripping all of his clothes, leaving him exposed with no single fabric covering his body. Dean can&#39;t help but to look at him. Jeff is not so bad himself. For a 16 year old like him, his features is fair for his age. Commonly average high school boy, Jeff is actually a bit of smart and bright mind, even though he is not stands out on outside activities. <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you looking at?&quot;, Jeff asks. Dean nonchalantly checking Jeff&#39;s out. &quot;Nothing....&quot;, He lied. &quot;It is obvious you&#39;ve been staring at my junk, don&#39;t lie. I know, I know. I admit I&#39;m a bit jealous of yours at this point.&quot;, Jeff side eyeing the young adult. &quot;Hahaha. It&#39;s okay, it will changed soon enough.&quot;, Dean smirking at the screen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ready?&quot;, Dean&#39;s thumb is hovering above the start button. &quot;Ready. Start.&quot;, Jeff confirms. Dean push the start button while pointing the device at Jeff. It started to glowing white lights at Jeff. As it stopped glowing, Jeff then feels his bone cracking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Auch...&quot;. Jeff groaned. Dean watched as Jeff grown taller. His torso seems to stretched, his lower bones is growing one inches. As he grown, his muscles started to appear, with his shoulder and back widened to accomodate his growth. His hips also larger at the blink of an eye. <br />
<br />
The transformation are still going, now it affecting Jeff&#39;s member. It enlarges and more girthier, also his balls is awesomely a bit larger. &quot;Dude, look at your dick. It&#39;s massive.&quot;, Dean said. Jeff reachs with his palm to cover his new genitals, but it&#39;s useless as his hands, altogether with his both arms now sporting new muscles. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, it really do numbers on you, dude. Your growth is rapidly activating all your potentials. Just look at that, are you growing abs there?&quot;, Dean says as he pointing his direction at Jeff&#39;s abdoment. And yes, a six packs of bread starting to appear. His chest is a bit broader, his pecs is a bit defined. <br />
<br />
His Adam&#39;s Apple is more prominent, while  his chin and lip began to change, together with his new jaw. A few thin hair blooms on his arms and legs, spreading on his skin. It covered his thighs, scattered on his muscles. The hair also grows as his pubic, surrounding his meat. It is growing upwards, forming a nice treasure trail that finish along his stomach, below his lower abs, just like Dean&#39;s treasure trail. <br />
<br />
His face started to become more mature, everything is transformed to complete his persona. He grows stubble along his features, a thin moustache, and a thin beard, together meet at his chin. His body producing more testosterone, coursing through his veins, flooded his still growing body. Just like Dean, his growth also managed to turn his voice deeper, left nothing of his cracked boyish voice. <br />
<br />
His hair also changes from messy long dark hair to short, textured crop, complimenting his stubbles. He is now grown to age 25. The transformation not only gives him a growth spurt, it also changed his attitude, from insecure boy to a confident and gaining self esteem. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my....&quot;, Jeff finally talks. It has a bit vibration on that words that just left his mouth. Dean is stunned but not surprised. &quot;Oh.. little Jeff is not so little anymore.&quot;, Dean mutters. &quot;I can hear you, Dean.&quot;, Jeff reminding him, in his deep and more matured voice. &quot;Right.&quot;<br />
<br />
The transformation stop. Jeff finally reaches the age 25, the same age as the man once a product of his experiment. Dean is mesmerized at the newly transformed young man infront of him. &quot;What?&quot;, Jeff asks, which can shook everyone&#39;s core if they hear he speak. &quot;Look at yourself. You are a man. A sexy man, even sexier than me.&quot;, Dean tossed Jeff to look at the mirror. And yes, he is changed a lot. He touches all of his body parts with his hand, still cannot believe that the figure that look at him back from the mirror is actually him as a 25 years old hot young man.<br />
<br />
&quot;I look... different.&quot;, Jeff says. &quot;Of course. This is what you would look like if you are grown up, but I guess &#39;would&#39; is not relevant at this point. Because it already happened.&quot;, Dean cheering him up. <br />
<br />
&quot;So? How about that? You like your new body?&quot;, Dean asks again. &quot;Sure. I just... can&#39;t believe that I got this chances to be an adult sooner. I liked my new reality though.&quot;, Jeff replys. <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, so from now on, don&#39;t belittle yourself Jeff, because confidence and believing in your own potential is a key to conquers your fear. Do you hear me?&quot;, Dean gived a word of wisdom to his best friend. &quot;Alright, Mr. Dean. I will remember all this advices, always.&quot; Jeff nodded at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do we do now? Because I&#39;m really cold and starving here.&quot;, Dean chirped at Jeff. The room is fall to a complete silent, before their laughthers broke. &quot;I don&#39;t even know. Anything fun I guess?&quot;, Jeff suggesting. They standing there, looking at each other, giggling and playfully hit each other&#39;s arms.</p>
