<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile, Sarah had finally found her way to the Computer Science class. The Schoolgirl’s mere presence was causing the area surrounding the Computer Science room to shift and change. <br />
<br />
Sarah entered the room. It was your standard Computer Science class. A dozen or so students hard at work on dated computers, in swivel chairs. Sarah got a few curious glances from some of the busy students, before they returned to work. Thinking that a twenty-ish year old slut walking around practically in the nude was perfectly normal. The schoolgirl grinned when her eyes landed upon a plain looking girl who wore an anime shirt and a blue miniskirt. Her hair was a multicolored mess. She was a bit of a slob, and her face had a few unfortunate pimples. Sarah smiled and approached the sluggish blonde. The schoolgirl put her hands behind the anime fan’s eyes. <br />
<br />
“Guess who?” Sarah said in a singsong voice. “Macy?” 	<br />
<br />
“Sarah?” Macy asked spinning around in her swivel chair, her eyes went wide when she saw Sarah. “Wow! What happened to you?” <br />
<br />
Sarah was a little shocked, the last few people who were turned didn’t seem to notice the newly sexualized changes around them. Macy was special. The schoolgirl licked her lips. <br />
<br />
“You’ll see.” Sarah replied, planting a kiss on a very surprised Macy’s lips. “Enjoy.” <br />
<br />
Macy groaned as her body aged up to around her early twenties. Sarah pulled out her phone from between her breasts. She began to record a video. Giggling at Macy’s transformation. <br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m gonna enjoy watching this over, and over again.” Sarah coed as Macy’s hair curved and became snow white. <br />
<br />
Macy’s skin became flawless of course and her eyes turned bright blue. She fell back into her chair, which quickly began to take on a life of its own, quickly becoming a luxurious bed. Sarah giggled as she crawled onto the bed to watch Macy continue to change. She aged up into her early twenties. Her breasts quickly in size becoming sizeable Double DD cups, her top shifted to form a lacy bra that gingerly hugged them. The rest of her shirt became a sea thru night gown. Whilst her panties took on a lacy black quality. Macy’s hips and thighs flared out, giving her a lovely hourglass figure. Then Macy’s legs extended giving her a few more inches. The finishing touches were applied via expert makeup, a black headband, white gloves and black heals. <br />
<br />
Sarah grinned devilishly, but then gasped as something wonderful happened. A golden collar appeared on Macy’s neck, just like Sarah’s. It read, ‘Cosplay Slut’. The schoolgirl nearly dropped her phone in disbelief. She zoned out for a few moments as Macy felt up her new assets. <br />
<br />
“Wow! That was awesome!” Macy yelled, as the rest of the class worked feverishly, ignoring what had just transpired. “How did you do that Sarah?” <br />
<br />
“M-mistress Aphrodite, its her doing…” Sarah replied, stopping the video and placing her phone back into her canyon of cleavage. <br />
<br />
Macy’s eyes went wide, images of the Goddess flashed before her eyes. A purpose, a reason to serve. A desire to change those around her. A desire felt by Sarah as well. They both locked lustful eyes before Sarah crawled over to Macy. She pressed her lips to hers, and the two shared a passionate kiss. Sarah then went on the offensive, removing Macy’s bra so she could begin massage the cosplayer’s breasts. <br />
<br />
 The computer science room was already beginning to change. Only this time with an added twist, in addition to becoming more classical. The technology in the room became more modern, video camera’s and laptops. Sex toys replaced pencils and notebooks. Where once had been a crummy computer that Macy was working out quickly became a laptop and livestreaming set up. Perfect for shooting pornography to a live audience. <br />
<br />
Everyone in the class aged up, entering there twenties. Many of the girls changed like Macy, becoming fully sexualized and realized versions of there favorite characters. Those who didn’t still became sexy and were confused at first as to why they were working at computers when their breasts would get in the way of typing. Why were they typing? They were camgirls, sluts and bimbos after all. Not meant for hard thinking or work.  Many of the girls reached for the nearest toy or started dancing on top of the beds. Showing everything, they could for their horny audience. <br />
<br />
Thankful sexy buff men were there to help the former students into their new camgirl careers, and pornstar careers as well. The men became buff, but still retaining their knowledge. They were perfectly willing and capable to help fill any problems and any holes. Some of the most intense sex occurred, rough and violent. The ever-expanding halls of the Computer Science class were filled with moans and cries of lust. Music echoed overhead, encouraging the new studs and sluts to go harder. Anything to get those ratings up. Gone was the former Computer Science class in its place was a new ‘Porn Center’. <br />
<br />
Sarah grinned, knowing full well that Aphrodite would reward her for making this possible. She leaned forward into the computer that was livestreaming her and Macy. Nearly 50,000 live watchers. Many of the comments talking about how sexy the schoolgirl was, and for Macy to get fully nude. Sarah blushed as Macy licked her earlobe and whispered. <br />
<br />
“After this, you’re gonna have a lot of explaining to do…” Macy stated as she reached for Sarah’s breasts and started fondling them, “These girls for instance didn’t just grow on their own. Tell me about Aphrodite…” <br />
<br />
Sarah moaned, reflecting on how just a few hours ago she was nothing more than an ugly little girl. Now her best friend was a proper servant of Aphrodite. Soon, the whole school would be under there control. Then her, Macy, Alexa and Natalie would get to know each other in a more private environment. That was something, that Sarah could hardly wait for.</p>
