<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Ty are you going to leave your muscle statue there at the beach?” asks Kent.<br />
<br />
&quot;Na. I moved him back to Florida.” Replies Ty. “I created a section on a popular beach there that only gay muscle men will be drawn. There he will be very popular. Not only will he be aware of his surroundings but he will be totally aroused by what he has become.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we go there when we get back home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Kent. Who knows maybe there will be more statues there before you know it&quot; Ty says looking at the asses of his latest work.<br />
<br />
&quot;The view isn't bad is it Ty? Too bad there aren't more guys like these around&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There can be more. How big do you want them to be?<br />
<br />
&quot;Hum, I don't know. Maybe increase the weight of all the males with lean muscle. Make them as big as bodybuilders.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. Any male that looks at our two muscle bullies will grow big like a bodybuilder. Than to make things really interesting their cock and balls will double in size. They will also be in a constant state of arousal. No one will think it is strange that all these males are looking and acting like over sexed gay bodybuilders.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As the rickshaw went down Ocean Front Drive dozens of sets of eyes watched them go down the street.  A one hundred and ninety eight pound middle-aged man step out of a Starbucks coffee shop drinking a double mocha latt&eacute; as the group passed. The man stopped in his tracks as strange sensation came over his body making him drop his cup. His clothes become tighter and tighter. The hair on his head, thought somewhat thinning all over, begins to thicken as it turns a lighter shade of brown. The sides start to retreat back into his head as the top reforms into a high flat top. His over weighted body was absorbing the fat and replacing it with lean but bulging muscle. His now skintight clothing could not the strain any longer. “RRRIIIIPPP!!!” Everything ripped to shreds and fell to the ground at his feet.  His plaid boxer shorts were straining to contain what lie beneath it. As the bulge got bigger the shorts got smaller, shiner and smoother. Soon he stood there only in a speedo like poser with a bulge that could not be ignored.<br />
<br />
Little 10-year-old Jimmy McMasterson and his fellow cub scouts, troop number 82, just got off the tour bus at fifth and Main St. as the rickshaw went by. All the boys looked in aw as the over muscled men passed. Jimmy started to feel sick to his stomach all of a sudden. He bent over in pain gripping himself in the place his mother told him never to touch in public. The pain was so bad he didn’t care, it really hurt down there. Soon the pain began to feel kind of nice but the “sick feeling” he had was still there. <br />
<br />
His little body began to swell size but not in height. His shoulders expanded wider. His chest and back began to thicken forcing his arms out from his sides. His waist stayed little but now it looked foreign to him. It reminded him of the loaves of bread rising in the warm kitchen on the bakery tour he was on last week. His arms were getting bigger, bigger than his big brothers teenage arms. His legs were next to expand bigger to their new size. They were now so big he had to bend them at the knees to keep from falling over.  His little pubic area was now the size of a full grown adult. Many an adult male would love to have a bulge &quot;little&quot; Jimmy was sporting now. <br />
<br />
When he joined cub scouts he was smallest one in his troop and his Cub Scout uniform use to be too big for him.  Now his clothes were real tight on him. They were so tight that they began to rip to pieces exposing his now buff body down to his tightie whities. His white cotton underwear had changed to a pair of deep red spandex posers. <br />
“Little” Jimmy began to explore his new body. Starting at the top of his broad shoulders down to his thick calves his hands began caressing his new muscles. When he returned to a standing position his hands stopped on his new package. A smile formed on his boyish but now manly face as he looked at his fellow cub scouts who by now had completed similar transformations. To the rest of the world it looked like a school for young bodybuilders had just come to town.<br />
<br />
<br />
Isaac was enjoying the day at the beach by doing some in-line skating. It was a short bus ride from his down town apartment to the beach. After renting a locker at the rec center to store his street clothes he changed into a blue under armour sleeveless shirt and black spandex pants. The outfit did little to hide his well-toned body, and that's the way he liked it. He had spent years honing his body.<br />
<br />
 He had always been what people would call husky but in his eyes he was fat. Everyone in his family were big eaters. When the Eddie Murphy movie the &quot;Kumps&quot; came out Isaac thought they had secretly video taped his family during one of their meals. The table was always fill with plenty of food. His mother always made him feel guilty if he didn't eat everything she put on his plate. That's why he moved to Venice Beach two years ago when he had the opportunity.  The first thing Isaac did, when he could afford it, was to join a gym in the area of his studio apartment. Loosing the fat was the easy part, gaining the muscle he wanted was harder. That's the main reason why he moved to California to be near the infamous Muscle Beach area. He made it a part of his daily routine to go Venice Beach as often as he could for inspiration for having lean body.<br />
<br />
Isaac had already gone from one end of Venice Beach to the other and was fast approaching the rec center. As he passed the center he thought he saw a muscular statue in a very strange pose. Next thing Isaac knew he was lying on the ground across from the person he had just run into. By the time they both had gotten up and exchanged pleasantries the statue was gone.  Was he seeing things that weren't there? He decided to try to forget what he thought he saw and went back to his workout. He was about to restart his workout when he saw something strange behind the rec center. Everywhere he looked he saw bodybuilders clad only speedo type posers. On the beach side there were muscular guys on bicycles. Muscular babies sitting on top of squashed strollers that could no longer hold their weight. A five-pound weight was flying over the sand like Frisbee from one muscular bodybuilder to another. Off to one side muscular grade school boys were building sand mounds shaped like bodybuilders. <br />
<br />
There was a group of what looked like eighty plus-year-old men on the other side of the center. Some of the men were either playing yard bowling or shuffleboard while a few others were playing board games like checkers or chess. Ordinarily that would not have gotten his attention but today it did. They had bodies that were well beyond any seasoned bodybuilder. The old men were all wrinkle free with muscular bodies clad only in same familiar speedo type posers. They were all involved in pose downs when not playing their respective game. <br />
<br />
On the beach there was a mens only V-ball game. None of the players were under two hundred pounds of bulging striated muscle.  Watching the bulging muscles flexed and contracted during the game had all the guys around the volleyball court sporting wet spots. Soon every one of them had a bulge in their posers that rivaled the ball that was being batting over the net. Isaac had to get out of there before he to would start getting hard. <br />
<br />
He hurried down the sidewalk as fast as he could to get away from all those hot sweaty muscular bodies. The crowd ahead of him did not change. There were just as many bodybuilders the farther he got from the center Then he saw the strangest thing in all the years he has been in California, a rickshaw being pulled by the biggest bodybuilders he has ever seen. The closer he got to the rickshaw the stranger he felt. His workout clothes were getting tighter and tighter. His feet began to feel cramped inside his in-line skates. The more he looked at the two pulling the rickshaw the better they looked. With a resoundingly long rip Isaac felt a cool breeze come over his body. Thoughts of bodybuilding routines and other bodybuilders came flooding came into Isaac’s mind. Isaac glanced back at the passengers in the rickshaw and saw that they sported the same evil type of a grin. One of them was talking to the other.<br />
<br />
“I’m glad to be one of your friends Ty.”  Says Kent. “The sights on this vacation keep getting better and better.”</p>
