<br />
&quot;All.. almost there...&quot; Said Amy with a droppy head, Ami came behind her and helped her <br />
hold the calligraphy brush over the long scroll showing now two timelines about halfway <br />
merged.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay Amy,&quot; Ami whispered, her own voice tired and somehow spent, &quot;Just a little bit <br />
more, and we&#39;ll be there. And we can continue, the grafting will be complete, and we can <br />
finally move foreword.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Will... we will have the strength to move foreword after the grafting?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I hope so Amy, I hope so...&quot; <br />
<br />
Ami looked down at the scroll, seeing an illustration of herself kneeling in front of a <br />
scrolling barely able to hold a brush with the strength she had left with Ami using what <br />
strength she had left to help her complete the merge of the two threads of time&#39;s rope to <br />
keep it from breaking totally apart. &quot;Just... a bit... more...&quot; Amy/Ami reached down, so said <br />
the two pups with fur as white as freshly fallen snow with red fur marks that resembled <br />
brush strokes. <br />
<br />
+++++<br />
<br />
Glass slept quietly, laying on the beach. Created to be the most &quot;powerful&quot; of Kurse&#39;s <br />
creations she somehow sensed the anguish that went through the Pack and the Pride. <br />
Kaylee and Jensen were happy to be alive again... but strangely depressed at being <br />
separate persons rather then a singular statue. The gem wolves were glad to be who they <br />
were again, but simultaneously fighting with the duel nature of their minds... like multiple <br />
souls now resided inside them. The child minds wanted to dance and be free... which in <br />
and of itself wasn&#39;t all that bad, while their original minds tried explain to the other souls <br />
within them that that certain things that they would have to do in order to really live... <br />
which lead to arguments between the souls over whether or not &quot;order&quot; was really worth it. <br />
The worst of these came from Elise and Fox of the Pride, since they had each been split <br />
into four separate entities. And in a strange dreamscape, Glass sensed the conflicting <br />
misery that radiated from the Pack and the pride over the issue.<br />
<br />
There was also the misery and fright of the people from the yacht. Six of their children <br />
were now in a town called Glendale, which they didn&#39;t know of. They&#39;d heard of Glendale, <br />
Arizona, but the Glendale they were in was not that one. This then lead them to panic, <br />
especially as Abbey painfully explained unless they wanted to become female glass pups <br />
as well, they could not be taken to their children and their children could not be brought <br />
to them.<br />
<br />
It was Pyrrhic victory in the sense of all the mental suffering the Pack and the Pride and <br />
Kurse&#39;s victims were going through now that Kurse was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;They will recover,&quot; a voice spoke to Glass as she slept, &quot;in time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Glass&#39;s dream image seemed to ponder the voice, which seemed to come out of nowhere. <br />
She looked around until she saw a mirror that held a glass wolf, that looked identical to <br />
her. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; Glass asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; the other Glass spoke, &quot;we are one of Kurse&#39;s creations... made to be our mother&#39;s <br />
most powerful servant...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we did nasty things,&quot; Glass retorted, &quot;invading someone else&#39;s home and trying to kill <br />
someone else&#39;s children... and attacking those that came to save us...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; the other Glass nodded, &quot;but &quot;mother&#39;s&quot; transformations were sloppy... chaotic... <br />
and that ultimately that led to our defeat against the Pack and the Pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kurse wasn&#39;t our mother,&quot; Glass told her &quot;double&quot;, &quot;she merely created us... to do her <br />
evil... and that hurts the others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They will heal in time,&quot; the other Glass said again, &quot;the struggle between Caroline and <br />
Cobalt will end and the two souls will eventually reach a compromise that allows them to <br />
live as normal a life as a humanoid wolf can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Glass asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean how do WE know this,&quot; the other Glass sighed, &quot;well... mostly because of the <br />
powers Kurse gave us... we&#39;re free of her evil and are now able to think for ourselves <br />
now... but we can still sense and remember Kurse&#39;s intentions... because of what she did <br />
to us, we might have the best understanding of how her powers worked, exactly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She wanted their misery to be permanent,&quot; Glass spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes she did,&quot; the other Glass nodded, &quot;but if it WAS to be permanent, then that wouldn&#39;t <br />
have been chaotic... which shows that even in her worship of chaos, Kurse was nothing <br />
more then a hypocrite... she worshiped Chaos, yet wanted ordered control and obedience <br />
to her... and as such, left her magics chaotic, making much of their effects incapable of <br />
being permanent... and that will allow the Pack and the Pride to heal the wounds they have <br />
endured, both physical and mental. The only question is how long will that take.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you now?&quot;  The first Glass asked. <br />
<br />
The second Glass answered, &quot;You mean what we are now. You could say we are Kurse, or <br />
rather, how Kurse was MEANT herself to be before the coven went mad and turned their <br />
backs on their fellow human beings. We are possibilities. We are freedom of will.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Glass spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;We will need to move on,&quot; the other Glass told her, &quot;be with our family and put the <br />
nightmare Kurse placed on the world behind us. Help our parents get used to what we are <br />
now. We can decide on the rest once we get there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the others? The Pack? The Pride?&quot; Glass asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is not our place to meddle in their lives,&quot; the other Glass almost whimpered, &quot;and <br />
besides... our family will need our help more, as will others. Our destiny lies elsewhere. <br />
The Pack and the Pride have others who will help them recover, and the one they called <br />
Amy to provide a &quot;lighted&quot; path to recovery.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, now I guess we wake up,&quot; Glass sighed, &quot;what are we to call ourselves now? Glass <br />
isn&#39;t a name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, the other Glass nodded, &quot;I doubt Martin would be a good name for us now though... <br />
our Other Mother has made us female...&quot; The second Glass said, making a reference to the <br />
movie Coraline from her tone. <br />
<br />
&quot;Martina?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only other &quot;M&quot; name I can think of is Mary, but that&#39;s that cub&#39;s name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I doubt we&#39;ll be seeing much of her or her friends,&quot; the other Glass said, &quot;Mary is a fine <br />
name, but there is also an alteration to that... Marie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Marie it is then,&quot; the renamed Marie spoke, &quot;hopefully mother gets used to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Glass, who had rechristened herself Marie awoke find herself laying in a sheltered area <br />
among a several rocks. Abbey stood guard over her while Julie and Darla stood nearby, <br />
both of them heavily bandaged, and Darla having one arm in a sling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Abbey asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; Marie spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for what I did.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was Kurse&#39;s doing, not yours,&quot; Darla spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is mommy?&quot; Marie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the passengers from the yacht?&quot; Julie asked, &quot;or one of the pack?&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie asked this to make sure that &quot;Glass&quot; wasn&#39;t in the same sort of brainwashed state that <br />
the pack had once been in.<br />
<br />
&quot;The yacht,&quot; Marie answered, &quot;Mommy&#39;s name is Eliza. I want to go home.&quot;  <br />
<br />
++++++++++++<br />
<br />
In her dreamscape as she rested in Glendale&#39;s police station, the others too tired to bother <br />
her, Amy found herself before the mirror image of herself... Ami. The soul she&#39;d been <br />
reincarnated from.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve done well Amy,&quot; Ami spoke politely, &quot;The destiny we had to face has come and <br />
gone. Good has prevailed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Has it really, Ami?&quot; Amy asked back, &quot;I mean the pack had effects on each other that the <br />
curse had no expectation of. Made Jensen and Kaylee and through them the rest of the <br />
pack more benign. Does that mean that maybe Glass could have made Kurse more <br />
benign?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What made the pack become more and more benign was the fact that they were all good <br />
people at heart,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;they all had their faults... but ultimately they were good <br />
people. But Kurse... Kurse was different. She lost all concepts of love the instant she <br />
believed that anyone without magic was merely a mindless machine to serve order and <br />
created the infamous &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; scenario between them and society... and then began <br />
to attack society because &quot;society&quot; was the enemy... it was the same with the people who <br />
ruled Japan during the war. They saw any &quot;other&quot; as subhuman and worthy of conquest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy nodded, &quot;but couldn&#39;t the witches have had good intentions to begin with?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions,&quot; Ami retorted, &quot;was driving <br />
children mad under the pretext of &quot;liberating&quot; them from laws the right thing to do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy firmly shook her head, &quot;No.  But I wouldn&#39;t say they were all good at heart. Kyle was <br />
small and petty, Jennifer was selfish and cruel. They were not precisely good people. Gaal, <br />
Gomorrah, and Galgatha, were originally innocent and well meaning. Then Jensen and <br />
Kaylee learned what it meant to care for someone as parents and as a couple would. Then <br />
coven took anarchy to it&#39;s illogical extreme for spending their lives in a unfair world... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They made their own bed and slept in it, you know that, and I know that.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say they didn&#39;t make their own choices. BUt when they channeled chaos <br />
unfiltered, it drove them insane and lost sight of their goal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The world needs order, Amy,&quot; Ami explained, &quot;and the world needs chaos. They are two <br />
sides that mutually improve the world. The witches in their actions embraced chaos and <br />
decided to do away with order... and that is why Big Bad Island became so dark under their <br />
influence... if there was any hint of goodness left in them... much of what the Pack and the <br />
Pride encountered there would not have happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I still sense so much pain, Ami, so much suffering,&quot; Amy told Ami, &quot;it&#39;s so wrong... <br />
and there has to have been something we could have done to prevent it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps, but we have passed that point,&quot; Ami responded, &quot;and as for the suffering you <br />
feel, there isn&#39;t much I or you can do for them... the twin souls within members of our <br />
pack are not supposed to exist, and neither are the four souls within Fox and Elise of the <br />
Pride... as they are all creations of Kurse&#39;s magics, but the beings they resided in were <br />
real... were supposed to exist. If they didn&#39;t revert back to the physical forms they had <br />
before Kurse decided making them younger and twins was a good idea... they would have <br />
ALL died as the souls weren&#39;t real. By merging them back together those souls may survive <br />
alongside the original soul...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So there&#39;s actually three souls in some of our pack mates?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only in those who renamed one of their twin selves,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;and even there... <br />
that is hard to define. Robyn&#39;s soul is Robyn... but it is made up of Roxy and Brylee... who <br />
as I said should not exist at all... but I could not let anyone die. I have experienced it, and <br />
it is not pleasant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is their anyway to fix the problem?&quot; Amy asked, &quot;Let Robyn&#39;s soul regain control of Robyn <br />
and let Roxy and Brylee exist on their own?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger would need to impregnate Robyn with twins before that would happen,&quot; Ami <br />
answered, &quot;though that is a likely outcome... given Kaylee&#39;s past pregnancies... I would say <br />
it is common for Big Bad Wolves to have twins...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But Zelipe is not our twin, he is our half brother,&quot; Amy pointed out, &quot;and Alice, Abbey, and <br />
Samantha are not twins or triplets... they are identical because of their mothers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but but remember that we as Randy were married to Zelda,&quot; Ami spoke, &quot;and we were <br />
reborn to a larger family then we had before. So, June and Pearl shared us as we were <br />
reborn. We became June&#39;s daughter and Zelda became Pearl&#39;s son. Alice, Abbey, and <br />
Samantha were reborn much the same way. Kaylee is the only one who when she and <br />
Jensen remade their parents is the only one who did not need to share her &quot;children&quot; with <br />
others.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it is natural for us to bear twins?&quot; Amy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;and that might be the only way to let the Gem wolves&#39; internal twins <br />
to live... the other obvious way would be to physically merge their souls... but we are not <br />
strong enough for that... and since it was created by Kurse... ONLY one of Kurse&#39;s <br />
creations could do that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What about Glass?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She might be able,&quot; Ami commented, &quot;I do sense Kurse&#39;s power within her, and yet neither <br />
do I sense Kurse&#39;s evil... perhaps she is the one who will become the benign force to cure <br />
the evils that Kurse has done to our pack or the Hardy&#39;s pride.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we be able to do something?&quot; Amy asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can help,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;but our destiny, Amy, was to stop Kurse, which is what we <br />
did... fixing the Pyrrhic nature of our victory to set things right and set the balance <br />
between order and chaos is Glass&#39;s destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy laughed, &quot;The joke is that we STILL aren&#39;t acting like regular wolves... the nuclear <br />
family is actually much more closely related to REAL wolf packs than any polygamy.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;That was likely due to the ignorance of the character &#39;the Big Bad Wolf&#39; that existed at the <br />
time the character was written. Chaos in it&#39;s purest unfiltered state was -never- meant to <br />
interact with the universe at large. The universe is based on rules, it is a closed system of <br />
cause and effect. Chaos is the exact opposite of this, so of course it&#39;ll damage reality, the <br />
history forming for the wolf pack in the past along with the pride are reality scabbing over <br />
to heal itself. Once something exists, it must have a self contained reason for existing, yet <br />
Chaos was an outside force, therefore, the laws of reality state they -have- to have a past <br />
for how they came to be as they are now that is self contained in of itself. <br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, the majority of those transformed by Kurse&#39;s last act, which equaled in the <br />
millions by the way, reverted with her death,  that&#39;s why half the country is NOT now <br />
elephant people and donkey people from an entranced president&#39;s speech. -However-<br />
<br />
 Those who had already been effected by the curse and live outside of Glendale, or their <br />
DESCENDANTS who live outside of Glendale created a shock-wave, or &#39;cascade&#39;, it made <br />
permanent not only their changes, but those directly connected to them and those<br />
interacting with them at the time. No, to say permanent is to imply something has <br />
changed, as far as reality is concerned, there HAS been no change! Only those directly <br />
afflicted by the curse like Gill, the pack, and pride, will remember things that no longer <br />
happened, and whose to say how long they&#39;ll be able to remember things that no longer <br />
happened: like being the daughter of the children you fathered. This isn&#39;t an effect of the <br />
curse as it&#39;s a natural reaction of reality itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ami said, &quot;The good news is that the turns created outside of Glendale and Big Bad Island <br />
are died as soon as Kurse did since she was extending her power, since if they were <br />
always that was, Kurse could never have used the game to alter them. The bad news is <br />
that reality was forced to cope with those who had been altered, since the law of reality <br />
allows for no inconsistencies. Humans aren&#39;t the only sapient biped with opposable <br />
thumbs<br />
anymore on Earth, or rather, never were. Please tell Serenity this, since she can know that <br />
once Gendale&#39;s is cured, the curse will be gone forever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy, &quot;What about you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I awoke to serve a purpose Amy, I&#39;ve now served that purpose.You can fly on your own <br />
now.&quot;</p>
