<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;This is insane...&quot; Troy muttered to himself as he looks over the book a little more. There just seemed to be so much power stocked in it. But what did it mean by spells requiring energy? And would anyone know if they had been transformed? Or would the world just assume everything was normal? Troy figured it&#39;d best to just try something easy. Half beast shape seemed to have the least amount of consequences if it went wrong. He lived alone. And it didn&#39;t say anything about him becoming a wild animal. So he said, &quot;Half.&quot;<br />
<br />
Troy thought about a lion&#39;s tail. The long yellow furry tail that had a bit of a tuft of fur at the end. He focused on it more and more, thinking about what it would be like if it was behind him. The more he thought about it, the more he could feel his spine elongating. The appendage drooped further and further down his back and swayed behind his legs. Golden fur quickly grew in covering it completely and then a dark brown puff ball grew in at the tip.<br />
<br />
It took a second to register. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK!?&quot; he screamed as he spun around trying to grab at the tail, not quite realizing that it was spinning right along with him. When he finally touched it and felt the feeling rush through him, he paused. &quot;It actually worked...&quot; Troy stood there a bit astounded that something like that was possible. He continued to pet it as the bit of disbelief still held onto him. &quot;It actually worked...&quot; he repeated.<br />
<br />
Now his mind was running wild. If this was possible then the other spells would also be possible. However, he still didn&#39;t understand what it meant by energy. It&#39;s not like he really felt tired. Not much more than usual. But then the excitement of having a tail really excited him. He kicked off his shoes. &quot;Half,&quot; he said again. This time focusing on his feet. Troy made sure not to close his eyes this time.<br />
<br />
He wanted to see what was happening. Through his socks, Troy could see the bones in his feet start reshaping. Each of his toes grew larger and more round. Thick black claws jutted from his socks, tearing them apart. The stretchy fabric couldn&#39;t hold their growth. Each foot rapidly grew wider and fuller. He could feel the bones stretching longer of the midpart of his foot. No longer did he feel like his heels should touch the floor as the forefront of his foot grew so wide and full that he could easily step on it.<br />
<br />
Looking under his foot, he could see paw pads swelling underneath each toe and his foot. &quot;Woah...&quot; he chuckled as he touched the sensitive pads. Golden fur ran up his feet and to his calves. Troy stood up. It was shaky at first as he had to adjust to standing on his tip toes. But it was a quick adjustment as he took a few steps. &quot;This really really works!&quot; troy cheered.<br />
<br />
His next stop was the bathroom. He stared at the mirror. &quot;Half!&quot; the excitement was getting the better of him. He instantly focused on his face. He watched as his teeth became to sharpen. They quickly grew far too large for his mouth. But that was quickly changing as his jaw pushed further out in front of him. It transformed more and more into a maw. His nostrils no longer pointed down, instead they pushed forward as his nose turned a bit more pink and black. He touched at his snout. Whiskers started to grow along with the golden fur.<br />
<br />
Troy hadn&#39;t even realized as his ears migrated to the top of his head. They quickly rounded out. His hair turned dark brown and billowed out from all sides. It grew long and wild. Completely untamed and untamable. He smiled through his maw as he looked over the wild hair and fur covering his lion face. &quot;Half!&quot; he said again without hesitation.<br />
<br />
He was thinking of the rest of his body. Imagining it like the fursonas he&#39;d seen online. Instantly he could feel the strength of a lion filling his human muscles. Each one started to bulge more and more. The shirt and shorts he was wearing couldn&#39;t hold the 570 pounds of muscle building on his body. Pecs pushed far out in front of him. A bit of a belly formed underneath them but it only made him look all the more imposing. His arms and legs grew to accommodate the new weight. His mane pressed against his 8 foot ceiling. <br />
<br />
&quot;AWESOME!&quot; Troy roared, leaning back to full effect. Then leaning back against the sink to get a better view. His massive black claws ejected from his fingertips scraping the counter. &quot;Better learn to control that...&quot; but he went to feeling his new feline face. Troy wanted to examine every bit of his new body. However, he wondered what else this book could do.</p>
