<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff stared at the puddle for a few moments more.  It <i>was</i> a breast after all, but he still wasn’t expecting this to happen, especially not as a form of ejaculation.  Curious, he slid off the bed to get a closer look at the puddle.<br />
<br />
He dipped a finger in it.  It was still warm, having just come out of his body, and it had a thicker texture than he expected.  It was almost like a heavy cream, though only slightly waterier than that.  Hesitantly, he brought his tongue to his finger.<br />
<br />
It was actually pretty good.  He licked the rest of the milk off his finger.  Actually, it was better than good.  It tasted like milk but richer and creamier, and it had a faint muskiness to it that made him crave more.  He scooped a meager amount he could collect from the puddle into his hands and lapped it up, then did it again, and again.<br />
<br />
Jeff was snapped out of his preoccupation when he noticed how much of the milk had already seeped into his carpet.  Cursing silently, he quickly scrambled back into his pants, awkwardly tucking the breast in as best he could.  Surprisingly, the breast seemed to tuck into the crotch of his pants a bit more easily than before, though not by much.  He hurried downstairs to grab some cleaning supplies.<br />
<br />
“Are you coming for breakfast?” Jeff’s mom asked as she saw him hurry through the kitchen.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, just one sec.  I uh- I spilled a drink upstairs and need to clean it real quick,” Jeff stammered, grabbing paper towels and carpet cleaner.  He managed to hide his awkward gait decently well through the rush he was in, though it would probably be more obvious if he was just walking normally.<br />
<br />
“Well, thanks for taking care of it, but be careful in the future if you want to keep the privilege of bringing drinks to your room.  And hurry back down before the eggs get cold!” she called after him as he scurried back to his room, obscuring the bulge in his pants behind the paper towels.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After cleaning up the mess, Jeff figured he needed to come back down for breakfast before inviting anymore unwanted attention.  He changed into a loose pair of gym shorts that gave his crotch-breast a bit more space.  If he sagged them a bit, then it prevented the outline of the breast from being obvious when he sat down.  Satisfied for now, he headed back downstairs.<br />
<br />
Jeff scooped some of the food his mom had made onto a plate and went to get a drink.  After his earlier experience, he still had a lingering craving for some milk, but he couldn’t find any in the fridge.  He asked his mom if there was any left, but she said Jack may have finished it off.  Sighing, he just got some water.  <br />
<br />
He quickly scarfed down the food while trying to think about how to deal with the breast hanging between his legs.  However, try as he might to focus on the problem at hand, he kept getting distracted as his thoughts drifted back to the strange experience earlier with the milk.  He really wished he could have tasted just a bit more of it.  If only he hadn’t wasted it by spilling it all on the carpet.<br />
<br />
Of course, he could get more.  Also, milking himself seemed to ease the strain of stuffing his breast into his trousers, if only slightly.  But if he could milk himself again, it might get even easier.  Maybe this could kill two birds with one stone?  Also, if he could take care of this one thing real quick, then he could get back to focusing on how to hide the breast without being distracted.  He checked his phone.  He still had at least an hour and a half before they had to leave for the party.<br />
<br />
Having sufficiently convinced himself, Jeff rinsed his plate and headed back to his room with his glass.  He locked the door behind him and eagerly jumped back on his bead, ripping his shorts off.  He wasn’t sure if he could even produce milk again this soon, but once he started playing with his crotch-breast, he felt that strange swelling arousal begin again.<br />
<br />
Jeff changed his technique this time, focused on getting the milk out as soon as possible.  With one hand, he teased at the nipple, which felt really good and seemed to build his arousal, but with the other, he massaged and stroked it in a milking gesture like the one he used to help himself pee earlier.  This seemed to work, as he felt himself building to the edge far faster than before.<br />
<br />
Soon, as the pressure built in the breast, he felt himself passing the point of no return.  He quickly grabbed the cup as he kept massaging the breast with the other hand.  Leaning forward and awkwardly shoving the nipple into the glass, he barely managed to position himself in time to catch the milk as he began to release.<br />
<br />
Though not quite as intense as last time, Jeff still had trouble not spilling any of the milk that spurted forth as his whole body shook in pleasure.  He continued squeezing and stroking the breast, eliciting a burst of pleasure and a surge in the flow of milk until, many seconds later, it eventually subsided.  He sat the glass on the desk and laid back, basking in the afterglow of the orgasm.  He still wanted his dick back, but he had to admit that there were some positives to this whole thing.  Normally, he could never have gone again that soon, even if it wasn’t quite as good as the first time.<br />
<br />
He turned his attention back to the glass to see how much milk he had produced.  It filled the glass about three fourths of the way—easily a cup and a half of milk, give or take.  Excitedly, he brought the glass to his lips.  The milk tasted even better than he remembered.  He tried taking small sips to savor it, but it didn’t last long before he was taking deep gulps, relishing its rich, creamy-yet-slightly-musky flavor.  Before he’d known it, Jeff had finished the whole glass.<br />
<br />
For some reason, drinking the milk seemed to heighten the pleasant post-orgasm bliss.  He relaxed on his bed for a moment, shivers coursing throughout his body as he felt the hot milk travel down his esophagus.  As it settled in his stomach, he felt a warm tingle spread all over his body.  He didn’t know why he was feeling so good after drinking the milk, but he wasn’t going to question it.  <br />
<br />
Jeff laid there, enjoying the nice sensations for a few minutes before deciding that he’d wasted enough time already.  He tried his jeans back on, and while it was even easier to fit the crotch-breast in than before, it was still uncomfortable and left a bit of a bulge.  He returned to figuring out how to dress for the party.</p>
