<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Megan clicked on the character Will, as he hung up his coat in the closet, she had some time, it was a big house and it would take him a while to search it for her. She watched as options came up when she clicked on it. &quot;Bower, William H.; Age: 25, Height: 5'11&quot; Weight: 175. Quite a few of the options had to do with changing his species, or his gender, or even both. But that wasn't quite what she was looking for, not as a first test anyway. <br />
<br />
A few more scrolling and she found the perfect one, she was going to change his age. She had seen pictures of Will when he was a boy, the cutest thing she'd ever seen. &quot;It couldn't hurt, it's probably not even real.&quot; She clicked on the age option, selecting the appropriate age, around six or seven-years-old. Then it prompted once again. 'Memory Status?' She selected full memory and capabilities, meaning the aware toggle was selected. <br />
<br />
Then there was the clothing option, it had the ability to match the person's clothing (or lack of) as the person's body change. She had rather see her boyfriend squirm in them, just for fun's sake. Megan selected that there would be no change in Will's clothing. Saving the transformation as a file but keeping the original appearance for as long as it was possible. 'Transformation Beginning, estimated time, five minutes. Normal transformation, special options unaware until transformation is complete.'<br />
<br />
Will walked into the living area, shaking his head slightly as the room shifted somehow. Will had on was a pair of slacks, as he continued to walk through the house, searching for his girlfriend, he had to stop as he walked to hike up his slacks, &quot;That's weird?&quot; Will said as he pulled them up to his waist, Will was still too focused to give it much thought, so he continued from room to room, Will did notice, however, that he had to keep pulling the slacks up to keep them from slipping down his thighs. Will thought that was weird but he just blew it off. &quot;Megan, where the heck are you, come on, this isn't funny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan smiled, slightly as she heard his voice change only slightly. It was actually working, she couldn't believe it. She gave it some thought and decided to have some fun for a few days with Will being a little boy, before telling him of the Chronivac.<br />
<br />
Will had to keep one hand on the waist line of his pants just to keep them from sliding down his waist, still paying no mind as to why it was happening, but it was starting to become an irritation. Will knew these pants fit him right when Megan had  picked them out for him this morning. So something had to have happened to them while he was working, maybe he just stretched them out while he was moving some of his things, that had to be it. But then his shirt started to droop well past his hands as he moved them. &quot;Megan....&quot; His voice seemed to be much higher than before, and the room around him was most definitely larger.<br />
<br />
Rubbing his chin, Will, couldn't place what was wrong, he noticed that his chin felt as smooth as a baby's butt. ~Must be that new razor. ~ Will reasoned. Scratching at his chest, Will felt the prickle of the remainder of his hair receding into his body, including his pubic hair. His skin became soft and silky almost, like a young child's, all the while, Will noticed nothing of it, just kept searching for his beautiful girlfriend, the cause of all that was happening to him.<br />
<br />
Will's body looked thinner and less muscular in every which way. Will put his drink down on the table and then hiked up his slacks once more, they had ridden down to almost crotch level by from all the walking he'd been doing, he sighed slightly. &quot;She must not be here, she would have heard me by now.&quot; His voice was that of a child now with the reasoning of an adult. Even when he passed by the mirror, he noticed nothing strange, simply saying that he would have to go for a haircut soon. He gave up for the moment on looking for Megan, she'd find him later. Just as the thought passed through his mind the hair on top of his head lightened in color and became much shorter all together.<br />
<br />
Will was actually beginning to pick up on some of the changes to him now, meaning the changes were near completion, he had noticed that the waist line of the slacks didn't even touch his own waistline anymore, and even the elastic waistband of his boxers didn't cling to his waist. He wasn't going to believe his own thoughts, he would have noticed had something so obvious happened. Though, his shirt had become increasingly hard to manage as well as all the other pieces of clothing. Will stood there his pants were sliding down his waist and legs, Will had to reach down and <br />
grab them before they would fall to his knees.<br />
<br />
Will was starting to reach a realization, things in the room were obviously much larger than he had ever remembered. &quot;This can't be happening.&quot; He grabbed his throat with one hand, his voice portrayed no adult sounds, only that of a young boy, well before puberty. Will felt his neck and chin, where there would usually be some stubble at least by now, there was nothing but smooth, soft skin.<br />
<br />
Will looked down at the slacks he had on, they were huge on him now and they were all bunched up around the tops of his socked feet that were now standing in the cuffs of the slacks. <br />
<br />
Megan laughed a little, poor little Will now looked to be about nine-years-old and was more or less defenseless against the world and he knew it, she watched from the monitor as Will tried to figure out how to keep his clothes on his person. &quot;You look positively adorable. I knew you'd be this cute, I didn't know seeing you like this was going to be so much fun.&quot; Megan said out loud with a grin.<br />
<br />
Will just looked around the room in a slight panic the full effect not hitting him quite yet, everything seemed so big and tall to him now, especially the old Grandfather Clock which used to be just an inch or so taller then he was. But now it literally towered above him. Will let go of his clothes, trying to get away as his transformation a realization was finalized, everything all just cascaded off of him, it all left his body in favor of gravity, he saw when his shirt, pants and underwear left his now frail little body, freaked him out! Will was hairless, he didn't even have pubic hair anymore. &quot;This can't be happening!&quot; Will's voice cracked back to that of a prepubescent kids and he had a look of shock on his little seven-year-old face. <br />
<br />
Will was now a scared, naked seven-year-old, with no clue as to why this happened or even how it happened. He couldn't let Megan see him like this, but who else could help him, there was no one in the world he trusted more.<br />
<br />
Megan smiled, seeing the message pop up that it was completed. She stood, turning off the computer, and making her way to the den, it would take some acting but it was worth it, seeing Will in the buff with a tiny little boy body. She walked into the room. &quot;What is going on in here? Who are you?&quot; She asked, holding back a snicker as she saw her diminished boyfriend standing there with no thought to even cover himself. But he was the cutest thing she'd seen, smooth to the touch, and for the next few days, she was going to enjoy mothering him.</p>
