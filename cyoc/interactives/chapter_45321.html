<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was a hot Summer day in Washington and Rick was glad that he was someplace cool. He was under ground in fact going through some ruins his friend Harry and him found. Harry was an archaeologist but Rick wasn't. Rick had a nice office job and he was on vacation. He came to Washington to visit Harry and got roped into helping him find ruins he was sure were in the state. They had searched all day yesterday, the first day of Rick's vacation, and didn't find anything. Today however they had found the entrance to some caves which led them here.<br />
<br />
They were traveling down a corridor now. Harry looking around and making notes. He wanted to be sure that he was the one to get credit for this discovery. In the past he had had others take credit for his discoveries. It had always been someone on his team that did it which is why it was just the two of them exploring these ruins. &quot;Have you seen any ruins like these before?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Harry, these are the first ruins I've seen&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh right&quot; Harry said. &quot;Well these ruins are fascinating. If I'm right these ruins are from a civilization that pre-dates the native Indian civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because they didn't have the tools to carve stone like this&quot; Harry said shining his flashlight up at the ceiling. &quot;These ruins were built by an advanced civilization.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Atlanteans or aliens?&quot; Rick asked chuckling a bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; Harry said. &quot;They were advanced though.&quot;<br />
<br />
After another fifteen minutes they came to a dead end. It seemed like it had been just one long hall. Harry was looking at the wall like it had offended him. When Rick thought about it the wall kind of did by existing and creating this dead end. &quot;Did you see anything that could have been a door while we were walking?&quot; Harry asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I didn't&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This doesn't make sense&quot; Harry said. &quot;Why have a long hallway with no openings along it only to have it end?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps the Atlanteans or aliens put in a secret door here&quot; Rick joked. &quot;Perhaps if we pressed the right spot the door will be revealed.&quot; As a joke he put his hand on a picture that looked like a gate with light coming from it and pushed. To his surprise it actually moved in a bit and the wall split down the middle and retracted into the walls with a stone scraping against stone sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that was luck&quot; Harry said as he went through the now open door.<br />
<br />
Rick shook his head and followed. They found themselves in a round chamber. There was some type of pedestal in the center that Harry was at. That was the only thing in the room though. Harry touched a spot on it and the doors ground closed. They looked at each other wondering what was going to happen next. They didn't have to wait long as a bright white light filled the room. Once it faded the door opened again. &quot;Lets get out of here before something happens to us and we get stuck in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we can bring some more people back to help us&quot; Harry said.<br />
<br />
They went through the door and once through it ground shut again. &quot;Uh Harry&quot; Rick said a little bit of uneasiness in his voice. &quot;This doesn't look like the corridor we came in from.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It has to be&quot; Harry said. &quot;The corridor can't just change. Lets go.&quot;<br />
<br />
After five minutes of walking the corridor took an abrupt turn to the right. &quot;I was right&quot; Rick said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can't be&quot; Harry said. &quot;It couldn't have changed.&quot; He kept walking down the hall with a curious expression on his face and Rick followed.<br />
<br />
In another five minutes they came to a room with an altar in the middle of it. Rick went up to it and saw a medallion with a purple gem in the center. &quot;Hey Harry!&quot; he said excitedly. &quot;There's some sort of medallion here!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't touch it!&quot; Harry warned but it was too late as Rick had picked it up.<br />
<br />
A flash of purple light emanated from the gem and Rick doubled over in pain. He watched as his hands slimmed becoming more feminine as well as his arms. His legs and feet hurt so he could only guess they were changing too. Pain flared in his crotch and he felt his dick shrink and his balls pull up inside his body. Pain in his waist and hips told him that they were changing. The pain moved to his chest and he felt a weight grow on it. Finally his whole head exploded in pain and he passed out.<br />
<br />
________________________________<br />
<br />
Rick found himself outside in a meadow. He looked down and saw that he was wearing a flowing light blue dress. It looked like one a princess would wear. The dress wasn't what caught his attention though. It was the breasts on his chest which he guessed were a B or C size. Long platinum blond hair fell into his vision. He was wondering what was going on when a masculine voice said &quot;Welcome Princess.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rick looked up at the man that seemed to have appeared in the meadow out of no where and asked &quot;Who are you?&quot; in a feminine voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Abon&quot; the man said. &quot;I am sure that you are confused right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I'm confused&quot; Rick said throwing up his arms. &quot;I've gone from being a man to be a girl and you call me Princess. What's more I'm not where I was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will explain Princess&quot; Abon said. &quot;The medallion you touched is known as The Medallion of Power. We had sent it to your world after the previous owner had been defeated before we discovered what it really was.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So why did you send it here?&quot; Rick asked in a tone that plainly said he wasn't buying this.<br />
<br />
&quot;We thought that it was cursed&quot; Abon said. &quot;It was not until after we sent it to your world that we found scrolls that explained the medallion transformed someone to what they were inside. The reason we thought it was cursed is because it's last owner had been transformed in a dark monster. He had been human before and was a scion of virtue. We were obviously wrong. When he came into possession of it he became a force of darkness. He transformed others to build his army and tried to conquer our world.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what about me then?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are one that is good inside Princess&quot; Abon said. &quot;It is up to you to ensure that the medallion does not fall into the wrong hands. Armies of darkness are beginning to gather on both of our worlds and you are also responsible for gathering an army of light. You can recruit from either of our worlds and more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How am I suppose to do that?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Inside the ruins there is a chamber with a stone ring&quot; Abon said. &quot;In the center is an altar with symbols on it. Activating these symbols in a specific order will open a gate to any world that has a similar stone ring.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know this?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;People from your world have visited ours&quot; Abon said. &quot;I believe they called themselves druids.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So how do I know which symbols to activate?&quot; Rick asked.<br />
<br />
A series of eight symbols flashed through Rick's brain and Abon said &quot;Those are the symbols for my world. Now I must go since I was only able to contact you like this while you were unconscious and you are starting to wake up.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Abon and the meadow started to fade Rick said &quot;You called me Princess. What's my name?&quot;<br />
<br />
Abon's voice was faint and growing fainter but Rick could here him say &quot;That is for you to decide Princess.&quot;</p>
