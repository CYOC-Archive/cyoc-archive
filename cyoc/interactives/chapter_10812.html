<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Mendes closed the door behind him. The now five year old Ric looked up at his little brother, who was actually three years older than him now. Ric stipped the last bit of clothes off himself and examind his long forgotten kindergarden body. The fact that he had just lost eight years finally dawned on him. Ric guessed that he was around 3'3. His limbs were a little stuby, so were his hands and feet. He had regained his baby fat.He remembered the fine hairs he had had on his arms and legs this morning and wished he hadn't taken them for granted. As he ran his fingers all over his body, he couldn't find a single hair anywhere below his neck. His stomach, that had been beginning to show signs of a six pack, was now round and soft, like any five year olds. He finally let his eyes travel down past his round tummy and settle on his little boyhood nesteled between his thighs. It was so small! As a teenager it had been about five inches hard, now he'd be lucky if it could get half that big. He looked around the room, he didn't even have any clothes to wear now, everything was too big for him. <br />
Josh, on the other hand, wasn't feeling to bad, he had gone back four years, all he had lost was height. He hadn't begun to develope like Ric so he just got shorter, he was now 4'5, maybe. Josh stood in front of the bedroom mirror and pulled off his loose underwear and oversized shirt. He looked pretty much the same, except when he felt his skin he felt smoother than before. He noticed a couple of scars he had earned over the last few years had vanished. He looked down between his legs, &quot;oh!...well, I guess&quot; he murmered, his junk had gotten smaller. He would probably be about three inches hard. He turned around to Ric examining his own body, Hey, I'm bigger than him now, Josh thought to himself. He crept up behind little Ric and stood over him, Ric turned around and saw his little brother towering over head. He was afraid Josh was going to be mean to him, as all big brothers were to little brothers, after all, Ric had been mean to Josh. Josh just smiled and jumped into bed. He liked being bigger than Ric, but he didn't wanna beat him up or anything. Ric, with some effort, climbed into his own bed. It felt so huge to him. Before, he could stretch himself out and touch the end of the bed with his feet, now the bed was nearly twice long as he was. Ric fell asleep almost immediatly, he was five after all, and alot of excitment had happened today. Josh stayed a wake a little longer and watched his older, little brother sleep. Eventually, he dozed off, too.<br />
Josh awoke in the middle of the night to whimpering. He looked over to the direction of the sobs. Ric was sitting up right in his bed, hugging his knees, looking down at a the center of the bed. He had wet himself in the night. Mr. Mendes had thought this might happen, so before he put the spell on either of them, he had put plastic sheets beneath the cotton ones. Mr. Mendes came into the room, removed the sheets from the bed and cleaned up the mess. After replacing the sheets he gave Ric what looked like goodnights, Ric turned red, he had to wear a diaper now, even if it was a diaper for a five year old, it was still a diaper. After an long silence the boys shuffled back into bed and went back to sleep.<br />
The sun crept through their bedroom window and landed on Josh face. He moaned and turned over, trying to get away from the offending sunlight. It was no good, he was awake now. He saw a tangle of blankets in the bed next to him and assumed five year old Rick was lost somewhere under them, still protected from the suns rays. Josh walked over to the bathroom they shared, took hold of his little dick and aimed it into the bowl of the toilet. Something looked strange, his fingers were longer than he remembered, he was actually a little skinier than the night before. Even his tiny member felt different. He finished his business and walked over the mirror in the bedroom. His wide eyed reflection looked back at him. He was still Josh, just not latin Josh. He looked Asian. He was thinner, maybe about ten or fifteen pounds thiner than before, he still had a slight natural tan, but it was different, not like his latino skin. He thought maybe he was Japanese or Korean. Before his hair had been brown and wavy. Now it hung just barely over his eyes, jet black, in a bowl haircut. His eyes and lips had narrowed. His face looked like his old self, but at the same time he looked like a little Asian boy. This is so weird, he thought to himself. <br />
He decided to wake up Ric and tell him about his changes. He shook the little heap of covers and found Ric. Josh let out a gasp as he gazed down at his new older, little brother. Ric no longer had the layer of baby fat he had last night. He was bony now, not unhealthy, but very thin. Ric looked at his brother's face. He could still see his brother in the features, but if he hadn't been the one to wake him up, he might not have believed it. Ric was a tiny black five year old, with a shaved head and a tiny body. &quot;Ric&quot;, Josh whispered, &quot;Ric, Wake up&quot;. Ric looked up to see a strange but familiar Asian boy above him. &quot;Who are you!&quot; he yelped, and dove for the other side of the bed. &quot;I'm Josh, I woke up this morning and looked like this&quot;, he explained. &quot;You should see yourself&quot;, Josh said. Ric ran over to the mirror and took in his new dark little frame, and his shaved head. &quot;Oh my god&quot; he kept murmering it over and over. This is alot harder on Ric, Josh thought to himself. <br />
Josh mangeded to get dressed by rolling up the sleeves and legs of his clothes, and bringing his belt all the way to the last hole. Ric wasn't so lucky, he had on a very loose pair of Josh's underwear, that kept threatening to slip off, he gave up on finding a shirt that fit him, and just crawled into one of his old shirts. It had three buttons at the collar, he did each one, even after that it was still pretty loose around his scrawny neck. He didn't worry about pants or shorts right now, his shirt was long enought that it went down past his knees. <br />
The boys found their way to the kitchen and to meal waiting there for them. Mr. Mendes was at the stove, cooking the last of the pancake batter. He motioned for the boys to sit down. He set down the all the food, and handed the boys each a plate to put their food on.  &quot;Now, I know this has been hard on you boys, probably harder on you, Ric, than on your brother, but it's supposed to be. You have to learn you can't go messing around with other people's bodies.&quot; &quot;Oh&quot; he added &quot;and don't think this is the end of your guys punishment, either.&quot; With that he pulled out the book and recited the end all spell. Josh began to grow first, his eyes widening, and his hair turning lighter. He quickly unrolled his cuffs and the legs of his jeans. He shot up suddenly as his torso and spine grew back to their twelve year old length. He was back in his old body. Ric felt it next. His skin began to tingle and sting just a bit, but that quickly stopped and he watched as his skin got lighter and lighter til it was back to his normal tan. He felt his hair growing back out from his scalp and ran his hand along his head to make sure. He took longer to regain his old height, after a few seconds he could feel the cold hardwood floor with his toes, and then with the rest of his feet. He undid the top button on his shirt and opened up the collar for his thickening neck. His face suddenly cringed, he had forgot about the underwear, they were way to small. He stood up and looked down at himself. The tiny briefs looked more like a bikini on him now. The pouch held his sack and rod tight against his body, he could feel the back of the underwear wedging itself between his ass checks. Ric peeled them off of his body, and stood in the dining room naked from the waist down. He had turned to go back to the room for some boxers and shorts when Mr. Mendes said in a stern voice &quot;sit!&quot;. Ric slowly turned around and sat back down on the wooden chair, the cool wood chilled his butt and and thighs. &quot;Like i said&quot; Mr. Mendes continued, &quot;don't think this is the end of the punishment. I still have a few more ideas&quot;. He opened the book and read out loud an incantation. Both boys felt very aroused suddenly and then the feeling was gone. Mr. Mendes walked over to the cupboard and brought out two glass jars, which he placed on the table. The boys peered inside them, something was taking shape in each jar. Ric let out a moan. He knew what was in there, he also knew why that feeling in his groin had gone away so quickly. Both his and his brother's dicks and balls were floating in those jars.</p>
