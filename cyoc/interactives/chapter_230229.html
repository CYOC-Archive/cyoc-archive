<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah walked in through the doors of her guest room she would be sharing with Aloe&#39;la. Sarah went to the closet to see what her choices of clothing would be for the next day, so she wouldn&#39;t be wearing something that looked like she belonged in a different time period. Aloe&#39;la couldn&#39;t help but notice that the guest bedroom they would be sleeping in only had one bed. She didn&#39;t know whether this one intentional or not, but she was getting a little nervous now sleeping about sleeping next to this woman whom she was crushing on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Sarah immediately shouted loudly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?! What is it?!&quot; Aloe&#39;la said as she spun around with her wings spread out ready for any danger.<br />
<br />
&quot;I just got a text from my deputy director. Jacob Morleand is M.I.A., there&#39;s no word on where the rest of his family are. Damn it, why did I even come here? I should be back out there, up there, whatever! God, I&#39;ve got to go get this situation under control, maybe your fairy queen can arrange a meeting with me another day. I just can&#39;t...&quot; Sarah said as she started towards the door before Aloe&#39;la blocked the way.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing? Let me out of room. Now.&quot; Sarah demanded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know you&#39;re worried Director McMillan, but you&#39;re team is handling the situation the best they can. May I remind you, you&#39;ve established ties with other lords and ladies, you can&#39;t let this incident get in your way of negotiations.&quot; Aloe&#39;la reminded her.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not. But Moreland is important person to not just my team, but also many others working in the magical community and....&quot; Sarah said as she almost shoved Aloe&#39;la through the door before Aloe&#39;la grabbed Sarah by the shoulders and held her against the door behind her and looked her directly in the eye.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not going to let what happened to Breena, happened to you. You&#39;ve got to learn how to relax and trust others to do what you know is best. Please Director McMillan, please, Sarah, I&#39;m begging you. Take a deep breath and take the longer path.&quot; Aloe&#39;la begged as Sarah saw the pleading in Aloe&#39;la&#39;s eyes and took a deep breath before nodding and walking over to their bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. But dealing with the supernatural hasn&#39;t been very easy for me over the last year and a half now. First skin walkers, then vampires, now some group calling themselves the &#39;Normal&#39; think what they&#39;re doing is best those....fascists.&quot; Sarah said as she put her phone down.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know it&#39;s hard....but it will always get better. You just....have to believe in the people you surround yourself with.&quot; Aloe&#39;la said putting a hand on Sarah&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
Aloe&#39;la and Sarah sat in the room silent for a few moments before Sarah again took a few deep breaths and nodded to Aloe&#39;la with a smile indicating she was okay now.<br />
<br />
&quot;By the way, who&#39;s Breena? You mentioned her before when you were stopping me from leaving. I assume she&#39;s also a friend of yours? Definitely a fairy, I&#39;m sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There in lies a bit of a story. See I&#39;m in our fairy military and was taught by Spark&#39;s father, Arion. However, Arion wasn&#39;t my initial mentor, that was Breena. Breena was a fairy who served in the military for fifteen years before I joined and I wanted nothing more than to be trained by her. When I finally joined the military, I was lucky enough to have her as my trainer and I can tell you, the days being trained by her were not easy. Waking up before the sun, going to bed before sunset, but probably the hardest was how she rarely relaxed herself. When she wasn&#39;t training me or another fairy, she would volunteer for battle, then go back to training when she went back. Arion warned her to take a rest every now and then, but Breena was determined to make sure our kingdom was protected and soldiers ready for battle. She sadly didn&#39;t take any note of that.&quot; Aloe&#39;la explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? What ended up happening to her?&quot; Sarah asked intrigued.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her wings became heavily damaged in battle. Queen Glitter herself made her retire from battle and training, she&#39;s still at her house, I&#39;ve visited her from time to time, but she&#39;ll never fly again. She told me if I&#39;m ever stressed out about stuff to take a deep breath and think about two paths in a road ahead of me, a shorter path and a longer path. Most people would take the shorter path, but those who are patient take the longer path, it&#39;s not as quick but it&#39;s easier on you.&quot; Aloe&#39;la explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I get it. Thanks for the story, now how about a story of your own. Why is the top right of your wing missing?&quot; Sarah asked as Aloe&#39;la immediately stood up and walked over to the window and looked outside of it crossing her arms in discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I&#39;m...I&#39;m so sorry. I&#39;ve obviously asked a tender subject.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. I...I don&#39;t really like to discuss it with others, especially humans.&quot; Aloe&#39;la said as Sarah could hear the disdain in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;I get it. In fact, you and I have a little bit more in common than you may think.&quot; Sarah said as she stood up and exposed some of her chest making Aloe&#39;la look away quickly before she looked back thinking she saw something.<br />
<br />
Sarah&#39;s shoulder and part of her chest were exposed so Aloe&#39;la could see what looked like a cut from her right shoulder to the middle of her chest. Aloe&#39;la held out her hand almost touching it, before Sarah concealed the wound again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Working in DHS for years, was never easy, especially when someone decides to bring a knife to a fight and they cut me along there until I managed to knock them back. It gave me goosebumps at first, but now I look at it with a little pride. I survived, and I&#39;m thankful for that.&quot; Sarah explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I was...in the war. Vietnam to be specific, and before you ask, fairies can live long, but our appearances can change depending on...certain circumstances. I know my wing might not make me look as beautiful as others here, but I don&#39;t care.&quot; Aloe&#39;la said.<br />
<br />
&quot;If it&#39;s any consolation, I think you&#39;re still beautiful even with your wing.&quot; Sarah complimented as Aloe&#39;la blushed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Listen, I&#39;ll let you feel my scar, if you let me feel your wing.&quot; Sarah offered. Aloe&#39;la thought for a moment before nodding.<br />
<br />
Aloe&#39;la gently placed her hand on Sarah&#39;s chest as she felt the scar on Sarah&#39;s chest. The wound must&#39;ve gone a little deeper than she thought as she saw Sarah squirm just a little bit. Now it was Sarah&#39;s turn to touch Aloe&#39;la&#39;s wing, she was careful not to damage it any more than it was and put her hand back down. Sarah now looked at Aloe&#39;la and smiled as she smiled back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aloe&#39;la just what is it that can change a fairy&#39;s appearance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They....uh...they may start....developing feelings for someone....and age up or down to that person&#39;s....age.&quot; Aloe&#39;la explained while blushing a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, so....is that what happened to your friend, Spark?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she began developing feelings for Jacob&#39;s son, Connor, and aged down.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I see. So....I&#39;ve noticed you acting a little odd lately. Is it because you&#39;re developing feelings for...me?&quot; Sarah asked as Aloe&#39;la&#39;s entire face went red.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t have to answer me, I won&#39;t tease you or anything. Frankly I didn&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been much of a looker.&quot; Sarah offhandedly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re god damned gorgeous!&quot; Aloe&#39;la shouted covering her mouth as Sarah giggled a little bit.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really thought if I like girls...you know in that way. But maybe that&#39;s just because I&#39;ve had only so little relationships in my life. What is that dance called that determines if fairies like each other?&quot; Sarah asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The rite of spring?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why don&#39;t we try that? It may determine if we actually have feelings for each other or not.&quot; Sarah suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I mean, I can&#39;t...I&#39;ve never really danced without flying before. I was never really one for the rite of spring, I actually avoided it for years.&quot; Aloe&#39;la explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, my mother had me take dance lessons when I was younger, so I&#39;ll show you the moves. Let me just turn on a little music. I heard this cover of that song &#39;dancing queen&#39; by this girl called Eliott last year, it&#39;s a nice song and I always wondered what a slow ballad of it sounded like.&quot; Sarah said as she started the song.<br />
<br />
Sarah offered her hand, which Aloe&#39;la shook her head at, before Sarah gave a gentle smile and slowly took Aloe&#39;la hands and showed her the dance moves she learned. Aloe&#39;la watched Sarah&#39;s feet, her legs, then her hands, and slowly after a few moments, she was looking up into Sarah&#39;s eyes and was smiling at her. Aloe&#39;la had seen Sarah&#39;s fierceness a few days ago, now she saw her tenderness as they slow danced together. Aloe&#39;la could feel her heart beat to the rhythm of the music as she and Sarah looked into each other&#39;s eyes and suddenly stopped. Sarah and Aloe&#39;la moved their faces in closer and kissed each other gently on the lips as Sarah felt Aloe&#39;la strip Sarah&#39;s clothes off her body. Sarah fell backwards on the bed as Aloe&#39;la gently touched Sarah&#39;s body unsure if she should continue until Sarah grabbed Aloe&#39;la&#39;s hand and put it back on her chest as she kissed the scar while Sarah caressed Aloe&#39;las damaged wing making Aloe&#39;la feel giddy as she smiled and they rolled together under the covers of the bed as they kissed the tender spots on each other&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
Once they were done, and they both fell asleep, Aloe&#39;la saw it was one in the morning now, they had talked and made love in only four hours. Aloe&#39;la could hardly believe it as she thought to herself before falling asleep: &#39;I&#39;m actually in love with a human, and she&#39;s perfect.&#39; Then Aloe&#39;la fell asleep with Sarah&#39;s arm wrapped around her head.</p>
