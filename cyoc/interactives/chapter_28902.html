<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><p>Fuming, you stomp your way downtown.
You just can't believe it; your own
parents sold you out! Even if they thought
they were helping you, they didn't ask you
or anything! It's hard to even think
straight, you're so angry. After some
time, you find yourself standing in front
of the mall. You hadn't really had a
destination in mind, but this works,
especially since your stomach is growling.
You head into the food court and order
some Chinese. You'll eat and then walk
to the park; it's not far, and you'll
get there at just about six-thirty.</p>
<p>The food is quite good, stir-fry on
rice. As you're eating, a young man walks
up to your table. "Hey," he says. "Nice
costume."</p>
<p>You spend a moment trying to figure out
what he's talking about, then realize that
he's referring to your ears and tail. "Um,
thanks," you reply.</p>
<p>"It's really good. You make it
yourself?"</p>
<p>You shake your head. "Um, I had some
help from a couple adults at my school."
Not exactly true, but as close to the
truth as he'll probably believe.</p>
<p>"Well, anyway," he says, "really nice
job." You can feel him looking you up and
down even as you stare intently at your
food, but it doesn't seem like he's
leering. Still, leering or no, it's highly
disconcerting to have a guy sizing you
up.</p>
<p>"Listen," he says, "I was gonna go
catch a movie later this evening. There's
a little theater in the other wing. Wanna
come with? I'll buy."</p>
<p>On the list of things you didn't want
to hear from him, that one's pretty high.
Still, it's not his fault that he doesn't
know you were a guy this morning, so you
try to think of a nice way to phrase your
response. "Sorry," you say. "I'm, um, I've
got somewhere to be." Which is true,
although you'll probably be done before he
hits his movie.</p>
<p>He looks a little dejected. "Okay," he
says. "If you change your mind, though,
the offer's still open, um...?"</p>
<p>"...Stephanie." You really hate to use
the name your parents gave their lovely
new daughter, but it's a lot better than
going by Stephen, as far as not arousing
suspicion is concerned.</p>
<p>"Right, Stephanie. My name's Jared.
Here's my cell number," he says, handing
you a slip of paper which you unthinkingly
place in your vest pocket. "If you do
change your mind, give me a call or just
show up at the theater. Either way, it was
nice meeting you."</p>
<p>"Thanks," you say, as he strolls off.
"It was nice to meet you too." You hope
that doesn't encourage him, but you want
to at least be polite. You finish your
meal, then walk to the park.</p>
<p>Katherine and Jennifer are waiting for
you. "Tuition," Katherine says. You nod.
She sighs. "Who would've known my parents
were so easy to bribe?"</p>
<p>"Well," Jennifer says, "in fairness,
they were just thoroughly convinced they
were helping us. Not that it really
changes anything."</p>
<p>You sigh. "Yep. And it sounds like
cutting out isn't an option, either."</p>
<p>Katherine's ear perk up. "Really?"</p>
<p>"Really," you say. "According to my
mom, they're not bringing the equipment
around until the end of the school
year."</p>
<p>"I guess all we can do is get through
this, then," Jennifer sighs.</p>
<p>"Or," Katherine muses, "we could hack
into the school computers, find out where
they're keeping the equipment, and then
stage a daring break-in."</p>
<p>You very nearly laugh. "Sure. IMF,
that's us."</p>
<p>"I'm serious," she says. "I've been
talking with Jennifer, and she seems like
enough of a geek to do the hacking part. I
don't know what kind of luck we'd have
with a break-in, but it's gotta be better
than our chances of getting through a year
of head games unscathed."</p>
<p>Jennifer shakes her head. "I
<i>might</i> be able to get into the
school computers, but there's no way we'd
pull off Phase Two. Even if we did, we'd
get caught when we went back home as our
normal selves, and we'd have broken God
knows how many laws. And our local judge
is a complete nut; she's practically a
militant lesbian. If we wound up in court,
she'd most likely sentence us to multiple
years under this. In short, that's a bad
idea."</p>
<p>Katherine shrugs. "I still say it's
better to try and fail than not to try at
all. Do <i>you</i> think you could live
through this knowing you could've tried to
reverse it?"</p>
<p>Jennifer shrugs. "I think I could
remind myself that it wouldn't have worked
anyway." Both of them seem to be
getting a little hot under the collar.</p>
<p>"Listen," you say. "Let's not argue
about this. Here's what we'll do. We'll
spend the week under this experiment. In
the meantime, Jennifer, you think about
how we would pull off a break-in if we did
attempt it. Katherine, you think about the
potential consequences, especially the
possibility of spending multiple years in
this form. I'll think about both. At the
end of the week, we'll put it to a
vote."</p>
<p>Katherine sighs. "I guess one week
isn't going to permanently scar me.
Okay."</p>
<p>"I'll do what I can," Jennifer
promises. "I still don't think it'll ever
work, but I'll try and draw up a
plan."</p>
<p>"In the meantime," Katherine says, "I
don't feel like going home and the theater
in the mall is doing a 'retro night' where
they're playing a double-bill of
<i>'Manos' The Hands Of Fate</i> and
<i>Prince Of Space.</i> So whaddya say we
catch it?"</p>
<p>"Sounds like a great idea!" Jennifer
smiles. "If there's one thing we need
right now, it's to relax."</p>
<p>You start to protest, but Katherine
shushes you. "No arguments," she says.
"We're all going together." They walk you
back to the mall, hushing you every time
you try to argue. Soon you're standing in
the ticket line. <i>Oh, please,</i> you
think, <i>don't let...</i></p>
<p>"Hey, Stephanie!" a voice calls. You
turn to look, and sure enough, it's Jared.
"Looks like you changed your mind after
all," he says, running up to you. "Like I
said, I'll buy."</p>
<p>Well, this is just <i>great.</i> You
try to think of anice way to tell him you
aren't here to watch the movie with him,
but by the time you tnink of something
he's already bought your ticket. "But,"
you say, "my friends are..."</p>
<p>"Oh, no problem," he smiles. "They can
sit with us."</p>
<p>Katherine and Jennifer look at each
other and begin to snicker. Looks like
you've got yourself a date for the movie.
<i>It could be worse, though,</i> you
think. <i>At least he's pretty
good-looking...for a guy...</i></p>
<p>Wait, did you just think that? No,
that's not what you meant, you reassure
yourself. You were just searching for a
rationalization in case Katherine or
Jennifer said anything.
<i>Obviously.</i></p></p>
