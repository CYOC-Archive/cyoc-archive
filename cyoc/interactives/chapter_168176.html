<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Suddenly Jen&#39;s eyes glazed over. Looking expressionless, with a monotone voice, she begins the curse for Naomi. Naomi of course can&#39;t answer due to the curse on Jen requiring her to pass everything, so she gets both by force. Reading off the list, Jen is internally understanding that this is how she got her tail. <br />
<br />
When she got to the parts where she had to substitute out her dog for something else, she quickly choose herself. Intereeting enough though, this basically made Naomi also recieve traits of Jen&#39;s dog, and would enjoy being fucked by him. Jen&#39;s party apparently is now their party, and now they live together.<br />
<br />
Of course they both are still in love with each other too, it is just that now they will be sharing a dog, with both of them becomming a bitch in his pack. He was going to be their alpha male after tonight. <br />
<br />
Right as she finished reading off the curse, Jen quickly tagged on a bit at the end of her own. &quot;You can also alternatively curse Jen, and make it ok for her to be naked in public, along with yourself.&quot; <br />
<br />
Naomi looked at Jen for a moment some what confused. &quot;Wait a sec, what were we talking about just now? Sorry, I blanked out their for a moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were going to try and use the town curse on me in order to make me able to be naked in public along with yourself&quot; replied Jen. She understood that whoever cursed her, had overlooked that the &quot;pass it on&quot; would conflict with the &quot;forget this conversation&quot;. Now she knew why she had a tail, and why everything smelled so vividly. <br />
<br />
Naomi, choosing to believe her girlfriend, began the curse, making it normal fof the 2 of them to be sometimes naked in public. She liked the idea, it was the perfect amount of kinkiness for her to be able to enjoy it, while not becoming overly cautious and nervous about getting arrested.<br />
<br />
Naomi went to sit down for a moment, when she sat on something that hurt her, and caused her to cry out in pain.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooh, right. Sorry, I forgot to warn you about that&quot; Jen said appologeticly. &quot;You also have a dog tail now, so be careful not to sit on it or get it caught in something because it hurts a lot. I would know since I accidentally closed mine in my bedroom door this morning and nearly broke it. So be thankful all you did was sit on it this time. Wow I really wanted that to sound nicer than it did. Sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t crying like Jen had, and her cry was more out of surprise rather than pain. It honestly didn&#39;t hurt THAT bad,  but it didn&#39;t feel good. It was a similar feeling to having stubbed her finger. <br />
<br />
Standing up, she turned to see her tail, but it moved out of sight. Personally understanding the annoying and slightly embarrassing feeling of trying to chase it, Jen held it gently for her. Unlike Jen&#39;s, Naomi&#39;s tail was pure black fur, matching the color of her hair. <br />
<br />
Looking at her, Jen was getting turned on even more. She began absentmindedly panting with her tongue flopped out of her mouth at how sexy she found tailed Naomi was. It really hit all the right spots for her. Her scent, her tail, her size, the fact that they both now desperately wanted to deliver, feed, and raise numerous litters of his puppies. It just made her so excited and happy for some stranger reason. Even her own tail was wagging happily. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey wait! What ar you Ummmmm. Wow, um. Jen? Uh that is... uhhh! Oh god this feels so gross, uhhh, but also really good! Uhmmm, Jen. UHHHH. Uhhhh. Keep doing that. YES! That lick me there more uhhh.&quot; Moaned Naomi, as Jen began licking her pussy. <br />
<br />
It was a very different feeling that what she was use to. Jen&#39;s tongue was extra moist now that itnwas a dog&#39;s tongue, and she could both reach farther, and cover more area with each pass. Jen didn&#39;t realize just how long her tongue was until she began licking Naomi&#39;s cervix, even slightly entering into her womb with the tip.<br />
<br />
The moment Jen hit her womb, Naomi got down on all fours. Sticking her ass in the air. Jen continued licking her girlfriend&#39;s pussy, intoxicated by her scent and taste. She never tasted her this deep before, and it was exactly as she hoped, really good. By now Naomi was in heaven. Standing on all fours, with her face pointed down left her tongue just nearly touching the floor. If she were to lower her head a bit less than 2 inches, she would touch it. That was just how long their tongues were. But it made sense. Unlike a dog, neither of them had protruding snouts to use up some of its length.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden Naomi felt it. This sudden urge that was both unknown, yet familiar somehow. Too lost in the pleasure, she just went with it and raised her left leg to the side, and began to pee. Jen on the other hand felt her face get blasted with the new liquid. However, instead of moving out of the way, she instead closed her mouth around the stream, drinking it. For some reason, her new tongue really liked the taste, and it smelled so good that she ended up doing this automatically. Even before she realized what it was that she was drinking. Naomi came hard soon after.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god! JEN! Did you seriously just drink all of my pee?&quot; Said a rather taken aback Naomi when she noticed that there was not a puddle of her pee anywhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;It smelled and tasted so good, that I just had to.&quot; Reasoned Jen. Both girls were now just standing on all fours, neither realizing that they didn&#39;t actually stand up how they meant to. Their hands were balled up into fists and both of their tails were raised above them with a slight curl. Plus their legs were standing on their toes,  with their knees raised off of the ground. <br />
<br />
&quot;So what now? We both are kind of a mess now, and I don&#39;t really feel like going to class, nor showing off my new tail to the school.&quot; Asked Naomi. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lets just sneak out and head home durring the next period&#39;s break. We have already been in here for like 2 hours now, so lunch will should be right after the next class.&quot; Proposed Jen. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good, so how do you want to burn the next hour?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We could lick each other at the same time? I&#39;m still super horny.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same. And I want a taste of your womb too. It is only fair since you tasted mine. And maybe I will drink your pee this time if it really is that good.&quot; Further offered Naomi.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uglh, yeah lets agree not to say it, and just do it from now on. It sounds way worse than it is.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>
