<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It roared at Corbin, the sound nearly deafening him. Suddenly it pounced towards him at incredible speed, Corbin was just able to jump to the side. The creature fell to the ground, shaking the platform they were on. It reached for Corbin, however he evaded jumping backwards to make some distance. He had no ranged weapons, he only has his trusty Morning Star. So he ran towards the creature, and rolled around its legs to swing at the back of it&#39;s feet.<br />
<br />
The blow was heavy, nearly sending the creature on top of Corbin, however it picked itself up and bellowed angrily. The creature spun around and grabbed at Corbin, he narrowly avoided this one, rolling away again. He again hit the creature in the feet, however this had no effect on the creature. The hide was too thick. Instead the creature kicked Corbin straight in the chest. He went spiralling backwards and felt excruciating pain in his back as he collided with something hard. It was the cell, the iron was nearly dented by how strong the impact was. <br />
<br />
Corbin&#39;s vision was hazy as the creature stormed towards him. This time there was no dodging its lurch forwards as it grabbed at Corbin. It felt like he was being crushed as the behemoth lifted him up to eye level. Its blood red eyes were more visible to Corbin now, they were more intense than he realised. The arm was shaking violently, Corbin could only do one thing. He pulled out a slim dagger inside his pocket and, through the crushing, stabbed the Minotaurs hand. It cried out, Corbin held onto the hand, trying to get to a better weakpoint.<br />
<br />
He climbed the hand and ran up the arm. Suddenly the minotaur shook it&#39;s right arm with determination, nearly throwing Corbin to his likely death, however he held onto the thick hide and looked around for a weak point when the minotaur get tired. It was hard to keep hold due to the constantly shaking muscles however he found it. The weakpoint was the device on the minotaurs heart. If Corbin could destroy it, there would be nothing stopping the Minotaur&#39;s transformation.<br />
<br />
Corbin jumped from the arm to the chest, he could fear the Minotaurs enourmous pecs, vibrate against him. It felt good but he couldn&#39;t stop here. Corbin climbed the minotaurs chest and grabbed hold of the heart device. Immediately though he felt pain erupt through his body, which nearly made him let go. Just like with the creature, his muscles started to shake violently. He could feel his massive mass erupt like lightning, the feeling was incredible. Corbin pulled as hard as he could on one of the wires which penetrated the Minotaur&#39;s thick hide, slowly he pulled the wire out revealing a layer of minotaur blood on it. The creature erupted in pain and shook his chest violently. However it seemed that by Corbin grabbing hold the heart device the creature was now paralyzed from the neck down. <br />
<br />
He rushed towards the second wire, he felt the electricty pulse through his body. His dick was getting hard, Corbin didn&#39;t know how much longer he could take this sensation. He pulled hard at the second wire, and watched as it flailed out the minotaurs chest, blood spilling from the hole. The final wire was above Corbin, he threw himself up briefly letting go of the heart device. This was a mistake though, as he felt his body burn like crazy. As soon as the sensation left his body, he felt pain from every nerve. For a second he let go of the Minotaur hide and fell down. He grabbed hold of the minotaurs massive pec&#39;s and was able to hold on.<br />
<br />
The creature however had gained control of it&#39;s body, grabbing a hold of Corbin. Again he felt like he was being crushed as he was pulled to the Minotaurs face, this time he roared directly at Corbin, briefly deafening him. Suddenly he was thrown against the chest of the creature. On top of the heart device. Corbin was surprised, but didn&#39;t stop for a second. He grabbed at the last wire and pulled it out, allowing the device to be let free of the host. <br />
<br />
The creature&#39;s chest burst forwards, throwing Corbin off the giant. He landed heavily, feeling pain rush against his back and his head. However he was alive. <br />
<br />
The behemoth cried out, its entire body contorting and expanding. The creature&#39;s shoulders cracked and widened, the biceps ballooned outwards. All his muscles and his figure was enlarging. The creature moaned loudly, its dick flailing and strengthening.<br />
<br />
&quot;YESSS!&quot; The creature cried out, its figure now violently exploding out in proportions. To Corbin&#39;s horror the platform he was on was starting to crack under the creatures weight. He looked around for a way out but found none. Suddenly the platform tilted under the creatures seemingly impossible weight and Corbin watched as it was thrown into the abyss below. The platform continued tilting though, Corbin grabbed hold of the loose tile which started this whole mess, the structure was now completely vertical with the cage falling into the abyss too.<br />
<br />
The tile he was holding on to, suddenly cracked. And with him it fell into the abyss....</p>
