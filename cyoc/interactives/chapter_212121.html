<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ethan sat back a bit in relief at having averted what was likely a challenging reality for Alyssa, and happy to have given both Jerry and her a chance at a fresh start at 13 years and 10 months old and just beginning to test the waters of dating and sexuality. Ethan watched as the apartment around them shifted, Jerry&#39;s room seemed to shrink and the decor shifted from one a man in his early thirties might have to that which a young teenage boy would. Posters of his favorite TV shows appeared along with a framed collection of baseball cards and a few old little league and traveling team trophies. A desk stacked with school books, a desk lamp, and a backpack also shuttered into existence, the desk chair acting as a place for Jerry to hang his well-worn baseball glove over the left nub at the top of the chair, while the right held his cleats whose laces were tied together and throwing over the back of the chair, and the desk supporting a leaning metal baseball bat.  Jerry&#39;s discarded clothes on the floor also shifted to what was likely his new &quot;style&quot;, as did Alyssa&#39;s discarded clothes on the floor. The bed shrank from a full-sized bed to a twin-sized mattress, the sheets on it shifting to what looked to be a far cheaper thread count than what had been on there before.<br />
<br />
The changes however weren&#39;t just to Jerry&#39;s room however as the rest of the apartment shifted as well. As Jerry&#39;s bedroom went from being the master bedroom to a smaller one, another room had turned into the master bedroom. The apartment shifted from looking like a bachelor pad to one where a family lived together. Curious that a family portrait appeared on one of the walls, Ethan zoomed in and was surprised to see what looked to be a photo a year or two &quot;out of date&quot; as it were as Jerry looked more a child than teen in the rather stiff-looking family photo, of Jerry being the only child of Chris, who Ethan remembered vaguely as the Head of the... Marketing Department? Ethan tried to remember what he could of Chris from his earlier memories of the man, and Chris had been a 38 year old  bachelor as far as Ethan could remember who hadn&#39;t seemed in any hurry to settle down--now in this new reality it seems Jerry was his son from what appeared to be either a one-night stand or an early marriage that had long since ended in divorce as there was no mother in the portrait of father and son.<br />
<br />
In fact, looking at the two, Ethan was surprised that he hadn&#39;t noticed before how much Jerry and Chris did resemble each other. Curious, Ethan scrolled through a tab entitled &quot;Relationships&quot; under Jerry and found that apparently before the change Chris had been a cousin of Jerry&#39;s. Apparently a distant fifth cousin whose shared common ancestors had died over a century ago, but related nevertheless, and related enough that Chris being Jerry&#39;s father (or father to a kid who resembled Jerry) in an alternate reality wasn&#39;t completely out of the realm of possibility in whatever laws of the multi-verse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh... interesting... wait... oh, no...&quot; said Ethan to himself as he perused the changes to Jerry&#39;s relationships prior. That also meant that Chris had been the guy who in the reality where Alyssa had gotten pregnant with Jerry, hadn&#39;t wanted to support her or the child. To confirm his suspicion Ethan zoomed in on other photos to find that beyond the one expected family portrait, that the photos on the wall were more of Chris with various people--family, friends, and occasionally Jerry would be included on the periphery of the photo if it appeared Chris&#39; parents were in the photo. These photos were only confirming Ethan&#39;s growing suspicions.<br />
<br />
&quot;d-Do you want to keep going?&quot; asked Jerry nervously as he and Alyssa sat naked next to each other on Jerry&#39;s bed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but what about your dad?&quot; asked Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;He never gets home this early,&quot; said Jerry with what looked to be a resigned look on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s almost nine o&#39;clock. How late does he get home?&quot; asked Alyssa, her questions seeming to take her momentarily out of the mood to experiment and explore.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not till almost midnight,&quot; answered Jerry as though it weren&#39;t out of the ordinary, but not without some bitterness.<br />
<br />
That answer seemed to cause Alyssa&#39;s heart to melt as she pulled the blond teen closer to her into a hug, which at first took Jerry by surprise, before he eased into the affection as though he weren&#39;t all too accustomed to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit... I might have made Alyssa&#39;s life a bit easier, but now I&#39;ve screwed Jerry&#39;s up... and it seems it didn&#39;t solve the issue of Chris being an asshole, it just changed who he was being an asshole to... fuck,&quot; said Ethan as he contemplated how to fix this situation.<br />
<br />
What was even worse though was that Ethan now noticed someone was entering the apartment. He zoomed over and saw it was Chris, and he looked clearly drunk and was bringing his own drunken brunette date named Lola into the house with him. And unbeknownst to Jerry and Alyssa, Alyssa&#39;s bag and coat were clearly visible on the couch in the living room--both of which couldn&#39;t be mistaken for Jerry&#39;s as they were clearly the coat and bag of a teenage girl.<br />
<br />
Chris and Lola however didn&#39;t immediately notice the coat and bag as they were too busy whispering to one another and making out in the extremely small excuse for a foyer that the apartment had before opening up into the living area which housed the couch, a chair, a wall-mounted TV, and a TV stand with various television accoutrements like a bluray player, an old XBox that looked more like something Chris had owned when younger than something bought for Jerry, and a Roku. Chris however didn&#39;t remain oblivious for long as Lola took note of the bag and jacket.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t know you had a daughter...&quot; said Lola casually. This confused Chris, whose memories of having a child and not being a bachelor were only now filtering into his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I have a... son?&quot; said Chris as he broke away from Lola, rubbing his temples as a few extra greys from the stress of raising Jerry alone over the years appeared on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it looks like the apple doesn&#39;t fall far from the tree,&quot; said Lola.<br />
<br />
It seemed to take Chris a moment to process that information before he took on a rather pissed look.<br />
<br />
&quot;They better just be kissing,&quot; grumbled Chris as he now approached his teenage son&#39;s room and opened it without knocking only to find Alyssa and Jerry in the middle of a kiss which ended a few moments after the door burst open and Jerry flinched backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; exclaimed Jerry with enough shock that his almost settled voice squealed when he said it.<br />
<br />
Chris glared at Jerry, whose petrified reaction said everything and more. Chris then turned to Alyssa and said rather quietly, &quot;Call your parents, get dressed, and collect your things.&quot;<br />
<br />
Without another word needing to be said, Alyssa scrambled off the bed, gathered her clothes and hurried out of the room only to squeal herself at running straight into the rather womanly Lola. Alyssa attempted but failed to use her clothes to try and cover herself up. Lola for her part seemed to take pity on Alyssa.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you need help?&quot; asked Lola<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m f--fine, thank you,&quot; said Alyssa before scurrying into the bathroom herself, the door locking behind her.<br />
<br />
Chris meanwhile had maintained his glare at the rather resigned looking Jerry all through that, but the conversation between Alyssa and Lola seemed to jar him out of the thousand yard stare. Jerry simply kept his eyes down and didn&#39;t move, not even to cover himself up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for all this. Teenagers and their hormones, ya know...&quot; said Chris with an affected smile that Lola easily saw through.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it looks like slugger&#39;s already well on his way to be like his old man,&quot; said Lola pointedly.<br />
<br />
Chris gave a half-hearted attempt at a laugh, but it was clear that from all of this that his original plans of scoring with Lola tonight were now completely undone. <br />
<br />
Chris turned to bark at his son, &quot;Get dressed and get ready to say goodbye to your... guest.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan was shocked at the amount of drama that was palpable in the apartment on his screen, and really feeling worse for having made things even worse. He had to fix this... now!</p>
