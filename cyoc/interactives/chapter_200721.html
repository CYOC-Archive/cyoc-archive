<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“How was the walk?” Clint waved at Rosco and Troy as they walked past him into the apartment. Clint had fired up his grill and was making steaks. Rosco whined but didn’t tug Troy closer.<br />
<br />
“Steaks? I thought….&quot; Troy trailed off.<br />
<br />
“That I’m an herbivore? Nah, half human, my man.” Clint bent his muscular forearm forward and with a finger pulled his lips back. His front teeth were all horse, but his molars were human. “Perfectly capable of chewing up a steak.”<br />
<br />
“Doesn’t it feel…weird coming back up?”<br />
<br />
Clint blinked and stared. “I-I’m not a cowman, Troy. I don’t have cud.”<br />
<br />
“Oh.” Troy flushed red. “Can you keep an eye on Rosco for me? I’ll be right back.” <br />
<br />
Clint grinned. “Man, of course. He’s so well behaved, isn’t he?” He directed the grin at Rosco, whose tail began to wag. <br />
<br />
“Thanks” Troy said, and practically flew into his apartment. He had to try something and he only had a few minutes to do it. First thing to try was his noise canceling headphones. He grabbed his headphones from his room, pulled them on, and went to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
“Half.” He commanded, concentrating on himself in the mirror, the Book of Beasts clasped tightly in his hand. He couldn’t hear his own voice and quietly wished for success. The alternative was much riskier.<br />
<br />
Instantly, change rippled through him-his muscles bulged and relaxed tensing and releasing, each time growing a millimeter, the clenches as tense as the releases were pleasurable. The small gut he had from far too many night eating fast food stayed, much to his chagrin, but his tummy seemed to round and tighten bit more into a musclegut. His arms, legs, butt-every muscle slowly rose and bulged., the feeling leaving him gasping. <br />
<br />
His back arched into a stretch and the pleasure doubled as his spine popped and lengthened, extending down and up, leaving him almost a foot taller. His spine extended past his tailbone almost three feet, each half foot punctuated by another pleasurable pop, forcing him forward to the mirror. His hand clenched and popped next as he gripped the bathroom counter, becoming wider, stronger, tendons popping as his nails extended into claws.<br />
<br />
Finally, as his skin prickled and sweeping waves of orange and black striped fur covered his body, he felt his head crunch-less pleasurable, more like clearing a very stuffy nose. As his muzzle pressed out and his nose pinkened and widened, smells entered his nostrils. The scent of bathroom cleaner and urine and his own familiar scent became clear, along with the faintest hint of mildew and mold. <br />
<br />
The last caused his growing whiskers to twitch and his blackening lips to wrinkle back from his sharpening fangs in disgust. He had little time to contemplate the smell as his eyes began to shift and change colors and the entire world seemed to change-with his whiskers, his sense of smell, and his enhanced vision, everything seemed brighter and more…more real, he decided.<br />
<br />
And then his pants and shirt ripped. Troy blinked his newly green and slitted eyes and looked down at himself. His clothes strained tightly around him, practically clinging to the hills and valley of his pecs and well-muscled thighs. And between his thighs bobbed a slightly barbed pink tiger cock. The pleasure he felt began to build as his testicles swelled in the soft white fur that grew in around them, going form grape sized to tennis ball size, his cock stretching farther as he got impossibly harder. <br />
<br />
A bone, Troy realized, I have a bone in my penis-<br />
<br />
His balls tensed and rose as the realization came to him. A handsome tiger stud stared at him in the mirror, panting, the smell of his own musk wafting into his nostrils, sending his whiskers into a frenzy. His grip on the sink tightened, the cheap wood cracking and buckling as he came to a sudden realization-<br />
<br />
He was a fucking hot tigerman.<br />
<br />
Then he came, his hips bucking into the hands-free orgasm, cum splattering his sink in an arch. Shot after shot, hips synced in perfect rhythm and his tail lashing the back of his legs in ecstacy, he plastered his own reflection in the mirror with thick tiger cum.<br />
<br />
“Ah..ah..ah…fuck.” Troy purred and released his grip on the counter.<br />
<br />
 He stumbled back into his room and collapsed on his bed. The weirdest part, he realized, was that his clothes hadn’t changed to fit his new form.<br />
<br />
Wait. Did that mean…<br />
<br />
Troy rushed to his closet. All of his clothes were still human sized. He gave a surprisingly deep and throaty moan and rushed to his wet erase board and quickly scribbled:<br />
<br />
DO YOU SEE A DIFFERENCE?<br />
<br />
And hurried to the front door. He opened it a crack, enough to alert Rosco, sprawled on the ground and enjoying a belly rub from a grinning Clint. Rosco cocked his head and looked at the board that Troy gingerly extended.<br />
<br />
Rosco barked once.<br />
<br />
Troy slammed the door shut.<br />
<br />
“GODDAMIT!” He roared at the ceiling.</p>
