<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Their morning had been fairly active, even after breakfast, but William and Martha did manage to get to the shower, where they proceeded to have more fun. However, they both did get clean and managed to make their way out of the shower before they ran out of hot water to use. They found that it was before noon as they began drying off and went about dressing for the day and both found themselves quite content with things and how their lives had changed since their move to Moon Lake.<br />
<br />
&quot;This has been a great new start,&quot; William mused as he slipped on a pair of shorts while looking over his shoulder to watch Martha put on her bra, which looked rather lacy and new. It fit her new and generous curves quite well, and he figured he&#39;d have fun taking that off of her later, but they both had things to work on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha smiled, knowing that she was giving her husband quite the show, &quot;even with everything... moving here has proved to be the best decision we&#39;ve ever made...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;More like the luckiest thing to happen given everything,&quot; William commented, &quot;but I won&#39;t be complaining.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded as put on an old skirt. It normally hung loosely over her hips and came halfway down her leg, but between her wider hips, bigger butt, and longer legs as a werecat, even in her human form, it was a bit tighter. Not too tight so that she couldn&#39;t wear it, but obviously fitting her a bit differently. The slight scent of arousal from William indicated that he had no problems with how it fit her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Martha smiled and went into the closet and picked out a shirt, &quot;a great new start... and will get better...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; William agreed as Martha emerged from the closet wearing a nice blouse, &quot;you&#39;ll teach again and our family has found happiness... and by that more than just us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded. She moved to pick up her study guides from a nightstand by her side of the bed as she thought over so many of the other good things that had happened. Nate was practically in his element with the fact that most of Moon Lake&#39;s population were weres of some kind, now including the entire Anderson family. She knew that Nate had also found love and that Alex seemed like a nice enough boy be with. If things played out, she hoped Nate would be happy. The bigger thing that filled Martha with both joy and nervousness was Eric&#39;s relationship with Julie. He had been shy and recovering from bullying issues back in Minnesota and both William and Martha had hoped for something to get Eric to come out of his proverbial shell.<br />
<br />
Eric&#39;s meeting Julie Stovall seemed to fit well with that. At first, Martha had hoped Julie would bring Eric out of his shell and let him adapt to a more social lifestyle beyond what was just on internet forums, but things moved beyond that and quickly. Their youngest not only came out of his shell, but fell deeply in love and had become a weremer just to be with Julie. While the speed of it raised the potential for nervousness, Martha couldn&#39;t fully describe how happy she was to see her youngest happy and adapting so well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things will all go well,&quot; Martha commented with a smile as the two of them prepared to leave their bedroom.<br />
<br />
As they reached the door, William looked back over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s nearly noon,&quot; William stated plainly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it?&quot; Martha wondered, &quot;time flies when you&#39;re having fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m sure there will be time for more tonight,&quot; William nodded, &quot;but we both have things to do to be ready for the week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can just go with some leftovers,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter which...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; William asked as they made it to the stairs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;ll clear out the fridge and let us get some things ready Wednesday and what&#39;ll be Eric&#39;s welcome to were-society party when Mr. Stovall returns,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; William said slowly. He didn&#39;t think finishing leftovers was that necessary, but it probably wasn&#39;t worth fighting over.<br />
<br />
Martha casually followed him downstairs but moved into the family room while William headed to the kitchen to get started on warming up lunch. Wanting to check the news before resuming her studies, Martha turned the television on and switched over to one of the local channels and caught the end of a report. It revealed a reporter with a picture of Washington State with Seattle&#39;s location pinpointed on the map.<br />
<br />
&quot;While the FBI and the Seattle Police have stated they believe the tail was a costume,&quot; the reporter spoke, &quot;no one has yet found this costume piece and some may question whether the suspect in question was even human based on the body camera footage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha then watched as screen then showed one of the body camera shots of what looked like a man growing a rat&#39;s tail after being shot. Martha watched with some surprise and then nervousness as her mind recognized that the man in question was a wererat. She didn&#39;t know that the wererat in question was the murderer of Jeff Decker, her new pride mate, Jen Decker&#39;s, husband, but her mind carried some nervousness on the issue regarding weres being exposed and losing all of the happiness the Anderson family had gained by coming to Moon Lake and becoming weres.<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Martha wasn&#39;t the only who had seen the report. Next door, the Twists had finished breakfast and Ben took Kenya home, leaving Frances and Samantha to try and relax.  They had hoped for a quiet weekend where they wouldn&#39;t have a lot of business matters to attend to. Between Yvette Smith&#39;s antics, the coming Jenkins/Harper wedding, and other issues, it felt as though neither werecat had gotten the nice calm weekend to either be with friends or simply enjoy each others company. They had hoped for some peace and quiet, which this report effectively killed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... that&#39;s just great,&quot; Samantha grumbled as she got up and was soon rushing to get her purse and to be ready to go into work.<br />
<br />
&quot;They haven&#39;t exposed weres,&quot; Frances commented, trying to sound hopeful.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yet,&quot; Samantha answered, &quot;and if that happens... and with Martin out with his family emergency...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to be ready,&quot; Frances nodded, &quot;do you think it&#39;ll work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The city plan for the case that weres are exposed? Or if normals find out about Moon Lake?&quot; Samantha asked back, &quot;I suppose... much of it is purely theoretical and implementing it will depend on what&#39;s been reported so far.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand,&quot; Frances said with a weak smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, honey,&quot; Samantha said to her wife as she straightened her own attire and shouldered her purse.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Frances assured her, &quot;hopefully things turn out well and there is no trouble, but it&#39;s always best to be ready for the case that things don&#39;t work out.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Frances then came forward and kissed Samantha on the cheek.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you know I will always have faith in you,&quot; Frances said to her wife, which did bring a small smile to Samantha&#39;s face.</p>
