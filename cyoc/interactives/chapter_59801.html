<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As the sun beam tingled on her skin, Kim felt the mobility return little by little to her frozen form.  She could feel the loosening of her joints.  Her muscles still weak and unresponsive, it felt as if she were going to slump right out of the wheelchair.  The handsome doctor would return to find a limp, plastic doll sprawled across the floor.  Kim tensed her aching body to remain upright and dignified.  She was not about to let the doctor think she was some helpless slouch.  Slowly she felt the strength return to her muscles and that fear passed.  It was easier to remain seated and relaxed.  Kim was confident that she could move again but she held her position a while longer.  His palm print still lingered on her knee.  If she moved, even the tiniest bit, the feeling would be lost.  So Kim sat and let the sun tease her rigid skin.<br />
<br />
Unblinking, she let her eyes defocus on shiny patches of her body and let the world dissolve into dream.  She felt delicious.  Kim could not remember another time when she felt this good in her own body.  It was funny to think that she needed to have her whole body so dramatically changed to feel this good.  Kim did not even know what she looked like right now.  She suspected that she was completely bald.  Her body hair had been eaten away by the little machines in the oil.  The entire surface of her skin re-engineered to become the skin of a thing, not of a human.  She was on her way to becoming a two-wheeled vehicle.  The simple fact that at this moment she still retained a human form was because she had passed only one stage of her transformation.  Kim was shocked that she was not more disturbed by feeling so good about becoming a thing.<br />
<br />
In fact, she felt sexy, thrilled and horny.  Her body was singing in the sun.  She wanted to play with herself right now.  This could be the last time for months on end that she would be able to play.  The last orgasm before the long hiatus of mindless servitude.  Would being a bike be as much fun as thought it would?  Kim feared that she might not feel anything for the next eight months.  What if she could not see, or hear, or feel?  Spending the next eight months alone in her own head might be too much for Kim to bare.  She should at least have the memories of her last amazing moments of being mostly human to dwell on.<br />
<br />
Kim could feel her cheeks flush with heat the way they always did when she was excited.  Kim wondered if she could see them turn red under the flawless gloss of her skin.  She wondered if the doctor would notice them when he returned.  His smooth touch on her knee pulsed in her mind and she wanted to take it as more than what it was.  His caress had been a subtle way of letting her know that he liked her as more than a charge.  As more than just one of many people who had become so many other objects.  Kim wanted him to do something unexpected.  He would return and find her obediently sitting in the same place.  He would decide to risk everything for her.  He would take her from here and make her into his own little plaything and would care for Kim.  She wanted the doctor to do this so that she did not have to deal with figuring out what she was going to think about for eight months.  So she would not have to think about what to do after that was over.  Kim just wanted to be able to sit in the sun and feel the way that it made her skin feel right now for as long as she wanted.<br />
<br />
Her hand left the arm rest of the chair.  The arm sluggishly shifted it into her lap.  The fingers curled and explored.  Kim knew where she was feeling for but could not find it.  Under her skin she could feel where the knot of nerves lay.  Her usual access was missing.  The folds of skin where there but the slit was missing.  It was gone.  Closed up tight and her round fingers were unable to find anyway in.  She almost whimpered.  She almost cried out in loss and frustration.  Rubbing the mound seemed to have no effect.  But the longing in her nerves seemed to rise as she tried.  The more she wanted to take care of her needs the more the need seemed to grow and her options were limited.<br />
<br />
Her hand relaxed.  Her arm shifted back to the rest.  No other part of her body had moved.  Kim still stared into the middle ground with almost unfocused eyes.  It will have to wait, she thought silently.<br />
<br />
There was a tap on the back of her neck.<br />
<br />
Kim jumped to a full and stiff position.  She turned her head slightly as a figure passed quickly to her front.  She followed with her eyes and found the cut doctor again crouching before her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Miss, Kim?&quot; he asked kindly.  A smile played over his face.  &quot;I'm sorry to have startled you but it is the best way to tell if someone is fully charged.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kim must have been able to make a startle look because he continued before she could speak.<br />
<br />
&quot;When a person sits still for so long they tend to resist wanting to move at all.  Your response tells me that we can continue with your transformation.  Are you ready?&quot;<br />
<br />
For the first time since she had been strained from the oil-bath Kim found the desire to try and talk.  &quot;How do I look to you, Doctor?&quot; she asked.  Her voice was calm and clear.  It had not been changed at all.  Kim was a little disappointed by that fact.<br />
<br />
&quot;Naturally you must be interested in your change, I'm sure,&quot; he said.  &quot;Do not worry about that.  Now the next stage will be internal changes.  Now that you can receive energy directly from the sun we will be shutting down your digestive track.  Also your respiration and heart rate will be slowed a great deal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Doctor.  Do you like the way I look?&quot; Kim interrupted.  She did not really want to hear all the details of the changes.  The only thing that mattered to her was the doctor.  She needed to know before it was too late if he would be there for her.  If he would take care of her every need.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kim, you look well.  The procedure is nothing to be afraid of.  We have done it many hundreds of times.  We do not allow mirrors in this area because we found that patients do not always deal well with transitional states.  Seeing themselves not completely human has detrimental psychological effects.&quot;  He smiled again and almost made eye-contact with Kim but his eyes focused on her right cheek and it slide away quickly.  As he talked his eyes drifted around her body and fell on the computer he was holding.  &quot;Naturally at the same time your skeletal structure with be adjusted and modified a little.  Some bones will be made flexible and joints will be slipped to place you into your new form.  The muscles will be adjusted to allow you take on your final form.  And some mass will have to be shifted about your body.&quot;<br />
<br />
He did not love her, Kim decided.  He could barely even look at her.  Kim felt a crashing embarrassment wash through her body.  She had almost asked this professional if he thought she was hot and sexy.  She did not realize that he had seen many people in her state.  He was the mechanic and she the one-cylinder engine that needed an oil-change.  She did not even have the ability to have sex at the moment.  She wanted to cry.  But still her body was tingling all over from the sun light.  Her cheeks were still flush.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be sedated for the next day or so while these changes are made.  When you awake your body will feel very odd.  Don't panic.  Everything will be normal.  Then you will be fitted into the final form and accessorized.  Put out again and the second time you awake you will be an electric bi-cycle.  Ready to start work.&quot;<br />
<br />
The doctor smiled still and dug something out of his pocket.  Kim let him hold the small mask over her face.  She looked him right in his face as the vapors invaded her nose and put her too sleep once again.  Her eyes seeking some emotion from the doctor besides complete, professional detachment.  Kim wanted something to take with her for the eight months she would spend in a body entirely un-human-like.  The doctor gave nothing away.  And Kim, her body almost vibrating with desire, felt the world fade to black even if her eyes could not shut out the light.  She would take nothing but her need to be human with her.</p>
