<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This and the next few chapters may back track slightly from &quot;Moon Lake, Tad: Confirmations&quot; as it skipped over at lot of evening events until 1 AM...</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The walk up to the movie theater was quiet and at least along the route that Tad and Amy walked on there seemed to be few signs of any major &quot;distress.&quot; To a certain extent, that was a good thing, as so much of Moon Lake had been thrown for a loop by the whole decision to reveal the existence of weres to the world. For even without the reveal being made yet, there had appeared to have been some fights and riots over the whole issue that had exploded and had everyone uneasy. Amy had even said a few days ago that her own parents were of different opinions on the whole matter. Tad knew that would present some trouble, particularly if the plan went through, and without direct access to the plan, supporters on either side couldn&#39;t say precisely what it would and would not do.<br />
<br />
Tad also had his worries about his best friend from before he moved to Moon Lake. The Ross family had come into Moon Lake after this planned reveal had been announced and would have to go through likely the surprise of learning that weres exist and that one of their family members, at least, would HAVE to become a were, and then deal with the bigger issue that came from the reveal. Thankfully the Ross family seemed to be openly supportive of weres in a way that Tad had never expected. His mother and father had always taught him to be careful to keep the fact that his parents were weres and that he himself was a were, just in case the response was negative. And outside of places like Moon Lake, that was especially important. But the fact that the Ross family responded so positively to things, it gave Tad some hope that the positive thinking he&#39;d seen in other places was more widespread than what many in Moon Lake thought. That might hopefully let the reveal go well, though on that they&#39;d have to wait to see what happened when the reveal was made.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hope the movie is good,&quot; Amy said from beside him as they walked along and snapping Tad from his thoughts for a few moments.<br />
<br />
He smiled and nodded as he looked over to the female werewolf that walked beside him. Seeing her there was enough to bring a bit of a dopey grin to Tad&#39;s face, as Amy Howler was someone that in many ways he&#39;d never been able to really be with. He&#39;d had girlfriends and &quot;dates&quot; before, but between his father&#39;s military career and that he was a werewolf, those relations had always been guarded. The reveal might change certain things of that nature in the future, but for the moment the thing that Tad most enjoyed was being able to enjoy the hear and now. The fellow werewolf filled that out very well and had taught him well about things that related to Moon Lake, something that Tad needed, in a way, since he&#39;d never been in Moon Lake until just before Halloween. The Mandatory Were Law didn&#39;t apply as he and his mother were already weres, but adjusting to a place where weres could be more open was new and Amy happily helped. In some ways, a part of Tad wanted to spend his life with the athletic and kind female.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully... though my mom has said that the theater here always runs a bit behind what would be advertised on television for new releases,&quot; Tad commented, &quot;unless they&#39;ve upgraded something after my mom and dad left Moon Lake...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... your mom&#39;s memory is pretty accurate,&quot; Amy gave chuckle and a playful punch at Tad&#39;s shoulder as they made their way through town.<br />
<br />
They eventually turned up on the first circular road that made up Moon Lake&#39;s central hub. The immediate area was not deep enough into the center of town and the park that was there, and they walked through a portion of the neighborhood that looked older than the area on the outer &quot;spokes&quot; where Tad and his mother lived and where the Howlers lived, almost exactly across the street from them. It was a reminder on the age of Moon Lake that Tad had come to recognize. That was something that reminded Tad on some of the bigger issues that were presently overshadowing Moon Lake in general at the present time. Weres that had felt safe in Moon Lake for centuries wouldn&#39;t want things to change, often for the same reasons Tad remembered his parents telling him to be careful with his identity as a werewolf as they moved from Marine base to Marine base. The fear was reasonable, but in seeing how well the Ross family responded and having seen much of the country, Tad had some sense that the fear was based more on dated information than anything else. In this, it became more a question of paranoia than playing it safe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... hopefully it is a good movie,&quot; Tad commented as he glanced to the western horizon where the sun had only just set, &quot;and will give us some time for things to do later... Catch what leftovers your parents left or mine...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your mom and Claire, you mean,&quot; Amy corrected.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m pretty sure mom will end up marrying Claire,&quot; Tad commented as they crossed the street onto the north side of Main Street and then turned east, &quot;I mean... she was a bit broken when Ulysses started all this trouble for us by killing my dad, and there were times where I think my mom was only holding it together for me. But with Ulysses now dead and her finding Claire... it&#39;s like she&#39;s had real joy again. Now... it may take her longer to accept any sexual desire for other males... but as a bi-sexual werecat, that will happen eventually. Right now, I&#39;m happy that my mom is happy again and I hope that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That what?&quot; Amy batted her eyes at him, mostly to tease Tad a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;That things work out between you and me... that we have real love bloom, and eventually, likely after college, we get into the big decisions,&quot; Tad said with a slight blush, &quot;and I&#39;m not talking about careers...&quot;<br />
<br />
Amy only patted his hand for a moment as Tad reached for it as they began to approach the doors to the movie theater, moving past the burlesque theater that was next to it. Tad looked rather cute when he blushed, and it was something Amy liked very much, partially because it was so different from how many weres normally behaved. Regardless of whether they were born weres or became weres, whether they had grown up in Moon Lake all their lives or came from outside the town, Moon Lake&#39;s residents always seemed to behave in similar ways. Amy knew that she was no exception to this. Sex was something to be looked forward to for most weres and once a were had their first transformation, parents found themselves having a hard time keeping teenagers from being teenagers. Yet, Tad, despite being a born werewolf was more restrained, despite Amy&#39;s best efforts to get him to be more open on some things. While she&#39;d succeeded in some ways, and ways that Amy very much enjoyed, Tad still remained very similar to where he was in many respects to how and when he first arrived. And Amy very much liked that.<br />
<br />
On reaching the doorway, they found the board and the movie that would be listed for the time period coming up. The pair of them were on time for the movie, but in falling into what went on with the Moon Lake movie theater, some things were rather different. They showed all kinds of movies, and often many of the same sorts of movies that were in other theaters, if often a bit delayed, but the big thing was that the Moon Lake theater was largely improvised from an old standard theater. This meant that they could only show one movie at a time and they would run from late morning or early afternoon till about midnight before they closed. This meant that while the theater had a wide variety of movies, they were shown in rotation and often if one was looking to see a particular one, they&#39;d really have to plan ahead. Those just looking for a movie were often out of luck. And this was something that the two werewolves ran into in that the movie that was to be shown was more of some sci-fi adventure movie and wasn&#39;t necessarily a great &quot;date movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you want to go in...?&quot; Tad asked slowly, &quot;I mean... I&#39;m good with a lot of science fiction... That&#39;s actually set up some of the best video games out there... like Halo... and stuff like that... but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... I&#39;m fine with it,&quot; Amy answered, &quot;and in a way, going out to a movie is a bit of a treat, especially considering the prices. And since neither of us own a car... might as well see this movie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So long as you&#39;re happy,&quot; Tad said to her as they went through the doors to approach the ticket taker.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think that so long as we&#39;re together... I&#39;ll be happy,&quot; Amy answered, which made Tad smiled.<br />
<br />
Tad paid for their tickets and they went in. The movie wasn&#39;t quite what either liked completely, which Amy found out here and there as she tried to ask some questions on who was who and so on, only to find that Tad at best only vaguely knew. It was a bit of a surprise, but the pair made their way through the movie with some measure of calm. The bigger thing was that any conversation on the reveal were limited and actually went relatively well. Tad heard some of these conversations and noted unlike some of the initial &quot;debates&quot; on the reveal things stayed rather calm, though he couldn&#39;t be sure on how much of that was people beginning to accept the change in policy or anything else, but the calm and peace was a hopeful sign and was something that would go for everyone going forward.</p>
