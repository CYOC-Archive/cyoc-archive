<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Keesha the Wanderer had managed to run into a chosen of Ennvoy, and while originally they had tried to convince her to stay away she instead had brought them a grave warning. A new internet connection had been developed that would encircle the globe and give the ability for anyone to connect from the internet anywhere besides too deep underground. Keesha had decided to start with Ennvoy due to it being somewhat well known, but very hard to get to... Outside of now when it would just take a few transformations from some bird to back to a land mammal to find and interact with Ennvoy. Then while the higher ups may have their own soul accounts on lockdown everyone else would be easy prey for a single chronivac user. No matter how many &quot;monsters&quot; were in the forest. Keesha considered herself a philanthropist and wasn&#39;t tied to any particular government or Transdiem. She didn&#39;t particularly care whether or not the people in Ennvoy wanted to live in practically the stone age, but she did care whether or not they&#39;d be found out and exploited. So to try to mitigate whatever damage a random chronivac user could do she  decided to infiltrate Ennvoy as a new convert. <br />
It was simple enough for her to convince the Chosen to agree to the plan considering their indoctrination didn&#39;t stand a chance against being in the real world long enough. Especially with science starting to get strong enough to make a convincing argument that if a soul existed the chronivac&#39;s weren&#39;t reading that. Getting in with a chronivac was simple enough. The only thing the chosen let her bring with her was her body, some underwear, some simple clothes, and a robe. Through the tunnel she walked through and a guard and some passers by saw a new &quot;blessing&quot; of old lady hess. The guard searched her thoroughly just to be sure, and Keesha wondered if he had to be so thorough around certain parts. That said he would never find anything. With scientific advancements phones and tablets were no longer things people carried around, but were implanted directly into their brains. No need to have anything in the eyes that would give away that you were using a computer. The images that the computer wanted you to see would simply be projected in what you thought you sa <br />
<br />
In the original scuffle of what to do with you a kind family of 5 would allow you to stay with them for awhile until you established yourself a bit. It was an older couple and their three kids. Roland who was less a kid and more of a young adult at 18 who... happened to be the one... checking you out... totally his duty thought as a guard. Then there was Denice at 13, and Kevin at 8. <br />
The mother Darlene said &quot;Bless lady Hess, it&#39;s great you were able to make it before a Crony-backer got ya.&quot; <br />
&quot;A Crony-backer?&quot; you asked<br />
Kevin said &quot;Their monsters who sold their souls for power. They can look like you or me, but can become a monster in a second and drag you off to who knows where! All it takes for them to do so is to touch some small object and BAM! It&#39;s just you against some monster!&quot; <br />
The father Stew scoffed and Kevin got silent however Stew said &quot;That&#39;s more or less correct. If you find someone you don&#39;t know out here you either run away or don&#39;t let them touch anything odd. One of the tips as a guard is to not let weird people touch weird things. By the way Miss Keesha, do you have any talents? Might help you find work around here.&quot; <br />
<br />
Keesha smirked hoping she could pull this off and said &quot;I&#39;m a witch.&quot; at which point everyone at the table just stopped and stared. &quot;What? I do my magic without having to touch anything.&quot; Stew who was getting his senses to him grabbed his uncleaned steak knife and pointed it to Keesha. <br />
&quot;I&#39;ll See it when I believe it Crony-Backer! Hands up, and maybe I&#39;ll believe you if you can do something without touching anything.&quot;<br />
Keesha held her hands high in the air and closed her eyes as she chanted &quot;Old Lady Hess, Please give your humble servant golden locks of hair.&quot; while willing the chronivac menus around so she could change her hair color blonde. Obviously it all went the way she wanted.<br />
Kevin said &quot;So, she gets blessing from Hess herself?&quot;<br />
&quot;That&#39;s OLD LADY HESS Kevin!&quot; Stew yelled <br />
&quot;But... she didn&#39;t touch anything... So she couldn&#39;t be a Crony-Backer right?&quot; Stew gritted his teeth as this trick seemed like something a Crony-Backer could&#39;ve done, but then again everything he knew about Crony-Backers made it hard to pin her down as one. They did need to touch something to make a change. Keesha didn&#39;t. <br />
Stew sighed and said &quot;I guess she&#39;s not.&quot;<br />
Keesha grinned and said &quot;I&#39;ve learned how to communicate with Old Lady Hess and get her blessings. I plan on giving her blessings or teaching people how to give them as well.&quot; The parents and Roland who were more stuck in their ways were apprehensive. However the more rebellious Denice in her young adolescence and Kevin who was in awe of the world still wanted to ask for blessings. &quot;Calm down. I don&#39;t wish to give Old Lady Hess&#39; blessing to you immediately. I&#39;ve learned a side effect of giving blessings to other people is that if I do they can never learn to ask Old Lady Hess for blessings themselves. So if you truly wish to be able to user magic I can&#39;t use the blessings on you.&quot; Which got the kids to quite down. One might ask Keesha how was she going to teach kids how to use a chronivac when it required some technology and the only tech she had was inside her brain? Well simple. Nanomachines. Eat enough meat or greens rich in metals and they could synthesize themselves. Just implant some into people with some basic OS with a chronivac installed and they could start to learn how to do whatever they wanted. <br />
<br />
Dinner ended and Keesha had ended up finding herself in a pile of wool of her own body. Simple enough to just increase hair production to that of a sheep in a particular region and lie on that excess fluff. It let her make her own bed and gave more evidence that she could change herself without touching anything but the air. She was out in the living room and the next thing she knew</p>
