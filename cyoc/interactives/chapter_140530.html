<br />
&quot;Here it is,&quot; stated Gorg as he held out the vial of blueish purple liquid.<br />
Taking it cautiously, Lelu looked up at the large orc. &quot;And this&#39;ll cure the lycanthropy?&quot;<br />
&quot;Not cure. Control.&quot;<br />
Lelu and Gorg were standing alone inside Gorg&#39;s cabin away from onlookers. She had been confined to Gratz&#39;s cabin for the past month, going through mental training and preparation. She was told about the risks and had accepted the risk after much thought. Ever since the battle, Lelu had been feeling odd. Like something inside her wanted out, something savage.<br />
&quot;Here goes everything,&quot; Lelu knocked back the potion. As Gratz described, it was going to draw out the werewolf curse and force it to try to take over her before it could take root in her on her next full moon, then it would be too late. It was up to her to fight back against it, and if she succeeds she will have control over it. If she fails, she would devolve into a mindless animal and be put down, hence why Gorg was the only one with her.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes of nothing, Lelu&#39;s body began to feel like it was burning up. She began to tug at the collar of her shirt in an attempt to relieve some heat, but to no avail. Then the heat was overshadowed by the pain in her legs and feet. They gave out and forced her onto her hands and knees as the transformation continued. &#39;Gotta fight it. Gotta remember who I am,&#39; she said to herself, reminding herself of the advice Gratz had said.<br />
Her boots were becoming tighter on her as her feet began to change. She heard a tearing sound as the pressure was relieved  when her boots tore from her elongating heels as they shifted into a form more like a digitigrade stance. She had her eyes closed shut from the pain, but forced them open when she felt her hands cracking and growing. Her lengthening hands began to change to long claws that dug deep gouges in the wood floor. Her shirt had begun to grow tighter on her as her muscles expanded rapidly. Reaching up with one clawed hand, Lelu grabbed the front of her shirt and tightening bra and pulled tearing a large section of the shirt off and breaking her bra, freeing her expanding breasts. The legs of Lelu&#39;s pants were fighting a losing battle as her legs built up muscle, ripping along the seams. Lelu felt her spine and shoulders begin to bulk up, becoming more distinctive under her skin. Through all this, she was fighting a mental battle against the curse. Savage, violent thoughts swam through her head as the curse tried to gain control, only for her to call up any happy thoughts she could think of. Her discovery of her magic talent, a birthday with her parents, joining the mages school for the first 3 years, meeting her new friends. Vect, Sara, and Jack. She felt her rapidly beating heart skip slightly as Jack&#39;s image flashed through her head. The memories of the times they spent together. The curse seemed to be diminishing as more thoughts of Jack came flooding in. Starting innocent enough, but she couldn&#39;t help but remember that magical first night with him in the bathhouse. She actually felt herself begin to get wet despite the pain of the transformation. Her ears were slowly growing to points enhancing her hearing, but as she began to hear new things, and began to focus on the sounds outside the cabin. Footsteps, some heartbeats, voices, individual voices. Alda being praised for his archery skills, Salazar getting a lesson on his breath weapon, Vect and Jack talking about Vect&#39;s technique. The curse was getting desperate to break her, sending images of her butchering her friends. If anything, her resolve hardened and she began to push back. She had new images flood her mind, one in particular turned her on strangly: Jack holding her down and dominating her, making lelu his own. &#39;I. Will. Not. Fail.&#39;<br />
<br />
Gorg watched as the girl continued to grow larger before him. Gratz&#39;s words echoed in his mind, &#39;be ready. When you look into her eyes after the transformation, if yellow, strike without hesitation. She will fully transform this time.&#39; Gorg picked up his battle axe and readied to swing. The girl grew larger and larger, muscles rippling as she reformed. White hairs began to cover her slowly, her ears growing into long points. A loud ripping sound marked the end of her pants, a white wolf tail swished behind her. Below Lelu&#39;s expanded breasts, 3 more pairs ballooned out. She continued to grow and bulk up, growing larger than even 8 ft tall Gorg. As it neared the end of the process, Lelu began to howl and shut her eyes tightly. Then her face pushed outward and reform into a wolf&#39;s. Gorg tensed up, &#39;come on, open up girl.&#39;<br />
A large hand shot out and grabbed the axe and slowly pulled it down, a pair of blue eyes stared back at him. Gorg let out a sigh and loosened up. As Lelu stood up to her full 10 foot tall height, she then began to shrink back, reverting back. But not completely, she stopped shrinking at 7feet tall, and was very muscular like an amazon. Her other breasts had disappeared from her body. The most noticeable feature was her hair remained a pure white color, going from curly to a wild mane of hair giving her a wild look.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is Jack?&quot;</p>
