<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Brendan Bartlet was angry with his father. He had been grounded for violating curfew meaning he was not going <br />
to be going to prom this year.<br />
<br />
Having just received the Chronivac in the mail he was anxious to try it out but hadn't decided on a change to <br />
be made but this gave him an idea.<br />
<br />
When he pulled up his own profile and his dad's he pulled up the option for body swap and saw on the screen an <br />
image of himself and his dad swapping. Now his dad was a big butch manly man. He worked construction so he was <br />
a big bear of a man. Arms as thick as pipes. Chest as muscled as a couple of melons punctuated with thick <br />
nipples. His legs were like logs on top of a barrel of a torso. Now there was a bit of thickness at his middle <br />
that he tried to keep under control but this man was thick all over. Quite in contrast to his son. Brendan was <br />
an athlete but he had never been into football like his dad had been and thus never developed that thick body <br />
that his dad had. he was more into baseball. Not that it was his favorite sport but with his dad's pushing it <br />
had to be a sport that a man would play. Therefore his body was quite a bit slimmer than his dad had been at <br />
his age but still a very hansom young man.<br />
<br />
When he made the changes in the Chronivac his dad came through the door demanding to know what he was doing. <br />
<br />
I am going out tonight.<br />
<br />
You are grounded and you are not going anywhere.<br />
<br />
We will see about that. Brendan pressed submit on the Chronivac and he and his dad collapsed and when they <br />
woke a few hours later they stood and looked at each other. It was like they were looking into a screwy mirror <br />
not reflecting the image they are but the image that they should be. Brendan saw himself from his dad's eyes <br />
and his dad looked up at himself.<br />
<br />
What happened Brendan's dad asked confused and looking into the mirror hanging on the back of Brendan's door.<br />
<br />
I made a little switch and now you are going to be me for awhile.<br />
<br />
Oh no. You change us back now.<br />
<br />
I don't think your in control any more and I am going to be heading out. Now Brendan couldn't go to prom with <br />
his date so he decided to go out to a bar. He had beer before but not much and he hadn't been to a bar before <br />
so he found one close that looked fun. He sat at the bar drank beer after beer getting drunker and drunker <br />
until he was thrown out of the bar. Stumbling home he fell into his dad's bed and slept until well into the <br />
middle of the day.<br />
<br />
Lawrence Bartlet had been looking around Brendan's room all night long looking for whatever Brendan used to <br />
switch them. A spell book, a machine, an amulet. He looked through several things and tried wishing upon so <br />
many different things but nothing happened.<br />
<br />
About 4am he heard his son coming home and looking out the door he saw him very drunk. He followed him and saw <br />
him fall into bed. A few minutes later there came a knock on the door.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to make sure he got home ok he was pretty plowed.<br />
<br />
Yea he is sleeping it off I would say. Lawrence saw the rainbow ring on the guy's ring finger and had an idea. <br />
Thanks for making sure he got home. Wanna come in for a drink.<br />
<br />
Oh no I need to get going.<br />
<br />
Please you did us a favor I have coke and sprite, tea, water. Whatever you want.<br />
<br />
I am a little thirsty. The big muscled man came in and followed Lawrence into the living room.<br />
<br />
Sit I will get you something what would you like. Water will be fine.<br />
<br />
Lawrence popped out and then back quickly with two bottles of water. One for him and one for the man at the <br />
door.<br />
<br />
My dad gets worked up from time to time. Lawrence told the guy. He can't accept that I am gay and having just <br />
turned 18 he gets upset and goes out drinking.<br />
<br />
I hear you. My dad tossed me out when I told him I was gay. At least you still have a place to live.<br />
<br />
Well I am not sure I will for long. Lawrence slipped his hand onto the strangers hand and caressed it. Feeling <br />
the furry knuckles up the sinewy arm.<br />
<br />
Look maybe things will change.<br />
<br />
I sure hope so but I don't see that happening too soon.<br />
<br />
You could be wrong. Lawrence kept caressing the man and he could tell he was getting excited as his already <br />
tight t-shirt showed his stiffening nipples and a growing bulge in his crotch and it didn't seem to be a small <br />
bulge.<br />
<br />
I just want someone to hold me. Lawrence said convincingly. And the big man wrapped his arm around him and <br />
pulled him in tight. Lawrence nibbled on the big man's nipple through the t-shirt and began to rub closer and <br />
closer to his crotch.<br />
<br />
You need to stop that you are getting me excited.<br />
<br />
That's the whole idea.<br />
<br />
Look I don't want you to be tossed out because of me.<br />
<br />
Oh dad is asleep he will be out for hours.<br />
<br />
Lawrence took the man by the hand and led him to Brendan's bedroom where he and the stranger slowly stripped. <br />
Now Lawrence had never had sex with a man before and as dad that would have never happened but he thought that <br />
maybe doing this Brendan would change them back immediately so he took his chances and stripped and pressed <br />
his body next to the big man.<br />
<br />
Be gentle I have never had sex with a man before. I have just had heavy petting. I would like you to be the <br />
first.<br />
<br />
The stranger's arms wrapped around Lawrence's new body. One arm under his butt and the other holding him tight <br />
around his back. Lifting him and tossing him face down on the bed.<br />
<br />
Got any lube?<br />
<br />
No but I have this Lawrence showed him a bottle of lotion.<br />
<br />
Not the best but it will work.<br />
<br />
Lawrence felt the pressure at his back end and as tight as he was the stranger soon came inside of Brendan's <br />
ass filling him. Lawrence felt the pressure of the spent stranger resting on top of him still impaled by the <br />
massive rod. He was in pain but his plan hadn't come to completion yet. He needed to get use to the size of <br />
the cock inside of him and let Brendan see him having sex with a man.<br />
<br />
When Lawrence heard some stumbling around in the house he woke up the stranger and said how about one more <br />
time before you go. Lawrence had his feet at the headboard and his face toward the door as the big man easily <br />
slipped inside of Lawrence's new ass. As his eyes rolled back in his head and the stranger came for the 6th <br />
time that day the door burst open and there stood Brendan looking at his body being fucked by a big muscled <br />
man. He got up and cleaned himself off and got dressed. As he passed by Brendan he said it is ok your boy is a <br />
good man and he is who he is. <br />
<br />
Brendan looked at the man and then down at his body. His dad had a goofy look on his face looking up at him. <br />
The stranger left and Brendan looked at his dad.<br />
<br />
What the hell were you doing he screamed at him. I'm not gay.<br />
<br />
Oh yes you are. At least until you turn us back.<br />
<br />
Brendan rushed to the desk and looked for the Chronivac. What did you do with it?<br />
<br />
With what? I have looked all night long for how you did it to us and I found nothing now you tell me what you <br />
did and change us back.<br />
<br />
I had a machine it looked like a PDA and made the switch with you on it. Now where is it.<br />
<br />
I looked all night long and never found anything so you tell me where you put it. Lawrence thought that <br />
Brendan was lying to him but Brendan didn't know where it was.<br />
<br />
I'm serious where is it Brendan yelled.<br />
<br />
Look I know you have it and I want to be changed now. If you don't my next conquest in your body will be the <br />
baseball team. And I don't think it will all be dicks going up your back end there.<br />
<br />
Brendan couldn't wrap his mind around that thought and knew his dad had to have the Chronivac hidden <br />
somewhere. Well I think I will have the best of the deal. Brendan said to his dad. I don't have it and I know <br />
you have hidden it somewhere to teach me a lesson. So until you give it back I am going to abuse your body. I <br />
am going to eat like a pig, drink like a lush and not have sex until you give it back.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Out in the back yard little Timothy Darden, the Bartlet's next door neighbor's 13 year old son was playing <br />
with a little toy he had found in Brendan's room when they were sleeping hiding it from his parents and the <br />
Bartlets.</p>
