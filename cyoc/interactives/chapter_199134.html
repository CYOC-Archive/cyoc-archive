<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">*Peter&#39;s POV*<br />
<br />
Jake had finally gotten lucid enough to start answering their questions. Kenny, not so much. They&#39;d barred off the door to the locker room, Isaac standing sentinel, insisting that those coming after use the locker room further down the hall. This was something they should keep under wraps. Peter suspected as much as soon as he saw the preggo&#39;s tummy on Kenny, and he was sure when he saw Jake&#39;s glowing blue eyes.<br />
<br />
Those eyes were now no longer emitting light, but they were shockingly blue, something he&#39;d never noticed before. Of course, in a school demographically dominated by white people with German or Nordic background, there was bound to be a fair share of baby blues, but he&#39;d never known his best bud to have them. The formerly grey, now blue, but still very expressive eyes were staring back and forth, flickering unsurely. &quot;Fuck, oh fuck,&quot; Jake muttered. Peter had been made aware by his best friend&#39;s little growth spurt by Elijah, who&#39;d apparently been watching the entire blowjob, and who confirmed that this was a) entirely consensual and b) very much provoked by Kenny. Or Fat Kenny, as seemed more appopriate at the moment. Had that belly gone down in the last five minutes alone? Anyway. To Jake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, buddy. Can you tell us what the hell is going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
*Jake&#39;s POV*<br />
<br />
He was freaking out. Inside, at least. But he told himself to relax and breathe normally, and deeply. He&#39;d just told the little assembly of high-schoolers about the freaky stuff that had happened to him the last days, and they - understandably - had a few questions. Zoning out as they bickered lightly amongst themselves on whether to believe his cray-cray-story or not, he took in the guys in attendance. <br />
<br />
There was Alec, the soccer player, the boyfriend to one of Jake&#39;s closest female friends. Alec was six foot two, with lean, tight muscle all over, sitting at 180 lbs, a lot of it being in the legs, earning him the nickname &quot;Redwood&quot;. His pale skin made a stark contrast with his dark, tousled hair, and right now he was looking quizzically at Jake, the full lips that Chrissy was crazy about pursed.<br />
Isaac was a Will wannabe in everything he did, professing his dream of one day joining the Marines and dying in some war abroad, while actually being quite the Epicurean. Constantly working out and running, constantly checking out girls, Isaac nevertheless was a stand up guy. He was six foot, like Alec, though more muscled at 185 lbs, and he often liked to flaunt his large biceps, his beach-ready six-pack and heavy, round pecs. He had a classically handsome face, with high cheekbones and glinting eyes, but his signature grin was replaced by an intense stare at Jake.<br />
George was blond, like Jake, and six foot four, like Jake, but there the similarities stopped. George had been in a state of constant bulking for the last three years, it seemed, having started just a little more filled out than Jake himself, and now sitting at a mighty 200 lbs, he hadn&#39;t begun his cutting yet. He had a round face, but with still prominent, square jaw, and though he didn&#39;t have visible abs at all, he certainly wasn&#39;t fat - his thick thighs, broad, strong ass, fat pecs and heavy shoulders made him the bulldozer of the group, even with his gentle voice and calm demeanor.<br />
If George and Jake had been opposites, Peter and George still were. Peter was as tall as George and Jake, and lanky, with thin arms, long legs and thick dark hair that fell to his narrow shoulders. The drummer, unlike Jake, had a chiseled face with a strong jawline and high cheekbones, though his cheeks were bordering to looking gaunt. Peter was Jake&#39;s oldest friend, and they&#39;d been adopted into Will Barnes&#39; circle at the same time. Fittingly, now, Jake also knew that while Peter&#39;s dick had been just as long as his, if not slightly more so, it was a whole inch slimmer around. Jake then remembered that he&#39;d grown down there, too, meaning it was possible he was the biggest in the room.<br />
Then there was Elijah, who, with his effeminate face and spindly, childish body, was looking at Jake almost ravenously, a little too close to how Kenny&#39;d been for comfort. And who he&#39;d been told had been voyeurising all along, not intervening at any point. <br />
<br />
Alec spoke up. &quot;Well, I for one am a little, well, let&#39;s say shocked.&quot; He paused. &quot;You, out of nothing, stuffed yourself with food, which Elijah has confirmed, and gained 20 lbs of muscle, and then cumming blue spunk all over your bathroom,&quot; he then paused and looked to the man looking to be due in two months&#39; time, &quot;and without any control of your actions, Kenny just started sucking you off, and you pumped him full, until he looked... well, like that.&quot; <br />
<br />
Isaac, who was sitting closest to Kenny, slipped in: &quot;Hey, do you guys think that his gut looks smaller?&quot;  &quot;Fuuuck,&quot; George exclaimed, &quot;bloat doesn&#39;t just go away like that in twenty minutes! I&#39;ve tried!&quot; &quot;Also,&quot; Jake shot in, &quot;does he look bigger elsewhere to you too?&quot; To Jake, it looked like Kenny was slightly thicked now, than he had been. That his ribs didn&#39;t show as much, because his chest was a little more fleshed out. Kenny looked like him! Except for the receding cum-belly, of course, but it looked like that was getting smaller and smaller. Kenny looked up, some clarity in his gaze, hoarsely mumbling &quot;Where am I?&quot; <br />
<br />
After a few minutes, and after he&#39;d been given some water, Kenny stood up. His new gut was now almost gone, just a thin layer looking like regular teenage flab, but he was definitely bigger everywhere else. His arms had some tone to them, there were thin, but defined pecs, and he even looked ever so slightly broader. &quot;Okay, I get it. Your cum is magic.&quot; He had a clear, determined tone in his voice. And he sounded completely off his rails. &quot;You fucking stupid, or something?&quot; Isaac instantly snapped. &quot;Y&#39;know Kenny,&quot; Alec drawled with a small snicker, &quot;we know you&#39;re from a more religious place than this, but you&#39;re sounding crazy.&quot; Kenny didn&#39;t seem too disheartened. &quot;Well, what&#39;s your explanation, then? Because I can&#39;t see any reasonable explanation. He&#39;s pumped me full of juice, which you guys say is blue-ish, and I get bigger muscles and a bigger junk because of it.&quot; All attendants made a double take. &quot;You what now?&quot; Isaac said quickly.<br />
<br />
Kenny grabbed hold of his package, letting it fall down again. &quot;I never had a soft dick that would point straight down before this. It&#39;s completely soft, and it&#39;s almost as big as I was hard before, look!&quot; He let his cock dangle freely, to the muffled discontent of the watchers. &quot;And I&#39;m pretty sure these two&#39;ve got bigger, too, &#39;cuz right now they&#39;re taking up a lot more space in my hand than they oughta be!&quot; He held his balls in one hand. <br />
<br />
Alec held up a hand. &quot;Well, firstly, we haven&#39;t really seen your dick a lot, so we&#39;re going to have to take your word for it. And secondly, yeah, you&#39;ve grown bigger soft, but does that mean that you&#39;re bigger hard as well? Have you checked?&quot; <br />
That gave Kenny a pause, as he looked unsure, still dangling his bits around. &quot;Well, no. I guess not. I can check, though!&quot; Peter, now the calm head of the group while Jake was still in shock, shot in: &quot;You guys, if you don&#39;t mind, I think we have to take this somewhere else. The janitor&#39;s coming to lock this place any moment, and I don&#39;t think saying &#39;my friend got a bigger cock&#39; is going to stop him.&quot; Peter turned to Jake. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can go to your place, right? Your parents aren&#39;t home?&quot; Jake was in stupor, but nodded absently. &quot;Yeah, that works. Also, I need to eat. I&#39;m fucking starving.&quot;</p>
