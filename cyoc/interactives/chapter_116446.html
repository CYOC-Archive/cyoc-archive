<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Hey, fatso! Pass us that ball!”<br />
<br />
Charles didn’t even risk glancing back at the noisy basketball players. He quickened his pace and tried his best to avoid eye contact, the standard human procedure when dealing with demons.<br />
<br />
It was an extremely warm and orange-colored afternoon. The obese middle-aged banker struggled to move this quick wearing his grey suit and blue tie, his round and balding head shining brightly in the sun. His short legs walked rapidly but his arms, one of them carrying a suitcase, barely moved at all and this made him look like a very funny-looking penguin as he waddled around.<br />
<br />
It had been a hard day at the bank and Charles couldn’t wait to arrive at the bus stop and return home. If only he had a license...but the last time Charles had tried the drive a car he almost pissed himself, so that was out of the question.<br />
<br />
The bus stop was close to downtown, and Charles hated that part of the city. You could find yourself with hooligans, hobos with pointy knives, or worse still, demons.<br />
<br />
So when Charles came across these demons playing around with a ball on the abandoned basketball court he tried his best to look away, but he was surprised when the orange basketball flew right in his direction.<br />
<br />
“Hey, fatso! Pass us that ball!”<br />
<br />
The ball traveling at supersonic speed barely missed Charles’s head by a few inches, but the obese man kept walking without skipping a beat, ignoring the players.<br />
<br />
The basketball ended up rolling into the road. Not long after a speeding car impacted against it with a loud THUD, sending it flying into the air.<br />
<br />
Charles tried his best to quick up his pace, but he stopped advancing. He looked down and saw that his short legs were walking on thin air.<br />
<br />
One of the demons had grabbed him by the collar of his suit! Charles looked back and saw an ugly demon face looking at him. The demon was red-skinned, with two big horns on the top of his head and, judging by the distance Charles’ feet were from the floor, extremely tall.<br />
<br />
The red demon was wearing a basketball uniform that looked too small to fit his muscular physique and a pair of dirty human-sized sneakers, just like the rest of his gang.<br />
<br />
“You fucker! You made us lose our ball!” Said the demon with a deep voice. His teeth were so sharp and pointed Charles would’ve have preferred dealing with a hobo’s knife any day. “You’ll have to replace it, fatass!” The demon spat out with anger.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright...! Just let me go!” Said Charles with his whiny voice. Once his feet were on land again, his shaky hands went directly inside his pockets to take out his wallet. But when he took it out, the demon slapped the man’s wrist and the wallet’s generous contents spilled all over the ground.<br />
<br />
The demon laughed. “Hahaha, you must be a fool to think you can replace our ball with your useless human cash...”<br />
<br />
Charles crouched down to try and recover the contents of his wallet but the demon stomped on the human’s hand and the fat man cried in agony.<br />
<br />
Two other smaller demons approached the struggling man from his behind and proceeded to kick him in the butt in turns.<br />
<br />
“That’s right! Why’d we want your money when you have two big orbs back in here!” Said one of them. “Why not share one of them with us, uh?!”<br />
<br />
The other kicked him on the butt again, but this time the old sneaker also impacted against two smaller ‘orbs’.<br />
<br />
“ARRGHH! My balls!”<br />
<br />
The red demon grabbed Charles by his neck. “You didn’t show any mercy to our ball, why should we care about what happens to yours?”<br />
<br />
“I say we cut them off!” Said a blue demon. “It’s not like the fat fuck is gonna use them anyway.”<br />
<br />
“No! Please, no...!” Cried Charles, gasping for air.<br />
<br />
The red demon, clearly the leader of the gang, grabbed Charles’ balls through his pants and squished them. “Nah, we can’t play basketball with these little marbles, can’t we?”<br />
<br />
Charles yelped as his genitals were manhandled without any respect.<br />
<br />
The demon let go of his grip and Charles fell into the ground face-up, his shirt barely covering his hairy bellybutton.<br />
<br />
“Look at him, so fucking fat and hairy.” Said the red demon. “You think a suit and tie over your disgusting belly is all you need to have dignity? I say off with them!”<br />
<br />
Charles looked at the demon flabbergasted. He was about to say something but then the two smaller demons jumped on him and started clawing at his shirt and pants, both of them as eager as little children unwrapping their Christmas presents.<br />
<br />
Their claws ripped through cloth and fleshy pink skin indiscriminately. When they were finished they looked proudly at their handwork, the fat naked man surrounded by ripped shreds of clothing and covered up in small bruises, with glee.<br />
<br />
“Hahaha, now this little worm is a good joke.” Said the blue demon as his claws teased the tip of Charles’ shriveled dick.<br />
<br />
Charles, naked as the day he was born, tried to get up and make a run for it, but he only managed to get more laughs as his tired belly rolls waddled around slowly, as if in slow motion.<br />
<br />
He looked so pathetic naked. Fat, bald, weak, slow, hairy in all the wrong places, a small manhood that seemed to be fighting to not piss itself... He surely didn’t look like the successful banker he had been this morning.<br />
<br />
The hurt and aching human was grabbed once again by the red demon. Charles was sweaty and full of claw marks all over. The demon carried the squirming Charles around, the fatso squirming like a fish out of the water and without scales.<br />
<br />
The demon looked at the poor sod right in the eyes. “Your face is so fucking ugly, even by human standards. Let me fix that up for you.”<br />
<br />
The red demon punched him on top of his head with such strength, that Charles’ head ended up buried down in his own torso. His muffled screams and the way he ran around like a headless chicken made him look like a tortured slapstick cartoon character.<br />
<br />
He raced in a panic, blind and without mouth to properly scream. He wondered if the only reason he was not dead was because the red demon was using his black magic on him, and he wasn’t wrong.<br />
<br />
The fat man without a head ran in circles, pleading for mercy but he only got more laughs and mockery from the demons.<br />
<br />
The blue demon got closer to Charles and twisted the nipples of his hairy and flabby chest with brute force. Charles yelped in pain, but then he realized he could see again... But wait, he still didn’t have a head... His aching nipples squinted in surprise. He was seeing though his nipples?!<br />
<br />
Next, the blue demon pierced Charles’ navel with the claw of his middle finger.<br />
<br />
“ARRGH!!!” Charles still couldn’t believe it, but he was screaming through his bellybutton! He was a fucking freak!<br />
<br />
The headless freak panicked so much he tried to punch the blue demon in front of him, but then the two smaller demons grabbed both of his arms and squished them into his hairy armpits. Soon enough, where his arms should have been there were only two stinking and sweaty armpits.<br />
<br />
“Stop it! Don’t do anything more to me! Don’t even dare to look at me!”<br />
<br />
The red demon grabbed Charles by his love handles and then pressed down. When the demon had finished, Charles’ belly had ‘eaten’ his own legs.<br />
<br />
“Poor thing, look at it, it’s just a belly and tits now!” Said the red demon in mock pity.<br />
<br />
“And an asshole!” Said the two smaller demons at the same time as they got a whiff at the hairy butthole. A clawed finger teased his buttcrack and the hairy thing replied with a nervous fart.<br />
<br />
“Leave me alone!” Said Charles with tears flowing from his nipples. He tried to move, but he no longer had any limbs to even lift himself from the floor. With resignation, he shifted his weight around and began to roll like a ball, his moobs getting dizzy in the process.<br />
<br />
“Now THAT’S how you replace a ball!” Said the red demon in contempt as he grabbed Charles and made him spin on the top of his finger. Next he launched him like a volleyball into the air.<br />
<br />
He was the greasiest, hairiest, stinkiest ball ever made, but it would do.<br />
<br />
The flying disembodied torso spinned like mad in mid-air. His bellybutton screamed wide open. “Arrrgh! I’m gonna pu-”<br />
<br />
PUNCH! The blue demon had jumped and slammed the ball down into the basketball court. One of the smaller demons got to the ball first, but then the other small demon jumped on top of him and intercepted the human ball.<br />
<br />
The small demon ran towards the basket bouncing the sentient human belly against the ground as he did so. Charles cried in despair when his testicles were crushed in the process more than once.<br />
<br />
“Hey! Pass me the ball!” Said the red demon. The smaller demon did so and the red demon struck back with a powerful shot that made Charles travel out from the court at supersonic speed and the disgusting balled-up human kept on rolling towards the road.<br />
<br />
“Ugh... This can’t get worse...” Thought the tortured ball, but not long after a speeding car impacted against him with a loud THUD, sending him flying into the air.<br />
<br />
The red demonic fiend burst out laughing. “Whoops, my fault!&quot;</p>
