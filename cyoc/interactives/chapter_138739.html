<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The ring continued glow and emit its radiant light, and suddenly you started feeling odd... almost sluggish. A painful and aching feeling emerged in your stomach and you groaned then clutched It tightly with one of your front claws. &quot;Ugh, Wh-What’s happening?!&quot; You growled feeling the pain start to grow inside of you, building up but then ceased.<br />
<br />
You laid down on your side and your stomach gurgled loudly, and it was then you saw it bulge out unnaturally. &quot;Wh-What the...” You thought then the pain started up again, and you growled and grasped your stomach with both claws. You watched and felt it start to swell up, and you could feel a sort of warmth as well as what felt like movement inside of you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wh-What’s happening?!&quot; You shouted, and you suddenly noticed six nipples form on your chest, and the flesh around them started feeling heavy. You put your claw on one nipple and then the flesh around it started swelling outwards, and you moaned as you cupped the flesh around it. You were in pain still, but the feeling of this orb of flesh growing on your chest was almost ecstatic for you, and in a weird way calming.<br />
<br />
&quot;Th-This feels...&quot; You paused then you heard an unsettling squelch from your pelvis region, but when you look down you couldn’t see anything past your enormous belly. You had to stretch your long neck down towards your nether region, but when you did your eyes widened and your jaw dropped in shock. Instead of your glorious balls and sheath, you saw a soft opening similar to a puffy set of lips form and effectively replace your manhood.<br />
<br />
You then looked to the rest of your body and noticed that your overall appearance has changed, and your muscle mass has decreased immensely. You almost appeared to be... feminine, and you gulped as you watched your hips slowly widen out before the pain started up again. &quot;Argh! What....is...this?!&quot; You growled, and clutched your large stomach, and you figured you were at least double your previous weight now from your stomach alone, not to mention what you were afraid to admit were your new breasts, which were now easily looked like they could hold ten beach balls inside, each, all six of your breasts becoming squishy but firm on your body.<br />
<br />
The sluggish feeling you had only grew with your own weight, and eventually your vision started feeling blurry. You felt like you were hallucinating now, as your surroundings started to look different and everything seemed like getting was growing bigger. A mirror appeared in front of you and you saw your reflection, the reflection of an extremely gravid dragoness inside of a large nest. She had golden anklets with emeralds on them, and earrings made from gold as well. She had the same ring as you did and a necklace with a large diamond shaped jewel in her chest, and your jaw dropped as you now muttered in the voice of a shrill young woman,&quot;Th-this is me?&quot;<br />
<br />
That is when you felt something happened that filled you with a sense of fear. You looked down and saw a wet stain covering a section of what now appeared to be a nest, and this liquid covered your vagina, and a small part of your tail. Instinctively you knew what this was, but you didn’t want to believe it, not until the contractions started. You started hyperventilating as the pains got worse, started happening more frequently, and finally moved down to your pelvic region.<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn’t happening, this isn’t rraaaaagh!&quot; You roared out then started feeling a large object move towards the opening of your birth canal. &quot;IT’S HAPPENING!!!&quot; You screamed as loud as you could, shooting a large stream of fire into the air, and it barely touched the ceiling, which now looked to be made from white marble. You started struggling, and you tried to get up but couldn’t, you were too heavy and too weak. Everything was happening so fast, and everything looked blurry in your vision now, and then you felt the large object push up against your vaginal walls.<br />
<br />
You roared again as a searing and unbearable pain overwhelmed your system from your vagina. You thought you were done for when you saw a blue scales figure appear before you, and a male voice said,&quot;Calm down, control your breathing, deep in and deep out.&quot;<br />
<br />
You didn’t know what this being was, but you could tell who or whatever he was he was trying to help you, and at this rate you didn’t have a choice but to listen. So you started to slow your breathing and you took deeper breaths, and the figure replied,&quot;Good, now spread your legs, brace yourself and start pushing, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;B-But I...&quot; You began this creature took your claw and said,&quot;I’m with you, so don’t worry, just do as I say and you’ll get through this.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave this figure a slight nod, tears of pain rolling down your cheeks as your spread your legs out wide and felt another object drop into your womb. You had no other options now, sor you started pushing and you felt your vagina stretch, as a large, round object started emerging from your body. You squeezed the figure’s hand and heard it whimper as you pushed the object slowly and painfully out of your body. You got it most of the way out when another figure appeared below you and helped you by pulling it the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
However that wasn’t the only one, and it seemed you had to immediately start pushing again to get the second object out as yet another one dropped down. &quot;How many of these fucking things are there?!&quot; You thought to yourself as you pushed out yet another object, screaming in pain the entire time. <br />
<br />
The second object came out much easier than the first it seemed, but more kept dropping into your womb so you kept pushing them out as much as you possibly could. The pain eventually grew numb, and all that was left was an odd sense of lust and fulfillment for what you were doing. You moaned and orgasmed as the final object was ejected from your body too, but then you blushed, realizing how aroused you felt after that last egg.<br />
<br />
You laid breathing heavily, and with each deep breath you took a exhaled a small stream of fire, feeling satisfied with your efforts, as oddly as that sounded. You looked down at your belly and surprisingly it hasn’t lost all of its size, and the tiny movements continued. &quot;How.... many are in me still?” You asked exhausted as you looked out to the figures. <br />
<br />
Your vision was clearing up some now, and before you were two dragons who seemed almost the same age as you. The male had the same scale color as you did on his back but red ones on his stomach, and his eyes reminded you of your own. He clutched his claw and a tear rolled down his cheek, and he looked in pain. The other dragon was female, and she had orange scales covering her back and aquamarine on her breasts and stomach, her horns looked like yours and if it weren’t for the orange scales she’d be the spitting image of you.<br />
<br />
The female was counting up the objects you pushed out, and she smiled a bit and looked back to you and bowed her head. &quot;That’s thirteen eggs this time around, a bountiful clutch as always mother.&quot; The female said<br />
<br />
&quot;Thirt.... mother?!&quot; Your eyes widened for a moment as you looked to her, and then you looked to the male grasping his claw. &quot;Heh, I-I didn’t expect that out of you, heh, I’m wondering if I should do strength training with you now instead of Dad.&quot; He said<br />
<br />
Your thoughts were clouded, and you had to gather yourself for a few minutes. These two were your children?! It would definitely explain their appearances, but what kind of place were you in right now? You looked around your room and saw everything was now the size for you, and your bed was now the very nest you laid in. You had a large mirror and a chest full of jewelry off to the side. Everything looked so nice, so ornate and so rich for someone like you, or rather something like you. You then noticed a diary off to the side, on a shelf next to a quill in a container of ink.<br />
<br />
The female dragon looked to the male one and asked,&quot;Are you okay? Should I call for someone brother?”<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah, I’ll manage, I don’t think it’s broken....heh.&quot; He replied <br />
<br />
You shook your head back into focus once you heard the male, or rather your son, say this. &quot;Broken?!&quot; You shrieked, your finned ears lowered as a sudden feeling of concern washed over you. <br />
<br />
The male and female looked at you and the male blushed and looked away. &quot;It’s fine, really mom.&quot; He whimpered, but you could still see the pain on his face.<br />
<br />
You attempted to stand up now, and the female rushed over and helped you up by allowing you to use her as leverage. You looked at her and smiled,&quot;Thank you sweetheart,&quot; you then wobbled on over to the male, still a bit light headed from what you just experienced, and you grabbed his wrist and examined it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow ow ow! Hey, that really REALLY hurts!&quot; He whined and as you moved each of his talons he let out a small whine. Your eyes widened and teared up all of a sudden, in your mind you rejected these emotions but you couldn’t help but display them physically.<br />
<br />
&quot;M-Mom?&quot; Your son muttered and you immediately found yourself wrapping your wings around him, and crying inside his shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;My baby boy!&quot; You cried then you heard the door open and a dragon, who was wheeling in a cart into the room appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone get a doctor!&quot; You cried, and your daughter from earlier nodded and rushed out the door, while the male with the cart just paused and walked in.<br />
<br />
This male was purple scales on his underside and the same navy blue as you on his back. He looked to you and asked,&quot;I-Is everything okay mom!?&quot;<br />
<br />
You showed him the hand of your son and growled,&quot;Does everything look okay!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom, it’s okay, it’s only an injury, it will heal up I promise.&quot; Your other son whimpered then you shook your head and said,&quot;Just let the doctor do their job, and they’ll see, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... I’m one of your guards.&quot; He retorted<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no you aren’t, and that is permanently damaged because of what happened I won’t forgive myself.&quot; You whimpered <br />
<br />
Your son’s eyes stared into yours, and he slowly nodded to you then looked to the other and said,&quot;You should probably get tend to those eggs soon, and get them to an incubator for god sakes.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your son with the cart nodded at this and said,&quot;O-Of course, yes, please don’t beat yourself mom, or queen... however you like to be addressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
You paused and thought,&quot;Queen? Mom? What the hell is going on here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, with this overwhelming compassion and worried feeling in your body to help your injured son, you guided him to your nest and said,&quot;You are going to wait here until a doctor comes young man, no questions asked!&quot;<br />
<br />
The dragon gathering up your eggs paused and asked,&quot;Wait a moment... Mom why aren’t you....uh, forgive me please, but older? I mean you look almost as young as him.&quot;<br />
<br />
You blushed a bit as you heard this, and you didn’t know whether to be furious with this drake or not when your other son spoke up,&quot;Mother doesn’t age half-brother, that’s why she is our eternal queen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The drake had finished gathering up your eggs by now, and he slowly nodded in response to this and said,&quot;Ooh, okay that makes sense now. Oh, apologies again mother, I’ll.... just get these eggs to the incubators now. Oh, uh if you are free.... I apologize but the most recent generation of hatchlings, next door, were awakened by your uh... screams. I think the sooner they see their mommy the better.&quot;<br />
<br />
You watched as the other drake left and you now were alone with your son, who you knew not the name of, and you were waiting for a doctor to check up on him while you had so many unanswered questions. Who the hell are these dragons? If they’re your offspring then where are their fathers? How are you still pregnant when you just gave birth? Why did your children call you their queen, and why did you have an overwhelming belief that these were your children and a compulsive passion to be a mother to them?!<br />
<br />
You were going to get a headache over all of this if you couldn’t find answers soon. You remembered the diary on the desk, but were more concerned about your son. These thoughts also made you wonder about other generations of hatchlings you’ve birthed into the world, and you wondered if you should be caring for them and raising them right now. Everything for you was so confusing and you found it frustrating, but mostly you had to look in the mirror and ask yourself,&quot;What do I do now?”</p>
