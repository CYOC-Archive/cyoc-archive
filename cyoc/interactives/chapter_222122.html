<br />
Jennifer&#39;s classes, surprisingly, passed in a rather normal fashion-well, almost normal. Whenever she wanted a teacher to call on her, instead of raising her hand Jennifer honked her nose. In Algebra, when called up to demonstrate an equation, Jennifer&#39;s suspenders came loose, and her pants dropped to show her striped panties. The laughter THAT ensued made Jennifer glad she had placed a maxi-pad in her underpants. <br />
<br />
Before she knew it, 11:00 arrived. Jen showed up at Cheerleading practice with the rest of the squad on the football field, dress in a ty-died tank top and matching bloomers. The cheer routines were similar, but now modified for Jennifer&#39;s clown antics. <br />
<br />
The squad was practicing for their finale. the human pyramid. As planned, Jennifer was coming to climb to the very top, only to trip on her big feet. She somersaulted into the girls at the bottom and brought the whole pyramid crashing down. <br />
<br />
The football team was also outside practicing, and, watching the practice, laughed so intensely that Jennifer felt her maxi-pad become soaking wet. As fast as she could in her oversized feet, she ran for the girls’ section in the outhouse next to the stands, occasionally tripping and falling on her face.  <br />
<br />
As soon as she got inside, she sat on one of the toilets, and lowering her panties, immediately began pleasuring herself. After several minutes, she looked down; not only was her pad soaked all the way through, but her panties were also ruined.  <br />
<br />
Jennifer sighed, her box of pads and spare panties were locked away in the girls’ locker room in the gym. How could she get them without anyone noticing and making her even hornier with laughter. <br />
<br />
“Hey Jen,” Molly’s voice called from outside the stall. “I went into the gym and got your spare panties and a pad.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, thank you, thank you thank you.” Jennifer eagerly placed the fresh pad into the panties, then pulled them on. After pulling up her bloomers, Jennifer stepped outside. <br />
<br />
Even though it was unnecessary, Jennifer looked in the mirror, examining her ‘make-up.’ Even though she knew the answer, she asked, “Molly, how long have we been friends?” <br />
<br />
“Have you forgotten,” Molly asked, mock serious. “Since the third grade, when my family moved here from Albuquerque.  I thought it was so neat, that one of my classmates was a real-life clown, that I just wanted to hang out with you. “ <br />
<br />
“You really like having a clown for a friend?” <br />
<br />
“Well, of course,” Molly said. “It’s such fun, styling your hair, and helping pick out your outfits, and the way you make me, and other people laugh. I almost wish I could join you in on it.” <br />
<br />
“Maybe you can,” Jennifer said coyly. “Transform or Dare.” <br />
<br />
Molly couldn’t believe her ears; Jennifer had always mocked that old urban legend. It had to be another one of her jokes; her friend was a clown after all. “Oh, very well,” she said as she rolled her eyes. “Transform.” <br />
<br />
“Oh, very good,” Jennifer giggled. “For you transformation, you will become a clown like me-only you’re an auguste clown. I may be clumsy, but you’re even clumsier. I may act like a pompous fool, but you behave like a dimwitted bimbo-although you can still be serious when you must be, like with your schoolwork. Laughter makes you horny, even more so than me. As far as everyone but me knows, you were always a clown-including yourself. That’s right, you will be completely lost inside the clown you become.” <br />
<br />
A haze came over Molly’s mind, and her body started tingling. Her fair complexion changed to a sugary pink hue, while patches of white formed around her eyes and mouth. Molly’s lips inside her muzzle became black and reshaped into a dainty clown smile that looked like her mouth was always open. The ovals around her eyes stretched up to her forehead and her eyelids became shaded in orange.  Wide black arches topped the patches around her eyes, giving Molly a surprised look. Black outlined her eyes; her eyelashes became long and curly. Red blush formed around Molly’s muzzle and covered her cheeks; three black freckles formed on each. Her auburn hair thickened and curled into ringlets, and turned to green with pink and orange highlights.<br />
<br />
A final change to Molly’s face happened as a loud POP! sounded, and her nose was a perfect sphere, big as a plum and shiny red as a Christmas tree ornament.  <br />
<br />
As her body was changing so were Molly’s clothes. Her tank top became tye-dyed in green, pink, and orange like her hair. Her shorts lengthened and puffed into bloomers of the same colors. Her white socks stretched up into the hems of her new bloomers and became orange with green polka dots. Molly’s tennis shoes stretched out to a size 28, while the toes widened to nearly ten inches and curled slightly upward. Inside, a noise like an inflating balloon sounded, and Jennfier new Molly’s feet were reshaping to fit her shoes. <br />
<br />
Molly stared, glassy eyed, until Jennifer poked her new clown nose. Honk! Molly blinked, and the glassy haze disappeared. She felt her nose, gingerly at first, then gave it a couple of squeezes.  <br />
<br />
HONK! HONK! <br />
<br />
Molly broke out into a fit of giggles. “C’mon, Jen!” she said. She had no memory at all of what happened; as far as she knew, she had been born an auguste clown. When her family had moved to this town when she was eight, she had been overjoyed to find another clown girl become her friend. Even better that Jennifer was a whiteface; the two of them balanced each other out very well with the personalities and antics. “We’ve got to get back and help our squad get ready for the game tonight!” <br />
<br />
Molly exited the outhouse; back flipping and somersaulting her way to the practice field. Jennifer followed her friend at a somewhat more dignified waddle. As much as she now loved being a clown, she was glad to have a partner who could help take some of the stress of being the school laughingstock off her.</p>
