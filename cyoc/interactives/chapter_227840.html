<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Although there was lots of potential with putting a mind in someone else&#39;s body parts, Josh&#39;s thoughts were on an earlier option: giving full control of their shared body to Andrew.  Seeing that option had sparked an idea in his head.<br />
<br />
First, he turned off mental communcation.  He didn&#39;t want Andrew reading his thoughts.  He then altered his and Andrew&#39;s merged body, changing it completely back into a male white tiger named &quot;Andrew Homes&quot;.  Josh wanted things to proceed as though no merging had occurred.  With that in mind, he gave full control to Andrew.  Josh would secretly be a passenger in Andrew&#39;s body.  This way, he could get close to Andrew&#39;s friends by proxy of Andrew being close to them.<br />
<br />
This left the problem of there being no Josh around, which Andrew would surely notice.  He considered changing Andrew&#39;s awareness, making her forget that Josh ever existed.  But regardless of whether Andrew was his fiancé or twin brother, Josh didn&#39;t want to rob Andrew of that special bond they have.  After thinking over it a few minutes, he decided on a method to explain his absence, which he would act on as soon as the opportunity arose.<br />
<br />
By this point, Josh had spent a good ten minutes or so within the transformation void, at least from his perspective.  Outside the void, no time had passed.  So it was no surprise as he exited the void, and found himself staring down at Andrew&#39;s phone, looking at the message Andrew had just read.  Josh took a mental stock of the body he now inhabited -- covered in fur, butt on the floor, forelegs propped up, and head hanging down to look at the phone.  A strange position to suddenly find oneself in, but a comfortable one given his quadruped form.<br />
<br />
However, any thoughts of &quot;being a passenger&quot; were thrown out the window when Josh found himself suddenly picking up Andrew&#39;s phone in his mouth, and slipping it into the satchel on his side.  Yes, Josh was technically a passenger in Andrew&#39;s tiger body, but this body felt as much his as it did Andrew&#39;s, and it was being moved outside of Josh&#39;s control!  All the more jarring when Andrew stood up and looked around beneath him, Josh&#39;s vision shifting as Andrew&#39;s eyes darted around, with absolutely no resistance from Josh.  And to top it off, Josh felt himself take an uncontrolled breath, and began speaking in a growly voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Josh, where&#39;d you go?&quot;  Andrew lifted up her paws, finding no rubber mouse beneath him.  &quot;Did you change into something else and wander off?  That&#39;s cheating.  You&#39;re supposed to be inanimate.&quot;  Though slighly annoyed, Andrew was also amused by Josh&#39;s antics.  So far, this trip to the Transformation Resort had been pretty fun, and she looked forward to enjoying more transformations with her fiancé.<br />
<br />
Andrew started searching around the room, trying to spot where Josh had disappeared to.  Josh, however, was mentally stumbling from his perspective.  While Andrew already had a couple of hours to get used to walking on four legs, it was a new experience for Josh.  Without any control over the legs, Josh felt like he was at constant risk of tripping and falling.  Combined with his head and eyes forcefully looking around everywhere, it was like the most intense roller coaster he&#39;d ever ridden!  Unlike a roller coaster, though, Josh had the option to get off this ride any time he wanted.  However, knowing the intensity was all in his mind, he decided to stick it out, hoping he&#39;d get used to it, eventually.<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright, have it your way.  I&#39;m gonna go down and meet my friends.  Oh, but not before a quick bathroom break.&quot;  Andrew padded toward the hole near the corner that acted as a toilet.  &quot;Our room still thinks this is a one-tiger enclosure, so no peeking, okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course Josh wouldn&#39;t be peeking, he&#39;d doing business with her!  Andrew stood over the hole, which did have some water deep within it.  Not sure how male tigers typically pee, she lifted up a hind leg.  Josh felt their shared penis peek out from their sheath, and begin urinating, the sound of it hitting the water below.  Josh felt conflicting emotions.  On the one hand, it felt like he was the one relieving himself; on the other hand, it was awkward doing it with someone else.<br />
<br />
Upon finishing, their penis was pulled back into its sheath, and Andrew turned to press a button, flushing the makeshift toilet.  She then lifted up a paw to look under herself, leaving Josh staring at their tiger equipment.  Though alien, it was interesting to think that was now technically his.  &quot;Okay, peeing with a penis is actually pretty neat.  And I didn&#39;t even have to hold on to it.  Anyway, I&#39;m heading down to the lobby.  You can meet us later if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andrew walked to the door, pressing a nearby button to open it.  Down the hallway she walked, making her way to the elevator.  At first, they were alone, but as they got closer to the elevator, they encountered other guests in various shapes.  Upon reaching the first floor, there was a crowd.  Andrew walked through the crowd in search of her friends, excited to show them her current form.<br />
<br />
Josh, on the other hand, was feeling self-concious.  Although he was getting used to his four-legged body moving on its own, his mind was now focused on the tiger equipment that now hung between his hind legs.  He may have changed Andrew into a comfortable nudist, but he himself still preferred clothing.  It didn&#39;t matter that his penis was now hidden inside a sheath.  He could still feel his ballsack swinging tightly between his legs, in clear view of anyone who may be walking behind him.  And that line of thinking lured his attention to another private area: his tailhole.  No longer tucked away between a pair of human buttcheeks, the only thing keeping it hidden was their tiger tail, which was thankfully kept lowered for now.</p>
