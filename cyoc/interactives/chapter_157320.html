<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Merica didn&#39;t see John, but thought to where she could be... stories... back when she was new she ran the shrine at the supermall... The city sure is a lot different now than it was back there but she managed to find the supermall... well it was just a mall now. How far back did Merica go? Well least it was as busy as the supermall considering the line to get in. Merica got in line and muttered to herself &quot;Was it really this busy?&quot; she looked at the red head in front of her and asked &quot;Uh miss, is this the line for the shrine or just the mall in general?&quot; <br />
Interestingly enough the red head in front of her was Kathy who turned around and said &quot;This is the line for the mall itself, then there&#39;s another line for the shrine.&quot; <br />
Merica thought to herself &quot;...She looks familiar... Maybe you met one of her children or grandchildren before?&quot; <br />
Kathy wondered something similar and asked &quot;Have we met before? You look kinda familiar...&quot; Considering being Jane&#39;s daughter Merica did have a lot of similar features with her mother Kathy was right to be curious. <br />
Merica just as curious said &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible. I just came to town last night.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Well this seems like it&#39;s going to be a long wait. Mind if I asked what brings you to our city?&quot; <br />
Merica said &quot;Visiting family, know the Mavis&#39;s?&quot; <br />
Kathy grinned &quot;Actually I&#39;m a friend of theirs. I guess that&#39;s why you looked familiar. My name&#39;s Kathy.&quot; she said with a hand extended. Merica looked at this teen who may have been younger than her. How is this woman with a grin and a mischievous look in her eye the same mat- Right the past. <br />
Merica accepted the handshake and said &quot;My name&#39;s Merica, mind if I asked how Jane&#39;s doing? I haven&#39;t been able to say hi.&quot; The two were chatting for a little while when a girl in some really expensive clothes just walked past bypassing the line. &quot;Hey no cutting!&quot; <br />
The girl happening to be Saya said &quot;huh? I&#39;m in the VIP lane. I don&#39;t even need to cut.&quot; <br />
Kathy sighed and said &quot;As much as I hate this bitch her dad does work for the place. I saw her friend get in pretty easily too.&quot; Merica&#39;s knowledge from the future was making it hard for her to think she was even on the same timeline. This... well Bitchy Princess looking girl was Saya? Kathy her best friend just called her a Bitch right in her face unironicaly?.. Well if it gets her in faster she may as well attempt to correct this alternate timeline. <br />
<br />
Kathy and Saya were laughing together side by side as they were enjoying some frozen yogurt at the food court. &quot;How have we not made up sooner Saya?&quot; Kathy said a cup of vanilla yogurt in front of her. <br />
&quot;No idea, Hey why don&#39;t you join me for dinner with Jane?&quot; Saya said with a cup of vanilla yogurt in front of her as well. <br />
Merica said &quot;Mind if I joined, I&#39;m Jane&#39;s... cousin and was hoping to visit, but seeing the line at the shrine...&quot; a cup of chocolate yogurt in hand. <br />
<br />
After a few long long hours the three teens went for a seemingly unopened restaurant in the mall. John was waiting inside looking at the menu... For sure they had taken the whole Priestess of Chronos... Brand for lack of a better word a little far. Most of the stores had some time style of sale, and the soon to be opened restaurant had several menu items and cocktails with time puns. <br />
Saya said &quot;Hi Jane, how you doing?&quot; John turned and saw Saya the girl she now kind of tolerated, Kathy an old friend, and then Merica... the mystery daughter from the future. <br />
John said &quot;I think some of these places are abusing my presence. You should see some of these... names.&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Second cooked pork isn&#39;t terrible.&quot; <br />
John thought for a second... and then thought again &quot;Wait... What are you two doing together? Merica, the hell did you do to them?!?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Oh just showed us how silly we were being.&quot; <br />
Saya nodded &quot;Remembering what we were like half a day ago just seemed so silly.&quot; <br />
The two giggled and Kathy said &quot;Least we can laugh about it.&quot; <br />
Seeing her mother&#39;s cautious glare Merica said &quot;Really, I just talked to them. A little bit of insight can do a lot you know? Anyways is there anything different about the second cooked pork?&quot; <br />
John leaned on her arm on a table and said &quot;...I&#39;m not getting enough sleep for this... I&#39;m going to take a nap in the break room.&quot; <br />
Saya said &quot;Alright, don&#39;t overwork yourself. Let me know if there&#39;s something I can do to help. I do have some influence here.&quot; <br />
John got up said &quot;yeah... thanks.&quot;<br />
Merica asked &quot;But what about a family meal m-&quot; <br />
John said &quot;...I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m awake right now. I&#39;m getting some rest.&quot; and left. <br />
Merica&#39;s face grew stiff again as she thought &quot;Why? I brought them together, we could have a nice meal together with family friends... Why are you leaving?!?&quot; <br />
Kathy said &quot;Hope she&#39;ll be ok.&quot; <br />
Saya nodded and said &quot;Yeah...&quot; looking at the menu she said &quot;Thyme Pizza sounds interesting-&quot; <br />
Merica&#39;s face just drooping tired said &quot;I&#39;m not actually that hungry right now... I think I&#39;m going to go back home.&quot; and in her mind said &quot;Chronos, could you send me some prayers till midnight or so? I just want to stay busy right now...&quot; and walked off ignoring Kathy and Saya&#39;s questions. <br />
<br />
Sometime late at night some guy Merica helped said &quot;Thanks you very much! I knew you priestesses were a thing, but I thought the Chronos part was all a myth!&quot; <br />
Merica said monotonously &quot;Yes, yes. Please to help you with your issue. Praise Chronos...&quot; Walking away into the night streets by herself she sighed and asked out loud &quot;...body&#39;s getting a little tired... How the heck did mom work several months without food or rest again?&quot; <br />
&quot;MERICA! What the hell are you thinking?!?&quot; a somewhat familiar voice said... She turned and saw Auntie Dolly. &quot;We were looking everywhere for you and what you&#39;re trying to run away?!? Hasn&#39;t your mother taught you better? How much strife this stuff puts on EVERYONE who cares about you?!?&quot; <br />
Merica muttered &quot;Whatever...  I wasn&#39;t running away, just doing a little bit of Chronos work while mom&#39;s busy with her work...&quot; <br />
Dolly said &quot;It&#39;s way past her shift and she&#39;s been back for awhile. Don&#39;t you even have a watch on you?&quot; <br />
Merica asked &quot;And what use would that be? We&#39;re always manipulating time which would affect the watches and throw off the display. Besides us Chronos Priestesses basically have a built in clock.&quot;<br />
Dolly sighed as she texted a group chat then said &quot;Since there&#39;s no way I can physically force you to come home... Seriously martial artist and really smart and yet you can&#39;t even-&quot; <br />
Merica said &quot;Fine I&#39;ll go back, try to keep up.&quot; and started to jog back home. Dolly had to admit the girl was fit.&quot; <br />
<br />
Merica managed to beat Dolly home by a few minutes and with the power of time manipulation no lock would stay locked before her might. No one was home though. Then reality shifted as the light switch was forced to a different time when it was on as the lights came on. The bright lights slightly blinding Merica for a second as she asked &quot;Who&#39;s there?!? Apollo Priestess?&quot; <br />
A familiar voice said &quot;you talk to your mother like that? I must say I&#39;m disappointed... or at least I should be.&quot; In the corner of the room was an older John. One who went by Jane and was in an older body to sell that she was from a different time. <br />
Merica asked &quot;What are you doing here. How did you know when-&quot; <br />
&quot;Dolly texted me tonight so I knew when to come... Plus a few other things.&quot; Jane said as the front door unlocked as the young John entered and saw Merica and well... herself. <br />
&quot;Wha?!? Jane, Mommy... Why are you all here now?!?&quot; <br />
John said &quot;I mean... I&#39;ve been busy or convinced I was delusional.&quot;<br />
Jane chuckled and said &quot;Oh you&#39;ll find that the two of them are a lot better as friends than they were when they were ripping each other&#39;s throats out.... so.... many... instances...&quot; <br />
&quot;So, Why are you here? What finally made you take some time out of your busy schedule!?! I can find my way back home!&quot; Merica screamed. <br />
Jane said &quot;Right.... I figured since you did just get your powers I&#39;d come and give you... a trial of fire of sorts. Don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; <br />
Merica said &quot;That&#39;s all? Why ev-&quot; and then she vanished. <br />
John asked &quot;So what have we done to her?&quot; <br />
Jane smirked and said &quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s just doing a little &quot;sparring&quot; against me. That all said, mind if I asked you to do some house sitting in the future? Don&#39;t worry it&#39;ll take no time and could be considered a little vacation.&quot; <br />
&quot;Do I have any choice?&quot; <br />
Jane tilted her head and said &quot;Technically you can choose whatever you want, but you are going to say yes... so kinda but really no.&quot; <br />
Sighing John said &quot;Just do it then... the forced time travel or whatever.&quot; <br />
Jane said &quot;Oh how I miss being so naive. Alright there you go!&quot; and at that point John noticed something odd about herself... That Jane while looking at her in the eyes seemed to be doing it out of formality... something about the gaze like she had already seen this conversation and was looking elsewhen... It was eerie. Then John went to whenever Jane had decided she would go. <br />
<br />
In the time stream John got that time traveling was something completely different from just fast forwarding time really fast. It wouldn&#39;t affect the other priestesses, and that to use it you needed to know when are where you were going or... problems could occur... Still a creeping dread occurred to John that she may not stick the landing... And then she arrived at her destination.</p>
