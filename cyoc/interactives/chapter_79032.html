<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The humming grew louder in his ears, and BAM! Daniel's clothes vanished. He was left stark naked in the middle of the room. He could move his limbs again, and started to walk, annoyed, when he slammed into an invisible wall at the edge of the blue circle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what's going on here?&quot; He figured he had been trapped in some sort of force field. Embarrassed, even though there was no one around, he tried to cover his nudity as he hollered out for Doctor Laura. No one answered.<br />
<br />
His hairless, thin frame was not used to exposure, and Daniel began to shiver. He wasn't out of shape, but at least he had had a tan. Daniel was surprised, then, when he saw his skin turn pale, to a nearly bright white. His penis also began to melt into his body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did want to become a girl for a while.&quot;<br />
<br />
The humming sound changed to a muffled 'woob woob'.<br />
<br />
Daniel knew something had gone wrong when the melting continued down his legs. They had become numb. Unable to stand, Daniel fell to his knees, where they splattered a bit on the cold floor. Craning his head around, he was able to see the soles of his flattening feet as his toes melted into each other. His whole bone structure was becoming loose and flaccid, melting into a solid mass. Daniel poked at his legs, but they were no longer distinct. They felt a little like cake dough...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell is going on here?! I'm turning into a cake?&quot; His butt connected to the soles of his feet, melding into a solid shape. It continued to round out, tapering up to his waist. From his bellybutton up, he maintained his human shape, but he could feel himself getting all doughey.<br />
<br />
Daniel was now little more than a white human torso sticking out of a round cake base. He bent his arms up to grab at his brown hair in despair. This was not what he had wanted. He clawed at his scalp, figuring out that he didn't have fingernails anymore. His arms were also bowing out, becoming more flexible, like the dough that they were rapidly becoming.<br />
<br />
He ran his fingers down his... cake base. He could still feel all over, the sensations were new and strange to him. He looked down at his chest. It was still lithe and muscular. He even still had nipples, but wondered how long they would last.<br />
<br />
The 'woob woob' sound became a static buzz. Daniel knew a new round of changes would soon follow... A mirror appeared on each of the four walls, and for the first time, Daniel saw his new body from every angle. He screamed in shock and dismay, impossibly shiny red lips opened in a primal shriek.<br />
<br />
He felt a tingle in his scalp, and saw his hair strands lump together into a gooey brown frosting. A sharp sensation throbbed on his scalp, and in the mirror he could watch as a giant strawberry grew from his head, cocked at an odd angle over his right shoulder. A mint leaf appeared next to it on the right. He reached up and felt this new addition. To his horror, the strawberry appeared to have his nerves... He could feel everything that was touching it.<br />
<br />
He thought he couldn't possibly take any more when two additional strawberries pushed themselves out from his hips, to either side. It felt orgasmic, and the pleasure Daniel felt went at odds with the fear going through his mind. He began to shout.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to become a cake! Hey! Let me out of here! I filled out the papers! I did everything right-&quot;<br />
<br />
His shouts were cut off by the swelling he began to feel in his chest. A pair of breasts were poking themselves out of his chest. They reached B-cup size before they stopped growing, but Daniel still felt an uncomfortable pressure. He squeezed at them tentatively, thankful that he had been allowed to keep his fingers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ung...&quot; He continued to squeeze, breath heaving, knowing that it was the only way to relieve the pressure. He also knew, somehow, that it would signal the end of this horrible transformation.<br />
<br />
The pressure burst suddenly. Like aerosol cans, Daniel's breasts pumped whipped cream out through his nipples, quickly covering the top of his chest. It was orgasmic, and he hated the fact that he enjoyed the feeling. When it was over, to his dismay, he realized he still had the breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;A sweet girl...&quot; he mused, dumbfounded and exhausted. He turned his torso and arms, examining his new cake form, as his pores sweat white frosting, covering him.<br />
<br />
Daniel had turned into a sweet, sweet girl. For the most part.</p>
