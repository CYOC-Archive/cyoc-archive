<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cowritten by O & Real History <br />
<br />
Ryomo coughed, a coppery taste in his mouth as he wiped his lips. Fukushu’s attack surprised the six tailed general. From his prone position, he now glanced at the rail cannons to view the damage.<br />
<br />
The cannons were smashed, reduced to twisted and charred metal. Ryomo’s troops scattered or dead, Fukushu’s attack acting as a massive bomb that devastated the attacking troops. While the left and center held fast, Ryomo’s right flank was now completely exposed. He needed to get up, to rally his troops and push forward. As he went to stand, he paused as two furry feet now stood in front of him.<br />
<br />
Raising his head, Ryomo now beheld Fukushu. The nine tails hikama was shredded, his furry upper body exposed with his pants torn and dirty. Somehow Fukushu had survived, the kitsune looking tired but ready to finish this fight.<br />
<br />
“You’re alive,” Ryomo whispered. “How?”<br />
<br />
“Because I can not fail.” Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
Ryomo simply nodded, grunting in pain as he rose to his knees.<br />
<br />
“I suppose you would finish me here.”<br />
<br />
Fukushu paused for a moment, his eyes locking with Ryomo&#39;s.<br />
<br />
“There has already been too much death,” he said, his voice low. “You have fought with honor. Recall your troops and leave.”<br />
<br />
Ryomo coughed, wiping blood from his mouth, a small smirk spreading across his face.<br />
<br />
“You know I can’t do that,” he grinned. “If you were in my place, you wouldn’t either. I choose a warriors death.”<br />
<br />
“So be it,” Fukushu sighed, slowly reaching down to assist Ryomo to his feet. The six tailed kitsune casting Fukushu an odd look. “I understand honor Ryomo,” Fukushu stated. “More than you could imagine. As a token of respect, I shall offer you a last request. Where do you wish to lose your life.”<br />
<br />
Ryomo paused, looking first to his soldiers still fighting before turning to Fukushu.<br />
<br />
“I have always wanted to watch the sunset set over the mountains of the capital,” he said. “Before you take my head, I wish to view the sunset...one last time.”<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded, the pair walking a short distance. Ryomo now kneeled, his eyes focusing on the setting sun. The six tail kitsunes eyes glossing over with tears.<br />
<br />
“It’s beautiful.”<br />
<br />
“It is.”<br />
<br />
Ryomo nodded, stretching out his neck. “I have always wanted to meet you,” Ryomo said softly. “To meet the legendary Fukushu. Ever since I was a boy, I listened to stories of your deeds. The greatest warrior our people have ever known. It is an honor to fall before your blade.”<br />
<br />
“The honor is mine,” Fukushu whispered. “You have fought with honor and shall be remembered by your people. I will ensure your family is able to give you a proper burial.”<br />
<br />
Ryomo nodded, the six tail taking a breath. Instead of taking his head, Fukushu now knelt before him, his legendary blade, the Death of Conflict gripped in his head.<br />
<br />
“I will make it quick,” Fukushu stated, pressing the blade to Ryomo’s chest. “When you are ready.”<br />
<br />
Ryomo nodded, a single tear rolling down his cheek. Fukushu would not desecrate his body, instead stabbing the kitsune through the heart. By doing so, Ryomo’s people would be able to view his body and say goodbye. Nodding his head, the kitsune gazed at the mountains as he awaited death.<br />
<br />
In a quick motion, Fukushu now pierced the kitsunes heart. A slight gasp escaping Ryomo’s lips.<br />
<br />
“Beautiful,” Ryomo whispered as his body fell lifeless. Fukushu now held the body for a moment, gently lowering the kitsune to the ground. In death, Ryomo seemed at peace.<br />
<br />
Slowly standing, the nine tail kitsune offered a prayer for Ryomo’s soul before gazing at the setting sun. This battle was at an end. All that remained was informing Hinata’s forces of the death of their general.<br />
<br />
His attention turned immediately to the distance. To Hinata. She was supposed to have been dealt with by his wife and her team. He assumed the worst and vowed to make her pay. She was fast, appearing right in front of him, but he was expecting this. He was fast too. Unlike the attack on his wife and her forces, she would not be able to win this fight with speed and surprise blitzes. She did not attack or draw her sword yet, neither did Fukushu. He stared down at the black and white vixen. Their gazes fixed on each other and both of their auras caused cracks to form in the earth beneath their paws and a the remaining soldiers around them were rendered unconscious.<br />
<br />
“Fukushu-sama.” Hinata bowed slightly.<br />
<br />
“Ayasa-san. We meet again. You’ve been busy since we last encountered each other all those years ago.” Fukushu replied firmly.<br />
<br />
“Hai. The Normal is gone but it appears today I must finish my mission to kill you. Know that I hold no hatred for you or your family. I am simply doing what must be done.” Hinata explained.<br />
<br />
“I can’t say the same. I have grown to hate you, Hinata Ayasa. You attacked my family, kill my people and slaughter my soldiers, and raze my lands. I do not care what the Tentai no chitsujo say, you are nothing, a blight on our people. I will defeat you.” Fukushu explained.<br />
<br />
“So be it.” Hinata finished.<br />
<br />
Both kitsune unsheathed their katanas. The blade of Hinata’s Moonslayer glowed an ethereal light. Fukushu unsheathed Funs&#333; no shi, his legendary sword.<br />
<br />
Hinata had heard many stories and legends of the sword of The Legendary Angel of Vengeance. But looking upon it she could see that is was an ordinary sword. No unique guard or handle, even the scabbard was a simple black. Fukushu noticed her eyes on his sword and smirked.<br />
<br />
“Disappointed? I don’t need a fancy sword with special powers. My sword’s strength, like my own, comes from years of training and experience. Funs&#333; no shi is an ordinary sword, I make it legendary.” He explained.<br />
<br />
“I didn’t choose Moonslayer for its power.” Hinata defended.<br />
<br />
“I know very well why you wield that sword. I know of its previous wielder.” Fukushu replied.<br />
<br />
“If it’s any consolation; your Wife and the children are still breathing.” Hinata explained.<br />
<br />
“That’s your mistake.” He replied.<br />
<br />
The two clashed and sent shockwaves through the battlefield. Fukushu struck her with the back of his blade, sending her flying into a nearby mountain. He was on her the second she landed. He was much more experienced and pounded on her relentlessly. Hinata barely dodged and deflected his attacks. The black and white kitsune attempted to create distance with her foxfire but Fukushu used his own fire to choke her’s. Hinata countered an attack and slashed an arc of energy at the fox man and he jumped into the air to dodge it. The arc kept moving and carved clean through the land behind them. Their lock broke and they landed on two opposing towers on the city walls. The vixen’s sword glowed brightly as she prepared another attack. Fukushu’s tails began to move as if made of fire, his own foxfire seemed to consume him. He pumped at her and she did the same and swing her sword with everything she had. The two colored an a violent, bight shockwave echoed outward, destroying a large chunk of the wall and sending two towers crumbling downward. Hinata and Fukushu both landed in nearby.<br />
<br />
“You are destroying these lands!” Fukushu scolded.<br />
<br />
“You are! Your lords care nothing for the people! I will bring prosperity and peace to these lands!” Hinata argued.<br />
<br />
“Says the naive, warmongering child lashing out at the world!” He added.<br />
<br />
The two engaged again, both fought with lightning speed attacks, they zipped through the battlefield. Onlookers couldn’t make out anything but flashes of light and a blur of motion. They continued like this until Fukushu got the upper hand and managed to deliver a devastating blow, sending the vixen flying into another tower. Then the tower exploded into foxfire and multiple arcs of energy shot out in quick succession, Fukushu deflected two and could have easily dodged the rest but instead he rushed in front of each arc, blocking them and ensuring they wouldn’t continue outward and rip up more of the city. After blocking the final slash he shot out a fire blast at the rubble that was the tower Hinata stood in. The vixen jumped into the air and countered with her own foxfire but the more experienced kitsune cut them in half before rushing right at her. The two’s blades made contact and sent out another shockwave. When they landed Hinata went on the offensive but was quickly overpowered by Fukushu and she soon found herself back on the defensive.<br />
<br />
“You have some talent, child. But it will not be enough to beat me.” Fukushu stated.<br />
<br />
Hinata didn’t respond, she flipped and kicked him as she did so. She landed in the inner city, luckily the people had been evacuated and no more of Fukushu’s people would be caught in the crossfire. Hinata then held her katana behind her, parallel to her body. The fox man rushed to engage but the second he was in front of her she brought up her sword and unleashed an upward pillar of force. This attack landed and shot up Fukushu into the air. She jumped at him and attempted to land a slew of slices but he had already recovered and blocked her attack. She tried to use a chi strike with her index and middle finger but he dodged and grabbed her arm and tossed her into the castle’s small cherry blossom garden.<br />
<br />
Hinata’s body slammed into the earth, leaving a deep trail that ended in a small crater, her slide was stopped by the thick body of a tree. She coughed a large amount of blood and pulled herself up. Fukushu landed near her and the two briefly engaged but Hinata was beginning to feel the effects of her injuries. Fukushu then landed two strikes before delivering a final punch that launched her back into the tree. He was standing over her instantly, he delivered another slash across her chest. Her sword fell to the ground, her hand slick with blood.<br />
<br />
“You know…this place was my brothers favorite…now it too has been claimed by senseless war.” Fukushu said.<br />
<br />
“T-Then…I guess it’s bet-better that Cassidy died…at least he’s been spared to s-see his daughter killed...” Hinata coughed.<br />
<br />
“You knew you couldn’t win. You couldn’t defeat me, how did you hope to face my father?” He replied preparing to land a final strike.<br />
<br />
“I-I have nobody…n-nothing…This was my only p-path…J…J-Just do it…” Hinata wheezed as she lost her strength.<br />
<br />
Fukushu nodded silently, he straightened his stance and prepared to bring down his blade.<br />
<br />
“Ot&#333;chan…please!” She suddenly cried.<br />
<br />
This stopped Fukushu’s attack. Those words, they were the same last words Raiden had spoken. He saw Hinata was crying, her eyes were glassy and tears streamed down her face.<br />
<br />
“O-Ot&#333;chan…t-the One-Eyed Ronin is here to kill me…” she whispered.<br />
<br />
Fukushu shook his head and prepared to strike again. She was calling for her father—or her adopted father, the deceased Normal agent, Cassidy. Clearly the young vixen was seeing things, she was losing blood,<br />
<br />
“…y-you’ll protect me…w-won’t you O-Ot&#333;chan…I-I-I t-tried my b-best…I tried…h-he’s going to kill me…you’ll…protect…me…you…a-always…d-do…” Hinata said, her voice becoming faint.<br />
<br />
“Stop!” Mason called out.<br />
<br />
The kitsune turned to see his nieces and nephew running towards the pair.<br />
<br />
“Stay back. Let me finish this.” Fukushu growled.<br />
<br />
“Stop uncle! She’s beaten. Just stop the killing!” Haley begged.<br />
<br />
“Please. Nobody else has to die!.” Kari added.<br />
<br />
“Enough out of you three! If you aren’t ready for the reality of war then you never should have come here.” Fukushu scolded, “This monster nearly killed you all, you would spare her life?!”<br />
<br />
“But she didn’t!” Mason argued.<br />
<br />
“Then she lacks conviction. You must be willing to kill your enemy if you wish to win.” The fox barked.<br />
<br />
“Are you saying you wanted her to kill us?” Haley asked.<br />
<br />
Fukushu shot them a fierce and stern look and Haley relented, immediately regretting her words. She turned to her siblings.<br />
<br />
“Look. I may be new to all of this but I know what’s right. You can’t just kill her in cold blood. That won’t solve anything! It will just ensure the cycle of death continues forever!” Mason plead.<br />
<br />
“You are too soft Mason. You wanted to be like your siblings—to be a kitsune. Then you must follow our ways.” Fukushu explained.<br />
<br />
“Not like this! This isn&#39;t what it means to be a kitsune and you of all people should know that!” Mason snapped.<br />
<br />
Kari and Haley looked at Mason surprised. Then they looked to each other and stood with Mason. Fukushu was about to bring down his blade and end Hinata when his wife appeared.<br />
<br />
“What will be your choice beloved? Will you show mercy or will you give her a death she believes she has been seeking?” Abolith asked her husband.<br />
<br />
“You would suggest mercy?” Fukushu replied quietly.<br />
<br />
“I cannot give you my answer, the choice must be left entirely left up to you. But look closely at her before you make a decision.” The elf said and motioned at the bloody vixen at their feet.<br />
<br />
Fukushu stood there looking between Abolith, Hinata, and his nephew and nieces, he then looked past the young trio and saw the image of his deceased brother Raiden standing there looking sorrowful. Mason saw this and turned his head to see what his uncle was looking at and his eyes went wide in surprise as he didn&#39;t say anything but could see Raiden standing there as well.<br />
<br />
Fukushu got onto one knee as he plunged his sword into the ground and took heavy breaths.<br />
<br />
&quot;I will spare her life, but what shall we do with her then? Throw her in the dungeon? Keep her prisoner?&quot; Fukushu asked.<br />
<br />
“Everybody needs someone to bring them back to the light uncle.” Kari said as she came to his side.<br />
<br />
“And you want me to be that person? To bring Hinata ‘into the light’? I cannot do that.” He huffed.<br />
<br />
“No, but we can.” Haley said as she and Mason went over to Hinata&#39;s side.<br />
<br />
Mason was crouched over Hinata. He had retrieved Moonslayer and placed it in the vixen’s bloody hands.<br />
<br />
“You don’t have to fight for anyone anymore. You can fight for yourself. And you don’t have to be alone anymore.” He said.<br />
<br />
Hinata seemed to smile slightly before she passed out. Once she did she assumed her human form. Now a black haired, 17 year old Japanese girl lay in the crater. Her wounds seemed to heal in a golden glow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can carry her back to the palace, she should be treated like a person, not an enemy or a monster.&quot; Haley said as she lifted Hinata up in her arms.<br />
<br />
Fukushu now watched as Mason, Kari, and Haley all walked off while carrying Hinata.<br />
<br />
&quot; &#39;In a battle of Gods only those that walk between two worlds shall stand victorious.&#39;&quot; Fukushu said aloud as Abolith heard him.<br />
<br />
&quot;That prophecy the mystics spoke of? Do you think they really foresaw this?&quot; Abolith asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe.....they saw those who would have the greatest kindness in their hearts.&quot; Fukushu said as they began to follow Mason, Kari, and Haley.<br />
<br />
So ended the kitsune civil war that day, not with a sword, but with three sympathetic hands.</p>
