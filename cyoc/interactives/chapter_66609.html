<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>As the two couples parted ways, Chuck looked over to Rick and smiled, happy that he was together with his lover. Even though Rick lived 
right across the street, since Rick really enjoyed having his own space, Chuck felt like they were worlds apart and hated being separated from 
Rick for any period of time. Heck, if Chuck could have it his way, the two of them would be surgically bound to one another so that they could 
always be together. Chuck knew that this thought was a bit on the extreme side of things, but Chuck knew that love was never a practical 
emotion, making a person desire things outside of what was “ordinary”. Happy that they were together again, Chuck tightly squeezed Rick in a 
tight, sideways embrace. Rick smiled knowing that his lover was happy that they were together and didn’t mind how Chuck showed his 
affection. It was a very welcomed thing for Rick since he had been alone for some time, raising Brendan on his own. </Br>
<Br>Rick looked at Chuck and smiled, then said “I missed you too baby!” in a soft tone, but excited tone.</Br>
<Br> “I’m glad to hear that… at first it sounded like you didn’t even remember how much time we have spent together over the years, getting 
to know one another better than any couple could.” Chuck replied as he was looking down at the ground, trying not to let his emotions get the 
best of him and cry like the big softy that he was inside.</Br>
<Br>Rick stopped while grabbing Chuck’s arm, stopping him too and then pulling Chuck in closer to him.</Br>
<Br> “Look at me.” Rick said softly, wanting to see Chuck’s face and look him in the eyes.</Br>
<Br>Chuck just stood there, head down, eyes on the pavement trying not to look at Rick to keep from crying.</Br>
<Br>Sensing how Chuck was feeling from his original reaction, Rick softly placed his right hand under Chuck’s chin and raised his head so Rick 
could look into his eyes lovingly. Looking into his partner’s eyes, he saw something deep within him and Rick dove in for a soft, yet sensual 
kiss, that Chuck was surprised by, but welcomed all the same. As the two kissed, Chuck and Rick let themselves go, getting lost in their 
passion and showed each other love that neither of them could have ever expected.</Br>
<Br>As the kiss finally ended, they slowly pulled apart from one another and looked at each other deeply, connecting on a level never 
experienced by either of them before and Chuck smiled, showing off his pearly whites as well as his slightly longer bicuspids. Being satisfied 
that his man missed him, Chuck started walking back toward his door, leading Rick there behind him, while holding his hand the entire time.
</Br>
<Br>As Chuck opened the door and stepped in, he took in a deep breath and sighed, then grabbed Rick in a tight embrace and said “God… I 
missed you so much!” while closing the door behind them.</Br>
<Br>”I missed you too!” Rick exclaimed, smiling lovingly and continued, “I really hate when we have to be separated like we have been lately. I 
know that you are always busy with work and I have stuff with Brendan, not to mention having my son live with me, it puts a kink into things 
and it just sucks!”</Br>
<Br>”I know, I know, but we are here together right now and that is all that matters!” Chuck said as he embraced Rick tightly against his 
muscular chest and rubbing Rick’s back, trying to console him as best as he could.</Br>
<Br>Finally being with his man after so long, feeling comfortable and safe in Chuck’s embrace, Rick nuzzled his face into Chuck’s chest and 
cooed comfortably. All Chuck could do was smile, feeling the same way Rick did inside, but because they were together… Chuck could feel his 
wolfish side wanting to come out and play. Standing there with Rick, Chuck began feeling more and more frisky, knowing that this was a 
perfect opportunity for them to have a little physical fun together and Chuck definitely did not want to let it go to waste. As the two stood 
together, Chuck slowly moved his embrace so that his hands were resting on Rick’s butt cheeks, in perfect position for a grab now and then. 
Curious to see what Rick’s reaction would be, hoping that it would stir something in Rick, Chuck squeezed both globes and Rick growled, 
which was the response Chuck was hoping for.</Br>
<Br>Getting turned on by Chuck’s playfulness, Rick moved his right hand on top of Chuck’s enormous bulge, feeling how Chuck was and how 
much more that he was getting. Images of Chuck’s beer bottle thick cock and baseball sized balls flashed in Rick’s mind, making him smile, 
knowing that he was going to be able to enjoy himself as much as he had in the past. Wanting to toy with Chuck a bit, he thought of the perfect 
question to ask.</Br>
<Br> “So… have you been saving up for me or have you taken care of that on your own?” Rick asked with a sly, sexy grin.</Br>
<Br> “Well, being away for as long as I was this past time, I took care of it on my own. Although, since I knew I was going to be home since the 
day before yesterday, I have been saving myself up for you… that is if you want it!” Chuck said in reply, knowing exactly how to push Rick’s 
buttons.</Br>
<Br>Since they had been together for so long, Rick became the type of guy to enjoy cum somewhat, when he had been uptight about it for so 
long before. It wasn’t up until a few years ago that Rick opened up and started to really enjoying having gay sex. They met over seven years 
ago at a gay bar when Rick was super shy about himself and questioning who he was. At that time Rick had a woman in his life so that he could 
appear normal to anyone who questioned who Rick was. She already had a son, which was where Brendan came into the picture, from a 
previous relationship. When Brendan came out to them both, Rick knew that he needed to start being true to himself, Brendan and his mother. 
The thing was, she couldn’t handle the truth and abandoned Brendan by just up and leaving unexpectedly one day. So, Rick took Brendan in 
and eventually moved to the town that they lived in, which was a special community. The community was for gay men and furries, which was 
perfect because both Rick and Brendan were gay furries, even though they didn’t know about it themselves. Chuck and Brendan’s boyfriend, 
Johnny, knew about it because of their pointed ears. That was the one thing that all furries of their kind had in common when in human form to 
be able to distinguish themselves apart. Since Chuck was naturally a curious person, he asked questions in a cautious way, just so he could get 
some answers. Chuck found out through his questioning that up until they met, Rick and Brendan hadn’t heard about furries or that, they 
themselves, were furries. When Chuck explained it to both of them, Brendan and Rick were ok with the fact that they were furries and that it 
would explain the ears. The thing was, they had no clue what being a furry actually meant, but Chuck was going to show Rick what being a 
furry really meant and he had convinced Johnny to do the same thing for Brendan the next time that they were together.</Br>
<Br>Hearing Chuck’s response, Rick chuckled, knowing that he was going to get exactly what he had been wanting since Chuck had to leave 
for his job.</Br>
<Br> “That is good to hear because, to be completely honest, I have been missing that!” Rick said with a huge grin.</Br>
<Br> “Man… to think several years ago you couldn’t stand the stuff and now you can’t seem to get enough of it! The thing is, I have a surprise 
to show you and this surprise will help give you more of my cream!” Chuck said while toying with Rick a bit.</Br>
<Br> “Oh… what surprise could that be? Did you get some miracle pill to make you cum twice as much?” Rick asked with a shit faced grin.
</Br>
<Br> “Nope, but I know you will enjoy it a lot and it makes me cum four times as much… so I hope you are ready for it!” Chuck said grinning 
from pointed ear to pointed ear.</Br>
<Br> “Four times as much… now I have got to see this!” Rick said as wide eyed as a kid on Christmas morning when he saw all the new 
presents under the tree from Santa.</Br>
<Br> “Oh… you will and if you want, you can see it right now!” Chuck said, feeling on the verge of transforming in the first place.</Br>
<Br>This secret has been one of the hardest things to keep from Rick because there had been several times where Chuck accidentally let out a 
little of the wolf when they had made passionate love in the past. It has never been more than a deeper, gruffer voice; more stubble; or even a 
growl. In every case, Rick just thought it was normal for Chuck and loved that he was trying to be even sexier for him.</Br>
<Br> “Ok, well let me see this surprise of yours!” Rick replied enthusiastically.</Br>
<Br> “Well… if you want to see it, you got to keep me worked up!” Chuck said, lying to Rick because he could shift right then and there, but it 
was a lot more pleasurable if he, or any of them for that matter, was being pleasured when shifting.</Br>
<Br> “Hehe, that definitely won’t be a problem for me!” Rick said while he fondled Chuck’s large bulge, taunting him further.</Br>
<Br>Wanting to see this big, special surprise, Rick slowly caressed Chuck’s bulge through his denim shorts, rubbing up and down as if he was 
petting it. </Br>
<Br>Not being able to hold it back any longer, wanting Rick to know what furries really were, Chuck let out a loud and lust filled growl. In a 
deeper and guttural voice Chuck said, “You are definitely going to get what you asked for!”</Br>
<Br>Slowly, Chuck’s already impressively muscled body increased in size and bulk, pushing his clothes past the point that seams could hold 
the fabric together. Rick’s eyes grew wider, unsure of what he was seeing and in total disbelief, thinking he had to be in a really vivid dream. As 
body stopped growing in size, Chuck pulled the pieces of cloth that were just resting on his skin, off of his body and let it fall to the floor 
beneath his feet.</Br>
<Br>Wanting to toy with Rick a bit more, Chuck spoke briefly. “If you think this is amazing, which from the look on your face you do, there is 
more to come which is the secret all of us furries share!”</Br>
<Br>Hearing that, Rick’s heart skipped a couple beats, knowing that since he was a furry he would go through a metamorphosis like his lover 
was going through at that moment. As Rick stood there with his hand still on Chuck’s crotch that was barely containing his even bigger 
package, Chuck started letting all of his wolf come out to play.</Br>
<Br>Slowly his already sexy and slightly furry: upper torso, arms and legs all started getting furrier as medium and dark brown sprouted all 
over his body, covering him in what looked like fur. Seeing this, Rick’s cock jumped to attention and became harder than anything he had ever 
felt before. With Chuck’s true self coming out, something deep down in Rick woke up and started pushing its way to the surface as well. Slowly, 
Chuck’s teeth grew longer, thicker and sharper as both sets of K-9s grew into fangs; while at the same time both his fingernails and toenails 
lengthened and curled slightly forming claws. Rick began feeling his heartbeat increase in speed and ferocity, feeling like it was going to rip 
out of his chest. Then something started happening to Chuck’s body all at once. His hands and feet shifted into paws, with soft, but thick black 
pads; his ears grew more pointed and shifted further up his head as his face pushed out into a muzzle; his nose following while flattening and 
growing darker. Then suddenly Chuck’s underwear got even tighter as his cock and balls swelled while his fluffy wolfish tail grew out from the 
base of his spine, directly above his tail hole. Rick could not believe what he saw! Not only was his lover a werewolf, but his cock was 
something that words couldn’t describe. Chuck only gained about a half inch to his seven inch long cock, but his girth nearly doubled in size 
from being as big as a coke can to being a Foster’s can of beer, while his balls went from being large eggs to a base ball each. From seeing just 
how big Chuck’s balls really were, Rick knew that was the exact reason he said there would be four times as much.</Br>
<Br>As Rick stood there wide eyed, looking the new werewolf Chuck up and down, Rick noticed that Chuck’s cock was steadily dripping pre 
onto the floor and Rick wanted a taste. Rick absolutely loved the taste of pre and enjoyed the taste of cum just as much, but he hesitated not 
really knowing what to expect next.</Br>
<Br>“Go ahead, lick it up love… I know you love the stuff and I am sure you are dying to nurse on my cock.” Chuck said in an even gruffer 
tone, which surprised Rick because he didn’t think Chuck would even be able to speak how he was.</Br>
<Br> “I… I don’t even know if I can! It is huge, which I am not complaining about, but it looks like it would be a challenge!” Rick said grinning, 
not realizing how close his furry self was from making itself present now.</Br>
<Br> “Well, just start licking and I am sure in no time you will have it in your mouth like I know you want it to be!” Chuck said.</Br>
<Br>Trusting Chuck completely, like he had always been able to, Rick stuck his tongue out and let the pre bead on it, sending his taste buds 
into overload. Chuck’s pre was even better in his wolf form; it was like it was purer somehow, being sweet and filled with several different 
flavors, none of which Rick could place a finger on. Feeling different already, Rick sensed something buried in him awakening, clawing its way 
to the surface. Rick decided to give it a complete try, wanting Chuck in his mouth and not wanting to wait any longer for it to be there. Rick put 
both of his lips up to the massive, drizzling head and drank Chuck’s pre directly from his cock, as if he was drinking the contents of his balls 
directly through the straw that was his cock. With it resting at the opening of his lips, Rick pushed forward slightly and got the entire head past 
his lips and into his hungry mouth. Curious to see how far he could go, Rick pushed himself further little by little with every downward bob, 
until it was surprisingly all the way in his mouth and partially down his throat. It was weird for Rick because he normally would have gagged 
from the sheer size, but it seemed like his mouth was built to withstand something like Chuck’s cock.</Br>
<Br>As Rick continued nursing on the cock, pouring pre into him, his body felt sore and itchy all at the same time. It felt like if his body was 
swelling and his body hair was growing all at once. Rick groaned as he felt a wave of pleasure overwhelm him.</Br>
<Br> “Oh Rick! You are doing such a good job and I can see that your wolf is already coming out to play!” Chuck growled lustfully.</Br>
<Br>Just like Chuck had said, Rick was shifting into his werewolf form for the very first time. Rick’s muscles swelled to power-lifter 
proportions, while medium brown fur flowed over his body like a freely flowing river. His hands and feet shifted into paws as his finger and 
toenails lengthened and curled slightly forming his claws. Just like Chuck, his body outgrew his clothes and ripped through them, leaving them 
in tatters on the floor. However, unlike with Chuck, Rick’s cock grew and balls grew as his body grew. Suddenly, a wave of mixed feelings 
overwhelmed Rick as his face pushed out into a snout, while his ears grew pointier, shifting further up his head and his tail grew from the base 
of his spine for the first time. As the changes stopped, Rich felt a massive rush of euphoria and pleasure wash over his body, which was when 
he realized he climaxed without ever having touched his cock and balls, which were slightly larger than Chucks, emptying about a gallon or 
more of cum onto the wood floor beneath them.</Br>
<Br> “Well… I am glad you got off, but I hope you aren’t going to stop short of me getting off!” Chuck said chuckling to himself, knowing that 
his lover wouldn’t do something like that to him.</Br>
<Br>Having gotten the hint, Rick continued working Chuck’s cock, realizing how much having the wolf muzzle would help work Chuck’s cock. 
Slowly, Rick continued his motions, using his entire muzzle to fully massage Chuck’s massive shaft and before he knew it, Chuck howled as his 
balls drew close to him, emptying his built up load into Rick, which he drank down fully and hungrily. As Rick could feel Chuck’s cock start to 
soften, he knew that the torrent was over and the softening member plopped out of his muzzle with a wet plop. Feeling better than he ever 
had, Chuck petted Rick on his head in appreciation for his lover helping him out. </Br>
<Br>“So… what do you think of us in our wolf forms?” Chuck asked Rick.</Br>
<Br> “I absolutely love it and I can’t wait for Brendon to experience this!” Rick said excitedly.</Br>
<Br>Chuck thought to himself <em>Oh, he will lover, he will! In fact, Johnny should be helping him get there now!</em></Br></p>
