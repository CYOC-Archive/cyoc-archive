<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I stood there and watched as what was my face and form now belonging to this demon from Hell did walk away. Bleating my simple thoughts and fears only bade him laugh at me. Yet in my mind and from the heart came fears and terrors not yet born upon mankind. <br />
<br />
&quot;Zandus Havalot,&quot; a name which will go down in history while he changed its course in removing those who might make a difference. It is for men and women he seeks that have greatness yet buried deep lust for the release of feelings so dark that none darn let them be known.<br />
<br />
Ah, but Zandus havalot will seek those deep and dark seeded longings! He shall offer ways to urge them out and once upon the open air suggest to those who would wish to now and have.<br />
<br />
Money is no object of concern as Zandus enter the small town of Colbyshire. A town once long ago the seat of a kingdom which had gone to ruin by the finding of an amulet. It was the discovery of such powers that changed a young and brave knight into a jet black stallion. He had only to lust over the sight of his poor mount Lena as she stood shivering one night racked in sexual and beastly heat.<br />
<br />
The young soldier's Captain discoved and reasoned out what had happened to his brave scout and knight. He took with him both a happy and satisfied Lena, plus her one time master and now a stallion lover to return to Colbyshire. &quot;Tiri,&quot; as the old story goes was the knight then made stallion. His own life was changed from human existence to that of a rational thinking stallion now born to know true beastly life.<br />
<br />
A small but worthy shop looked to Zandus as a fine beginning and thus he entered the front door ready. A middle aged man looked up from his work in repairing watches as Zandus walked in the front door. His plan was simple yet dyed in blackness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good day to you Sir!&quot; Zandus might have said as he greeted his prey.<br />
A conversation ensued that was not reported to me but I would imagine that Zandus had the upper hand. <br />
<br />
An offer to buy the establishment fell far short of the owner's hope of retirement and riches. Then as Zandus smiled he made an offer dipped in trechery and born of demonic evils. A offer to the man, his dear wife and any children still living at home to pack up and travell the open road to a new beginning. He bade them hope for fairer skies, blessed lives, and an easier load for the old man to bare.<br />
<br />
A bright glow no doubt opened over the man's face seeing his heart desire and eeking the deep thoughts of being lazy while reaping enough to carry on in life.<br />
<br />
Soon enough the man introduced his wife and daughter to Zandus. It was that night at dinner when the man and his wife sought Zandus for details on his wonderful offer. An offer which Zandus had considered the whole day long. Knowing where the three might be placed as the need for history to not lose those removed from humanity. They must still live out lives but as what, now that was for Zandus to decide.<br />
<br />
Earlier that day as he walked the town streets in search of a shop to base his evil deeds, he sought the right place to drop those lives which were in his way of conquest.<br />
<br />
As the people's daughter went off to bed the two old people sat seeking from Zandus his offer. So as he too sat there by the fireplace  his great book was opened and two lives were soon to be snuffed.<br />
<br />
A long line of words flowed out into the air as the man and his wife looked at Zandus and then at each other wondering what was being said? As Zandus came to the final end of his spell casting he closed the book and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don't understand your spoken words, Sir!&quot; know doubt said the man.<br />
As he reached for the teacup his dear wife let out a blood cruddleing scream.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pa, your hand!' she cried out. <br />
<br />
Indeed his hand and then his arm began to change. The forelorn look of happy times ahead now turned to a face filled with wretchid terror of who was in his hallowed home.<br />
<br />
As the man stood up he rebuked the evil man who sat by his fireside. It was his last few words he spoke as lips thickened, face and head swelled and changed. Arms and shoulders followed as then his chest barreled out. His wife tried to scream for help but her voice changed as did the neck and throat. A whined little whinny issured her changing mouth.<br />
<br />
In the minutes that followed a sound of clothes tearing from bodies expanding as dark power from hell itself urged on their changes. A pop of the man's belt made Zandus smile as then the sound came from upstairs of the approach of a girl worried of what she was hearing downstairs.<br />
<br />
Legs and muscles firmed up and standing before Zandus was the man and his wife both mature and sound draft horses for his ultimate pleasure. Docile they stood there as if born in those forms. Each seeing but with the mass of new feelings both minds were drowning in new and strange sensations.<br />
<br />
What was the girl's thoughts as she peered down from the stairs to see two Belgian draft horses standing near the fireplace and Zandus calmly sitting before them. A scene out a story book with tattered clothing strewn about and two huge animals standing where no horse had ever stood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come, come down my child!&quot; beckoned Zandus.<br />
<br />
Slowly the girl came down the steps. At last she stood to the rear of what was once her dear mother, now a large equine mare. A hand reached up and as she walked down the side of this huge beast she smoothed along its hairy hide.<br />
<br />
&quot;What have you done? Are these horses my parents cursed by you?&quot; asked the girl as she knew it was the only reasonable answer.<br />
<br />
A slow motions nod of agreement came from Zandus as he then motioned for her to sit where her Father had minutes before.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was what they had hoped for now so many years, my dear! Your dear Father was tired of his work and sought for easier times and a life which for him and his wife. He'd of asked me for to make enough to get by and only wanted to know that his daughter was taken care of and lived in happiness. Now they are contented, their life ahead is one of easy work and much time spent in reflection. Their mind and memories are for now unchanged as they know me and you all so well. So as they are and shall till death remain it was their delight to see and know of your life be happy and filled with passion as they did know!&quot; said Zandus as horses snuffled and the girl stood rubbing her mother's now fuzzy chin.<br />
<br />
Zandus opened his book and reading yet another demonic call of power the girl began to moan.</p>
