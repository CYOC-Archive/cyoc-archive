<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elisthia cocked her head in confusion as she looked at the painting. Jayrenn knelt down at her side and met her at the fox’s eye level. “Is there something you haven’t told us, Elisthia?” There was a hint of doubt in her tone, but her question was asked calmly. <br />
<br />
“I know not my lady, truly!” She stammered in confusion. “Was this… the last mistress of the tower?”<br />
<br />
“The last mistress?” Asked Leahala as she sipped the potion in her grip, slowly knitting her wounds together and healing their scar tissue. “But you told me before that this realm was the outcome of my imagination… did I also imagine a whole history of this place too?” She raised a brown. <br />
<br />
“I… I don’t know.” Repeated the fox. “But I remember things! The dances in the ballroom, a book in my lap as I curled up with a blanket in the study on a cold winter’s night, enchanting artifacts in the foundry…” her voice cracked. She looked down at her paws.<br />
<br />
“I remember I lived here with my elderly parents. A wife. A daughter… I was loved, happy…”<br />
<br />
Leahala bent over and sat beside Elisthia, who sat in her lap. “I’m so sorry… I didn’t even think…”<br />
<br />
“You couldn’t have known.” Elisthia replied. “Even I couldn’t have. I believed that this place started with you as well. I just… awoke like this one day, and from that first moment I understood my purpose, to be castillan here and serve the tower’s new mistress… you.”<br />
<br />
“Well… can’t I free you of your obligation somehow? If you were a living person… then the role you’ve been given is just wrong. Barely any different from slavery even!” Leahala asked.<br />
<br />
“I- I’m not sure my lady. If I may make a suggestion? Perhaps you could assign me to research a way to reverse my condition? I am incapable of having the initiative to do the reading on my own, but if I were instructed to… I think I might know where to start.”<br />
<br />
Leahala smiled. “Yes, please take as much time to that as you need. And you have all my help as well, should you need it.” She turned to Jayrenn. “Both of us, I think.”<br />
<br />
The wood elf smiled shyly. “I’m not good with books… but I’ll do what I can.”<br />
<br />
“That’s quite alright… we will doubtless need to locate some rather rate ingredients to perform the magic that could change me back. Your skills will be most valued there.”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of which… looks like we’ve taken our greenhouse back, but it’s…” she brooded over the labyrinth of shattered planters, mounds of spilt fertilizer, the withered flowers, and the pervasive reek of rotten vegetation. “A bit of a fixer upper.”<br />
<br />
“Yes indeed, but luckily, it’s already done so much to re-empower the tower. I can feel her stones and mortar shifting and expanding around us as we speak… another room has been added.” Elisthia chirped. “And its tenants will be coming sooner than later.”<br />
<br />
———————————<br />
A mere hour into the less than glamorous work of cleaning up the greenhouse, they watched as a golden glow enveloped the corpse of the blight tree in the middle of the arboretum. Jayrenn watched in awe as the source of corruption and evil burned away by the tower seemingly reclaiming its dignity. It glowed like a very brief star, before the pillar of illumination dimmed into nothing, and they saw something unmistakable standing in its place. A woman in regular earth street attire looked very confused and very frightened as she held up her hands to apparently protect her face from some oncoming force. <br />
<br />
She was fairly short, but sturdy, already with very wide hips, thick thighs, and a large bosom in advance of whatever transformation was inevitably about to morph her into the subject of her fantasies. She was dark skinned, with large, expressive brown eyes, and extremely frizzy, curly shoulder length brown hair. A smattering of freckles covered her cheeks.<br />
<br />
“Wha- what the fuck was that?! Where the hell am I?” She stood up, looking around her surroundings to make sense of her location and orient herself. As she dusted herself off, she adjusted a pair of glasses sitting on her nose bridge. By the time she’d done so, the two elves had quietly slipped around the corner to study their guest from a place of secrecy.<br />
<br />
“It’s really pretty… but holy shit it’s humid, and…”she wrinkled her nose. “Ugh! It smells nasty.” She told herself. At last she unclenched her left fist, revealing a crumpled piece of drawing paper, depicted on it was clearly an original Leah sketch. It was of a curvy and busty woman in a flowing gown reminiscent of a toga, it hung from one shoulder, and sat on her frame such that it left her right teat exposed to the open air. Far more noticeable though were her clearly goat-like hoofs, legs, tail, and horns, marking her out as a satyress. A tiara of woven branches and budding leaves nested on the crest of her forehead, and she mirthfully danced through the forest as she played the panflute.<br />
<br />
She stared down at the drawing then, bushing a little as she stuffed it in her pocket. Slowly started heading for the stairs down to the lower levels. “Uhh hello? Anybody home?!” She called out into the air as she began to explore. <br />
<br />
“How big is this place?” She wondered as she began aimlessly roving through the open foyer. She began to feel strange as she did so, like her legs full of energy just begging to be spent, urging her to leap, to frolic, to dance. Then, the human woman doubled over as though she’d been hit in the gut.<br />
<br />
“Holy shit Tanya… did something spike your brownies or something? Am I having some kind of reaction?” She interrogated herself as the human fell on her knees and started scratching her legs under the cuff of her jeans. She watched, paralyzed in shock as those pants started to rip and peel off her legs, and watched further as the muscle in her calves all seemed to migrate up to the thighs, giving her the appearance of thinner lower legs and that much wider thighs. She blinked a few times in astonishment as the magic worked up her wardrobe, shredding off her shirt and pulling back her jacket as she covered her mouth watching what she was seeing. She witnessed her bras give way with a snap as her D sized breasts erupted even larger, yet held themselves aloft with new miraculous muscles that supported such voluminous endowments. On instinct, she went to cover her chest with her arm, only for her to purr as her hand brushed her puffy, alert and attention-hungry nipples.  <br />
<br />
Her changes began to accelerate as she forgot any notions of getting help in exchange for the needs of here and now. Her rich, dark skin became supple and smooth, her upper body largely hairless. This was immediately contrasted by her legs, where a fluffy coat of thick, brown fur began to cover them from hips to toes. Her other hand was shortly plying her womanhood, her alarm melting away to bliss as she began rubbing the hood of her pearl and thrusting into her folds, cooing all the way, just as a short goat tail with a prominent white tuft on the end snaked out of her backside.<br />
<br />
Tanya bit her pouty lips and squeezed her eyes shut as her feet began to shrink and deform, the flesh hardening into a pair of hoofs, while a set of curly ram horns pushed out from her forehead. “I’m… I’m becoming her… Fuck yeah!” Chuckled the woman as she looked at her picture with a smirk, looking at the image pushing her on to stimulate herself even faster.  Her eyes with which she gazed on the page had become bright amber, and the glasses she wore turned from thick specks into a set of fantasy-styled goggles with many adjustable lenses. She moaned musically, her voice hitting an impressive high note as she climaxed alongside her transformation, gaining longer, wilder hair, beautifully done nails, and glistening white teeth as the natural wooden tiara appeared atop her head as if to crown her transformation into her new self over.<br />
<br />
Tanya’s enormous bosom rose and fell as she looked down at herself. She stated at her own hand and pinched herself to confirm she really was seeing and feeling this. <br />
<br />
“Enjoying ourselves are we?” Tanya bolted her head back and gasped as she saw the two elves trailing behind her to check up on her.</p>
