<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Gordon and Jason sat in front of a computer, scrutinizing the initial pile of raw data they had gathered, having run Professor Richard Jones, AKA Teacher Dick through a series of strange tests.<br />
<br />
The academic cock had been measured thoroughly, both soft and hand. Had and MRI, CT, X ray, ultrasound, and even several blood tests. The two student apologizing profusely at the clear discomfort of a needle in such a sensitive body part.<br />
<br />
The entire time, Teacher Dick had been talking with the students, discussing the implications of some of the tests they were running, and treating the process as if he were grading an article for a potential science journal release.<br />
<br />
The focused atmosphere of collecting these tests had kept the tone professional, and as such Teacher Dick had been able to keep himself at a semi flaccid state, but that soon changed as they discussed the next phase of experiments.<br />
<br />
Gordon wanted to measure if there was any change in refractory period when a dicked person was attached versus not attached, along with measuring any changes in the volume and composition of ejaculate, response to stimuli, and even if there was any change to the dicked person when attached to another person.<br />
<br />
This had involved a very involved pre test interview, with Teacher Dick having to describe in as much detail as he could his past sexual behaviors. The methods that he enjoyed most when masturbating, having sex, the frequency he normally came and his own record for cumming repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Teacher Dick answered honestly, although his embarrassment, combined with the intense gaze of the students who were clearly trying to hide their own growing erections made it impossible for Dick not to get hard, sputtering through some answers as pre - cum bubbled from his tip.<br />
<br />
Reminding himself this process was all in the name of science, Dick made himself answer every single question, even as they became clearly more focused on the sexual relationship between Teacher Dick and the Physics Prick-cher. Dick sat on the bench, shiny from all the trickling precum, his balls drawn up tight against his shaft, right on the verge of cumming when the two students finished their interview and start rushing to compile their equipment.<br />
<br />
While Jason had set up some basic equipment, Gordon had contacted Hugo and got some specialized equipment, designed to hold a variety of dicks, and gather the collected secretions. The complete lack of attention making Dick go soft.<br />
<br />
Until finally it was time to begin.<br />
<br />
“Now Dick. I am not going to tell you which test we are conducting or when we are going to finish them.” Gordon said as he started a timer and started stroking Dick’s rapidly hardening shaft, slowly pulling the foreskin back and forth as the cock had described earlier.<br />
“It’s the best way to keep this a double blind study.”<br />
<br />
“Now Gordon, I’m disappointed a grad student such as yourself doesn’t understand what double blind mea-” <br />
Dicks words cut off as a steady flow of pre flowed from his slit,  muffling and silencing the teacher protests.<br />
<br />
Jason stared down at Teacher Dick without compassion as he began.<br />

Round three ceased at this point. <br />

<br />
Day One<br />
Experiment notes Summary<br />
<br />
The subject seems to have a significantly shorter refractory period and higher production of semen while in a dicked state. The subjects self declared baseline is 3 ejaculations in a 24 hour period with an approximate refractory period of 30-45 minutes, and an estimated ejaculate volume of 15-20 mls.<br />
<br />
In their transformed state the subject has a significantly shorter refractory period, with elevated seminal production, and was able to ejaculate 20 times within a single day.<br />
<br />
The short refractory period within each round indicates rapid sexual recovery, whether this is innate within the dicked form and adequate rest, or a result of being connected to a new human body is the next phase of investigation.<br />
<br />
Other events of note include the notable change of thought processes as the number of ejaculations accrued. <br />
At the commencement of the first round the subject was able to discuss highly complex topics with ease, hindered only by the excess production of seminal fluid (pre-cum) form their urethra.<br />
<br />
While the biology of this does not make sense, our hypothesis is that the dicked mind applies an anthropomorphic filter to their experience as a penis.<br />
The end result is that while there is no need for breathing during communication, the sensation of the urethral opening being plugged with fluid stimulates a mental reflex similar to a human mouth fool of fluid. This is conveyed in the ‘garbled’ and ‘muffled’ sounds interrupting their communications via the implanted chips.<br />
<br />
But I digress.<br />
<br />
As the number of ejaculations accrued, the subjects thought processes appear to devolve over the course of the experiment, changing to short sentences hinting at feeling a bit foggy headed and wanting a “short break to gather my wits” and then to shorter micro sentences. <br />
E.g “more rest please” “Maybe we should call it a day” “Too much pleasure.”<br />
<br />
As the number of ejaculations reached 12 the subject was silent for longer periods and their expressed words changed in tone and purpose.<br />
F.g. “Dick happy” “Dick keep cumming” “Dick feel good” “Please suck Dick”<br />
<br />
The last three ejaculations did not fit the study framework and as such will need to factored out any data modeling and statistical analysis. Ejaculation 18 was tainted by Jason assisting Gordon with his masturbation, however the produced semen was ejaculated over the table, on the written research noted and the floor. <br />
The 19th Ejaculation was lost as Jason swallowed it, attempting to assist the research with more then adequate felatio, and the 20th ejaculation was inside Jason’s rectum, sufficient details in above notes.<br />
<br />
Day one completed.</p>
