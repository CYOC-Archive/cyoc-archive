<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The teacher in-service day at the school reached their last event of the day.  I mostly related to the changes to discipline and and how teachers were supposed to keep students in line, at least according to what the pamphlet that covered the day&#39;s events.  Martha figured that some things may have changed, as she had found that various things hand changed with regard to parenting over the years. And while she knew it was true that they hadn&#39;t taught since Nate was born, she had learned plenty about parenting and she had learned plenty about parenting in raising Nate and Eric.  Martha had learned what was typical in her parents day didn&#39;t work as well with her own children so she probably figured that some things that related to discipline int he classroom.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be ready for a talk on how the CHILDREN should have complete and total control over the classroom,&quot; Dawn commented softly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm?&quot; Martha wondered to the werefox who had actually made rather good friends with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had these same talk at the start of last year,&quot; Dawn whispered, &quot;the &quot;teachers shouldn&#39;t be in charge of their classrooms&quot; talk because  it comes off as oppression... that students don&#39;t learn well when they&#39;re afraid of the teachers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that make some degree of sense?&quot; Martha asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;To some degree,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan added as she looked over, &quot;and particularly with the younger kids, but much of this is also repeated as perfect for the older kids as well, and when the younger kids are encouraged to fear nothing with little REAL consequences, particularly as they get into older grades... they begin to realize they can manipulate students. We don&#39;t want to frighten students obviously, but as with parenting, you need to be firm with them as well. They can&#39;t go into situations where they have no fear of authority or the consequences for bad behavior. Otherwise, they won&#39;t respect a teachers ability to lead the class room or what the teacher wants to do and will make it a power play... and if they gain more success... they&#39;ll start to push buttons.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it&#39;s a battle between being firm and gentle at the same time,&quot; Martha commented, &quot;Sound like parenting...&quot;<br />
<br />
Mrs. Sullivan and Dawn both nodded, and Mrs. Sullivan actually laughed, as Julia and Franz Eidlemann moved into their presentation, which involved actually showing a movie in which they highlighted  the problems of more authoritarian teachers created and how more democratic teachers had more success as students responded better in their classes. Some of it struck Martha as more of an exercise in acting and not actual observation, or at least that the people that made the film did a lot of research and filmed classes that worked exceptionally well to set up their point  as to what worked and what didn&#39;t. They didn&#39;t fully test to see how well these things worked with more difficult classes. It gave Martha some ideas on what to do, and did offer suggestions on where and how she could be firm as a teacher with problem students, but there were a few minor points that she did feel could use a different touch. Regardless, though, Martha did accept the suggestions.<br />
<br />
When the film ended, both of the Eidlemanns thanked everyone for their time and turned the floor over to the principal, Samuel Johnson. He looked to the gathered teachers while the Eidlemanns began cleaning up their things.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you all for participating,&quot; Samuel Johnson spoke, &quot;Hopefully we got our first professional development/in-service day done well. For those of you who are subs... I must regret to say that your day will be done... for the rest of the staff, you&#39;ll be pleased that we managed to get through the day and give you about thirty minutes in your rooms to get things ready for next week. If you&#39;re already ready... I&#39;ll expect next week&#39;s lesson plans by Monday morning and any sub-plans emailed to me by tomorrow evening.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, the group began to break up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully you&#39;ll be able to come to the regular Skulk meetings,&quot; Dawn flashed a smile, &quot;I can help you get ready for teaching here in Moon Lake... among other things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you for any and all help,&quot; Martha replied, which was honest, though she was also trying to hide some of her embarrassment, as Dawn was one of the weres she did have some interest in that went beyond just teaching. She was comfortable with being bi as a werecat, and her cat was even eager to enjoy everything that went along with it and bringing William along if need be, but she also wanted to keep thins professional. Even if William had taught elementary, the two of them wouldn&#39;t have flirted with each other while on duty, regardless of how well they hit it off elsewhere.<br />
<br />
She gave a polite wave to Dawn and gave a low sigh and began to collect her things.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Martha heard Mrs. Sullivan say to her, &quot;you are rather new to Moon Lake and a lot of us are going to be rather curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha looked up to see a friendly smile, before the teacher that in theory she might be replacing gave a wave, &quot;There really isn&#39;t time to do much in the rooms for us... why don&#39;t I show you what could be your classroom when I &quot;retire.&quot; We can then talk a bit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Martha said slowly and followed Mrs. Sullivan out.<br />
<br />
They walked along until they got to the Third Grade section of the building and they stopped at a lone classroom door. Martha waited quietly while Mrs. Sullivan fished out some keys, unlocked her door, and lead Martha in. The classroom wasn&#39;t too out of place for a third grade classroom. It had four large circular desks in a square pattern in the middle of the room with another in the center. The desks weren&#39;t all, which of course suited little kids. There was a long smartboard hanging on the wall with projectors and a laptop connected to it. Cardboard cutouts to list out the alphabet hung on the walls, along with various inspirational posters, which depicted Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin. A host of children&#39;s storybooks and even some non-fiction books were also present. It was fairly different from the classroom Martha had last taught in, but it actually had a rather homey feel to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have a nice room,&quot; Martha spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;d think so,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan answered, &quot;and a part of me will miss it... but Tim doesn&#39;t work in Moon Lake... and he&#39;ll have to retire soon because normals may catch on if he keeps going at that job. If the world knew about us and accepted us... maybe... but for the moment they don&#39;t...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I really don&#39;t want to make it feel like I&#39;m pushing you out,&quot; Martha commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;You aren&#39;t,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan answered, &quot;as the principal said, you&#39;ll be paid a salary as a sub, and while it&#39;s lower than a regular teacher&#39;s salary, it&#39;s better than what you&#39;d get elsewhere. And for a while, Tim and I can live on his retirement and a substitute teacher&#39;s salary. Besides, it&#39;ll give us the freedom to be with each other, something we haven&#39;t fully been able to do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Martha spoke weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan said with some assurance in her voice, &quot;and don&#39;t worry about some of the requests you&#39;ve gotten today. You are new to Moon Lake and a new werecat. Many are bound to be curious about you being new and then learning that you&#39;re a werecat making you at least bi only further raises the curiosity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With some, I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Martha answered, &quot;and the cat in me is curious... It&#39;s mostly that everything was while on duty that the requests came in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That you may not be able to fully avoid,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan answered, &quot;as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve discovered that your libido is much higher than it was by becoming a were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Martha nodded. She had noticed that.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can rest assured that none of that will go on on days when the kids are here,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan assured her, &quot;professional development and in-service days... they&#39;re a bit less of &quot;on duty&quot; days than others, and that will allow for some socializing that we don&#39;t have time for normally... and combined with the fact that you&#39;re new, that likely just lead from one thing to another.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Martha said slowly, &quot;Thank you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Mrs. Sullivan smiled, like a friendly older sister, &quot;you just work on earning your certification back and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make a fine addition to the staff and will fit right in.&quot;</p>
