<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Connor leaned against his dad’s truck as the last rays of the sun dipped below the horizon. His body still hummed with an energy he couldn’t quite explain. The day&#39;s work had left him tired, but not in the way he expected—if anything, it was the kind of exhaustion that left him feeling stronger, not weaker.<br />
<br />
“You heading home already?” Logan’s voice pulled Connor from his thoughts.<br />
<br />
Connor glanced up to see the taller man locking up the shop, his jacket slung casually over one shoulder. Behind him, Zack and Micah were joking with Eric, their laughter carrying easily on the cool evening breeze.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah. I mean, unless you need something else?” Connor asked, awkwardly shifting his weight.<br />
<br />
Logan shook his head, smirking slightly. “Nah, but we’re about to grab a bite if you’re interested. It’s kind of a tradition on Fridays.”<br />
<br />
Connor hesitated, glancing at the group. “Oh, I don’t want to intrude or anything—”<br />
<br />
“You won’t,” Zack interrupted, waving him over with an easy grin. “C’mon, man, you earned it. Besides, we don’t bite.”<br />
<br />
The words hung in the air for a beat too long, and Logan shot Zack a knowing look before laughing and clapping Connor on the shoulder.<br />
<br />
“Seriously, though,” Logan added, his tone softer, “it’s just dinner. No pressure. But you might want to come—this crew’s a bit of a pack, and it’s good to get to know everyone.”<br />
<br />
Connor blinked at the word “pack” but chalked it up to shop camaraderie. “Alright, sure. Why not?”<br />
<br />
“Perfect,” Logan said, moving towards another truck in the parking lot. “Follow us. It’s not far.”<br />
<br />
The group piled into their individual cars, with Logan leading the way and Connor following close behind. Logan led them to a small bar tucked off a winding road just on the outskirts of town. The place had a cabin-like charm, its wood-paneled exterior glowing softly under the setting sun. It looked like something out of a movie—a place where the regulars all knew each other and strangers weren’t unwelcome, but they’d definitely stand out. <br />
<br />
Inside, the bar felt warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the cool night air. The walls were decorated with photographs, vintage tools, and other kinds of decorations that hinted at a long history; or at the very least, the atmosphere of having one. A crackling fireplace in the corner added to the rustic atmosphere, the scent of cedar mixing pleasantly with the tempting aroma of bar food.<br />
Zack, Micah, and Eric immediately gravitated to a booth near the fireplace, their banter picking up right where it had left off in the parking lot. Logan gestured for Connor to slide in next to Zack while he took the seat opposite him, placing himself between Eric and Micah.<br />
<br />
“Welcome to The Hollow,” Logan said, drumming his fingers lightly on the table. “Best food this town has to offer.”<br />
<br />
Connor glanced around, noting how the other patrons seemed to be glancing in their direction. Were they…looking at him? He shrugged it off, chalking it up to coincidence. “Seems like a hidden gem.”<br />
<br />
“That’s one way to put it,” Micah said, smirking as he leaned back in his seat. “Though I think they keep us around ‘cause we scare off the troublemakers.”<br />
<br />
“Speak for yourself,” Zack cut in, nudging Micah with his elbow. “I’m a model citizen.”<br />
<br />
Logan chuckled, raising a hand to catch the waitress’s attention. “A model citizen who gets us banned from half the pool tables in town.”<br />
<br />
Zack held up his hands in mock surrender. “Hey, not my fault people don’t like losing.”<br />
<br />
The waitress approached, her smile warm and familiar as she set down menus without asking. <br />
<br />
“The usual, gentlemen?” she asked, sparing a curious glance at Connor.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, and whatever the rookie here wants,” Logan replied, his tone light but firm. “Put it on my tab.”<br />
<br />
Connor looked up from the menu, his stomach rumbling at the sight of burgers and fries. “Uh, just a cheeseburger and fries. Thanks.”<br />
<br />
The waitress nodded, jotting it down. “Coming right up.”<br />
<br />
As the waitress gathered the menus and left, Connor leaned back in his chair a bit, taking in the rustic charm of the bar as music hummed from the nearby jukebox. He recalled hearing about a place like this before&#19968;other students in high school often talked about it&#19968;but this was his first time stepping inside. The wood-paneled walls, low lighting, and scent of cedar gave it a cozy, almost homey feel to it. <br />
<br />
Logan leaned forward, setting an elbow on the table. “So, Connor, how long have you been in town?” <br />
<br />
“For pretty much most of my life,” Connor replied. “Born and raised here. I left to attend college, but, uh…it didn’t exactly go as planned. Dropped out in my sophomore year and came back here, and I’ve been trying to figure things out for the past two years.”<br />
<br />
Logan nodded, his gaze steady but kind. “Nothing wrong with that. Sometimes it just takes a while to figure things out.” <br />
<br />
“Yeah, well, my parents would definitely disagree there,” Connor said with a faint chuckle. “They haven’t been thrilled about me hopping from job to job. This is honestly the first one that I’ve felt…good about.” <br />
<br />
Zack gave him a playful nudge, smirking. “That’s ‘cause you got a good boss and coworkers. Don’t let that ‘good boss’ comment go to his head, though.”<br />
<br />
Logan rolled his eyes but didn’t respond, looking over as the waitress came back carrying a large tray of food. She quickly set it down on a nearby table, and before Connor could react, she had placed the plates down on their table. <br />
<br />
“Enjoy gentlemen!” she said, picking up the tray and disappearing into the back. <br />
<br />
Micah was quick to dig in, picking up a buffalo wing and taking a large bite from it. He swallowed before looking at Connor with a grin. “If you ask me, I don’t think it’s bad that you came back,” he said, his voice deep and thoughtful. “You got roots here. A lot of us don’t really have that.”<br />
<br />
Connor swallowed the fries he’d picked up, glancing at Micah curiously. “What do you mean?”<br />
<br />
Micah hesitated for a moment, seemingly weighing his words. “Just saying…some of us end up wandering before we find our place. You’re lucky to know where home is.”<br />
<br />
The conversation dipped into a comfortable silence as everyone dug into their food. Still, Connor couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to Micah’s comment&#19968;something that he was purposely leaving unspoken. <br />
<br />
“You’ll do fine,” Eric said suddenly, breaking the quiet. His voice was lighter than the others’, but there was an edge of conviction to it. “Logan wouldn’t have hired you if he didn’t think you’d pull your weight. And you already proved yourself today.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you fit in,” Zack added, leaning back in his chair. “You’ve got that... instinct. You’ll see what I mean.”<br />
<br />
Connor tilted his head, unsure what to make of Zack’s words. “Instinct?”<br />
<br />
“Don’t overthink it,” Logan said smoothly, shooting Zack a warning glance. “Just means you’ve got a good head on your shoulders. And strong hands.”<br />
<br />
The way Logan said it—calm, assured—made Connor feel oddly proud, though he wasn’t entirely sure why.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright,” Zack said, raising his hands in mock surrender. “Let’s not scare the kid off on his first day.”<br />
<br />
Connor laughed nervously, but the warmth of the group’s camaraderie was undeniable. For the first time in a long while, he felt like he belonged somewhere. Even if he couldn’t quite put his finger on why, he didn’t want to question it too much.<br />
<br />
As the night deepened, the bar grew quieter. Most of the patrons had filtered out, leaving only a few scattered groups and the steady crackle of a fireplace in the corner. Connor found himself loosening up, the unease he’d felt earlier fading under the warmth of the group’s easy camaraderie.<br />
<br />
“Alright, rookie,” Zack said, his grin mischievous as he leaned forward on his elbows. “You survived your first day. What’d you think?”<br />
<br />
Connor shrugged, though a small smile crept onto his face. “It was good. Better than I expected, honestly. You guys are... different from the other places I’ve worked.”<br />
<br />
Logan raised an eyebrow, smirking slightly. “Different how?”<br />
<br />
Connor hesitated, searching for the right words. “I don’t know. Like... there’s a rhythm, I guess. Like everyone knows exactly what they’re doing without saying much. It’s... seamless. Almost like you’re all on the same wavelength or something.”<br />
<br />
Zack let out a low chuckle, but it wasn’t mocking. “That’s one way to put it.”<br />
<br />
Micah, who had been quiet for most of the meal, tilted his head toward Connor. “You’re not wrong. We’ve worked together for a while now, and... let’s just say, we know each other pretty well.”<br />
<br />
Connor nodded, though something about the way Micah said it made him feel like there was more beneath the surface.<br />
<br />
Eric leaned back, stretching his arms above his head. “You’ll pick it up soon enough. Instinct’s already kicking in, right?”<br />
<br />
Connor furrowed his brow. “What is with you guys and instinct?”<br />
<br />
Zack grinned wide, flashing teeth that seemed just a little too sharp in the dim light. “Let’s just say we’ve got good instincts. Runs in the family.”<br />
<br />
Connor blinked, unsure how to respond. “Family? You guys are all... related?”<br />
<br />
Micah chuckled, a low rumble that sent a faint chill down Connor’s spine. “Not by blood. We’re more of a…found family, if that makes sense. We’ve got a bond that most people wouldn’t understand.”<br />
<br />
“Speaking of bonds,” Zack said, a bit of a teasing tone in his voice. “You might want to be careful, Logan. Connor’s picking up fast. Pretty sure he could outpace you someday.” The young man wrapped his arm around Connor’s shoulders, shaking him playfully. “Isn’t that right, C?”<br />
<br />
Before Connor could reply, Logan shook his head, smirking slightly. “I think I can handle him.” There was a weight to his words, a challenge wrapped in humor. <br />
<br />
Before Connor could press further, Logan stood up, pulling out his wallet. “Alright, we’ve taken up enough of Connor’s evening. Let’s head out, boys. I’ll take care of the bill.”<br />
<br />
The group rose in unison, moving toward the door. Logan broke away and moved toward the cash register near the front as the other four stepped outside into the cool, evening air. A few minutes later, Logan joined them, clapping Connor on the shoulder. “It’s been a good first day. You’re fitting in well.” <br />
<br />
Connor smiled, but before he could say anything, Zack leaned in and put a shoulder around Connor as well. “You bet he’s fitting in! In fact, I think he’ll fit in even better tonight!”<br />
<br />
Micah smirked, nodding in agreement. “He’s gotta see it eventually. We can’t leave him in the dark for much longer.”<br />
<br />
Connor’s brow furrowed. “See what? What else is going on tonight?” <br />
<br />
Logan sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “It’s…it’s nothing,” he said, clear hesitation in his voice. “It’s just…we have a sort of…<i>tradition</i>. Something that we do after a long day to unwind.”<br />
<br />
Zack scoffed and playfully punched Logan. “Don’t undersell it like that!” he said. “We all know it’s way more than that! It’s a chance to really get what we’re all about!” The young man flashed a grin, and now that he was up close, Connor could definitely tell that his teeth were sharper.<br />
<br />
Eric gave a soft sigh before nodding as well. “I hate to admit it, but they have a point. It’d be better to show him sooner rather than later.”<br />
<br />
Connor wasn’t sure what they were talking about, but he felt like the odd man out. “I mean…if it’s important to you guys, I can tag along. I don’t want to miss out.”<br />
Logan hesitated again, his gaze searching Connor’s face. “Are you sure?” he asked. “It’s…different. Not everyone’s ready for it.”<br />
<br />
Zack rolled his eyes and chuckled, patting Connor on the back. “Don’t try to scare him off, Logan! Connor can handle it!” He turned to Connor and added, “Trust me, you’ll love it.” <br />
<br />
Connor shifted nervously, the realization that everyone’s eyes were on him making his pulse quicken. “Okay…I’m in, I guess.”<br />
<br />
“Hell yeah!” Micah shouted, holding up his hand. “Up top!” Connor grinned slightly as he high-fived Micah, squirming a bit as Zack playfully ruffled up his hair. <br />
<br />
Logan stepped back to give them some space. He nodded, but there was still clearly some uncertainty in his expression. “Alright…let’s head out then.”</p>
