<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Despite Erick desired to accept Fredrick&#39;s offer so badly, he knew that they have go to the soccer game first. Fredrick&#39;s parents were going there and they&#39;re expecting to see their 11 years old son playing the ball. While he was thinking, Fredrick approached him from behind and started to rub his groin with Erick&#39;s thigh. Erick was getting aroused, he can feel Fredrick&#39;s schlong through his tight shorts, plus the boy was going commando and his shaft outline was completely visible to everyone.<br />
<br />
Erick was tempted to took Fredrick&#39;s beefy arm and pull him to the dressing room. However, despite it&#39;s a dream come true, he remembered that this 30 years old dude was really his puny 11 years old neighborhood. Was he disposed to fuck a kid? He didn&#39;t want to think about that now. So, he pushed Fredrick away and ran out of the store. Fredrick tried to follow him, but he hadn&#39;t paid for his clothes and was stopped by the security guard. Obviously, Fredrick didn&#39;t have any money, so Erick had to come back and pay it for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t want to make you feel uncomfortable.&quot; Fredrick told Erick as they walked out of the mall. Erick didn&#39;t reply, he was a mix of emotions that he can&#39;t understand. Why did he reject Fredrick&#39;s offer? He had dreamt about it for years and now that he had the opportunity to make it true, he ran away. Why did that stupid annoying kid become so hot? He wanted to prank him but now he cared too much for him to leave him alone. Was he falling in love with him?<br />
<br />
He got in the driver seat and Fredrick did the same on the passenger side. The car sagged down again and Fredrick blushed a little in shame. He didn&#39;t ask for driving, he just stayed there quietly as Erick drove to the soccer field. Fredrick watched through his window wondering how different it feels to be an adult and not a kid. His bosy was too big that his knees were hurting, he tried to spread his legs but his thighs were to thick that they can barely open. Why was he feeling uncomfortable this time when before he was too confident that he even drove?<br />
<br />
After 20 min they arrived to the soccer field. Fredrick looked for his parents&#39; car but he didn&#39;t find it. So, he was kinda relieved. He followed Erick to the stands and they sat in the front row closely to the locker room. Erick didn&#39;t know what to do. He was worried but he didn&#39;t want to turn Fredrick back to his age at the same time. What can he do? Fredrick, on the other hand, was completely surprised of seeing his soccer pals, they seemed so small now. That&#39;s how adults use to look at him? He was wondering as he stared at his wide chest and his pecs&#39; mounds.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your parents will come at any moment.&quot; Erick told Fredrick. &quot;We need to find a way to cancel this game. Any idea?&quot; &quot;No, the only one who can cancel the game is the coach and he had never done that.&quot; &quot;Who&#39;s the coach?&quot; &quot;That man! The one with the white cap.&quot; &quot;And that kid?&quot; &quot;He&#39;s his son, Randy. He&#39;s 4 years old and the couch brings him sometimes.&quot; Erick got an idea as he watched the little kid holding his father&#39;s big hand. However, he needed some time to refine details. Then he remembered that he had a huge manly man at his disposal and his plan was complete.<br />
<br />
&quot;Make a distraction.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Make a distraction. I need to separate that kid from his dad.&quot; &quot;What&#39;s your plan, Erick?&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t tell you now, just do it!&quot; &quot;Ok, ok.&quot;  Aaand what do I do?&quot; Fredrick asked as he stood up. Erick thought for a second and then he got a little mischievous idea. He suddenly pulled Fredrick&#39;s shorts down and pushed him in the locker room next to them. Fredrick was going commando, so when his shorts fell down, his fat cock jumped out to everyone&#39;s stare. He froze for a second, time enough for all his soccer pals watched it and screamed in horror. For Fredrick, it was interesting to see how different he looked from them now. For the kids, it was a weirdo showing off his privates to a bunch of innocent boys.<br />
<br />
Almost immediately, the coach and several parents ran inside the locker room to see what&#39;s happening. When Fredrick heard their screams he reacted, pulled his shorts up and ran away. He was being chased. Meanwhile, Erick saw his opportunity, the coach&#39;s son was alone in a bench. It was his chance to use the clock vial once again. If he turned that kid into an adult and he looked quite similar to his father, he could convince him to pretend being him and cancel the game. It was a crazy idea and a 50-50 chance of working but he&#39;s running out of time.<br />
<br />
Erick was slowly walking towards the kid, trying to pretend he wasn&#39;t getting closer when he tripped with a sprinkler and his vial fell off of his hands. It flied away and landed inside of the water tank that supplied the locker room. &quot;Oh,  damn it!&quot; He muttered as he watched the vial sinking inside the water. Meanwhile, due to his extra energy and strength, Fredrick managed to escape from his persecutors. He found a janitor room and came in. He had to wait until things calm down, so he started to explore the place. Several cleaning stuff, toilet paper and tools that he didn&#39;t care about. However, after he moved a big cardboard box, he found a light. It was a hole, and when he looked through it, he found out that he could see the locker room. His young boy mind didn&#39;t question why there was a hole like that hidden in the janitor room.<br />
<br />
Erick noticed that the coach was returning with his son, the other parents as well. He even watched Fredrick&#39;s parents arriving. He didn&#39;t know where Fredrick was but he assumed that he was hiding somewhere. He needed to think of another plan.</p>
