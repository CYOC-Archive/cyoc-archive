<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Across town, the wish Ross made started to have its effects - but it was so widespread that the effects would hardly be as definite as they were with Bryan and Wes. And it would be slower than it was with them, somewhat, but the effects would be largely inexorable unless those involved realized what originated the changes, and how to go about altering or reversing them. Ross to a degree would have utterly no idea going about his day and walking off from the wishing machine as to what effects his wish would have on the town and everyone living there. He just thought that maybe it would be a fun thing to wish for - or that at most it would put it out there and maybe some more people would move in to fit his wish.<br />
<br />
In fairness, Ross had no idea what sort of power he was working with. The machine started really working as it processed Ross&#39; wish, the energy of the wish spreading out and starting to affect quite a number of people - starting at the school Ross went to. But surely due to spread out to those in the town. The wizard-like construct buzzing and whirring as it initiated its most complicated, large scale wish yet. Ross may not have said it in such a way as to make it particularly complex, but the implications and nature of it lent toward that.<br />
<br />
Ross headed off and met Diego by the exit of the fairgrounds. The well-muscled Latino seemed a little bit distracted by something. Ross waved and Diego smiled a little, &quot;Oh, Ross, you made your wish already?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, just hoping for a few more gay or bi guys around town. You know how it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I do indeed.&quot; Diego said with a lazy grin.<br />
<br />
Before long, Ross could see what Diego was looking at. A few young women heading out from a funhouse type attraction. Ross tilted his head a little, noting the women were pretty attractive objectively speaking. Ross lightly teased Diego, &quot;I believe you said you were wholly gay, Diego, no girls for you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno, man,&quot; Diego wrapped an arm around Ross, murmuring to him, &quot;Y&#39;know how the straight boys have their exceptions? See the real athletic one with the boobs and the butt? My man I think she&#39;s my exception. I could go straight for that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You could...?&quot; Ross chuckled a little and then nudged him, &quot;How about you ask her out for a bit of threesome action.&quot; He whispered into Diego&#39;s ear, &quot;I&#39;m not about to let you run off and have some fun here without me. &#39;Sides, I think I see your point. Wow!&quot; Both of them looked at each other in the eyes and decided to give it a try. She was a pretty strong looking woman, probably someone who did a good amount of weightlifting, a regular modern day Amazon with blond hair and gray eyes.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, she was over there discretely looking at Ross and Diego - her name was Beth Branston. Debating with her girlfriends whether she should go for it. She knew them from around town as two young, gay men. Yet she was distinctly getting vibes they were interested. Well, maybe one of them was more bi than he seemed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Diego called out as he and Ross walked over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey yourself, big boy.&quot; Beth said as she looked at Diego and Ross, &quot;Gotta say, you two look real cute together. Boyfriends?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know it,&quot; Diego started, &quot;I&#39;m up though for expanding some horizons if you&#39;re interested.&quot; Beth seemed to consider it for a moment, and decided she may as well try. Not often you get invited to such an occasion. She waved goodbye to her girlfriends and decided to head off with Diego and Ross. The two boyfriends fistbumping and then trying to figure out what to go for first.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, another couple was having a rather passionate night.<br />
<br />
Kendall Denning, naked as could be, was presently giving Allison Lambert quite the experience in what should&#39;ve been their &quot;study session&quot;. At least, that was the excuse they always used when they were actually going to hook up. Kendall had light brown hair in a messy, dorky cut, matching eyes, his glasses resting on the bedside. His build was thin and rather skinny, but as Allison took him in, she very much enjoyed Kendall&#39;s presence. It was not exactly a typical coupling.<br />
<br />
Allison Lambert, one of the head cheerleaders and also a very popular girl at the school, was assumed to most likely be dating a jock or someone of similar social hierarchical stature. Everyone knew that Vincent and Tom, two of the more muscular athletes at the school, openly pined for her. Yet her heart - and right now, her pussy - belonged to her nerdy tutor. She moaned and urged him on, &quot;Ohh! I see why you&#39;re...so..so popular with women! You&#39;re so good at this, Kendall!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Babe, it&#39;s an acquired skill, just like everything else. Once you have the relevant...uuugh, experience...the sexual dynamics of coupling...become...just another...oooh, part of my skill set...&quot; Kendall tried to scientifically explain his capacity for sex, but fell into moaning and groaning as he continued using his manhood to delight Allison. It wasn&#39;t a simple matter. Kendall was ALSO blessed with a simply enormous manhood despite his build&#39;s other deficiencies, and he was skilled at using it. Rather than ramming the whole thing in, he was skilled at actually using it to further both parties&#39; pleasure.<br />
<br />
Point being, Kendall was a literal fucking expert. And many of the women he went out with came to appreciate that about him.<br />
<br />
Kendall however right in the middle of a thrust felt something odd - like a muscle spasm and his ass involuntarily clenching. He grit his teeth and, even though it was a sensation that would&#39;ve reduced most men to gasping and involuntarily cumming in his position, Kendall managed to keep going...for a while.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh babe, I&#39;m...I cannot help myself! Orgasm is imminent! I repeat, orgasm imminent!&quot; Being that she didn&#39;t want to get a creampie today, Allison let Kendall withdraw and allowed him to release on her stomach. She enjoyed how dorky and earnest he was while at the same time being this immensely skilled at sexual acts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, you had a pretty generous emission today.&quot; Allison commented, before bringing up a towel to clean herself off. Always come prepared for these kinds of things. Allison herself wasn&#39;t exactly a stereotype either. Sure she looked like an almost typical blond bimbo type, but her grades greatly disputed this - Allison was on course to be the Valedictorian if she kept her studies up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, had a kinda weird experience there.&quot; Kendall stated as he cleaned his manhood up and sat there naked on the bed. &quot;My ass clenched involuntarily, and I think I felt a muscle spasm. It was not uncomfortable, in fact it felt perplexingly good. It almost overwhelmed my usual capacity for stamina.&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison leaned over and kissed Kendall on the cheek, &quot;You&#39;re so much fun. When do you think you&#39;ll be able to get it back up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Get it back up...?&quot; Kendall cupped his chin and tested his manhood briefly, &quot;Give me the standard amount of time allotted for the male refractory period. Then I&#39;ll be able to give you my...usual scholarly services again.&quot; He winked a little, acknowledging he was probably exhausted for now but given some time he&#39;d be able to get right back up to it. Though Kendall was starting to feel a little weird tonight.</p>
