<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">There was moment before Kathy heard Frank hand his phone over and the DA say, &quot;Listen ma&#39;am...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No you listen,&quot; Kathy cut him off. She wasn&#39;t in the mood to listen to any of his prattle and there wasn&#39;t the time to do so. &quot;This is Dr. Kathy Tucker and I have a patient that needs her transformation completed or else she will die. If that happens I will make sure the whole town knows that you were complicit in her death. Now I need Diane Tucker at the hospital yesterday. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said your patient was a she so that means that Diane Tucker is guilty of another statute 1A violation,&quot; the DA said sounding a bit smug.<br />
<br />
&quot;This is too complicated to explain over the phone and would take too long,&quot; Kathy said impatience in her voice. &quot;Needless to say that Diane only turned one into a werecheetah. Now will you get her here so she can complete my patient&#39;s transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I might be mistaken but the treatment for a male being exposed to the all female form of the virus is for another werebeast to transform them so Miss Tucker isn&#39;t going anywhere,&quot; the DA said with an air of finality.<br />
<br />
Kathy frowned as the DA said that. He was being a total ass about this but there was one thing she could do. She hated to do it and the DA would likely be more determined to put Diane away for it but she had little choice. Taking a deep breath she said, &quot;Under statute 1B you are required to provide any reasonable assistance to complete the transformation of a normal into a werebeast. Considering what happened with Jenny Harper it would be reasonable for you to get Miss Tucker to the hospital in the next few minutes. Or would you rather be charged with a statute 1B violation?&quot;<br />
<br />
The DA grumbled before saying, &quot;I&#39;ll have her there in about ten minutes.&quot; He sounded a bit angry but she didn&#39;t care. Her duty was to save the lives she could.<br />
<br />
After Frank said he&#39;d come as well she looked at Rikki&#39;s vitals. They were still fluctuating but she seemed to be resting comfortably. She shook her head hardly believing what she was seeing. Rikki had gone from a man in his early forties to a girl that was physically a fourteen. They would have to wait and see how old she was mentally since there was bound to be some memory loss. Henry may have saved her life but it&#39;s lucky that she had Klinefelter syndrome otherwise she would have Turner syndrome, having just the X chromosome. Suddenly a thought occurred to her. Ever since the question of whether Henry could have experimented on other people something was nagging her and it finally came to the forefront. A few months again there was a deceased Jane Doe werecat with Turner syndrome that had come in. It was determined that she had died of heart failure due to the symptoms of Turner syndrome. At the time that had seemed the likely explanation but now Kathy had to wonder if Henry had experimented on a normal male. The stress of the first transformation, and it did put stress on the body, could have caused heart failure in a woman with Turner syndrome or a male changing into a woman with Turner syndrome. She would need to have the body exhumed and tested to see if there was any sign of the virus. She looked at Rikki again as she let out a little moan in her sleep again asking where Diane was. Kathy sighed and hoped they would be here soon.<br />
<br />
In preparation for the completion of Rikki&#39;s transformation Kathy had her moved to the hospital&#39;s safe room. She was a little hesitant about removing the IV and monitors but they would only get in the way once they started having sex. She had to wait just a few minutes before Frank, the DA, and two police officers came down the hall with Diane in handcuffs and shackles. She was shocked at seeing her like that and Frank didn&#39;t look too happy about it either. &quot;Why is she handcuffed and shackled?&quot; she asked barely able to contain her own outrage.<br />
<br />
&quot;After Miss Smith&#39;s escape we&#39;re not taking any chances with prisoners and cheetahs are known for their speed,&quot; one of the officers said. &quot;We&#39;ll take them off once she&#39;s in the room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy didn&#39;t like it but she supposed that they were being extra cautious. She turned to Diane and said, &quot;Rikki is in there waiting for you to complete her transformation.&quot; At the quizzical look on Diane&#39;s face she said, &quot;Through some unexpected circumstances she really is female now and physically fourteen. I&#39;ll explain it a bit more later but make sure you call he Rikki.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane still looked a little confused look on her face but nodded that she understood. Kathy wondered what that was about but then thought that Diane might not be saying anything for fear that it would be used against her in court. The two officers led her into the room and one pulled out his gun pointing it at her while saying, &quot;Down on your knees!&quot; Thankfully the Moon Lake police carried guns that were non-lethal but to point one at a juvenile was a bit much. Diane complied and the other officer removed the shackles then the handcuffs. &quot;Now hands on your head and don&#39;t move until the door closes,&quot; the officer said as the other one pulled his gun out as well. Once again Diane complied and the officers backed out before the door was closed and locked.<br />
<br />
The DA turned to Kathy and said, &quot;Perhaps you&#39;d care to explain what&#39;s going on. How can a 40 year old man become a 14 year old girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathy took a deep breath before saying, &quot;Normally it wouldn&#39;t have been possible but there are some abnormal circumstances. First was the she had Klinefelter syndrome which had the duel effect of both rejecting and accepting the werecheetah strain. This would have eventually led to the patient&#39;s death and the normal treatment of introducing another strain wouldn&#39;t work. We came up with a theoretical treatment that would allow the patient to survive until the strain went dormant. We expected the patient to still be male though with some feminine features and the same age after the treatment. However another element was introduced into the mix by someone else who I believe to be Henry Wendz. This element is a retrovirus that destroyed the Y chromosome leaving the patient with two X chromosomes and transforming him into a female. As to why she&#39;s physically 14 now we think it&#39;s because of us using blood from a 14 year old female normal at first in our attempt to save the patient and that somehow the regeneration of her cells used the age of those first cells we introduced as a template for their regeneration. We didn&#39;t detect anything that would indicate that her cells would regenerate as fast as they did so it seems like it&#39;s a side effect of a combination of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you saying that you could take a male and make them female without surgery?&quot; the DA asked looking astonished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if the patient has Klinefelter syndrome and the retrovirus is introduced in time,&quot; Kathy said. Seeing that the DA was about to ask another question and having an idea what it was she added, &quot;I think it would change a male that doesn&#39;t have Klinefelter syndrome into a female though that female would then have Turner syndrome and likely die from heart failure because of the stress that the first transformation places on the body. Speaking of which I need the body of the Jane Doe werecat with Turner syndrome exhumed so we can test for any sign of the retrovirus.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t mean to say...&quot; the DA began.<br />
<br />
Kathy nodded and said, &quot;Henry Wendz may be in violation of statute 1 though he probably didn&#39;t intend to kill the deceased if that is what happened. I have the tests from Rikki&#39;s transformation to show that the retrovirus destroys the Y chromosome.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then it should be easy enough to get a court order of exhumation,&quot; the DA said nodding.<br />
<br />
With that taken care of she turned to Frank and said, &quot;Rikki will physically be a 14 year old girl when her transformation is complete. How old she&#39;ll be mentally I don&#39;t know. That depends on what brain cells were destroyed through this. She really may have to go back to school if she did lose that much knowledge and that brings up the fact that she&#39;s going to need parents. I would like for us to adopt her. It&#39;s the least we could do for her after what she&#39;s been through.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frank smiled and said, &quot;Well Rikki Tucker does have a nice ring to it and you&#39;re right, it&#39;s the least we could do. Though there will be some hurdles to jump over.&quot; They both smiled at that little joke.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in the safe room:<br />
<br />
Diane heard the door shut behind her and let out a slow breath she had been holding. The police seemed to be a bit wound up today and she could only assume it was because of what Yvette Smith did. She slowly got up and walked over to the bed where Rikki lay. She was covered but it was clear that she had breasts though they were about the same size as her own. Taking a deep breath she said, &quot;Rikki it&#39;s me, Diane.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rikki opened her eyes and smiled saying, &quot;You didn&#39;t abandon me on my wedding day.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t abandon you on your wedding day when that comes,&quot; Diane promised smiling. &quot;Though it&#39;s not your wedding day today. Today is the day you become a werecheetah and I&#39;m here to help you finish your transformation.&quot; Diane began to take off her clothes since she would be pretty much the same size as a werewolf her age and her clothes wouldn&#39;t fit. As she did she said, &quot;Don&#39;t take this the wrong way but I&#39;m not attracted to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I need you,&quot; Rikki said a bit of fear in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m here for you,&quot; Diane said remembering the need she had felt for Rosetta when she had been transformed even though she wasn&#39;t attracted to her. She finished undressing and said, &quot;Let&#39;s begin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Diane hadn&#39;t expected Rikki to pounce on her let alone pounce on her so fast but before she knew it she was on her back on the bed with Rikki straddling her. Rikki turned around so they were in a 69 position and she dove between her legs licking furiously. Diane let out a small moan as she began to change. Her fur burst out and her feet began to lengthen her heel becoming what many people mistook as a backwards knee. At the same time her thighs shortened a bit and her nails thickened and narrowed into short claws. Her ears taking on a rounded triangle shape and moved to the top of her head as her face pushed out into a short feline muzzle. Her eyes changed from green to a dark golden brown color and whiskers pushed out the side of her muzzle. She gave another little moan as her tail started to grow in and she shifted enough for her to be comfortable. With her transformation done she looked at what was between Rikki&#39;s legs and was a little shocked. Her sister-in-law had said that Rikki was a girl now but the pussy staring her in the face drove it home. She had to wonder how it had happened as she had always heard that there was no way for someone to change their sex but apparently there was. With a little shudder of pleasure from Rikki&#39;s ministrations she began to lick the pussy in front of her though not with as much gusto as Rikki was licking her own pussy. Despite that though after a few moments they both let out long moans as they came simultaneously both of them shuddering in pleasure.<br />
<br />
Rikki rolled off to the side and closed her eyes falling asleep having no idea just how much of her memories and knowledge she lost and the only dream of the future she would remember was the one of her wedding day.</p>
