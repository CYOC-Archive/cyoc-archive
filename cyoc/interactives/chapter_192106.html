<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kerry composed herself and set to work on repairing the make-up on what was currently her face. It was weird seeing Kate’s reflection when she looked in a mirror. With blue eyes and wavy blonde hair this was just not the reflection she had become used to seeing in her previous 25 years of life. She had to clean off her lipstick which, no doubt due to the passionate kissing, she had smudged. She then reapplied it using Kate’s make-up kit. She also fixed her hair which she had somehow mussed up. <br />
 <br />
Kate also fixed her lipstick. She used Kerry’s lip colour from the clutch Kerry had given her. She was also weirded out by seeing someone else’s reflection. Seeing her reflection now was more disorientating than seeing the ‘Kate’ body beside her. Her sense of ‘self’ was completely off.<br />
 <br />
Michael was ready to drive the four of them to the restaurant when the ladies emerged. No one mentioned the kissing and groping that had happened. Kerry sat in the front seat alongside Michael. Tom and Kate sat in the back seat. Tom hoped none of the neighbours noticed that the apparent Kate was sitting alongside his brother. The woman with the Kerry body, whom Tom still had trouble remembering was actually Kate sought out his hand. The held hands for the duration of the journey.<br />
<br />
The conversation in the car was somewhat muted. Michael ran through exactly what had happened during the footy game and the guys discussed who they considered to be the better players during the match. It was as if they had all agreed not to mention body swaps. <br />
<br />
Kerry couldn’t help but think about being in Kate’s body she found it an astoundingly erotic experience. Her nipples were turgid once more and seemed oh so obvious to herself, they were like buttons on the bodice of the dress she was in. She wondered if the others noticed. She hoped not, having already been chastised once for losing emotional control. She tried very hard not to think about Michael and the obvious lump in his trousers. She also was very aware of the presence of Tom in the seat behind her. No doubt he found her current body very attractive – he had married it after all! Had he noticed her erect nipples?<br />
<br />
They arrived at the wharf and like a true gentleman Michael opened her door and helped her out of the car. Kerry was very aware of his eyes lingering on her long legs, shown off by the slit in the dress. They held hands as they walked to the front door of the restaurant. Kerry noticed that Kate and Tom were also holding hands. She wondered if Tom was also attracted to the ‘Kerry’ body. Certainly Kate looked ravishing. It would be a surprise if he wasn’t. She turned her head to look at the couple. Tom immediately glanced to the ground. Kerry had the impression he had been looking at her. She smiled to herself and exaggerated the wiggle of her bum as she climbed the stairs to the front door. Pity she did not have much of a bum in this body.<br />
<br />
Tom despite holding Kate’s hand couldn’t help but admire that bum wiggling in front of him. It was still hard to believe that Kate was in Kerry’s body and that the tall blonde in front of him was not his wife. This was despite him being in Kerry’s body himself hours earlier – he knew it was possible. That his wife’s body was looking so sexy and holding his brother’s hand was disconcerting. It just felt wrong! It was as if Kate was being unfaithful to him but he knew that was not the case. Not that he was not looking forward to having sex with the lovely brunette holding his hand. He had long admired Kerry’s curves and there was no denying that she was a very attractive woman. In fact he couldn’t wait to get back home and have his way with Kerry’s body.<br />
<br />
Michael had made the reservation and introduced himself  to a waitress at the front desk. The young woman confirmed the reservation then led the way to a table by a window . There was a spectcular view of the lights of the city over the harbour. It was just starting to get dark and the lights were coming on. Kerry quickly  decided that the venue was a good choice.<br />
<br />
Half way to the table Kerry felt a tug on her forearm. She stopped. It was her own body with a startled look on it’s face. “What’s the matter?” she asked Kate. <br />
<br />
“The back table, just past the one the waitress has gone to. That woman in the dark blue dress is ........&quot;</p>
