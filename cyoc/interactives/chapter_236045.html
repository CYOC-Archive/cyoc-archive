<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The group in the dorm room continued to discuss Billie&#39;s new appendage, the atmosphere was filled with fascination… and a little discomfort. Billie, eager to explore her new anatomy, suggested, &quot;Should I whip it out and see what it&#39;s like to jack off?&quot;<br />
<br />
The others quickly declined, with Maria saying, &quot;Maybe not right now, Billie.&quot;<br />
<br />
Billie shrugged, understanding their hesitation. &quot;Fine, fine. So, who&#39;s next to make a wish?&quot; she asked, excited to see others experience their own transformations.<br />
<br />
Everyone looked around, uncertain of what they wanted. Maria spoke up, &quot;I think I know what I want, but I need to write it down first. I want to make sure I get the wording right, especially to stop my breasts from lactating so much.&quot; She chuckled.<br />
<br />
Billie encouraged her, &quot;Go for it, Maria! Make that wish!&quot;<br />
<br />
Maria grabbed her notebook and began scribbling down her wish, with Oasis looking over her shoulder, offering suggestions. Billie turned to Oasis, asking, &quot;What about you, Oasis? What do you want to wish for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oasis shrugged, still unsure. &quot;Well… I keep accidentally making wishes when I&#39;m not thinking. I want something that I actually want, something I would never be able to experience otherwise. But I&#39;m not sure yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally, Billie turned to Grace. &quot;Grace, what about you? Do you know what you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace smiled, a mischievous grin spreading across her face. &quot;I do. Y’know, I&#39;ve always wanted to be taller. And I&#39;ve always wanted to be a little bustier, maybe have a bigger butt. And especially after everything Lucas does for me, I&#39;d love to make myself his dream woman… or at least make myself a little curvier than I already am.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone nodded in agreement, encouraging her. Maria added, &quot;Hey, speaking from experience; you should wish for a little more than you expect. These boobs are huge, sure, but I’d never get to experience anything like this otherwise!&quot;<br />
<br />
Grace hesitated for a moment, but couldn’t cover the excited smirk growing across her face, &quot;Y-yeah… I wanna be a little more noticeable, and I’m sure Lucas’ll appreciate a little extra padding&quot;, she chuckled excitedly. Everyone looking at her with excitement and positivity in their eyes.<br />
She took a deep breath and made her wish, &quot;I wish that I grow a little bigger… pretty much all over. Bigger boobs, bigger butt… I wanna be taller… everywhere! A-and a little more than I’m expecting.&quot;<br />
<br />
The moment the words left Grace&#39;s mouth, everyone&#39;s eyes locked onto her, ready to watch any changes she might go through. Grace immediately felt a strange sensation coursing through her body. She quickly stood up, her eyes wide with anticipation. <br />
She looked down at herself, feeling her body beginning to stretch and grow. She watched in amazement as she started to grow taller, the room and her friends seemingly getting further away from her as she gained height. She turned to a nearby mirror, watching as her body elongated, her legs and torso stretching, making her tower over her friends. Her shirt starting to show off her midriff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, Grace, you&#39;re already so tall!&quot; Maria exclaimed, her eyes wide with awe.<br />
<br />
Grace smiled as she experienced her growth. But the sensation didn&#39;t stop there. Her hands flew to her chest as she felt her breasts beginning to swell. She watched in amazement as her cleavage expanded, her small breasts growing bigger and bigger until they were easily the size of cantaloupes, stretching out her top and creating a deep valley between them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeez… these things are quite a bit bigger than I expected.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;But I kinda love them!&quot; She said excitedly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any bigger and you’ll make Maria’s tits look small!&quot; Billie joked. Maria rolling her eyes before throwing a cushion at her.<br />
<br />
Grace laughed, feeling a little awkward but filled with adrenaline. But the changes didn&#39;t stop there. As she admired her new size, she felt her ass suddenly balloon outwards, stretching her leggings to their limit. She accidentally knocked over a candle, exclaiming, &quot;Shit!&quot;<br />
<br />
She turned her body to show everyone, and they all started giggling at the sight of her huge bubble-butt, which looked oddly disproportionate to the rest of her body, with each cheek roughly the size of her head.<br />
<br />
Her hips began to widen next, growing wider and wider, making her ass look a little more proportional, even if it was still pretty huge. Then her thighs started swelling, becoming thicker and more shapely. She turned back to the mirror, admiring her new silhouette. She was definitely getting bigger than she had expected, but she was loving it.<br />
<br />
She turned back to her friends, showing off her new curves, and they all cheered for her. But as she turned to face them, their expressions changed. Grace noticed their concerned looks and asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Is it my…&quot;<br />
<br />
She looked down, unable to see past her breasts, so she turned back to the mirror. To her shock, she saw her belly beginning to paunch, growing rounder and softer. Her hands flew to her slowly inflating stomach, feeling the new weight and fullness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bu-bu-but…&quot; Maria started, her voice filled with concern.<br />
<br />
But the unexpected changes didn&#39;t stop there. Grace&#39;s nipples started to grow, poking out of her top, poking hard and large, becoming more prominent and visible through her clothing. She gasped, her eyes wide with shock.<br />
<br />
But as she looked at her friends, she noticed their expressions changing once more. She turned back to the mirror and saw her face beginning to gain a little pudge, her cheeks becoming fuller and her chin doubling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Grace…&quot; Oasis said with a twang of guilt in her voice.<br />
<br />
Grace touched her face, feeling the new softness and fullness. But the changes still weren&#39;t over. She couldn’t help but moan a little, and her friends watched in shock as the subtle-cameltoe in her leggings began to protrude significantly, swelling bigger and bigger until it practically ate her panties, resulting in a pretty huge bulge the size of her fist.<br />
<br />
&quot;O-oh my god...&quot; Billie said, beginning to shift a little in her seat.<br />
<br />
Finally, Grace&#39;s lips started to swell, becoming fuller and more pronounced, she looked as if she had a real set of DSLs. <br />
<br />
She looked at herself in the mirror. She didn’t know if she saw herself with horror or disbelief or shock… or even a little bit of excitement. But her body was pretty much larger in pretty much every single way, and undeniably, it was hot.<br />
<br />
Maria stood up, her breasts bouncing as she did. She turned to Grace and said, &quot;Grace… holy shit. That was FUCKING INCREDIBLE!&quot; She couldn’t help shouting, &quot;I thought my wish yesterday was extreme, but oh my god look at yourself! You’re huge in all the best ways! God I wis—&quot; Maria got excited, then quickly covered her mouth as she realised what she almost said.<br />
<br />
Grace, close to tears, feeling so many emotions. But Maria&#39;s comment gave her just enough confidence. She looked at herself in the mirror, her mind racing with thoughts. The only thing she could really think about was Lucas&#39;s reaction.<br />
