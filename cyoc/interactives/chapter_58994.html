<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan climbed into Patrick's car, eager to see more of this new world. <br />
The sun had set and the sidewalks were empty except for the occasional <br />
swaggering beefcake. <br />
<br />
&quot;What a beautiful night, huh Patrick?&quot; The redhead smiled, scratching <br />
his gut, <br />
<br />
&quot;Sure is, cub...any night is beautiful with you.&quot; Dan swooned, he knew <br />
Patrick was falling hard, and his modifications only made Patrick more <br />
desirable and romantic.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Glad to hear you say that. Here's to many more beautiful nights <br />
together,&quot; Dan said, reaching over to place his beefy hand on top of <br />
Patrick's monstrous quad. He wanted to see how wild he could drive <br />
Patrick with his touch... Patrick's breathing quickened, he was <br />
obviously straining to concentrate on the road, <br />
<br />
&quot;mmmff, c-cub...&quot; Dan retracted his hand...it only took a touch and <br />
Patrick's cock was throbbing hard, oozing pre against the dash of the <br />
truck. &quot;Almost there, Dan...&quot; He grinned, then heard a familiar <br />
chime...his cell phone? Dan reached into his pocket to grab his <br />
iPhone.<br />
<br />
He brought out his phone (quite a bit bigger than he remembered an <br />
iPhone being originally, but still smaller than the iPad-sized <br />
monstrosity Patrick carried around) and answered the call. &quot;Hello? I'm <br />
out on a date right now, so unless it's important...&quot;<br />
<br />
The caller ID said it was his dad, but the voice over the phone was so <br />
deep and rich...nothing like what he remember his father sounded like, <br />
&quot;Hey kiddo, just checking up on you and your first day of college. <br />
Hadn't heard from you all day, your dad and I just wanted to make sure <br />
you're settling into your dorm alright...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yeah, father, I am!&quot; he said, a thrill running through him. How <br />
could he be so DENSE. When he'd changed everyone, he'd really changed <br />
EVERYONE... including his parents and siblings! He somehow knew <br />
instinctively now that the one calling him was his father... and the <br />
other one was his dad. It was an odd distinction, but apparently <br />
important. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm doing really well... met an awesome, super-hot guy that took me <br />
out to dinner,&quot; he said, knowing that Patrick could hear every word.<br />
<br />
Patrick turned the wheel, parking the car, &quot;We're here, cub. Say hi to <br />
your father for me.&quot; Dan said his goodbyes, his father eagerly trying <br />
to get Dan to send him a cellphone pic of the two of them before he <br />
hung up. He paused, reflecting on his family, friends...everyone would <br />
be a huge hulking bear now. &quot;Cub? Ready?&quot; Dan snapped out of it, <br />
nodding and climbing down out of the car.<br />
<br />
Apparently Marcus lived off-campus in... wow... an expensive-looking <br />
house. But judging from the fancy restaurant Patrick had taken him to, <br />
he figured that Patrick's family must not be hurting for any money, so <br />
putting up one of their boys in a nice house where he could <br />
concentrate on his studies seemed plausible all of a sudden. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, he lives here by himself?&quot; Dan whistled. Patrick furrowed his <br />
brow grunting to fight off the growing wave of horniness he got from <br />
hearing Dan's voice, <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-yeah...Dad put him up here. He's the favourite...the Doctor-to-be.&quot; <br />
He mumbled, trailing off as they reached the front door. Dan gawked at <br />
the hugeness of it, the knockers shaped like bull heads with a ring in <br />
the nose. He rapped the knocker a few times against the door, hoping <br />
that he'd done it loud enough for the young man inside to hear. He <br />
liked Patrick, but knowing he had a brother who would be at least as <br />
big and horny and in love with him as he was made it irresistible for <br />
Dan to consider having them both. He'd had trouble getting even one <br />
boyfriend at the start of the day, and now he was considering <br />
balancing two!<br />
<br />
The massive door swung open, &quot;Hey Patty, I've got y--&quot; Marcus stopped <br />
mid-sentence, entranced when he saw Dan. He was definitely Patrick's <br />
twin, same fiery red fur, huge hulking 9-foot-tall frame, and he was <br />
standing there, naked in the doorway...&quot;I...um...&quot; He blinked, <br />
reaching up to adjust his glasses. (Patrick must wear contacts?) <br />
&quot;Patrick...c-come on in...who is your handsome cub friend?&quot; <br />
<br />
Patrick stepped in first, pushing Marcus aside with his huge gut. <br />
&quot;This is Dan. I won a date with him in the Alpha Bear contest. I'm <br />
his.&quot; He said, closing the door behind Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleasure to meet you, Marcus. I've heard a few things about you... <br />
but nothing that said you'd be as handsome as your brother,&quot; Dan <br />
smiled, sticking his hand out for Marcus to shake. He saw the titanic <br />
man simply looking at Dan, as if in disbelief that the man of his <br />
dreams had just walked into his house. Marcus shook his head, trying <br />
to clear the growing horniness...he had just gotten off minutes ago, <br />
but this cub was...was...<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing...&quot; He trailed off, his cock startling Dan as it grew hard <br />
and dribbled pre onto the floor. <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn't he?&quot; Patrick smiled down at Dan as he removed his kilt, <br />
revealing his own throbbing cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... both of you guys prove that what they say about redheads is <br />
true, huh?&quot; he smiled. He knew he had them both. &quot;You're both enormous <br />
beasts, super horny... and I'm guessing you're both falling pretty <br />
hard for me, huh? Even you, Marcus, just meeting me a few seconds <br />
ago...&quot;<br />
<br />
Patrick and Marcus couldn't take it anymore, both of them kneeling <br />
down to all fours...their submissive behaviour reminded Dan of the <br />
collard relief-room attendants. &quot;P-please, Dan!&quot; Marcus kissed Dan's <br />
ankle, quivering with lust, &quot;Please make me yours as well...I need to <br />
be yours. I NEED you to take me,&quot; <br />
<br />
Patrick chimed in, &quot;I need you to own me, collar me...I love you, <br />
Dan.&quot; Both of them were at Dan's feet, rubbing against his legs, <br />
grunting with need.  Dan was taken aback by this blatant submissive <br />
behavior. He'd expected some sluttiness... but this was above and <br />
beyond! <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, fellas! Take it easy! We can all have a lot of fun tonight, <br />
just settle down...&quot; he assured them, rubbing both of their crimson-<br />
colored heads in a paternal manner as they sucked up to him.  Patrick <br />
and Marcus shuddered at Dan's touch, their grunting growing more <br />
lustful. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, S-sir?&quot; Patrick stammered, overwhelmed by his natural need <br />
to submit. It was so powerful, he couldn't fight it even if he wanted <br />
to...he would always belong to Dan, even if Dan wasn't interested, <br />
Patrick could never love another. He knew his brother felt the same <br />
way...the redheaded curse. Or blessing...he never felt more alive!<br />
<br />
&quot;Patrick, suck my cock off. Marcus, flex for me,&quot; Dan orders them, <br />
seeing how eagerly they'll follow his orders. He needed to see just <br />
how deep this submissiveness went, with his own eyes.<br />
<br />
With the same speed and hungry need as the relief-room attendants, <br />
Patrick tugged off Dan's pants with little effort, taking Dan's hard <br />
cock easily in his big bearded mouth, &quot;mmmfff, t-thank you, Sir&quot; <br />
Patrick shuddered with pleasure, hunkered down on his knees, he <br />
grabbed Dan's ass with his thick, meaty hands and pulled him harder <br />
and deeper down his throat. Marcus' glasses were fogged up, but he <br />
still scrambled to his feet quickly going to a double-bicep pose, <br />
towering three-feet taller than Dan.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmfff... l-lat spread!&quot; Dan ordered, feeling Patrick's strong, <br />
thick, talented tongue run across his balls, swallowing them along <br />
with his cock. The giant was almost whimpering with the need to <br />
pleasure his smaller master. Dan felt drunk with the amount of sexual <br />
power he had over these two.  Macrus quickly obliged, he swelled wide, <br />
pushing his gut out...Marcus couldn't think of anything other than <br />
Dan, the rest of the world just disappeared when he was in subspace, <br />
<br />
&quot;Mmmf!&quot; He grunted, wincing from the overload of pleasure...his balls <br />
were full, aching even...and he knew they would continue to fill up. <br />
Redheads produced cum constantly. Patrick was feeling the same dull <br />
ache grow and intensify, his four-foot cock so big that it nestled <br />
between Dan's rump and the wall. Dan decided to tease the huge man and <br />
scooted back and forth, rubbing his beefy glutes over the surface of <br />
Patrick's monster-cock. The small gesture was more than the stud could <br />
bear and he started violently orgasming, his roar muffled this time by <br />
Dan's cock. Feeling the passion come up out of Patrick's throat made <br />
Dan's cock vibrate extraordinarily! <br />
<br />
Patrick shuddered through the orgasm, erupting cum across the hallway, <br />
Macrus' grunting turned to whimpering, his balls overfull with cum, <br />
the ache growing more intense by the second. Dan couldn't take it <br />
anymore, he gripped Patrick's thick red hair and came hard, the big <br />
bear gulping hungerly.<br />
<br />
Dan came, hard, for over a minute into his bear brute, feeling Patrick <br />
gratefully swallow his thick load, coaxing more out of him, not <br />
wanting to stop servicing his love. Once Dan stopped seeing stars, he <br />
looked up to see Marcus whimpering pathetically, cum oozing out of his <br />
cock and his balls looking twice as big as they had when he'd answered <br />
the door. This stud needed to cum, but he didn't want to without Dan's <br />
permission! Patrick licked Dan clean before sitting back against the <br />
wall, head down like an obedient puppy, <br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, Marcus.&quot; Dan smiled, kicking off his pants as he approached <br />
the whimpering giant. &quot;You may not cum until I give you permission, <br />
understand?&quot; <br />
<br />
Marcus barked &quot;Understood, Sir!&quot; Shaking more and more vigorously, his <br />
cock oozing excess cum as thick, gloppy pre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow... real big cumbags you have here... wonder how big they were <br />
when you were in high school...&quot; Dan pondered, reaching up to fondle <br />
the enormous, sensitive, throbbing testicles.  Marcus' whimpering grew <br />
louder, his sexual pain growing unbearable. Dan knew that Marcus and <br />
Patrick were loyal to a flaw...but he wanted to test just how much <br />
control he had. Stepping aside, Dan looked up at Marcus making strong <br />
eye contact. <br />
<br />
&quot;I order you to cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Marcus tried to say &quot;Yes Sir!&quot; but it came out as more of a deafening <br />
roar as he unleashed his massive load, the enormous amount of cum <br />
fountaining out of his four foot long cock streaming up in the air <br />
only to splash down heavily onto the expensive hard wood floor that <br />
his parents had paid for.  Marcus stumbled, his knees giving out as he <br />
came. Spraying Dan, Patrick, the walls...his orgasm lasted what felt <br />
like minutes before he could pull himself up to kneel at Dan's side. <br />
<br />
&quot;T-thank you, Sir.&quot; Patrick was hard again, licking the cum from Dan's <br />
belly and arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, does sex ever stop with you redheads?&quot; Dan chuckled, feeling <br />
another load in him as he allowed Marcus to start sucking him off. <br />
Marcus was less talented than his brother at this... it couldn't be <br />
that... he'd never done it before, could it?!  <br />
<br />
Marcus fumbled, pulling off, &quot;Something wrong, Sir?&quot; his balls were <br />
churning visibly, refilling slowly, already as big as a pair of <br />
basketballs in a thick, flashy sac. Dan passed his fingers through <br />
Marcus' hair, then looked over at Patrick, licking the cum off his <br />
arm. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you a virgin, Marcus?&quot;  Marcus' eyes started to water as he <br />
lowered his head in shame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Y-Yes, sir... I never gave myself any time for boys in school... I <br />
always needed the best grades, and as a redhead, if I'd allowed myself <br />
to have sex with other boys... I don't know that I'd ever stop. This <br />
is the first time I've done something other than jack off,&quot; he <br />
admitted guiltily.  Dan was surprised by Marcus' outburst of emotion, <br />
his brilliant green eyes glistening as he teared up, &quot;But...it was <br />
worth it. Because now I can devote myself to you.&quot; Dan looked over at <br />
Patrick, wondering why a big ginger like him was still single, <br />
<br />
&quot;And you, Patrick? How is it nobody has claimed you yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it's the same for any redhead, really: anonymous sex. Our <br />
parents taught us about it when we were little, said it was the only <br />
way we wouldn't get lovesick,&quot; he informed his future husbear. &quot;I've <br />
just done gloryholes... stuff like that where I never really meet the <br />
other guy. You're the first guy that I've really... bonded with face-<br />
to-face,&quot; he blushed. Marcus continued, nuzzling his face against <br />
Dan's semi-hard cock, <br />
<br />
&quot;It's what most redheads have to do...otherwise we might get stuck in <br />
abusive relationships, too enthralled with love to know better.&quot; He <br />
kissed Dan's thigh, &quot;S-sir...not that you would ever do that. And if <br />
you did abuse me, I probably deserved it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Dan felt simultaneously more aroused and a bit ashamed of himself. He <br />
couldn't be cruel with these men... these enormous, sexy, massive, <br />
inhumanly strong and virile men that would do anything he asked them <br />
to do no matter how degrading... Fuck! He was kinkier than he ever <br />
thought he would be! &quot;O-Of course not, Marcus!&quot; he stammered. &quot;I can <br />
teach you how to give better head, too. Why don't you try again?&quot; <br />
Patrick interrupted, butting his head into Dan's thigh, <br />
<br />
&quot;S-Sir?&quot; Between his clenched teeth was a thick leather belt. &quot;Please <br />
collar me, Sir. I...&quot; Patrick winced, trying to stave off his watery <br />
eyes, &quot;...I need to be yours, Sir.&quot; Dan took the thick leather band, <br />
it had to be 32-inches around, and as wide as his palm. It closed with <br />
a thick padlock. &quot;Even if you don't,&quot; Patrick whimpered, &quot;I will <br />
always be yours, Sir. I can never love another man...&quot; <br />
<br />
Dan could see how much it meant to Patrick and knew he couldn't <br />
refuse. &quot;Of course, stud. You'll be mine and I'll be yours,&quot; he <br />
growled sexily, fastening the collar around Patrick's massive neck <br />
that was as thick as his old waist and locked it with a secure <br />
&quot;click&quot;. He knew that Patrick would never take it off, even when he <br />
had to be the alpha in public. He could absolutely never deny that he <br />
was Dan's property and was put on earth to give Dan pleasure any way <br />
his master wished it.<br />
<br />
Patrick was overjoyed, kissing Dan's arm, thanking him profusely, his <br />
cock dribbling pre against Dan's leg, &quot;T-thank you, Sir! I-I love you <br />
so much...I knew it from the moment I saw you that I only existed to <br />
make you happy...&quot; He whimpered, tearing up...he was confused that his <br />
Master said he would be his...Dan was so wonderful, he could (and <br />
should) have anyone he desired... <br />
<br />
Marcus, rubbed his head against Dan, &quot;I know I just met you, Sir, but <br />
I hope you'll take me as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I will! There's enough of me for any stud who wants to be <br />
with me,&quot; he told them, making Marcus as ecstatic as his brother as <br />
they both nuzzled against the smaller bear's body like mewling 9-foot-<br />
tall kittens.  Marcus jumped up, shaking the floor and hustled off, <br />
his cock slapping him in the gut with a wet thud-thud-thud... <br />
<br />
&quot;Sigh...what have I gotten myself into...&quot; Smiled Dan, Patrick <br />
blissfully ignorant to the world around him, his universe revolved <br />
around Dan now. <br />
<br />
Marcus returned with his own collar and lock, &quot;Please, Sir?&quot; Offering <br />
it up to Dan as he got down on his knees. Dan smirked and locked it <br />
around Marcus' tree-trunk-like neck, an act that caused the giant's <br />
balls to seize and force him into another orgasm, coating Dan and his <br />
massive twin brother in his steaming hot seed.</p>
