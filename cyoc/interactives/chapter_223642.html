<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you enter your house Friday evening you don&#39;t have a moment to think before you hear the familiar ringing of your phone. When you pull it out you realize it&#39;s your sister. That&#39;s odd you think to yourself, what could she want? When you hear her voice on the other end of your phone she then blurts out excitedly &quot;Hey bro are you free this weekend?&quot; she asks you excitedly. Confused you just shrug and say &quot;yeah, why?&quot; but she doesn&#39;t respond and says &quot;Great! It&#39;s a surprise!&quot; You then hear a faint giggle as she hangs up the phone. You ponder for a moment trying to figure out what that was all about but shrug as you head to bed.<br />
<br />
You are woken up in the morning by the sound of loud knocking at your front door. Rolling your eyes as you get out of bed you knew immediately who it was as you dragged yourself out of bed and groggily answered the door to your all to cheery sister. &quot;Hey there big bro&quot; she says as she walks past you into your house. Rolling your eyes you close the door and follow her. When you get to the living room your sister is holding out some sort of drink. &quot;what is that?&quot; you ask as she downs a small sip of the concoction before offering the rest to you &quot;this is the surprise&quot; she says gleefully with a devilish grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Shrugging you grab the glass and look over the liquid closely. It looks nothing like any booze you&#39;ve ever had before. You eye your sister nervously but she just looks expectantly between you and the glass. Shrugging you gulp down the rest of the potion and then your sister starts laughing maniacally. &quot;what is i-&quot; you start but are cut off ash she shouts &quot;you are far too trusting brother, now you shall become my personal bodysu-&quot; but her words are cut off as she kneels over in pain &quot;n-no, this is not how it was supposed to happen&quot; she says nervously.<br />
<br />
You stare in horror as her body begins to crumple in on itself losing any rigidity it once had before finally collapsing into a big heap of skin with her insides seemingly vanishing. When you go to investigate you are horrified to see that all that is left of her is her skin, but strangely enough there is also a slit down her back starting at the top of her head and ending right at the top of her waist. Confused you then start going through her pockets in an effort to find some answers.<br />
<br />
Luckily you find what you are after, In her coat pocket you feel a folded up piece of paper and pull it out. When you open it you see that they are instructions of some kind, you then begin to read them.<br />
<br />
Hello there! thank you so much for purchasing our bodysuitifying potion (name still in development)<br />
Simply have the target drink a small amount of this potion and then drink the rest in order for them to instantaneously transform into a bodysuit for you to wear. While in the bodysuit it will feel like you are the individual in question and you might feel frightened that you are stuck as them forever but have no fear for as long as you pull the seam in the back apart with enough force then you will be able to effortlessly remove the 2nd skin.<br />
<br />
This process does not hurt the target in any way and the effects will wear off in two days time giving you plenty of time to try out life from the target&#39;s point of view. As a added bonus while you are wearing the target you will also be able to access their memories allowing you to pass as them more effortlessly.<br />
<br />
Below the instructions you see a bunch of legal gibberish saying stuff like how the company is not responsible for anything that happens while you are using the person bodysuit and so on. You then shake your head embarrassingly, she must have read these instructions wrong you tell yourself but then a sense of relief washes over you as you dread the thought of being nothing but a pile of skin. Questions then enter your mind as to why your sister wanted to do this and what she hoped to gain. Your eyes then glance over the part about accessing their memories.<br />
<br />
Maybe i can see her perspective, you think to yourself as you hold your sister turned bodysuit up. Dropping the instructions you then start putting your sister on hoping to get some answers failing to notice some fine print at the bottom of the instructions: Warning: prolonged wearing of the intended bodysuit could result in some mental confusion and if not removed by the end of the two day period could result in a permanent fusion of the two individuals, again we are not responsible for any reality altering affects this may have.<br />
<br />
As you slip one foot down your sisters leg hole it feels extremely tight at first like it&#39;s not going to fit but eventually it gives way and you fit your entire foot effortlessly. Next you do the same with your other leg and then start to hoist the skin up and over your arms aligning your fingers with hers. As you look down at her flattened breasts against your chest you think that there is no way anyone will be convinced you are actually your sister. But as you are thinking this you then are acutely aware of a chilling sensation against your legs.<br />
<br />
Looking down you realize that you can&#39;t discern your sisters skin from your own anymore when it comes to your legs and the feeling is extremely alien. Curious you reach down with your one exposed arm and pinch your exposed leg. &quot;ouch&quot; you shout as you realize that this is far stranger than you initially thought. How is this possible, you ponder to yourself. Shrugging you then pull the other half of your sister&#39;s skin over your other arm and then pause a moment before putting her head on. With most the suit on you are acutely aware of your proportions shifting under the suit to make you shaped more like your sister.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath and deciding you already went this far so you might as well see this through you then hoist the head skin over your own head and everything goes black for a moment. You can feel the slit in the back seal up and disappear seamlessly into your back like it was never even there. After a moment of your body shifting around in places you then regain your vision slowly and can see your sisters cascading brown hair in the corners of your vision. As you look down it feels like every part of her skin is your skin now and it&#39;s like you have always been your sister save for her breasts which still lay deflated on your flat chest.<br />
<br />
Suddenly as if by magic they begin to inflate and take shape. As they do you start to feel them better than you did prior to fully putting the suit on and once they have furnished filling out you can feel them too and the sensations they give off are completely alien to you. Reaching down you no longer feel a bulge in your crotch from where your member was but rather it&#39;s completely smooth down there save for a opening with some lips rimming the edge of the opening.<br />
<br />
You stick a dainty finger in curiously and let out a high pitched moan in your sister&#39;s voice. Gasping you then start to say things in your new feminine voice &quot;Hello my name is Cynthia and i have a big brother who is just the best big brother a girl could ever ask for&quot; you then start giggling thinking there was no way she would ever admit that herself. You then refocus as you remember the reason for doing this in the first place as you focus on peering into her memories.<br />
<br />
Suddenly you get a flashback of the night she bought the potion however it&#39;s from a first person perspective... her perspective... you correct yourself. You see that you are sitting at a computer that&#39;s decidedly more girly than the one you use on a daily basis. Ignoring her setup for a moment you then hear a voice in your head... your sister&#39;s voice... &quot;there i ordered the potion, now i will finally know what it&#39;s like to be the older one&quot; you then scoff internally &quot;is that the only reason she did this? To see what it&#39;s like?&quot; just then you are brought out of your flashback by the sound of a ringtone.<br />
<br />
Picking up your sister&#39;s purse you fish her phone out and see that there is a text from one of her friends. You open the text and immediately regret your decision. &quot;hey girl, it&#39;s your bestie in the whole entire world just checking in to see if we are down for drinks at the bar tonight, maybe this time we will finally find you a boyfriend!</p>
