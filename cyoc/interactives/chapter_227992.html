<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A middle-aged office worker enters the hula-hoop shop first thing in the morning just before rush hour, powerwalking through the store, hurriedly looking through the aisles for a gift for his daughter. Doped up on caffeine, his blood-shot eyes scan through the selections, fixating on a great deal, over a dozen hoops tied up as a bundle in twine laying in the clearance section – only five dollars. The man hurriedly appraises the item, the colorful, plastic rings seem sturdy enough, bearing tiny inscriptions of various animals and some hanzi characters along the perimeter – if somewhat faded.<br />
<br />
“Should do the trick.” The man nods to himself, jogging to the counter to ring up the toy. An absolutely ancient-looking Chinese lady appears behind a curtain of beads, slowly making her walk to the cashier, looking the impatient man skeptically in the eye.<br />
<br />
“Heya. Just getting this for my daughter.” The man holds up the tied-together rings. “Really nice a specialty shop like yours opened up around here. My daughter loves these things, ya know.”<br />
<br />
The old lady doesn’t speak at first, screwing her eyes shut to thin slits as the regarded the man for a few moments. A shaky, skeletal hand grasps the bungle of hoops, flipping through each one individually, appraising them slowly and carefully. The man isn’t happy about it taking so long, drumming his fingers against the counter as he peers down at his watch, clearing his throat obnoxiously before the woman finally began speaking.<br />
<br />
“Sir. Do you know what these are?” She raises an eyebrow towards him, pointing to the inscriptions on the plastic. “Try putting just your hand through this to see what it-“<br />
<br />
“Look, lady, I’ve gotta be in the office by eight, I don’t need an instruction manual on how a hula hoop works.” The man says in an aggravated tone, waving a five-dollar bill in her face. “The wife told me I forget to pick up a gift for my daughter to celebrate the end of the school year and I don’t have time for a lecture on plastic hoops.”<br />
<br />
“Sir, Listen…” The old lady sighs, “You are mistaken, this is no mere toy for little girls. Look at the inscription, they are meant to change-“<br />
<br />
The man slaps the payment on the table and swipes the bundle of hula-hoops, his face glowing red with frustration on how long the transaction took – how late he was going to be for work! He speeds home in his sedan, undoing the twine and slapping the collection of hoops on the kitchen table, scribbling down a quick note before speeding off towards the office.<br />
<br />
“For Lauren, <br />
<br />
Great job this past year at school.<br />
<br />
Love, dad.”<br />
__________________________<br />
<br />
Lauren wipes away the sleep from her eyes, waking up to the first day of summer break with the sun shining through her bedroom window. She makes her way down to the kitchen in her pajamas, only to find that her mom and dad have long since left for work, leaving the house empty save for her.<br />
<br />
Her eyes light up as she sees the gift on the table, colorful hula hoops of all sizes that her Dad left for her! She’s surprised and delighted that her dad got her so many different widths. An experienced hooper like her knew that different sizes were needed for all sorts of hula-speeds and tricks! She needs to break them in right away, she’s so excited to show off to her friends!<br />
<br />
Without a moment’s delay, she grabs one that’s about a meter wide. It’s covered in black and white stripes, the material feeling the light-yet-solid in her hand. Just as she’s ready to hula, she lets out a gasp in surprise as the ring starts to close in her grasp, its diameter getting smaller like magic!<br />
<br />
“Whoa!” She looks on in awe, holding the inner part of the plastic tight until it finally stops - evidentially reaching its smallest size. That left the hoop the size of a ring in the palm of her hand. The thickness of the ring itself didn’t change, but the hole in the middle had gotten so small that it could fit on her index finger!<br />
<br />
“Size changing hula-hoops…” She giggles giddily, closing her hand around the ring, burying it her grasp. “My friends Sarah and Marta will never believe this! But how do I make you go back…?”<br />
<br />
As if to answer her question, the hoop breaks open her grip, growing as big as a donut before stopping. “Oh! Why’d you stop?” Lauren asks the piece of plastic, coming up with an idea in her head. She picks the ring back, grasping it with both her palms making sure she’s only touching it on the outside of the ring. It does the trick, the ring starts getting bigger and bigger, returning to its original size – then more!<br />
<br />
“Oh! Grasp it by the inside makes it smaller, grasp it by the outside makes it bigger!” Lauren beams, elated that she had found the secret of these special hula-hoops all on her own. She tests the limits of the hoop’s growth, continuously pressing on the outside of the plastic rim until it stops at a diameter just under 3 meters – and not an ounce heavier than it was when it was small!<br />
<br />
She can’t believe it, she was gonna be the coolest kid in school next fall! She gets to work shrinking it back down to an acceptable meter in diameter before plopping it on the linoleum floor and stepping into the center.<br />
<br />
“Well you’re a really special hoop, but let’s see how good you hula!” Lauren exclaims, tugging with ring up to her waist before losing her balance, almost throwing up as she suddenly collapses on the floor.<br />
<br />
The ring clatters back down on the ground, the little girl rubbing a wound on her elbowas she peers down to see what had gone so wrong.<br />
<br />
Nothing. Everything looks the same… but that can’t be. She feels like she’d suddenly grown a foot higher, her bones and leg meat shifting at the speed-of-light; where they were supposed to be at one moment… then all wrong the next. Everything down from her waist feels huge for that one second she’d held the ring up, like her bottom half packed on twice her whole body weight right then and there!<br />
<br />
A kindling or worry dampens her cheery demeanor as she examines her legs once again, tugging up her pajama bottoms just to find her bones in the right place – her skin as soft and smooth as ever.<br />
<br />
“Nothing. Looks wrong…” she mumbles, trying to convince herself that as she strokes along her calves, reaching down to pick up the hoop once again. “… nothing feels wrong either. Just… my imagination…?”<br />
<br />
She shrugs, getting back up on two feet, plopping the ring on the floor yet again. “Don’t think you’ve won! Prepare to get hula’d, hoop!” She laughs, heaving it, keeling over the kitchen table as that sudden change racks her body up to her waist.<br />
<br />
This time it, she didn’t drop the ring – she’s holding it in place, the weird sensations of transformation lingering. A loud banging clop slams against the kitchen floor as Lauren just lays against the table petrified as her brain enumerates everything that feels wrong. Her spine isn’t bending right – she didn’t break it, but… she can’t stand upright wither. She’s naked… but… not exactly. It almost feels like she’s wearing her pajamas still, but the fuzzy material is attached to her now… twitching along with her inhuman hide. Everything feels heavy and bulky and wrong!<br />
<br />
A thick noodle of a tail swings just over her butt, swatting away a fly that came a little too close to her exposed rubbery pocket of a tail hole. Some else is different too… she got something else that doesn’t feel like it’s supposed to be there at all, a tight cage of leather is attached to her lower belly that sways fitfully as she wriggles around. Even worse… there’s something else… something big hanging between her legs, swinging low like a pendulum as she feels hot leather jostle against her thick, less-than-human thighs.<br />
<br />
She doesn’t want to look, but she just has to, her head arching back, a mouse-like shriek gasping from her throat as she finally sees it.<br />
<br />
Everything up to the hula-hoop around her waist… is… she’s a…<br />
<br />
“A zebra!!?” She screams, gritting her teeth as her eyes fixate on the tell-tale black and white stripes. A long, ropery equine tail twitches and shakes between her huge ass cheeks, writhing as the frightened girl puts-two-and-two together.<br />
<br />
“Hoop, you’re doing this…!?” She shivers, her hand grasping around the ring, making sure it doesn’t budge another inch up her body.<br />
<br />
Duh! She should have known due to the black and white coloring decorating the plastic… the ring’s ability to shrink and expand… it was magic! A magic hula hoop!<br />
<br />
Fear gives way to wonder yet again as she gains a new appreciation for her toy. It changes whoever passes through it into an animal, but it changes them back to human if they go through the other way.<br />
<br />
“Oh, thank God. I can change back! What a relief…!” Lauren sighs, nudging the ring back her waist, feeling that obnoxiously plump animal hide coating her lower belly tighten back into smooth, soft, girly skin.<br />
<br />
It’s safe! Her dad gifted them to her after all, so he had to know it’s safe for her! She wriggles the ring down further, giggling at the ticklish feeling of zebra fuzz stroking against her fingers as more of her changes back to normal.<br />
<br />
“Oh! There we go! Much better!” She huffs, feeling that bend in her spine revert back into a biped’s. She tugs down more and more, ready to pull that ring off her big fat zebra butt, only to sense her meaty rear clog the hoop.<br />
<br />
“Oof… hang on…” Lauren chuckles, realizing she’d accidentally been grasping the hoop by the inside, making it magically shrink around her bestial behind so it couldn’t get down further. She feels it clamp around her lower-belly like an over-tight belt, the ring shifting larger, but then smaller again whenever she tried to stroke the outside of it to make it bigger. Both her tummy and her hands were pressing at it from the inside and outside at the same time! Lauren quickly realizes the magic ring must have been getting confused, snapping tight like a Chinese finger trap around her waist as she tries to tug it off.<br />
<br />
“Oof. Not easy figuring this out sprawled out over the table…” she pouts, a question suddenly entering her mind. “Can I… stand?”<br />
<br />
She pushes off the table with a leap of faith, feeling her digitgrade equine legs wobble and clop as she tries to hold steady on two hooves like some sort of mythical zebra faun. It feels like she’s trying to walk on stilts and her butt shifting her center of mass way back doesn’t help one bit! She fights her lower half’s urge to fall over valiantly, her hooves clopping from the kitchen to the living room until she comes to a crash landing on the couch – the half-zebra gasping, her tongue hanging out as she feels something… go inside her.<br />
<br />
“Oh… ooo…” She rolls over, reaching back towards her tail, tugging it up before massaging lower, her tiny fingers jiggling the wobbly, leathery tube of zebra butthole that lie just underneath that noodle of a tail. It felt kinda moist, a glaze of sweat and anal juice slickening her black equine donut as it audibly slurped on something sticking half-inside-half-out of her butthole.<br />
<br />
“The TV remote…?” Lauren moans, realizing she must have fallen on top of it!  Her puckered asinine anus loudly suckles on the smooth piece of plastic like a pacifier, the silicon buttons rubbing along the slippery, soft bowels of her bestial rectum.<br />
<br />
She stifles another groan, the hooves tipping her animalistic legs curling at the sensation of getting stuffed with that unexpected dildo. Her tail hiked itself high, a viscous anal lube dribbling down the wrinkled grooves of her muscular anus, staining the couch in her musky, sex-scented zebra juice.<br />
<br />
The remote sank in a little deeper as her butthole undulates around it, the little girl gasping as she felt the tip of it smoosh up against a fleshy water-balloon full of pleasure. It was nudging up against her prostate, her whole body heating up as the foreign feeling of bestial pleasure racked her young mind. This was going too far… she has to pull it out before it starts to feel weirder. Her little fingers grasp along the slimy remote sticking out of her zebra ass, clutching it tight… slowly tugging it, feeling those buttons tickle her over-sensitive anal sphincter. She feels the last button pass along her anal grooves as the tip of the remote slurps out of her butthole, her black ring closing tight behind it as the buzz dies down. She shakily holds the remote in place… wondering if… should she really…?<br />
<br />
“HAAaahh!” She shrieks as she jams it back in, the need for feral pleasure too great! She feels that harsh plastic nudge against her prostate as her anal walls greedily slurp the remote down even deeper inside her. Her tail hole eats it all, Lauren braying in surprise as her fingers slide inside her with the utmost of ease too, that soft zebra flesh lewdly wetting her whole fist on in that slick anal lube.<br />
<br />
Lauren tugs her hand out, writhing in mind-numbing bliss as her anal walls shut tight around the remote control. She rolls around on the couch, rubbing her plump zebra anus against the upholstery as her zebra half lights up on fire. With a light-headed chuff, she peers down, her vision a little blurry as Lauren reaches a hand down to stroke the new parts that of her that she didn’t want to acknowledge at first.<br />
<br />
The hula-hoop didn’t just change her bottom half into a zebra, but a boy zebra! Two oblong balls the size of cantaloups hang taut in her black leathery scrotum, the tissue lewdly rubbing up between her muscular zebra thighs as that TV remote tickles her boy pussy. She reaches down, her tiny hand dwarfed by those equine testicles as she pets that sweaty, bestial ball sack.<br />
<br />
Doped up on stallion hormones, Lauren feels pride well up inside her as she rubs her ebony-black treasures. The sheer size and heft of her zebra balls surpass her pride for her good grades and hula-hoop skills, they’re better than both those combined. She doesn’t fully understand it… but the thought of being a boy… a big, strong musky stud of a zebra stallion made her feel higher than she’d ever been!<br />
<br />
“Hah… yes… yes… yes, yes, yes, YES!” She whinnies through her trembling little lips as fiery heat trickles through her loins. All that attention to her new boy parts help erect the last special thing her zebra body had to show her. An ebony, rubbery glans of equine cock stretches out her sheath, pulsing as it slithers larger, inch by inch. She shoots a dopey look down at that expanding python of stallionhood, feeling the flared tip rub along her soft girly belly, bestial flesh tickling her as it dribbles a thick goo of precum that oozes down her stomach.<br />
<br />
She reaches both hands around it, finding its girth is far too large for her little hands hold. Lauren grasps it as best she could underneath that bloated cock tip and stroked her hand downward, feeling that rubbery muscle of horse cock throb in her grasp as veins pulse, forcing it out even longer. She adores the sensation of thick animal dick coming to life in her grasp, her hands pinching around that rubbery medial ring as that obnoxious horse glans presses against the underside of her chin. Laruen can’t help herself, arching her head down, her nose eskimo kissing that sizzling-hot, spongy cock head as her lips make out with her own equine urethra.<br />
<br />
It is her first kiss – her first kiss with a boy. It’s her. She’s the boy. She loves her zebra self, and she wouldn’t have it any other way!<br />
<br />
She hugs her zebra dick flush against her, her perky nipples rubbing along that rod of equine maleness. Hot, thick dollops of zebra pre-jizz splash into her mouth as her lips lap and nibble along that tough, leathery cock skin. She lets out ditzy giggles as the air around her is suffocated with the intoxicating perfume of stallion lust, her own acrid beast musk making the air sticky, covering everything with a humid sheen of sex-scented sweat.<br />
<br />
Her cock spanks against her belly, flexing wider and longer as it bats the little girl in her face. Lauren isn’t at all deterred, using the opportunity to stick her tongue into her bulbous piss hole, licking up that viscous horse pre as if she were drinking from a water fountain, her balls spasming, making the little girl crumple up in a fetal ball of pleasure as orgasmic bliss wracks her brain!<br />
<br />
A steaming hot hose of zebra cum jets against her lips, half flooding her tiny maw in a sticky torrent of foal-batter as the rest oozes across her face. Her long, blonde hair is coated with opalescent zebra sperm, her tiny breasts soaked in animal spunk. She rides her own orgasm, holding her cock tight to her lips as jizz spews all over the couch, staining everything in the hot, heady stink of bestial sex.<br />
<br />
It lasts a whole minute before the deluge of cum starts to dissipate, that muscular python of black zebra dick starting to grow flaccid as Lauren’s balls spurt out all they have to give. Lauren doesn’t quit at all, kissing and stroking her dick even as it grows limp, lapping and cleaning the cum off the tip as she worships her bestial maleness, wishing that stream of cum would never end.<br />
<br />
It does end though, her orgasm fading into post-coital bliss as she stretches out on the cum-soaked couch, feeling her human skin covered in the hot, gooey zebra cum. She quickly learns that boys get extra tired after sex, her whole body growing just as exhausted as her cock as her eyes begin to shut. She holds her rubbery, wobbly zebra dick tight to her tummy like a beloved plushie as she starts to fall asleep, kissing and licking it, in love with her stallion half.</p>
