<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;We leave as soon as everyone is ready,&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I could be going with you guys,&quot; Colin said with a sigh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our missions are too dangerous for you Colin,&quot; Justin said. &quot;I would love to have you come with but it's not possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Colin said getting up and leaving looking dejected.<br />
<br />
&quot;We need to get ready and leave as soon as possible,&quot; Michael said getting up. &quot;The longer we delay the colder the trail becomes.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boys left while Beth secured the briefing on her laptop. She didn't need the amount of preparation that the boys did. They had to pick out clothes and weapons they would be taking with them while she just had to pick out clothes. After she had secured the briefing she opened the program and typed in Colin's name. What came up surprised her. Most of the information was what she expected but there were some that caught her eye.<br />
<br />
NAME: Colin/Colleen Stanish<br />
<br />
JOB: Elementary school student/secret agent<br />
<br />
FRIENDS: 2<br />
<br />
ENEMIES: 4<br />
<br />
STRENGTH: 10 tons<br />
<br />
WEAPON KNOWLEDGE:<br />
- Expert marksman<br />
- Expert archer<br />
- Expert with a bo (wooden staff)<br />
<br />
OTHERWORLDLY ABILITIES:<br />
- Pyrokinesis<br />
- Can shift between male and female forms at will<br />
- Can communicate with animals<br />
- Super level endurance and stamina<br />
<br />
Beth quickly set about encrypting everything important on every computer in the house. She hoped for Justin's sake that she was wrong in what she was thinking but Colin's profile worried her. There were four Defenders and Colin had four enemies. He had tremendous strength, not on par with the Stanton boys but more than any ordinary human, and he could communicate with animals. Right now he's a suspect in the murder of Mr. and Mrs. McKnoll. Once she finished encrypting everything and making it near impossible for anyone except her to access the program she headed up to Justin's room knowing that Colin would be there.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;I hope you get back soon,&quot; Colin said as Justin got ready for the mission. &quot;Couldn't you postpone leaving so we could have some fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Michael and Beth wouldn't be happy with that,&quot; Justin said shaking his head. &quot;You know I don't like making Beth unhappy. She's kicked my butt a few times when we've had an argument.&quot; Justin shuddered remembering the last argument they had. While Beth wasn't anywhere near as strong as he was her telekinesis was. She would add her telekinesis to her physical strength in her kicks and punches. Also being able to create hallucinations gave her a big advantage. Of course his magic gave him an advantage though when fighting Beth he rarely got a chance to use it. Beth never came out unscathed but she usually was less injured than he was at the end.<br />
<br />
&quot;You have to stand up to them,&quot; Colin said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd like to see you be so confident once you have a fight with Beth,&quot; Justin said with a little chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;No thanks,&quot; Colin said holding up his hands. &quot;She would hand my butt to me and she wouldn't have to use her powers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I want to fight you Colin,&quot; Beth said from the door to Justin's room. &quot;Or would you prefer me to call you Colleen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Justin and Colin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on and fight me,&quot; Beth said looking at Colin.<br />
<br />
Justin looked at Beth and said, &quot;You fighting him wouldn't be fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think it would be,&quot; Beth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about your mission though?&quot; Colin asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can wait,&quot; Beth said seeming to be serious.<br />
<br />
Justin's jaw dropped. Beth saying a mission can wait. That isn't like her at all. An idea occurred to him and glaring at Beth asked, &quot;Who are you and what did you do with Beth?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know how it seems with me saying a mission can wait,&quot; Beth said flicking her eyes between the two. &quot;I don't normally say a mission can wait after all. I have my reasons though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She's an imposter,&quot; Colin said. &quot;Do you think I could take her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Justin said nodding. &quot;If you want to try go ahead. I'll be right here if you get in trouble.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin immediately launched an attack which Beth blocked with ease. Colin kept attacking and Beth kept blocking. With each block Colin seemed to become more and more surprised. The blows quickly began to send shock waves out which was impossible for a normal human which Colin was suppose to be. Suddenly Colin stopped attacking physically. He raised his hand and a jet of flame shot out of it. &quot;What the heck?&quot; Justin asked as Beth was engulfed in flames.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can explain Justin,&quot; Colin said looking scared.<br />
<br />
&quot;You better start right now,&quot; Justin said seeing red.<br />
<br />
&quot;As you can see I'm not an ordinary human,&quot; Colin said running his hand through his hair. &quot;I'm like you. I can create and control fire, I can change my sex, I can lift 10 tons, and I can communicate with animals.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last two clicked in Justin's brain and he asked, &quot;Did you kill Mr. and Mrs. McKnoll?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Colin said instantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I believe him,&quot; Beth said from right beside Justin.<br />
<br />
Justin jumped and looked around but saw no one. &quot;Where are you Beth?&quot; he asked feeling around in the air beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right here,&quot; Beth said as she suddenly appeared on Justin's other side. She looked at Colin and asked, &quot;Could you put out the fire please?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Colin said and waved his hand at the fire which went out. &quot;How did you know?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell you that right now,&quot; Beth said. &quot;Which government do you work for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin sighed and said, &quot;I work for the Canadian government same as you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why haven't we heard about you before then?&quot; Justin asked finding this hard to believe.<br />
<br />
&quot;They wanted me to spy on you,&quot; Colin said looking down. &quot;They got a report about a year ago that said the Defenders were planning on going rouge. It was at that time they found and trained me. They figured if I became friends with you that I could find out if you were planning on going rouge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And what have you told them?&quot; Michael asked coming in. He had evidently overheard what Colin had said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I've told them that I see no signs of the Defenders going rouge,&quot; Colin said cringing away from Michael.<br />
<br />
Beth meanwhile had opened her laptop and was typing furiously. Finally she said, &quot;He's telling the truth. The tip was from an anonymous source but there was a few pictures of what look like us talking to Russian agents.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we have talked to Russian agents before,&quot; Michael said shrugging his shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;We never talked to these agents,&quot; Beth said. &quot;The photo's a fake though it's a very good one. I've just told our contact what to look for in it.  By the time we're in Toronto they should know the truth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we should get going then,&quot; Michael said. &quot;We still have our mission.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I agree but Colin is coming with us,&quot; Beth said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because he'd be a good addition to have,&quot; Beth said. &quot;He can communicate with animals which no one pays attention to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your point,&quot; Michael said thinking. &quot;Ok Colin can come with us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could I borrow some of your clothes Beth?&quot; Colin asked. &quot;I prefer to be Colleen when I can since that's who I was born as.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure,&quot; Beth said closing her laptop and walking to the door. &quot;Follow me to my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Justin sighed as he watched Beth and Colin leave. He was going to have to get used to Colin as Colleen. Good thing he was Bi.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Beth opened the door to her room and led Colin inside. &quot;Will my clothes fit you when you change?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think so,&quot; Colin said. &quot;I'm 4'11&quot; when I'm Colleen and my breasts are AA size.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I guess they will fit you,&quot; Beth said smiling. &quot;Pick out what you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Colin said as he went over to Beth's dresser.<br />
<br />
Beth went to her closet and opened the secret panel she had there. She took out four black outfits and then a couple fancy evening dresses that were too large for her right now but they would fit once she aged herself. She had to do that at times to get into parties to gather intel. Charles usually accompanied her in the form of a necklace. He was able to shape shift too but it was only into a necklace, panties, and a ring. Even though he was limited to shifting into those three things he was able to vary what he looked like. Beth smiled as she remembered one mission where they had to get into a house that was sealed up tighter than the space station. Charles went in as the woman's panties and once inside he was able to let them in. She turned around and asked, &quot;Do you have everything picked out Colin?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Colin said nodding. &quot;Now I just need to change my sex.&quot; Beth watched as Colin started shrinking. He was a tall boy being just an inch taller than Justin. As he shrank his clothes did become loose on him though he held up his pants so he wouldn't expose himself to her. His body seemed to slim a bit from what Beth could tell from his arms and hands. His hair grew longer until it was down to mid back and changed to platinum blonde. His eyes changed to a bright blue while his face became more feminine. Finally he seemed to be done since he took off his clothes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I think Justin will still love you,&quot; Beth said with a smile. &quot;If you two weren't an item I would snatch you up myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Colleen blushed and said, &quot;Well if Justin doesn't want me anymore maybe you'll have the chance.&quot;<br />
<br />
Beth smiled and felt a little flutter in her stomach. She didn't think that Justin would dump Colin but maybe he wouldn't want Colleen. Beth wasn't attracted to Colin but she was attracted to Colleen. Maybe Justin would feel the same way. Of course judging by how Colleen had blushed and the way she was slowly putting her clothes on Beth thought that Colleen was attracted to her as well. Colin definitely wasn't attracted to her but instead to Justin. &quot;We should hurry,&quot; she said as she turned away from the sight of Colleen getting dressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you like the show?&quot; Colleen asked in a pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I do,&quot; Beth said opening a hidden panel in the wall and taking out her lightsabers and checking the charge on each of them. &quot;We still have a mission though and we need to get to it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You said before that the mission could wait though,&quot; Colleen said right behind Beth and stroking her shoulder.<br />
<br />
Beth spun around and received a kiss from Colleen. She wanted to just melt into the kiss but managed to push her away saying, &quot;We don't know if Justin will dump you so this is inappropriate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When I'm Colleen and think of Justin I don't feel much for him,&quot; Colleen said. &quot;It's the same when I'm Colin and think of you. But when I think of you when I'm Colleen I feel the same thing I do when I'm Colin and think of Justin. I know I'll have to tell Justin this and I hope he'll understand. But I want to have some fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There'll be plenty of time for fun on the train,&quot; Beth said holding out her hand to stop Colleen's advance. &quot;Now finish getting dressed so we can leave.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I want to have fun,&quot; Colleen said pouting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at it this way,&quot; Beth said having a hard time controlling herself. &quot;The sooner we leave the sooner you can have fun as either Colin or Colleen. Since it will take us a couple hours to get to Toronto you might have fun as both.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh,&quot; Colleen squealed and hurried to finish dressing.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
A half hour later they were all on their special train. It tunneled underground by pushing the earth aside and letting it squeeze back together behind it. The train had a top speed of a hundred miles per hour but they didn't have to worry about traffic nor the twists and turns of the roads. The train also served as a mobile base for them being packed with equipment. There was a lift that would enable them to go up to the surface. It was almost the perfect base since it was very difficult to get into. There were four bedrooms in it for those missions that had them away from home for more than a day. It also had a library, a training room, a game room, and a briefing room so they had something to do during their trip. Before they had set off Colleen had talked to Justin and as it turned out Justin didn't have the same feelings for Colleen as he did for Colin. It was decided that Justin and Beth would share, Justin getting Colin and Beth getting Colleen. Now Colin/Colleen was going to have some fun but who with?</p>
