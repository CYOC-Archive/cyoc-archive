<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In the room of the new mansion that belonged to Nelson and his four mates, were <br />
gathered the gallery  wolves minus of course Betty who was still on Big Bad Island. <br />
<br />
The eleven wolves, two males and nine females, sat, stood, and leaned in a semi-circle. <br />
<br />
&quot;So everyone's decided whose going to and whose not?&quot;  Asked the black furred and gray <br />
chested Robert to the rest of his sub-pack. <br />
<br />
Everyone nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;Shouldn't we wait for Betty?&quot; Trinity asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She has Lawrence she said, her nephew, you know exactly what her answer would be <br />
anyway.&quot; Nelson the plain brown and tan brown reply mix male replied.<br />
<br />
Everyone again nodded at this. <br />
<br />
&quot;So has everyone looked over this and approved?&quot; Robert asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't approve of any of this.&quot; The almost blond almost brown Wendy replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;And it's your choice not to.&quot; Helen replied, whose fur was gray and white and whose <br />
pattern was like Ashley's and Millie's. <br />
<br />
&quot;We VOTED Wendy,&quot; Robert reminded her, &quot;It was a majority in favor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy crossed her arms and turned her head.<br />
<br />
&quot;So did you read it over and approve of it?&quot; Robert asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;If I can't convince you otherwise then yes...&quot; Wendy replied crossed.<br />
<br />
 Robert hugged her. &quot;I'm sorry dear.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You can still join us.&quot; Said Kira. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not a chance.&quot; Wendy replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your choice.&quot; Kira shrugged.<br />
<br />
The white and pink Kimberly laid back and stretched, (unaware of her fellow pink's <br />
Maxine's split into Ming and Xing) &quot;I don't see why we're being so careful, I mean, if the <br />
witch's ghosts or whatever are gone now then the game is just a game now right? It can't <br />
cheat anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Doesn't mean you can't screw yourself over by saying something very stupid,&quot; Wendy <br />
pointed out, &quot;There was a story of a little boy who found a wishing marble, saw a lion, <br />
panicked, and wished he was a rock, but rock's can speak, so he couldn't use the marble <br />
to turn back, if his parents hadn't picnicked on that rock and wished there son was there <br />
with them, and the marble apparently chose to be kind, he'd have stayed that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Which is why we included more than a few fail safes.&quot; Nelson said. <br />
<br />
Robert said, &quot;So... everyone who wants to, step on the other side of the room, everyone <br />
who doesn't want to, stand by me.&quot; <br />
<br />
Nelson, Helen, Leslie, and Kira all walked to the other side of the room instantly. <br />
<br />
Robert, Rose, Kimberly, and Wendy assembled on the other side. <br />
<br />
Jessica, Michelle, and Trinity looked somewhat divided. <br />
<br />
Trinity after a few moments of looking between the group stood by Robert. <br />
<br />
Michelle and Jessica looked at the two groups look, whispered a few things to each other, <br />
hugged and stepped apart. <br />
<br />
They started to walk towards one group, then both instantly changed their minds and went <br />
to the other. <br />
<br />
The red and green Jessica stood by Robert. Michelle chose to be with Nelson. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you positively absolutely sure? All of you?&quot; Nelson asked the four she wolves with <br />
him. <br />
<br />
Helen shrugged, said, &quot;A lot has changed in just fifty years... I had no family, no heirs, I <br />
had actually had a ton of debt when I was stoned, and... I really want to see how the world <br />
will change in another fifty years, another fifty after that, and another fifty after that.&quot; <br />
<br />
The black and brown Leslie nodded, &quot;If there is no afterlife, then I'd rather not face <br />
oblivion. If there's a judgement day, then I want to be here on Earth to witness it.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kira said, &quot;I murdered five people who I decided were guilty but the law decided were <br />
innocent... then it turns out the estate owner I idolized -really did- just pinned the blame <br />
on his slaves for murdering his wife...  I'd be sentenced to life in prison or executed <br />
anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy implored, &quot;No one has to know!&quot;<br />
<br />
The very dark brown Kira shrugged, almost amused, &quot;I'd know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Michel?&quot; The garish red and green Jessica asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see it Jessica!&quot; the red-orange MIchelle replied actually sounding excited. &quot;I <br />
WANT to see how long this country lasts. I WANT to see if China, Mexico or the Native <br />
Americans take over the country. And... I want to be a witness to seeing if this new pack of <br />
our survives... I'll be the ultimate eternal witness.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unable to move, unable to speak, unable to taste--&quot; Wendy began. <br />
<br />
&quot;I've gotten used to it.&quot; Michelle smiled and nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Besides,&quot; Nelson said, &quot;Alpha female loves living statues, and the five she had are now <br />
part of the pack... we shall be our own gift to her... &quot;<br />
<br />
Robert said, &quot;Just in case the effects of the game fail you, our families will look after you <br />
and for you forever then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This isn't an end silly!&quot; Kira laughed putting her hands on her hips, &quot;This is just another <br />
beginning.&quot;<br />
<br />
Robert sighed, and then spoke the words that had been spoken to him, when he had been <br />
Rebecca, a heiress looking to run away from high society went a man with a devil's beard <br />
had offered her a way to escape it without saying how... <br />
<br />
&quot;All right then. Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform and Dare.&quot; The five replied together.<br />
<br />
&quot;You will become statues of the scale you wish, of the material you wish, you shall never <br />
be broken, people will not pay you mind if you wish, you will be fully aware as shall be <br />
your senses able to look and hear and feel in any direction you wish without using your <br />
eyes. You may sleep when you wish as long as you wish. Your poses will be as you wish <br />
them and absorb the knowledge around you as you wish it. You shall never be neglected <br />
or forgotten or damaged. You will be able to speak to each other mentally over any <br />
distance unless you wish yourself some privacy. Any number of you may become flesh and <br />
blood again and art again, at any time by majority vote so you'll never be able to abandon <br />
each other. Your memories will be flawless. You will be at peace with yourselves in your <br />
statue state. People will recognize you as a wolf whose become a statue or a statue made <br />
in the image of a wolf as you wish it as you wish it. If you are ever stolen or lost, you shall <br />
ultimately find your way back to each other and be among people in a practical amount of <br />
time before becoming lonely. You will go to where you want to be for your transformation <br />
and no one will stop you or delay you.  Your bases will have small plaques with your <br />
names on them and a small message of your choice. Our lines' fates will always be bound <br />
to yours. This is your transform and dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Michelle said blinking away tears. <br />
<br />
The name on the out side of Nelson's room changed to Gallery. Kira and Michelle walked <br />
out of the room and split way instantly. <br />
<br />
Kira walked until she was right at the mid-staircase in the entry hall between the two sets <br />
of stairs. She grinned, put her feet apart, and put her hands on her hips and stuck out her <br />
hips and chest. Her body transmuted to bronze, a glaze very closely resembling her fur. <br />
The stone base appeared at her feet as she grew to a 150% scale statue till she was larger <br />
than even the largest of the male pride members.  The name Kira appeared on the base <br />
along with the message, 'Live Like You're Dying.' <br />
<br />
Beatrice entered the foyer a minute later getting some more towels for their beaten and <br />
broken pack members and allies and took one look at the statue and said, &quot;I'm glade <br />
that's one job we'll never have to do again.&quot; Beatrice reminisced remembering helping <br />
carrying and assembling the dark bronze Alpha Female had wanted so badly. <br />
<br />
Michelle walked straight to the library. She calmly opened the door and saw Kaylee, &quot;Alpha <br />
Female.&quot; She nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Red-Orange.&quot; Kaylee nodded back.<br />
<br />
Martha suppressed a groan.  She had been careful not tell the children that she could turn <br />
people into loyal and devoted wolf people during the full and new moon by them seeing <br />
her dance (causing them to dance with her as they changed). <br />
<br />
Michelle saw the human children and saw the book they were reading, and she waved at <br />
them, they nervously waved back. <br />
<br />
Michelle stood in front of the window, arched her back, put her arms above her head, and <br />
stood on her digigrated feet perfectly balanced. She closed her eyes, wore a serene smile, <br />
and was red and orange swirled glass, becoming half scale, her shadowing creating a light <br />
show almost. Her name appeared on the base, along with the phrase 'Eternal Witness.' <br />
<br />
Kaylee who had observed the entire transformation came up to the statue and began to <br />
run her hands over it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mistress.&quot; Martha said, &quot;Be careful! You'll scratch it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Kaylee didn't stop grinning or feeling over the statue (who was enjoying the feeling very <br />
much), &quot;Don't be a worry wart Omega, this thing never scratches...&quot; <br />
<br />
Jenny said, &quot;I'm surprised Alice doesn't find that thing creepy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If I was to find the statue Michelle creepy, does that mean that  you find the tailor's <br />
dummies found at the clothing shop creepy?&quot; Alice replied. <br />
<br />
&quot;Point.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It's not like we go there anyway!&quot; Marcy giggled. <br />
<br />
'Kira? How do you feel?' Michelle asked.<br />
<br />
'Like a million bucks! You?' Came Kira's mental voice. <br />
<br />
'I'll tell you after I finnish reading all the books in the library.'<br />
<br />
'Huh? You can do that?'<br />
<br />
'Our senses aren't bound that way anymore remember?'<br />
<br />
'That'll take you what, a thousand years?' <br />
<br />
'Eleven hundred years actually I think given how fast I read... ' Michelle began to read a <br />
book that was in the far corner of the room closed and on the bottom shelf. 'It was the <br />
best of times, it was the worst of times.' <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Back in the 'new' Gallery, Helen, Nelson, and Leslie all remained life size. Their bed <br />
vanished replaced by a viewer's couch and some art magazines. The three became highly <br />
polished marble, Nelson red marble, Leslie black marble, and Helen white marble.  Nelson <br />
assumed the pose of 'The Thinker' (a contrast on his 'come and get me boys!' pose his <br />
original stratification had.). Helen was in a fantastic dancing pose looking to be a photo <br />
shoot of the moment.  Leslie in a sitting/reading pose.  Nelson's base read, 'Thinker 2.0', <br />
Helen's 'Live Every Moment' and Leslie's 'Learn All You Can.'  <br />
<br />
Robert came up to Nelson and put a paw on his marble shoulder, &quot;I promise Nelson, even <br />
without the dare, our families will always look after you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kimberly could have sworn for a moment that Nelson's emblem changed to read 'Thanks <br />
dude.' <br />
<br />
++++++++<br />
<br />
<br />
The parents driven by cocern for their children would become living stone lion/dragon <br />
hybrids like the gargoyles.<br />
<br />
By the time the rescue would come, the wolves would split pyically into twins again. The <br />
island was free of Kurse's insanity and malice, it was not free of her power: that was now a <br />
natural part of the this place much like Glendale. But the collective will of the parents, and <br />
the collective will of the former twins, would take the reins of this power even if only <br />
subconsciously and only if it's ability to change things only extended as far as big bad <br />
island but like Glendale were just as permanent. And to exist, in of itself gave one a right <br />
to exist did it not?  And the parents, had much stronger drive and will right now than any <br />
of the passengers put together.  It would change those who genuinely wished it... even if <br />
the person was only aware of how truly badly they wanted it subconsciously. Now being <br />
filtered by Marie rather than Kurse, it would stop short of murder or suicide however. <br />
<br />
Free of Kurse's overwhelming hatred for civilization, the island bean to bloom colorful <br />
flowers with no repeating patterns making each step a new experience. The dirt clearing <br />
becoming a tile pattern, changing once every twenty four hours so the dance may not ever <br />
be exactly the same. The trees themselves growing in ways that were unpredictable... and <br />
yet.. never crashed into each other or struck one another. The shape, color, texture, and <br />
flavor of the fruits that would grow were equally unpredictable... but not maliciously so as <br />
Kurse herself had been. <br />
<br />
The collection of souls known collectively as Fox and Elise gasped and fell onto her hands <br />
and knees. <br />
<br />
&quot;You saw it too?&quot; 'Fox' asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;We did.&quot; 'Elise' answered. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know that'll screw up a lot of families if that happens.&quot; 'Fox' said. <br />
<br />
&quot;We know.&quot; 'Elise' nodded. &quot;That's why we can't let it happen. And...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Say it, it's alright, we're feeling it too.&quot; 'Fox' encouraged, letting 'her' know not to be <br />
ashamed. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can't live like this sisters!&quot; 'Elise' implored, &quot;We're suffocating! We're being crushed to <br />
death! It's maddening! The four of us can't survive like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We feel the same way too.&quot; 'Fox' nodded. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's a way we can fix this if we want.&quot; 'Elise' thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;We know.&quot; 'Fox' answered, &quot;When you stop and think about it, I think it's what was bound <br />
to happen from the beginning. Fox and Elise knew what they were giving up. Little Ami <br />
might have been able to force our bodies back together, but our souls are our own. It's <br />
nice Fox and Elise get to be remembered but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're not them.&quot; The midnight lioness said, &quot;We can't be them, we'll never be them. All <br />
four of us have Elise's memories, and her skills but...&quot; 'Elise' hugged 'herself' , &quot;You know <br />
if multiple personality wasn't a load of bull, this is what it would feel like most of us bet.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ditto.&quot; 'Fox' sighed. &quot;So, figured out how to say it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We've been talking about it among ourselves ever since the pride and pack left.&quot; Elise <br />
said. <br />
<br />
&quot;We figured. Well, I'm Nane and I figured you guys were gonna try something stupid. I'm <br />
Saba and figured we'd wait a day to see if we could adjust. We're Tano and Sita we're <br />
wondering if we should be bikini dolls again this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Tatuli, and I'm Neili, we're wondering if we should be art again this time too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Tano, and seriously, we know this is selfish of us anyway, but this is still something <br />
we gotta do anyway, if that makes sense.&quot; 'Fox' said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Barely.&quot; 'Elise' replied.  &quot;I'm Moja, and this could be seen as killing two birds with one <br />
stone you guys know, or three.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Fox' laid back, &quot;Nane here, and seriously we all know there's no right solution here. There <br />
never was.  The grown ups are gonna get hurt or they'll change themselves, since Marie, <br />
that's her name now by the way, we can feel it through the filtered chaos, won't be able to <br />
install enough fail-safes before it happens... Saba here, It's like that Futurama cartoon, <br />
&quot;You gotta do whathca gotta go.&quot; <br />
<br />
'Elise' nodded, &quot;Right.  To sum it up, cheating against a cheater is cheating in of itself. And <br />
someone always ends up paying. And it might as well be us.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gill's gonna be mad at losing two officers.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hopefully the eight of us will be good cops once we're adults again. And until then I'm <br />
sure we can help out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, have all four of you say it together or otherwise it won't work.&quot; 'Fox' said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Right.&quot; 'Elise' nodded. &quot;Won't this count as a changing of our forms though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll still be civilized lionesses with our 'real love clause' so I don't see how.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then... on three, one, two, three:&quot; <br />
<br />
The two bodies said to each other together. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Transform or Dare.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Become four separate bodies for each of your souls, be as real as any other soul, have as <br />
much right to exist, Elise and Fox were our respective mothers, they gave their lives to <br />
save the world. We're looked after by the rest of the pack. Our mothers are remembered as <br />
heroes. With full decked out honors, statue in her glor-NANE!- -Sorry...- We will make it <br />
through the police academy in record time in a good way. We can go anywhere in the <br />
world in three steps as long as know where we are going and as long as we can survive <br />
there for a realistic amount of time. We can take anyone with us as long as they were <br />
willing and won't be immediately harmed by the new environment long term or short term. <br />
They WON'T be transformed in ANY way. We can sense magic and it's nature, type, area, <br />
intensity, and mechanics at a practical distance. Our heirs, and their heirs and so on and <br />
so forth will all be humane and civilized and also have their power and use it wisely for <br />
other's sake. The four of us will be able to speak to each other mentally if we wish it <br />
unless we want privacy.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a faint glow of light. <br />
<br />
Moja looked at the world and her three sisters, all of them were Mary's age (well younger <br />
by eight months). Tano and her sisters were much the same that way. All of them were <br />
bald as proper lionesses are.  Moja and her sisters had midnight colored fur and yellow <br />
eyes with a hint of rust colored fur in it,  while Fox's daughters similar color to their <br />
mother and bright blue eyes but with a ting of fur color like one of the pride's males. <br />
<br />
Nane began giggling and doing several back flips running up a tree and then did a hand <br />
stand. <br />
<br />
Tano sighed, &quot;Come on sis, we have some families to save.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, like super man!&quot; Nane struck a dramatic pose.<br />
<br />
Moja, remembering their connection when Kurse's puppets, thought, 'She and Amber <br />
would SO get along... wait... they DO get along like that year at the squirt gun tournament <br />
she and her... FOCUS GIRL!' <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Here we go!&quot; Moja said loudly getting her sisters and the other four set's <br />
attention. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Calvary's here!&quot; Nane declared teleporting right on top of the library table. <br />
<br />
&quot;OFF THE TABLE OFF THE TABLE!&quot; Martha's two heads barked before Nane scratched up <br />
the top of the table by forgetting to sheathe her claws... again... <br />
<br />
&quot;Meaning all of us.&quot; Said Moja teleporting in the doorway.  Tano and Sita teleported in on <br />
either side of the color glass statue on the window cill kicking her legs while Saba <br />
teleported into an empty chair with her legs up on the same table her sister was standing <br />
on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Legs down!&quot; Martha said. <br />
<br />
Saba instantly obeyed, having felt Martha's wrath the one time she had dared defy the <br />
nanny's divine will. <br />
<br />
Mbili, Tatuli, and Nneili were tempted to teleport right on of the book case but instead just <br />
teleported in one of the corners. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Nane.&quot; Kevin said to Nane waving. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Kevin.&quot; Nane replied jumping down.<br />
<br />
Kaylee wondered, that girl could make friends so easily but could get them in trouble <br />
almost as easily. At least she knew not to do anything stupid on Kaylee proper!<br />
<br />
The six human children stared in shock. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're cool!&quot; Mark declared.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're all naked!&quot; Dennis yelped.<br />
<br />
&quot;So are all of them.&quot; Said Moja flatly. &quot;We're you're emergency transformation free ticket <br />
back to Big Bad Island free of charge, anyone who wants to go back to their families please <br />
go now the flight is leaving at once.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't you say? Most of your pride is already here.&quot; Kevin said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, this is our responsibility.&quot; Moja said calmly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I promise we'll come back after we've adverted a disaster.&quot; Tatuli promised. <br />
<br />
&quot;You are not indestructible like I am and my half-sisters cousins are. You shouldn't have <br />
to take risks.&quot; Alice said sternly. <br />
<br />
&quot;You gotta do,&quot; Sita began.<br />
<br />
Saba finished,  &quot;Whatcha gotta do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Everyone looked at Nane and Tano. Tano crossed her arms and the young lioness said, <br />
&quot;Don't even think about it, -normal- identical don't copy each other.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Normal is completely subjective a term. What if it was normal to be slug people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point.&quot; Moja nodded, &quot;So the guys all wanna go to your families?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; All the kids said together. <br />
<br />
&quot;Then hold on tight. Mbili, Tatuli, Nneili you take the girls. Sita, Saba, Tano, you take the <br />
boys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who made her the boss of us anyway?&quot; Tano lamented as she took hold of Jose, &quot;Okay <br />
cutie, here we go! One-two-three!&quot; <br />
<br />
Nane made a dramatic bow and took three step a moment later. Moja though took a look <br />
at the glass statue, REALLY looked at it. Then she thought, 'Well... if that's your choice...'<br />
<br />
Moja bowed to Kaylee and Martha and said, &quot;Tell our dads we're still okay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will little Miss Moja.&quot; Martha nodded. <br />
<br />
Moja took three steps. <br />
<br />

<br />
Tired and burned out, the gem wolves, plus Caroline, Betty, Lawrence, Robyn, and Maxine <br />
had fallen asleep right right where they lay... it was just too tiring .. everything that had <br />
happened, that could happen, it had finally caught up with them. <br />
<br />
The parable was slightly different in each one of their minds, for no two people are the <br />
same (save the triplets, irony). But the underlying truth remained, and each knew, this was <br />
their own mind, not some by product of the game or the island. <br />
<br />
We shall focus on Caroline's inner mind world. <br />
<br />
Caroline stood before a wolf cup who looked much like her only a couple decades <br />
younger. Her hands and feet were encased in solid steel sawed off cones shapes, putting <br />
her small body into an 'X' shape. Around her neck was a chain connect to the top of the <br />
ceiling of the dark gray room.<br />
<br />
She looked at Caroline, scared, hurt, lonely, like a tortured animal. <br />
<br />
Her voice was passive, and defeatist, &quot;You grew up fast sis.... I don't... I don't I would have <br />
minded growing up... it's another path to explore after all but... I thought we'd have done <br />
it together.&quot; <br />
<br />
She looked so .. so... SO LONELY...She reminded Caroline of the child in 'Those Who Walk <br />
Away from Omelas.' <br />
<br />
'And anthrax can look like baby powder.' Caroline thought for a moment, But this, <br />
Caroline -knew- there was nothing evil or dangerous about Cobalt, because she was her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why am I locked up?&quot; Cobalt asked innocent, not understanding. <br />
<br />
Caroline thought, thinking of a million reasons, but strangely, all of them fell flat when <br />
faced with the practical application of those reasons.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can you let me out then sis?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I thought we were sisters, twins.&quot;<br />
<br />
That was like a knife through the gut. &quot;Cobalt.... I don't want to see you hurt... but I'm <br />
scared that if you just do what you want... you'll hurt someone... and not even realize it...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So I'm bad?&quot; Cobalt asked, she blinked away tears as any child would in her situation. <br />
<br />
Caroline was at a complete and total loss on how to answer that! It was KURSE who had <br />
been evil! The twins at the end had been doing precisely what ANY of the pack would have <br />
done, protecting their -home.- And had any of them been even remotely different before <br />
the cascade struck them all? <br />
<br />
&quot;Cobalt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt gasped, and blinked away tears, figuring she was now dead, and her sister was <br />
going to change her into a paper weight. And knew there was no escape. &quot;Transform.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Become a little girl, who can understand the bad things Kurse did, and the bad things she <br />
did to innocent people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cobalt gasped again, and in her child hood terms, saw the wicked witch of the west turn <br />
countless people into frogs, an entire ocean of miserable frogs. <br />
<br />
Also, the shackles and heavy weights all shattered. Cobalt fell to the ground, sobbing. <br />
<br />
Caroline knew it was perhaps narcissism at it's worst, but she knelt down and hugged her.  <br />
That was when everything went white. <br />
<br />
Caroline/Cobalt awoke right where the seventeen pack members had all gone to sleep. She <br />
looked at herself and gasped. She looked at Opal and realized the same thing had <br />
happened to him.  She felt her throat at hearing her different sounding voice. <br />
<br />
She was a teenager. <br />
<br />
She looked around, seeing the same thing had happened to nearly everyone, all being <br />
around, or maybe a year or two younger than Ulysses' age. <br />
<br />
Caroline/Cobalt shook her head. &quot;I guess this is how we split the difference... the old <br />
Caroline ceased to exist when Kurse split her, we both changed in the short time we were <br />
apart... we couldn't become the same whole... I understand now...&quot;<br />
<br />
She saw that the vast majority were now teenagers like Ulysses..Amethyst was the only <br />
one who didn't seem changed outwardly.  Caroline also realized some were child twins <br />
again... only now flesh and blood with no flower birthmark (and unlike the triplets had <br />
independent emotions and thoughts)... but she understood.. these were the ones who had <br />
become too unique in their minds to be safely fused back into one person. <br />
<br />
The tall Amethyst awkwardly stood, she blinked several times, looked down and nudged <br />
her own F sized woman hood. Her face brightened and she giggled, then she burst out <br />
laughing and started doing cart wheels and began singing 'Do you hear the people Sing?' <br />
from Les Miserable. <br />
<br />
&quot;And before you say anything kiddo!&quot; Amethyst grinned, &quot;Louisiana Purchase 1803! Let the <br />
rest of the world worry! Let everyone else get weight down by insecurities and worries! I'm <br />
free! Free! Ha ah!&quot; <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
The two women who had been the two other 'muses' for the statue Kaylee and Jensen had <br />
become pushed their way to the front of the crowd, stepping around Dennis' mother and <br />
approached Sasha directly. <br />
<br />
The taller one had tan skin, dark brown almost black hair (with a bust that -almost- <br />
rivaled the twins), the other one was only slightly tan with decidedly black roots but was <br />
dyed blue (who was almost a flat chester in spite of clearly being an adult woman). The <br />
taller one pulled the shorter one along and gesture to herself and her companion showing <br />
none of the fear the others did. <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Sunny, and this is Luna.&quot; <br />
<br />
Luna put her hands together, &quot;We talked about it and well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sunny took a step foreword, &quot;We want to be part of your pack!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha didn't believe this, &quot;WHAT?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna put her hands up defensively, &quot;Look, we booked passage on this cruise hoping to <br />
become trophy wives and of someone rich and good looking... &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we known through the linked mind we had for a bit with Jensen and Kaylee, yes we <br />
know who they are, that he's taken four times over already and you kinda have a quota for <br />
this sort of things. But we wanna join! We kinda know it's spur of the moment, but so was <br />
our entire scheme, and since we saw inside your big guy's head, we know he's kinda  a <br />
nice guy. How many other rich guys can you say that about with one hundred percent <br />
certainty? We have only a few funds to offer your commune, but I have a degree in fine art, <br />
and Luna has one in acting. If you want us, we're yours!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha asked, &quot;Do you realize what you're asking?&quot;<br />
<br />
All the other passengers thought they two were crazy. <br />
<br />
Sunny declared, &quot;We were inside your boss' head! We know precise what we're going for! A <br />
big bad wolf whose no longer so bad who was a spoiled selfish brat until some time last <br />
week! You're a nudist commune and have an incredibly altruist mentally for your own kind. <br />
You're also relatively well off. We want in.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then Luna used the most powerful word in the english language. &quot;Please?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha sighed, this was their choice, it wasn't like they were hurting anyone by it, it wasn't <br />
like they were hurting someone who didn't have a say in the matter. <br />
<br />
&quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Transform!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Become part of the pack, our pack, the big bad wolf pack, love and be loyal to both <br />
Master Jensen and your packmates and the pack itself and each other. Comprehend <br />
everything you do, have done, and shall do, and that of your pack mates, with perfect <br />
objectivity.&quot;<br />
<br />
 All the other passengers took a step back in total and utter alarm. <br />
<br />
Both women grew in height as muscle mass appeared while remaining lithe, and relatively <br />
petit compared to the rest of the pack. The claws and digitgrated feet grew, as her heads <br />
became those of wolves save for a more word forming throat and eyes with sapience. The <br />
tails came in the same time as the fur. Not unexpectedly, Luna's body took on the same <br />
fur pattern as Ashley and Millie, her torso light gray, while her fur light blue, with a <br />
crescent moon with two small stars birth mark formed on her left hip, her hair formed into <br />
a pony tale. Sunny's fur took on golden brown and sunflower yellower pattern (brown on <br />
body, yellow highlights) with a stylized sun birthmark on her right shoulder. Their busts <br />
grow or shrank until they were equal size.<br />
<br />
The first thing Sunny said was, &quot;WHAO! I was a really gold digging beotch wasn't I?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Only slightly Sunny, only slightly,&quot; Luna nodded with a smile. <br />
<br />
&quot;... You only stayed with me to keep me on the straight and narrow didn't you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're my best friend... what did you expect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sasha only stared as the two new wolves hugged each other, the passengers slightly <br />
mollified and quite weirded-out by the bit of drama. <br />
<br />
They then stood side by side, smiling, and, said together, <br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Now! Who do we serve? Who do we obey? Who do we -love-?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Sasha startled, realizing they must have read this from Kaylee's mind too. <br />
<br />
&quot;We serve the pack! We obey our Alphas! We love Master Jensen The Big Bad Wolf!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What is our purpose in life and creeds-!? ... To service and please Master in all things, to <br />
protect Master and the pack from all that would threaten us and him! To insure the estate <br />
remains a safe haven for the pack forever and always! To dream of a Glendale where all <br />
wear wolf ears even if it remains but a dream! And to never ever form labor unions!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right turn!&quot;  &quot;About face!&quot; &quot;Left turn!&quot; &quot;About face!&quot;  &quot;And Bow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do all your new recruits do that?&quot; Mary had to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; Ulysses confessed. <br />
<br />
Feeling very awkward Sasha said, &quot;Welcome... to the pack.&quot; <br />
<br />
Two new names engraved themselves on a room plaque at the Pack Estate. <br />
<br />
+++++++<br />
<br />
Jenny started. &quot;The shadows.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart turned to his sister. &quot;What the heck happened to the shadows?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are the shadows? It wasn't the brainwashing of a Transform but the power of a <br />
Dare that altered them! And that wasn't done on the island, it was done long before the <br />
curse began to become self aware, and personally I think we've used up our 'ex machinas' <br />
for today!&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart also realized, &quot;And Jack and Marcine...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jenny followed his train of thought, &quot;They were transformed to attract the deer herd and <br />
basically create the super stock needed for healthy plentiful deer that could feed the pack. <br />
Does that mean Jack and Marcine were now always deer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Bart raised the stakes, &quot;And then there's the gargoyles! Where they now 'always' living <br />
stone, animated statues, or whatever? Or do they still have families' whose the memories <br />
of the transformed human's existence of was stolen from their families?&quot; <br />
<br />
The two eldest children of Jensen realized they had some record searching to do besides <br />
their still transforming memories. <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
&quot;Yep it's all there still girlfriend.&quot; Nicole teased (her arm in a cast where it had been <br />
broken in three places and had pierced skin, and Nicole also using a crutch) looking at <br />
Millie's rear, &quot;Sorry girl, looks like ya'all stuck with that widdle heart on yer butt!&quot; <br />
<br />
Millie sighed, so much for that hope. She, nor anyone else noticed when her age reverted <br />
to where she was now around the teenage year that Maxine and Robyn were now. They <br />
were three of a kind after all... Not that in Millie's opinion Maxine had matured in those <br />
years (gotten more clever maybe...). <br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Glass, or rather now Maria was still a blond she wolf identical in appearance to Samantha, <br />
and with her black dress with red trim. But the look of utter insanity was completely gone.  <br />
She entered the sea side's reflective surface, and came out the other side near the <br />
passengers. The gargoyles still playing security around the island for now. <br />
<br />
&quot;MOTHER!&quot; She shouted. <br />
<br />
Eliza turned, not knowing how she knew but she knew. <br />
<br />
&quot;Martin... Martin my little boy?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;... I'm sorry mama...&quot; She said, not sure how to break her new name. <br />
<br />
&quot;What did that horrible horrible wick DO TO YOU?&quot; Eliza ran and embraced the glass child, <br />
not screaming, not running, not denying, only holding her child crying for her. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's your folks... go on...&quot; Nane said gesture to the crowd behind the rocks. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure we should?&quot; Dennis ask suddenly nervous seeing the wolf women and lion <br />
girl...<br />
<br />
Sita and Sabe looked at each other, gave a thumb's up, then pushed Dennis foreword, <br />
making him trip and fall into the sand. <br />
<br />
The two boys who had been still on the island turned and gasped, the eight cubs beating <br />
a hasty retreat as the attention came the returned kids. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, the parents were very very overjoyed paranoid having no place here after <br />
all they had endured. <br />
<br />
&quot;So they won't turn into statue guardians now?&quot; Tatuli asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope.&quot; Moja replied, &quot;That future's been adverted... They'll get back on the ship and <br />
that'll be that... &quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;How about we all get some sleep now?&quot; Tano yawned rubbing her eyes. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's the best idea you've given all day.&quot; Nneili nodded. <br />
<br />
(Back to you people.)</p>
