<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Here goes nothing I suppose...” Dave growled and took a deep breath before pressing the mask to his face. <br />
<br />
It felt extremely dark and cold at first until he felt the mask melting against his skin. He panicked and pulled at it, but quickly found the mask would not come off. A strange display started to form over his eyes, almost like a computer a screen. <br />
<br />
“Relax user. This is all perfectly normal. You may be freaking out for your first time. This is all temporary and you will revert once your Active Hours are completed.” A soothing, androgynous voice explained while tendrils of some white, rubbery substance leaked out from the mask and down his neck.<br />
<br />
“Easy for you to say.” Dave mumbled into the mask while he felt the pale white gooey tendrils drip down his chin and neck.  He could feel them working their way down across his chest, making every inch of his skin that was touched tingle with pleasure. Dave moaned. “W-why does it feel so good?”<br />
<br />
The substance move up and over his head. He swore he could feel his face pushing out into the mask, forming a cute, blunt rat muzzle with a pair of oversized incisors while the goo ran over his ears. Dave could feel them reforming on the top of his head where they became large and round. He wasn’t sure if they were his real ears or just ear-shaped rubber. Everywhere the rubber touched he could feel as if it was his own flesh. With every twine of the tendrils, pleasure coursed through his body, making him moan in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Dave was an older man, nearing 40 years old, and was hairy and flabby and wrinkled when he first put on the mask. But as the rubber crawled over him, squeezing him, molding him, his jiggly body began to firm up. His pecs swelled and broadened, abs defining themselves, arms and legs quickly following suit. Though ‘muscle’ was probably not the right word, as they were clearly molded from the very rubber his body was being converted into.<br />
<br />
Inside the suit that was forming, Dave could feel himself growing stronger, as though he were rippling with muscle. It was very confusing, as he couldn’t actually tell where his body stopped and the suit began. He was beginning to feel that perhaps they were the same body. After all, he could feel the mask’s nose twitch cutely, ears swiveling like a proper rat’s should.<br />
<br />
He was growing more and more aroused the longer the transformation went on. With one hand that was morphing into a sharply clawed paw, he gripped his rock hard cock. He didn’t even notice the hypnotic patterns forming on the inside of the visor or the fact that he was relaxing and wanting more. To serve. To obey. To pleasure. Dave blinked, wondering where those thoughts had come from, but opening his eyes only subjected him to the hypnotic array inside the visor. The soon-to-be drone began to stroke in tandem with the message.<br />
<br />
“Fuck!” Dave squeaked, voice rising an octave as the rubber cooly slid up his balls and began to squeeze them smaller. “This feels so good!”<br />
<br />
The rubber crept up his shaft and Dave moaned. It felt like hunderd of tiny hands were massaging him the entire time. He kept stroking, tugging his increasingly rubberized shaft, and whined as it began to shrink away in his cute little paws. His cock and balls pulled back into his body, leaving only a smooth, sexless bulge. A glowing lock symbol appeared on it. Unfortunately, while he might not be able to reach it, his insides were massaging him, keeping him in an aroused, blissed-out state. It heightened suggestibility, like the kind of hypnotic orders the visor was subjecting him to.<br />
<br />
He shuddered as he felt the rubber substance trickle down his tain and down his inner thighs. As it spread in between his ass cheeks, he shivered and moaned, feeling it circle his entrance like water circling a drain. The soft, gentle pressure the rubbery substance exerted was so nice against his pucker, he felt himself relax-<br />
<br />
“Ngh!” Dave gasped as the cool rubber entered his hole.<br />
<br />
It went inside him for a couple of inches and then began to grow and harden, forming into a buttplug. The plug itself developed an opening with a slick inner lining. It began to widen him out, massaging and squeezing his anal ring.<br />
<br />
Dave let out a strangled cry as his ass was firmly massaged into absolute looseness, the pressure on his prostate alone giving him an anal orgasm. He reached back to try to stop whatever the buttplug was doing but brushed along only smooth rubber where his asshole had once been. His legs splayed and kicked as the deep-tissue massage relentlessly assaulted him, his mouth open in long moan. After a few more dry orgasms, the suit decided that he was loose enough.<br />
<br />
All the while the suit slowly teased and taunted his cock. His hips jerked and bucked, hands sliding over the smooth bulge-actually smoothing it over even more, until not even a bump remained. The drone moaned in frustration. Then the suit began to squeeze it tightly. The pressure was full-body, and Dave felt a sensation of extreme vertigo. It put a paw against the wall to steady itself and felt the wall slide up beneath its paw.<br />
<br />
It was shrinking! Dave didn’t have time to panic as the hypnotic assault on its senses increased in intensity. The rat drone wobbled and fell onto its couch. A static noise was growing louder in its ears. The sound grew louder and louder, shutting out any thoughts. As the transformation began to finish, a long, worm-like tail squirmed its way out from the top of the little rat drone’s bubble-butt. The final addition to his body was the words <b>DRONE4U</b> forming in dark letters on his back while a barcode on his left pec formed with letters <b>D4V3</b>.<br />
<br />
The 5’4 pearlescent white rat drone stood completely and inhumanly still, mind blank, receiving instructions and orders. A progress bar slowly increased to 100 as the drone downloaded a new personality, quietly compressing and storing away the old one. After that, it went into standby mode. <br />
<br />
D4V3 waited passively for a few minutes until the phone buzzed. It reached down and answered it. The screen display said <I>job request</i>, and when its strangely rubbery finger tapped the screen, a set of instructions were downloaded into its mind.<br />
<br />
The twinkish rat drone turned and left its apartment. It shut the door, locked it, then walked down the stairs and out of the building. A few passersby gave him strange looks, others avoided him altogether. D4V3 did not care. It was a drone with a duty to fulfill. <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-===-=-=-=-=--=-=--=-=-=-==<br />
<br />
D4V3 walked several blocks and enter a subway system. It emerged on the outskirts of the city, the neighborhood where all the rich people lived in big old mansions. It walked several more blocks, never growing tired. Drones didn’t get tired, after all. <br />
<br />
After passing several multi-million dollar homes and a rather expensive-looking horse riding arena, it found itself at the gated entrance to a long, winding driveway. The rat drone hit the buzzer. A few seconds later, the gates creaked open and the rat walked up the driveway.<br />
<br />
The large brick Victorian mansion lay on the other side of a grassy hill, the view of the manse blocked completely from the road. D4V3 walked up to the wooden double doors and knocked. He waited. Eventually, the door opened.<br />
<br />
On the other side was a portly older gentleman with a well-groomed beard and moustache smoking a pipe, wearing a velvet smoking jacket and a silken thong. D4V3 inspected his newest client, detailing a surgical scar on the lower left of his hairy and bulbous abdomen and how surprisingly well-hung the man was. Definitely a top, considering the way the man’s eyes gleamed when the noticed the bubble-butt the rat bore.<br />
<br />
“Ah, yes. You must be D4V3. I’m Theodore Smithstone.” The older man had a rather deep voice, smoke-roughened and tinged with a classic Mid-Atlantic accent. “Please, come in, come in…”<br />
D4V3 registered the client, scanning him with his facial recognition software. That and his geolocation verified that he had, in fact, arrived and made contact with his client. A clock started ticking down in the corner of his hub from 8 hours. His visit properly verified, the drone stepped lightly into the manor.<br />
<br />
The main floor was a massive ballroom with a large crystal chandelier as the centerpiece, Twin grand staircases wound around the sides of the room up to a balcony on the second floor. Theodore stepped lightly to the room on the left. D4V3 followed him into a large living room with a huge TV hanging on the wall. Passing through there was an equally large dining room, set with expensive-looking silverware and china. Rooms leading off to the sides appeared to be bathroom and hallways into bedrooms. <br />
<br />
They wound up a staircase just up the kitchens, walking all the way up through the servant’s stairs to the third floor. Theodore’s face was red and covered in sweat. The older man produced a handkerchief and dabbed at himself, taking a breather on the landing.  D4V3 waited patiently for any commands. It had a strange urge to help the portly man-probably a leftover from his meat life. However, it could really only do things if commanded, that was the company’s policy in order to not offend potential clients with unneeded assistance.<br />
<br />
Theodore led the way down a plushly carpeted hallway to the master bedroom. Throwing open the doors, the older man revealed massive floor-to-ceiling windows that gave a perfect view of the city. D4V3 would be impressed if he were human. However, he merely noted it as part of the room. There was a small office complete with desk and a large bed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, can you shut and lock the door please?” The older man said.<br />
<br />
D4V3 complied, shutting and locking the door, a jolt of pleasure at having performed a service buzzing in his groin. He stood at attention, the pearly white rat drone going inert. The portly gentleman inspected him, walking around the drone, touching him, running a finger over the lock symbol on his groin. He pinched D4V3’s buttcheek, searching the drone for any reaction.<br />
<br />
“So you’ll do anything that I request?” Theodore packed his pipe and lit it, taking a puff.<br />
<br />
“I perform anything within reason as defined in the End User Agreement.” D4V3 rattled off in a monotone voice.<br />
<br />
“Ech, that voice! Give me something male but a bit feminine. And, uh, fake emotion. Your flat intonation will not do.” Theodore said.<br />
<br />
“You wish this unit to act alive, sir?” D4V3 asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes. But still follow my commands.” <br />
<br />
The robot relaxed, chest moving up and down to simulate breathing. The mask appeared to be fake, and the drone’s skin shimmered and shifted into a onepiece jumpsuit. A bulge pressed out from its front as his cock and balls reappeared.<br />
<br />
“Does this please you, master?” <br />
<br />
“Yes. And call yourself David. Dave is so…informal.”<br />
<br />
“Yes sir.” David replied cheerily.<br />
<br />
“Then…fetch me a glass of Cognac on the rocks.” Theodore ordered.<br />
<br />
David did as ordered, walking over to the bar and pouring a glass. He handed it to the older man. He swirled it and sniffed it, then took a sip, smiling at David the whole time. David felt another pulse of pleasure in his groin. He eagerly awaited his next order.<br />
<br />
“Excellent job.” Theodore smiled. “I need to finish some paperwork. Why don’t you lick my feet while I do so, give them a proper massage?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, master.” David replied, FOOTSLAVE.EXE downloading automatically as the man made his request.<br />
<br />
The older man settled back into his office chair with a sigh. David found himself under the desk, the older man’s feet waving in front of him. The rat wrapped its hands around them, feeling them. They were hairy but soft, nails perfectly manicured and a healthy white color. It lifted one up and extended a tongue, drawing it up from the round slope of the heel, across the ball of the foot before coming to the toes, kissing each one.<br />
<br />
David heard a happy groan above it and kept licking. The rat’s programming told it that the older man would like them worshiped, so it acted accordingly. The heel lacked any callouses, fleshy and clean. The arch was perfectly shaped and the toes were like lusty little dogs wriggling on the end of the buffet that was Theodore’s feet. David wrapped its muzzle around the big toe and slurped and sucked on it like a cock, bobbing its head up and down. The drone moved on down the line, sucking toes individually before sucking them into his stretchy rubber mouth all at once. <br />
<br />
All the while, the drone’s hands stroked and massaged each foot as he worked on them. Theodore’s moans grew louder, the older man laying back in his seat. David took an entire foot into its flexible mouth and let its inner muscles massage it. The portly man rubbed his other into the drone’s face and nearly came right there in his chair.<br />
<br />
David bobbed on the foot suggestively, drawing another groan of pleasure from the old man. The rat started alternating feet, tongue lacing each toe while massaging the meat of the other foot. Its fingers pushed into the flesh, working it around in circles, rubbing and stroking as though the drone truly cared.<br />
<br />
“Unf! Stop, enough!” Theodore begged.<br />
<br />
The drone immediately ceased moving and waited. <br />
<br />
“There’s no way I can do paperwork with this.” The portly man gestured at his silk thong, where a wet spot spread across the material. “I wish I could just get undressed and have you relieve me….”<br />
<br />
David immediately began disrobing Theodore, undoing the knot on the front of his smoking jacket. <br />
<br />
“Wait, stop!” The old man gasped, eyes wide. “What are you doing?”<br />
<br />
David paused. “Master does not wish to get undressed and be relieved?”<br />
<br />
“Oh. Well…yes. But do it…sexy.” Theodore grinned, taking a toke on his pipe. <br />
<br />
The rat gently disrobed the older man, running his tiny claws through the generous gray chest hair on the older man’s body. He encircled the older man, letting robe fall, drawing him closer until the portly man’s gut rubbed against his smooth rubbery flesh. Theodore leaned in and kissed the mask, making the rat’s nose twitch involuntarily.<br />
<br />
“God, you’re cute. That was your host’s reaction?”<br />
<br />
“Unfortunate bodily autonomy-”<br />
<br />
“No, no. Let him…enjoy himself.” <br />
<br />
Dave was suddenly vaguely aware of the goings-on. He found a rather hot looking older bear in front of him, belly pressed to his-holy shit, he had abs! And he was small…and a bit of a twink, if he were being honest. Theodore watched the drone inspect itself and then turn to him. The older man grinned when he saw the rat’s cock rise to attention, claws tracing circles around his nipples.<br />
<br />
“Hello, David.” Theodore smiled.<br />
<br />
“Woof!” Dave replied.<br />
<br />
“Cute.” The older man slid his hands down Dave’s new body. “Suck me off?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, daddy-”<br />
<br />
“No. Call me master.” Theodore said firmly.<br />
<br />
“You don’t like being called D…” Dave blinked, suddenly incapable of even uttering the word. “Yes master.”<br />
<br />
“Good.” Theodore smiled and blew smoke into the drone’s mask and pointed at his cock. <br />
<br />
Dave was trying to figure out what was going on. Was this the client? Why had he reactivated in the middle of sex, shouldn’t it be a complete blank? But his response was automatic, the drone dropping to its knees in front of a rather stout dick. Pre dripped generously off the tip, and the drone felt himself involuntarily moving his head forward, mouth open, catching the stream and licking the head clean.<br />
<br />
Theodore moaned, and another jolt of pleasure rocked Dave’s mind. His mouth whirled and sucked as he engulfed the bear’s juicy cock in his muzzle. Vacuum pressure had Theodore’s toes curling  and uncurling, groaning happily. Dave bobbed and milked the portly man’s cock, muzzle pressed against his hairy fat-pad that surrounded his turgid member.<br />
<br />
Theodore pressed him firmly into his groin, revealing two more inches that had been trapped by accumulated fat. The cock entered the rat’s throat and his muscles began to whir and contract, sucking away the pre right out of the old man’s balls. His mouth stroked and glided along the shaft, his hands massaging the bear’s sack.<br />
<br />
“Oh my Lord!” Theodore groaned, thrusting in and out, using the drone like the sex toy he was.<br />
<br />
The rat continued tending to the cock in his mouth, nose twitching at the older man’s spicy musk. Dave would have dated the guy if he could, but rich dudes tended to just buy their boyfriends. An almost middle-aged flabby dude like him would never get a rich bear like Theodore. <br />
<br />
His tongue slid along the sides of the shaft, inner lining stroking and teasing along the length. Theodore gave a long, extended moan as he came, shoving the rat’s snout tightly against his crotch. Seed splattered the rat’s mouth. Theodore’s cock kept throbbing and twitching, burping out more and more cum as the drone’s throat sucked it right out of his dick. The portly bear shuddered and twitched in ecstasy.<br />
<br />
Finally, the orgasm came to an end. Dave found himself fading away, back into the drone’s mind. The drone automatically filed away the sexual encounter, noting the organic reactions and responses for future updates, sending it to the Drones4U, then deleted Dave’s memories for privacy reasons. David cleaned the cum from Theodore’s dick and stood, awaiting instruction.<br />
<br />
“Rub my shoulders and hug me while I do my work.” The older man asked, breathless.<br />
<br />
“Yes, master.”<br />
<br />
For the rest of their time, David and Theodore snuggled together while the bear did paperwork. It was rather dull, with little orders to please the drone, but the client appeared to be happy. Halfway through, the older man asked for another blowjob, and David easily imitated Dave’s techniques-improving on them, actually, as only a drone could.<br />
<br />
With five minutes left, David excused itself to the bathroom to clean itself. Protocol demanded no trace of the client remain inside him when the day was finished. Theodore could have pushed for him to stay up until the last minute, but did not. D4V3 washed itself off in the shower. <br />
<br />
With two minutes left, he stepped out of the shower and allowed his skin to absorb the moisture. While that was happening, he overheard the client having a conversation just outside the door. It listened, hoping to hear one last order it could fulfill.<br />
<br />
“Yes, hello? Drones4U? How much for the host?” The man waited for a response. “No, no, not the drone. The host! For how long? Permanently.” Pause. “Preferences? 18 years old, cute power-bottom twink foot-slave.” Pause. “$250 thousand? Sold.”<br />
<br />
The timer on its job ticked down the seconds. 30…29..28…It felt someone remotely access it, pulling up its compressed memory file. In a few keystrokes, 20 years of memories were deleted, vanishing from the now-lighter file…15…14…13…PWRBTMTWK.EXE was uploaded and began to overwrite his memories…4…3…2…OVERWRITE COMPLETE….1…<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br />
<br />
Rubber retreated back up into his mask as David resumed control of his body. The visor informed him that he had been given gratuity for his service. David checked the amount and his eyes widened.<br />
<br />
“2000 dollars in tips!” David cried, voice two octaves higher than it had been prior to dronification. “Amazing!”<br />
<br />
David grinned and pulled off the mask, looking around. He wasn’t in his apartment. Instead he found himself in an elegant bathroom, fixtures all marble and gold. looked up at himself in the mirror and froze. Something…was off about himself. Was it his thin, handsome features? The boyish smirk that lifted the edge of his luscious lips? Or the complete lack of wrinkles on his youthful face?<br />
<br />
Nah, he’d always been like this. Why would an 18 year old twink have wrinkles? He picked up the mask and the light white leotard that had come with it. Next to the leotard was the rat tail buttplug. Drones4U was a really cool roleplaying service, and it helped that he was really into the dom/sub scene. <br />
<br />
David flexed, the formerly dumpy and overweight man was now covered in tight, well-defined and compact muscles. No body hair marred his well-tanned skin. The little twink turned, staring at his tight, well-rounded ass. There was something different about him…he just couldn’t put his finger on what.<br />
<br />
The short young man went to retrieve his clothes and instead found a silk thong. Next to it was a note. He picked it up. It read: <I>Please, wear this from around the house. Feel free to sleep over tonight. I shall have you join me for breakfast on the morrow.-Jupiter</I>. Jupiter? An image flashed in his mind of an older man and his cock stiffened. David wobbled, feeling strangely dazed, and sat down on his bed.<br />
<br />
Something hard bumped his prostate. <br />
<br />
With a girly squeak of shock, he sat up and reached behind him, feeling around his backside. Something was lodged inside his rectum! He carefully tugged it out. A big translucent white buttplug popped free from his hole.<br />
<br />
David inspected it. On the bottom there was some writing. <b>[DRONES4U ANAL TRAINER PART #2324]</b>.  After the overly tight anal session he’d just gone through, he was happy DRONES4U had provided a training device. The twink relaxed and gently reinserted the buttplug, hitting the little button that made it vibrate.<br />
<br />
The cute young man leaned back and moaned as the dildo slowly loosened his ass. Man, if the old man wanted to pay him to stay overnight, he was fine with that. Rich people and their kinky roleplay sessions. His toes curled at the sensations the buttplug was giving him and closed his eyes, feeling totally relaxed. Normally he’d be thinking about muscular men while being pleasured. For some reason, his mind kept flashing back to the portly older gentleman he’d just serviced, licking his feet, massaging him, enjoying the warm splash of his semen on his tongue….<br />
<br />
He fell asleep as his anus was gently stretched and loosened as the buttplug-perfectly sized to mimic Theodore&#39;s stout cock-trained the muscles how to flex and service a cock properly. David&#39;s precum drooled onto his sofa while he slept. He dreamt of servicing his new master, the power bottom slave program he’d downloaded settling in. When he woke up, there would be a big mess for David to lick clean.</p>
