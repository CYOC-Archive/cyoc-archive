<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With still half an hour left for Jeff´s friends to arrive theoretically, Jeff finished Jared´s room, and looked over to his brother, waiting for a new task. His instinct was to run away, but something stopped him. Was he compelled to wait for Jared to dismiss him? He hoped not.<br />
Jared noticed Jeff stopped working a minute or two later. “Finished, dear brother? Okay, you can go, but be back in half an hour when your friends should be here. Open them the door, will you?” Jared ordered, and Jeff felt free to move again. But before he could leave, Jared suddenly jumped up and run outside the room, and Jeff heard the bathroom door close shut. <br />
Jeff waited a second longer, but couldn´t believe his luck. Jared had left him free (for now), and left his computer in a hurry, with nothing stopping Jeff from using the program to free himself. <br />
But he realized quickly that Jared had thought about keeping him out. Somehow, his hand stopped about a centimeter above the keyboard, unable to reach anything on it. The same was true for the mouse, he couldn´t touch it. Jeff darted over into his room, not running but walking fast, to see if he could touch his computer. There he had no issues, but he noted that the program was now missing from his computer. <br />
Jeff cursed loudly. First, Jared made him his slave, then he made their older brother into a baby, and now he had stolen the chronivac from his pc over to his own, and blocked his access to it. He felt doomed.<br />
Jared had just finished his business on the toilet when he heard Jeff curse from his room. As he heard about what he cursed, Jared grinned. He left the bathroom and walked over to his brother´s room, who was too distracted to notice him, still cursing. He tried to find a way to get the program back, but there was nothing.<br />
“I see you noticed I´m protected from you editing me or free yourself” Jared said after a minute or two. Jeff jumped in fright, not having noticed Jared had left the bathroom. “What had you wanted to do, Jeff? Answer honestly.”<br />
Jeff couldn´t stop himself from that order and answered: “I wanted to reverse your changes to me, and then punish you. We could have fun together, but not like this. You mad me your slave.”<br />
Jared´s grin turned a bit more evil. “I see, you don´t like the new outlook. Or is it just being naked? Either way, you will stay like this. And punishing me? What for? Using the power you left lying around? That´s your own fault. Maybe we will have fun together, but I will be giving the rules for that.” He laughed at Jeff´s face, who looked like he had just swallowed a lemon. “You think you are being a slave to me? Hmm… I like the idea of your thinking. But if you are my slave, you will address me as master, and won´t curse me. Now, I need to punish you for trying to punish me, right?”<br />
After looking around Jeff´s room, Jared decided: “Okay, I see you brought over both your old clothes as well as of our baby brother and his friend. While it is good to see them out of my room, it would be even better if they were out of the house. So, for your punishment, you will take a thrash bag or two, and collect all your clothes within them. Everything, from socks and underwear up to your winter clothes, jackets, and shoes. Put Jeremy´s and Chris´s clothes on top, and then plant them by the door to take out later. You will take too long to bring them to the recycling bank three streets away right now, and I want you here when the other´s arrive. But control all pockets, I don´t want you to throw away anything else. Understood, slave brother?” He even mocked him further.<br />
Jeff was horrified. What would he wear if he threw out all his clothes? Against his will he was forced to answer: “Yes, master Jared. I will do as you asked me to do.” He then moved out of his room, quickly getting a few trash bags from the kitchen, before starting to empty his wardrobe. He checked each little pocket, and threw anything inside onto his bed, before throwing the clothes into a bag. Jared watched as Jeff did so, grinning wide.<br />
After the wardrobe followed the smaller dresser, where he kept his underwear and socks. They just were tossed into a bag, as there were no pockets to check. He then left his room, quickly fishing out his dirty clothes from the laundry, throwing them into the sack with his underwear. After returning, he went to his mattress, becoming beet red in embarrassment, when he fished for his masturbation sock.<br />
When Jared saw the sock, he immediately stopped Jeff from throwing it out. “Wait, that sock can stay there. The poor soul that has too touch this when they check the clothing, no. We will find something else for that.”<br />
Jeff pushed the sock back under, before he threw the clothes on his bed, namely the ones he, Jeremy and Chris had worn, onto the bag at last. All the bags went to stand next to his door, and then Jeff stood before Jared. After a glance to the clock, Jared grinned. “Only a few minutes to wait now. Let´s go back over to my room to wait.” And with that said, they went back over.<br />
Three minutes later, exact two hours since Jared said it, the doorbell rang. Jeff was forced by his earlier command to go let them in. He greeted Todd with a high five of his right upper hand first, then did the same with Thomas, while at the same time using his left upper hand for another high five with Dean. Lastly, he shook hands with both Dennis (left) and Colin (right) on the lower hands, as they were a head smaller than him. To Mike, he only nodded in acknowledgement. Afterwards, he guided them up to Jared´s room, fearing what his brother would do with them.<br />
Jared greeted them all while examining them. Yeah, his ideas for each of them would be fitting. Not that any of them would complain about it afterwards. Or if they did, he wouldn´t know.</p>
