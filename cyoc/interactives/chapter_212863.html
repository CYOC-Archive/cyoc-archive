<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Wyatt shifted his gaze away from Elder Aaron&#39;s debasement and back to Chuck who had a cruel glint in his eye.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You said you&#39;d let me go.&quot; Elder Wyatt protested turning his head from side to side.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Well, no. I said I would undo the changes I had made to you.&quot; Chuck said, his perverted grin taking on an even more sinister angle.  &quot;I never said anything about not making more.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wyatt paled at the man&#39;s cruel trick but Aaron laughed lazily from the couch.  &quot;You sold me out for nothing dick for brains. You betrayed me and now here you are you Judas. You bastard.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aaron spat the words but he didn&#39;t move to get up.  He had resigned himself to his fate, to this house of horrors.  Now all he had to do was watch the show.  <br />
<br />
Chuck was surprised.  Aaron had gotten the hang of cursing a lot faster than he had expected. He gave the boy a nod of appreciation.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do to me?&quot; Wyatt said, his lip trembling again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing so barbaric as torturing you so quit moping.&quot; Chuck said.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt&#39;s face didn&#39;t change but Chuck continued on, typing as he spoke. <br />
<br />
&quot;Besides, you&#39;d already been perving on Aaron even before you knocked on my door.&quot; Chuck said.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt&#39;s eyes widened.  Of course, Chuck hadn&#39;t known if the boy had done any of the such before he had edited so that he had. However, Chuck had seen in the program that Wyatt had been bisexual when he had first come to the house.  Maybe if he had been compassionate and kind he would have let it all just pass but he was a dick with unlimited power so things went how they did. <br />
<br />
Wyatt remembered sneaking into where Aaron kept his dirty clothes and taking a few whiffs when he knew Aaron wasn&#39;t watching. Getting off on the masculine presence of his missionary partner.  Maybe this had happened,  maybe it hadn&#39;t. Chuck was writing his story now.  <br />
<br />
Aaron stood up from his place on the couch, standing in front of Wyatt with cum still soaking in his now furry body. &quot;Is this what you wanted you pervy little creep, to see me jerk it for you?&quot; Aaron said with a hint of anger and a hint of arousal in his voice, his cock beginning to stir again.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Aaron, calm down and take a seat.&quot; Chuck said, authority filling his voice.  He was in control.  <br />
<br />
Aaron went back to reclining on the couch.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Wyatt, you sold your friend out because of the promise of a wicked man. What would your friends, what would your church think of you?&quot; Chuck said twisting the knife.  You didn&#39;t like your tattoos so let&#39;s give you perfect skin.&quot; He tapped and typed away.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt watched as skin took on a nice dewy tone, his body hair vanishing completely, a scar on one of his knees from when he was a kid disappearing into nothing.  <br />
<br />
&quot;You didn&#39;t find your piercings attractive so let&#39;s make you more conventionally attractive.&quot; Chuck said smiling.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt watched as his hips widened giving him an hour glass figure, his reddish-blonde hair becoming slightly longer than shoulder length and his lips becoming fuller.  When that was done, his face was enhanced with blush, his eyes colored with eyeshadow and his lashes lengthened.  <br />
<br />
When that was done, Wyatt stood there staring at himself.  Except for his cock and the makeup, he looked like one of his older sisters.  <br />
<br />
He gasped when the weight appeared on his chest.  If he had been in control of his body, he would have toppled over under the weight of the breasts that had ballooned out of his flat chest.  They looked like the fake breast&#39;s his mother had scoffed at when she watched her soap operas.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Nice tits bro!&quot; Aaron said from the couch. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t make me a freak.&quot; Wyatt protested. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wyatt, come on, you know you like then new you.&quot; Chuck clicked enter and Wyatt&#39;s four inches spring to hardness. <br />
<br />
&quot;See, said Chuck, giving in to his desire to explain the punishment he was offering, &quot;By giving up your friend over there, you supplied my house with something it needed, a footman.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aaron waved the toes of his left foot showing their dexterity.<br />
<br />
&quot;What I need now, is a maid.&quot; With that, a black latex maid&#39;s costume appeared on Wyatt&#39;s body starting just low enough that the areolas on his ample breasts were peaking out the top and high enough that the tip of Wyatt&#39;s tiny cock was still visible.  Tall heels appeared on his feet, raising him up just a bit higher.  <br />
<br />
Aaron cackled.  If Wyatt thought tattoos and piercings he could cover up were bad, he bet he hated what he was up to now.  <br />
<br />
Chuck clicked a couple of more buttons and something seemed to open in Wyatt&#39;s ass. The always ready, lubricating hole that Wyatt had been equipped with needed no explanation. <br />
<br />
&quot;Now, if you&#39;ll act right, I&#39;ll let you have control of your body back.&quot; Chuck said with a grin.  <br />
<br />
Wyatt just nodded.  Once more crying but his makeup staying perfectly applied.  <br />
<br />
Chuck hit enter and Wyatt lurched forward, not to runaway, but to grab his cock.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Not so fast!&quot; Chuck said, &quot;Good boys don&#39;t touch themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chuck&#39;s hands stopped mere inches from his dick, unable to make contact with the tiny appendage. He tried to reach around to his ass, feeling the new sensation of need there but his hands stopped before making contact.  Wyatt struggled, alternating from grasping from front to back but not finding any purchase whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
&quot;If you&#39;re going to cum in this house, you&#39;re going to have to get Aaron&#39;s help.&quot; Chuck said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Fat chance!&quot; Aaron said.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, Aaron, I bet you can show Wyatt just what he helped create.&quot; Chuck clicked a button and saw Aaron leap back to hardness.  The monkyish man grabbed Wyatt and pulled him to the ground. <br />
<br />
Placing his long brown cock between the tits of his former brother in ministry, Aaron humped toward Wyatt&#39;s mouth.  Wyatt tried to scream tried to move his face from the smegma and cum covered member but he couldn&#39;t.  Aaron had his arms pinned down with his hands and was holding his legs with his large feet.<br />
<br />
Chuck stayed in his chair watching the bright pink cheeks of Aaron&#39;s ass pumping with those words, &quot;GO APESHIT!&quot; as he facefucked his former friend.</p>
