<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alix decided to become a temporary familiar in order to get a body of her own design. However, that was before she met Felka&#39;s master, aka, her own Mother. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, so you claim this.... thing... rescued you. And is claiming that it is not a bad harpi? And you promised it that I would waste my time building a custom biodoll for it as a reward? And for what, it becomes my familar? Am I getting that correct Felka?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um... yeah. That is correct. Everything is thr truth too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god, you are such a dumbass child.&quot; Felka&#39;s Mother quietly whispered to herself, although Alix still heard it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You there, harpi. Come.&quot; Demanded Felka&#39;s Mother, while pointing to a spot right in front of her. Alix hops off of Felka&#39;s shoulders gently so as to not scratch her with her talons, and flutters down to the indicated spot.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me make 1 thing very clear first. I owe you nothing. My daughter is the one at fault, and her promises do not mean I must also honor them. So I won&#39;t be making you a biodoll. However, seeing as you already were open to becoming my familar, I will accept that part. You should feel honored that you get to have me as your Mistress.&quot; A light shown out of the woman&#39;s hand which she had raised above Alix&#39;s head. All of a sudden Alix felt like her body had become heavy, as black runes began etching themselves in the air  around her neck, forming a band of runes. Once the band had turned solid black from the amount of runes, it shrunk down rapidly, while conforming to Alix&#39;s neck&#39;s shape, and finally disappearing. &quot;There, now lets see what we got here. Hmm, average stat line, boring known magics, possession, while it may have been good if an adventurer had, it is useless on a familar since their soul is bound to the body their contractor chooses for them to inhabit, and only can be moved by their contractor, shitty equipment, Alix? Nope, so she will be needing a new name too.&quot; She muttered to herself. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, you new name is Embry, you are my familiar now understand.&quot; Stated Felka&#39;s Mother. Embry suddenly felt herself suddenly become inarguably compelled to answer her &quot;Yes Mistress.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good, now then. Felka, stop making that face and show Embry to the coup, she will be one of our egg layers for now until I have a better use for her.&quot; Felka just stood there unable to comprehend what just had happened. She had just unintentionally doomed her own savior to a life of unrequited servitude to her Mother, all because her Mother&#39;s pride couldn&#39;t handle someone else helping her. &quot;How could you do such a cruel thing!&quot; She eventually was able to shout. <br />
<br />
&quot;Cruel? What did I do that was cruel? I just granted Embry&#39;s wish to become my familiar. It should be obvious that once they are my familiar I can use them however I wish you know.&quot; Felka&#39;s Mother said casually.<br />
<br />
&quot;She didn&#39;t want to be your familiar in the first place. She wanted a body. And would have agreeded to become your familiar until it was finished. It was a deal not a request!&quot; Explained Felka, who was now crying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aww, sweetie, even if I accepted the deal, it would have been the same result<br />
 This way, at least she doesn&#39;t have to suffer by clinging on some futile hope that I would keep my end of the deal. Honestly how many times have I told you that I only do what is right by me, and so should you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then, I am so sorry Alix. It seems like you saved me for nothing. I hope we can meet again sometime.&quot; Felka said as all the color faded from her face. This caused her Mother to immediately begin to freak out. &quot;Felka! What are you doing! Stop it! Felka don&#39;t  do this. You know what will happen if you don&#39;t stop it right now! Felka please! If you set back time you will be effected far worse. How long are you going back! Felka stop it now!&quot; Shouted her mother. &quot;I can last for another 2 minute like this, after which, I will go back 2 days real time, or 20 years for me, meaning my existance ends, and Alix is freed. Do you understand me now Mother? Am I getting the message through? You lose either way. However one way has me still in it. Your call. 90 seconds left.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hold on sweetie we can talk about this. Just cancel the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not happening. Contract with yourself swearing to uphold the deal, 1 custom biodoll, to her exact specifications, in under 1 year while she is now my familiar, or simply let her go. 40 seconds by the way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We can talk this through, it doesnt have to be like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;30&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, okay, okay, I swear upon my self I wi honor my promise to make a custom biodoll to her specifications, for her while she is your familiar for a year, and let her go free afterwards. Okay! Now cancle the magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sign it! 10, 9&quot;<br />
<br />
Felka&#39;s mother cuts a shallow scratch into her stomach, causing small a trickle of blood to drip down, in which she presses her hand, making a hand print. The moment that happens, Felka&#39;s magic is cancled. &quot;Damn you. Why would you risk ending your own life just to free the Harpy? Are you an idiot?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;She did the same for me before, and she didn&#39;t even know me then. If not for her, I would still have been dead anyways. Don&#39;t you dare forget your oath either.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand about the oath, but never do sonething like this again. You are the only important thing to me, understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then that makes me perfect collateral to wager against your oath as insurance.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I won&#39;t go back on it. Just don&#39;t do something like that ever again. Embry come here. I transfer your contract over to Felka for 1 year, after which your contract with the both of us will become annulled in its entirnety. And I am sorry for my misunderstanding, as well as thank you for saving my daughter, if you truly meant only just that. So I will trust you to continue keeping watch over her for now until the contract ends. And I will do my best to make your new body. If you could help me out here and there I would appreciate the assistance. If you can speak our language without the contract forcing you to say certain words, please do so I know you can understand us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand, and while I think you are both scary and crazy I will still watch over Felka. But before that, I need help. How do I lay eggs? My stomach really hurts from being over filled with them. Owww, it hurts so badly. Felka, or even Mistress please, tell me how harpies lay eggs?&quot;</p>
