<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The drive back was awkward. Brady and Luke were in the back. Luke had tried to convince Katie that she needed to go to a hospital while Hailee drove. Unfortunately, this was met with the most stubborn denial they had ever seen from Katie. When Hailee parked the car in the driveway Katie just stormed out. While they were all rockers the purple-haired girl was usually the glue that kept their band together. Now however she was acting differently on top of the obvious change.  <br />
<br />
The group walked into the house they rented and began discussing what to do. &quot;okay I still say we need to take her to a hospital&quot; Luke said. With Katie storming off they had to put their equipment away without her. &quot;dude think about it. Even if we get her to agree to go to a doctor what are they going to do?&quot; Brady practically yelled that last part. Hailee then moved between them and put her hands out. &quot;listen to me!&quot; she shouted. &quot;look we said she was just wearing a horse outfit as a prank so the audience won&#39;t report this. We need to calm down and figure out a plan&quot;. Hailee was the smartest so it made sense she would think of that.  <br />
<br />
Unbeknownst to them a figure in a dark grey hoodie and jeans was across the road hidden in the shadows. Their face was obscured by a white comedy mask. &quot;now the world will see these &#39;rock stars&#39; as they truly are, nothing but a bunch of FREAKS&quot; Their voice was distorted by some device within the mask. They had gotten the code for the message deep within the dark web. Only someone like them could decode the algorithm to allow them to use it. Unsure if it worked they tested it on just one of the band members. To his joy, the drummer now had a stallion&#39;s legs and cock. Even better Katie believed that she had always had it. However, the masked person wanted them to know. There was no way to alter the code to allow it. So instead they had to get creative. Now that the others had planted the seed of doubt the masked person could send the message to each of them.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Katie had locked herself in her room so the rest of the band had no choice but to leave her alone. Brady was busy in the dining room trying to find information on what happened. So far he only found rumors. He then heard a message pop up on his phone. Hoping it was Katie he picked it up. After reading it he walked straight to his room and locked the door.  <br />
<br />
Hailee noticed this and figured he had just gotten frustrated. She hadn&#39;t found anything and was scrolling through news feeds when she got a message. Her pupils widened as she took in each word. Luke meanwhile had just gotten out of the shower. He hoped it would help clear his head. As he was gelling his hair back up he saw a message ping on his phone. Figuring it was his buddies trying to say they found something he opened the app and read the message.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Katie was sitting on her bed. How dare her friends say she was different. Since they met the four of them had been inseparable. Brady had decided since each of them liked rock they should start a band. She remembered hooking up with so many girls afterward and having them lick her equine member. Now they are saying she was wearing a costume? She had no idea what their problem was, as Katie was thinking her eyes lined up with a photo taped to the back of the door. Confused she got up and walked over. She plucked the photo off the door and looked at it. It showed the four of them after their first concert. They were each standing next to each other and nothing was covering Katie&#39;s lower half. So why did it show her with a pair of human legs attached to a feminine waist? Her eyes then went to a drawer next to her bed. Since she never wore clothes she should have her sex toys in it instead. She pulled the drawers open and was shocked. Neatly folded pants, skirts, shorts, and panties were where she thought her sex toys were. She grabbed her phone frantically and looked at her photos. All her pictures showed her with the same pair of legs in different clothes. &quot;how?&quot; she asked. She looked down at her equine legs. She should have proof she always had them right. Yet there wasn&#39;t a shred of evidence to support this. Then she remembered the odd pile of clothing by her drum set and everyone&#39;s shocked expressions. &#39;could they be right?&#39; she thought. She unlocked her door and ran into the hall. &quot;guys? Where is everyone&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Katie heard movement inside Brady&#39;s room. Bursting in Katie began to explain herself. &quot;Brady, sorry for bar... WHAT THE HECK!!!&quot; Katie gave out a cry making Brady cover his ears. Katie couldn&#39;t believe this was Brady. He had two black horns that curved upwards. Both of them had their points over a foot higher than his head. His face was a bovine muzzle with human ears, eyes, and eyebrows. He kept his long hair thankfully. White fur covered his new face, most of his arms and torso. On his neck black fur dripped down into a v between his pecs. His forearms and hands also had this fur on them. His fingertips were replaced by hoofs. His upper body was more muscular than before which looked a little out of place with his lower human half. He wore only a pair of shorts and socks. &quot;jeez Katie! Don&#39;t scream like that&quot; Brady didn&#39;t even seem aware he had changed. When Katie asked it was revealed he remembered he always was this way. Katie brought up the photo in her hand and his muzzle opened up. &quot;wait if you&#39;ve been hit and so have I then...&quot; Both of their eyes widened as they called out for their band mates.  <br />
<br />
Both then found what they assumed to be Hailee. The clothes she had just worn were strewn about the living room but the figure in front of them wasn&#39;t human. The grey wolf man was busy grinding his cock on the couch. The area was covered in his cum. he was decently muscled at 6&#39;5 and covered in grey fur. Lighter fur was on his front and muzzle. Black fur covered his forearms and hands while white fur covered his fingers. His tail had black near its base and white near its tip with a line of blue fur down the top of it. His ears poked through his now wild blue hairline. His inner ears were blue as well. Even his tongue was blue as he licked an imaginary object before him. It was only when Katie touched him that he was snapped out of his trance. &quot;whoa, where&#39;d the pretty kitty go?&quot; the wolf asked. He now noticed he was in their living room and not a girl&#39;s bedroom. After some time talking the three found out he was called Hal and to his knowledge had been born an anthro wolf. It took a while for him to realize his memories had been altered. The final nail was that all the boy-filled magazines in his room were mixed with feminine items. He was horrified to be told he and Brady had shared a kiss the night before. To Brady&#39;s despair, he said that he was going to be sick and needed to use the bathroom.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, he encountered Luke in his new form. To their shock, Luke was now only four feet tall with a chicken head replacing his old one. He lacked all his body hair and had chicken feet for legs. The strangest of all was what happened to his cock. His penis and balls were huge. The dark pink head was spewing out more than sperm too. Every couple of seconds the shaft would bulge as something came up and through the hole. An egg then landed intact on the ground. To their horror, they found out Luke had lost his speech and any means of writing as he kept his hands folded like a chicken whenever he wasn&#39;t using them to clean. His personality had changed as he acted like a servant mixed with a pet. Even showing him the picture only made him cock his head in confusion. he then got up and began cleaning the house. Even after his friends asked him to stop he still did an invisible list of chores like cleaning Hal&#39;s mess and making dinner. He even used his eggs as ingredients for the dessert. Brady looked at the other two and then raised his phone to his ear. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The masked man hid when cops, E.M.T.s, and even the government came to the house. They snuck away after seeing the group being led into a truck. The figure chuckled once he was far enough away. The band&#39;s lives were ruined forever. Every time Brady would try to sing he would let out a bellow instead. Not to mention making Hailee a straight-wolf man ruined their relationship. However Luke was the icing on the cake. The man would forever be subservient to others even if they didn&#39;t want him to be. The final touch was him making them not wear anything to hide their changes. He wasn&#39;t sure if that would last but it would take a long time for them to get over that.  <br />
<br />
Later the figure walked into their small rundown apartment. It was all they could afford thanks to those losers. The figure then set his mask down and drew a big red X over each of his former band mate&#39;s faces, except for Katie who already had one over her face. his former band mates. The blond man flipped his hoodie as flashbacks showed their falling out. He was friends with the group when they formed the band. However, after several concerts, the group complained that he was partying and drinking too hard. When the man made moves on Hailee Brady pushed him off her. he then walked into what was supposed to be a band rehearsal but was revealed to be an intervention. Given how he had been drinking beforehand he took this as an insult and things got physical. Luke ended up delivering a nasty blow to his head. He then had the nerve to tell the college and police what he had done. He was expelled and sentenced to a year in prison.  <br />
<br />
However, during that time, the man had learned how to access the dark web. When he heard about the message rumor he tracked it down and found the code for it. After getting out of prison he had to wait till his parole ended to attend the next show. He kept his hood up as he sent the hypnotic message to Katie. He wasn&#39;t sure if it worked until she returned and showed her horse parts to the world. Now that his revenge against those punks was done he figured it was time to make the world pay for turning their backs on him. &quot;well, Simon old boy what&#39;s your next target&quot; There was no limit to him now. However, he didn&#39;t want to take over the world. He just wanted everyone to be freaks just like him. Now the question was who would be his next target.</p>
