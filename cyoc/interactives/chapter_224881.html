<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I want to see,” Jake looked his gangly brother in the eye, searching for any sign that he was being tricked or pranked.  <br />
<br />
“S’cuse me?!” Joe snapped back.<br />
<br />
“I want to see you turn into this Pops guy,” Jake had a flat matter-of-factness in his tone. “I mean, come on bro, you really expect me to believe you, a guy that can barely grow a few facial hairs over a week, somehow are also this gay ‘bear daddy’?” He emphasized the last few words with air quotes.<br />
<br />
“I can’t do that! I have no clue what Pops would do here- what he might do to you-“<br />
<br />
“Lame excuse, bro…If this is all real.” Jake interrupted. He looked at Joe, squinting, “and I really don’t think it is.” He thought for a second, “Look, if you’re Pops then on some level Pops is you and you won’t hurt me. And I really don’t think you want Stacy to find out about all those ‘interesting’ pics on your phone, eh?”<br />
<br />
“You wouldn’t do that,” Joe was hoping he was calling a bluff.<br />
<br />
“If it’s real, then you don’t have all that much to worry about.  After all, those pics are all ‘Pops’ doing right? And he doesn’t know about Stacy.”<br />
<br />
Joe realized he wasn’t going to win this one.<br />
<br />
“Fine….” Joe resigned, “but keep in mind, I don’t know what Pops will do.” He popped the pill into his mouth, dry swallowing it. “I don’t even know if he’ll know who you are. I mean he could do any- hnnnngggg!”<br />
<br />
“Joe!” Jake lunged toward his brother who had doubled over.<br />
<br />
“It’s….it’s starting” Joe hissed through clenched teeth and swatted Jake away.  Joe thought at first that because his brother’s back was rounded over as he held his stomach, that it looked wider, but with each breath it looked to be grow wider and wider.  Joe’s long jet black hair was steadily receding, and getting grey streaked through it.<br />
<br />
“Joe, your hair!! Are you ok??” Jake called to brother just as Joe was catching a breath in between spasms. He turned around, facing Jake, but the face wasn’t one Jake was familiar with.  Joe was still in there somewhere, but the face had become thicker, more masculine, like a man that produced massive amounts of testosterone throughout his younger days.  A beard had started growing, visibly lengthening. <br />
<br />
“Gotta….get…. Clothes OFF!”, a deepening voice called out from the changing man. On the last word, he ripped his shirt off, revealing a dense carpet of a black and grey hair over muscles that were bigger than any Jake had ever seen and were still growing. The hair, though dense and thick, did little to hide the definition of the powerful muscle beneath, a growing six — no eight pack now very visible. As the behemoth tossed the remnants of his shirt aside, Jake got a view of his arms, bigger than bodybuilders and covered with hair, though Jake could still see the veins snaking down the biceps through the fur.  He was still growing, and aging as he raised his arms above his head, stretching while lats popped out of nowhere to either side of his now massive pillows of pecs.<br />
<br />
“Nnnngggg….” he growled as he reach to his board shorts and tore them off, followed by his boxers.<br />
<br />
“Raaaahhhhhhh….arrrrrRRHHH….AAAAHHHHH…..WOOF!” The last off his moans saw his voice drop deeper and turn a bit gravelly. The changes seized to an apparent end and the new man stood there in a daze, naked, on full display.<br />
<br />
Jake looked him up and down, confused, surprised, and trying to frantically process everything that just happened in front of his eyes.  Before him stood easily the biggest man the 18 year old had ever seen.  In his mid 40’s  to early 50’s maybe, but massively muscular like a pro bodybuilder on an offseason.  His close cropped salt and pepper hair gave way to a greying well kept mustache and beard, thick and full hanging down to the man’s upper chest, the hair just melting into the pelt on his pecs.  The face was rugged, square, and very masculine.  This guy looked like he went through puberty in grade school and never stopped.  His shoulders, also hair covered, jutted out from his torso, capping 21 inch arms and gnarly, hairy forearms.  There was a fading tattoo of a bear paw over a pride flag on the man’s right delt.<br />
<br />
His chest was massive, standing off from his body like furry armor applied to a normal middle-aged guy.  Jake knew the man couldn’t see over it, his nipples pointing down from the mass of rounded muscle on top of them.  That hadn’t stopped them from being pierced with mid-scale bars.  His pecs were resting on a slight paunch of a tight roid gut. It wasn’t a full turtle shell, like some of the competitive bodybuilders Jake had seen, but it wasn’t as flat as a model’s either.  Eight abs, clearly defined though with a little extra padding were in stark relief under the salt and pepper carpet.<br />
<br />
The man’s legs were just massive.  Not as cut as his upper body, but equally hirsute with the same greying mix, this man could have been a competitive powerlifter a couple of decades earlier, and looked like he still trained for the sheer strength. <br />
<br />
The man shook his head slightly, clearing cobwebs, as he started to realize where he was.  The movement got Jake’s attention and he now noticed that one of the man’s big, meaty paws held a half gone lit Gordo, smoke coming from it, with hints of honey, maybe chocolate and……Piss??!?  The other hand was grasping the man’s massive, fat, uncut cock which had somehow evaded Jakes earlier inventory.  Jake had seen his brother naked before, and knew he was cut and not nearly as gifted as the brute that now stood in front of him. The man’s hand grabbed the soft cock and hefted it up, revealing just how big the hair covered balls behind it actually were.  <br />
<br />
Jake was so taken aback at the sight, he didn’t notice the leer on the man’s face as he started jacking the now hardening python.<br />
<br />
“Well, I ain’t usually into twinks, son, but I guess there’s a first time fer ev’rything.” The man’s low, gravelly voice hinting at a lifetime of cigar smoking.  He took a long drag, and blew the smoke into Jakes face, a toothy, hungry smile poking out from behind his facial hair.<br />
<br />
“What the living Fuck!!?!” Jake shrank back away from the man and his growing tool.  “Joe? Joe? Are you in there!?!”<br />
<br />
The man snapped his head around looking behind him, then to the other corners of the room. <br />
<br />
“What? There a third guy here too?” His deep gravelly voice having a tinge of excitement and hope at the prospect of a threesome.<br />
<br />
“What?! NO! You’re Joe. You’re my brother! Remember!? You took one of those bear pill whatevers and then change-“<br />
<br />
“Son, my name ain’t Joe, it’s Pops. I have a brother I ain’t seen in a while, and we’re the same age, so it ain’t you, boy.”<br />
<br />
“Pops….” Jake looked, defeated at the silverback looming at him.<br />
<br />
“Or ya can call me ‘daddy’, boy.” His eyes narrowed as his leaned slightly toward Jake.  “Woof.” Pops accentuated his statement with a low growl while he puffed on his cigar.<br />
<br />
“The pill! The Pill, remember you took that Bear pill?” Jake was trying to stall as the man was now at full mast, and he needed to get out of there.  He saw Joe’s phone, which he could probably get to and maybe call Wayne or somebody to help him figure out what to do.  On his other side, he saw on e of the Ursapills. It must have fallen off the dresser during the commotion.  He didn’t particularly like the idea of using it.  But he didn’t like the idea of doing whatever Pops had planned in his current state.<br />
<br />
“Bear pill- oh from that resort I stayed at? Yah, those things are just like CBD. Party pills, just something to loosen ya up.” Pops looked down at the stiff rod in his massive hand, the stubby fingers not quite getting all the way around its girth. “I think I’m pretty loose.” He looked Jake in the eye, “Don’t ya think so?  Old pops could use some help with this, boy.” He gestured to his massive dick with his hand still holding the cigar.</p>
