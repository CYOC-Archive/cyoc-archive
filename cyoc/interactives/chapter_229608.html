<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Once the girls were comfortably settled inside the McGuinness family&#39;s mansion, Luna and Diana stood up and walked into the center of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, time for the secret,&quot; Luna said. &quot;I trust you all know my teenage sister Di?&quot;<br />
<br />
Most of the girls nodded, but Lauren just scoffed. &quot;Yeah, but why is she here?&quot; Lauren asked. &quot;She&#39;s not even old enough to drink, and you bring her around to meet your sorority sisters?! Besides, from the way you talk about her, I always got the impression you hated Di&#39;s guts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Times change,&quot; Luna responded. &quot;I may have feuded with my sisters in the past, but I&#39;ve been trying to patch things up. As for why Di&#39;s here, this is a secret we both share.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, ooh, what is it?!&quot; Abigail asked excitedly. &quot;C&#39;mon, don&#39;t fucking keep us in suspense! TELL US!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down and I will, motormouth,&quot; Luna giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch,&quot; Diana said.<br />
<br />
With that, Luna and Diana began to strip naked. The Lambda Alpha Omega girls gawked as the Lyall sisters tossed their clothes to the floor, baring their muscular, hairy bodies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot; mumbled a very confused Lexie. &quot;Am I... missing something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, are we <i>that</i> kind of sorority now?&quot; asked Crystal.<br />
<br />
Lauren made a face. &quot;For God&#39;s sake, Luna! Are you trying to rope us into some kind of lesbian orgy?! Jesus! I&#39;m not a dyke like <i>you</i>, y&#39;know. I&#39;m straight as an arrow!&quot; Lauren&#39;s indignant frown suddenly curled into a spiteful smirk. &quot;And what about that Injun bitch you&#39;ve been fucking? You finally tired of munching <i>her</i> rug?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erika&#39;s fist suddenly slammed into Lauren&#39;s jaw. &quot;Racist, homophobic cunt!&quot; Erika snarled with bestial fury. &quot;You <i>do</i> remember I&#39;ve got two moms, right?! So don&#39;t talk fucking shit about Luna&#39;s girlfriend! Make one more bigoted remark and I&#39;ll rip out your goddamn tongue and fucking <i>feed</i> it to you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, Erika,&quot; Luna smiled before glaring at Lauren. &quot;Don&#39;t refer to Lucy Littlewolf as an Injun. <i>Don&#39;t</i>. Call her a <i>Native American</i>, or at least an Indian. More specifically, she&#39;s a member of the Klallam people. I expect you to show her some respect, and, in my capacity as chapter president, I <i>will</i> take steps to remove you from Lambda Alpha Omega if you keep calling Lucy slurs. And I&#39;m <i>not</i> moving on from her. Di and me are stripping because the secret will wreck our clothes if we don&#39;t, and I don&#39;t wanna destroy a shirt that cost me $5,395.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You spend <i>that</i> much on clothes?!&quot; Diana gasped as she pulled down her underwear. &quot;But you&#39;re always naked around the homestead!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I wear clothes during the school year at Seattle University,&quot; Luna shrugged with an amused grin. &quot;And I can&#39;t really go shopping or clubbing in the buff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you&#39;re nudists around the home?&quot; Belle asked, her eyes lighting up. &quot;Same!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I admit I&#39;ve dabbled in nude horseback riding,&quot; Crystal mused.<br />
<br />
Lauren noticed Luna&#39;s growing body hair. &quot;Ick! Luna, your stubble&#39;s out of fucking control control! Your legs look like shit! and is that... ARMPIT HAIR?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that a problem?&quot; Luna frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You look like a dude!&quot; Lauren lamented. &quot;I&#39;d expect that from that butch you&#39;ve got for a sister, but not you!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong with being butch?&quot; Diana glared, a bit offended.<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your mouth, Frost,&quot; Luna said firmly, looking directly into Lauren&#39;s eyes. &quot;You&#39;ve said enough already, and I will <i>not</i> let you target my family with your venomous barbs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah!&quot; Belle added. &quot;Besides, body hair is a perfectly natural thing for a grown woman to have. It&#39;s only the arbitrary whims of the fascist, ecocidal patriarchy that says otherwise. Don&#39;t listen to the tree-hating, anti-woman pigs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the spirit, Belle!&quot; Luna grinned. &quot;If you girls&#39;ll all be patient, you&#39;ll see why I&#39;m letting myself get hairy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh, mystery!&quot; Abigail chirped excitedly. &quot;So cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what&#39;s the secret?&quot; Brooke asked. &quot;Don&#39;t keep us in suspense.&quot;<br />
<br />
Luna and Diana shared a meaningful nod before starting their transformations. The room filled with gasps as the Lyall sisters&#39; red body hair began to thicken and spread until each of the pair was blanketed in a luxurious pelt of red fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Lord!&quot; Kristin gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shitballs!&quot; Erika rasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!&quot; Abigail thundered. &quot;IS THIS A DREAM?!! AM I TRAPPED IN A HORROR MOVIE?!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck ARE you?!&quot; Lauren wailed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at them!&quot; Belle proclaimed, pointing and grinning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did I somehow get drunk and high at the same time without noticing?&quot; Brook wondered aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this magic?!&quot; Crystal marveled. &quot;Is magic real?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s happening, sweetie-pie?!&quot; Lexie squeaked, diving into the embrace of Kara&#39;s arms for comfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I knew, darling!&quot; Kara shuddered as she clutched at her trembling unofficial girlfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t panic,&quot; Diana said, trying to sound reassuring. &quot;This is perfectly ordinary in our family and we won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just keep watching,&quot; Luna added nervously.<br />
<br />
Mercifully, the Lambda Alpha Omega girls began to calm down a bit. They leaned forward, watching the change with rapt fascination. Once they were over the initial shock, the sight of the metamorphosis was mesmerizing, almost hypnotic.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, all that fur <i>is</i> pretty cool,&quot; Kara remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just enjoying the sight of Luna&#39;s sister naked!&quot; Abigail chortled, licking her lips. &quot;That Di girl has some SERIOUS muscle on her! She&#39;s built like a fucking WRESTLER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it weird that I can see the appeal myself?&quot; Erika snickered. &quot;I know I&#39;m straight, but Di&#39;s bulging biceps are bigger than what most <i>guys</i> have goin&#39; on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not just you,&quot; Brooke smiled slyly. &quot;I&#39;m just as straight as you, and I&#39;m positively drooling. Check out her abs! You can even see their shape under her fur!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I honestly care more about the fur than the muscles,&quot; Belle remarked. &quot;And my bisexual self is frankly more attracted to Luna than Di.&quot; The eco-warrior&#39;s eyes suddenly lit up with joy. &quot;Look! They&#39;re growing tails!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was true. As their height surged and their muscles swelled, Luna and Diana sprouted wagging wolf tails. Their feet then reshaped into paws while their claws sharpened. As the two felt their breasts enlarge and the secondary pairs begin to bud, Diana gave into the arousal brought on by the change and began stroking her dripping pussy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn, this is hot!&quot; Brooke grinned. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe I&#39;m seeing this sober!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t believe you ARE sober!&quot; Abigail guffawed at the top of her lungs. &quot;You&#39;re usually drunk as a skunk by now and puking in the toilet!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom and Dad won&#39;t let me touch booze while I&#39;m staying with them,&quot; Brooke groaned. &quot;They say I&#39;m drinking too much! Ugh, and they wouldn&#39;t even pay for me to go on vacay for Spring Break this year! Some bullshit about &#39;we&#39;re not paying for you to go to the Florida Keys to get wasted and throw up on a stranger after having unprotected sex with him.&#39; Ugh! They&#39;re so overprotective.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, at least you&#39;re seeing <i>this</i> because of them,&quot; Kristin shrugged.<br />
<br />
Luna and Diana were now howling in ecstasy as the final changes came in. Their faces pushed out into lupine muzzles as their teeth sharpened into the razor-like fangs of an apex predator. Finally, their ears climbed up to the tops of their heads and morphed into velvety triangles. Where two human girls had once stood were now two lupine amazons, their tall furry bodies brimming with strength and agility. &quot;Like what you see?&quot; Luna chuckled with a wink.<br />
<br />
&quot;DO I EVER!&quot; Abigail squealed delightedly. &quot;But how&#39;d you do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re werewolves,&quot; Luna explained. &quot;Always have been. That homestead we live on is actually a werewolf pack&#39;s settlement. Our Dad&#39;s the alpha, though our mom has a lot of sway as well. We&#39;re showing you this because Mom says we need recruits since most of the girls in our pack are lesbians.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; asked Crystal.<br />
<br />
&quot;Local quirk of Stokerville,&quot; Diana said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom suspects vampire magic has something to do with it,&quot; Luna added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Vampires are real, too?!&quot; Abigail gasped.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d be surprised how much &#39;mythology&#39; is completely true,&quot; Diana responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;The vampires are another reason Mom wants more recruits,&quot; Luna added. &quot;She thinks the vampires are trying to provoke a war with our pack, so she needs more warriors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean we&#39;d get to kick some undead ass,&quot; Erika grinned, her predatory smile rivalling any werebeast&#39;s. &quot;I am <i>so</i> in!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t provoke the vampires once you join,&quot; Diana cautioned. &quot;Mom may be on the warpath, but Dad wants us to exercise caution, especially since we&#39;re also dealing with a pack of werefox delinquents camped on the edge of town and some &#39;monster&#39; hunters sticking their noses into Stokerville&#39;s magical community.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s a lotta possible fights,&quot; Erika said, sounding more eager than nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;You say that your mom wants us because your males need mates who are into men, right?&quot; Brooke said with a sly grin. &quot;Are the guy werewolves as buff as you two?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They sure are!&quot; Diana laughed. &quot;Who ever heard of a skinny werewolf?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is gonna be so cool!&quot; Brooke cheered, fist-pumping jubilantly.<br />
<br />
Belle gaped at Luna and Diana, captivated by their feral beauty. Each girl was equal parts woman and wolf. Belle had fantasized about such a wild partner for years. Some might call her a furry, but she merely labeled herself a lover of nature in every sense of the term. Overcome with lust and longing, she bounded over to Luna and kissed her. Startled by her own forwardness, she blushed furiously. &quot;I&#39;m so, so sorry, Luna!&quot; she apologized. &quot;I don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same thing that&#39;s come over every girl I&#39;ve ever dated... and every boy I&#39;ve ever turned down,&quot; Luna smirked. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t be sorry. Mom said I was supposed to use seduction to lure in new packmates. Since it&#39;s pack business, it won&#39;t be cheating on Lucy if we fool around. Duty to the pack always comes first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Belle didn&#39;t need to be told twice. She immediately dropped to her knees and began stroking Luna&#39;s labia and the fur of her inner thighs. Belle had always wanted to make love to a primal creature of the forest, and she shouldn&#39;t believe it was really happening! The eco-girl smiled as Luna shuddered at her touch. After a few more minutes of foreplay, Belle leaned in and ran her tongue over Luna&#39;s erect clit, causing the red-furred werewolf to howl with pleasure. The other girls had their eyes glued on Belle as she licked and sucked at Luna&#39;s pussy, a mix of shock and envy in their hearts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Again, being straight is <i>not</i> protecting me from the horny!&quot; Brooke remarked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Same,&quot; Crystal nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve always been bi,&quot; Abigail added, &quot;but now I feel EXTRA bi!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t talk like freaks!&quot; Lauren snapped. &quot;It&#39;s fucking gross! Well... mostly.&quot; Lauren blushed red as a bowl of tomato soup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Think Belle&#39;d like a little help, honey?&quot; Kara asked Lexie with a wink. &quot;Di&#39;s looking pretty lonely.&quot;</p>
