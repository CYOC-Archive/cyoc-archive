<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob read the logo on the salve bottle aloud, &quot;Essence de Old Spice. Weird. Well, it must be a new seasoning <br />
for dinner&quot;, as he quickly grabbed it and brought it downstairs with him. His Dad, Jason who had just turned <br />
45, had left out some beef and ingredients to make hamburger helper, which Jacob despised eating what seemed <br />
like everyday since his mother disappeared on day 8 months ago.<br />
<br />
Let's see, instead of using the regular spice packet in the box, I'll use this new Old Spice and see if it <br />
tastes any better. As he read the label, the instructions read: Don't have time to marinate your meat for days <br />
like they do at the fancy restaurants? Add two teaspoons to give your food that aged taste like you've never <br />
experienced before. Note, adding more than two teaspoons is not recommended because prolonged aging may occur.<br />
<br />
Jacob really hated the cheesy ravioli sauce, so he decided to spice it up. As he placed the meat and the salve <br />
in a ziplock bag, he first was hit with a strong musky odor, much like his 40 year old Dad had after working <br />
at the factory all day. He was strangely repulsed yet aroused at the same time - thinking to himself this <br />
would be like the first time he ate blue cheese, he quickly grabbed the tablespoon sized measuring tool <br />
instead of the teaspoon one on accident. Jacob carefully measured out two scoops fully aware of the <br />
instructions and not wanting to cause any prolonged aging to his sirloin hamburger meat. Noticing it was <br />
already 5:30, he cooked the meat and couldn't wait to finish dinner and eat it with his little brother Chad <br />
and his Dad. <br />
<br />
As his Dad arrived home 10 minutes later, his Dad thought dinner smelt strange but did not have an appetite <br />
because of a work retirement party this afternoon. Not wanting to disappoint Jacob, he still quickly made his <br />
way to the shower and cleaned up. On his way downstairs, he called for Chad to come eat and Thanked Jacob for <br />
making dinner.<br />
<br />
Chad complained he didn't like the smell of the food and made asked his Dad to make him a grilled cheese <br />
sandwich instead, but Jacob starting chowing down. Asking his son if he hadn't eaten in a week, they couldn't <br />
help but watch Jacob quickly became more ravenous and ate more and more until the whole meal had been <br />
consumed. Feeling satisfied like he hadn't in a long time, Jacob asked to be excused to wash up before he <br />
began on his homework for school the next day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soon he was in the bathroom, getting the bath ready as he started to feel hot and tingly all over. As Jacob <br />
looked in the mirror, he noticed hair starting to form in his underarms and around his penis. Suddenly his <br />
arms and legs began to stretch out as he began to grow taller with more hair on those body parts. Jacob <br />
appeared to had aged about 3 years in the past few minutes and he seemed to be getting more hotter as he <br />
continued to grow. Starting to freak out, he quickly grabbed a towel and peaked his head out to his yell for <br />
his Dad to come upstairs. His Dad yelled back that he would be right up. So Jacob continued to watch as he <br />
continued to grow another foot and his body grew more muscles. As his hair started becoming bushier under his <br />
arms, he noticed that he was producing the same aroma as the Old Spice he used on the meat earlier. As he <br />
began to feel warmer again, he started maturing once again into his early 20's. Jacob had to admit that he was <br />
incredible handsome an admired his chest hairs that seemed to had sprung upwards from his penis and sparsely <br />
covered his chest in a light black coating. <br />
<br />
After a few moments his Dad knocked on the door asking, &quot;What's wrong Jacob? Are you feeling OK after eating <br />
all that dinner? Smelling a strong musky odor emanating from the bathroom, Jason stated, &quot;Jacob, now that you <br />
are 12 you have to start using the deodorant I bought you everyday. You're growing into manhood and need to <br />
properly take care of yourself if you ever want to find a girlfriend one day.&quot; He thought it was strange had <br />
such a strong odor, and didn't realize he had became intoxified with the aroma as he started to have more grey <br />
hairs. &quot;Well if you need anything else, let me know. I'm going to watch some old westerns.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sighing a huge relief, Jacob soon began to heat up again and tingled all over. He noticed the Old Spice Salve <br />
scent had intensified, almost like as thick like a fog around him. He began to worry as he started to put on <br />
some weight and noticed the beginnings of his hairline receding. He had to be in his late 20's now as he felt <br />
like he lost some of his youthful luster from his late teen / early 20's. As he watched with much trepidation, <br />
this time his aging began to happen faster now. He watched as his waistline began to slowly expand and his <br />
hairline in turn began to slowly recede. For every bit of hair leaving his head, it seemed to populate on his <br />
chest, legs, or arms. As his nose began to expand some and his ears continued to slowly grow, Jacob was <br />
looking increasingly like his Father and less like the 12 year old boy.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately his appearance wasn't the only thing that began to change - Jacob seemed to have horrible <br />
indigestion as his stomach started making strange gurgling noises. Before he knew it, he had released the <br />
largest fart he had ever done in his life, sounding off like a small machine gun for 20 seconds. It smelt like <br />
the old spice salve as he continued to age quicker. Soon he had a 50:50 mixture of grey and black hair as he <br />
realized the smell was unbearably strong. Soon Jacob figured the smell must be causing him to age as he <br />
decided he had to risk being seen and getting out of the bathroom. Opening the door, Jacob quickly ran to his <br />
Dad's room, leaving an incredible Old Spice Musk cloud behind him - but he had to find some of his Dad's <br />
clothing and figure out how to stop aging. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately he ran into Chad and quickly told him to be quiet if he didn't want to get hurt. Chad watched <br />
the strange naked older as he looked through the dresser and attempted to put on his father's clothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you and why do you smell like that.&quot;, Chad managed to say. Jacob tried to explain what had happened <br />
and Chad didn't seem like he was buying it. Chad hadn't realized it, but his legs and arms had also began to <br />
grow too long for his pajamas. The longer he was in the same room as the strange older man, the more he <br />
enjoyed the old spice musky smell.</p>
