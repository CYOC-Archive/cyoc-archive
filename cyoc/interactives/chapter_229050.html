<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Any animal?&quot; Cody asked the unicorn. He had put Jason into a pen while he did some thinking, and was now leaning against Aura&#39;s pen, head rested on his hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any animal,&quot; Aura echoed. &quot;Of any age or gender.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cody had an idea. For most of his life, he rarely left the farm. His parents decided to not both with school for him, and brought him up as a farmhand for their family farm. Because of this, he barely knew anyone, and trips were few and far between. &#39;Everything you need, we have here&#39; is what is parents would always tell him.<br />
<br />
But he had a chance to really go on an adventure here, if he played this right.<br />
<br />
&quot;You,&quot; Cody said simply.<br />
<br />
Aura blinked, a little confused. &quot;Pardon?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I mean, I&#39;d like to become you. Err... well... n-not you exactly. I-I...guess a copy of you? You said you&#39;re on... uh... a vacation, right? Maybe I could... make it last a bit longer for you! If I went back to where you come from and pretended to be you for a while. Could... um... could that work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aura stared at him for a while, then looked down, pacing and muttering to herself. Finally, she looked back to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I suppose that could work, yes,&quot; she began, making Cody beam. She brought up a hoof to shush him though, before continuing. &quot;However, there are a few things you must understand. One, turning you into a unicorn... is not an easy feat. And I wouldn&#39;t be able to undo it for at least half a year. I would have to remain here, regaining my energy again to perform a reversal spell. You&#39;d be stuck as a copy of me for that long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Two, I am a very respected member of the forest guardians. If I find out you made a fool of me, there will be punishments in order. Understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Third, you will need to let me train you first. This should take... mm... probably a week&#39;s time. This means staying in the barn. With your brother, who finds me very attractive. Do you accept these conditions?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory was a little nervous about that last part... but... he had a chance for a real adventure. And he wasn&#39;t going to say no now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
Aura smiled. &quot;Good boy. Now come here. This should be a lot quicker than with your brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cory opened the pen and came up to her, unsure exactly what this was going to involve if it was different than with Jason. He watched as a strange white light began to emit out of Aura&#39;s horn. Slowly it inched up to the top of her horn and then leaked out like a mist. It slowly wafted over and began to surround him in a thick fog.<br />
<br />
He started to feel ticklish and a bit itchy. He couldn&#39;t see in the thick fog, but he could certain feel something. His hands began to feel numb and his fingernails began to grow and fuse together, gradually becoming a solid keratin substance, as the remains of his fingers melted together into one object. His skin on his hands... err, hooves... and arms began to get more leathery, as white fur sprouted.<br />
<br />
His arms grew longer, becoming very disproportionate to the rest of his ten-year-old body. He found a subtle force slowly pushing him downwards, as his chest grew out in size and his neck angled itself 90 degrees from it. Thankfully, his spinal structure was adjusting to this change, and the subtle force fully put him on all fours, his legs by this point mirroring his arms.<br />
<br />
The white fur migrated upwards, along with his skin getting more leathery. As his whole torso grew longer, it also took on some curves and gained some muscles. Of course, no where near Jason. Aura was a graceful mare, not some rough and tough stallion. By this point, his shirt had ripped to pieces, and was just dangling by some threads on his back.<br />
<br />
He felt his neck stretch upwards, and his groans adjusted in pitch, as his voice changed to Aura&#39;s feminine tone. His face pushed outwards, his nose and mouth forming together into one white muzzle. The boy&#39;s human teeth flattened to become more suited for an herbivore, and his tongue grew much longer. He gave an involuntary huff as his ears migrated upwards, shifting to more triangular horsey shapes. His eyes turned to a deep beautiful blue, moving to the sides of this new muzzle.<br />
<br />
Cody&#39;s short brown hair started to cascade downwards, as the hue of it changed to a bright platinum silver color. Somehow, probably in part from the magic, the new mane styled itself with several intermittent curls and flowers embedded.<br />
<br />
Now, the part he regretted began to happen. His petite human rear began to grow larger into equine-sized flanks, ripping off his pants. A silvery tail, matching his mane, grew to cover his modesty somewhat, but that was the last thing on his mind, as he felt a strong sensation in his nethers. His underdeveloped male equipment became even more pathetic as it swiftly shrunk. Slowly, but surely, it was being sucked into him somehow. Before long, none of it remained, and had inverted into the equipment of a mare. The organic remains were recycled in Cody&#39;s internal plumbing to create the reproductive system fitting a proper mare. Finalizing this change, two plump teats grew in front of Cody&#39;s new vagina.<br />
<br />
Cody blushed, or well, he... she... would, if horses could blush. &quot;Is....i-is it over now?&quot;<br />
<br />
Aura, still focusing, smirked, and didn&#39;t respond. Cody soon found out why. She shrieked as a bony structure violently grew out of her head with no warning. Her mind swam with things she could not understand, the magical ley lines filling her entirety and gifting her with the ability of magic.<br />
<br />
Finally, the mist cleared, and a tired looking Aura grinned at her handiwork (hoofiwork?). &quot;Like looking in a mirror. Now, I&#39;m going to take a nap. We can start after. Oh, and if you wanna sample Jason, feel free. You&#39;re a unicorn now too, so don&#39;t worry about the virgin thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I&#39;m not gonna let my brother...d-do that to me!&quot; Cody shouted, flustered beyond belief, and still out of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Suuure,&quot; Aura replied, eyes half-closed. &quot;We&#39;ll see how long that determination lasts. But, do whatever, just don&#39;t get into any trouble. Naptime for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
She yawned and drifted off, oblivious to any complaints Cody might have had for her after that.<br />
<br />
Cody frowned, and...</p>
