<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Stephanie sighed as she gazed out the window. It seemed that the more things changed the more they stayed the same.<br />
<br />
Life in New York hadn&#39;t been easy for the 16 year old. Before the passing of her parents, she had found herself going to some of the most exclusive schools in the city. Yes, she had excelled in her studies but had made no friends. Once high school started she found herself in a very similar situation, excelling and putting on a confident front but feeling incredibly lonely with only her nanny as a constant companion. Then her world was turned upside down.<br />
<br />
The death of her parents was both a blessing and a curse. Yes her relationship with them was at best strained but they were still her parents, Stephanie wondered if they were actually proud of her accomplishments. She had never gotten a real answer. Living with Ann and then Jackie had greatly improved her home life. For the first time she felt unconditional love but, loving parents didn&#39;t exactly mean alot of friends. Stephanie was lonely, spending far too many weekends by herself when other teens were out enjoying themselves. This is why after her Sophmore year, when Ann asked if she wanted to move in order to be closer to Ann&#39;s sister and her family, she jumped at the opportunity.<br />
<br />
Things seemed great at first, Ann had allowed her to buy a nice car and she even met a really nice and cute guy across the street. She was finally going to have a normal teenage life. Then the rug was seemingly pulled out from under her.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t blame Chenoa for returning, she didn&#39;t even blame Miles. It had been a simple misunderstanding, Miles friends more angry with Miles boneheadedness than they were with Stephanie. Nat and Rei&#39;s party had been alot of fun, Stephanie maintaining her air of confidence but deep down, she was embarrassed. Despite good looks, great intelligence, and a witty personality Stephanie struggled with alot of insecurities. It had led to the teen sitting around her house by herself for a week, despite numerous call from Nat and her friends to get together.<br />
<br />
&quot;Steph,&quot; Ann said quietly, opening the door to her adopted daughters bedroom. &quot;Theres someone here to see you.&quot; Stephanie sighed, her shoulders slumping as she turned to the woman. &quot;Really don&#39;t want to see anyone,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Can you like, make up an excuse or something? Tell them I&#39;m sick or have cramps or whatever.&quot; Ann sighed, watching the sullen teen with sympathetic eyes. This brought back many memories of Ann&#39;s own lonely teenage years. &quot;Sorry Steph but I don&#39;t think she&#39;s taking no for an answer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steph groaned, casting a weary eye towards Ann as an excited presence now bounded into the room. Curiously Stephanie now studied the girl dressed in a floor length patchwork skirt and spaghetti strapped top, she beamed at Stephanie with energetic eyes. &quot;Chenoa?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Stephanie,&quot; Chenoa beamed, the Deer girls excitement almost palatable. &quot;I was hoping we could get together. You&#39;re not busy are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um no,&quot; Stephanie stammered. &quot;Um not really but, um...why aren&#39;t you with Miles?&quot; Chenoa giggled, the Deer girl skipping towards Stephanie as she plopped down next to her. &quot;Well he has practice today with Connor,&quot; she smiled. &quot;So I found myself with some free time and wanted to visit. All week Miles has been apologizing so I think we both needed some, how does it go? Me time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I get that,&quot; Stephanie replied. &quot;But, why me? I thought you were mad at me about the whole Miles thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not mad at you Steph,&quot; Chenoa smiled. &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault. Besides, I thought we were friends.&quot; Stephanie paused, casting the Deer girl a quizzical look. Just looking at Chenoa, she could see no malice or ill will on the girls face.  Chenoa&#39;s dark eyes sparkled, her teeth forming into a warm smile on her mocha skin. It took Stephanie aback that she appeared so warm and friendly to someone who had tried to date her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stephanie would love to hangout with you Chenoa,&quot; Ann interrupted. &quot;In fact, why don&#39;t you two head towards the mall. Hangout, get a bite to eat, do some girl stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what this girl stuff is but it sounds like fun,&quot; Chenoa said happily. &quot;Do you want to go to this Mall and do girl stuff Steph?&quot; Stephanie balked, unable to come up with a response. Looking back at Ann, she could tell this wasn&#39;t a suggestion. &quot;Um sure,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Um let me just grab some stuff. &quot;<br />
<br />
To say Chenoa was a ball of energy would have been an understatement as the pair of teens made their way through the Mall. The human world was still new to the Deer girl, Chenoa finding the most mundane things wondrous. She loved how comfortable Stephs car was, she loved the music on the radio, she was enthralled by the numerous shops scattered throughout the Mall itself. Stephanie couldn&#39;t help but smile as the pair floated from store to store. Chenoa was a ray of sunshine, the energetic teenage girl possessing a positive if somewhat naive view of the human world. &quot;I guess that&#39;s what happens when you grow up in the woods,&quot; Stephanie thought.<br />
<br />
After grabbing lunch, (a burger for Steph while Chenoa sampled a vegetarian meal) and some ice cream, the pair continued on their tour of the mall. &quot;I had no idea ice cream was so good,&quot; Chenoa stated between licks. &quot;What flavor was this again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Double chocolate chip,&quot; Stephanie replied. &quot;Always one of my favorites.&quot; Chenoa nodded, continuing to enjoy her ice cream as the pair walked and talked. It surprised Stephanie just how much the two seemed to compliment eachother. Chenoa, like her, had been sheltered. Growing up in the forest and having little contact with humans. Unlike Stephanie though, her parents were always present and quite loving. Still, Chenoa like Stephanie didn&#39;t have any friends, she just didn&#39;t let it bother her the way it bothered Stephanie. <br />
<br />
As the teens giggled, Stephanie now caught sight of a nail salon, an impish smirk now cracking across her delicate features. &quot;Cmon Chenoa,&quot; she grinned. &quot;I&#39;m going to give you the full New York treatment!&quot; Chenoa simply nodded, letting the teen girl drag her inside the salon.<br />
<br />
When Stephanie had been in New York, she had made it a point of always getting her nails done. For the girls at her old school, it was one of those things that every teenage girl did, Stephanie included. Making her way to the counter, she could think of no better way to end their mall trip than treating her new friend to the same experience. <br />
<br />
Deciding on a mani/pedi the teens now picked out colors as they sat down. Chenoa at first apprehensive as the nail techs began to work on her hands and feet. &quot;You doing alright there Chenoa,&quot; Stephanie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she stammered, her cheeks flushing a bit. &quot;But I&#39;ve neve had this done before. It feels a bit weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You get used to it,&quot; Stephanie smiled. &quot;Just sit back and relax. Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Forty minutes later the two teens exited the salon. Stephanie sporting pink gel nails with toes to match. Admiring the design on her manicure, she now turned to Chenoa, the Deer girl gazing in wonder at her red finger and toe nails. &quot;They look so beautiful,&quot; Chenoa stated in awe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Told you red was a good color for you,&quot; Stephanie replied with a smile. &quot;Do you think your hooves will turn red when you change back?&quot; Chenoa giggled, unsure if that would happen but hoping that would be the case. &quot;Thank you Stephanie,&quot; she smiled. &quot;I truely enjoyed girls time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Me too,&quot; Stephanie smiled. &quot;We should do this again soon. You know, when you&#39;re not going out with Miles.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I would like that,&quot; Chenoa said softly, a warm smile on her face. &quot;And I hope you too can find someone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish,&quot; Steoh scoffed. &quot;But let&#39;s face it. I&#39;m not just going to walk face first into a boyfriend.&quot; No sooner had the words left Stephanie&#39;s mouth had the two teens turned the corner. Stephanie walking face first into the chest of a passing teen. Stumbling backwards she now rubbed her the sore spot on her forehead. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh geez I&#39;m sorry are you alright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stephanie winced, frowning before gasping as she beheld a very handsome teenage boy.  &quot;Wow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No I&#39;m um sorry,&quot; Stephanie stammered, her cheeks flushing in embarrassment as she looked at the boy. He stood close to six feet tall, his face boyish yet having a strong jaw. The teens grey blue eyes and well kept dirty blond hair making him look as if he had just stepped from the pages of a celebrity magazine. &quot;I&#39;m Stephanie hi,&quot; she replied awkwardly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Travis.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were wrong Stephanie,&quot; Chenoa said excitedly. &quot;You DID walk right into a boyfriend!&quot; Stephanie and Travis now both turned red as they awkwardly exchanged glances. Chenoa&#39;s statement may have been embarrassing but Stephanie now did hope that Chenoa was correct.</p>
