<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of Aidan&#39;s fantasies became a reality; the Chronivac reduced him into a child.  Sure he couldn&#39;t get aroused anymore, but this was only the beginning.  As much as Aidan would love to spend the night in the body that he had 13 years ago, there were other fantasies that he wanted to satisfy.  Other than age regression, weight gain was one fantasy that Aidan would easily get off to, at least when he was an adult.  While he would have used the Chronivac to really pack on the pounds if he was older, Aidan needed to be more careful with how much he needed to gain to be as fat as the victims in the weight gain stories.<br />
<br />
The boy scrolled through and hovered over the weight options.  There were options to gain the weight in fat, muscle, or both, with percentage boxes for both.  This may be an option for later, maybe when Aidan is older again, but right now Aidan wanted pure flab.  He did have his share of baby fat before puberty, but Aidan wanted to take this over the top by entering childhood obesity.  He checked the box for fat and scrolled down to a box that asked him how much he wanted to weigh.  Given that Aidan is 9 years old and stands at 4&#39; 3&quot;, he set his new weight to 130, rendering him even heavier than when he was 13.  <br />
<br />
As soon as the number was entered, a warning popped up. &quot;Attention: You have opted to add a large quantity of non-muscle weight. We suggest new users increase their fitness level when trying a change like this for the first time. Would you like Chronivac to automatically adjust your fitness level?&quot;  Aidan laughed at the question as he answered no.  He wanted to feel like a fat kid.  Like the previous change, he did not want the wardrobe to morph to fit him, and he did not want any reality changes.  He also set this change to be permanent until changed again.  Unlike the previous change, Aidan did not want his weight gain to be in chunks, but rather in a slow, continuous manner as the boy wanted to see his body inflate.  Aidan already knew what the transformations felt like, but he could barely contain his excitement like last time, even as he clicked begin, or as Aidan glanced at his body before the changes began.<br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s body began to puff.  The familiar tingling sensation made its way throughout the boy&#39;s body, with new fat cells popping into existence beneath his prepubescent skin.  The boy ran to the mirror, already noticing a slight jiggle on his thighs and stomach.  His face, already rounded by getting younger, was puffing up as well, and there were even early signs of a second chin.  Man boobs started appearing on his torso and growing at a rapid pace, which only made Aidan laugh harder.  He looked down to see that his prepubescent penis had just started to get obstructed by his newly developed sugar belly.  Just seeing his stomach grow was starting to make Aidan hungry, and his desire for larger meals only intensified the fatter the boy became.  Aidan walked to the fridge, feeling his thighs being pressed together and hearing a slight rumbling from getting very fat.  He checked inside to see what would satisfy his growing hunger, while also feeling how gravity was pulling his torso and chest down.  After hearing his stomach growl, the changes stopped, but Aidan didn&#39;t notice until closing the fridge door and saw that he wasn&#39;t getting any bigger.  Aidan could only walk back to the Chronivac as he was already too tired to run, and the results of both changes were right before him.<br />

<br />
Jumping up and down at the thought that the Chronivac transformed him from a strapping, athletic adult into a cute-looking, albeit obese, child, Aidan forgot that his mobile had been buzzing on and off for the last 30 minutes.  His small, chubby hand picking it up, seeing a text from Geoff: &quot;hittin the pub in 10 min. come with&quot;, alongside a few missed calls.  Aidan was at a loss for what to do; he was so caught up in his fantasies that he forgot that he was planning on having a night out at the pub tonight.  Of course Aidan had his heart set on spending the night as another example of childhood obesity, but he didn&#39;t want anyone, especially Geoff, to see him this way.  To top this off, Aidan was also naked.<br />
<br />
As Aidan was gathering his thoughts, he heard his front door open, and Geoff&#39;s footsteps.  Aidan was about to run and hide, but then he heard a clear &quot;Aidan?&quot; from the door behind him.  The boy&#39;s face was red as soon as he turned around to see Geoff in the room, not quite ready to explain his situation.  &quot;Aidan, what...what the fuck happened to you?&quot; Geoff choked out as he tried not to stare at the boy&#39;s nude body.<br />
<br />
Aidan wasn&#39;t sure what to say. He couldn&#39;t tell the truth, or at least not yet.  He didn&#39;t want Geoff to think he was either some fat obsessed freak or a pervert.  Hell, the Chronivac in the other room was probably a hard sell already, telling him about it might just make him think Aidan is crazy.  So he did the only thing he could think of; he lied.  &quot;I...I have no idea.  I came back inside, fell asleep while getting ready, and I woke up like this!&quot;  Geoff was very confused by the explanation; a part of him believed that Aidan somehow ended up a kid again, and that he was fat when he was younger, but he also thought this might be some sick, twisted prank.  Geoff looked him up and down, trying to take stock of why Aidan ended up younger again.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll go see what I can find.  You sure this isn&#39;t some dream or prank?&quot; Geoff asked, a little lost on how to help his childish friend.  Aidan, pretending to be confused, just nodded and replied, &quot;I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s anything small enough to fit me now, though.&quot;  As Geoff left the room, Aidan turned towards the Chronivac.</p>
