<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><br />
As her new character finished being created, her environment shifted from a cozy cottage to a tiny dump of a &quot;room&quot; in a ghetto.     There were 4 straw mats crammed into the small space, each with 2 girls a piece on top of them.  As she looked around new memories flooded her mind.  She didn&#39;t forget Alex, but now Lillian was there too.  Looking at the other girls she realized she knew and cared about all of them.  She knew their prostitute names of course, nonsense names like &quot;Pixie&quot; and &quot;Crystal&quot;, but she didn&#39;t care about those.  Those were in her eyes their slave names.  She looked to her own mat-mate, Ada, and remembered falling asleep in her arms last night.  <br />
<br />
Tears filled her eyes.  Wasn&#39;t this supposed to be just a game?  But Ada felt so real!  The connection they had, the love she felt for her, was real.  How could this be?  But she realized she didn&#39;t care.  What she cared about now was protecting them.<br />
<br />
BANG BANG BANG.  Someone slammed their fist against the door.  &quot;WAKE UP YOU WHORES.  TIME TO WORK!&quot;  That would be Saldric, their manager, or in modern terms, their pimp.  Lillian might have submissively gotten up for a day&#39;s work, but there was enough of Alex in her that she was furious.  The way he treated these girls was appalling, even for a pimp.  He was human trash.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck off, you humanoid hemorrhoid!&quot;  she shouted.<br />
<br />
The door flew open.  &quot;What bitch dares?&quot; Saldric stood in the doorway.  He was six and a half feet of half-orc muscle, sweat, and stink.  He guessed who had spoken quickly enough by the shocked looks on the other girls&#39; faces and the defiant one on Lillian&#39;s.  At the sight a sort of sick mirth filled his eye.  &quot;Oh really?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Little Lilly finally got some fire in her?  Ain&#39;t that something.&quot;  He took a drag on his cigar as he stepped closer, and though he was amused, danger was in his eyes too.  &quot;Look you dumb bitch, go to work, and we&#39;ll forget about it just this once.&quot;  He patted her on the head.<br />
<br />
She didn&#39;t have time to search her new memories to quite consciously know how much danger she might be in, but she knew it in her gut, knew it in the way her knees trembled.  &quot;Screw you, Smalldick.  I quit.&quot; she said.  She wasn&#39;t backing down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why you-&quot;  Saldric&#39;s hand rose to give her a blow, but she jumped back and raised her own hands, a fireball spell in each.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay back!&quot;  she warned.<br />
<br />
For a second the orc&#39;s eyes were pure rage.  She knew if he charged there was no way her amateur fireballs would stop him.  They&#39;d probably just piss him off more.  The other girls watched in terror.  She knew that at least Ada probably wanted to help, but they probably weren&#39;t sure if getting involved would make things better or worse.<br />
<br />
The standoff lasted for several tense seconds.  &quot;Fine, you stupid whore.  Get out of my building!&quot; he shouted.<br />
<br />
Seconds later she was out the front door without even a chance to say goodbye to the other girls.  She wasn&#39;t sure how this was going to protect them. She&#39;d just reacted in blind rage.  She supposed she&#39;d come back later and talk to them, or maybe find a way to make some money and take them all in?  But for now she had to worry about herself.  How was she going to eat?  She thought about it as she hurriedly walked away from Saldric&#39;s shouted promises that she&#39;d come crawling back to him.<br />
<br />
As she walked she received a solicitation from someone she remembered as an old customer.  That might make for some quick cash, but even if she hadn&#39;t been a completely different, male person when she woke up today, she&#39;d probably still have decided that she was done with that life.  Never again(and for Alex, not for the first time!).<br />
<br />
She thought about her stats again and found that she could will the stat window into reappearing.  Exploring further she found windows for quests, inventory, mini-map, and game help.  That last one proved invaluable as she spent a few minutes reading about the game she found herself in.   Turns out that skills like her fireball would become exponentially more valuable as she leveled up.  Her wisdom would increase their power, but the skills themselves still needed to be leveled before that wisdom could be very well applied.  She decided that if she could get it even as high as level 3 she might could qualify to join a low level party and start adventuring.  The problem was that her inventory showed her to have about enough money to live on for about 2 days tops.  So she had that much time to level up her skill, find a party, and get a quest completed before she&#39;d starve.<br />
<br />
Well, nothing to do for it but try.  Her mini-map revealed only places that Lillian knew, and she couldn&#39;t afford to buy a map from a store or anything like that.  Fortunately, Lillian knew at least of nearby Willowwill Forest, and that it had only low level monsters.  The perfect newbie grinding spot.<br />
<br />
Soon she was on the edge of the forest.  Warily she stepped forward.  She was so weak, she might be in danger even here.  Then something rustled in the bushes!  She readied a fireball in each hand and prepared herself for battle.<br />
<br />
It jumped out!  Its data quickly displayed on a pop-up window.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Lv. 1 Rab-bat<br />
HP: 10/10<br />
MP: 0/0<br />
Element: Leaf<br />
Information:  A hybrid of a rabbit and a bat, made by a mad scientist.  Weak to fire. Watch out for it&#39;s drain-life attack!<br />
:::<br />
<br />
Perfect!  A level one monster with a weakness to fire!  She fired...and missed!  Her MP dropped from her Maximum of 220 down to 200.  It charged, baring its fangs.  So fast!  She fired again...direct hit!  But though it staggered it was still coming!  She didn&#39;t have time to charge another fireball, so desperately she threw her fist forward.  It connected square with the monster&#39;s nose, doing exactly 1HP of damage and finishing the creature off.  <br />
<br />
She breathed a sigh of relief, but god did she suck for now.  As a sorceror she was supposed to be a high DPS glass cannon, but she couldn&#39;t even one-shot a bunny with an element advantage.  She knew from reading the game mechanics that that would rapidly change once she leveled up her fireball, but until then she really might die out here.  If she died in this game, what would happen?  Would she return to her world, or just be dead?<br />
<br />
She wasn&#39;t going back to Saldric though, or leaving the girls there with him, so she had no choice but to proceed.<br />
<br />
She found that most of the monsters here were passive until attacked though, so she was able to stick to lv 1 Rab-bats.  She grew near both to a character level up and a fireball level up as the day reached its end, but she was out of MP!  She could return to town to purchase a MP restoration potion in order to level up, but she could scarcely spare the cash.  Nothing to do in the forest though until she had more MP, so she turned to go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well well well,&quot; came a male voice.  She spun around to see a group of unsavory looking brutes.  Their information showed them to be bandits.  Their levels were low, but higher than hers, and there were 4 of them. &quot;What have we here?  An innocent young girl out in the woods on her lonesome? A girl shouldn&#39;t be out at night without a chaperone.  She&#39;s lucky we showed up, isn&#39;t she boys?&quot;<br />
<br />
Luck it was, but not good luck.  This was probably that damn curse again, attracting evil to her.  She&#39;d been so stupid.  She should have just cut Saldric&#39;s throat in his sleep and found some way to eat that didn&#39;t involve going into the wild.  Now she would die and be of no use to anyone.<br />
<br />
There was a chorus of laughter from the thugs.  &quot;Nah, the bitch ain&#39;t lucky at all.&quot; Came the voice of a second thug, &quot;But we sure are.&quot;  He stepped forward and brandished a knife.  &quot;Clothes.  Off.  Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
No way.  Not without a fight.  She couldn&#39;t win, but she&#39;d sure try.  She had exactly enough MP left for one more fireball.  There was also her charm skill, which she hadn&#39;t tried yet, but it was unlikely to save her since it only worked on one target, once per day.  Then there was her Succubus Transformation.  As she understood it she couldn&#39;t use it even once a day without turning into a demon eventually, but she could use it on rare occasion without ill effects.  If there was ever a time for it, this was it, though she didn&#39;t know exactly what it would do.<br />
<br />
She triggered the transformation and her purple eyes turned red, tiny black wings sprouted from her back, and little horns grew from her forehead.  In addition she could swear her breasts felt a little heavier.  She felt...different.  She felt powerful, and that was a rush, She felt her pent up despair and anger transform into rage and blood lust,  She felt any qualms at having to kill them vanish, but most of all she felt horny.  So so so horny, and sexy! Not that these filth deserved her charms.<br />
<br />
Looking at her information she saw that all of her skills were now at level 2! Nice.  Charm would now work twice a day, and fireball might actually kill one!  She wasn&#39;t sure how charm worked, but if it made them fight for her, she could win!  All of her stats were boosted too.  Additionally she had a new skill: <br />
<br />
:::<br />
- Aura Sense lv 1:  Sense the life force and sexual energy of nearby beings.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
  She grinned a predatory grin at them and charged a fireball.  The bandits fearfully stepped back and drew their weapons.  &quot;She&#39;s some kind of demon!&quot; cried the leader, &quot;Spread out and take her down!&quot; <br />
<br />
As they circled her she locked eyes on the leader.  It was time to try that charm spell.  As she triggered it, her eyes flared with red light, and she winked at him.  He froze in his tracks, and her newly attuned aura senses let her know his lust for her was growing to overwhelm his senses.  He was her thrall now. She smiled.  &quot;Now be a good boy and kill your friends, won&#39;t you?&quot;  she said.  <br />
<br />
She turned around to charm another one, but then she was tackled from behind!  Her last fireball shot uselessly into the darkness as she fell to the ground.  The bandit leader that she&#39;d thought she&#39;d enthralled had rushed her at incredible speed.  She struggled to get him off, but it was no use.  She noticed that his stats had changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Lv. 3 Bandit Leader<br />
HP: 20/20<br />
MP: 5/5<br />
Element: None<br />
Information:  The leader of a gang of common thugs<br />
Status Conditions: <br />
-Berserker Lust:  Driven mad with lust, this bandit has gone into a frenzy, increasing his stats and causing him to ignore damage until he dies or sates his lust.<br />
:::<br />
<br />
What the hell?  What kind of useless charm spell was that?  Now she would be raped and then die.<br />
<br />
Having guessed what had happened, the other bandits just laughed as their leader ripped off his clothes and hers. Tears streamed from her eyes as his throbbing erection aimed at her entrance.  Worst of all, she was turned on. This damn succubus transformation made her a total slut.  She tried to turn it off, but an information window appeared to inform her that she could not deactivate it for another 2 minutes and 38 seconds.<br />
<br />
Then he was inside her.  It was completely brutal as he pounded away without mercy, but while most of her wanted to keep struggling until it killed her, her succubus side was thrilled.  Soon she began to moan in spite of herself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehheh, the slut likes it!&quot;  said one of the onlookers.  She wanted to die, even as good as it felt.  She hated that she was losing herself to it, hated what she was becoming.  She just wanted to die.<br />
<br />
Then she noticed something:  His HP had dropped!  He was down to 15/20.  A window appeared before her face.  &quot;Soul Drain activated.  Convert energy to MP or to XP?&quot;  Of course!  She&#39;d never planned to use the damn succubus soul drain, but it might save her life now.<br />
<br />
She mentally selected MP, and watched as her MP refilled at twice the rate that his HP was dropping.  That meant that when he was dead she&#39;d have 2 fireballs worth of MP.  She also still had one more charm skill useage.  She could do this!  <br />
<br />
She wrapped her legs around him, urging him on, feeling his life become her power.  &quot;Yes, yes, YES!&quot; she cried.  The pleasure and the power rush together were to much. &quot;Give it to me!  Give it all to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
At last he reached the end of his HP, and a big stupid smile covered his face as he came and the last of his life went into her.  His body fell upon hers and she struggled to push him off.<br />
<br />
The bandits were still laughing, thinking that their leader had just passed out from exhaustion.  She finally managed to get him off of her, and they noticed his lifeless face.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell?  She killed him!&quot;  cried one.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know what she is!  She&#39;s one of those succubi!&quot; said another.<br />
<br />
&quot;Kill her!&quot; shouted a third, and they rushed her, but two fireballs quickly dispatched the front 2.  She looked at the last bandit and winked at him, but she didn&#39;t use her charm yet.  He paled and froze.  &quot;Please, don&#39;t.  I&#39;ll do anything...&quot;<br />
<br />
She shrugged.  &quot;Get out of here then.&quot;  she said.  He took off running.  She didn&#39;t like letting that trash live, but it was probably wise to save her last charm useage, and even in this form she didn&#39;t love the idea of being violated again...yet.<br />
<br />
She stood up and brushed herself off.  Her clothes were in shreds.  Great.  She&#39;d have to buy new ones.  She knew she should probably turn off the succubus transformation, but she also knew that as soon as she was human again she might start crying in trauma.  Being a demon was easier than being human right now.<br />
<br />
She looked at her stats and found that she&#39;d leveled up her fireball to level 2(3 while transformed) and her player level had increased as well.  She noticed that she&#39;d gotten a free charisma point from her Unworldly Beauty passive skill, and put the 2 points for the level into wisdom, bringing it to 24(slight math error in the previous chapter).  She thought her breasts might have gotten just slightly larger when the charisma point was added, her hips slightly wider, and her butt slightly plumper and rounder.  Apparently she&#39;d end up looking the part of a super slut succubus after all.  It would just take a while.<br />
<br />
At least she had 3 bandit corpses to loot.  They&#39;d been a miserable and ragged lot of failing thieves, so they didn&#39;t have much, but they had enough gold and sellable weapons between them to get her some new clothes and to extend her budget another day.  She threw on some ill-fitting bandit clothes to give her some modesty, and with a sigh she prepared to turn off the succubus transformation and face her human side.<br />
<br />
Then she inwardly cursed as profanely as she ever had when she heard a heavy rustling in the bushes behind her.  Leaving on the transformation she turned around.  Emerging from the bushes was some sort of man-beast.  He looked like an anthropomorphic rabbit, except that he had bat wings and 2 massive fangs.  His eyes were a terrifying beady red, and as he was totally naked she could see his massive cock hanging.  It looked partially engorged.  He&#39;d been watching. She looked at his information.<br />
<br />
:::<br />
Boss:  Lv 5 Rab-bat Man.<br />
HP: 45/45<br />
MP: 40/40<br />
<br />
Element: Leaf, Blood<br />
Information:  The ultimate result of the mad scientist&#39;s rab-bat experiments,  a once good man was turned into a bloodthirsty were-beast.  Now he is cursed to take this form every night, and to fall into an uncontrollable blood lust at the sight of humans, and so must live in the wild away from civilization<br />
:::<br />
<br />
Then he spoke!  &quot;Greetings, succubus.&quot;  Lillian reasoned that she must not qualify as a human, at least not while in this form. She couldn&#39;t change back, then.  That wasn&#39;t good.  She shouldn&#39;t spend so much time in this form.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello.&quot;  she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have become aware of your slaughter of the rab-bats.  They are innocent creatures, warped by a human monster.  You must stop immediately.  If you will agree to spare them, then I will spare you.  If not, we must do battle.&quot;<br />
<br />
She pondered.  She had no MP left, so the battle would come entirely down to whether her last charm skill could affect a higher level boss or not.  He did have some MP, so he wasn&#39;t a total meat-head and might have some resistance.  The charm spell would of course require her to be raped again, but her demon half was growing stronger, and it didn&#39;t care.  Killing a boss monster might have some great rewards.</p>
