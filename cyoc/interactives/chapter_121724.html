<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It was Sunday morning and Danny obviously wouldn&#39;t be busy, thought Jeff. Jeff&#39;s parents were away for the weekend and his sister Kara spent all day in her room. He knew he had to share this amazing invention with somebody.<br />
<br />
Still feeling the after effects of his last orgasm, Jeff touched a hand to his scrotum and gently played with it as he stared at the Chronivac. He wanted to see what Danny thought of all this. Danny would totally hate what Jeff had done with his body, of course, but he would have some good ideas about what else to do.<br />
<br />
Jeff grabbed his cell phone and texted Danny: <br />
<br />
you need to come over right now. cant text about it so drop whatever you&#39;re doing. this is important<br />
&gt;Send<br />
<br />
Well, that was it, he thought. His exciting secret would soon involve his best friend.<br />
<br />
While he waited for Danny to walk over, he suddenly realized his bladder was full. Cool! He was pretty excited to pee out of another boy&#39;s dick. He grabbed his ill-fitting boxers, pulled them over Danny&#39;s fat ass again, and walked over to the bathroom, putting the phone next to the sink.<br />
<br />
He saw Danny&#39;s reflection in the bathroom mirror, and again had to admire it in amazement. He rubbed his cheeks and his squinty, dark eyes. He stuck his tongue out at the fake Danny in the mirror. Again, feeling a weird excitement, he stuck a finger in his mouth, and then two. What was he doing? Did he just love watching Danny humiliated? There was something weird about it, something wonderful and cute. He didn&#39;t  have the words for it as a 16-year-old boy borrowing another boy&#39;s face, but it made him feel really wonderful seeing it. He made a sad face with his oddly handsome eyes as he sucked on his two fingers. He licked his thick, soft lips and kissed his reflection again.<br />
<br />
Suddenly he came to his senses. This was all too weird. He pulled the front side of his boxers down and pulled out Danny&#39;s soft, floppy penis. He pointed it at the toilet (which was higher than he was used to, given his new stature as a little guy). He felt the wonderful feeling of releasing his bladder and pouring a warm stream of pee into the toilet. He felt more comfortable in this body than ever.<br />
<br />
What is Danny going to want to do?, Jeff thought. Maybe he&#39;ll transform me into something crazy. Maybe he&#39;ll want to be tall and strong for once. Maybe he&#39;ll want to change somebody else.<br />
<br />
All Jeff could think was how simple this first transformation was and how infinite the possibilities were.<br />
<br />
He checked his phone—Danny had texted him. &quot;I don&#39;t get it.whatever.20 min.&quot;<br />
<br />
20 minutes alone in his new body before the floodgates opened. Jeff squeezed his balls a little, shook off the pee, and flushed the toilet. He realized this might be his last time in Danny&#39;s body for a while. What could he do? His soft dick was too sore to jerk off again. <br />
<br />
He decided to take a quick shower before Danny showed up. He turned the water on, pulled the boxers off and stood proudly in Danny&#39;s naked body again. After checking the water temperature he stepped into the bathtub. The water felt amazing on his soft, short, naked body. He ran his fingers through his wet hair. Danny had a similar haircut to Jeff&#39;s, but his hair had a much nicer texture and was actually nicer looking than Jeff&#39;s. Jeff had never thought about it before, but  it was obviously true. He grabbed the shampoo and ran it through his friend&#39;s hair. Then he grabbed the body wash and poured it generously over the pale, soft mass he now called his body. Delighted, he ran the foamy soap over his heavy, squishy belly, his thick, floppy dick, his pubes, his scrotum, and down his legs. He squeezed his weird boy boobs together and imagined they were a girl&#39;s. He bent forward a little to see how his boobs and belly all got exaggerated and squished together. His nipples felt so nice. It all felt nice. He ran a hand down his buttcrack and made sure it was nice and soapy. He rubbed his hands over every part of his 5&#39;5&quot; frame. Part of him really envied the old body he had, the handsome and fit 6&#39;1&quot; kid he was used to being, but part of him loved the embarrassing sweet face and short body Danny got to have. It was all too confusing.<br />
<br />
He knew 20 minutes would go by fast, so he quickly rinsed off and turned off the shower. He grabbed a towel and rubbed it over every part of him. He walked over to the mirror and looked at the slightly reddened, sweaty, wet boy in it. Could he ask Danny to borrow this body? It seemed ridiculous. The Chronivac could do anything. He could try a million bodies before settling on this one. But he felt an odd admiration for Danny he&#39;d never noticed before. This just felt right. And it felt disgusting and stupid, too.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll see what happens when he gets here,&quot; thought Jeff. He wrapped the towel over his thick, stocky body. He looked weirdly handsome in just a towel. But it was time to get ready. Danny was going to be here any minute and the game would change entirely.</p>
