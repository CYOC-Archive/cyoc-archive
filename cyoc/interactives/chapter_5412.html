<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I slept like a baby that first night. The dreams of girls like me being helped along by Jane Pennyford, &quot;The Great!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the alarm clock rang I opened my eyes to see of all things the Genie cleaning and straightening my room. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning Genie!&quot; I said still groggy.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good fine day my Master!&quot; came his reply.<br />
<br />
He continued to dust and sweep as I crawled out of bed and stumbled to the shower. A hot steaming shower made the world alive to me after a night of kooky dreams. As I looked at myself in the mirror when brushing those perfect teeth, a thought of changing me to be more radiant of perfect beauty came to mind.<br />
<br />
Scrubbing my red hair dry I walked back to the bedroom as the smell of someone cooking breakfast scented the hall. In a quick turn I went to the kitchen nook and peered around the doorway. There working about the stove was to my wildest dreams a little old woman dressed in middle eastern dress. The smell of freah eggs frying and bacon, potatoes, toast with butter, I was in heaven this morning.<br />
<br />
Turning again toward the bedroom Genie stood with a broad smile and standing on two legs. I said nothing but gave a smile of agreement and proceeded to enter the bedroom to get dressed.<br />
<br />
Breakfast was the best I'd had since leaving home for college. &quot;Genie, did you do these kinds of things for Drake and Ethan?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No Master, their desires were of sexual play as so many young men who find the powers of a Genie to be so thrilling. I believe that Drake this morning is working at keeping Ethan under his spell!&quot; smiled the Genie.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no more of them as cow and bull! I have regulated their exsistances to be of a better and more worthwhile use to society. Starting now we shall not bring up them and their sorted desires!&quot; I anounced rather abruptly.<br />
<br />
The smile on the Genie's face disappeared and he turned toward his lamp.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Genie please come here and let me be more kind to your kind and helpful ways.&quot; As he again stepped close, &quot;I apologize for being so stren, but those two idiots are gone and replaced by your great abilities with boys who will worthy of being men some day. I just do not want to make sport of the first Drake and Ethan as they are what they will be till death. Let us not speak of them and go forward to see who we can help along.&quot; I said and the smile returned to Genie's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh who is the cook in the kitchen?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She is a Genie of the blue Jin' she will cook, clean, and protect your home from all that would do you or it harm. Her powers are almost equal to mine but she must serve my will as a debt for her once having a sorted past.&quot; replied Genie.<br />
<br />
I wondered about the sorted past but thought quickly not to ask and begin my day at college. Finishing breakfast and thanking Dibras for her cooking I gathered up my books and tote bag for another day at college.<br />
<br />
&quot;May Dibras or I go with you to protect you today?&quot; asked Genie with a bow.<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't needed protection as yet!&quot; I replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;My Master, you are a woman of power now in the universe! There are powers and Princes of black powers who will seek you out to gain control over the lamp. Please, snap went his fingers, let this little fellow be my ears and eyes for you in your day.&quot; offered Genie.<br />
<br />
In the palm of his hand stood a silver dog attached to a gold necklace. I looked down at it and then back at Genie's face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please put it on, there it looks nice, now order Silver to protect!&quot; said Genie.<br />
<br />
I stood looking at Dibras and Genie smiling and said &quot;Silver protect!&quot;<br />
<br />
A funny feeling of something digging in it's toes and jumping away from my chest. Suddenly standing next to me and growling at Genie and Dibras was a full grown Mastiff dog. He stood on alert, his teeth showing and glarring at the two genies.<br />
<br />
Softly I placed my hand on his head and he looked up at me, tongue lolling out of his mouth and seemingly at peace with the world, me!<br />
<br />
&quot;He shall protect you from all that might do you harm. The dog is on alert at all times, perchance you were attacked from behind. You need not call for his help, if someone attacks or causes you harm or ill will he springs to your aid.&quot; explained Genie.<br />
<br />
I thanked them both and opening the door went on to my day at college.<br />
<br />
Economics class was at best just borring since Mr. Stafford the instructor was about as interesting as a common brick. I'm sure he loved his subject but it did little for me! The class normally listened well to the sermon on money and how is flows, accept for Ralph Horowitts and Sean Koolie.<br />
<br />
During the two hour class their cat calls and nasty words distracted Mr. Stafford quite often. The professor's comments to the pair were not heeded one bit. I thought to call for Genie but decided to be myself and return to listening.<br />
<br />
As class let out Ralph and Sean burst through the other students as they ran from the class. Sandra, Phil, and Mr. Stafford were knocked to the floor as the pair of idiots took off down the hallway. &quot;Lucky for them they had not hit me or knocked me down less Silver spring into action and have them for lunch!&quot;<br />
<br />
A three hour window till it would be time for Science class meant a time in the student union hall and a break. The hall was noisy and full of smoke. I sat down at a table with some friends to converse about the upcoming football game this weekend. Our team was to play the State champions of last year and we wanted to cheer our team, so we made plans.<br />
<br />
BANG, SCREAMS, CLATTER, we all looked to one corner of the hall to see gray smoke and people scattering. The yells from students looking at their chests and pants as they screamed at Ralph and Sean. The two nimbwits tossed a firecracker into a bowl of salsa and stood to one side for the results. Laughing and hooting the two made a quick exit out the fire alarm door.<br />
<br />
Soon the screaming sirens of fire trucks was heard as the alarm door had been used. As police and firemen rushed into the hall every student was standing or on the run. I feeling no reason for worry informed the Chief of Police that the two idiots were of course Ralph and Sean. The whispers of others in the hall as I gave the names of the two to the police touched my ears.<br />
<br />
Science class done and a mile walk in the early Winter cold would soon bring me to my apartment and a warm meal.<br />
<br />
Suddenly like an indian attack I was surrounded by guess who? &quot;Yup, Ralph to one side and Sean in front as four others stood behind me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there tattle tale bitch we thank you for giving our names to the Police. I have here a present from Science class, a nice gijjer of acid. A splash in your face and no man would ever want you for anything but raw sex!&quot; Jeered Sean as he wiggled the open jar of acid about.<br />
<br />
Need less to say I was frightened, till I remembered both Silver and a call for Genie might be the time right now.<br />
<br />
As Sean drew his hand back to toss the acid and the boys behind me stood to one side not wishing to get hit by the stuff, I called out,<br />
&quot;Silver protect!&quot;<br />
<br />
Out of nowhere stood a 120 pound full grown silver gray Mastiff. Teeth showing he starred at Sean with obvious intents. Suddenly Ralph and two other fellows jumped to grab Silver from behind. As the struggle commenced Silver bit and sunk teeth into Ralph's flesh. As the fight got even more tense a crack was heard as Silver's neck broke.<br />
<br />
A dead Silver hit the ground. &quot;Now for you bitch!&quot; said Sean still holding his prize for me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Genie, Dibras, HELP ME!&quot; I yelled.<br />
<br />
Click, like a picture frozen in time they all stood unable to move. Out from the bushes came Dibras. &quot;I have stopped them in time so we can talk.&quot; said Dibras.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh good, they were going to...&quot; I started to explain.<br />
<br />
&quot;No need my dear, continue on to home and I will deal them their due!&quot; said Dibras.<br />
<br />
Doing as my protector suggested I stepped past a frozen in time Sean, and walked quickly home. I heard Dibras' voice say, &quot; Bad friends, brings bad luck! You boys are mine now and shall remeber our time together, I'm sure!&quot;</p>
