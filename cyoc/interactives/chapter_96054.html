<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ed and Jacob went to school and Ed for the most part didn&#39;t notice too much different though a few things were. <br />
<br />
First, It was a little harder to focus in most of his classes, except gym, which was much easier than he remembered and he found himself giving 110% rather than the usual 65%. Oddly enough, he felt really good afterwards. In more than one of his classes, the instructor referred to him as Mr. Platte instead of calling him by his first name like everyone else. It was unsettling initially. The first time it happened he looked to the door expecting his father to be standing there.<br />
<br />
During lunch, Ed sat at his normal table with his friends but there, and everywhere else he went he heard snickers and giggles from the girls, and caught more than a few stares. The conversation at the table was normal, his friends didn&#39;t treat him any differently, at least not that he could tell so far today. His usual meal was whatever the school lunch program provided, and normally that was good enough but today he was ravenous, ultimately getting three of the school lunches and struggling to eat it all within the time given. He was so desperate he even ate the veggies. <br />
<br />
One thing Ed noticed that seemed strange, Amanda, the prettiest girl in his grade, who Edward had a crush on since the second grade, seemed childish and uninteresting. In fact all the girls in his grade did. During one of the passing periods, some of the highschoolers crossed through the middle school section of the school. The school was in a crazy growth phase and although the administration tried to minimize the congestion, there was one passing period per day that middle and high school students would be in the halls at the same time. Sometimes Ed would see Jacob, so Ed quickly grabbed his books and congregated against the wall keeping a lookout. Ed usually would scan the sea of faces without issue, today however he couldn&#39;t stop staring at the young women walking by and had to duck into the bathroom without getting a glimpse of how his brother was faring. <br />
<br />
Aside from needing to masturbate mid day and everything else mentioned, the day was mostly normal. Ed also noticed that his focus was better after he masturbated, so his lack of focus in class could have just been that.<br />
<br />
After school he went home on the bus, something told him that in this new reality, he and his brother fought more and he doesn&#39;t get rides from his brother very often. Plus, the ride home gave him time to think, which oddly enough, school stopped him from doing.<br />
<br />
&quot;If Jacob and I are both retroactively making an adult amount of testosterone regardless of our current ages, does that make us both the same age biochemically? Will this make me go through a &#39;double&#39; puberty over the next few years? Or, will this take the place of my puberty?&quot; Ed pondered the implications of all these options. &quot;Regardless of whether I get one or two puberties, if I dont like how I come out of it I can just use my superpower, or dismiss this use of it... If I dismiss it from me after stealing it from dad, will it go back to him or just disappear?&quot; <br />
<br />
Ed reasoned that he will probably get this one puberty because he can only go from boy to man once though the timeframe of him being &quot;in puberty&quot; may be shortened due to his advanced state of maturation, or lengthened due to his age. As for what would happen if he dismissed what he had stolen, his father probably wouldn&#39;t get it back, if someone stole your food then threw it away instead of eating it, it wouldn&#39;t magically appear back in your fridge. He should probably return what he stole from his dad.<br />
<br />
Before he knew it, Ed was at his stop. The ride had been uncomfortable as the seats weren&#39;t made for a person his size. Collecting his things he bumped his head on the ceiling noting that he will need to be more careful, and departed. The moment he stepped off the bus a slight breeze alerted him to having his skin exposed. Looking down he noticed that even his baggiest shirt and pants now seemed undersized on him. He immediately pulled his shirt down trying to cover his midsection as the bus drove off. As it rounded the corner he let go of his shirt which exposed an inch of his flesh. &quot;Shit.&quot; he whispered to himself in a voice that still felt foreign. Walking home, the exposed skin on his back tickled and he scratched it absentmindedly until he noticed that there was something there. Grabbing it he pulled and his expectations were confirmed. Like his brother this morning, he now had hair growing on his backside. <br />
<br />
From waking this morning, till now, the changes weren&#39;t finished. this meant that he and maybe even his brother, looked older still.<br />
<br />
Getting home, he noticed his brother&#39;s car in the driveway. Going inside he called out that he was home and a gruff voice responded from the kitchen. Eerily reminiscent of his father&#39;s voice but off just enough to know it wasn&#39;t his. Entering the kitchen, Ed saw Jacob making himself three sandwiches. Normally that would have constituted as a meal but Ed himself could eat that right now as a snack and assumed Jacob could do the same.<br />
<br />
A quick glance at Jacob affirmed, Ed&#39;s hypothesis. Jacob had changed more throughout the day. Though no taller, he appeared wider, more solidly built. His face seemed to have lost what remained of its youthfulness and Jacob appeared to be a man in his mid 20&#39;s, fully grown, which fit with the shadow that had grown on his face. An adult in every aspect, except for experiences and mental maturity. Though Ed did recall not feeling the same way about his crush Amanda.<br />
<br />
Ed tried not to stare, as his brother inhaled a sandwich in three bites. Ed&#39;s mind and emotions were distant with his previous reasoning having been confirmed. Ed dropped his bag and asked Jacob to leave the food out as he had to &quot;hit the head.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Ed turned on the light he barely recognized what he was seeing. This morning he looked like he could have been 16 with more than normal beard growth, now he looked.. what would it be? 22? 24? He was well on his way to following in Jacobs footsteps, who looked like he should be done with college. It was a truly disorienting experience. Jacob started the day looking around 19 and now looks 7ish years older, I started at 15-16 and look almost as old as him... I think this is almost done and will leave us both as fully matured adults who can grow mature beards...</p>
