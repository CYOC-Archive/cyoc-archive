<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The kiss was warm and loving, though Trevor privately hoped that Melissa didn&#39;t notice the large bulge in his pants at the moment. As they pulled apart, he looked to her and smiled. She was beautiful. True, Melissa Jenkins didn&#39;t presently have the curves that even female weres that were their age had, but true beauty was deeper than that. And in a way, he couldn&#39;t fully explain what had truly drawn him to her. Yes, a lot of it was seeing that she had been alone and looked a bit overwhelmed at first, but it rapidly moved into something more than that. Regardless, it drew him to her and he was happy to have Melissa in his life and perhaps to be his wife in the future, and her commentary that she would become a werecow for him and would even want him to welcome her into were society did make him feel happy, but he could accept Melissa&#39;s wishes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t tell you how glad I am to have met you,&quot; Trevor said after a moment, &quot;It feels like love at first sight... I know that&#39;s silly and all, but it sorta feels that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... it can&#39;t quite be love at first sight,&quot; Melissa gave a small smile, &quot;we didn&#39;t start kissing in hallway when we first met.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor gave a small chuckle at that.<br />
<br />
&quot;But I feel much the same way,&quot; Melissa then spoke, &quot;it&#39;s like you complete me... make me feel safe... are fun to be with... you&#39;re smart... It&#39;s like I can see a very happy future with you. I can&#39;t quite put it into words.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two then nodded and looked out over the lake for a few moments. The water did look pristine from where they were with the moon light and star light making the water seem to glisten. It was a generally quiet moment that let them sit together. Eventually a question did come to Melissa&#39;s mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you say you come here to think... what about?&quot; Melissa asked to Trevor.<br />
<br />
&quot;It really depends on the day... or the issue,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;Sometimes it&#39;s what I plan or want to do. Sometimes it&#39;s family concerns. Sometimes it&#39;s school related concerns and so on. It&#39;s just a quiet place to come and think on...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa glanced around some of the trees that framed the small clearing they were in.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a nice place to be... quiet... reasonably secluded,&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;I can see why you&#39;d come here to think... even if it isn&#39;t a place where most people would think would be a place to find cattle...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot of people tend to think that,&quot; Trevor gave a chuckle, &quot;People think of cattle and think of either the great ranches and cattle drives in the old west or with some meadow on a farm in Europe. It&#39;s nice... but isn&#39;t entirely accurate. Cattle can live in more forested environments. In fact if you look at Gaur, a wild cattle species native to India and South East Asia, they live almost exclusively in forests.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm...&quot; Melissa commented, &quot;Do you know... have anyone becoming werecattle become a wild species of cattle?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That... I don&#39;t know,&quot; Trevor gave a shrug, &quot;Pretty much ever werecow or werebull in Moon Lake is based off of some domestic breed, but I&#39;d suppose that doesn&#39;t mean that some of that could happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa shrugged, &quot;Must be interesting to think about. Hopefully nothing is too troubling.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually isn&#39;t,&quot; Trevor commented, &quot;the biggest thing might be Anna Bell&#39;s first transformation... but that&#39;s more with my folks than with me as they make sure that things are ready and she&#39;s able to get through it reasonably well...&quot;<br />
<br />
Melissa looked a bit nervously to him, &quot;There&#39;s...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong, really,&quot; Trevor answered when he noticed her frown, &quot;It&#39;s just something that relates to puberty for weres and their first transformation. Unlike normal humans, weres don&#39;t enter puberty until they turn fourteen and regardless of gender they do so at the same time. Now, once it kicks in... it does so with avengence, but that&#39;s a different issue. However, that onset of puberty is what essentially triggers a were&#39;s first transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A rite of passage, sort of thing?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded, &quot;and it goes regardless of the were species. And it&#39;s here with that first transformation for natural born weres where things for weres mirror normal humans who join were society...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That first transformation is painful?&quot; Melissa asked. She thought she remembered seeing a young girl through a window when she&#39;d been up on the Tyson&#39;s farm and talked with Trevor&#39;s mother, but she couldn&#39;t be sure. The girl certainly looked strong enough to be Trevor&#39;s sister, but again, it was only a fleeting glance.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not quite as agonizing as you see in horror movies,&quot; Trevor answered, &quot;but it can be uncomfortable in the sense that the body is going through physical changes that it isn&#39;t used to... the development of new limbs, shapes, gaining muscle mass and so on. It&#39;s something that can be a bit uncomfortable than anything else. It&#39;s why we tend to use sex as a means to help with that first transformation or with a normal&#39;s induction into were society. That sort of thing helps reduce the uncomfortable feelings in the first transformation. And thereafter, the it isn&#39;t an issue. As we told you earlier... after that first transformation... turning to your fursona can be borderline pleasurable just by itself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I take it that&#39;s why you&#39;re not a virgin?&quot; Melissa asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... yes...&quot; Trevor answered slowly.<br />
<br />
Melissa could only shrug to that. It marked something that made Moon Lake different from anything she had experienced before, though she felt she was actually coming to accept a lot of that sort of thing. It had had seemed to get her father out of his intense mourning for her mother and it had actually brought someone into her life that she could see herself staying with for the rest of her life. Trevor was kind, handsome, and strong, and while she did wish for their first moment to be a romantic moment, she did have to privately admit to herself that she had had all she could do to not simply accept the way things had been going. She could feel herself coming to love Trevor that much, and while she only had a normal human&#39;s libido, that didn&#39;t mean that she wasn&#39;t interested. She also knew that Trevor was a were and did have a were&#39;s libido. He had certainly demonstrated that he was in control of himself, but Melissa did have the sense that their first time... her first time... wasn&#39;t that far away.<br />
<br />
Melissa calmly looked over to the bag of chips that was between them. It was a small snack sized bag, which was about all she could fit in the igloo when she packed the sandwiches and snacks for their picnic. She took the bag and pulled out the last of the chips and munched on them before looking to Trevor with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then... I suppose you&#39;ll be ready and know how to make things special for when the time comes,&quot; Melissa gave a small smile, &quot;It&#39;ll be loving... romantic... and not forced...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Trevor promised her, and kissed her forehead, &quot;because... I REALLY want to make you happy. It&#39;s with every fiber of my being... to make you happy and show that I love you. And when the time is right... I would more than love to welcome you into were-society and as a part of the herd.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And when the time is right, I&#39;d be more than happy to join,&quot; Melissa nodded, &quot;but I&#39;d think by now... we need to get going back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor nodded and the two were soon cleaning up after themselves, both with their hearts happy and even eagerly waiting for the right moment.</p>
