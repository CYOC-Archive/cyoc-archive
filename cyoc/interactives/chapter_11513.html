<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To your surprise, you find the movie theatre relatively packed. You choose a seat in the front row, not wanting to have your view blocked by someone else's head.  Shortly before the house lights dim, you notice that almost everyone else in the theatre is with a boyfriend or girlfriend, and reflect on the fact that you're quite alone here in the theatre.<br />
<br />
              Almost as if by magic, you feel a light tap on your shoulder, and to your left, you see a small brunette girl, not even five and a half feet tall, timidly looking at you. &quot;Do you mind if I sit next to you? You look lonely.&quot; You see that she's dressed in a movie theatre uniform, and realize you actually noticed her working the concessions stand when you passed through.<br />
<br />
            &quot;Sure,&quot; you tell her, quietly hoping that the other guys in the theatre will think that she's yours. She smiles warmly at you, sitting down as the lights dim.<br />
<br />
              &quot;I'm Dina,&quot; she tells you.<br />
<br />
              &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; you reply.<br />
<br />
              &quot;I love this movie; I think I've seen it about a hundred times,&quot; she whispers as the first previews roll.<br />
<br />
               &quot;Wow...that's a lot,&quot; you tell her, laughing a bit.<br />
<br />
              &quot;What?&quot; she asks, sounding a bit offended,&quot;it's a great make-out movie.&quot;  Her hand drifts over to your thigh, resting lightly on your leg. &quot;I hope that's okay with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
               &quot;Uh...yeah...that's...cool,&quot; you reply, dumbfounded by her directness. Dina pushes a button on the arm of your seat, lifting the armrest up, so there's nothing in between you two, and nestles in, resting her head on your chest, sighing contentedly as the movie itself starts.<br />
<br />
               You realize that her initial estimate of having seen the movie one hundred times is probably a little on the low side, as she quietly whispers every word of dialogue along with the actors. Dina certainly knows the movie inside and out, you realize.<br />
<br />
               She seems content to simply leave her head on your chest, casually stroking your leg from time to time, until a pivotal scene in the movie occurs. Onscreen, several men are preparing to transform into werewolves. The moon has risen. You feel Dina's body suddenly tense up, and she pulls away from you, seemingly transfixed on the screen. &quot;My favorite part's coming up,&quot; she tells you, smiling eagerly.<br />
<br />
               Your attention becomes divided, between the action on the screen and Dina, who seems to be becoming more and more focused on the movie. She begins to play with the top button on her uniform shirt, finally unbottoning it. Your attention is unavoidably drawn to her chest, which is heaving in and out, and even despite the thick fabric, you can tell her nipples are rock hard. From the pattern of her breathing and the general signs of her arousal, you wonder if she's having an orgasm.<br />
<br />
               The men on the screen have begun to change now, and you can see her breathing getting faster. The heroine (Julie Delpy) has just arrived to save our hapless and confused protagonist from becoming a victim. As she rushes him from the building, narrowly escaping the transformed werewolves' path of carnage, Dina looks up at you with a glimmer in her eyes, grinning widely. &quot;Here it comes!&quot;<br />
<br />
             You watch in astonishment as Dina undoes two more buttons on her shirt, baring her chest. Her C-Cup breasts are encased in a black bra, which she quickly undoes, letting it drop to the floor in front of her seat. Her chest is heaving in and out, and your suspicions are confirmed about her arousal. Her bare chest is covered in a fine layer of sweat. She tugs at the snap on her jeans, pulling them slightly open, all without taking her eyes off of the screen.<br />
<br />
              You get distracted for a minute by the person behind you grunting and kicking your seat. You turn around annoyed, ready to say something, angry at being interrupted. To your surprise, it's middle-aged blonde woman twitching furiously as her hand rubs her crotch, staring at the screen, oblivious to you.<br />
<br />
              Dina regains your attention before you can say something to the woman, grabbing your hand and sliding it down her pants. You bulge as your fingers touch the delicate labia of her cleanly shaven sex and feel her juices running down your fingers. &quot;Watch this,&quot; she whisper-moans to you, still staring at the screen.<br />
<br />
              You comply, still toying with her vagina. In what could be described as a pivotal scene in the movie, Julie Delpy has saved the hapless protagonist, but is now transfixed by the moon, and is revealed to be a werewolf. The banging on your seat grows harder, and you hear more thumping, from all over the theatre. A general low cacaphony of grunts and moans joins the thumping almost immediately,  simultaneously, and your row of seats vibrates from the frantic spasms of the couples to your left and right. Onscreen, the focus goes from the moon to Julie Delpy's face, as she can no longer control the animal inside herself. &quot;Stop watching that...and...watch...me!&quot; Dina says, in a deepening voice that mimics the onscreen she-wolf's almost exactly.<br />
<br />
              Your head swivels as you hear the voice, not wanting to confirm your suspicion. But even if you didn't look, you'd have known from the soft fur blossoming under your fingertips. She has an iron grip on your wrist, and is grinding your hand vigorously against her changing sex. She smiles at you, even as her eyebrows knit together and fangs begin to protrude from her mouth. Her eyes have changed from blue to gold, and a swath of black fur is blossoming on her milk-white chest.<br />
<br />
             In a massive surge of adrenalin, you manage to pull your hand away and stand up. The house lights have come up slightly, almost as if to give you a better view. All around you, all you can see is more transformations. The middle aged woman has fallen to the floor, shredding her clothing. Two punk rock girls are making out as they change, nipping at each others' breasts, necks and ears in between fang-filled kisses. A male werewolf is going down on a woman who isn't transforming, but she doesn't seem to care, instead saying, &quot;Change! Change!&quot; as she shoves her face against his snout.<br />
<br />
           You notice the movie has stopped, and indeed the house lights are on, but the orgiastic crowd doesn't seem to care, nor has it slowed the changes in the majority of the audience. You realize that you're in the extreme minority here; not only are you one of the few non-werewolves, you are the only human not to be fucking a werewolf. You see that a man has joined the two punk girls and is rapidly slamming one from behind, tugging at her hair as her face grows into the snout.<br />
<br />
            You look back at Dina, who has fallen to the floor. She looks up at you eagerly, almost pleading for you to take her.</p>
