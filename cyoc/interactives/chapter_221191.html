<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I could do whatever I want to do with you, Jeff. Make you my pet or a toy. But that would make you mostly useless. The same would be true if I made you younger than me, you would be more of a burden than, right Jeff? I could just get rid of you, erase you or make you a bug and then stomp you, but that would be no fun.” Jared thought aloud.<br />
Jeff stood there, silent, and frozen, horrified about his little brother´s ideas. What had happened to him to be so cruel? Or at least having such ideas, for his own brother to be the target? A part of him hoped Jared would do something simple, and then let Jeff move again. He could just delete Jared´s input, and make him forget the program, or, as he said before, share it with him. Then they could make rules to be safe. But it seemed his little brother had bigger plans.<br />
“I think you cleaning my room for me was a good start, Jeff. Let´s make this your new role in life. You will do whatever I order you to do without complaining. And as my first order for you Jeff, you will always do my chores for me. And as you already started, continue cleaning my room.” Jared grinned at Jeff evilly. <br />
Jeff´s eyes widened at Jared´s command. He would effectively be a slave to his little brother that way. His body worked on its own, nodding to Jared before starting to collect more laundry from the floor.<br />
Jared laughed at seeing his big brother work for him, and enjoyed his now free time to decide what to do next. “Let´s see if I really rule the world. I should be able to control others as well, then.” With another evil grin towards Jeff, he continued: “Your best friend Todd, your other two friends, Thomas, and Dean, as well as your twin classmates Dennis and Colin will be at our front door in two hours. Oh, and let´s not forget the bully you curse all the time, what was his name? Mike? He will also be there, but friendly for the time being.  And if this doesn´t work, I can still order you to invite them over, right?” Jared laughed at Jeff´s pleading face.<br />
“No, please let my friends be.” Jeff exclaimed in fear. Being his brother´s slave was one thing, but seeing his friends end up as Jared´s guinea pigs was too much.<br />
“Silence Jeff. I will do what I want. I already have a few ideas for them.” Jared said, and Jeff´s mouth closed shut, silencing him again while he continued cleaning.<br />
<br />
While Jeff was now forced to silently clean, Jared thought about changes he could make to him. He hadn´t lied, he had ideas for the friends of Jeff he ordered over, and even a few extra ones. But none was fitting for his brother, or the role he had now. Like he said, he could do many things with Jeff, but they could interference with his new role, or complicate them. It could be funny to watch Jeff try to clean while younger or smaller, but than it would also take more time. And a pet couldn´t work for him. But maybe…<br />
Suddenly, Jared grinned towards Jeff, and he felt a shill run down his back. That grin meant trouble for him, and with Jared´s power over him, that was really bad.<br />
“Let´s make a few smaller changes to make your work easier, Jeff, as well as funnier for me. For now, you will first strip off the rest of your clothes, and remain naked until I decide on a new “uniform” for you. When you are naked, your feet will change to work more like a second set of hands, like a monkey´s feet, but they will be robust enough to not hurt from walking. You will grow a second set of arms and hands about the high of your stomach, giving you a total of six hands. And you will grow a long monkey´s tail as well. But said tail will be strong enough to carry things like yet another hand, while at the same time it will be as flexible as a snake. And finally, because I want to be sure you hear well, your ears will turn into the ears of a cat.” Jared explained how Jeff should look, before he laughed at the horror on his face.<br />
Jeff was horrified. The tail could have been funny, and extra limbs weren´t that bad to try. But the way Jared described them? And running around naked? But he could do nothing as his body stripped of his socks, jeans, and boxers without any hesitation. <br />
Jeff´s feet felt like an army of ants was running amok on them as they shrunk shorter, while his toes grew longer and more flexible. His big toes moved more to the side, becoming the thumbs of these new hands. He also noticed that there suddenly were much more sensations he could feel from them.<br />
A sudden pressure built up to both of his sides, as well as above his ass. Then, simultaneously all three spots exploded outwards, as his new limbs grew in. Jeff moaned, but it wasn´t painful. Within half a minute, what had grown from his sides were a replica of his arms, just lower on his body, but in the same capacity of moving around. Each of these arms ended in a hand that was also a copy of his normal ones. The limb above his ass was more like a long worm, wiggling naked behind him, as long as his whole body was.<br />
A similar tingle than in his feet than attacked his ears, as they moved up to the top of his head, becoming naked triangles within his hair, but slightly towering over it. He winced at the suddenly way louder laugher of his brother.<br />
Jared took a minute or two to calm down again, while Jeff continued cleaning, collecting his clothes, and bringing them back to his room before returning. “You look good, Jeff. But one little thing, everyone but us two will think you look normal right now, as if you hadn´t changed at all.” Jared added, thinking about how other´s would question Jeff´s changed form. But then, he returned to his computer, ordering the chronivac over to be on his and not Jeff´s computer He also mumbled, so Jeff wouldn´t hear right now: “Jeff won´t be able to use the chronivac without my explicit permission. And even then, nobody but me can change his or my profile with it.” After all, it wouldn´t do for him to be changed against his will.</p>
