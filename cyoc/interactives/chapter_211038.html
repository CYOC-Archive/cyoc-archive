<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kat was a bit at a loss. She was happy Dan was imprisoned into an egg and at her mercy, naturally, but she wasn&#39;t quite sure what to do next. Something humiliating, for sure, but what exactly? Dan had always been very prideful of his looks. After all, it was because he had gotten lucky with the genetic lottery that he was able to get all the advantages that he thought he deserved. When girls fawned over him and he heard how handsome he was, he smiled cockily and took it as his natural due. He used his charisma on all girls, even female teachers. Pretending to be a good boy through his looks allowed him to barely pass classes when he should have flunked instead. He knew how to wheedle his way out of trouble through his innocent-looking attitude and self-assured demeanour when he was lying through his teeth. Male teachers were more savvy but most people seemed to just believe his pseudo-mature behavior counted as being intelligent. Kat had never thought smoking cigarettes and weed, drinking beer, having sex and cheating and stealing counted as being an adult. Quite the contrary. Hopefully, he&#39;d discover soon that high school was just a phase and that staying cool eventually ended after the few years of college and finished by a stay in prison. But now, it was all different. Kat didn’t have to wait until Dan got his comeuppance in a few years&#39; time. There was no parents or friends for him to go to in order to stop her. He wasn&#39;t with his awful best friend Gregory. That jerk had grabbed her hand once at home and thrust it into his pants, right on his crotch. Kat had complained of course, but Dan had brushed it off, saying that his pal &quot;always acted like that with girls&quot;. Kat&#39;s parents had also pretended it wasn’t a big deal, arguing that making a fuss about it would only bring more trouble than it was worth. But don’t worry, Gregory, thought Kat, you&#39;ll get your turn soon. Dan had no one to defend him, and she was in charge. In the end, Dan was utterly dependent on the image he gave to others. Women, more specifically. He despised women but was extremely reliant on them. Like a little boy. He was a vain immature, after all. And then Kat knew what to do.   <br />
<br />
The egg was transported magically to a realm of fantasy, which had a jungle and tropical environment. Kat&#39;s magic made the giant egg appear next to a female giant ape who was munching on fruits before returning to her troop higher in the mountain. Startled, the female stared at it. It wasn&#39;t there a minute ago. She would have noticed! How strange. She poked it, wondering what animal could have laid such a thing of pure white color. And it cracked. Amazed, the ape saw what was inside with wonder. It was a baby! An ape! Even if it was unlike any she&#39;d ever seen! It was very small, hairless, with strange, big, flat, feet and parts of the body with the normal amount of hair. And he had no muscle at all. Compared to the young males, the youngest, even, he had nothing! Oh. The baby must be a little girl then. Didn&#39;t make her less strange, though... The baby looked at her and gurgled happily. She picked it up and examined her. Oh, that was weird. She&#39;d been wrong. It was clearly a penis and testicles she could see between his legs. She fondled his privates, wishing to make sure. The baby shrieked in laughter. Well, that was more like it! A happy sound! The female ape felt Dan up to examine him. Her fingers gliding on his skin and poking him everywhere made him shake in spasms of laughter. It tickled! His high-pitched giggles made the female ape understand things better. Of course! It was a poor malformed infant! Abandoned by its mother because he was so different! The poor, poor baby! She had none and here she found one in obvious need of help. It was a female born with male genitalia. A girl born as a boy. How peculiar! And the poor sweet love had further deformities. Oh, well. She had enough space in her heart for him. Or her. Her. The slight frame, high-pitched voice, absolute love and trust in the eyes, desires to snuggle and hug and pleasures at being tickled and pampered showed that it was a girl. And did she love being pampered and tickled! Her new baby squirmed and squealed when she pinched her buttocks and poked her tummy and armpits in play. And she twitched like none other when shew peppered her with kisses. And those flat feet were the most ticklish too! So many hours and days of fun! And that baby had the sweetest silly and endearing attitude than any she had known. She cooed and babbled and gurgled and clapped her hands in joy. It did not even protest when her new mommy slipped on her groin a diaper of leaves, moss and feathers. And when the ape cradled her, she snuggled at once. She even tried to suckle, the little dear! She was exhausted but she&#39;d fill her adorable baby with fruit purees and coconut milk, as well as the milk of other breast-feeding females. Her baby&#39;s belly would bugle and become paunchy and offer san even bigger surface for kisses and tickles. How utterly enchanting! She&#39;d teach her baby to behave like the perfect coquette and attract male by showing her buttocks just so. Males weren&#39;t difficult. They had intercourse together and were enticed by anything that looked even remotely feminine, let alone one as delicate and tender and coquettish as her baby girl. Bringing her male mate fruits and roots and grooming him was far enough to get a decent male. She couldn&#39;t have babies? No matter! They could adopt. Besides, it wasn&#39;t her fault she was born with the wrong genitals. Uglier and lazier females had gotten plenty of males. Her tiny slender fingers would be perfect for grooming and she&#39;d teach her new baby Coquette to be the best female ever, helping other females and making sure males turned their gazes towards her. She&#39;d make Coquette a beauty and a very popular one at that. Silly and sweet as she acted, it should be easy to train her through the years. As for Dan, now Coquette, he would never remember his life of before. He had the brain of a silly little baby girl and he had been bewitched to feel unconditional love towards the first female he saw when the egg hatched, of course magically transported next to this ape that only asked to mollycoddle her own little one. Dan had been reliant on women&#39;s looks upon him, now it would be his new mother&#39;s and males&#39;. He would be raised as a girl, act like one and feel what it meant to be one among stronger and handsome males. Except that now, he&#39;d relish it and revel in being a pampered female. He&#39;d be timid and reluctant to leave the side of his new doting mother but he&#39;d never see a problem with it or act like a macho male. The very thought would never cross his mind. And a he&#39;d grow up among giant apes, happy with his carefree life. A dutiful mate would kidnap or rescue a baby for him to raise and Dan would be fully viewed as a full productive member of society. No ape would care about his privacy being privates. He&#39;d collect the best berries and be the best groomer in the troop, removing lice and fleas with great dexterity. He&#39;d be the pampered, dainty and delicate tickle toy of the troop and the pride and joy of his adoptive mommy. He&#39;d have a happy and fulfilled life.<br />

As for Kat, she had a meeting with a certain Gregory...</p>
