<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Katie drove towards school she couldn&#39;t  help but sigh and smile.<br />
<br />
The meeting her and her mother had with all of their friends was a success. Tje two groups had finally had a chance to get to know eachother and despute some awkward moments, they found themselves to be quite happy with the experience. Katie&#39;s mom, Kellie, had left on a good note. The two groups bow planned to meet again soon, either at Lisa&#39;s baby shower or just before. Thinking of Lisa, Katie hoped that things would be quieter.<br />
<br />
Katie had heard of Lisa and Gloria&#39;s recent adventures with Lynne, one that almost saw Lisa become her unborn daughters twin sister. A trip into the future by a regressed Lisa saw the spell broken after Lisa was able to bond with the future Lynne. Although Katie had to suppress a giggle at the idea of Gloria and Lisa trading memories (including their relationships with Nate and Jason) she was happy things had been relatively quiet over the last couple of days.<br />
<br />
As Karie began the trip to her chemistry lecture she foumd herself mulling over events. Thanks to Future Glorias spell Lisa was due to give birth in late March or early April. The baby shower for Lisa was tjankfullu goimg to be held when she was on spring break. Katie and her friends would be attending of course, as well Kellie and her friends from the other timeline. While it would be dramatic and quite possibly emotional, Katie had high hopes that reunion between her mom and her aunts would go well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Off!&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie fell to the ground as she bumped into someone. She had been so lost in thought that she had not beem paying attention. As she brushed herself off and apologizing she paused as she looked at the person. A very handsome man now stood before Katie. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she blushed. &quot;Was lost in thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thats okay it was my fault,&quot; he said kindly as he helped Katie gather her belongings. &quot;By the way Im Josh, nice to meet you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Katie,&quot; she whispered slowly standing.<br />
<br />
Josh smiled as he handed Katie back her belongings. &quot;Ive seen you around,&quot; he grinned. &quot;Pretty sure we have Statistics together with Professor Stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie tried to wrack her brain as she tried to place the face. She had seen Josh around campus before, she just never realized how handsome he was. &quot;Oh yeah thats right,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;Sorry about bumping into you like that, kind of running late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No its okay,&quot; Josh said as Katie made her way towards one of the lecture halls. &quot;Hope we can meet up again soon, maybe grab a coffee.&quot;<br />
<br />
Katie felt her face flush as she stared at the Josh. Dark brown eyes, sandy brown hair and a boyishly handsome face with just the right amount of facial haor made her heart skip a beat. Shaking her head Katie tried to get a hold of herself, she was engaged, she loved Kellie. Quickly without another word she ran into the lecture hall leaving Josh outside.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicely done Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh turned to where the voice had come from only to frown. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan LeFay smiled as she looked at the attractive college student. &quot;Just checking in,&quot; she smirked. &quot;And I thought I told you you refer to me as mistress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry...mistress,&quot; Josh sighed.<br />
<br />
Morgan smiled as she now gazed at the lecture hall. She had been so focused on destroying the O&#39;Toole/Turner family that she was at her wits end. That was when she realized she had been approaching this incorrectly. Instead of going after the family she would use their friends. The question was who though, tjay was when she thought of Kellie.<br />
<br />
Kellie had already destroyed Lisa and Katie once in an alternate timeline. Wbile she had been saved and regained her adult memories she had still accomplished a reality altering event. Morgans plan now was simple, hurt Kellie and force her to once again destroy Katie and possibly the rest of her family. All she needed to do was make the girl feel as if she had been betrayed, that&#39;s where Josh came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Its okay Josh,&quot; she smiled. &quot;But remember that it was I wbo helped to give you the opportunity to win Katie over. I have used my magic to make you irresistible to her. As long as you play your cards right, you will have a chance to get that which you desire.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Still,&quot; Josh said. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t just appear out in the open like that. Especially dressed like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Morgan looked over her robes shrugging before waving her hand. Josh watched as the sorceress robes began to morph into a far too tight sorority t-shirt with a pair of skinny jeans.<br />
<br />
&quot;There is that better,&quot; she grinned. Josh frowned as he looked at the sorcress. &quot;Oh wait I know something you would like even more Josh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Josh now watched as Morgan began to rransform yet again. Morgans deature softened as she appeared to grow younger. Tbe t-shirt now transformed once more, becoming a simple blouse. In only moments Morgan had transformed herself into a clone of Katie.<br />
<br />
Morgan could see the look on Joshs face and smiled. The boy  was infatuated with Katie and would go to any lengths to try and be with her. Morgan would help him achieve his desire, &quot;I had a feeling you would like this form,&quot; she smirked as she held him near. &quot;Dont worry Josh, I will help you get your dream girl. Just do as I say.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Josh nodded, Morgan could only smile. Hopefully this would be the plan to finally detroy the O&#39;Toole family.</p>
