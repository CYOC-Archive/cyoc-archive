<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Three years later you're driving home from work when you come to a stop sign and something catches your eye. A naked man is climbing out of the window of the old McHinley lab. You'd thought that place was condemned, there's never been any visible activity from outside, yet here you see a disheveled skinny bearded man flopping out of the window like a fish out of water. You pull into the driveway, park, and pull your windbreaker out of the trunk to offer the guy. When the man see's you approaching he excitedly yells &quot;MASTER?&quot; and flings himself at your feet. You do your best to kick him away screaming &quot;back off you freak!&quot;. Afraid, the man retreats into the forest.<br />
&quot;Hey, what the heck man, do you need help or something?&quot; you shout after him, but he doesn't reply. He flops around in an uncoordinated fashion deeper and deeper into the woods until he is out of sight.<br />
&quot;Dang Hobo.&quot; you think as you start to walk away. Then you remember the time you found a Hobo's camp in the forest once. It was cool to see all his little treasures and stuff, it was kind of like an archeology dig. &quot;That bum wouldn't mind if I took a look around his little abandoned building. It'll be an adventure.&quot; So you climb in through the window and land with a crash. Some old monitors lining the wall broke your fall. &quot;Luckily nobody cares about this stuff anymore&quot; you think. Getting up your eyes are drawn to a console/table at the center of the room. Two more bearded men were sitting there, connected to all sorts of tubing and wires. They let of a pungent spell of sweat and urine. Their faces were covered in scraggly beards, and their muscles looked totally atrophied. It's impossible to tell how old they are, in addition to their beards they are covered by a thick layer of dust. It looks like they haven't been touched in years. Except for one thing. You notice their feet have been licked clean of dust, still wet from saliva, and a spot next to the two men was vacant and dust free. &quot;What's going on here?&quot; you wonder. &quot;What are they doing here and why was that guy so interested in feet?&quot;<br />
<br />
Desperate for some answers you decide to see if you can shake these guys out of their long sleep. Suddenly jostling them caused a small swarm of flies dispersed. The sight of their bodies and the smell of their filth made you want to vomit.<br />
<br />
Failing to rouse them by conventional means you seek out some kind of revival switch. Conveniently you find switches marked terminate link 1, 2, and 3. 3 had already been toggled. A shard of glass from some kids vandalizing the windows had flipped it. You decide to revive the two remaining men and flip their switches. All at once the cords and wires forcefully eject themselves from them and a soft distinct machine noise you hadn't noticed earlier seems to wind down to silence. The two men fall to the floor and start to awaken. When they see you one looks frightened and confused looking around, searching for something. The other feebly makes his way over to you and wraps himself around your foot. He bites your shoe and tears it off like an animal. You kick him. &quot;What's wrong with you people?! I just want some answers!&quot; He continues invading your space rolling down your sock with the side of his face, exposing your naked foot, which he starts to suck and hump. You try to shake him loose but he won't release you. The other, still looking nervous crawls over to you and plants his face directly into your crotch. &quot;That's enough!&quot; you scream, &quot;let me go!&quot;. You can't help but feel aroused. They are in total violation of your space, and you're never turned on my men's advances but these two are so skilled at hugging your body, somehow they don't even feel out of place. Struggling to remove these two freaks you wind up punching them until they let go. They retreat to a dark corner of the room where they whimper and moan &quot;master? Master?&quot;.<br />
&quot;Who is this master you're all so fond of?&quot; You ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be me&quot; Said a man standing in the doorway.<br />
Turning to meet his gaze, holding a sock in your hand and squinting into the light from the door, you ask &quot; and who are you?&quot;<br />
&quot;My name is Professor Diederik Hofstadter I have been owner operator and legal proprietor of this establishment for over three years, and you sir are trespassing on these grounds.&quot;<br />
<br />
at the sight of their master the two men lunge at him, one into his crotch and the other to his foot. The Professor Hofstadter welcomes them, and smiles. <br />
<br />
&quot;You're Dirk Hofstadter aren't you?&quot; You say in surprise.<br />
&quot;The college football star turned genius, I read about you in the news, you had quite a life turn around&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes you have placed me correctly, though I no longer go by Dirk, such is a name far too colloquial for a man of brilliance.&quot;<br />
&quot;If you're such a brainiac maybe you can fill me in on whats going on here.&quot; you say with a scowl,<br />
&quot;These guys are insane, and it looks like they've been here for ages.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is a fascinating story my boy, one I've never told a soul, but since you are now an integral part of it, I see that I must fill you in.&quot;<br />
&quot;Over three years ago I was a sports legend, I had everything I wanted and to wit, I was an utter dolt. As fortune would have it I was able to outsmart a man of more scientific persuasions. Stealing his machine, I entrapped his consciousness within my left sock along with the consciousness of a second in my jockstrap and that of a third in my right sock. As weeks past their mental capacities became my own, I broke into the world of academia, the man trapped in my right sock escaped, a trespasser awoke my other prisoners, and that pretty much brings us up to date.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're insane, this is illegal&quot; you shout, &quot;you can't keep people here against their will!&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you say I can't do something that I am clearly DOING, really it makes you sound like an idiot.&quot; he shoots back.<br />
<br />
You decide it's time to make an exit, this guy's clearly lost it. You head for the door, but it shuts in your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;There's no way out for you. You know my secret, and I need a new sock.&quot; He says, waving a sock in your face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw that!&quot; you say trying to force the door to open. &quot;I'm out of here, get that other guy back if you want a sock slave!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid that's impossible&quot; The professor said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And why is that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you see Brandon, the man who left, whom I enjoyed simply calling Righty, is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How can you know that?&quot; You say &quot;I just saw him a few minutes ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, because I it is part of my contingency plan. Should a prisoner escape he will be judged mentally unfit and detained in the North Peak Mental Health Clinic. There he will be sedated with a common sedative called Phenobarbital which will react with the Diazepam I've put into his system, killing him instantly. He'll never utter a word of this place to anyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Stunned by his calculating mind and worried for your life, you look around for an exit but find none but the window you came in through which is too high off the ground to reach from the inside. Deciding it's best to show show some resilience you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not like your clothing slaves over there, I'm not going to submit to you like that!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No no,&quot; he says &quot;Not at first, where would be the fun in that? You'll fight with every ounce of strength you have and soon you'll realize the futility of your resistance. You'll come to love your new position as my sock slave, you'll ravish in your position rapped around my toes, you'll crave the scent of my feet, you'll yearn to feel the delicate whirls on the sole of my foot. You'll be every bit as loyal as these two.&quot; He said with a wicked smile patting the head nestled in his crotch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think these two were so willing at first? Do you think they were volunteers? Do you think I asked their permission? Do you think I NEED YOUR PERMISSION??????? You will not be my slave, you are my slave NOW, you cannot escape, you're are only conscious because I allow you to be. you have no chance of escape! When you attempted to move my prisoners it released a batch of my fester flies that carry a small payload of complex neuron inhibitors. They're charming little things, you see, they injected you with these chemicals and you didn't even know it. The most precious thing of all is, all I have to do to activate them is clap twice. Clap on, isn't it brilliant?&quot;<br />
<br />
Your heart starts to pound as you realize the impossibility of your situation. If he's telling the truth there's no way out. He's though of everything. Your only chance is if he's lying. You have no choice. You rish him, and try to take him down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well&quot; he says as you charge toward him. He nonchalantly gives to quick claps and you collapse. You can no longer move. You feel a heavy sleep come over you. You try to fight it, but the effects of the drugs are more than strong enough to subdue you.<br />
<br />
You awaken to a bright light. Everything is a blur. You can't move.<br />
&quot;What's wrong with my arms!?&quot; you think unable to remember where you are. &quot;Did I get plastered last night or what?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then you feel yourself being lifted off a table. You're completely limp and helpless. Unable to offer any resistance to your captor. You Feel violated as a you're spread apart and sharp toenails scratch their way across your insides. You are humiliated, you are trapped. The smell is overwhelming. Nobody's foot could smell this powerful. You must have heightened senses. You can feel every detail of his foot. You can feel the exact shape of every toenail, the irritating prick of every hang nail, the unmistakable tickle of every hair, each toe moving independently massages you're insides. The foot enters all the way and you feel your band wrap snugly around his harry leg. You feel like puking as you shoot down through the air and land on the cold ground, the pressure between the good and the ground is tremendous. It accentuates every detail of his foot 10 times. Each step is a prick of pain and a flood of pleasure. You hate yourself for anticipating the next step. You hate your captor for what he has done to you. You hate the other sock because you know he is enjoying himself as much as you'll soon learn too. You know there is no escape. And begin to surrender mentally. It won't be long before you're as converted as the others. Your body lies on limp and naked on the table, you are Righty now.</p>
