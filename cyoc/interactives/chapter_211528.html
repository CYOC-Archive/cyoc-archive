<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A bright light and buzzing emanated from the machine hanging over the chair Jeff was strapped to, Jeff felt like he was in a microwave but it wasn&#39;t hot and it seemed to last forever before Jeff was being gently prodded to wakefulness by Dr. Walters. &quot;See, it wasn&#39;t that bad. Though I did mislead you, the next few days will be the roughest but you will be down and out for a few weeks. I didn&#39;t want you kicking, screaming, or jerking around. Would hate to turn you into a vegetable. Why am I talking? You won&#39;t remember this.&quot; Jeff tried to speak but his brain was still buzzing and the words turned to mush on his tongue. <br />
<br />
&quot;Go home, get some rest, and you&#39;ll feel like a new man in no time. Dr.&#39;s  orders.&quot; Dr. Walters chuckled at his own joke shoving pamphlets and Jeff&#39;s phone into Jeff&#39;s hands. &quot;You&#39;ll be fine in a few weeks, don&#39;t miss your bus.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff made it to his bus, and home, his symptoms only seemed to be getting worse by the minute. Dropping the pamphlets and his bookbag at the table he managed to make his way to his room before collapsing on his bed. His normal after school tiredness was replaced with complete exhaustion, which was only challenged by his growing hunger. The next few weeks were much like being sick, he was in a constant hazy stupor barely able to focus on anything, he slept all the time, and woke only to use the restroom and get nourishment. Unlike being sick, he engorged himself every few hours devouring any calories he could find and access quickly.<br />
<br />
This of course followed no schedule, he and his parents crossed paths, but despite their efforts Jeff wasn&#39;t in a mental state where he could  communicate with them. <br />
<br />
Day 4, at around 7:30pm Jeff noticed the T.V. was on halfway through his meal, he complimented his mom&#39;s cooking and asked, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you wake me for dinner? I&#39;m ravenous.&quot; His parents rushed to him, trying to evaluate his condition and mental state, but as soon as he finished his food he was nearly falling asleep and excused himself back to bed. <br />
<br />
His parents took this as a sign Jeff was getting better and were elated... until Jeff woke at 1am re-starting his newly improved hygiene routine showering, shaving, brushing his teeth, getting dressed, cooking breakfast, making a pot of coffee... then realizing he is tired and going back to bed, reminding himself to call out of work later.<br />
<br />
His wake cycles during the day started getting longer and his nighttime sleeping had fewer interruptions, a small snack or bathroom visit instead of a full meal and shower. It was a few more days before his coherence and energy levels held long enough for him to break out of routine and actually converse with his parents.<br />
<br />
His parents were prepared for this, they had signed off on it and read the pamphlets Jeff had discarded so many days ago. Jeff&#39;s wardrobe was updated as he slept, blue jeans and t-shirts became black jeans, polo&#39;s and button downs, the fridge and pantry were stocked, and restocked almost daily, and they had purchased an extra vehicle, knowing their son would soon be needing his own. They confiscated his phone and severed all ties with his friends as inquiries came in.<br />
<br />
Although warned, they were still unprepared for his zombie like state lasting days and thought for sure their son would be different and their son would recover sooner. They had re-read and tracked everything Jeff had done, stopping short of putting a baby monitor on him... though it was hotly debated.<br />
<br />
Then, one Saturday Jeff was up and acting like himself, his parents greeted him as they were instructed, &quot;Hey, what do you have planned today?&quot; and rather than a bleary eyed look of non comprehension he rattled off a list of goals. He&#39;d entered the final phase of the transition. This went on for another day or two until he was no longer napping multiple times a day, at which point his response after waking became &quot;I told you this morning, but I still need to...&quot; and the process was essentially complete... His hippocampus was healed and he was making new memories.<br />
<br />
His father ran to his bedroom and came back with a gift presenting it to Jeff, &quot;We wanted to give you something special for graduation.&quot; Jeff smiled and ripped into the package. It was a new cellphone! The old one his former friends knew how to reach was discarded and the number changed. It came with a new email address and Jeff would find he no longer remembered even what social media apps he used, let alone his old passwords or the email he registered them with. <br />
<br />
Who would he be talking to anyway? He had spent every waking minute studying to finish his degree early and aside from a few really wild parties he closed out, he didn&#39;t make any lasting friends... Not that he couldn&#39;t if he tried... He remembered being the life of any party he decided to show up to, getting drunk, and having some hookups with a number of people...<br />
<br />
Jeff remembered weighing more than he does now, but who can blame him, he busted his butt to finish school a semester early, just moved his life back to his parent&#39;s home and now needs to find a job and an apartment. Sheesh, his life was a whirlwind but he was more than ready for it, no wonder he feels a little out of sorts! In the hustle his ID expired and all he currently has is an ancient school ID from when he was 16. Yikes, talk about a blast from the past! Thankfully he just got a letter to renew his ID, and it says all he has to do is bring a parent or guardian, any picture ID, and a new ID can be issued. Weird requirements but with the move, it&#39;ll be the fastest.</p>
