<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">To Maria’s surprise, Christine had written on her paper, “Anything that anyone writes about that affects me will be fired back and them and used towards them other than me,” I guess she shouldn’t have been surprised by the self centred girl using the pen so she didn’t have to deal with anything (not like she deals with any real problems).<br />
<br />
Maria, unfortunately only realised this after she wrote it down.<br />
<br />
As soon as her hand left the paper, the pen felt as if it was pushing against the tips of Maria’s fingers, but in reality her fingers were pushing against the pen. They kept gaining mass until her hand started to become fatter, it kept building mass, and then like an infection the fat began to climb its way up her arm, by this time, Maria had only just noticed it starting to happen and worked out that her curse backfired on her, she was wearing a sleeveless, stretchy fabric, school shirt, as her arm gained more mass and fat, it spread like a pool of putty onto the table and jiggled so much that when Maria lifted her arm up, it flapped around her arm, it continued up her arm and got to her armpit, which couldn’t be seen due to the giant bingo wings that flopped down one third of the side of her body.<br />
<br />
As the cascade of fat kept travelling up her body, it reached her shoulder, which gained its fair share of mass too, it started to travel from one shoulder to shoulder but spread everywhere else in doing so. Maria’s neck started to disappear, it pushed forward and her chin began to double with the rolls that would formerly be known as her neck, it broke the top of her shirt, only being held on by a few strings, that broke when she to move her head, her cheeks pushed out, she said to herself, “what the hell do I do no..” stopped by her cheeks shoving newly formed fat into her face, she struggled to talk.<br />
<br />
At the same time as her face began to gain fat, the fat had spread down her torso, her nice B cup chest started to get bigger, from a B to a C in about 5 seconds, which pushed against the shirt, not enough to break it, but it was very noticeable, it also gave time for her stomach to expand, it went from a nice flat part of her to Ann expanding mountain of a belly, it kept expanding and growing, blowing her up like a water ballon, it pushed her backwards from the table due to how big she was getting. Her fitting shirt stayed in its same position but a gigantic hole grew through where her stomach grew bigger. She grew forwards but also around, her back started to gain a generous amount of mass, but her sides gained lots of mass and due to gravity, it and her stomach started to pull towards the floor, her breasts were till growing but at a much slower rate, after her stomach had reached its limit, which resulted in breaking most of the buttons on her shirtswhich was as big as the largest girl in the class, rephrase that to second largest now, who was only slightly overweight, but not obese, her breasts grew over it, like lava from a volcano, they slowly sludge over the giant boulder of a stomach, they reached their end at a KK cup, and broke a large hole in between her breasts, showing a lot of cleavage, which slightly seeped through the hole.<br />
<br />
Next was her butt which gained a huge amount of weight, bigger than her breasts, it started with her hips getting as wide as her legs used to be long, that broke sides of her tights, which in her one of many chairs in the room with armrests, got her completely stuck. Her weight was too much to lift up anyway so she couldn’t even get up normally, the wooden chair began to crack under her immense weight, you could hear it. But before it could break under her weight, her butt pushed outwards and using her hips as help it broke the back of the chair off, which pulled off the armrests, so she was freed from it, but the chair, or stool now, broke under her weight.<br />
<br />
While laying face first on the floor, her thighs gained lots of fat and broke the sides of her tights completely, only being held by a few small strings, and pushed her legs off floor while also pooling around her legs, her feet in her shoes broke them and resulted in red marks on her feet, but were afterwards covered with more fat. During that happening her left arm went through the same thing that happened to her right, but in a different direction.<br />
<br />
Everyone had witnessed what had happened, Christine thought it was hilarious and started laughing directly at her, some of the other girls that Maria might call friends helped her up, and after Maria worked out how to keep her balance, relatively okay, she had to spend a whole day as a the biggest girl in the entire school, she even got stuck two doorways.<br />
<br />
“Tomorrow,” Maria thought, “Tomorrow I’ll get Christine Anders.”</p>
