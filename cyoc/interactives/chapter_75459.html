<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff looked at the Age option and finds it quite interesting.  Changing his age into anything he wants is quite fascinating.  He could either be an old person or a baby whenever he wants and he can return himself to normal.  He wants to try this out.  But what age does he want to be is the question.  He could relive his childhood, but it would be hard getting use to.  So he decided on the older option.  Jeff always wondered what he would look like when he’s older and this age option would give him a peek into his future.  But if he wants to experience what it would be like older, he has to go all the way.  Meaning, he needs to be an elderly person.<br />
<br />
Taking a look at his options, Jeff started with the age he wanted to be.  The think is that he doesn’t want to get too old or it would kill him.  So thinking this through, he decided to change his age to eighty-five, somewhere close to elderly.  Next option is the duration of the change.  Jeff wants it to be a slow change so he see his aging body.  So with that thought in mind, he set the duration for ten minutes.  Next is whether to alter reality, age mentally, or clothes change to the appropriate age.  Though he wants to give them a try, he decided not to.  Though they might be fun, it would be wise to just stick with aging and see if he wants to try out the other options.  As far as returning himself back to normal when he feels like it, Jeff decided to do that manually and not set it on a timer.  He wants to experience what it would be like as an adult without having his time up.  So he selected no for the time to return option and would change back to his old age when he feels like it.  He went back to skim his options just to make sure he didn’t make any mistakes.  Once everything is in order, and clicked on the button to begin the transformation.<br />
<br />
The moment he clicked on it, he waited for the changes to happen.  As he was waiting, his body started to tingle as warmth spread over him.  Feeling that, he knew that the changes have started.  As he kept waiting, he started to feel a little taller and a little muscular.  He could even feel his clothes getting a little tighter too as it constricted his movements.  Looking at his arms, he could see that they were adding a little muscle mass to them as small hairs was poking out of it. Jeff slowly got up and headed to the mirror to see the changes progressing himself.  What he saw was truly amazing.  He looked two years older, like eighteen and made him look like a complete adult.  He could even see his face maturing as well.  His jaw line was a little broader and he could see stubble on his chin.  He watched on as his body grew incredibly in age.<br />
<br />
He started to age past twenty and he was already seeing signs of this body maturing at an alarming rate.  He went through two or three growth spurts as his height escalated to almost six feet.  He could feel his clothes getting tighter as the muscles underneath his body start to expand underneath him.  The bottom of his shirt was rising higher as it exposed his slowly toning stomach.  He could even see the tears on the shirt and pants as they couldn’t contain his growing mass.  But his shoes were the worse of casualties.  They slowly expanded within his huge feet as the laces untie themselves from the growth.  They couldn’t take the pressure no more as they exploded on the inside, exposing his now ripped socks.  His face grew older as well when more stubble covered his chin and his jaw continues to get manlier.  But the one thing he noticed was that his little package seems to be growing on him.  As his body was growing, so was his testosterone.  Meaning the older he got, the more aroused he gets to be.  It’s like his sex drive was multiplying by ten folds.  Looking at himself in the mirror, Jeff could guess that could be twenty-four.<br />
<br />
He then decided to show off as he flexed his new muscles.  But doing that caused his shirt and burst out of his muscular body.  Same goes with his pants as his squats tore the bottom hem up to his knees while the button and zipper opened themselves.  With most of his clothes gone, he got a good look at his body.  What he saw was completely impressive.  His chest hard as the pecs stacked out the most.  His stomach was completely flat with a set of hard six-pack abs.  His arms and legs look really strong and have huge biceps and triceps.  To top it off, a think coating of hair covered his arms, legs, chest, and stomach.  His face was less like a boy and more like a grown up.  The jaw line made him look professional as the stubble spread around his mouth, forming a small beard.  Not to mention his penis was poking up out of the top of his incredibly tight boxers.  Jeff looked to be twenty-eight now and still growing.  Though he looked like a hunk in his perspective, he wasn’t much of a body builder, only a medium size.  “Wow!  This is so cool!  Who would’ve thought that I would look like this when I grow up.” he said but put his hand on his throat hearing how deep his voice is.  It sounded so weird for him since he’s this age, but he liked it.  He stared at the mirror and wondered if it was wise to age to an old man and not stop there.<br />
<br />
As Jeff thought about it, he passed thirty and saw signs that his body was starting to whither.  His muscles looked a tab soft but still remained tone.  No to mention that more hair continues to spread throughout his body, covering up his muscles bit by bit.  He took a closer look at the mirror to see any changes there as well.  That’s when he noticed a few gray hairs sprinkling on the side of his head.  He could tell that it’s the beginning of the aging process and had no choice but to watch it all go down.<br />
<br />
As he raced through his thirties, he could see the man that he’s seeing in the mirror dwindling away.  His muscles seem to be getting less and less pronounced as he could see a little flab under his arms and legs.  The abs on his stomach was slowly melting away as the shape was getting a little rounder.  He could feel more hair growing over his body as gray streaks appeared here and there.  His face was no different either as that too ages with his body.  Faint lines spread around his eyes, mouth, and nose while his beard continue to grow and expand.  In fact, his side burns extended downward and connected to his beard, making it a complete facial beard.  The hair on his head continued to have more gray dominating and making him feel less like himself.  But then another strange thing happened to his hair.  As he watched, he notices some of his hair falling off his head and floating to the ground.  He touched the back of his head and to feel a small spot there where it wasn’t before.  Feeling this, he knew what this meant.  Jeff was actually balding in front of his own eyes.  It was a shame that he was loosing his hair, but it’s a price to pay when trying out the Chronivac’s age page.<br />
<br />
He kept on watching as his body age through his forties.  He could see his muscles dwindling away and didn’t like as strong as before.  They were getting a little flabby and less hardened, but at least he still has muscles for the moment.  His chest looks a little bigger, but was gaining some fat in places around it, looking less like manly pecs and more like women’s breasts.  His stomach bellowed out a little more and looked as thought it had a beer gut to it but has some muscle on top of it.  His face kept on looking older as his beard looked gray on the sides of his head and his eyes looked a little tired.  His hair had a gray ring on the back and side burns as more appeared at the top of his head.  He could even see more hair falling on top of his head as there was a V shape at the front and a bigger hold in the back.  Jeff looked at himself in the mirror for a while and soon realized who this person is in front of him.  He said, “Man…  I look just like my father.  Sounds like him too.  It’s so weird…”<br />
<br />
As he goes through is fifties, Jeff could feel sore all over.  That’s when he realized that not only his muscles are weakening, but also his bones are acing as arthritis was kicking in.  His belly continued to expand around his sides as the remainder of his pants and boxers couldn’t hold it any more.  With one loud rip, he was completely naked with his dick still erected from the change.  There was body hair on most of his body, making him look like a bear, with a salt and pepper look to it.  His face kept on getting older as evident that his bread looked almost full and was more gray then his natural color.  Same goes with his hair as more gray dominated his original color while a few specks of white appeared in a few places.  He looked balder then ever as the hairline look less hairy.  Jeff was in awe at how much he was aging and he likes it.  It’s a shame that the body he used to have at his twenties is almost gone, but he can use the Chronivac to return to his twenties or to get back to normal.<br />
<br />
Entering his sixties, he could feel himself going weaker and thinner as he gained more fat then muscles.  His chest looked droopy and saggy as his pecs showed very little muscles on them.  Fat continued to grow around his waist and it looked more pouched on where his abs use to be.  He could feel his back aching more then the rest of him as his spine started to bend.  His legs were getting weak too as he couldn’t stand up any more.  Jeff decided to take his computer chair and sit down on it, making sure he doesn’t break a bone in his body.  As he sat down, he discovered that he is more comfortable sitting down then standing up.  As he was sitting, he could feel a sharp pain in the chest, but quickly subsided soon after.  It was then that he noticed a red scare on the center of his chest.  He looked at his chest and wondered if he had a heart attack and surgery during his sixties.  All of it seems strange to him.  His face had a long full beard that’s completely gray.  His hair was gray too and there was very little hair on top.  Starring at himself, he could tell that he was someone entering retirement.<br />
<br />
His seventies were fast approaching and his body aged more elderly then ever.  He started to loose weight and was getting skinny as bones were showing in some places.  His back was in more pain as it curved and bends for an elderly shape.  He felt his legs stop working as he could no longer walk or stand anymore.  But he didn’t care, as he felt better sitting down then standing.  Jeff was thinking that he would get a wheel chair for himself.  He looked down at his hands and was in awe at them growing skinny and skeletal as liver spots slowly begin to form.  As he was watching his hands, something strange happened to him.  He started to squint his eyes as his vision started to get a little blurry.  Ever since he was born, he used to have great twenty/twenty vision, now it looks like his sight is failing him.  He pushed his chair to get his glasses on his desk he used when reading and put them on to see better.  He looked back at the mirror and could tell that he was different with the glasses on.  But as he was interested in it, the sounds around him grew fainter until he couldn’t hear anything anymore.  Jeff’s guess is that his eardrums stopped working as he was completely deaf.  Jeff can see hair growing in his ear and was white as a ghost.  More white covered the hair on his body, beard, and head as the remaining hair on his head fell off, leaving him completely bald.<br />
<br />
By the time he reached eighty, the progression started to slow down. When the changes stop at eighty-five, he took one good look at the mirror and was amazed as to how the changes went.  His body was a little bony and devoid of muscles as the pouched stomach and thin chest was all droopy.  His spine was bent to the point he was slouching, making it impossible for him to stand or walk.  His was belonged to that of an old person too as he had a long white beard, glasses to help see better since his eyes were blurry without him, hairy deaf ears, and balding white hair.  Jeff couldn’t believe this.  For ten minutes, he went from being a 16-year-old teen to an 85-year-old elderly person.  He was bewildered about this as he said in a raspy tired voice, “I look so old…”.  He then looked down at his unhealthy stomach and saw his dick still erected, but it was withered and a little black.  Jeff looked back at the mirror and wondered what to do next.</p>
