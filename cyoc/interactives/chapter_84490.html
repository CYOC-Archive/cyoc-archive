<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Luke and his mother had a special relationship together. The 13 year old boy thought his mom was the most beautiful woman in the world. With her long blonde hair, her gorgeous blue eyes, and her wonderful smile, there was nothing he didn&#39;t love about her. There wasn&#39;t anything he wouldn&#39;t do for her, just like there wasn&#39;t any thing she wouldn&#39;t do for him. Jules loved her son very much and ever since her husband died when Luke was two, he was the closest person to her. Luke was a rather shy kid in school. He didn&#39;t have very many friends although he once had a girl friend once but she dumped him for one of the jocks on the food ball team. Since then he had gained a crush on a girl in his European history class. Clara Oswald, was one of the cutest girls he had met. She had dark hair with tan skin and had a Philippine decent. He would ask her out except for three problems. She was a lesbian, she was 22 years, and she was the new student teacher of the class. So there was no way it would work, but he couldn&#39;t help but think about her all the time. On Thursday night was movie night with Luke and Jules. Luke was laying on his Mothers lap as she rubbed his head. He told her about his day and about Clara. &quot;Don&#39;t worry sweetie&quot; said Jules. &quot;You&#39;ll find the right girl someday&quot;. &quot;I already have&quot; Luke said looking up at his mom with a smile. Jules smiled back at her son. &quot;I love you so much honey&quot; she said. &quot;I love you to Mom&quot; Luke said back. <br />
<br />
The next day after Jules dropped off Luke at school she decided to go to the mall to shop for herself. After she left the shoe store she walked passed a strange looking store with a name she was unable to pronounce. She had some time to kill so she decided to have a look. Inside the store there were a bunch of strange looking items that looked like they were from around the world from strange native countries. Suddenly the most beautiful Latino woman appeared from behind the counter. &quot;Can I help you find something&quot;? she asked. &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m just looking&quot;. Jules said. &quot;Oh but I think I can.&quot; said the woman as she came from behind the counter. &quot;You see, I can read your mind, and I can tell that you are worried about someone&quot;. &quot;Oh okay then!&quot; Jules said with a smile thinking that this was all a joke. &quot;You have disbelief in me&quot; The woman said as she approached Jules. &quot;I&#39;ll have to prove it to you&quot;. She said as she held up a small crystal ball. A mist appeared in the ball and Jules eyes widened in shock because she could see Luke walking down the school hallway. &quot;Who are you&quot;? Jules asked this strange woman. &quot;Someone who can help you with your son&#39;s problem&quot; she said. &quot;You have a deep love for your son and you would do anything to make him happy.&quot; &quot;Right now he needs your love so he can find love, and only you can help him&quot;. &quot;How can I do this?&quot; asked Jules still taking this all in. &quot;You need to make him come back to you,&quot; The woman said. She began to explain to Jules what she needed to do to help her son. &quot;Oh but I could never to that to my boy&quot;. said Jules. &quot;Yes you can, you must so your son can be happy&quot;. The woman said. She wend back behind the counter and pulled out a box of cupcakes and handed them to Jules. &quot;These have a special power to them and will do most of the work.&quot; She grabbed Jules&#39;s breast and began massaging them. Jules leaned her head back in pleasure as the woman placed information into her head. When Jules tilted her head back the woman kissed her softly on the lips giving her the energy to do what she had to do. <br />
<br />
When Luke got home he felt sad as he had a pretty bad day at school. But all that sadness went away when he saw his moms car in the drive way. As he walked into the house the sweet smell of chocolate filled the air. He walked into the kitchen find his mom putting frosting on chocolate cupcakes. &quot;Hey sweetie, I made you a special treat today.&quot; she said. that evening Jules watched as her son ate several of the cupcakes which made him very drowsy, so drowsy in fact that she had to carry him up stairs to bed at 8 o clock. Jules carried her son up to her bedroom and laid him down in her bed. She undressed him completely and then undressed her self and then got into bed with her son. She got on top of her and covered them up with the blanket. Luke opened his eyes slowly but weakly and saw his mom looking back at him with a smile. &quot;Mom...wh-what are you ...&quot; he mumbled out. &quot;Sweetie please trust me.&quot; Jules said as she kissed her son on the lips passionately. &quot;Every thing will be okay, mommy will make everything better for you.&quot; She felt his penis hardening and she rubbed herself against it. Luke rolled his head back in pleasure as he put his arms around Jules. He felt so good. He felt a strange energy growing inside of him. &quot; Its time for you to take you mother into you &quot;, &quot;You belong to me now&quot;. Jules said. She continued to rub herself against her son. Meanwhile Luke could feel the energy inside of him grow even more powerful inside of him. He felt pressure in his private as he started to cum hard. &quot;That&#39;s it sweetie!, That&#39;s it!&quot;. Jules shouted as her vision started to fade. When Luke opened his eyes he didn&#39;t see his mother there. He was still too weak to move but he felt the blanked he was wrapped in begin to stretch over his whole body. This blanked was given to Jules by the Woman at the store and was to be used for the next step. The blanket covered his head and finally his whole body was covered in this blanket. He laid there in complete darkness. He could feel his whole body shifting and changing slowly for  three hours. After an eternity the blanked opened and She fell onto the floor. Luke now Jules sat up on the floor. He had transformed into his own mother. She looked down at her beautiful body and smiled knowing full well what his mother had done for him and where she was now. &quot;Mom&quot; she said. &quot;yes sweetie&quot;? his mother said from her head. &quot;Thank you so much for this.&quot; &quot;You must know you will only stay like this when the sun is down, at dawn you will turn back into Luke.&quot; Until you kiss your lover.&quot; Jules had to find Clara. He new what he had to do.</p>
