<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You reached the park at 2:15 PM in the afternoon. Unlike the day before, it seems fewer people are loitering about. The old ladies that you always see are still on their benches, spreading bread crumbs which the koi fishes in the pond are feasting on. There aren&#39;t any children, nor people jogging on the pave walks. Based on Nathan&#39;s memories, none of his friends are coming until four in the afternoon. Like him, they have club duties after class. It pains you to skip your own responsibilities, although, you know that&#39;s Nathan&#39;s mind speaking. You don&#39;t really care if you skip. These club activities won&#39;t matter when you&#39;re in college in any way.<br />
<br />
With fifteen minutes to spare, you sat on the bench and fiddled with the &quot;Swap Snap&quot; app. Aside from the new &#39;Stats&#39; button, there is a new button that says customer support. Inside was a text-input field, like the ones you used to message someone. Knowing the app opened a can of worms you want to be answered. As for your first question, you asked where the real Nathan is.<br />
<br />
&quot;You are Nathan, you silly goose.&quot; The app&#39;s lion mascot said. &quot;Here at &#39;Swap Snap&#39; Labs, we recognize you as Nathan with the memories and personality of a 35-year-old man. Rest assured, you, our customer, will remain in control no matter the situation.&quot;<br />
<br />
Next question; What company does &#39;Swap Snap&#39; belong to.<br />
<br />
&quot;[You need Omega-class authorization to access this classified information]&quot; the mascot said followed by a beep. &quot;1 out of 3 authorization breach codified. <br />
<br />
One out of three? What does that mean? You typed your question regarding this inquiry. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you breached your authorization three times, your access to the app is immediately removed. All your memories regarding the app are wiped. Any mention of the app from henceforth will not be registered in your head.&quot;<br />
<br />
You&#39;re sure that you have a lot but you do not want to exceed these supposed authorization breaches. You&#39;re still having fun with the app, especially since you&#39;ve already grown accustomed to Nathan&#39;s body. On your way here, you have already gotten used to how shorter your strides are. You don&#39;t tumble anymore, nor do you bump people far larger than you. And you think that some of Nathan&#39;s skillful footwork from playing soccer is getting to you. Given more time, you&#39;re pretty sure that you can play as well as him. And besides, the park clock is ticking to 2:30 PM. You saw Finn, along with your original body, sit on their usual bench like clockwork. You saw them pick out their respective brand of cigarettes, and begin to discuss how shitty their respective works are. <br />
<br />
You approach the two but kept your eyes on Finn. As you drew closer, you caught wind of the smell of the cigarette you used to be addicted to. Fuck! The smell is choking you up. You can&#39;t fathom how you were able to stand the stuff. It reeks and clings to the air. Despite all that, you forged on. Finn made one look at you and he flinched. He didn&#39;t expect to see you because he&#39;s pretty sure that the app is fake. But here you are, beckoning him to come with you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know that kid?&quot; Eugene, your old body, asks. He does not recognize you. The app said he won&#39;t have any knowledge about the app and the swap, even if you tell him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I commend you both. This is one elaborate prank you&#39;ve cooked up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Prank? You know I don&#39;t have time for meaningless things.&quot; He&#39;s right. Of course, he&#39;s right. He&#39;s you. &quot;I think the kid is calling you.&quot;<br />
<br />
You called Finn, grabbed his hand immediately when he was close enough, and holy moly his hands are bigger than yours. Like your old one, his hands are thick with calluses from the back-breaking work of managing the company&#39;s inventory. Green-haired and cat-eyed Finn followed you at the back of a public toilet. Nathan knows this place. It&#39;s probably the quietest part of the park where he and his friends often hung out. Nobody would bother them here.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you in on this kid?&quot; Finn asked. &quot;How much did my buddy Eugene pay you to do this prank for him? The bastard&#39;s already broke and he&#39;s wasting money for this prank. Pardon the French.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re still thinking this is a prank? You and my old body already told you why this is not a prank. I do not have the money and time to do pranks.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Old body...? So, do you mean you&#39;re Eugene?&quot; Finn&#39;s eyes thinned and eyed you with suspicion. &quot;Nice try, kid. I do not buy it. How about you went home and do not accept a stranger&#39;s invitation to pranks? Jesus, kids these days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Seeing that it&#39;s hard to convince your buddy, you sought other ways to make him believe. And what better way to do that other than doing something 12-year-old boys wouldn&#39;t usually do. You pulled down your pants and removed your clothes. Your pre-pubescent dick hung between your legs. Finn could only stare in shock as you approached him with your dangling penis. You grabbed his hand and let him touch your balls. He was adamant at first but gradually accepted the provocation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you think a 12-year-old boy would do this kind of thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I- I don&#39;t know! I could barely remember the last time I hung around kids.&quot; Finn said with flustered cheeks. &quot;But yes! I believe you know, Eugene. Ju- just wear back your pants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t call me Eugene anymore. It&#39;s Nathan, now.&quot; You were told to wear your pants but you&#39;re starting to decide not to. Finn is still marbling your balls, with two of his fingers rubbing beside your peanut-sized dick. You squirmed beside him, as his rubbing became full-on jerks. He sat against the restroom&#39;s building wall and he let you sit on top of his lap. You moaned with gurgling cries as he jerked off your penis. Despite having your release just this morning, it seems you&#39;re already filled up. Mere seconds have passed but the walls of your dam have already broken down. You came on his calloused fingers and made a pool of your cum on his palms. You collapsed on his chest and cried as the last euphoric remnants left your body. <br />
<br />
&quot;How does it feel?&quot; Finn asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Amazing. This body is so sensitive. Touching my dick alone is enough to make me collapse.&quot; You said. You wiped off the cum with your handkerchief and wore back your clothes. You&#39;re all sweaty and tired. Your arms feel like jello. Finn was kind enough to help you stand up. &quot;You should try it. I have the app on my phone. I believe I&#39;ve already told you how to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave him your phone, &quot;PocketGoblins?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know the show? Nathan and his friends are obsessed with it. They can&#39;t stop talking about the games and the show. AH!&quot; You screamed as one last forgotten lobule spat out of your dick and into your underwear. You just hoped your mom would not notice it. <br />
<br />
&quot;My last boyfriend was obsessed with. So, about this app? You want me to use it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you asking? You don&#39;t want to? I thought you were quite tired of dead-end jobs we both have.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to do it. I&#39;m just surprised you&#39;re allowing me to use it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I want you to use it. But the decision on who to use it lies with you. Nathan- I mean, my friends are coming in about half an hour from now. You can use it on them. Or you could use it on my big brother. Although, I haven&#39;t met him yet since I became Nathan.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn held the phone in his hand. One click of the button with a red circle and he could escape this boring life as Eugene did. His co-worker seems to be enjoying his new life and he can&#39;t see any sign of regret on his face. Although, looking for the sign is impossible given his face is still pink and lewd from the handjob he made earlier. So, who did he take a picture of?</p>
