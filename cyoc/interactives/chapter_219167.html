<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“I am so sorry to here about Pava.” said Lucifer, he had left the breakfast with his family to meet with his friend personally in his own private garden. Sitting across from him was his old friend Beelzebub who have a sad nod as both of them sat across from each other.<br />
<br />
“My little girl is devastated and while I still can’t shake the feeling that she is somewhat behind this Iron Knight Threat I don’t believe she would have sent someone to kill Pava.” stated Beelzebub, knowing full well that he had been the one to unseal an ancient being of Chaos to kill his traitorous daughter’s former human lover. <br />
<br />
“Do you think your daughter is capable of such magic?” inquired a newer voice as Beelzebub turned to see a beautiful demoness, like her aunt she had someone gotten most of her angelic traits. Beautiful fire red hair, which turned out to be actual fire swayed behind her as she walked forward. Four pairs of wings also made of fire was folded up behind her back as she sat down. Her red eyes glaring into Beelzebub. <br />
<br />
“Ah…Izunami.” greated Lucifer leaning over to give his 2nd daughter a kiss on the cheek. “I didn’t know you had arrived.”<br />
<br />
“I just did father.” explained Izuname as she eyed Beelzebub with her burning red eyes and he eyed her back with his multiple eyes. “Had some trouble in the 8th circle, dealing with the Iron Knights, since we have some on the loss I put extra locks on their restraints.”<br />
<br />
“Good, that is why you are in charge of imprisoning newly arrived souls afterall.” said Lucifer as he looked at his daughter who was in command of every cell and the sealing away of every prisoner in all the 9 hells. “Do you think Cruciata is capable of doing such magic to hide humans from us?”<br />
<br />
“The magic to do so isn’t that hard and Cruciata is skilled.” confirmed Izunami “The issue is that like all magic it requires concentration and adding the spells capable of 1st hiding a demon from sight, to physically change them, to change their smells to hide them from both demonic and angelic scents are all easy. The issue is stacking them all and keeping focused. That is where I am not sure Cruciata has the skill to do so, at least for long.”<br />
<br />
“My daughter is very skilled, I wouldn’t be surprised if she is capable of doing it.” confirmed Beelzebub, Izunami had been totally correct, he had to keep some focus on the spells which hide the four Iron Knights but he was far more skilled then his daughter and far more skill then anyone else he knew in hell. For him focusing on the spells while not a pain or that difficult was beginning to wear on him, however he knew his limits and he could keep this up for at least a couple of months. If it longer then that, then he would have to find some trusted allies to spread the load. <br />
<br />
“Then why would she attack her own lover, seams to make me think that she isn’t behind this.” Stated Lucifer “Or at least she isn’t the one behind it anymore.”<br />
<br />
“I agree father, Cruciata is a pawn, not a player.” confirmed Izunami “She is too spoiled and that makes her easier to control.” <br />
<br />
“I agree as well, I blame myself for spoiling her. That fault is my own and no one else.” Stated Beelzebub as he nodded his head. “I have my own personally beliefs that the source of this attack comes from Heaven and that they are the ones pulling the strings.”<br />
<br />
“Kushiel?” offered Izunami as she named the Grand Inquisitor of Heaven.<br />
<br />
“I don’t have proof but that is my own personal belief.” Stated Beelzebub “I have long suspected that he has been the one harming the Iron Knights but my only proof is scraps of evidence.”<br />
<br />
“While I agree that Izunami could be the one arming the Iron Knights, he isn’t known to be that good of a user of magic and if it was a chaos being that had been released how could he have done that?” Countered Lucifer as he rubbed his chin. <br />
<br />
“If it was a chaos being which murdered my daughter’s soon to be wife.” countered Beelzebub<br />
<br />
“Isn’t she still alive?” countered a new voice as Beelzebub turned to see a cloaked figure, his long scythe behind his back and his skull face hiding in the shadows of his cloak hood.<br />
<br />
“She is.” Confirmed Beelzebub as he looked at the master of death itself, Thanatos. “However, she is near death.”<br />
<br />
“Near death is not dead.” Countered another voice as Beelzebub turned some of his eyes toward the other figure standing beside death. She was dressed if one would call it that, in a golden bikini top made of multiple layers of thin black cloth with edges of gold around her breasts. Her stomach was clearly visible a pair of black with gold trim harem pants covered her lower body as a lion tail moved behind her with ease. A small half cloak ran from her shoulders with the head of a golden lion over her right shoulder. Her make up was of the style one would expect to see in ancient Egypt which was where she had taken death to husband and ascended to something that was neither demon nor angle but something else. <br />
<br />
“Ah, Sekhmet, I was hoping you would come along with Thanatos.” stated Lucifer as he rose and kissed the hand of the wife of death. <br />
“You could have just asked Lucifer.” Said Sekhmet, who had once been a simple human Hut-Hor, well as simple as the daughter of a Pharaoh of ancient Egypt could be. <br />
<br />
“Neither you nor your husband are members of the court, it isn’t my place to order you to come or not.” Countered Lucifer “However I was hoping to talk to you about hosting the weddings of….”<br />
<br />
“Yes, we know and we approve, Juventas (life) and her husband is meeting with God as we speak to go over what they see as requirements and requests for the hosting of these weddings.” Stated Sekhmet as she took the lead from her husband, that was normal. “Besides, I would love to help plan everything, so where are the brides?”<br />
<br />
“I kind of do need to meet, my baby sister soon to be wife and my soon to be aunt.” Stated Izanami <br />
<br />
“Well then I will leave you all, I must go see to my daughter.” Stated Beelzebub as he stood. “She may be behind this, but she is still my daughter and I still have love for her.”<br />
<br />
“Understood my friend.” Stated Lucifer as Beelzebub turned to leave. <br />
<br />
“Say hello to my niece for me, I need to come and visit her sometime.” Stated Izanimi as she glared at her father-in-law Beelzebub. She had married Beelzebub’s 1st son who was seen as a disappointment by his father for being to willing to take orders from Izanimi and treating her like a partner. For her part, she and her husband both hated Beelzebub which was one of the reasons they came together in the first place.<br />
<br />
What Beelzebub didn’t know was that unseen by everyone but Thanatos and Sekhment multiple strings of magic were coming off Beelzebub. For all his training he didn’t know that when someone was concentrating on a spell a little band of magical energy contented the person constructing on the spell to the spell itself. This little band was invisible to both Demonic, Angelic and human eyes but not to a force outside of all three like Thanatos, Sekhment, Juventas and her husband. Worse still unknown to Beelzebub, they could tell that the spells had the scent of mortals on it for there was no spell or magical ability which could mortals from Death’s eyes and at least one of the strings was leading to a place nearby.</p>
