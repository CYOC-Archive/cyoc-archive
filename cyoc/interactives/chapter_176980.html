<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nick walked back home to his apartment with a smirk on his face, his hand gripping Joe tightly by the balls as he held the cock in his jacket pocket. Sam was likewise throbbing hard from Nick’s excitement and horniness. Throbbed and squirmed in Nick’s strong grip, rubbing his face against the soft lining of Nick’s inner pocket and drooling precum. <br />
<br />
Nick laughed and pumped the cock in his pocket a few times, “We’re almost there, buddy.” He said aloud. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out Joe’s phone to check the dicking app. Nick saw that Joe wouldn’t be human until almost 8 o’clock at night; he still had another four and a half hours to go as a disembodied cock. Nick had collected Joe’s clothes, his phone, and a large jar of Joe’s weed after the three of them had decided to return to Nick’s apartment and keep playing with the app. The three men, or rather, the man and his two cocks, were eagerly running through a list of other buddies of theirs who might enjoy playing with the app.<br />
<br />
Nick finally arrived at his apartment, closing the door and turning on the lights. He pulled Joe out of his pocket and plopped him down on the couch, pausing to watch the big cock soften and shrink up against its balls.<br />
<br />
“Its cold in here, Nick,” the cock said, seemingly from his cock-slit. “Turn on the heat man; if I had a throat, that’s where my balls would be.” said Joe.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I don’t wanna hang out in the cold either.” Protested Sam from within Nick’s pants.<br />
<br />
“Alright, alright…” he muttered with a grin at the talking cocks. He turned on the heater and went to his room, shedding his clothes until he naked again. Sam flopped out of Nick’s underwear, happy to be swinging free. He stretched and Nick moaned as Sam became erect in doing so. He gave Sam a few appreciative strokes. <br />
<br />
“I can’t believe I’m saying this man,” said Nick, listening to the dicked-man’s voice moan in the back of his head, “But I think I like you better than my old cock. I’m gonna enjoy having you between my legs for the year, Sam.” He gave Sam a squeeze and strode from the room, plopping down on the couch next to Joe who was beginning to grow hard again. He grabbed Joe and placed the cock onto his hard belly, right above Sam’s head.<br />
<br />
“There you go, buddy. Nice and warm.” Nick said, cupping Joe’s balls. “So, any other guys we know who would enjoy playing with this thing?” he asked the two cocks.<br />
<br />
“Nick you know we got some buddies from work who would love this shit,” said Sam, referring to their fellow cooks down at the restaurant they worked at.<br />
<br />
“Oh, man, and I sell weed to this guy who I swear is omnisexual,” said Joe. “He’s always telling me the craziest stories; this would be right up his alley.” He said, his body hardening at the though. <br />
<br />
“Alright, lets give it a try.” He dug through his and Joe’s phones, finding the requisite numbers and sending a few messages their way. Their buddy from work, Rob, was the first to respond. Rob was a few years older than Nick and Sam; he was a big, quiet guy who was usually at the gym or at home inhaling literature. He didn’t seem to understand what the dicking app was, but he was interested in coming over and told Nick he would be on his way. Joe’s client-friend was named Spencer. He did know about the app, but he was hesitant to try it. Joe relayed some encouraging messages through Nick, and within a few minutes the man was on his way as well. Nick sent them an invitation from within the app and tossed the phone over on the couch. He checked the clock.<br />
<br />
“Three and a half more hours, Joe. How ya holding up?” asked Nick, taking the big cock into his hands.<br />
<br />
“Feeling good, man. My balls feel so heavy; you gotta make me blow before I turn back again, man. Its so intense.” He begged.<br />
<br />
“Later, Joe. Wait till we have more dicks around.” said Nick, picking up the cock and getting up from the couch. He went to his room and put on a pair of exercise shorts and a white T-shirt; he couldn’t greet the guys naked with a disembodied cock just laying on the couch. He’d have to work it in gently, he thought, laughing to himself at the phrasing.<br />
<br />
“You’re an idiot,” throbbed Sam.<br />
<br />
“You’re a dick,” Nick retorted, hearing him laugh in his head.<br />
<br />
Nick sat on the couch, smoking a little bit of pot and alternately stroking Sam and Joe while he waited for the other dudes to arrive. His phone vibrated from across the room, and thirty seconds later there was a knock on the door. Nick hastily pulled Sam back into his pants and ignored the cock’s yelp of “Hey!” as he stuffed Joe under a couch pillow. He opened the door to see a slim, hairy, bearded man standing in his doorway, wearing jeans and a tight black shirt. His beard was thick and coarse, the hair on his head cut short and close. Nick didn’t recognize this man, so he assumed that it must be Joe’s friend, Spencer.<br />
<br />
“Hey, man. Nick.” He held out his hand.<br />
<br />
“Spencer. You a friend of Joe’s?” he asked uncertainly, shaking Nick’s hand.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, he’s uh…He’s in the bathroom. Come on in.” he stepped aside as Spencer crossed the threshold, looking around.<br />
<br />
“Anything for you, man? Beer?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’ll have a beer.” He said, striding around the room and looking at Sam and Nick’s stuff. “You buy weed from Joe too?” he asked, taking the beer from Nick.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, but we go back before that.” Nick said, sitting down on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Can’t believe he was telling me about that dicking app. I’m usually way kinkier than him.” Spencer took a seat on the other side of the couch where Joe was hiding behind the pillow.<br />
<br />
“Well, you gotta branch out sooner or later.” Nick said, feeling Sam stir in his pants. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, man. You get around much?” he asked, giving Nick a considering stare.<br />
<br />
“Awe, you know. Some girls, some guys. I mostly top. I just have my fun, you know?” Nick replied. <br />
<br />
“I hear you, man,” Spencer laughed, pulling out his phone. “Oh, looks like Joe invited me to the app.” Spencer started tapping around his phone, his expression shifting as he scrolled through the options. “Wow. Is this shit for real?” he asked, leaning back against the cushion. Though, as he leaned back he could feel something hard pressing against his back from behind the cushion, and he reach behind him to find what the stuck object was. Spencer was shocked however when his hands met something warm and soft, like flesh. He grabbed the object and pulled it own, shocked at the sight of a long, semi-hard cock and balls in his grip.<br />
<br />
“What the shit?” exclaimed Spencer, dropping the cock on the floor. Joe landed on the carpet right on his shaft, knocking the wind out of him if he’d had lungs. <br />
<br />
Nick slapped his knee as he laughed, “Damn, guess you’d find him sooner or later. It wasn’t the best hiding spot.” He admitted. Spencer put down his drink and picked the cock back up, holding it gingerly from its hefty balls.<br />
<br />
“Him?” he asked nick, before looking more closely at the cock. “Wait a minute, I know this cock. Joe?” he asked hesitantly, poking the head.<br />
<br />
“Yup, its me, man. And stop poking me in the face.” Joe said in a smirking tone.<br />
<br />
“Wait, you recognized his cock?” asked Nick incredulously.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” shrugged Spencer. “Sometimes I don’t feel like paying Joe for drugs. So I, you know, suck him off instead.” He said shamelessly. <br />
<br />
“Awe, dude. You weren’t supposed to say anything,” protested Joe the cock.<br />
<br />
Spencer took the cock by the shaft in both hands and rolled his eyes at it. “Dude, its 2020 and you turned yourself into your own cock. Get over yourself and just enjoy life.” He said, giving the shaft a few strokes and relishing in the feeling of Joe hardening in his hands.<br />
<br />
“How long is he like this?” asked Spencer.<br />
<br />
Nick checked the clock again. “Another two hours.”<br />
<br />
“Have you used it?”<br />
<br />
“A few times,” Nick grinned. “It’s a blast. You can even set it so you can be someone else’s cock, or they can be yours.” He explained.<br />
<br />
Spencer closed his eyes for a second before opening them. “Now that’s hot. Why haven’t I tried this sooner.” He returned to his phone looking at his options. Nick grabbed his own phone and noticed that he got a message from Rob saying he had arrived. Yet that message had come in before Spencer had knocked on the door. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Spencer, did you see anyone else out there when you pulled up?” Nick asked, frowning at his phone. <br />
<br />
Spencer was busy teasing Joe’s cockhead while he continued playing with the App. “No, I didn’t. But its getting dark out. Why?”<br />
<br />
“My buddy Rob said he’s here, but that was ten minutes ago.” He said. Nick kicked on a pair of flip-flops and opened the door. “Be right back, man. Don’t dick yourself without me” he said.<br />
<br />
“Hang on, man. We’re coming.” Spencer said, grabbing Joe and following him out the door. <br />
<br />
“Spence, where are we going?” protested Joe.<br />
<br />
“Hush”<br />
<br />
Nick scanned the neighborhood, spotting Rob’s Mazda across the street. It didn’t look like anyone was inside it. <br />
<br />
“Hey, Nick, you see Rob?” asked Sam.<br />
<br />
“Who said that?” asked spencer, looking around him.<br />
<br />
They approached Rob’s car; Nick stuck his face up to the window and peered inside, feeling both mirth and pity as he spotted a pile of chef’s duds sitting on the drivers seat of the car; Rob must have just come from the lunch shift. Nick opened the door and dug through the clothes until, sure enough, he extracted a long, heavy cock from within.<br />
<br />
“Damn, dude. That thing’s huge,” said Spencer, holding Joe up alongside it for comparison. Nick had no idea the guy was so well endowed; twelve solid inches and thick like a beer can, with a pair of heavy looking pair of sagging balls hanging from its base. The cock was uncircumcised, its conical red head throbbing as the cock muttered in a hushed voice. <br />
<br />
“Holy shit! What’s happening now! Why can’t I move, why does everything feel so good?”<br />
<br />
“Rob? Hey, man. Its me, Nick.” He said, hefting the big cock in his grip as they strolled back to his apartment. <br />
<br />
“Nick? What happened man? I was checking out that weird app you shared with me, I gave it a test run and next thing I knew I could move and I was trapped in my clothes. Wow, that’s bright.” He added as the men and dicks reentered the house. <br />
<br />
“Well, Rob. You turned yourself into your dick, see?” Nick held the cock before the long mirror by the door.<br />
<br />
“What the hell are you talking about? You can’t…” but his voice faded away as Rob noticed Nick standing in the mirror holding a large and very familiar looking penis in his outstretched hands. He knew that cock; he’d lovingly cherished it all his adult life. He recoiled from the image, feeling his cock body soften and shrink against his massive balls. <br />
<br />
“Awe, don’t be sad, buddy.” Said Nick, stroking the cock and bringing Rob back to hardness. “You’ll love it. Plus, its temporary.” He said. They returned to living room and resumed sitting on the couch. <br />
<br />
“Temporary?” spoke the cock. “So, how long am I like this?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Here,” said spencer. “I swiped the guys phone; lemme check…Haha, lucky you. An hour.” He replied. <br />
<br />
“That’s about the same amount of time left as Joe. So you guys should turn back at the same time.” said Nick. “You got lucky; Sam is my dick for a whole year.”<br />
<br />
“Wait, prep cook Sam?” asked Rob. “He’s your dick?”<br />
<br />
“You got a dude to be your cock for a whole year?” asked Spencer incredulously.<br />
<br />
“It was luck of the draw my friend. You’ve been warned.” Nick replied.<br />
<br />
“Can I see him?” asked Spencer eagerly. <br />
<br />
“Sure,” Nick obliged. He moved rob onto the sofa and pulled down his pants, letting Sam lay on his hard stomach in all his erect glory.<br />
<br />
“Nice piece, man.” Spencer complimented. “Damn, I can’t wait to try this.” He said, swiping through the app again. Then spencer’s face fell. “Oh, shit.” He said.<br />
<br />
“What?” asked Nick and the three dicks.<br />
<br />
“I accidently hit the roulette button and…whoops. Sorry, dude.” He said, holding his phone up to nick and showing him the results. Nick’s stomach lurched: somehow Spencer had started a two-person game, and the result was that Nick would be spending two weeks as Spencer’s cock. The clock began to count down from thirty seconds.<br />
<br />
“No way, man!” Nick was okay with being his own dick, but he didn’t want to be the dick of another man. Plus he was enjoying having Sam as his dick. Maybe he would have even been able to convince Sam to stay this way. But now Sam would become human again at midnight, and Nick was going to be the dick of a man he’d met an hour ago. But his thoughts were cut short by a beep, a flash of light, and suddenly he felt his body warping and shifting until he ended up crammed in a dark, tight space. He heard a yelp from somewhere up above him, and then something began rustling against the tight fabric that constricted him. Nick realized that he was in Spencer’s tight jeans, and that the horny young man was going commando today. Finally, a zipper unzipped, fresh air and light washed over his body as a giant hand grabbed his body and pulled him gently from his fabric prison. Nick’s body was soft and unmovable, his head pointed downward such that all he could see was the hairy chasm between Spencer’s thighs. Shit, Nick thought, I’m a cock again, potentially for the next two weeks. <br />
<br />
The hand that was holding him gave Nick a few experimental strokes and fondled Nick’s balls, sending waves of pleasure across Nick’s body. He became erect, looking up into Spencer’s giant, bearded, grinning face. <br />
<br />
“Well, Nick I was kind of hoping to get that buddy of yours hanging between your legs. But your dick doesn’t look half bad. Even thicker than my old one, I’m a little ashamed to admit.” He continued stroking Nick while looking around at all the disembodied cocks lying around him, at Rob and Joe throbbing and drooling on the couch together, and at Sam’s long cock lying in a pool of Nick’s clothing on the floor. Spencer checked Joe’s phone and Rob’s as well, seeing that between them they had about ten minutes left of their transformation before they resumed human form. So spencer kicked back and continued to give Nick long, slow strokes as he waited for the other men to change back and they could have some more fun.</p>
