<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A minor edit, but there are no white Siberian tigers. White tigers only occur with Bengal tigers.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Heather drank her Orangina, she paused a moment to say, &quot;This is quite tangy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Animalia and Orangina have quite a lucrative deal going on,&quot; said Steve, &quot;They have Animalians in their new commercials instead of CGI anthros and we get a good cut of the profit and Orangina to sell over here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was keeping himself busy in the time-honored barkeeper tradition of cleaning the cups with a rag. Not many of them needed such cleaning, but it did keep him occupied. His eyes occasionally went up to the stage where the zebras were dancing. He had to admit, they were pretty good and their black and white stripes reminded Steve of his Ava. However, when Ava was on the stage, she&#39;d put those equines to shame with her moves.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but aren&#39;t white tigers only found in captivity?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, leucism is a particularly recessive trait in tigers,&quot; said Steve, &quot;It practically only happens because of inbreeding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That must lead to a lot of genetic problems,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes. For starters, all white tigers are cross-eyed. And the lucky ones only have that. The unlucky ones have malformed muzzles and such,&quot; said Steve.<br />
<br />
Heather peered as closely to Steve&#39;s eyes as she could. &quot;You don&#39;t look cross-eyed,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wasn&#39;t born a tiger,&quot; said Steve pointedly, &quot;And thankfully the Animalia Virus corrects such defects like it did for Ava.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be your tigress, right?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right, you want to hear about how we met?&quot; asked Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it part of my redemption thing?&quot; asked Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not precisely, but I think it&#39;ll give you better clarity of how bondmates work,&quot; said Steve before he started his tale.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Ava here is a guest at our little zoo,&quot; said the tour guide as they walked by the tiger enclosure. Ava was in a separate part from the other tigers, namely because of how weak she looked. &quot;As you may know, while circuses are better with their animals than they used to be, there are some who mistreat theirs. Ava is recuperating here until she&#39;s strong enough to be transported to India and become part of the Project Tiger conversation program. Most tigers aren&#39;t so lucky and are unable to return to the wild, but there are plenty of retirement homes for former circus stars such as Big Cat Rescue.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve decided to stay behind at the rest moved on. It was pretty much one of those tours where you can join in and leave whenever you want. Steve always thought that tigers were beautiful creatures and Ava was no exception. Her white fur made her more beautiful than the others and Steve was only sorry that she was put through so much misery because of it. Still, at least it looked she was recovering nicely and regaining lost weight. It probably wouldn&#39;t be long before she was sent to India.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, Steve heard a commotion. He looked up to see several people running in a blind panic. Before he could ask what was going on, the crowd passed him, knocking him hard against the rail. Steve tried to keep his balance, but before he knew it, he had gone over and landing inside the enclosure hard. The impact was more than enough to daze him and for a couple of minutes, he was aware of nothing.<br />
<br />
When Steve became more conscious of his surroundings, he could see he had been brought inside somewhere. But he wasn&#39;t sure where. Just then, he heard a female voice say, &quot;I think he&#39;s coming around.&quot; Steve looked to where the voice was coming from and thought he must be dreaming. There were three tigers there, humanoid tigers. There was one male and two females. The male and one of the females was orange and much more muscular than the white female. Steve couldn&#39;t help but notice the large breasts on the females.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you guys real?&quot; asked Steve in confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;As real as you are,&quot; said the orange female.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you&#39;re tigers,&quot; said Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were always tigers,&quot; said the white female, &quot;But now we can walk and talk like you humans can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Apparently, it&#39;s happening all over the zoo,&quot; said the the male, &quot;Every animal has been transformed somehow.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And we&#39;re just as intelligent as the humans,&quot; said the orange female, &quot;I am Durga, this is my mate Shiva and that is Ava.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re the tigers from the exhibit,&quot; said Steve in amazement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think he got hit on the head harder than we though,&quot; said Shiva dryly.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s just confused,&quot; said Ava, &quot;I think you&#39;re crowding him too much. I can watch him now.&quot; Durga and Indra shrugged before heading out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this room?&quot; asked Steve, noticing he was on a couch and a few other pieces of furniture.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of the break rooms,&quot; said Ava, &quot;We brought you here after you landed in our exhibit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, thanks,&quot; said Steve as he sat, wincing a little bit. Apparently he hit the ground hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;We don&#39;t think you broke anything, but I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;ll still be sore,&quot; said Ava.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can confirm that,&quot; said Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, if you&#39;re not too sore, can you do me a favor?&quot; asked Ava, walking over to Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; said Steve, trying to look at the tigress&#39;s eyes and not her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, after I transformed, I&#39;ve got a very strong itch,&quot; said Ava.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can&#39;t you ask one of the other tigers?&quot; asked Steve, trying to keep his focus northwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a very...particular kind of itch,&quot; said Ava, looking a little embarrassed to admit.<br />
<br />
It was then that Steve became aware of a particular musky scent. And from his current angle, it was possible for him to notice that the fur between Ava&#39;s legs was a little matted. Steve&#39;s eyes widened at that. &quot;Wait, you really mean... Can&#39;t you ask Shiva or something?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shiva is already mated with Durga,&quot; said Ava, &quot;And I don&#39;t think she&#39;s interested in sharing. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re really interested, but I did hear you say that I was beautiful before, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve was a little conflicted at that. There was something a little unsettling with having sex with an animal, even if he had a humanoid body. But then again, Ava did have a particularly curvy and sexy body and she was openly offering to him... Oh, what the hell. He&#39;ll at least have something to brag about at school. &quot;I guess so, but I haven&#39;t had a lot of experience,&quot; said Steve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, neither have I,&quot; said Ava, &quot;But I think it would probably work better if I weren&#39;t on top of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Considering Ava was still a tiger and probably outweighed Steve considerably, Steve was quick to agree. He winced a bit as he got off the couch, he was definitely going to have some bruises later. As he took off his clothes, he could already see that his skin was turning purple in some places. He was a little embarrassed to be naked in front of a woman. She probably wasn&#39;t impressed with a skinny teenager whose dick, while fully erect, was probably not at the largest size. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not too small for you,&quot; Steve said with embarrassment.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not really picky right now,&quot; said Ava, &quot;I think you&#39;re at least enough to sate my needs.&quot; She sat down on the couch, spreading her legs wide enough to allow her wet pussy to stretch open enough to be seen. Steve gulped, hoping he didn&#39;t do something humiliating like cumming way too early. He climbed back onto the couch, carefully lining up his dick with Ava&#39;s. Feeling a little foolish, Steve pushed inside. He gasped in surprise, Ava felt so tight and wet around him. Ava let out a sigh at that and said, &quot;Not a bad start, I suppose. Let&#39;s see how far you can go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Starting to feel humiliated, Steve started thrusting. But surprisingly, the humiliation started to fade as he did so, being replaced with vigor. He was also feeling a lot less sore too. Unknown to him, his darkening bruises were quickly fading away as his muscles were starting to bulk up. Before, he barely had any definition, but now his muscles were becoming larger as his body was growing. He didn&#39;t notice until Ava gave him a surprised look. &quot;What?&quot; asked Steve, not knowing that his eyes had become feline or that his teeth starting to sharpen.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think whatever changed me is affecting you,&quot; said Ava, &quot;You&#39;re turning into a tiger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Steve before looking at his hands. His fingernails were becoming retractable claws as white fur started to appear on them. &quot;Huh, how about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re not mad?&quot; asked Ava as Steve&#39;s ears became larger and started to move up his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mad? I&#39;m becoming a tiger. There&#39;s barely anything cooler than that,&quot; said Steve, grimacing a bit as his mouth pushed out into a muzzle and his teeth sharpened. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t have a problem with that,&quot; he said, his voice starting to sound deeper.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not at-&quot; started Ava before giving a squeak as Steve&#39;s dick suddenly had a brief surge in growth, going further into her. It was also changing to have nubs that stimulated her more. &quot;All...&quot; finished Ava with a purr.<br />
<br />
Steve grinned before thrusting with more vigor. His body bulked up more as he grew fur, black stripes appearing as well. As his hands completed their transition, his feet were also becoming paws, his ankles lifting so now he stood on them. Quite soon, his new tail emerged from his back. He thrust harder, his larger balls bouncing off of Ava&#39;s hips. Looking down, he noticed the tigress was also bulking up, becoming similar to Durga in size. &quot;Looks like I&#39;m not the only one changing,&quot; he said, his voice even deeper.<br />
<br />
Ava smiled as she flexed her growing muscles. &quot;Does my mate approve?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;He approves very much,&quot; said Steve as he thrust harder than before. He and Ava let out louder groans of pleasure as they became more sculpted. By now, Steve has completely his transition to anthro tiger, only growing larger. Eventually, he surpassed Ava, though she was no longer small either. Finally, they both let out a roar as Steve came hard, filling Ava with his seed.<br />
<br />
The two of them lied on the couch for a while, basking in the afterglow. &quot;I suppose I should apologize for changing you so unexpectedly,&quot; said Ava.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; said Steve, &quot;I think I&#39;ll like being a tiger very much. If you don&#39;t mind being my mate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ava rubbed her head against Steve&#39;s broad chest and said, &quot;I would like that very much.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds more like your relationship is built off of sex,&quot; said Heather.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s a lot more to Ava than that,&quot; said Steve, &quot;She&#39;s pretty well-rounded, especially from coming from a circus. She&#39;s also a great dancer which is she performs here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can imagine so,&quot; said Heather, &quot;I think you were really lucky to not be converted by someone you didn&#39;t like.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think fate is a lot kinder than you think,&quot; said Steve, &quot;You might think you were forced into a situation where you had no choice but to change yourself into a monster, but I think Animalians are a lot less monstrous than you think. You might have a chance of finding a happy life if you learn to appreciate people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heather puzzled this over. Steve and Ava might actually have true love, even if they came together under odd circumstances. Love was a very unpredictable thing and it made Heather feel a twinge of guilt about nearly depriving Sophie of that. Well, hopefully the rest of this last punishment isn&#39;t too steeped in life lessons.</p>
