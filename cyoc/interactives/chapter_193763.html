<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">A mule...?<br />
<br />
Craig stumbled backward, looking slack-jawed at the anthropomorphic giantess leaning against the doorframe.<br />
<br />
She utterly dwarfed him, standing over ten feet tall on two broad ebony hooves the size of dinner plates. That tape had obliterated her petite athletic form, the girl he knew trapped in this bipedal animal, imprisoned in a healthy layer of equine chub along with a musculature fit for a work horse. Her lightly-browned skin from long runs in the summer was replaced with dark grayish mule hide covered with a thin brown coat that was glistening with oily horse sweat. Her head was completely unrecognizable too. Her splendid smile had been stretched out into an elongated equine muzzle. Two long donkey ears, flicked gently on top of her head while Craig saw that her gorgeous brown hair is no more - it was now a long bristly donkey mane.<br />
<br />
Craig felt sick. His cheeks tinted green as he surveyed the damage he’d caused to the girl he loved most, his eyes turning to where all men’s eyes naturally go.<br />
<br />
Her T-shirt and running shorts from earlier now desperately clung to her new body, stretched to width of tissue paper against her voluptuous form. Her shirt was hiked up around her now massive D-sized breasts like some sort-of improvised bra, the contours of her areola and nipples leaving little to the imagination. The elastic of her shorts visibly strained against her equine beer belly, the contours of a wet inhuman marehood the size of his fist obnoxiously pressing against the fabric.<br />
<br />
“Oh God, Kassidy. What have I done?” Craig let out a mournful cry towards the new mule. Her lustful gaze was kept trained down on him, her horse-like tail whipping behind her to and fro as she stood their silent. Her head tilted to one side, as if she was thinking really hard about Craig meant.<br />
<br />
“Kass-idy?” Her rubbery equine lips whirred, chewing on the name like a wad of cud, trying to process what each syllable meant. Her voice was lower but still feminine, presumably the sound traveling up her now elongated equine neck would cause that. “Sure. Has a nice ring to it. Is that what my name’s gonna be, Boss?”<br />
<br />
“N-no!” Craig stammered, he himself confused, “That’s what your name IS!”<br />
<br />
She smiled back at him taking another pause before answering. Her tail whipping against the back of her thigh as a little drool dripped from the tip of her muzzle, before finally opening it up and whickering, “You got it, Boss! Come inside, I’ll get you something to drink.”<br />
<br />
She wrested her huge body from the doorframe, her large hoof-hands clutching the wall for support as she trod off back inside the house. You notice she’s wobbling like a new-born child, like if she couldn’t lean her huge body against the wall, she’d fall flat on her face.<br />
<br />
“Wait!” You shout back her, “Don’t move! I gotta find someway to get you help!”<br />
<br />
Kassidy doesn’t seem to hear him. She seemed too preoccupied with navigating her huge lumbering body through the tiny dwelling meant for humans - not for farm animals. Craig watched her duck her head underneath another door as she clopped into her kitchen, so he finally walked through the front door to follow her.<br />
<br />
“Ugh…!” Craig blurted out, covering his nose. It smelled like a stable, the smell of her sweaty horse body was ten times more potent in her than it was outside. And it was hot too, a few degrees off from being as hot as a sauna. Was it just… her body heat making it so hot in here? <br />
<br />
In the center of the living room lies a coffee table in splinters, the ruined piece of furniture right in front of her TV. It was the video, but it was paused. The image of a horse and rider plastered on the screen… it was the video that changed her.<br />
<br />
“BOOM!”<br />
<br />
The house shook as Craig heard what sounded like an explosion coming from the kitchen. The man leapt in, only to find Kassidy laying there on all fours, tiles from the floor cracked and crushed into dust by the weight of her 800 pound body striking it.<br />
<br />
“Kass!” Craig ran to her, rubbing her shoulder, “Goddamnit! I told you not to move! Are you okay?”<br />
<br />
Kassidy starred blankly at Craig for a moment, her tail whipping against her ample equine ass before replying, “Mhm! The beer’s fine too. Don’t you worry one bit!”<br />
<br />
She was still clutching onto a beer bottle on her hoof-hand, she must have stopped supporting herself on the wall just so she could get him a beer.<br />
<br />
“Kass just forget about the damn drink for one second you idio-!“ Craig stopped himself, letting out a sigh before beginning again, “Can you get up?”<br />
<br />
Kassidy thought about it for a moment, wiggling her broad flanks, her ass jiggling as she tried answering Craig’s question.<br />
<br />
“Gee- I guess not, Boss.” The mule brayed back dumbly at him.<br />
<br />
“It’s Craig. Not Boss.” Craig shot back, “And… you really don’t know how to get up? This hasn’t ever happened before.”<br />
<br />
“Mm-Mm.” Kassidy shook her mane ‘no’, “At least, I don’t reckon it has, my memory’s a might fuzzy.” The mule picked up her front hoof-hand, testing her ability to crawl forward, her ears perking up as she faces Craig again. “You know, this feels okay, Boss. I think I could get by like this.”<br />
<br />
“Kass, I can’t let you go crawling around like an animal.” Craig sighed. She was way too heavy to simply help up, so instead he started tugging her mane and leading her back into the living room, “Just come on.”<br />
<br />
Kassidy was elated to be lead by Craig, the anthropomorphic mule following behind him like this was natural, not minding one bit he was tugging on her hair. He pulled her along until the pair finally reached the couch. Maybe if she’d just lie down, he could keep track of her long enough to think of a solution.<br />
<br />
“Here, Kass, can you get a leg up on this?” Craig motioned her to the side of the couch. The lumbering Kassidy lifted her arm and managed to heave her giant body onto the piece of furniture. The couch creaked and groaned in distress under her massive weight as it visibly compressed underneath her but in the end, it managed to hold the mare lying on her back.<br />
<br />
“Okay, okay.” Craig reassured himself as he paced in front of her, “That videotape changed you, but there’s gotta be a reverse; gotta be someone who knows who made this thing…”<br />
<br />
As Craig tried to think, Kassidy absent-mindedly brought that beer bottle still clutched in her hoof-hand to her mouth. She sucked on the cap until she finally managed to pop the top off with her bottom block herbivore teeth.<br />
<br />
“Aha! I got it! Here, Boss!” Kassidy spat the crumpled up bottle cap from her mouth, before holding out the foaming bottle to Craig.<br />
<br />
“Kassidy! I don’t want the beer! Don’t you realize there’s something wrong with you?”<br />
<br />
The mare’s childishly giddy demeanor shrunk away, the smile on her muzzle shriveled into a frown. “S-sorry, Boss. I just wanted to get you something for coming to see me…”<br />
<br />
“Kassidy.” Craig walked up to her, leaning down and looking her straight in the face. “Don’t you remember being human? Don’t you realize that horrible videotape changed you in a mule?”<br />
<br />
The mare looked blankly back at the man with a sad expression. She really wanted to tell Craig what he wanted to hear, but she just didn’t understand what he wanted. “I-I don’t think the tape was bad…”<br />
<br />
“It transformed you into an animal” Craig practically shouted at her, “It… made you stupid too, didn’t it?”<br />
<br />
“N-no.” Kassidy retorted with a little confidence as if Craig finally asked her something she knew. “Maybe I’m not great at some stuff, but I’m really smart when it comes to others.”<br />
<br />
“Oh yeah? Like what?”<br />
<br />
Kassidy’s glassy equine eyes starred at Craig for a moment as she thought. In a sudden swift motion the mare grabbed his arm, yanking him down on top of her, almost dislocating his shoulder in the process.&#8232; Craig coughed and gasped against her sleek, sweaty mule hide, his face pressed right underneath her pendulous breasts, mammaries obnoxiously bouncing on his head as she hugged his body tight against hers. His whole body was cradled on top of hers, human skin rubbing awkwardly against her supple beast flesh.<br />
<br />
“Look at the screen!” Kassidy requested, pointing towards that paused image of a person riding on top of a horse. “The video told me that’s called horseback riding! It’s sorta like what we’re doing now, except you’d be on my back!”<br />
<br />
Kassidy’s hoof-hands roughly stroked Craigs back, the mare waiting for the man to respond to this new information. “Of course I know what horseback riding is… but you’re not a horse, Kass…” Craig mumbled into her fur, as he tried feebly to wrest himself from the cage of equine flesh.<br />
<br />
“Wow, you do know a whole lot, boss! And I know I’m not a horse… I’m a mule!” Kassidy smiled, rewarding Craig by hugging him even harder against her, “But there’s a whole lot more too. The tape told me that mules were meant for helping humans, doing hard work and treating their owners to long rides too.” Kassidy’s voice purred as she shifted a little, her chubby body conforming to Craig’s weight like memory foam as the pair repositioned into a more cozy position. “It told me how nice it is to be owned by a kind boss like you, how nice it felt to be touched and petted, how nice your weight on top of me would feel.”<br />
<br />
The room became silent for a pregnant moment, all that Craig could hear was the beating of her huge equine heart as she held him in place against her lush body. Her head arched down, huffing warm puffs of breath into his hair as her rubbery lips traced the tip of his ear. “And it was right.” She whispered.<br />
<br />
Craig groaned as the most shameful erection of his life rubbed up against her chubby belly. This was so wrong… she was an animal and she was brainwashed.<br />
<br />
“Wanna finish the video with me?” Kass neighed soothingly, reaching for the remote as she kept Craig pressed against her with her other hoof-hand. “Or maybe you could try riding me - on my back, or on my belly. You’re the boss. I’m all yours.”</p>
