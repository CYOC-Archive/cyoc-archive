<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She couldn&#39;t tell him the truth, no way.  She might be killed!    She selected the &quot;Lie&quot; button and reality unfroze. Luke was looking at her expectantly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! You noticed?&quot; she said with a giggle.  &quot;I bought a beauty potion, is all.  It&#39;s a slow-working one, but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s working!&quot;  Huh, that lie had come surprisingly easily. Then a game message popped up notifying her that she&#39;d received the -35 alignment points, and she noticed that her alignment score now had a &quot;(Dark)&quot; tag next to it.  Wait, could her alignment score actually affect her personality?  Making lying easier? <br />
<br />
Luke frowned.  &quot;You know, I&#39;m glad if it makes you happy, but if you did it for me then you didn&#39;t have to.  I like you for a lot more than your looks, Lillian, and you were pretty when we first met, too.&quot;<br />
<br />
She blushed, and then sighed.  He was just too good.  She couldn&#39;t lie to him.  &quot;Luke...Luke I&#39;m sorry but, that was a lie.  I&#39;m just not ready to tell you the truth yet, though?  I hope you can forgive me and understand.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now he looked a bit hurt, but her alignment went back up 15 points, removing the &quot;(Dark)&quot; tag.  She could feel the difference.  She felt better, even if it tore her up to see Luke looking at her that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s ok.  I won&#39;t push you.&quot; he said, but the relationship score dropped 10 points.  As time went on though, he seemed to get over it and they were happy again.<br />
<br />
At one point during their date she stole away to use the restroom and read up on these succubus evolution paths while she was at it.   She knew she didn&#39;t want to go dark and enslave or kill people though, so she read up on the neutral evolutions.  The Omnislut was...not appealing.  She didn&#39;t want to fuck monsters and animals, and while she might have thought that getting a penis back would be nice, she realized that she&#39;d apparently become such a girl now that she was actually against the idea.<br />
<br />
So then there was the Parasite.  With that one, she could probably level up fast, if she were willing to sleep around a lot.  She wasn&#39;t sure about that, but she thought about it while reading up on its evolutions.  The Leacher evolution of Parasite could apparently feed off of radiant lust directed towards her, so that all she had to do was walk around looking sexy and she&#39;d drain small amounts of MP from everyone around her.  She also gained a once a day skill that let her use it more strongly on enemies in battle.  Well, that certainly seemed powerful.  There was also the Super Symbiote, which could actually confer unique and powerful buffs or even passive skills(at higher levels) in exchange for MP or XP.<br />
<br />
Well, Parasite it is, then.  She selected it and went back to Luke.  They finished up their date, and he insisted on &quot;bringing her home.&quot; When she told him what inn she was staying at, he looked shocked, and said she shouldn&#39;t have to stay in such a dump and could stay at his place.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; she asked, &quot;Trying to get me into your bedroom, are you?&quot; she said with a snicker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no!&quot; he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it that way.  I guess that was inappropriate the way it came out, but I was thinking you could stay in the unoccupied room. &quot;  Yet she had to admit she was feeling quite inappropriate herself.  Luke was hot.  She was getting horny.  She decided to make it happen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so?  What a shame...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A shame?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I was just thinking I&#39;d rather sleep in your room.  I want bottom.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I uh...don&#39;t have bunk beds?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I still want bottom.&quot;  The bedroom eyes she was making and the suggestive tone of her voice made her intent clear.  Luke&#39;s eyes lit up.<br />
<br />
It didn&#39;t take long after that for the horny young couple to make their way to Luke&#39;s house and fling open the door.  Lillian kicked it shut as they started to tear each other&#39;s clothes off.  Luke seemed a little hesitant, though.  &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;  She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No it&#39;s just...&quot; he blushed, &quot;It&#39;s my first time?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is adorable.&quot; she said.  &quot;Look, just relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;ok...&quot; he said as he let her free his cock from his pants. &quot;Oh, wow!&quot; she said as his monster of a dick bounced free.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heh, thanks.&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, but take charge.  You&#39;re still the man, and with a cock like that you ought to have some confidence!  I like being dominated. Guide me to my knees and make me suck it, stud.&quot;  Wait, what?  Had she really just said that?  She wasn&#39;t sure what had come over her but...she found her breath quickening, her body temperature rising. Maybe she really did want him too...<br />
<br />
His eyes widened at her words.  Then he suddenly looked serious.  He pushed her back against the wall, and lifted her chin with his finger as he brought their lips near &quot;If you&#39;re sure you want to be dominated, then I will.  I will make you utterly, completely mine.  But first I need to hear you say it.  You need to say you want to belong to me.&quot;<br />
<br />
She whimpered a little at the sudden penetrating intensity in his eyes.  He was oozing a raw male sexuality that suddenly had her quite certain: she DID want this.  &quot;I do!  I want to be yours.  I want to be your little slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; he said.  &quot;You like being degraded too, do you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Blushing, she nodded.  She couldn&#39;t believe what she was doing but she did.<br />
<br />
He growled.  &quot;Then show me what you&#39;ve got, slut.&quot;  He put his hand on top of her head and pushed downward.  As she fell to her knees the feels that went through her mind were hard to describe.  It felt less powerful, yes, but she was lusting to feel desired.  She remembered how sexy and alluring women had been to her when she was male, and now she wanted to be that.  She wanted to make his cock throb with need.  And then there it was, pointed right at her face.  She knew that sucking it would be such an utterly submissive act.  A total surrender to the might of his manhood.  Struck with remembrance that she was a guy only days ago, she hesitated.  If she did this, she could never call herself a guy again.  Then she felt his hand on the back of her head, slowly pushing it closer.  Did she really want this?  It was so...so big, so intimidating, so...powerful! so intoxicating!  Yes! she wanted this!  She wanted to surrender to him, to grant him the power and authority and let him have his way with her.<br />
<br />
She opened her sweet cherry lips with a cute but lusty little moan and prepared herself to be penetrated.  Luke guided her  onto his rod, somehow as gentle as he was forceful and commanding.  His movements seemed to say &quot;I will care for you, but you are mine, and I give the orders.&quot; It lit her on fire.  Then his manhood passed her tender lips. As he filled her her brain exploded with new feelings.  *I&#39;m...I&#39;m sucking a cock!* she thought *I&#39;m totally a girl.  No man could do this.  I&#39;m letting him use my pretty girly lips for his pleasure...and...I love it! I love pleasing him, love his manly moans, love his satisfaction at my surrender, love being beneath him, submissive and obedient.  Oh my god I&#39;m a shameless cocksucker!&quot;  The thought only filled her with pleasure and made her pussy ache. She reached a hand down to tend to it as she adoringly looked up into her conqueror&#39;s eyes.  Eye contact.  She remembered how sexy it had been when a girl made eye contact during blow jobs when she&#39;d been a guy, as if to say &quot;I&#39;m not ashamed to be doing this.&quot;  She wasn&#39;t.  She was proud.  She looked deep into his eyes and told him that she was proud of her place beneath him, and as she did she took him into her throat.  She wondered if she could do it or if she would gag, but apparently she had no gag reflex. Perks of being a succubus, perhaps.  He had to be at least nine inches long and too thick to fully wrap her tiny hand around, but she took him like a pro anyway.<br />
<br />
Luke groaned in pleasure.  He stroked her hair gently, but the lust in his words was evident. &quot;That&#39;s my little cocksucker.&quot; he growled.  &quot;Take it all.  You&#39;ll swallow like a good girl?&quot;<br />
<br />
As he pulled out she gasped for air, but she felt empty now.  She felt like she needed him inside her and would never feel right otherwise again. &quot;Yes!&quot; she proclaimed.  &quot;This little slut would love to swallow her man&#39;s cum!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; said Luke.  &quot;But have you earned it?&quot; he asked. &quot;What will you do for it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll do whatever it takes, anything to please you...Master.&quot;  If he wanted to play that way, she was down.<br />
<br />
Luke smiled.  &quot;Excellent.  Then I want you to...&quot;</p>
