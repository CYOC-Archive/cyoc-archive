<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">With the audience dwindling, it was beginning to be clear that the show would need another later return in order to fill its seats once again. Spectro could tell that the guests were noticing this ever more now that his latest addition flew around the tent, and with less guests volunteering, the show might even need to wrap early.<br />
<br />
The tent flap opened, however, as several more guests slipped in to catch the rest of the performance. With each person taking their seat, Spectro could sense their fate. Would hey be added to the show, or some other part of the circus?<br />
<br />
One guest did catch his interest, on the other hand. “Ladies and gentlemen, as the show goes on, our acts will only continue to amaze and astound you. So far tonight, we have seen acts both beautiful and daring, but with our next act, we’d like to add more fun and wonder to the stage. I’m going to need a volunteer once again. Please, don’t be shy!”<br />
<br />
Backstage, everyone awaited to see who would join their ranks. O’Hara already could get an idea where the show would be going, and the totem trio began to fidget, almost fighting to peek out and watch.<br />
<br />
Spectro looked over the crowd of now additional audience members when he found the one guest he’d been looking for. “You there in the bright shirt! Come, join me on stage.”<br />
<br />
A young man in a soft pink top made his way forward. Hair brushed, he appeared both shy and curious, gentle eyes looking around and at Spectro.<br />
<br />
“What’s your name, curious one?” The magician asked.<br />
<br />
“John,” he said. “Everyone calls me Lauren, though.”<br />
<br />
“Lauren? Well, that’s a beautiful name. To what reason do they call you that?” In a second, the young gentleman flinches, and his eyes began to wetten as he looked down and towards the stage. He didn’t even question how he’d already gotten atop the wooden floorboards.<br />
<br />
“I’m transgender. Female identifying, actually.”<br />
<br />
“Oh, dear! I’m sorry, my friend. I didn’t mean anything by it. You look as beautiful as ever, of course, if I do say so!” Spectro bowed to the young woman, knowing exactly where he was going. “Well, for this next act, may I help you feel a little more comfortable, for no hard feelings?”<br />
<br />
Lauren shrugged, wiping her eyes. These same eyes grew in wonder as without any sound or clear reason how, Spectro pulled out a large red balloon, tied to a gentle ribbon and drifting in the air. “My friend, this is for you. All I ask is that you take it and blow it up. Try it. Show us how large you can expand this toy.”<br />
<br />
She took the balloon both shyly and curious, as before. In front of her, it glistened like a jewel, softly squeaking when pulled. She could see the balloon was tied, but something told her to try anyways. She took the tie in her mouth and began to blow, waiting for something to happen.<br />
<br />
Backstage, the totem trio, Rosewood, and Penny all peaked from the corner of the curtain. They watched as the toy grew in size into a round, bulbous orb. Along with it growing, they could see a smile form on Lauren’s face. Her eyes grew wide while soft whiskers tickled out from above her darkening lips.<br />
<br />
Finally, the balloon was nothing more than a large inflated ball, big enough to bounce and sit off, if at all possible. Lauren pulled it from her mouth, revealing a feline curve of her lips as children in the audience clapped for the simple trick. “Brilliant, Lauren! Now, for the next part, I’ll need you to try and ground that toy and stop on top. Go ahead and do your best. We trust you’ll be safe and capable,” Spectro said.<br />
<br />
Stand atop the balloon? Wasn’t that impossible? Lauren had done many tricks in her time at the circus, including inflating a sealed balloon, but never had she stood atop such a soft and defenseless toy. With hesitation, the young woman stepped out of her shoes, revealing golden paws lifting into the air. She planted the red toy on the stage and placed her first paw on its surface. It gave, of course, but somehow the balloon also supported her. Biting her lip, revealing strong fangs from behind her growing muzzle, Lauren stepped up on both legs and balanced, before rising her slim and curved form for the audience. She balanced on the balloon like a performer riding a toy with perfect precision.<br />
<br />
The audience clapped, mostly being of children towards the front. Even Rosewood and the trio backstage gave their appreciation. The others, older and more amused by daring stunts, smiled and rolled their eyes. They’d seen the woman’s tricks many times already.<br />
<br />
Lauren smiled down at the crowd as golden fur prickled across her body. Her clothes adjusted, taking on brighter, shimmering hues while the balloon squeaked beneath her. Every moment, she moved to keep her balance as Spectro walked the stage around her. “Next, my dear, I’ll have you show our friends what other skills you have. Ready?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, Spectro.” Her voice came out softer and with a pleased rumble, ears poking through a growing mane.<br />
<br />
The magician waved his hands, and falling from the ceiling were three clubs of bright, silly colors. As if prepared, the feline caught all theee and began to juggle, balancing with her paws and extending, tufted tail. Around her, gasps filled the tent as a grin took over Lauren’s face. While the first part of her act was always amusing, this was by far her favorite. Her dress-like outfit of clownish colors sparkled beneath her as she pulled out a forth club and added to the routine. Then, a fifth. Children cheered, while the moving lioness chuffed and began to speed up.<br />
<br />
“Don’t try this at home, kiddos. I’m a world class savannah cat!” Lauren’s voice filled the tent like that of a strong performer. Her golden eyes looked for what would be her hidden coperformer, tucked somewhere in the audience in waiting, ready to be silly and playful. Finally, she started to jump on the balloon, which stayed soft and right beneath her as it bounced and lifted her in the air.<br />
<br />
“Give it up for The Luxuriant Lioness, LJ!” Spectro began the applause as soft clown makeup appeared on the lioness face: her eyes, muzzle, and cheeks colored up with non-abusive pastels, lips staying a normal black. She caught the last of her club routine to a halt before blowing up another large balloon, blue, and bounced it into the audience. Finishing her act, the queen of comedy leapt from her ball like a most graceful feline, tucked, landed and rolled, before bowing on stage. The bell tying her tail’s end jingled, while her bright orange mane stayed fluffy and soft for all to wonder at.<br />
<br />
The lioness, taking a claw, popped her red balloon with a loud burst of noise, confetti exploded over the stage, revealing her to be gone and hidden. Tommy, of course, knew she was in her dressing room awaiting her next act. He’d find her there waiting for him as well, where she would ask him of his day, kiss him, and maybe give him his own balloon, too.<br />
<br />
“With LJ now resting for her next performance, our show will move into intermission. Please enjoy the snacks out front prepared by our own, and return in just ten minutes for the next performance to amaze you.”</p>
