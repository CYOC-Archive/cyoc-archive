<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate had just graduated high school and was looking for a job. He still lived at home but he hoped to get out on his own as quick as he <br />
possibly could.<br />
<br />
Nate returned home after a day of job seeking to discover a package with his name on it. He hadn't ordered anything but saw &quot;beta&quot; on the <br />
package and figured it was some game to be tested. Nate wasn't much of a gamer but he might as well try it out.<br />
<br />
The instructions talked about transformation which confused Nate but he decided to play along. A game of transformation was different.<br />
<br />
The instructions told him to scan a few images into his computer: at least one image of himself and at least one image of what he might want <br />
to transform into. Nate was proud of his body so just for the fun of it, scanned in a naked self picture. Then goofing around, not taking any of <br />
this seriously, he scanned a bunch of other images including a gargoyle. The gargoyle looked fierce with long fangs and horns.<br />
<br />
Then the program started asking questions about how much of a transformation Nate wanted. Nate didn't understand all the questions but he <br />
realized that combining his already good looks with the fierce looks of the gargoyle was a better idea than simply looking like a gargoyle. So he <br />
answered the questions accordingly thinking the computer would create an avatar for him that was part gargoyle and part himself.<br />
<br />
Then the program asked him if he wanted a job. This surprised Nate but Nate figured the job was beta testing the game so Nate clicked, &quot;yes&quot;. <br />
Finally the program asked him if he was ready to transform. Nate clicked, &quot;yes&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then Nate suddenly stood up an walked out the door. Nate tried to stop himself but he was no longer acting under his own control. He kept <br />
walking. He walked to a nearby museum. There were a few people around but not many. Nate walked to an area where there weren't any people <br />
and stripped his clothes off. He had only been wearing shorts and a t-shirt but he was naked now and embarrassed hoping no one would walk <br />
by but he couldn't stop himself from striking a pose. He stood on one leg and twisted his body like a dancer.  He pointed his left leg and right <br />
arm behind him while pointing his left arm in front of him. He then froze into a statue.<br />
<br />
Nate first panicked about being frozen as a statue and when he calmed down from that panic, he realized that his pose exposed his body a <br />
great deal more than he thought his body could be exposed.  From the angle that people would be looking at him, they'd be able to see his <br />
face, his chest, his genitals, and his ass, all at the same time. He was mostly in profile but his left leg pushed his left ass cheek out so that both <br />
ass cheeks were visible while his genitals were thrust forward by the swiftness of his movement. He tried to look down to see how exposed he <br />
was but he couldn't look down. He didn't know that when he turned into a statue, his body hair also reduced to expose him more. His full seven <br />
inches were on display.<br />
<br />
A janitor came by and took his clothes to the lost and found muttering something about a practical joke.<br />
<br />
Several people walked by to admire the new statue. One of them read the plaque out loud so Nate knew he was now a statue called &quot;The <br />
Dancer&quot; and that he was listed as both the artist and the model.<br />
<br />
One of the girls commented, &quot;Wow, Nate has a hot body.&quot;<br />
<br />
One of the guys commented, &quot;That is an incredibly detailed statue. You can even clearly make out the shape of his glans under his foreskin.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate felt like he was blushing but there was no visible change to the statue. Although proud of his body, he still didn't like the idea of being <br />
exposed to strangers.<br />
<br />
The managers of the museum finally came down to check out the mysterious new statue. One manager said, &quot;I don't care if we have no records <br />
or contracts, that statue is one of the best works of art this museum has ever had. We need to find the artist and commission him. We need to <br />
use that statue in our promotions to get people to come to the museum. Let's get some big glossy photos made.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another manager said, &quot;When other museums hear about that statue, they'll try to buy it from us. They'll offer us big bucks for that statue. We <br />
need to establish that statue is ours and demand a ten million dollar price tag for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nate was shocked both by the idea that he might be sold to another museum and by the idea that he was worth ten million dollars.<br />
<br />
Another manager said, &quot;Alright but let's be careful when we talk to the artist, this Nate fellow. Let's try to make him think the statue is not that <br />
valuable so we don't have to pay a high price for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Several hours passed. Nate got used to the attention and realized that the crowds around him were bigger than the crowds elsewhere in the <br />
museum. His naked body was that highlight of the museum. Then it was closing time and the crowds left.<br />
<br />
When Nate was alone, he wondered if he'd have to spend the night by himself, naked and standing in a museum. But then he started to move. <br />
He checked his body and it was slowly returning to normal. He touched his hip while it was still stone and felt it soften into flesh.<br />
<br />
When he was sure that he was completely normal again, he looked around. He was naked and locked in a museum and he had no idea where <br />
his clothes were. There were security cameras everywhere and other sensors but he felt fortunate that none of the cameras saw him.<br />
<br />
Then he thought about the future. How do I get out of here and get home? What if I turn into a statue again? How much money can I get as a <br />
statue? How can I keep this secret? What if they put the cameras on me tomorrow? Where can I stash my clothes? What will my friends think if <br />
they discover I got a job as a statue?</p>
