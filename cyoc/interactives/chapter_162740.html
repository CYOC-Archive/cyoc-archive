<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>One more chapter before the juicy bit, hopefully this makes the transformation that bit more climactic, and the adventure ahead that bit more interesting.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Grace and I both turned a bright shade of red, realizing that half the clinic was now looking in our direction. I had a brief moment to glance around as the crowd of staff encircled us, only to find some of the details of our contract projected onto a nearby wall, our contract becoming a massive victory for the clinic. Our attempt to keep this private had gone miserably, and I suspected it was Danny’s fault, who sported a grin so malevolent it was as if Satan himself had given it to her. <br />
<br />
Both Grace and I managed to glare at her briefly, only to have it subsumed beneath a wave of back rubs and congratulations by the three assistants. It was sensory overload, and before I knew what I was doing I found myself putting my name on the contract. <br />
<br />
My heart sunk, a long trail week of litteral sex slavery looming over me. <br />
<br />
There were whoops and whistles, with the crowd beyond the booths looking between us and the projection of our contract, the projection hyping itself as the “most extensive contract to date,” a hollow boast to make on the first day of operation. After squinting at the screen I noticed a small caption at the bottom, stating the views did not represent the views of the clinic, and were in fact opinions of a client. Grace, who was also squinting, quickly turned to her lover with a sigh.<br />
<br />
Accepting the ovation with a bow, little Danny popped into the table again and put a hand on my head, an arm around her lover, and began posing as the staff took photos. I smiled as best I could, my head swelling with dread.<br />
<br />
What have I gotten myself into, I thought.<br />
<br />
 “I gotta make a few phone calls before we do this.” I blustered. “Shall meet you two in a private room?”<br />
<br />
“N-no,” Grace stammered, stirring at my side “You are ours now, and you don&#39;t get to leave our side for at least a week. Besides I want to use this mass before, I, uh…”<br />
<br />
“Before she fucks it into you!” A voice teased from the distance. It was a red head from the other group in the boothing area, leaning in with a mocking smile. I didn’t have time to think what she meant, as Grace rose from her seat and swept me out of the booth, cradling me into her arms with one smooth motion, pounding away out of the scene as she began to turn redder still, and her smile broadened. <br />
<br />
It was hard to tell whether Grace was truly embarrassed, because her grin seemed genuine. A second later an excited Danny joined the fray, hopping onto me, sitting her pert bottom on my belly. Grace barely reacted at all. <br />
<br />
“To the suits!” Danny commanded from atop me, pointing towards a grand set of doors on the far side. <br />
<br />
I’m not gonna lie; even though I felt like I was being mocked, and a huge part of me felt rushed into the situation, a much louder part of me was incredibly aroused. Grace wasn’t the best looking lady, but the excess mass had a shapliness to it, and I was pressed into her breasts, feeling the impact of her plodding as it waved through the flesh. I wasn’t just resting on her arms, I was being embraced, both cared for and kept, and I could feel past the reserved front and the bubbling anticipation beneath, as her breath skipped every time her eyes flicked down towards me.<br />
<br />
Danny required less deciphering. She was in her element, driving the situation and taking the attention, and her placement made things much more interesting for me, much harder to focus on planning ahead. I could feel her. Her curvy ass was sitting right on my belly, turning me into a saddle, one hand on my shoulder, the other on my thigh. Even though my heart was so anxious it had to pump blood all over my body, it still managed to send enough towards my cock to make stifling an erection near impossible. <br />
<br />
I was conscious of the fact that we were still amidst the public area of the clinic, the eyes of every pervert on our bizarre little family unit, with cameras clicking away. The very last thing I wanted for my last images as a regular human was for them to be of me with a barely concealed erection, and the underwear provided hardly made the task any easier. Then there was the other discovery, the one that only made me shudder with excitement, and blush with shame.<br />
<br />
I could feel it. Danny was sitting on me, so I could feel it. Her crotch, her cock, was pressed tucked against my abdomen, rubbing against me with every powerful step. I felt it twitch, moistening with precum, hard as a rock. I had never in my life even thought about cock before, not in that way, but just the thought of that tiny little waif, and that sly little steaming…<br />
<br />
Her right hand shifted, seemingly in reaction to an extra hard jiggle from the titain carrying us, but if it was I didn’t feel it. <br />
<br />
“Whoopsie.” She breathed, her eyes still on the camera ahead of us, her mind very much elsewhere. Her dainty little hand was now lightly grasping my inner thigh, rubbing it with each step.<br />
<br />
“I can be so clumsy,” Grace concured, grinning down at me.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
There was a bang as Grace kicked her way into the private room. The last of the clinic staff, still armed with a camera, applauded, congratulating us one last time before closing the door behind us. There was a shunk as the door locked, and we found ourselves alone in a large tiled room, dominated by a steaming pool of lavender liquid. It smelt sweet and sexual, and definately chemical. It was like a sauna, the heat almost crushing, adding to the sinking feeling that I was not trapped.<br />
<br />
“That was fun!” Danny said, dismounting.<br />
<br />
“Tell me next time,” Grace added, setting me down, letting me retreat into a corner as she started to undress. “You know I get nervous.”<br />
<br />
Her two massive breasts broke free of the bra, flopping onto her chest, but with a surprising amount of perk. Her underwear, it turns out, was very unflattering. While relatively plain in her face and awkward in shape, Grace had plenty of hips, giving her thick and powerful thighs. <br />
<br />
I realized that would soon be mine, moreso if I got the curves of Danny, or if that was even how this thing worked.<br />
<br />
“Not as nervous as him,” Danny chided, undoing her underwear first. Her manhood sprang out, the seamless tube and shining head being at least 25% longer than my own. “I thought he would cum there and then.”<br />
<br />
“He nearly did,” Grace added, pointing to my underwear, which was sodden with precum.<br />
<br />
Danny laughed, but gave me a sympathetic shoulder rub. That didn’t help. My manhood was now pitching a mighty tent, and I could do nothing but stand in awkward silence. <br />
<br />
Danny pulled away for a second, unclasping her bra and just letting her pert and plentiful breasts reveal themselves to me while she looked around the room, unaware of just how radiant she looked. When she found my tent she remained unaffected, and leaned in, pushing me against the cold tiles and resting against me. Her breasts against my chest, her own hard-on pointing at me.<br />
<br />
“Now, before we start, I have to ask about something.” She was breathing into my face, her head a little below mine. She was all that I could look at. “You said you needed to make a call earlier, and while I am aware you were probably stalling for time I will also say Grace and I will be generous masters, and give you that one phone call, with one condition…”<br />
<br />
There was a snap. Somehow the colossal Grace had manuvred to my side, removing my underwear, revealing my cock. <br />
<br />
“You have to make that call with us here, while we work on you.” Grace said, flanking the other side of me. Now both of them were pinning me, with Grace’s breasts nearer my head, her hand stroking my collar bone. “If you don’t want to, that&#39;s fine, but that will make your first sentence to us as our slave a bold faced lie, for which you will be punished.”<br />
<br />
“Please,” I whimpered, my cock twitching. Now both of them were breathing on me, and it was becoming hard to think, their warm fragrance crushing me. I was so hard it was beginning to hurt, and yet so scared my breath was starting to skip. <br />
<br />
“Punishments will be themed of course,” Danny chimed in her hand disappearing behind her and rummaging for something from a changing duffle bag. “And what better theme than phones? Yours, for instance…” She pulled the phone out, my phone, and my heart skipped as she effortlessly unlocked it without my input. “Yours is a privilege, and one you seemed eager to abuse. Makes sense if we took this privilege from you, considering how eager you were to abuse it.”<br />
<br />
“That being said, Danny, they could have been so excited they could barely contain themselves and wanted to tell the world, I mean they are very excited in other ways.”<br />
<br />
Her hand landed on my cock, feeling it&#39;s firmness and softness, daintiness and slenderness. I gasped, and pleaded, but both were lost as they sent me skidding into the pool. It had the viscosity of wine, and as I emerged I was looking up at my two owners, as they pushed the contact list on my phone towards me, holding it over the water. <br />
<br />
“Your choice,” Danny laughed, “Maybe your last. Either you give your sister a call, or we drop this in with us.”<br />
<br />
Grace put her arm around her lover, diving into her neck, sucking on it until Danny’s eyes began to roll, the phone almost slipping. <br />
<br />
I was watching in horror, as my list link to my old humanity hung in the balance.</p>
