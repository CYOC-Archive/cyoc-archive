<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">This was bad! Very bad! No bodily entrences, not the traditional kind anyhow. Top that with the lack of any pills, this could be the end of Jen and Clair&#39;s fun...<br />
<br />
Jen still on her feet awkwardly moved to the shattered remains of their desk. Sifting through the wreckage she found paper and pens. Not an easy task as her waist and Clair&#39;s clashed togther. In their overlapping bodies. If Jen could put it into words, it was like having overalls stuck around your knees with her legs restricted and her back stiff from Claire&#39;s legs. <br />
<br />
Finding cleared space Jen lay on her back and Clair with her. Both took a pen and  paper and began writing, the movement of laying down however rocked their respective cocks in their mouths only encouraging their perpetual deep throating.<br />
<br />
J: we need a pill<br />
<br />
C: there has to be one somewhere.<br />
    the shop? Diana?<br />
<br />
Between writing both girls watched as their cheeks blew in and sucked blowing each other off. They briefly wondered how they were breathing but as they continued to suck/be sucked off the other it was a fleeting thought. Still stimulated they continued to write.<br />
<br />
J: no last ones went to fox and dog<br />
<br />
C: Mrs. Watson?<br />
<br />
J: knowing her, already used.<br />
<br />
Their questioning was interrupted as they both came down eachothers throats. The release was amazing haveung been forcibly deep throated, the hit cum rusing diwn their gullets. Most surprising was the amount, minutes passed and spurt after spurt flowed down into their stomachs. They watched as their shard abdomen slowly rose like a warm dough into a sloshing potbelly.  When they finally stopped cumming they layed flat on their back, both happy for their lack of cleanup required, had they not been self contained they likely wouldn&#39;t have anything to communicate with.<br />
<br />
In their afterglow, Jen shot up scribbling frantically<br />
<br />
J: FAIR !!!<br />
<br />
Feeling her other half jostle Clair rose up to look too. <br />
<br />
C: Fair?<br />
<br />
J: the craft fair! The dust! It has to have settled! Or a chunk from the huge pills is hidden somewhere!<br />
<br />
C: Jen your a genus! <br />
<br />
Clair pushed herself to the wall, slowing Jen to rise against it and stand, their cum filled belly continued to shift and jiggle, drooping slightly twords Clair as Jen became upright. She stiffly jogged out their room and down the enormous hall, past their dinning room where their four parents were still screwing. They bees fly watched as Jen&#39;s and Clair&#39;s mothers were kissing passionately one their hands and knees as their fathers humped them doggy style. <br />
<br />
Jen waved her arms in a hurried motion when one of the Martha fairies flew over head.   It was the red winged Marthaher her 25foot hight challenged by the 20foot horse cock that swayed with her flight. <br />
<br />
The large fairy swooped down to their girls shocked with their condition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my goodness girls! What happened too you? Can you breath? Do you need to go to the hospital?&quot; She began to panic.<br />
<br />
Jen pulled up her paper and scribbled out her response. <br />
<br />
J: were ok, but were out of pills and stuck like this. <br />
<br />
Clair did the same with her arms holding it to Martha, who turned her head to try and read it. Clair realized her mistake and flipped the paper right side up for her to read.<br />
<br />
C: don&#39;t seem to need air ATM. But we fill up with cum. <br />
<br />
She then poked her belly to show their maid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that can&#39;t be good...&quot;<br />
<br />
J: no, but we know where some pills might be. Can you fly us to the craft fair in Shepfield?<br />
<br />
&quot;Of curse girls, this is an emergency! I dout your parents will mind that its so late, ill tell them everthing once their not so &#39;busy&#39;...&quot; She trailed off. Perhaps out of jealousy it sounded like. Their parents were just screwing all night long now while the Martha&#39;s were still hard at work.<br />
<br />
The red wing Martha fairy bent down to scoop up the girls in her massive arms. And her fairy wings became to buzz like a hummingbird as she took off.<br />
<br />
Jeen quickly rose her paper into Martha&#39;s face before she got too far off the ground.<br />
<br />
J: stop at pir bathroom first <br />
<br />
Martha shrugged and zoomed off down the enormous hall back to their rooms. Across the football field wide hall a small door sat in their ground, this was Jen and Clair&#39;s bathroom. They went inside and Jen fished an eye drop bottle for her summer allergies from the medicine cabinet. <br />
<br />
Back in the hall Martha waited, scooping the girls up again then zipping off through the enormous house.<br />
<br />
Martha seemed to follow the the same route Jen, Clair, and Lucy had taken a few days ealier through the woods and hills that separated the rural towns. Jen made a note to come back to the uncivilized wilds out here. Away from people or the ever present but blocked out hum of electricity, it was calming. The pills effects could really let them go wild out here too, nothing to bother or stop them.<br />
<br />
Her focus returned when Martha spoke down to them. &quot;Ok girls, were almost there i think? It&#39;s hard to see without any lights below&quot;<br />
<br />
True to the statement Jen and Clair could only see the black of ground off set by the dark blue of night sky, this might be harder then they thought.<br />
<br />
Martha set them down among the many rows of  stands and tents. In the dark the girls could do little to aid their search. Martha helped as best they could but a&#39;lass her transformation had only gifted her wings, hight, and a phonepoll sized horse cock, nothing to aid in the low to no light of midnight.<br />
<br />
Eventually the girls had wondered to the stone central path of the fairgrounds and made their way to the cross roads where they had created the epicenter of their  transformative pill cloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;You girls wait here, I&#39;m going to try and find some kind of light.&quot; Martha instructed, zipping off over the tent roofs of the stalls.<br />
<br />
 Jen and Clair did what they could hopeing at this point that they might get lucky. Jen ran her fingers over stalls, table, props, and even tarps hopeing that after 2days their might be some residue of the dusted pills left over.<br />
<br />
Clair patted her hands along the ground in any little cracks or nooks her flailing arms could find as she patted around in the dark. A task made infinitely more difficult since her perspective was upside down. Still she found small crumblelly lumps in her search, collecting them in hopes they weren&#39;t just food crumbs or dirt clumps.<br />
<br />
Jen after collecting some dirt on her fingers pinched the cap off her eye drops and sprinkled the residue into it. Clair handed her findings to the Jen who pinched and grounded them into the bottle as well, hopeing whatever trace amounts of the magic pills they had found, would be enough to get them at least one mouth back.<br />
<br />
Jen raised the dropper to her eye in the dark and squeezed gently, feeling a few drips on her cheek she adjusted and felt the splash on her eyelids, blinking to help the formula feed into her tier-ducts...</p>
