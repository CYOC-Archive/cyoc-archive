<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">In his previous body, Felix is often the one initiating the conversation. Most of which are left on read and he doesn’t know why it happens so much. When he matched with Andrew Matthews, he started the conversation with,<br />
<br />
“I saw you,” He typed. Felix was baffled. There no cheesy pick-up lines or a simple hi? It’s ‘I saw you’ and that’s weird.<br />
<br />
“You saw me?” Felix asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, dude. You’re our new neighbors. Don’t you remember me? I and my brother helped your dad moved boxes into your house. I saw you but it seems you didn’t saw me.”<br />
<br />
Oh. Felix guessed they are somewhat acquainted then. Getting to know him will be easier.<br />
<br />
“You want me to come over to your place?” Andrew asked.<br />
<br />
“Already? I haven’t taken a bath yet,” Felix sniffed himself and it seemed Jet hasn’t taken a bath in days. He smelled so pungent like rotten laundry but at the same time, the musk filled his lungs and sparked life in his package. Fuck. He’s practically attracted to his own scent. <br />
<br />
“Don’t worry bro. It’s better if you don’t.”<br />
<br />
Okay? Felix thought that Andrew must like musky scents too.<br />
<br />
“Also, open your backyard gate.”<br />
<br />
Felix went outside and beyond the white picket fences was Andrew from the profile. He looked different. Not in a bad way but it’s quite the opposite. He has this brown, short, and a bit spiky hair that looked like they were waxed recently. He gave Felix a cheeky smile and a slight blush while Felix was opening the gate. <br />
<br />
And not mention, he voice. It sounds raspy like a cool surfer dude. “Hey man. Wassup?” He said as he gave Felix a brofist. <br />
<br />
“Good, better actually.”<br />
<br />
“That’s cool. You looked like shit when you moved here,” He chuckled. Felix leads him inside the house and asked if he liked some lemonade from the fridge. He thanked Felix for the drink and continued inside. “It’s weird the I saw you first on Twinder. My mom was supposed to give a home-warming pie to welcome you and your dad. I guess plans changed and I’ll be your welcoming party.” He chuckled once more. For a cool looking dude, he sounds like a dork laughing at his own cliched jokes. It’s good though as the light-hearted conversation is the farthest Felix experienced in Twinder match ups. <br />
<br />
“So how do you want to do this?” Andrew asked.<br />
<br />
To be frank, Felix didn’t think this through. He doesn’t know whether Jet is a top, a bottom, or a switch. Well, of course, he is a top since he had a hetero relationship with a girl. But what about a man? Fuck. He should have thought more about this. Anyway, he may have the ability to possess people but he does not have time-rewinding powers. He can’t turn away from this now.<br />
<br />
“I… uh… I don’t know actually. It’s my first time doing this.”<br />
<br />
“Whoa, dude.” Andrew looked at Felix from top to bottom. “You’re a virgin? With a body like that, I assumed you’re fucking girls and guys every other day. You’re wasting your looks dude.”<br />
<br />
“That’s why I’m using Twinder.”<br />
<br />
“Twinder’s for one night stands around this place. If you want a serious relationship with someone, come to my mid-summer party this evening. There are going to be a lot of people, single people mostly. But first…” Andrew smiled while he knelt on eye level with me. His soft hands touched my chin and lead my lips to his. The kiss was soft and sweet, Andrew showed no hesitation to show his expertise as he carefully rummaged around Felix’s mouth with his tongue. As they were doing this, Felix leads Andrew to one bedroom of his gigantic house while undressing both of their clothes. They were buck naked when they crashed through a bed.<br />
<br />
Andrew was quite insistent on prodding Felix’s mouth but he was nice enough to leave some space for learning for the other. Felix experimented with different movements, his tongue was a lot flexible than before and it allowed him to change its thickness and position with ease. Andrew liked it when the other’s tongue danced on his own, where he could taste the mac and cheese he ate this morning. Most of all, he loved it when he kissed deeper and whisked a few faint scents of his musk. This match up, in his opinion, will be one to remember.<br />
<br />
While there were busy kissing each other, Andrew&#39;s hands roamed all over Felix’s skin. Felix’s current body is not that ripped but the dense muscle is evident by how tight he is. Andrew’s fingers danced and snaked at the other’s skin that’s thinly coated with sweat. Andrew broke off his kiss but his tongue remained connected to Felix’s body as it progressed downward his torso, tasting and smelling further the briny sweat.<br />
<br />
Masturbating alone in his room paled in comparison to the bliss Felix is experiencing as of the moment. Jet’s body has its buttons and with Andrew’s tongue, he’s pressing all the right ones. There was prickling points of pleasure coming everywhere. Each flick of his tongue is a shot straight to his core - his psyche and inner wants. Once the torso is coated with an even layer of sweat and saliva, Andrew advanced upwards and into Felix’s pits. The smell and musk are dense in the vicinity of his pit hair. Andrew sniffed a mouthful of the musk and exhaled slowly, letting the smell leave a hard imprint on his lungs.<br />
<br />
“You really like my smell don’t you?” Felix asked.<br />
<br />
“It’s one of my kinks and to be honest, you’re the best smelling one so far dude.”<br />
<br />
“I don’t know if I’ll take it as a compliment or not.”<br />
<br />
“It’s a compliment,”<br />
<br />
Felix wanted to give him a faint smile but Andrew attacked with his tongue when he left a long-lasting lick on his pits. The ensuing shock starting from his balls sent Felix on a stupor, making him shiver for a few seconds. Andrew didn’t bother to give a warning. And he won’t be bothering as he gave the pit another longer-lasting lick. He savored the salty taste and the base-hitting woody scent. As much as Andrew wanted to stay forever smelling his neighbor’s pits, he knew he had to advance the intercourse to the next level.<br />
<br />
Andrew flipped over with his cock in front of Jey and Jet’s cock in front of his face. Jet has a nice cock. It’s shorter than Andrew but is has a cute pinkish erection. For a virgin, the guy keeps his gear well shaven. It’s especially better when Andrew found more erotic aromas coming from his balls. He gave it a lick which made Felix more erected and his dick slapped Andrew on the face.<br />
<br />
“You just dick-slapped me,”<br />
<br />
“Sorry. All of this is so new and raw to me,”<br />
<br />
“It’s good that I’m your first fuck isn’t it?”<br />
<br />
Felix’s current dick is bigger than what he used to have before. The added length feels surreal, like a phantom limb but reversed. It’s long which meant the added length can give him an extended sensation of pleasure. Andrew prodded the tip and licked around the head and stretching the foreskin along with it. His tongue capered around the head and giving it more saliva with every spin. The pleasure is too much, but not too strong for Felix to lose sight of his prize. In front of him was the biggest member he has seen in real life - twice bigger than his original body. He grabbed the shaft and gave it experimental licks from the balls to tip.<br />
<br />
“Oh god!,” Andrew cursed “You’re a natural dude. More!”<br />
<br />
Felix lapped top to bottom, front to back and side to side. He could feel Andrew shiver from ecstasy when he bores he tries to bore his tongue on his dick slit. <br />
<br />
As they were busy lapping each other’s dick off, Felix had an idea. He closed his eyes and focused sending his soul to Andrew’s body. His eyes may be closed - lost in the dark - but the gravity of the world around him turned upside down. When he opened his eyes, Felix felt that he is even bigger than before. His limbs are in the wrong comfortable places while his mouth is filled to the edge with dick and balls. Felix looked below him and saw Jet whose eyes are closed and savoring every inch of Felix’s member invading his mouth. It’s surprising how easily he turned the straightest dude in his server into a guy with no qualms about having a dick shoved into his mouth.<br />
<br />
With that and done, Felix closed his eyes once more and went back to Jet’s body. Then he went back into Andrews and back again. He did this like a ping-pong of consciousness between two bodies, each jump is faster and he could feel every sensation at that slice of time. Every grunt, every lick, and every drop of pleasure is his to give and to receive. For that moment in time, he was lost and found between two bodies. Their body synced into one and so was their impending explosion.<br />
<br />
Slowly.<br />
<br />
Surely.<br />
<br />
He could feel it. The pleasure building up in his system, barred by a dam that is their willpower. Felix held tighter with four of his hands and shut his eyes deeper. <br />
<br />
In the blink of an eye, the defenses broke down and the slow filling pleasure ramped up fast - like shaking a bottle of champagne too hard where the foam is only barred by a single loosely gripped cork. His heart went fast while his mind could only focus on one thing.<br />
<br />
The explosion.<br />
<br />
All systems broke loose and their collective mind shattered in a strong momentary bliss. Their hot seed flowed down each other’s throats. Felix was reluctant to swallow it but Andrew never hid the fact that he savored ever drop of it.<br />
<br />
The ping-pong of consciousness between two bodies dialed down until Felix settled down on Andrew’s body. He could jump back to Jet’s but he wants to savor the ebbing euphoria still clinging on his body. He turned around and laid himself face forward to the dark blue ceiling of the room. <br />
<br />
“That was the best,” Jet asked. He heaved while still leaking cum on his dick and mouth. <br />
<br />
“It sure is,” Felix replied.<br />
<br />
Jet climbed over Felix’s broad chest and when their heads are in front of one another, it gave Felix the time to contemplate Jet’s look. His head is mousy with a button and a freckled nose. When he smiled, his cheeks get dragged along and leaving a deep dimple on his left in their wake. His ears is thin and more pronounced, unlike his chin which may be somewhat small but strong. He gave Felix that signature smile then left him a light kiss on his lips.<br />
<br />
When their lips connected, Felix jumped one last time and opened to Andrew’s face savoring the last bits of intimate connection they have for the day.<br />
<br />
“Can this be a regular thing?” Andrew asked. “You’re not the best but I know you could be. For a moment, I could feel not only my pleasure but yours as well. I know it’s weird but I felt it as if it were real.”<br />
<br />
If Felix gave it more time to think about what he’d said, he’d be in a flooded with tons of questions. But he’s too focused at the slight ache in his grown and the sense of emptiness you feel after every wank. <br />
<br />
While Andrew was busy picking up the clothes they dropped on the way to the bedroom, Felix gave him a small smile and collapsed back in the bed.<br />
<br />
——<br />
<br />
It would be hours later when Felix woke up to deep throbbing house music from their backyard. Felix realized what it is. It’s Andrew’s house party and he’s fucking late. He could come over there which is the right thing to do since he was invited. Or he could just chill down at the house and eat more mac and cheese.</p>
