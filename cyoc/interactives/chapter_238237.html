<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sitting in S.P.E.A.R’s medical bay, Yuriko now pressed an ice pack to her head. The brother and sister may have escaped, but the mission itself was a complete failure.<br />
<br />
“Were you able to read Casseus mind?”<br />
<br />
Yuriko glanced up, seeing a concerned look on Nat’s face. “Not even close,” Yuriko grumbled, touching the lump forming on her head. She winced at the pain, quickly pressing the ice pack down. “He was powerful, too powerful! We were nothing more than a nuisance to him.”<br />
<br />
“Any idea how that happened Nat,” Tom asked as he flexed his arm, testing the bandage fixed around his bicep. Nat shook her head no. Casseus increased magical energies were a mystery. “No,” she said. “But I think I know someone who can.”<br />
<br />
Making a call, Nat now asked for Dr. Alexander Ivy to report to medical bay. It only took a moment before the doctor entered, Yuriko and Tom now appraising the man.<br />
<br />
Dr. Ivy looked to be around Nat’s age. Pale and thin, Dr. Ivy resemble a prototypical mad scientist, his pale blonde hair mussed, wispy facial hair from countless days without sleep, his white lab coat drab and a mechanical device with six robotic arms attached to his back. Tom assumed the device was a backpack but he wouldn’t put it past the man that he surgically attached it to himself. “What is it Agent MacGregor,” Ivy sighed in annoyance. “I’m trying to finish my experiment and Amanda is expecting me home for dinner.”<br />
<br />
“Need some info Alex,” Nat stated. “What can you tell me about Casseus?”<br />
<br />
Ivy fidgeted, the name unsettling the man. At one time, Dr. Alexander Ivy worked for the Normal. Daring his time under their employ he designed many a biological and mechanical device that helped the Normal almost takeover the world. Since defecting he had used his talents to assist S.P.E.A.R. Those inventions greatly assisted S.P.E.A.R in their work, including his wife Amanda Wong.<br />
<br />
“C..Casseus,” Ivy stammered. “H..he would work closely with the science division in the Normal. Alot of his theories and experiments were....unethical.”<br />
<br />
“Define unethical,” Tom asked.<br />
<br />
“He was obsessed with discovering humans connections to the mystical via genetics,” Ivy continued. “He believed he could use science and sorcery to either disconnect someone from their...mystical abilities or....add to his own.”<br />
<br />
“Add to his own,” Yuriko asked in confusion.<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Ivy shuddered. “He believed he could absorb someone’s magic and add it to his own. I...I saw him perform some of those experiments. He...he experimented on humans. Trying to test his theories. Alot of test subjects didn’t survive, so he would....dispose of the evidence.”<br />
<br />
Tom and Yuriko shuddered. Chances were Yuriko may have been one of those test subjects and she didn’t realize it.<br />
<br />
“Alex.” Nat said softly. “I know it’s difficult to talk about. I know you’ve already talked about this before, but we’re hoping you can offer us anything.”<br />
<br />
“Of course,” said Ivy. Taking a breath the man now composed himself before gazing at Nat. “What can I help you with?”<br />
<br />
“Do you know if Casseus had any issues with the Morelands?”<br />
<br />
“The Morelands,” Ivy asked, raising an eyebrow. “No nothing comes to mind. At the time Casseus was trying to position himself as the Boss’s second in command. Unfortunately for him, the Boss’s protege Rick Morgan was quickly gaining favor. Everyone knew it, I remember Casseus being furious about that.”<br />
<br />
“Why is that,” Tom asked. “And who was Rick Morgan.”<br />
<br />
“He was a dark wizard,” Nat frowned. “I faced him along with Casseus towards the end of our fight with the Normal. Rick was a powerful wizard, figured out how to absorb magic from other like a leech. I heard he even turned a demon into an angel. He’s dead though, they found his body about a month after the Boss was defeated. Body was so decomposed they could only identify him by dental records and couldn’t figure out the cause of death.”<br />
<br />
“Did this Rick guy know anything about the Morelands,” Nat asked.<br />
<br />
“Possibly,” Ivy replied, rubbing his chin. “He and Casseus worked together instigating the vampire civil war before they had a falling out. It’s possible he could have something to do with the Morelands?”<br />
<br />
“Which is stuff we already knew,” Tom sighed. “And with Rick dead we’re back to square one.” Tom now rubbed his eyes before continuing. “Do you know anything else?”<br />
<br />
“I was just a scientist,” Ivy shrugged. “The Boss wanted me to create weapons for him and I did. I wasn’t really part of the planning process.”<br />
<br />
Tom and Yuriko grunted in annoyance. Everything Ivy told them was information they had, there had to be something else.<br />
<br />
“Wait,” Ivy said quickly, the man’s eyes going wide. Obvious something trigger a memory. “Their might be someone but I’m not too sure how to get in touch with her?”<br />
<br />
“Who is it,” Yuriko asked.<br />
<br />
“Her name is Dr. Katherine Eastly,” Ivy stated. “She was one of the lead scientists for the Boss. She would sit in on all the meetings. But good luck finding her?”<br />
<br />
“Why is that,” asked Nat.<br />
<br />
“Because she vanished,” Ivy replied. “Along with a few other scientists. Rumor was she followed Hinata into the kitsune realm, but they were just rumors. If anyone would know anything about what Casseus knew, it’d be her.”<br />
<br />
Tom and Yuriko nodded, realizing that if they ever wished to solve this mystery, they would need Dr. Katherine Eastly.<br />
<br />
******************************<br />
<br />
Having finished yet another interview, Casseus now made his way back towards his office. While security had been increased, the dark wizard was more interesting in how the story would affect his profit margins. With luck, revenue would go up by a few percentage points based solely on pity.<br />
<br />
At that idea, Casseus could only chuckle. People were so easily swayed by a sob story. Entering his office, Casseus paused as he noticed the man sitting in his chair.<br />
<br />
“Geshp.”<br />
<br />
“Hello Casseus,” Geshp grinned, the devil dragging a finger along the oak desk. “You seem to be doing well.”<br />
<br />
“What are you doing here Agent Geshp,” Casseus growled. “And how did you get in here?”<br />
<br />
Geshp grinned ear to ear, the devil rising to his feet as he smoothed his expensive suit. “Oh I have my ways,” he mused. “We both know that. That, though, is of little consequence.”<br />
<br />
Geshp now strolled through the office, examining various trinkets scattered throughout the office. “I saw the news,” he said. “You seem to have had a bit of excitement in your life recently.”<br />
<br />
“Is that why S.P.E.A.R sent you,” Casseus asked, his voice dripping with venom.<br />
<br />
“Oh I’m here as an independent arbiter,” Geshp replied quickly. “Director Meyers has no knowledge that I am here. Nor will she.”<br />
<br />
“So why waste my time?”<br />
<br />
“I think we both know why I am here,” Geshp grinned.<br />
<br />
Casseus grunted in annoyance, well aware of Geshp’s presence. The attack by the Harris siblings had drawn attention from certain sources. Obviously S.P.E.A.R was watching him closely, for what though he still wasn’t quite sure. “Quit playing games Geshp,” he grumbled. “What does S.P.E.A.R want?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing from you,” Geshp stated. “But, they are more interested in what happened with Connor Moreland and Rick.”<br />
<br />
Casseus paused, doing a double take at the devil. He hadn’t thought of Rick and Connor in years. Now, he began to understand why the devil was in his office. “You’re trying to cover your tracks,” Casseus smiled.<br />
<br />
“Our tracks Casseus,” Geshp corrected. “Remember, without my interference with my sister. You wouldn’t have had such an easy time eliminating Rick.”<br />
<br />
“Doubtful,” Casseus scoffed.<br />
<br />
Geshp chuckled softly, shaking his head much to Casseus annoyance. “Vanity,” he sighed. “One of my favorite sins. Regardless what you believe though, my assistance is why you now sit in this expensive office.”<br />
<br />
“I paid my debt devil,” Casseus replied, pointing to the ring on Geshps finger. “I owe you nothing.”<br />
<br />
“You misunderstand me Casseus,” Geshp replied. “I’m trying to save you a headache. Afterall, we both know it was Rick’s plan to attack the Moreland boy. That is what S.P.E.A.R is after, not you.”<br />
<br />
“They’ll never find anything,” said Casseus. “And if they do, we both know our little deal will become common knowledge.”<br />
<br />
Geshp began to chuckle, the devils ink black eyes focusing on Casseus. “If you think that I haven’t taken steps to ensure my innocence in this matter than you are dumber than I thought. At the end of the day Casseus, I’ve built up a stellar reputation within S.P.E.A.R. I am far more believable than you. We both know that.”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps you are right,” Casseus replied. “And while I doubt you would be found innocent. I am willing to listen to suggestions?”<br />
<br />
“Perhaps it is time for Rick’s misdeeds to see the light of day,” Geshp mused. “Afterall, that is all S.P.E.A.R is after. If they were to learn who truly perpetrated the attack on Connor Moreland, then it should leave you be to conduct your business.”<br />
<br />
“And after burying those secrets for so long how would you intend for evidence to magically appear,” Casseus asked.<br />
<br />
“You’re smart Casseus,” Geshp shrugged. “You’ll figure it out.”<br />
<br />
Casseus scowled, watching as the devil now placed a piece of paper on his desk. “Still,” Geshp grinned. “I’m unwilling to bet on your intelligence. Maybe this will help you get started. I’m sure this missing piece of evidence will give you ideas.”<br />
<br />
Casseus now picked up the paper, furrowing his brow as he saw a name and location of the vampire Hannibal.<br />
<br />
“Just remember I was never here,” Geshp called. “Good luck Casseus. You’re going to need it.”</p>
