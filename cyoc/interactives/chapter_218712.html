<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Josh had to be carefully helped toward the couch, all the while Penny under his arm helping him with all the care in the world and in heaven. <br />
<br />
“Thanks.” Said Josh as he sat down on the couch with a wince of pain. “I really wish I could have some of that wine, or maybe something stronger but the drugs you know.”<br />
<br />
“Not a problem.” Reassured Rachel “Thanks for standing up to dad.”<br />
<br />
“Not a problem, my only issue is that you know he will get away with it.” Stated Josh “He has done so our entire lives.”<br />
<br />
“I wish you would have told me just how big of a monster he was.” Said Penny kneeling in front of her boyfriend, placing a gentle hand on his black and blue cheek.<br />
<br />
“He is the devil himself.” Cursed Josh<br />
<br />
“Please, don’t insult the Lucifer by comparing him to your father.” Stated Astaroth as Josh looked at the two women he didn’t know.<br />
<br />
One was Maisy, he had never met her in person because he had to meet in secret just to keep in contact with his sister. At school there were so many of his dad’s friend’s kids who gossiped like it was going out of fashion and if they saw him with his sister and her girlfriend their would be hell to pay. He had been caught once meeting with Rachel but a lie that he was trying to get her back to the faith and on the path of good had earned him only a stern talking to by his father. <br />
<br />
The other one, was a beautiful woman with fire red hair and a whole lot of jewelry. She seemed a little out of place, but she did share some features with Maisy so maybe they where related. <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you finally Josh.” introduced Maisy <br />
<br />
“Nice to meet you as well, I just wish it was under a better situation.” Groaned Josh as he leaned back.<br />
<br />
“You better see if there is a hotel you two can stay at Rachel, I have a feeling Dad will be coming here to confront you about your engagement.” Advised Josh<br />
<br />
“Let him try.” Scoffed Astaroth “I would almost welcome it, Iron Knight or not.”<br />
<br />
“Iron Knight?” inquired Josh confused.<br />
<br />
“He is an Iron Knight?” inquired Penny in a mixture of shock and horror. “He is one of those violent madmen killing in my father&#39;s name?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, a rising star in fact.” Confirmed Astaroth <br />
<br />
“Ok….what is going on?” inquired Josh<br />
<br />
“Josh, you can’t freak out ok.” Stated Rachel “But you know how Dad always claimed that Maisy was leading me to hell, well he wasn’t totally wrong.”<br />
<br />
“What?” inquired Josh confused.<br />
<br />
“She is a demon Josh, an actual demon a Princess of Hell daughter of Lucifer and only a few hours ago I was having dinner with them in hell.” Explained Rachel “She didn’t come to Earth to temp anyone but to find love and I am the lucky one she picked.”<br />
<br />
“Ok…did I hit my head or something?” inquired Josh <br />
<br />
“Show him, Maisma.” Ordered Astaroth as Maisy nodded her head.<br />
<br />
“Alright, Aunt Astaroth.” As Maisy stepped back as her body began to change, her body grew much larger as a pair of antlers grew from her head, a pair of goat or deer legs replaced her normal human legs before a pair of wings unfolded behind her. <br />
<br />
“My God.” Said Josh as he gave himself the sign of the cross before looking at his sister who hadn’t reacted at all. Then he noticed that Jenny wasn’t freaking out either. “Penny, are you seeing this or I am just crazy?”<br />
<br />
“You are not crazy Josh and know this I didn’t want to lie to you but I didn’t really have a choice either.” Stated Penny as she pressed her hand against the swollen black eye. A white glow formed over her hand, as warmth filled Josh’s face as the black eye disappeared at once. She took a deep breath and stood up. “Please don’t freak out.”<br />
<br />
Then her body began to change, she grew taller as well going from just a hair above 5ft to a hair above 6ft. That was still tiny compared to Maisy or even her sister. Her hair remained the same shade of light brown but it was slightly longer now, just long enough to brush her breasts, which were larger as well. Going from A cups to at least a C if not larger. Her frame grew a bit as he hands and legs became shapelier as well. Her ears did become pointed reminding Rachel of the popular imagery of fantasy elves she still even had the same earrings on each ear. Her whole body was giving off a slight glow as two pairs of bird-like wings, each one a rich warm light pink with some white mixed in grew out of her back. The top set was slightly longer being able to touch both walls at the same time, the bottom set smaller but only by around 18 inches, her clothes became a sort of cloth pinkish sundress with a slash around her hip, her purse no hung from that along with a book which had seamed to have appeared out of nowhere. A golden pinkish white halo which went well now pink eyes formed over her head. She still even had the glasses on; however, they had turned from a simple thin black frame affair to the same frame but in a rich silver color. If she was a cute sexy librarian before she was beyond a supermodel sexy librarian now.<br />
<br />
“See, I was lying my name isn’t Penny it is Lady Penemue, 19th daughter of God and Chief Liberian of the holy archivers in the eternal city of light in heaven.” explained Penemue with a blush as she looked away from Josh like a scared teenager on their first date. “I hope you aren’t too angry with me for lying to you about what I am.”<br />
<br />
“You’re an angel an actual angel?” inquired Josh “And a daughter of God, himself?”<br />
<br />
“Yes, some would call me a Princess, but I don’t rule over lands in heaven like my sisters and brothers, I just rule over the holy archives, I record all the high meetings in heaven, doing research and manage things like that.” explained Penemue with some embarrassment. “I am not one of those angels in human media who fight demons or rescue people, I am a Librarian.”<br />
<br />
“Heaven and Hell have actually been at peace since the early 400 AC.” explained Maisy “My brother and her sister actually got married and now rule purgatory together. They are not at war at all anymore, well besides who can spoil their shared granddaughter the most that is.”<br />
<br />
“None of that is in any holy book.” stated Josh<br />
<br />
“You would be amazed at how wrong some books are.” Stated Penemue “I had to fight the need to correct the human version of them when I was reading them, but so many records where lost. That is what I do as miracles on Earth, I actually took the entire Libery of Alexandria and others like it before they were destroyed. I have them up there.”<br />
<br />
“So you’re an actual angel and you’re a demon.” Said Josh pointing at Penemue and Maisy.<br />
<br />
“In truth, big brother you and mom are the only humans in this apartment.” explained Rachel “When I agreed to marry Maisy, I agreed to become a demon which I have become already. We are only here currently to fake our deaths before we move down to the 9th circle of hell.”<br />
<br />
“You’re a demon?” inquired Josh looking at his sister who nodded her head in confirmation before looking at Astaroth. <br />
<br />
“And I am Archduchess Astaroth, sister of Lucifer King of Hell and your mother’s former girlfriend and” said Astaroth gave Rebecca’s hand a gentle loving squeeze. “And if your mother doesn’t change her mind your future step-mother.”<br />
<br />
“I am going to hell as well Josh to be with Astaroth, I turned her down when I was in college to marry your father at your grandparents request.” Explained Rebecca “I was too afraid to come out of the closet but I am going to do so now, I suffered too much on Earth, I want to have happiness in hell.”<br />
<br />
Josh looked at his mom in totally shock, first to find out his mom was a lesbian and now that she was going to go to Hell become a demon to marry her ex girlfriend who was the sister of Lucifer was a lot to take in. That was on top of his sister marrying Lucifer’s daughter and that she was already a demon and that he was dating an actual angel. <br />
<br />
“Which leads us to a very serious question.” stated Penemue her voice shaking a bit as she got down on one knee before Josh. On one knee she was about the same height as Josh sitting down. “I love you Josh, love you more then any book I have ever read and that is a lot of books. I would have liked to have waited but would you marry me?”<br />
<br />
Josh blinked.<br />
<br />
“Before you answer yes or no Josh, you have to know something.” Said Rachel “Heaven and Hell have a treaty, when a mortal finds out about one of their number and has been proposed to, they either say yes and become a member of that group. In my case I became a demon when I said yes to Maisy, in your case saying yes would make you an angel. If you say no….you die and then they deal with your soul accordingly. Knowing you a few years in hell, everyone goes there it turns out before either going to heaven or if you want being reborn on Earth in a new body.”<br />
<br />
Josh considered this was a hard choice, he loved Penny more then anything but they had only been dating four months. <br />
Suddenly the door to the bedroom opened as two more figures walked out. <br />
<br />
“Remeila what did dad say?” inquired Penemue<br />
<br />
“What did my brother say?” inquired Astaroth<br />
<br />
Both of them shared a look.<br />
<br />
“We are to return at once to either Heaven or Hell depending on what we want to do.” Explained Charon<br />
 <br />
 “I have never seen dad this angry when he learned you had been hit Renemue, not even when found out I married Charon.” added Remeila shaking her head.<br />
<br />
“They are preparing for war against the Iron Knights in general and Rev. Church impartial.” announced Charon “But Heaven and Hell are preparing for war to fight together. I think the bigger debate will be on who gets to punish Rev. Church’s soul for all time.”<br />
Remeila nodded her head in agreement before turned her gaze toward Josh.<br />
<br />
“Our father was very impressed that you protected his daughter Josh, he would welcome you at once into the family if you should choice.” Proclaimed Remeila <br />
<br />
“So Josh what do you say? Will you marry me?” inquired Penemue with some fear in her voice as everyone await his choice.</p>
