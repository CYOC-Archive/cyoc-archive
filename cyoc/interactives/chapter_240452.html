<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jennifer went to the school and tried her best to be more active during the recess. She picked more sport-like activities like basketball and football. During one of these recess hours Jennifer went secretly inside the boys locker room and noticed how manly everything looked. Jennifer hoped to find something to take to her home. She investigated at every piece of small thing she could spot and finally found a jackpot.<br />
<br />
One of the boys had left his two dumbbells and similar weightlifting gear openly in one of the lockers. Jennifer hatched a plan and was ready to “borrow” the pair of dumbbells with her as Jennifer&#39;s school day was near it&#39;s end. Jennifer approached the locker room’s door and smelled that boy’s socks inside the small locker stinking like sweat and opened bag of cheetos left on sun. The smell was so bad that Jennifer had to force herself to pick the two dumbbells and put them inside her backpack. Jennifer then noticed people approaching the locker room and with a very swift movement she crawled under the benches and lockers so that she couldn’t been seen.<br />
<br />
Jennifer heard older boys taking their equipment, socks and other gear off by throwing them on the ground on top of Jennifer’s field of view. The sweaty smell became stronger on volume. Jennifer had hard time breathing as the smell of feet and socks gave out a strong scent which penetrated Jennifer’s nostrils. She wanted to run away but she didn’t want to cause a scene. She had to control her breathing and get used to the stinky and sweaty feet smell. The boys spent too much time together which caused Jennifer to get anxious from the fear of getting caught. She ruminated on a thought that she might be spotted at any minute if they noticed a nerdy girl inside boy’s locker room under their noses. Which would cause her to be year younger.<br />
<br />
Twenty minutes later the boys left the locker room and Jennifer could easily slip out of the door to the next class which is her own PE class. During her own class she tried to be more active, friendly and sporty as she tried to do her usual routine as a cheerleader. One of her teacher’s said that Jennifer might have talent as cheerleader in the future and she agreed with that sentiment. Jennifer hoped that tomorrow she could regain her lost body and be more sporty. But something kept bugging Jennifer mind. It was the locker room.<br />
<br />
This rumination continued to the point she got home and she could sense that something clicked inside her body. A change that she wasn’t sure if she wanted to welcome into her life. Jennifer quickly ate her dinner and told her mother that she’s going to make some noise as she had as a homework to make some exercise routine. It was a lie. Jennifer wanted an excuse to workout without worry while not cause any trouble for her mother. Jennifer took her stolen dumbbells and started a 4-minute exercise routine inside her room. Jennifer did it three times with lots of water by her side until she got sweaty and hit the showers.<br />
<br />
She repeated the same set before washing her teeth and quickly rinsing her body with light soapy water before hitting her bed in pajamas. Jennifer felt super sleepy that night and woke up to a new morning.<br />
<br />
She felt that something was off about that morning as she hopped out of the bed. From the full body mirror she had in her room. Jennifer noticed that she had gotten a year older but she had also gotten bulkier. She had visible muscles on her thighs, calves and biceps.<br />
<br />
“I think went too far.” Jennifer snickered as she looked at her bulky body. “But I don’t think this is a bad thing. I look like a beginner level football player than a cheerleader. Maybe if I stop now and just keep my average routine more light I might maintain my acrobatic body and loose this athletic body but then again...”<br />
<br />
Then Jennifer noticed her cut hair which was now on her shoulder length. Jennifer looked like a tomboy with light spread of muscles than a nerd like she was yesterday, or yesteryear, so to speak. She looked like gym influencer who went to the gym once per two weeks or a girl who&#39;s hobby was &#39;casual sports&#39; like skating. It was another 180 degree of change in her life. The dumbbells in her room had gotten heavier and bigger than the last time she saw them. Still Jennifer was easily able to lift them above her head as she spotted a minor change. She had flat stomach which had a very hint of abs showing. The small exercise routine had evolved into a full blown routine she was now doing. Jennifer thought that if she continued like this she could one day by more muscular than lean. Lastly she spotted her changed pajamas. Jennifer had more athletic wear on her like a sports bra looking tank top and comfortable half-cut sweatpants that showed her bulky calves pretty visibly.<br />
<br />
Jennifer spun her head and looked at her normal looking room. There had to be more changes she hadn&#39;t spotted like with her pajamas. Jennifer tried best to investigate what other things had changed with her life. There was nagging feeling that it something obvious but she couldn’t put her finger on it what it was. She looked at her own feet, then the room&#39;s floor, then the walls and then at her desk and bed.<br />
<br />
‘What has changed. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m seeing it but I just can&#39;t tell what it is...’ Jennifer wondered herself.</p>
<hr/><h3>What do you do now?</h3>
