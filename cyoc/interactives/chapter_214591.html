<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">They had only been on the road for a few minutes when Jasmine heard hoofbeats.  Soon, the horse and rider appeared.  To Jasmine’s delight, the rider was none other than Anya.  She was riding a light brown mare that Jasmine didn’t recognize, though she didn’t know all the horses in the royal stables, and had something slung across her back.  Anya’s eyes lit up at the sight of Jasmine.  She came alongside the wagon.  Jasmine could see that Anya had changed out of her concubine’s uniform and into a maid’s.<br />
<br />
“Sister, I have found you!” Anya said to Jasmine.  Jasmine beamed.  She turned to Simon.<br />
<br />
“Please, may we stop?  This is my sister Anya.”<br />
<br />
“Very well,” Simon grumbled.  He instructed the boy to stop.  Once they had, Jasmine got down from the wagon, the former rebel still suckling from her breast.  “What are you doing, girl?”<br />
<br />
“I will join my sister so we may travel to our family’s home together.  I will not impose upon you any longer,” Jasmine said.  Simon looked doubtful.<br />
<br />
“Are you ladies certain you need no male chaperone?” he asked.  Anya and Jasmine nodded.  Simon sighed.  “Very well.  Best of luck on your travels, then.”  He instructed the boy to start the wagon again, and soon they faded into the distance.  Anya dismounted from her horse.<br />
<br />
“Come with me.  We can speak in a private clearing I know nearby,” she said.  She led Jasmine and her horse off the road and into the woods.  When they got to the clearing, she tied her horse to a tree and sat upon the ground.  Jasmine sat as well.  “I will tell you what I have experienced since the rebels stormed the palace, but I would like to hear your story first.”  Jasmine immediately told her concubine everything.  Anya nodded slowly when she finished.  “I am glad that my amulet worked so well to protect you.”<br />
<br />
“It most certainly did.  Now, tell me your tale.”<br />
<br />
“I would have left the palace soon enough to go through the Eastern Gate, but was delayed by a few difficulties,” Anya said.  “First, the rebels somehow knew there was a concubine of witch stock, as they sent a witch of their own to find and neutralize me.”  Jasmine gasped.  “Luckily, the witch they sent, Antyny Brightstone, was not as powerful nor practiced as I.  I was able to get the upper hand.”<br />
<br />
“I know Antyny Brightstone,” Jasmine said quietly.  “He was my closest friend when we were younger.  But when it was discovered he was dyeing his hair to hide that he was a witch, he and his family were banished from the palace.”<br />
<br />
“Well, he is right here,” Anya said brightly.  She took the item off her back, revealing a baby with blonde hair.  “Or rather, she.  I transformed her into a female infant, much like the amulet did to the rebel that tried to have his way with you.  Oh, a rebel also tried to have his way with me.”<br />
<br />
“No!”<br />
<br />
“Yes.  When I went to the stables for a steed to ride to safety, a rebel grabbed me and attempted to take advantage of me.  I know not what his name was, but her name is now Sandy.”  Anya smiled at the mare she was riding earlier.  Jasmine’s jaw dropped.<br />
<br />
“You transformed the rebel into a mare?”<br />
<br />
“I needed a horse.  Though I slowed myself down somewhat by allowing the finest stallions in the stables to mate with Sandy before I left.  Turnabout is fair play, after all,” Anya said idly.<br />
<br />
“Is- is she aware?” Jasmine asked hesitantly.<br />
<br />
“Oh, of course!  If she did not recall who she once was, there would be no use allowing the stallions to mount her!  A mindless mare would like it, a formerly male human would not.”<br />
<br />
“Why is she behaving so well, then?”  The mare was calmly grazing.<br />
<br />
“Because she knows with this type of magic, only the witch who cast the spell can remove it.  And I will only remove the spell if she behaves herself,” Anya said.  Jasmine felt somewhat unnerved by how callous Anya was being.  But then again, a would-be rapist did deserve punishment.<br />
<br />
“How aware are the babies?” Jasmine asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh, completely unaware,” Anya said firmly.  Jasmine sighed in relief.  “Other than you, those the amulet transforms will be unaware of their pasts.  Otherwise, it would not be as effective a protection.  For similar reasons, Antyny recalls not who she used to be.”  Anya smiled at the babe in her arms.  “I should name her something new.  How about Brittyny?  It holds to her old name somewhat.”<br />
<br />
“Very nice,” Jasmine agreed.  She inspected the former rebel in her arms, curious if he was still a he.  The babe she held had been unmanned as well.  “Perhaps Bry for this one.”<br />
<br />
“With names like those, they should be twins,” Anya said.  She held out her hand.  “Give her to me.”  Jasmine handed the baby, now named Bry, over.  Anya placed a hand on Bry.  Bry glowed white briefly before shrinking to the same size as Brittyny.  “There!  Now they are twins!”<br />
<br />
“Very nice, but Anya, we must make a plan for our escape,” Jasmine said desperately.  Anya smiled at her reassuringly.<br />
<br />
“Not to worry, my prince.  Or rather, Jasmine.  We will be able to flee to my home in the Eastern Hills town of Wind’s Grove with no problem as long as we have a good cover.  And I have come up with the perfect cover.”<br />
<br />
“What?” Jasmine asked.  In lieu of a response, Anya placed her hand on Jasmine.  There was a flash of light.  When the light cleared, Jasmine’s wet nurse uniform had been replaced by a simple yet tasteful blue gown and her hair, which was now black, was neatly braided once more.<br />
<br />
“Your royal red hair is beautiful, but will attract too much attention,” Anya lamented.  “Now, however, it will not stand out and will also match Bry.  Speaking of Bry, you must take her and Brittyny so I may apply my own cover.”  Jasmine took Bry and Brittyny from her.  Anya stood.  There was a flash of white light.  When the light cleared, Anya had been replaced by a man just as handsome as Anya was beautiful.  His blond hair was thick and full, his blue eyes astonishingly gorgeous, his face perfectly shaped, his shoulders broad, and his height tall.  He wore the simple but fine clothes of a man who did not work outside.  The man that had been Anya bowed.  “You may call me Anton while I am in this shape.”<br />
<br />
“Why have you taken the form of a man?” Jasmine asked.  Anton smiled.<br />
<br />
“So we may pose as a married couple.”<br />
<br />
“Married?!”  Jasmine looked down at her hands.  Sure enough, she wore a wedding band now.  “What-”<br />
<br />
“Until we arrive at my family’s home in Wind’s Grove, I am Anton Dixon and you are my wife Jasmine.  We are parents to the two-month-old twin girl children Bry and Brittyny.  We are fleeing the Capitol due to the violence.  We ran a bookshop together and are returning to my family’s home.  That part will remain the same.”<br />
<br />
“I would prefer to be the husband,” Jasmine muttered.<br />
<br />
“I know, my prince,” Anton sighed.  “But this is the safest option.”<br />
<br />
“I understand.”<br />
<br />
“Now, we must find a place to stay for the night,” Anton said.  “Hopefully we can find a building, but if we cannot, I know of a cave nearby.  It will not be particularly comfortable, but it will be safe.”  He helped Jasmine stand.  “You may ride Sandy, as the babies need to be fed.  I am glad the amulet granted you such productive breasts.”  Jasmine blushed.<br />
<br />
Anton helped Jasmine mount the mare, then instructed her how to ride side saddle.  Once she was sitting properly, he gave her Bry and Brittyny.  Jasmine bared her breasts for them.  The babes immediately latched onto the offered nipples and began to nurse hungrily.  Anton then took Sandy’s reins and led her back to the road.  They resumed their travels down the road, searching for shelter for the night.</p>
