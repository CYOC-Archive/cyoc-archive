<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jen slowly became aware of a glowing, swirling mist flowing everywhere. She couldn&#39;t feel or see her body. Jen realized she wasn&#39;t actually seeing the mist, but somehow sensing it directly with her mind. She tried to speak, to open her eyes, wave her hands, but nothing happened. <br />
<br />
&#39;Great,&#39; she thought, &#39;if this is Kyle&#39;s idea of a fantasy world, he&#39;s got less imagination than I gave the nerd credit for.&#39;<br />
<br />
Out of boredom Jen imagined poking at the mist with her mind. The mist swirled a bit before resuming it&#39;s random drifting. After a lot of experimention, not like there was much else for her to do, Jen succeeded pulling most of the mist around her into a tight ball.<br />
<br />
In the center of the ball there were twinkling lights. Jen tried to get a better &quot;look&quot; by bringing the ball closer to where she thought her mind was. The lights were droplets, each showing a distorted reflection of a forest.<br />
<br />
Jen kept trying, and eventually got the droplets to combine into a single globe of liquid. Reflected in it were trees and bushes, and the occasional creature. These at least looked suitably fantastic: scaled lizards flying on bat-like wings, slime balls oozing around, a creature like a deer but made of smoke and glowing embers.<br />
<br />
Jen learned to turn her vantage point to &quot;see&quot; other directions, and eventually to send it drifting through the forest. As she did she encountered more mist which she pulled into her globe. By the time she found her first &quot;person&quot; in the forest, Jen&#39;s globe was quite large, and developing speckles.<br />
<br />
At first Jen ignored the speckles. Here finally was an inhabitant of Kyle&#39;s world! It was a woman, somewhere between three and five feet tall, as best Jen could tell. She carried a bow and arrows, and was &quot;dressed&quot; in nothing more than a crude leather vest. She was also not human. She had tufted furry ears, a pronounced overbite, and a bushy gray squirrel tail proportional to her body. She also had several pairs of comically large boobs in a line down her torso. The vest protected the sides of them from her bow string, but left all her nipples exposed.<br />
<br />
&#39;Ugh, how juvenile!&#39; Jen thought to herself. &#39;Of course any world created by a teenage boy would feature multi-breasted females with huge boobs who walk around mostly naked.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jen followed the woman as she hunted the flying lizards, growing irritated as the reflection in her globe grew cloudy and dim. That was when Jen noticed two things: that her globe was shrinking, and that the speckles were tiny crystals.<br />
<br />
Jen spent some time nudging the crystals close to one another to clear the view through her globe. They didn&#39;t combine like the droplets, but she eventually got a few pairs to cling together. She also moved rapidly through the forest to gather as much mist as she could to restore the size of her globe, her window into Kyle&#39;s world. <br />
<br />
In the globe&#39;s reflection, autumn came, winter passed, then spring arrived. Jen took a break from gathering mist and herding crystals to look for the squirel woman&#39;s village.<br />
<br />
Beyond squirrels there were many &quot;people&quot; living in the forest that had other animal attributes: rabbits, foxes, cats, mice, bears, and more. Jen explored widely, pausing to sweep the crystals together when they drifted apart enough to obstruct her vision. Each time a few more clung together.<br />
<br />
After several years, based on the seasonal changes she saw in her reflection, Jen parked her globe near the center of the largest village she&#39;d found. It was where people of all types came to trade, so it was always bustling with something to see. <br />
<br />
She&#39;d learned to pull on the mist and make it stream towards her, so she wasn&#39;t having to move around any more to keep her globe from shrinking. Jen continued working with the crystals, eventually forming them into several clumps that were easy to move around. <br />
<br />
She was intrigued to discover some of the animal-people had mist clinging around them, and when they moved, their mist moved with them. The longer Jen stayed at the trading village, the more mist-covered people gathered there. Jen wasn&#39;t sure if they somehow generated their own mist, or gathered it like she had. Perhaps they&#39;d followed her mist streams to get there?<br />
<br />
Some of them seemed able to move the mist <br />
around themselves the way Jen could, but it always disappeared after they moved it, so Jen wasn&#39;t sure just what they were doing. She couldn&#39;t see droplets around any of them, so they weren&#39;t concentrating it the way she had. The disappearing mist disturbed Jen, so she kept her globe positioned higher in the air than they could reach.<br />
<br />
She considered trying to pull the mist from one of the people into her globe, but was afraid it might hurt them. Mostly Jen was afraid they might somehow make her globe disapear, which would leave her without any entertainment.<br />
<br />
While Jen was distracted trying to get two of her crystal clumps to join, her attention drifted from her globe&#39;s reflection, which settled towards the ground. One of the mist-cloaked people, a tall man with feathers for hair, yellow raptor eyes, and clawed fingers, walked close enough to her globe that the mist around his head brushed its surface. <br />
<br />
For a moment Jen felt the heat of the summer air, smelled the pungent scent of unwashed bodies, heard voices speaking in a language she didn&#39;t know. Jen pulled her globe away, high into the air where the man&#39;s mist couldn&#39;t reach it.<br />
<br />
The man spun around looking in all directions. He waved his arms wildly and seemed to be talking loudly as a crowd gathered around him.<br />
<br />
The animal men were as emphatically male as the women were female, and showed as little concerned about covering themselves. Their lengthy members swung freely, slapping their thighs as they walked. Jen had moved her globe in for a good look a few times in the past, relieved to see even and cat and dog people seemed to have normal human penises, if vastly larger than any normal human&#39;s.<br />
<br />
As the raptor-man spoke to the crowd, his penis became erect, which he made no effort to hide. It stood out from his crotch like a pole, thick and lumpy with veins. After a time he ceased talking and most of the crowd gathered into small groups to talk or returned to what they&#39;d been doing.<br />
<br />
One of the females lingered, and presented her bare ass to the raptor man. She had fox-like features, eight large breasts on her lightly furred torso, and a fluffy white tipped tail she held high to give him a good view of her privates. He put his clawed hands on her hips and inserted his erection into her.<br />
<br />
Jen was shocked how casually the other villagers treated this. Some youths gathered to watch, and after a time other couples began mating as well. Jen noticed that while the females seemed to enjoy it, there wasn&#39;t what she&#39;d consider love-making going on. No foreplay, no petting, almost no talking, and no cuddling afterwards or affection shown between partners.<br />
<br />
Jen moved her globe outside the village and tried to concentrate on her crystals. Had she really shared the raptor man&#39;s senses when they&#39;d touched? Had he shared hers? Was that what got him so aroused? She hadn&#39;t expected one boner to trigger a public orgy, but this was Kyle&#39;s world after all, maybe group sex was the norm and she just hadn&#39;t witnessed it before. <br />
<br />
Jen wondered, if she&#39;d gotten her globe close enough to touch one of the mist-covered people, if she would have shared what they felt as they fucked? Would she have enjoyed it? Jen had never been into voyeurism, but her bodyless state forced her into it out of boredom. <br />
<br />
Since she was just an awareness without a body, there wasn&#39;t anything to react to her thoughts, other than the mist. Jen noticed as she imagined what sex as an animal person might be like, the crystals in her globe vibrated a bit, and the clumps settled into more compact shapes.<br />
<br />
Jen moved her globe back to the village but all of the couples had finished mating. The raptor man and several other misty people, all male Jen noted, were gathered talking. Jen tried touching her globe to a cute rabbit woman, but without mist of her own Jen&#39;s globe just passed through her.<br />
<br />
Eventually Jen found a bear woman with a cloud of mist around her. The connection was brief. For a moment Jen felt the woman&#39;s hunger, her sore joints & back, how tired she was. The woman lumbered away, shaking her head. She didn&#39;t seem inclined to mate with anyone afterwards.<br />
<br />
After that Jen spent several years observing different villages. Most animal people, she discovered, only mated certain times of the year, though the younger ones did it more often. The ones with mist around them tended to be older, and less inclined to mate. <br />
<br />
Whenever Jen could, she touched her globe to misty females as they had sex. They were usually too distracted to take serious notice of her, or at least didn&#39;t try to get away like the bear woman had. Jen grew to enjoy the sensation of having multiple oversized tits slapping together as enormous cocks stretched her pussy and filled her with hot semen. Her crystals got a bit denser each time, though for a while she wasn&#39;t paying attention to them, just hunting for her next vicarious lay.<br />
<br />
As years passed, Jen grew adept at timing her visits to the villages to partake of their seasonal orgies. She delighted every time a new female began gathering mist, knowing in time they&#39;d be orgasming together again and again. <br />
<br />
As she moved her globe away from the rabbit people village, a frequent stop in Jen&#39;s rounds, Jen noticed a spark in the heart of her crystal. After enjoying so much second-hand sex, Jen&#39;s crystals had finally become a single dense crystal faceted like a gem. In its heart a flicker of light danced.<br />
<br />
Jen no longer had to consciously think about gathering mist, it followed to her from across the vast forest. Instead of forming separate crystals, new layers formed on the surface of her jewel, while in its heart the flame grew stronger.<br />
<br />
More years passed in the forest. Some of the mist cloaked women, the ones Jen most enjoyed touching as they mated, began traveling with Jen&#39;s globe as she traveled from orgy to orgy. As they became pregnant they&#39;d return to their home villages to raise their children, and others would take their place.<br />
<br />
Jen slowly learned to understand the animal people&#39;s language. She discovered they worshipped her as a goddess of fertility. The women whose orgasms she shared thought of themselves as her priestesses. Jen learned to leave a tiny droplet of her globe in each priestess, sharing their lives and learning from them how to make the mist affect their world.<br />
<br />
The animal people could only perceive mist directly when sharing Jen&#39;s senses, but the magic they practiced used mist as its fuel. Jen had been perceiving and concentrating magical energy all this time!<br />
<br />
Eventually second-hand orgasms, even from dozens of her priestesses at once, wasn&#39;t enough to satisfy Jen. She focused her magic and willed it to create a body for her to inhabit.<br />
