<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Her drive home proved to be remarkably similiar to every other drive home: dark, dull, and entirely uneventful. At the ungodly hours in which she was usually driving home, Jennifer rarely saw anyone else. A car here or there, carrying some graveyard shift worker or a partier heading home, but for the most part, just silence, nothing but the street lights and her own car&#39;s headlamps illuminating the streets. She had grown to find it comforting, in a way, a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the university in the daytime.<br />
<br />
Really, the most remarkable thing on her way home was that her stomach began to rumble. Not surprising either, given how often she forgot to eat these days. There was temptation, slightly stronger than usual, to stop at some fast food place and grab a bite, but her recently-pained wallet ensured that she didn&#39;t act on the urge. Instead, she merely cruised right back to her apartment, settling on a typically-awful parking space and hauling herself up the stairs to her humble abode.<br />
<br />
The place was about as messy as one might expect for a woman working her nightmarish hours. Clothes strewn about, dishes waiting forever and a day to be washed, trash that she barely kept on top of. Her parents would&#39;ve been horrified, but if they knew anything about the state of her project, that would have put them in far worse of a mood; the horrendous state of her personal space was small potatoes by comparison. In any case, she was too tired most days to consider doing much of anything, never mind putting in the work to fix this unholy mess.<br />
<br />
Equally horrifying to them would&#39;ve been her practice of stripping down and wandering the place nude - but screw it, they were well-off. They could actually afford to run the AC. Jennifer was instead left to get undressed tonight, as she did most night, kick on the box fan next to her bed, and veer off to the kitchen for something to eat. Tonight, at least, she was daring, though she couldn&#39;t exactly say why; rather than grabbing one of her usual microwave dinners and throwing that in to be nuked, she grabbed a box of cookies out of the pantry.<br />
<br />
She was already munching on them by the time she flopped down on her bed and flipped on the TV, and at an alarming pace to boot. Huh. Tonight was the night for her sweet tooth to kick in, apparently. She gave it little more though, hazy attention soon focused onto some random nature documentary playing on the television, its content blurred out as her mind wandered. This damn heat, and especially the humidity, had been especially killer this year. Made it hard for her to focus on just about anything when she was home. At least the university had AC running.<br />
<br />
Her mind remained relatively absent as she finished off the cookies, and without really thinking about how much sugar she&#39;d scarfed down, the young woman marched right back into the kitchen to lazily search for something else. Stomach was still feeling a bit empty - that, at least, was unusual. <br />
<br />
What finally pulled her out of this lack of focus, however, was a sharp, growing pain. Two sets of pain, really, each one nestled within her chest. She tried massaging it at first, figuring it was just some random soreness or something, maybe from a bra that had been on too tight, but the pain failed to abate. It was, in fact, getting stronger - her mind flashed back to the bee sting, and she wondered if this was some strange delayed reaction. She&#39;d never heard of bee venom causing pain in that region, but with how much she had mucked about with their DNA, strange symptoms were possible.<br />
<br />
No, no, that was silly. Breat pain from a bee sting - now she was being ridiculous. Shaking her head, she dragged herself over to the cupboard, throwing back an asprin to help deal with pain before she grabbed a couple of sodas and headed back to bed. In pretty short order she was knocking back the caffienated beverages one after another, cursing herself for the inevitable crash but unable to slow herself down.<br />
<br />
When her eyes did eventually shut, it wasn&#39;t out of some sleep that was imminent. It was, in fact, joined by gritting of teeth - the pain had hit a crescendo, bringing with it a heat that her fan was hopeless against. Her whole chest seemed to be on fire, and in desperation her hands started trying to grasp and rub around the affected area - and it was here that she found herself confused. What her hands found purchase on where two breasts that were far, far greater in volume than they should have been. Swelling? Oh god. Maybe this was an allergic reaction after all.<br />
<br />
It might have been wise to call a doctor or rush to a clinic, but in that moment, all Jennifer could think about was her desperate need for relief. Unable to come up with a better idea, she forced herself up, her body sore from writhing around this much, and dragged herself off to the shower. Her water heater had a knack for failing to deliver any warm water, but that was just fine right now; she turned it on full blast, ice hold, heaving her chest under the water in the hope that it might soothe the pain.<br />
<br />
Scientifically, she knew that it probably wouldn&#39;t do that much - but to her surprise, the pain soon began to subside. Just as quickly as it had come, it was falling off - but the heat remained, no matter how much cold water passed over her. Heat, and... fullness. That was the best way to describe the sensation. Like she was carrying something heavy on her front that desperately needed to be released.<br />
<br />
There wasn&#39;t any sort of councious thought behind the way she grabbed her breasts, one in each hand, and squeezed with all the force she could muster. The feeling sent a chill down her spine, one that shocked her into opening her eyes and gazing down at her chest. The orbs in her hands - they utterly dwarfed the flat chest she&#39;d had before. Rich, full curves, entirely natural-looking - that couldn&#39;t be possible. Swelling wouldn&#39;t cause that sort of shape. She tried to analyze things logically, but instinct soon kicked in again, forcing her to squeeze once more.<br />
<br />
The result of this second exercise of force was what finally produced a shocked yell from Jennifer. As soon as she pressed down, she could feel something rushing through her chest, spilling out of her nipples - but it wasn&#39;t milk, as strange as lactation would have been at that moment. Instead, what left her breasts was a pair of sticky golden streams, their aroma overpoweringly sweet. Gooey against her skin, pleasantly so, but entirely foreign to anything that should have come from her body.<br />
<br />
Honey, trailing down her body - and continuing to fill her chest as she felt them swell ever so slightly more.</p>
