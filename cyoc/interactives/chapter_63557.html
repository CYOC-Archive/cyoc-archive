<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Rain, Sunny, Misty and Daniele were typical girls. They were all out to get their MRS. degree and where better <br />
to find the MR. than at a frat party.<br />
<br />
They went to the mall and shopped all day long. Sitting in the food court giving each other little jabs about <br />
what they were eating and how fat they were getting even though not a one was bigger than a size zero.<br />
<br />
They were very shapely.<br />
<br />
The girls headed home and got all dressed up in their new acquisitions and headed to the frat. Rain was in a <br />
nice little baby doll that barely hid her panties. Misty had on an orange pantsuit. Daniele had on a nice long <br />
dress that would be more appropriate at a cotillion. And Sunny was dressed in a nice crimson Chinese dress. <br />
And off they went.<br />
<br />
The four got heads to turn when they stepped through that door and soon they were beset by all sorts of men <br />
(boys) trying to chat them up.<br />
<br />
Rain hooked up with one she thought looked like a brain. Not the best looking, nor the biggest muscular guy <br />
but he seemed like he liked to talk. And being the pretentious sort he won her over.<br />
<br />
Daniele found herself a stoner and got some good shit and sat messed up with him. Eventually collapsing in <br />
each others arms.<br />
<br />
Misty went popping around the house from one guy to the next never finding one to hook up with.<br />
<br />
Sunny on the other hand found her calling. She found the keg where the football players and other jocks were <br />
congregating and boy was she the life of the party. She sat there and giggled at all the stories these boys <br />
had to tell.<br />
<br />
When she woke the next morning she was in a strange bed. Pressed somewhat up against the wall she tried to <br />
nimbly crawl over the mound snoring next to her but he woke as she climbed over him. Where ya goin honey?<br />
<br />
Oh I got to get going.<br />
<br />
Just one more time please?<br />
<br />
No no. I got to get going she continued to crawl over him. As she got to the other side of him and started to <br />
try to crawl off of him he grabbed her and pulled her to a seated position between his legs. She could feel <br />
his rigid cock poking her somewhat in the back. It would have probably poked harder if his belly hadn't hidden <br />
it somewhat. He grabbed hold of her and started to kiss her on the neck. Grabbing her tit and working his <br />
other hand down to her crotch.<br />
<br />
I got to go. She wiggled her way out from his grasp. He stood up and wrapped the bed sheet around his waist <br />
which seemed to be somewhat of a tight fit at his girth. For someone that was 6' and about 320 pounds he was <br />
quite good looking. He had a fairly furry chest and a rugged, lumberjack looking face. If he hadn't been so <br />
tall his legs would have looked longer but he looked like he was being supported by two logs.<br />
<br />
When can I see you again? He asked.<br />
<br />
I'll call you.<br />
<br />
We both know what that means.<br />
<br />
No no I really will call. As she got dressed and almost sprinted out of the house Tony Batson figured he would <br />
never see her again. He was a love sick puppy dog. Someone had really meant something to him. But he didn't <br />
mean anything to her.<br />
<br />
Several months later Tony got a call from Sunny. We got to talk.<br />
<br />
When they met at the McDonalds Tony noticed something different about Sunny. Are you getting fat?<br />
<br />
I think I'm pregnant. Tony's eyes got huge. It was both a look of shock and excitement. He still loved Sunny <br />
and this might be a way for him to get back with her.<br />
<br />
I got to get an abortion.<br />
<br />
I can't do that. Tony said. He had no moral inclination one way or the other he just wanted to use this to <br />
pressure her into marrying him.<br />
<br />
I am going to the clinic and you are going with me. We are going to have an abortion and your going to help me <br />
with it.<br />
<br />
Tony all the way to the clinic tried to talk her out of it. When they went into the Dr and she was examined <br />
there turned out to be a problem with the abortion. It might be possible to have the procedure but she could <br />
die. Her physical body had some problem and it was not advised to have the abortion.<br />
<br />
Tony got down on one knee and asked Sunny to marry him right then and there and she agreed. As she got fatter <br />
so did Tony. Sunny may have been eating for two but it looked like Tony was eating for a whole team. He <br />
ballooned up huge and was in danger of being off the team if it weren't for his agility. <br />
<br />
And Sunny realized what a wonderful man Tony really was.</p>
