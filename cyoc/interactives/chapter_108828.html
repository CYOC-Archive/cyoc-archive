<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jose Quesada, the assistant principle of this elementary school, watched with a smile on her face from the doorway as the kindergarten teacher Ms. Aaronsohn comforted little Timmy Ashton, who was now an adorable little brunette girl with the brightest blue eyes. Jose, and she couldn&#39;t stop thinking of herself as Jose, no matter how much the thoughts in her head was saying her name was June now, had come back from her rounds reminding every class of early dismissal. She could have just done it over the intercom, but in this fucked up new reality, she just HAD to see how everyone she passed by in the halls everyday had suddenly transformed. <br />
<br />
Jose herself had seemingly hit the attractiveness lottery. Despite being mildly bewitching as a man, he was by no means a pushover as far as getting dates was concerned, as a woman she was stunning. Her long, silky hair, soft perfect skin, youthful face, and large breasts would make her the envy of any vain woman in the old world. In the new world however...well, Ms. Aaronsohn, who had been nothing to write home about before, was now the epitome of a shy nerdy girl who also happened to have supermodel good looks. Jose had a feeling that hotness was going to be the new norm. <br />
<br />
Ms. Aaronsohn let Timmy go so she could meet her mother at the front door of the school, who picked Timmy up every day.  She saw Ms. Quesada&#39;s eyes focused lustfully on her and stood up from her crouch. Jose entered the kindergarten room, its brightness and cheerfulness obfuscating the massive, world changing events which had just transpired. For a moment, she just stared at the new woman&#39;s breasts and lost track of time...<br />
<br />
&quot;I really love your outfit&quot; said Ms. Aaronsohn nervously, pulling Ms. Quesada out of her daydream, pointing at Jose&#39;s black dress which accentuated her every curve.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I guess&quot; giggled Ms. Quesada, flicking her hair back.<br />
<br />
“Um, Jose, I heard that because of what happened, there&#39;s a city wide traffic jam of people trying to evacuate, as pointless as that is. I know that you live across town. Would you...like to stay with me for a while until things cool down?” she asked sweetly.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Elizabeth and Billie&#39;s ride home had been mostly uneventful, aside from the heavier than usual concentration of traffic. Liz watched row after row of cars and trucks occupied by women pass by her by with no man or boy in sight, and she sighed in sadness. Elizabeth was a committed feminist. She would occasionally have massive arguments with neighbors and acquaintances over the plight of women and cultural minorities, leading many less enlightened people to call her a “feminazi” and an “SJW”(Short for the internet colloquialism &#39;Social Justice Warrior&#39;), which she more or less rolled her eyes at, but Elizabeth certainly had never wanted men to disappear! All she had wanted was for the sexes to live together in harmony and equality. She wracked her brain over how this gender wave could have happened, because it was simply beyond belief. It was as if someone had made a “No more men!” wish with some magic lamp or something, but Elizabeth knew that was impossible. There was fruitless speculation from all corners of the Earth, but nobody yet had a clue, and it was driving the woman crazy.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth had had no problem identifying Billy, now Billie, from the line up of little girls in Ms. Aaronsohn&#39;s class. Aside from Billie&#39;s clothes being easily identifiable, there was something else, some sort of intuition that allowed families to identify one another now, like a mystical “radar sense”. She had smothered her son, now daughter, in kisses and was so apologetic to her over the confusion Billie was probably now going through, but Billie was oddly OK with the changes. <br />
<br />
“As long as I get to be a tomboy, I guess I&#39;ll manage” she said stoically.<br />
<br />
After a short trip to the McDonald&#39;s drive through where Elizabeth bought Billie a happy meal(Elizabeth being served by a “new woman”, as the ex-men were now being called), the mother and daughter had made the trip home. Elizabeth saw a minivan in the driveway, which caused her some concern, but she reminded herself that her husband said the Audi had somehow changed into this minivan, which added credence to Elizabeth&#39;s speculation that this change wasn&#39;t at all natural, but somehow magically based, no matter how counter-intuitive that sounded.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth cautiously walked up to her door with Billie told to stay here and run to Sammy&#39;s parents house if she heard screaming, and unlocked it. She walked inside and saw nobody in the family room. She then tiptoed inside their kitchen and found the new Robbie with her face down on the dinner table. Liz could here sniffles. <br />
<br />
“Rob?” she asked guardedly. <br />
<br />
Robbie sat up. Her eyes were red and puffy, betraying the fact that she had been crying her eyes out.<br />
<br />
“Liz?” she asked. Elizabeth was shocked by the femininity of her husband&#39;s voice and wondered where her new clothes had come from. Nevertheless, Robbie got up and hugged her wife tightly.<br />
<br />
“Where&#39;s Billy?” she asked, wiping away another tear.<br />
<br />
“Honey, it&#39;s OK to come in now!” yelled Elizabeth to Billie. “Daddy&#39;s home!”<br />
<br />
“Daddy?” asked the five year old girl. She stepped inside and locked the door, as she had recently been taught to do. She walked inside the kitchen and found a beautiful woman with bosoms as large as Ms. Aaronsohn&#39;s. “Daddy, is that you now?”<br />
<br />
“Yes” admitted Robbie sheepishly, bending over to give her new daughter a big hug.</p>
