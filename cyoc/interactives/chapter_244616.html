<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Since Ao Guang Island was established last year, it has become a very popular destination for tourists of all kinds. Part of the reason may be of its location, relatively close to Japan, but far south enough to be in the tropics. Though another big draw is it having a fully-realized resort/casino.<br />
<br />
Though that wasn&#39;t to say that no one went to Mieni Atoll anymore. It is still a very popular vacation spot which is bringing in more people as spring is seguing into summer. In fact, there was a modeling competition being hosted on Mieni Atoll, as a small part of the IAC. There were a few detractors who were referring it to as the &#39;2025 Bikini Competition&#39;, but that wasn&#39;t describing the event as a whole. Yes, there will be plenty of swimsuits being shown off for this competition, but there would be other kinds of clothing, like gala dresses and sportswear. Not to mention there would be some male models, as well as a few herms. While some will be looking only to ogle, there were others who would be seriously considering the showcased clothing to expand their wardrobes.<br />
<br />
One such case was Sylvia Rattlerton-Weary, though in her case, the clothes weren&#39;t just for herself. Her new husband, Andrew, was going to need a major wardrobe shift very soon. After all, they were here on their honeymoon and while he was arriving with two legs, he&#39;ll be leaving with none. Snake Animalians have always been a challenge in the fashion industry. Some may argue that they don&#39;t require any clothing on their lower bodies as their genitalia and anuses were so neatly hidden. Still, even snakes have to look professional and being a lawyer requires giving a look of professionalism.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just how much are you looking to spend?&quot; asked Andrew with concern. It wasn&#39;t that they had limited wealth. In fact, Andrew was quite rich. However, like nearly any man, he had an instinctive dread when their girlfriend/wife took them clothes-shopping, especially when he was the prospective buyer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to have a whole new body type,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;You can&#39;t be expected to go around half-naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s only going to be the bottoms that need replacing,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I don&#39;t need new shirts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You forget that the Animalian virus improves all of your muscles,&quot; said Sylvia before flexing her arm. She wasn&#39;t nearly as big as some of the Animalians she knew. She worked out mainly to keep in shape, not becoming a bodybuilder. Though she still had a visible amount of muscle tone. &quot;You&#39;re still likely to outgrow your shirts. Or at least make them uncomfortably tight. It&#39;s best to start from scratch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s going to be a lot to get used to,&quot; said Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;ll be worth it,&quot; said Sylvia fondly, &quot;Trust me.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Getting a reservation at Lover&#39;s Lagoon isn&#39;t too expensive, but sometimes there can be a long waiting period. Fortunately, once Sylvia was able to pin down her wedding date and confer with Muxing about her wedding, it was much easier to reserve a time in advance. The two of them didn&#39;t bring much as they went in the late afternoon. Sylvia just brought towels and her bikini set. Andrew brought his trunks which he&#39;ll be wearing for the last time and one of the robes the hotel provided which ought to cover him post-conversion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can lose the trunks now, you know,&quot; said Sylvia as they came to the lagoon.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to do some swimming first,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;I want to use my legs one last time.&quot; With that, he jumped in. Sylvia decided she might as well do the same, though with less jumping. Snakes aren&#39;t really build for jumping. Rattlesnakes aren&#39;t associated with water, but every snake is capable of swimming. It did take some practice for Sylvia to figure out how her new body could move in the water, but she had friends to help her through that. And she&#39;ll be helping Andrew in just a little bit.<br />
<br />
Eventually, they went to one of the rock shelves that lined the lagoon, something that allowed them to sit down and not be too deep in the water. Sylvia&#39;s coils looped around Andrew in a possessive, but loving manner. Andrew was becoming more aware of how Sylvia&#39;s body was hovering right above him. Her hands were soon on his waistband, pulling at his drawstrings with increasing need. Seeing that there was no point in resisting, Andrew helped her take of his trunks which were tossed out of the lagoon. Her bikini soon joined them.<br />
<br />
Sylvia tenderly looped her coils around Andrew&#39;s legs as she drew him close, his penis soon touching her slit. Sylvia pulled her husband into a deep kiss as she pulled his dick inside of her. It wasn&#39;t as tight a fit as she expect, but that will change soon. She had been by the Horizon Labs office to reactivate her virus. Andrew grunted as he thrust into her. He could feel the virus going through his system, like venom but much more pleasant. His skin was still wet, but it was getting a drier look at the surface was segmenting into individual scales. His fingernails sharpened into reptilian claws that he was careful not to scratch his wife with.<br />
<br />
Andrew&#39;s lower body below the water elongated as his legs started fusing together. Sylvia was able to wrap more of her coils around him as he grew. Which allowed him to thrust even deeper into her. She could feel his dick getting bigger, particularly wider. She could also feel it preparing to split into two. She could also see his chest expanding as muscles built up beneath his brown scaly skin. Andrew hissed as his neck extended. His mouth pushed out into more of a snout, making it easier for him to put his lips around Sylvia&#39;s nipple. His tongue flicked it as it became forked, his canines growing longer and sharper as they became true fangs, new venom sacs connecting to them. Sylvia moaned and held him closer, feeling his dicks pulsing. Soon, the two of them let out a big hiss as his dicks flooded her for the first time.<br />
<br />
Sylvia hissed in pleasure as she relaxed her coils. She had to admit, Andrew made for a handsome rattlesnake. His muscles were a lot more toned under his scaly skin. He still had his brown hair which made it easier to identify he was human. &quot;I love you so much, Andrew,&quot; she said breathlessly.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love you too, Sssssylvia,&quot; said Andrew before pausing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, there&#39;s always a bit of hissing at first,&quot; said Sylvia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ssso I&#39;ve heard,&quot; said Andrew, &quot;Ssso, can you ssshow me how to ssswim like thisss?&quot; asked Andrew.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll show you how to slither too,&quot; said Sylvia, &quot;Actually, let&#39;s practice that first. After that, it&#39;ll be easier to learn how to swim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you insssissst,&quot; said Andrew before pulling himself out of the water. Sylvia could see there was a lot more to admire on land. He had quite a long tail, ending in a rattle like hers. He shook it experimentally, but it made no sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, we can&#39;t really rattle when we&#39;re wet,&quot; said Sylvia as she climbed out of the water, &quot;Alright, now follow my lead, this is going to take some practice.&quot; She and Andrew slithered around the lagoon. Andrew won&#39;t get used to being without legs for some time, but he and Sylvia had plenty of time now. After all, they were married now and Sylvia felt she couldn&#39;t have picked a better partner.</p>
