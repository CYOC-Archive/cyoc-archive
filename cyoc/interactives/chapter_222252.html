<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The men needed only a few more terrible strokes to break through the barricade, Mary and Juan&#39;s last defense. As the webbing gave way, the room became a battlefield. The men burst in and the fight began. Mary sprang into action, facing the attackers with a mixture of confidence and fearlessness. She quickly took down the first wave of attackers, leaving ten of them incapacitated. Her moves were precise, her reactions lightning fast. But as the dust settled from that first encounter, Mary realized there were many more enemies to face.<br />
<br />
Despite her impressive combat skills, Mary was outnumbered by the sheer amount of enemies pouring into the room. She took a moment to catch her breath and assess the situation. Her heart raced in a mixture of adrenaline and fear. She knew she couldn&#39;t let fear hold her back, but these men were dangerous. But so was she.<br />
<br />
With steely resolve, Mary prepared for the next onslaught. The battle raged on, each move calculated and fierce. She fought with a fluidity that suggested she was made for this, her body reacting almost instinctively to each threat. The room echoed with the sounds of struggle, the grunts of exertion and the clash of combat. Amidst the chaos, the men steadied their guns and fired a hail of bullets at Mary. She moved with incredible agility, dodging and deflecting the shots. In the heat of the moment, Mary&#39;s focus sharpened even further, anticipating their moves with incredible precision.<br />
<br />
When she saw the man armed with the flamethrower, Mary&#39;s courage rose. She was not going to let them get the upper hand. She quickly fired a webbing at him, nailing him and his weapon to the ground, immobilizing him.<br />
<br />
But the odds proved too great even for Mary&#39;s extraordinary abilities. As the battle raged on, she was overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of her enemies. A sense of defeat began to creep in and panic began to set in. The realization that she might not be able to overcome this relentless onslaught began to weigh heavily on her heart.<br />
<br />
Every move she made, every blow she threw, felt like it was not enough. Her breath came in ragged gasps and her limbs began to ache from the relentless assault. But Mary refused to give up. She was fighting not just for herself, but for Juan and for their chance of survival.<br />
<br />
In the midst of the chaotic battle, a still, calming inner voice echoed in Mary&#39;s thoughts. It seemed to be a voice that transcended the tumult around her, directing Mary&#39;s thoughts with an almost supernatural certainty. As the noise of the conflict surrounded her, Mary&#39;s focus shifted inward, drawn by this instinctive presence that encouraged her to let go of her doubts and hesitations.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath, Mary heeded the call of this inner guidance. She surrendered her fears and reservations and allowed herself to be consumed by a sensation of liberation. As she surrendered, a remarkable transformation began to unfold before her eyes.<br />
<br />
In an amazing display of evolution, Mary&#39;s body began a radical metamorphosis that seemed to dance on the edge of reality and fantasy. It was as if her already rewritten DNA was causing her physical appearance to be redesigned, like her body had decided to embrace its full potential.<br />
<br />
The first change was in the color of her skin. Gradually the shade deepened as her skin became darker. She could feel the change, a tingling sensation that seemed to come from within. Her darkening skin was like camouflage in the shadows of the caves. <br />
<br />
Her skin, as it changed, began to take on a fascinating texture. It was as if a new layer was being woven into existence, a chitinous armor that was both flexible and strong. She ran her fingers over it in awe, marveling at how hard it felt under her touch. It was a sensation at once strange and comforting. Its chitinous texture glistened with monstrous brilliance in the ambient light. But the changes didn&#39;t stop there. She could feel her nails lengthening as they pushed further out of her hand, becoming pointed and sharp claws. Large sharp spikes protruded from her elbows and heels, adding a deadly weapon to her already predatory body, ready to cut through any obstacle with ease. As the spikes on her heels grew, Mary was naturally pushed a little higher.<br />
<br />
Underneath her skin, a drastic transformation was taking place. Mary&#39;s already enhanced muscles began to ripple and expand, shifting with a newfound potency. She could feel them growing, pressing against her chitinous skin. With no real room to grow, the pressure inside her increased. Second by second, every sinew and fiber became more pronounced and defined. As her muscles grew and her body underwent this remarkable metamorphosis, she couldn&#39;t help but marvel at how strong she was becoming. As she traced her fingers along the lines of her arms, she could hardly believe the transformation that was taking place before her eyes. Her abs were now cut into her stomach like marble, providing a protective yet sexy shield. Her calves flexed naturally due to her new heels and her shoulders were as broad as a swimmer&#39;s. Finally, she flexed her arms and felt the muscles ripple under her steel-hard skin. It was exhilarating, a rush of sensation she had never experienced before. She couldn&#39;t help but smile as she enjoyed her newfound strength. Every move felt different, a dance of strength and power that echoed through her entire being. <br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s heart quickened as she felt something strange happening to her spine. Beside her growing muscles, she felt something else trying to push its way out. She arched forward in pain, every fibre of her body contracting. With a primal roar, 4 small, pointed, chitinous appendages broke through her skin and rapidly lengthened. This was unlike anything she had ever experienced before. Four distinct bulges emerged from her back, each one resembling the graceful curve of a spider&#39;s leg. As pain turned to wonder, Mary tentatively moved the extensions. They responded instantly to her thoughts. The flexing and contracting of the limbs felt strangely natural. It was as if they had always been a part of her. She marveled at their complex structure and how she could move with such fluidity and grace.<br />
<br />
With a final burst of growth and a deafening roar, Mary flexed her muscles and her new limbs, which stretched seven feet in each direction, a good foot more than she was now tall, even with her natural high heels. They were like bat wings on her back, without a membrane. Each one ended, like her heels and elbows, in a deadly spike.<br />
<br />
She could feel the power coursing through her, a surge of energy that seemed to radiate from her core. Her evolved body brought with it a heightened awareness of her abilities. As she admired her evolved self, Mary couldn&#39;t help but dance a little, testing the fluidity of her movements, the grace of her new limbs. She felt light on her feet, almost weightless. Her heart raced with exhilaration and she let out a joyful laugh.<br />
<br />
Her reflection in the dim light of the cave revealed a body that was no longer the same. Her physique had changed, her muscles now etched with a degree of definition beyond human norms, while her size remained at fitness model levels. Her whole appearance was feminine, even her breasts pushed out a little further.<br />
<br />
Mary&#39;s feelings were a whirlwind of wonder and curiosity. She could not tell which were harder: her muscles or her insect skin.<br />
<br />
She definitively became something more than human, a fusion of plain old Mary and a deadly spider... <i>A spider...</i>. This moment of mediation caused her to finally solve the puzzle. She recalled the events, the teleporter accident, the spider, her panic. Even the configured target destination of the amazons jungle... Every memory came back.<br />
<br />
With never told confidence she slowly stepped forward to the attackers.</p>
