<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“You don’t smell like a bear; if you’re a wolf you got about ten seconds to get the hell out of here before I deal with you myself.” The voice said ominously.<br />
<br />
Cally said nothing. What did he mean, Cally didn’t smell like a bear? He wasn’t a wolf either, and he didn’t want the man to approach him.<br />
<br />
“Fine, I’ll come and deal with you myself.” The man said, and Cally heard the brush snap and creak as the man plowed through it. He decided to reveal himself.<br />
<br />
“Wait, please! I need help!” Cally shouted, standing up from his hiding place.<br />
<br />
The man who had come after him was a big man, bigger that Cally’s male body. He only wore trousers, his well-muscled torso and prominent bulge on full display. His hair and beard were shaggy, with various braids and beads woven into them. Cally supposed this body of his was close to six feet tall; the man in front of him was easily seven. He was a furball compared to Cally as well; his arms, his chest, his back all covered in a pelt of black hairs.<br />
<br />
The man stopped in his tracks when he saw Cally and sniffed the air. “Human?” he spoked; Cally noticed how sharp his canines were. “What are you doing all the way out here, little man?” he asked with a smile, looking over Cally’s nude male body.<br />
<br />
“I, um…” he didn’t know what to say. Help, I turned into a naked man in the middle of the woods? Cally did some very quick thinking.<br />
<br />
“Please, I was robbed,” he said, the rumble of his deep voice still new to him. “They took everything, I don’t even know where I am.” He said.<br />
<br />
The big bear of a man hefted his axe onto his shoulder and gave Cally an appraising look. “You don’t smell like you’re lying,” he said, sniffing the air again. “You’re lucky I just set for the day; we’re not far from our camp.” He gestured with his hand. “Come along, little human. We’ll get see if we can find you some trousers to cover up that cute furry ass of yours.” He said with a smirk before turning around and heading back to the road.<br />
<br />
Cally hurried after him, not sure what to make of that comment. He hurried after and joined the big man on the road. He extended a large, hairy hand to Cally.<br />
<br />
“Luka. And you are?” he asked.<br />
<br />
“Um…Calvin. Cal, thank you for your help.” Cal replied uncertainly. He tried his best to cover himself before this stranger, but the big man just laughed.<br />
<br />
“Don’t bother covering yourself, my friend. We’re men out in nature, let yourself be free.” He said, and Cal dropped his hands as they started walking back the way Luka had come.<br />
<br />
“Why do you keep calling me ‘human’,” Cal asked after a short silence.<br />
<br />
Luka looked at him quizzically. “Because that’s what you are, are you not? That’s what you smell like.”<br />
<br />
“Are you not human?” Cal said, realizing how weird that question sounded.<br />
<br />
The woodsman laughed, “Right, you humans can’t tell us apart when we aren’t phased. I’m a werebear, my new friend.” He said.<br />
<br />
Cal was shocked at that admission; she wouldn’t have believed it if she hadn’t been magically spirited away and transformed not even a few hours ago.<br />
<br />
“Don’t be afraid, little one.” He said, interpreting Cal’s silence for fear. “My clan, we’re a peaceful lot. We don’t bite, you know, unless you’re into that sort of thing.” He leered.<br />
<br />
Cal ignored his pass and asked, “Where am I, exactly?”<br />
<br />
“You’re in the Svelte Woods, about a half-a-day’s walk from Roundbottom Port.” He replied, neither of those places sounding remotely familiar to Cal’s ears. “Our camp is just over this way.”<br />
<br />
“Camping? So, is this your day off?” asked Cal.<br />
<br />
“Certainly not. My brothers and I have been out here far from our dens to cut trees and sell the lumbar at port.” He replied, leading him off the road and down a narrow game trail. Cal was starting to calm down as he absorbed his new surroundings. He look around at the trees, listening to the sounds of the animals, and his eyes finally came to rest on Luka’s large muscular back. He watched big man’s shoulders flex and strain as he ducked under a branch or hopped over a log. Calvin’s new male hormones began to get the better of him as he found himself ogling this hirsute giant, but instead of the familiar sensations, his crotch began to feel warm and heavy. His cock began to stiffen as he walked, and Cal blushed as he experienced his first erection. He tried to lag behind so his new companion wouldn’t noticed; but even with his new big hands it was hard to hide. Cal couldn’t help but noticed with a twinge of pride that his new cock was much bigger than any of those of her boyfriends.<br />
<br />
Luka led Cal into a clearing in the woods; a large campfire smoldered and smoked lightly in the center, surrounded by a circle of bedrolls and heavy-laden packs made of rough leather. The clearing was deserted but for a man seated on a stump by the fire, who looked like he was finishing breakfast. Luka sauntered over to the man with Cal hurrying behind to match the bigger man’s strides. He could see that the man by the fire was older and bigger than Luka, although his body was somewhat similar. A thick pelt of grey hairs graced the man’s bulging arms and massive chest. His belly was rotund and hairy, but even Cal could discern the strong abdominal muscles lurking beneath. He was barefoot, and the crotch of his jeans bulged with what Cal could only guess was the man’s massive manhood. He gave Luka a warm smile from his thickly bearded face, but evaluated Calvin with cold grey eyes from beneath his shaggy salt-and-pepper- mane. <br />
“Luka, my son.”, the older man rumbled, giving his son a strong hug before releasing him and turning to Cal. “I thought you’d gone on to work with the others. Who is this human you’ve brought to our camp? He smells strange.”<br />
<br />
“Father,” began Luka, with a tone of deference. “I found this human alone in our forest. He claims to have been robbed.” He looked to Cal. “This is my father, Koda. He is the Alpha, the leader of our bear clan.” Luka stepped off to dig through his pack and find Calvin some pants. <br />
<br />
“Uh…good to meet you, sir.” Said Calvin tentatively. He stuck out a hand, but Koda did not take it and regarded Cal with cold appraisal. <br />
<br />
“You smell strange,” he commented. “So that you know, we kill trespassers on sight. Have you come to poach from our lands, to harm our people?” he asked blatantly.<br />
<br />
Calvin recoiled slightly. “No! Of course not! I’m lost, I don’t have anything to my name. Please sir, I just need help finding my way home.”<br />
<br />
The Alpha took a deep breath through his broad nose. “You smell like a lot of things, but a liar is not one of them. I do not offer charity, young human. You work with us today, pull your weight, and tomorrow morning I can send you off to Roundbottom Port with enough money to begin your journey home.” He turned to his son. “He can help the ursas in their work. Working the logs is beyond even this young buck’s strength.”<br />
<br />
“Yes, father.” Luka said, bowing his head. He handed a pair of white linen pants and a green sash to tie it with. “We don’t wear shoes,” said the man when Cal looked like he was about to ask, pointing at his own bare feet. <br />
<br />
Koda turned to Cal. “Work safe, little one. We’ll evaluate your progress at dinner. Back to work, by cub.” He said, playfully cuffing Luka behind the head. The old bear hefted his axe and strode from the clearing. <br />
<br />
“C’mon. lets get you to my father. He’ll have some tasks for you.” Said Luka, taking Cal’s upper arm in his broad hand.<br />
<br />
“Wait, didn’t I just meet your father?” Cal asked, confused.<br />
<br />
“Yeah, you met the man who fathered me. My birth father is down by the river with the other ursas.” He said.<br />
<br />
“Your what? Wait, what are ursa?” Cal was still confused. Birth father?<br />
<br />
“You know, the men with cubs, pregnant men who can’t…” but Luka was cut off.<br />
<br />
“What do you mean pregnant men? Men don’t get pregnant.” Calvin stated coolly. He supposed if there was one good thing about being stuck in this body…<br />
<br />
“What are you on about, Human? How else would anybody, you know, breed?” Luka asked, suddenly stopping.<br />
<br />
“What are you on about? Only women can get pregnant.” And then Calvin saw the look of confusion on Luka’s face. <br />
<br />
“Only what?” he scratched his bearded jaw. “What was that word?”<br />
<br />
Cal was dumbfounded; now this guy was just fucking with him, he had to be.<br />
<br />
“Are you serious? I mean a guy like you has got to be uh…swimming in ladies.” He winced; he’d been a man for a few hours and even he knew no man really said this. <br />
<br />
“You sure you didn’t take a knock to the head, man?” Luka said, looking at him strange. “I don’t know what these wo-man are or what your father never told you when you were a boy,” he continued walking. “But when a man loves a man very much they do the special dance and babies come out.” He said, in a tone as if he were talking to a child.<br />
<br />
Cal couldn’t think of anything else to say. He could only think about the strange course of events that had befallen him in these few short hours. Waking up in this strange forest, in a muscular, hairy young man’s body. He’d run into men who were larger and more masculine looking than any man he’d remembered seeing in his life, and they claimed to be werebears. And now they were claiming they didn’t know what women were. Cal was beginning to lose his sense of calm.</p>
