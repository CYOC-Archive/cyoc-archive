<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;I-I need new clothes! If---If I&#39;m a boy now, I can&#39;t be wearing this!&quot; Matthew complained, and Ethan sighed and took out some of the spare clothes provided for test subjects if they changed too much. While Matthew would prefer if he had to be this 13 year old little fucker, he could be a cool guy, he just felt happy to have some stable clothes. The white t-shirt and salmon colored pants were bland and kind of sterile looking, seeing as they were standard issue lab stuff, but they were better than going around in the old female apparel.<br />
<br />
Ethan sighed and said, &quot;I&#39;ll...try to get you back to normal, Matt.&quot; However by now Matthew was rather distracted by his new-found body.<br />
<br />
Matthew flexed an arm, and watched his little biceps pump up. He had always been at least a little curious about how the other side lived. He knew guys loved being buff and chiseled, working out and all that. But now, now he was experiencing it, he was kind of surprised. Even though he was just thirteen, it seemed the health inducing aspect of the Chronos virus was still in play. He was easily in better shape than 90% of the other 13 year olds. Bigger biceps by far. He just needed a few more years...<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, honestly,&quot; Matt said looking to the side at Ethan, &quot;If you can just get me three more years, I&#39;d be happy. Maybe five. So I don&#39;t gotta do high school again.&quot; Ethan wondered what effect the chemical balances in the new made Matt&#39;s head were having on the youth. He seemed to have Melissa&#39;s memories, abilities and thoughts, but with a slight effect from his new gender, age, and stage in puberty.<br />
<br />
And at THAT, the door opened again and brought in a new individual.<br />
<br />
Eighteen years old, Lisa was the product of one of Ethan&#39;s many, many one night stands - the result of a faulty condom. She had her dad&#39;s blond hair, and was able to be described as an athletic young woman. She was raised by her mother and her mother&#39;s boyfriend, though she did occasionally come and visit Ethan at his lab - just to see what kind of man her &quot;bio-dad&quot; was. Like Ethan, she was surprisingly of a scientific mind despite looking for all intents and purposes like a total valley girl.<br />
<br />
Ethan realized how this might look. Here was Melissa---Matthew---whatever. And here was his daughter coming in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey bio-dad, just stopped by to ask if there was any internship opening. I&#39;ll be graduating Magna at my high school in a few months, so I&#39;ll be looking for an &quot;in&quot; to the scientific field.&quot; She was wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and her hair back in a ponytail. She&#39;d never really been one to play dress up. More preferring practicality, thus.<br />
<br />
She then looked at young Matthew and chuckled, &quot;What experiment went wrong to result in this shrimpy dude?&quot;<br />
<br />
Matthew - just before Ethan could respond - shouted at Lisa, &quot;I&#39;m not a shrimp! I&#39;m a hunk!&quot; Both Ethan and Lisa rolled their eyes, and Matthew pouted when he saw it.<br />
<br />
Ethan said to his daughter, &quot;Well, we do have some openings, but you may want to be careful. We&#39;re testing a new restored youth compound around here. You may have noticed the huge guy in the janitor&#39;s outfit...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean the actual hunk,&quot; Lisa responded, and she only coyly smiled when she caught a glare from Matt. She nodded, and said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll make sure and be careful, dad. Can you talk to your boss about getting me that internship?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing. I&#39;ll make sure and get it through with Carl as soon as possible.&quot; Ethan replied with a smile.<br />
<br />
With that, Lisa said, &quot;Cool! I&#39;ll start getting ready for it. Looking forward to working with you, bio-dad.&quot; And with that, Lisa left for the time being. Leaving Matthew blushing as he watched her leave. Much as he disliked how she talked down to him, he did like her. His hormones were raging, and he knew what he wanted. He couldn&#39;t just leave this be. Sure he wanted to go back to normal eventually, but for right now, Matt wanted something in return for all of the difficulties he endured.<br />
<br />
Matt&#39;s feelings were a swirling typhoon as of then. He wanted Carl, but he also crushed severely on the mature and smart and snarky and infuriating Lisa. Despite her talking down to him, Matt desperately wanted to get older so he might be able to get with her. &quot;Ethan...can...can you help me get to at least sixteen? So I can have a shot?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;With whom?&quot; Ethan asked in a flat tone.<br />
<br />
Matt was silent.<br />
<br />
At least until he said, &quot;Just...isolate the whatevers and try and make me sixteen or something. I can&#39;t stand being seen as some kid while I&#39;m like this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ethan sighed and shook his head, &quot;I&#39;ll...try, Matt. I think I have a compound we created that SHOULD be able to at least add three years to you. Just...don&#39;t get your hopes up.&quot; Ethan retrieved it - in truth, it was an old version of the Chronos virus that solely had the aging effect from childhood rather than the added regressing effect that Carl wanted. Therefore, it should at least give Matt some age.<br />
<br />
Handing it over, Matt posthaste injected it into himself...and gulped when he felt the telltale tingling start. The clothes he was wearing started to get a bit tighter as Ethan watched Matt starting to grow taller, his limbs more brawny and strong. Matt was gasping for air, feeling his neck get thicker as his face grew more masculine and less boyish. His hair retained its length, which resulted in Matthew having to brush it aside. Ethan watched the young man&#39;s biceps grow bigger and stronger, fighting with his triceps for room in the shirt. His forearms likewise developing a less chicken leg like and more meaty appearance. His hands stronger even as he looked at them.<br />
<br />
Matt groaned and let out a loud, &quot;Mmmotherfucker! My stomach!&quot; As his abs one by one toned up and pressed out against his shirt. The shirt was getting really tight on the young Matt. It was fascinating to watch his jawline get so strong, yet still evidently young. His pecs grew larger and stronger, sensitive nipples pressing out and visible through his shirt. The pants Matt was wearing got tighter as well as his glutes, quads and thighs got thicker and bigger, Matt posing and enjoying the sight. His calves as well grew larger and better suited for athletics.<br />
<br />
By the time it stopped and Matt was seventeen, he felt like a million bucks. If being male at thirteen felt surprisingly good, being male at seventeen was like being perpetually drunk on a heady mix of ego, testosterone and other hormones. Matt&#39;s strong jaw accentuated his grin as he took everything in, &quot;Ahhh yes, this is so much better...&quot; He flexed a bicep and gasped, &quot;Wow! I&#39;m big!&quot; He looked at his groin and the lewd bulge there, &quot;...Big everywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
Matt ran a hand through his hair, &quot;Thanks, Ethan, now I have some things to do...&quot; With that, Matt swaggered out, not even caring if there&#39;d be any other effects. Ignoring Ethan as he tried to stop him from going - already heading up the elevator.<br />
<br />
Ethan stood there, wondering what would come of this most recent change.<br />
<br />
Up in his office, Carl had found Thomas Arnoult on PeopleBook, and had been chatting with him a bit about preppy stuff, parents, parties, and possibly meeting up again. Now, Carl definitely liked Melissa (not that he knew of her now his fate) but Carl also found himself blushing a little while he chatted away with Tom. He wondered if this was just a part of him being young again. Carl shrugged his shoulders, and tried to go back to work - even though work was soooo boring.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Matthew arrived at Carl&#39;s floor, thinking about what to do. He knew he wanted either Carl or that daughter of Ethan&#39;s. But he didn&#39;t know what to do from here. Matt was...was straight. Right? Why was he so...confused by all this? He&#39;d been straight when he was Melissa. But he should be straight now. Right? Well, maybe it was the drug acting on him.<br />
<br />
Matt made his decision...</p>
