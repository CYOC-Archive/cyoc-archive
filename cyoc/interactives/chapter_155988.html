<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">It took half a day&#39;s hiking to reach the trailhead where she had parked the DeSoto.<br />
<br />
Buckled in, she gunned it towards the coast. Melissa was spending spring break at the beach 400 miles away.<br />
<br />
As the day ticked on and the sun set, Sophie pulled in to a large trucker bar along the highway. The loud rumble of the DeSoto&#39;s 454 cubic inch engine drew a lot of attention. Her identical tall huge chested clones made sure those eyes stayed glued.<br />
<br />
She took the two open barstools as the end of the bar, next to the window so she could keep an eye on her street rod.<br />
 <br />
Paging through the menu, she saw something called Silent Sam&#39;s Carolina Reaper challenge. The bartender took her drink order (Guinness) and explained the wing challenge, eyes never leaving her cleavage. 10 minutes to eat at least 10. Do that and they were free. Beat the current record of 25 and you drink free for the night. <br />
<br />
As she waited for her food, a battered Winnebago pulled in. Sophie&#39;s bodies had senses well beyond human norms, and she could hear a heated argument inside. Two voices, one male one female, were arguing about if they should do something. The male was insistent to continue. A flat smacking sound cut off the woman&#39;s protest.<br />
<br />
Deciding to tease her audience (as most of the patrons weren&#39;t even trying to hide their interest in what appeared to them to be twin pornstars), she ordered the challenge for both drones. Sophie was anticipating the abusive owner of the male voice to come in shortly and she wanted to be sure she got his undivided attention.<br />
<br />
Moments later she was proven correct as a stocky black man exited the RV. Average height, with a broad shouldered build and a barrel chest, he projected an air of aggression and confidence. He wore a tight black shirt with some band&#39;s logo on it, jeans, and expensive sneakers. His head was shaved and he sported sunglasses despite the deep twilight.<br />
<br />
He entered the bar and upon sighting Sophie&#39;s drones, sat at the vacant stool next to them. Obnoxiously snapping his fingers in the air, he got the bartenders attention and ordered a pitcher of Miller Lite for himself.<br />
<br />
He seemed ready to start hitting on them when the wings arrived. The scent was absolutely incendiary, bring tears to the eyes off all nearby. The bartender started the timer and Sophie had her drones dig in with vigor. She was essentially cheating, she simply willed her drone bodies not to relay the sensation of their burning taste buds. Wing after wing was stripped clean, and she signaled for another plate. She smashed the record, having her two bodies tie at 40 a piece. The bartender announced the victory and Sophie squeezed her two bodies close for the challenge champion photo, making sure the camera had a perfect view down her tops. That posing also provided a spectacular view for the abuser from the RV.<br />
<br />
The man from the Winnebago was hooked by this bravado and their appearance, and launched into a series of lame lines and attempts to chat up the nearest &#39;twin&#39;. Sophie teased him a bit, wanting to keep his focus. Through her other set of eyes, Sophie watched as a second figure emerged from the RV.<br />
<br />
A black woman, probably in her mid 20s. She had a very pretty face with pouty lips. Her hair was long and styled into mid-back length dreadlocks. She wore a black leather jacket over a plain black top, with blue jeans and dark boots. She appeared to have been crying.<br />
<br />
Sophie guessed where she was headed, and had the observing drone go to the bathroom ahead of her. She had barely closed the stall when the bathroom door opened again. She heard the door lock, running water, then a burst of sobbing.<br />
<br />
She let the girl have a good cry for a couple minutes and exited the stall.<br />
<br />
&#39;I take it this isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s struck you.&#39;<br />
<br />
She looked up with a jolt, she&#39;d believed she was alone. There was blood in the sink and what looked the be part of a tooth on top of the soap dispenser.<br />
<br />
&#39;What? Why do you care? You some kind of cop?&#39;<br />
<br />
Sophie laughed. &#39;Do cops usually have multicolored hair and melon sized tits? No, just someone who is sympathetic and interested in helping.&#39;<br />
<br />
The girl looked unsure, desperate for the help but deeply suspicious.<br />
<br />
&#39;I&#39;m Sophie. And don&#39;t worry about Mr. Fists, my twin has him completely distracted. I don&#39;t think he can think about anything other than her cleavage and won&#39;t be looking for you any time soon.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Im Maya, and Mr. Fists&#39; actual name is Dante.&#39;<br />
<br />
They exited the restroom, Maya moved from obstacle to obstacle to stay hidden. Dante didn&#39;t turn around, even when Sophie charmed the bartender into giving her the whole bottle of tequila.<br />
<br />
With one drone keeping him occupied, Sophie and Maya went behind the bar and leaned against the back wall, passing the tequila bottle back and forth.<br />
<br />
Maya&#39;s story slowly came out. She had inherited her parents farm and was determined to keep it going. Unfortunately ,  chain of bad years and a few business mistakes left her with an impossible amount of debt. She had met Dante and first thought that he was sent to save her. Strong, handsome, with a seemingly endless supply of cash; he charmed her way into her life and into marriage.<br />
<br />
Which is where it all went wrong. Dante&#39;s money came from growing weed on a huge scale. Her farm&#39;s remote location and many acres of woodland made it much safer for his operation than random remote parts of state forests. He knew that once his name was on the farm he effectively owned her. Maya&#39;s family had been on that farm for 200 years; first as slaves, buying it a generation after emancipation. She could never walk away from 10 generations of history.<br />
<br />
Their trip in the Winnebago was Dante&#39;s latest scheme. Inspired by a TV series, he wanted to get into manufacturing crystal meth. <br />
<br />
Sophie had long decided to help the girl, the question was what would be best.<br />
<br />
&#39;Your farm, is there a creek or pond? Old root cellar or old foundation?&#39;<br />
<br />
This was not the questions Maya expected.<br />
<br />
&#39;Uh yes, all of those. What does that have to do with anything?&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;What would you give up to keep your farm and get revenge on Dante? Extreme revenge, making him your obedient puppet.&#39;<br />
<br />
&#39;Give up? All I have is the farm, there isn&#39;t anything else I have that I haven&#39;t already lost. Easy to be willing to lose everything when you have nothing.&#39;<br />
<br />
Sophie picked up a rock and handed it to Maya. &#39;Normal rock right?&#39;<br />
<br />
Maya rolled it in her hands and nodded. Sophie grabbed it and crushed it in her fist. She sprinkled gravel from her fist. Maya&#39;s eyes were wide.<br />
<br />
&#39;Its not my twin in the bar with Dante. It&#39;s me. I&#39;m one mind in multiple bodies.&#39;<br />
<br />
The black girl tugged a dread as a nervous twitch. &#39;Bullshit&#39;.<br />
<br />
Sophie began reciting the lame stories and pickup lines that Dante had tried.<br />
<br />
Maya&#39;s eyes went wide, she recognized Dante&#39;s usual BS.<br />
<br />
&#39;You still don&#39;t believe me.&#39; She chugged the remaining tequila and broke the bottle in her fist like the rock. Jagged glass impaled her palm. She held up her and for Maya to see. The glass shards were pushed out from inside, and the wounds closed leaving no trace.<br />
<br />
Seeing belief and fear in Maya&#39;s eyes, Sophie gave an abbreviated version of her story.<br />
<br />
&#39;and I&#39;m offering to make you just like me. You&#39;ll drain every last bit of masculinity out of that bastard and leave him an empty obedient husk.&#39; Sophie finished.</p>
