<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>Alternative title - Grievance Therapy</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">    Thick silence had long fallen across the town, seeping into the dimly lit interior of the library. With furniture returned, fluid cleaned from the floorboards and the shattered window boarded up, the library was practically back to how it was before the chaos had started.<br />
<br />
    Three forms sat at one of the reading tables; one a young man clothed in red, the other a small yellow kobold, and the last a tall black-haired woman, glasses glinting from a flame radiating from a candle placed on the aforementioned table. <br />
<br />
    Two masks lay atop the desk&#39;s wooden surface in front of Kairos, the knight&#39;s gaze attached to the lustrous blue scales of the snake mask, vividly recalling the way he had assumed its shape mere hours ago.<br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s hands lay clasped together, the librarian leaning her chin against her knuckles in thought as she observed the blonde-haired man in front of her. Thorin&#39;s slitted amber eyes were fixated on the black tome before Kairos, it&#39;s power faint yet overbearing. The kobold&#39;s gaze quickly broke as a voice pierced the overpowering silence, it&#39;s tone observant.<br />
<br />
    &quot;This entire time you&#39;ve held magical energies within you; the ability to allow souls to bind to you long after death, reverting to masks while their essence remains within you.&quot; Cynthia removes her chin from her fists, leaning back in her seat and crossing her arms across her chest. Tilting her head in curiosity, her eyebrows twitch at the knight&#39;s fidgeting.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You&#39;re acting as if no other mage has ever had such abilities.&quot; Kairos whispers, voice loud enough for both kobold and sorceress to hear. His blue eyes narrow as Cynthia returns a cheeky smile.<br />
<br />
    &quot;And how correct you are. I find it <i>very</i> puzzling that it was not a mage who held these dormant abilities, but a <i>knight</i>; an individual who trains vigorously in the art of physical combat gaining an ability that only blooming wielders of magic usually tend to gain.&quot; Bringing a finger up to her chin, her gaze shifts up to the ceiling in contemplation. &quot;But I suppose there&#39;s a clear exception to this with how bizarre this awakened ability of yours is.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I didn&#39;t ask to hold such a vile ability.&quot; The desk thuds as Kairos&#39; fist lightly bangs against it. &quot;I didn&#39;t wish to reduce these two souls to mere masks, ornaments that allow me to imitate who they once were,&quot; The anger was difficult to make out from within the knight&#39;s stoic tone. “and even then, the form I take isn&#39;t even a perfect imitation.”<br />
<br />
    &quot;<i>You</i> may have not wished for them to have been reduced to mere masks, but has the thought ever crossed your mind as to <i>why</i> they may have?&quot; Cynthia placed her elbows on the table, contemplating her next course of action as her hands cover the area below her nose, watching his actions.<br />
<br />
    Kairos grits his teeth at the librarian&#39;s cold tone, every word piercing through him as magic would to armor. His blue eyes lock with her own as he glances up to rebuke her remark. &quot;Why would <i>anyone</i> wish to be given such a cruel fate?&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;K-Kairos…&quot; <br />
<br />
    At his name, the blonde-haired human&#39;s gaze shifts to the child-like form of Thorin, amber eyes pleading. <br />
<br />
    &quot;K-Kenos, he overtook you earlier because he was drowning in an endless sea of sorrow, it&#39;s waves only parting to make way for a volcano of anger…&quot; The kobold&#39;s eyes shift to the masks, a clawed finger pointing to the mask of the blue serpent. &quot;Kenos refused to ascend, his regrets tying him to this world of perpetual chaos and death.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos merely scoffs, his lips twisting into an amused smile. &quot;So, you&#39;re telling me that my ability is just letting other people use me to feel good about themselves? If I hadn&#39;t awakened this ability to begin with I would&#39;ve called you insane.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;T-That&#39;s not what I--&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;I get what you&#39;re trying to say, Thorin.&quot; Kairos dismisses him, the yellow scaled reptilian&#39;s protests quickly dying down, although from his expression it was clear the knight&#39;s words had hurt him.<br />
<br />
    &quot;It seems to me,&quot; Cynthia&#39;s voice causes both males to look to her, the librarian&#39;s glinting glasses hiding her eyes, &quot;that you yourself possess regrets, knight.&quot; <br />
<br />
    The blue-eyed man stifled a laugh, opting to roll his eyes and sigh. &quot;I have no regrets. Whatever happens in the midst of battle, I am to leave without any.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; gaze darts down to the table, locks of blonde hair shielding his eyes from the peering gaze of Cynthia, unwilling to let her see through him again, especially in such a vulnerable state. <br />
<br />
    Eyes served as windows to the soul after all.<br />
<br />
    &quot;One lives, the other dies; an endless cycle of battle. My personal feelings have no say in the mission.&quot; Kairos&#39; eyes glaze over, recalling the words of his mentor. <br />
<br />
    The table shudders as Cynthia&#39;s leg kicked it, snapping Kairos free from his reminiscence. &quot;You&#39;re trying too hard to live up to the expectations of this teacher of yours. Denial is all I feel from those hollow words; we&#39;re here now <i>because</i> of your regrets.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Without allowing him to recover, Cynthia shattered any hope of justification. &quot;Tell me, if those words ring true, then why did you put on the mask?&quot; <br />
<br />
    <i>&quot;Orveus would still be alive if he hadn&#39;t wasted his life trying to save mine.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
    <i>&quot;Verve trained me as her prodigy, yet I rejected it all and ran away. All those years of training and I have nothing to show for it. If I stayed with her a bit longer I would&#39;ve been able to protect Orveus.&quot;</i><br />
<br />
    Kairos&#39; head shakes in disbelief, actions, and words he uttered rushing to the forefront of his mind. Cynthia&#39;s head shakes in disapproval, her eyes closing in exasperation.<br />
<br />
    &quot;You should know, that no matter how vile and repulsive an ability may seem, there is always potential for it to be used for good. The guilt you hold is clouding this realization from the silver lining.&quot; <br />
<br />
    Unwilling to make eye contact with the librarian, Kairos&#39; eyes drop to the two masks before him, the cyan scales of the snake mask feeling cool against his touch. <br />
<br />
    Even as he digested her words, the sorceress continued on rolling. &quot;This guilt and regret over your loss is clouding your rationality, but wallowing in self-pity will get nothing done, now will it?&quot;<br />
<br />
    A chuckle slips from Kairos&#39; lips, his hands clenching into fists. &quot;Your words imply that an excuse of a knight like me could ever get anything correctly done.&quot;<br />
<br />
    Cynthia&#39;s heel slams against the floorboards, voice high enough to be practically shouting at him. &quot;Enough, open your eyes, Kairos! Alongside Kenos, Orveus lives on through you, even with the death of his body. Are you just going to sit here and allow the world to crumble around you?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Awaiting a response, all voices fall silent. Thorin&#39;s vivid amber eyes closing in pity as he struggled not to break. Any hint of playfulness in Cynthia&#39;s expression had faded with her expression becoming stern, yet caring.<br />
<br />
    His mind rushed as every ideal that he had held onto clashed with the harsh truth put forth by Cynthia, his world breaking apart with each truth that burned away his ideals.<br />
<br />
    The kidnappings and the various versions of mages appearing every few weeks to add more to their ranks. If he stopped hunting them down, would more kidnappings occur? Would the situation grow worse?<br />
<br />
    Letting the world deteriorate to satisfy his regret went against all the things he had been taught.<br />
<br />
By her.<br />
<br />
Verve Elyre.<br />
<br />
    Sighing shakily, Kairos&#39; head lifts, his eyes meeting the grey of Cynthia&#39;s own, the knight&#39;s posture stiffening. <br />
<br />
    &quot;No, I could <em>never</em>.&quot; Kairos asserts, his tone brimming with resolve. Blue eyes narrowing as he looks from the voluptuous form of the librarian to the thin cloaked form of Thorin. &quot;You&#39;re right, I can&#39;t let this guilt eat me away. No matter what, I&#39;ll track this clan down to the ends of the Earth, even if it kills me.&quot;<br />
<br />
    A serene smile spread across Cynthia&#39;s face. &quot;Is this truly the path you&#39;ve chosen?&quot;<br />
<br />
    The knight nods, the blue in his eyes shining with boundless courage, a sight that inspired Thorin.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-If I may…&quot; Thorin&#39;s quiet voice attracting the attention of both the librarian and the knight, the kobold instinctively flinches, his fear quickly bubbling back up to the surface and causing him to relent, shoving the hood of his cloak over his face. &quot;A-A-Actually, n-nevermind! I-I said nothing.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;Awfully flustered aren&#39;t you, Thorin?&quot; Cynthia chuckles, a devious grin crossing her lips, although her gaze shifts back to Kairos. &quot;Now that you have this goal in mind, what will you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
    Pausing, the blonde-haired knight&#39;s gaze falls to the wooden surface of the table, eyes shifting from the blue scales of the snake mask to the golden fur of the wolf mask.<br />
<br />
    Her eyes following his own, a smile graces the sorceress&#39; face. &quot;Well, as long as you don&#39;t make <i>another</i> mess both outside and inside, you have my permission.&quot; <br />
<br />
    &quot;I already had to let the town guards know that the massacre outside was conducted in self-defense. Be a good boy now.&quot; With a wink Cynthia rises from her seat, heels clacking against the floor as she struts away.<br />
<br />
    Pulling his hood back, amber eyes peer out from beneath the young kobold&#39;s cloak, his maw agape as a mask distinctively resembling the face of a wolf lay clasped within his hands, the golden coloration of its fur enriched by the dim candlelight.<br />
<br />
    &quot;K-K-Kairos?! Y-You&#39;re not going to--!&quot;<br />
<br />
    A devious smile spreads across the knight&#39;s face, stifling an amused laugh at the kobold&#39;s anxiousness. Hovering the mask of Orveus close to his face, his eyes glint as he watches Thorin react.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I don’t like w-what you’re doing right now! C-Cut it out!” Thorin cries as he slowly backs away, hopping down from his chair to get away from a would-be beast of bloodlust. “Y-You can&#39;t be serious--!”<br />
<br />
    His words were cut off as his fears were realized; the mask, despite being a distance away from actually touching Kairos’ face, suddenly sprung from the human&#39;s hand, latching onto his face with a slap. In dread, Thorin hurried his pace, whipping out his tome in preparation for a binding spell.<br />
<br />
    The mask’s golden fur seemed to flow and multiply from the mask, spreading across the human wearing it, seeming to grow and stretch before his very eyes, the visage of the wolf overtaking the form it was attached to. The closed mouth of the mask splitting open, rows of sharp teeth explode outwards as a canine tongue flops to life, red irises gleaming from the sockets of the mask.<br />
<br />
    Finishing it’s spread across the human’s body, fur settles and reforms the human beneath. Muscles and bone pop, growing and quickly developing to help birth a new werewolf. Each crack and snap echoes throughout the small library, the added horrid mix of squelching causing Thorin to flinch, tome beginning to glow with a prepared spell. <br />
<br />
    It didn’t take long until a final crack echoed throughout the silent library, the form of the werewolf panting, slitted eyes focusing themselves onto the weak creature called Thorin. Maw parting, the golden beast spoke.<br />
<br />
    &quot;<b>Hello there</b>.&quot;<br />
<br />
    &quot;O-Orveus?” Thorin stutters as the werewolf grins, absurdly sharp canines glinting within the dim-lit room. “I-Is that you?”<br />
<br />
    &quot;<b>You&#39;re thinking of the other wolf</b>.&quot; Kairos whispers with a pant as he flexes his claws, muscular body familiarizing itself again to the new body frame and mass. “<b>He’s not here. It looks like I only gained his instincts</b>.”<br />
<br />
    &quot;O-Oh…! Then you’re still Kairos?” Thorin exclaims, awaiting for confirmation and closing his tome without hurry as the werewolf nods.<br />
 <br />
    &quot;<b>Thorin, I&#39;m beat. Good night</b>.” Kairos’ heavy-looking form lumbers towards the library’s resting room, the beast yawning on his way to a comfortable den.<br />
<br />
    &quot;R-Right! Goodnight Orv-- Kairos…!” The yellow kobold stutters, watching apprehensively as the golden werewolf opened the door to the resting room, his visage disappearing into the doorframe. As the large muscular form vanishes a shaky breath slips from the kobold&#39;s maw.<br />
<br />
    Thorin jumps as his grip slackens, the tome he had been clutching thudding onto the wooden floorboards before finally landing onto its cover.<br />
<br />
    &quot;I-I&#39;m going to need a new robe…&quot;</p>
