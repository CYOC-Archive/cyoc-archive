<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">But Ty wasn´t done with the confused family, who right now seemed to have forgotten him. Before they had much time to remember him, he shot a second picture of the regressing family.<br />
This had two effects. For one, the family remembered Ty was standing there, and shot two pictures of them. The second was, well, there was another person missing from them. And the rest had become younger again.<br />
The mother, Helen, was now even rounder than before, as she now had not only her latest son, Billy, in her womb, but also his sister Katie. She groaned at the added weight, looking around for the rest of her family.<br />
Her man, Frank, looked younger again, even younger than her, to be exact. He looked like he did years ago, when he was around thirty-two. Unbeknownst to her, he had regressed a bit more than her, as added to his own years were the years of his son who couldn´t regress further without ceasing to exist. “Frank? What´s happening to us?” she asked him.<br />
Frank, upon hearing his wife´s question, turned to look at her. She looked younger than before as well, maybe around thirty-three or thirty-four years right now. The only difference to her being forty the first time was he far bigger stomach, which right now hosted both his youngest children. He didn´t answer her.<br />
To the other side, a now kid sized Alex looked up at his parents in fear. He didn´t understand what was happening right now. Why was everything growing so big? As a six-year-old boy, he had been rather short, now he was that age again. His glasses had vanished from him, as his eyes had been better at that age. “Mom? Dad?” he asked fearfully.<br />
Susie, to his other side, was slightly panicking about her undeveloped body, not at all realizing what happened to her family around her. What would her boyfriend say? She looked like a child again. <br />
Just as Frank turned towards Ty, he was blinded by a third flash from his own phone’s camera in the boys’ hands. He blinked a few times to clear his vision, when another groan came from his wife. Ignoring the boy with his phone for a second, he turned back to his wife, who by now looked around twenty-eight years, but with a stomach that was much too big. A quick glance around showed him that his eldest son, Alex, was now missing as well, and only a little toddler-sized Susie sat on the bench he had been on before.<br />
Helen held a hand on her stomach as it had expanded another time now, making her feeling rather heavy. She also noticed her son missing, realizing she was now pregnant with not one or two, but three of her children at the same time. A horrified sight was when she looked up, seeing that Frank by now was the age their oldest son had started with, around fourteen. Not even labeled an adult anymore. <br />
Susie was throwing a tantrum as she realized she was wearing training pants again. How would her boyfriend ever take her serious like this? Only now she also noticed the lack of her siblings around her form. She looked around in panic, searching for any of them.<br />
Frank panicked and nearly screamed at Ty: “Stop taking pictures.”<br />
But Ty only grinned at him as he took the fourth picture. This time, Helen didn´t get much younger, but bigger around her middle, as Susie joined her three siblings inside her mother´s womb. And by the grimace on her face, it was clear that the added weigh was too much for her. Adding that one of her kids had just kicked her painfully, even when all four of them were only semi-conscious inside her. <br />
Frank, by now, couldn´t help her, nor stop Ty from anything, as he had just dropped back onto his diapered butt in shock. He was now only a two-year-old toddler, sitting between his wife, pregnant with all their kids, and that strange boy shooting pictures off them. This last shot had regressed him not only his own three years they all regressed, but added three years for Billy, Katie and Alex.  And the only thing he could do right now was to wail loudly.<br />
Ty grinned down at the wailing toddler that had been a family father of forty-two only a couple of minutes ago. “That was so much fun to watch. But don´t worry. You will see your kids again in a second, when you join them. Say cheese.”<br />
Helen looked horrified at her husband wailing on the floor, before with another flash he was gone as well, adding another baby inside her womb. She started to cry at her loss, as she was now a twenty-four-year-old woman, pregnant with five kids, one of them the original father of the others. She understood that the boy flashing pictures was somewhat responsible, but it was her husband’s phone, so she had no idea how he did it.<br />
Ty enjoyed her wailing for a bit, mostly satisfied with the result. There was a last thing to do now, but he had to decide which way he would do this.</p>
