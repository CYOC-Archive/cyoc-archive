<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sarah enticed me out of the bath by brewing a coffee. I put on the toweling gown and joined him in the kitchen. As we sipped our drinks we discussed the situation we were in. I would have to not only be Sarah at Karen&#39;s party tonight but also at the BBQ tomorrow and go to work as Sarah on Monday. With luck we would be able to swap back after work on Monday.<br />
<br />
When I thought about it there was nothing that was too daunting. Nothing that I hadn&#39;t already done. I knew Karen, her workmates and her netball team. I had been with all of them when wearing Sarah&#39;s body last week. And I had to admit that it had probably been the most exciting week of my life. <br />
<br />
With the BBQ tomorrow I would need to pretend to be Hilda&#39;s daughter in law to be. But once I thought about it, that was probably be an easier task then pretending to be her son. I had already being &#39;Sarah&#39; with Amanda, while Rod knew about the medallion anyway. <br />
With Sarah&#39;s work I had already spent a week doing exactly that. One more day was not an issue. I wondered why I had felt so upset. I decided I would just get on with it and enjoy the next few days as best I could.<br />
 <br />
Sarah suggested he could find me something a bit less revealing to wear to the party. <br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; I said &quot;I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to do my best to enjoy the next few days. If you thought it would be fun to wear the grass skirt, then that is what I will do&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah smiled at me &quot;That&#39;s a great attitude&quot; He kissed me on my forehead &quot;I love you&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you had better show me how to put a bikini on&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah did more than that. He gave me a &#39;Sports tampon&#39; and showed me how to insert it myself. He gave me a supply to put in my bag &#39;Just in case&#39;.<br />
<br />
He suggested I wear a different  bikini, a floral set that matched the wrap I would wear. He explained that the red bikinis were for the enhanced breasts which he had previously sported, I currently had Sarah&#39;s natural breast size.<br />
<br />
He helped me to put on the string bikini and the grass skirt, then did my hair and makeup. He suggested the black sandals I had worn last night would be appropriate footwear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you driving or do we catch a taxi?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We are already running late so I&#39;ll drive there. We can catch a taxi home. Karen said she was making some punch so we can bring that bottle of Vodka to add to it. I&#39;ll grab a 6 pack for myself&quot;<br />
<br />
5 minutes later I was in the passenger seat of Rob&#39;s car as Sarah drove to the party. Sarah explained &quot;The party is at Sarah&#39;s parents house the excuse is her 23rd birthday. But she is really having it because her parents have gone to Europe. She has an older brother &#39;Tommy&#39; who might be at the party as well&quot;<br />
 <br />
We arrived at he house and I took off the wrap and left it in the car. I must admit to being a bit self conscious. It was my first time wearing a bikini in public but at least my bottom was covered by the grass skirt. I dreaded the thought that maybe people would think I was a bit flat chested. After all I was smaller up top than Sarah had been earlier in the day....What am I thinking? How did that thought enter my head? I have gorgeous breasts. I remembered how I felt about them when I was male.<br />
<br />
We walked to the front door and I rang the doorbell. Karen answered wearing a navy one piece and a wrap around skirt. &quot;Happy birthday Karen&quot;<br />
<br />
She greeted me with a kiss and said &quot;I&#39;m so glad you decided to wear that skirt, you look great&quot; Sarah gave her the bottle of Vodka &quot;Thanks Rod. I will add it to the punch. Follow the noise to the back deck, some of the netball team are out there already&quot;<br />
<br />
We did follow the noise and came to a broad deck that opened to a in-ground pool. There were about 15 people standing around. There were nibbles on a table and I could see a punch bowl on another table by the wall. Sarah deposited his 6 pack into an ice bucket , removing one of the beers to drink straight away. He asked &quot;Would you like a beer or do you want to try the punch?&quot;<br />
<br />
I remembered that Sarah&#39;s palate was no great fan of beer so said &quot;I&#39;ll try the punch&quot; and poured myself a punch. It was very tasty.<br />
Mary from the netball team was beckoning me to come and join the group she was talking to. I clasped Sarah by the hand and bought him across. I could also see Mary&#39; sister Rose and Bianca were in the same group. I introduced Sarah &quot;Hi girls, have you met Rod my fiancé? This is Mary, Rose and Bianca from Karen&#39;s netball team&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Sarah&quot; said Bianca &quot;This my boyfriend Charlie&quot; <br />
<br />
Charlie said &quot;Hello Sarah and Rod&quot; and shook Rod&#39;s hand. From my current perspective he was very good looking. I was imaging what he would look like with shirt off. It&#39;s amazing what hormones do to your mind I thought. Charlie asked Sarah (in Rod&#39;s body) &quot;Do you follow the cricket?&quot; I was about to answer myself but Sarah gently pressed my hand as if to say &#39;I can handle this&#39; <br />
<br />
Sarah then surprised me by replying in-depth about the latest test match. That got Charlie responding and they were off, talking like old mates. Bianca came across and grabbed my hand and pulled me aside.  She whispered &quot;He&#39;s a cricket nut, I&#39;m glad he has someone to talk to. Come over and tell us about your costume, Karen told us there is a story to it&quot;<br />
<br />
I was reluctantly dragged away from the sports talk over to Mary and Rose who were talking about diets with another girl who Mary introduced as Rebecca. When the conversation finally lagged Bianca induced me to tell the story of how I had acquired the grass skirt at the motor show. I noticed that Sarah and Charlie had moved off to the other end of the patio and were talking with some other blokes. Jenny who had recently arrived, refilled all our glasses with the punch. <br />
<br />
More people had been arriving and I noticed one of them was Daniel from work. I knew from my week at Penberthy Motors that he was a shy, introverted guy so I fetched him and introduced him to the other girls I had been talking to. He didn&#39;t say much and looked uncomfortable. I realized talk of fashion and hairdos probably wasn&#39;t his thing.<br />
<br />
When I noticed Sarah was back nearby fetching another beer. I said to Daniel &quot;You&#39;ve met Rod haven&#39;t you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well come here then&quot; I pulled him across to Sarah &quot;Rod do you remember Daniel. He needs rescuing from girl talk&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;G&#39;day Daniel. Grab a beer and I&#39;ll introduce you around&quot; They walked back over the Charlie and the other blokes.<br />
<br />
Karen joined us along with Kate the 6ft goal shooter from the netball team. I was partially relieved to see that she was wearing a bikini as well, even if it was mostly covered by a netting wrap. She looked quite amazonian. &quot;Hi Kate&quot;  I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Sarah, your skirt looks great&quot;<br />
<br />
Well I&#39;m just glad someone else is in a bikini&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve one on too, under this dress&quot; piped in Mary &quot;I&#39;m just waiting for your boss to turn up. Then all will be revealed&quot; She giggled<br />
<br />
&quot;All we heard about last Wednesday was how hunky your boss is&quot; said Kate &quot;He obviously made quite an impression on Mary&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I heard, he gave you a bit of a pash&quot; said Karen &quot;Naughty girl, what would Rod say?&quot; We all giggled<br />
<br />
&quot;So is Alan coming?&quot; I addressed Karen.<br />
<br />
&quot;He said he would but maybe not until about 9&quot; He was going boating today.<br />
<br />
It was starting to get dark and Karen asked if I could help her light some oil lamps around the pool. We did so and the scene transformed as the sun set and the candle light took over. &quot;This looks great&quot; I told Karen <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; she said &quot;I ended up doing everything myself&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What has happened to your brother&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We had a fight. He wanted his bikie friends to come and I said no. So he boycotted the party altogether&quot;<br />
.......<br />
Karen and Kate bought out some more food and that got the males and females back into a mixed group. Sarah gave me another glass of punch and had another beer himself. I reminded him that we would need a taxi if he had anymore. He said that would be fine and that he had already deposited his keys with Karen so that he would not be tempted to drive. He whispered to me that he  was thinking he could use the medallion in the morning to cure any hangover he might acquire. Ok I thought. He is set for a big night.<br />
<br />
Karen got everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Time for some party games&quot; she said. &quot;Organize yourselves in a circle, make sure you alternate boys and girls&quot; I found myself between Sarah and Daniel. &quot;Ok we are going to play pass the orange. If you drop it or take too long you either have to skoal a drink or lose an article of clothing&quot; She produced an orange and placed it under Bianca&#39;s chin. &quot;We have to go around the circle 3 times&quot;<br />
<br />
Bianca was able to transfer the orange to Charlie who in turn passed it successfully to Rose. Unfortunately for Rose the orange fell as she tried to pass it to a man I did not know. Karen picked it up and passed it to the next person who happened to be Rebecca. &quot;Ok Rose and Paul skoal or strip&quot; said Karen. Both choose to have a drink. <br />
<br />
The game continued, I counted 20 of us in the circle. I estimate that on about every 5th pass the orange was dropped. Mary was the 1st person to choose strip. She took off a shoe. Which Karen picked up and put on a chair in the middle of our circle. Jenny was positioned at the other side of Daniel. They dropped the orange. Jenny also chose strip and lost a shoe. Daniel did the same. I was able to pick up the orange and place it under my chin. I successfully passed it on to Sarah but he dropped it trying to pass it on to Kate. Both chose strip. Kate lost a shoe but Sarah decided to lose his shirt. <br />
<br />
 &quot;Trying to show off those guns are you&quot; I giggled into his ear.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ve never been able to go topless in public before. Just making the most of the opportunity&quot; he whispered back.<br />
<br />
The orange continued a second circuit. This time around there were 4 more &#39;skoals&#39; and 4 &#39;strips&#39;. Noticeably Jenny and Mary both lost their second shoes. I had to get very close to Daniel as he passed me the orange. I could feel my left breast pushing against his chest and his whiskers against my neck. We transferred the orange successfully. However as I passed it on to Sarah it slipped to the floor. We both choose to skoal. Karen bought me a glass of the punch which I managed to down in one gulp. Everyone cheered.<br />
 <br />
When the orange got back to Bianca, Karen told us to do the last lap in the opposite direction. So the orange came back to me via Sarah. I survived this third pass but Jenny messed up again and lost her skirt. She made a great show of stripping it off leaving her just in her swim suit. <br />
<br />
When the orange successfully returned to Bianca, Karen announced &quot;We will have a 5 minute break while I set up the next game. Sarah and Rebecca, could you collect the clothes on the chair and put it on my bed. Everyone else top up your glasses&quot; <br />
<br />
I picked up the shirt, skirt and a collection of footwear and followed Rebecca to what must have been Karen&#39;s room. I used the opportunity to visit the toilet and change my tampon. <br />
<br />
When I returned Sarah handed me a new glass of punch. He had a punch in his own hand. &quot;I have finished my beers&quot; he explained. &quot;Did you notice Alan has arrived&quot; <br />
<br />
I looked towards where he indicated and saw Karen, Daniel and Mary talking to Alan, who was looking smart in board shorts and a polo shirt. I reminded myself that under all circumstances I should not thank him for anything, safest to not even mingle with him. I was convinced that a magician &#39;Mr Illusio&#39; had hypnotised me so that I had a compulsion to give Alan a kiss whenever I thanked him. I did not know whether Alan had the same compulsion as well and I didn&#39;t want to find out.<br />
<br />
Karen was calling for everyone&#39;s attention. She called the next game &#39;Musical Men&#39;. The males had to assume a crawling position in a circle in the middle of the patio. We girls were to dance in a circle around the outside of the male ring. When the music stopped we had to find a &quot;Man to Mount&#39; that is, we had to claim a male by sitting on his back. Last girl to find a seat was eliminated. <br />
Karen asked Daniel to be judge for the game. This meant we now had one more girl than there were seats available. The judge had to watch the girls dancing and disqualify anyone who wasn&#39;t dancing vigorously enough. After each round an additional male would join the judges. Daniel was also tasked with the job of turning the music on and off.<br />
We assumed starting positions and Daniel started the song &#39;Girls Just want to have Fun&#39;. I began dancing trying to wiggle the grass skirt as much as I could. After about two laps the music stopped, I made for Sarah (In Rod&#39;s body) but was beaten by Kate. Quickly I looked around for another mount. The guy Karen had earlier called Paul was free. I flung myself at him and just beat one of the other girls onto his back. Rose was left without a mount and was hence disqualified. She had to &#39;Skoal or Strip&#39;.<br />
<br />
I had learned my lesson and next time the music stopped sat on the nearest &#39;. This time it was Charlie. Bianca was eliminated.     <br />
I managed to make it to the last 3 girls but was beaten by a lunging Mary. The &#39;Mount&#39; I had lost the battle over was Alan. I ended up drinking another glass of punch.<br />
<br />
The last game for the evening was called &quot;Mintie Munch&quot;. Karen put a box of Mints on a table. We girls had to feed the Mints to the guys. The guys were to lie on the ground face up. We had to put a mint between our knees and without using our hands deposit one in each males mouth. The winner would be the girl who could feed the most guys in 5 minutes. To do so we had to waddle over each of the males then squat over his face and hopefully drop the mint into his mouth. The lower we could get in the squat the more chance of the mint dropping into his mouth. As I was wearing a grass skirt it covered the guys face when I squatted. You couldn&#39;t help but observe that the males enjoyed the experience. <br />
<br />
I was the only girl to feed all 11 guys and found myself the winner. Had I finally found my calling in life? Would this become an Olympic sport? I basked in the glory for a full 5 minutes. <br />
<br />
Sarah was there to share a celebratory drink with me. He said it was a very stimulating game. <br />
<br />
Karen turned the music up a bit and encouraged us to start dancing. I had enjoyed dancing during &#39;Musical Men&#39; so I readily took to the floor,  jiggling my bottom and getting the grass skirt twirling. Sarah joined me but I suspect he was starting to feel the effects of all the alcohol he had been drinking. After 5 minutes he said he needed to sit down. I was really enjoying myself so stayed on the floor dancing with the netball girls. I noticed Mary was dancing with Alan, while Daniel and Karen seemed to enjoy dancing together.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later I heard a splashed and looked to see Charlie and Sarah in the pool. Soon after Rebecca and another girl whose name I could not remember had joined them. Bianca took me aside and said &quot;We should claim our men&quot; she took off her dress to reveal a black one piece swim suit. I stepped out my grass skirt and sandals so I now was clad only in the floral string bikini.<br />
Bianca stepped to the edge of the pool and elegantly dived in, effortlessly gliding through the water up to Charlie and wrapped her arms around him. I decided to try and mimic her.<br />
 <br />
I stepped to the edge of the pool and dived. Maybe It was because my center of gravity was different or maybe another reason. I ended up doing a massive belly whacker, swallowed a mouthful of the pool-water and found myself unable to reach the bottom of the pool. This body didn&#39;t appear to know how to swim. I was flailing my arms and not making any progress. I was struggling to keep my head above the water long enough to take a breath. I was starting to panic.<br />
<br />
Suddenly I felt some strong arms lifting me so my head was above water. I could take a breath. I was gently pulled to side of the pool and found myself sitting on the on a ledge. Being held in place by those same strong arms. I got my breathing under control and looked to see who my rescuer was. <br />
<br />
It was Alan. He was still wearing his polo shirt and in the water. Without thinking I said &quot;Thank-you Alan&quot;. Suddenly I had an overwhelming desire to kiss my rescuer. I leaned towards him ready to feel his lips against mine. <br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa there Sarah&quot; His arms held me in place on the ledge. &quot;Stay where you are&quot;..... &quot;I think she nearly fainted&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen came to me and helped me to totally exit the pool. She wrapped a towel around me and took me into the house &quot;Would you like to lie down? Maybe a warm drink?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine....I&#39;m just embarrassed&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll make you a coffee, I need one myself anyway&quot; She put the kettle on. &quot;I&#39;ll get Rod&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah came in and asked &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dived in then found out I couldn&#39;t swim&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ohh... I suppose I should have warned you. I&#39;ve always been unco in the water.... Are you feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah I&#39;ll be fine. I suppose I have ruined the party&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way. You have been the life of the party&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How are you Sarah&quot; It was Alan. Daniel and Kate were with him.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine, someone rescued me&quot; How do I show gratitude without saying thank-you? &quot;It was much appreciated&quot; Phew no kissing impulses.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here is a coffee for you&quot; said Karen. &quot;Anyone else want a Cuppa?&quot;.......&quot;Would you like a dry shirt Alan?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, but I&#39;ll take it off and put it in the drier if that&#39;s ok&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Of course follow me&quot; <br />
<br />
I drank the coffee and felt much better for it. &quot;How&#39;s the party going out there&quot; I asked Daniel. <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s really rocking, Everyone is either dancing or in the pool&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I&#39;d better just stick to dancing&quot;<br />
<br />
Alan and Karen returned. Alan was really ripped without his shirt on. &quot;Feeling better?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah ready to rejoin the party&quot; I said &quot;Come on Rod&quot;<br />
......<br />
Back out on the patio it was as Daniel had said. Most of the girls were now purely in their swimwear and the guys shirtless.  Mary was wearing a glittery green bikini and danced up to Alan as we rejoined  the crowd. I began swaying to the music and soon forgot my recent dramas. This body really did enjoy dancing. If you had told me three weeks ago I would spend hours dancing in a floral string bikini at a pool party. Well I would have had you committed.<br />
<br />
It was now well after midnight and Karen had turned the music down. A slower song came on and I was enjoying dancing with Sarah&#39;s arms wrapped around me. Since my episode in the pool we had both stopped drinking. I looked over to see Karen and Daniel also clasping each other tightly. I suspect I was seeing a relationship develop. <br />
<br />
Alan came up with his shirt back on &quot;Goodnight Karen, Great party, I&#39;m glad I came. Goodnight Daniel and Sarah, See you next week. Bye Rod&quot;<br />
<br />
Other people were also started to leave and Sarah suggested we get a taxi back home. While Sarah booked a ride I retrieved my skirt and shoes and collected Sarah&#39;s clothes from the bedroom. We said goodbye to everyone and went out the front to wait for the taxi. I retrieved my wrap from Rod&#39;s car.<br />
 <br />
The taxi arrived and before long we were back home. I changed into Sarah&#39;s lavender nightie and removed the tampon. When I returned to the bedroom Sarah was on the bed snoring, still in his board shorts and tee-shirt. Oh well I thought. I returned to the bathroom and put on some panties and a pad. I had enjoyed an eventful night.</p>
