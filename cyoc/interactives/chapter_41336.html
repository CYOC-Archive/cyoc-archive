<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dan stared into the mirror across from where he sat on the toilet and thought to himself, &quot;Disgusting,&quot; as he took in the pink and white dress he was wearing.<br />
<br />
The day had passed in a rather confusing blur. The bus had picked him up and taken him to school, just not the high school. Instead it had taken him to the local elementary school and unable to think of a proper argument to give voice too, he'd exited the school bus, only to be greeted by two girls, who called him Cathy and insisted upon talking to him as if they had always been friends.<br />
<br />
Allowing himself to be led into the second grade classroom, Dan took a seat next to the girls, who he suddenly remembered the names of; Tanya and Anni.<br />
<br />
And except for the fact that he didn't undergo anymore transformations, Dan thought the school progressed rather normally; or as normal as it could be for someone who had just been cursed by their older sister.<br />
<br />
True, everyone called him Cathy and he had to use the girl's bathroom when he had to go. True, he now for some reason stumbled at the problems the teacher gave him, but he figured this was to be expected if he was just learning all this information. But Dan knew that something was off. He wasn't a seven year old girl. He was a sixteen year old boy and he should be in high school. &quot;Shouldn't I,&quot; he asked himself for the ninth time that day as he got on the bus to go home, waving goodbye to Tanya and Anni.<br />
<br />
Home, his mother insisted on giving him a bath and then giving him a pink dress with a white collar and white lacy frill around the cuffs to wear, all the while telling him, &quot;We're going to see your grandparents tonight, sweetie.&quot;<br />
<br />
And then his mother made sure he wore a pair of underwear and tights, commenting as she watched him dress, &quot;I know you don't like wearing them, but please, for me, wear them tonight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kat said pretty much nothing to him the whole time and when she did say something, it was to throw a plush doll at him and with an evil smile on her face, she told him, &quot;Cathy, mom and I have both told you to stay out of my room.&quot;<br />
<br />
After all that, Dan was helped into the minivan where he had to sit next to his sister, while their father got in the passenger seat and their mother got behind the wheel. The hour long journey was spent in silence with nothing but the radio playing rather softly and Dan hoping that his grandparents would comment on there being something wrong.<br />
<br />
But all hopes had been dashed and instead grandma and grandpa had welcomed them, commented on how Dan was growing up so big and wishing Kat a happy birthday and then explaining what was for dinner.<br />
<br />
During dinner, Dan sat quietly and ate. As the main dinner course came to a close, Dan started to feel an odd sensation in his spine and tailbone. And just as desert was being served the feeling grew and grew until Dan felt a jolt of pain and suddenly he could actually feel something sliding out of his dress and twitching back and forth.<br />
<br />
Asking, &quot;May I be excused,&quot; he stood and hurried to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
There he found that the weird feeling he felt was do to the fact that he'd just grown a really odd looking tail. If he didn't know any better, he'd said it was a rodent tail, &quot;Like on a mouse of rat,&quot; Dan thought to himself.<br />
<br />
That tail in question was long and whip-like, but unlike a mouse of rat tail it was white and covered in a short, soft downy like fur. Carefully he pushed his tights and underwear down and hiking up his dress, sighed in relief when he saw that he at least still had his penis and testicles and then turned and looked at his tail.<br />
<br />
It came down straight from his tail bone and covered up his anus, making his butt look flatter then ever. Sighing, he sat down on the toilet as he realized that he did indeed have to pee.<br />
<br />
Afterward, he pulled up his underwear and tights, making sure his tail went through the the hole in each undergarment, and exited the bathroom. Back at the table, he sat down to eat his desert. Mom and dad where talking with his grandparents while his sister sat next to him and made faces that he thought made her look like a rodent.<br />
<br />
Carefully, she leaned over and whispered, &quot;I always liked Angelina Ballerina. I hope you do to,&quot; at which point she sat back up in her chair and went back to her desert.<br />
<br />
Tailing sticking out the back of his dress and through the rungs of the chair, Dan once again asked himself, &quot;What did I ever do to be put into such a humiliating situation and how do I undo it,&quot; as he suddenly realized that he was close to tears.</p>
