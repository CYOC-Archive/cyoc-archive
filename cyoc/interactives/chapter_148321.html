<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your mind races, trying to figure out what to say, how to fix things. You can barely form a coherent sentence. Jack likes hairy girls, just like how Lisa is now.<br />
<br />
&quot;I-uh-um,&quot; you stammer. You look at Jack and confess, &quot;I gotta be honest. I really don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just don&#39;t say anything to anyone, got it?&quot; he asks firmly. He stares at you with such intensity almost as if he was daring you to try telling someone. You quickly nod and pretend to use a key to lock your lips shut. Jack visibly relaxes slightly but still nervously twiddles his thumbs.<br />
<br />
The silence gives you enough time to think out a plan. Whether or not the plan will work is another situation entirely. You ponder if you even should try to fix the situation at all, but you realize that this situation was your fault in the first place. And now, you can&#39;t seem to ignore the worried and frustrated expression on Jack&#39;s face as he keeps glancing from the floor to the door every few seconds. As things are now, there is no way on this planet that Lisa would go along with any sort of idea of growing out all of that hair for Jack. Even if you undid Lisa&#39;s hair growth, that still wouldn&#39;t change Jack&#39;s attraction to hairy girls. He&#39;d be stuck worrying about even sharing his attraction with Lisa. It would ultimately result in the two of them breaking up. You can&#39;t envision any alternative to that scenario. You then consider changing Jack&#39;s attraction as well as Lisa&#39;s body hair. One downside is the fact that you can probably avoid detection by changing one person. Changing two people while unnoticed would be exponentially more difficult in this dorm. The other downside is the fact that you&#39;d be changing one of your friends without his consent to make him happy. That might not be exactly better. But what if there was a way to make Jack&#39;s attraction to a hairy Lisa be more normal or acceptable enough that Lisa would be less likely to reject him for it?<br />
<br />
<i>&quot;She was hairier than me,&quot;</i> Jack&#39;s words echo in your mind. She was hairier than Jack. You look at Jack&#39;s arms. He has a decent dusting of hair on his muscular forearm. He could be hairy no problem because he was a man.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s it. There&#39;s your solution. Hopefully this will work.<br />
<br />
You readjust your pillow so that your laptop is laying on top of it in your lap. You reposition so your back is against the wall. You subtly grab the flashlight and hold it between you and the laptop so that Jack can&#39;t see it. You switch it to &quot;u&quot; so that neither Lisa nor Jack notice anything. You then set it to a high intensity blue. You finally set it on &quot;nm&quot; for the flashlight&#39;s normal function. No matter what clothes she may, or may not, be wearing, they need to change as well for this to work properly. You hold the flashlight covertly between your thigh and your pillow and pretend to surf the Internet while you wait for Lisa to return.<br />
<br />
After another five minutes passed before the door to your dorm opens. Lisa quickly walks in and slams the door behind her. Jack quickly gets to his feet. You silently look up from your laptop. Lisa is completely dressed and completely shaven. Her eyebrows seem a little on the thick side, and she fidgets with her shirt. Maybe she could only shave her arms, legs, and face. She ignores Jack and glares at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get the fuck out,&quot; she orders you.<br />
<br />
You frown back at her. &quot;This is my dorm room. I&#39;m not going anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I need privacy and don&#39;t need your creepy ass leering at me,&quot; she retorts. You find that piece of information to quite humorous. If only she knew who found her more attractive right now.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; you say. &quot;I guess I will stop writing this email to the RA about someone breaking into our dorm room and doing an awful, traumatizing prank on a dear friend of ours. Maybe instead I&#39;ll inform the cheerleading squad to pack more razors for the next game.&quot; Lisa stiffens up at your clear threat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Knock it off, both of you,&quot; Jack barks irritably. He turns to you. &quot;Keep composing that email. We may need to get new keys to our room.&quot; He turns to Lisa. &quot;He&#39;s staying. He didn&#39;t do this to you, so he might as well help us figure out who did.&quot; Lisa huffs and folds her arms. She must really be shaken if that was all it took for Jack to calm her down. &quot;So, how did it go?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I got most of it off,&quot; she answers. &quot;But the more, erm, difficult spots will need more attention to detail in private.&quot; She gestures to her shirt and shorts. &quot;At least these can hide those spots.&quot; She fails to notice Jack&#39;s disappointed expression, but you don&#39;t.<br />
<br />
You take a deep breath and turn the flashlight on. The bright blue light shines on Lisa&#39;s dainty feet and flip flops. The change is slow but noticeable. Her feet widen and thicken. You think you can see more hair trying to sprout up, but it&#39;s obvious that Lisa had paid a lot of attention to detail already. Her pink flip flops turn black and become simple men&#39;s flip flops. You move the light up to her legs. They begin to swell with muscle, the skin losing its softness and becoming more rugged. Lisa subconsciously widens her stance to better accommodate her swelling thighs. You shine the light on her ass, which simultaneously loses some of its jiggly fat and gains firm muscle. As an apology of sorts, you shine the light on her crotch for a little longer than you normally would have wanted. A bulge appears in her crotch and becomes substantial in size. Moving further upward, you shine the light on her hips, which narrow some more. Her small, black shorts lengthen into long, white basketball shorts. With the light on her stomach, you can see her core begin to fill in. No doubt she has at least a six-pack under that shirt now. You shine the light on her chest and watch as her tits deflate rapidly only to be replaced by a very prominent shelf of pecs protruding from the athletic tank-top Lisa now wears. Her pecs protrude out from her now large upper torso, not as much as her tits did but enough that the tank-top seemed snug across her chest. Moving to her arms, they quickly ballooned with muscle. Her fingers thickened as did the hair on her hands, which she interestingly had not completely shaved while she had been gone. For all intents and purposes, Lisa was now a very muscular and incredibly masculine man with only the head of a woman. But with a sweep of the light, that changes. Her jawline becomes more defined. Her Adam&#39;s Apple pushes out against her neck. Her long dark hair retracts into her skull and reshapes into a very handsome crew cut. Any make-up she might have still had on disintegrates, leaving a very rugged and very handsome but distinctively male face behind.<br />
<br />
When all is said and done, Lisa the woman is replaced by a ruggedly handsome, muscular man in the span of maybe a little over a minute. You shut off the light and quickly look back to your laptop as if you weren&#39;t doing anything.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks for your help, Jack,&quot; the man says in a really deep and warm baritone voice. &quot;I probably would still be in the bathroom freaking the fuck out right now if it hadn&#39;t been for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, Les,&quot; Jack replies. So that&#39;s what Lisa&#39;s name has become, you ponder silently. Jack grabs Les&#39;s hands. &quot;What are boyfriends for, right?&quot; He then kisses Les right on the lips. Les seems to melt a little, very Lisa-like, as they kiss. You breathe a silent sigh of relief. They are still together.<br />
<br />
&quot;And to think this whole thing started because I wanted to surprise you,&quot; Les mutters. He glances over towards you and glares at you. Even as a man, Lisa still hates you. &quot;I still think you had something to do with this.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jack interjects before you could retort, &quot;Babe, there&#39;s no way he would do that to you. Besides, on a guy like you, it&#39;s not like the hair would seem out of place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Les turns to him and says, &quot;That doesn&#39;t change the fact that I try really, really, REALLY hard to keep away all of that hair! I looked so fucking ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, you didn&#39;t,&quot; Jack counters. He glances your way for a moment. You raise an eyebrow in confusion and maybe even a little concern. Was he about to tell Les his secret? Did he like hairy guys now? Or did he still like hairy girls? How would Les react? You grip the flashlight a little tighter, ready to jump in before things get too out of hand.</p>
