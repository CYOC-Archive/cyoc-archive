<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As he scratched the back of his head, Jeff wondered what type of animal he wanted to become. Asking himself over and over, he mulled over one idea after another as he considered what he wanted to be as he muttered, &quot;Hmm,&quot; and, &quot;Let&#39;s see.&quot; Looking at Sally, he started to articulate in a nervous way, &quot;Why don&#39;t you turn me into a...&quot; but faltered when he had second doubts.<br />
<br />
He believed it should&#39;ve been easy to decide, but found there was something holding him back, and not just that he was being offered the chance to turn into an animal. Feeling it was something more, Jeff tried to determine what as he considered it might be because he didn&#39;t know which beast he wanted to be turned into. Thinking of how he&#39;d dressed as a bull, he toyed with the idea of how cool it&#39;d actually be to become a male cow as he decided the one thing he didn&#39;t want was to be female. Rubbing his hand across the back of his head, a habit he had when nervous or indecisive, he glanced at Sally and commented, &quot;I truly don&#39;t know. And what about the Chronivac. It&#39;ll disappear the instant I become an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not if we alter reality now,&quot; Sally offered and when Jeff peered at her with a puzzled look, mostly because he found it hard to comprehend that his former dog knew more about the programme than he did, he listened and watched as Sally showed him things with the Chronivac he hadn&#39;t figured out yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;See,&quot; the woman said as she finished typing. &quot;If I hit execute now, this will make it so that I&#39;ll have been your older sister. And when I change back later to a golden retriever, the programme will reset reality again, making it so that you never had any sibling, that it’s just you, your parents and me, your faithful dog,&quot; and reading over the information, Jeff decided it might actually work better this way, if he could only work out what seemed off about all of this and what type of critter he wanted to become.<br />
<br />
Lost in thought, Jeff tried to approach the problem from different angles before he sighed and decided he was making an issue out of nothing. Nodding at the computer screen, he said, &quot;All right. Let&#39;s start with this and see what happens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Done,&quot; the woman stated a little to eagerly and inputting a few more things, she hit the button to execute her commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;So how long will this...&quot; Jeff started to inquire, but before he was able to finish, he shook his head and took an involuntary step back as reality reshaped itself around him and inside his head.<br />
<br />
Pictures on the desk changed to show not a boy with a dog, but rather a boy and girl hanging out, whilst elsewhere in the house, the office his mom and dad had set up for themselves became a young woman&#39;s bedroom. Groaning as new memories forced themselves upon him, Jeff had to sit down after a moment when the pain in his head became too much. Sitting still at the computer, Sally was in an equal amount of discomfort as she experienced the new changes that not only included memories, but also bits of knowledge she&#39;d given herself when Jeff hadn&#39;t been looking.<br />
<br />
The pain ebbing after some time, it was Sally who first did anything as she stood and exited Jeff&#39;s room. Suddenly realising the woman had left, Jeff was worried she might do something risky or foolish. Forcing himself to stand, he took a moment to orientate himself as he was overcome with a wave of dizziness. The moment passing, he hurried out of his room, and stopped when he heard Sally&#39;s voice call out, &quot;I&#39;ll be with you in just a moment,&quot; from a room his old memories insisted was his parents&#39; office, whilst his new ones said it was his sister&#39;s bedroom. Wondering what it was she was doing, Jeff took a step toward the room, but stopped, a feeling coming over him he hadn&#39;t considered he&#39;d experience as he sensed it might be better to give his sister her privacy, despite how close they&#39;d always been. Finding this odd, he wandered back to his room after a bit.<br />
<br />
Mind on how much reality had changed, he wondered if the same thing would happen if he decided on becoming an animal. Knowing he&#39;d made up his decision, that if Sally could become human, it might be interesting for him to become a beast and see the world from her perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before she was my sister, of course,&quot; he reasoned as he mentally listed animals, considered the option of being a bull, and found he was unable to decide.<br />
<br />
When his sister finally returned, now wearing a tight dress that had thin shoulder straps, a lower piece that ballooned out and came down to her knees and a top portion that hugged and amplified her body, Jeff tried not to stare as he said, &quot;I cannot decide,&quot; and nodding in the direction of the programme, he furthered, &quot;There are so many creature I think might be cool to be, but which one draws me the most, I don&#39;t know. So, I was thinking, since I made you human, why don&#39;t you chose the animal I&#39;d become.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally smiled at this, and nodded. Telling her former master, now younger brother, &quot;I think that is an excellent idea,&quot; she headed over to the computer. Sitting down before it, she started to type, bringing up Jeff&#39;s profile first after she saved her own.<br />
<br />
Still unable to wrap his mind around how quick she was to master the use of the Chronivac, Jeff sat back down on his bed. Curious to know what type of creature she&#39;d make him, he was tempted to inquire, but figured to wait and see. From where she sat at the computer, Sally scrolled through the options before she changed Jeff&#39;s species from human to otter. Finding the programme wanted information on age, she lowered his age to one and half, and when it asked for it, almost set the max age at twenty-three, but thinking it’d be funnier, set it so he’d become immortal at age eight. Entering more bits of data, she mulled over something for a moment before she changed Jeff&#39;s sex and gender to female, but left his sexual preference as heterosexual. Finishing, she brought back up her profile and entered a couple more things, including that the Chronivac belonged to her. Thinking and reading over everything, she finished and turned to Jeff.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finished,&quot; she said and when her former master turned brother stood, she listened as he asked, &quot;So, what did you decide?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a surprise,&quot; she told him.<br />
<br />
This wasn&#39;t the answer Jeff had hoped for, but figuring it&#39;d do, he said, &quot;So, how long will I be an animal? Cause, I was figuring to change you back in a couple hours when our mom and dad get home, thus was thinking maybe the same thing should also be set for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
Having expected this, Sally almost faltered in her reply. Looking at Jeff, catching herself before she could do so, she smiled and answered, &quot;Of course that still stands. You&#39;ll experience life as an animal for a few hours, whilst I experience life as a human in the same amount of time, all before we change back.&quot;<br />
<br />
A nod of agreement and Jeff said, &quot;Cool,&quot; and with another nod, he consented for Sally to hit the command to execute.<br />
<br />
She found she needed no such go ahead, as she felt compelled to activate the programme whenever she chose. But, thinking it&#39;d be better to give her brother the sense of still being in charge, that she was in some ways still the dog she used to be, Sally smiled and commented, &quot;Okay,&quot; the moment he gave her the go ahead, and turning back to the computer, she tapped the icon to save and institute all changes.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to expect at first, Jeff was alarmed when his room suddenly started to grow bigger. Realising quickly that it wasn’t his bedroom that was getting larger, but that he was getting smaller, he was alarmed when his clothes fell away, leaving him standing naked in front of his sister. Feeling embarrassed by such a thing, he stumbled over his shoes and a couple steps from his clothes as he tried to cover his privates. Smiling at the sight of what Jeff was doing, Sally watched as he seemed to grow younger, whilst his nipples disappeared, and reformed as four teats on his lower abdomen.<br />
<br />
Completely unaware of this, Jeff was more focused on the pain and discomfort his body was going through as it not only shrunk, but started to reform to a four legged state. Losing his balance after a bit, he dropped down to place his morphing hands on the floor. Looking up at Sally, even as his head started to reform and his neck realigned, he tried to demand to know what she&#39;d turned him, but found he&#39;d lost the capacity for human speech. Growing uncertain by this, thinking he might have made a mistake, he uttered a noise that might have been a gasp as a strange sensation twisted its way from his abdomen, down into his groin, and seemed to tug at his cock and balls. Feeling it growing, he tried to shift in place to look at himself, but unfamiliar with how his body now was, he was unable to witness it as his male genitalia shrank and turned inward, leaving behind a vulva with the usual openings for a vagina and urethra, and clitoris complete with baubellum.<br />
<br />
Inside his body, the moment the female reproductive organs finished forming, Jeff shivered as he was suddenly inundated with female hormones, though not enough to say he was an adult or ready to mate. Oblivious to this, still struggling to see what was going on with his cock and balls, of which he no longer had either, Jeff was distracted from the task when he noticed his hands and arms were finishing their changes. Watching as the limbs shortened to become legs, he also noted how his finger nails fell out and retractable claws replaced them as webbing formed between somewhat between each of the shrinking digits.<br />
<br />
Within moments, his feet, all four of them, had finished transforming, and Jeff found himself staring at two paws. Certain if he&#39;d look at his other feet he&#39;d see the same, he was struck by how odd it all was as an itchy sensation washed over him and fur started to sprout, first in patches, then in a more even coating. As this happened, Jeff shifted in place as his tailbone started to extended outward and his back end was altered so it resembled that of an female river otter. Thinking the last to change was the placement of his ears and eyes, Jeff started to utter sounds of pain as the inside of his head erupted and a new life forced itself upon him. Wanting it to stop, feeling like it was pushing out who he used to be, he squeezed his eyes shut. Finding it was getting more and more difficult to remember himself as Jeff, that he was human, he snapped open his eyes, and forgetting he was unable to speak anymore he was about to demand that Sally stop this when it suddenly came to him he was outside.<br />
<br />
For a brief moment, Jeff was aware that she was resting on a rather warm rock, whilst nearby was a river. Wanting to know how she’d gotten where she was, she never got the chance as it all seemed to fade away, like the rest of her former humanity. The female stared at the river a moment longer before she shook herself and then slipped into the water, hungry and knowing their was fish nearby.<br />
<br />
Back in Jeff&#39;s old room, Sally looked at the spot the boy had been and stated, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. But I shan&#39;t be going back to being a dog. Not in a few hours, not ever,” before she turned, scooped up the disk and everything else for the Chronivac and headed for her room. Thinking about what else she might do with the programme, she gave a grunt of discomfort as reality again altered itself, and all traces of her younger brother disappeared from the life that she now saw as being hers.</p>
