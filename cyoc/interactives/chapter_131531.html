<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The following day you went with Pugn out to a small part in a yard. Pugn said &quot;Well we&#39;re mostly training your magic right now as any physical training isn&#39;t really going to be effective.&quot; He held out some bracelets and said &quot;Let me put these on you.&quot; You held your hands out and then he put one of the bracelets on you. They were an odd obsidian looking stuff, and as he put the second one on you you just collapsed. You tried to move anything, but your appendages felt limp and unresponsive. Pugn said &quot;Those bracelets are special manacles which cut off the conscious brain from your body. In laymans terms you can&#39;t move your body but you can still do things like breath. They don&#39;t really work well on us elves because we can use our magic to help move our bodies. As a bodyguard one of the bigger ways you will get stronger than the average man is by mixing magic power in your muscles. This is step one in training. Since the manacles mean you can&#39;t use your muscles you have to use magic instead. It wont be pretty at first, but you should be able to figure out how to scoot across the ground.&quot; <br />
<br />
You were on  the ground screaming in your mind &quot;Show me how to move myself with magic first!!!&quot; After a few seconds you calmed yourself down and thought &quot;Ok... use that magic feeling you did at the arena... maybe meditate or concentrate?&quot; You felt magic gather and tried moving your body up an inch. You didn&#39;t sense any magic doing anything, but you could tell from the friction on the ground something was trying to slide you. Although you weren&#39;t actually moving. <br />
<br />
An hour goes by with no headway and Pugn said &quot;Try moving your fingers individually. Should require less power.&quot; You took his advice and after a minute you were able to wiggle your pinky and Pugn said &quot;Progress. The idea for what you should try doing is move a finger at a time, then work on your hand, then your forearm, then your entire arm. Make progress till you can move your entire body. I&#39;m not looking for finesse but raw power. I&#39;m going to leave you alone for a little while.&quot; <br />
<br />
You wanted to scream &quot;Don&#39;t leave the little girl who can&#39;t move a muscle alone!!!&quot; but there he went leaving a little girl who couldn&#39;t move a muscle alone. Your face in the ground you could only tell after awhile when it was getting late by the fact that the sun&#39;s warmth was going away. No one seemed to be around so a little scared you attempted to move. A sensation of grass moving under you. Feeling good about your minor accomplishment you pushed yourself forward. Moving further and further forward till you looked like you were imitating a snail. Then after a few seconds you stopped feeling incredibly exhausted. <br />
<br />
A few minutes after you heard Pugn&#39;s voice say &quot;Oi kid! Training for today is after let&#39;s get some foo...&quot; there was a pause like he was looking at something odd. he picked you up and continued &quot;Sadly for this training to really work we&#39;ll have to keep the manacles on till you can take them off yourself.&quot; Slumped inable to talk you let  yourself be brought to a spot at the dinner table where conversations were going on. <br />
<br />
You heard your sister next to you ask &quot;So how&#39;s Kids magic training going?&quot; <br />
<br />
Pugn said &quot;I think she&#39;s made a lot of progress. Maybe it&#39;s the orc tenacity in her?&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother asked &quot;Oh how far could she have gone?&quot; <br />
<br />
Pugn tilted his head a second and said &quot;I think about two inches.&quot; Some elves nearby started laughing or booing as coins started exchanging hands. You heard a &quot;told you!&quot; here and there. <br />
<br />
Your mother said &quot;Rather impressive. When it was my first time I could only move my finger. She&#39;ll be walking in no time.&quot; You were seated in a position where you were face to face with some sort of smoothie that would have to do for your dinner. A bit tired but having a short rest you tried to lean yourself forward as your mother continued &quot;Now I should probably help my dear kid with her dinner.&quot; as you had managed to nudge yourself forward and bang your head against the smoothie glass spilling the contents on the large dinner table. Several laughs echo&#39;d as more coins exchanged hands. Your mother concerned grabbed you and set you back on your seat and picked up the smoothie glass which was mostly empty. She sighed and said &quot;Kid, don&#39;t worry too much. We&#39;ll help you while you still are getting used to your magic. We&#39;ve all had to do it and your making a lot of progress. I&#39;ll be back with more food just don&#39;t try to strain yourself.&quot; A few minutes later your mother had came back and helped you consume your smoothie. It tasted of some sort of berry. You couldn&#39;t quite tell what kind though. When getting ready for bed your mother and sister got in a bath with you and helped you wash. the tub was large and mostly still and you were able to float rather well while the other two were chatting. Thinking that this was a good opportunity you started pushing yourself with magic around. It was kind of fun. <br />
<br />
The following days were mostly the same. Practice magic without using a muscle, get food, take a bath, sleep, rinse and repeat. After a week you were able to bend your body to an upright position, and slide the manacles off your arms. Pugn clapped as you took in a deep breath and said &quot;FINALLY I CAN SPEAK!!!&quot; You stretch your arms to the sky and you felt your magic swell. An instant later your entire body expanded. Your clothes got really tight and burst at the seems as your magic managed to undo the curse you were put under. Looking down instead of seeing your normal body you saw a nice pair of B-cup breasts and a naked female body. Immediately embarrassed you covered your breasts and groin and asked &quot;What the? Why am I a girl still!?!&quot; <br />
<br />
Pugn chuckled a bit and turned around then said &quot;Well the child curse is real easy to break. A small body can only hold so much magic you see. The female curse though is a lot trickier. You need some big male inspiration in some way to get rid of that! I mean you don&#39;t have to get rid of it. May make spending time with your mother and sister easier. We&#39;ll continue magic training tomorrow.&quot; After getting dressed quickly you went to dinner a little late. You took your seat next to your mother and sister who both looked at you somewhat unexpectedly.  <br />
<br />
You sister said &quot;You got big!&quot; <br />
<br />
Your mother said &quot;Indeed, It only took you a  week what it would take a bunch of elves maybe 3 or even a month.&quot; <br />
<br />
You went to a fork and knife and said &quot;I&#39;m eating with my own hands tonight!&quot; The berry smoothies were nice and tasty but as soon as a bunch of nice cuts of meat were introduced you pounced for a lot of it and just started tearing into the meat. A bunch of the other elves just stared as the nice pretty elf (with some orc mixed in) girl started devouring a lot of meat. <br />
<br />
Your mother muttered &quot;I have to teach kid table manners...&quot; <br />
<br />
Pugn laughed and said &quot;Looks like he found more male inspiration... Although more animalistic in nature.&quot; as your body started growing further and returning to it&#39;s normal state. During your frenzy the other elves started eating. Noticing you were now a more orcish guy in a relatively small elven dress with your face covered in lipids and gravy you excused yourself. You brought yourself to the restroom to wash off your face and change into your pajamas. As you entered your room again you opened your trousers and smirked saying &quot;Well buddy, your back.&quot; patting it you said &quot;Well maybe i&#39;ll find a girl for you to be useful with sooner or later.&quot; then took a snooze.</p>
