<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Time paused again.<br />
<br />
“So, little one,” Finn said, directing his attention to the slowly transforming man bobbing on his cock. “What should Charlie do?”<br />
<br />
Erwin pulled off the cock and turned eyes that were growing slitted and reptilian up at his master.  No… he didn’t know why he kept thinking like that when all he was looking at was the dragon.<br />
<br />
“Erwin… err, I think…” Erwin’s voice was higher pitched and yappy. “he maybe should stay still?”<br />
<br />
Finn cocked a brow, an odd expression for a powerful dragon, “Have you been paying attention?”<br />
<br />
“Erwin… I,” Erwin clarified, brow knitting as he wondered why he was having such difficulty talking normally, like English was his second language. “Erwin think your cock is very needful.”<br />
<br />
Finn chuckled and pressed the kobold into a hug. “My goodness, you little ones are so eager!”<br />
<br />
Erwin squirmed, happiness blooming in his heart. Master Finn was proud of him! The man looked up, wondering why the dragon seemed taller than he had a minute ago. Was he growing larger?<br />
<br />
“Let’s see how this plays out, then.” Finn reached out a claw and the scene resumed playing.<br />
<br />
Erwin sniffed, his nostrils beginning to pull forwards into a snout, and dove back onto that luscious cock.<br />
<br />
Finn chuckled and shook his head, then directed his attention back to the screen. This should be fun. Not for Charlie, of course.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Charlie waited silently, flattening himself to the wall as the beam swept closer and closer to his hiding place.<br />
<br />
He was in a gap between the pitbull statues, deep in the shadows. There was no way the robot would pick him up in the sweep. All he had to do was hold his breath and slow his heart rate. A master assassin like him could do that easy as pie.<br />
<br />
Red light gently played over his body. It was warm and tingled pleasantly as it bathed him in a ruby glow. There was a soft hum, and the tingles intensified. Charlie tried to stay still, but his cock grew hard inside his leather pants. <br />
<br />
The warmth grew and Charlie began to pant, his body sweating profusely. His clothes clung to his body and soon began to feel tighter. He started to panic, but the warmth soothed away his fears, sending pleasant waves of calm into his tingly brain. <br />
<br />
A soft whine escaped his lips, his cock twitching and tingling, his body sweaty and hot.<br />
<br />
His arms and legs and chest bulged against his clothes as the tingles and humming increased. Charlie’s muscles expanded and contracted pleasantly, expanding with every pulse of that warm, pleasant light. Fabric tore as his musculature expanded. His biceps burst through his sleeves, throbbing veins visible on his over-muscled arms. The buckles on the wolf’s leather armor popped off, his shirt splitting open as a pair of rippling, glistening pecs jiggled out. Thick veins spread across Charlie’s torso, pulsing as his abs expanded, the rippling cords of muscle bulging into an inhuman twenty-four pack.<br />
<br />
“Guh-Ungh!” Charlie grunted deeply.<br />
<br />
He was so confused, his body felt amazing even though he was under the golem’s ray attack. His balls tingled and Charlie’s red rocket began to throb and expand. Charlie’s shirt tore apart and fell to the dusty floor of the ruins as his back exploded in a wave of sweat and muscle. The sweat ran down his spine as it popped, vertigo making him wobble as he grew taller. His back continued to expand, forcing his shoulders to spread wider, heavy muscle tone and definition clear beneath his thick fur.<br />
<br />
The ray moved lower and his leather pants split apart. His calves and thighs throbbed and swelled and his testicles fell out, swaying heavily. Charlie’s cock flopped out as well before springing to full erection under the gently, tingling light. His legs trembled and shook as orgasmic waves of warmth ran up them, making them swell and burst with powerful muscles, corded and toned. They elongated, adding a few more inches to Charlie’s growing frame.<br />
<br />
Charlie whined and yipped in pleasure, unable to contain his joy. Soon, he grew tall enough to be at eye level with the statues posed along the sides of the corridor. The warmth increased in his face as it popped and shifted. His forehead and brow snapped and cracked, jutting forward, muzzle growing shorter and boxy. If he had a mirror, Charlie would have realized his handsome mug was almost an exact copy of the pitbull statues next to him.<br />
<br />
His thick dark fur grew shorter, hair growing close-cropped. It made his massive, vascular muscles stand out even more. Hands and feet grew larger, toes flexing and spreading as his paws widened. Charlie bore his sharp teeth, breath coming out in hot huffs as his cock and balls swelled ever larger.<br />
<br />
He barked and yelped, the pleasure too much, his thin tail wagging back and forth, slapping the backs of his own calves.<br />
<br />
Charlie finally moved, unable to stand still any longer, and stroked his diamond-hard doggy meat. His paw was a blur on his fat pole, eyes half-lidded and back arched, his tail raised. He could feel his orgasm rushing closer and closer.<br />
<br />
The hum increased.<br />
<br />
Charlie felt an urge grow deep inside his chest. It rose as his orgasm did. He tried to relax his stance, shift his paws into a new position. But he was stuck. The massive pitbull - which was what he clearly was now – glanced down at his legs just in time to watch his feet change colors, from the dark black of his fur to the same white marble as the statues.<br />
<br />
His heart started to race, realizing what was happening, what the robot had in store for him, but he couldn’t take his hand from his cock with his orgasm so close. He needed to get off! With a whine, Charlie could only watch as the transformation from flesh to stone continued up his legs. He could feel the wave of change now. First, the tingling warmth grew more intense, then he felt stiff, and then all he could feel was the cold numbness of stone.<br />
<br />
But despite knowing the fate that awaited him, of the horror of being trapped in stone for what could easily be an eternity, all Charlie could think about was that so he was close. He could feel it, he was going to cum!<br />
<br />
Charlie let out a long howl as a rush of euphoria and dopamine battered his brain. He came hard just as the wave of stone reached his groin. The cum turned to stone just as it left the tip of his marble cock. Waves of orgasmic pleasure continued to radiate from his groin, the pleasure washing through him as the marble flowed up his chest, Charlie’s breathing slowing, then stopping as his torso solidified into stone.<br />
<br />
He was still howling as the marble flowed over his neck and mouth, freezing them in a permanent expression of pure ecstasy. <br />
<br />
As his form solidified into solid marble, Charlie found he could still think, his mind still trapped in the middle of a mind-shattering orgasm. The red light still hadn’t left him, waves of arousal rippling though his stiff, heavy stone body.<br />
<br />
Charlie was terrified but was having trouble thinking of why with the lingering orgasm sending shivers of euphoria throughout his frozen body. His arms and legs started to ache from maintaining the pose to too long. He knew that, logically, they were stone, so he shouldn’t feel them-shouldn’t feel anything, really. <br />
<br />
He tried to move, even just a finger, but his stone body wouldn’t budge an inch.<br />
<br />
The red light focused fully on him, the hum building up to full power. Charlie wanted to do something, anything, but all he could feel was wave after wave of pleasure and the strange ache of limbs he longer had. He tried to think of a way out, or to warn his friends, but he-unnnf! <br />
<br />
Charlie tried to concentrate, but the constant gush of pleasure and gentle, warm tingles made every sentence a struggle. He shouldn’t be so aroused, but f-fuck! He…a-aah! Couldn’t concentrate on anything b-but the pleasure.  The pitbull didn’t know what the purpose of the light was, he was already a statue so wha-Nnnf!<br />
<br />
His mind was blanked as a wave of pure orgasmic euphoria rushed through him, like he was experiencing the orgasm all over again. The aches in his limbs had finally faded, he realized, before another orgasm scattering his thoughts. It felt like his body was numb again, even the warm tingling fading and being replaced with blissful nothingness.<br />
<br />
As the warm light pulsed, the time between his thoughts increased. The waves of orgasmic energy became a constant stream. Charlie’s thoughts began to slow, words harder and harder to form. All he could think of was the perfect bliss.<br />
<br />
He-gah!<br />
<br />
Needed to-Ugh!<br />
<br />
Needed to…nnf!<br />
<br />
The statue tried to recall what it was thinking as the hum and pleasure filled its mind. There was nothing-no past, no friends, no memories, no name. Nothing but pure pleasure. The hum and red light slowed and then stopped, leaving the statue in the shadows once more. As the red light faded, the statue&#39;s thoughts followed the fleeting warmth and pleasure into nothingness.<br />
<br />
Charlie was just a statue, and statues didn’t think.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==-==-=-==--<br />
<br />
With a pop of displaced air, the lewd pitbull statue appeared in front of the table in Finn’s lair.<br />
<br />
“That was really dumb, Charlie,” Finn said over the slurps of the soon-to-be-kobold on his cock. “Who the hell thinks they can evade a scanner by hiding in the darkness?”<br />
<br />
Charlie, of course, said nothing.<br />
<br />
“Aw, well, I guess it’s not really your fault,” Finn sighed.<br />
<br />
Looking over the statue, he couldn’t help but notice that it didn’t really go with his lair’s current décor.<br />
<br />
“Sorry Charlie,” Finn said, “I’d like to keep you around, for old times sake, but I don’t want to scare my new players off.”<br />
<br />
Finn gave the statue one last look over, “and besides, you don’t look like you’re particularly valuable.”<br />
<br />
The dragon contemplated what to do with the statue, idly stroking the top of Erwin’s scaly head. Just sending him whereever wouldn’t be fun. An idea came to him in a flash. Of course! He planned on editing these adventures into a show and streaming it on Viewtube later, why not plant an ‘Easter Egg’ for viewers to find later?<br />
<br />
He twirled his hands around the crystal ball, the scene shifting to show a far away ruin in Paranor. There was a hedgemaze there with all manner of statues. The pitbull WOULD stand out, of course, as it hadn’t been sculpted by the same forces that made the others.<br />
<br />
If Charlie were lucky, the party might actually connect the dots and use Stone to Flesh on him.<br />
<br />
Oh, this was going to be so fun! Especially when the newly revived pitbull claimed to be Charlie. The drama that would create! But, of course, that all depended on if they managed to figure out that the statue was strangely out of place and THEN decided to revive it.<br />
<br />
The dragon snapped his fingers and the statue disappeared.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
Deep inside of the statue, Charlie’s mind peered out of stone eyes.  He could hear Finn talking to him, but it seemed so distant, and the words were so fast.  Finn was saying something about moving him somewhere else.  <br />
<br />
He didn’t want to go wherever that was, he didn’t want to be a statue.  He thought back to how Finn had promised to remake him if he died, couldn’t Finn just do that?  It wasn’t fair to doom him to this for a single mistake.<br />
<br />
But by the time Charlie managed to think up the words to say, he realized that he was standing in dirt, staring across a small stone path at a line of green hedgerows.  <br />
<br />
Oh no!  Finn had already teleported him somewhere else.  His thoughts were going so slow that by the time he realized was what going on, it had already happened.  He tried to look around, but his body wouldn’t respond – his gaze just remained fixed on that stone path and the bright green hedgerow in front of him.<br />
<br />
Charlie couldn’t move his body, hell he could barely even feel it.  Every sensation was so dull, and the sounds picked up by his ears were so muted.  So much so, in fact, that he hadn’t noticed just how deathly silent it was.  <br />
<br />
He briefly wondered whether he’d been sent back to Finn’s DnD world – if he’d been teleported into a minotaur’s maze, it would make sense for silence like this to precede the monster.  Not that it would pose any threat to him or he to it given his current state.  But then he noticed something else – the pathway that he was standing next to was pitch black.  It was night.  <br />
<br />
Just seconds ago, the sun had been shining straight down on top of him, but now it was nowhere to be seen.  Was this magic or?<br />
<br />
Charlie’s thoughts drifted for a moment, only for him to notice it was day again.  And then he realized what was going on.  This wasn’t magic, or at least, magic had nothing to do with the sped up day/night cycle.  What was causing that was this body – the cold, inert stone that now made up his brain wasn’t processing time the same way that his old organic body had.  Everything he perceived now was muted and distant, including time.<br />
<br />
It wasn’t that time was passing any different than it ever had, he was just perceiving it so much slower.  He tried to gather his thoughts, he tried to think faster.  But day kept bleeding into night before he could fully process just what time it was.  <br />
<br />
-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-<br />
<br />
The statue taken care of, Finn the dragon looked down at Erwin. <br />
<br />
Scales had spread across the human’s head and down over his proto-snout. In a few more minutes, he’d be looking like a proper kobold. Erwin hadn’t even been paying attention to Charlie’s transformation, all his focus was on the dragon’s cock.<br />
<br />
How could Finn possibly stay mad at someone with such diligence?<br />
<br />
“Did you do that on purpose?” The dragon chuckled. “Try throwing a rock next time. Otherwise, this is…”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE END<br />
<br />
(Go back and pick the other option, silly kobold-err, human!)</p>
