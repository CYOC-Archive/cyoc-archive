<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jace felt a bit awkward about trying to ask Simon to help him again, and while he did like the strength he felt as Jace, he didn&#39;t want to live this life. <br />
<br />
Jace began walking in a random direction, his gut telling him he was going the right way. Not long after, he saw the frat house in the distance. He tried to read the name of the frat, but the squiggly letters still proved too much for him, even after the tutoring session. He couldn&#39;t wait to change that. He opened the door and was immediately greeted by the scent of beer, old pizza, and sweat. To Jace it felt like home, but something inside him told him that it wasn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
“Yo Jace! Catch!” A football was thrown at his head. Jace just stared vacantly as the ball hit him in the head and bounced off harmlessly. There were some advantages to having a thick skull apparently. <br />
<br />
Jace looked at the jock who’d thrown the ball and recognized him as Will. He was sitting on the couch next to Billy and Kyle, who were intently watching a game on the tv, surrounded by empty beer bottles.<br />
<br />
“Huh, hey bros.” Jace said. Will, Billy, and Kyle looked over and laughed.<br />
“Dude, you totally just ate that pass. You good?” Will said, clearly trying not to crack up.<br />
Jace rubbed his forehead, but there wasn’t much pain. “Yeah, yeah. I’m chill. Just… my brain’s been feelin’ kinda slow lately.”<br />
“Bro,” Billy said, tossing a crumpled pizza box off his lap, “your brain’s always been slow.”<br />
“Yeah, but like…” Jace trailed off. He wasn’t even sure what he was trying to say. Something about tutoring? Or changing back? It felt important earlier, but now, standing in the familiar frat stank with the game on and bros around him, it all felt fuzzy. “I think I needed to do something urgently.”<br />
Kyle looked at him. “Bro, you can trust us, we&#39;ve been taking care of your schedule forever ever since coached asked us too after you missed practice again to jerk off.” Kyle laughed boisterously and Will clapped him on the back, doubling over in laughter. <br />
“Speaking of which, how did your ‘tutoring session’ with Simon go?” Will laughed, as if there was some joke he was making, but Jace didn&#39;t pick up on it. <br />
“Y&#39;know. Just looked at some squiggly letters then shoved Simon into my crotch.”<br />
Will lost it, nearly falling off the couch laughing. “Bro! You legend!” Billy barked out a laugh too, choking a bit on the beer he’d just taken a swig of. “You really went full caveman on that poor nerd, huh?” <br />
They were loving it. Jace grinned back sheepishly, but somewhere in the haze of ego-boosting bro-energy, a small voice in the back of his mind whispered: ‘That’s not me. That’s not who I was.’<br />
He rubbed the back of his neck, frowning slightly. “Uh… hey bros?” he said, suddenly having a brief moment of clarity. “Can you, uh, help me pick somethin’?”<br />
Will raised an eyebrow. “Pick what? Pizza toppings? A new protein powder?”<br />
Jace held up his phone. “Nah, like… a job. On this TaskRaccoon thingy. It’s like a gig app or somethin’. I think I need to do another job soon.”<br />
Billy leaned forward, squinting at the screen. “A gig app? Why are you hustling, bro? You got that full ride scholarship, remember?”<br />
“Yeah,” Jace mumbled, “I dunno. Just feels like… I gotta. Like it’s important. For my brain or somethin’. Or maybe money. Or…” he trailed off, confused again.<br />
Kyle shrugged. “Whatever, man. Let’s see what you got. Your bros are here to help” He grabbed the phone from Jace and swiped through the available jobs, cackling immediately. “Yo, some of these are gold.”<br />
Will leaned over. “Dude, pick something stupid. Like, humiliating. Let’s mess with him. He won’t even remember it tomorrow probably.”<br />
“Ooh how about that one! Jace might even like it!” Billy pointed at one of the tasks. “It&#39;s even at this campus!”<br />
That was good right? He remembered something about needing to be at campus to reach his goal. Whatever that was.<br />
Kyle locked in the job and handed his phone back to Jace. “Here ya go bro! Have fun!” He looked on in anticipation too see what Jace thought of it. After a couple moments of Jace staring vacantly at his phone, Will took it and started reading it aloud for him.<br />
“I need someone to be the mascot for tonight&#39;s football game!” Will read. “Location is at the school gym. And you should hurry dude, this app has like a countdown.” Billy clapped Jace on the back. “Right up your alley bro! We’ll be there as well to cheer you on. Now off you go!” Billy gave him a slap on the ass while Kyle opened the door for him. <br />
Suddenly he was outside, with a new task, and a new identity ahead of him. Looking at his phone, he saw the numbers counting down. That was bad right? He started running, the school gym was a familiar place for Jace and as he arrived not even five minutes later, he was barely winded. He looked down at himself and saw that the still looked the same. He should be transformed by now right? Deciding not to think too hard he pushed open the door and headed inside.<br />
Then he heard shouting coming from somewhere down the hall, along with bonking on the door. “Hello?! Hello? Is someone out there? Please—help!”<br />
Jace squinted down the hallway. The voice was muffled, like someone yelling through a pillow. He followed the noise, footsteps echoing on the waxy floor, until he reached a storage closet with a beat-up sign. The banging was louder now, like someone was headbutting the door in desperation.<br />
He turned the knob. Locked. He knocked once and the yelling stopped.<br />
“Oh thank god. Dude. Bro. You gotta help me—I’m stuck. The damn zipper snagged or something. I’ve been in here for like, forty-five minutes.”<br />
Jace hesitated. “Uh… what?”<br />
“I’m the freakin’ Jackrabbit, man! Or—well—I was. Open the door!”<br />
Jace blinked. Right. TaskRaccoon. Mascot gig. This had to be the guy who posted the job.<br />
He leaned his shoulder into the door and gave it a shove, just as the guy inside yanked again. With a loud thunk, the door swung open, nearly knocking Jace back. And there he was.<br />
A full-grown man—maybe late twenties, early thirties—wedged inside a Jackrabbit mascot suit that was several sizes too small. The oversized bunny head sat crooked on his shoulders, one floppy ear bent straight down over the eyehole. Sweat gleamed off his neck where the fur suit had bunched up and the zipper had half-exploded open like it had tried to give up mid-job.<br />
Jace just stared.<br />
“Help me out, man. Please. It’s like a sauna in here. I’m dying.”<br />
“Right,” Jace muttered, stepping forward and grabbing at the zipper. It was jammed just below the shoulder blades. He yanked. Nothing.<br />
“Try harder,” the guy said, voice panicked now. “I can’t miss my band’s gig tonight. We’re called Death Nap, because when you sleep you are closest to the sweet embrace of death.”<br />
“Cool,” Jace mumbled, adjusting his grip. “You gotta lean forward.”<br />
The guy bent at the waist like he was about to bow. Jace planted his foot against the wall for leverage and pulled. The zipper finally gave way and the the man staggered out, face bright red and hair matted. He peeled off the bunny head and took a huge, dramatic breath.<br />
“Oh god. Oh god. Thank you.”<br />
Jace stepped back, holding the now-deflated mascot suit. The man was only wearing some boxers and nothing else. He was in pretty good shape, with some nice, hairy pecs. Jace felt himself harden. Then the man turned to him. “Okay. Now you put it on.”<br />
Jace, knocked out of his daydream, blinked. “What?”<br />
“It’s your gig now, right? TaskRaccoon said someone’d show. That someone’s you, right? Jace? I’m Evan by the way.”<br />
He shoved the floppy suit into Jace’s arms. The fur was damp. The headpiece reeked of old popcorn and BO. Evan grinned, grabbing a Gatorade from a nearby crate and chugging it like he’d just run a triathlon.<br />
“I warmed it up for you,” he said, between gulps.<br />
Jace looked at the suit. Then at the man. Then at the open gym door behind him, where he could see some cheerleaders warming up.<br />
He sighed. Of course this was happening.<br />
“So here’s the thing. I accidentally planned my band gig at the same time as the football rally, and a drummer is harder to replace than a mascot. So thanks for showing up on such short notice.” He pointed to the cheerleaders. “Beth can show you my routine. It’s not too difficult, just some dances and being funny.”<br />
Evan started pulling on his clothes and continued. “My advice, just be a silly jackrabbit. You’re in a costume man, no one will recognize you. And also, get someone to help you pull off the costume when you’re done. You don&#39;t want to be stuck like I was.” Evan laughed.<br />
Jace squinted at the misshapen lump of matted fur and oversized foam feet in his arms like it was a live animal. The mascot head lolled sideways in his grasp, glassy plastic eyes staring back at him with the haunted gaze of someone who’d seen too much.<br />
“You’ll be fine,” Evan added, tugging on a wrinkled Death Nap t-shirt, hiding his magneficent pecs from view. “Just channel chaos energy. That’s what the Jackrabbit’s all about.”<br />
Jace didn’t answer. Started taking off his clothes, first his stringer, then his shoes and socks, and finally his sweatpants till he stood there in just a jockstrap.<br />
Evan whistled. “Man, you’re really gonna fill the suit out well with all that muscle. You know, I’m kinda in a hurry right now, thanks to that god awful zipper, but would you wanna get together sometime for some fun? If you’re up for it of course.”<br />
“I’d love that man!” His jockstrap was already tenting from his boner. Evan gazed down at it and sighed. “Such a shame I’m in a hurry. Well. Let’s get you in the suit.”<br />
Jace sat down on a bench and started sliding one leg into the massive, spongy pants. The inside was lined with some kind of cheap nylon, soaked through in patches and clinging in all the wrong places. His foot jammed halfway in, catching on a clump of twisted faux fur.<br />
Evan winced. “Yeah, sorry about that. It’s uh—yeah. Let me help you.”<br />
He dropped his Gatorade and knelt to help, yanking the pant leg down while Jace hopped like a malfunctioning flamingo. Once both feet were through, Evan stood and gave the waistband a tug, securing it just above Jace’s hips. <br />
Next came the torso piece—thick, zippered down the back, with fake muscle padding that made Jace look like a jacked-up Bugs Bunny. He wriggled his arms through the sleeves as Evan guided them carefully, like a nurse helping someone into a straightjacket.<br />
“This part’s tricky,” Evan said, stepping behind him. “Gotta line up the zipper just right or it’ll catch on the lining. You do not want to tear this—Coach Stevens will absolutely strangle you.”<br />
He zipped Jace up slowly, carefully guiding the fabric. Jace could feel the dampness soaking into his skin, cold at first, then warming with his own body heat.<br />
“Alright,” Evan said, stepping around to inspect. “You’re almost there. Time for the head.”<br />
He picked up the massive Jackrabbit head and held it like it was a crown.<br />
“Behold,” Evan said, mock solemn. “The symbol of school spirit, questionable hygiene, and zero personal dignity.”<br />
Jace took a deep breath. The air already smelled like old gym socks. He ducked his head, and Evan slid it down over him.<br />
Instantly, the world went muffled and sweaty. His vision was cut down to a narrow mesh window behind the Jackrabbit’s dumb cartoon grin. The fake teeth were inches from his own mouth. Everything wobbled when he moved.<br />
“Can you hear me?” Evan’s voice was faint and muffled, but Jace gave a thumbs-up. The suit&#39;s big floppy hands made it look cartoonish.<br />
Evan clapped him on the back. “You look ridiculous. It’s perfect.”<br />
Jace tried walking. His legs moved in exaggerated steps, the feet thudding with every awkward bounce. The short tail bobbed behind him like a weird appendage.<br />
“Alright, go find Beth,” Evan said, backing away. “She’ll run you through the moves. And hey—have fun. You’re a rabbit. Do rabbit shit.”<br />
He took him in. “Well would you look at that. You fill out that suit so well! It looks really lifelike!<br />
Jace turned his head stiffly toward Evan, the oversized rabbit ears flopping a beat behind his motion. Something about the way Evan said it—“You fill out that suit so well”—stuck with him. Not because it was funny. But because… it felt true. Uncomfortably true.<br />
He shifted his weight, and the suit shifted with him. Not just fabric moving over skin, but something deeper. The plush muscles didn’t sag anymore. They felt firm. Responsive. Like they were… his.<br />
His arms didn’t feel like his arms. They were heavier, sure, but somehow balanced. His hands—big, padded, fur-covered—curled into fists, then relaxed. The fur didn’t just touch his skin. It felt part of his skin. Seamless.<br />
A weird pressure built behind his eyes.<br />
“Whew,” Evan muttered, slinging his bag over his shoulder. “Almost feel bad leaving you in that thing. But you’re killin’ it already. Good luck out there, Jack-Rabbit.”<br />
He jogged off without looking back.<br />
Jack stood frozen, listening to the hum of the gym lights and the dull thud-thud of a basketball somewhere in the distance. He took another step. The sound his feet made wasn’t foam hitting tile—it was paws. Springy. Soft, but grounded. He looked down. The mesh eyehole narrowed his vision, but what he saw didn’t look like a costume foot anymore. It looked like an actual rabbit foot. Fur, claw, padding. He blinked. Or thought he blinked. It was hard to tell.<br />
He stumbled forward, off balance, his limbs moving in ways they shouldn’t. Every joint felt looser, more elastic. His calves burned with spring-loaded tension, like they were built to bounce, not walk. His arms swayed longer than they used to. He tried to clench his fists, and felt thick padded fingers curl in—not gloves, but paws.<br />
He caught his reflection in a dusty window. His stomach dropped.<br />
That wasn’t him in the glass.<br />
A jackrabbit stared back. Seven feet tall, hunched in a casual slouch, long ears tilted back with attitude. Its chest was broad, rising with steady breath. Its legs were corded with cartoonish muscle, built for speed.<br />
Then the pressure behind his face cracked—pop—and something slid into place.<br />
He blinked.<br />
Not from within the suit. But through its eyes.<br />
His pupils adjusted on their own. His ears twitched and turned toward distant sounds. He tried to open his mouth and felt buck teeth shift. A long, unfamiliar tongue pressed against them. Too wide. Too soft. He ran it over the inside of his cheeks and tasted not cheap foam, but the inside of his mouth.<br />
He wasn’t wearing a suit anymore. He was the suit.<br />
He flexed a paw, and the claws moved smoothly. No drag. No costume weight. Just control.<br />
This was seriously freaky. Cursing TaskRaccoon for putting him in this situation, he grabbed his phone from the bench. Thank god he didn&#39;t put this suit on with his clothes on and his phone in his pocket. He didn&#39;t think he&#39;d ever be able to turn back if that was the case. Navigating through the phone menus with some difficulty thanks to his larger paws, he had paws now instead of hands, he looked over the task again, looking for some explanation. But nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But when he looked at his profile he was a little shocked. It now read as ‘Jack Rabbit’. His new identity. <br />
Jack tried not to panic. He’d been in similar situations before. But this was definitely the most extreme transformation so far. He’d somehow fused with the suit, and was now an anthropomorphic jackrabbit. <br />
Jack looked around for some clothes, now realizing that he was technically naked. But with that thought came another realization. He quickly grabbed his crotch, and his eyes widened. “Where the fuck are my dick and balls?” He felt around some more, maybe he missed them? But no, he couldn&#39;t find them. The suit didn&#39;t have genitals, and now, neither did he. “What the fuck!” <br />
He tried to pull on his jockstrap, but his bulky thighs were too big, even for the loose elastic. He tried his stringer, but wasn&#39;t even able to fit his head through it, and even if he was somehow able to, he wasn&#39;t sure it&#39;d even fit on his torso. Although he proportionally was less muscled than he was as Jace, with this body being built more for speed, this body was still 7 feet tall and thus even bigger. <br />
Giving up on putting on his clothes, he sat back down on the bench, it creaked heavily as he did so. He held his head in his paws. This was so bizarre. He was some sort of furry artist’s wet dream, his cock and balls were nowhere to be found, and his clothing didn&#39;t fit. Though, he supposed that the mascot normally didn&#39;t wear clothes, so maybe he would be fine if he also didn&#39;t? He really needed to go to the cheerleading practice, and he saw no other option than to go like he was now. If he was right about TaskRaccoon’s reality warping function, they wouldn&#39;t find it strange, right? And by the way, why was our school’s mascot so… sexy? Even before he merged with it, the costume had very defined abs and pecs, and a round butt, along with a cute fluffy tail. How did that even get approved? Now that he was the costume, it seemed even more so now. Now that the muscles were no longer made of foam, but actually were real. <br />
No time like the present. He needed to learn his routine for the game tonight. Jack bounded off the bench with a mix of trepidation and determination, his oversized bunny paws padding awkwardly across the cool pavement toward the school gym. Every step was a reminder of the surreal transformation he’d undergone—now a towering, anthropomorphic jackrabbit with rippling muscles. The gym’s entrance was ahead, echoing with the rhythmic stomps and cheers of the cheerleading practice.<br />
Inside, the energy was palpable. The air vibrated with upbeat music and synchronized claps. Amid the whirl of pom-poms and dynamic routines, Jack spotted who he assumed was Beth,  as she led the team through warm-ups and complex maneuvers. Then she saw him, it wasn&#39;t easy to miss a 7 feet tall anthro, but he half expected her to freak out when she saw him.<br />
“Hey, Jack.” she greeted, her tone completely unfazed by his unusual appearance. “Thanks for coming. We still need to work on your routine some more before tonight. You ready?”<br />
Jack was thankful she didn&#39;t freak out. The other cheerleaders also saw him, and some waved, but there was no one who noticed how weird it was that their mascot had come to life. <br />
Beth led him to a quieter corner of the gym where the boisterous practice was still visible in the background. The natural glow of the afternoon sun filtered through the windows, casting elongated shadows and bathing the room in a golden hue.<br />
“Alright, for the first part of your routine, just copy ours. After we finish, it&#39;s your time to shine with a solo moment. I&#39;ll help you with the team-routine, then you can come up with your own for the solo. Sounds good?” Beth didn&#39;t wait for an answer and started the song. “Just follow me.”<br />
Beth demonstrated the routine with meticulous precision—a series of fluid motions that combined athletic leaps with graceful twirls. “Place your paws like this,” she instructed, guiding his large hand-like appendage into the correct position. “Shift your weight like this… feel the rhythm of your body.”<br />
Jack attempted to mirror her movements. His long, powerful legs propelled him into impressive yet clumsy leaps, each step a battle against his newfound imbalance. His bulky thighs and unfamiliar center of gravity turned even the simplest motion into a challenge. Beth’s frustration was evident as she snapped, “What’s going on with you today? You normally move so naturally! Again!”<br />
A shiver coursed through Jack’s altered form, from his paws down to the tip of his long ears. He suddenly felt more… connected to his body in some sense. His body no longer felt alien. Instead, there was an emerging familiarity, a strange sense of belonging in his towering, anthropomorphic frame.<br />
Determined to prove himself, Jack slowed his breathing and refocused. The initial clumsiness began to yield to tentative grace. As the beat pulsed through the gym, his movements grew more assured, syncing with the rhythm that Beth had so effortlessly embodied. With each leap, his giant paws became less cumbersome, his steps more deliberate, until he was doing the routine damn near perfectly on his own. He even added some flourishes that livened up the performance. <br />
“Okay, that&#39;s all the time I have today. I gotta say, you really killed it after that shaky start! I’ll leave you to work on your solo, in the meantime, I got to go shopping! Will and me are going out after the game.” She dramatically swooned. “Anyway… see ya tonight for the show!” <br />
As if some invisible signal had been given, all the other cheerleaders started packing up too. Leaving him alone in the gym. He didn&#39;t feel particularly tired, even after all that jumping around. It must be his new rabbit stamina. He did feel a bit sweaty, although even that felt different somehow. He also still stank of old popcorn and BO. As he headed for the showers, he thought to himself that this was probably the first time in a long while that the suit was getting washed. Wryly, he realised that it was also easier to do all those jumps without his junk flopping about.</p>
