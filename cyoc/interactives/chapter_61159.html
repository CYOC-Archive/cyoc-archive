<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Lucky Strength, why would it be called Lucky Strength? Oh, lucky! Strength! Strong luck! That makes sense.&quot; Rowan said to himself, stroking his chin almost as if his deduction was ingenious. &quot;It must be some funny Chinese to English problem type of thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan had a goofy grin upon his face as he began to dress himself. He felt as if his entire life was about to turn around just by rubbing on some nice smelling ointment. Well, he was partly right, though his luck wouldn't be changing as he expected it would. However, it would be changing... For better or worse, who knows? He put on his best (still old) attire, consisting of sandals, basket ball shorts, and a tank top. Yep. Dressed for success. He would've wore his suit, but that went to some lucky guy who won the entire pot at a poker game. Sadly, Rowan wouldn't get to learn his lesson about gambling like he should've.<br />
<br />
&quot;Money, here I come, luck is on my-&quot; Rowan stopped while he turned his attention to his wily hair. He noticed his hair was growing shorter, and rather fast too. &quot;W-what?! MY HAIR! T-this isn't lucky at all!&quot; <br />
<br />
Rowan began panicking, watching as he was going bald right before his eyes; his entire body was, actually. He also noticed his arm hair and leg hair shrink until it vanished, revealing his smooth and lightly tanned skin. Rowan quickly lifted his arm to see his underarm hair was completely gone too. The hair on his head didn't shrink away into nothingness like his body hair, though, it just shrank until it was short. His eyebrows were left intact, but now his hair was as long as his stubble. Rowan, the pretty boy, wasn't exactly happy about this insane change. He tore off all his clothes, finding that his body was very similar to Ken's: the doll... But he was still &quot;anatomically correct&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... Can't... My hair...&quot; Rowan stared at himself, a wide eyed, worried version of himself staring back at him. His perfectly arranged body hair was one of his attractive points (and there were still quite a few points left), and the wily hair on his head was reduced to nothing but stubble. &quot;Don't worry Rowan, you still look good, you still look fine. You caWHAT NOW?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rowan was now blathering nonsense as he ran his hands over strange lines snaking their way from his neck and groin area. Also known as veins, some thick as a sharpie marker, some thin as a lose thread; visible, but still quite a way from being near the surface of his skin. While the veins were snaking their way around his entire body, more in number around the arms and legs, his testicles began growing in size. From grapes, to lemons - more than doubled in size. The new weight causing them to drop down a tiny bit, just enough to fit more than comfortably between his legs without getting squeeze. Rowan was absolutely speechless, he thought he looked like a freak with all the veins and disproportionate ratio of testicle size-to-penis size (which was still just 3.5&quot; flaccid). Just as he was about to cry out in despair, he felt a powerful surge rush from his new set o' lemons. The new veins, and heck, every little blood vessel in his body began pulsating - spreading a mix of testosterone and other growth hormones throughout his entire body.<br />
<br />
Rowan stared in awe, not completely understand what was happening now. His body began joining in the pulsating, his muscles beating with his heart's beat. The only thing is, his muscles weren't going back down after beating. Instead, they kept on growing larger, and larger, pushing the new veins to the surface slowly but surely as they pulsated. Rowan braced himself against the sink as he let out a feral yell, the strange cocktail in his veins driving his body and mind to the brink. He looked down only to see two large slabs, his pecs, blocking his view of his rapidly changing body. He backed up to examine his body, not knowing what to expect. Rowan thought he was dreaming, watching his &quot;beautiful body&quot; change into something that was a freak of nature and then some. He was so outraged that he could've knocked down the house. He didn't enjoy being &quot;a freak of nature&quot;, not by one bit.<br />
<br />
Rowan's shoulders and muscles around them formed a hill of sorts, in which his bolder, more dashingly intense face sat upon. His pecs were enormous peaks, squeeze together with very little room in between, blocking his line of sight from the rest of his body. His arms, now peaks of strength, doubling in size whenever they were flexed - accompanied with bigger hands to help accommodate the load his arms could now hold up. Rowan's abs resembled eight powerful plateaus, each equally sized and raised off his stomach. All of which tapered to give his torso a slight V shape. Below the amazing &quot;V&quot;, vines were snaking their way up massive tree trunks that he would now call his legs. With their roots, being his feet, now large enough to hold up the new shrubbery of muscle that it helped support. Despite all the growth, his penis was still the same size, but he figured 3&quot; flaccid and 6&quot; erect was okay enough - if not too small for his new freakish body. He had bigger things to worry about than his penis size, though.<br />
<br />
Rowan slowly examined everything over and over, rubbing his hands over his unbelievably powerful body. He initially thought he was a freak of nature, but with his body's change came a change to his mind. He now had memories of being admired, flexing in front of hundreds, his confidence always at 200%, no part of him was a loser, fortune always on his side; he was a bodybuilder who lurked in the shallow ponds, waiting to jump onto covers of magazines. Rowan was still the same as before, just over-confident and not as modest as he once was. As such, the first thing that sprang to his mind was how to make money. As far as he was concerned, he has always been like this and his clothes were just freakishly small. Luckily he found some old clothes bought from a thrift store a long time ago, they snugly fitted his body, despite the clothes belonging to a man who was too large to move (never worn, which Rowan appreciated very much). Rowan decided he would...</p>
