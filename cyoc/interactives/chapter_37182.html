<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Pete stood in Sally's apartment for several minutes after Sally had left. He looked at the bottle of ointment and was curious as to what would happen if he rubbed it on his feet.<br />
<br />
Sally had made a handsome kangaroo, that was for sure.<br />
<br />
Pete gulped at that thought. Was he attracted to Sally's kangaroo form? It was male and Pete didn't like the idea of being attracted to another male. Yet, he couldn't deny the feeling.<br />
<br />
The ointment contained within the bottle almost seemed to be calling to Pete. He had a desire to massage it into his feet. It was irrational yet Pete couldn't deny it was there.<br />
<br />
Looking around to make sure no one was looking, Pete sat down and removed his shoes and socks.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh what the hell,&quot; Pete said.<br />
<br />
He stripped, tossing his clothes onto the bed.<br />
<br />
He looked at his feet for a few moments.<br />
<br />
Pete knew that what he was considering was foolish and wrong on several different levels. He realized that he desired Sally to have company if she was stuck as a kangaroo person. It overrode his better judgment.<br />
<br />
He poured some of the ointment from the bottle onto his feet and started to massage it onto them.<br />
<br />
At first, nothing happened. Pete was almost disappointed.<br />
<br />
Then, it started.<br />
<br />
Pete watched with shock, embarrassment and a hint of excitement as his feet started growing.<br />
<br />
The middle three toes on each foot merged into one large toe as his pinkie and big toes changed shape and size until they were the same length.<br />
<br />
What were now his middle toes became thicker, taller and a little longer then their neighbors. Claws grew from all of his toes.<br />
<br />
Seeing and feeling this happening was incredible to Pete. Such things were supposed to be confined to the realm of fantasy. Yet, here it was, happening for real to and to -him-!<br />
<br />
Pete never considered himself special. Now, he felt almost chosen by the ointment. He wondered if it was somehow alive and encouraging him to change his body further. Pete knew he had to rub Sally's feet for her to become a kangaroo. He felt somewhat disappointed that no one was there to do the same for him.<br />
<br />
Something inside of him reassured him it didn't require the presence of another or an overnight application to work.<br />
<br />
He rubbed his feet and felt a warm sensation spread from them up his body. It was wonderful and had him laying back on the bed with a contented sigh.<br />
<br />
Then things really starting getting weird.<br />
<br />
Thought of hoping down a street under a warm sun flooded into Pete's mind. People ran out of his way. Some kids wanted to pat the 'cool looking' kangaroo but their parents refused. It was almost like listening to the radio, if said radio was playing thoughts into your mind rather then sound into your ears.<br />
<br />
Pete came to the only conclusion that made sense, he was hearing Sally's thoughts. It was no stranger then the notion of turning into a kangaroo person.<br />
<br />
Sally disliked how people would panic solely based on her appearance. It made her realize how judgmental people and, she's realized she could be. Perhaps, she wondered, she could learn from this and try to be nicer to people in the future. That assumed she wasn't stuck as a kangaroo and a male.<br />
<br />
Sally was of two minds about her new equipment. She wondered how guys dealt with it day in and day out. Female equipment was normal to Sally. The issues it caused were a normal part of her life, no less normal then having to use the bathroom. Sally wondered if having a penis was any different. The idea that it could become erect and announce her feelings to anyone that could see it seemed like a betrayal to her. Of course her hormones would make her feel differently when the time came.<br />
<br />
&quot;You get used to it,&quot; Pete said.<br />
<br />
Pete blinked. Those thoughts were Sally's, there was no doubt about that. However, they'd felt natural in his mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess it's the same for girls and that time of month,&quot; Pete said.<br />
<br />
From Sally's thoughts, Pete knew that, yes it was.<br />
<br />
The warmth on Pete's body was getting warmer and turning into an itching sensation. Or was it the heat of the sun on Sally's fur? It felt nice. She understood why cats liked to lay in the sun.<br />
<br />
He also knew that she was feeling what he was thinking. It distracted her enough that she almost ran into a man.<br />
<br />
Pete's legs felt different and there was something else there. He knew from Sally's mind what it was without having to look down. Looking down confirmed it. Pete had the legs and tail of a humanoid kangaroo! His fur was of a simular color to Sally's. From the waist down, Pete was a humanoid kangaroo. The idea should have terrified him yet, it didn't. He drew strength from Sally's experience as a kangaroo person. Even if it was limited, it still seemed enjoyable enough that Pete knew he didn't have to panic.<br />
<br />
When Pete looked between his legs and saw a pouch however, he felt different.<br />
<br />
Sally's joke about Pete becoming a girl was no longer a joke.<br />
<br />
As the fur marched up Pete's torso, he wanted to panic.<br />
<br />
Pete sensed embarrassment from Sally. At first he thought it was over the idea that he was turning into a female kangaroo. Then, he realized that the idea aroused her somewhat. She was feeling the same conflicting emotions Pete felt over finding Sally's male kangaroo form appealing. Pete realized what was happening when he sensed Sally was hoping toward a nearby wooded area for privacy. Her concerns over the male hood she now possessed were well founded.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sorry, I should have said no,&quot; Pete said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You didn't know this would happen,&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
They were kilometers apart but their connection was enough that they could still more or less have a conversation.<br />
<br />
Pete felt a weight on his chest. He gulped and held his hands over his nipples as pressure build from under them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, I think I'm getting...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You think that's bad, you should see this thing,&quot; Sally said. &quot;Man, it's weird looking. I think I can even...&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete gasped part from part panic and part pleasure. It was wrong on so many levels, yet it felt good. He ended up cupping his forming breasts and could only stare at them once they'd settled into place. They were of a perfect shape and size for his body. Big enough to notice but small enough to be dignified.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, are you okay?&quot; Pete asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm fine, what about you? Heck, why ask, I know you are,&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm a girl! Yet, I know it's okay if I have you here for me,&quot; Pete said. &quot;I know how to be a girl. Boy, this connection sure comes in handy.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the fur marched down Pete's arms and up to his head, he sensed what Sally was interested in. Her kangaroo male hood was, as odd as it seemed to both, prehensile. The fact, buried in Sally's memories from a text she'd read long ago surfaced. Knowing about it was one thing, experiencing it was another.<br />
<br />
Pete stood and looked in the mirror at a face that while more or less that of a kangaroo was still female. He had brown hair like Sally but his was longer and flowed over his shoulders. Looking back at his clothes, Pete watched as they flew toward him and reformed. Like with Sally, Pete's lower half way far too large to accommodate any sort of pants or skirts. Instead, Pete found himself clad in a white tee shirt with green cuffs, a hat similar to Sally's as well as what Pete assumed would be a furred creatures equivalent of tattoo on his left forearm in the form of a snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sally, I'm a girl!&quot; Pete said. &quot;I even sound like one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Duh, I can sense that,&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;This connection is freaky.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Sally said. &quot;So, now that you're a roo too, what do you suggest we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
Pete giggled and folded his arms. &quot;Three rhymes in once sentence, not bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks -- I think,&quot; Sally said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well first, I think we should...&quot;</p>
