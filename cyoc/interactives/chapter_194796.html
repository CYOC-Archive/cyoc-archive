<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff kept himself curled up on the wolf pelts, more to hide the fact he was trying to mess with the metal cuffs on his wrists, than from emotional distress. Where was the opening on these things? He couldn&#39;t find trace of hatch or hinge despite clearly remembering them being snapped over his wrists. He kept one eye on the entrance as he examined the weird metal. It felt like steel, but the markings were glowing softly. Elves. Orcs. Magic. This was getting to be too much. He was starting to feel numb. Amber. He shied away from that thought. He couldn&#39;t think of her right now. He would break down.<br />
<br />
The flaps to the tent parted and the orc that had paid for him strode in. He unhooked his axe belt and hung that on a wooden frame by the door. The leather pauldrons and chest piece following suit. This let his powerful body completely on display. His skin was the color of damp moss, a rich, deep green, curly black hair covering his massive pecs and thick stomach, his nipples sticking through the dark fur like a pair of emeralds on black cloth, glittering golden rings looping through them. He had other gold piercings, a few in his ears, one dangling from the center of his nose, and one even through a tusk.<br />
<br />
The orc plucked a fruit out of a bowl on the low table, something large and blue but shaped like a pear. He took a bite of it with a crunch, his tusks gouging the fruit and sending juice dribbling down his chin into his braided beard. &quot;You better not be moping over there.&quot; He said in his rough voice. He spoke English well though, or was it even English over here? Where in God&#39;s name was he?<br />
<br />
&quot;You hear me human?&quot; The orc stomped over and crouched by him, taking another bite of his fruit. &quot;You act like this and those chains will kill you.&quot; Closer.. closer.. The orc leaned in and Jeff kicked out, aiming his heel right for the orcs stomach. The orc caught his foot and pushed it disdainfully aside, but he laughed. &quot;Hah! I knew you had some fire in you! What&#39;s your name kid?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kid? Jeff spat. &quot;I&#39;m not telling you my name, and I&#39;m not going to be your damn slave. So you might as well let me go or kill me.&quot; The orc only grinned wider as he took another bite of fruit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right. You&#39;re not going to be my slave. I bought you because I need to bulk up my clan. The fucking weasel Braxis told me he had plenty of stock for sale.&quot; The orc snorted. &quot;Women, which are useless, and cowards, which I won&#39;t deal with. Only you had any spark. Waste of a trip, but I need to get something out of it. You&#39;ll make a good addition to my clan. If you live. And I&#39;d hate for you to die without me knowing your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff still didn&#39;t answer. &quot;What? Why would I join your clan? I&#39;m gone the moment you let me free.&quot;<br />
<br />
The orc shook his head. &quot;No, you&#39;ll stay willingly. They always do in the end. Now what&#39;s your name? As your future chief, you need to learn I don&#39;t stand having my questions ignored once. Much less three times.&quot; He popped the core of the fruit in his mouth, chewed and swallowed. Then he reached out and grabbed Jeff&#39;s chin in a powerful grip that made his jaw creak. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff.&quot; He finally hissed out between sharp breaths. The orc let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jeff? That&#39;s a shit name. We&#39;ll give you a better one. Let&#39;s see what we have to work with.&quot; The orc slipped a knife from his belt and wiggled it in front of Jeff. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t twitch too much. Wouldn&#39;t want to cut anything off.&quot; The orc started slicing Jeff&#39;s clothing away, tossing the scraps aside as casually as if he was skinning a rabbit he intended to eat for dinner.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name then?&quot; Jeff said, trying to sound cold as he glared at the orc.<br />
<br />
He didn&#39;t seem put off by the question, or upset by it. &quot;Dak. But you&#39;ll call me Chief, or Chief Dak. Understood.&quot; The knife pressed for a moment against Jeff&#39;s neck until he nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Chief.&quot; He hissed the word out with as much bile and scorn as he could, but the orc just nodded. Jeff&#39;s pants came off last and the orc just laughed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans. Hard to believe you make some fine orcs with the right spells.&quot; Dak reached out and flicked Jeff&#39;s cock teasingly. &quot;That wouldn&#39;t satisfy a mouse.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fuck you!&quot; Jeff growled, trying to lunge forward, but the chains rattled and brought him up short. The symbols on the cuffs were flaring a bright red.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha! There it is, feel that rage deep in you. That was the magic that made the first orcs, and that&#39;s what you&#39;ll need to live through it.&quot; Dak reached out and engulfed Jeff&#39;s cock in his massive hand, giving it a few teasing jerks. Jeff growled at the orc, the cuffs flaring brighter again, but he could feel himself growing hard under the touch. The rough calloused palms against his cock felt amazing, and he found himself fighting his chains for a different reason.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rage and passion and lust. Let it fill you up, human.&quot; Dak reached down and roughly pulled off his own loin cloth, revealing a hard green member more the size of Jeff&#39;s forearm. He began to jerk himself off, the giant member seeming perfectly sized for the orc&#39;s hand. Jeff stared at it with wide eyes.<br />
<br />
He could feel something stirring deep down inside of him. He wanted to put his mouth around that shaft. He could feel his mouth watering just looking at it, could feel the cuffs burning at his wrists, the massive hand firmly and insistently pulling at his cock. He came, growling deep in his throat as he did. Hot seed splashed over him, thick and heavy. Some of it got in his mouth, filling it with a salty, musky taste he eagerly swallowed. He could smell it on him, musky, and earthy,  and strong. Like an animal he scooped the Chief&#39;s seed off on himself and lapped it off his fingers.<br />
<br />
Then like a switch being flipped he realized what he was doing and gagged. He fell to his hands and knees and just barely avoided retching. &quot;What did you do to me?!&quot; The orc just laughed and stood up, striding over to his chair where he flopped down, naked, his cock resting along his thigh like a sleeping snake.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me? That was all you.&quot; The chief crossed his legs at the ankles, resting his hand on his muscle gut with a satisfied grin. &quot;It&#39;s already started. &quot; He said with a gesture to Jeff. &quot;There&#39;s no going back now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff sat back on his bare ass, the wolf pelts providing some comfort. Started? What was he talking about? Then he saw it. Between his legs, his cock had turned lost its pinkish color and was now a pale shade of green, the head a darker mossy tone. His once missing foreskin was partially regrown, covering the base of the glans but leaving the top exposed. His balls looked bigger, the skin the same pale green, and around the base, pitch black hair growing among the brown. Jeff wanted to howl.</p>
