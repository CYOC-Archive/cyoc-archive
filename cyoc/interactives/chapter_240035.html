<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Preston E. Jackson was minding his own business when another pedestrian appeared out of nowhere and nearly bowled him over. The person apologized but didn&#39;t stop as they ran down the street. When Preston collected himself he noticed the dingy little unmarked shop the person had come out of. Even though Preston walked this way every day on his way to the bus stop, the short pudgy businessman had never noticed this store before. He checked his phone. He had left for work early today so he had some time to spare and was very curious as to what was inside.<br />
<br />
A small bell above the door chimed when he pushed it open and something glinting in the sunlight immediately caught his eye. A steel ring sat on a little table next to the door. Preston picked it up, read the label and immediately blushed. It seemed he had walked into some kind of new age sex store. They probably sold fertility crystals and bracelets that align your auras and junk like that.<br />
<br />
Preston was about to put down the ring and walk out but couldn&#39;t help but be a little curious. He had always had issues with performance in the bed room, mostly pertaining to ejaculating far too early. Before insertion even. His first few “sexual” encounters if they could be called that resulted in failed relationships and had caused him to avoid pursuing sex for fear of further embarrassment. The idea of a magic cock ring was outlandish and he figured the ring would not have much power beyond maybe a placebo effect, but Preston was so desperate he&#39;d try anything at this point.<br />
<br />
He walked up to the old man at the counter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Umm excuse me, is there somewhere I could go to try on this...uhh try on one of your items?&quot;<br />
<br />
The old man looked up from the book he was reading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm? Oh yes, there&#39;s some change rooms in the back. Note all items are currently in display mode, only the primary functions will be available. Secondary functions will be unlocked after purchase. Yell out if you have any issues.&quot;<br />
<br />
Preston shuffled to the back and pulled himself into a small curtained booth. He nervously pulled his pants and underwear down to his knees and untied the twine on the ring. Preston could swear when he first saw the ring it was sized for a more endowed gentleman, however here in his hands it seemed for perfect size for his slightly below average penis. He pushed his genitals through the ring and it fit snugly around the base of his cock and balls. He rubbed the three droplet symbol as instructed from the label and saw the engraving briefly glow white before fading back to normal.<br />
<br />
Preston took out his phone and turned down the volume and turned the volume down so as to not draw attention. He loaded up his favorite porn video (The one that always made him cum in under two minutes) and began masturbating. After about 30 seconds he felt the usual tightness in his balls that meant he was about to shoot his load. However just as he was about to cum, he felt like something was holding back his orgasm, keeping him right on the edge. A minute passed. Then another. Then five more. Preston could hardly believe it. It felt amazing. As the video reached it’s climax Preston was still pumping away at his erect penis, more than ready to pop.<br />
<br />
“<b>Cum</b>” he whispered.<br />
<br />
Immediately all the pressure released along with an involuntary moan. Preston looked at himself in the change room mirror, awestruck as he fired spurt after spurt of thick white semen onto the glass, experiencing the most powerful orgasm he had ever had in his life. He shot half a dozen volleys before his penis began to settle down.<br />
<br />
“Are you quite all right in there?” He heard the old man ask from outside.<br />
<br />
Preston jumped with a start looking at the mess me made.<br />
<br />
“Uhh yes everything’s fine, I’ll be out in a minute”. He grabbed a conveniently placed roll of paper towels and started trying to mop everything up. As he wiped off the last remnants of cum dribbling from the tip of his flaccid penis he tried to remove the cock ring but found it seemed to be stuck.<br />
<br />
Preston cringed at the thought of asking the old man coming in to help him remove a cock ring especially with the fresh cum-stains on his clothing. There was probably just some trick to getting it off he could figure out later. He pulled up his pants still damp from semen and took the label that was previously tied to the ring to the front counter<br />
<br />
“Hi. I’d like to buy this. I’ll uhh...wear it out of the store.”<br />
<br />
The old man yawns and looks at the tag, noticing it had been marked for the bargain bin of defective items and begins rattling off the regular warning.<br />
<br />
&quot;Before I sell this, as a standard disclaimer I must inform you that this item comes with no guarantee or warranty. We are not responsible for any mishaps or malfunctions of this device, by making this purchase you agree that any...&quot;<br />
<br />
But Preston was not listening. His mind raced with the dirty fantasies of the acts he would engage in now that he could have confidence in his sexual prowess. Not to mention the intriguing extra functions he had yet to experiment with. Preston was not small by any means but what man wouldn&#39;t want a few extra inches on their dick. Suddenly his phone chimed breaking him out of his fantasy. He gulped as he read a text from his boss Mr Cummings telling Preston to see him in his office first thing. Then he saw the time. With a panic he realized his bus would be leaving soon. Preston turned back to the old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;...and advise when using this product you to take proper precautions against the defects I have outlined. Do you understand and agree to all the conditions stipulated?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes yes fine!&quot; Preston answered &quot;How much!?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;ll be fifty dollars&quot;<br />
<br />
Preston eagerly slapped the money on the counter and raced out the door, not even waiting for a receipt. He had already been late for work twice this week and couldn&#39;t afford to be late again. As the antique cash register chimed on his way out he felt the ring tingle but ignored it.</p>
