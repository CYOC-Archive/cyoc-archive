<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Vicky stood in the nude in a former hospital in what she viewed as occupied Miami, the occupiers of the city where not human but magical creatures and now they where about to make her one of them. Her blood was boiling with rage, rage at them, rage at her government who had handed her over to those who had murdered her brothers in battle as part of a damn peace treaty. She wanted to scream and she was about to do when the symbols above her head began to glow and spin before a bolt of light came down and hit her in the head.<br />
<br />
She expected pain, instead she felt a rush of pleasure.<br />
<br />
Before the rush of pleasure Vicky had covered herself, she was alone in the room but she still felt like she was being watch, she was but now she was curling herself up a bit as she felt a wave of pleasure. She was fighting the release of pleasure, biting her lip to keep it in, however she couldn’t anymore as she bolted upright and arched her back, her hands shooting out as she let out a deep full moan. She felt like she had just had the best sex she ever had but it just kept going.<br />
<br />
“No…no…must…” moaned Vicky as she was lifted into the air and leaned back so she was floating as if on a bed in the center of this seal. Even as she objected one of her hands moved to her breasts while another went down to her women hood. She didn’t care if she was being watched anymore, she just wanted to add to the pleasure and as she touched herself it only added to the pleasure.<br />
<br />
She was lost in pleasure, as her body began to change. Her skin smoothed out as all her body hair apart from her eyebrows and the top of her head fell away dissolving as they did. Her skin also began to started to become covered with a oil which would protect it and her little hair from the salt water. With that done, she skin and bones began to shift.<br />
<br />
Her face became slightly more feminine, her lips fuller, her neck elongated, her hands became more elegant. Her eyes which where half closed in pleasure as became fuller and brighter, her honey brown hair became brighter but remained the same color. Her ears shifted a bit becoming pointy like an elf but not over the top. She felt some slight discomfort as her hips narrowed in a bit even as her breasts grew out as they become fuller and perkier, they didn’t explode into D cups but going from a B cup to a large C cup becoming more sensitive in her hands. New muscles formed making a natural bra, which would help in her new life. Her breasts also grew out as her lungs changed to take in water as easily as they had taken air. <br />
<br />
She floated in the air, her upper body had changed to become an idealize version of herself, she had always considered herself average to above average but now she would turn heads anywhere she went. <br />
<br />
Then her lower body began to change, her legs began to merge together becoming a single limb as it grew out another 18 inches as her bones merged together and she added a lot of muscle mass to her lower body. <br />
<br />
In the back of her mind, Vicky noticed what was happening and new she was becoming a mermaid, but she didn’t really care right now, the pleasure was too great for her to really care. Her flesh from the waste down began to transform into scales before shifting to a mixture of royal blue, navy and gold scales. In the cartoons, it was a solid line between scales and flesh, however it wasn’t that simple, it was more of a transition with a few scales above her waistline but below her rib cage. She couldn’t see it but the scales went up to the small of her back. The last thing to change was her feet which stretched out into fins as they became dark navy blue with light robin egg blue membrane. <br />
<br />
With that done, she climaxed in a way she had never had before. Vicky was panty heavily as she was lowered down into the quickly flooding room. She was so tired from the mixture of the transformation and the climax she just had that she didn’t even notice when she took her first breath of salt water. Her now modified honey brown hair landing on the floor below her spreading out like a halo as she lied on the floor basking in the afterglow. <br />
<br />
She didn’t know it then, but mermaids/merman are considered the succubus of the sea. While they don’t “eat” sexual energy like them their sex drive is extremely high to the point that it was common to have sex or self-pleasure daily. Once that drive is awakened once they reach the age of 21, the term maid was kind of a joke. <br />
<br />
Right now Vicky didn’t care, she was so lost in the glow and the whole soreness which came from the transformation that Vicky closed her eyes and let sleep take her just as the doors opened and the staff came in to take care of the newest mythical creature. </p>

Where does Vicky wake up?</h3>
