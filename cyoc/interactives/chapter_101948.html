<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;That&#39;s My Son!&quot; Kyle screamed at Loki. &quot;I want my Son back!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... No.&quot; Loki, replied stealing a quick glance a Erik. &quot;He looks much better this way. Wouldn&#39;t you all agree? Quick, A show of hands, who thinks Erik looks good?&quot;<br />
<br />
The entire room, compelled to be honest, including Kyle, stopped what they were doing and raised their hands. The only one who didn&#39;t raise their had was Erik because he hasn&#39;t seen himself, and being 6 mentally, didn&#39;t really have a concept of good looking.<br />
<br />
Loki smirked to himself. &quot;See, even you agree.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik wasn&#39;t too sure what all this meant, only that he was now the same height as his father. His dad&#39;s protests to have his son back didn&#39;t make any sense because Erik was still right there. &quot;I&#39;m right here daddy, I didn&#39;t go anywhere.&quot; Erik said reaching out to his father.<br />
<br />
Kyle smacked Erik&#39;s hand away and screamed, &quot;YOU&#39;RE NOT MY SON!&quot; Erik fell to the ground and began crying, in true 6 year old fashion. Kyle fell to his knees weeping for the loss of his son.<br />
<br />
All this commotion drew the attention of the room... from Loki. Being the attention whore that he is, Loki couldn&#39;t stand for this.<br />
<br />
Loki pondered for a moment, &quot;No, this won&#39;t do...&quot; He pointed at Kyle, &quot;You are upset that you no longer have a child in your life. And you,&quot; directing his attention to Erik sobbing obnoxiously on the floor, &quot;grew up but never became a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki snapped his fingers and exclaimed, &quot;I&#39;ve got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kyle snapped his head up in horror, realizing where Loki was headed with this. &quot;You wou...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Silence&quot;, Loki screamed at Kyle, his patience growing thin. &quot;and be good, I&#39;m going to talk with Erik now, not that you would care, you disowned him not even a minute ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki&#39;s magic extended to everyone but Erik. Nobody could make a sound, Kyle repositioned to sit cross legged, the wedding party stood up straight, and the audience sat up attentively and watched. Then everyone was still.<br />
<br />
Erik was trying to stop sobbing, he felt awkward with everyone staring towards him silently. Loki looked down at him smiled, &quot;There, there. Loki is going to help you, how about you stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik stood up and started to explain, &quot;M-M-My daddy p-pu-pushed me and y-yelled at me, but I have been good all day like he asked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Although it was weird coming from a man&#39;s voice, It was at this point Kyle realized Erik was still his son. Kyle&#39;s heart broke all over again but he couldn&#39;t move, or make a sound, even his breathing rate was being controlled. Silently, fresh tears streamed down his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, sometimes adults say things they don&#39;t mean, have you ever said something you didn&#39;t mean?&quot; <br />
<br />
Erik nodded.<br />
<br />
Loki had Erik&#39;s and the rooms complete attention. &quot;Adults have very strong feelings too, I bet you didn&#39;t know that.&quot; he rested his hand on Erik&#39;s well muscled shoulder and gestured to the bridesmaids with his other hand. &quot;Look at those ladies over there. Which one do you think is pretty?&quot;<br />
<br />
Loki was rapidly enhancing Erik&#39;s natural instincts and his need for sexual release. &quot;Gee, I don&#39;t know. I guess they&#39;re all pretty.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if you had to pick the prettiest?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik&#39;s hand slipped down and was massaging his cock, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings.&quot; Loki tripled Erik&#39;s lust. &quot;But I would pick her.&quot; Erik pointed to the, now extra busty, blonde haired woman in the center with the slim frame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, why don&#39;t we say hi?&quot; Loki walked up to the girl and told Erik to introduce himself. <br />
<br />
Erik said, &quot;Hi, my name is Erik!&quot; extending his had to shake as he was taught to greet strangers.<br />
<br />
The woman though looking horrified, said, &quot;Hi my name is Sarah, its a ple...&quot; upon making physical contact they were both immediately overcome with lust and began having sex. <br />
<br />
Weirdly enough, it was completely silent though the two were clearly making what would normally be a lot of noise. The other bridesmaids looked on with various looks from lustful jealousy to relief. All the groomsmen, Kyle included, got raging erections.<br />
<br />
Loki was enjoying the spectacle, several moments in, all the other bridesmaids orgasmed in unison. Most moaned, breaking the silence, once screamed. Loki looked down at Kyle and said, &quot;You&#39;re probably going to want to stand for this.&quot; and Kyle stood up, not having a choice in the matter. Another moment passed before the groomsmen had a similar experience. Roaring, howling, grunting and Oh!ing could be heard down the hall.<br />
<br />
Erik stood up while Sarah stayed on the floor and immediately fell asleep. Erik had a distant look in his eyes and just stood there covered in sweat and breathing heavily. After a few seconds Erik reclothed himself... which is to say, he put the thong back on, which did not cover his still erect penis. From out of nowhere he lit up a cigarette and began smoking. It was as if he was oblivious to anyone else being there and thought he was outside.<br />
<br />
While Erik was having his cigarette, Sara was sleeping, and breasts were growing,<br />
<br />
Erik was about half way done with his cigarette when he walked over to Kyle seemingly in a daze, &quot;Dad,&quot; Erik smiled excitedly, &quot;Sarah and I are pregnant. You&#39;re going to be a grandpa!&quot;<br />
<br />
Erik quickly returned to his daze and continued smoking. Sarah began to show, her stomach quickly and steadily grew. <br />
<br />
Erik walked back over to his father, this time sounding a little anxious and surprised, &quot;We just found out it&#39;s going to be twins!&quot;<br />
<br />
This continued for the next 10 minutes or so when finally Sara looked like she was about to burst. She woke up and said, &quot;Honey, its time!&quot; Without hesitation Erik threw down his third cigarette and surgical gloves appeared on his hands. He kneeled by Sara and spread her legs, getting covered with fluid as Sara&#39;s water broke. Within moments the two infants were in the arms of nearby wedding guests wrapped in table cloths.<br />
<br />
The infants continued to grow at a rapid rate, the tablecloths transformed into clothes and by the time Sara had recovered and got to her feet the toddlers were running around talking and screaming. Sara and Erik walked over to Kyle and smiled warmly at him, &quot;Hi Dad, How&#39;ve you been?&quot; Addressing the children, &quot;Brandon, Monica, Come say hi to Grandpa!&quot;<br />
<br />
The children ran over and lept into their 26 year old grandfathers arms. Kyle was in shock for a moment but then his memories realigned and he accepted everything completely. He was probably the youngest grandpa in history and it makes no sense that he and his son are 4 months apart in age, but he no longer cared.<br />
<br />
Loki smiled, &quot;How wonderful, A wedding and two birthdays, what a wonderful day this is.&quot;</p>
