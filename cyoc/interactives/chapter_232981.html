<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Logan was only an 13 year old boy but with his father Seth&#39;s muscular body. An 13 year old boy&#39;s innocent smile was getting comfortably at home with his father&#39;s much more muscular body. The musculature, the body hair that covered his chest, arms and legs, not to mention the crotch above his new fantastic set of adult genitals was thrilling to be in. <br />
<br />
Logan&#39;s face wasn&#39;t exactly soft. He had his father&#39;s look to him, his eyes were narrow, his skin was smooth and small chin was firm. His dark brown hair was flat and of medium length, and he was beginning to show model looks. His father, Seth, on the other hand, was ruggedly handsome. He sighed as he gazed upon his father&#39;s dead. He would kill to have dad&#39;s face on top of this body and for him to be the handsome stud adult that could just attract babes and go to bars. His father&#39;s hair was darker and coarser, his thick stubble gave and the folds of his face were just the right amount of dadlike maturity. The kind that exuded manliness. His haircut, his voice, the looks he gave, even the way he winked...everything about his father&#39;s face emanated confidence and other men generally wanted to be like him. He was loud where Logan was shy, and he was very good with handling people, and he didn&#39;t let anyone push him around. <br />
<br />
Logan couldn&#39;t feel guilt with his dad&#39;s incredible body. His dad just had the most amazingly pumped muscles. Logan&#39;s muscles were incredibly weak in comparison. He didn&#39;t have ANY muscle definition on his arms and barely any on his skinny legs. His father was a different body type. Logan had inherited an ectomorph frame and his father clearly had an mesomorph frame with almost no gut. The rest of his body was absolutely jealousy inducing any time they went out together. Other men tended to get out of his dad&#39;s way or were completely jealous of how big his arms and chest were. <br />
<br />
He knew that he had to take his head off and give his father back his body. He was going to be in so much trouble if he waited any longer. Maybe his dad would actually thank him for taking on the mantle of going through his dad&#39;s hangover for him. Dad would be surprised that Logan had done it without permission, but he could just play innocent, he thought. He could tell Dad he was just trying to help!<br />
<br />
He reached to pull his head off, in spite of the incredible and amazing feel of having giant muscles and a grown man&#39;s body for the first time. But, he thought with annoyance, it...wasn&#39;t working. Maybe I&#39;m not doing it right. Ow! <br />
<br />
&quot;Why is this not working?&quot; He looked in the mirror. He put his big muscular arms at the side of his hips just like his dad did. His body was on auto pilot, often behaving just like his dad from the neck down. He was even walking with more confidence now, he thought, as he stomped through the house to look up a primer for beginners who wanted to swap heads responsibly. <br />
<br />
After Googling for about an hour and watching some how to videos, he still didn&#39;t understand what he was doing wrong. Until one video came along. A man who was an expert in the subject, a neuroscientist, said &quot;and just remember all you newbies, that you can&#39;t just swap back again at the tip of a hat. The fibrous tissue that allows you to detach the human head will not form again for 48 to 72 hours. So, be sure to plan around that IN ADVANCE.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Logan said out loud. His big arm moved to pause the video. He looked it up further. It took 2 to 3 days, and everyone said the same thing. Logan looked up &quot;things that can go wrong with head swaps&quot; and saw that there were even side effects and disorders that could occur. <br />
<br />
Then his eyes fell on a section for one medical website about swapping heads with an intoxicated person. The article read &quot;Dangers of Head Swaps With Intoxicated Persons&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;In the event a head swap occurs and one or both individuals are highly intoxicated with alcohol, marijuana, narcotics, opiates or various prescription drugs, the fibrous tissues of the neck which allow head removal may be temporarily subdued or in some cases nullified altogether.&quot; <br />
<br />
Logan didn&#39;t like the sound of that. <br />
<br />
&quot;In most cases, when someone is intoxicated above the legal limit, another head swap is usually not possible for less than 7 days after the initial removal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Seven DAYS?? Oh man, Dad&#39;s gonna kill me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Logan decided that people were going to find out about this no matter what he did. If he called someone, he might get in really big trouble. Or since Dad was the one that got drunk, maybe he could get in trouble. He had to ask Dad what they should do, so he decided to put Seth&#39;s dad on his 13 year old gangly frame. And even though he was 13, he hadn&#39;t even reach 5 feet yet. He was only 4 foot 9 inches! His dad&#39;s head in comparison to the body was going to be a little too big. It looked kind of funny, not in a good funny type of way. It just stood out. <br />
<br />
His father blinked. He saw his son&#39;s face. He rubbed his eyes. What the hell? Why were his fingers so soft? Was he wearing gloves? <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit, I got so wasted last night. I&#39;m sorry, kid.&quot; Seth blinked. Logan was smiling in a nervous way. <br />
<br />
&quot;Please don&#39;t be angry dad.&quot; Logan tilted his head. He was on the couch. And his body was under a blanket. Logan was sitting on his knees to avoid shocking his dad too much. He also had thrown a blanket over his enormous adult body. &quot;I sort of did something when you were asleep. You were sick, and I thought...I dunno...I thought...maybe I could be sick instead so you wouldn&#39;t have to be.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. Logan. LOGAN!&quot; His dad threw off the blanket and sat up and then swayed a bit as his head was a bigger proportion to his small body than he remembered. His loss of equilibrium lasted for a few seconds before he stared at his pathetic, tiny little arms. &quot;LOGAN! LOGAAAAN!&quot; He turned back to his son. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO?&quot; <br />
<br />
Logan dropped the blanket and stood up. Wow! He towered over his dad now! He smiled before he realized how mad his dad was. <br />
<br />
&quot;I never EVER gave you permission to do this! You are so grounded. Logan, I can&#39;t believe you did this! I cannot have the body of a child. We have to switch back right now!&quot; His dad sounded panicked. His dad never sounded panicked. Logan winced. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can&#39;t!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you mean you can&#39;t? You took your head off once. Oh, right. We have to wait a few days. Shit. Well we better be back by Monday because I have to be at WORK!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I never wanted to experiment like this!&quot; Seth said, spreading out his childlike hands and arms. &quot;Man, I really must look pretty stupid, huh?&quot; Dad sullenly walked over to the full length mirror in the living room. &quot;Man, the guys at work would never let me hear the end of this. If I show up like this, with this puny little body, they&#39;re gonna completely razz me! I&#39;ll never hear the end of this. I&#39;ll have to call in sick on Monday if we still can&#39;t take our heads off, then I&#39;ll go in Tuesday.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um...I don&#39;t think we can. You were really drunk.&quot; <br />
<br />
A dawning look of horror came over his father&#39;s face. He danced around in his son&#39;s nimble, thin body, jumping around in anxiety. &quot;Holy crap, holy crap, holy crap!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I watched every PSA video in Dullahan Ed class in high school about this shit! I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s happening to me! I thought I was safe, it&#39;s not like I was roofied into a headswap or anything!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s a roofie?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Nevermind. Shit. A week, I think? It takes like a week?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It takes 7 days or more if you were over the limit and I think you were. But at least you weren&#39;t taking any other drugs, right? Then it would be longer.&quot; <br />
<br />
Seth&#39;s eyes bulged. His smooth boy hand felt his weathered, stubbled face. The creases in his face, his laugh lines, turned into frown lines. &quot;Oh um. Yeah. You know um...okay. I might have taken a few pills last night. I...sort of...don&#39;t do it often, but every now and then I take um...a certain pill. It just loosens me up. I need the computer!&quot; He ran on his son&#39;s little legs, stumbling as he did so. He wasn&#39;t used to these weak but nimble legs! He couldn&#39;t put the same weight on them. It was odd even just sitting down and his legs didn&#39;t crowd each other with muscle like they had for decades. <br />
<br />
&quot;OH FUCK! IT COULD BE THREE OR FOUR WEEKS??? WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO???&quot; <br />
<br />
Logan screamed. He brought his dad&#39;s enormous, calloused working class man&#39;s hands up to his head. &quot;I didn&#39;t know! I thought I was helping you! I even threw up and had some really bad diarrhea! It was horrible!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Okay. Okay. Okay. We can deal with this. Oh my God, I need to go to work. I need to make money. I need to pay the bills. And you! You need to go to school. You&#39;re supposed to go to baseball practice today!&quot; <br />
<br />
Logan smiled. &quot;That would be so cool! I could really hit the ball harder than anyone now, I bet!&quot; <br />
<br />
His father rubbed his stubbled face with his boyish hand. It was disturbing not to have his regular hand and arm, he thought, feeling up his arms. Wow, he was a total wimp now! <br />
<br />
Several hours later...<br />
<br />
Logan was playing video games. He kept scratching his chest, armpits and sometimes his crotch, but his father would tell him not to do that in front of other people. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry. I&#39;m not used to having all this hair down there! And my balls are super itchy, Daddy!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright. Since we can&#39;t switch back very soon, I may as well give you the rundown on um...you know. Having a set of adult...balls and a bigger dick. You know the basics, right? I told you about this before. You can...produce semen now. It&#39;s going to...I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m already having this conversation with you. It&#39;s going to feel amazing when you rub your dick. Better than you can imagine. It&#39;s going to feel like this huge unbelievable rush. You&#39;re gonna love doing it. You&#39;re gonna want to do it a lot.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, and it&#39;s...normal. It&#39;s okay that you jack off in my body. You&#39;re going to have to. AND you&#39;re going to have to work out. You have to keep my muscles intact. That means workouts with weights five times a week. And cardio.&quot; He rubbed his stubble. &quot;And there&#39;s some other stuff. You know that your head will change, right? Like, normally it&#39;s three weeks to a month. You&#39;re gonna look more and more like me. You&#39;re gonna grow stubble and your head will age and take on my looks and I&#39;ll start to look more like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What are we gonna do, Dad? You said everyone would laugh at you. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not gonna be easy, but we&#39;re gonna have to just go about our lives in each other&#39;s bodies. You&#39;ll go to school with your adult body and I&#39;ll go to work in my new 13 year old frame. Oh shit, I forgot! My workplace has a no headswap without approval rule! We&#39;re supposed to get clearance for that shit. I have to drive forklifts and bulldozers. It&#39;s gonna be hell to do it with this little body! I don&#39;t know if I even can do my job now!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry, Dad!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, sweetheart. I&#39;ll figure it out.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m gonna go outside for a little while,&quot; Logan said, feeling the need for another cigarette. His father&#39;s pack of Camels was still in his pocket. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not in the front yard, only the back! Okay, sweetheart?&quot; Seth looked up at his hugely muscled, hairy son, who smiled meekly down at him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kay.&quot; <br />
<br />
He fished the cigarette out as quickly as he could and lit it, inhaled deeply, and exhaled in relief. He&#39;d been waiting for forever to smoke! He immediately felt relief. This felt amazing! He smoked like a pro, holding it the same way his dad did. Maybe if I smoke the way dad does, he thought, propping himself up against the side of the house the same way his dad used to, maybe I can do other things...<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck! I didn&#39;t tell you that you could do that!&quot; his father&#39;s voice interrupted his smoke break. <br />
<br />
&quot;Dad..I...I don&#39;t know why I did this. It just felt right.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Everything okay there, neighbor?&quot; Mr. Paulson asked from the other side of the fence. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah, everything&#39;s great!&quot; his father yelled back. &quot;Get inside!&quot; he seethed. Logan didn&#39;t know what to do with his cigarette so he kept it in his hand and when he got inside, put it back in his mouth and felt sweet relief once more. <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Dad, but it just feels really good. I feel like I&#39;ve always smoked cigarettes!&quot; He threw the cigarette he&#39;d finished in the metal disposal bin. <br />
<br />
&quot;I started smoking when you were born. I was stressed out and I need one even more now. Give me that pack!&quot; His father held out his 13 year old hand and put a cigarette in his mouth. He took the lighter awkwardly and tried to figure out how to use it. He thought he knew how to use a lighter. He finally got it to work and then took a drag. He coughed horribly. He tried it again and wanted to cry. It was horrible! Why would anyone do this to themselves. &quot;Here, take it! I can&#39;t stand it!&quot; Logan took the cigarette from his dad&#39;s hand. He smoked it without any problem. &quot;Tastes just fine to me! Tastes great! I love smoking!&quot; He smiled, rather proud of himself, dangling the Camel in his mouth and walking around, smoking just like his dad used to, feeling even more confident in his body now. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t believe this. This is weird. I don&#39;t like this.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Dad. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll feel better soon.&quot; He blew smoke too close to his dad and Seth started coughing and waving his hand around. <br />
&quot;It&#39;s just a little cigarette smoke, Dad. You like cigarette smoke!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know I do. I just...I need some time alone!&quot; <br />
<br />
Seth retired to the bathroom. He started crying. He couldn&#39;t let his son see him like this! He cleaned himself up and came out to see his son had found his barbell set. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Dad, look! I can do it all by myself, just like you!&quot; His son performed bicep curls and grunted as he did so. &quot;Wow this all feels amazing! No wonder you smoke and work out!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s um..it&#39;s great. I need to make a phone call.&quot; Seth excused himself as his son started some upright curls, an exercise he&#39;d never even heard of before. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I know it&#39;s a Saturday but it&#39;s an emergency, Dr. Phillips. My son...there&#39;s been a headswap incident.&quot; Seth filled his doctor in on the details and his doctor informed him that medically speaking, taking the fun time pills he had the other night had a direct impact on the behavior he and his son were exhibiting. His emotions were spiraling out of control. His son was feeling confident and didn&#39;t seem worried at all. As the doctor told him what to expect, his eyes glazed over. &quot;And there&#39;s nothing I can do to stop it? I see. Okay. Thank you.&quot; <br />
<br />
He came outside as his son was exercising his triceps. &quot;This feels so fuckin&#39; great! My body feels so fucking powerful like this!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Um, son? We need to talk.&quot; <br />
<br />
The barbells crashed to the floor. &quot;What is it, little man? Ha! I sound just like you when I say that! That&#39;s what you always call me but now...you&#39;re the little man!&quot; He put a big hand on his now miniature father&#39;s shoulder, and it shook Seth. It shook him how they had traded heights and he didn&#39;t have any of the advantages a man should talking to his son. <br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s something wrong with us. Those pills I took to relax...well...they have a side effect when combined with alcohol and head swaps. Apparently, it&#39;s going to precipitate behavioral changes. You&#39;re going to start acting like me and I&#39;m going to start acting like you.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;That doesn&#39;t usually happen during a headswap, though,&quot; Logan casually replied. &quot;But that explains why I&#39;m kind of feeling like this has always been my body. I mean, I&#39;m walking around like you do and I love cigarettes now.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and uh...I just...I&#39;m having some uh...emotional swings. I cried in the bathroom just now. I...I never cry. Over anything.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Aw, dad. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;ll talk to your manager at work and tell him it&#39;s all my fault. Don&#39;t you worry. It&#39;s going to be alright.&quot; Logan put a hand on his father&#39;s smaller shoulder and gave it a light squeeze. Then his dad started tearing up again and he pulled his dad in for a hug, and Seth felt comfort for the first time since he had woken up in this small body. The big muscular frame of the man-boy embracing him made him feel much better. He wiped his tears away. <br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks. It feels so weird to be like this. The doctor said we were also going to um...well...swap faces more quickly. Like, within maybe a week.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s great! That means it won&#39;t be as embarrassing for you to walk around with a mismatched head and body. And I get to look like you! People will think I&#39;m the adult! Maybe I can even go to work for you, huh?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think my manager is going to like this very much.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You just let me handle Steven. He and I go back a long way,&quot; Logan assured him. &quot;Now. How about we cook up some chicken for lunch, huh bud? I&#39;ll make some lunch. Here. Play some video games. They might help.&quot; Logan marched into the kitchen. He felt confident making meals now. High protein meals to feed his huge muscles! he thought proudly. He rubbed his chin. He was going to look like Dad in just a week! He was overjoyed. Stubble. I can shave my face just like a man! This will be great, he thought, and soon he and his small boy-man Dad at together amicably. Logan was stuffing his face like crazy while his Dad didn&#39;t need to eat nearly as much. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, I forgot how much I had to eat when I was big,&quot; Seth said, amazed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m going to really have to work out hard while I&#39;m in here. I gotta keep all this muscle so the ladies can appreciate the goods, if you know what I mean.&quot; Logan winked. <br />
<br />
Seth gulped. This was so weird. Logan was acting like a mature, confident man and I feel like an awkward teenager! <br />
<br />
He realized they would have to call his manager and explain what was happening...</p>
