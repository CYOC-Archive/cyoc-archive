Sara’s POV<br />
=========<br />
<br />
“Oh thank you, daddy!” I heard as my cage was carried into the next room. A tall man with the most exquisite moustache stood waiting with his young daughter. At least, he looked tall. It was difficult to tell when I was only about six inches tall.<br />
<br />
“Here you are, sir,” the peacock girl carrying me said, “Now for the finishing touch.”<br />
<br />
I opened my mouth to speak but found it slowly began to close by itself no matter how hard I try to fight it. I reached up to try to loosen my stiff jaw but found that my fingers would no longer move when I wanted them too and my arms moved in awkward jerking motions. I could move them up and down but not side to side at all! Even my neck wouldn’t move properly. I could turn left and right but looking up and down felt like it wasn’t even possible. I jerked my arms into right angles, raising my hands to eye level. Instead of moving my eyes to face each hand I found that my whole head moved – I could only look directly forwards! Light shone off my hand in the most unusual of ways.  The skin looked so incredibly smooth and featureless, like plastic.<br />
<br />
“Oh no!” I thought, taking a step back on stiff legs. My expression remained the same even as I realized the terrible truth. I’d been turned into a doll!<br />
<br />
“Wonderful!” the man exclaimed.<br />
<br />
“I finally have one! A REAL Princess! Can I carry her, daddy?” asked the little girl. I could see her much better now. She wore a very pretty blue dress, not unlike mine, with white frills around the edge. Around her neck was an eclectic necklace with beads of all sorts of colors, patterns as sizes. <br />
<br />
“Of course, Lucy, dear. Just don’t drop her. We don’t want another incident like Mister Bear.” The father said.<br />
<br />
The little girl, Lucy, nodded and reached into my birdcage. I tried to flee to the back of the cage but my legs wouldn’t budge. Then I tried batting her giant hand away but my arms refused to move. I couldn’t even turn my head to look away. I was motionless. Inanimate. A doll.<br />
<br />
Lucy held me tightly all the way home. Her house was an elegant mansion made all the more impressive by the fact that it currently appeared to me to be ten times the size. The large hall<br />
seemed more like a gigantic theatre. I didn’t have long to take in the statues, paintings and other furnishings that decorated the interior of the mansion before Lucy took off at full speed up the stairs toward her bedroom. As we ascended I felt powerful winds pushing back my hair and threatening to pull me from her grip. I couldn’t help but feel afraid. If she had dropped me from such a great height I’d surely perish! When she reached the top of the stairs she turned and seemed to speed up as we went down a long hallway to her bedroom. We’d travelled more than a doll-sized mile for sure. Escaping at this size would be difficult if I could figure out how to move.<br />
<br />
Lucy’s room was painted pastel blue with clouds and balloons dotted about the walls. Beside her bed was a pile of colourful stuffed animals and a toy box poked out from beneath the bed. I caught a brief glimpse at another dolls leg in the toy box before Lucy unceremoniously dropped to the floor, sitting directly in front of a huge mirror.<br />
<br />
She sat me down on her lap and produced a hair brush that was bigger than I was. I could see myself in the mirror now. I was clearly still myself but I had the most vacuous smile on my face. I’m certain I don’t look that way usually!<br />
<br />
Lucy went ahead brushing my hair gently which I was quite grateful for. It had gotten awfully messy. After several minutes of brushing I felt very relaxed. There is just something calming about having your hair untangled for you. My peacefulness did not last long though as Lucy began playing at the back of my dress.<br />
<br />
“What are you doing?” I silently asked, Lucy.<br />
<br />
“This dress is getting very tattered. You should be ashamed. A Princess can’t be seen in such rags!” by coincidence she answered. <br />
<br />
My dress really was a mess by now and I very much wanted a new one but I didn’t want a child stripping me in such an undignified fashion. My mute protests fell on no ears, however, and the child practically tore my dress from my body. Aside from a small belly button my body was now just as featureless as my arms, I didn’t even have nipples. I could see the joints that connected my arms and legs now, too. Something about that disturbed me. Maybe it was the thought that they were these separate, detachable things, not a part of me, nor under my control. As I sat, naked and a little scared my expression stayed the same vacant stare like some kind of dumb simpleton.<br />
<br />
With my change my clothes had been transformed into a simple button up dolls dress and rubber shoes. I didn’t even have underwear! Now, I sat completely naked in front of a mirror whilst Lucy began rummaging through a bag that I imagine was filled with dolls clothes. Part of me was very curious as to what outfits she had in there and I became a little excited to find out what she would pick.<br />
<br />
“The nice lady at the auction gave me this farm girl outfit,” Lucy said holding it to the mirror where I could see, “she said it was your favourite but it is not fit for a Princess. So how about…this!”<br />
<br />
Lucy held up another dress, silky turquoise with gold sequins. It was quite lovely. I thought I may as well try to make the most of this, who knows? If I ended up looking good in the doll size dress I would look amazing in a full sized one!  I was a little disappointed when Lucy roughly grabbed me by the legs and shoved me up and into the dress which was quite a novel way to get changed. Then she set me down in front of the mirror once more. I certainly did look very pretty but I still felt like something was missing.<br />
<br />
“What? No underwear?” I asked.<br />
<br />
“I know what you’re missing!” Lucy said, surely another coincidence.<br />
<br />
At hearing that, I perked up and began thinking of matching turquoise panties.<br />
<br />
“There you go!” the girl said as she placed something on my head, a little gold plastic tiara.<br />
<br />
“Thanks,” I sighed, inwardly. It was as if underwear was some kind of privilege that dolls weren’t allowed to enjoy!<br />
<br />
Having plenty of time to think I realized I wasn’t at all scared or worried. I’d been Morgana’s prisoner before and it wasn’t so bad. This wasn’t much different. I quite enjoyed it in all honesty. As a Princess, I was used to this kind of treatment. It reminded me of home. My maid-in-waiting would brush my hair, bathe me and choose my dresses for me so being a doll wasn’t actually much different!</p>
