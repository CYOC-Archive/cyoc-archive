<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Alright, now that everything is in order. Mary&#39;s got the bathroom, and Michael wins the bedroom, in return for going purple.&quot;<br />
<br />
I scoffed. Going paper only wasn&#39;t the right choice after all, I won the second time, but after a while Jonas saw through my trick. Not that it was difficult to discover. Therefore, I had to take the purple pill. Meaning that I was only going to get a partial transformation, not something to look forward to that much. I was glad that the change was at least temporary.<br />
<br />
I held a glass of water in one hand, and the pill in the other.<br />
<br />
&quot;At three.&quot; Jonas said, looking at the too of us. We nodded back at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;One, two, three.&quot; We threw our heads back, the pill clattering against my front teeth. Next, I took a large gulp of water, and swallowed it all down. I felt its cylindrical shape slide down my throat, only to then land on the bottom of my empty stomach. I hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast, meaning that the chemicals were likely to get into my bloodstream faster than normal. For that reason, I quickly stood up and headed over to my bedroom.<br />
<br />
I lied down on my bed, crossing my legs, and plugging my earphones in, to listen to some music during the change. I felt the new sensations as soon as my head hit the pillow, and closed my eyes as I felt a rush of warmth and pleasure surge through my body.<br />
<br />
Since I was still fully aware of what was happening to me, I felt that most of it was centered around my crotch, much to both my displeasure and relief. Displeasure because it meant missing a much valued member I&#39;ve known for all of my life, relief because I could hide that change, if the pill&#39;s effects took slightly longer to run out.<br />
<br />
As the warmth centered around my crotch grew, the pleasure grew with it. I felt my dick turning hard, forming a large bulge inside my pants, that I still had on. On occasion, the warmth flared outwards from my crotch, over the skin of my legs and belly. Scratching my belly with my right hand for a moment, I felt how some of my, admittedly rough hair, had simply thinned out, or all around disappeared from that particular region.<br />
<br />
Further up my chest, the same sensations were notable, both on my skin, and deeper below it. I didn&#39;t necessarily feel my shirt expand outward, and as I opened my eyes slightly, I could still feel my chest rise and fall as it normally did. This time however, two large nubs were excitedly poking out from under neath my shirt&#39;s fabric. Bringing my thumb and index finger to one of them, I felt it erect even more, almost painfully so.<br />
<br />
What I did feel expand, was my butt. Without my say-so, my back seemed to arch up slightly, losing contact with my still loose hanging shirt. I squared my shoulders slightly, and grunted in discomfort, pain even, as the seams of my jeans seemed to give out on the two expanding units within. The same sensations applied to the fabric between my thighs, and I could&#39;ve sworn that I heard it rip right below my crotch. To my luck, my boxer shorts stretched along with my butt and legs, them having slightly more elasticity than my now ruined blue jeans. It was going to be hard getting out of them once the changes were done.<br />
<br />
And they had ended mostly. The muscles in my chest relaxed, and my feet and leg muscles were no longer cramping or twitching. However, the sensations in my groin increased tenfold, and I realized exactly where the pill was going to do most of its work. However wrong it was supposed to feel however, for its wrongness, it still didn&#39;t feel right. Do you get me? The sensations are obviously strange and unfamiliar, but besides that, there was also this strange wrongness that something didn&#39;t add up.<br />
<br />
My cock and balls were shrinking, that much became clear as the pressure I felt in my crotch, because of the sudden expansion of my butt cheeks, seemed to subside. I heard my stomach churn as internally, my body made way for the creation of a uterus and additional organs. And yet... I couldn&#39;t place it.<br />
<br />
After a while, with a sensation of parting skin, an opening formed between two folds. I spread my legs, and tried to feel it. Only to feel another rush of warmth and pleasure, as the same thing happened again, right beside the original one. The intensity of the pleasure increased, and I squirmed on my bed as the sensations built, to a peak, and I experienced a very intense orgasm. Vaginal or clitoral, or otherwise, it was the strongest one I had ever felt.<br />
<br />
My hand hadn&#39;t left my crotch since I tried to get a feel from it. But despite its lack of a large bulge, I could still feel more humps of skin than there was supposed to be.<br />
<br />
I knew what a camel toe was, as well as what it was supposed to look like. Through yoga pants especially, they could be very visible. Two bumps inside a woman&#39;s groin area, sticking out through cotton or polyester fabric. Sometimes a third, when the clitoris was engorged, like I believed it to be in my own case, after the orgasm I had experienced.<br />
<br />
In the case of my change, I counted more than three bumps however. In my case, there were six, four large ones, in sets next to each other, and two smaller, harder ones in between each set.<br />
<br />
It was hard removing my already ruined jeans from my upper legs, as the latter had expanded marginally. More fat had ended up in these places, whilst my lower legs had gotten thinner, and my belly had gotten leaner. My feet had gotten smaller as well, if that played a role in the distribution of changes. I felt more fabric tear after one last tug, and without looking back at it again, I threw my jeans in trash the bin below my work desk.<br />
<br />
I already knew what my changes were, and thus felt no shame in hiding it to myself anymore. I only felt more anticipation than before, and even more arousal. Even through my jeans, I felt that my boxers were soaked. From the orgasm I had to begin with, but the tingly sensations hadn&#39;t subsided since then. It wasn&#39;t an uncommon truth after all, that women could orgasm more than once during sexual intercourse. I sat down on my desk chair and spread my legs to see the damage.<br />
<br />
Two labia majora, smooth and hairless, right next to each other. I had to mention them in plural form, because, it meant that there were four lips total, and eight if I added the labia minora as well. Upon touch I felt the same oversensitive, pleasurable sensations, erupt from two different clits, both knobs made out of nerve endings placed right next to each other inside my crotch, not even an inch away from one another.<br />
<br />
Two different muscles contracted at separate times, although without much of an interval in between. I could feel their difference. When I concentrated, I could contract the vaginal muscles myself, first on my left, then on my right, then my left again. I let out a soundless laugh, more an outtake of breath in wonder, whilst wearing a flabbergasted smile on my face. Upon one more contraction of my left-most vaginal muscles, a drop of... something came out from the hole, and ran down my buttcrack. These... rather unique changes ended there, leaving me with two clitorisses, two vaginal openings, yet only one anal opening. My nipples had grown, I noticed, becoming more fit on a woman&#39;s chest, while my own chest had expanded indeed, but only to look more like the chest you could see on a professional male bodybuilder, whereas I used to have no muscles on my chest whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I had to recover for a moment, I guessed. As soon as I was done recovering, I would change into some different underwear, and put on some pants again. Though I believed leggings were my only possible choice of fashion for now.</p>
