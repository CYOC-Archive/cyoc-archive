<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Adam was having a strange dream.  In the dream, he was still in the sewer tunnel, but he had found Evelyn.  She was transformed, but did not appear as monstrous as Mary Lou.  She had green skin, but still had a very feminine shape, with wide hips and a very large chest, much larger than he remembered.  In the dream, the zoo staff had found them, but he was bravely repulsing their attacks with his bare hands.  His body had never felt this good before, this strong.  It actually felt very arousing.  And with each attack, he felt like he was getting stronger.  He eagerly awaited the next attack, and taunted his pursuers until they attacked him.<br />
.<br />
&quot;Adam, wake up&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam turned to Evelyn, and saw her speak to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up, we need to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam shook his head.  No, we&#39;re fine, and this feels too good to stop, he thought.  He turned to face his enemies again, but they appeared to be fading.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wake up, Adam.&quot; Now he felt Evelyn pulling on his arm urgently.  He tried to brush her away, but it was too late, the dream was over.<br />
<br />
Adam looked in the darkness, and saw a familiar figure from his dreams.  &quot;Evelyn?&quot; he asked.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou scoffed.  &quot;No, you fool, it&#39;s me, Mary Lou.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam sat bolt upright, and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.  &quot;Mary Lou! What happened to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The same thing that happened to you.  The shampoo did its magic once again, apparently, &quot; she said with smile.<br />
<br />
Adam looked down at himself, and saw what she meant.  His skin was covered in soft leather.  He also noticed he was quite nude, and sporting a large erection.  He jumped up and tried to cover himself.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou chuckled a little.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear.  That&#39;s not the first one I&#39;ve seen. And you have nothing to be embarrassed about, &quot; she said with a smile.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why the hell did you take my clothes off? Are you some kind of pervert!&quot; yelled Adam.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re one to talk!  You&#39;ve got a massive hard-on and I&#39;m the pervert!  You grew out of your clothes while you slept, fool, &quot; said Mary Lou.<br />
<br />
Adam looked to the torn clothes in the corner, and saw she was right.  He grabbed some of the rags, and tried to cover up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dear, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to work.  You really don&#39;t need to wear anything anymore.  Just relax, think about something else, and it will go away, &quot; said Mary Lou, with the tone of teacher explain something to a difficult pupil.<br />
<br />
Adam relaxed, and the penis abruptly retracted into his cloaca.  Adam was a little shocked.<br />
<br />
Mary Lou chuckled.  &quot;Male alligators are permanently erect. When they are ready to mate, they tense up, and the penis pops out fully erect.  You&#39;ve got a lot to learn, &quot; said Mary Lou, as she gently placed a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
Adam roughly knocked it off.  &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing to learn, because I&#39;m not going to stay this way. Your plan may have worked, but only temporarily.  As soon as I get out of here, I&#39;m getting back to normal. &quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou backed away and raised her hands in a placating fashion.  &quot;Okay, okay, whatever you say.  I&#39;m just trying to help. &quot;  Now that they were the same size, roughly 7 and a half feet tall, Mary Lou knew she could no longer use her strength to intimidate him.  She would have to use tact when dealing with him. &quot;I said I was sorry, and I can&#39;t reverse what&#39;s been done.  So, please , dear, tell me what I can do to help you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam felt angry.  Her placating tone seemed condescending, but she did have a point.  He looked around his current location.  &quot;Well, we can&#39;t go back. I saw the zoo staff pursuing us as we ran.  And I certainly don&#39;t want to run into them like this.  &quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou nodded patiently, like an adult watching a child talk themselves through a difficult school problem.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I guess our first need is to find a safe place to hide until we can figure this out. &quot; said Adam.  Mary Lou had positioned herself carefully, leaning her wide hips against the ladder leading to the manhole above.  Adam looked at Mary Lou, then the ladder and said, &quot;I know.  We should be small enough to fit through the manhole now.  It will be harder for the zoo staff to find us once we&#39;re out of the sewer.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent idea, dear. &quot; said Mary Lou, as she slipped her satchel over her shoulder, and started to climb the ladder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, &quot; said Adam.  &quot;We don&#39;t know where that leads.  It could be a street in the middle of downtown.  And its broad daylight.  Everyone will see us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Actually, its a little after dusk.  We slept for quite a while, &quot; said Mary Lou.  &quot;And it leads to a small suburban street.  There&#39;s a large pond just past the forest at the edge of the street. If we&#39;re careful, I don&#39;t think anyone will see us.  Come one, let&#39;s hurry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam put his hands on his hips and stared at Mary Lou&#39;s back so intensely she could feel it.  &quot;So, you&#39;ve already been outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou slowly descended the ladder, and turned to face him.  She ducked her head down,  staring at her feet and away from his stern gaze and quietly said, &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were already free, and could get away easily, then why did you come back? Why didn&#39;t you just leave me alone!&quot; said Adam angrily.<br />
<br />
Slowly, Mary  Lou raised her head and looked Adam in the face.  With a shock, he saw there were tears in her eyes.  &quot;I felt bad, okay.  Evelyn got lost trying to help me.  And now you were transformed by me against your will.  I was just trying to help you, trying to do something good to make up for all the bad.  I knew the zoo would find you, and I didn&#39;t want you to end up like some kind of pet ......... like I was.&quot;  Mary Lou continued to cry softly.<br />
<br />
Adam walked up to her, hugged her, and held her close to his chest.  &quot;There, there. It&#39;s okay, &quot; he said and he gently patted her back. &quot;I know you didn&#39;t mean to hurt anyone, and I&#39;m sorry, too.  For making false assumptions, and treating you so poorly.&quot;<br />
<br />
With her head in his chest, Mary Lou smiled evilly.  This is working even better than I planned, she thought.  By the end of the night, he will be mine.  She wiped away her fake tears, formed an innocent grin and looked into his eyes.  &quot;Really, &quot; she said sweetly.  &quot;You forgive me?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adam sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m not happy about it, but I understand why you did it. And I appreciate you coming back to save me.  Yes, I forgive you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mary Lou squealed with glee.  &quot;Thank you, you don&#39;t know what that means to me.&quot; And then she hugged him tightly.  Suddenly, she felt his penis poking her sharply.<br />
<br />
Adam quickly turned away, embarrassed.  &quot;Sorry about that.&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Still a little difficult to control.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, &quot; said Mary Lou, happily.  &quot;You&#39;ll get the hang of it.  Not let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; Mary Lou ascended the ladder to the manhole with surprising speed, and Adam followed closely behind her.</p>
