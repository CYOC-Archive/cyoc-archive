<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Cassidy found Naomi and Diane at school the next day and acted her high school chipper self in front of them. She noticed that the two of them were finishing up talking with the rest of their friends. Cassidy used her phone and took a few pictures of the others, then caught up with Naomi and Diane as the three of them proceeded to head to class.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey you two, would you, uh, would you two like to take a picture with me? I realized I&#39;ve been friends with you two for a while now and have yet to actually have a picture of us.&quot; Cassidy asked them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure Cassie, we&#39;d love to.&quot; Diane said as Naomi nodded in agreement.<br />
<br />
Cassidy, Diane, and Naomi all posed together for the picture with smiles as Diane and Naomi, and Cassidy all went on ahead to their classes.<br />
<br />

<br />
Natalia and Reiko were at the local mall trying on different outfits. Reiko was having a great time, she couldn&#39;t think of the last time she&#39;d had so much fun with someone she thought of as a best friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what do you think?&quot; Natalia asked showing Reiko a dress that revealed her legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&#39;re all beautiful on you Natalia, hell, you&#39;re making this old woman blush.&quot; Reiko chuckled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, Reiko, you&#39;re not the least bit old in my eyes. Now come on, show me what you&#39;ve picked out.&quot; Natalia urged as Reiko showed her own clothes she&#39;d chosen that were modest at best.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reiko, come on now, try and go out a little bit more, you may be married but you can still look amazing. Here try this one on.&quot; Natalia suggested as she handed Reiko one of the dresses she&#39;d picked out, which was a sparkling cocktail mini-dress. Reiko was hesitant while in the changing room but came out with confidence and Natalia backed her up with clapping making Reiko blush more than she had in a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, girl you are definitely wearing that when we go out for dinner and drinks on me tonight.&quot; Natalia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;d do all that for me? I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just say thanks Reiko, anything for a friend.&quot; Natalia said as Reiko gave her a girlish squeal which Natalia returned.<br />
<br />
**************************************************<br />
<br />
Duncan had picked Cassidy up from school that day and she was going through her phones picture gallery as Duncan drove.<br />
<br />
&quot;Diane and Naomi have at least three other friends who seem to have magic just like them. Two of them have attracted some old &#39;friends&#39; of ours. That bastard demon hunter&#39;s son, and the little traitor himself, Duke. I&#39;ve overheard their names now, &#39;Gloria&#39; is dating the demon hunter while this &#39;Sasha&#39; girl is dating Duke. There was another girl named &#39;Jackie&#39;, but other than magic I&#39;ve yet to discover if she has a significant partner currently. I think I did see her with someone at that Halloween party but I couldn&#39;t tell who she is out of costume.&quot; Cassidy explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Very good. I spoke with Lord Miro earlier. He was not pleased with our recent loss of vampires.&quot; Duncan said shaking his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, then you&#39;ll be happy about this. At that party, I made out with a....disgusting human boy, but I turned him. He no doubt went home to his family and have turned them as well. It&#39;s just a matter of time, until they find some more &#39;willing&#39; recruits.&quot; Cassidy revealed to her father.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it seems we&#39;re far enough away and in a secluded enough area....I think this calls for a little reward.&quot; Duncan said as Cassidy smirked.<br />
<br />
Duncan and Cassidy were on each other almost immediately with Cassidy applying lipstick and Duncan touching Cassidy on her most sensitive spots. Twenty minutes later they had finished and proceeded home. Before they entered, they noticed a young man walking up to them.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll get rid of him.&quot; Duncan said cracking his knuckles.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, don&#39;t bother. This is the young man I was telling you about before.&quot; Cassidy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wyatt, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Cassidy asked as he approached with at least nine more people behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it was. I can&#39;t explain it....but we all came here as if we were drawn.&quot; Wyatt said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You were young man. You were drawn to your lord and master, Lord Miro. What you all have lost, he can give back to you at least ten fold. Whether you were on the verge of death, diagnosed with a disease, felt like the world was attacking you, he has given you all a new chance at life. Now come with us, there is much more for you all to learn about our new world to come.&quot; Duncan motioned for them to come inside.<br />
<br />
*******************************************<br />
<br />
Caleb was a little disappointed that his dad had asked him to go out with him tonight on a hunt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually you like doing these kinds of things.&quot; Jacob said as he was checking his ammunition.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but I....told Gloria I would make up for our &#39;first date&#39; by going on a date like she wanted.&quot; Caleb said as he finished checking all of his equipment.<br />
<br />
Jacob drove up to what was an abandoned pharmacy store. He didn&#39;t know why but he felt a little uneasy about this one.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, uh...if this gets too hot, we&#39;re bailing the moment I say so.&quot; Jacob said to Caleb.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure? You don&#39;t usually say that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve just....got a really bad feeling about this place.&quot; Jacob said as they made their way to the back. Caleb sent Spark in ahead, and waited a little bit for her to get back.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s about five in there, they were talking to someone, but I couldn&#39;t see who.&quot; Spark informed them.<br />
<br />
They set a demolition charge on the door as the door blew open and they carefully made their way inside. They could hear voices coming from the front of the pharmacy.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we won&#39;t be trying to turn them?&quot; One of the other vampires asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, no, as good as that would be for us, they&#39;d both die before they would ever become a vampire.&quot; A voice answered that sounded like an older male voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then why are the rest of us here? It seems like you&#39;d do fine on your own.&quot; A different vampire asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I would, but I figured a few more extra hands wouldn&#39;t hurt. It&#39;s good to have some backup. Isn&#39;t that right, Mr. Moreland?&quot; The older vampire voice asked aloud.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mr. Moreland, I&#39;m well away that you and your son are here, so please don&#39;t bother with the theatrics, just come out front.&quot; The vampire asked as Jacob and Caleb looked confused at each other before Jacob took a sigh and nodded for the two of them to proceed out.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Caleb stood in front of four vampires with an older looking one in the back.<br />
<br />
&quot;I figured you had figured out one of our many hideouts and decided that I&#39;d pay a personal visit to you myself.&quot; The vampire said as she stepped forward holding a sword and showing the two of them his eyes were clearly blind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ken, I presume.&quot; Jacob said surprised.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, surprised it sounds. Yes, my reputation must proceed to you as it likely has your son. I&#39;m sure your son is more than capable of battling these other vampires, why not you and myself have a little sword duel? I&#39;m quite interested in your swordsmanship.&quot; Ken suggested.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, you bastard, I agree. Hand me a sword and I&#39;ll show you my skill.&quot; Jacob said with a spit towards Ken as he threw him a sword.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad....&quot; Caleb said trying to argue.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t argue boy. Just take out those other assholes.&quot; Jacob said as Caleb listened to his father and proceeded to shoot at the other vampires who managed to dodge him at first.<br />
<br />
Jacob and Ken began their sword duel, with Jacob managing to hold his own. After a few minutes, Jacob came to realize that Ken was much more skilled in the art of the blades than he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Got to do things the old fashioned way, why can&#39;t you just use guns like the rest of the world?!&quot; Jacob said as he was fighting Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;There&#39;s no art to it. You can kill enemies from a distance, but they&#39;d never see you up close, you don&#39;t get a sense of their fighting ability, their strength, or even their mind.&quot; Ken replied as he came near Jacob&#39;s skin with his sword.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Caleb was fighting the other vampires with superior ease. He had wondered why exactly his dad had gotten a bad feeling earlier, this &#39;Ken&#39; vampire didn&#39;t seem much of a challenge and the other vampires were almost regular cannon fodder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just eat some of these bullets you assholes!&quot; Caleb taunted as the other vampires looked a little frightened.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Gotten afraid of me now?&quot; Caleb asked as he faced two in front of him with one standing behind him. The two in front of him looked frightened at Caleb it seemed, but Caleb realized that they were more afraid of something behind him.<br />
<br />
Caleb turned to see the third vampire standing there with his heart outside of his chest and then he disintegrated completely as Caleb saw a little girl who looked no more than 8 years old eat the dead vampire&#39;s heart like a snack before tossing it aside and ran towards Caleb knocking him down hard in his stomach. Caleb could almost feel a cracked rib as he began to crawl fast as he could away from the girl.<br />
<br />
Caleb managed to stand up with all his might and pain to go over to where his dad was and see that he was struggling against the swordsman, Ken.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad! It&#39;s that girl! Ann, she&#39;s here too!&quot; Caleb said he coughed up a little blood then felt a hard push from behind him as he fell on the floor. He also felt his hat being taken off his head.<br />
<br />
Caleb looked up to see his dad get pushed down against a wall and Ken&#39;s sword pushed into his shoulder blade making him stick to the wall as the little girl made her way over to Ken whilst tearing up Caleb&#39;s hat.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go on and finish me then you bastards.&quot; Jacob said as he spat his blood at them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, should we honor Mr. Moreland&#39;s request and finish him?&quot; Ken asked Ann who stomped twice for &#39;No&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;No? Then what should we do now?&quot; Ken asked as little Ann made her way over to Jacob and pulled Jacob&#39;s right arm off completely with all her might.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dad!&quot; Caleb cried out as he got out tear gas and tossed it towards the three of them. It took Caleb all his remaining strength, but he managed to carry his dad out of the pharmacy from one of their biggest losses in a long time.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was a warning Morelands! Keep meddling in Miro&#39;s affairs and it&#39;ll be much worse for you both!&quot; Ken shouted to them.<br />
<br />
Ken heard nibbling next to him from Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, are you chewing on that Moreland man&#39;s severed arm?&quot; Ken asked as Ann stomped once for yes.</p>
