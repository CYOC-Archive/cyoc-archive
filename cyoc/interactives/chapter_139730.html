<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Grunt grunt, wreee.”<br />
<br />
“That’s my girl, Princess Sow Cunt.” Mario grinned, playing with is tubby sow toy boi from behind, both of them in front of the mirror.<br />
<br />
It was 2 weeks since Mario had first played with the real Adam instead of turning him into a sow, and since that time he had kept Adam a sow as much as possible.  Until tonight, when he again wanted to show Adam how much of a sow he was becoming all on his own.  “You’re such a good girl.” He pinched one of her big nipples and Adam squealed in delight.  “You’re going to become the world’s fattest, dumbest, most prize-winning sow, aren’t you girl?” Mario laughed, and Adam simply grunted dumbly as a line of drool ran from his lower lip.<br />
<br />
In just two weeks, since that night when he was left his natural self, Adam’s weight had ballooned to over 400 pounds - he could only be described as round now, morbidly obese.  Mario had taken to enhancing his own body with larger muscles out of necessity, since Adam was so heavy now even in his own form.  Ironically it was without the use of any magic that his body was more rapidly lining up with Mario’s fantasy of Adam becoming an anthro sow boi.<br />
<br />
Adams eyes were vacant, as he stared at himself in the full-length mirror in front of him, Mario behind him feeling his fat body up, playing with Adam’s teats, but unable to even reach Adam’s very tiny cock an balls from behind now.  In fact, the only small thing about Adam now was his baby-sized cock and balls and his shrinking IQ.  It was hilariously small in comparison to how huge everything else about him was now. The best part was, no magic was even involved.  It’s like Adam’s body was simply a big, fat pile of blubber for Mario to reshape as he saw fit.  Even as Adam got fatter and more sowish in real life, so Mario got fitter.<br />
<br />
He petted his obese pet sow on its shiny – and now bald – head.  There was no hair on Adam’s head now – not even eyebrows – except for the long, dark-haired goatee that was braided hanging from his chinny chin chins. Adam’s eyes stared out from big, fat cheeks and his up-pointing snout-like nose, devoid of any intelligence at the moment (and increasigly so the rest of the time too, even when Adam could think!) - his moobs jutted out, nipples larger than his hysterically tiny baby-dick, belly and love handles huge and starting to hang toward his knees, thunder thighs keeping his wide-load ass up off the floor, his body a study in jiggling curves of fat.<br />
<br />
&quot;I should take you home to show off to your family, let them see what you really are deep inside - just a big fat sow hungry for cock and wanting to nurse piglets with these.&quot; Mario jiggled both of Adam&#39;s moobs, and the fat boi squealed in delight at the thought as he felt what he was coming to think of has his pussy running wet with precum.  Deep inside, Adam was screaming no, screaming for it all to stop... but in that moment, the real Adam realized that even deeper down she wanted to be revealed to the world as Mario&#39;s obese sow princess.  She felt so small and fragile inside, awkward in such a hugely big fat body, and yet this turned her on even more.  She never felt safer than when she was in Mario&#39;s arms (well, as much as she fit, anyway), or kneeling between Mario&#39;s muscular thighs, tenderly licking Mario&#39;s manly hairy balls, or sucking the cum out of his big, hard cock.  &quot;I can tell you like that, girl,&quot; Mario laughed.  &quot;It will give us a chance to show off your new wardrovbe too.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since gaining so much, Adam simply had to get new clothes that would hold all his blubber when going out in public.  Mario made sure all the fatboy&#39;s purchases had lots of give - so there were plenty of pink sweats for him to wear.  In fact, pink was the theme, that and pigs.  Adam&#39;s favorite t-shirt he had outgrown a week ago, but still wore sometimes.  It was a pink shirt with a triangle, and it declared to the world in big, proud letters, &quot;I LOVE BIG DICKS - I CAN&#39;T GET ENUFF OF THEM!&quot;  Of course now when he wore it, it looked more like a bra, barely containing his moobs and not even pretending to begin to cover his big pregnant looking belly.  Of course Mario also made sure that any clothes were too short, since Adam was growing - or rather shrinking (in hieght only, naturally) - to fit into them.  He was 5&#39;5 now and it felt so good to him to be looking further and further up to his muscular, caremel skinned boyfriend.  Where Mario was trim and fit, v-shaped back, and classically attractive, handsome and manly, Adam was increasingly feminine, fat, and hairy everywhere except his head (other than the goatee), his armpits, and his gunt.  His back and shoulders was as hairy as an animal, and he loved how it made him feel like one... yet at the same time he loved how the humiliating smoothness of his armpits, gunt and top of his head made him feel even more feminine inside.  Even his voice had changed without any magic, and become soft and feminine; it made people assume he was gay and the &quot;girl&quot; of the relationship.<br />
<br />
Adam saw his favorite t-shirt laying on the floor, pink with the red lettering.  It looked so small, like all of his clothes now.  And he looked so big, so very very huge.  His fat jiggled around him, as Mario grabbed a handfull of moob and a handfull of love handle, sending Adam into a fit of happy squeals as he realized it was true.  He did love big dicks now.  And he couldn&#39;t get enough of them.</p>
