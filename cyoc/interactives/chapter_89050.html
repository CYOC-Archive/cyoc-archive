<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Di walked through the front door of her family&#39;s home, back from her walk.  She still enjoyed the clicking of her high heels on the hard floor.  She saw Mark in the living room watching a ball game, and June was in the kitchen cooking dinner.  Dustin was nowhere to be seen; he was probably playing video games in his room.  Di considered changing her family again, but decided against it, for now.  They had some slow changes coming through this week that Di wanted to play out.<br />
<br />
Di headed to her bedroom.  She thought about her power and she realized that she had somehow gotten better at using it.  She no longer had to use the phrase &quot;I wish.&quot;  When she wanted to use her power somehow it just happened.  Perhaps it was the tone in which she made commands, or maybe it was something more subtle.  Either way, their was no doubt that Di&#39;s abilities had become just a little better.<br />
<br />
Di was an economics student, so she had homework to do.  Di got down to it and worked for a few hours.  True to her wish, Di found she was highly intelligent and had little trouble getting her homework done.  After that she had an uneventful meal with her family.  They were all silent as they ate, none suspecting what was to come in the week.<br />
<br />
After eating, Di went into the living room to watch a little TV.  Her family joined her one by one.  The evening news was on.  Di decided to see if there was any limit to the distance that her power could be used.  She made a few commands.<br />
<br />
&quot;My family will not notice when I make commands with my power.  The news anchorwoman I am watching will remove all of the clothing on her upper body until she is completely exposed, people will notice this but no one will be alarmed or take offense.&quot;<br />
<br />
The anchorwoman, a relatively pretty, midwestern-looking brunette, immediately undid the buttons on her business vest and slid it back off of her arms.  She pulled her blouse up over her head, then she reached behind her back and unclasped her bra, pulling it free.  She dropped her clothes to the floor.  At no point did she stop her report, and nobody seemed alarmed or upset as she did this.  Her breasts were round and shapely, about a B-cup, and perky.  Di was astounded that her power was able to affect the woman from so far away.  She decided to try some more changes.<br />
<br />
&quot;It is normal for this woman to be topless.  She will throw all clothing for her upper body away.  She will still wear clothing on her lower body as normal.  It is normal for news anchorwomen to prefer toplessness, and no one will think there is anything wrong with this.  Not all news anchorwomen will be topless; it will just be normal and accepted.  These women will suffer no ill health effects from not wearing a top.  They will be immune to sunburns, and will be able to tolerate cold weather with no problems.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di changed the channel to some other news stations.  In about half of them, the anchorwoman was wearing nothing on her upper body, breasts completely exposed.  Di turned to Dustin.  &quot;Did you see that?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;See what?&quot; said Dustin.<br />
<br />
&quot;That lady had no top on,&quot; Di told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what?  Her tits were nice if that&#39;s what you mean,&quot; Dustin replied.<br />
<br />
Well that pretty much settled it.  Her power really was that powerful.  As the show went on, Di decided to try a few other things.  Di saw the weather was coming on next, and made some changes during the commercial break.<br />
<br />
&quot;Male weathermen will take on female names while reporting the weather.  They will use their normal names at all other times, but when giving a weather report they will use and be referred to with a female name.  They will often use a slutty last name as well, but not always.  It will also be normal for a female anchorwoman to fuck the weatherman in the ass with a strap-on as he gives his report.  No one will find this unusual, and will consider it to just be part of the job.  This will happen on every news station when a male weatherman gives a report.&quot;<br />
<br />
Just then, the commercial break ended.  The anchorwoman began, &quot;Welcome back.  I&#39;m Lola Harding, and now we have the weather, presented by Danielle Lovesnatch.  Danielle?&quot;<br />
<br />
The camera changed to show &quot;Danielle&quot; in front of a weather map.  &quot;Danielle&quot; was a tall, lanky man with sandy hair.  &quot;Thank you, Lola.  As you can see we have a warm front coming in from the east...&quot;  As he talked he undid his belt and dropped his pants and boxer-briefs to the floor.  Lola, still topless walked into view, wearing only a strap-on.  &quot;Danielle&quot; turned to the side and bent over a little bit, still giving his report.  &quot;Because of this cloud system over here we will see a slight chance of rain as we move into the week...&quot;  &quot;Danielle&quot; grunted as Lola penetrated his ass with the strap-on.  Lola fucked him vigorously as he gave his report.  Di could hardly believe her eyes.<br />
<br />
Di was interrupted from her thoughts.  &quot;I still can&#39;t believe they allow that gay shit on TV!&quot; said Mark from his spot on the couch.  Taken aback, Di realized that Mark would of course still be against anything alternatively sexual, just as he always had.  Just because it was normal didn&#39;t mean that he would like it.<br />
<br />
Di was about to say something when June intervened.  &quot;Dear, you know that in order for men to talk about meteorology in depth they need to have their rectums stimulated.  There&#39;s a disconnect in the male brain that makes it so they can only give words to that knowledge while being fucked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, well, they should figure out another way,&quot; complained Mark.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have already tried vibrating butt plugs, but they aren&#39;t strong enough.  The rectum needs a really good pounding in order for them to get over their disability,&quot; June explained.<br />
<br />
Di gawked.  The universe had rewritten male biology to accommodate the use of her power.  She sat there, stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;You looking to catch flies, there, Di?&quot; remarked Dustin.<br />
<br />
Di shut her mouth and resumed watching TV.  &quot;And that concludes the weather.  *huff, huff, grunt* I&#39;m Danielle Lovesnatch, and have a nice evening.  Lola?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lola withdrew the strap-on from the weatherman&#39;s ass.  &quot;We&#39;ll be right back after the break.&quot;<br />
<br />
Di decided that was enough changes in the newsroom for one day, and watched TV on into the night with her family for a while before heading up to bed.  She got a thrill as she dressed for bed, putting on a sexy, see-through, pink, silk nighty and some super-comfy turquoise hip-hugging panties.  She laid down in her feminine bed, surrounded by soft pink covers.  Before going to sleep, Di made another wish.  She had been becoming increasingly worried, as she discovered the awesome power she had.  &quot;I wish that I will remain safe from harm, and that no one will try to hurt or kill me.  I wish that no matter what I do with my power, that I will be able to change things back to the way they were.  I wish that I will never go past a point of no return where I&#39;ve changed things irreparably.&quot;  Feeling a bit safer having made those wishes, Di drifted off to sleep.</p>
