<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad blissfully followed the bag of oats, as Spencer carried the bag up the ramp and into the animal trailer. Spencer hung the bag on the inside wall of the trailer, and Chad buried her snout in it. Then he locked the trailer, folded up the ramp, and patrolled the field house to remove any evidence.<br />
<br />
He collected Chad&#39;s gear, and grinned when he discovered Chad had turned his phone to video mode and propped it against his shoes to record his rendezvous with his secret admirer. Spencer watched the video twice before emailing it to his phone.  Spencer had his own hidden cameras to collect, but Chad&#39;s recording provided an upclose ground perspective of Chad&#39;s transformation and milking. Besides it began with Chad&#39;s breathless whisper excitedly describing meeting his secret admirer, and doing it like farm animals. <br />
<br />
Spencer stowed his equipment, Chad&#39;s phone, and clothing in a large cardboard box, which he stowed in the front passenger seat of his pickup truck. Then he drove back to the farm.<br />
<br />
Chad was mooing and stomping around the trailer by the time Spencer got home. Spring Break wasn&#39;t a vacation for Spencer, but it was for his parents. The next ten days Spencer would run the dairy farm, while his folks spent the long week on Maui. It was just as Spencer planned. No prying eyes to watch a 200 lb cow grow to an 800 pound one in a few days.<br />
<br />
He opened the trailer door, and led Chad out of the trailer and into a barn stall with a fresh bag of oats. Chad chomped away contentedly on his bags of oats. Spencer made his rounds locking down the farm. He led the prize bull Ferdinand the Tenth in from the fenced pasture. The other cows were all in their stalls by now.  Ferdinand stopped, snorted and sniffed as he was led by Chad&#39;s stall.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Ferdy, that&#39;s Chad. You remember the farmhand from last summer, who thought he was a cowboy? Well, now he really is a cow-boy,&quot; snickered Spencer. Chad continued to chow down on her oats. Spencer continued, &quot;He&#39;s still, uh, growing into his new body. But you&#39;ll get to mount her in a couple days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ferdinand X snorted happily, the tip of his cock emerged glistening with precum from its sheath. He led Spencer into the breeding stall instead of going into his own nearby stall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Ferdy, she&#39;s too small for you now, but in a day or two,&quot; Spencer said. The bull walked out of the breeding stall and back by Chad&#39;s stall. He lowed softly at the former farmhand and former quarterback.  He remembered Chad from last year.  The idiot had spilled pheromone on himself,  and Ferdinand X had done what came naturally,  and tried to mount Chad. Of course, Spencer&#39;s dad intervened, and Chad got cleaned up. But Ferdinand X had smelled Chad&#39;s scent, and tried to mount him again and again even without the pheromones.  In Ferdinand&#39;s bovine mind Chad scent and cow scent were now the same. Spencer had gotten a kick out of watching Chad avoiding the 1200 lb bull&#39;s amorous attentions. It was then he decided to make Chad his 4H project. The Husbandry H, and he could also use the project for his Eagle Scout badge. Best of all no one would know his breeder dairy cow was really the former stud quarterback. <br />
<br />
Spencer locked Ferdinand&#39;s stall, shut off the lights and headed back to the house. There was a message on his phone. It was his parents checking in.<br />
<br />
He phoned his parents back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, sorry, left my phone in the charger, while I was putting Ferdy in his stall,&quot; he explained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you should always keep your phone with you in case something happens, Spence,&quot; advised his father, &quot;But Ferdy should&#39;ve been in his stall a half hour ago. Any problems, son?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Naw, pa, Ferdy was just a bit horny.  He lingered by a cow&#39;s stall, then insisted on going into the breeding stall. It took maybe 10 minutes longer than usual, and I was hungry,  so had a bite before checking the phone. I wasn&#39;t expecting you to call this soon. Shouldn&#39;t you be flying over the Pacific now?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Flight delayed. Glad everything&#39;s going smoothly. They&#39;re boarding our plane now, so I gotta go. Keep your phone with you, Spencer. Luvya, bye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Click.<br />
<br />
Spencer smiled.<br />
<br />
He slept soundly, and got up with the chickens. He milked all the cows using the milking machines. Stowed the milk, unhooked the machines. Then, he logged the production figures. He got Ferdinand X and led the bull and cows out into the pasture. As he headed back toward the barn, he heard Chad mooing loudly.<br />
<br />
As he looked into her stall, he whistled. Chad had grown to at least 500 or 600 lbs overnight, and he swollen udder was so big teats were touching the straw.<br />
<br />
Hurriedly, Spencer grabbed a half dozen pails and a stool. He quickly set to work milking Chad, and Chad resumed chomping on the last bag of grain in the stall. Spencer filled filled one milk can with ten buckets from Chad, and filled six more buckets before Chad was tapped out. Spencer doubted that Chad would produce more than 2/3rds of a milk can or 6-7 gallons a day once her transformation was complete, but he could hope.<br />
<br />
He got two more hundred pound bags of oats, and put them in the stall for Chad. He examined the straw for cow patties,  and was happy to see none. Every ounce of feed was being converted into beef. He would know the transformation was complete,  when the cow started leaving excrement.<br />
<br />
Spencer went about his daily chores. Checking everything off his father&#39;s checklist.  He was eating lunch, when his parents phoned. He picked up on the first ring.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aloha!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Spence, I know we agreed that you would run the farm by yourself because Spring Break is early this year, and the calving won&#39;t start for another month, but I&#39;ve been thinking maybe you should have some help. I called that hand we had last summer from your school and left a message for him to call you. Um, Chad something. Only had Chad stored in my phone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer took a deep breath, then said, &quot;I think I can handle it. But if Chad calls me, I may have him come over to help out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If? May?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Spring Break- Chad may have other plans.  Maybe he&#39;ll call? I think I heard he was going to bulk up,&quot; Spencer said. He always had trouble lying to his parents. <br />
<br />
&quot;Bulk up? He was pretty beefy when he worked on the farm last summer,&quot; Spencer&#39;s father replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beefy?&quot; whispered Spencer to himself. He giggled silently.<br />
<br />
After a long pause, his father  said, &quot;Spence, you still there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Must be the connection. Uh, Chad used to wrestle when he was 17 in the 80 kg (176 <br />
lb) class, but now that he&#39;s over 18, he&#39;s beefing up for a new heavier weight class.&quot; Spencer suppressed a guffaw as he thought of cow-boy Chad in a wrestling singlet with his- er her udder filling out his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Spence, do what you have to. If Chad is a no go- feel free to hire a hand you trust to help. Don&#39;t want you to burn yourself out doing all the work yourself. I&#39;ll trust your judgment.  Oh, the tour bus just pulled up. Your mother wants to talk to you.&quot;<br />
 <br />
&quot;Spency, are you eating right?&quot; his mother asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ma, I&#39;m eating fine. Had eggs and bacon and OJ for breakfast. And I&#39;m gonna have your meatloaf for dinner.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, you call your buddy Chad to come out to help you around the farm. You can put him up in guest room.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer clenched his mouth shut as he imagined the cow Chad was becoming in the guest room bed. He gasped as he suppressed his laugh, and said, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll check with Chad.  He did have a certain way with Achilles, bet that bull will be happy to have Chad around.&quot; He smirked.<br />
<br />
His mother could hear the smirk in Spencer&#39;s voice, and frowned. She said, &quot;You know if you get Chad or someone else to help with the chores, so you can work on your Husbandry badge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right I know Chad could help me with my 4H Project and Eagle Scout badge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon honey!&quot; Spencer heard his father shout,&quot;bus is waiting.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I have to go, Spencey, now you take care of yourself.  We&#39;ll call you next week. Love ya!&quot;</p>
