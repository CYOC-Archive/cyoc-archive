<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">July 3rd. The sun is rising, and Jeff is still standing on all fours in the backyard of his human childhood home. The last day he would ever see or stand on this property ever again. His parents would come home and find a random smelly old hysterical donkey in their yard!<br />
<br />
He slowly awoke from his slumber. With eyes bleary, he yawned *Big breath in,* big H *HHHAAAWWWW&quot; out. At the same time, he went to use his right arm to rub at his eyes, for the world was all bleary and dark. As he attempts to raise his arm, his front right leg quickly, almost instinctively, shot back down as he started to tip over.<br />
<br />
Confused, he rapidly blinks away the sleepiness from his large brown eyes; formerly a beautiful emerald green. To Jeff, the world looked....strange. I was all depleted of color, and he couldn&#39;t see much beyond 5 or 6 feet away. Most everything else were just vague shapes of blurriness. Donkeys don&#39;t have great eyesight to begin with, but Jeff now has the particularly poor eyesight of an unhealthy, overweight, middle-aged donkey. Not the sharp, perfect color-filled eyesight of a healthy young teenage boy who enjoys playing baseball, and is great at it. Even if a vet (yup, a veterinarian, not a doctor! For he would only be suited to see a vet. Only human beings see doctors.) knew about his poor eyesight, in their estimation, he&#39;s &quot;just a donkey,&quot; and donkeys do not wear any sort prescription lenses. They have no need for good eyesight, particularly if they are domesticated, like Jeff would shortly find himself being. That is, IF a vet knew to what degree his eyesight is poor. For he would be unable to express it in any sort of meaningful fashion to a human brain not his own.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, he is perfectly confused. He had the strangest dream of turning himself into a donkey. Becoming his old human self again. Then finding himself back into the body of a smelly old donkey a second time!<br />
<br />
Thinking such a dream was silly and excited to greet his parents when they would get home later that day, Jeff shakes his head and....he&#39;s already upright and standing! He didn&#39;t need to get out of bed. He wasn&#39;t even IN bed. And he was already standing, but it was wrong. It was all wrong somehow!<br />
<br />
Confused as ever, he let out an inquisitive &quot;hhhhaaawwww?&quot; <br />
<br />
That didn&#39;t come out right, he breathed deeply back in with his enlarged nostril with an entire spectrum of scents dominated by fresh grass and early morning dew, and tried again:<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghhh hhhhaawww&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly becoming more aware, he tried a third time:<br />
<br />
&quot;Errrgghh hhaawww&quot;<br />
<br />
And a fourth:<br />
<br />
Eeerrggghh hhhaaww&quot;<br />
<br />
With dawning realization of his inability to form human words, his level of awareness of his situation heightens. His brain still somewhat in denial, thinking he&#39;s still a boy. He still has to be a boy! But all that hits is enlarged donkey ears, are the deep-throated, horridly harsh-sounding braying of a donkey in distress:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Eeerrggghh HHHAAWWW EEERRRGGHHH HHHAAWWW EEERRRGGHHH hhhhaaww!&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks to his right, focusing mostly his right eyeball in that direction, he sees the unmistakable dark shadowy shape of a 750 lb donkey leading away from his legs and stretched out on the ground in his yard, ending in a vague tall and broad ear-shape. The rising sun to his left. <br />
<br />
&quot;EEERRGGHH hhhhhaaww EERRRGGHH HHHAAWW.&quot; He continues to announce to his neighbors that a donkey is waking up for the day in a very strange location in the suburbs; rather than on a farm where such creatures belong.<br />
<br />
Continuing to bray, uselessly trying to speak, he turns his long, gray-furred, mowhawk-shaped hairy neck further to his right, and is met with the bulging side and raised rump of the body of a donkey trailing behind himself into a dark, roughly rounded shape. He sees a piece of a tail as it flicks involuntarily back and forth in growing agitation. <br />
<br />
He tries to get a better look at what is apparently his new body he will be forever inhabiting from now on, and his back legs are forced to take a step to the left, slightly turning his upper body away from the rising sun. <br />
<br />
He tries to clear his mind by shutting up and closing his eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! This isn&#39;t happening! This didn&#39;t happen!&quot; But alas, his photographic memory he gave of himself from that video and those photos, betrayed him. As he stood there eyes closed, he saw what his body looks like again, for the second time. What others would see. He also &quot;felt&quot; his thick heavy hooves on the ground, holding him up properly for the species he has decided to join the evening before. He particularly &quot;felt&quot; his front hooves, in place of his hands. The feeling of his hands and fingers being &quot;trapped&quot; never going away. Ever. Always struggling with the desire to have them back and grasp onto something. Anything. Instead of being stuck like this with that nagging, frustrating feeling for a day, he will experience it with every waking moment of his life! <br />
<br />
His tongue was large and swollen. It was dry and cottony. And sour. His unbrushed teeth were full of disgusting plaque from inside the mouth of a donkey. Gingivitis has set in, making his breath more sour and disgusting.<br />
<br />
In disgust, he opens his mouth and tries to deny what he will forever have stuck in his mouth, and will always be swallowing. It&#39;s now HIS mouth, and he cannot ever brush his own teeth, no matter how much he wanted. Never having the perfect, straight white, clean pearls he had as a boy. He bites and chomps at the air as he I sickened by how unearthly god awful it would be to actually &quot;lick&quot; and &quot;taste&quot; the dirty inside mouth of a dirty creature. To swallow and consume it&#39;s thick, vile saliva. But he&#39;s stuck doing just that, 24/7 for years and years.<br />
<br />
Still chomping at the air in his futile attempt to escape such a bacteria-filled mouth, his mind then wanders to his penis. His penis! All along, these thoughts were making him horny! In his minds-eye, he saw his own large wobbly black balls hanging below his black puckered anus only covered up by a tail, and hanging between his legs like a proper virile male donkey&#39;s equipment should.<br />
<br />
He &quot;felt&quot; the donkey seed beginning to churn as it tingles the insides of those large black wobbly balls. He &quot;saw&quot; what that sperm was, and what it looked like. Completely unsuitable for getting any human female pregnant, ever again. Only meant for a natural-born Jenny donkey of his species. Him, his body producing such a horrendous sticky substance.<br />
<br />
All of these thoughts overwhelming his brain and the images in such great detail inside his head, his penis begins to push itself longer. And longer. And longer still! It becomes ram-rod straight as it starts bouncing up and down, slapping his large, round, barrel-shaped, white-furred underbelly. Reaching nearly to the base of his neck that is only suited for making the sounds only a donkey is truly capable of making. And making those particular sounds only, and no others!<br />
<br />
&quot;Eerrrgghh hhhaaww!&quot;</p>
