<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The first thing he noticed was his shifted eyesight. He had a far wider but also less three-dimensional vision. He was also obviously on all fours and walking felt strange, more like waddling movements. Then the voice was back in his head: &quot;Hmhmhm, what have we got here? Do you already know what you are?&quot; When Jeff made an attempt to answer and scream out his frustration he heard only grunts and squeals. &quot;Ah yes, that was a trick question, really. Now you know, hm, my little fat piggy?&quot; Jeff was out of his mind. This dickhead had turned him into a pig, a fucking, stinking pig. What was to come next, he wondered, but the answer was not far away. &quot;Yes, piggy, don&#39;t complain yet. Because I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not done yet. You know, Jeff, if I may call you by that name for a last time before we settle for &#39;piggy&#39;, this ain&#39;t no fun. I want to see you at your lowest. A fat, ugly pig. Nothing more. I&#39;m sure you wonder who I am. Maybe you&#39;ll find out some day.&quot; Jeff certainly did wonder who that was and if he really meant what he said. The voice meant nothing to him. It was one of those timeless male voices you find on commercials and the like where they are meant to inspire trust and confidence. To Jeff, the self-assured, strong and calm voice only increased his anxiousness. But who had a reason to seek such vengeance on him? And who had the means to break into the Chroniac? But before he could take that thought any further, the voice was back. &quot;First thing is, I&#39;m afraid I cannot cope with the thought that you could be a healthy breeding boar fucking sows on end. No, I want you to be a fat stinking meat pig. So I&#39;m afraid your balls have to go. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll not cut them off. Just a few klicks ...&quot;, the voice trailed off &quot;...and they are ... gone!&quot; Indeed, Jeff felt something odd happen at tha back of his body, he felt the slight dangling weight that had presumably been his balls wither. &quot;So, now you&#39;re just a little hog. We also need to cut your tail, remove your tusks and clip your ears ... done! If you wonder why: Well, because this is what people do to pigs destined for the butcher. And this sure is what you are now, piggy.&quot; Jeff almost threw up. Was this lunatic suggesting he was turning him not only into a pig but into a meat pig. Was he really gonna let him die? &quot;Hm. But before we can think about all that we need to fatten you up a little I guess. So first we will put an ear tag on you.&quot; With that, Jeff felt his left ear weigehd down and could spot something yellow there from the corner of his eye. &quot;And now off to the sty with you. Oh, and don&#39;t imagine some Babe like cozy farm. I want the real thing for you, so you&#39;ll go to a real factory farm, my boy.&quot; Jeff just had time to realize that he had still been in his room before everything around him changed. He was now in a huge barn, full of compartments carmped with pigs of different weight. He was surrounded by metal bars, maybe twenty pigs around him, slatted concrete floor below him and a trough righ tin front. The other pigs in his box were all very young, maybe 25 kg. There was a convulsion of noise from the grunting pigs and giant fans shovelling in fresh air. This was absolutely necessary. The room had no windows, there was only neon light and it stank hilariously from all the pig manure just dropping through the slats in the flooring into a storage tank right below the pigs. &quot;Not exactly the Ritz, hm?&quot;, the voice observed. &quot;But it&#39;ll do, I&#39;m sure. Piggy, look around and you see your future. You&#39;re yet not much more than a little weaner. But in a few months you&#39;ll match those giant meaty hogs you see further at the back. But don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you alone. I&#39;ll drop in every once in a while to see how things are going for you. I wouldn&#39;t miss the fun, ay! For today I gotta get going though. So enjoy your first day as a hog and try the slop. I&#39;m sure it tastes great. To stir your appetite - the ingredients are mainly processed animal proteins - i.e. what&#39;s left over, wehn the likes of you are slaughetred one day, fish meal and carbon hydrates made from food gone bad. So you&#39;re basically eating everything humans did not want. Hope it tastes good! And one thing you can be certain of: It&#39;s the perfect mixture to turn you into a fat hog!&quot; With that the voice was of and Jeff alone. <br />
<br />
He was shocked and outraged at the same time. He was obviously at the mercy of a madman. And for now that meant being a pig in the worst abysses of factory farming. There was nothing he could do for the moment. But he would do all he could to regain control over the Chroniac. Suddenly, Jeff realized how hungry he was. For an instant he considered to supress it. Would he not feed himself to death? But then that was bullshit. He had to eat and he was sure the evil man would find ways to make him eat anyway if he would not do so on his own. So he moved to the trough and started to slurp away at the surprisingly liquid brownish slop. Despite what the voice had said about his contents, it tasted ok. It was sweet and mallory. The other pigs, meanwhile, took little notice of him. Once in a while they sniffed at him and there was some fighting in between but all in all it was ok. He also noticed that there was a mixture of female and male pigs but all male pigs had been castrated, just like him and all had had their tails cut off. They basically seemed to be eating, sleeping or shitting and peeing - the latter whereever they were just standing. Unlike Jeff, they seemed not too unhappy. But Jeff felt increasingly bored, even after only a few hours. There was virtually nothing he could do in this bare box. All there was was musing who the voice was and what he had done to deserve this. But as hard as he thought, he could not come up with anything. Indeed, he already missed the voice. At least it had meant some contrast to this boredom. When finally the lights went off, Jeff almost gratiously fell to sleep. <br />
<br />
The next morning he woke up from the lights being turned on and, for the first time since he had arrived yesterday, human voices. At the back he could see two men in farm overalls driving a group of large, to Jeff almost huge hogs out. All of them had purple marks sprayed on their backs and were now ushered to the barn gate using red plastic paddles. The pigs were unancustomed to such freedom outside their barn but the farmhands managed to get them moving. At the back, they arrived on a little platform that suddenly moved up and Jeff realized that there was a trailer waiting for the pigs and these were loaded onto the upper deck. When the elevator platform went up, Jeff could see that the trailer was already well filled with pigs, presumably from other barns or farms. When the elevator came to a stop, the pigs were moved into the trailer and the next group was taken on. All in all some twenty pigs were loaded and Jeff had little doubt where they were going to. Once loading was finished, the farmhands made a shor tour around the barn but then left. Jeff gulped when he thought of himself going on the trailer one day, but then there was little sense in panicking now and so he turned to the trough for some breakfast. The following days dragged on and Jeff increasingly hated the listless life of a meat pig. Then, when he had just taken a good slurp from the trough, the voice returned:</p>
