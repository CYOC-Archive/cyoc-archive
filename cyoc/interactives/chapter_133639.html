<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Kyle stood in front of that mirror for a long time, as he felt his body being pushed and pulled in all directions. He could see his skin turning a light brown, his face becoming rounder, and...wait, something was happening.<br />
<br />
He found himself at a table outside some cafe-type place, with a blue sky filled with clouds. Sitting in front of him was a tall, clean-cut white boy in a letterman jacket and jeans, one of his boots perched up on his leg. This person was unmistakeable to Kyle, because it was him.<br />
<br />
Specifically, it was him in his sophomore year of college. He was a student-athlete, a guy without much time on his hands for things that didn&#39;t involve training, competition, or studying. So how surprised he must have been when someone asked him out. <br />
<br />
That girl was named Sarah. She didn&#39;t really have much of the hots for Kyle, but she had a kind heart, and could see that he was struggling with the homework in their Philosophy class. So she asked him for a study session, which in his mind, sounded like a date.<br />
<br />
And in all fairness, could you blame him? Sarah was an attractive girl. It&#39;s worth mentioning here that she was a good few years older than him; he was about 20 and she was 23 or something along those lines. She had a side gig as one of the &quot;conditioners&quot; at the university&#39;s massive exercise center, so she was always in a state of 100% physical fitness. That&#39;s not even mentioning her most striking feature: her hair, which reminded Kyle of those big hairstyles he&#39;d seen on girls who appeared in old-time beauty contests. The hair was thick and piled on top of her head, filled with curls and fritz. <br />
<br />
And now he could hear someone talking. It was himself, babbling on and on about some concept he didn&#39;t understand. Kyle took this opportunity to look down at himself.<br />
<br />
He was wearing the same jacket, shirt, pants, and shoes as Sarah had on their date. And his hands were the same size as hers, with he same clipped nails. He reached up and ran a hand through his hair. Yup, same thickness and curliness as Sarah&#39;s.<br />
<br />
That proved it. That machine had turned him into Sarah! But why had it sent him back in time, to this day of all days?<br />
<br />
As the thoughts continued to race through my head, the other Kyle got some kind of smirk on his face. Suddenly, and without warning, he walked up and planted a kiss on my lips. <br />
<br />
I quickly pushed him off by instinct. But then he sat in such a way on my lap that his legs straddled me like a horse. &quot;You know you want some of this, Sarah.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was cheesy. It was pathetic. I felt perfectly justified punching him in the balls and walking away while he doubled over in pain.<br />
<br />
But instead, I grabbed him and stood up so that his legs were wrapped around my torso. I looked like a huge black Amazon carrying a sheep as I slowly ambled my way back to Sarah&#39;s apartment, continuing to smooch with Kyle as I tried to keep my focus on what was ahead of me.<br />
<br />
Eventually, we got to Sarah&#39;s place, and me and Kyle had, yes, sex. And believe me, having sex as a girl is truly mind-blowing for a guy who, truth be told, is still technically a virgin. First, I used my powerful, muscular thighs to trap Kyle&#39;s head between my legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;Start licking.&quot;<br />
<br />
And he did. I fell into ecstasy as he skillfully manipulated his tongue up and down the length of my pussy. Eventually, I couldn&#39;t take it any longer and orgasmed, releasing my vaginal juice onto his face.<br />
<br />
Then it was his turn. He threw himself on top of me and grabbed my boobs, rubbing his fingers on my nipples as his long cock penetrated my pussy. Then, he slid in and out, his penis getting fatter and fatter as it felt the warmth of my soft tissue.<br />
<br />
Then it happened. He climaxed. I could feel his sperm shooting up and into my body, settling in my womb. Kyle started to pull out, but I threw up my legs and pinned his body against mine.<br />
<br />
&quot;No. You&#39;re putting a baby in me tonight. Give me every last drop of your semen!!&quot;<br />
<br />
So we kept at it, until I felt his cock starting to deflate. He was empty. By then, white sperm was leaking out of the folds of my pussy.<br />
<br />
Kyle fell next to me and put his hand on my belly. &quot;So, you got any ideas for names?&quot;<br />
<br />
His words, though, fell on deaf ears. I was already thinking about what would happen next. I would be pregnant. I had never been pregnant, because I was a man. Now, I was going to have a human being grow inside me, until one day I would have to push it out of my vagina. Then, I would have to raise it with, well, myself. <br />
<br />
What a challenge this was going to be.</p>
