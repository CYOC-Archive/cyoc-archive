<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">[Note: Switching perspectives for sake of the aesthetics and character focus of this branch]<br />
<br />
In heading for the door, Nathan and Jordan realize that there *is* no door. Or rather, in the space where they intuitively assume there would be a door, (across the room from the bed), there is a tall stack of plasticy, square things; forming a wall that blocks where the door presumably is. Taking a closer look, they realize what they&#39;re looking at.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s weird, it&#39;s a bunch of packages of diapers.&quot; Jordan says, poking at them. &quot;Like the kind for old people.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan steps up. &quot;Welp, hope no one will mind if we knock over their neat little organized pile...&quot; he says, grabbing one of the packages at his arm-height and pulling it out from underneath the others.<br />
<br />
Miraculously, none of them fall over. There&#39;s now several packages of diapers *floating in mid air*.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... maybe they&#39;re glued to the wall.&quot; Nathan says, as both he and Jordan start trying to pry them off, but they won&#39;t budge at all.<br />
<br />
A minute later.<br />
&quot;What&#39;s odd is that NONE of the packages move at all, yet the only one that WASN&#39;T stuck just so happened to be the first one you grabbed.&quot; Jordan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I know, right? It&#39;s like they somehow knew which one I would grab. Or it&#39;s like they&#39;re all stuck to the wall magnetically or something, and they just didn&#39;t turn on the magnet until recently.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But it&#39;s not like these are made of metal; they feel just like any old package of diapers; it really just feels like they&#39;re magically not moving; like they supernaturally cancel out both gravity and force, and just don&#39;t care about the laws of physics.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I spose so.&quot; Nathan starts scratching a package, trying to see if he can rip it open. Jordan with her sharper nails joins in, but they don&#39;t make the slightest tear. Jordan locates a letter opener in the desk in the room and stabs it with all her strength; nothing. Not even a distortion of the plastic.<br />
<br />
&quot;So dumb. I guess we&#39;re trapped in here.&quot; Nathan says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, if the first package is able to be moved, maybe you can tear it open?&quot; She squats down, grabs it off the floor, stands up, and immediately tears a hole in it. &quot;Bingo!&quot; She pulls a diaper out of it. &quot;So this one will work.&quot; She tries to tear it open further, but it won&#39;t work.<br />
&quot;What the hell? I was ripping it just a second ago, but now it&#39;s as invincible as the rest...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm, let me see it.&quot; She hands it to Nathan, and he tries to pull at it. He reaches to pull out another diaper, and yet... the diapers now won&#39;t budge either.<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t grab the diapers inside. They&#39;re stuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the heck. Why couldn&#39;t the shit I bought at the store been as magical as this stuff?&quot; Jordan folds her arms.<br />
<br />
The two of them pace the room for a bit and mull this over. After a few minutes--with Nathan sitting on the edge of the bed frame, and Jordan sitting with her legs crossed on the thick, luscious carpet--Nathan presents the following:<br />
&quot;It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s some force that only wants us to do things one at a time. It lets us pull out a package, then makes the others unmovable. It lets you rip it open, but just wide enough to pull two diapers out of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. So how are we gonna get out of here, then?&quot; The two of them look over to see the windows are all barred with thick cast iron.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, speaking of diapers, I gotta go to the bathroom. Just a sec.&quot; Nathan says, going over to the bathroom, lifting the seat, and... missing. He winces, and manages to hold it back again. He focuses... and misses again. Wincing once more, he sits down on the toilet... and yet somehow, for some reason, he can&#39;t help but pointing upwards, out of the toilet, and onto the floor. Too worn out from starting and holding, Nathan sighs and lets the rest out onto the floor.<br />
<br />
He finds a mop, and after five minutes, and lightly showering his legs, he comes back out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did something happen?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, weirdly enough, it was like I was forced to keep missing the toilet. I even sat down, and yet I somehow pointed OUT of the bowl, and peed all over the floor. I spent the last few minutes cleaning everything up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan looks at his dick.<br />
&quot;...do you normally do anything like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I guess it was just some magical force, wanting me to keep the toilet clean, because I pissed everywhere EXCEPT the toilet practically.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; Jordan picks up one of the diapers. &quot;I guess this magical entity really really wants you to pee in a diaper, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess so. What is this entity&#39;s deal? Anyway, I&#39;d love to try that, but I&#39;m all pee&#39;d out. Do you have any pee in *your* bladder?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I could go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well get in there, and try it out, toots!&quot; Nathan says, pushing the back of her shoulder in the direction of the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Jordan shuts the door, sets the diaper on the counter, lifts the lid of the toilet, turns around, sits down... and fails.<br />
<br />
&quot;I heard a thump.&quot; Nathan says a few meters away from the other side of the door. &quot;Something go wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, in sitting down, I missed the toilet and fell on my ass!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So it looks like you have the same weirdness coming over you as I do. Try standing above it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; She shouts back, and fumbles to her knees. &quot;Welp, as soon as I try to stand over it, my legs gave out! I&#39;ll try peeing in the bathtub.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan squats over in the bathtub, she sighs and is about to let herself go, when suddenly her muscles twitch, and she sends herself flying out of the tub and onto the floor, pissing on the newly-mopped tiles, gritting her teeth to stop the flow.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you spontaneously jump out?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Guess you should try the diaper now--&quot;<br />
&quot;--YEAH.....&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan cleans up what she did for a second. Then she grabs the diaper, unfolds it onto the floor, squats above it, and lets herself go. Her legs give out; they twitch and squirm. She gasps, managing to hold back again once more.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t put the diaper on, I just sat it on the floor and tried to pee over it, but I kept missing and pretty much peed everywhere AROUND it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any pee left?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, it kinda hurts.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan mulls this over.<br />
&quot;...try putting the diaper on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Like, wearing it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, with the tapes and everything.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan sighs.<br />
&quot;Alright. I get what you&#39;re going for here.&quot; She places the diaper on the toilet lid, sits down onto it, attaches all four tapes around her waist, then immediately closes her eyes, and can&#39;t help but let out a somewhat loud sigh of relief as she voids the rest of her bladder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did it work?&quot;<br />
<br />
She looks down, sees the yellow stain, and squishes the warmth.<br />
&quot;Yeah... it&#39;s kind of gross.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, clean up and get out here. I want to show you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Quickly mopping up her accidents, and then removing, balling up, and throwing away her wet diaper, and showering everything below her waist, Jordan came out of the bathroom. Her legs glistening in the still-morning sun as she walked forward, Nathan showed her two diapers in his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Check it out. Right after you peed in your diaper, I was able to pull out another one from the package!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And only one?&quot; Jordan asks, reaching into the tear and finding them as invincible as usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;So whatever&#39;s going on, for one reason or another, whoever or whatever is putting us up to this, it looks like our objective is to pee in diapers.&quot; Nathan explains.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is that our &#39;objective&#39;?&quot; Jordan looks over at the pile, and then realizes that the empty space where Nathan took the package, that there is the edge of a door with a doorknob behind it. &quot;...oh... OH!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly!&quot; He hands one of the diapers to her. &quot;My assumption is that if we use up all these diapers, we&#39;ll be able to grab another package from the stack. Rinse, repeat, until eventually, we can open that door, and get of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;......&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;......&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;....well let&#39;s not waste any time then!&quot; Jordan gets up and looks on one of the dressers, and finds a mid-sized decorative glass cup. She goes over to the bathroom sink, fills it with water, and starts gulping it down.<br />
<br />
&quot;While you do that, I&#39;ll see if the magic weirdo guy forgot to magically fortify these bars...&quot; Nathan gets up, putting his foot against the wall, his hands against one of the bars, and pulling to his maximum strength. &quot;Nup, they&#39;re pretty strong.&quot; As Nathan is looking out the window, he notices there is an abundance of trees right up against the windows, and that, in fact, there are no glass panes in the window frames; it&#39;s just the bars. He then realizes that almost all these trees are yielding fruit.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Jordan, guess what? We have food over here on these trees.&quot; Nathan pulls a grapefruit out and brings it inside. &quot;The entity responsible for this really thought of everything.&quot; He peeled it open with his bare fingers and started munching down on it.<br />
<br />
Jordan finishes off the water, takes a second to breathe, and comes back up near the bed. &quot;Awesome, I kind of assumed something like that would happen.&quot; She hands him the cup. &quot;Now get drinking; I did three whole cup-fulls just now.&quot; She walks over to the diapers on the bed, unfolds one, sits down on it and tapes herself up in it, as Nathan heads to the sink and follows suit.<br />
<br />
Jordan, getting used to the feeling of the warm, plasticy but also cloth-like crinkliness between her legs that feels like wearing 10 pairs of underwear on top of each other, walks over to the windows and grabs a pear, and starts eating it. She looks out past the trees, but it&#39;s hard as there&#39;s only a few slight openings; and all she can make out is what looks like hilly green slopes of grass, maybe a river, maybe a pathway.<br />
<br />
Nathan comes back to the bed, puts on the other diaper, and joins Jordan in gazing out the window.<br />
<br />
<br />
After 20 minutes, Jordan finds herself able to pee again. She sits on the bed and closes her eyes, while Nathan absentmindedly watches. Jordan lets out a breath as her diaper fills up and a wet spot climbs upwards. Nathan reaches into the package, and pulls another diaper out.<br />
&quot;Excellent. We&#39;ve gotten started.&quot; He throws the diaper onto her lap. &quot;Go change.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jordan takes it.<br />
&quot;Yes sir.&quot; She answers playfully, heading to the bathroom, shutting the door, and reaching for the tapes of her diaper. Oddly enough, she can&#39;t get a grip on them.<br />
<br />
She heads back out into the room.<br />
&quot;So guess what? I can&#39;t open the diaper.&quot; She tries again. &quot;See? My fingers just fail to grab them every time. Did we do something wrong?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan scratches his chin.<br />
&quot;Huummmmm...&quot; He hands her the letter opener. &quot;Try tearing it open.&quot;<br />
<br />
She tries to make an incision, but once again her hand causes her to somehow miss every single time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... I have a somewhat weird idea.&quot; Says Nathan.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Let *me* try to open your diaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;...you think that&#39;ll work? I guess try it...&quot; She folds her hands behind her back.<br />
<br />
Nathan steps up and reaches forward, grabs a tape, and effortlessly rips it off.<br />
<br />
Jordan sighs, still unable to undo any tapes of her own.<br />
&quot;...huzzah...&quot;<br />
<br />
Nathan cracks his knuckles.<br />
&quot;You hold onto it, while I undo the rest. I&#39;ll look up at the ceili--oh yeah, I&#39;ve been seeing you naked this whole time anyway. Never mind.&quot; Nathan immediately undoes the rest of the tapes, and Jordan gets a hold of it.<br />
<br />
What Jordan finds, going into the bathroom, is that she can&#39;t even clean herself off now. She can&#39;t wet a rag, let alone wipe herself with it, she can&#39;t even get into the bathtub. She looks under the sink, and actually finds disposable wipes. But, she can&#39;t even open a package.<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess I&#39;m supposed to clean you up.&quot; Nathan tells her; Jordan not even having bothered to shut the door this time.<br />
<br />
Jordan barely has any breath left with which to sigh.<br />
&quot;Figures. I assume that, when I wet that first one, I was able to get out of it because I wasn&#39;t intending to wear another one. But now that I&#39;m going into it with the expectation of &#39;a diaper change&#39;, it somehow makes me incapable of performing it myself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh I guess so, that&#39;s some pretty good deduction there!&quot; Nathan says, grabbing the wipes and setting them up with the fresh diaper on the bathroom floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Jordan jokingly snears in response. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re looking forward to when I presumably will be doing this to you pretty soon.&quot; She says, laying down on the floor, keeping her hair in order as she does so, and spreading her legs.<br />
<br />
Nathan takes a wipe and briskly slides it down, then up her crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;...is that it?&quot; Jordan asks, looking up at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;...yeah?&quot; Nathan tilts his head.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that; I don&#39;t want to get an infection.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright...&quot; Nathan takes another wipe and just looks at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;...&quot; Jordan taps her fingers. &quot;Under and around the corners of the labia.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Wipe there?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes; wipe inside the edges of the labia. Do I have to point to it? Because I&#39;m not sure if my hand will let me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh-h, nope I&#39;m good!&quot; Nathan shakes his head, reaching in with the wipe and applying it as Jordan instructed.<br />
<br />
Jordan manages to not make any noise and remain mostly stoic as she does this, then taking another to her bottom, then around her legs. After a brief--and predictably failed--test to see if she could put the next diaper on herself, Nathan straightens her up, tapes her into her new diaper, then helps her to her feet, and washes his hands.</p>
