<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Extractor met Chris in her office. <br />
<br />
Today he was Megan. Wearing her hair down and purple yoga pants and long sleeve top with today he was wearing bra. Modest but still sexy, Chris interpreted this correctly: bad news. <br />
<br />
They were seated in his office Chris asked if he had taken Megan for a run. <br />
<br />
&quot;As discussed she need to be regularly serviced as if Megan gets fat then my display isn&#39;t so sexy and defeats the purpose. In your case Katya has since moved back to Kiev as Putin died and Ukraine is no longer occupied by the Red Army. She, and I did warn you of this last time, was pursuing a career in modelling.  She has become a Victoria Secret&#39;s model, this will not work for you or me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t get to be a Slavic girl with porcline white skin, brown hair and medium breasts?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No your DNA also had issues with Katya bonding, the stimulation showed only a 95% compatibility. It needs to be at least 99% for the transformations to work. Megan and I are 99.9% compatible, to get to her I had to go through about a dozen options.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So you are going to turn me into an official&#39;s daughter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan giggled, breasts jiggling inside her top. Her face screwed up in a broad grin exposing her white teeth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Megan is a quirky item at times. I don&#39;t do children and not for the reasons you think, children have advantages such as stealth and with everyone looking for pedophiles people will look the other way. However a child will be stopped by an adult or law enforcement words like &quot;where is your mommy little so and so?&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Swedish girl?&quot; Chris asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have also had problems with the Swedish girl, she recently had a visually distinguishing mark (VDM) which can be a scar, one promising Megan lost an arm during an auto wreck. This game is very much about not only being ahead of the curve but being the curve. Our Swedish girl went on Facebook with an very long and intricate tattoo of something that covers one buttock, perhaps even to her asshole, and down the length of her thigh.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t mind tats.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is very hard to replicate and tattoo artists, not that I consider it art, are artists. Their work is unique and is usually copy righted, no artist will outright copy it and even working from a sketch software can tell a fraud from the real one. Forget about the Swede, she is off the table.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know that we have a new British ambassador in Washington? No, good. Ambassadors sent to third world countries are usually rewarded for being an expert in the language and culture of their State Department. The ambassador in friendly or close countries is usually a political reward. At No 10 Downing Street there is a new openly gay Prime Minister who has sacked the last ambassador and replaced him with a new woman who is married.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SO!&quot; Chris shouted.<br />
<br />
&quot;The marriage is a sham, she is actually a lesbian herself and she has several girlfriends living in the US on the British taxpayer&#39;s penny. Sarah is one.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Extractor reached down for a file, Chris&#39; penis swelled as he looked at the perfect breasts hanging inside the shirt. Was Megan making him transsexual or something?<br />
<br />
The folder included blowups of a model wearing a tight grey tank top and black panties, black bikini, a white bra and panties and corset with black panties. Also photos of her at the tennis with a man. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sarah, ex military did a nude photo shoot for one of their tabloids in London and it got her kicked out of the army. Minor tv actress, appeared in one or two movies. No your correct those breasts aren&#39;t real. She is five foot seven, average build, average dress size black hair, blue eyes. Only thing exotic about her is she has Indian DNA hence her black hair. 32D chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Age?&quot;<br />
<br />
 &quot;Same as her bra size, I would add she is younger than you if you wish to use that line of attack. I also ran a simulation, 99.9% match. She is your genetic female self.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not turn me into a woman, a female version of myself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because it is the same DNA, we want complete transformation. Now you have seen Sarah Smith&#39;s body, no tattoos, no large social media profile, she has diplomatic immunity.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sarah Smith looked like a slutty version of Snow White. He could almost imagine her done up as Snow White in some stripper outfit or for Halloween. <br />
<br />
Chris agreed he needed to leave the country, the Extractor explained that he would have to spend a week in a private hospital as the DNA of y chromosome was extracted, changed and replaced with that of Sarah Smith. For a trigger he chose Wagner Ride Of The Valkyries. Which would be played constantly as he was turned into Sarah Smith. Once the Extractor had done his work the transformation would done in minutes. <br />
<br />
Chris was booked into a private hospital claiming that he had a highly contagious flu. Instead he was strapped into a bed where Megan was a nurse, although heavily toned down. Hair up in a bun, bust reducing bra and a stern set of scrubs with no makeup. &quot;I am here to inform you that I am the tip of the iceberg, some people know what is going here, others know nothing. When you are Sarah I will come back after a week to help you go clothes shopping.&quot;<br />
<br />
He was hooked up an IV bag with a fluid that looked like water but it had a bluish hue to it. <br />
<br />
Day 1<br />
<br />
Strapped to the bed he noticed gradual changes his skin became less hairy, while his chest softened and the beginning of breasts seemed to form on his chest. By the end of day one he was told that his muscle mass and bone density was weakening, this was to be expected.<br />
<br />
Day 2<br />
<br />
He was having a hard time getting an erection as his penis shrunk and his hair lengthened growing darker from his light blond to black. The hairs on his arms, which were looking very thin, became small and almost translucent.   <br />
<br />
Day 3<br />
<br />
He could feel it coming in, each time they replaced a bag of the bluish stuff. His breasts were small, like going through puberty again but this time as a woman. His nipples were chaffing against the hospital gown. He still had a dick but it was operating at a level before he started growing pubic hair.<br />
<br />
Day 4<br />
<br />
They ran a test, they played a series of pornographic in front of him to see if he got an erection, not even a stirring, his penis was official non-operational. He started to loose height as he came down from six feet to whatever Sarah Smith was five foot something. She had more room inside the bed.<br />
<br />
Day 5<br />
<br />
Her penis was gone, it had fallen off like it had died off due to lack of blood pressure, one of the nurses found it and showed Chris. The area felt as smooth in between as if she were a Barbie doll. Her scalp was itching as the scalp her hair, black as midnight started to grow around her ears. Her chest was now an A-Cup, she ran her upper arms across sensitive nipples and growing glands.<br />
<br />
Day 6<br />
<br />
Over night she was a B Cup, the nurse told her that she was growing much more. At the same time her chest had become so large that she could no longer sleep on her stomach. Her stomach was hurting forcing her into a fetal  position as her insides felt like they were being torn apart. She cried at times, either due to the pain or just plain old cried. Then at the end of day 6 she had a fully formed vagina.<br />
<br />
Day 7<br />
<br />
Her genitals gender appropriate her hips cracked into position so that she could give birth. Her hair was at least down to her back. She saw in a mirror that she was Sarah in her photo shoots, just messed out both mentally and psychically. They told her that she would get used to her body. She jiggled in places that she never knew or thought about.  Her breasts were now at D cup that pushed up, combined with her bubble but she felt more streamlined and sexier than she had as a man.<br />
<br />
Penises were ugly a voice said in her head, what an ugly appendage to have. &quot;I am not letting one of those guys stick their penis inside me, why would a girl do that?&quot; Sarah thought.<br />
<br />
Megan came to visit at the end of day seven.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girl you&#39;ll be a woman soon.&quot;</p>
