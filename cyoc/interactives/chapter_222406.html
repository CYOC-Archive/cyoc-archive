<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Greg left the radio on as he drove. He and Jeff talked. In some ways, Jeff was still the same old Jeff but there were some plain differences. For one thing, Jeff admitted how much he enjoyed being a jeep.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yea, Greg, every time you start my engine, you really know how to turn me on. I know the new programming programmed me to say that but it&#39;s true. I love feeling your hand on my cock when you shift my gears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg never thought about his brother this way before but Greg felt a little turned on himself. He turned the radio off because he didn&#39;t want to be distracted while driving anymore and he adjusted his cock in his own pants. Then he went about the errands he had planned that morning.<br />
<br />
Greg changed his mind about having his brother at his birthday party. Greg decided that he should go ahead and have both Jeff and Jeep at the party and let his friends know about the secret.<br />
<br />
The party started at noon at Danny&#39;s house. Danny had a large enough house and a pool. Greg pulled up in front of Danny&#39;s house and transformed his jeep back into Jeff.<br />
<br />
Jeff didn&#39;t bother covering his nakedness but Greg worried a bit about how the neighbors might react so he rushed Jeff to the front door and knocked. Danny answered and was shocked, &quot;What&#39;s up with Jeff? Where are his clothes?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg said, &quot;I&#39;ll explain. Just let us in first.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tyler, Rob, Cliff, Reg, Steve (sometimes called Stephan), Max and Derek were already there. Some of Greg&#39;s other friends hadn&#39;t arrived yet. The guys that were there froze and stared at Jeff as he walked into the room.<br />
<br />
Danny asked, &quot;So what&#39;s going on, Greg?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg explained, &quot;You guys remember the jeep that we&#39;ve all worked on? Well that jeep was actually Jeff. He got some kind of technology that my dad used to transform him into a jeep. And all the changes that we made to that jeep, well this is the result. Meet my jeep.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny looked at Jeff&#39;s royal blue skin while Tyler and Max looked at the lightning bolt patterns all over Jeff&#39;s body. Tyler also remembered the changes he made to the Jeep&#39;s computer and wondered if that was why Jeff was just standing there.<br />
<br />
Jeff looked around at all of Greg&#39;s friends. They were definitely Greg&#39;s friends, not Jeff&#39;s friends. Jeff did kinda like Tyler and Rob because they were a little nerdy and at times, Jeff could nerd out with Tyler and Rob but they were still Greg&#39;s friends. Tyler had even called Jeff annoying and Jeff didn&#39;t know why Tyler would feel annoyed.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Jeff didn&#39;t like how Danny was eyeing him. Jeff didn&#39;t trust Danny.<br />
<br />
None of them wanted to admit it but they all noticed that Jeff had a semi-hardon as he stood there. His long, circumcised dick was the elephant in the room.<br />
<br />
Rob finally broke the silence by asking, &quot;Jeff, are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff answered, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m okay. Why does everyone keep asking me that? My self diagnostic indicates that everything is in perfect working order. Maybe I could use a wash and wax but . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob interrupted, &quot;No, I mean after all we did to you. You&#39;re dad turned you into a jeep and without knowing it we overhauled your whole body. How do you feel about that?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how I feel. How am I supposed to feel? What does it feel like to be a jeep? So far, it feels really good and just look at me. Don&#39;t I look absolutely cool?&quot;<br />
<br />
The guys started to relax and get back to the party. They also didn&#39;t know how they felt about a naked, blue Jeff partying with them but it began to be less and less of a big deal.<br />
<br />
They all swam a bit, then got food and lounged around talking. Jeff&#39;s semi-hardon never went away but never got harder either. When Jeff sat, his long dick did stick up a little away from his crotch. The guys kept getting furtive glances of it but refused to stare.<br />
<br />
Jeff had never thought of Rob in a sexual manner but he remembered the previous night how he felt so attracted to Rob when Rob held his balls. Jeff felt a subconscious desire to have Rob or Greg hold his balls again.<br />
<br />
Tyler asked, &quot;So Jeff, are you still planning on a career in computers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Maybe, I could plug myself into a computer and reprogram it directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny asked, &quot;You mean programming computers as a jeep right, since you&#39;re a jeep now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Yea, that&#39;s right.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;Alright, that&#39;s it. Jeff, stand up.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff stood up but Greg asked, &quot;Danny, what are you up to?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny said, &quot;I&#39;m going to deal with the elephant in the room that we&#39;ve all been ignoring.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny walked up and grabbed Jeff&#39;s cock. He stroked it until it hardened into a full erection. Jeff blushed but didn&#39;t resist.<br />
<br />
Danny stepped back and asked, &quot;What do you think of that, Jeff? Is that okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;You were a little rough with my gear shifter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny asked, &quot;Is that all? You&#39;re not complaining that I touched you, only that I was a little rough?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Greg isn&#39;t so rough when he shifts gears.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny walked up and slapped Jeff on the butt.<br />
<br />
Jeff said, &quot;Ow. Why&#39;d you do that for?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny spanked Jeff again. Jeff just said, &quot;Ow.&quot; Danny spanked Jeff again. Jeff said, &quot;Quit it.&quot; Danny spanked Jeff again.<br />
<br />
Greg stood up and said, &quot;Knock it off, Danny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny grabbed a fistful of Jeff&#39;s ass and squeezed. &quot;He&#39;s a jeep and he&#39;s in my house. I can do whatever I want. Why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot;<br />
<br />
Greg said, &quot;Because he&#39;s my brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Rob stood up and said, &quot;And because he&#39;s my friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone else just sat there waiting to see what would happen next.<br />
<br />
Danny grabbed Jeff&#39;s balls and squeezed real hard before letting go and going back to his seat. Jeff was about to fall over but Rob and Greg rushed over to help him stand.<br />
<br />
Rob cursed Danny out. Rob was so focused on his anger at Danny, he didn&#39;t notice as Jeff had taken both Rob&#39;s and Greg&#39;s hands and put them on Jeff&#39;s balls.<br />
<br />
Rob looked at Jeff who hung his head submissively. Rob looked at Greg who was as curious as Rob was.</p>
