<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Monica was getting ready for work, she thought about Damon and wondered what he was up to.  Now that he has settled into his new school, she thought about what it was like for him there.  Was he being taken care of properly?  Was he actually being taught anything?  Was he having fun?  Did he have any friends to play with?  Monica whispered to herself, &quot;I wish I knew what Damon&#39;s school was like when I&#39;m not there.  Out of nowhere, a puff of smoke arose in her living room and a beautiful woman appeared.  &quot;Where did you come from?&quot;, asked Monica in fear.  &quot;Fear not, mortal, for I am a genie here to grant your wish.  Consider your first wish a free sample so that you may know what I&#39;m capable of.  If it were possible, would you like to spend just today with Damon in his special class to see what he&#39;s up to?&quot;, asked the genie.  &quot;Umm, yeah, of course if it&#39;s possible.&quot;, replied Monica.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to regress your age down to  five like Damon, but I&#39;m giving you the potty skills of someone who just started learning how to use the potty.  This means you&#39;ll be asked to go potty on a potty chair every thirty minutes and that you will wear disposable training pants that have a cooling sensation when you wet them.  I&#39;m also reducing your language skills.  You&#39;ll only know fifty words and you&#39;ll only be able to speak in two word sentences.  You&#39;ll still be able to walk and feed yourself, but if you aren&#39;t careful, you may spill a small amount of food out of your spoon.  But, you&#39;ll be able to successfully use a spoon most of the time.  You&#39;ll use a regular cup with no lid, but you may find that if you aren&#39;t careful and use both hands, you may accidentally spill it onto your bib.  You&#39;ll have no number and letter recognition so reading, writing, counting, and simple math will be impossible for you.  Otherwise, you&#39;ll have your normal intelligence, though you won&#39;t be able to show it to your teachers and class mates because of your limitations.  Again, this is only just for today.  When the day is over, you will be teleported back home, have your intelligence restored, and your age restored to normal.  However, your clothes will remain the same as what you were wearing at school and so you will have to change out of them quickly before the bus drops Damon off.  One more thing, Monica, you won&#39;t know how to undo the straps of your  five point seat safety harness on your school bus.  Are you ready to start your day Monica?  Think of it as a fun day off of work!&quot; spoke the genie.  &quot;Girl, I&#39;m ready when you are, this should be interesting and I&#39;ll learn a lot about my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Monica sat of a different bus than Damon, though this bus was still just as short.  Unlike Damon&#39;s, this one didn&#39;t have a lift but it still had blue handicap logos plastered next to where the front and back said &quot;School Bus&quot;  She looked down to see that she was indeed sitting in a school bus seat that had a built in harness to keep her safe and secure while the bus was in motion.  She had looked down at her......lavender and white training pants?.....and notices that Anna and Elsa from Frozen were covered by the crotch strap and buckle that kept her in place.  She knew that she&#39;d have to work very hard to keep the snow flake on her disposable training pants from fading away.  She observed the rest of her outfit.  She had on a simple Frozen T-shirt, Frozen ankle socks, and Frozen light up shoes with purple LEDs.  The genie had clearly known how to coordinate her outfit.  But....why wasn&#39;t she wearing any thing to cover her training pants?  But then she remembered that it was best to not wear anything over the training pants so that they&#39;d be much easier to pull on and off and so that she could visibly see her snowflake if it faded.  Speaking of fading a cold sensation started creeping up her skin in her training pants.  She had guessed that she&#39;d wet herself and didn&#39;t know it.  Oh well, she&#39;d have to deal with  it when she got to school.  She looked out the window, not paying attention to the boy beside her picking his nose and watched as .....what&#39;s that word again?.....She couldn&#39;t place the word, but she knew the sound the animal made and so she pointed out the window and said, &quot;Moo, moo, moo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Damon had already started his day since he arrived before Monica.  He was busy playing with the toy plastic ring stacker his teacher had placed on his special needs wheelchair tray while waiting for the other students to arrive so that he could eat breakfast.<br />
<br />
The genie had hoped that after Damon and Monica arrived home that she could convince them both to enroll at the new special needs kids home opening up on the other side of town.  She knew that they were even better at taking care of their special needs kids than even the school could, not that the school was less than excellent.  She knew that the special needs kids home would coordinate with the special needs school in providing complete care for their students without parents ever having to worry about them.  She also knew that the state also put orphaned special needs kids there to take care of them.  The genie also wanted to convince Monica that if she would become special too, she could have fun and not have to worry about adult responsibilities anymore.  She had also hoped to convince Monica that she could have even more fun than Damon by becoming even more special than he currently is.</p>
