<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">That morning Jennifer was still sore from her bottom as she had no idea what had caused it to feel that in first place. On the floor she noticed assortment of clothing thrown in the middle of the clean room. Jennifer could swore that the clothes weren&#39;t there yesterday. She looked at the door and noticed that it was closed. That was also strange. Did her mother throw these here? Who knew at this point. <br />
<br />
Jennifer went to inspect the weird looking clothes. Thinking that they weren&#39;t her number one pick for normal looking clothes. On top of the pile was stretched pink leggings with golden cursive text that read &#39;I&#39; and &#39;A&#39; with heart symbol in between them. The rest of the text was unreadable as it had been teared off making the leggings unusable.<br />
<br />
The other items included black panties and with frills all over it. Inside it there were a lots of crust and odd looking funk in both sides. Lastly the the weird looking sport model crop top which somehow was a perfect fit for Jennifer. <br />
<br />
Why were these in the middle of her room? These must have belonged to her mother but somehow these were perfect fit for Jennifer&#39;s body. With a big sigh she picked and dressed a new pair of leggings and underwear from the drawer and wondered what the hell was going on this time as she put the crop top on herself. All the clothes in the drawer had &#39;rich&#39; look to them. How was that possible. What was going on?<br />
<br />
From the door Jennifer could hear and smell that someone was making eggs in the kitchen. Jennifer approached the kitchen and saw her youthful mother actually making food near the stove. It was weird, but Jennifer wasn&#39;t complaining at all as it was just weird seeing her mother doing something productive for once. She seemed to only have a woolen light beige morning jacket that was hiding her naked skin.<br />
<br />
Jennifer approached the table and greeted her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rough night huh?&quot; Sylvia asked while serving the fried eggs on Jennifer&#39;s plate and then proceeding to pour some coffee into her mug.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could say so...?&quot; Jennifer replied back as she took a fork and begun to eat the two sunny side fried eggs.<br />
<br />
Sylvia took a sip from the mug and asked, &quot;So, how do you feel? Was... Was it what you expected?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmm. Fine...? And I guess it was..? Not sure... Maybe?&quot; Jennifer replied back as she had no idea what her mother was talking about. Was it abnormal for her mother to make breakfast for them? <br />
<br />
&quot;Good. Just remember that this has to be our little secret.&quot; Sylvia sternly looked at Jennifer while pouring orange juice on her glass. &quot;We&#39;ll be in big trouble if someone from your school finds out. You know? Also remember that it was you who asked for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uhmm, yeah, okay mom... My lips are sealed.&quot; Jennifer replied back as she didn&#39;t want to upset her mother and took a big gulp from the orange juice.<br />
<br />
Sylvia smiled back in response. Jennifer&#39;s mother was looking oddly happy and continued sipping her coffee mug while looking at the clock<br />
<br />
&quot;Since you are awake so early. I could make us some fried sausages while the pan is hot.&quot; Sylvia smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure thing mom. More sausages... Ha-ha...&quot; Jennifer laughed.<br />
<br />
As Jennifer kept putting more eggs in her mouth she lamented how her mother was only twenty two years old. That&#39;s a four year gap between them mentally. Yes, her mother was older but she could been her friend&#39;s friend. Jennifer felt weird that she was yet again become year younger and now this time she had gotten shorter. Jennifer had to be between three and four feet. It was difficult for her to eyeball the height. Looking at her mother she must have been in somewhere between four and half feet or maybe above five feet. Which meant that Jennifer was quite a shortie now if her mother was that tall.<br />
<br />
Jennifer looked to the floor to see that her mother needed a small step stool to cook. Meaning that this was going to be her own future. Being so short that she needed something to aid her to lift her higher. Jennifer felt a bit scared how other people treated her. Her height was an oddity for sure and a big red target sign telling others to bully her. <br />
<br />
Sylvia saw Jennifer sulking on the table and made a weird comment, &quot;Sweety. When your mom was your age I tried to rush everything and well... I got little bit too full of myself back then. I wanted to grow up soooo fast but because my mo- I mean grandma. She was pretty stern and well a bit unaware what I was going through. I ended up in a situation where I didn&#39;t want to be at because of my inner struggle with... You know...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jennifer was confused what her mother was talking about as the conversation felt out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what I am getting at is that if you feel... Never mind. Maybe it&#39;s too early to talk with you about these. I always forgot how young you are because I&#39;m... well...&quot; Sylvia rambled as Jennifer had no idea what her mother was talking about at all.<br />
<br />
What did she meant by &#39;forgetting how young her daughter was&#39; or that she &#39;wanted to grow up fast&#39; ? Jennifer had no idea what her mom meant by these. Jennifer had her own things to worry about. So she ignored these weird comments and moved on. She had to do something about this shirt at least. It was too... Too iffy for school day...<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom. Is there any blouses I could wear? I feel that the crop top might not be a good fit for school.&quot; Jennifer asked from her mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blouses? Blouses... blouses... uhmm... I think I have one somewhere. But since when you&#39;ve wanted to wear blouses? You&#39;ve always liked dressing up like that. Remember how you told me that you wanted to grow up like your mother and we went together the mall and I bought you that shirt? Hahaha!&quot; Sylvia laughed. &quot;But fine, I go get a blouse for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, ha hah. Thanks mom.&quot; Jennifer smiled as she felt weird for having a conversation like this with her mother. Had Jennifer actually wanted to dress like this? No way. The &#39;top&#39; was too skin revealing and even the leggings were stretching the limit if she was allowed to wear them at school but she didn&#39;t want to demand too much from her mother.<br />
<br />
After the breakfast sausages and switching from the crop top to a blouse. Jennifer walked outside to wait for the school bus to arrive.</p>
