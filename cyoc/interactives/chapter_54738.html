<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The sperm stopped backing out and began moving forward again.  “That was close”, Ashley’s consciences thought.  “Almost unmade me”.<p>

Outside the womb, Amber relaxed after her orgasm.  “Wow is that what an orgasm feels like.  Mom was right it does feel good.”  She turned and looked at the strange man pointing a camera at her.  “Are you my dad?”, she asked.<p>

Michael lowered the camera and looked at Amber.  “Yes I am.”, he answered.<p>

“So mom is in my womb correct?”, questioned Amber and placed her hand on her stomach.<p>

“Yes she is.”, sighed Michael.  “We need to check up on her.”<p>

“Okay”<p>

Michael set the camera aside and went to grab the pregnancy monitor device.  When he came back he placed the device on Amber’s bellybutton and turned it on.  At first nothing seemed to happen.  Michael was worried Ashley went too far, until the monitor beep and displayed conception.<p>

Michael felt nervous with his daughter unclothed on the bed, “Here put these on.”<p>

“Dad, this is so weird, mom showed me many things and taught me everything she knew, but everything is still new to me.”, said Amber as she pulled on the panties and tried to cover her breasts with the bra.  “It’s a little tight”.  Amber has a bigger cup size than her mother did.<p>

“I guess we need to buy you a bigger cup size.  Right now I’ll show you around our house.”<p>

“Okay dad”, Amber smiled.<p>

By the time Amber stood up off the bed, the hour had past and Ashley was no longer in danger of regressing any further by accident.  Meanwhile, Ashley was relaxing and floating gently in the womb.  She could not see, but had a strange sense of what was happening to her and around her.  She felt as her egg was beginning to divide and become two cells.  Ashley was slowly on her way to becoming a baby again.<p>

While touring her new surroundings, Amber was curious, “Dad, why did mom trade ages with me?”, she asked.<p>

Michael pointed to the sofa.  “Please sit and I’ll explain her plan and why she did it.”<p>

Amber followed her father’s direction and sat down.  For the next thirty minutes, Michael explained everything that Ashley had planned and why she did it.<p>

“So mom wanted to experience being created in the womb and being born for her book.”, pondered Amber.<p>

“One other thing, you need call me Michael when we are outside or with other people around.  You and your mom could be taken away by doctors or government agents.”, explained Michael.<p>

“I’ll try to remember that.  I don’t want anything to happen to mom.”, said Amber rubbing her bare stomach.  “Hmmm Dad does this make me mom’s mommy?”<p>

“For right now it does.”<p>

For the rest of the day Michael showed Amber around and helped her get dressed.  They went shopping for new clothes for her since some of Ashley’s clothes were slightly tight.  He helped Amber with cooking and set up the guest room for her.  That night Amber slept for the first time in her own bed.  Inside the womb, Ashley was dreaming as her cell count slowly increased.  Amber spent the next days at home watching TV and reading books, some of which her mother wrote.<p>

“Mom, you were a good writer, but your just my tiny baby right now.”, cooed Amber.<p>

Ashley’s egg connected to the wall of Amber’s uterus and attached itself.  At this time Amber started getting morning sickness.<p>

“Dad dad, I think I’m getting sick.  I just threw up.”, Amber panicked.<p>

Michael hugged his daughter, “I don’t think you are sick, it just part of being pregnant. It means her egg is attached to your womb and is feeding off of you.”<p>

It was not long before Michael took Amber to the doctor’s for a check up.  They sat in the waiting room for their turn.  A young nurse opened the door.<p>

“Amber Wood, please come with me.”, ushered the nurse.<p>

Amber followed the nurse to one of the patient rooms.<p>

“Well Amber since we do not have any records for you, we’ll need to do a full check up.  Please stand on the scales.”, said the nurse.<p>

Amber’s weight, height and blood pressure was checked.  After answering questions, Amber was left sitting on the table waiting for the doctor.  It was fifteen minutes later when the female doctor arrived.<p>

“Mrs. Wood I’m Doctor Haven.   I see you’re here for a pregnancy check up.”, the doctor introduced herself.<p>

“Yes, I’m 4 weeks pregnant with my baby girl.”, answered Amber.<p>

 “Was this a planned pregnancy?”, asked the doctor.<p>

Amber thought for a second, “In a way, yes it was”.<p>

“Okay, please get undressed and lay on the examination table.”<p>

Amber removed her skirt, blouse and underwear.  She laid down on the examination table.  The doctor placed her legs into stirrups.<p>

The doctor probed Amber’s womanhood.  “Everything here looks good.  This may feel uncomfortable, but I need to check on your baby’s health.”<p>

“Okay”, replied Amber and watched as the doctor pulled out a long metal tube attached to a display device.<p>

The doctor slowly inserted the small metal tube into Amber’s vagina and pushed past her cervix.  This caused Amber to grunt in pain.  The doctor continued to insert the tube.  Ashley felt something bump into her. <p>

“What’s that?”, Ashley thought, her eyes had not formed so she could not see.<p>

A small needle took a sample of Ashley’s amniotic fluid.  The device in the doctor’s hand started displaying data.<p>

“No genetic anomalies and she seems to be developing nicely.”, said the doctor as she pulled the tube back out.  Once the tube was out, “You may put your clothes back on.”<p>

Amber got off the table and redressed herself.<p>

“Now I’m prescribing some prenatal vitamins.”, Doctor Haven said while writing notes on a pad.  “Also I want to see you in two months for another check up.”<p>

After getting her prescription and setting up her return visit, Amber went to go meet Michael in the waiting room.  Just before opening the door, the doctor had one last statement to make.<p>

“Now if you have any problems, even if it seems small, give me a call immediately for the baby’s health.”, the doctor stated.<p>

Turning to the doctor, “I will doctor, thank you.”<p>

On the way to the drug store, Michael asked, “So how is Ashley doing?”<p>

“Ashley is developing just fine and the doctor found no genetic anomalies.  But the doctor wants me to notify her if there is even the slightest problem.”, Amber answered.<p>

“That’s good, we don’t want anything to happen to your mother.”, Michael said with relief.<p>

As time passed, Michael and Amber fell into a routine.  Amber stayed at home mostly, cleaning up and cooking dinner.  She also kept a video and written journal for her mother.<p>

“Look mom, here I am 3 months pregnant with you.  As you can see my stomach is starting to show.”, smiled Amber pointing the camera to her small bulge at her bellybutton. “You are also giving me strange cravings for pickles.  Dad thinks that’s funny.”<p>

Meanwhile Amber kept noticing changes in her embryonic body.  “Lookie, I have limbs now.”  Ashley could feel the small limbs that were the beginnings of arms and legs.  She had only small nubs at the ends for the start of fingers and toes.  Ashley playfully wiggled her newly grown limbs.<p> 

Ashley continued to grow inside her daughter’s womb.  She was enjoying discovering everything again.  When her ear drums developed, she could hear sounds once more.<p>

“Oh, I can hear mommy’s heart beat.”, thought Ashley, missing the point that she just called Amber her mommy.<p>

Outside the womb, Amber and Michael were starting to get the baby’s room put together.<p>

“This is kinda of weird dad, I mean, I’m helping put together my room for when I’m a baby.”, Amber said looking at her future room.<p>

Michael smiled, “At least you get to pick what you like.”<p>

Both of them started laughing.  Ashley, from her watery living space, could hear the distorted laughter through the walls of the womb.<p>

“I hear laughing”, thought Ashley and wiggled around to hear better.<p>

Amber felt the movement inside her womb.  “Dad, mom is moving around.”<p>

Michael put a hand on Amber’s 5 month belly and felt a tiny foot push against it. “I can feel her foot.<p>

Michael and Amber cooed and rubbed the extended belly.  Ashley thought it was a game and played along.  At the next doctor’s visit, Amber was laying on the 3-D hologram sonogram.  It was able to show a three dimensional image on the growing baby.<p>

Ashley heard a funny humming noise coming from all around her.  “What’s that?”, she thought.<p>

“As you can see here, your baby is developing nicely.  Oh and it is defiantly a baby girl.”, said the nurse pointing at the image of Ashley genitals.<p>

Ashley just remembered what that sound was, “They are looking at me on a sonogram.”<p>

“Do you want a copy of this image?”, asked the nurse.<p>

Amber nodded, “Yes please, my baby would love to see it, when she’s older.”<p>

As the nurse turned away from the image turning over a projection plate, Michael and Amber caught the sight of Ashley waving her hand.<p>

“I hope they see this”, giggled Ashley in her thoughts.<p>

Just before the nurse noticed the image of the baby girl waving her hand, Amber tapped her belly hoping to distract Ashley and cause her to stop waving.  It worked.<p>

“Here you go.”, smiled the nurse and turned off the sonogram.<p>

“Thank you”, smiled Amber.<p>

Ashley continued to grow and Amber was finding it harder to move around the house.<p>

“Mom here I am now 8 months pregnant with you, as you can see, I’m huge”. Amber said to the camera, showing her bloated stomach.  “One other thing, you need to stop kicking me in the ribs, it hurts.”<p>

Amber waddled into the baby’s room.  “Mom, look at the new baby’s room, I guess for a little bit it will be your room until we switch ages again.”<p>

Ashley loved to hear Amber’s voice, even though it was distorted.  Amber played music and read stories to Ashley as much as she could.  Amber always waited until she felt Ashley stop moving, signaling that she was asleep, before stopping her stories.<p>

Then one day, nine months after regressing back to a fertilized egg, Ashley was ready to be reborn again.  Amber was making breakfast, when a sudden contraction almost dropped her to the floor.  She had contractions before but they were mild compare to this one.<p>

“Dad, I think it’s time for Ashley to be born”, cried Amber between contractions. Just then her water broke and soaked her PJ’s.  “If fact she coming now”, she cried again.<p>

“Something’s pushing me.”, thought Ashley as the wall of the womb pushed against her feet.<p>

Michael frantically grabbed the bags and keys and rushed Amber as fast as he could to the hospital.  He could not wait to see his wife again.  Though, he was happy to get to know his daughter these past nine months.  In the hospital, Amber was rushed to a delivery room and put on a bed with a monitor.<p>

Doctor Haven looked at the readings.  “You’re progressing along just fine.  The baby’s heart rate is good and you’re dilation is going normally as expected.  I would guess your baby girl will be born in the next two hours or so.”<p>

The doctor was close to her estimate because Ashley was born three hours later.<p>

“One more push should do it.”, Doctor Haven said while cradling baby Ashley’s head.<p>

Amber grunted and push as hard as she could, she was tired. “Uuuuuuuh”<p>

Baby Ashley was born into the doctor’s hands.  A nurse quickly sucked out the mucus from the nose and mouth.  Ashley did not like the sensation and cried out.<p>

“Congratulations, it’s a baby girl”, announced the doctor.<p>

 “It’s too bright”, thought Ashley, and continued to cry. Her eyes were not accustom to the light, she had been in a dark womb for nine months.<p>

The nurse handed the clippers to Michael to cut the umbilical cord.  Which he did, though thinking it was strange for him to cut his wife’s umbilical cord.<p>

Amber rested as the nurses took Ashley and cleaned her up and weighed her.<p>

“7 pounds, 6 oz.”, said the nurse reading the scale.<p>

If anyone knew, when Ashley was born the first time, she was 6 pounds 10 oz.  Amber had been diligent in taking her vitamins.  The nurses diapered Ashley and took her finger and foot prints.<p>

“It’s cold”, Ashley thought as she was exposed to the air of the room and cried again.  She started shivering.<p>

The nurse saw that baby Ashley was shivering and wrapped her in a pink blanket.<p>

“That’s better”, thought Ashley and stopped crying. It felt warm again.<p> 

“Here’s your daughter”, cooed the nurse and handed the wrapped Ashley to Amber’s arms.<p>

“Happy birthday baby”, cooed Amber as she kissed Ashley’s forehead.<p>

“Have you picked a name for your baby?”, asked the head nurse with a clip board.<p>

Amber looked down and smiled, “Yes I have.  Her name is Ashley Elisabeth Wood.”<p>

Ashley opened her bright blue eyes at the sound of her daughter voice.  Though her vision was blurry and distorted, she recognized her daughters face. “Mommy, I mean Amber”, thought Ashley and made an attempt of a smile.<p>

“Ooo, she likes the name”, smiled the nurse as she put a plastic band with Ashley’s name around her tiny wrist.<p>

Amber, noting the doctor’s directions, started nursing Ashley from her breast.  Ashley’s baby instincts took over and she suckled milk from her daughter.  Amber, Ashley and Michael spent the rest of the day in the hospital, mostly because the doctor want to make sure Ashley was good to go home.  The next day, Amber carried newborn Ashley, wrapped in a pink blanket, out of the hospital and into an infant car seat.  Michael was glad his wife was back in the outside world.<p>

“So when do we change your mother back?”, asked Michael eager to have his wife back.<p>

Amber looked at the baby sleeping in the car seat.  “Well first little Ashley needs to recover from being born and also we need to know if mom still has her memories. And second, the doctor wants to have a few check ups and if I don’t show up with Ashley, she might call the authorities on us. And lastly, we’ll need to make my and baby Ashley’s disappearance believable, since many people now know the adult me.”<p>

Michael sighed, “ I guess your right, it’s just I miss your mother.”<p>

“I know dad”, replied Amber.</p>
