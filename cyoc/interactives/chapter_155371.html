<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hearing the words come from Duncan&#39;s mouth, the lust addled mind that you had made you nod your head in agreement, not knowing what was even going on. For once in your life, you found two exceptionally hot men willing to feed you cum like you loved, with what looked to be sodacan or thicker sized cocks trapped in their pants as what looked to be wet spots formed on the tips of the bulges making the uniform darker in that area. &quot;Holy shit... they really are productive!&quot; You thought to yourself as you licked your lips and looked them both up and down. You noticed their larger and hairier bodies than what they were before, noting that was a little bit strange and then your eyes locked onto aspects of their heads that became far more pronounced the longer you were there with them, in their room, as their pheromones continued to mess with your mind. Your own cock throbbed with need, bouncing and bobbing of its own accord as a single bead of pre accumulated at the tip of your head and threatened to drip to the ground and go to waste. As your eyes locked onto Angus and Duncan&#39;s heads, you weren&#39;t certain about what you were going to do. You were in a trap, you realized as you let your lust get the best of you and didn&#39;t even bother to pay attention to all of the dead giveaways as to the truth about the store you willingly walked into.<br />
<br />
You noticed that Angus and Duncan were sporting very hybrid ears as the cartilage formed lupine points, breaking at the center of the outer rim of their lobes and pointed backward. Their incisors, both on the upper and lower sets, were much longer, thicker and sharper than most. Their beards had become thicker and denser as their lips seemed to turn darker and more moist for some reason. You knew then that you completely fucked up and you walked right into the den of a couple of werewolves... two very large, brawny and beefy werewolf men in the early stages of their transformation and thought it might have been best for you to back the fuck up and put some distance between you and the two large beasts. You had no idea that the door was locked behind the three of you as you were so caught up in getting fed cum and realized that they were more like spiders; letting flies get caught in their web and then enjoy the fruits of their labor at their leisure. You mind began running a hundred miles a minute, trying to figure out how you were going to get out of this one. &quot;The door... yes, just get to the door, open it up and just head out... and then what? Walk around the city half naked with your cock exposed for the world to see? Walk around and potentially be the next victim of the werewolf incursion that was taking over? No... you couldn&#39;t do either of them... neither would net you an outcome that would be good for you and remaining human. Both spelled a certain sort of doom, but more than likely the bit about you walking around with your lower region exposed for the world to see wouldn&#39;t be all that much of a problem... what with the police actively dealing with the current situation... unless of course they were also transformed into werewolves like these officers were.&quot; You said to yourself, grunting and groaning more in your own head than you did aloud... or at least so you thought.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything alright bud? You seemed incredibly eager before and I can see your mouth not only quivering, but watering at the thought of having our fat and leaky cocks all to yourself.&quot; Angus said as he started to approach you, rubbing himself, getting his bulge even larger in his pants as they started to grow more taut around him and started splitting in various areas exposing hairy tanned flesh underneath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah bud... we are quite eager to feed a hungry cock and cum slut like yourself. We haven&#39;t been drained by one of you for quite some time. Don&#39;t you want to come over here and help your new friends out?&quot; Duncan asked as he remained by Angus&#39; side, the distance between them not more than a few inches apart, making sure that if you did try to slip past them, you wouldn&#39;t be able to get between the two and escape that way... even though you weren&#39;t going to go anywhere... unbeknownst to you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um... I think I have made a mistake. I am just going to go. I think I got a bit ahead of myself and it would just be best for me if I left... even if you guys look so unbelivably tasty!&quot; You moaned, licking your lips as the pheromones continued getting to you and the lust started messing with your mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;Go... where do ya expec&#39; you&#39;re gonnae go there lad?&quot; Angus asked as his brogish Scottish accent started to return as his beast was emerging. &quot;Ya think ya are gonna go somewhere do ya? Did ya think we were just gonnae leave it up to chance and let you escape like you must&#39;ve with our brothers?&quot; Angus continued as the fangs in his mouth grew ever sharper and his eyes began to turn crimson instead of the amber hue that you expected.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right... my brother in the pack is spot on ya know?&quot; Duncan said as his eyes also turned crimson and fear began to strike deep down into your soul, wondering what it was that you had gotten yourself into. Their eye color... you had to idea what it all meant, but you also knew it couldn&#39;t have been good since the amber hued ones wanted to fuck your tight little hole till you were as loose as a hot dog bun.<br />
<br />
You backed up as far as you could as you made your way to the door. Your back and your puffy ass cheeks pressed against the cold steel door, which you automatically knew was bad since it wasn&#39;t something that could be broken down or through. You fumbled blindly for the door knob, trying to turn it and either pull toward you or push it away, not having noticed which way it went, but either way it didn&#39;t matter since it didn&#39;t budge in either direction. &quot;Locked?! Oh no! Oh fuck!&quot; You screamed in your mind and the two beasts just grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;cha jus accept it lad? You are gonnae bae our pup! Our hungry pup that just is always begging to be fed our cum and a pup that will never be unsatisified with the filling ya will get from tha both o&#39;us!&quot; Angus said as his claws began emerging from his hairier and thicker hands that also developed thick pads on them as they started to become more paw like as he brought it past your head, resting it on the door with a wicked grin as you got a clear view of his incredibly thick and massive bicep attached to his round capped shoulders that led into his thick traps. &quot;You&#39;re a hungry pup... aren&#39;t ya boyo?!&quot; Angus added as he brought his nose closer to your neck and breathed in deeply as an alpha predator.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yah and if ya don&#39;t get enough from one of us... ya will from the both of us, but I think with how hungry of a pup you are going to be... you wont fret over more cum than you can handle... isn&#39;t that right boyo!?&quot; Duncan said as he followed suit with Angus, but on the opposite side as you were perfectly flanked by the huge transforming werewolves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuhhhh...&quot; You said as the lust in your mind started to take over as your lips watered in hunger. &quot;N-no... I... I won&#39;t.&quot; You said, trying to think your way out of things. Think your way in to a place where you could stall and come up with more of a plan since there was no escaping the place that you were in. There were no windows. No other doors. A couple of curtained off areas, which must&#39;ve been to separate the bed and play space from something and somewhere else... perhaps where they ate? &quot;Ugh... how am I going to get out of here?!&quot; You thought to yourself... or so you thought, not realizing the words came out of your mouth vocally.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave? Nah... you&#39;re not gonna leave... are yae? Ya jus&#39; got here, dinit&#39; ya? You&#39;re a hungry pup for our special man milk... we know ya are, but ere&#39; since ya saw mine and Duncan&#39;s eyes... yar whole demeanor jus&#39; changed. Wha&#39; happened pup? Ya wanna know what the deal is with our eyes... do ya? Have yarself a sample o&#39;da goods and I&#39;ll explain it to ya...&quot; Angus said with a grin as the bulge had popped the zipper open and his huge, thick, mushroom headed cock slickened and slimy with his thick and potent werewolf pre hung there right in front of your face, next to your lips and all you had to do was lick.</p>
