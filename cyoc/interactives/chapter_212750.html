<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jim wasn&#39;t the typical guy you&#39;d imagine at a party like this. <br />
<br />
He was somewhat antisocial and shy, but he always craved attention. So despite his natural aversion to other people, he was terrified of not being around when the cool thing happened or of being left behind when everyone did something fun, and that pushed him past his comfort zone.<br />
<br />
Plus, he loved to brag about his skills as a coder, explaining &quot;advanced&quot; concepts to his &quot;slow&quot; classmates. He always glad to help out when someone below him asked for help, especially when they argued with him. <br />
<br />
He was decently attractive: thin wavy brown hair, lean body type, and a smile that left all women uncontrollably smitten. Sure, he didn&#39;t have a girlfriend, not yet, but he was here at this party to change that!<br />
<br />
Jim walked into the open door of the downstairs bathroom, escaping from the loud noise of the party. Still the sounds of music blasting and people screaming echoed vividly through the walls. Intense bass shook the tiny room, but it didn&#39;t bother him much. He’d been drinking all night and, right now, the only thing he cared about was finding somewhere to take a piss. <br />
<br />
In the corner of the bathroom was a smashed toilet, porcelain piled neatly, shoved away from the actual toilet. From the scorch marks, it looked like someone had dropped an M80 into it and blew it to smithereens. And the newer one, the actual toilet…. <br />
<br />
It seemed… odd? A red light bathed it in a soft, warm glow, illuminating its bizarre features. It wasn&#39;t just plain white porcelain; In the dim light, it looked as though it had a strange design - two marks, like human eyes, were painted on the toilet seat. Jim blinked and the eyes were gone, though he thought he saw indentations in the seat where they had been moments before.<br />
<br />
Someone had waaaay too much time to fucking to decorate, Jim thought.<br />
<br />
Another blink and even the indentations were gone. Jim shook his head. He really needed to stop drinking so much, he was hallucinating fucking eyes on a toilet!<br />
<br />
Chuckling to himself, he lifted the lid, briefly exposing his hand to the red light. Instantly, his hand began to tingle pleasantly, though his fingers felt strangely numb. He paused, watching the skin on his hand slowly turn white, before lifting the lid and removing his hand from the light. Jim stared at his strangely pale and numb hand, flexing it a few times, finding it rather stiff.<br />
<br />
Fucking weird.<br />
<br />
He unzipped his fly and fished his cock out of his pants. The water inside the bowl bubbled and made a weird gurgling noise… oh well, whatever. Probably just gas trapped in the pipe. Jim placed his strangely numb hand on his cock and pissed into the toilet. Instantly, relief washed through him as he emptied his bladder. <br />
<br />
“Gaaahhhh, fuck, that’s good.” He moaned out loud.<br />
<br />
As he pissed, the gurgles from the toilet, which sounded almost like protests, subsided. The red light that bathed it stayed on a few moments longer, then switched off. Jim finished pissing a few seconds later. Flushing the toilet he turned to use the sink. But as he turned the knob, the water sputtered out of the faucet in tiny bursts. Jim sighed. This bathroom was fucking useless.<br />
<br />
&quot;God, they need to hire a plumber.&quot;<br />
<br />
Above him, the hidden machine whirred to life and red light engulfed him. <br />
<br />
It was hot and pleasurable, soothing his body in its radiant energy. He immediately knew something was wrong. What was this feeling that had just overcome him? It felt kinda like the same sensation he’d gotten when he’d attempted to lift the toilet lid. The heat was burning up his face, massaging it. He gazed into the sink mirror and terror dripped down his spine.<br />
<br />
His face was growing a beard. <br />
<br />
Normally he was clean shaven; he couldn&#39;t stand hair anywhere but his head. He made sure to shave before coming to the party. Yet, as he looked at his reflection, Jim could see the beginnings of a full beard. It started dim, a five o&#39;clock shadow, but every second it grew darker and fuller. The hair ended up his cheeks and down his chin, connected in places his failed beard attempts never did. After a few moments, his beard was finished. It was big, brown, and bushy.<br />
<br />
&quot;This can&#39;t be real, it just can&#39;t be,&quot; he stammered. He raised up his hands and touched his new beard. It felt… good.<br />
<br />
The warmth continued to spread over his body, coalescing on his head. His luscious brown hair trembled and then started falling out in droves. At first it was just a few stray strands, then large clumps, until finally all the hair on his head fell out. Jim started in disbelief at his reflection. He didn&#39;t recognize who he saw. It was as if he was someone totally different.<br />
<br />
His body itched as he grew a rather heavy pelt of hair, curls of which puffed from the top and back of his shirt. He moaned in horror. Not back hair! Girls liked slightly hairy guys, but not this hairy. He looked like a monkey! He-he could shave the rest and maybe wear a wig, but having to wax his back every month would be torture! <br />
<br />
His stomach gurgled and churned. He put his hands on his stomach as he felt suddenly off balance. Jim felt overstuffed and warm, like he just ate a huge meal. He moaned and rubbed hi stomach. It felt so good. His fingers sank into the growing pudge as he slowly inflated with fat. He began to rub his belly, savoring the warmth.<br />
<br />
He could only watch with a mixture of despair and delight as his belly slowly grew, ballooning out in his hands. More hair crept up from his belly button, itching his fingers as the strands scratched his fingertips. The treasure trial thickened as it met with his dense chest hair. Jim’s stomach continued to expand, refusing to stop no matter how hard he pushed against it. It soon hung over his belt, continuing to grow until it was huge and round and hairy.<br />
<br />
The rest of his body began to thicken up as well, and the fat grew firm and dense. Beneath that thick layer of blubber, his muscles expanded and contracted warmly. Jim groaned, his voice a rich deep timbre, as his flabby form bulged with the heavy muscles of a working man.<br />
<br />
The new muscle accented his new size, and it gave his appearance much needed definition. His stomach wasn&#39;t flabby, but instead a solid ball that jutted out in front of him, forcing him to lean back to balance the weight, making it all the more prominent. His arms and legs grew too, widening his frame. <br />
<br />
With a series of creaks and snaps, his clothes burst completely off from all the added size. <br />
<br />
Jim&#39;s naked body was exposed to the mirror. He looked like a behemoth, a manly bearish working dude with a stern expression on his boyish face. It was totally different from the thin, athletic body Jim had mere moments ago. <br />
<br />
As he continued to look in the mirror, he felt his cock throb eagerly, enticed by the man staring back at him in the mirror, as well as the warmth working its way through his body. Jim moaned as a bead of pre welled at the tip of his cock, his emotions warring between disgust and a swiftly growing lust.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, new clothes wove themselves out of thin air, covering his body. <br />
<br />
He was now wearing a wife beater with a yellow reflective work vest, covered in dirt and grime. His pants were a pair of jeans that clung tightly to his ass. Despite gaining larger clothes, these were still extremely ill-fitting. Jim’s hairy belly button peaked out from below his shirt and his furry ass crack hung out in the open. As the changes seemed to conclude, Jim felt sick.<br />
<br />
&quot;This all some stupid dream. I&#39;m gonna wake up any second now. None of this is real. I&#39;m real… I&#39;m real.&quot; Jim mumbled to himself in complete denial.<br />
<br />
Jim suddenly realized who he looked like. He was reminded of his father&#39;s plumber, a strange gay man who liked to shake his ass as he worked under appliances. Jim swore the man only did it when the guy knew he was watching. Plus, the dude had some weird thing going on with his son. They both worked together and… it seemed like there was a little something more there.<br />
<br />
&quot;FUCK NO! I&#39;m not turning into some fat fucking plumber,&quot; Jim protested, picking up a shard of broken porcelain. &quot;Wake up! Wake up now!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jim was about to hit himself in the head when the red light concentrated on it. He moaned, the waves of pleasure tingling pleasantly in his mind. He heard a voice echo inside his head. At first the voice was quiet, but as the pleasant tingles increased, it gradually grew louder. It spoke to him, told him things. That he wasn’t disgusted by his reflection, that he was horny and incredibly hot. Jim didn’t resist-it was like a surprise attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;God I&#39;m so fucking horny. I look so fucking hot in these jeans.&quot; Jim found himself saying out loud. His voice had a rough seductive tone, rumbling like gravel. It sounded strangely familiar. Then Jim realized what he had just said. “I—no, this...it’s not right, I’m not supposed to be a hot bear plumber…”<br />
<br />
Something about calling himself a hot bear seemed wrong, but he wasn’t sure what. The tingles in his brain felt oddly like the head of his dick when he stroked off, gently massaging his mind into a more ideal configuration. Was he really hot?<br />
<br />
 Maybe...maybe he should check himself out more thoroughly. It couldn’t hurt, right?<br />
<br />
Jim rubbed his meaty hands over his burly body, appreciating how large he was. He was fat, but all this muscle more than made up for it. And even though he was bald...well, he still had hair everywhere else, so did it really matter. Jim turned slowly, admiring how large his rear was. Thanks to the muscle, his cheeks were rounded haunches.<br />
<br />
His ass crack was furry but oddly inviting, his jeans squishing the cheeks together. Jim licked his lips as he admired himself, his cock growing hard. There was nothing wrong with enjoying a body as masculine as his, right? Jim reached under his gut and lowered his jeans.<br />
<br />
Jim’s exposed cock twitched under the pleasurable warmth of the red light as it danced over his new body.  The light scanned over his balls, causing an immediate effect as blood filled his nutsack before rapidly gaining a jello-like consistency that continued to firm as his life giving fluid solidified into new, lifegiving flesh. <br />
<br />
The red light lingered for a bit, causing his balls to grow as big as goose eggs before his sack strained.  While his balls were growing, the skin surrounding them was not and soon it was stretched taut. , Jim could feel everything shifting around and let out a deep moan as his testicles began to sag down his thighs.<br />
<br />
The light shifted to his drippy shaft. Jim moaned happily as his cock tingled and pulsed. He reached down and slowly stroked his dick.  It swelled larger at his touch, eliciting another moan. He slid his blunt, calloused fingers along the sensitive skin of his schlong as it grew longer and rounder. His beercan-thick dick soon touched the bottom of his furry gut before the light moved back to his head.<br />
<br />
Jim stared hungrily into the mirror at the sexy bear jerking off his fat cock, his big balls slapping his thigh with every stroke. It took him a moment to realize that he was the bear in the mirror and that voice in his head had grown louder and hornier. It was more deafening than the party, which now faded completely into the background. <br />
<br />
“Yeah, I’m a hot fucking bear with a big fuckstick!” Jim involuntarily growled at his reflection.<br />
<br />
Yeah he was a big sexy…Wait, no! He shook his head to silence the voice, which was telling him he was a horny bear plumber. This body wasn’t hot aside from the big dick! Something was clearly wrong. He needed help. Jim pulled out his phone from his discarded jeans and opened it, though his thick sausage fingers made typing his code difficult.<br />
<br />
Jim had to close one eye to block the warm red light that was bathing his head in its gentle glow while he frantically searched for someone who could help. He found the number for emergency services and attempted to dial it. Unfortunately, his fat fingers hit the camera app instead.<br />
<br />
He paused, mesmerized by the handsome bear reflected back in the camera. Was that big man really him? The warm waves buffeted his thoughts. Maybe...maybe before he got help and changed back, he should take a few pictures. Just for archival purposes or whatever.<br />
<br />
Jim pulled up the camera app and posed, taking a few pics of his cock and belly. He found himself assuming lewder poses, rubbing his gut and stroking his cock. It felt racy and exciting, and he only stopped when he found himself unable to properly spread his ass cheeks for an asshole shot.<br />
<br />
He considered asking someone at the party, but...why would he take a pic of his own asshole? Who in the hell would want to see this body? Confused, Jim tried to close out of the camera app and call the emergency number, but he mis-clicked again and his social media app pulled up.<br />
<br />
Jim was stunned. <br />
<br />
This fucking plumber had porn page… a popular porn page! All he did was post pictures of himself in his work gear, belly out, sometimes with his whole body exposed. The plumber was named Jim too; was this guy taking over his whole life?! Jim saw all the followers on the profile, and he was amazed at how much traction the plumber got online. Hundreds of horny men left thirsty comments begging to be used and violated. <br />
<br />
He had thought the body to be gross, but all those comments…Jim had to admit that while he had an average social life, he had never been this popular. And well… he kinda like it. His dick grew harder, imagining all the needy boys of the world in need of a real daddy.<br />
<br />
That thought made him pause. Boys? What was he thinking? Some of these guys were his age! It took him a moment to realize the raunchy thoughts in his head had come from the other voice. <br />
<br />
While Jim was busy sorting his thoughts from the plumber’s thoughts, the warmth and tingles in his head increased. <br />
<br />
A slow, steady stream of memories began to insert themselves into his mind. At first, Jim didn’t even notice anything was wrong. His years going to technical school as a plumber went by quickly, the knowledge cementing itself firmly since he didn’t fight it, unaware that he was even under attack.<br />
<br />
He began uploading his newest pics to his social media account. Ten years of working as a plumber gently settled into his head while he waited for the files to finish uploading.  His smooth skin grew worn and lost its youthful luster. The files posted and immediately he began to get likes and comments.<br />
<br />
“Woof!”, one commentator said. “So fucking hot!”, said another. “Fuck me daddy!” said a third.<br />
<br />
More and more comments poured in, making Jim blush. <br />
<br />
While he was reading his messages, another decade’s worth of memories began to trickle in. He burped softly, patting his stomach. Fast food had certainly done a number on him over the years. Jim grinned at another comment calling him a handsome bear. When he dropped the smile, the lines stayed, etching themselves deeper as his face grew wrinkled. His body prickled as flacks of gray hair appeared throughout the forest of body hair, strands of his beard graying as well.<br />
<br />
“Fuck me daddy!” Demanded a poster and the older bear chuckled.<br />
<br />
The young pup had to be twenty. Cute kid. Yeah, he was a hot daddy bear, that was true. Pride welled up inside of him. Maybe he’d send that cub some more pics.<br />
<br />
As Jim grew more vain and prideful, the strange voice in his head began to feel less foreign. It was like an old friend, like a brother… like a part of himself. It became harder to distinguish which thoughts were his own and which thoughts were the plumber&#39;s. He didn&#39;t mind not knowing. They had always been this way. Jim had always been a horny plumber. Jim had always been this way.<br />
<br />
Jim looked at his reflection again. <br />
<br />
A burly middle-aged plumber grinned cockily back at him. Yeah, he’d been a kid once, but that was years ago now. He was just glad he’d gone to school at the right time to understand electronics or he’d never have been able to navigate his phone or post sexy pics for his followers.<br />
<br />
Jim relaxed and admired his body, rubbing his gut with one hand and his cock with another. He stopped himself from finishing. There would be time for that later; he needed to fix this sink first. He looked around for his toolbox and couldn&#39;t find it.<br />
<br />
The red light quietly shut off and with it, the last of Jim’s old memories shut off as well.</p>
