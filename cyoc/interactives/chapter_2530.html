<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Scott sat back and wedged himself into a corner, drawing his covers up around his neck.  Even in that position, Don could see small signs of the fur coat that climbed Scott's body from his crotch to his jaw.  Spreading his legs, Scott kicked them out from under the covers and Don watched their thick muscles turn as feet came to rest on the floor.  For a few seconds, it seemed that Scott was going to support himself with his arms spread on either side, but instead Scott pulled them under the blanket and started rubbing them over his body, especially his chest.  &quot;This is some good stuff, Laird.&quot; Scott said.  &quot;It makes your whole body buzz.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; Don smiled as he watched Scott's sexual temperature rise.  The truth was he wanted to go over and rip off Scott's blanket.  Well, the truth was that DON was the one who wanted to be shrinking right now.  He cast a glance at the plant behind him, and remembered that it was important for Scott to have a good time before Don tried anything more aggressive.  Turning back to his roommate, he saw that Scott's eyes were closed and he had started quietly masturbating under the blanket.  That just made Don's dick all the harder... he had never had a real, live man jacking off in front of him before.   Don watched at Scott's feet left the ground, withdrawing towards his roommate's center.  Don stood up to move closer to Scott.
<br />

<br />
Scott noticed that his feet were off the floor and started kicking them a little bit, trying to find another resting place for them.  Of course, it was a futile effort and he soon had to open his eyes to see what the problem was.  Don was standing in front of him, looking larger than life, and he found he had to pull the blanket down from around his neck for the second time as it had crept up again.  Don had obviously caught him stroking himself, but instead of being embarassed he found it was a little exciting.  &quot;Hey,&quot; Scott said, &quot;can you see what's going on with my feet?&quot;  He swung his legs back and forth in the air for Don.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sure I can,&quot; Don said, moving a little closer.  &quot;They are too short to reach the floor.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Scott felt a cold chill overpower his burning desire for just a moment.  He had felt his head slipping down the wall behind him several times, and his butt sliding on the bed.  He looked up in to Don's face and saw it did seem much larger than it should have.  And why did he have to look UP so much?  He was taller than Don and had looked up at his roommate any number of times from the bed, but never at this steep an angle.  &quot;You mean I'm... I'm,&quot; Scott stammered, unable to get the words out.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I think the word you're looking for is SHRINKING,&quot; Don said, grabbing Scott's blanket and yanking it back just as he said the final word, for dramatic effect.  The startled look on his hairy roommate's face was worth the wait.  In one hand, the smaller man held his boner in one hand and his balls in the other as his whole form continued to deflate.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Shrinking,&quot; Scott echoed, startled by his roommate's sudden aggressiveness.  He knew that he should be concerned about all this but the tides of lust were rising, even now rationalizing the whole experience.  Shrinking: of course!  That explained his head sliding, the covers bunching up, his legs leaving the ground.  But where was he shrinking TO?  &quot;Please...&quot; he started to say, and looked down to his groin.  His whole body was collapsing, retracting towards his cock and balls.  The more he shrank, the better it felt, so bring it on!
<br />

<br />
Don looked down at his dwindling friend.  Please what?  Please don't hurt me?  Please make it stop?  Please give me the blanket back?  He didn't have to wait long, as Scott gathered his thoughts.
<br />

<br />
Taking his hands off his genitals, Scott said, &quot;Please suck me, sir.&quot;  He added &quot;sir&quot; at the end just for good measure.
<br />

<br />
Don's reply was to pounce.  Scott leaned back as Don swallowed his entire throbbing boner.  Don rubbed his large hands all over Scott's bulging tummy and then up to Scott's hairy nipples, playing with them gently as they shrank closer together.
<br />

<br />
Scott's dick wasn't that big to begin with, and Don felt it fading away in his mouth like a piece of candy as he sucked.  Yep, definitely a little shorter now.  He rolled his tongue around the shaft.  Mmm-hmm, thinner around.  Drawing back a little he probed the head with his sensitive lips.  Oh yes, much smaller now.  This was Don's first time ever giving a blowjob but it was a blast!  He rolled his big hands around on Scott's hairy chest, pulling the fur through his fingers, even as he felt it shortening in his grasp.
<br />

<br />
Scott wrapped his legs around Don's large body, and Don felt them sliding up as his roommate shrank.  Scott's small hands clasped Don's thick wrists as the little man began to breathe heavily.  &quot;Oh, oh,&quot; he moaned as he grasped his giant partner tightly.  Don knew what was coming next for his little friend, so he wedged his strong hands deep under Scott's hairy armpits and held him tightly as the rod in his mouth started shooting.
<br />

<br />
Don had thought about taking the dick out of his mouth when it came, but was glad he didn't because his little man seemed to shrink the most when pumping out the cum.  Don put his tongue on top of Scott's spurting cockhead and felt the shrinking man's size melt right away.
<br />

<br />
Too soon for both men, it was over.  When Scott stopped spurting, Don discovered he also stopped shrinking.  After a few more seconds, Don leaned back on the floor, propping himself against his bunk.  It took several more seconds for Scott's breathing to return to normal, and when it did all he could get out was, &quot;Fuck.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Don giggled, still feeling heady.  &quot;I thought you'd like it, big guy.&quot; he said.  &quot;Or should I call you 'little guy' now?&quot;
<br />

<br />
As Scott's erection drooped, he regained some of his senses.  &quot;I've never been sucked off by a guy before,&quot; he started.  Not sure how to continue, he just said, &quot;You're great.&quot;  Don just smiled, his own dick having stayed fully hard in his pants through the whole experience.  Scott finally regained enough of his normal consciousness to ask, &quot;So, is the trip over?  I mean, I still feel something but it isn't like before.&quot;  Looking down at his enlarged roommate he added, &quot;And when do I grow back?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Don answered honestly.  &quot;I got the stuff on my skin, so when I washed it off the trip ended for me.  But you chewed your leaf, so it is inside your body now.  You've shrunk by what?  One-third?  I was way smaller than that.&quot;  The sentences were coming out, but Don realized they weren't making his first customer very comfortable.  He continued, &quot;But you only took a little bit, so I'm sure it will be wearing off pretty soon.  In fact, you've already stopped shrinking so I'd say it has started to wear off already.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Before Scott could reply, there was a knock at the door.  The roommates looked at each other, and then Scott dove for cover under the blankets.  Don stood up slowly and went to the door.</p>
