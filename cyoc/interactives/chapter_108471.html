<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jenny&#39;s day had gone rather well as she and Harry had had lunch with Karen. It had been fun and Jenny&#39;s roommate was eager to catch up on things. She was even up for seeing what Harry had been up to besides Jenny and their wedding planning. Jenny had fun and even Harry managed to tolerate the adventures they&#39;d ended up having through the day, which included a trip to Moon Lake&#39;s local K-Mart, one of the ones that hadn&#39;t closed permanently,  for some things that Karen needed for personal hygiene.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m so glad for you guys,&quot; Karen commented off had as they walked along through the store, &quot;and getting through all your wedding planning after things... that&#39;s great.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was more that we got help from someone who has the time to get into the nuts and bolts of the work to get ready beyond things like the therapy sessions with Doctor Twist and classes... and so on,&quot; Harry said weakly as he looked around.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s still giving you both more free time, which is good,&quot; Karen commented while looking through the various deodorants that were on the shelf in front of her.<br />
<br />
&quot;And yet we&#39;re here,&quot; Harry grumbled softly and winced after Jenny elbowed him. Karen didn&#39;t notice. She made her choice and then turned back to her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay... I&#39;m good to go,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;let&#39;s go check out and head back. The college should be ready to serve dinner soon and you can tell me more about what you guys have planned.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think we have anything more that&#39;s new,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;at least with regard to plans. We&#39;ll have to do some things twice... because of the trouble my parents could cause...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m fine with that,&quot; Karen answered with a smile, &quot;So long as I get to catch the bouquet.&quot;<br />
<br />
They went through the checkout and were soon headed back to the college campus. Jenny sat beside Karen as Harry drove them. He might not have been that into some of the places they&#39;d been through the afternoon, but he did feel glad to see Jenny smile and doing well. It served to give him hope for a successful wedding and many happy years for the pair of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aren&#39;t you pushing the whole bouquet thing?&quot; Jenny asked, &quot;I mean... the planning has been so fast that you&#39;re really the only bridesmaid that I have. I could just hand it to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No... it has to go the the other way with a toss,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;We can open it up and see anyone try and catch the flowers. It&#39;s the only way I can make sure that at some day I can go down the aisle with Peter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The werelion you&#39;ve been seeing?&quot; Jenny asked as Harry drove back onto the college campus and moved toward where Jenny and Karen&#39;s dorm was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Karen nodded, &quot;He&#39;s dreamy and smart... I REALLY like him. I&#39;ll be his lioness for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;See, I told you could find love,&quot; Jenny said with a smile.<br />
<br />
Karen returned it and nodded as Harry pulled into a parking space in a parking lot next to Jenny and Karen&#39;s dorm. They began to walk toward the door to the building so that Karen could put her purchases away before they could move on to their dinner plans. Karen hoped to have everyone together, Harry actually hoped to get back to his folks, and Jenny really didn&#39;t have a plan beyond staying by Harry&#39;s side, though she&#39;d have to get new clothes if she was go back to the Jenkins home. They were about to make it to the door when a tall figure emerged from the dorm. Jenny and Harry both stopped to note that the man was taller than them and carried a strong leonine scent. Karen recognized him immediately.<br />
<br />
&quot;Peter!&quot; Karen gave a happy cry and practically leaped into his arms.<br />
<br />
Peter Talbot barely responded the happy hello hug that he&#39;d gotten from Karen, and returned it. He&#39;d come down to spend some time with Karen and hopefully assure her that everything would be fine, in case she&#39;d seen the news about what had happened in Seattle, but had found that she wasn&#39;t in and was about to give up when he&#39;d stumbled onto her with a pair of werefoxes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Karen,&quot; Peter smiled and returned the hug, &quot;Have a busy day?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not too bad a day,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;I got to spend it with friends and get things sorted out for the wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The wedding,&quot; Peter said slowly, remembering that Karen&#39;s roommate was getting married with Karen as the Maid of Honor and his family planning to provide some extra security to make sure the wedding was a quiet one. As his mind processed this, he focused to Jenny and Harry, &quot;And you must be Jennifer Harper and Harold Jenkins. It is good to meet you and match a face to the name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can call me Jenny, it&#39;s okay,&quot; Jenny answered, &quot;and you must Peter... Talbot, I believe Karen said your last name was...&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Does anyone bother you with &quot;Wolfman&quot; movie questions?&quot; Jenny teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;No... not really,&quot; Peter answered, &quot;Of course... a fair number of Moon Lake&#39;s weres don&#39;t like werewolf movies, so not many people here have made that specific association.&quot;<br />
<br />
He gave a brief pause to watch Jenny nod.<br />
<br />
&quot;What most people catch onto, with regard to my name, is with regard to my place in werelion society,&quot; Peter finished.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... I&#39;m sure Karen can help you get through whatever stresses that brings,&quot; Jenny commented, &quot;my roommate has always been there for me and has been quite eager to help Harry and I with our wedding.&quot;<br />
<br />
Peter slowly nodded, &quot;and if we can... my family will try to help provide some additional security to make sure your wedding is a happy one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Harry spoke politely and took Jenny&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
&quot;So... what are you up to?&quot; Karen asked to Peter.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mostly looking for some time with you and to provide some comfort that things will be fine, regardless of what happened in Seattle,&quot; Peter answered.<br />
<br />
His answer brought only a series of surprised stares, as though none of them knew what was going on. His only rationalization was that the three of them had been out for the day and missed the news broadcasts on what happened. However, dealing with that for the moment was not something to be discussed on an open sidewalk for fear of starting a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;A lot did go on today,&quot; Peter stated simply, &quot;If you want to get some dinner... I can tell you about it more discreetly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Karen traded glances back to Jenny and Harry before she agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were about to stop for dinner here on campus,&quot; Karen commented, &quot;You&#39;re welcome to join us. You can tell us about what happened... and we can share with you about the wedding plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Peter commented, with his eyes focused on Karen.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Jenny turned to Harry who looked a bit nervous.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can go home together, dear, but we are here and I will need to get more clothing to wear anyway so I&#39;m wearing something clean anyway,&quot; Jenny said to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...&quot; Harry said slowly, &quot;hopefully they have something good on the menu tonight.&quot;</p>
