<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The Barber was surprised when two young teenagers entered his barbershop.  More specifically, two teenage girls holding hands. He catered exclusively to a male clientele, so two teenage girls entering his barbershop was the last thing he ever expected. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, girls,&quot; started the Barber, &quot;Is there something that I can help you with? If you want a haircut, there&#39;s an excellent hair stylist down the street. I think you&#39;d find her services more helpful than mine. Besides, I was just about to close up shop here,&quot; he said apologetically, hoping they&#39;d get out of his hair. <br />
<br />
The two girls began whispering to each other softly. One had raven-black hair that fell down to the small of her back, and the other was a chocolate-brown brunette with hair that pooled around her shoulders. Both were small, slight girls, and their high-pitched voices were hard for the barber to hear. Finally, the brunette nudged her black-haired counterpart in the ribs. She shook her head, but then the other teen nudged  her in the ribs again, and she gave a very adolescent groan of frustration. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; the Barber could hear the raven-haired girl say as she walked up to the Barber, clearing her throat. &quot;My friend and I...we&#39;ve heard rumors about this barbershop. Rumors that you could change people...&quot;<br />
<br />
The barber cut her off with a snort. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve heard that too,&quot; he said. &quot;But it&#39;s just a rumor, believe, me.&quot;<br />
<br />
The raven-haired girl shook her head violently. &quot;No, no!  We&#39;ve seen people enter here when your barbershop was closed, and different people have walked out! Like how when a black dude and a white man walked in with a kid,  and then two jacked black guys walked out with the kid!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You can&#39;t prove anything,&quot; said the Barber in a conspiratorial tone. &quot;Who&#39;s to say they were the same people?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Because we just know!&quot; Insisted the brunette, who had been quiet until now. &quot;Look, we really need your help!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Even if I could help, I have a strict no-minors policy here at my barbershop. It&#39;s just not right,&quot; said the Barber as he crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
Tears began to well up in the brunette&#39;s eyes, and the black-haired girl looked at the floor as she spoke to the Barber. &quot;We don&#39;t have anywhere else to go. Me and Lucy here....we&#39;re both in a...relationship together. Our parents really don&#39;t like it, and they&#39;re gonna throw us out of house! Please, you have to help us! We&#39;re just high-school juniors, we can&#39;t make it on our own! &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for you two, I really am,&quot; said the barber sympathetically. &quot;However, I can&#39;t go against my code. I can&#39;t break it.&quot;<br />
<br />
The black-haired girl started to tremble, and her face was almost red with anger. &quot;If you don&#39;t help us, we&#39;re going to tell everyone about your barbershop!&quot; She insisted. <br />
<br />
The Barber sighed, and massaged his temples. Typical teenagers. It really wasn&#39;t a choice he could make, though. he was bound by certain rules that transcended mortal understanding. He rubbed his chin, thinking. He did want to help the teens, but he had a strict policy against changing teens and kids. However, they did threaten to expose his barbershop&#39;s secrets. He ran the scenarios in his head, and nodded his head. Protecting the privacy of his barbershop was the ultimate rule, and if it came down to breaking a smaller rule to protect his barbershop, he was fairly certain that the powers that be would allow him to get away with it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine. You win,&quot; said the Barber, lifting up his hands as an admission of defeat. &quot;I&#39;ll give you what you want-new identities.&quot;<br />
<br />
Both girls sighed in relief, hugging each other. Lucy began rummaging through her purse, pulling out her credit card. &quot;Oh, thank you so much! How much will this cost?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;For you? It&#39;s free. But there&#39;s always a price,&quot; said the Barber ominously. &quot;Before we start, though, I&#39;d like to have your names.&quot; He pointed at the chocolate-haired brunette. &quot;I know your name is Lucy.&quot; He then pointed at the raven-haired girl. &quot;What&#39;s your name, though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Kathleen,&quot; said the girl quietly. <br />
<br />
The Barber nodded his head. &quot;Alright. Kathleen and Lucy, I can work with this.&quot; He gestured to two barber chairs. &quot;Here, why don&#39;t you get yourself seated before we get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two sat down in the barber chairs obediently, but Kathleen raised an eyebrow as the Barber put two tarps around their necks. &quot;Umm, I don&#39;t want to contradict you or anything, but don&#39;t people usually get their hair washed first, before they get it cut?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Usually,&quot; said the Barber, &quot;But you two are a special exception.&quot;<br />
<br />
The Barber then put their hair into very high and tight ponytails, smiling as a plan in his head unfolded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Special exception, you mean our age, right?&quot; Asked Kathleen. <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s one reason, yes,&quot; said the Barber curtly. <br />
<br />
Without further ado,  the Barber cut off their high ponytails, leaving them with short, chin-length bobs. Kathleen felt her mind blank, until she could feel her hair tickle her cheeks as she moved her head. She looked at Lucy and smiled. She had to admit, short hair looked good on her girlfriend. She was so glad they had come to the barber together to get their bobs touched up. She started to get up out of her chair, but the Barber pushed her back down. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, settle down there,&quot; chuckled the Barber. &quot;We&#39;re not done yet. I still have to make your hair shorter.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathleen opened her mouth to protest, but they died on her lips as the Barber pulled out a pair of clippers, and began to shave her nape. Her mind felt fuzzy, and she could&#39;ve sworn that her body felt like putty. And yet, with every pass of the Barber&#39;s clippers, her new-found doubt was eliminated. She calmed down as the Barber shaved off more and more of her hair,  not noticing Lucy&#39;s body beginning to change, nor her own body shift. Everything felt just right. <br />
<br />
The Barber smiled as he made the first pass off the clippers. Both their faces lost some roundness, their chins and jawlines becoming slightly more defined. Another pass of the clippers, and more hair fell on the floor. A dusting of fine hairs appeared on their arms and legs. Another pass of the clippers, and their breasts shrank away, reduced to regular pecs. The barber made a long pass on top of their head, making their faces like more masculine than ever before. The two girls smiled as they dozed off, not noticing their feminine slits slowly become thinner smaller. Their clits slowly engorged in size, and moved downwards like a thick worm. A slit lined their big clits, and a urethra formed, heralding the arrival of their penises. Testicles soon followed, and the rush of testosterone meant a sprinkling of hairs around their armpits and groin. Their masculine members throbbed proudly, becoming engorged with blood as they slept, making their rest erotic and intense. <br />
<br />
The barber stepped back and looked at his clients. Two teenaged boys were resting in his salon chairs. Both were small and pale for their age. Both boys had half-inch buzzcuts, but one&#39;s trimmed hair was chocolate-brown, and the other&#39;s was raven-black. He smiled as they groaned and moaned in their sleep, neither teen accustomed to the pleasure of being male. This was the part where he&#39;d study them, and change them further...but into what? <br />
<br />
A mischievous thought entered the barber&#39;s mind. He already wasn&#39;t supposed to be giving them haircuts...so what harm could it be to make them even younger? Besides, he assured himself, he could change them even more later. He just never got the chance to make people truly young. He had been doing this job for so long, but he kept doing the same changes over and over again. It was time to experiment some more. And if he didn&#39;t like how they turned out, he&#39;d just change them some more. The Barber attached a more severe blade to his clippers, that would give them shorter buzz cuts. With the clippers humming he began to trim off even more hair.<br />
<br />
The first pass of the clippers made his clients groan some more. Their members were shrinking, dwindling, becoming scrawny and prepubescent. Another pass of the clippers, and their members developed heavy foreskins. Another pass of the clippers, and their ball sacks drew upwards, literally undropping. As soon as this happened, their groans and moans took on a boyish cast. Another pass of the shears, and all their body hair drew inwards, disappearing, making their bodies smooth. Only a few blonde hairs remained around their legs, groin, and armpits, heralding the imminent arrival of puberty. Speaking of blonde, another pass of the Barber&#39;s clippers, and his client&#39;s brown-and-black hair both turned into a uniformly baby-blonde color, softer and thicker than ever before. The two blonde boys smiled dreamily as the barber finished up their short buzzcuts. They were both blissfully asleep as the barber worked, their personality, their memories, and their minds slowly shaping, slowly becoming boyish. Their minds emptied of years of schooling, and the gaps were replaced with video-game knowledge and youtube videos. They were like books that the Barber was slowly editing and rewriting.<br />
<br />
***********************************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
Kathleen was in the deepest sleep of her life. Her bobbed hair bounced as she walked down a dark hallway. A small figure at the end waved to her, motioning her closer.&quot;Umm, do you know where we are?&quot; Asked Kathleen. She studied the youth in front of her. He was adorable, with an almost cherubic face and his baby-blonde hair had been shorn into a short and fuzzy buzzcut. He was wearing a white polo shirt and khaki pants, his shirt emblazoned with the logo of a local middle school. <br />
<br />
The youth studied her with his big emerald green-eyes. He giggled softly and put his arms behind his back, rocking back and forth. &quot;I dunno,&quot; he said with the blunt honesty of a child. He deflected her question with a question of his own. &quot;Why&#39;re you here?&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathleen scratched her raven-black hair. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she said defensively. &quot;I think I&#39;m supposed to be getting a haircut.&quot;<br />
<br />
The boy nodded with complete understanding. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ve got a lot of blonde hair, you need a haircut.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kathleen blinked. &quot;Wait....blonde? I&#39;m not blonde!&quot; She insisted.<br />
<br />
The boy shook his head and smiled mischievously at Kathleen.As baby-blonde hair fell into  Kathleen&#39;s vision, he stood on his tiptoes and chuckled at Kathleen. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re blonde to me!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m...blonde?&quot; Asked Kathleen out loud, almost to herself. She studied the blonde strands of hair that kept falling into her vision. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;ve always been blonde, silly,&quot; insisted the boy. <br />
<br />
Kathleen opened her mouth to disagree, but a haze settled on her mind. Suddenly, she wasn&#39;t quite so sure what her original hair color was. <br />
<br />
&quot;You love being blonde,&quot; said the youth, like it was the most matter-of-fact thing in the world. <br />
<br />
Kathleen nodded, soaking in the boy&#39;s words. She loved being blonde. Being blonde was the best thing in the world. She patted the youth&#39;s head, doting over his hair. &quot;Our blonde hair is amazing,&quot; cooed Kathleen.&quot;<br />
<br />
The blonde boy made a retching sound as Kathleen touched his hair, and stuck his tongue out at Kathleen. &quot;Yuck! Girls like you are so gross!&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead of protesting, Kathleen emphatically agreed. &quot;Yeah, girls are pretty nasty. Who could ever like them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not me,&quot; giggled the boy. &quot;And not you. You&#39;re a guy too, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
A shudder ran through Kathleen&#39;s dream body. It warped and distorted, and where had once been Kathleen, was now Colin. He ran a hand through his thick blonde buzzcut and grinned at the other boy, showing off his braces &quot;I&#39;ve always been a boy,&quot; said Colin. &quot;Why&#39;re you asking me such weird questions?&quot; He laughed in his high-pitched voice and followed the youth down the tunnel,  having completely forgotten that he had ever been a teenage girl called Kathleen. And as he passed through the light of the tunnel, he woke up. <br />
<br />
Colin yawned cutely as he woke up, licking his braces. He knew that he just had a really good dream, but he was having a hard time trying to remember it. He looked at the blonde youth next to him, and grinned. Of course Louis would still be asleep. Louis, that word almost felt foreign to him for a second. But that&#39;s outrageous. Louis had been his best friend ever since he was a little kid, why would the word Louis sound weird in his head? He walked over to his friend and shook him awake. The two youths looked very similar, but where Louis had bright blue eyes, Colin&#39;s were a bright green. Louis yawned as he woke up, and he slowly got out of the barber-chair. The two of them were wearing white polo shirts and khaki shorts, the uniform of their local middle school. They studied their reflections intently in the mirror. They both thought they looked really good, but for some reason, there was a nagging sensation in the back of their mind, as if something was trying to tell them something. But that thought was interrupted by the Barber.<br />
<br />
&quot;Slept well, Louis and Colin? I see that you two like your hair....you&#39;re free to go now, if you want,&quot; said the Barber. &quot;I was touching up your hair and you fell asleep. If you&#39;d like, though, I could work on you some more.  What do you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
Colin jerked his head at Louis, and the two walked over to a corner of the barbershop, away from the Barber. &quot;Our hair looks really really good,&quot; said Colin as he ran a hand through his buzzed hair.<br />
<br />
Louis studied his reflection closely and grinned, showing off his braces. &quot;Yeah, we do look good. But the Barber said he had more that he could do with our hair....shouldn&#39;t we listen to him?&quot; <br />
<br />
The two blonde youths continued whispering to each other, trying to figure out what they should do next. They could trust the barber, right?<br />
<br />
The Barber smiled at the two youthful blank slates in off in the corner, both adorably blonde and tow-headed. They were sweet and innocent, their female identities completely replaced by boyish thoughts and boyish concerns. He rubbed his hands eagerly together. There were so many changes he could make, he hoped that his ex-female clients wanted to continue.</p>
