<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>The original author has said he/she ran out of ideas for the story. I am adding a chapter here in order to give the story a boost. This chapter is (imho) the best place for it to go on. So far we have a set-up however we are missing a goal and a real protagonist with a call to action. I hope to give this here.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jake walks through the school&#39;s halls with Sparky on his heels. Jake&#39;s face is red and moist. Sparky is right on his heels sticking his nose high and filled with an alluring scent. After a few seconds the couple reach a large door. A small stream of wind is cooling the corridor from the opening and the smell of fresh leaves is increasingly present as they get closer to the opening.<br />
<br />
Jake bites his lips as he walks through the door. He feels the ground under his feet shift as the tiles are replaced with the asphalt of the small courtyard behind the school. Jake spots a few trash containers that are filled to the brim in the corner of the yard.<br />
<br />
The smell of the riping trash was more than a little noticeable but the changes that anyone would see him there were minuscule. Once Jake deemed himself safe he got on his knees his 14 inch hard-on hitting him the in stomach. Sparky took the hint and started working on Jakes his pants. His nose moist against the fabric that was already lubricated by Jake&#39;s own needs. Sparky suddenly bit and tore a small hole in Jake his pant exposing him to the world. Free to breathe the wind took his pheromone scent far and Sparky could no longer hold it.<br />
<br />
Jake&#39;s palms scratched the asphalt as let Sparky do what he wanted. This is what he needed he was sure of it. The warm hard flesh of Sparky his underside struck Jake his behind with need but not with accuracy. Getting a bit frustrated with the lack of release Jake was feeling he reached out behind him with one of his hands and guided Sparky to his awaiting hole. With this aid sparky finally managed to nail it and him.  <br />
<br />
Jake first wanted to cry out in pleasure. this was the greatest thing he had ever felt in his life. However, his cry of joy was suppressed by a sudden flood of memories. Kyle, the curse he remembered everything. He was paralyzed with pleasure and dread as his body automatically motioned in rhythm with Sparky his thrusts. Every hump gave Jake more pleasure and drove Sparky deeper into him until finally, Sparky&#39;s knot breached Jake&#39;s canine vagina. The bonding send an explosion of pleasure through both man and beast. <br />
<br />
As jake opened his eyes he found himself in a small pool of white on the ground. Recovering from the pleasure Jake tried to push Sparky off him. A pain went through him and Sparky gave a whine as he did so. They truly were stuck for a while. Being bonded like this still gave Jake a bit of pleasure but he soon felt tears run over his cheeks. The image of Kyle&#39;s smug face entered his mind and he hit his fist on the ground the pain providing a small distraction as he cursed. <br />
<br />
Whilst laying on the ground jake looked down.m At least his penis was back to its original size but now it looked even smaller than before as it was sealed in a canine shaft that was covered in fur the same color as this hair. Oh, the things he would do to Kyle. He was physically stronger and now he also had the curse to use. He would make that nerd his life a living hell.<br />
<br />
Jake was lost in his revenge fantasy when a shriek demanded his attention. Looking up he saw a familiar face. It was his girlfriend Jennifer that looked shocked down at him. Jake shot upright causing the slowly shrinking knot to pop free and un-bonding him from Sparky. Jake was about to try and explain his situation as his face went blank. He looked down then up and then back to Jenn.<br />
<br />
&quot;He babe I was just letting Sparky out to do his business I would love to chat but I really should go back to class&quot; As jake started walking back to the entrance he felt behind and noticed that he had a tear in his pants. How had he not noticed this happening? He really had to go past his locked and get another pair of pants.<br />
<br />
Jennifer was silent. She stared blankly after Jake as he entered the school with Sparky in tow. This had to be the weirdest dream ever. She raised her hand to her cheek. The pain shot through her as she pinched leaving a small red mark.<br />
&quot;No way!&quot; she finally remarked. <br />
<br />
Reality finally dawned on her. The implications of what she had just witnessed were just as bad as the scene itself.<br />
&quot;I am not going to lose my popular boyfriend to a dog! What the hell had gotten into him!&quot;</p>
