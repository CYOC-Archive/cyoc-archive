<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Danny had been feeling out of place at school all day. He couldn&#39;t quite place what felt so different. It was like everyone was looking at him with this strange look but it was also one he couldn&#39;t place. Most of the time people would just ignore him because of his size. Consider him some kind of bully just because he was twice their size. But this time it was different. It was like they were looking at him because he was out of place. Like he wasn&#39;t supposed to be in their classrooms or something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey there big guy!&quot; Zeke wrapped his arm around Danny pulling the other big guy in for a one armed hug. Zeke was about the only guy in school that could make him feel small. But even right now, that didn&#39;t seem accurate. When Danny normally talked to him, it was eye to eye. But now there seemed to be an inch or two where Danny was taller. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sup,&quot; Danny tilted his head back a bit to show that he recognized Zeke as a friend. <br />
<br />
Though there must have been some kind of expression that was out of the norm. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Zeke asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; Danny lied. He wasn&#39;t about to bring his friend into his problem. Especially when he didn&#39;t understand it, there was no way Zeke would understand either. <br />
<br />
Zeke nodded knowingly. &quot;Just be glad it&#39;s weight training.&quot; He pulled out something that looked like a phone, then started typing something into it. <br />
<br />
Danny nodded and started changing. But instead of changing into his sleeveless shirt and gym shorts, he found a navy blue polo with khaki pants in his locker. Before he realized what he was doing, he&#39;d pulled the pants up over his waist and buttoned them. He paused, looking at the mirror on the other end of the locker room. &#39;Was I always this big?&#39; a bit of a grin crossed his bearded face. Facial hair that would have taken a year to grow and wasn&#39;t there this morning filled his jaw. It was the same with his chest as a bit of fur was starting to grow where it had been bare. He&#39;d remembered hearing about some of the guys using the stuff he&#39;d bought growing a bunch of hair, but they had been using it for years. <br />
<br />
&quot;You daydreaming?&quot; Coach Williams gave him a slap to Danny&#39;s broad shoulders. &quot;C&#39;mon bud. We&#39;ve got to make sure no one hurts themselves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny&#39;s brain paused for a second. &quot;Right...&quot; he agreed. Something felt a bit off, but he couldn&#39;t tell what it was. &quot;Be right there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Coach Williams left the locker room and headed over to the weight room. <br />
<br />
It took Danny a bit to get the polo over his body. The way his muscles were, they worked more against each other than together. Being so large and round, he could barely move. But the shirt still slid down. Even if it did take more effort than other guys, though it was with it being that big. Once it was over his thick body, he let out a bit of a snort. The shirt clung to every bit of him. He might as well have been shirtless as his two hard pecs were clearly visible. Even his nipples were poking through. His bulky arms completely filled the sleeves, stretching them to almost breaking. <br />
<br />
Danny had a smile on his face as he headed for the weight room. It didn&#39;t matter how big Danny was, he never felt it. That&#39;s why he&#39;d tried that stuff. Being big wasn&#39;t a want. It was a need. He had to feel bigger. Stronger than anyone else. It was something that drove him. Even as he stood in the weight room, being far larger than anyone there, he still didn&#39;t feel big enough.<br />
<br />
In the corner Coach Williams was helping several of the athletes. He had to make sure they were actually doing workouts and not just goofing off. He was on the other side with Zeke, Matt and Conner. The three didn&#39;t have much in common. Zeke being on his phone was a testament to that as he ignored the other two. Meanwhile Matt was struggling with the light weights and Conner was snidely looking over his shoulder at him as he easily lifted two 50 pound dumbbells. The jock always had a bit of an attitude, even if it could be considered deserved, that didn&#39;t make it any less annoying.<br />
<br />
&quot;C&#39;mon man,&quot; Danny said to Zeke, giving him a light slap with the back of his hand. &quot;At least pretend like you&#39;re doing something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Zeke quickly straightened up. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; he said dutifully. Even he seemed a bit shocked by the submissive nature he had displayed. But he still slid his phone into his pocket and went over to help out Matt.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Conner looked to be a bit confused. Especially as he was still holding the 50 pound weights. &quot;The hell?&quot; he muttered setting them back down. He shook his body as though he was still trying to warm up. His normally cocky attitude seemed to have turned into a bit more of confusion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Danny asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Wrong?&quot; Conner questioned the thought. &quot;Yeah... But...&quot; he mind seemed to have stopped as he tried to put it into words. For some reason he felt weak. Incredibly so. His body seemed to have done it out of habit, but now it didn&#39;t feel quite right. &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; he finally answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmm... Well don&#39;t push yourself too hard bud. Don&#39;t want any injuries now, do we?&quot; Danny gave him a hearty slap to the back, knocking the wind out of Conner. &quot;Oops... Sorry, bout that bud.&quot;<br />
<br />
Conner adjusted his glasses. &#39;Did he always have those?&#39; Danny thought for a second but then was distracted by what he said. &quot;It&#39;s alright coach,&quot; Conner&#39;s voice cracked and he instantly tried to hide in on himself. It was always a bit weird that the 18 year old would wear such a large sleeveless shirt to the gym, when he was practically swimming in the thing. But the more Danny stared, the smaller Conner seemed to be getting. Or was the shirt getting larger. Either way, the strap was starting to fall over his narrow shoulders. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ri-right,&quot; Danny cleared his throat as he forced himself to look away from the student. Even though he knew Danny was 18 there was a strange boyish charm that seemed to be really attractive to him all of a sudden. Danny adjusted his khakis. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll leave you to it then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Coach,&quot; Conner grabbed Danny&#39;s polo and held onto it. &quot;Got any pointers?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny cleared his throat again. &quot;Pointers?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. Pointers,&quot; Conner said. His big brown eyes looked up to Danny like he was an absolute hero. <br />
<br />
&quot;Pointers... Hmm...&quot; Danny had looked away again, resting his finger and thumb on his hairy chin. He had been trying to figure a way out of the situation, but Conner was clearly pulling him back in. He&#39;d heard rumors from the other students that Conner only joined the gym class because he was teaching it. Those rumors were looking to be fairly clear as even without flexing, the small man continued to trace every inch of Danny&#39;s beefy body with his eyes. &#39;Fuck,&#39; Danny felt his cock throb at the thought of being objectified by the student. High school was barely six years ago, but it felt like just this morning he too had been a student. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ve got a few,&quot; he answered. &quot;Let&#39;s get you a correct weight and then go from there.&quot;<br />
<br />
He led Conner down to the much lighter weights and let the boy pick up a couple of 10 pound ones. &quot;We&#39;ll start with curls,&quot; Danny said. He watched as Conner attempted the exercise but decided that wasn&#39;t good enough for him. He squatted down, removing the foot in height he had over the other man and nestled his furry face in the nape of Conner&#39;s neck. The smaller man squirmed as Danny&#39;s thick beard rubbed against his sensitive skin. &quot;That&#39;s gooood...&quot; he made it almost sound like a moan as his hand reached out and grabbed Conner&#39;s arm.<br />
<br />
The size difference was immense as Danny&#39;s thick meaty hand easily wrapped around Conner&#39;s bicep. The rough callouses slid against Conner&#39;s sensitive skin. &quot;See,&quot; Danny continued. &quot;When you raise the weight, you should feel it right here.&quot; His finger and thumb gently squeezed the muscle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh-huh...&quot; Conner nodded, accidently rubbing the beard against his neck more sending the tickling sensation through his body. He found himself bumbling around slightly, but mostly rubbing against Coach Danny&#39;s thick body. Only to also find the little secret that the older man was hiding as well. Calling it little was a bit of an understatement as even through his shorts and Danny&#39;s pants, there was a clear bulge that could fit right between his cheeks. Instinct took over and he thrust backwards.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey now,&quot; Danny smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t make too many sudden movements. That could be bad for you...&quot; One of his big hands were making it down Conner&#39;s side and into his baggy shorts. It quickly wrapped around his tight butt and a finger slid in between Conner&#39;s cheeks. The small man instantly straightened up. Giving a little, &#39;EEP!&#39; &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Danny continued. His finger gently rubbed against the tight hole, barely pushing in at all. He could see the lack of experience written all over the little guy&#39;s face. &quot;Everyone has to start somewhere. Right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right,&quot; Conner confirmed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you want to start?&quot;<br />
<br />
Conner nodded. His breathing had become uneven as he felt his dick jump with excitement. His body kept twisting and turning into the massive coach behind him. Just feeling his strong hand holding his small body so tightly, filled him with excitement. Maybe a bit too much as just the slightest bit of infiltration sent him over the edge. He felt his asshole opened and instantly came. His body thrust several times, but Danny held him tightly, giving him a bit of a condescending laugh. <br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll have to try again later,&quot; he smirked. Which prompted a happy nod from Conner.</p>
