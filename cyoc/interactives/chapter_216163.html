<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This was a commission. I hope this person enjoys!</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike was on the couch with Delilah, her hand rubbing his thighs, when the Chronivac initiated.<br />
<br />
She was clearly not paying attention to the game, though that meant nothing to Mike. His Claspers were both erect, tenting his wetsuit. She kissed his chin and he carefully kissed her back. <br />
<br />
He could hear a strange whir and hum from upstairs but thought nothing of it.<br />
<br />
Delilah started growing larger in his arms, her muscles pulsating and heaving rounder. He slid claws over skin that was growing smoother, tougher, and rubbery. Something pressed out the seat of her dress and she grunted uncomfortably.  They shifted together on the couch as her tail grew awkwardly, curving up the cushions. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the back of the couch gave way, and both of the aquatic anthro’s tails were able to rest comfortably behind them. <br />
<br />
Her hand, which was more like a catcher’s mitt in size and shape, began to rub Mike’s crotch. Mike spread his muscular legs, giving her better access, and marveled as she gently opened his wetsuit and stroked off both of his cocks.<br />
<br />
Mike couldn’t help but return the favor, his clawed hand unzipping an outfit that was rapidly becoming a mirror of his own-just a plain wetsuit- and softly rubbed her clit. Her insides clenched around his digit as he penetrated her. She moaned, voice oddly deep, and then her passage twisted and disgorged his finger in one strong muscular action.<br />
<br />
The orca leaned back as her clit plumped and thickened into a fat cock and her ovaries became cum-swollen balls the size of softballs.<br />
<br />
Mike blinked, pulling his hand out of Dave’s wetsuit. Why had he been jerking off the big male orca? Mike wasn’t gay and neither was Dave. He glanced down, noticing the orca’s hand’s stroking his erect shafts. <br />
<br />
They... they were just friends, right?<br />
<br />
The muscular shark and big orca were both in the same unit. Dave had actually been the first of the two of them to get the treatment, Mike’s came a year later. The eggheads at the lab had wanted to try with a mammal first before they jumped to sharks.<br />
<br />
The orca pulled his hands out of Mike’s wetsuit and the two aqua-morphs stared at each other awkwardly.<br />
<br />
“Uh, sorry Dave, don’t know what got into me.” Mike coughed, trying not to look the big orca in the eyes.<br />
<br />
“It’s, um, fine, Mike.” Dave swallowed, blushing, and turned to the bowl of fresh-caught tuna. “F-fish?”<br />
<br />
Neither had noticed their snacks turn into a plate of fresh fish. They also hadn’t noticed the house beginning to shift around them as reality began to adjust to the presence of the two anthros. The Chronivac was quite thorough in the adjustments it made.<br />
<br />
Mike gratefully accepted the fish, devouring it hungrily, glad he had an excuse to not talk. He could see Dave giving him looks out of the corner of his eye and blushed. They weren’t supposed to fraternize like this, but man, now that they’d touched each other’s dicks, he was seeing the huge orca in a completely different light.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, the announcer started screaming.<br />
<br />
Mike turned his attention back to the football game. His heart skipped a beat. One of the players had the ball and he was running, running. Three men tried to tackle him but he dodged and weaved and he was going… to… score… GOAL!<br />
<br />
Mike and Dave stood and cheered happily.<br />
<br />
They sat back down as the house began to ripple, walls growing more hi-tech, wood-paneling becoming a sterile off-white colored plasteel. The backyard was suddenly gone as the house shifted onto the beach. Like Mike’s home, where the backdoor had been, there was now a diving pool.<br />
<br />
A soft rushing sound heralded the gush of seawater across the kitchen and dining room floors. It circulated and cleansed the formerly carpeted floor. Everything was sterile tile and soft recess lighting. The living room and foyer were essentially untouched, save for the carpet being water resistant and purposefully built to not rot from excess moisture.<br />
<br />
The entertainment center got grander, Dave’s TV becoming a huge, slightly curved flatscreen with an amazing sound system. <br />
<br />
Mike and Dave sat back down, both hands going for a new beer at the same time. Their hands touched and they looked at each other.<br />
<br />
“Sorry,” Dave said, pulling his hand back.<br />
<br />
“T-thanks,” Mike replied, pulling out a beer and taking a long swig as an excuse to look away.<br />
<br />
The massive orca took his can.<br />
<br />
Mike could feel the orca’s eyes on him as he gulped more beer. <br />
<br />
There was a cheer from the screen as the Cowboys stole the ball and the orca looked away.<br />
<br />
Mike eyed Dave up while the orca was staring enraptured at the screen.<br />
<br />
He had a firm gut composed of heavy muscles smoothed by a layer of rubbery hide. The wetsuit did little to hide the hills and valleys of his perfectly sculpted form. Mike watched the orca’s massive chest shift with each rise and fall of breath, still distantly aware that his cocks were hard again, tenting his wetsuit.<br />
<br />
Dave glanced over at him and Mike turned back to the TV, blushing fiercely, his blue cheeks turning purple.<br />
<br />
A massive hand fell on his thigh.<br />
<br />
Mike’s cocks twitched at Dave’s touch.<br />
<br />
“I’m really glad you came over, Mike.” Dave said softly.<br />
<br />
Mike turned and met Dave’s liquid blue eyes just in time for them to change color, becoming gold. <br />
<br />
“I-I’m glad I came over too.” Mike replied.<br />
<br />
Dave leaned forward, and Mike could smell the tasty fish and beer on his breath. He found himself leaning forward too. Their lips met and it was electric.<br />
<br />
Their kiss deepened, the orca running his tongue across Mike’s teeth while Mike probed the orca’s own fanged mouth. His claws gripped the orca’s hide. They didn’t punch through the tough blubbery skin, and Mike relaxed. He wasn’t going to break the great whale. His own hand fell on Dave’s massive cock, feeling it throb in his palm.<br />
<br />
“I’ve wanted you so bad, Mike.” Dave murmured into the kiss.<br />
<br />
“You’ve got me, big guy.” Mike managed. “But what if the kids-?”<br />
<br />
“The clones,” Dave interrupted, pulling down the zipper on Mike’s wetsuit. “They won’t mind at all. They’re us, after all.”<br />
<br />
The two paused in their passion only to strip. Mike’s twin cocks were throbbing from a slit in his groin, his balls throbbing inside of him. Dave’s cock was also just outside a vent as well, his balls equally protected internally. Then Mike was on top of Dave, running his claws over his slick bulky form, marveling at his huge cock.<br />
<br />
“You like it?” Dave smirked.<br />
<br />
Mike nodded.<br />
<br />
Dave flipped the shark over. Mike gasped, feeling suddenly vulnerable beneath the black and white behemoth.  The orca lifted Mike’s legs, exposing the gray pucker at the base of his tail. Then he bent forward and Mike felt a warm tongue lap at his entrance, prodding it firmly.<br />
<br />
“Wha-what are you doing?” Mike asked, his voice breaking.<br />
<br />
“Getting you lubed up like I always do.” Dave smiled lovingly. <br />
<br />
“Like you always-? Oh!” Mike gasped as the tongue wormed its way inside of him.<br />
<br />
At first, it was awkward and uncomfortable. Then, as Dave struggled to fit more of his tongue past Mike’s clenching ring, the muscle simply stretched, the flesh yielding. Mike felt himself suddenly relax down there as though he’d been doing it for years.<br />
<br />
The shark could only groan as the orca’s tongue burrowed deeper inside of him, slicking his inner passages. It was almost enough to send him over the edge, especially when that thick tongue brushed past a spot inside of him that made Mike squeal and shiver in delight. <br />
<br />
Dave withdrew his tongue, satisfied with how lubed Mike’s passage was, and then positioned his massive cock at the shark’s entrance.<br />
<br />
All the air left Mike’s lungs in a soft wheeze as the orca’s dick pressed into him. His ring spasmed and loosened with every inch until the orca was gliding inside of him. The shark’s claws scrabbled against the orca’s back as he was filled with whale cock.<br />
<br />
“Ngh! Dave!” Mike cried as the orca hilted in him, his tailhole distended around the massive throbbing organ. “Mmff! Please!”<br />
<br />
The orca smirked and withdrew only to slam himself back in, burying his ebony pillar deep inside the shark. <br />
<br />
Mike moaned as the orca took him, incapable of doing anything but clinging to the overly-muscled behemoth.  His cocks lay against his cobblestone abs and drooled precum. While the orca railed him, the room began to change in more subtle ways.<br />
<br />
The photos on the walls changed, Dave and Jeff appearing in the orca’s photos. As the orca blew his load inside the shark, gold bands appeared on their fingers. And as they lay panting in a happy afterglow, Dave recalled having married the big orca.<br />
<br />
The two anthros kissed and cleaned up a bit before going back to watching the game.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=--=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-==-<br />
<br />
Jeff and Finn were at the computer looking over all of their options, a notepad out.<br />
<br />
“So maybe we can make ourselves rich?” Finn said.<br />
<br />
“In a round-about way,” Jeff nodded, pointing at several options.<br />
<br />
Finn was scribbling some of the possibilities down on the notepad when his fist tensed and flexed, growing larger.<br />
<br />
Neither of the boys noticed as the house shifted around them, the walls becoming the same sterile material everything else was made out of. Even the quiet susurration of seawater moving across the floor went unnoticed, though Finn shivered from the cold.<br />
<br />
Finn grew, body bulking and expanding with muscle. <br />
<br />
It was only when Jeff looked up and found himself staring into Finn’s golden eyes that he realized something had changed.<br />
<br />
“Finn?” Jeff asked, eyeing the orca critically. <br />
<br />
“What?” The orca said, and Jeff noticed he was a spitting image of his mom-err, father- downstairs.<br />
<br />
“Do you… notice anything different about you?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
“No,” The orca leaned back, his huge muscles bulging. “Did something change? I thought you were only doing my father?”<br />
<br />
A heavy puff of air blew out of the orca’s blowhole. Jeff stared as he realized exactly what might have happened. He’d changed Finn’s mother into his father and, like with Jeff when he’d altered his father, reality had shifted.<br />
<br />
Unlike him, however, Finn clearly had no recollection of being anything else. Why in the world… ?<br />
<br />
Jeff went back through his previous change and looked at the options he’d checked. Reality alteration – obviously - but he was sure he’d kept Finn aware. He flipped through the options and confirmed it. Finn should recall having a mother, not a father.<br />
<br />
“So your mother was changed earlier, right?” Jeff probed.<br />
<br />
“Mother?” Finn chuckled. “Come on, you know better. We’re clones. We have no mothers.”<br />
<br />
That made no sense. Jeff double-checked the settings. Wait, reality shift trickling down… could it be that the accidental reality shift had also altered Finn’s memories? And if so, why was Jeff aware of everything?<br />
<br />
At first, looking through the program, he couldn’t see anything, but then his eyes feel on an asterisk in the reality-alteration option. He clicked it and read further. Apparently, registered users had partial immunity to it all.<br />
<br />
“So are we gonna be rich or are we gonna have to become Navy SEALS like our dads?” Finn asked.<br />
<br />
“What?”<br />
<br />
“Jeff,” Finn shook his head, “you’re freaking me out right now. Come on, why else did they create clones of the best soldiers in the world?”<br />
<br />
“To...” Jeff’s eyes widened. “Oh no!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, oh no, that’s why we’re using the Chronivac.” Finn rolled his eyes. “Don’t tell me you accidentally erased your own memories, you goof!”<br />
<br />
“No, I didn’t,” Jeff said, looking back at the screen. “How the hell do I fix this?”<br />
<br />
“Is there an ‘undo’ button?” Finn shrugged.<br />
<br />
Jeff wanted to roll his eyes, and then noticed the undo symbol. “Uh, yes.”<br />
<br />
“Then just hit that.” Finn sighed.<br />
<br />
Jeff did, but a warning popped up.<br />
<br />
‘Error-cannot undo last change. Reality alteration still in progress.’<br />
<br />
“Huh,” Finn leaned over Jeff’s shoulder to look at the screen, his fishy breath making Jeff squinch his nostrils. “Guess you just have to ride it out until it’s done.”<br />
<br />
“Yeah,” Jeff turned to look at the orca, “I guess I-”<br />
<br />
Finn kissed him on the mouth.<br />
<br />
Jeff stared at the orca in shock as Finn’s big hands encircled him. He found himself being lifted up off the chair and set gently on the ground. Seawater flowed around his body as the orca continued making out with him.<br />
<br />
By the time he’d come to his senses, Finn was removing both of their wetsuits. <br />
<br />
“Hey, what are you-” Jeff said, and then the orca’s tongue was in his mouth again.<br />
<br />
“Just relax, babe,” Finn said softly, kissing down the shark’s neck and chest. “You’re getting upset. Let me ground you.”<br />
<br />
Jeff found his legs being lifted over the orca’s shoulders and squirmed as Finn’s warm tongue probed his entrance.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t right, Finn wasn’t gay he-NNf!<br />
<br />
To his surprise, the shark’s tight ring simply gave way to the organ probing his tailhole. Like they’d done this often. Almost like he was a bottom and the big orca eating him out was a top. He moaned as the tongue brushed past his prostate as it explored his inner passage.<br />
<br />
He wanted to give in, let the orca take him right then and there. Even his pucker was relaxing, the shark’s own body shifting with reality as he was reshaped into the orca’s perfect bottom. He found himself lovingly stroking Finn&#39;s smooth, rubbery head, encouraging his tongue deeper-<br />
<br />
No!<br />
<br />
Jeff shook the thoughts away. He could turn the tide, take charge. Reality hadn’t solidified yet. He could still-Ngh! Do something.<br />
<br />
But the tongue was warm and big and inside of him. Each lap sent shivers through his body. Jeff’s nipples were hard as a rock and he found himself pressing the orca’s blunt muzzle deeper. The muscles in his sphincter quivered for a moment. <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a happy sigh of pleasure. The muscles simply gave up and let the tongue glide into Jeff with little resistance. With that, Jeff relaxed and let the whale eat him out, soft little gasps of pleasure all he could muster in protest.<br />
<br />
Finn pulled his tongue out of Jeff’s loose tailhole and licked his lips.<br />
<br />
“Feeling better babe?”<br />
<br />
Jeff swallowed, wanting to nod, but he felt his inner voice roar to the forefront.<br />
<br />
“I wanna top today.” Jeff heard himself say.<br />
<br />
The orca cocked his head. “Sure, I guess. I’m a little tight-”<br />
<br />
Jeff rolled Finn over with a mighty heave and found himself straddling the orca’s muscle gut, unsure of where to start. He was a bottom like his father, after all. But… no, that wasn’t right, was it? <br />
<br />
Oh god, there wasn’t much time. <br />
<br />
The changes were beginning to solidify and if he didn’t want to be taking orca cock up his ass for the rest of his life, he needed to act fast. Sticking a finger in his mouth, moistened it, then gently inserted it into the orca’s ring.<br />
<br />
Finn hadn’t been lying, his ring WAS tight. <br />
<br />
Trying to be as gentle as he could afford to be, Jeff wriggled his finger deep. Finn gasped as the shark prodded his prostate with his claw. At first, nothing happened. Then, the more Jeff played with the orca’s ass, the ring began to feel a bit looser.<br />
<br />
Jeff stuck another finger inside Finn’s clenching insides. Slowly, the orca’s pucker stretched. Finn lay back and began to relax. By the time Jeff had his fist inside up to the wrist, the orca was moaning and writhing loudly.<br />
<br />
Pulling his fist out with a lewd squelch, it was Jeff’s turn to lift the orca’s legs over his shoulder.<br />
<br />
“You ready, babe?” Jeff asked.<br />
<br />
The orca just nodded.<br />
<br />
Jeff pressed both of his members together and shoved them into the orca’s rubbery tailhole. They slid in like they belonged there, and Jeff grit his teeth at the sensations of his two cocks being squeezed together.<br />
<br />
It was still a tight fight, but Jeff found himself thrusting in and out, each buck and roll of his hips eliciting another moan from Finn. Somehow, that only made Jeff harder. His cocks were oozing precum and it only eased their plunge into the whale’s depths.<br />
<br />
The sound of lovemaking filled the room and Jeff plowed his new boyfriend.<br />
<br />
They bucked and rutted hard, but for some reason, Jeff couldn’t get off. He was riding the precipice the whole time but couldn’t quite get over the edge. Jeff wondered what was missing-<br />
<br />
There was a *pop* and suddenly something huge was filling his asshole. <br />
<br />
Jeff let out a shriek as it stretched his loose hole deep and wide.<br />
<br />
“Need a little help, babe?” Finn asked with a sly smile.<br />
<br />
Jeff couldn’t breathe, he was so full. He’d stopped thrusting, but then Finn reached around behind him and grabbed the huge dildo that had lodged itself in Jeff’s ass and began pumping it in and out.<br />
<br />
“F-Finn!” Jeff gasped for air, “S-stop! I’m gonna-”<br />
<br />
“I know, babe. You can’t get off without a fat orca cock in your ass, just like daddy.” Finn smirked pumping the toy faster. <br />
<br />
“N-no, stop, I’m n-not-oh!” Jeff cried, feeling himself stiffen as the lubed toy smacked against his prostate.<br />
<br />
This wasn’t what he’d wanted! Finn was turning him into a bottom that liked playing at being top! H-he had to stop it before he came and the changes solidified-<br />
<br />
“Please-Oh!” Jeff groaned helplessly, feeling his orgasm rise and crest and his body thrusting involuntarily.  “P-please, please, please!” <br />
<br />
Finn buried the shark’s head between his massive pecs. Jeff whimpered and twitched, trying to hold back the flood, but he was gonna-<br />
<br />
Was gonna- <br />
<br />
“Cum inside me, babe,” Finn whispered. <br />
<br />
As though the whale’s permission was all he’d needed, he felt his body seize up. With a cry and a shudder, Jeff’s orgasm rushed over him like a tidal wave. He flooded the orca’s insides with shark seed and they panted together, enjoying the afterglow.<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, Finn got up and wandered over to his wall, where Jeff was surprised to see a variety of sex toys. Taking down a buttplug that looked remarkably like Jeff’s twin cock, Finn got some lube and gently inserted it into his ass. <br />
<br />
“Why do you have a buttplug in the shape of my cock?” Jeff managed.<br />
<br />
“Well, if you want to play at top, I just figured it might be good to keep myself stretched.” Finn winked.<br />
<br />
They both knew Finn was right. Jeff only liked topping now as an act of defiance to the cloning. At some point in the near future, Jeff would go back to being Finn&#39;s loving bottom. It was a nice, comforting thought. Finn was such an understanding boyfriend and generous, to boot. Not many tops would let this scenario play out.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed happily. That&#39;s why he loved Finn. Taking hold of his buttplug, he gently tugged it out, letting the cool seawater wash into his gaping hole and clean it out. Finn noticed him remove it and smiled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Am I topping tonight, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhmmm.&quot; Jeff nodded, fingering his empty pucker.<br />
<br />
Finn lay down next to Jeff and pulled his lover into a sensual kiss.<br />
<br />
The Chronivac beeped, letting him know the changes were complete. This was the reality that had been locked into place, then.  It wasn’t that bad.<br />
<br />
“So, what did you want to change?” Finn asked, gesturing to the machine.</p>
