<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The stallion, Johnny, nuzzled up against Ryan somberly. A few minutes ago, before his older brother had entered the room, he had at least been half horse; but, now, in minutes, he had suddenly transformed completely into a horse. The experience had been unsettling. Worse yet, the loss of his fingers, bipedal motion, and his ability to speak thoroughly depressed Johnny. Would he ever return to normal...or at least into that well endowed jock he was before?<br />
<br />
As his brother removed his chastity harness, freeing Johnny's enormous horse-hood, Johnny gave a whinny of relief and thanks. The house's cool air on his large balls and sheath felt refreshing, almost erotic against his super-sensitive skin.<br />
<br />
Stepping back a bit, hard hooves making trotting-sounds against the wooden floor, an idea abruptly dawned on Johnny. Didn't his brother just say the lamp he was caring was magical? Maybe that was what he needed to escape this fate, Johnny thought.<br />
<br />
Awkwardly turning himself around, his large body narrowly avoiding the dusty room's chest of drawers, where he had found the horse's chastity harness and had mistaken it for an amply endowed jock's jockstrap, Johnny pushed up against Ryan.<br />
<br />
Ryan grinned, &quot;Playful fella, aren't you?&quot; he said to his stallion, rubbing Johnny's equine face again, his other hand holding up the lamp to give them more light.<br />
<br />
It was during this moment that Johnny seized his opportunity, and snorting, jerked his head so that his face grazed the lamp instead of Ryan's palm. In that instant, he made a wish, to be human again, and not just human but the stud he had been before becoming a horse.<br />
<br />
Startled at the horse's sudden head-jerk, Ryan lost his balance. &quot;Woah!&quot; he shouted, and nearly tripped, his hand gripping his stallion's powerful neck to prevent his fall.<br />
<br />
Even though Ryan could steady himself, he could not prevent his hand from losing its hold on the lamp...and, with a mighty CRASH, the beautiful lamp shattered into pieces onto the floor, destroyed, its warm light going forever out.<br />
<br />
Immediately the horse and man were plunged into darkness, Johnny stomping his front, right hoof once in agitation at having presumably blown his chance.<br />
<br />
Ryan still gripped Johnny's neck, connecting the two of them in touch, oblivious to the wish his stallion had just made.<br />
<br />
There was a problem, however, with Johnny's wish. He had wished to become &quot;the stud he had been before becoming a horse.&quot; Of course, in his mind, this meant the nineteen year old jock, but to the tricky magic that had been imbued into the lamp, it meant something entirely different. Making things more complicated, Ryan was touching Johnny as the lamp released its magic before its destruction, and the spell befell him too rather than his brother alone.<br />
<br />
Johnny felt a strange tingle in the darkness as his front hooves seemed to split apart, their stiffness loosening somewhat and then abruptly becoming nimble, like fingers. Indeed, Johnny's entire body felt like it was shrinking slightly, from purely equine proportions back to the half man, half horse creature he had been before. Oh, good, Johnny thought, its finally happening, I'm changing back to normal, the wish wasn't blown. But, even as Johnny thought this, his reversion into a human stopped, leaving him on his still very horse-like hind legs and humanoid hands. &quot;Can I speak at least?&quot; Johnny vocalized, surprised to hear his own voice: a rich, deep baritone with a raspy whinny at its end.<br />
<br />
Ryan would have no doubt heard him if he wasn't racked with excruciating pain. His body had decided to progress the other way, from man to half horse.<br />
<br />
Johnny could hear the unmistakable sound of fabric tearing, and in the dim light, he could make out his brother's outline, Ryan hunched over, his body having fallen to the floor. The shirt he was wearing was splitting right down the back, exposing a heavily muscled body with amber-colored, shiny fur.<br />
<br />
Eyes widening, Johnny watched as his brother's mane grew in, lengthening from the bushy hair on his head. And, finally his shirt exploded into tatters as his physique took on a powerful muscle tone like his own.<br />
<br />
Hands splayed on the floor, Ryan's shoes both tore and fell off as his feet elongated into equine hind legs and his toes hardened into hooves. His jeans burst at the seams, releasing his hocks, and his crotch's zipper flung itself across the room as his horsehood and growing scrotum struggled to free itself from now a ridiculously small space.<br />
<br />
Ryan groaned, and with a feral strength tore free his genitalia from his rags and boxers, a soft sigh and whimper coming from him as he granted them the freedom they so desperately required to continue to grow.<br />
<br />
The sickening sound of bones reshifting filled the chilly room as Ryan's face painfully elongated, his muzzle pushing out, his head becoming completely equine, like Johnny's.<br />
<br />
Johnny finally moved, and coming up behind Ryan placed a hand on his shoulder.<br />
<br />
He could feel Ryan's body still spasming, completing its last changes, Ryan's amber-haired tail growing in and swishing above his butt. Johnny couldn't do anything but squeeze his brother's shoulder lovingly and regretfully. This isn't what he had wanted, not for him, and definitely not for his brother.<br />
<br />
Both half man, half horse creatures sat on the floor completely nude, side by side each other. Ryan still frozen in shock and his finishing changes, Johnny massaging his shoulder tenderly, uncertain what to do next.<br />
<br />
Well, Johnny thought, as he glanced down at his huge horsehood, his narcissistic self assuming control briefly once again, at least its not all a complete loss....I am MUCH bigger now...only wish Ryan wasn't here so I could find out just how big, like last time.</p>
