<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">“Your assignment will be due next week, do not forget about it. Understood?” Miss Thorne asked the class. Various nods from around the classroom were given.<br />
<br />
Alexis sat facing Monica, he wasn’t sure how to start a conversation, and it seemed she was having the same issue. So they just sat in silence. Monica and Alexis hadn’t ever held a proper conversation, only the odd small talk. The silence was starting to become deafening as the other students talked around them. Alexis could faintly hear the voice of Wilson behind him. Alexis could very clearly hear the voice of Brianna loudly bossing Peter around.<br />
“S-so... it’s your birthday?” She asked with an unsure tone,<br />
“Yeah, it is. I’m sure you heard from Brianna’s whole... thing about it,” Alexis replied,<br />
“And from this morning,” she commented. Alexis had completely forgotten about that class, it seemed like such a blur considering he only spent a few minutes in the class before he had to go to the bathroom with June.<br />
“Sorry, I forgot about that,” Alexis said awkwardly, he rubbed his hand over the watch on his wrist, “did you... take notes from that class?” Alexis asked, realising he basically missed the whole class,<br />
“Yeah I did!” Monica said happily. She quickly reached into her bag and pulled out a notebook, “do you want to borrow them?” She asked, flipping through the pages. For someone in a group with Brianna, the least hard-working person in school, she sure did take some notes, “here, these are from today!” She stated, turning the book to face Alexis. He looked down the page,<br />
“W-wow...” he said subconsciously, “these are really in-depth,” he told her,<br />
“I-is that bad?” She asked suddenly, seeming self-conscious about it,<br />
“No! No, of course not,” Alexis reassured her, “it’s cool. I couldn’t even make notes this detailed,”<br />
“Don’t even,” she said, chuckling to herself, “I see the notes you take in Chem, they’re detailed,”<br />
“Not as detailed as this, though,” he said, placing his finger on a definition, “you totally understand the whole thing!” He said,<br />
“No I don’t... it just makes sense. Like, all of the chemical compounds go into...”<br />
Alexis watched as she explained the entire page of work perfectly. She was way smarter than Alexis ever gave her credit for. Not to mention, she was a completely different person than when she wasn’t with her friends. She seemed like she actually enjoyed talking about the chemistry.<br />
<br />
It had been a decent 5 minutes since she started explaining it, Alexis insisted she continued, and she did. She was now on the second page. All was going well, Alexis was having a good time, then suddenly.<br />
Gurgle!<br />
“And the...” Monica paused, looking at Alexis, “that’s weird...” she said aloud,<br />
“Oh I... I just wasn’t all that hungry,” Alexis told her,<br />
“No it’s... not that...” she said. She placed her hand on her belly, feeling it, “I just feel bloated all of a sudden...” she said to herself. Then her face went red, “sh-shit! I don’t know why I said that, it’s not like you really care!” She said, embarrassed by herself. She looked away from Alexis, she grabbed her notebook and closed it, swiping it back into her bag,<br />
“H-hey, it’s fine,” Alexis said, placing his hand on her shoulder, her expression seemed to completely change. She suddenly relaxed,<br />
“I-I’m sorry...” she said, letting out a deep breath, “I don’t know what came over me. I just felt so embarrassed all of a sudden,” she told him, “it was so strange, right after...” she paused, hearing a familiar grumble from Alexis’ stomach,<br />
“Will you cut that out!” Alexis whispered to himself. Monica giggled at him, but then lost focus, quickly looking down again,<br />
“I-it’s...” she said, putting her hands on her belly, “it’s bloating again,”<br />
Alexis now realised another unintentional skill.<br />
“A-are you okay?” He asked her, making sure there weren’t any unclear side-effects,<br />
“Yeah I’m okay. I just don’t understand,” she said, speaking very honestly once again, “my belly just bloated again. And it was right after your belly rumbled,” she said, looking up at Alexis. She then smirked, “n-no...” her smirk quickly evolved into minor fear, “y-you’re not... it’s not...” she said, looking at her belly, then back at Alexis,<br />
“Monica, how could it be me. It’s just a coinciden-” Alexis tried to reassure her, but was interrupted by one more rumble from his belly, “you’ve gotta be kidding me,” he said blankly,<br />
He looked at Monica’s belly. He saw it rapidly inflate, enough to start pushing her shirt. It stopped as quick as it started,<br />
“I-it’s... it’s you!” She said, freaked out, “h-how the hell did-”<br />
“Shhh!” Alexis grabbed her, she relaxed again, “I don’t know what it is, okay. But I can fix it!” He said, focussing on her belly. He let out a deep breath and watched as her belly deflated back to the original size,<br />
“That crazy!” She said, quietly, but with a reasonable amount of shock, “you can just do that?” She asked him. Alexis took his hand off her,<br />
“Y-yeah... I can just do that,” he responded,<br />
“So you can change anything?” She asked again,<br />
“W-well... that’s the idea,” Alexis replied, brushing his hands through his hair nervously. He was a little worried of drawing attention to himself,<br />
“S-so...” Monica started, lingering on what she wanted to ask, “you could change other things about me?” She decided to ask,<br />
“Um!” Alexis, a little surprised by her remark, but eventually telling her the truth, “yes, I can,”<br />
“Can you change minds too!?” She asked, excitedly,<br />
“Y-yeah... I can do that,”<br />
“Well...” she seemed hesitant, she bit her lip, “could you make everyone in the room ignore us?” She asked Alexis, looking him deep in the eyes,<br />
“Hypothetically,” he replied, nervous. He didn’t realise but she had shifted her hand to his thigh, “eh!” He yelped, he frantically looked around to make sure no one noticed,<br />
“Then I recommend you do that,” she said, as she started standing up, shifting herself closer to him,<br />
“W-what’s...” he stuttered, “why are... why are you acting like this?”<br />
“I have no idea...” she stood there, pondering on the question. Alexis was nervous, starting to feel a little embarrassed. He watched Monica’s eyes, her focus started to shift, she seemed to be getting distracted, “I started, like, feeling all funny after you changed me, and now I can’t think about anything... else,” she said, now stood up and standing above Alexis in his chair. He looked around, seeing a few students looking at Monica. He looked back at Monica, who’s eyes were stuck on his crotch. She licked her lips.<br />
<br />
‘Am I seriously going to let this happen again?’ He asked himself in his head. He looked into her eyes, she was seeing nothing but red. Lust. She placed her hands on his pants, he felt the softness of her touch along his shaft.<br />
<br />
“Yep,” he said. He closed his eyes, feeling all gazes placed upon Monica and himself dissapear. He looked around, no one was looking anymore. Alexis, was still nervous, but his nerves were distracted as Monica stuck her face against him. He couldn’t help but make out with her. She was still fiddling with his pants. He had accepted what was happening, and he was going to embrace it, all the way!</p>
