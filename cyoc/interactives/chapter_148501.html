<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Running and strength the woman echoed.... she looked concerned for a moment appraising him and then exclaimed, &quot;Oh, OH! I think I know what you are looking for... How silly of me to have forgotten our most basic packages. Normally we focus on the extreme side of things but we can certainly accommodate your every desire. Right this way.&quot; she motioned to a room with the number 4 etched above it. Derrick entered and the curtain was closed behind him <br />
<br />
The room was lit by small candelabras , a set of three candles here, another set there, a heavy scent permeated. The dim light and warmth of the room was quickly relaxing and Derrick found himself removing the robe to lie down on the cool table in the center of the room. The smell of the candles wasn&#39;t entirely pleasant, but also wasn&#39;t all together bad. Derrick&#39;s mind wandered as he drifted closer to sleep in the oddly relaxing atmosphere.<br />
<br />
10 minutes later Derrick heard very heavy steps then the woman&#39;s voice talking to someone, &quot;I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s entirely ready for an advanced treatment yet, I was thinking we&#39;d go with a combo of our basic templates. He&#39;s looking for speed and strength.&quot; there was a grunt/bellow as a reply, &quot;That was my first thought too, but again I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready for the Centaurian overhaul yet, maybe later in his stay. For now, I&#39;m thinking one of our basic build restarts using the thief template and finishing with soldier or gladiator.&quot; There was a grunt as response. &quot;I know what package you WANT to apply, but this is about what HE is looking for, and he&#39;s not ready for that type of package. Have fun but keep it to the basic&#39;s I&#39;ll finish room 6 for you. Here are some of my age oils, give him a full basic treatment.&quot; Derrick sighed heavily, he hated being treated like a child, she didn&#39;t listen to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine&quot; a deep, gravely, male voice said with a sharp exhale, obviously disappointed. A moment later the curtain to his room was opened and then closed. Without looking Derrick could feel the man was sizable in stature as a gust of cool outside air wafted over him. &quot;Hello.&quot; The man said with a strain as though English wasn&#39;t his first language.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I&#39;m looking for speed and strength today.&quot; Derrick mumbled. &quot;We just got here and there is a delay with our room. so I&#39;m checking the amenities out.&quot; He didn&#39;t even open his eyes, but if he did, he would see his masseuse was a man-Minotaur hybrid. Huge and muscular, covered in fur, his head was adorned with horns. The creature had a human face filled with bovine features, like ears, eye color, shape, and size, the bone structure wasn&#39;t entirely human. He had a gold nose ring, and if you were to examine his mouth or look closely as he laughed, he didn&#39;t have canines.<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn over&quot; the hybrid grumbled and Derrick flipped over putting his back facing the floor.<br />
<br />
A second later something was being smeared on his face, &quot;No Worry or Fear&quot; the man said to Derrick. As Derrick inhaled he relaxed even more than before. A second later the masseur returned and began oiling up Derrick&#39;s body his hands were large and seemed to be getting larger, an idea that started to gnaw at the back of Derrick&#39;s mind until he inhaled deeply and he felt safe again. <br />
<br />
&quot;Lit-tle fast; Big strong&quot;  the Minotaur hybrid grunted with strained English.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fast and Strong&quot; Derrick echoed with a smile as he was picked up with one hand. As a child would stretch a doll, the Minotaur did to Derrick. He didn&#39;t even notice as his underwear slipped off his now 6 year old body.<br />
<br />
Derrick heard hooves?? outside the curtain. &quot;Oh wow, Wow!&quot; the voice of a young man exclaimed. &quot;How are you liking our vitality treatment?&quot; the woman from the front desk inquired. &quot;I never would have opted for this but, but, I need to find a meadow, and hear music, and dance.&quot; the young man with hooves exclaimed with increasing passion. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re pleased, other satyrs often gather in a big clearing past the east fountain for revelry.&quot; There was a bleat, like someone let a goat inside and then the hooves took off running. Derrick was confused by the conversation but didn&#39;t let that bother him, he giggled.<br />
<br />
Derrick was contorted beyond the splits, and doubled over forward, backward, and twisted around both directions. He let out groans of pleasure as his muscles stretched in ways they haven&#39;t in years.<br />
<br />
Derrick&#39;s voice was unrecognizably high causing Derrick to open his eyes. For the first time he realized he really was floating through the air, it wasn&#39;t just a feeling. Then he noticed there was a Manotaur working him over seeming to toss him around effortlessly. As before, his sharp inhale from shock filled his little lungs full of the aroma from the worry removing face mask.<br />
<br />
Derrick was enthralled rather than being terrified, &quot;Wow, you&#39;re so strong. I hope to be as big and strong a you one day. You&#39;re amazing!&quot; Derrick thought he was still 165 lbs which wasn&#39;t the case. More like 65 and dropping.<br />
<br />
The beast snorted and glared at the closed curtain for a second, &quot;See her. Tomorrow. I make you close; for human.&quot; He set Derrick on the table and Derrick realized that the Manotaur had to be over 8 feet tall. A button was depressed on the sink and it began to fill rapidly with 100 degree water.<br />
<br />
Derrick was scooped up again and placed into the sink which seemed to fill itself with soap. As Derrick was looking down into the water his face mask fell off as it had dried and Derrick&#39;s face had drastically changed shape as he reverted back to his cherubic youth. The bath instantly rehydrated it and made the room smell worry free. Hmm &quot;Love good smell&quot; the masseur seemed to relax and a smile crossed his face.<br />
<br />
Derrick hadn&#39;t realized he had shrunk let alone imagined that he could have possibly been regressed but when he first entered the room, the sink seemed to be a normal deep basin sink that you might find in a shop or laundry room. That concern however drifted away as quickly as it came.<br />
<br />
&quot;Removing oil&quot; the Manotaur grunted, and rubbed every inch of Derrick to get the regression oil off. A moment later, Derrick was placed on the counter top with his feet in the water as the basin drained.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Derrick asked trying to be polite. <br />
<br />
&quot;Name? Erk.&quot; the Manotaur replied in his deep gravel truck voice.<br />
<br />
Derrick took a second to account for his &quot;dialect&quot; and working though the haze he had been lulled into. &quot;Eric. Nice, that&#39;s a lot like my name. Derrick.&quot; he giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Derk. Chew, liquid; then drink&quot; Derrick opened his mouth like a child and Eric popped something in. Derrick chewed happily without questioning anything. It tasted like a chocolate peanut butter ball, it dissolved quickly and was delicious over his tongue. &quot;All Gone!&quot; Derrick proudly exclaimed opening his mouth and sticking out his tongue before breaking into a giggle. Eric smiled and handed him the other half saying, &quot;Again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eric sprayed down the basin removing any remaining suds, and had Derrick stand in the basin and get sprayed down himself, both were feeling extra carefree and innocent from the face mask aroma which still hung in the air. Derrick had regressed to 3 before the regression oil was washed off.</p>
