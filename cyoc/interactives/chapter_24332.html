<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><P>"You and your so-called friends have made it painfully clear that I am not a very popular guy," Kyle explained. "Since you apparently have the authority to determine what's hot and what's not, I've elected you to be my guide toward gaining acceptance."
<P>"What are you talking about?" Jennifer asked. Though she felt this "Transform or Dare" business was one of the most insane things she had ever heard, she didn't expect Kyle to have such a rational reaction to their teasing. "Ew, you want me to help you not look like such a geek? Here's a few pointers: Stop calling people in the mornings with some idiotic mumbo-jumbo curse!" She would have slammed the phone down right then and there, but for some reason she couldn't pull it away from her ear. It was as if her arm had gone numb.
<P>"That's helpful," Kyle sneered. "But I'm looking for more substantial advice, and a bit more physical help."
<P>"Wait...eeyuck!" Jennifer said, connecting the dots in her head.
<P>"Not THAT kind of physical help, you brainless twit," he shouted in half-embarrassment. "I meant your advice on fashion, and...well, here's what I mean. Your transformation will be as follows:
<P>"You will turn into a fairy that no one else but us can see and hear. You will also have the power to physically change anyone but yourself. Now, I dare you to be my fairy guide. You will assist me in adapting to be a popular guy in school, and you cannot use the Transform or Dare curse until after I've decided you've helped me enough. Thus, if I never become popular, you'll never go back to your own popular life. I promise you, though, that if you help me I will reward you however you want using the curse."
<P>"That has got to be THE weirdest idea I've ever heard," Jennifer gawked. "You just maxed out my creep-o-meter. I'd maybe help you pick out a nicer wardrobe, but you're probably beyond help at this poin--AAUGH!"
<P>Kyle heard the phone on Jennifer's end drop to the floor. Jennifer herself had encountered a very rapid shrinking spell, as she disappeared down into her clothes. Her bra fell on top of her head as her skirt tumbled onto the floor around her. She found herself half-covered inside her own sock. Dragging herself out, she stood inside her gargantuan living room. She couldn't believe what she was experiencing. Her naked five-inch body appeared exactly the same, though the air didn't feel cold at all to her. Before while she was getting dressed she thought the house was rather frigid, but now it seemed as if she could dance on a glacier and not get a lick of frostbite.
<P>Then her entire body suddenly tingled. It wasn't out of fear of what was happening...at least, not entirely. Out of her forehead grew two long spindly feelers. As they drooped into her line of sight she realzed these were thin blue-green antennae. She felt her hair toss itself out of its sports braid and brush the top of her back. She held a strand in front of her face and realized it had turned neon pink. Her back itched as two large folds emerged from her shoulder blades. Soon she had grown a magnificent pair of butterfly wings, semi-transparent with a beautiful blue and green swirl pattern that sparkled in the light.
<P>She testily fluttered them in and out, and soon she was lifting into the air. The exhilaration of flight swept over her, and she zoomed up to the ceiling, then down and across the room.
<P>"I take it your transformation is over," Kyle said from the phone. "I'm gonna hang up now, but I need you to get over here as fast as you can. School starts in a half hour. Let's hope for your sake that I'm not, as you said, 'beyond help'."
<P>Jennifer realized that this was all truly happening. T or D was real, and it had happened to her. She understood her new arrangement with Kyle, and while she liked being in such a cute fairy body, she was also anxious to get back to life and lead her squad to cheerleading finals. Now Kyle needed her, and she knew it was either help him or live without her friends and family forever. She flew out an open window and zoomed into the air.
<P>Her blue-green antennae allowed her to zero in on Kyle's location as if it was their own private homing device. Her intuition must have become adjusted to accept Kyle as her one and only partner, seeing as he was now the only one she could communicate with. She found his house soon enough and explored each window to find his room. When she located him, sitting on his bed in nothing but a tee-shirt and boxers and those thick-rimmed glasses that she had once ridiculed him for, she tapped her small fist on the window.
<P>Kyle let her in, staring at her in disbelief. "Wow...I knew it would work, but...seeing you like that is still weird."
<P>"We'll have to work on how to properly flatter a girl later," Jennifer snarked. "I can't believe this either, but it's what you wanted, and thanks to your dare I have to go along with it." She idly stroked her pink hair and a silky wing. She looked him and his room over. "I'm guessing we'll start with that wardrobe of yours..."</p>
