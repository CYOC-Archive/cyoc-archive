<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andre had never been to prison before. He was almost going to go to Juviee as a kid though but at the last minute he was stopped in line becuase of a mix up in the paper work. It was a complete miriacle that it had concurred but Andre doubted it would happen this time though. His gang members had done time before but when he was able to contact them and he told them the name of this prison they had never heard of it. This sucked becuase Andre was going to be on his own. Tommy a close friend of his in the gang was going to see if there was any dangerous prison gangs to watch out for. He would call him later. Tommy must have been buesy because he never did call back. It was time to go so He was led from his jail cell and shoved into a van which took him outside the city to another police station. While here he boarded a white prison bus. He choose a seat up front away from everyone else and took a nap. Andre didn&#39;t even know where the prison was but after waking up he assumed it wasn&#39;t far becuase the time had only gained two and a half hours. Andre was lead outside the bus and got a good view of the prison and his end mates.<br />
<br />
The prison was smaller than expected it had a large yard with four towers on each corner and 20 foot fences in between with barbed wife on the top. Andre was still taking in his new home but was shoved in the back by a guard who told him to get in line with the other criminals. He then got a good look at his new neighbors.<br />
<br />
There was a skinny very young looking Latino, a pale ginger with a long scar going through his left eyebrow down his nose bridge and into his right cheek. There where four older men who all seemed to be tired and unconcerned. They ranged from fifty to sixty and all had a round figure with some muscle buried under the fat. There was a mysterious 35ish good looking man with a rich black beard slick black hair and some muscles but he was thin overall and abou 6 foot. Then there was another black boy but he was only slightly older than Andre and he was extremely fat with a childish haircut and a baby face. Lastly there was a young twinkish 20 year old who didn&#39;t quite look old enough for his age but had a sly smile that showed sneaky intelligence. His curly blonde hair and scrunched face made him look like and elf. <br />
They all surrender there personals at the front desk and we&#39;re given orange jumpsuits which they changed into. A guard each escorted them to there rooms in pairs of twos. Andre had to go with the young Latino.They male guard was near sixty and couldn&#39;t stop Andre from running away or couldn&#39;t stop him from knocking him out in one punch. His name card read Danielle. He told them that this room was only temporary and that they would be moved to another larger room with other prisoners. The guard shoved them into the room and locked the door behind them and apologized but announced that this was the rule and that they could be let out to socialize in two hours when the free bell rang. Andre looked at the shabby room. <br />
It was bigger than he expected 15 feet by 12 feet. He took the left bunk and wanted to catch some zzzzzzs. But was interrupted by the boy.<br />
&quot; Now listen I just want to start out saying that. I&#39;m a nice person and I don&#39;t want to be in any trouble. I know your obviously going to be the dominant but I&#39;ll tell you right now that I&#39;m not gay and I don&#39;t want to be your bitch. &quot;<br />
He his voice seemed nervous and was more like he was trying to convince himself rather than tell off Andre.<br />
<br />
&quot; Andre new he was the dominant and also new that he could make this guy do whatever he wanted to with his large muscles. He undid his dreadlocks from his bands and let them fall down past his shoulders as he stood up. He absently mildly scratched his goatee as he talked to his new roommate.<br />
&quot; What&#39;s you name?&quot; <br />
&quot;Luca &quot; he replied<br />
&quot; Why are you so afraid your trembling?&quot;<br />
&quot; I AM NOT. Well yeah I guess I am but it&#39;s just that I&#39;m really not suppose to be here. I mean like I know everyone isn&#39;t suppose to be here but I&#39;m literally not suppose to be here here. I should be at Juivee becuase I&#39;m only sixteen but I shouldn&#39;t even be there I didn&#39;t even do anything wrong. I had just gotten my license and I took out a car my brother gave me as a gift. He probably stole it or something becuase it was to nice but then again he is a drug dealer. I got pulled over for speeding and the police thought I looked high and they searched the car. Which is against my right but I didn&#39;t protest becuase we are undocumented. They ended up finding five kilos of Coke in the trunk. It turns out that one of my brothers friends stashed my brothers Coke in my car accidentally. I begged him to claim ownership over the Coke. But he said I needed to take one for the team and because it was my fault I didn&#39;t check the car. So he forged so documents which was easy because we are hear illegally. He gave me a fake identity saying I was him and told me he would try to get me out but it may take a while. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m a 16 year old in an adult prison. It sucks but I have to do it it&#39;s only eight years maybe I can get out at five.&quot;<br />
He finished<br />
&quot; well I&#39;m really sorry about that Luca. But even though your young your the closest thing I&#39;ve got to pussy right now so get ready because i get really horny after working out. I&#39;ll try to be gentle but gentle for you and gentle for me could be very different. So be ready to spread those cheeks and loosen that throats whenever I feel like it okay?&quot; Andre commanded <br />
Luca shook his head and Andre commanded that Luca give him a blow job. <br />
<br />
Luca seductively unzipped Andre&#39;s jumpsuit and pulled down Andre compression shorts. He looked scared and uncertain that he could swallow that much man. But Andre wasn&#39;t going to take no for an answer and shoved Luca&#39;s head onto his dick with his neatly hand. After ten minutes of continuous sucking and slurping with pre running down his lips under his chip and down his neck. Andre came three gallons down into Luca&#39;s stomach. After a minute of orgasm Luca released and fell done cringing. He made some query sounds.<br />
&quot; I don&#39;t fe......... feel so well. I feel si...ck.&quot; he muttered as he crawled onto his bed. <br />
It may have just been the horrible lighting mug Andre thought he saw Luca&#39;s skin getting darker. Luca covered himself with the blanket twisting and turning with deep moans coming from underneath.  Luca kept turning so much it rolled him out of bed. But this new figure formally know as Luca looked twice his original weight and a foot taller. <br />
Luca had become black and defiantly older. He looked like he had gained around ten years. He had grown a nice black beard and a tight cut. His new chocolate perky nipples stood out against his light skin texture. Sweat trickled down his body going from his handsome face down his muscular chin in between the ridges of pecs and cris crossed down his abs to his underwear. Luca who seemed to not notice the transformation stripped off his last piece of clothing because his jumpsuit had been ripped off. Andre god a good look at his back muscle and tight butt. But he had a foot long dick and big bull balls to match. But also noticed that Luca had shaved of all his hair around his dick balls and anus.<br />
&quot; Hey Andre after we get out of our cell let&#39;s go to the shower Maybe I can accuse my drop the soap. &quot; Said Lamar with a gay gleam in his eyes.</p>
