<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One week passed.  You suspected that someone on the swim team had spread the news of the orgy in the locker room, which was currently one of the hottest topics. Nothing that bothered you, on the contrary.  Other dickgirls at school, knowing your fondness for girls&#39; dick, would sometimes come to you when they got an erection at school and ask you to suck them or let them fuck you. At first, you accepted them all without thinking, but realizing that you were interfering with your personal life, you started to control yourself and refused some cases, even against your will.<br />
<br />
From seeing the expression on their faces so much when they came, your interest in having your own dick was awakened in you, that&#39;s why you went to the school board and filed the paperwork to do the procedure.<br />
<br />
The first Saturday after your decision arrives, the day your procedure was scheduled. You woke up early and masturbated with a dildo up your pussy, making it a goodbye since you wouldn&#39;t have it for much longer. So you got ready and waited until 9:00 am to go to the lab, where the procedure was scheduled to start at 10:00 am.<br />
<br />
You arrived relatively early, and they asked you to come in about five minutes before the scheduled time. In the room there was a chair similar to a dentist&#39;s, only without all those devices around it. As the doctor who attended to you asked, you took off all your clothes and sat in the chair. She then tied yourr legs tightly, with them wide open, and your arms. You asked if it was really necessary to lock you up like that and she the Dr said yes, because you couldn&#39;t touch your genitals at all during the procedure, and there was a side effect during the process which made the person so horny that she would be unable to resist touching, not to mention the developing member is very sensitive and can make the person come with the slightest touch.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would happen if I touched it during the procedure?&quot; you asked curiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;According to the test results when the procedure was being developed, even though the new genitalia does not look like it is still very unstable during the changing procedure. If you happen to have an orgasm in the process of switching from a vagina to a penis, it won&#39;t come out of the cum, but it would be your not yet fully developed balls that would come out of the tip. This is what leads the person to have an empty ballsack, and to make matters worse, when they have an erection, they are never able to end it, because they never have an orgasm regardless of the amount of stimulation. To make matters worse, there is no way to regain the ability to have orgasms, even if you reverse the process and acquire a vagina again.&quot; the doctor said<br />
<br />
&quot;That is terrible.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
The procedure then began, the Doctor placed two needles attached to thin hoses in you, one directly into your clit and the other into your belly. She then fit them into a bag with a colorless liquid, which slowly entered your body. It didn&#39;t take long for you to feel the effects, it felt like your insides were heaving, and your vagina was definitely getting smaller and smaller. This continued until the Dr saw that your vagina had disappeared with no trace of its existence left behind.<br />
<br />
&quot;The first part of the procedure is complete, your female genitals have been completely removed.&quot; the doctor said, removing the needles from you, but she got with a new one, with which she pricked your genderless crotch, this new one was attached to a bag of green liquid. &quot;This is the serum that grows male genitals.  The final size of your dick has nothing to do with your genetics or luck, it has nothing to do with how much of this serum you get in your veins. Your dick will continue to grow while the serum is being injected into you and you will choose the final size, for that you need to let me know when you reach the size you like best.&quot;<br />
<br />
The second part of the procedure began and the green serum descended into your body.  It didn&#39;t take long for three small bumps around where the needle was, and the one above was a little longer and the skin split open at the tip, revealing the little red head of your new member that was starting to develop. Your new dick was hard, standing proud despite being only an inch long. You started to feel the side effect and got extremelly horny, grateful that the doc tied you up, as the temptation to grab your new member was too much for you to resist. Your cock now throbbed every few seconds, and with each throb, it grew approximately a millimeter. You enjoyed the feeling of your cock growing, but at the same time it was torture that you couldn&#39;t do anything about it. Eventually your new member reached the same size as Amelie&#39;s, but you wanted to surprise her, you wanted yours to be bigger, so you kept growing with your balls. You remembered the locker room orgy and the other dickgirls who came to you after that episode, imagining their reaction when they saw yours being much bigger than theirs. The time you imagined, you saw your dick growing and the tip passing through your breasts and, finally, being satisfied and screaming for the doctor to finish the procedure.<br />
<br />
The doctor got up from her seat and quickly interrupted the passage of the green serum, then commented &quot;Girls like them big, but there are few who choose to make them that big.  Twenty inches, you really want to impress. There are few who choose to have such a big dick, and your balls are also impressive.&quot;<br />
<br />
You looked past your dick and saw that your sack appeared to be carrying a couple of large oranges.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can I touch my dick now Doctor?  It&#39;s really hard to stop myself from starting to suck it.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait another five minutes to secure it properly, then it will be safe.  While you wait I&#39;m going to get a new pair of pants, it will be impossible to wear the one you came with now.&quot; the doctor said and left the room, quickly returning with baggy pants.<br />
<br />
After a few minutes, the Doctor took the bindings off you, and you immediately grabbed your new cock, feeling the firmness of it and precum starting to ooze out of it. You asked if you could come yet, so she said that it was already safe, but it couldn&#39;t be done there, guiding you to a door that led to a small room, saying that there you would have the privacy you wanted and there would be no problems with any dirt that you could provoke.<br />
<br />
You were left alone in the small room, where you sat on one of the chairs there, having to let your legs spread out due to the size of your new balls. You caressed your cock with your two hands and then, taking advantage of its size, you bent a little to kiss and suck its tip. Combining your inexperience with having a cock and how horny you were, you came fast. You moaned as you had your first male orgasm, the first load of your cum spurting from the tip of your cock and rising high before falling and pooling on the floor.<br />
<br />
You continued to sit there, catching your breath from your post-orgasm as your cock went limp.  Leaving the small room, you got dressed and, even with the pants being baggy, you could see the presence of your male member inside it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I liked this one a lot, but now that I think about it, I noticed a problem.  It&#39;s going to be impossible for me to fuck someone with a dick that big.&quot; you said<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so much.  As size is optional for those undergoing the procedure, the medicine that helps is sold separately. You can buy a suppository at the pharmacy to squish the person&#39;s entrances.  So a person you have to convince a person you intend to fuck to put the medicine in the ass and let it melt and be absorbed by the body, allowing the body&#39;s mildness to increase temporarily, for six to eight hours, the thickness of your dick does not it will be problem.  But as for the length, it doesn&#39;t matter, you won&#39;t be able to fit everything inside.&quot; the doctor said<br />
<br />
You thanked him for the information, being released and leaving the office.<br />
<br />
Leaving the lab you....</p>
