<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>In the first draft, all the characters act like in TV drama after first apologize, cheesy and classic (run off and vent on the beach, exhausted and be found, leading a hand to get up, everyone telling good words, with a happy unite hug). It shows all the love and care, but just too cheesy....I have to cancel it.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Along the way we talk, Adrian giggled mischievously. &quot;So...I see the &#39;Secret Weapon&#39; potion I gifted to you was not in the shack anymore, did you use it?&quot;<br />
<br />
His playful tone ignited a flush beneath my white fur. Recalling the magic aphrodisiac&#39;s effects, I grunted in embarrassment. Adrian smirked up at me, running light fingers across my muscled stomach. The sensation surprised me, though not unpleasantly.<br />
<br />
We passed lush fields feeding the city as the sun started climbing down, Port-Tailus came into view in the distance.<br />
<br />
Adrian spoke, stop tracing idle patterns along my bare skin that he had ruffled, &quot;This physique of yours makes the journey short. However, I&#39;ll walk on my own feet from here - can&#39;t have the townsfolk see me being held like a bride, otherwise they will mourning my &#39;departure&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
His teasing words stirred an unfamiliar warmth. I released him with a gruff, slipped out easily in my new form than I&#39;d realized. Was this how all beastmen of brawn responded to touch?<br />
<br />
There are guards, a dog and a bull beastman, manned the city gates as usual, checking travelers slowly entering Port-Tailus. Four beastmen ahead of us, so not a long queue. I gripped my backpack with all the Earth stuffs tightly, hoping the guards wouldn&#39;t pry too deep into its contents.<br />
<br />
Suddenly a streak of orange fur tore past. He must be so dexterity that didn&#39;t notice him until this close, but my keen wolf sight still tracked him - a ragged tiger beastman, bloodstained leathers barely concealing numerous wounds, and some leftover ooze. But what caught my eye most was the deadly scimitar at his hip, reflecting the sunlight.<br />
<br />
The guards simply waved him through upon viewing a small bronze token. I glanced to Adrian, raising a questioning brow. He followed my gaze with curiosity flashing in those sharp yellow eyes of his.<br />
<br />
&quot;Adventurers,&quot; he mused aloud, tail swishing restlessly. &quot;Must have claimed quite a haul for the guild to earn swift passage so. Their work pays a hundredfold what we make, yet threatens life daily.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian&#39;s crafty smirk held hints of wistfulness. &quot;Often wonder what I will be if I am an adventurer. With charm like mine, perhaps I will be a bard. Though I&#39;ve had some taste of adventurer before, if you know what I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Adventurer, the core profession in a fantasy isekai. The person I should possess and become, I don&#39;t dislike you, Max. Just being an adventurer and save the world is protagonist&#39;s mission, rather than a hardworking docker. But on second thought, more and more protagonist in isekai story nowadays are taking crafting profession and become the tutor of Savior...<br />
<br />
Adrian sensed my wandering mind. &quot;I know that tiger beastman is charming, but our friends await, Max. Duty calls!&quot;<br />
<br />
His firm grip pulled me from musings as we reached the guards. Although the guard is doubt of my belongings, nothing sharp or showing magical aura. Adrian&#39;s charm eased inspection and they discharged us quickly. Adrian Immediately holding my paw, pull me into the bustle and run towards the dock where we worked.<br />
<br />
As I stood at the bustling dock, the vibrant scents and sounds enveloped me, assuring me that I was exactly where I belonged. Amongst the commotion, a figure emerged—Cornwall, the boar beastman. His imposing presence commanded attention, his large physique adorned with a coat of rich brown fur and a prominent belly. A pair of formidable tusks protruded from his mouth, adding to his formidable appearance.<br />
<br />
His golden hair, short and spiky, framed his forehead and ears, while a thick beard, meticulously woven into three braids, adorned his chin and cheeks. His blue eyes held a seriousness, but his nose, a soft shade of pink, added a touch of gentleness to his otherwise formidable countenance, exactly the same in Max&#39;s memories.<br />
<br />
Cornwall spotted me and let out a mocking grunt. &quot;Back so soon, mutt?&quot; he huffed, all gruff annoyance.<br />
<br />
Inside, my nerves fluttered - Max would&#39;ve surely snapped back. But not wanting anymore conflict, I keeping calm and lowered my gaze, let the jest roll off. Adrian, ever perceptive, stepped in with a cunning smile. &quot;Now Cornwall, we all have off days but we care about the dock. Why not put Max&#39;s strength back to work?&quot;<br />
<br />
Cornwall harrumphed, though I noticed his brown eyes soften slightly at Adrian&#39;s diplomacy. &quot;Fine, you&#39;re rehired. Don&#39;t screw it up again, Max.&quot;<br />
<br />
Relief swept through me as the hustle of labor began. It was my first time working as a hefty hauler, but Max’s well-built physique knew the job inside out. His muscle memory guided my movements, and his experience demonstrated how the work should be done. I adapted swiftly.<br />
<br />
Also, I remained focused, determined not to replicate his occasional clumsiness and avoid any further mishaps. A few close calls set my heart racing, yet I successfully safeguarded the goods. As the dock bell rang, signaling the end of the day. I am tired yet satisfied, truly felt like a part of our close-knit crew.<br />
<br />
I saw Adrian sauntering up, arm linked with Cornwall. The hyena&#39;s light brown fur contrasted the boar&#39;s darker hide. A new dog beastman named Michael followed behind, his orange and white fur standing out brightly.<br />
<br />
Michael had a muscular but smaller build than Max. His fluffy tail wagged excitedly as he walked. White patches marked his chest and ears, matching his energetic blue eyes. What a cutie! He always helped colleagues with boundless enthusiasm.<br />
<br />
I braced myself as we stood before Cornwall, met the glare steadily. I acknowledge Max&#39;s prideful nature, however I tried to apologize for yesterday&#39;s mistakes on behalf of Max. The remorseful words felt foreign on my tongue, but I rumbled in my deepest tone, &quot;Alright...I messed up yesterday. And I...apologize. I was wrong, Cornwall. It won&#39;t happen again, you have my word.&quot;<br />
<br />
As Adrian watched in amusement, unease stirred within me. Apologizing didn&#39;t sit right with Max&#39;s pride. I felt his stubborn spirit straining for control with newfound strength, raging against my stolen dominion. A growl slipped out unintentionally - not from me, but Max!<br />
<br />
Cornwall glanced up impatiently but I hastily muttered of needing relief, unsure how long I could contain the raging wolf within. Striding away with stiffened gait, I hurried to some concealing crates, my muscles quaking as Max fought to reclaim his form. Reconnecting our telepathic link, his fury stormed through my mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;You dare humiliate me, make me beg forgiveness?! Get out of my body, thief!&quot; Max thundered, barely contained madness searing our shared thoughts.<br />
<br />
I projected calm in response. &quot;Please, let go of this anger. I only want to help you start anew.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max roared back, &quot;You help nothing! I wished only for death&#39;s peace, no more humiliation. What gave you the right to steal my life and pride? Get out!&quot; His presence writhed and thrashed within, seeking to overwhelm me.<br />
<br />
Cornwall suddenly appeared behind us as Max and I quarreled inwardly. &quot;Wolf, are you done--&quot; he began huffing before coughing erupted from someone behind crates.<br />
<br />
The boar&#39;s demeanor softened. He shuffled his hooves awkwardly, looking down at the ground. &quot;Listen Max...I was too harsh on you yesterday. Firing you in front of everyone was wrong.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re one of my best workers, been here for years. And you didn&#39;t deserve that kind of humiliation.&quot; He met my eyes, his bristly face regretful. &quot;I know I hurt your pride deeply. And for that, I am truly sorry. I acted rashly when I should have shown restraint.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cornwall clasped my shoulder with his hoof. &quot;You&#39;re a valued part of this crew. I hope you can accept my sincere apology and come back to the docks. We need you, Max. I need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hearing this shocked Max into stillness, halting his struggles against me. Sensing an opening, Michael and Adrian emerged from hiding, showing their care and support.<br />
<br />
Michael gently nudged me, a joyful glimmer in his eyes. &quot;We all have our off days, Max. Let&#39;s leave the past behind us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what friends do - we forgive mistakes and move on together!&quot; Adrian proclaimed. &quot;Now let&#39;s seal it with a hug!&quot; <br />
<br />
Cornwall challenged Adrian&#39;s statement with a chuckle &quot;You just can&#39;t resist the chance to get your paws on us, whore?&quot;<br />
<br />
Adrian counterattack teasingly &quot;You already I always love it, especially on you~&quot; The boar beastman&#39;s face reddened and he punched the hyena&#39;s arm, though not unkindly.<br />
<br />
I spoke gently to Max&#39;s simmering spirit. &quot;You&#39;re not alone anymore. Apologies strengthen bonds rather than break them. These people care for you - do you not feel the same?&quot;<br />
<br />
Max only grunted, but I could feel he is listening. I pressed on, &quot;Swallowing pride is hard, I know. But anger solves nothing, only breeds more. What say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
At last convinced, Max relented resist to me, though not without a show of stubbornness. I could feel his happiness at reconciling, even without the Empathy Upgrade.<br />
<br />
Grateful for this second chance, I clasped arms with Cornwall. &quot;Apology accepted. Let&#39;s leave the past be and work towards a brighter future.&quot; Adrian whooped triumphantly and pulled us all into a fierce hug, with Michael&#39;s help of cause.<br />
