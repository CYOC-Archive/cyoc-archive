<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jackie and Felicia still felt a little bit uncomfortable around the teenage Ann and Lisa. They knew Lisa well enough by now, but didn&#39;t know if she would act differently at all being a teenager now, and they knew little to nothing about Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come on girls, talk to them, please? This is already more awkward that it already is.&quot; Gloria insisted.<br />
<br />
Jackie decided to go and talk with Ann while Felicia went to talk with Lisa. Jackie tried to think of just what to say to Ann, she frequently saw goth kids around her school but was always nervous to approach them.<br />
<br />
&quot;So Ann....uh....do you have a favorite band you like?&quot; Jackie asked a little nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um....I guess I really like....Nosferatu.&quot; Ann answered with a shrug.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nosferatu? What are they like named after some kind of nose job or something?&quot; Jackie asked confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? God, no, your generation today has no taste in music. They&#39;re a Gothic rock band, named after the best vampire movie of all time. I used to listen to them a lot growing up. Their album &#39;The Prophecy&#39; was like my life at this age. Here let me pull it up on my phone and give you my headphones.&quot; Ann said as she put her headphones into the phone and handed it to Jackie who began to listen to it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...it&#39;s not bad, but.....oh wait......&quot; Jackie began listening more and more to the song and then she and Ann listened to the songs together.<br />
<br />
&quot;These guys are actually pretty cool.&quot; Jackie said to Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. If you want, I could totally paint your nails black or I could give you a full blown goth make over.&quot; Ann suggested to Jackie.<br />
<br />
Jackie thought it over for a moment. She had always been wanting to try a new look for herself and Ann was definitely helping her put her in the right direction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hell yeah. Give me a make over.&quot; Jackie smiled as she and Ann now headed to the bathroom with some of Jackie&#39;s makeup supplies she had brought.<br />
<br />
During the time that Ann and Jackie had been getting along, Felicia was having her own talk with Lisa.<br />
<br />
&quot;So miss Lisa...&quot; Felicia began.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on now Felicia, you can just call me Lisa right now. We are in the same age group after all.&quot; Lisa said to Felicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, Lisa, so how is it that you...well....look great at this age?&quot; Felicia asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, I&#39;m not entirely sure myself. I think that I inherited my mom&#39;s looks the most compared to Ann or Katie&#39;s mom.&quot; Lisa said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Really? You know I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a picture of your mother before.&quot; Felicia recalled.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can show you an old photo of her from when she was my age.&quot; Lisa said as she took Felicia to see an old photo of her mother in high school.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow. I can imagine a lot of the guys really went after her, huh?&quot; Felicia joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. But she fell for my dad of all people. Probably the shyest guy she could ever have met. That&#39;s kind of where Ann gets it from I think. She and our dad were pretty close when she was this age. She could always go talk to him when she was feeling down and that kind of happened a lot. This is kind of why I hope that she can get to have a teenage life like you girls have.&quot; Lisa confessed to Felicia.<br />
<br />
Gloria saw that Lisa and Ann were getting along well with her friends and went to go make snacks as the four of them talked with each other.<br />
<br />
When Gloria was finished getting the snacks ready, she came back to see that Felicia and Lisa were watching a movie on television while Ann and Jackie were nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, where are Jackie and aunt Ann?&quot; Gloria asked her young mom and friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;I saw them go with some of Jackie&#39;s makeup supplies and went into the bathroom.&quot; Felicia remembered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s nice, maybe Jackie&#39;s giving Ann a little makeover.&quot; Lisa guessed.<br />
<br />
A little while later, Ann and Jackie reentered the living room and Gloria, Felicia, and Lisa were all surprised to see that Ann had given Jackie a full blown goth makeover. She now had black nails, dyed hair, was wearing a black t-shirt, and was wearing black eye-makeup.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ann, what did you do to her?!&quot; Lisa asked shocked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ugh, calm down little sis. This was Jackie&#39;s decision, I didn&#39;t force her into it.&quot; Ann admitted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s right. I really feel like she&#39;s opened my mind and she&#39;s completely blown me away.&quot; Jackie told her friends.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right and when we get back to school next week. I can totally introduce you to Violet and Todd.&quot; Ann smiled putting her arm around Jackie&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;School? Wait a minute, Ann, you&#39;re not a teenager really. You&#39;re a middle age business woman.&quot; Lisa reminded her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Business? God, why would I want to go in that direction? I&#39;d much rather be a painter. I mean, have you seen my paintings?&quot; Ann asked her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve seen your paintings, and they give me nightmares!&quot; Lisa shouted at her sister.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least you know what my life is like: a nightmare.&quot; Ann shouted back at her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh girls?&quot; Gloria asked Ann and Lisa not noticing a slight change happening to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah? And whose fault is that? Miss &#39;the world doesn&#39;t understand me&#39;, Miss &#39;I&#39;m always moody, because I hate life&#39;.&quot; Lisa said sarcastically.<br />
<br />
&quot;Girls?&quot; Gloria asked Lisa and Ann again, still noticing that she was aging up and her appearance was changing. Her clothes changed to something more appropriate to a middle-age woman as her appearance was more of a plus-size woman with short hair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well at least it&#39;s better that you, miss &#39;I&#39;m so beautiful and all the guys in school love me and are afraid of my older sister&#39;.&quot; Ann said sarcastically to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they wouldn&#39;t be so afraid of you if you weren&#39;t so creepy all the time, the middle ages called, they want their look back.&quot; Lisa said to Ann.<br />
<br />
&quot;GIRLS!!!&quot; Gloria shouted to them both. Gloria was now a middle-age woman who looked like a fusion between herself as well as Lisa and Ann&#39;s mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;Until you two settle your differences with each other you&#39;re both going to your rooms!&quot; Gloria said in a very authoritative tone.<br />
<br />
&quot;But mom...&quot; Lisa and Ann both groaned as they went to what they believed were their own rooms.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry my girls are ruining your sleepover, but you two know how Ann and Lisa can be without their sister around.&quot; Gloria apologized to Jackie and Felicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh Gloria....?&quot; Jackie asked Felicia.<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember girls, it&#39;s Mrs. Turner.&quot; Gloria corrected the two.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, Gloria, you&#39;re not the mother here remember, Lisa is. You&#39;re her daughter and your magic ring transformed you three.&quot; Felicia tried to get Gloria to remember.<br />
<br />
&quot;Magic ring? Please girls, you two know there&#39;s no such thing as magic.&quot; Gloria shrugged it off as she went back into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
Jackie and Felicia looked at each other with concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well this is just great.&quot; Felicia said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, now not only do we have to get our friend back to normal, but we also have to deal with a sibling spat too.&quot; Jackie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what should we do first? Try and get Ann and Lisa to make peace with each other? Or convince our best friend that she&#39;s only 14 years old?&quot; Felicia asked Jackie.</p>
