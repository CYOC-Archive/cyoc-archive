<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris put his arms around Jake and pressed his body against Jake's as they kissed passionately. That Jake was male didn't bother Chris nor did the fact that Chris could feel Jake's manhood against his own. It didn't feel embarrassing or wrong at all. It felt wonderful.<br />
 <br />
But then something seemed to change.  <br />
 The spray of the water from the shower changed so that it was hitting Chris in the back rather then over his head.<br />
 <br />
Jake also seemed to have changed, but that was something Chris only noticed after the kiss had ended and they opened their eyes and looked at each other rather surprised. Not only they had been reduced to two eight year old otter kids but also they didn't seem to be in the same place anymore. They were now standing in the middle of a lake of a park and a older teenage otter girl was sprinkling water on Chris's back.<br />
<br />
Despite these sudden changes, they weren't upset or freaked out by these changes, just merely surprised and embarrassed as everyone must have seen them kissing. Jake heard the teenage otter girl giggle and stopped sprinkling.<br />
&quot;Aww, you'll make many otter girls sad&quot; She said causing Chris and Jake to blush slightly whilst looking at each other. They didn't know who this girl was, and frankly they didn't care.<br />
<br />
Jake looked around slightly nervously, so many people around and none seemed to mind there were now three humanoid otters in the park. Chris looked at the nervous Jake and then couldn't hold himself and embraced him again and kissed him. Kissing as an adult felt just as good as kissing as kids was the conclusion. When the kisses parted Jake's nervousity had all but evaporated and he smiled before tackling Chris down. It was playtime!<br />
<br />
Chris felt himself going under and a sudden burst of playfulness makes him to swim around Jake and pull at his tail, causing the surprised Jake to fall in the water as well. The two otter boys now both under water they immediately started a underwater game of chase and swam between the legs of the otter girl and toward the deeper parts of the lake. Swimming through the water couldn't feel anymore natural. It was just as normal as walking but felt a lot more pleasant. It also gave the sense of being more free then they ever have been.<br />
<br />
They knew they were naked still but it hadn't come to their minds yet that in public it was supposed they would at least wore some clothing. In their game of chase they swam through the whole lake, scaring off fish they came across and then at the bottom of the lake they stopped for a brief moment to look around. They never had been on the bottom of a lake! Not that it really was that interesting to see but it proved a fun place to play as there was enough junk on the ground where they could hide. It really gave a twist on the normally land based hide and seek.<br />
<br />
It was amazing how long they could stay under without needing to go up to get breath. More then half a hour had passed before they, together, with hand in hand swam back to the surface to inhale the fresh air. They looked at the teenage otter girl, she was slightly chubby but still very adorable. They didn't look at her in that way though. They somehow considered her a kind babysitter who was watching the two little lovers.<br />
<br />
It was strange they knew her for a really long time, but at the same time really knowing they only had met her today. They didn't ponder for long about it as she called Jake and Chris to get out of the water, which for a moment they hesitated but then remember that they would get ice-cream.<br />
<br />
&quot;The last one is the turtle&quot; Jake said, grinning at Jake before swimming as fast as possible toward the shore, for a brief moment Chris just stood there in the water before he realised what Jake had said and he followed chase, getting very close to Jake but too late as he was a centimetre short becoming first.<br />
<br />
The disappointment of his loss was quickly swept away as the teenage otter girl which name he remembered as Angelica had put a towel around him and started drying him off. Jake already was dry and looked around. They seemed to be the only otters in the whole park. All the others were humans. It should bother him, but it didn't. And the prospect of ice-cream melted away that worry.<br />
<br />
Leaning against Chris as they walked toward the ice-cream store Jake was more then happy then he ever had felt in his life. It really felt he could live now they way he wanted to live without concessions. The ice-cream man smiled seeing the three anthro otters approach him. Otters always seemed to like to eat allot of ice cream. Fortunately, he wasn't disappointed as Chris ordered a cone with chocolate, mint, vanilla and pistasche, Jake seemed to be a more a fan of the strawberry, chocolate, vanilla fan and Angelica was really a golden nugget for the vendor as she ordered two cones having pistachio, chocolate, strawberries, vanilla, Mocca, mint and as a finishing touch a cherry on the top. He already had trouble making sure they didn't fall off the cone.<br />
<br />
Enjoying the ice cream they slowly started walking away from the park. For a brief moment Chris and Jake had no idea where they were going, but then almost as per request from their brains they had the feeling they were heading to Angelica's house. Chris licked some ice cream that Jake couldn't access with his tongue from his face and giggled. Jake in return kissing Chris on his nose followed by a lick. Angelica was still busy enjoying her ice-cream, but she smiled tenderly at the two boys and then looked in front of her, they were just at the border of the park where her house was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here we are, my house. It's not big but it's quite cosy&quot; she said walking to the front door and pushing it open. Immediately they were greeted by some hedgehogs who ran into the hall and looked unsure at the two otter kids.<br />
&quot;Don't worry guys, they're just kids I babysit&quot; she smiled, lowering herself and gently stroking over the hedgehog's spikey back. Chris and Jake looked with fascination at the unusual pets.<br />
&quot;Go ahead, pet 'em if ya want, just be careful&quot; Jake was the first to approach one of the hedgehogs and carefully stroked his webbed hand over the spikey surface which was quite soft, to his surprise. Chris of course couldn't stay behind and he petted one of the smaller hedgehogs.<br />
<br />
&quot;They keep the thief's out&quot; Angelica chuckled as she walked to the living room and sat down looking at Chris and Jake who were still busy with petting the hedgehogs.<br />
<br />
Little did Chris and Jake know that Angelica had changed them to what they were now and she was pondering what to do next. There was so much she could do With them.</p>
