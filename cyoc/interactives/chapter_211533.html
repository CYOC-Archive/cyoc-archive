<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt fell on top of Langston’s bed, the warm transforming glow welling up inside of him. He felt so good. Tinges of pleasure shot through his arms and legs, and Matt involuntarily bent his body. As he heard cracking sounds, he realized he was bending it too well. Like an extreme contortionist, Matt had bent his body in half, his ass sticking out, his chest facing onto the sheets while his legs stuck out above his head. Matt raised his arms to stretch them, it just felt right as they took their places in between his two legs. Matt pressed his head down into the sheets, inhaling the smell of Langston’s sweat and cum-stained sheets. His chest flexed forwards, as more bone cracking sounds filled the room. His chest was actually bending forwards and pressing into the bed. Matt flexed his chest into the bed a few more times until the crunching sounds stopped. <br />
<br />
Matt’s ass was sticking out over the edge of the bed, and Langston slowly walked up to the groaning twink. Cautiously, Langston traced his fingers around Matt’s asshole. Matt moaned, and flexed into the bed again. Langston stared as the body flexed, and strange new bones and ligaments were revealed under the skin of Matt’s back. Matt’s cheeks pulsed as they began to round past a bubble butt into something else. Langston stared at the morphing body, then he realized.<br />
<br />
Langston brought his big right toe up to Matt’s asshole. He gently rubbed against it with the pad of the toe. Matt shivered with pleasure in response and moaned.<br />
<br />
“Oh my god…” said Matt. “Do it. Please.”<br />
<br />
Langston gently pushed his foot forward, and his big toe pressed inside Matt. Matt moaned and arched his back, but hungered for more. Langston pressed a little forward, his toes now wiggling into the expanding hole. Matt moaned as his ass stretched and opened, inviting more and more of Langston’s foot inside. A crunching sound filled the air when Langston’s foot was almost half inside Matt. All of a sudden, Matt was gently rubbing against the bedsheets as he sunk towards Langston. He was shrinking! Matt‘a ass cheeks were thickening and twitching as they slid up Langston’s foot, stretching outwards in opposite directions as Langston’s heel disappeared inside the shrinking, gasping thing that was Matt. Both boys moaned as Matt’s ass cheeks cracked and finally stretched into what looked like ankles. They were connected now. Matt’s pale ass cheeks hardened and began to darken into Langston’s dark skin tone. Once they matched, the pigment began to sink down Matt’s back and chest.<br />
<br />
Arching his changing body uncontrollably, Matt moaned as his torso altered. Bones were cracking and reforming under his skin, bulging and cracking as they split and reformed. His nipples disappeared with a flex of his new chest joints, new whorls appearing on his skin. His organs sunk into muscle as his body simplified. His circulatory system collapsed as Langston’s invaded him, pumping blood through what was now just a part of a larger body. Matt’s legs and arms cracked as they shrunk and thickened into themselves, his left leg and left arm shrinking less than his right leg and right arm. Matt’s shoulders cracked as they softened and dissolved, his neck stretching upwards so that his shrunken (yet now larger to him) legs and arms were on either side. With another flex, long thin bones in both his arms and legs and now connecting to his head revealed themselves.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he was flying through the air as Langston repositioned himself on the bed. He stared up as the motion stopped, and he could see Langston looking down at him in shock and awe. Matt tried to smile up at his new lover, but his cheeks began to thicken as his face bulged outwards, swallowing his nose and ears, his hair sucking into his deforming head. His legs and arms bent inhumanly as his fingers and toes merged together. His digits thickened and stretched outwards and sideways as they grew relative to his body. Matt‘s arms, neck and legs flexed as new, strong joints formed, bending them into their new forms. A hard section began to form on what had been the back  of his head, riding up from inside his softening skull. The toenail rounded and thickened, forming a shape that the rest of his head morphed to accommodate. Similarly shaped toenails rose out of his other extremities. With a spasm, Matt’s former pectorals thickened rapidly into the base of the foot. Small hairs began to stretch out of what had been Matt’s back and on his left leg, now big toe.<br />
<br />
Langston jerked off as he stared at his right foot, now completely indistinguishable from before. It was another person… but it was a part of him. He flexed his toes up as he pressed his foot into the bed. No pain, but he could sense a pleasurable moaning coming from somewhere in his subconsciousness. The twink wasn’t gone after all. Langston came, and his cum fell and splatted against the top of his foot. Another almost noticeable wave of pleasure. <br />
<br />
Well, Langston thought. This is what we wanted. I better give it to him.</p>
