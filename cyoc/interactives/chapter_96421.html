<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hmmmm&quot; Thought Joe. &quot;I wonder if there are limits to my power. Will it run out?&quot; then a voice in his head said &quot;No, it will never run out. Infinite power is yours! Use it!&quot; It was the voice of the old woman he had helped on the street. <br />
<br />
&quot;That solves that problem.&quot; He thought, relieved. Then he decided on something and he smiled at Clover, lust in his eyes. &quot;I know exactly what to do with you...&quot; He said. She trembled, scared out of her mind.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that an FF cup padded bra would appear in my hands.&quot; Said Joe. The bra did appear. He looked inside it for the holes that could be used to remove the pads. When he found them he said &quot;I wish that this bra would never rip, only stretch.&quot; Then he took two big yoga balls and shoved them into each pad. <br />
<br />
&quot;Put this on.&quot; He commanded to Clover. She pulled it on without a single complaint, though her face showed that she was still scared to death.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this all there is?&quot; She asked. &quot;This is all you wanted?&quot; Joe could tell that she was hoping for him to say yes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, this is all I wanted.&quot; He said convincingly. Meanwhile, he thought his actual wish.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...&quot; Said Clover, sighing in a more than relieved way. &quot;Once your done gawking, I&#39;d very much like to, you know, get going.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, of corse.&quot; Said Joe smiling. She had no idea what was in store for her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you done?&quot; Said Clover after a full minute of Joe&#39;s staring. &quot;These are quite heavy. My back aches.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I&#39;m not done yet.&quot; Said Joe. &quot;Would you like to sit down, maybe you could do so in a sexy pose? Make this more enjoyable?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m fine standing, thank you.&quot; She said curtly. The bra was getting heavy though and she would have loved to sit. In fact, she could barely stand. No, she couldn&#39;t stand at all! She toppled over, landing on the yoga balls. But the strange thing was, she could feel the carpet on her breasts through the balls. Wait a minute...<br />
<br />
&quot;EEEEEEEEE!!!&quot; Clover screamed. The balls weren&#39;t just balls anymore! They were turning a pinkish color, like Clover&#39;s skin! They had little sensitive stubs on the front of them! They were starting to ATTACH to her!!! &quot;Get these OFF ME!&quot; She began to pull on them, sliding her fingers between the dwindling space between her original breaths and the balls that were becoming her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hahahaha...&quot; Joe couldn&#39;t help but laugh. He had always been the one to scream. The one to cry for his mommy and yell &#39;please stop!&#39; He had been the bullied one. Now he was not only the bully, but the MASTER! Yes, he was the MASTER of this girl!<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Said his victim as the yoga balls became a part of her, turning her same skin color and everything. The nipples were as wide as Joe&#39;s two thumbs pressed together and as long as a brand new pencil.<br />
<br />
Joe was getting drunk on his power. He had CONTROL over Clover! He had control over HIS SLAVE! &quot;I wish that Clover&#39;s nipples would grow until they were 2 feet long, 1 foot wide and so sensitive that even a cold breeze could lead to an orgasm!&quot; He cried.<br />
<br />
Clover screamed with immense pleasure as her nipples grew accordingly to Joe&#39;s wish. <br />
<br />
Be fore the wish had even finished, Joe yelled over the screams. &quot;I WISH THAT CLOVER WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO ORGASM UNLESS SHE IS BEING BANGED BY A MALE!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AaaaahhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; Clover screeched, needing release from the overwhelming pleasure that had consumed her. &quot;MASTER!&quot; She cried. &quot;PLEASE! I NEED...RELEASE!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not until I want you to have it, slave!&quot; Joe was going power crazy and somewhere in his head a voice laughed. This was exactly what it wanted. The ring was starting to take control over Joe, making him cruel, heartless and erotic.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Clover would be extremely fertile, becoming pregnant at the slightest touch of cum!&quot; He yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes! Yes master but please just give me release!&quot; Clover was desperate for it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish that Clover would become a centaur! I wish that my penis would grow to the size of a male horses!&quot; This time it was Joe who screamed with pleasure, though it was nothing compared to Clover&#39;s cries. He was so busy undressing and watching his junk lengthen that when he looked up, Clover was a cow patterned centaur, lying on the ground because of her heavy breasts and immense pleasure. <br />
<br />
&quot;One final wish, I wish that Clover would be in heat on top of being extremely sensitive!&quot; He spat, now almost fully under the rings control. A little part of him still said &#39;this is wrong! so wrong! she didn&#39;t deserve this!&#39; But the ring had complete control over his body. <br />
<br />
&quot;AAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!&quot; Clover let out the most lustful, out of control screech ever heard. &quot;MASTER!! KILL ME OR PLEASE ME!! I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!&quot; Joe finally complied, feeling quite horny himself. <br />
<br />
They had their fun time for hours and days on end, Joe made the wish that everyone would forget about them and feel indifferent to the screams and moans coming from the house. But it wasn&#39;t Joe who wished anymore. The ring had taken over his body. He was a slave to the ring and so was poor Clover. Though very powerful, there was one thing the ring could not do. It couldn&#39;t snuff out the original personality of any living thing. So Clover and Joe, the real Clover and Joe, were trapped by the rings influence, seeing out of their own eyes but having no control over themselves at all. They could only watch as the ring made a mess of their lives, they could feel all the things their bodies were feeling but not interfere with the ring. <br />
<br />
At the same time, by coincidence, they both made the same vow; I will fight this. I will win...someday...</p>
