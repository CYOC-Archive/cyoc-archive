<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After some time passed, Damon and Monica, Tim and Ana, and Chloe and Stacy swam up and reunited with their friends at the hotel’s restaurant. <br />
<br />
Cura and the others were eating a mix of unagi, plankton, California rolls, coral, and seaweed. For dipping, there was a bowl filled with cephalopod ink, that came from squid which was historically bred to make edible ink fit for merpeople. The three couples saw their friends eating heartily and soon joined in.<br />
<br />
“Good morning, everybody!” Monica said.<br />
<br />
Everyone around the table warmly greeted her back as she sat down with the others, the baby still in her arms. Damon happily sat by his wife with a wide smile on his face.<br />
<br />
“You seem to be in a good mood today, Damon.” Colton noticed. “What’s up?”<br />
<br />
“Well…” Damon said, his hand laying on the baby’s face. “We decided on a name for our daughter.”<br />
<br />
Everyone’s eyes shot up, even Adrian was caught a bit off-guard.<br />
<br />
“Oh, what’s her name?” Harmony asked. <br />
<br />
Damon let his wife speak up for the announcement. Her eyes looked at the baby with a love that only a mother could give. “Her name is Isabella. She’s named after my late aunt.”<br />
<br />
A series of coos and awws ensued around the table. Even Isabella, not used to the amount of attention given by so many people, had a bit of a shy smile on her face as she turned away from the crowd and cuddled against her mother’s chest.<br />
<br />
Lupe smiled and let out a sigh of nostalgia. “I remember Aunt Isabella. We were so young when she passed but she was probably one of the kindest people I’ve ever met.”<br />
<br />
“I never saw her but I remember you mentioned her once when we hung out, right, Damon?” Colton asked.<br />
<br />
Damon nodded. “I remember she was probably the only member outside of the family that ever gave me presents for my birthday.” He turned to his wife. “Of course, it was all because I met and later married my best friend.”<br />
<br />
Monica’s eyes began to water and she hugged the love of her life - At least, the best hug she could give with a baby in her arms.<br />
<br />
Adrian smiled at the sight. “To be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised if you lovebirds gave Isabella a few siblings by the end of the year.” He said in a light chuckle.<br />
<br />
Adrian looked to see Damon and Monica chuckling at his joke. However, he noticed that Tim and Ana were eyeing around nervously. <br />
<br />
“Hey, are you two alright?” Adrian inquired. Cura nodded she looked to see what’s up with them both.<br />
<br />
“Well, umm… You see.” Tim stammered. “Ana and I sort of… did it last night… and this morning.” He said, blushing.<br />
<br />
“That&#39;s it?” Colton replied. “I don’t see what’s the big deal. We’re all adults here, and you two are married. It&#39;s normal.”<br />
<br />
“Indeed,” Cura said. “Sex is a normal part of merfolk life. That’s why I brought it up last night.”<br />
<br />
Ana decided to speak. “We know, it’s just that… I was wondering if there was any form of birth control here. I mean, don’t get me wrong, merfolk sex is REALLY good but I’m a bit worried about risking having children every time I do with my Tim.”<br />
<br />
“I see…” Cura said. “Well, there is a potion that can lower the risk of pregnancy a bit but it only moderately lowers the chance. There’s no way to completely get rid of the chance.”<br />
<br />
“Oh,” Ana said silently as she looked at her belly. <br />
<br />
Tim laid a hand to comfort his wife. “I assume the reason there’s no solid birth control is because of the population issues, right?”<br />
<br />
Cura frowned a bit but nodded. “I’m afraid so.”<br />
<br />
The rest of the table became silent. The earlier mood from before has now become a bit tense.<br />
<br />
Chloe spoke up. “It’s a bit odd. Merfolk society accepts gay marriage but doesn’t have much birth control. What’s up with that?”<br />
<br />
“Well, unlike a lot of human society, merfolk civilization wasn’t founded on any religion that opposed gay marriage. However, the fear of a population dying out is a universal one. For centuries, our population numbers have been dropping due to human activity, so our kings and poweful families have been prioritizing raising our numbers in any way we can.” Cura sighed as she looked around the table. <br />
<br />
“As much as you all may not like to hear it, I understand their fears. I don’t want merpeople to die out. I want my kind to prosper, just like how we were a long time ago during the golden age of magic. That’s why I risk my life being in a farming community to feed my people.” Cura wiped her eye a bit. “Sorry for my lecture.”<br />
<br />
Chloe shook her head. “No, it’s fine. I’m the one who should be sorry for bringing down the mood.”<br />
<br />
Cura sniffed but smiled a bit. “No, you were in the right to ask for follow up questions.” She looked at Chloe and then to Stacy. “To bring the mood up a bit, I have heard some developments are being made where lesbian mercouples could conceive a child with a pill that contains a modified sperm.”<br />
<br />
Stacy’s eyes widened a bit. “Really? No way!”<br />
<br />
Cura chuckled and nodded. “Indeed, it’s real. Our population issues aren&#39;t all doom and gloom, though.” She turned back to Ana and Tim. “If it’s any consolation, many merfolk cities and towns are now offering financial incentives for families, with more benefits the more children you have.”<br />
<br />
“I see…” Ana answered as she looked at Tim.<br />
<br />
Harmony heard the talks. She was born in a family with many children and a ton of cousins, but the cause of many of her issues originated by the attitudes of her pushy parents and the perverted human men surrounding her. With the talks of merkids but no sign of her parents or catcalling to be found, she felt a bit… weird. <br />
<br />
Lupe didn’t seem to have any issues with being a mermaid, though. She was still all smiles and the idea of other magical creatures being under another ocean excited her mind with what could be down there.<br />
<br />
Adrian just proceeded to eat constantly. Anything that wasn’t cheap fast food or dollar-store ramen noodles tasted like heaven to him.<br />
<br />
Colton was loving the inked dip and savored the taste until it was all gone. <br />
<br />
With breakfast finished, everyone swam up and followed Cura’s lead. “Alright. So the agenda for today is to allow you all to go shopping. A government worker is coming either tomorrow or in the evening to discuss with you all about integrating with our society. Any questions?”<br />
<br />
Lupe raised her hand. “Are there any cool dragons or fairies in the hidden oceans where the bulk of merpeople live?” <br />
<br />
Cura smiled. “We’ll cross that bridge when we get there.”</p>
