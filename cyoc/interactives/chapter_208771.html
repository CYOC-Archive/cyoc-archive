<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Thompson continued teaching even after his shirt ripped off, his muscular, brown-furred form absolutely distracting the poor fox. The way his muscles shifted under the hide of his vast back every time he shifted to write something, that new swagger in his hoofed steps. It was like the changes had done something more to him. Which was true, Finn supposed. Being a huge bull man his whole life would likely give the formerly nerdy, timid man a different personality.<br />
<br />
Finn’s cock stayed hard through the whole class. He found himself grinding his small cock against the bottom of his computer desk. Five minutes before class ended, an involuntary moan passed his lips. Even facing away from Finn, Mr. Thompson’s ears swiveled and twitched in the fox’s direction.<br />
<br />
“Finn? Are you listening?” Mr. Thompson said over his roundly muscled shoulder.<br />
<br />
The rest of the class giggled. <br />
<br />
Finn blinked, realizing he’d spaced out watching the bullman’s tail sway from the top of the hefty globes of the his teacher’s ass cheeks, his pants low enough to see…well, just about everything, really. They had been shifting back and forth as he wrote something on the whiteboard and Finn’s eyes had tracked them and…he must have zoned out.<br />
<br />
“Uh, yeah Mr. Thompson.” Finn said, noticing everyone staring at him and blushing, sliding down lower into his seat.<br />
<br />
“Need me to put a shirt on?” Mr. Thompson smirked, turning and bouncing his pecs. <br />
<br />
Finn’s jaw dropped. More titters erupted from the fourteen other students. The little fox blushed and looked away.<br />
<br />
The bell rang and the class began to collect their things. <br />
<br />
Mr. Thomson turned on some music and hummed along to it. Finn was waiting for his boner to go down, but he’d noticed the bull bouncing his pecs and flexing in time with the beat and realized he couldn’t just stay here. He hunched over to hide his erection and scurried past his muscular bull of a teacher. The fox was almost out the door when Mr. Thompson caught his arm. This close to him, Finn could smell a pleasant odor, like sun-ripened hay and, underneath that, a wild barnyard musk that made him salivate.<br />
<br />
“You seemed distracted, pal.” Mr. Thompson winked. “Everything going okay?”<br />
<br />
“Y-yeah, it’s whatever.” Finn tried not to meet his teacher’s eyes. Way too hot!<br />
<br />
“Hey. I’m serious.” Mr. Thomson smiled, big blocky teeth making the handsome bull look a bit goofy. “We’re all grownups here. Do I make you uncomfortable? I don’t want a complaint or anything.”<br />
<br />
“N-no, not uncomfortable…” Finn squirmed, trying to free himself from his teacher’s grasp.<br />
<br />
“Alright, pal.” Mr. Thomson smirked and let go of the little fox’s arm. “Then try to pay attention or I WILL put a shirt on.”<br />
<br />
“Oh. No!” Finn looked up at his teacher’s tousled brown hair and soft brown eyes. His pants were tenting. “I’m real sorry Mr. T. I, uh, I’ve been bad.”<br />
<br />
“Nah.” Mr. Thompson chuckled, eyeing Finn’s erection. He reached out a hoofletted hand and patted Finn’s head, ruffling the fur and rubbing his ears. “You’re just a horny teenager. Hurry up and get to your next class, bud.”<br />
<br />
“Mmmph!” Finn bit back a moan and ran out the door, boner rubbing uncomfortably against the front of his shorts. <br />
<br />
He thought he heard the bull chuckling behind him as he ran down the hall. His little legs made the trip to the exit doors take a little extra time. What had just happened back there? Did…did everyone just assume he was gay? Was it because he was a little fox boy?<br />
<br />
The questions were whirling in his head when he burst out of the building and into the brisk fall air of his campus. It was laid out in compass directions. The cafeteria was to the north. The the west of that were the dorms. A gym and a stadium were further west. The south and east were all halls for the sciences and such.<br />
<br />
As he ran down the path towards a bench under a tree whose leaves were turning bright yellow, he turned to look back one last time at the computer science class and smacked into a thick hairy wall. The little fox bounced and was going to fall backwards when two striped paws caught him and clutched him safely against to big mounds of pec flesh.<br />
<br />
“Whoa, careful there, babe!” Jeff chided.<br />
<br />
Finn looked up into his tiger’s pretty eyes and instantly popped a boner. He moaned as the tiger picked him up and carried to the bench. His little legs pinwheeled in the air.<br />
<br />
“Jeff!” Finn panted as the tiger manhandled him into a sitting position. “W-what are you doing?”<br />
<br />
“Helping my boyfriend out.” Jeff smiled kindly down at the fox. “Is something wrong? You look really upset. Did Mr. Thompson manage to keep his shirt on all class or something?”<br />
<br />
“Uh, wait, you know about Mr. Thomson?” Finn blinked, fox ears twitching backwards.<br />
<br />
“Of course I know about him! He always tears off his shirt and…” Jeff paused and stared at the fox. “…You used the Chronivac, didn’t you?”<br />
<br />
“Maybe…” Finn squirmed under his boyfriend’s intense stare.<br />
<br />
Jeff sighed. “Come on, babe, you know that thing can have unforeseen effects! Turning ever guy into eye candy might be fun, but like, think how much money that’s costing Mr. Thompson in shirt money!”<br />
<br />
“Okay, I&#39;ll change it.” Finn pulled out his phone, holding it in his dainty paws and kicking his legs. <br />
<br />
“No! The damage is done.” Jeff admonished. “Look, he’s an adult. If he wants to keep his clothes on, that’s his prerogative. You probably turned him into a exhibitionist or something.”<br />
<br />
“It’s just that…” Finn’s eyes darted around at the few groups of students walking around campus, likely to their next classes. “He’s hot and it’s…I can’t concentrate!”<br />
<br />
“Mmmm, sounds like you have a 6 foot tall problem.” Jeff murmured in Finn’s ear and lick his neck tenderly.<br />
<br />
Finn couldn’t help but moan, his small cock rock-hard in his pants, giving it a little tent. The tiger’s paw descended and one finger gently rubbed the bulge. Finn gasped and bucked his hips, orgasm coming fast and sudden, writhing in his big, muscular tiger’s grip.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooh~!” Finn blushed, a wet spot forming on his crotch. “J-Jeff!”<br />
<br />
“Aw, you made a mess. Let’s go clean you up.” Jeff’s big, warm paw encircled Finn’s dainty one and he led him to the bathroom.<br />
<br />
Finn found himself being pulled along by the tiger. His cock was achingly hard still, even after having blown his load. The little fox’s dick twitched whenever he looked up into Jeff’s pretty eyes. Other college kids were looking at them-not many, but some-and while it would normally embarrass him, Jeff’s encouraging smiles and tugs on his paw kept him stumbling forward, clutching his boyfriend’s striped forearm for dear life.<br />
<br />
They made it into the bathroom and Finn was struck with a sense of vertigo. Everything was so big and hard to reach! How was he supposed to wash off in the sink? Then he felt Jeff’s paws encircle his waist and lift him up onto the bathroom counter and turned him to face the tiger.<br />
<br />
“J-Jeff? What are you doing?” Finn asked as the tiger unbuckled his pants, hands pressing against his erection against. “O-oh! D-Don’t, I’ll cum again!”<br />
<br />
“Shh.” Jeff said, glancing around the bathroom, then when he was sure they were alone, he unzipped Finn’s pants, letting the little red rocket free of its confines. It was slimy with his ejaculate, though still throbbing hotly. Jeff brought his muzzle close to the fox’s cock and delicately sniffed it. He looked up at Finn and smiled. “Yeah, you’re really pent up, huh?”<br />
<br />
“Jeff!” Finn squirmed as the tiger’s hot breath on his aching cock almost set him off.<br />
<br />
And then the tiger’s warm moist maw engulfed his little cock. Finn squealed and came a meager little load onto Jeff’s tongue. Jeff’s eyes rolled in happiness and he began to suck on the sensitive organ. For some reason, the little fox always had more than one cum shot in him, like he didn’t have a refractory period. Finn wondered if that was his fault or Jeff’s, but felt himself reaching yet another orgasm as the tiger’s bumpy tongue coaxed him past the point of no return.<br />
<br />
Finn moaned and groaned and squirmed under the tiger’s tender ministrations. It was like he knew exactly what set him off and was milking him for protein. He could smell tiger musk in the cramped bathroom now, spicy like incense and primal, too.<br />
<br />
“Jeff!” Finn gasped, “I-I love you!”<br />
<br />
The big tiger purred as he nursed Finn’s cock with long, loving licks and lewd suckles. All the vibrations added to the blow and those, combined with the tender laps across his scrotum, were enough to have the little fox writhing and ejaculating repeatedly into his lover’s eager maw.</p>
