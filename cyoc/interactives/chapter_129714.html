<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Finnlay had his hand out flat, Jacksob was &#39;seated&#39; there, his thick, long shaft resting upon his large, egg sized balls. &quot;Okay, well you are bigger than your own cock, that&#39;s clear&quot; Finn said casually, smirking a little when Jackson seemed to lower his new head in shame.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you have all of your senses, you are able to move...Scientifically this is impossible so...as stupid as this sounds it must be magic...I am holding a sentient cock which used to be a person, of course it is magic&quot; Finn laughed, then rolled his eyes &quot;Jackson, we will figure it out...any thoughts on what caused you to change? There is no full moon, no specific cosmic or atmospheric events...&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson began moving, so Finn set him on the floor. He watched in awe as Jackson crawled his way to the laptop and began slowly and clumsily typing.<br />
<br />
It took almost fifteen mintues, but finally the Sentient Cock moved back from the laptop, looking rather tired.<br />
<br />
[I was laying and watching TV, stood up and a sudden pain shot through me, that is when it began. I did nothing different to every other day for at least a week]<br />
<br />
Finnlay read, then looked down at Jackson thoughtfully. He scooped him into his hand and brought him to eye level. After a few moments, Finnlay moved Jacksons head to his lips and opened.<br />
<br />
Jackson began squirming desperatly, writhing like a thick, odd snake in the other mans hands. &quot;Hold...still, I am trying to figure you out...&quot; Finn said, then pushed Jackson into his mouth.<br />
<br />
He was smooth, warm, just like a flaccid cock should be. After a little sucking and licking, Finn began feeling Jackson changing.<br />
<br />
Jackson was still fighting against Finnlay, beign sucked like this only made him feel worse, it cemented the fact that he was a cock, nothing more.<br />
Finns mouth action, coupled with Jacksons own movement, caused what happened next.<br />
<br />
He was finding it harder and harder to move. His once fluid, snake like writhing was becoming more jerky and forced. His body was thickening and getting longer. He felt his foreskin pull back, exposing a large, swollen purple head.<br />
<br />
Finnlay pulled Jackson from his mouth and grinned &quot;Damn! You are a big one&quot; he laughed. He stood and carried Jackson to the desk where he took out a ruler.<br />
&quot;...9 inches long! And...fuck, 6 and a half inches girth, Damn Jackson, if only your cock was this size&quot; he laughed, setting Jackson down on the desk.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
Finn sat down after picking up the laptop, then opened up a web browser. &quot;Keep still, infact...&quot; Finn picked Jackson up and wrapped a length of string around Jacksons balls, tieing the other end to his wrist. &quot;There...now let me research...&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn began by logging into a web database he had joined a while back, filled with information on anceient rituals and beliefs.<br />
<br />
Jackson was finding it easier and easier to move, his body shrinking and softening. He began crawling, unsure if asking Finn over was a good idea, wanting to distance himself, but the string was only about 10 inches long, so he was trapped on the desk.<br />
<br />
An hour passed, Finn occasionally reached over and gently stroked Jackson, forcing the Cock boy to a semi hard state.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay...nothing on Cock curses or...anything like this, buuuut&quot;<br />
Finn said, opening a page he had saved. &quot;Ancient Japanese curses...kind of obscure...and really badly translated. This one refers to a women who was cursed to become a cow...&quot; he frowned, reading over it again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, she would change twice a month...on the fourth and fifth night....Hey that fits! Its the fourth today!...Anyway, that was for three years until she was...mated...and she then remaind a cow for the rest of her life.&quot; Finn said, looking down at Jackson &quot;I have no idea if the same applies to you but...If it does, then I would guess that you will turn into a cock twice a month for..probably twenty fours hours, unless you...well, Cum through intercourse...in which case...yea, no going back&quot;<br />
<br />
Finn closed the laptop and looked down at Jackson thoughtfully.<br />
&quot;So, I will stay until you change back and then I will head over just before sunset tomorrow and look after you...don&#39;t worry man, we will figure this out&quot;<br />
<br />
Thankfully for Finn, Jackson was unable to read his mind. Finnlay had a plan, or at least, an idea, and Jackson would never agree to it.<br />
<br />
The rest of the night was spent with Finn talking, taking measurments and making notes. At one point he excused himself and returned half an hour later with a bag, which he said contained some clothes and other such items, so he could spend the night and next day with Jackson. He had been slowly drifting of to sleep on the couch when something woke him.<br />
<br />
Jackson had been resting on Finns lap, when a sudden sensation filled his entire...form. He begn writhing and shifting around, all the time his shaft and balls swelling.<br />
<br />
It seemed to happen a lot faster than his first transformation, and within perhaps four minutes he was human once more, laying on the floor, trembling all over. <br />
<br />
Finnlay helped the naked boy to his feet. &quot;Can you speak? How was it...tell me everything you can!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson sat down and wiped the salty taste from his mouth. &quot;Uh..I..I dunno, I felt weird, aweful...I was a fucking cock! A disembidied cock!&quot; He sobbed, throwing himself against Finn.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay man...Don&#39;t worry...we will fix this, I actually have an idea in mind...&quot; Finn said softly, running his hand over Jacksons back tenderly. &quot;I will look after you....&quot; Finn stood up and went to the kitchen, returning with a glass of Orange Soda. &quot;Here...get that taste out of your mouth&quot;<br />
<br />
Jackson accepted the glass and downed it in one go. &quot;It...I mean, I felt like myself, my mind and everything, but my body...i felt soft and thick and heavy...when you were sucking me and then..stroking me...it was much harder to move...my balls ached a little and felt heavier too...&quot; Jackson told Finnlay whilst the other made notes.<br />
<br />
Jackson frowned, rubbing his eyes &quot;..Exhausted...uhg&quot; he felt the glass slip from his hand and shatter on the floor. <br />
<br />
Finn smiled, watching Jackson closely. &quot;I..feel weird...is it happening again already?&quot; Jackson asked, hsi vision blurring a little around the edges.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...No I do not think so...I would be surprised if Sleeping Pills triggered your change&quot; Finn said, standing up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sleeping..what? What are...why...&quot; Jackson stood and swayed, then fell back onto the couch.<br />
<br />
&quot;You make for a far hotter cock than you do a human, Jackson...Get some sleep...&quot; Finn said, watching as the young man before him slumped on the couch......</p>
