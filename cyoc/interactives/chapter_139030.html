<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Riley and Nick went outside wearing their tiny garments. Riley didn&#39;t seem to mind it but Nick was a little shy so he obviously ashamed. However, they&#39;re both kids so they didn&#39;t have too much to cover.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where do you want to go?&quot; Riley asked Nick. When he turned turned to see him, he found out that Nick was feeling a little bit uncomfortable about their exposure. &quot;C&#39;mon! Don&#39;t be shy! This place is full of men. You have nothing they hadn&#39;t seen before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I know.&quot; Nick replied as he watched the guys walking among them. Boys around their age, young men and elders. They&#39;re walking happily through midway, some even dressed like them. &quot;It&#39;s just that we&#39;re the only kids wearing these things. I felt a little puny compared to those guys.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, do you want a bigger endowment to show off?&quot; Riley smirked. Nick shrugged before he attempted to reply but was interrupted by Riley. &quot;Hey! That place looks nice. Do you want to go in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That one with the long waiting line at the entrance?&quot; Nick asked when he saw the building with big spotlights and loud music. &quot;We&#39;ll wait for hours!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, dork! That&#39;s why we&#39;re wearing these clothing. Look there&quot; Riley pointed to a small sign in a corner of the building. &quot;Free admission clothing entrance. We&#39;re going there!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick was bemused but followed Riley to the alley where the free entrance was. &quot;Are you sure about this? No one else is going through here...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No one else is wearing their free admission clothing.&quot; Riley pointed out and Nick realized it was true. All the men on the line were wearing regular clothes, besides they were the only kids in that place. Nick was thinking about it when Riley pushed in. &quot;Come in! You&#39;re first!&quot;<br />
<br />
Nick entered through the dark entrance, tripped and fell to the ground. Before he could get up, he looked that he had fell between someone&#39;s legs, another boy wearing an orange banana hammock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey! WATCH OUT!&quot; The boy yelled at Nick. He was 11 years old, blond and really small.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Nick apologized while he was getting up off the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m Judd.&quot; The boy said as he   greeted Riley. &quot;It&#39;s your first time here, isn&#39;t it? Me too, I&#39;m a little eager.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m Riley and he&#39;s Nick. It&#39;s our first time but I&#39;ve heard a lot of good comments about this place.&quot; Riley said. &quot;I heard it was expensive that&#39;s why we&#39;re wearing these things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is.&quot; Judd said. &quot;The men out there are paying over a hundred just to come in.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; Nick wondered. &quot;Why aren&#39;t they wearing clothes like us then?&quot;<br />
<br />
Judd was going to answer when a voice called for him. &quot;NEXT!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my turn!&quot; Judd said as he left, he went through a pair of big red curtains to what it looked like a stage. Nick was curious of where does it go but Riley just grinned.<br />
<br />
&quot;What kind of show is this?&quot; Nick asked as he sneaked peek through the curtains. Indeed, it was a stage and Judd was at the center of it, a lot of men off stage were looking at him like they were waiting for something to happen. Judd was the only one almost naked, his pale skin shining under a spotlight.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, let&#39;s continue the show.&quot; The same voice from before said. The light on Judd changed to a pinkish hue but before Nick could see anything else, Riley pulled him back.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Riley asked Nick.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see what this show is about.&quot; Nick replied as he tried to sneak peek again.<br />
<br />
&quot;NEXT!&quot; The same voice called.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s your turn! Go!!&quot; Riley pushed Nick to the stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;B-but!&quot; Nick babbled as he was pushed to the center of the stage. Almost immediately a spotlight blinded him for a second. When he recovered his sight he noted that the place was full of men watching, laughing and shouting to him. He was petrified and confused, everybody was seeing him. He looked around trying to find Judd but he wasn&#39;t there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where&#39;s Judd?&quot; He told himself when he saw that next him was a young man in his mid-twenties dancing on the stage. The people wasn&#39;t looking at him but at that guy, who was moving in a sexy way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Nick!&quot; The guy spoke to him as he moved his huge ass. &quot;Don&#39;t miss the fun!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you? How do you know me?&quot; Nick replied still bewildered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Huh? Don&#39;t you know?&quot; The guy said while he moved like an airplane. &quot;It&#39;s me,  Judd!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No way! Judd is my age.&quot; Nick replied although he realized this guy was wearing the same orange banana hammock like Judd, except for the way more bigger bulge in there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hehehe. Look at yourself. I think we&#39;re still the same age.&quot; Judd smiled as he began to dance with a pole.<br />
<br />
Nick looked at himself for the first time since he entered the stage and realized that he has changed. The first thing he noted was the hair around his body. A thick treasure trail that wasn&#39;t there a minute before, an impressive rug of chest hair and by touching his face, he realized he has a beard now.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is this possible?!!&quot; He shouted in amazement but he stopped when he realized he sounded older. He flexed his arms and looked that he had grown muscles along with his hair. His armpits hair were on display at the same time that he wondered his defined biceps.<br />
When he saw the wiry hairs under his arms he thought of a place where he hadn&#39;t grown hair yet. He looked down and discovered that his boyhood wasn&#39;t so little anymore, his white banana hammock was sporting a huge bulge, at least 8&quot; in length and so thick that it was barely contained. A wild bush of pubes was protruding from there connecting with his thick treasure trail.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice ass!&quot; Judd slapped him there making him the jump a little. He realized in that moment how sturdy were his legs as well as his feet, at least two times bigger than before. His ass was huge, roundly and prominent. That was even weird, he used to have a flat ass. In fact, he wasn&#39;t the kind of guy that has interest on getting muscles and he hasn&#39;t a hairy heritage from his family nor big size on feet,  height and, he assumed, down there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I look like this?&quot; Nick asked concerned to Judd.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s a strip show! These guys pay a lot for us and they chose how do we look on stage.&quot; Judd replied. &quot;They wanted a hairy hunk in your turn.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Strip show? I don&#39;t want to be in a strip show!!&quot; Nick yelled at Judd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... You&#39;re in a strip show already and you won&#39;t go until you show them what they want.&quot; Judd said.<br />
<br />
Nick looked at Judd dancing on the pole, then looked at himself. That body felt foreign to him but it was him right now. He touched his ass, big and spongy, and feel a strange feeling moving through his body, then he touched his pouch and he feeling grew intensely. He was getting turned on and the audience knew it as they began to cheer him.<br />
Although he was scared and ashamed as hell, he also has the need to dance, to show his goods and to strip on the stage. He let his body take control of him.</p>
