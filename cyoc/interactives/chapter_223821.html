<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chris moved down the street pushing a shopping cart with his one hand before he stopped at a trash can to pick through it. He didn’t find any cans or anything that he could turn in for money, however he did find some still hot leftovers that someone had dumped there. He quickly ate the meal, right there in the street, some of the passing people did look at him but as a homeless man most just looked past him like he was stray cat or the like. The more he thought about it, a stray animal would get more pity than he would.<br />
<br />
He finished the meal and put the carry out container back in the trash before heading down the sidewalk again pushing his cart. It was hard for him to do that, he had only one hand to push the cart. He had lost his arm in the sands of the middle east fighting for the nation for which now treated him like less then human. He hated how these people who he had fought to defend treated him, but he also knew part of the problem was his own fault, he had gotten hooked on drugs after he had lost his arm. Being a one-armed veteran junky killed any real hopes for a job, so at only 23 he was a homeless man on the streets.<br />
<br />
He looked up at the fading light, night was coming and he knew he better head “home”. <br />
<br />
Home was an abounded subway station; it was warm in the winter and cool in the summers. Someone had even figured out how to tap into the city’s power system and it had lights. He would sleep on a mat he kept in his cart but at least there he would be safe. <br />
<br />
“High sweetheart.” said a man as Chris moved past an alleyway. He turned his gaze down to see, two men leaning in toward a much shorter woman. “How would you like to have some fun.”<br />
<br />
“Fun? No, I have work to do.” said the women<br />
<br />
“Yes, you have work to do.” said the other man as he unzipped his pants and pulled out his manhood. “Get to sucking.”<br />
<br />
“Or else.” stated the other man as he pulled out a knife.<br />
<br />
“Leave her alone.” said Chris, his old military training kicking in as he left his cart at the entrance to the alleyway and stepped in. “She said no.”<br />
<br />
“Stay out of this, you homeless scum.” Stated the man with his dick out, both of them where in business suits and looked to be the type of men who never had to get his hands dirty in their lives with a hard day work. <br />
<br />
“She said no.” stated Chris as he stepped closer, raising his one hand up to defend himself. <br />
<br />
“Look James…he has only one hand.” Stated the other man as he zipped up his fly. “Let’s give him a beat down before we get this bitch to…”<br />
<br />
Before he could finish both he and his friend was thrown up against the brick wall. It wasn’t the arrival of someone else but instead they were engulfed in light blue energy. <br />
<br />
Chris turned to see, that the women had her hand extended out, the same blue energy covering it. Their eyes where looking around with panic in their eyes but they couldn&#39;t move and the same energy covered their mouths stopping them from screaming. <br />
<br />
“What the?” inquired Chris as the women then used her other hand to call him toward her. He knew he should run but instead he found himself walking toward her. <br />
<br />
“Kneel.” Ordered the women as Chris went down on one knee, he didn&#39;t really have a choice, his body wasn&#39;t fully under his control. All he could do is look around with his eyeballs and nothing more.<br />
<br />
“You would defend me against the assault by these two men, for that you have my thanks.” said the women. “You have shown great courage and for that you will be rewarded.”<br />
<br />
Chris had no idea what was happening, as the women pulled off her hoodie only to show two pairs of large, beautiful butterfly like wings, they where multiple shades of blue, neon, dark blue, royal blue and so on. A pair of pointed ears graced the side of her head and her eyes were an impossible blue. Her bare breasts were right in his face and the more he looked at her the more beautiful she appeared to his eyes.<br />
<br />
“I we reward, you. You will be the first of my new subjects and will have a place of honor.” Stated the women as she bent down and kissed him full on the lips. A shock ran down his body, it was almost as if something was downloaded into his head. The women before him, was in truth the Goddess and Queen Gloria Spiderwhistle of the Fairy folk. <br />
<br />
“Now, I will transform you into my first subject in the traditional way.” proclaimed Gloria.</p>
