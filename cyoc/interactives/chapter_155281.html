<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">During the summer, whenever Erin could get away from her lab to hang out with John at his beach-house, she did so. Often they would spend hours at a time playing and lounging on the beach together. And although Erin would gaze longingly out at the ocean, she never went into the water—never let the sea so much as touch her fins.<br />
<br />
Now it was autumn, though, and (for John at least) too cold for playing on the beach, even if they weren&#39;t going swimming. So instead, they were in his house, enjoying each other&#39;s company by way of their favorite mutual pastime. More specifically, they were on the floor of John&#39;s living room, screwing each other&#39;s brains out. Their relationship was well-established now, but it had yet to surpass that hormonal &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase. For now, each was a drug to their respective lover.<br />
<br />
Erin&#39;s green hair (which had grown out past shoulder length since the summer) was splayed out on the floor around her head. The mermaid was flat on her back, tits bouncing up and down with each of John&#39;s thrusts, as the human rode her in relative silence. His quiet grunts were drowned out by Erin&#39;s higher-pitched cries of pleasure, and by the rhythmic &quot;slap—slap—slap&quot; of the mermaid&#39;s tailfin either flopping against the floor or against John&#39;s backside, depending on which way her fishtail curled as she wriggled and writhed in pleasure underneath her boyfriend.<br />
<br />
John came first and cried out, filled Erin to overflowing with his semen, and then collapsed to the floor next to her. (However the mermaid&#39;s birth control worked, John didn&#39;t know; he didn&#39;t ask. He knew it involved some kind of magic, but whatever it was, it must have been effective, or else Erin surely would have fallen pregnant by now, given the sheer activity of their sex-life.) Erin, pleased but not yet satisfied, cuddled up next to her lover and kissed him while he rested, until John was at least recovered enough to go down on her finish his mermaid with his mouth.<br />
<br />
Not too long after that, they were embracing and making out in the shower, and John could tell that Erin was on the brink of just jumping his bones yet again, right then and there. <i>She&#39;s insatiable,</i> he thought. <i>How will I ever survive?</i><br />
<br />
But instead, Erin restrained herself. Once they finally finished washing and were cuddled up in some fluffy towels, Erin reminded John, &quot;You know what today is, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Halloween,&quot; said John. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. I never go to costume parties, and my place is too out-of-the-way to get trick-or-treaters.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s the festival of Samhain,&quot; said Erin. &quot;To demi-humans, it&#39;s the holiest night of the year, and also our new year&#39;s eve.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; (Yeah, thought John, Celtic new year, it made sense that a mermaid with an affinity for Ireland would care about that.) &quot;So what happens on … Sah-wen?&quot; he tried his best at mimicking Erin&#39;s pronunciation.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, legends say that the walls between worlds are weakest tonight. That spirits from beyond are free to roam the Earth.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Humans say the same thing. Now I&#39;m more inclined to actually believe it.&quot;<br />
<br />
They were back in John&#39;s bedroom now, where John quickly dressed. Erin threw a comfy woolen sweater on over her seashells.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well demi-humans like to celebrate it. No big religious ceremonies or rituals or anything like that. We just like to acknowledge that the new year means new life, and for a mermaid who&#39;s—&quot; Erin paused, blushing (her cheeks took on a lovely sea-green tint when she did that).<br />
<br />
John was curious. &quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I was going to say, a mermaid who&#39;s mated is supposed to be with her mate. In the sea.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Specifically, I should be in the water, and you should be inside *me*.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that&#39;s a new year&#39;s eve tradition I can get behind. Sounds better than Dick Clark, the ball drop, and a kiss, at any rate.&quot; John smirked and asked, &quot;Mates, is that what we are?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin blushed again. &quot;Well, maybe. I know it works differently for humans. You have all these… gradations of courtship. Dating, boyfriend and girlfriend, lovers, engaged, married—it&#39;s actually kind of confusing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well where do &#39;mates&#39; fall on that scale for merfolk?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have sex,&quot; said Erin, as if that explained everything. &quot;There&#39;s no deeper connection for my species.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t get married?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin shook her head. &quot;We don&#39;t formalize relationships like that, not in my culture. Two people are either mates or they aren&#39;t, maybe with a courting stage in-between to see if they&#39;re suitable. We… are way past suitable.&quot;<br />
<br />
John grinned at that. &quot;Yes we are. So… let me see if I have this straight. As far as your culture is concerned, we&#39;re basically already married? Like, you think of me as your husband?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin actually had to think about it for a moment, if only to mentally translate the terms John was using. &quot;I guess so? Like I said, we don&#39;t have that custom, so I can&#39;t be totally sure I know what you mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
John didn&#39;t say anything. He just had this goofy, happy smile on his face that spoke volumes to Erin.<br />
<br />
He was happy.<br />
<br />
That was enough for her.<br />
<br />
* * * * * * * * * *<br />
<br />
John had been wrong. After the sun had set, no fewer than four groups of trick-or-treaters showed up at his front porch to ring the bell and beg for candy. John had at least kept some on hand just in case, but the interruptions had been wholly unexpected. <br />
<br />
Erin was standing at the beach-house&#39;s big rear window, looking out over the dark ocean. She pretty much stayed there all evening, thinking. John would come and sit by the window with her, bringing drinks or food, and they would just be together in companionable silence. Until the bell would ring again, and there would be a ghost and a witch and two Marvel super-heroes wanting more candy.<br />
<br />
When group number four arrived (a fairy princess, Iron Man, and Jack Sparrow), the little girl in the fairy-dress spotted Erin by the window and exclaimed, &quot;What a pretty mermaid!&quot; Erin whipped around in surprise, and then smiled warmly when she saw the children. She waved to the little girl and playfully flapped her fins, and the little girl&#39;s eyes lit up in delight as she waved back. John quickly dispensed the candy and closed the door after the kids; then he went over to Erin and asked, &quot;What was that? How could she see you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The walls between worlds are weaker this eve,&quot; repeated Erin. &quot;I guess that applies to a psychic perception-filter too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess,&quot; murmured John. He looked out the window again—it was now pitch black outside, and you couldn&#39;t see the ocean beyond the beach, although the waves could be heard. &quot;Are you gonna do it?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t. I&#39;m still not ready.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You ever gonna tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded. &quot;Of course I will. You&#39;re my mate. I promise, I&#39;ll explain everything soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
John wanted to know when &#39;soon&#39; was, but he dropped it.<br />
<br />
At 11:40 PM, Erin was in John&#39;s bedroom, totally undressed (including her seashells) and lying on John&#39;s bed. Even if she couldn&#39;t be in the water, she would at least fulfill the other half of the Samhain celebration by making love to her mate at midnight. But her thoughts and preparations were interrupted by the ring of her cell phone, across the room where her coat and sweater were heaped on a chair. Without her seashells on, Erin wouldn&#39;t even be able to stand upright on her tail, never mind walk across the room. She groaned, crawled to the edge of the bed, and let herself fall to the floor with a THUMP.<br />
<br />
&quot;Erin? You okay?&quot; John came into the bedroom from the hall.<br />
<br />
Erin dragged herself by her arms over to the chair, found her phone, and answered it. &quot;What are you—at this time of night? You—uh-huh. Uh-huh. . . . And—it did? Are you sure?&quot; Erin&#39;s voice reached a note of excitement that John didn&#39;t hear often. She exchanged a few more terse, heated words with whoever-it-was on the other line, and then she hung up and looked at John with her eyes shining. &quot;That was one of my grad students,&quot; said Erin. &quot;He was pulling some late night hours at the lab, and—and—do you think I can get a ride?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need me to drive you to your lab?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re too far to walk, and the buses don&#39;t run this late.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll take you,&quot; said John, who grabbed his jacket and his keys. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen much of where you work yet. I&#39;m curious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin waited, sitting on the floor, while John retrieved her magic seashells. &quot;This doesn&#39;t have to do with my work for the university, though,&quot; she said, and John froze in his tracks, shell-bra in hand. &quot;This is my private research. If you&#39;re curious about what it is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re finally gonna tell me what&#39;s up with… everything? What you do, why you live on land, and all that jazz?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this going to… affect *us* at all?&quot;<br />
<br />
Erin shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br />
<br />
John&#39;s blood ran cold. &quot;That wasn&#39;t a definite &#39;no&#39;.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was with heartbreaking trepidation that John helped Erin back into her seashells, up onto her tail, and out to where his car was parked.</p>
