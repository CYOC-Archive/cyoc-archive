<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Ha! You actually think the curse is real? What kind of nerd are you?&quot; Jen laughed into the phone as Kyle checked hi watch, smiling.<br />
&quot;Ok, your time is up and you get both! Don&#39;t worry, I was up all night thinking this up like the sick pervert you think I am. For your curse, you will grow a 5 foot long penis out of your stomach, and become incontinent. Your pussy will no longer do the peeing and will only be used for storage and sex. During lunch you will grow balls twice the size of all the poop in your panties at that time. Your penis will be 5 times as sensitive as your pussy when anything other than yourself touches it. When you touch it, you will orgasm until your balls are empty. No matter how big your balls are, they will refill 30 seconds after emptying. Only you and I will know this is not normal, but others will notice but will not freak out too much, and after a while, accept it as normal. You will think nothing is wrong until lunch. For your dare, you will have some ahh... Trigger words that will cause things to happen to you. These phrases will be randomly spoken within hearing range of you, and if someone is trying to find if these behaviors have trigger words, and they say the right phrase, either to cause or take away, they will forget it almost instantly. You will be unable to recall these phrases. If someone says the phrase to cause an effect that is already happening, the effect will be added.  Also, today people can only say activation phrases. Ok, when someone says &#39;brown streak&#39; you will start to poop uncontrollably and endlessly until the phrase, &#39;crappy panties&#39; is heard. When you hear the phrase &#39;fire hose&#39;, your penis will become erect and start peeing, again uncontrollably and endlessly until you hear the phrase &#39;Jen wet herself&#39;. The phrase &#39;Jen needs to potty&#39; will cause both to take place and hearing &#39;shitty piss-soaked penis girl&#39; will end it. You will be unable to remove the panties you are wearing, or the next pair if you aren&#39;t wearing panties yet, until midnight. You will forget this phone call happened and go to school like normal. Oh, and you will stay for the entire school day, as well as cheerleading for the game tonight. Wouldn&#39;t want you to fake illness after lunch, eh Jen needs to potty?&quot; Kyle finished with jen&#39;s curse and hung up. <br />
&quot;Why an I at the phone,&quot; Jen wondered, oblivious to the penis slowly pushing her shirt up as it snaked out, urine gushing out of it. She was also oblivious to the stinking bulge growing in the back of her panties. Jen put the phone down , found her other sock under her bed, and walked down the stairs for breakfast. <br />
Jen&#39;s family got the mild shock of their lives. Her parents were looking at the puddle of pee forming a bit away from their daughter, her younger brother was staring at the 7 foot erect baseball bat of a dick his sister now had and Jen&#39;s older sister was just waking up to a really bad smell. <br />
&quot;Sweety, why are you peeing yourself?&quot; Her father asked with eyebrows raised.<br />
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Jen asked, genuinely confused, patting the mostly dry front of her panties.<br />
&quot;Your freaking fire hose penis!&quot; Her brother said, making Jen pee harder. <br />
&quot;What is that smell? Jeffy (Jen&#39;s brother), did you clog the toilet agai...&quot; Jana, Jen&#39;s sister, said before getting a view of Her sister&#39;s slowly expanding panties, currently with a lump the size of a football. &quot;Jen! That is one serious brown streak! It stinks!&quot; Jana exclaimed, causing Jen&#39;s shit production to increase. <br />
Jen was looking around, confused, now patting her backside, actually feeling the poop, but not noticing it. &quot;Is this a joke? Why do you think I am pissing and shitting? And Jeffy, why in the world would I have a dick. I&#39;m a girl!&quot;<br />
&quot;Because you are! And you do have a dick and apparently Jen needs to potty on herself!&quot; Jen&#39;s family said in unison, adding three more to both pee and poop, so now Jen was going at four times what she had started at. Jeff decided to make Jen notice, so he got up, and pulled on her dick. Seeing that she had not felt it, he grabbed her dick again and aimed it into her face. Even as she was having her own urine sprayed into her face, she asked what Jeff was doing. Jeff, in one last ditch attempt to get his sister to notice that she is not normal, shoves her dick down her own throat. She still attempted to speak, and was not reacting as if she was fucking herself at all. Giving up and pulling her dick out, Jeff walks back to the table, wipes his hands on a napkin, and goes back to his cereal. Jana was poking at Jen&#39;s soccer ball sized pile of shit, and decided to just go eat breakfast. Jen also went to the table for some cereal, and got her piss in everything on the table. Her family looked at their now slightly yellow milk and cereal, as Jen sat down, her cock under the table making piss splatter into the laps of Jana and her mom. They looked at eachother with disgust as Jen poured some cinnamon toast crunch into her bowl that already had a pool of urine at the bottom. As Jen dug into her piss cereal, her family left the table, the kids under the excuse of packing for school, and the adults for work, leaving Jen to sit at the table, surrounded by piss. She got up, cleaned and put away the dishes (getting pee on the other dishes in the process). <br />
The bus showed up and Jen got on. Jana had given Jeff a ride for some reason, so Jen was the only smith on the bus. The students on the bus were suprised at Jen&#39;s appearance and more suprised as they got hit by pee and the stench of her bowling ball sized shit pile in her panties. She sat next to her friend Amy, who seemed less than pleased to have a girl with a seven foot hard cock spraying pee everywhere sitting next to her. Jen chatted like normal, and eventually, they made it to school with only three activations for both problems and two inches of piss on the floor. After an (to Jen) uneventful first half of the day, lunch finally started. Jen&#39;s panties were holding a pile of shit the size, appropriately, of a toilet. As the curse took effect, Jen suddenly screamed as she noticed her penis, shit, the fact that she had been sending a stream of piss decently onto a very annoyed Amy&#39;s pizza, and a sudden feeling of growth below her vagina. She felt her balls growing, spreading her legs apart as they grew in her new scrotum, wincing as they dropped lower into her ballsack and off the chair. Each testicle was the size of a standard toilet, which she immediately found ironic. Her sack could hold at least 20 gallons of cum and was already full. She experimentally touched her dick and suddenly has the most intense orgasm ever. She screams wildly as gallon after gallon of cum mixed with piss gushed out into Amy&#39;s face. Jen flails about, as her entire 27 gallon capacity gets released into the croud of people trying to eat. After almost 4 minutes, Jen is finally empty and sits back down, muttering &quot;note to self, do not touch penis.&quot; <br />
Jen attempts to get your panties off to rid herself of the shit that has been accumulated or even to see what her new nuts look like. After trying five times, and even trying to use a spork to pry them off, she gives up and sits down again. She winces as her shit smushed against her ass and balls. Amy had noticed your new behavior and states with a smirk, &quot;look who&#39;s playing the denial game now&quot; while licking cum off of her cheek. <br />
Jen decides, because the curse made her, to stay in school for today and do cheer at the game as opposed to suddenly act sick when I had been like this all day. She then remembers the game. It is the last game of the season, Glendale high verses their rival, Jacobson&#39;s private school. The game will have parents and supporters from both schools at the field at Glendale. And Jen would have a dick, balls, a stream of piss, and a mound of shit.</p>
