<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;REI LOOK OUT!&quot; Shouted Amelina, Rei quickly turned around and was struck by the bolt, &quot;Graaagh!&quot; he groaned, as he fell on his hand and knees, he started gasping for air as pure energy was spreading throughout his body, &quot;Oh gosh... Rei are you alright?!&quot; shouted Amelina as she started panicking, she slowly tried to go near Rei but gestured her to stay away, &quot;Agh... Don&#39;t come any closer!&quot; he said, Rei thought that his body was gonna suffer another metamorphosis and didn&#39;t want to harm Amelina in the process.<br />
<br />
This thought became true as he felt his muscles growing stronger by each beat of his heart, so strong that his veins could be seen, he didn&#39;t even realize that he was also becoming much taller, reaching the height of 12 feet, he was gasping for air faster by every second.<br />
<br />
&quot;Grrrr....&quot; He growled, as he felt a pair of bumps on his back, he felt his wings growing in power and growing larger, almost covering Rei in the process, then suddenly another pair of wings bursted out, Rei quickly looked behind himself and gave a suprised look as he saw six wings on his back!<br />
<br />
&quot;GRUAAAGH!!!&quot; He shouted, as his tailbone cracked again, another tail erupting from it, this time ending with a sharp sword like tip, he swinged his meaty tails around, he was wondering when the changes were going to be over.<br />
<br />
Rei slowly tried to get back on his feet, almost tripping and falling in the process, he was looking at Amelina who was giving a scared look, she looked like she was about to cry, by just seeing this, Rei quickly gave a small smile in order to reassure his little sister that he was alright, Amelina by just seeing this also gave a smile.<br />
<br />
This was soon cut off as Rei felt his snout pushing forward, meanwhile a pair of curved horns grew from the back of his head, noticing that small runes were covering them.<br />
<br />
Rei suddenly collapsed, laying motionless on the ground, by just seeing this Amelina quickly rushed to his side and shook him, &quot;Rei, Rei please wake up!&quot; she begged, as she kept shaking her brother in order to wake him, a small tear left Amelina&#39;s eye, touching Rei&#39;s black scales, &quot;Please... Don&#39;t leave me alone...&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Rei got up, multiple runes covering his body, he looked at Amelina and spoke, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, i would NEVER leave you alone.&quot; he said, as he hugged Amelina, they were hugging for minutes untill they broke out from their warm hug, Amelina quickly slapped Rei across his face, who barelly flinched and gave a suprised look, &quot;Don&#39;t ever scare me like that!&quot; she shouted, Rei quickly growled, &quot;Well, i&#39;m sorry if you touched one of those stupid relics that shot a bolt of divine power against me and made my body react changing me even more and causing a surge of knowledge and power cause me to faint.&quot; he said, while crossing his arms, Amelina quickly gave another suprised look, &quot;When i collapsed on the floor, i suddenly realized that i knew things i had no way of knowing.&quot; he suddenly said, Amelina in response tilted her head and gave a suspicious look, &quot;For example, dragons were the first beings created by the gods, along with humans.&quot; he finished, Amelina sighed, &quot;Alright, point taken.&quot; she said, &quot;Now, how about we leave this place?&quot; she asked, Rei quickly gave a sad look, &quot;Amy, there&#39;s something else you must know.&quot; he said, giving a serious look to Amelina, &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked, Rei quickly laid his back on a wall.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you remember when we asked our father if we could visit our grandpa and he told us that he was no longer in the world of the living?&quot; he asked suddenly, this caught Amelina by suprise but she quickly replied, &quot;Uhm, yeah.&quot; she said, &quot;Sorry but what is your point?&quot; she asked, Rei sighed and said, &quot;Our grandpa WAS a dragon.&quot; he said, &quot;A dragon god to be more exact.&quot; he finished, Amelina stared at Rei for minutes, &quot;Y-You&#39;re joking, right?&quot; she asked, Rei remained silent for seconds and slowly shook his head, &quot;Our father didn&#39;t want to let us know about this because we were too young to know about it, he told us that he died before we were born.&quot; he said, looking at his claws, &quot;In reality, he took his own life after he was affected by a curse.&quot; he finished, a small tear running down his scaly cheek, Amelina hugged Rei to cheer him up, he smiled as he ran his claws against the golden hair of his little sister, &quot;But... How did that curse came to be and what were the effects?&quot; she asked but as Rei was about to start answering her questions, &quot;Also, if our grandfather was a dragon, then how the hell wasn&#39;t our father a dragon?!&quot; she asked, Rei chuckled, &quot;When the world was created, the dragons and humans worked together, there were 12 dragon gods in existence, one of them decided to rebel and kill every human, the rest of them were forced to kill that certain dragon, but before dying, the dragon let out a curse that changed most of the dragons into mindless feral ones, most of the dragon gods were affected by it, only to then take their own lives before causing havoc, the curse seemed to disapear after multiple centuries but it resurfaced, affecting more dragons and our grandfather.&quot; he said, &quot;Our grandfather choose a female human as his mate, so maybe that&#39;s the explination of why our father wasn&#39;t a dragon.&quot; he finished.<br />
<br />
Eventually, Rei and Amelina decided to...</p>
