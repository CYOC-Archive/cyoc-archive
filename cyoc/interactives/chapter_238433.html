<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;hey, Jake can you leave?&quot; Jess was annoyed that her boyfriend&#39;s roommate was still there. &quot;I, um... have some important stuff I need to do first,&quot; Jake said. He grabbed his laptop from the desk and went to Leon&#39;s profile. Thinking quickly he used the alter-reality option to keep Jess from freaking out. Seeing as Leon didn&#39;t seem to mind his transformation he made sure the alicorn centaur could keep his memories. It wasn&#39;t a moment too soon as the towel Leon had put on his head began to fall as Jess got closer to him. &quot;yeah well three&#39;s a crowd so...&quot; unbeknownst to Jess but both Leon and Jake saw their room shift and change. It had to be almost as large as the dorm lobby now.  <br />
<br />
Furthermore, Leon&#39;s bed was now just blankets and a pillow on the ground. &quot;come on you &#39;horny&#39; hunk&quot; Jess said as she grabbed Leon&#39;s wrist. Leon could see she was unbothered by his new body. Given how his room changed he figured Jake did something to help. He was about to say thanks until he saw the nervous look on Jake&#39;s snout.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jake had switched back to Jess&#39;s profile. A big loading sequence covered most of the options. Jake tried to undo this change but got an automated text repeatedly. &#39;cannot add or remove any alterations until the change is complete&#39;. Jake could see that the bar was buffering at 7 percent. Given how Jess was kissing Leon now he guessed it was mental first. As much as he wanted to go, he felt he had to wait until she changed and either change her back or make everyone think she&#39;d always been like that. Switching to his profile he found an option for invisibility. Under the advanced options, he made it so he could still see himself but the others in the room would think he left. Looking up he saw Jess was beginning to move down Leon&#39;s body. He tried to ignore it as he returned to Jess&#39;s profile.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Leon couldn&#39;t remember Jess ever being this forward in their relationship. Normally he was the dominant one. She then got onto her hands and knees as she went under him. The reasoning was evident when he felt his sheath being played with and his large balls jiggling. He moaned as his cock began to escape its sheath. As she sucked Jess felt the most unusual yet fantastic sensation flow through her body. Her face began to push out as she gained muscle mass. As her nose sunk into her muzzle it became large and pink. Jess&#39;s clothes began to strain as a ropy tail grew raising her skirt. Leon soon found himself cuming for the first time with his horse cock. With Jess&#39;s longer face, she could get almost all off it and gulped. &quot;deliCIous&quot; Jess said as her voice cracked. It was now a deep baritone as she struggled to escape under their boyfriend. Jess&#39;s skirt was being raised from the front now as they rose. He was already at six feet. Below his growing cock his dark brown sack broke his panties apart before they hung to his knees. Leon was recovering from that orgasm when Jess plunged his cock into the centaur&#39;s ass. If he thought his cock was sensitive then his anus was an overload of sensations. Jess gripped his boyfriend&#39;s sides as his foot-long cock went all the way in. his balls slapped Leon&#39;s as his clothes ripped apart. His skirt snapped off as his shoes burned open. Like Leon, his feet became hoofs however they were dark brown. His shirt ripped off showing his shrinking breasts and growing pecs. That combined with his widening shoulder caused his useless bra to snap off. His once-trimmed bush became a thick forest of fur. From it, a treasure trail grew to his pecs giving him a massive amount of chest hair between them. On his abs and pecs thinner light brown fur grew, and his nipples shrank and became dark brown. On his shoulders and under his arms thick dark brown fur grew. Then the rest of his skin became covered in brown fur as his neck thickened. His ears elongated into ovals as two horns grew above them.   <br />
<br />
Interestingly his hair didn&#39;t shrink. In fact, it grew longer and more unkempt. It completely covered his eyes as he cummed into his partner&#39;s pussy.  <br />
<br />
As he pulled out he suddenly realized what had happened to him. he also discovered his boyfriend hadn&#39;t had a pussy before. &quot;Leon what happened to... me&quot; he sat on the floor as Leon came down from his second orgasm. Leon turned around and was shocked to see a muscular male Minotaur in front of him. Given the scraps of cloth on and below the myth, Leon deduced who this was. &quot;Jess? What happened?&quot; Leon was suddenly aware of a second hole in his rear. It was below his anus and above his balls. &quot;sorry about that you... guys&quot; The two were given a scare when Jake was suddenly sitting on his bed with the laptop. &quot;when did you get back?&quot; Leon asked. Jake was flustered as he explained what had happened. &quot;I thought both of you being male would ruin your relationship so as Jess was almost done I gave you a pussy. I can take it back and return Jess to normal if HE wants to that is?&quot; Jake finished. he had altered reality so now Jess was wearing a black T-shirt and jeans which were a little taunt across his body. &quot;you sure no one will think I&#39;m a monster?&quot; Jess said. Nodding Jake said, &quot;Well both me and Leon have changed. No one seems bothered by it, and besides I can change us back whenever I want&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Jake then proved this by altering Leon&#39;s and Jess&#39;s profiles to make them aware of all previous changes. &quot;woah&quot; Jess said. &quot;so what do you say? You don&#39;t even have to be a male Minotaur or even a Minotaur at all. I can change you however you want. Call it a gift for well...&quot; Jake gestured to both of them. &quot;well I&#39;d like to try this body out for a day if that&#39;s okay with Leon&quot; Jess gave a pleading look. It looked off given his eyes were covered by his hair and his muzzle. Sighing Leon agreed &quot;As long as you&#39;re happy I&#39;m happy.&quot; he then walked over to Jake and whispered something. &quot;okay&quot; Jake then typed something on the computer. Jess was curious until he felt a familiar opening behind his balls. Smiling Leon kissed his &#39;girlfriend&#39; directly on his muzzle. &quot;just in case you want something special&quot;. Jake smiled as he had been forgiven by the two. Placing his laptop on his desk he wondered what he should do now. Looking at how dramatic Leon&#39;s and Jess&#39;s changes were he felt lame in comparison. Opening his profile he thought about what he could change to be on par with the others. He then spotted the cause of this mess. The random button was right below his mouse. One click and he would get some random change. &quot;The last time, hopefully,&quot; Jake said as he clicked it.</p>
