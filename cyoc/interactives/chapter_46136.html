<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Fresh breeze of the ocean feels nice&#8230; The night is warm and the endless glade of water looks like dark mirror, in which millions of sparks of reflected moonlight dance&#8230; I like this view&#8230; The serenity of the ocean seems eternal and all the worries and troubles dissolve in the endlessness of the water&#8230; All that can happen to one human being seems insignificant, fading in its distance from the great tranquility of the entire world&#8230;
I come here to sort out things that worry me, to find my inner peace&#8230; Every time that I feel emptiness, sadness, anger or loneliness overwhelming my mind, I come here and the Ocean never leaves me without advice&#8230; When I came here this time, I was upset, confused and offended. That was because of Natalie. She is just a kind person that is extremely hard to deal with. Her mood and attitude tend to change every ten minutes and I never know what to expect from her next. She enjoys noise, crowds and revels. I, on the opposite, can&#8217;t stand it for long. She can be angry, spoiled, irritating and bilious, rude and impulsive&#8230; But I know another her &#8211; gentle and fragile, stripped of the cynic and cheerful mask&#8230; And that is why I&#8217;m still with her. We have been meeting for three months now&#8230; It&#8217;s funny &#8211; we were studying together all these years in high-school, but got together only now, when our paths accidentally crossed again&#8230; I think, my feelings may be deeper than just desire to have a girlfriend&#8230; Or maybe I&#8217;m just fooling myself about it. Well, it certainly doesn&#8217;t matter now. Tonight she was dead drunk. We had a fight. I left her. I think, it should be better for both of us. I am used to be alone &#8211; my whole life there was a distance between me and other people. And she, I hope, can find some guy whose character will be more fitting for her.
I was deep in my thoughts, sitting on this small rock not far from the shore. My clothes were left on the deserted beach &#8211; no one visits it at this time, so I didn&#8217;t worry about someone stealing them. The lapping of the waters was alternated with some strange splashes and sometimes unusual&#8230;hissing? Ah, never mind. Must be some fish&#8230; I looked at the sky &#8211; infinite space filled with billons of bright stars&#8230; There is the nebula of the Milky Way&#8230; The scope of distances in there can not ever be grasped with tiny powers of a human mind&#8230; I, as many people before, looked at the stars and felt delight and sadness at the same time&#8230; Will we ever reach the stars, when the problems of the day grow tremendously big, unless we escape them from time to time? 
I never saw anything approaching as I relaxed on the rock. Perhaps if I had been more alert, I would have noticed the large black slick on the ocean slowly float over towards me. A warm, slimy feeling overcame my foot as it finally reached me and began to firmly wrap around my foot. I looked down, seeing darkness in the water , that slowly crawls up my leg&#8230;
What was it? A jelly fish? An oil spill? It felt slightly rubbery and foreign. Before I could try to shake it off, the substance leapt up from the ocean and tangled around my knee with black oily sprouts! Squirming, I tried to climb up higher on the rock. It's no use! With each attempt to escape, the liquid vinyl-like substance only wrapped around my leg tighter! At one moment I felt my other leg slipping on the wet surface of the rock. A hard hit with the back of my head and everything went blurry and distanced&#8230; I kind of felt my body slide into water&#8230; Into the cloud of blackness. Not fully aware of what is happening, I felt it climbing over all of my body, coating it like a vile second skin. I remember thrashing violently, trying to get it off before I finally blacked out.
I slowly drifted back into consciousness. Soft sand was all around me - was I on the main beach? How did I get here? Eyes widening in horror, I felt the vinyl wrapped around my body. It was still there! Slightly pulsating oily substance covered my torso, legs down to the knees and arms to the elbows. I felt it slightly move, as if it was constantly flowing over my body&#8230;
And then something happened! The creature (if this is a living organism at all) started acting weird, pressing onto my body! Tightening around my hips and waist the vinyl leaked under and right through the material of my swim shorts, completely dissolving them and pressing itself to my bare skin. I felt it getting deeper into me through the pores of my skin. In seconds it was like acid or fire inside of my veins! I realized that I have to get this thing off me as fast as possible. Tugging and pulling on it, I tried to rip it off of my body. As pain inside of me was gone, I felt a new pain &#8211; pain of every ripple! It felt as if this vinyl was glued onto my skin! 
Quickly climbing upwards, it covered the rest of my chest and neck. A strange, tingling sensation came over my nipples. What was it doing to me? The tingling grew stronger and stronger, changing to a painful itch that couldn't be stopped. The  veins below my skin darken, being filled with blackness&#8230; With a shiver down my spine, I feel my nipples grow suddenly - becoming larger and very perky. What's happening to me? I try to resist, but I can't stop myself from squeezing them tight and pulling on them. Strange sensations echo through my body, and I feel my chest push against the tight vinyl. Becoming tighter and tighter, my chest aches. Breasts are beginning to grow! A sickening horror shocks me to my senses - the creature is not only gluing itself to my skin, it's changing my body&#8230; Changing it into the body of a woman! 
I get up on my knees, feeling the changes to start accelerating now. Grabbing at my chest, I push against the growing breasts. It's no use. Instead of compacting back into a male form, they rapidly grow rounder, fuller, and larger. The shiny vinyl covered breasts - MY breasts - block most of my field of vision as I look down at my changing body. A sharp pain overcomes me as the material tightens against my waist, compacting it into a narrow female form. Something happens down at my lower body&#8230; As the pressure on my crotch suddenly increases, becoming more and more uncomfortable, I also start feeling the pressure building up inside of my hips, making them wider!
As if the changes weren't already bad enough, I feel my new female nipples become even harder. The already massive breasts continue to expand against the tight vinyl. Ashamed, the feeling of the huge, round, tight breasts starts to turn me on. Ugh! I'm supposed to look at *other* women's large breasts, not my own! I get up, standing unstable on my numb legs&#8230;As the male part of me continues to grow more excited, the horrid material seems to notice. It rapidly constricts and shrinks between my legs and around the hips, pushing painfully against me. Pressure increases again and again without limit, causing more and more pain. My body can't hold out. At one moment the tightening vinyl finally wins, rapidly crushing my equipment and pushing with it into my body. The pain blinds me as I scream, pain and strange hollow-like, extremely pleasant sensation that comes over my lower body as substance and flesh continue compacting up inside of me. With a slight wiggle, my hips expand even more, becoming extremely wide and round. 
My legs lengthen and the vinyl finishes forming into the form of a one-piece female swimsuit. Desperate, I try to scratch the damn thing of me &#8211; my changed nails slipping on it&#8217;s smooth surface. It still can't be removed - it's as though it's glued to my skin forever.
It feels as though the change has stopped. Scared, upset, and traumatized I look at what the creature has done to my body. Bringing my hand closer to my eyes, I see the darkness in my veins slowly dissolve, leaving my skin unnaturally pale, white as marble. As I look down at the rest of my body, I see how different it is from the one I&#8217;m used to&#8230;  Long, slender legs. Wide hips. Round, feminine rear end. Unbelievably massive, heavy breasts. And between my legs... something sexy and alluring. The creature is now permanently "glued" to my body in the form of a sexy, black, shiny vinyl swimsuit. Tugging at it is no use, it won't budge! I feel this black creature&#8217;s substance rush through my body, making my breasts ache and my hips throb. Everything about my new body is overemphasized and incredibly sexual in nature. Even as I make a few steps down the beach barely holding the balance of my new body, my hips sway and my breasts lightly bounce under the swimsuit. 
What am I going to do? I need to get this thing off of me, I need to change back! But&#8230; I start to realize how weak I suddenly became. My legs &#8211; the legs of a super model, no less &#8211; could not hold me anymore. I dropped down on my knees, then, unable to hold even in this position, collapsed on the sand. For a few seconds I was looking at the stars, unable even to stretch my hand to the sky. And then my consciousness faded into the darkness.



I found myself hearing a voice. A very distant one&#8230; It was calling out to me. How long has it been there? I don&#8217;t know, I just suddenly understood that there is a voice. Suddenly it grew louder and I also felt someone shaking my shoulder. &#8220;Hey, lady, are you alright?&#8221; My head exploded into sharp pain and I hit the arm of whoever was shaking me.
- God, stop it&#8230; - I mumbled, trying to overcome the pain and discomfort &#8211; where do you see ladies anyway, idiot&#8230;? 
- Hey, I just want to help, don&#8217;t get angry&#8230; - The voice is that of a young guy, from what I can tell, being unable to open my eyes.
I sat up, feeling very odd, and grabbed my face with both my arms&#8230; 
- You must have had a looong night, eh? &#8211; I swung my arm, hoping that I&#8217;ll hit him in the head. He must have dodged.
- Hey, easy!
- Shut up&#8230; - it felt kinda&#8217; weird&#8230; My throat was moving in somehow different way when I tried to speak. And the voice was&#8230; different&#8230; it was hoarse and crackled but sounded higher a bit. 
- Hey, listen&#8230; You don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re feeling well&#8230;
- Leave me&#8230; alone&#8230; - I was starting to get irritated.
- Look, look, you know, you were here when we came and there also were some clothes are they yours? 
There was something this night&#8230; Something&#8230; My clothes on the beach&#8230;
I nodded:
- Sure they are. Whose else can they be?
- Ah well&#8230; You know, these are guy&#8217;s clothes&#8230;
Headache got weaker and I felt like ability to think is coming back into my head. And I also felt an ice-cold lump start forming inside of me&#8230;
- What do you mean &#8220;guy&#8217;s&#8221;?
- Well, I mean that these clothes can hardly fit such a beautiful girl like yourself&#8230;
My heart seems to have stopped. Girl like myself&#8230; Fear and panic merge together, making the cold inside of my chest grow, filling all my being&#8230; The images of what happened at night once again rushed through my senses, flashing before my inner sight. 
- No&#8230; - I breathed out&#8230; - that can&#8217;t be&#8230;
But as I open my eyes reality strikes me in the face. My hands are small and gentle, with long and delicate fingers, each featuring a long shiny black nail. Lowering my arm, I look onto what has become with the rest of my body. Although the sun is bright and the air is hot, I feel the cold sweat all over me, horror gripping my insides and crushing my mind as I understand that all that happened at night was absolutely real&#8230;
- Hey! What&#8217;s wrong?! &#8211; I feel the hand grab my shoulder again.
That simple action pulls me out from the trap of my mind. I look at him, my eyes must be looking as ones of a madman. Breathing heavily, I grab the pile of clothes in his hands and get up.
- Yeah, thanks for everything&#8230; These really are mine&#8230; ah&#8230; puff&#8230; yeah&#8230; I gotta go&#8230;
I look around. The beach is filled with people. I need to get home&#8230; I make a few steps, new feelings confusing and disorienting. The body is now balanced completely in other way and I have to make a hell of an effort to just stand, let alone walk&#8230; 
- Hey-hey-hey! &#8211; His hand grabs my shoulder again. Arrrgh, that starts to annoy me&#8230;
- What? Let me be! I&#8217;m leaving this goddamned place, filled with idiots who stick their noses into what is clearly not theirs business!
- Wait up, let me help you!
- I don&#8217;t need your help!
- Gosh, I got a car, I can give you a lift. You are clearly in no condition to go somewhere on your own.
For a moment I stood there, thinking. Okay, I&#8217;m really not gonna get home fast with that much control over my body. Maybe I can take at least this tiny advantage from this situation. 
- Okay&#8230; 


I opened my eyes. It&#8217;s all some kind of crazy nightmare&#8230; I looked at him. God, he really pisses me off, looking like if I am a girl. Looking like he already sees himself having fun with me. This thought alone made me disgusted.
- Thanks for your help. Really.
- Sure, I just couldn&#8217;t resist helping such a charming person&#8230; - he smiled. I knew that smile &#8211; &#8220;she&#8217;s now mine&#8221; kind of smile. I&#8217;m used to seeing that kind of smile on the faces of some of my friends, who usually have a different girlfriend every week. Steel moving clumsy, I get out of the car. That dumbass exits his car too and approaches me, as I stand with a pile of clothes in my hands. 
- Can I help you to carry them to your home? 
- No.
- Maybe it would be better for me to see you get home safe? You still don&#8217;t look too good.
- No, I&#8217;m fine. &#8211; I finally decide how to get home unnoticed and turn around.
- Can I at least get your name?
- Get lost.
- Hey! Stop! &#8211; Again! Again he grabs my shoulder. At this moment I can&#8217;t keep my annoyance from transforming into anger. Keeping the clothes with left hand, I turn around and thrust my right fist into his stomach. A short gasp and he is down on the ground, trying to pull some air into his lungs. 
- Don&#8217;t you ever dare to grab my shoulder! And leave me alone! &#8211; with a quick turn, I go away, trying to step as fast as I can. 
In a few minutes I could not worry of him catching up with me &#8211; going through a couple of courts I entered the building in which I rented a small apartment. Having no slightest wish to run into someone &#8211; especially someone I know &#8211; I took the stairs. Lucky for me, there was no one there and I managed to get to my floor unnoticed. Surprised by my luck &#8211; there was no one there too, I found the keys in one of the pockets and entered my humble home. Inside I took a deep breath and locked the door.
Only after that I released myself from the tight grip of self-control. Dropping my clothes I make a few steps into my apartment. Everything is so familiar, so comfortably usual&#8230; And I am the only thing that doesn&#8217;t fit. I drop on my knees, my breasts bounce under the tight material reminding what I have become. I look down at my body and tears run down from my eyes. I am now tall, graceful and sexy young woman, encased in a very tight and sexy swimsuit &#8211; shiny, smooth, latex-looking&#8230; But I am not me anymore, I have all my life destroyed. This thing took everything from me &#8211; my voice, my face, my identity&#8230; I try to grapple the edge of the suit with my new nails. No use. Pulling it is like pulling my own skin. This thing is permanently fused to my body and, it seems, there is no way I can ever get it off. Devastated, I lean against the wall. &#8220;What have you done to me&#8230;? What do you want&#8230;?&#8221; &#8211; I address no one in particular, although I know that this thing is alive. But it doesn&#8217;t respond. Why has it changed me? Maybe it can&#8217;t otherwise? Or maybe&#8230; Maybe it likes that? I look down onto my body once again, trying to understand. The swimsuit is tight, but not uncomfortable. It doesn&#8217;t hide any curve of beautiful female body, only pointing out it&#8217;s attractiveness and sexuality. The breasts are huge, but not too big, they are of beautiful shape, round and tight. Even the nipples are clearly visible through the material of the swimsuit. My stomach is flat and beautiful, not even slight of fat. Legs are long and graceful, with elegant small feet. The nails on fingers on my legs are also black. My skin looks unnaturally pale, almost white. The hair on my body is gone &#8211; the skin is smooth, soft and completely hairless. A thought comes into my mind &#8211; I haven&#8217;t even seen my face. I stand up and go to bathroom. When I was determined to get home I haven&#8217;t noticed, but now I feel my breasts slightly bounce with my every step, my hips move in some ridiculous, but pleasant way&#8230; I feel the emptiness between my legs and it is uncomfortable, unusual&#8230; and it turns me on. As I feel my thighs touch each other with their inner sides, strong sensation rises somewhere inside of me. I try to suppress it, being embarrassed and confused&#8230; For some time, I am successful. 
I&#8217;m in the bathroom. I have a shower cabin with a mirror on the inside &#8211; full-length of my body. I enter the cabin, feeling the strange sensation grow stronger, as I look on my reflection. The woman on the other side is just stunningly beautiful. It is nearly impossible to associate myself with her. Her body is perfect and the skin-tight swimsuit makes her even better. I force myself to shift my gaze from the body to the her&#8230; my&#8230; face. That creature likes black&#8230; The hair on my head was black as night &#8211; or even more. My hair was short, black and shiny, my right eye hidden behind the fringe. I turned on the shower, feeling warm water run down my hair and skin. My skin is alabaster-white, and it makes gothic make-up on my face look even sexier. Make-up that flowing water didn&#8217;t wash away&#8230; The black eyeshadow makes my eyes, which became dark and seductive, look even more enigmatic and tempting. My lips are full, covered in black shiny lipstick that makes them look like my latex-like torso. Or maybe it is their &#8220;natural&#8221; color now? Or even&#8230; Maybe they not only look like latex, but actually are that tempting vinyl? I felt them with my tongue, them being perfectly smooth, rubbery&#8230; As my double on the opposite side of the mirror licked her vinyl lips too, the feeling of ecstasy overwhelmed me, forming in my abdomen and going down to my crotch&#8230; As I grow more and more excited I press my body onto the mirror, by breasts feeling exciting pressure. My hard and itchy nipples below the latex of swimsuit send electrifying pleasure running through my nerves It seems like I and another me in the mirror press hardly onto each other&#8230; Stretching my neck, I draw my face closer to the reflection, looking at the face of the girl I could only dream of... Breathing heavily I stretch my lips and mine touch hers &#8211; the mirror just doesn&#8217;t exist in the world of my dream. The pleasure fills my body and my mind to the edge. The next few minutes are filled only with pure ecstasy, one that I never experienced before. I don&#8217;t remember these minutes very good, but they were filled with most intense feelings that I have ever experienced.
When I came to my senses, I found myself reclining in the cabin, pleasant sensations still echoing through my body. But as I slowly realized what happened, the most intense pleasure came to seem nothing, compared to most intense embarrassment and shame. My face must have become as red as tomato, when I thought of what just happened. I looked down on the swimsuit with mixed feelings &#8211; fear, anger, interest and&#8230; excitement. Damned thing&#8230; I got up and staggered out of the cabin. Getting into bedroom I fell onto my bed. Before I could realize, I was already asleep.


I wasn&#8217;t asleep. My mind balanced on a thin line between &#8220;awake&#8221; and &#8220;asleep&#8221;, feeling the real world in a distance, behind the curtain of thoughts and dreams. But I was consumed by despair of my change and it was filling my body. Half-asleep, I could feel breasts and emptiness in my crotch, soft and tight vinyl fabric over new highly-sensitive areas of my body. It filled my insides with ice-cold anger. I am not girl&#8230; I refuse&#8230; I reject&#8230; I felt cold. Sticky black substance is all around, inside and outside, taking away my face and identity, leaving me in a prison of someone else&#8217;s body&#8230; Anger and sadness mixing with despair, were tearing my mind from inside and I felt tears running down my face&#8230; And then pain struck. Along my spine it ran, filling my skull with lightning bolts, drilling my forehead and eyes, concentrating in the back of my head&#8230; 
Then I've been lying on my back, my eyes wide open. I felt pain slowly go away, but was unable to move... It has come into contact, forcing its way into my head. It is gone now&#8230; But now I understood my &#8220;swimsuit&#8221;. I guess it found some way to give me knowledge it had. Some of it, at least. I forced my arm to move, touching vinyl on my stomach. Long time it was asleep, and then, for years it has been floating in the seas. It wanted to eat. It needed &#8220;mind&#8221; to feed&#8230; I guess the &#8220;mind&#8221; means nervous system, complex enough &#8211; one that belongs to sentient creatures. But when nervous systems of sea creatures were too simple, their bodies were just consumed and creature went on to it&#8217;s next victim. And once it found human &#8211; me. When it connected to my &#8220;mind&#8221; it read my memories and personality, evolving into something different. It still remains an animal, or a machine, or whatever it is, but now it carries some of the traits of my personality&#8230; It was painfully obvious now, why did it change me&#8230; In a way, it &#8220;told&#8221; me why. It doesn&#8217;t find male body attractive - just like I don&#8217;t. It finds female body most beautiful, just like I do. But it can&#8217;t grasp the difference between genders, it doesn&#8217;t understand how can I be fascinated by a beautiful girl because I am a guy. And it reshaped my body into the form I desire, unable to understand that I desire to have it in my hands&#8230; Not to have it myself. A lone tear ran down my right cheek. 
And then everything became crystal-clear. All my worries were gone in an instant. I felt different. Why? I sat, my boobs bouncing, two seductive spheres of flesh, constantly reminding me of what I am now. But I don&#8217;t feel pain in my soul for some reason. I am glad. I was a guy before and I remain one. But having breasts is pretty funny, I can feel them &#8211; heavy and beautifully shaped breasts of my own&#8230; Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop&#8230;Dumbass, what are you happy about? I tried to analyze my feelings. I had no more grief and remorse about my condition, my mind only focused on opportunities that this body gives me&#8230; Why? But then I looked at my body and understood. From under the swimsuit, dark liquid was slowly moving, encasing my arms and legs in shiny substance. It is the suit. It can affect my nervous system &#8211; my mind. And it somehow found a way to manipulate my emotions, suppressing those that it doesn&#8217;t like&#8230; Sly monster. But I don&#8217;t feel bad about it&#8230; I guess that&#8217;s for the best &#8211; such condition allows me not to fall into despair and depression. I only hope it is not permanent&#8230; But I also understand, that I like it and to some degree I want it to be permanent. I felt freedom. Grabbing my boobs, covered by thin vinyl, I moaned as almost painful pleasure streamed down my body, making my head feel light and filling my abdomen with intense sensation&#8230; That&#8217;s so good&#8230; My passion grew, as I touched, felt and stroked my body, my huge breasts, my flat stomach, my round hips and soft tight butt&#8230; But I made myself stop, although I had to strain my will for it. Instead, I turned my attention to how suit changed. But it was almost as arousing as touching myself. Vinyl spread down to my wrists, changing from substance form to tight latex, covering my skin. My legs were completely encased already, and I felt it going rising to my head&#8230;but it only climbed up to my lower jaw, only slightly covering my face. Moments later my hands were encased too, fingers and wrist hidden below the tight and shiny blackness. Warmth grew in between my legs, as I looked at my exciting tight latex bodysuit, without single seam, zip line, or anything like that. Sexy female body, from head to toe encased in latex&#8230; I love that creature&#8230; But then I felt pain in my feet. Latex was reshaping itself there and I was a bit confused, but still excited and curious. It hardened there, forming a knee-high shell and forcing my feet to painfully straighten into vertical position. A few seconds later I had my legs trapped into boots with ridiculously high platform-like heels. Pain can bring pleasure too, it seems&#8230; I stood up, having trouble maintaining my balance. First few steps were difficult, but after that... It didn&#8217;t become more comfortable or easy. And I liked it. I enjoyed it. I knew that I look strange, but I enjoyed walking on these things and having this suit. Having this body! My every move, even the slightest one, was followed by the sound of squeaking latex&#8230; It was turning me on, and combined with how I felt it with my skin&#8230;It took some time to came back to my shower cabin (why was I so embarrassed with my reaction to my new body before? I know that I am thinking differently from back then, but&#8230; Ah, never mind)
My reflection was just gorgeous. But, looking closely, I saw that I have changed. My hair grew longer, and the eyeshadow around my eyes became darker&#8230; They eyes that looked back at me were also different&#8230; Not my old grey, not my new dark eyes&#8230; I removed the hair that was hiding half of my face and looked into light-blue, almost white eyes. These look good, but a little crazy&#8230; I like it. Smile looked wonderful on this face&#8230; I closed my eyes. No. I need to remain myself. I need to stick to the way I usually feel and act, as I remember it. This thing wants me to lose myself, I feel that&#8230; I felt tingling all over my body and opened my eyes, to see rubber rise, covering my chin and going up to my lower lip. As my lips are rubbery too, when seam between them were gone, my lips seemed a continuation of latex that covered my lower jaw. Then latex sprouted a thin line that went up to my left eye, encircled it and then went further, getting lost in my hair. God&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what that thing is up to&#8230; But I like how it makes me look. And I don&#8217;t like that I like it&#8230; My rational mind is different from my emotional personality, so I feel some kind of duality&#8230; This is strange and pretty hard&#8230; Very hard. I won&#8217;t be what it wants me to be. I don&#8217;t want to change the way I feel&#8230; But&#8230; 
Suddenly something seemed to get wrong. What was it? I analyzed my senses, but it was so hard to understand, to put my finger on what this problem was&#8230; And then it grew &#8211; and I understood. Pain and discomfort in my legs traveled up to my thighs. Looking down, I saw that latex got tighter. What the hell? It was getting tighter and tighter, causing pain in the muscles on my legs &#8211; long and beautifully shaped legs that became even more sexy with latex tight as second skin&#8230; Familiar warmth formed in my abdomen&#8230; This feeling is also so different from my male life, it makes me enjoy my body, makes me want to grab my breasts in painful yet pleasant grasp&#8230; No! No&#8230;It&#8217;s not me&#8230; I shouldn&#8217;t want&#8230; Pain struck as latex encircling my waist increased pressure onto my body, compacting it, crushing it&#8230; Breathing became harder. I felt dizzy. What are you doing to me, beast&#8230; My vision darkened and I fell. My legs were painfully pressed onto when I dropped on my knees, suit being so tight that it restricted movements with unimaginable strength&#8230; After that came the turn of my arms, I felt them being compressed with such power, that it&#8217;s possible for blood stop flowing in them&#8230; Although my blood is black now, who knows if I even need this blood to flow&#8230; My insides throbbed as pressed onto my butt, hugging half-spheres of my butt-cheeks, slipping between them, pressing onto my intimate female area&#8230; It was becoming hard to breath, not only because of pressure on my stomach&#8230; Strong new feelings were overwhelming me as I felt latex strained in my crotch, pain and pleasure combined ripping apart my mind. Why do I resist it? Why don&#8217;t I embrace the pleasure and ecstasy? But this body is still&#8230; Latex pressed stronger, now every square centimeter of my body in powerful grasp of this blackness. I moaned as my breasts were pushed together, skin on their inner sides touching&#8230; And vinyl then leaked between them, filling all the space, enveloping every curve of my body&#8230; My mind gave up. I just dissolved in pleasure, in whirlwind of  joy and happiness&#8230;


My mind is blank. Passion. Pleasure. This can&#8217;t be compared to my petty desires. It&#8217;s higher goal. Human lives only to please himself. This is simple as life, and so obvious&#8230; How couldn&#8217;t I see it my whole life? It&#8217;s the pleasure what one seeks. Human is egoist, selfish and not caring for any other. Moral and ethics are fiction, lie and hypocrisy, created to make the herd work for advantage of those in power, to bring them what they desire &#8211; ultimately, to please them. So simple&#8230; and so exciting. So&#8230; Now I will hunt for pleasure. Live for pleasure. This creature took my gender &#8211; but gave me exciting new body&#8230; I am turned on by simple look onto myself &#8211; and that&#8217;s wonderful. I feel the creature now. It desires the same &#8211; pleasure, excitement, domination. I know that this is what we desire both. It is happy that I see now, that I feel, that I know how I should use my life, my body and my power&#8230; And I will. I will serve only my own desires from now on. 
The doorbell. It sounded again. I just realized that it&#8217;s ringing for the third or fourth time. Hah&#8230; Who could that be? Standing up, I found balance again, and made a few steps. Heels clucked on the floor, but my breasts didn&#8217;t juggle anymore, fixated by suit&#8217;s firm grip. Maintaining balance with body moving like that is more than enough task, also considering dizziness and overall light-headed state of mine. Somehow reaching for the door, I turned the key &#8211; latex-covered fingers almost didn&#8217;t feel the touch of metal &#8211; and opened the door wide. 
The coat fell onto the floor, revealing beatifull shape of her spine. Thin arms stroked her butt, with tiny panties visible between buttocks. Her back is half-hidden&#8230; no, &#8220;half&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word, because the transparent top reveals every tiny curve of her beautifully tanned body.
- I hope that view compensates you enough for our yesterday fight, my sweet? If not, there is something I can do to make you forget it&#8230; 
- Natalie&#8230; - I said, before realizing whose mouth will speak that name. It was spoken aloud by sexy female voice. 
She turned around, eyes wide, confusion, shame and shock on her face, but my eyes were drawn to her wobbling breasts under tiny gown. Small nipples stick out of her breasts, thin fabric on top of them.
- Who are you?
- Don&#8217;t be so surprised&#8230; It&#8217;s me &#8211; I looked into her eyes and smiled &#8211; I&#8217;m new David


- Don&#8217;t try to fool me. Where is David? Is he with you?
- In a way&#8230; Yes, he is. 
- Let me in. Who are you, what are you doing here?
- Oh&#8230; - I went silent for few seconds. &#8220;Indeed, what am I doing here?&#8221;
- Are you a whore he hired? &#8211; I just love how her eyes shine with anger
- No, nothing like that &#8211; smile formed on my face by itself, independently of my mind which was consumed by contemplating the beautiful view in front of me. 
- Stop looking at me like that. I ask again, who are you? Or should I be guessing till the Doomsday?

I looked at her. This might get fun. A little acting and I might gain something quite interesting.
- David is dead. I killed him.

Her blue eyes opened widely, as mask of shock was forming on her face. She made a step back, but I already knew what to do. I stretched my arm, feeling the latex protest, grasping my flash with even greater force, and grabbed her shoulder. I felt ecstatic, looking in her eyes full of fear, as waves of pressure were moving over my body grasping tighter and releasing my breasts, butt cheeks, pressing against my nipples, massaging my sensitive flesh in the new, most female part of my body &#8230; Passion filled me to the bottom of my being, fed by my suit, fed by her presence&#8230; I want her to be mine. 

Suit knew what I wanted, it wanted the same, our consciousnesses were linked. It followed my deepest wishes, making it real. I felt pain in the right arm, but it was insignificant. My hand started changing &#8211; not only its latex shell, but my flesh inside too. Bones of my fingers grew, elongating them, and latex formed shells around my fingers, turning my hand into sharp claw. Natalie froze in place, her mouth open, eyes shining with terror. I already have a plan, and this element makes her understand, that it is inhuman power in work here&#8230;

She didn&#8217;t even try to resist, when I dragged her inside and closed the door. I pressed her against the wall with my body, feeling exciting warmth of her body through my latex second skin. I rubbed against her, feeling the tight pushes of her breasts against mine, as she breathed heavily. My lips touched hers and a shiver of ecstasy passed over me, from head to toe&#8230; Finally&#8230; I finally kissed her. We met seven days ago, and haven&#8217;t kissed yet&#8230; Her lips were so cold, lifeless&#8230; Yes, she is terrified, paralyzed by my actions&#8230; Now it&#8217;s time to continue my play.

I forced myself to back off, with visible internal struggle. No struggle, of course, but I want her to be mine on her own will, I need to make her want it. And I know how. I stepped two steps back, nearly falling in my uncomfortable &#8220;boots&#8221; and restrictive suit.
- Forgive me, Natalie &#8211; I said, making my voice tremble.

It has been about two minutes, before these words finally reached her mind.

- What&#8230; do you mean.? What is the meaning of this? Who are you? What have you done to David? How the hell do you know my name?!
- David is gone&#8230; - my voice was sad &#8211; I was him. Before. But I changed. I&#8230; I am David no more, I&#8217;m afraid. He is alive. In me, in my personality, but his looks don&#8217;t belong to him, anymore, and his mind is altered, cruelly, unimaginably&#8230;
- What&#8230; are you&#8230; talking about? &#8211; she stepped closer. A small victory &#8211; I am going to call the police, if you don&#8217;t explain yourself! And what the fucking hell is with your arm?!

I hid my claw, that didn&#8217;t return to normal (and I didn&#8217;t want it to, it is quite a nice addition) behind my back. I stepped a few more steps back, and sat down, back against the wall. Now, time to be sentimental&#8230;
- Do you remember, how we met again, Natalie? &#8211; I said, trying to mimic my usual intonations &#8211; we were studying in the same class in school for whole 10 years, but still, you never noticed Dave &#8211; humble, quiet and grey in every way guy. He was isolated from the rest of the class, having only two or three friends&#8230; But he looked at you, admired you and dreamed that you&#8217;d turn your attention to him once&#8230; Which never happened. You stayed in your circle of cheery and happy girls and guys, who had parties all the time&#8230; You were meeting with several guys, but you didn&#8217;t look really interested in them. Then we graduated, and David lost even smallest touch he had to you. 

I raised my head and looked up, into her eyes. She was hesitating. She believed, didn&#8217;t believe, was afraid and curious at the same time. Her body was shaking, she still was pressing her back to wall of my corridor.
- And a week ago, you met him, at the party that took place in your house. His pal and colleague invited him to go to the party, where he could relax and such&#8230; so he said. But David saw you, and his feelings awakened again. For some reason, you noticed him &#8211; maybe because of the excitement in his eyes that you saw? And then there were evenings alone, two movies seen together&#8230; Yesterday you tried to seduce me, acting so straightforward... I could not do it that way, I loved you for so long so I just wanted to be near you, to love you&#8230; To have a relationship, romantic evenings, love&#8230; I left&#8230;

At some point, my feelings came back from the distant curtain, for I was telling truth. It was hard, suit couldn&#8217;t withstand the sadness inside of me. But I helped it, and returned to my current state.

She came closer and kneeled before me. Tips of her fingers touched my cheek, and pleasure was like electricity, that came from her hand and deepened into my body&#8230;
- David&#8230; Is that&#8230; really you?
- It was. 
- What happened&#8230;
- The suit&#8230;

Before she could reply, I stood up and walked into my bedroom. Platform-like heels were still hard to walk on, so my hips wiggled from side to side, as I made small steps, latex bringing pleasant pain to my thighs and buttcheeks with every step. I made it to my bed and sat on it&#8217;s edge, grabbing clothes that had been lying around. Torn jeans and a shirt&#8230; I knew that Natalie followed me, but stopped in the doorway. I felt it, or the suit told me&#8230; 
- You see what I am now&#8230; But it is not only me. Black liquid was in the sea. I went there to clear my head. But I stumbled into this blackness. It covered me, entered me, re-made me. It manipulated and humiliated me, turned into woman&#8230; Into a woman, can you understand that? All that I have been is nothing now&#8230; It was horrible. It was so horrible&#8230; - I made my voice was faltering, and it was not too hard to simulate. Echo of my feeling was still reaching my mind &#8211; My veins filled with black substance. I could feel as my chest expanded, forming these&#8230;things! And I know, that down there, it&#8217;s female body. I feel it. I feel my&#8230; Ugh&#8230; vagina&#8230; I have it&#8230; God&#8230; When the suit presses onto it&#8230; Presses hard&#8230; It makes me mad. And yet it isn&#8217;t the worse. The suit covered my body. Not like this at first, it looked more like a swimsuit, one-piece swimsuit. It can&#8217;t ever be removed. It can change it&#8217;s position, but will always stay on my body. It changed my metabolism, so I won&#8217;t even need taking it off to go to bathroom anymore. I don&#8217;t need to go. And this too, isn&#8217;t the worst. When I got home it assumed this form. And it entered my mind. I might not be quite myself, my emotions are different. My feelings are different. I feel less concealed in my shell of loneliness. And it makes me react strangely. I want you. I love you. But this is not excuse&#8230; And of course, it is impossible to believe. In a way, David is dead, and I&#8217;m his remains, that still live.

For a few minutes we both were silent. Then she spoke. &#8220;David&#8230; I believe you&#8221;. It worked. She feels sorry for me&#8230; She feels something. And I&#8217;ll make sure, that her feelings will lead her to desire&#8230; Oh, I will. This suit&#8217;s gift of silenced conscience is just great. I told the truth, but feelings that I pretended to be overran with, were of my usual self. Now, they are just a tool to gain, what I want&#8230; And I want the girl I love. I want her to love me, to want me&#8230; I&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to make her want me</p>
