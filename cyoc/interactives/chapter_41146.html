<p id="chapter-text" class="serif"><Br>Wanting to now take the mansion for himself, along with his brothers, Rusty decided that it was time to make their move and so he spoke to his brothers that were all waiting attentively for Rusty's command.</Br>
<Br>"Today will be the day that this place will be ours. Today will be the day that our kind shall once again rule the earth and those that once made our kind extinct shall know fear. The hunters will become the hunted and they will be brought into our ranks whether they choose this or not. This is our long-term goal, but first let us attack the others!"</Br>
<Br>Everyone cheered with a deafening howl, while Rusty looked at his second in command and winked. Chad knew that Rusty was allowing him to lead the charge and he was not about to let his new found companion down. Chad raised his muscular, fur covered arm and swiped it across the air, signaling the other werewolves to attack. Within a flash everyone, including Rusty and Chad were running through the main hall reaching the partition quickly. With a small amount of controlled effort, Rusty dropped the magic that hid the doors and used the magic for them all to open, ensuring quick work of the females that would oppose their kind.</Br>
<Br>With everyone else attacking the women; hearing blood curdling screams as the werewolves pounced on the women, tearing them apart with their claws and fangs, feasting on their flesh and drinking of their blood; Rusty and Chad moved back into the room with the portal to ensure that Marcia would not succeed in her task. Within seconds of entering the room, Marcia and Christine came through the once non-existent door, breathing heavily only to find that they were cornered again by the very creatures they thought they had escaped. Seeing Marcia and Christine, Chad went to attack, but Rusty stopped him as it would be Rusty's job to dispose of Marcia.</Br>
<Br>Rusty turned his head to look at Chad, his second in command, as Chad looked at him. "You can take out Christine, but Marcia is mine!"</Br>
<Br>Chad nodded, then ran up on Christine and made short work of her. While Chad feasted upon Christine's carcass, Rusty slowly approached Marcia, snarling and showing off his fangs.</Br>
<Br>"Ah... Marcia, it has been a while!"</Br>
<Br>"Who... who are you?"</Br>
<Br>"Oh... don't you know? I thought you were smarter than that Marcia!"</Br>
<Br>"How... how do you know my name, let alone... how are you even able to speak? I thought werewolves lost their ability to speak once transformed."</Br>
<Br>"Well... that once made the two of us. I suppose that should fill you in on my human identity."</Br>
<Br>"Rusty!? Is that really you?"</Br>
<Br>"There you go Marcia! I knew you were smart enough to figure it out. I have longed for the day where I would become your superior. Females have never had the fortitude to lead and now, I lead those you saw slaughter every female in sight!"</Br>
<Br>"Rusty! What has happened to you? You used to be so kind to me and other women around you. I think I need to get rid of that thing... that portal which you position yourself near. It has changed you! It has made you this... thing, this... this monster before me!"</Br>
<Br>"Yes, yes the portal has done this to me Marcia, but it is not something that you are going to shut down because I was chosen to protect it. I was chosen to be the leader that I have always wanted to be, with a magnificent body and wonderful inner attributes! The portal has imbued me with it's power and when I succeed in taking this place to protect it, I will use it to do as I please!"</Br>
<Br>"Rusty, you are insane! I am going to stop you and this ridiculous plan of yours. Now, stand back so I can close this portal as you call it!"</Br>
<Br>"Marcia, I wouldn't do that if I were you! You know that I a man that will not abandon what I have set my mind to and if it takes me killing you... well, then so be it!"</Br>
<Br>Marcia tried to get around Rusty to use everything she had to close the portal, even though she didn't know what would work. She figured that if she could just tap into the energy and say the incantation backwards, it might seal the portal closed and stop the werewolf takeover. Rusty, not really wanting to kill her, hesitated and gave her time to start the incantation.</Br>
<Br>"Dloheb ot uoy rof ereht eb lliw sthgis gninethgirf."</Br>
<Br>"Marcia!" Rusty roared with a growl at the end. "Stop what you are doing right now! I do not want to kill you, but I will if I have to!"</Br>
<Br>Marcia ignored the warning and continued. "Sdlofnu ssenkrad dna sedaf thgil nehw, dlob yltsav dna kciuq yrev eb..."</Br>
<Br>Rusty knew this was it, it was now or never because if he gave her the time, she would finish the incantation and the portal may close. "Marcia!" Rusty roared again. "Stop!" but she ignored him, thinking it was to save his life when Rusty was just fine the way he was now. In a fit of rage and pure desperation, Rusty unsheathed his claws and slashed her throat wide open, with blood draining out of her body quickly from the wound. As she was dying, Marcia tried to finish the incantation but couldn't as the words were gurgled from the blood entering her trachea. Rusty held her in his wolven arms as her body went limp and the portal was completely safe. Angry that she gave him no choice, he looked at her cadaver in a new way, in a way that she became his food. Not wanting to feast on her body, but compelled to feed regardless of who this victim was, he plunged his muzzle into her flesh and fed upon Marcia's carcass.</Br>
<Br>When he fed, he felt her flesh give him new life as if her soul was trapped by the death, then entered his body. Within seconds, Rusty saw his body become slightly larger, every muscle bigger and even more defined, with each strand of his fur thicker. When Rusty looked upon Chad, whose muzzle was dripping with blood and his eyes dilated slightly from the euphoria of what he had done, Rusty saw that the same thing that happened to himself happened to Chad. Rusty just cocked his muzzle up, then back down, thinking to himself <i>maybe their deaths weren't for nothing after all!</i> Wanting this new home of his to be devoid of the carnage, not too fond of blood being sprayed everywhere and dead half eaten corpses scattered about, Rusty called upon the energy of the portal and sucked everything Rusty deemed as waste into itself.</Br>
<Br>With everything finalized, Chad and Rusty looked at each other, walked up to the other, standing barreled wolven chest to barreled wolven chest and cleaned the remnants off one another. "So... what now my Alpha?"</Br>
<Br>"I am not sure, but I know that the portal is calling me to enter it."</Br>
<Br>"Is that such a good idea my liege?"</Br>
<Br>"I am not sure Chad, but I know that I have to. Before I became what you see before you, I had a dream where I encountered my human self in an open field somewhere near the mansion. My older self was so because he changed into a werewolf and told me that I would have to kill Marcia and that I would be the protector of the portal."</Br>
<Br>"What happened to the older you in your dream?"</Br>
<Br>"After my older, once transformed self was finished, he disappeared into a portal that opened up and I woke up wondering if I was truly going to become a werewolf or if that was what the portal wanted me to think. Well here I am as a werewolf, I just killed Marcia and fed upon her to ensure that the portal would remain, so I have to just to make sure that the cycle continues or my younger self wont know what is going to happen to himself after a few short hours after waking."</Br>
<Br>"What if you don't return?"</Br>
<Br>"Well... that is what I have you for. You are second in command, so should I not return, you will be the new alpha... the new leader of our brethren."</Br>
<Br>Rusty turned, then waived goodbye just in case, and entered the portal only to reappear in the grassy field in his much more appealing human self. After he transformed in front of the "younger him" and told himself what he needed to, the portal opened up just like before and he disappeared again to leave the younger version of him to wake up and start the cycle again. When Rusty stepped through the portal in the "dream" he came out...</Br></p>
