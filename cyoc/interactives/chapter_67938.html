<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mr. Baxter hurried off to the other metallic table in the room and quickly began stripping off his own clothing.  His thick, rounded torso was coated with dark hairs, sprinkled with greys, from his rounded gut across his drooped pectorals and over his shoulders.  Even his back looked quite hairy.<br />
<br />
His short stature was accentuated by his wide form which even carried the added weight of fat he had accumulated over his mostly sedentary life.<br />
<br />
He reached beneath the slight fold of his waistline and finally lowered his large checkered boxers, revealing an ungroomed mess of thick wiry pubes that nearly concealed a small stubby 4 inch uncut cock.<br />
<br />
Baxter hopped onto his table and soon was raised into place himself, mirroring Travis.<br />
<br />
As Mr. Risk stood at a control panel, typing away both Travis and Baxter's tables turned to face one another, audibly clicking into place.  A warm orange light bathed both of their naked forms.<br />
<br />
Travis felt a sudden vertigo as the room seemed to shift around him.  With a start, he realized it was not the room, but rather his own line of sight that was dropping.  Across from him, Baxter seemed to be elongating.  With a sinking realization, Travis grasped what was to happen.<br />
<br />
Gradually, the height exchange continued and soon Travis had to look upward to see Baxter's pleased expression where before he had a clear view of his shiny scalp.  He was now Baxter's original height of just over 5 feet tall.<br />
<br />
The light shifted in color and intensity, and Travis now felt a warmth covering him.  The warm feeling gave way to an intense itch as dark, wiry hairs began to push out from  the smooth skin of his chest.  Across from him, Baxter's own body hair became lighter and finer as it appeared to draw back into his body.<br />
<br />
The itching sensation spread to his groin, legs, over his shoulders and down his back and his whole body erupted with coarse dark hairs matching the hirsute form that vanished from Baxter, leaving bare, smoothed skin on him.  Even Baxter's stubby, uncircumcised cock almost seemed to push out of the retreating bush of pubes that was now thickly coating Travis' own member.<br />
<br />
With a sudden start, Travis realized that he now felt cool air on the back of his head as a bald spot formed on his scalp, gradually widening to meet a suddenly retreating hairline in front.<br />
<br />
Across from him, Baxter's own head began to show new fine hairs emerging across his bare scalp that gradually thickened along with the fine hair of his former fringe.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Travis was now forming a fringe of his own as the bald spot met and engulfed what was left of his head of hair, the last of his brief widow's peak pulling away to leave a bare, shining dome haloed by thin, fine hairs.<br />
<br />
Finally, Baxter's thick moutstache pulled back into his own lip just as it's counterpart emerged on Travis' own, accompanied by the shadow of thick stubble on his cheeks and chin.<br />
<br />
Once again, the light shifted and Travis now felt a weight fall on him.  Baxter's thick, heavyset form seemed to be pulling into itself just as Travis's own form pushed out wider.Baxter's rounded gut flattened as well, leaving Travis' midsection ballooning outward just as his bones seemed to shift to accommodate a wider frame.  His now stubbly cheeks felt thicker, as did his fingers and hands which felt oddly heavy and awkward.<br />
<br />
Travis felt heavy and bloated now, and a little tired.  Baxter meanwhile exclaimed that he had never felt so great in his life, beaming a winning smile on his now lither face.<br />
<br />
Baxter practically cheered in joy as his small cock suddenly began to push outward, thickening and growing in an instant erection as the head emerged out from a vanishing foreskin that stretched behind over a now impressive shaft that Travis recognized well as formerly his own.  At the same time, his own cock retreated backwards, the glans almost hiding itself inside a forming foreskin in shame, retreating back into the thick forest of pubes.<br />
<br />
Another shift in the light had Travis feeling now spent and exhausted.  His form seemed to droop as Baxter's own skin seemed to tighten across his thin, smoothed body.  The fine lines around his face smoothed out as their mirrors formed on Travis.  Travis' scrotum and testes felt like they sagged and drooped just as he saw Baxter's scrotum lift and tighten just as the rest of him.  The greys left in his head of hair also faded away into vibrant color.  Meanwhile, the fine hair on Travis' temples became salt and pepper, the coarse hairs on his body also sprinkled with grey.  He felt winded, heavy, and... old.</p>
