<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Joe stood up and looked around the room. Everything was huge!!! The ceiling seemed miles away. And the door, which was once small, seemed larger in fact Joe was a few inches below the doorknob. &quot;No way!&quot; Joe said and touched his throat. It was so odd hearing the high pitched voice he sounded exactly like...<br />
<br />
Josh got up and began to look at his new body. &quot;Cool! I&#39;m super strong now!&quot; Josh began to pose showing off Joe&#39;s biceps and six pack. &quot;Why do I have two bumps here?&quot; Josh asked as he touched his pecs. &quot;Those are yours/my pectorals if you try you can...&quot; Joe began to say. However, Josh had already began to bump them just as he had seen Joe do multiple times.<br />
<br />
&quot;Man I didn&#39;t know my wish would come true&quot; Josh said as he began to check out the rest of his body. &quot;Woah this is big!&quot; Josh said and pulled on his newly acquired nine inch dick. &quot;Is this hair?&quot; Josh said pulling oh his new public hair and fondling his balls. &quot;Listen Josh we have to fix this&quot; Joe said. He had already seen his brother&#39;s body and he was not ready for this. He wanted his old developed and much more personal body back!<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re right! I have a project due soon along with my field trip to the aquarium&#39; Josh said. Joe nodded. &quot;There&#39;s no way we can live as each other! I graduate next week! We have to solve this by then&quot; Joe stated. &quot;But we don&#39;t know how it happened?&quot; Josh said clenching his firm round bubble button. &quot;Will you stop that please! We need to solve this now before our family comes home!&quot; Joe said pulling Josh&#39;s hands from his assistant.<br />
<br />
&quot;What about the console?&quot; Josh said. Joe&#39;s face brightened and he rushed to it. &quot;Oh no! It&#39;s fried&quot; Joe said examining it. &quot;Don&#39;t worry! There&#39;s a technology repair store near here. Dad took me when we had to fix the computer&quot; Josh said. &quot;OK let&#39;s etc changed and head there! Once we fix the console we can switch back!&quot; Joe said.<br />
<br />
&quot;OK but what&#39;s that smell?&quot; Josh said and whiffed his armpits. &quot;Gross! I smell like trash!&quot; Josh said.&quot;I had just finished working out when we played I was planning on taking a shower afterward but...&quot; Joe expalined. &quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll go take a quick one&quot; Josh said as he headed out the door and upstairs. &quot;Wait! Just use deodorant...&quot; But Josh had already closed the bathroom door. Joe grumbled as he heard the shower running. &quot;Might as well get changed&quot; He said heading to his younger brother&#39;s room.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile...<br />
<br />
&quot;Man I feel weird&quot; Josh said. He was alone now in the shower and the excitement of being his older brother had begun making him feel weird. &quot;What the-&quot; Josh saw as his pee-pee began to rise. &quot;Huh? Is it growing?&quot; Josh asked aloud. It stopped at 11 inches and Josh began to touch it and felt a strange sense of pleasure vibrate through his body. Since it felt good to touch Josh decided to start moving his hand down and up. This made the pleasure much more prominent. &quot;I don&#39;t know why but this feels so good!&quot; Josh said as he continued to pump his dick until a bunch of white seven came out. Josh felt it and brought it to his face &quot;What did Joe say earlier... cum?&quot; Josh said examining  it.  &quot;Hey are you almost done?!&quot; Joe shouted from outside the door.<br />
<br />
Oh no! Josh had been so preoccupied cumming he forgot about taking a shower so he quickly rinsed his hair (which wasn&#39;t very different due to the similar hair cut they both had) and lathed his body with soap which seemed to be a much more pleasing experience now. Josh turned the shower off and realized he forgot his towel. But it didn&#39;t matter! The only person in the house was Joe and the was his body to begin with.<br />
<br />
Josh opened the door and Joe stood outside waiting and still naked. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you changed yet?&quot; Josh asked. &quot;I had to go really bad! I don&#39;t think I could have held it if I was moving around a lot&quot; Joe said tapping his small foot. &quot;Okay well I&#39;ll go dressed now!&quot; Josh said movie to his brother&#39;s room. &quot;Wait! I can help just let me go first&quot; Joe ran inside and quickly peed with his tiny dick. &quot;Damn! Josh has such a small bladder. I hope I don&#39;t piss my pants later&quot; Joe said as he finished and washed his hands. He ran to his room and saw Josh rummaging through his drawers.<br />
<br />
While Joe was no clean freak his room was in a condition where only he could tell where everything was including his clothes. &quot;Here let me get you...&quot; Joe said as he pulled out some boxers. &quot; In fact...&quot;  Joe grabbed some athletic shorts and a muscle shirt and handed it to Josh. &quot;If you&#39;re going to use my body, you might as well still dress like me&quot; Joe said. &quot;Thanks! Do you need my help for your clothes?&quot; Josh asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nah I know you well enough kiddo&quot; Joe said as he stopped momentararirly reflecting on the word &quot;kiddo&quot;. Did he still have the right to call his brother that? Of course he was still older he was only stuck in the wrong body but it would seem strange for someone else to see a little brother call their older brother kiddo. He would have to refrain from using these types of nicknames until they switched back. Josh paid no attention as he began to change and put on the boxer shorts. <br />
<br />
Joe went to his brothers room and found it to be messier than his own. He walked to the dresser, avoiding the legos and toys on the ground and opened it. &quot;No way!&quot; He said aloud. It was full of superman briefs and other superheroes clothing. &quot;I haven&#39;t wore briefs in years&quot; Joe said as he robbed the superman briefs and placed them on. They were a bit tight &quot;Man are these things small or is Josh growing faster?&quot; Joe said as he put on some shorts and the only plain shirt he could find.<br />
<br />
Josh was waiting in the hall for him. &quot;Ready to go?&quot; He asked. &quot;Yeah let&#39;s just get the console&quot; Joe said running downstairs to retrieve it. But as Josh began to descend the stairs he thought about something. &quot;Did he want to change back?&quot; Here he was in a much older, stronger and bigger body yet he was still being treated as a kid. Shouldn&#39;t be be responsible? After all he was 6&#39; 3&quot; and Joe was now 4&#39;. &quot;I got it&quot; Joe said. He had placed the condsole in a transportable container. It was now or never...did Josh want to change back?</p>
