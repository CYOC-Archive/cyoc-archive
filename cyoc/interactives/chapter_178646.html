<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Your name is Greg and you are a 16 year old high school student. Everything is going normal and well so far in your life. You have a few friends, decent grades, no girlfriend yet, but you were not in any rush. You were generally just an average teenaged boy. That is until this morning when you awoke to find that you no longer were quite yourself anymore.<br />
<br />
Your first hint comes when your vision is blocked by your hair. Normally, this would be very much impossible since you liked to keep it fairly short and above your eyes. The other thing about your hair, is that it normally is not light blue either. This alone woke you up enough to start noticing the rest of your body. <br />
<br />
The next thing you notice is how heavy your chest feels. You already have an idea as to why, but check anyways just to be sure. And sure enough, your once flat male chest has developed into a pair of rather large breasts. In addition, you noticed that you were completely shaven everywhere besides above your nose. Arms, legs, chest, and beard were all completely bare of hair, as if it never even existed there in the first place.<br />
<br />
Since you are still half asleep, your reaction to all of this is still pretty calm. You should normally be panicking a lot more. But the full realization of the impact this will have on you has yet to be comprehend by you. <br />
<br />
You check just to be absolutely sure, and are now positive that you are 100% female, as your fingers were only able to find an unfamiliar opening between your newly feminine legs. Curiosity let you slip a finger deeper inside your new pussy, and the pleasure forced your hand to continue for a while. You no longer felt quite as bad about waking up in a girl&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;If masturbating felt this good with just 1 finger, how would something bigger feel?&quot; This thought has ran across your mind several times in the past 5 minutes, but you lack anything to use. You would have gone for much longer, but, school. You have to go today because you have a test. <br />
<br />
&quot;Greg, you up yet?&quot; Came from outside your door. It is your Mom calling for you. But you are not sure how to answer her. You do not sound at all like you use to, now that your voice was very feminine sounding. You actually really like your new voice&#39;s sound, but it would have been preferable to have another girl have it and not yourself becoming said girl. Since you didn&#39;t answer her, your mom opened the door and walked inside to wake you up.<br />
<br />
Seeing you, your Mom takes a half step back and asks in a concerned tone &quot;Who the fuck are you and where is my son?&quot; You have no odea how you will convince her but not saying anything will only make this much worse. &quot;Mom, its me, I woke up looking like this.&quot; You say, although you unfortunatly said it in a way that made it seem that even you were unconvinced by your own words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Bullshit. My son is not some blue haired elf. Who are you and where is he. I won&#39;t ask you a third time.&quot; Threatened your mom.<br />
<br />
Elf? You move a hand up and find that your ears do infact end in points and are significantly longer. &quot;What the fuck? Why am I an elf girl?&quot; You grumble to yourself. <br />
<br />
&quot;What was that? Speak up!&quot; Demands you mom. <br />
<br />
&quot;As I said, I am your son. Its me, Greg. I have no clue about why or even how, but I just woke up looking like this. Please, you have to believe me!&quot; You start to panic a bit when your Mom begins to approach you, she still looks very pissed off though.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you won&#39;t change your claim? And insist on this utter nonsense of an excuse? Then forgive me if I am wrong, but I don&#39;t believe you. However, on the slim off chance that what you&#39;re saying is the truth, I won&#39;t report you to the authorities, that is reliant on if you can give me a bit of proof to support your ridiculous claim though. You get 1 chance. Just 1, and if you blow it, I am going to hand you over to the police for trespassing and kidnapping my son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lucky for you, you had a pretty good method for this. &quot;Fine, I can do that easy.&quot; You got up and out of your bed, and realized you were very much naked, but that was not important at the moment. You walked over to your one wall where a picture hung. You took down the picture and revealed the wall safe behind it. <br />
<br />
&quot;What in the.... who the hell installed this? When was it installed? Hey, how long have you had a wall safe?&quot; Shouted your Mom.<br />
<br />
&quot;So do you believe me now? And I have had it for about 2 years or so now.&quot; You reply as you enter in the combination and the safe opens up. &quot;Also, I put it in by myself while you and Dad were out on your anniversary trip. See, here are my extra checkbooks, passport, and Social Security card.&quot; You hand her the listed items and she lookes each of them over trying to find any fault in them. While she does this you add on another point. &quot;Also, it only makes sense that I am Greg because why would anyone else install a wall safe in someone else&#39;s room, and fill it with that someone&#39;s items?&quot;<br />
<br />
You mom for some reason has not done anything else besides look at the passport, then to you, then to the check book, then back to the passport again. This cycle repeats a few times before she finally gives up. &quot;Ok. I am willing to buy into your claim a bit more. But I am still not fully convinced, and am also now even more suspicious of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, its a start. But why more suspicious?&quot; You ask confused. If anything these documents and situation should easily prove who you actually are. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look&quot; she hands you the passport and checkbook. &quot;See this, why is this passport made out to a girl named Gwendolyn, yet is identical to my son&#39;s in every other way, including enteries? Also, why do these checks show an address to this house, and yet have Gwendolyn as their owner? These are government documents. The Social Security card has the same numbers as my Son&#39;s and yet it has Gwendolyn as the first name. So this is why I am more suspicious. But... I am willing to believe you, for now at least.&quot; The growing tension in the room dissipated as your mom relaxed quite a bit. &quot;Ok, first things first. You need some clothing, then breakfast, then go to school. I will deal with your admittance somehow. Come with me. Maybe one of my bra&#39;s will fit you for now until I can get you some more properly sized clothes.&quot;</p>
