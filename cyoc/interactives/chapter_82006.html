<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff clicked on the button to edit relationships, watching skeptically for a moment as his cursor flipped into an hourglass, slowly rotating on the screen.  Suddenly, the screen burst alive with boxes and lines, little square boxes with the names of his relatives underneath them, a web work of lines connecting them.  The cursor continued to turn and one by one, pictures began to pop up in the little boxes, beginning with himself and his younger brother and sister, followed by his parents and out from there.  It was a little terrifying, all the pictures were dead on accurate, and in full color, even the older ones, as if someone took a digital camera back in time and snapped pictures of his ancestors.<br />
<br />
He scrolled out, watching the boxes shrink as the tree expanded, distant cousins appearing on the edges and more ancestors generations back appearing.  Each picture popping in as clear as his own.  He eyed the two trees coming from him and his siblings, one for his mother and one for his father.  He could see the certain traits that trickled down through the generations, at least in the faces.  His father's side of the tree was interesting.  His parental grandmother's family all seemed to share a certain look, one his father had clearly not inherited.  In fact his father looked like a near exact duplicate of his paternal grandfather.  His father's father's side all seemed very slight, a bit pale and not all that impressive physically.  Though those genetics seemed to run strong, as looking at him and his younger brother, there was no doubt they took after that side of the family.  Branching away from his grandmother though were some real interesting individuals who would never have guessed he was related to.  Dark and rugged, many of them seemed to have a mediterranean look to them.  His father was never close to his extended family, so it all came as a bit of a shock to him.  There were a lot of Greek sounding last names dwelling on that side of the family.  And odd departure from his own surname of Davis.<br />
<br />
One of those relatives caught his eye, Elias Castellanos.  He scrolled his mouse over the face, which highlighted and enlarged the picture.  A few other details appearing alongside the portrait.  He was only a year younger than his father, but had a full head of black hair as opposed to his father's greying, mousey brown, a well trimmed beard and a rugged face.  Details listed him as unmarried with no children.  Well, he did want to edit relationships, and this cousin seemed like a good place to start for at least a little test.  He clicked on the portrait and dragged it over to his father's portrait.  As soon as he let go a few options popped up, 'Change Relationship', 'Form New Relationship', and 'Swap'.  He clicked on the swap option and the portrait settled down into the square that had belonged to his father, while his father's portrait shot off to the side.  Two generations of the tree started flipping around, with new aunts and uncles taking their place as well as new grandparents.  The Davis part of the tree vanished entirely, as his father was just a distant cousin now.  Another tree slid in it's place, starting with Elias' mother and continuing back in generations, more strongly Greek faces appearing in the tree.<br />
<br />
The boxes containing himself and his siblings suddenly flashed, the borders turning from black to bright gold.  He rolled over his own box, which instead of Jeff Davis was now labeled Jeff Castellanos.  He clicked on his portrait and brought up his details.  A box appeared reading 'Pending alteration of individual due to edited relationships.  Finalize changes to update.'  Jeff frowned slightly, he had been hoping for a preview, but it seemed the program wasn't going to give him one.  He hovered his cursor over finalize, hesitating for a moment.  He shook his head and muttered to himself, &quot;Not like you can't undo it later.&quot;  And with that he clicked finalize.  A little black notch appeared at the top of his portrait and those of his siblings, slowly expanding as the words 'Updating Tree' appeared on the screen.<br />
<br />
At first Jeff didn't feel anything and worried that the tree might only be for show and not work like the main Chronivac version.  Just as the thought crossed his mind he felt a slight twisting in his gut and a pressure building up in all his muscles.  He shot to his feet and stumbled a little as he made his way over to the mirror mounted on his closet door.  He could already see changes coming over his body.  He looked a bit bigger, filling up more of the mirror than he did this morning.  His shoulders seemed to be stretching out right before his eyes, and two inches of bare ankle could be seen below the cuff of his jeans.  His shirt started riding up slightly, exposing a bit of his stomach.  He didn't check the full details of Elias, but he must have been a bigger man than Jeff's father.  From the way his clothes fit he estimated his height somewhere closer to 6'1&quot; than his previous 5'9&quot;.<br />
<br />
The shirt was quickly becoming uncomfortably tight, causing Jeff to pull it over his head and toss it aside.  He blinked in surprise as he saw his exposed torso.  Jeff had always been one of those guys that couldn't put on weight of any kind.  He was scrawny and couldn't build muscle, but on the good side he could eat almost all the junk food he wanted and never really get fat.  A trait he shared with his father.  But it seemed he got a different body type from his new father.  His scrawny form was quickly filling in with muscle.  His flat stomach and unimpressive chest popped with tight, lean muscle.  His chest swelled outwards as a pair of well defined pectorals grew under his skin.  His abdominals appeared in pairs until he could clearly make out six of them.  He ran his hand over his stomach, only then noticing that his hand itself was also larger.  His slender fingers replaced by thicker digits and a wide strong palm.  The veins were clearly visible on the pack of his hand and along his arms, were his larger muscles were pushing them up against the skin.  As he moved his arm, his biceps and triceps bulged outwards with new strength.<br />
<br />
Looking down, his feet had also grown in length and width, slightly dwarfing his previous size eights, looking closer to size thirteens.  His pants were now becoming uncomfortably tight, straining against his swelling calves and thighs.  He quickly undid his fly and let the pants drop down around his ankles.  His legs were as amazingly sculpted as the rest of him.  This was some seriously good genetics he stumbled into.  He felt a weird sensation in his face, like when his hand or foot fell asleep.  He leaned forward to look more closely at himself in the mirror.  Sure enough his facial features were rearranging themselves.  His slender triangular jaw quickly grew into a stronger square shape that he saw in Elias' portrait, almost identical down to the small cleft in the chin.  His cheekbones pushed slightly higher on his face as his brows came down, shading his eyes.  His upturned nose and wide blue eyes, both features he had inherited from his mother remained untouched.  The features that had made him look almost effeminate before turned the rugged features he suddenly had from Elias from rough to almost boy-next-door cute.  If he did say so himself.<br />
<br />
The changes pushed upwards into his hair, his shaggy brown mop turning coal black, and gaining a slight wave.  Instead of hanging about his head in a straight curtain, it seemed more to frame his face than hide it.  He felt another strain around his waist, as the stretchier fabric of his underwear was finally getting to be too much.  He pushed down the tighty-whities, letting his manhood flop out.  His eyes went wide as he saw it.  It seemed Elias was a bigger man all around, as his shaft was a good two inches longer than before, with his balls also being larger and hanging a bit lower.  He wasn't obscenely hung, but his size probably put him comfortably above average without being freakishly large.<br />
<br />
A slight itch signaled the next wave of changes.  His pubic bush slowly spread out from around his shaft, turning from dark brown to pitch black.  The light dusting of pale brown hair on his arms and legs suddenly thickened, its darkening color only serving to enhance the effect.  Hair slowly started creeping up his stomach between his abs, meeting his navel and growing a couple inches up past that.  Dark hair sprouted in the center of his previously hairless chest, a bit more growing in around his nipples.  His new chest hair spread out slightly, the three patches coming close to meeting, but not quite making it yet.  He could guess his chest would be well covered with darker hair when he was older.  His mostly beardless face suddenly sprung forth with dark hair.  His peach fuzz turning into a slight beard with impressive speed.  A light amount of dark stubble appeared along his jaw, more growing in on his upper lip.  The stubble was a bit more filled out on his chin and along his sideburns.  For the first time in his life, the though of growing out some real facial hair crossed his mind.  Though as his thoughts wandered, the slight darkening of his skin snapped him back to reality.  His pale complexion slowly giving way to a rich olive tan.<br />
<br />
He lifted his arms over his head, stretching out, watching his muscles shift underneath his skin as he did so.  His eyes turned back to the computer, noting that the three boxes were about seventy five percent back to black, only one side still remaining gold.  The window reading updating suddenly shifted to 'Altering Reality'.  Jeff suddenly felt dizzy as the room seemed to twist about him.  Things all over his room started changing, pictures with his old face were suddenly replaced with his new one.  Looking at the one family photo he kept, only his mother's face remained completely unchanged.  His sister was still recognizable, as she mainly took after their mother.  But the changes to his younger brother were as drastic as his own.  His father was gone, replaced by Elias.  A set of weights appeared in one corner of the room, and several other pieces of sports equipment suddenly popped into existence.  Oddly enough, many of his older things remained, like his video games and his collection of sci-fi novels and movies.  He looked at the new sports equipment, staring at it with bewilderment, then suddenly shuddered as sports knowledge worked its way into his brain, as well as memories of playing all throughout his life, oddly mixed in with some of his geekier knowledge like computers.  A brainy-jock.  He guessed he could live with that life, and was glad the program didn't entirely rewrite his brain.<br />
<br />
Everything seemed to settle back into place, as the computer let out a small chime, as 'Updating' changed to 'Complete'.  He jumped at a slight knock on his door, grabbing his pants and hiking them back up to his waist.  He barely registered the fact the briefs he had been wearing were now a pair of boxers.  Or that the previously tight jeans now fit him perfectly.  He let out a &quot;Yeah?&quot;  Shocking himself for a second with the slightly deeper timbre of his voice.<br />
<br />
A baritone voice responded.  At once completely strange, but comfortably familiar to the newer memories in his head.  That was Elias, his new father.  &quot;Dinner in 10.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Be right down, dad.&quot;  He heard a grunting response from the other side of the door, knowing his father expected him to be right down as he said.  But.. family dinner, his family had never done that.  But even as he thought that, his newer memories interjected that they always did that. The two conflicting memories would take time to get used to.  He grabbed his shirt of the bed where he tossed it, the former baggy black t-shirt now a form hugging black muscle t, and pulled it over his head.<br />
<br />
He looked at the door to his room, then back over to his computer...</p>
