<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You end up going to sleep for the night. Next morning, when you wake up, you attempt to stretch your arms but quickly discover nothing happens. You try to rub the sleep from your eyes. Again. Nothing. You slowly blink your eyes open and find yourself staring through a glass wall. You try moving your body again one more time and realize you&#39;re just a head stuck in a glass case with no body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, shit,&quot; you moan. <br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; said Marcy. &quot;How was your first night as a bodiless head?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Talking? There isn&#39;t supposed to be any talking,&quot; said someone with your voice from the doorway. <br />
<br />
In stepped.....you! The man who stole your body now has your face! Along with him, was a rather large jackass. Fat, tall, and kinda sloppy. The stench coming from the animal almost immediately assaults your nose.<br />
<br />
The man with your body walked over to your case, peering in at you and frowned.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hhhmmm...this will never do,&quot; he said. &quot;I caught you talking, which is against the rules. But I have the perfect punishment to make it so you can never talk again, as silent spells are only temporary.&quot;<br />
<br />
You just sit helplessly as you watch the sales man turn towards his donkey, and....detach its head from its body. The donkey head started braying uncontrollaby, as it&#39;s headless body stopped moving and just stood there on all fours. It&#39;s big huge black male penis dangling down between its two hind quarters. <br />
<br />
The salesman puts the donkeys head in a glass case, and set it on the shelf next to you. You could hear it braying. He then grabbed your case, opened its lid, and pulled you out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow! Hey! Stop! That hurts!&quot; You protest, as your cheeks are squished in by his, or rather your, hands and roughly pulled out.<br />
<br />
He spins your head around as he holds you between your own former palms of your warm hands so you can take a good look at the donkey&#39;s body just standing there patiently. The thick black penis opens up a torrent of acrid yellow piss, and a few donkey turds begin to plop out of its rear-end. <br />
<br />
&quot;This will surely make you shut up so you can never speak again,&quot; he said, as he brought your head closer to the donkey&#39;s body. &quot;He isn&#39;t the healthiest specimen, just so you know. And it currently has a big old sore hernia that&#39;s about ready to rupture,&quot; he noted as the first turds dropping out had a little bit of blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uuuhhhh....wait a second...&quot; you begin to protest as he lifts your head up towards its long thick gray-furred neck. &quot;Wait a second! A donkey!? You cant-!&quot;<br />
<br />
He plops your head on the end of its neck, smooths your skin along the top of its neck, and suddenly, you can feel a body below your head again....you can feel you are pissing, as a final turd leaves your new body. You begin to feel an itching throbbed pain coming from the anus, just as the last turd drops down below between your new rear hooves.<br />
<br />
&quot;-Haaaaw heee haaaww!!&quot; You finish, trying to say &quot;-do this to me!&quot; <br />
<br />
You do feel a body now for the first time in an entire day, but it feels completely dfferent. Uncomfortable. For one, you&#39;re on all fours and it feels natural but unnatural to be in this position at the same time. For another, you don&#39;t feel any fingers or toes at the ends of your....<br />
<br />
.....you look around and down.....legs...<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhhaawww,&quot; is all you can say, as you crane the long donkey neck your head is attached to and look back along the fat-sided barrel-shaped flank of the ass you were previously looking at from a completely different angle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaw hhheee hhhaaww!&quot; You try to protest, apparently unable to utter a word. <br />
<br />
You just stand there stupidly huffing and stamping the donkey&#39;s front hooves you are now stuck with. With each stamp of a hoof, it makes a loud clop sound.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, I love to see human faces on bodies of creatures. It never gets old. Here, come with me to the back room with mirrors so you can drink it all up.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man suddenly threw a collar around your neck with leads attached to it. With a simple tug, you find your body obediently following him.<br />
<br />
&quot;As long as you wear this collar with these black leather leads attached to them, you will obey every command of whatever human is holding them. Come along now so you can see your face attached to your new body I&#39;ve given you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaawww-!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shush!&quot; the man said with a tug. You find yourself going quiet, not able to express your growing discomfort with your present situation. You grimace the entire way, as you felt the legs moving. The muscles contracting, but you are unable to stop it.<br />
<br />
With another tug and the command &quot;Come!&quot; you continue following him to a back room as promised. The room had large long mirrors on opposing walls. First thing you see is your own face as you first enter the room. Followed by the body of the large ass you were previously staring at. That body is now attached to your head, and you begin to mentally feel both helpless, and utterly humiliated at &quot;wearing&quot; this ridiculous body. <br />
<br />
&quot;So. What do you think?&quot; He asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhhaaww hheee hhhaaww hhhee hhhaaaw!&quot; You blurt out almost uncontrollably. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haha, right. Despite having a human head and face, you cannot speak, as you are now attached to a body that contains the vocalizations of a donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; the man continued. &quot;I&#39;ll just tie you to the bannister on the far wall over here so you can drink in your new appearance. You will not be able to do anything but stand there as long as your leads are tied to something like poles and railings. You&#39;ll just stand there like a good donkey.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anyway,&quot; he continued speaking as he led you over to the handrail on one of the walls and securely tied your lead to it, &quot;I need to make the help clean up the mess your new body created out on the floor of the shop. I&#39;ll be along at the end of the day to collect you.  Enjoy. And try not to get too bored. Haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
The man left. You tried moving violently, but all you found you&#39;re able to do, is to fidget a little bit. Stomp a hoof here and there and once in a while let a bray escape. You try to ignore the animal stench wafting up from below and offending your human olfactory sense. That stench, you realize, is the stench of a barnyard animal that isn&#39;t your own, but you now will own. You avoid looking at yourself in the mirror for a while, as you attempt to do something other than stamp a front hoof on the floor once in a while. <br />
<br />
You can feel the butthole throbbing and itching way back there. You want nothing more than to reach back and touch it. But without hands, it&#39;s impossible. All you can do, is slightly squeeze your rump a little bit, and kick one if your hoof-clad rear legs up. You try to ignore the discomfort and the condition you found yourself in. Eventually, as the boredom sets in, you do begin to do explore &quot;your&quot; body. <br />
<br />
Looking closely into the mirror in front of you, your face is still the same. But it&#39;s attached to the long broad neck of a donkey. You can clearly see the reflection of the reflection of the mirror behind you. Extending behind that neck your intact head is attached to, is the loaf-shaped ass end of a donkey, a jackass to be exact. A well-endowed one at that! The body ending in a tail you can feel moving around mostly of its own accord. The sides are fat, sticking out like spare tires, as is the rump.<br />
<br />
For a while,, you try and avoid looking directly at the penis you can obviously feel hanging below, and the balls wobbling around just below the anus. But you can&#39;t help yourself. You give in, and look down there through the mirrored reflections on both wall. You gape at the black monster cock hanging down between the donkey&#39;s legs. A cock that isn&#39;t supposed to be yours, but you can feel nonetheless less! It is beginning to get droopy and the balls sagging, as this jackass was well into its middle ages.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, GROSS!&quot; You think. You can smell the barnyard smell wafting from this body. A smell that was acquired by a regular old middle-aged dumb donkey before your head was attached to it. <br />
<br />
You begin to feel queasy. Luckily for you, the esophageal muscle inside the donkey you now inhabit is too strong to allow you to vomit. Imagine, if you regurgitated through your human mouth whatever the donkey chewed on and swallowed that morning before you took possession of its body. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haawww!&quot; You bray, as you stomp your right front hoof with a loud &quot;click-thud&quot; on the hard wooden floor in irritation. You try not to look at the body you are now stuck with. This is not only disgusting, it is also humiliating as you can&#39;t help to look at yourself in the mirror any longer. It us beyond disgusting, what you&#39;ve inherited. You&#39;d rather just be a head stuck in a glass case.<br />
<br />
You can&#39;t help to look again at your humiliating situation. It&#39;s the tail. And the humongous smelly black weiner that are the most humiliating. Limited with four legs and just hooves was more irritating than humiliating. Although, stick on all fours like a common animal was its own humiliation. The fingerless limbs made you feel mentally &quot;cramped.&quot; No fingers or toes to wiggle around. Legs with limited motion, instead of arms. All you can do is stomp your hooves with a heavy clicking thud. <br />
<br />
&quot;Haaaawww, heeee hhaaaww &quot; even your speech is gone! Even just as a head in a box, you were somehow able to still speak....<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury in the humiliation department, you felt your ears begin growing! You looked at your face in the mirror, and it seems your head had grown a bit at the base of your jaw just behind your ears, to more seamlessly meld with your donkey&#39;s neck. You see the tips of your ears have sharpened and began pushing upwards as they started to cover with gray and white fur. <br />
<br />
Up, up, up, your ears grew. Wider and wider. Your ears grew far above the top of your head. You wanted to reach up and feel them as you were stuck on all fours staring at them in consternation. They remained on the sides of your head, rather than shifting to the top of your head like a donkeys ears. But they were so tall, that they reached nearly a foot above the top of your head. An utterly ridiculous crown, marking you for life. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the mane on your neck started growing towards your head as your hair turned black on top, stood up, and shorted and turned into gray fur on the sides. You can somehow feel that your head had completely finished melding with this horrible body. You somehow knew this was it. You were now stuck like this. A life stuck on all fours.</p>
