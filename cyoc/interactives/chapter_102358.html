<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Sammy and Jessy found a happy looking bus stop, with pictures of Micky Mouse, a space shuttle, Free Willy, palm trees, and a set of keys drawn on it. There was also a picture of George Washington. There was a mix of nonsense numbers and emoticas next to each one that the raccoon and fox babies read without trouble. <br />
<br />
Also, the bus stop had a roof and walls that double as a great jungle gym. And playing on it right now was an armadillo baby fur with a pink diaper. <br />
<br />
On the bench was a pin backpack with lots of smilie face stickers on it. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi! I&#39;m Sammy The Fox!&quot; &quot;And I&#39;m Jessy The Raccoon!&quot; They both greeted without hesitation. <br />
<br />
&quot;My name is Amy! Amy the Armadillo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy didn&#39;t even THINK about really asking her what her surname had been before she was a baby fur, in spite of his now toddler world view, Sammy&#39;s brain felt wired that Sammy could know a hundred armadillos all named Amy and they&#39;d all still be unique individuals to him that he&#39;d somehow instantly know WHICH Amy The Armadillo was being talked about it, it was so natural that Sammy didn&#39;t even question it, it was just... so natural.  <br />
<br />
Amy kept climbing up and down the jungle gym that doubled at the boss stop, being as angle as a spider monkey rather than armadillo. &quot;Sooo! Where are you headed?&quot; She smiled at them upside down. <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re going to go see the First Fur!&quot; Sammy said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm.&quot; Amy blinked, then still upside down looked closer at Sammy The Fox, then grinned. &quot;Cool! ... you&#39;re one of those, I can see it in yer eyes.&quot;<br />
<br />
She never once stopped her gymnastics routine for an audience of two on the monkey bars as she spoke, sometimes even speaking side ways as she constantly moved about. <br />
<br />
&quot;Like one of what?&quot; Sammy asked. All Baby furs were Baby Furs, there WERE NO &#39;those&#39;, the very idea felt scan-dell-licious. <br />
<br />
Amy smile and nodded and said politely. &quot;You&#39;re like me. Did you really think you were the only one? Maybe it&#39;s because you&#39;ve never seen a Not-Friend in person yet, but trust me, if you saw a Not-Friend, you&#39;d want to make friends, on the spot, it&#39;s our nature. Oh I mean outside one of those cool space suits they wear whenever one wants to visit!<br />
<br />
&quot;But really, you want to go meet the First Fur, just like I did. And meet Cheetah, Bunny, and Horsey, those were the first friends she made by the way, and yeah, those the names they go by now. Sorta a badge of honor, or cause they were first baby fur born who were those animals, or like how some when they join a new faith change their names, who knows? But yeah, meet her, and find out way to make us all Not-Friends again. Or find a way to make all the Baby Furs just live in one spot away from the Not-Friends safe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I want a way so Not-Friends can become friends, without becoming friends.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OH!&quot; She grinned. &quot;That&#39;s what I wanted too! I&#39;ll admit that&#39;s a rare one. You ARE like me!&quot; She flipped onto the ground, then hugged Sammy, then flipped back onto the bars without missing a beat. Jessy didn&#39;t felt a flicker of jealous or alarm, after all, there was no rule that said you couldn&#39;t have more than one bestest friend.   <br />
<br />
&quot;I traveled all the way to her big sand castle, and meet her... and I found out the truth.&quot; Amy shuddered in a very un-baby-fur way. &quot;I made a promise not to tell... but if the lab-coat kids figure it out, they&#39;re free to tell everyfur I was told! ... But maybe they shouldn&#39;t... it might darken the reason we REALLY exist. And why it&#39;s important that everyone in the world becomes friends. The Not-Friends would never believe it. They won&#39;t believe it. They can&#39;t believe it. Cheetah, Bunny, and Horsie said they TRIED.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy&#39;s eyes widened in awe. Amy was like him? But she met the Baby Fur and found something out? &quot;What do you mean?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;... Us becoming baby furs... wasn&#39;t an accident... and it wasn&#39;t because some lonely Not-Friend wanted everybody to be friends, or because some greedy Not-Friend wanted to rule the world, or some silly Not-Friend wanted to clean up all the litter and dirty water in the world. It&#39;s a lot lot bigger than that. SUPER DUPER BIGGER!&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I... I still want to meet her.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;OF COURSE you do! You wouldn&#39;t come all this way if anything I could say would stop you! You HAVE come a long way right? Really? THAT FAR? Cool! Maybe I should visit Frankie Town! I can invite my grandpa!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I.. I just want Not-Friends to make the choice con-shelf-lee to be friends.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;I did too. Not she didn&#39;t wave a magic wand and make me agree with her, shame on you for thinking that. But I realized somethin&#39;! Why aren&#39;t Not-Friends fleeing the cities? Or blowing up bridges? Can&#39;t change what&#39;s blown to pieces. Or laying down big walls in our way? Or writing shameful words from mommies and dropping leaflets on us? Not-Friends are foolish, not stupid. They already figured out that suit to deliver the latest movies after all. Even if it really makes no sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
She stuck out her arms straight out in front of her and kicked her legs with her knees locked. &quot;The zombies have come!&quot; She then did a cartwheel. &quot;But the &#39;make yourself go asleep and never wake up&#39; around the world have been going DOWN, and even normal &#39;go to sleep and never wake up&#39; have begun to go down. when with the panic and fear from the end of the world, it should be the opposite. Even if it&#39;s all the Not-Friends being sort-of-friends by have a really big &#39;not our friend&#39; to think about, it doesn&#39;t make much sense.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you know all that?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh that&#39;s easy!&quot; Amy said, and she pulled out of her backpack a plastic fisherprice like toy that looked vaguely like a lab top. But when she randomly pushed some of the toy buttons (resulting in rings, and squeaks, etc), a news site run by the Not-Friends popped up. <br />
<br />
&quot;Not-Friends screamed and panicked when the First Fur appeared... now... there&#39;s gotta be at least a hundred million of us at this point,&quot; She did the jingle from the Flintstone kids vitamin commercial, &quot;and growing. Our magic is effecting things already just by us EXISTING, heck, once there gets to be billions of us, maybe Not-Friends will start turnin&#39; into friends on their own.&quot; <br />
<br />
This was news for Sammy... at least it meant he didn&#39;t have to worry as much as poor Not-Friends doing something foolish to themselves as they got more scared. <br />
<br />
&quot;So... you really promised not to tell?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I know the answer... I was told... but it would make your quest kinda pointless if I told you... but I will give you a hint. Trust me, it&#39;s not just some vague thing that you can use for anything later. I&#39;d be reading a fortune cookie if that was the case. Our universe is a barrier. And we&#39;re all links in the chain. That&#39;s all I can say. Sorry I can&#39;t tell you more. I promise if you get to the first fur, she can give you answers.&quot; <br />
<br />
A bus, driven by a cute little walrus boy in a purple diaper drove up headed &#39;up on the map.&#39; <br />
<br />
&quot;This is my bus!&quot; Amy said hopping on. <br />
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Sammy asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wanna see Washington!&quot; She smiled.<br />
<br />
Sammy smiled back, that sounded cool. &quot;Please take a picture of you with Mr. Linchon&#39;s statue for me okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Amy waved and nodded as the bush closed and drove off. <br />
<br />
Immediately after, a bush going in the opposite direction arrived. &quot;Hiii!&quot; Said the lamb driving the bus. &quot;Hop on board!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sammy and Jessy held each other&#39;s hands and skipped on board.</p>
