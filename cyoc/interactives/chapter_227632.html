<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shizen’s visit to one of the Kitsune lands far from the capital was as discrete as possible, one of her most trusted advisers, Lady Yomiko, would be escorted by soldiers and wear a veil, this would guarantee any suspicious eyes would be on her not the Kitsune Empress. Meanwhile Shizen herself wore plain blue kimono with a cloth wrap and straw sandals, she concealed five of her tails to help hide her identity.<br />
She moved through the town, nobody noticing her, they simply saw an average vixen. She made her way to the tunnels beneath the town that used to be a mine but now serves as a light district. Here she would find a small inn, a disreputable place but perfect for discreet meetings. <br />
Shizen went to the last room on the second floor that was hugging the cave ceiling. Inside she used her foxfire to light a candle, it illuminated the room and revealed a cloaked figure in an ornate mask.<br />
<br />
“Shachou.” She said plainly.<br />
<br />
“To what do I owe the pleasure your grace? It’s not everyday you invite me into your lands.” The boss said feigning a bow.<br />
<br />
“I think you know why I summoned you.” Shizen said.<br />
<br />
“Nobody “summons” me. We both know why I’m here so just say it.” The Boss said.<br />
<br />
“Ayasa-Chan, you were supposed to kill her entire clan, yet she still lives.” Shizen barked.<br />
<br />
“If you want me to talk then lose the fur, I can’t stand to speak to you like this.” He said and sat back confident.<br />
<br />
Shizen tempered her rage at his disrespect but did as she was bid, her fur was replaced with pale flesh and long, straight white hair. Her vulpine appearance gave way to a beautiful Japanese woman. She sat across from him and waited for his response to her earlier question, hating that she had to appear in her human form for this man.<br />
<br />
“Much better, as to your question. I held my part of the bargain: I had one of my best agents make young Hinata disappear—“ he was cut off by the woman.<br />
<br />
“—by disappear you mean made into your attack dog? My son is already questioning my husband. Your recklessness has put everything into jeopardy!” Shizen shouted.<br />
<br />
“I handled it so you didn’t have to sully your own hands and could keep your foolish sense of honor.” He said.<br />
<br />
The Boss’s eyes gave her a stare that made her reconsider her tone. She could easily kill him but knew he would not remain dead for every long, she couldn’t risk him going to anyone about their arrangement. Then vines wrapped around Shizen and tightened around her neck with supernaturally sharp thorns threatening to pierce her skin. She realized that the only individuals capable of threatening her was another goddess.<br />
<br />
Then a woman stepped out of the shadows, she was blonde wearing a proper, dark green skirt suit. Shizen knew this woman had to be a goddess of some kind, she only found out who it was when the Boss spoke to her.<br />
<br />
“Easy Demeter, if Mister Fox sees a mark on his precious wife he won’t stop till you’re dead, which is fine by me but would be inconvenient for my plans.” The masked man spoke.<br />
<br />
“Yes Boss, but do not worry, I’ve had some experience with wrathful goddesses. These thorns will hurt but they won’t leave a mark.” The blonde woman explained.<br />
<br />
“I suggest you watch your tone, if it wasn’t for me your entire family would be dead and you along with them. You can’t lay a hand on me, if I die I’ll just come back, but you…should we find out if a celestial kitsune can be killed?” The Boss said callously, motioning for Demeter.<br />
<br />
The vines grew tighter and a potent neurotoxin dripped from the thorns.<br />
<br />
“Y-you would kill your own grandmother?!” The Kitsune Empress asked.<br />
<br />
“Silence! You may have fucked my grandfather but you’re nothing to me! If you bring that up ever again I’ll have to tell your husband, I don’t think he’d like that his wife fucked the grandfather of his people’s greatest enemy!” The Boss growled.<br />
<br />
Shizen looked to him, she didn’t have time to fight him, she couldn’t fight her own kin.<br />
While she loved her husband Tatsu, she never anticipated falling in love with a human, the Boss’s grandfather: Francis. This was years before her and Francis’ son began his vendetta against  the supernatural. She was in the human realm and was on the brink of death by the hands of Gerold and Warren Kane, he chanced upon her when she fell on his car. Bloody and pursued by two psychopaths, Francis didn’t hesitate to safe the kitsune, even at the risk of his own life. Shizen was temporarily unable to return to the kitsune realm so from there they fled and fought their way through the southern United States, eventually managing to kill the two hunters and go their separate ways. Shizen kept their affair a secret and vowed never to return to Francis again. <br />
Nine months later she returned, bearing their son, Ian. She explained to her human lover that the child could not remain with her, the bastard child would be in danger all his life and so she had no choice but to leave their son with Francis. So Shizen left her illegitimate child and returned home to Tatsu. Eventually Ian would have a son of his own but kitsune assassins would find them and kill them all. However Ian’s son could not die and returned to the living, orphaned and alone, until being found and raised by the Goddess Demeter.<br />
Years later Shizen would learn of the Boss’s deathlessness and knew it could only be her grandson, she covertly reached out but he had no love or desire to meet her. Until she came to him with a proposition, she would provide a means of time travel and he would get rid of the Ayasa clan and stop the rebellion.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Shizen’s foxfire flared up and consumed the vicious plants. Shizen knew he knew that he was at the advantage here, she could fight Demeter but that would draw far too much attention. Instead she extinguished her fire, the  Boss nodded to Demeter and the fog disappeared.<br />
<br />
“I called you here to finish what you started, kill Ayasa-Chan. If others discover her survival they will support her claim to my empire.” Shizen stated.<br />
<br />
“You’re not in the position to make demands of me anymore, in fact I have some orders for you, and some news you might find a tad disconcerting: I have Villar’s soul gem. You will not tell any one of course, but I just wanted you to know how fucked you actually are. As for my orders: you are to bring me the soul drive known as “Steph”. If you refuse or fail to do so, I will have Hinata Ayasa return to your realm and order her to reignite the rebellion, I’m sure many clans will support her claim. Not to mention the full support of the Normal.” The Boss explained.<br />
<br />
Shizen didn’t know what to say, what to do. She couldn’t let this man walk all over her, and she couldn’t allow her secret to be exposed. Solemnly she gave a weak nod and just like that the two were gone. Shizen had to figure out what to do, there was little time to act.</p>
