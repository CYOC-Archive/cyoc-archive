<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Richard walked toward Circe's House of Sexual Delights. He was feeling very down, a Coachman's job he loved. To be above those six or eight sorry bunch of asses, he could crack his wip and make them work. He came to the Park as a mild mannored young man, but seeing the treatment of people turned animals his attitude hardened.
<br />

<br />
Now for the past year he had rarely gone home. Staying at the Grand Hotel in the park he was near work and could kick ass any time it felt good.
<br />

<br />
Richard had lost favor of the Master Coachman and was shut in his RINKY DINKY reformation machine. The change which was not permanant would be reversed if he made it thru thirty days of no sex. Possible when human but he now looked and felt as a male satyr. His sexual equipment was five times the size of his human equipment. Plus that her now was 75% covered in goat's wool and walked about naked.
<br />

<br />
Every step he took reminded him of his most sensual and sexual self. A furry sheath would jiggle, and hardy goat cock inside would shake. Cloven hooves and goat legs gave new senses as did a tail. Most of his hide was covered in a curly thick dark brown wool. The Fall breeze tickled his hairs and gave shudders of delight.  The delight funneled into a touchy thrill and his goat cock would rise to the occasion.
<br />

<br />
The Park was not yet opened for the day as he walked ever so slowly to what he expected to be a harsh time not being able to enjoy his sexual self.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Piissst, hey over here, called Phil to the passing satyr.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Richard looked at Phil knowing he was the last escaped volunteer. He suddenly thought that Phil did not know him to have been a Coachman, since now he was a satyr.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, I can see your not to happy to be in the Park either, said Phil.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Richard just nodded his head and didn't say a word.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I want to get out of here, this place is one Hell of a Park. I'm sure you weren't born that was and would just as well get the Hell out of here, aske Phil?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come I have a place where the Coachman will never come looking for you, come waved Richard.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Soon they stood at the isle of Circe's House of Sexual Delights. Phil looked at the sign on the gate post and then at the satyr. &quot;You work in here?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes, I can find many places for you to hide in here, stay with me and nobody will ask any questions, said Richard with a little sly in his voice.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Phil followed him inside and was astounded at the plush interior of the house. &quot;Come this way Sir, said Richard aloud!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Richard walked down the marble floor and steps to a lower and danker hallway. The marble quit and rough cut stone lined the walls. The bright lights from the entrance became lit tourches alone the dark halls.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Good morning Grille&quot; how are we doing today said Richard as they turned a corner and stood before a large wooden door.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Richard, I'd heard you were sent over here but I thought your position was upstairs, said a voice from within.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Grille, I have a favor to ask, could you keep this fellow next to me safe from the Park managerment.  Seems they would have him as a plain ass if they could, all the Coachman are looking for him, said Richard.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sure we can take good care of him, nobody would ever expect to find him down here, said the voice. Come in my good Sir, come in!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The door opened and Phil took a step half in, &quot;hey I never told you that those Coachman were looking for me how did you know?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Richard gave a well muscled push to Phil's back and quickly slammed the door. &quot;Grille, I meant what I said, please don't let anyone find him or I'll be a satyr for life. You know what's best for him and I'm sure he soon won't be much of a bother, thanks!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Phil stood on the otherside of the door looking thru the steel barred window.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come Sir I have some work to do before your identity is covered and you trail leads to nowhere a Coachman would want to look, come!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Phil walked into the blackness of the room and felt cold damp rock all around him.
<br />

<br />
Feeling his way and listening to the odd shuffle of Grille he moved cautiously along the hall.  A flicker of light ahead gave new calm to a scared human. Phil stopped cold as he saw a large bulky figure walk into the light and round a corner.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Grille, Grille, what is this place you are hidding me in......OH SHIT!&quot;
<br />

<br />
As Phil turned the corner both the light and smell hit him in the face. There standing in front of a thick gate was a creature mostly hog and some man.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come Sir, come be not afraid I don't eat people!  I am Grille the sailor who was one of many sailor's that visited Circe's evil isle. I saw my friends changed into swine and shut in sties, fed berries and nuts and left to wallow in the mud. Three days and ttwo glorious nights in what they thought was Hell and I just plain loved. The Captain blackmailed Circe into changing the crew back. However when it came my turn for her to smear the potion on I ran deeper into the sty.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Phil looked wide eyed and quiet.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes dear Sir I was much more content to remain a hog than sail thru horrid seas with those fools. Much better to live an easy life, eating my fill and mounting dozens of horny sows. S O W S...... Yes there was passion in it's true raw form. I knew some of them were originally sailors of captives that Circe made to be swine. Ya know you can't have a good farm with just boars!  So some on the men and I figure captive women became sows!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Come dear Sir, I have a place in here where Coachman and Management never think to look!&quot;</p>
