<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Nate’s perspective:<br />
<br />
“Huh, what happened,” said Nate aloud. It took him as long as it had taken his father to get his bearings and realize that he was back in his body.<br />
<br />
“So the old man rigged it up to be able to swap remotely without the pods. It looks like the participants have to have used the pods in the past though,” said Nate, inspecting his dad’s work.<br />
<br />
Nate tried to think what he could accomplish with this machine in front of him. He could switchback into his body, but then his father would be at the control station and they’d just keep switching back and forth on a loop. Ah, he’d figured out how to get back at his dad.<br />
<br />
Using the sexuality option, Nate remotely changed sexual identities with his father. He quickly realized by fantasizing that he was still attracted to men, but now also attracted to women, “So dad was bisexual? That explains why he was so hung up on me getting some male on male action, because he was jealous. Probably didn’t even realize he was bi. He’s sure as hell gonna realize that he’s only attracted to one gender now.”<br />
<br />
Just then, Tom’s business partner rang the doorbell upstairs. Nate went to investigate who it was.<br />
<br />
“Hey, Mitch, come on in. You wanna test my dad’s health machine? It’s supposed to make you feel 30 years younger,” Nate said to the nearly fifty business man.<br />
<br />
Mitch was good natured, quite fit for his age but still with a good bit of body fat. His hair had gone white but he still had a good head of it and his beard was white and trimmed pretty short. He looked like a slightly more clean cut version of Santa Claus.<br />
<br />
“Well that sounds intriguing. I could use a pick-me-up and your dad’s inventions are top notch. Show the way,” said Mitch.<br />
<br />
On the way to the basement, Mitch explained that he had come over to discuss a business deal with Tom, and Nate explained that Tom wasn’t home at the moment.<br />
<br />
Nate ushered Mitch into one of the pods, setting it up for a consciousness swap with himself. He climbed in another pod (despite it not being fully necessary) and the process began and ended quickly.<br />
<br />
After a couple minutes, when the vertigo of being in a new body ended, the two men climbed out of the pods.<br />
<br />
Mitch caught sight of the full length mirror in the lab, “Oh my god, is that me?? I’m you!” He started to grope his 18 year-old body, “Sorry to explore your body like this, it’s just...well it’s just my body now!”<br />
<br />
“No need to apologize,” said Nate, looking at the readings on the screen. It seems that Mitch’s sexuality is gay. Something Tom and Nate never knew about Tom’s business partner.  Nate remotely swapped his new bisexuality for Mitch’s homosexuality. It just felt right to be gay again.<br />
<br />
Tom’s pov:<br />
<br />
He couldn’t believe it, the lanky 16 year old neighbor boy had just cum in his ass, and worse, had gotten him off as well. He had to get back to the lab to give Nate a piece of his mind.<br />
<br />
He kept getting love pecks on the lips from Derrick. He was worried that if he stopped, the boy would be mad at tell someone that his adult neighbor had slept with him. But also these awkward little kisses were nice? And they left little butterflies in Tom’s stomach? He’d have to sort out those feeling later, but for now, “Hey, so I have to get back to my son, you understand, right? Maybe we could keep what happened here between us?”<br />
<br />
“Uh yeah sure,” said Derrick, pulling out of Tom. Tom moaned a bit from Derrick’s relatively small hard-on exiting him. Derrick seemed a bit sad. Probably wanted to cuddle with Tom after losing his virginity to him. But it hadn’t been Tom’s choice! If he had built a time machine, he could go back and not be Derrick’s first.<br />
<br />
Tom used the master bathroom quick to expel Derrick’s seed and take a quick shower. He threw on the clothes that Nate had dress his body in before, but when it got to the underwear, he realized that his slut of a son hadn’t worn any.<br />
<br />
“Will I see you again?” Asked Derrick with the puppy dog eyes.<br />
<br />
“Of course, though maybe we shouldn’t have sex again. It was really good, but I shouldn’t be having sex with someone so young. I don’t know what I was thinking,” said Tom, trying to excuse the action which he had not taken.<br />
<br />
Derrick rushed in for a kiss, trying to make Tom remember what a good time they had so that Tom might change his mind. Tom couldn’t turn the boy down. He knew how much a first sexual experience can impact someone’s confidence, and didn’t want this to scar Derrick. Or was that just what he was telling himself, and maybe he actually wanted the kiss? Either way, he gave Derrick a good hot little make out and said goodbye.<br />
<br />
On his short walk home, there was a young couple in their early thirties out jogging. Tom tried to look at the wife, her boobs bouncing, her flowing hair, and was surprised to feel absolutely nothing. His eyes felt magnetically drawn to the husband jogger with his meat sword swinging left to right as he strode. He had short golden hair and dreamy eyes and despite being in the middle of exercise, a big beautiful smile on his handsome face. Tom smiled back at the man, receiving a dirty look from the wife. <br />
<br />
“Wait, did she think I was checking her husband out? Wait, was I checking her husband out?” He pondered. He looked back and now watched the blonde man’s shapely ass bounce with each bound, hypnotized. He was so distracted that he walked a little past his own house and doubled back.</p>
