<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hina had been sitting far away from any of the members of the Harris family with Kiko to her right. She knew it would be very awkward to come up to any of them at this time. Although a few times she did look over at Aaron to see how happy he was as he was sitting with his gilfriend and they were having a good time. Kiko was the one who helped her dress up in the black and blue kimono with the long black haori she wore. She also had helped tie her hair up in the bun. As she and Kiko ate, they then noticed Aaron’s mothers get furious at a kitsune woman who then went to lady Shizen to complain, only to have Shizen politely yet frighteningly toss the woman out as everyone cheered. Kiko and Hina respectfully clapped as well.<br />
<br />
“I suppose that’s a good lesson in treating lady Shizen’s grandchildren with respect.” A male kitsune to the left of Hina said to her.<br />
<br />
The kitsune beside her had a cinnamon brown color to his fur and he could see that the hakama he wore had several splashes of color on it.<br />
<br />
“Yes, I myself had....a similar yet different experience like that rude woman.” Hina said to the man.<br />
<br />
“At the very least, it’s nice to have dinner and a show.” The man said with a chuckle as Kiko had also heard this and began to chuckle himself as Hina couldn’t help but smile.<br />
<br />
“That was quite a jest.” Hina complimented the man.<br />
<br />
“Thank you, I’m Dai by the way, it’s a pleasure to meet you.” The kitsune, Dai, said introducing himself as he turned his head and Hina gasped as she saw he was wearing an eye patch over his left eye.<br />
<br />
“Oh....for-forgive me, I’m Hina,” Hina said gently bowing. “I was unaware of your…eye.”<br />
<br />
“Have you seen it around? I’ve been looking everywhere for it.” Dai said as he gave a little chuckle. “I’m sorry, but I haven’t let it bother me for some time now.” Dai reassured her.<br />
<br />
“Sorry I just...met someone with one eye before...” Hina explained.<br />
<br />
“Well I hope they weren’t a painter, because then we would have a problem and I wouldn’t get to know more about you.” Dai said with a little smirk on his face.<br />
<br />
“No, they weren’t they were just....someone bad.” Hina replied.<br />
<br />
“Well again, I am sorry, but I can assure you I just would like to have a nice conversation with you.” Dai said.<br />
<br />
“I’d like that.” Hina then looked over at Aaron and Nyx to see the two of them kissing.<br />
<br />
“But maybe we could take a stroll and have a conversation instead?” Hina asked.<br />
<br />
“I wouldn’t mind that, but is it okay with your friend here?” Dai asked referring to Kiko.<br />
<br />
“Oh! Yes, uh....Kiko-san, may I take a walk with this gentleman here?” Hina politely asked as she bowed towards Kiko.<br />
<br />
Kiko looked the kitsune over and then at Hina before nodding her head.<br />
<br />
“You may, just be sure to come back to the house when you decide to retire.” Kiko said.<br />
<br />
“Arigato.” Hina said as she bowed her head at Kiko in thanks and Dai stood up first then offered to help Hina stand up from her chair, which she reluctantly accepted.<br />
<br />
Hina walked on the right of Dai as they exited the capital and headed towards town, which was still decorated for the celebration that night. Hina didn’t say it, but she walked on Dai’s right, so she wouldn’t see his eye-patch.<br />
<br />
Hina and Dai looked at the beautiful decorations, although Hina was unsure of just what to say to him, after a moment, she thought a simple question would suffice.<br />
<br />
“So, your name is Dai? Is that short for something?” Hina asked as Dai chuckled a little at this.<br />
<br />
“You’re right, it is my name. Or at least, it used to be my name.” Dai answered. “You see when I was born, my parents named me ‘Daichi’, but it always sounded to me like I was meant to be a farmer, so when I grew up and found my passion, I changed my name to ‘Dai’.” Dai explained.<br />
<br />
Hina now looked at his hakama and remembered his joke from earlier about being a painter.<br />
<br />
“I presume from the colors on your once beautiful hakama that you are a painter by trade?” Hina guessed.<br />
<br />
“You are right on your presumption. I used to paint all kinds of things: animals, portraits, flowers, the city, it was all so amazing that you wouldn’t believe my craft if you saw it. But...something changed me some time ago.” Dai explained.<br />
<br />
“What was it?” She asked.<br />
<br />
“The war.” Dai sighed.<br />
<br />
“Oh, I’m....I’m sorry. The war was hard on everyone. I....should know.” The black and white vixen said.<br />
<br />
Dai looked around at everyone having a good time, then looked over at Hina to see her rubbing her arms and looking distraught.<br />
<br />
“Would you actually like to come see my art studio? It’s not that far from here? I have a great collection of paintings.” Dai asked as Hina looked a little unsure at first but silently nodded and gave a little smile.<br />
<br />
A few streets over from where they were, Dai directed her to an art studio that looked like it needed some repairs on the outside. Dai held the door open for her as she stepped in and her jaw dropped at all the paintings that hung on the wall of the inside of the store. There were paintings of a mother and child, some of trees, a few of fields, and a few of soldiers standing at attention, although those looked a little older.<br />
<br />
“Please forgive the mess, as I said I was involved in the war some time ago and only recently had inspiration strike me near the end and I wanted to capture the moment before it left my mind completely.” Dai explained as paint brushes, easels, canvases, and palettes were almost everywhere without being organized.<br />
<br />
“What....what was it that you painted?” Hina asked sounding a little unsure in her question as Dai now reluctantly unveiled a canvas that had been covered up with a tarp and Hina gasped as she saw the image before her.<br />
<br />
It was of the three Harris children standing above a figure, namely her, but offering her their gentle hands.<br />
<br />
“I know it may be hard to look at, but please listen to what I have to say before you say anything.” Dai asked kindly.<br />
<br />
“No, I’m...I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have come, I need to go.” Hina said nervously as she began to leave.<br />
<br />
“Hina, please, I beg you. Please stay, I promise you, what I have to say are words of kindness and not of cruelty.” Dai explained as Hina was halfway to the door.<br />
<br />
Hina didn’t know why she stopped, her heart was beating fast, her mind told her to leave, but for whatever reason, it seemed her heart was telling her to stay. Slowly Hina turned back around and stood a little ways away from Dai now and nodded for him to proceed.<br />
<br />
“I used to be an artist that would paint the usual like I said, flowers, portraits, nature. But when I was tasked with joining the army during the civil war, my days of painting seemed like they were over as I exchanged my paintbrush for a sword. I fought alongside the other kitsune soldiers defending the land for Tatsu and Shizen. It was during one of the battles, my left eye was permanently blinded. They say that one has to have an eye for painting perfection, but with the loss of my eye, I presumed those days were over. Towards the end of the war, I tried to use my spare time to paint, but my eye for painting seemed to have been lost just like my actual eye.” Dai explained as Hina looked a little saddened now. It had after all been her war that caused Dai to unintentionally lose his eye.<br />
<br />
“But then something happened, that I didn’t think would happen to me. My love of painting was rekindled not by a battle, but by an act. An act of kindness. Yes, I witnessed the Harris children spare the life of Hinata that made me feel inspired again and as soon as I could return home to my studio, I painted the moment from memory. I tried to remember every look, every feel of that day and moment, I seemed to go at it for hours, only stopping once or twice to take a drink of water. But when I was done, it was the most magnificent thing I had painted in so long. I presented the painting to Lady Shizen who was very impressed with it and said she would hang it up in the halls of the capital. I told her that I called the painting ‘Compassion’ as it was not only what those Harris children felt, but it was what I felt when I saw that moment. It was so...profound to me. It was from that painting that I rediscovered what I wanted to paint now: moments in time.” Dai explained as Hina was astonished such a moment had affected him too.<br />
<br />
“There’s an old saying that a war can change a person and I believe it’s true. I saw it when I saw you tonight at the celebration. I recognized you, but I didn’t really know you. You are not the same kitsune you were before, the war changed you, didn’t it?” Dai asked as Hina gently shook her head.<br />
<br />
“No, it wasn’t the war that changed me…I’m lost…I’ve always been lost…” Hina said as she looked at the painting. At once Dai understood and nodded his head.<br />
<br />
“Listen, I haven’t really shared my love of painting with anyone for a while now, and I want to give you something to remember tonight, as I had a wonderful time tonight and I hope you did as well. One moment, please.” Dai asked as he went behind the counter of his store and returned with what looked to be a blue flower.<br />
<br />
“It’s a myosotis, but I prefer the more common name, forget-me-nots, in the hope that you not forget our time tonight.” Dai said as she reached out for the flower. As she did, he placed his other hand on her hand gently.<br />
<br />
“I did have a good time tonight and I hope you might consider visiting me again soon as I’ve enjoyed your company tonight.” Dai said as Hina gave a little blush on her face.<br />
<br />
“I...I...hai, I would like to meet with you again soon. Perhaps the day after tomorrow? I’m assisting Kiko with something and I don’t wish to cancel my plans with her.” Hina asked as Dai nodded.<br />
<br />
Hina slowly left the store as she waved at Dai from the outside before proceeding back home. She held the myosotis in her hand and looked at with a smile as she held it closely to her chest.<br />
<br />
Kiko was waiting for her, as it seemed she had gotten tired from the celebration and arrived home not too long ago as she was still in her kimono.<br />
<br />
“I see you’re back, did you have a good time with that nice young man?” Kiko asked.<br />
<br />
“Yes, it was a night I won’t forget. After tomorrow, I’m going to visit him again. He was very kind.” Hina said as she took the forget-me-not with her to her bedroom. She considered doing some practice moves before bed, but she looked again at the flower and just decided to go to bed instead.</p>
