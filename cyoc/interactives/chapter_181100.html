<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ashley touched her ears looking in the mirror and then poked at her tender belly button.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow...&quot; she mumbled before pouting at her reflection and then reaching over to the table and getting the pants she had been provided. She stepped into the jeans and was surprised at how tight there were. She had wore skinny jeans even as a guy being a bit of a skater boy before, but male skinny jeans didn&#39;t feel so snug until they were more pulled up. These felt like they were snug from the moment her first leg slipped in. She slid them up but then started to have a little bit of a struggle as she wasn&#39;t able to get them over her butt easily. She had to struggle and jump and tug looking at her pert butt in the mirror half packed into her tight bottoms before it finally popped into place. She sighed feeling slightly released as the jeans hugged her tight but were no longer tightly pulling into her hips and was now tightly wrapped around her shape.<br />
<br />
&quot;No wonder girls love yoga pants...&quot; she commented as she buttoned them up. She put on her simple white ankle socks that were tucked in her shoes and then slipped on the sneakers with no issue. Checking out the tank top they gave her she scrunched it up and then pulled it over her head and tugged it down. It felt her form well and seem just a tiny bit too snug. She would tug it down but it would show too much cleavage, so she tugged it up and it exposed about an inch of her tone tummy between her jeans and top. She sighed figuring that was the right way to wear it looking herself over now fully dressed. She was such a hot girl this was so fucked up! She bit her lip a bit and considered the conversation she had just had figuring she had to get out of this room and talk to her parents. Then Some men came in telling her time was up and she jumped a bit. They picked up her purse and put it in her hands before escorting her out of the building.<br />
<br />
Ashley stood there in the parking lot for a moment looking around seeing her car was gone.<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Where is my car?&quot; she asked aloud looking around and then attempting to go back inside but found the door was locked.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile Jordyn just got a chill.<br />
<br />
&quot;They are ready for you now.&quot; Elizabeth said leaning up over her desk to point over to the opened door. She was sitting there for almost a half hour wondering what was taking so long.<br />
<br />
&quot;Finally&quot; The tiny girl said moving over to the hall and finding herself in the processing room. She turned around lost as the room was just a big white blank room getting more confused as the door she walk in from was now gone. Before she could even react she would find herself tensing up and shifting as her bones cracked and grew. Her transformation was likely to be one of the most intense since she was so tiny to begin with as she kept growing and getting wider and lankier letting out some girlish shrieks as she cried to herself. The room god dizzy and she felt her eyes starting to painfully stinking making her reach to rub them as her vision was changed to no longer need her thick glasses. Her body started to feel itchy as she started to get some more body hair. Especially her face as it shifted to become more masculine and handsome but also added in the roots of facial hair she might want to grow out some day. She fell to the floor now in her strained tiny outfit in her now 6&#39;3&quot; body as she felt like she was feeling that sensation you feel right as you&#39;re no longer able to lift a weight again at the gym. Right before your arms give out, but all over. She started to sweat bullets as she got more and more fit until she had a toned lean and masculine body. Then she would feel and intense burning in her crotch as her clit started to grow and change becoming both more and less sensitive in confusing ways while her puffy nipples shrank down until there were just simple male nipples. After squirming on the ground for about 10 minutes as her crotch reworked she finally gasped and shuttered as she started to have an extremely powerful orgasm in their panties. It was unlike anything she had ever felt so intense and focused sending out a jolt to her whole body with each burst before it finally came to an end. She laid there finally opening their eyes seeing noting but a blur through her glasses before water started to rain down on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What- WHAT?!&quot; she now he started hearing their deep voice and instantly questioned their own question as metal arms reached over ripping off their stretched and painfully tight outfit as they washed his body and moved to cut and style his hair in a simple male hair cut before slipping on a tight pair of blue briefs and setting them down.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else a table with some clothes and their new phone appeared right before a mirror suddenly shot up in front of them.<br />
<br />
&quot;The processing has been complete. Please wait a moment for assistance. There will be an orientation later this week, and information has been preloaded into your new phone.&quot; A voice said which was a different message then the one the rest of her family got as she looked over at this cute but lanky boy in the mirror in nothing but his underwear she started.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait... no way!? T-that cant be- UGH!&quot; she gripped her side feeling dizzy and started to fall as she fell back on to a wheel chair that had appeared there. She felt so hungry and so tired like her body was dying.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry it&#39;s alright&quot; a woman&#39;s voice said from behind the chair. Jordyn turned over to look up at the woman seeing a sexy bombshell of a woman. She hard dark chocolate color skin and curly black hair. Her face was stunning with full lips and piercing grey eyes. She was dressed in a tight white nurses dress the kind you didn&#39;t really think existed outside of movies. The dress had a lot of cleavage and normally this sort of woman would invoke feelings of jealousy and resentment, but Jordyn found himself staring at her boobs and just kind of blushing. The woman smiled down and giggled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems you&#39;ve got a lot to get used to.&quot; she said pointing down at Jordyn&#39;s lap and then he looked down to see his now massive boner tenting his underwear. Their dick was huge. Why do they have a dick?! he thought feeling sick for a moment wanting to stand up but feeling too tired.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.. for some people when they go through more.... intense changes. Your body just didn&#39;t have all it needed to finish it&#39;s change.&quot; she explained Jordyn looking into the mirror up too the hot nurse behind him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no worries. You body was just way too small for all the muscles it was meant to grow. That being said you are processed, so after eating enough your body should be able to finish changing. Till then though it can feel quite... uncomfortable.&quot; she said rolling Jordyn away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well get you and IV and some food and a bed and you should be done growing no no time.&quot; she looked over some papers that had been on the back of the wheel chair.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow... you have a lot of mass to grow.&quot; she said looking down at the skinny lean body in the chair who was going to be turning into quite the beef cake over the next day or so.</p>
