<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bills mind was realling! Surly his brother had just had a good growth sprut it was impossable for him to have gotten shorter things like that only happen in the
<br>
 movies and not in real life! Bill just smiled at him he didnt want to give Kevin an edge on him! &quot;Yea so what! Your still smaller then I am squirt! And if I wanted to I
<br>
 could kick your ass right here! And you know it!&quot; Bill said in a low deep tone trying to sound like he was tougher then he felt at the moment. In reality Kevin
<br>
 actually looked almost as big as he did when he cchecked himself out just five minutes ago! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill pushed by him and went down stairs he was starving to death by then and just wanted to get something to eat and get away from Kevin before any thing
<br>
 happened between the two of them! Bill was beginning to worry about looseing his advantage over Kevin by actually getting into a confentation with him and have
<br>
 the chance of looseing the battle. 
<br>

<br>
 Kevin watched as Bill started down the stairs, he noticed that he was wearing his jeans and he was going to say something about it! He was feeling cocky and abit
<br>
 self assured about being taller then his older brother now! And besides he had a score to settle with Bill after what he did to him earlyer that day! &quot;THOSE ARE
<br>
 MY JEANS BILLY!&quot; Kevin knew that would get Bills attention! He knew Bill hated to be called Billy. Bill swung around and glared at Kevin! &quot;What did you say
<br>
 you little freak!&quot; Bill said in a menacing tone. Kevin smiled he wasent afraid of Bill anymore for some reason and it felt good to stand his ground against his once
<br>
 bigger brother! Kevin knew that Bill looked smaller then he did even that mourning! But he didnt know why or even care why he was going to be the victor this
<br>
 time and he knew it! &quot; I said I want my jeans back Billy!&quot; Kevin said in a very cocky tone. Bills heart jumped abit his little brother was treating him like he was the
<br>
 bigger one! And for the first time in Bills life he was begging to have a fear of what this little upstart could actually do to him! Was he really afraid of Kevin? It made
<br>
 no sence! Why was he afraid all of the sudden! 
<br>

<br>
 &quot;LALA LOOK KE KE KEVAVIN! Bill frooze he had just studdered like a scard kid! He could hear it in his voice! Bill turned around and tryed to go down stairs
<br>
 before Kevin said anything else to him! But it was to late Kevin was laughing his ass off he had his big brother scard of what he could do to him and he knew it!
<br>
 Kevin turned around and quickly caught up with Bill and grabed the back belt loop of the jeans Bill had taken from him and pulled them in a down ward thrust!
<br>
 They left Bills thinning waist fairly easyly and bunched up around Bills knee area! Bill was freaking out! He knew they were loose around his waist but not that
<br>
 loose! 
<br>

<br>
 Bill turned around and looked up at his brother! Kevin seemed to be even taller then just moments ago! But how could that be? Bill reached down and tryed to pull
<br>
 them back up. But before he could Kevin was on him and was trying to take off his boots Bill struggled to get control of the situation but was unable to get the
<br>
 upper hand Kevin seemed to out weigh him as well now and soon had his boots taken off his feet, even with them laced up! Bills underwear were slipping down his
<br>
 waist when he finally got to his feet and even his socks were coming off his feet! Bill was frantically trying to get away from Kevin with his jeans now all bunched up
<br>
 around his calfs! It all seemed like a night mare to Bill as he was knocked back down quite easly by Kevin and felt him snatching at the cuffs of the jeans and
<br>
 started to yank them off of him as he layed on the halls floor with his legs being pulled into the air by Kevins jeans that Kevin was physically removing from him with
<br>
 great ease! This was all just so wrong! Bills eyes were filling with tears of frustration and fear now as he felt the jeans leaveing his legs and his now bare thinner legs
<br>
 hit the floor naked!</p>
