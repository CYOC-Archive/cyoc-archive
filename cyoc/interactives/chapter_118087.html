<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His dad came into the room.<br />
<br />
“How did it go with deleting its online life?”<br />
<br />
“Done. All accounts cleared and deleted. No loose threads. I even made sure that no one it used to know will ever want to speak to it again.”<br />
<br />
“Good. I&#39;ve been going through its paperwork. Trying to find anything that might bring someone looking for it. He... Sorry. It had an annual dentist appointment, but that was easily canceled. Though that does remind me that we&#39;ll need to take care of it. Brush it&#39;s teeth and wash it and so on, on occasion.”<br />
<br />
“Sure,” Mark said. “That could be fun. I&#39;ve got some ideas for that.”<br />
<br />
“Tell it over dinner. It&#39;s ready downstairs.” That made Mark pause.<br />
<br />
“I completely forgot. We&#39;re going to have to feed it as well, aren&#39;t we? It&#39;s been there since last night. Probably getting hungry by now.”<br />
<br />
“We&#39;ll scrape in leftovers along with some vitamins or something. It&#39;ll be fine. No use waisting food.” His dad no doubt meant, no reason to waist food when they had left-overs, but Mark chose to hear that there was no reason to dump real food down a toilet. But maybe trash could be dumped down there.<br />
<br />
<br />
The urinal snapped to attention when the bathroom door opened again. Or as to attention as it could get. There was a fear of what might happen to it next, but for the most part it felt relief that someone had finally come in to visit it. Even if that visit was just to make him drink more piss. The smell of food wafted in from the hallway. The others had just had dinner. The urinal had missed both breakfast and lunch and was starving and thirsty.<br />
<br />
“Oh man, I&#39;m stuffed,” Matt said, shutting the door. He had some things under his arms which he placed out of sight beside the sink.<br />
<br />
“We were planning on flushing the leftovers down your drain, but I seem to have eaten everything up already. Still, there were some strings of fat cut off the ribs we eat. Bones of course, but probably not that good for the plumbing to flush that down.<br />
<br />
“We scrapped together the gravy that was left and the oily froth from the pan. Not so much on their own though. Maybe a mouthful of grease.” He pulled forth a blender and pored the fatty sludge broth into it.<br />
<br />
“Seeing as we&#39;re only going to feed you once a day, we should probably find more. But it&#39;s not like I&#39;m about to just throw perfectly good food down the toilet. Luckily, you forgot to take out the food trash last night. I think we can find something for you to eat in there.” He picked the food trash can up from the bench and started looking through it with a slightly grossed out expression. The urinal whimpered.<br />
<br />
“Ah, look. A nice ripe banana peel.” He plopped the brown peel into the blender. “Oh, and two brown apple cores.” He showed them each to the urinal before placing them in the blender. “Oh, you&#39;re a lucky urinal today.” He pulled out the slice of pizza from last nights dinner that had fallen on the dirty floor and placed it in the blender.<br />
<br />
“Oh, don&#39;t look so scared. It&#39;s practically fresh food. Only a few days old is all. This milk on the other hand...” Mark picked up a carton he&#39;d brought with him and smelled it. “Wow. Think it must have expired in the hot car when we drove up here.” He pored it in with the rest. The urinal could hear the plump from the lumps.<br />
<br />
“There&#39;s some left over noodles from your breakfast yesterday at the bottom I see.” He scooped the slimy stuff up and plopped it into the blender as well. “Wow. Pasta usually dries and stiffens. I don&#39;t even know what this goo it was laying in is.” He scraped out some more. “Extra flavor. Wow, it smells. There. Just about full. Wait a moment. Yes. One final touch.” He fished out some eggshells and put them in there with the rest, then put on the lid and turned the blender on.<br />
<br />
When it was done, he picked it up and brought it over to the urinal. “Open wide.” he said, cranking the urinal&#39;s mouth completely open. Then he pored. It slopped out like a pail, lumpy sludge that trickled thickly down the tube. It ran slowly, but all too soon it reached the urinal&#39;s helpless mouth. And it began to drink. The dinner tasted exactly as he&#39;d thought it would. Like half rotten garbage. It felt thick and fatty and clung to the inside of the urinals mouth and throat like engine grease. The urinal could feel the small bits that had remained lumpy and intact.<br />
<br />
The urinal bet that Mark had purposefully turned off the blender early. Egg shells and chunks of banana peal and unidentifiable slush slid under, around and over his tongue. Everything was tasted. And it was still being pored. It was so thick that it threatened to block the pipe to the urinal&#39;s mouth, and maybe even the urinal itself. Mark thought he&#39;d generously help speed things up, and began to piss.<br />
<br />
Mark smiled at the urinal as every chunk of garbage and every drop of piss was swallowed.<br />
<br />
“You better get used to this. I&#39;m going to feed you the trash every day from now on. But for now you&#39;ve been a good urinal. I&#39;ll tell Ashton to reward you.”<br />
<br />
Urinal felt his x-little brother&#39;s warm mouth start to suck on his cock down bellow in the basement. Why did it feel so good!? Why was he so good at that!? Despite all the horrible things, Ashton had the Urinal at the verge of an orgasm in under thirty seconds. He was going to cum! He was going to cum! The lips slowed in response to the imminent throbbing, softer and softer the closer the Urinal got to climax. He was right at the edge and Ashton was holding him there right on the brink with an ever so gentle breath on his quavering head.<br />
<br />
“He&#39;s good at that, isn&#39;t he,” Mark said, seeing the Urinal&#39;s desperate expression in the floor. He loves to do that but never get the chance with me. I don&#39;t have the patience. I&#39;m glad he has someone to play with. I told him he could play with you as much as he wants to today. He can go for hours you know. The only thing he doesn&#39;t like about it is when people cum. Doesn&#39;t like the taste. So he&#39;ll probably won&#39;t let you cum at all. It&#39;s his quirk and I indulge him.” Just as the desperate urge to cum began to subside, Ashton&#39;s lips were back on it, slurping so eagerly. The second edging in as many minutes. Mark had said hours. The urinal&#39;s eyes rolled back into his head. His mind was breaking.</p>
