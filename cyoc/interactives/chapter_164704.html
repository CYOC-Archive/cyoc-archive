<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Andy looked around trying to find where Morgan went, and then sighed when he couldn&#39;t place her in the crowds. He turned back and looked at Holland, swearing to himself that he did not know what that woman&#39;s deal was. &quot;Wow, that was something else,&quot; Andy commented to him, &quot;Would you believe I am not exactly trained with a sword?&quot; It was so strange how practiced Andy had been, but it was also almost like it was just natural for him at this point.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know what, neither am I.&quot; Holland responded, and looked at Andy&#39;s tight shirt and pants, chuckling a little bit, &quot;That was a really nasty move you made toward the end, groping yourself like that. You know I&#39;d love to fool around with you.&quot; Holland ran a hand through his hair, noting it seemed that his hair was a bit longer than usual but figuring he just needed a haircut.<br />
<br />
As Andy looked around for a new attraction, he did admit that his shirt was getting to be a little bit too tight on him and a little too sweat stained, clinging to him. &quot;Oof, shirts off...&quot; As Andy took off his shirt, he noted with a slight bit of trepidation that his body looked...different. Strong, weathered a bit more than usual, his muscles were tighter, stronger and bigger. Shoulders broad and strong, back wider and more apt, lats pushing out. His arms looked stronger, larger, forearms complimenting powerful biceps and triceps.<br />
<br />
&quot;Woah, I knew you were good looking, but damn does the sweat do it for you!&quot; Holland said, whistling at the sight.<br />
<br />
For some reason that made Andy blush a bit more, and feel his groin get a bit tighter. Holland was still in extremely good shape, and he found himself feeling drawn to Holland more. Andy quickly thought about all his different times across his life he had sex with women, and was relieved to find he still felt sexually attracted to them.<br />
<br />
Then Holland said with a mischievous grin, &quot;Well, I&#39;m gonna need to get my shirt off too...&quot; He quickly took his shirt off, showing his bodybuilder&#39;s physique and almost making Andy stop and stare at him. Holland was easily as muscular and ripped as before, but something about his appearance was seeming more youthful than before. Andy didn&#39;t know what it was, but it definitely seemed Holland had a bit more...natural energy to him now.<br />
<br />
Andy walked along, and Holland almost seemed to run along and look around, excited by the improvised faire in the ship.<br />
<br />
Before long though the two were met by another man, who stepped out from one of the nearby locations, &quot;Hey, you guys were the melee bros from the sword fighting attraction, right?&quot; The guy was tall and heavily muscled, but not exactly very well toned, powerfully built pecs, shoulders and arms contrasting against a thick, fatty looking stomach. He was dressed in a cotton shirt and leather pants, but looked definitely uncomfortable. Oddly, Andy could see it looked like some spots on his arms and possibly more of him were looking shiny and almost scale-like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;d be us.&quot; Andy responded, looking the guy over again, noting he was scratching those odd spots on his arms occasionally, outside his awareness almost, &quot;Who&#39;re you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My name&#39;s Allan, I got the &quot;dragon&quot; experience I guess. Whatever that means.&quot; He said with a shrug indicating he didn&#39;t know much about what was going on with these cards. &quot;Just felt like saying since I watched your fight that I never saw that kind of skilled melee before...&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy shook his head and said, &quot;Would you believe that that was the first time I&#39;d really handled that kind of sword before?&quot; Again, Andy almost couldn&#39;t believe it himself.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Allan chuckled for a moment and then looked at the two of them, &quot;Seriously? Seriously. Wow, I guess some guys have all the luck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland asked, obviously looking over Allan and checking him out, &quot;You know of any other attractions we can go to around here? Anything pretty fun?&quot; And Holland admittedly was very obviously planning on if not fooling around with Andy before the day was done trying to hook up with Allan.<br />
<br />
Allan seemed to catch the looks, and grinned a little bit, &quot;Well, if you&#39;re looking for fun around here now, you could try out something I did; the wizard&#39;s fortune-telling over by the entrance to this part of the ship. Said I have &quot;fire and glory&quot; in my future.&quot; He shrugged and then headed over and whispered to Holland, &quot;You down to fool around? I&#39;m mostly straight, but I&#39;m not gonna say no to a guy like you. Meet up tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland whispered back, &quot;Sure thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, Allan walked off, and Andy watched him leave, curiously observing him scratching at his back a little bit more. &quot;Huh, what a weird guy...&quot; Andy figured it would be a good place to head to, and led the way.<br />
<br />
Andy and Holland reached the wizard&#39;s shack before long, the place looking dusky and rather dark inside, in contrast to the bright and sunny atmosphere outside. Both young men looked at one another and wondered what in all this was going to involve. But they figured it was just an attraction, and the wizard was probably just building up atmosphere for the fun.<br />
<br />
Heading inside, Andy and Holland were nearly immediately met by the same wizard as from earlier, who ushered the two of them forward to come and sit down for their fortune-telling. &quot;Come in and sit down, boys, make yourselves comfortable.&quot; Andy took a seat readily, and Holland did so as well shortly after.<br />
<br />
The wizard brought out a large crystal ball from some part of the shack, bringing it over to their table. As soon as he put it down on the table, mists started to spill out from the crystal ball. Andy figured these were all some very impressive practical effects, while Holland looked outright mystified and somehow excited by this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now, first of you...&quot; The wizard said, moving his hands around the sphere, &quot;Andy. Andrew. I see a future of honor, glory, and great deeds ahead for you. Strength of arms and experience will be your ally.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy figured that was pretty obvious, and he guessed the wizard probably had everyone&#39;s cards and experiences written down or something. And then he went on to Holland.<br />
<br />
&quot;And young lord Holland...your future I see involves rulership, the rights and rites of kings, and learning of your duties and dues...&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland just grinned in response to that, leaning back and figuring that indeed the wizard probably knew their &quot;experience&quot; types coming in here. But still, he was loving the crystal ball and the mist stuff going on...<br />
<br />
The wizard then said, &quot;In the coming days ahead, you will see yourselves and your fellows alter and abridge as the junction between yourselves and your experiences continue, fear not, for these are only the inevitable conclusion.&quot; Andy and Holland tilted their heads, and just as Andy was about to say something, the wizard gestured, &quot;...such is all I can reveal for now.&quot;<br />
<br />
Andy got up, feeling a little bit confused, but figuring it was all in good fun, and led the way out of the tent. Holland following shortly behind, still visibly excited by the way this all went.<br />
<br />
&quot;That was so realistic, wasn&#39;t it!?&quot; Holland said almost shouting in excitement.<br />
<br />
Andy didn&#39;t know Holland to be this easily excited by something as simple as effects like that crystal ball and chuckled, &quot;Yeah, man, I suppose it was. What&#39;re you up to do from here? I mean, I&#39;m feeling pretty hungry myself...but I think there&#39;s still time for some sun up on the deck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Holland cupped his chin and said, &quot;Let&#39;s head out and go...&quot;</p>
