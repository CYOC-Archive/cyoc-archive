<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Acting-Rear-Vice-Sub-Commander Victoria was happy to see the invasion was going well. As the command in chief of the invasion force, she was the one doomed to be turned into a dim witted rubber doll servant as an example to all others who dared fail the Vulpton Council. Victoria did NOT want to end up like her big sister when she tried to invade a jungle planet with a similar evolution to what humans called dinosaurs where it turned out magic was very real and had to report her failure and submit to dollification. <br />
<br />
If it was true. Victoria did wonder at times if her own ship had on automated function chosen a human at random, teleport them aboard, convert them, then rewrite their memories, to make them the commander of this invasion. Well, true or not, Victoria had every intention of making Earth a new world in the budding Vulpton people&#39;s sphere of influence. <br />
<br />
It was good circumstance that had granted the Vulpton invasion rights on the pre-interstellar civilization. It was common knowledge that it was far more efficient to convert a planet&#39;s population than obliterate them, that was just common sense. <br />
<br />
The Lupus Empire was a shell of its former glory, its Emperor old and kept on life support and his court waiting with baited breath for him to draw his last, each one drooling at the idea of claiming the empire for themselves, which would tear what remained of the empire to a mass of squabbling war lords. <br />
<br />
The Neko-Meido and Draco-Ryu had been at war for a century, trading planets back and forth, and none saw fit to interrupt them keeping themselves busy. The Duel Consuls of the Neko-Meido and the Draco-Ryu Queen also seemed to have little interest to call a truce or cease fire. <br />
<br />
As for the Gynoidius ... they were busy asking another planet one inhabitant at a time if they wanted to become immortal robot women. <br />
<br />
Victoria had been sent with a single ship and just herself to enact the invasion. If she failed... the Council didn&#39;t consider it a big loss, the universe a big place after all, and they&#39;d have a doll servant to match one already in their use. <br />
<br />
Victoria had successfully permanently disable the nuclear arsenal of every nation on the planet before the invasion had begun, which was stand procedure. Disable biological, chemical, and nanotech weapons was next on the lest. She was surprised to find Earth didn&#39;t have any of the last ones. <br />
<br />
She had also been given a single conversion ray gun to start out with. Victoria had teleported a random human aboard her fly saucer, and didn&#39;t even ask for their name and simply blasted them. Their clothes dissolved first, Vulpton has a rule had no sense of modesty, let alone a sense of shame or embarrassment (but they knew fear, pain, dread, and humiliation well enough!). And with a coat of fur, such things weren&#39;t really an issue (the idea of clothes for modesty or protection from the elements was incomprehensible), and their foot pads were the toughest parts of their bodies (another reason the Vulptons had never invented shoes). <br />
<br />
The human&#39;s entire body had become what human would see as a humanoid fox. Orange fur, a white belly, and black &#39;socks&#39; and &#39;gloves&#39;, and a chest to turn heads. A large full fluffy tail, digigrated feet, claws, pointed ears, a muzzle and sharp teeth, and increased strength, speed, reflexes, stamina, and if Victoria did say so herself, intelligence. <br />
<br />
The energy from the former human&#39;s dissolved clothing was used to create a replica conversion gun, and a kinetic barrier against things like bullets and artillery shells implanted in a random spot in her body. Finally there was the earring with marks that symbolized her new rank and number in the Vulpton army. <br />
<br />
To the new Vulpton, it was like her life before was that of some stranger, she remembered every detail, every emotion, but it all seemed to trivial now to the glory of converting the human race to the Vulpton people. <br />
<br />
She stood at attention and saluted. &quot;Acting-Rear-Vice-Sub-Commander Victoria! Private Kakena, 9-3 8-09 7-5 28-57A, ready for duty!&quot;<br />
<br />
Even if she had been human a moment before, Victoria was happy for the presence of one of her own kind. &quot;Happy to meet you Victoria... we have a whole planet to conquer, we best get started.&quot;<br />
<br />
To make sure Kakena&#39;s experience had been properly conditioned, Victoria put her through some basic target range and reflex testing. Kakena passed with flying colors. The conversion was a complete success. <br />
<br />
The first people Private Kakena had converted of course was her own family, each receiving their own shield and conversion ray in the process. <br />
<br />
Victoria did have standing orders that children who were converted to the Vulpton race were to kept away from the hot zones and regulated to non-dangerous work and to continue their mundane education (now including Vulpton technological lessons and history), Victoria may have been a ruthless alien invader, but she wasn&#39;t a monster. <br />
<br />
Vulptons away from the new fronts were given the job of getting society and basic public services up and running where the conversion battle had laid waste to. Though they quickly adopted Vulpton social mores and upgraded their community with Vulpton technology including medical services, Victoria wouldn&#39;t have the new Vulptons living like savages after all. <br />
<br />
This included them continuing to chat with humans not yet converted via the internet, superior Vulpton technology easily breaking through their feeble firewalls, and those Vulptons who had a nack for it, spreading messages about how it would be so much better if humans just accepted the prosperity the Vulptons offered. <br />
<br />
Victoria for her part, stayed on the flying saucer to coordinate and keep an eye on things. Kakena and her family still visiting her on a weekly (a Vulpton eight day week, not a human one) basis. Her nieces and nephews were so cute! The kits loved playing knights and princesses in the ship&#39;s holo-room, once Victoria had properly programmed in the scenario as they described (with proper changes for Vulpton values of course).</p>
