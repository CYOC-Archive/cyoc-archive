<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jean and Greta were listening to the radio as they drove across the country on a busy highway, not realizing the old Chevy Bel Air that they had just passed were looking for them. Greta was smiling as she heard that the wishes she had made were already bearing fruit. <br />
<br />
North Korea had totally collapsed as the leadership of that country formerly declared its illegitimacy in a grand spectacle, and the cloistered nation&#39;s liquidation was already in motion as it began the transition into being re-unified for the first time in decades with its southern neighbor. <br />
<br />
The Sahara desert meanwhile had completely transformed into a lush savanna, a rolling green grassland that went on forever in an endless epoch, with multitudes of animals and insects starting to graze, eat, mate, and sleep there. The Gobi Desert, meanwhile, had transformed into a lush boreal forest, and the other deserts of the world had transformed too...<br />
<br />
Jean had her turn it off. <br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t want you getting any more ideas&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Kayla was nursing little Jo, breastfeeding her baby for the first time, her smile priceless. She loved it, and little did she know, so did Jo(e). It had been one of his biggest fetishes as a teenage boy. Martha was driving the classic car, while listening to a podcast on her phone about the first pregnancy that had occurred since the Great Change. A born woman had gotten her new woman former boyfriend/current girlfriend pregnant after the born woman had orgasmed and made the new woman suck on her breasts. Apparently, women could now create semen, and it could now be excreted through the breast. &quot;Interesting&quot; she whispered, looking over at her smiling wife.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Let us retire from this happy moment for a brief horrific vignette.<br />
<br />
Breath.<br />
<br />
Shelly could hear breath. That was how she knew when her master was coming. This house, this neighborhood, was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Sometimes that&#39;s what he would do, just drop pins or coins or once in a while even firecrackers in the darkness one by one for minutes or even hours just to build up the suspense, the calm before the storm. Sometimes it was just to fuck with her mind and keep her off balance. <br />
<br />
The pitch black room was suddenly filling with light. He was here. She began to shake with that horrible combination of terror and submission to the terror. <br />
<br />
She heard him walk down the stairs, more fleet of foot than usual, and as he approached Shelly to unlatch her chains, Shelly saw that it wasn&#39;t him at all.<br />
<br />
It was a woman. A short, petite woman with long, silken brown hair in a ponytail. She was unlocking Shelly quietly, a scowl on her face. It was then when Shelly noticed the serrated butcher&#39;s knife holstered to her pants. <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re...you&#39;re not my Master.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m your Master&quot; she said dismissively, as if she herself didn&#39;t believe it. <br />
<br />
This woman...girl might be more appropriate, was barely the size of a middle schooler. She was 4&#39;9 and 80lbs(Though she had the most perky of breasts), and when she upholstered the knife, she could barely hold it up with her stick thin arms. In fact, her hands her shaking under the weight. She was weak. Her eyes carried the same vacant madness her Master had, the one who had abducted her from her home when she was sixteen. Perhaps it was his sister? <br />
<br />
&quot;There was another bombing&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m running out of food, and because it&#39;s impossible to go outside lest we die of radiation poisoning, I think we&#39;re going to have to start eating each other if we want to survive. Since I&#39;m your Master...Mistress, I get first honors. Today, I think I will start by cutting the skin off your feet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Was this a test of faith? The Master had forced Shelly to kill some of his other victims before, not only to break her mind even more, but also to implicate her in his sick, perverse fantasies. <br />
<br />
Shelly didn&#39;t know what was going on. Ten years of constant torture and brainwashing and rape by her captor had broken her mind, but there was two things she knew. This woman claiming to be her new master...or mistress wasn&#39;t him, and Shelly also knew that despite the airs she put on, Shelly was bigger and stronger than her. <br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;OK, so you ladies want the grand tour, huh?&quot; asked James. &quot;Allow me!&quot; <br />
<br />
Regina and Aziz followed James outside the library and had returned to the archaic looking hallway where Regina had begun her adventure. <br />
<br />
&quot;So where should we begin?&quot; asked the man. &quot;The alchemy lab? It&#39;s where we turn lead into gold, and water into wine, and so on. Over there is Ms. Adams&#39; department in ancient runes&quot; said James to a room right across from the library. He walked down the hall, pointing at different rooms with a jovial quality that they both enjoyed. <br />
<br />
 &quot;And over here is...&quot;<br />
<br />
Regina smiled politely, laughing privately to herself. While she had dedicated her life to physics, she did have a few guilty pleasures, and one of them was fantasy literature. She didn&#39;t enjoy the bulk of it- The Tolkien&#39;s, the Lewis&#39;s, the Martin&#39;s...those didn&#39;t interest her. It was actually the more satirical stuff like Futurama, The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy, Terry Pratchett&#39;s Discworld. The reason she was laughing was how much of this place, if James was correct, reminded her of Unseen University. The absurdity of it all was overwhelming.<br />
<br />
&quot;This room might interest you two&quot; continued the smartly dressed man, as they walked up the second floor. The room had two very high wooden doors which made Regina feel like a small child. &quot;It&#39;s where we keep the multiverse apparatus. The eggheads explore parallel realities and lower level ground dimensions and make contact with the residents therein. It&#39;s one of my favorite parts of this place? Would you ladies like to try it out?&quot;<br />
<br />
**<br />
Reece Chung had been gone for over forty-eight hours, and was now officially a missing person. He had not returned to his home the night of his resignation from P.S 256, and when his attentive next door neighbor had not seen Reece&#39;s car in the driveway, the formerly elderly woman had reported his absence, and an investigation was declared. The last person who saw Mr, now Ms. Chung was a passing bicycle rider who had saw her crying on a bench outside the gates of the school.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean a date!?&quot; Allison squealed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, I guess&quot; said Logan. &quot;If sitting down watching people play baseball counts.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Logan, I&#39;d love to!&quot;<br />
<br />
Allison got off the phone with Logan, who had invited her to go out with her and her new mom to see the local baseball team play. She squealed her delight to her new friends Danielle, Suzi, Leanne, Adeline, and May, not to mention Sarah. They had all now been thoroughly acquainting themselves with their new lesbianism, and Suzi and Danielle had discovered to their delight that they&#39;d like to give being a couple the old college try.<br />
<br />
**<br />
<br />
Mary and Lucy called to invite Elizabeth and Robbie to go out for drinks later that night, just to reacquaint themselves after the Great Change. The couple had known Elizabeth, and by extension Rob/Robbie, for about three years and had hobnobbed at many different social occasions. Robbie&#39;s eyes had lit up for obvious reasons- she was now an exhibitionist now and wanted to see what new women would pay attention to her. She wondered if Mary and Lucy were down for a three way. That is, if Elizabeth was OK with swinging.<br />
<br />
Elizabeth was more apprehensive, and wondered where they would find a babysitter for Billie if they did go out that night. She also stared at Maria&#39;s phone number, wondering if she really should go to that religious meeting instead, among women much like herself who hadn&#39;t changed...</p>
