<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>A small story inspired by the premise of the story</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">At the third snap, Alex found himself in a body much bigger than his previous one. He is far taller and his reflection is more pleasant than his original. It was as if his appearance was well-taken care of from the moment he was born. He is privileged with the proper nutrients so that he could grow into the man of great-renown that he is today.<br />
<br />
Alex now aged-40 has a loving white and three sons that would take after him. He owns a small company in Texas, which funds his quaint lifestyle with his wife in a typical suburban mansion. His sons live elsewhere which presents a daily routine of rough loving with his wife in the bed. <br />
<br />
The Alex of this world used to grow tired of the same woman he’d pleasure every day. With the new virgin-minded Alex in the wheel, he fucked her new wife in a way that immensely surprised her. It was like their first date. Alex fucked her like a hungry predator, whose only goal in mind was self-pleasure and the deposition of his seed. <br />
<br />
They did this every day and lasted for a month before Alex grew tired like the Alex of this world. The body of a 40-year-old isn’t as flexible as he thought it’d be. Alex would find his back aching most of the day and he’d love it if he could get his 18-year-old body back. <br />
<br />
Alex returned to the mirror and snapped with his fingers, expecting to return to the life he left.<br />
<br />
When Alex woke up in a world unlike his own, where there are two moons in the sky rather than one, where his hair is blonde as opposed to brown, and where he’s twelve instead of eight. He grabbed the mirror by its edges and asked,<br />
<br />
“I told you, you cannot choose. The bodies you are transported in are random.” The mirror replied with a metallic drone.<br />
<br />
“But you said I can influence it with my thoughts,”<br />
<br />
“Yes, I said that. But your mind is preoccupied when we leave for this world.”<br />
<br />
Alex closed his eyes and engrossed himself at the thought of his mother’s face. He pulled the annoying voice of his younger brother in his mind, and the moping voice of his sister. He thought everything that would pull him back to his world. <br />
<br />
And then Alex snapped his fingers. He opened his eyes to see that he returned. He was back in his room and he could hear the faint voice of his brother. He rushed out to see him but he’s different… sort of. Then he realized his brother’s eyes were a different shade and shape. His room was different as well. Books are scattered on the floor and astronomy posters littered the walls. Paul should be dumb as bricks. He shouldn’t have things like these.<br />
<br />
Alex rushed back to the mirror.<br />
<br />
“I thought I was back!”<br />
<br />
“Yes, that is what you thought.”<br />
<br />
“What did I do wrong?”<br />
<br />
“Nothing. I said your thoughts merely influence the destination, not take control of it. Think as hard as you’d like, but there is a large chance that you’ll go elsewhere from what you’d like.”<br />
<br />
“Bu- bu- but…”<br />
<br />
“Sorry, I’m afraid I can’t hear you.”<br />
<br />
“But I should be back home!”<br />
<br />
The door behind Alex opened, and this faux-Paul came in wondering what the hell is the ruckus all about. Before he could meddle further, Alex snapped his fingers and transferred to another world.<br />
<br />
This time, he was alone in a spacious cardboard box. There’s a hole above and it seems Alex is using the box as an alleyway in the middle of the night. But the closer he looked at the skies, the more he realized that it wasn’t evening. The skies are covered in smoke and fog. The air is quite noxious, and his lungs are burning with every breath. His only solace is this mirror at this side. <br />
<br />
“Is there anything I could do to go home? Please tell me,”<br />
<br />
“Nothing. There is nothing you could do for me to take you home. That is not within my powers. Not even the people who created me could do it. They are as lost in the multiverse as you are.”<br />
<br />
“You didn’t tell me I’d get lost!”<br />
<br />
“You didn’t ask,”<br />
<br />
That was it. Alex lost his composure and punched the mirror with his trembling fingers. His arms are covered and bandages and moving them is already a pain. But he can’t think straight. The only emotion dwelling within him is confusion and anger. <br />
<br />
His punch connected with the mirror but it barely made a dent. He tried to throw it on the floor but its glass is as hard as diamond. They were unbreakable. <br />
<br />
“I’d advise you not to try and destroy me. Not for my sake but for yours. My creators made sure that I’m nearly indestructible. You are only hurting yourself in your attempts.”<br />
<br />
Alex screamed and nearly tore his vocal cord. He can’t think of anything. He can’t do anything.<br />
<br />
So he snapped and snapped and snapped and snapped and snapped…<br />
<br />
Dimensions and worlds flashed before his eyes. They would appear as soon as they disappeared. All the signaled their change is the rhythmic snaps of his fingers. When he found himself in a dimension without fingers, he’d click his mouth and the mirror registered it as a decision to jump to another world. <br />
<br />
Alex found himself in worlds like his own but with a degree of change. One had two suns but the other one was farther away. There’s one where his family had four eyes but the other humans of the world had normal ones. The most annoying of them all is where he spent nearly a year thinking that he was finally home. Then he realized the humans of that world still treated Pluto like a planet. Worlds like these are numbered little and far in between. <br />
<br />
Most of the dimension Alex found himself existed only in the dreams of the mentally broken and insane. There was a dimension where everything was a cartoon and obeyed cartoon physics. In that dimension, he has a rival who sought nothing but his personal amusement in torturing Alex. And his torture mode of interest is flattening him out with a comically large road roller. Alex would turn paper-thin but return to normal after a while. Alex doesn’t know why he stayed in that world for nearly a month. <br />
<br />
In another world, Alex was a millionaire who owned seventeen different planets. In another, he was a simple farmer in 16th century China. He was an actor, a doctor, a deep-sea diver, a royal mage for the king of Palustera, he was everything but he never returned to what he wanted - an 18-year-old boy living in Orion Valley. He wanted to return to a life where most of his worries were getting rejected by a girl or failing his tests, not the threat of supervillains or ghosts from another galaxy.<br />
<br />
Alex snapped. And snapped. And snapped. <br />
<br />
But he never returned. He was lost in the multiverse like countless others who used the mirror.</p>
