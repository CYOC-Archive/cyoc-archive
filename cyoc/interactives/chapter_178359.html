<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alex reached down behind him and took Eli&#39;s cock in his hand. It was warm and throbbing, just like he imagined it in his dream.  He started guiding it between his cheeks. He though he should need lube, but somehow he just knew he wouldn&#39;t. Maybe it was part of Chel&#39;s gift, maybe it was something about the way this world worked. But just as he had the head of Eli&#39;s cock pressed up against his hole he heard a deep growl come from the hunter. &quot;Don&#39;t do that unless you&#39;re absolutely certain.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex froze. Absolutely certain. A whole lot of him wanted to try stuffing that monster of a cock inside of him, but part of him was apprehensive. He had never taken any man before, not in reality. A blow job here or there, sure, but his ass was still unbroken. Because a part of him was worried, he held back. That damn promise to follow orders.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what I thought.&quot; Eli murmured. &quot;Not that I&#39;d love to try, but that will link us in a way that you might regret later. But..&quot; Alex could feel Eli&#39;s hands sliding over his skin. &quot;Maybe a consolation prize.&quot; One of Eli&#39;s rough, calloused hands tweaked Alex&#39;s nipples causing him to shiver. &quot;Oh, I see Chel visited you last night. Damned dryad and his games.&quot; It was said fondly though. The other of Eli&#39;s hands wrapped around Alex&#39;s cock and began to slowly stroke him off. &quot;You&#39;re just a kid into adulthood. Don&#39;t be so quick to tie yourself to some old hunter in the woods.&quot;<br />
<br />
Old? Alex thought. Eli barely looked to be past his mid-twenties. But he couldn&#39;t focus too long on the oddity, the twin pleasures of being jerked off and having one of his newly sensitive nipples teased at the same time was pushing any coherent thoughts out of his head. That hairy chest pressed up against his back heaved with deep breaths, and he felt lips and the scratchiness of a beard pressed up to the back of his neck. Any time Alex tried to join in with his own hands they were batted away, or met with a warning growl from the hunter, so Alex just let himself enjoy the attention.<br />
<br />
Alex moaned deep in his throat as he felt himself edging closer to orgasm, but Eli seemed intent on keeping him just away from it. Every time it felt like Alex was finally about to tip over into climax, Eli would pull back, keeping him floating on a high of pleasure. He seemed to instinctively know just how and where to touch to get the reactions he wanted out of Alex. Until finally after what seemed an eternity he finally let Alex cum. It was the most mind-blowing orgasm he had ever had. Being kept right at the edge causing him to shoot his seed with an explosiveness he had never managed before.<br />
<br />
&quot;Rest up, I&#39;ll make breakfast.&quot; Eli said as he kissed Alex once more on the back of the neck and slid out of bed. He brought the fire back to life with a few pokes of an iron rod, and started getting some stuff into a pot over the flames. Alex did as he was told and laid on the furs, waiting to come down from his high. If he could wake up to that every morning, he would never want to leave. The smells of cooking eventually pulled him out of bed and over to the table. Eli set a bowl down in front of him that had something that looked like cream of wheat, except filled with berries, nuts, and honey. Then a wooden cup was placed by him filled with Eli&#39;s special wine.<br />
<br />
Alex took up his spoon and ate some of the porridge, hmming softly at the surprisingly good taste, though he looked at the cup. &quot;I thought I was going to drink a jug of this this morning.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You were.&quot; Eli said, sitting down with his own matching meal. &quot;Until Chel messed with you. Too much change too quickly can be stressful on the body, so for now, you&#39;ll just have a daily dose.&quot; He lifted his own glass with a toasting gesture and downed it. Alex followed suit. He felt energy coursing through his muscles, feeling blood rush to them as he set the cup down. He looked down at himself, but didn&#39;t notice too much different.<br />
<br />
&quot;You won&#39;t see much change a cup at a time, that will take a while. Mostly it&#39;ll just help you maintain what you have.&quot; Eli reached out and tapped Alex&#39;s bowl with his own spoon. &quot;Eat, we have a long way to walk today and you need your energy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Alex started gulping down his meal with gusto, taking little breaks between bites to talk. &quot;So, Chel is your tree house?&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli snorted. &quot;Chel is a dryad. Dryads have to link themselves to trees to survive, that in turn causes the trees to flourish. Powerful dryads can claim whole swaths of the forest. This tree is one claimed by Chel. He keeps my home hidden and safe and in turn I help keep him, well, energized.&quot; Alex arched his brow and Eli narrowed his eyes at him. &quot;Didn&#39;t your fathers teach you anything? Dryads are a type of fae creature, they harvest dreams and emotions for power. The stronger the better. No doubt why the horny little leaf fucker was trying to get us to screw. A good fuck under a dryad tree can keep them going for weeks. I think he also likes to watch.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli smiled encouragingly as Alex finally set down his empty bowl. He stood and walked over to a dresser, pulling out another leather kilt and then over to the door to grab a spare pair of boots. Both were set down by Alex. &quot;Try those on, see if they fit. Hopefully they will do for now.&quot; Alex stood and did as he was told. Eli had to direct him on how to fasten the kilt, but he eventually got it, luckily since it wrapped, there was no size issue. Just the oddness of not having any underwear on. But after wandering the woods naked yesterday it was a marked improvement. The boots looked bigger than the shoes he was used to, and they did feel a bit loose once he put them on but not as much as he expected. Maybe he feet grew a little from yesterday&#39;s wine as well.<br />
<br />
Eli took a pelt off a hook on the wall and hung it on Alex&#39;s shoulders, fastening it below his neck. It kept his shoulders and back covered and warm, though left his chest exposed. &quot;Now you look like a young hunter.&quot; Eli said with a grin. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll just keep you as an apprentice.&quot; He laughed at the shock on Alex&#39;s face. &quot;No, I promised to get you to town, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eli got dressed himself then started ordering Alex about to collect things. Getting two travel packs ready. One with supplies for their trip and the other with his goods to sell in town. Then he held up a finger and reached up to a high shelf. He pulled down a long dagger with a deer antler handle in a leather sheath, then held it out to Alex. He took it gingerly and pulled it free of its sheath. It was sharp and the metal shimmered oddly in the light, almost long enough to be a sword, almost. &quot;My fathers gave me that when I became a man. You&#39;ll need something to defend yourself with if we get in trouble. Just don&#39;t nick yourself with it shaving, the blade is enchanted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can&#39;t. This is too much.&quot; Alex tried to push the knife back to Eli.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just for the trip. Wear it.&quot; Eli pushed it back and as required of him by his promise, Alex did as told, sliding the sheath onto his belt. The dagger felt oddly comfortable at his side, like it belonged there. Eli handed Alex one of the packs and he pulled it on, then they both left the hut, the entrance sealing back up behind them to the unblemished outside of a giant tree.</p>
