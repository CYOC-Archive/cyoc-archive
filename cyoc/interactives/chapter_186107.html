<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">When you, Jung and Isaac are at Lorry’s nightclub along with Qadeer and Uthman, other brothers run to greet you all. You tell them what’s happened on your side, while other groups tell you, too. Apparently, there is nothing on the beach side, but people in the park are gossiping about that they saw the big wolves. Uthman curiously asks “What is your problem with the big wolves?” <br />
Rob answers “Apparently, We it’s a werewolves. And one of them or all of them, I don’t know, is hunting our brother, Carl the cerulean boy” <br />
Qadeer and Uthman are shocked by the news, but Qadeer immediately asks “Wait, how can all of you are brothers? You guys are nothing alike, except of rubber body.”<br />
Eric happily replies “Yes, we’re not the real brothers. When we turned into rubber boys, it planted our brains that we were brothers.” Qadeer turns his head to you, says “That means.” And you finish his conclusion “That means you two will recognize us as your brothers while you two are changing and become our little brothers.” <br />
“Oh, thank for explanation, ummm….”  Qadeer says but he still don’t know Rob’s name. Rob who sees it, kindly smiles and says “Let me introduce out siblings start from oldest; I’m Rob, green is Eric, red is Alex, blue is Jung, orange is Leon, sky blue is Carl, white is Tom, black is Isaac, and clay is Sam.” All of us chimed at same time “Nice to meet, you two.” <br />
And Qadeer and Uthman replies “Nice to meet you all, too.”<br />
Then Tom and Isaac say “You know we really need nametags for introduction.”<br />
 “Yes, or the first alphabet of our name on our chest.” <br />
“Now, come to think of it. All of us here have different first letter of names; Rob is R, Eric is E, Alex is A, but I don’t about Jung.”<br />
“Jung, is your name start with ‘J’ or ‘Ch’?” Isaac asks the blue rubber brother and Jung answer “J”<br />
“Ok, Jung is J, Carl is C, Leon is L, mine is T, Isaac is I, and Sam is S.”  <br />
Isaac asks “You two names are Qadeer and Uthman, aren’t you? They aren’t English name, that’s for sure. So what’s your names’ first letter?”<br />
“I’m Pakistani, my name starts with ‘Q’ in English.” “I’m Egyptian. My name’s first letter is ‘U’.”<br />
“Wow, eleven different alphabet out of 26. What a coincidence.” Jung surprisingly says as all of you have to agree.<br />
Rob says “Come on, guys. We have a work to do. And you two can stay at staffroom while we are working. I’ll tell other staffs about you as our new little brothers.”<br />
We greet Christy who is overacting about our soon-to-be new family members, Ben that Sam looks at his large crotch for some known reason and other staffs. Leon place the remains of thongs on table and asks for two boy to protect them. You and your brothers leave Qadeer and Uthman in staffroom with some food that Sam orders from the pub and do your own works. <br />
Everything seems Ok for your family at the nightclub, that makes you and others relaxed. Then you hear the ‘Bang’ sound for the entrance door, you run to see what’s happening. And you see the door are broken and werewolves flow in the nightclub. The customers are running away and screaming, while those big werewolves try to capture men. But the staffs who strong are trying to hold back the werewolves and another ones are help customers evacuating. You who came to scene first, Jung and Eric came along with you see the werewolves’ leader, the alpha whose tall is around 2 meters with black silver fur. The alpha roars out loud to makes everyone stays still, other werewolves now go to circle around their leader. All of guys and you feel the pressure in air and shake in fear by the present of the alpha. Despite of the threat, there are seven people still run away and the werewolves capture them all. “Look like some people still feel uncomfortable, boys, why don’t you all help them relax with our welcome way.” The alpha show his fangs as he says. <br />
The werewolves are holding the men, waste no time pin their prey down, rip their preys’ clothes and fuck them full force in and out without of their preys’ protests. The more time has passed, the more protests are changing into moans to others’ and your horror who are watching the process as the victims are changing into werewolves. The victims are growing their furs along with their wolf tails, their fangs and their nails. Their dicks turn pink and change its shape to canine dicks while the dick’s skin are shrinking to the base to become sheathes and their balls are moving inside their own sheathes. The victims’ ears is pointier and their mouths are longer as their moans turn into arousal howls one by one. The last moment, the alpha shouts “Now cum as pledge to my pack.” And new werewolves were born by submitting their will to the pack as has orgasm and chime together “Yes, Alpha.” <br />
The people who have watched the seven men turned into werewolves, shake in fear as they see the other werewolves’ big horny dicks out of their own sheathes as it implies ‘please, run away, so we can fuck you.’ Despite of your fear, you need to be brave for your brothers and vice versa. And the alpha sees the defiance in your eyes and your brothers’ eyes and cocky smirks. The alpha starts his speech “Now the show is ended. Let me introduce myself. We, the werewolves of black fang Clan and I, their alpha, go here to this place for one propose. One of my pack desperately wants something that you here process.”<br />
There is no need to guess what the alpha implies as one of werewolves, the red fur one moves forward to where Carl is. You and other brothers are about to run to Carl, but the werewolves growls at you and others. <br />
At Carl’s side, he is worried about the red wolf is working to him and his brothers’ safety. Carl makes his fighting stance, he didn’t attend self-defend class for nothing if he wanted to join the police. Suddenly the red werewolf stops walking and cockily says “You don’t need to be this, Carlton.” <br />
Carl is shocked ‘how can the wolf know? Even so, how can he know my full name that I haven’t told anyone since I can to this island? It means he know me before I came to this island.’ The red werewolf see Carl confusing, smirks and says “Come on, Carl. I can’t believe you forget about, your best pal.”<br />
Carl observes the red wolf again, but doesn’t let his guard down ‘That smirk and that cocky way to get to your nerve. Don’t’ tell me’ Carl, who finally knows who the red wolf is, point his finger and shouts out “You are Connor.” <br />
The red werewolf, Conner starts to laugh of loud and happily says “So, you finally remember me. But I can’t blame for not recognize me. I means; look at me from some dude to big badass werewolf of mighty pack.” Connor flexes his muscle and lays his eyes on Carl “But you changes, too. Look at you, you become cuter that I want to devour you whole.” Connor says in his growl voice as he grin dangerously.<br />
While the red wolf is talking with Carl, you stand up attempt to move to Carl’s side, so do your other bothers. But one of the werewolf near you interrupts and pin you down “Don’t even dare, rubber boy.” You grit your teeth as you angrily look at the werewolf’s cheeky face as seven of your brother are pinned down, too. <br />
Back at Carl, Conner persuade him “Carl, become my Omega. Look at my new member, they are happy to be part of my pack and you can invite your so-called brothers to join us later.” With no respond from Carl as Conner expect, he says again “Come one, buddy, join my pack. Look at my perfect body, you can change for better just like me.” Eight of you prepare to fight the mutts that hold them, our hands start to crystallize. <br />
Carl looks at Conner tensely and firmly says “Yes, you’re right.” To your and your brothers’ horror and Conner and his packs’ satisfied, Carl loudly and clearly says “Yes, you change and I change. You have the pack that you are proud of, but I, too, am proud of my family so I will not join your pack.” You are so proud at Carl’s declare, on other’s hand, Conner and his pack are angry. As Conner tries to scratch Carl and angrily growl “CARL…” <br />
“What an inspiration declare, my boy, Carl.” The loud voice interrupts the werewolves who are about to cause the havoc for us tainting their alpha’s pride. The owner of the voice, the owner of this nightclub Lorry walks down in us like noblewomen elegantly, before any of you break your own holding. <br />
“Lloyd, the dog of that coward” The alpha growl angrily at Lloyd aka Lorry in fancy dress and Lorry replies “Happy to meet you, too. Andreas. Like the kids throws his tantrum when they don’t get what they want.” When Lorry walks forward to Andreas and his pack, they, including Conner who walks back to pack, step back as if they are scared Lorry. “Ahhh, you guys are fear this thing, right?” Lorry is amazed, says and show the thing, the long silver whip. The werewolves, even the alpha Andreas, are fear the wimp and Andreas tremblingly says “That wimp is made of.” But Lorry finishes the sentence “Wolfsbane for especially harming the werewolf.” <br />
Andreas begins to smirk and taunts “You well prepare, Lloyd. But are it stupid of you to think that you can win my pack alone?” And that’s the werewolves loudly howl and laugh.<br />
But Lorry who didn’t bother Andreas trash talk one bit, amazingly replies “Oh my, you are really not stupid to think you come here along without preparation.” And that stops Andreas’s laughing and the alpha asks “What do you mean?” Suddenly one of wolf from outside the nightclub runs in and says “Alpha, the large group of enforcers are here.” Andreas are gasp from what he heard and then he says at Lorry as he understand what the she-male implied “You called them.”<br />
Lorry give him a satisfied smile and dearly says “Yes, and I know, too, that you’re not stupid enough to stay any longer or else your pack will be eliminated. So which one is you prefer to lose tonight; your pack or your pride? The mighty alpha, Andreas.”<br />
“Mark my word, I’ll have you pay for this shame tonight.” Andreas angrily says at Lorry as she who is waving her hand, replies “If you can escape the enforcers tonight without losing anyone of your pack.” Andreas growls at her and loudly says “Everyone moves.” With that commands, all of wolves are running out of the nightclub as Conner hatefully stares at Carl who stares back at him, and says “We will meet again, Carl.”  <br />
After those werewolves, people happily cheer and some cry with joy. And eight of us run to hug Carl who still looks at the door without move. “You are really brave, I’m proud of you.” “That’s my bro, you rock.” “As expect of police trainee, you’ve courage.” We hug and laugh until you remember something “We need to check Qadeer and Uthman.” As all of you agree, your group go to the staffroom, while all of other staffs are taking care of customers and Lorry are speaking with the bos of enforcers. <br />
At Staffroom, you open the door and all of you see.</p>
