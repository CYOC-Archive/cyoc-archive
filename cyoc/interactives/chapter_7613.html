<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ty and Dustin had returned home after teaching the bodybuilder a lesson.  They couldn't think of anything to do, and the now 500 pound Dustin had settled into playing a video game while Ty thought over what to do.  Dustin was playing the legend of Zelda, on his old N64.  Ty himself, had returned his body to what it was that morning.<br />
<br />
  Ty looked at the scene on the Television.  The adult version of Link stood with blade drawn, and the towering villain Ganondorf was laughing maniacally.  Ty thought a moment, and then had an idea.  &quot;Hey Dustin.  Ever wonder what it's like to have pointy ears?&quot;  Dustin looked back at Ty, not following what he meant and then he felt warm.  His large body began to slim down, and his dark hair turned Blonde; parting down the middle.  His clothes melted away, revealing his lean body.  He had abs again, and his pecs became defined.  He felt a tickle on his ears as they began to grow, becoming longer and pointed.  His body was that of an athletic 18 year old, but with elf-like ears and his face had a more determined look to it.  He weighed in at 160 pounds, and was 5'8&quot;.<br />
<br />
  &quot;What about you?&quot; Asked Dustin.  Wanting to know what Ty would do to himself.  Ty closed his eyes and made another wish.  He began to grow taller, and his skin started to change hue.  His body went from being a pale peach-tone into shades of brown and then into an olive green shade.  His hair changed from a blonde to a fiery orange, and it spread from his groin to his naval and then grew in a patch on his chest.  <br />
<br />
  His body started to swell, his chest filling his shirt.  His thighs grew into the pants, stressing the blue denim.  He continued to grow upward, lifting the already tight shirt up and exposing a set of fat covered abs.  It was not a gut, but he lacked definition.  His arms swelled up and strained his sleeves, his forearms grew the orange hair that donned his other body parts.  He grew up to 6'7&quot;  and his muscled body weighed 320 pounds.  His clothing had melted away, and left his large cock dangling between his enormous thighs.  With another wish, clothes formed on the two naked bodies.  A green tunic and hat on &quot;Link&quot;, with white tights and a sword with shield.  Suede and leather formed on &quot;Ganondorf&quot; making designs in brown and black.  Enveloping his body tightly.  <br />
<br />
  The Two faced each other, and Dustin swung his sword at Ty.  He didn't want to do this, so he assumed that Ty had done it himself.  The sliced trailed down Ty's pants, which then fell apart.  Dustin's gloves started to glow, and he threw down the sword in his hands.  He lunged at Ty's freed member, which swung from side to side after being released from the tight leather prison they had been in.  He grabbed it with both hands, for a reason he couldn't stop.  His hands grasped Ty's dick with all their might, it grew hard almost instantly.  The two started to feel warm, and Dustin spoke up &quot;These gauntlets will steal your strength Ganon, you will be left as nothing but a shadow of yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Ty responded with a groan, he reached for his adversaries ass.  It felt warm, and it started to expand.  He felt it grow tighter, and Dustin noticed it too.  Dustin tried to let go of the dick, but some force kept him there, pumping the vascular member which began to shrink.  He looked at Ty's body, his chest beginning to shrink.  Dustin noticed that his own began to grow.  His grasp on Ty was doing some kind of trade off.  His belt grew tight on his waist, and Ty began to loosen it for him.  He felt his crotch bulging slowly outward, it behaved the opposite of Ty's.  His body swelled up, pulling on the fabric of his tights, which began to rip.<br />
<br />
  His body and Ty's body looked about the same now, though his clothes were tight while Ty looked like his were baggy.  His tunic stressed and ripped, while Ty's clothes fell off when they could.  Their bodies no longer contained, the growth hastened.  Dustin's muscles piled up on his 5'8&quot; frame.  Ty lost almost all his weight, and was left at 110 pounds, still standing at 6'7&quot;.  His cock shrank and slipped from Dustin's grip, and the two fell to the ground.<br />
<br />
  Ty lay there a moment, his weight still declining all the way to 85 pounds.  His body looked creepy being so frail, but he still grinned.  Dustin sat there, his once thin elf-like frame continued to swell to 395 pounds.  Dustin couldn't help himself.  He grabbed the waif-like ganondorf, and slid him on to his now 15 inch throbbing member.  He pumped him over and over, each panting.  He couldn't contain himself and shot a load into Ganons ass.  He tossed him to the side, and heard him say &quot;Thank you Link.  You have just done exactly what I wanted you to.&quot;  He waved his hand at Link and chuckled.  &quot;Your greed for mass will be your downfall, Link!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Dustin was shocked by what Ty, or was he ganondorf, his mind couldn't choose between the two names, had said.  He felt queasy, and held his stomach.  He was becoming fat!  Ganon had cast a spell on him!  He felt his body swelling up, an enormous gut came crashing down over his cock.  It hurt from how sudden it was.  His large pecs became large breasts and sagged down to his sides.  His ass swelled out in all directions.  He grew and grew while the thin ganon laughed.<br />
His body bulked up to 690 pounds in a matter of moments.</p>
