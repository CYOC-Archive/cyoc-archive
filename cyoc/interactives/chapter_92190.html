<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Meanwhile back to Jason...<br />
After watching the transformed jock hit the beach to infect others Jason had returned to his home.  At 18 he still lived with his mom and his older brother who was 21.  Jason&#39;s dad left to live with a new wife years ago and wasn&#39;t terribly missed.  He didn&#39;t want to be reminded of the life he left behind and Jason&#39;s family didn&#39;t really want to be reminded of him either.  As Jason entered his average lower middle class home; he passed his mom who was lying on the couch sleeping off another long night shift at her second job.  He frowned a bit in her direction, quietly whispering a greeting.  Down the hall he was surrounded by pictures and trophies.  Not of him.  His brother consumed most of the limited wall space in their house.  Tyler was the perfect image of a preppy jock: he was handsome and somehow always well dressed despite their income, good all around with sports, had excellent grades and even a few scholarships and he was certainly a hit with the ladies.  There was no spoken animosity between Jason or Tyler.  They played basketball together on occasion and Tyler taught his lil bro all the basics growing up, tutored him, helped him with sports and girls and was there when his parents weren&#39;t, which was most of the time.  His perfection only mocked the envy and bitterness he felt for his golden brother.  It seemed somehow more sinful to resent someone who was just so damn nice to him.  Tyler hated gay people though so of course so did Jason because he wanted to be just like Tyler.  He even chose his friends based on their similarity to the kinds of loud people Tyler would chill with.  But end of the day Jason was still just a sub average jock, struggling to pass his classes, fighting to make senior varsity football and always looking for the &#39;one.&#39;<br />
<br />
Jason passed a note on the fridge, it was from Tyler.  He would be spending the weekend at the next town over.  Likely clubbing and screwing anything with a pulse but that was Tyler.  He knew how to work and he sure knew how to have fun.  He promised to take Jason out for a week of insanity when he turned 21.  Jason still looked forward to that.  He washed a few dishes in the sink and microwaved some leftovers for dinner.  Mash potatoes and chicken.  Not a kings feast but it came from the heart, and his moms overtime.  He finished up and made sure the kitchen was immaculate as could be so nothing would stress his mom before heading upstairs to his room.  He locked his door and double checked it before sitting down at his old windows pc and entering his password.  The first thing to come up was a porn site... One with two burly men going at it every which way and the in the next tab repairative therapy techniques - for supposedly changing sexuality.  Jason smiled sadly to himself.  This was why James&#39; stupid Maker didn&#39;t affect him.  He was already gay.  No one knew not even Tyler, of course not Tyler.  Or if he did know he kept it to himself.  Tyler wasn&#39;t an easy guy to fool.  Jason browsed hopelessly through the usual articles, most of them bogus or disproven.  He didn&#39;t completly hate himself - most of the time.  But he wanted to badly to be like his brother and to be normal if even statistically speaking.  He couldn&#39;t ask for help or talk about it though even with other gay guy.  He figured they wouldn&#39;t be too understanding of his jealously of straight people and he was afraid hanging near them might make him act all feminine and shit and cost him his hard earned friends.  So he sat here, in the crossfire of his search for a cure and his self-indulgent needs.  Until then he dated girls and faked it til he made it.  But also something held him back, there was a reason he didn&#39;t simply use the Maker to turn himself straight when he had the chance because there was also a part of him that wanted to hold on to who he was.  He saw the agony in James and his friends eyes as their identity was magically stripped away entirely.  He didn&#39;t quite want that, not forever at least.  But he did want something and he knew how to get it now.  <br />
<br />
After a good long j session and a little self shame Jason cleaned up and made sure to lock down his pc again like Fort Knox.  He went to check on his mom, who was still sleeping, before heading back out.  By the time he got back to the beach James the new jock was nowhere to be found, there was also a gay surfer running around looking for his &#39;&#39;missing boyfriend&quot;.  Jason figured out the rest from there and followed the trail to the nearest mall where he was sure they&#39;d end up one way or another.  To his surprise he noticed both teens had already turned back, they must&#39;ve fought it tooth and nail but that was whatever.  He knew his moment would come soon.  Stealthily he followed them as they went to shop for clothes for the surfer and it wasn&#39;t long after that Jason noticed the warning signs on James face.  He saw the agony and fear in his eyes and noticed the Mexican guys walking by.  Jason smirked quietly to himself.  He watched a bit in awe of his own handiwork as James transformed into a Mexican hoodlum, replete with a bad attitude and tattoos.  The surfer boy ran off dejected to the other side of the mall, passing a group of cocky looking Europeans.  But James meshed right into his, temporary, new home with the other Latino boys.  This was the chance Jason had been looking for.  Ironically he knew to get what he wanted he had to do the last he ever wanted to.  He ran up to the boy who used to be a skater and kissed him right on the lips in full view of the other guys and quite a few mall lurkers including some he&#39;s sure he knew.  Ignoring how red his face was becoming he stayed ground until a meaty pair of caramel hands shoved him away and a heavily accented voice cursed him out for being &quot;a stupid mother fucking faggy white boi.&quot;  Jason felt the tingle of the curse spread through him from his still burning lips to the tips of his fingers even as he grew flushed and light headed from the weight of his shame.  <br />
<br />
Before his humiliation could worsen Jason fled the mall.  Part of him, a forbidden and dangerous part loved that kiss.  His first &#39;real&#39; kiss, were it only under slightly different circumstances.  The last of daylight was fading away when he made it back to his neighborhood.  He made it inside in a hurry, nearly smashing the door as he slammed it behind him.  But his race to his room was stopped in its tracks by none other than his mom, awake now and eyes shimmering with tears.  Her lips quivered with myriad of words she wished to say and her heart and brain fought for dominance.  <br />
<br />
&quot;I got a call&quot; she nearly whispered, frigidly.  &quot;You kissed a a man in the middle of the mall?  Do you know how much I&#39;ve sacrificed how hard I&#39;ve worked to raise you since your father left?  I&#39;m doing my fucking best here!  You brother, your brother does his best, do you have any idea how this affects me, how it affects him?  I can&#39;t deal with this right now... I&#39;m late for my shift.  I will be be back, tomorrow afternoon and we are going to have a long long talk!&quot;  Her icy muted tone was far worse than her screams and the silence as she left shattered something inside of Jason.  Any doubts he once had were broken and dead and now that his mom was gone this was his chance.  He swallowed hard like he just choked down the weight of the world, reminding himself this was the right thing to do.  <br />
<br />
He sulked upstairs with heavy steps and walked into his brother&#39;s bedroom.  Closing and locking the door behind him, he jammed all the windows shut and sealed up every curtain before turning on every light he could.  His brother&#39;s room was not unlike his own.  A simple single bed, made of course, a computer in the corner and several trophies up on the shelves.  Wrestling, football, basketball.  Also posters all over the wall of woman&#39;s volleyball and a few hot sports cars.  Typical guy stuff.  Inside the closet however were all of Tyler&#39;s XL preppy jock swag.  Most of it way too big for Jason, for the moment anyway.  He gave a deep sigh, it was now or never.  Slowly and with a shaking hand he pulled down the zipper of his jeans.  In the silent room the zipper pulling was nearly deafening.  Next he carefully popped the button and slid his pants and boxer briefs down in the front, just enough to expose his average sized 6 inch dick, slightly smaller now from the cold and the nerves.  Trembling and standing in the center of his abandoned brothers bedroom with his dick hanging out Jason slowly took his hand and ran his forefinger gently across the back of his member.  <br />
<br />
Almost immediately a freezing wave washed over him and not from the temperature.  He did it again and felt the wave intensify as his dick began to rise and point forward.  Another stroke, this one harder and with two fingers and Jason gave an involuntary shiver that ran down into his bones.  A final stroke down to his now engorged mushroom cap and Jason screamed out feeling something indescribable overcome him.  His whole body was now shaking wildly as if he was being juiced with high voltage.  His fingers curled and uncurled rapidly and his knuckles cracked.  His very flesh vibrated at the molecular level as the dark curse infected every strand of his DNA and crept across every synapse of his brain.  His eyes emptied as the pleasure and pain sapped his strength and consciousness and the blank glass that remained rolled up into the back of his head.  With a crash he fell backwards onto his brothers bed.  He groaned like a dying beast feeling his right hand began to change.  <br />
<br />
His index finger made a terrible popping noise as it lengthened, the digit growing longer and thicker and the bones cracking and shifting into place.  The already well tanned skin settling down a few shades darker from extra years in the sun and the nail becoming shorter and well trimmed.  He cried out as his hand convulsed and fingers flew in all directions, his thumb cracked and shot out to the side - bending in a horribly wrong way before breaking back into place much longer than it was before.  His other fingers followed suit snapping and cracking as they lengthened and swelled.  Bigger, tanner, thicker, neater looking.  His palm twitched and the visible veins engorged themselves at the rush of new blood and data reprogramming every cell in his body.   James could only laugh manically in pain and excitement as his whole handed popped a few extra sizes.  The strange appendage wasting no time in going back to work on his dick.  Every slow, teasing stroke sending another wave of changes across his body now doubly pleasurable as the foreign hand felt like another&#39;s touch upon him.  His dick growing yet larger and farther out, widening as it went as it changed into a proud sword to slay many a drunken woman.  Jason only laughed harder and gave a strained crooked smile; his balls churned and dropped further as they inflate themselves with his new jock seed.  The hair curling and spreading as his pubes darkened and thickened into a brown patch that spread out like a consuming wildfire.  Many of the curled bristly brown hairs found their way down his thighs which inflated like balloons, vast expanses of muscle sprouting beneath the pale hairy skin until it force his legs further apart, broadening his stance into a naturally arrogant stride.  The meaty tree trunk like thighs clashed together and vibrated with the force, the skin and muscle drawn taunt as a bows string.  Thick and raised veins cross crossed across the surface, racing to deliver blood fast enough to fuel his mighty change.  Jason cautiously sat himself up, still lost in the change as he heard a strange ripping sound.  A single big toe tore out of his left sock like a flower popping through the snow.  It was long and thick like his fingers and while formerly bare dark brown hairs began to worm their way out of the top of his toe and crawl back across his foot to connect with the hair swirling down his still growing legs.  Beneath the stretching material his other toes continued to expand out further and his foot cracked and lengthened going from a size 8 to 14 in mere seconds.  More hairs popped out on each toe as they fattened and his foot widened to compensate.  The sides and front of his sock endured a moment longer before it was completly shredded and his new big hairy foot lay bare and exposed.  Jason rested it on his knee in shock at the profound change.  It was one thing to watch his friends and enemies morph before his eyes.  It was far removed to feel the change happening to himself.  To see everything he is become everything he is not.<br />
<br />
Jason stood up unsteadily on his rapidly changing legs and single big foot.  He shut his eyes for a moment just feeling the energy racing around inside of him.  When he opened them it seemed as though the room was spinning like a game show wheel.  He swore the women in the posters came alive.  He heard their sexual moans taunting his ears and they seemed to beckon him with dainty hands.  Images of busty shameless babes squeezing their enormous, juicy double ds and tossing their sunlight colored hair around filled his dazed mind, leaving room for nothing else.  They shook their heads, teasing his mind.  Jason doubled over in mental agony and heard another loud rip as his jeans and boxers tore in the back as his gluts became swollen with muscle.  His tight muscular ass pushing out behind him and a few stray hairs growing out and catching the wind from the fan causing him to shiver at the previously unknown tickling sensation across his rear.  He grasped his butt cheek with his large hand, feeling the hairy but firm flesh.  Tight and taunt and full.  He shuddered at the power contained in every fiber of his body now.  His calves now continued to bulk up considerably, reaching out for room to grow like mad plants.  Titanic, tree trunk like legs ripped out from where had only been meager tone.  And all of course covered in coarse brown fur.  His legs gave another crack at the knee as his legs bent and knee caps expanded.  The bones broke and grew painfully causing Jason to howl at the aching agony but grimace as his height rapidly increased.  He caught his reflection in his brothers large closet mirror and gave a familiar cocky smirk, the same his brother often gave the same mirror.  Soon it would feel just as at home upon his own visage.  Soon he&#39;d have nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to hold him back.  The world would be his and he&#39;s be equal to the people he envies.  <br />
<br />
Another loud rip alerted Jason to the fact that his other foot had hit its growth spurt and his other sock lay destroyed around the monstrous and hairy jock foot.  His left hand had also begun its change, shaking much like the first as his fingers flailed and bent out of place during their insane outward expansion.  The joints making awful snapping and popping sounds and his palm expanding outwards.  He flexed his new fingers, smiling, making two giant fists before spreading his fingers out.  Theses were true jock hands.  The kind of hands the could Palm basketballs with absolute ease.  Brown hairs of course crawled out of the new pores in the back of his hands and across his vast fingers and knuckles.  Jason could only stare, still mentally assaulted with blinding fast slide shows of beautiful sexy girls in various states of undress.  Not a single memory of image of a man remained except his teammates in the showers but who the fuck looks in the lockers?  He yelled out as he felt his life being sucked out of him, replaced with the one he wanted yes, but still everything felt wrong.  Everything felt empty as he was stolen from inside himself, his persona kicked to the curb by this new hungry jock who was rapidly taking control.   He practically drooled, allowing this new passenger to take the wheel and drive him off, run him over.  He grinned, noticing his teeth aligning and whitening into a debonair smile sure to intoxicate any girl in a mile radius.  He licked his lips as they puffed up, becoming thick and kissable.  Jason, now nearly enthralled by his new self fervently tore off what remained of his jeans and boxer briefs and also threw off his shirt.  Standing there hard and nude, he eagerly throttled his waiting cock with a meaty paw like a wild animal, feeling the surging power rise within him.  More of his tormented mind expelled.  His first chest hairs appeared ever so slowly, poking cautiously out from around his nipples which had began to harden and swell, pushing forward and pointing down as they expanded to the size of nickels.  Beneath the pecs pushed into a hard meaty shelf, a mountain of impassable muscle.  Thick and heavy.  The hairs spiraled out from his nipples gracefully dusting his tan and ripped chest.  The fur surged down over his belly, his toned stomach caving in.  Deep tight crevices formed and expanded, solid and hard as granite his stomach painfully pushed into a potent 8 pack that could stop a bullet.  Jason growled and fell to all fours in a push up position, feeling his chest muscles continue to gain ground and his be pushed apart as his shoulders cracked and shot in opposite directions opening up his back.  His lats quickly toning and rising to the surface in a wall of solid meat.  Jason&#39;s arms buffed up considerably into hearty pipes with raging biceps that popped right out without a flex and gym tough triceps.  He quickly began pushing himself up and down.  Feeling the immense and tireless strength of his arms.  10 20 30... Still not a sweat.  His nude, hairy Herculean body took it all and kept going.  Kept growing and strengthening even at the expense of that faggot he used to be.  Fuck him.  <br />
<br />
He pushed himself back up onto his big feet and smiled at his reflection as his chin became chiseled and handsome, sharp enough to cut down forests.  The perfect amount of few days old stubble gracing his face as it grew out where once was nothing.  He ran a hand over the course bristles loving the feeling.  His eyes blinked and became a beautiful but menacing shade of green with a deep rooted bestial edge to them, a primal need to hunt pussy.  His bland dirty blond hair swept itself up in the front in that popular preppy style and darkened to a deep brown.  Finally, he thought.  Jason was in there, somewhere, aware and ecstatic about his change.  He was all he wanted.  With a final tug on his dick the pressure that had been building all this time was released in a beautiful explosion of white all across the mirror.  He felt every drop of his old self leave through his dick and smiled a huge goofy post-orgasm grin as he allowed the preppy jock to invade every molecule of himself.  <br />
<br />
He allowed himself to stride confidently over to the closet, his still massive but soft sick swinging between his beefy legs and he pulled out a of new looking beige cargo shorts which he pulled up over his thick veiny trunks, letting them brush over every hair and muscle.  The commando style allows his 10 inch monster to press into the front as if poised to plow its prey and leaving no anatomy to the imagination.  Next he slid on a tight teal collared shirt with the sleeves rolled up and the top 3 buttons undone showing just enough hair and muscle and the hint of his firm large nipples.  Just enough of a teaser trailer to hook his audience for the full night experience.  Finally he slid his giant jock feet into an expensive pair of cognac boat shoes, feeling them snuggle in nice and tight.  He wiggled his toes inside and flexed his fingers.  He gazed back at the mirror, bouncing his pecs beneath the tight shirt before running a big hand through his hair for the right amount of bedhead.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re all ready now you sexy beast&quot; he cooed in a deep luscious voice, rich with testosterone.  &quot;You got what you wanted now it&#39;s time to go for a little test run... Hope your bro didn&#39;t get started without us!&quot;  With that the new 21 year old preppy jock swaggered out the door to reintroduce himself to his brother and to have the time of his fucking life.  &quot;Chyeah broski gonna be a sweet ass night tonight!&quot;  The new man bellowed before heading out on his conquest.</p>
