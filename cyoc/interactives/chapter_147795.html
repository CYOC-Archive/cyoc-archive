<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Steve walked into the shower with a smattering of emotions. On one hand, his new body was betraying him by the sight of the younger and male Janet, while on the other hand, he was incredibly nervous about what they might do. Steve and Janet walked into the bathroom and then Steve quickly shut the door. He locked it and turned around to see Janet, with her shirt already off! Steve blushed as he looked slightly away.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw come on Steph, you&#39;ve seen me without my shirt before you know.&quot; Janet teased.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit.&quot; Steve thought. &quot;I forgot the &#39;unable to say real names&#39; thing is still on. This is gonna be a lot weirder than I thought.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh... I know... honey, it&#39;s just... not like this I haven&#39;t&quot; Steve barely formulated as his eyes locked on his excellent pecs. &quot;Her!&quot; Steve quickly thought. &quot;Her. She&#39;s my wife... not some, gorgeous... hunk.&quot; He kept thinking as Janet walked closer.<br />
<br />
Janet reached his arms behind Steve&#39;s back and gently moved in for a slow and passionate kiss. Steve wanted to not like it, but he pulled in deeper and embraced it fully. Janet backed up and yanked off the shirt Steve was wearing to reveal two, very large, very perky breasts. He covered them awkwardly and blushed even harder.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on.&quot; Janet laughed. &quot;It&#39;s not like I didn&#39;t see them already.&quot;<br />
<br />
Steve groaned internally as he remembered the one memory he had of him yanking off the dress he had been wearing. Steve began to feel his panties grow wetter. He bit his lip and watched Janet remove his boxers. Steve&#39;s jaw dropped as she saw the massive dick Janet was packing under his waist.<br />
<br />
Steve waisted no time now removing her panties as she moved in to kiss him. The two lovers began to makeup passionately, smoothly rubbing their hands up and down one another while they walked into the shower. Stephanie closed the door and Jake turned on the shower. They both started to laugh and began to splash water on each other.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooooo dirty girl!&quot; Jake joked as he slapped Stephanie&#39;s massive ass.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; Stephanie mooned finally giving into her new body. &quot;I&#39;ve been a bad, bad girl.&quot; She yelled as she shoved her as upwards.<br />
<br />
Jake wasted no time in ramming his massive cock straight up her pussy. She covered her mouth as she moaned and Jake began to thrust. At first it was slower, but then he started ramping it up. Harder then deeper then harder. Jake grabbed Steph&#39;s soaking wet, golden locks after 20 minutes of going at it. He pounded even harder than ever and both began to cum. Jake pulled his cock out just as his cum erupted from the tip of his penis and Steph collapsed to her knees with the internal jolts firing her up.<br />
<br />
The two finished their shower and climbed out slightly exhausted. Steve instinctively wrapped his towel around his chest and started to wrap the towel around his hair when his senses started to come back to him. He realized what he had just done and felt so much embarrassment. His post sex emotions took over and he started to cry. Janet noticed and walked over, dick still hanging out.<br />
<br />
&quot;Baby what&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked kindly.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s just, I&#39;m so embarrassed.&quot; He mutters through tears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey don&#39;t be. What are you right now?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
*Sniff* &quot;A girl?&quot; He meekly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s right, and reality has altered so that you&#39;ve always been one. You technically were never a guy. It&#39;s not only okay now, but it always will be. Do you love me?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then there&#39;s no problem.&quot; Janet chuckled.<br />
<br />
Steve laughed to as he realized he was being ridiculous. They were just having fun after all. No harm in doing stuff that reality will rewrite later. Steve then felt bad that he made Janet feel bad, so he decided to give him a treat. He bent onto his knees, grabbed Janet&#39;s dick by the base, and began to slowly suck.<br />
<br />
Janet held Steve&#39;s hair and moaned as Steve rocked her world. This went on for a few more minutes before Janet blew her load again and Steve swallowed it all down.<br />
&quot;Holy shit.&quot; Janet laughed panting. &quot;Is that how those feel to you?&quot; She asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh... yeah.&quot; Steve said, trying not to gag.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ha! Not as easy as it looks right?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I&#39;ll definitely appreciate these more.&quot; He muttered.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;ll appreciate giving them more.&quot; She laughed.<br />
<br />
The two hugged and Steve brushed his teeth for quite a while. Then, Steve and Janet decided they had enough fun for the day and both transformed back. They locked eyes and passionately kissed again, as both of them had never felt closer to the other than they did right now. They changed together, chatting about how fun it was to be young and the other sex, and then walked back downstairs. They found Alan still as an adult woman sipping some tea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh! Did you two have fun up there!&quot; He joked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;d say so.&quot; Steve smirked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Definitely.&quot; Janet agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; Alan replied. &quot;Well I&#39;m glad you&#39;re both back, because I am done being this.&quot; He said, gesturing to his massive tits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw are you sure honey?&quot; Janet asked sadly. &quot;I checked my contacts and you&#39;re my sister in this reality. We can have a sister bonding day and go to the spa!&quot; She excitedly said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ummm, I&#39;m gonna pass.&quot; Alan answered awkwardly as Steve chuckled to himself. &quot;Maybe you should take Megan on one of those, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d love it!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; Steve interrupted. &quot;Where is Megan?? Isn&#39;t school over?&quot; He asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yup it is!&quot; Megan replied as she walked in from the other room. She was her normal age and gender, but she was wearing a business skirt with a blouse. &quot;Alan told me what happened with you Dad. In case you&#39;re wondering, I used my powers to alter my life and make me a 12 year old teacher. It was crazy fun bossing around my classmates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, good for you honey.&quot; Steve said as Megan pulled out her mirror and changed back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot;Janet chimed in. &quot;Now that we&#39;ve all changed back-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;AHEM.&quot; Alan&#39;s feminine &#39;cough&#39; interrupted.<br />
<br />
*Sigh* &quot;Fine honey.&quot; Janet jokingly agreed as she changed Alan back.<br />
<br />
&quot;NOW that we&#39;re all back,&quot; Janet continued, &quot;let&#39;s talk more family oriented magic fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; Steve inquired.<br />
<br />
&quot;A vacation!&quot; Janet yelled to a confused family.<br />
<br />
&quot;But, we just took one.&quot; Alan said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that was just a quick long weekend sight seeing tour. This one will be a full blown holiday! And this time, we will not only take a break from work life, but our jobs as well.&quot; She explained.<br />
<br />
The family all looked at each other intrigued. <br />
&quot;Okay.&quot; Steve agreed. &quot;What changes do you have in mind?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh we can decide that when we get there. I&#39;m thinking location is more important.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then.&quot; Alan interrupted. &quot;Where then?&quot;</p>
