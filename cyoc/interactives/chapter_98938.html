<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mary Lou sighed.  &quot;Okay, sister. This is your plan. How do we do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn thought for a while.  &quot;Well, the change occurred after I washed you.  Maybe if you wash me, the effect will reverse and we&#39;ll get back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever you say.  Makes as much sense as anything else that has happened today.  Lay on your stomach on the ground.  It will be easier to wash you that way, &quot; said Mary Lou, as she grabbed the bucket, a sponge and a large scrub brush. Evelyn laid down beside her, prone on the floor.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just remember your promise. If your crazy idea works, and I do actually turn back into my old self, you have to use these &#39;nuts&#39; to set me free, &quot; she said, as she dumped some water on Evelyn&#39;s back. The water was cold, and Evelyn jumped a little.  &quot;And if it doesn&#39;t work, we leave just as we are, as soon as possible.&quot; Mary Lou started to rub the scrub brush across her back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, yes.  I swear by my first clutch of eggs that I&#39;ll make sure you get out of here, &quot; said Evelyn.  She placed her arms under her head, and closed her eyes.  The cold water was jarring, but the smooth motion of the brush felt nice, like a massage.    The scales of her back were tough, but the bristles still felt like little fingers slowly running along her skin.  As Mary Lou continued to wash her, she began to drift in and out of consciousness, relaxed by the comforting feel of the bath. <br />
<br />
Mary Lou poured another pail of water on Evelyn&#39;s back, and the water felt warmer this time.  &quot;Oooo.  Mary Lou, I think&#39;s working, &quot; said Evelyn, as she continued to enjoy the bath.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I think I can see it working, &quot; said Mary Lou, strangely.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, whatever you&#39;re doing, don&#39;t stop.  It feels great, &quot; she said.  Her body began to feel different, warmer all over. As Mary Lou continued to stroke her, it began to feel like Mary Lou was pulling her, stretching her, and each movement felt better than the last.  Her arms were beginning to feel a little sore under her head, so she moved them beside her body, palms flat on the floor.  She rested the bottom of her snout on the floor, and continued to drift in and out of consciousness.  She began to dream, and in her dream she was once again growing.  Growing and stretching, stretching and growing.  It seemed like she would never stop growing, but she felt so good, so strong, so powerful, she didn&#39;t care.  The dream seemed oddly familiar, and it disturbed her a little.  She tried to wake up, but still felt very groggy.  She tried to lift herself up off the ground, but her arms refused to lift her more than a few inches.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mary Lou...Mary Lou, stop.  I think something&#39;s wrong, &quot; she said thickly. Her voice sounded different  - deeper; and it was hard to form the words in her mouth.  Her words seemed slurred.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shh.  Just relax.  We&#39;re almost done. It&#39;s almost over, &quot; said Mary Lou.  Her voice also sounded different.  Higher and more feminine than she remembered. Mary Lou gently patted her on the back, and Evelyn noted that her hands felt different, too.  Smaller.  The brush no longer felt like fingers.  It felt like someone rubbing your back while you were wearing a thick leather coat, like her skin had gotten harder.  Evelyn was starting to get more alarmed.  She opened her eyes, and her vision swam for a minute.  After a while, her vision refocused and she could see both sides of the room.  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw someone bathing her.  It appeared to be a young woman.  <br />
<br />
Where is Mary Lou?, she thought dully.  And why is this strange woman bathing me? She looked the woman over carefully, trying to recognize her. She was about her age, with same color hair.  She even had the same haircut. <br />
<br />
Wait, she thought.  That girl looks exactly like me!  Evelyn was suddenly wide awake, and tried to buck away from the girl&#39;s hands.  But the girl just jumped on her back with a thud, and began to rub more furiously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy, easy, sister, &quot; said the woman.  &quot;Just a little bit longer, and I think it will be finished. Then you can go back to your pen, and keep your first clutch of eggs for yourself. You&#39;ve paid your debt to me. &quot;<br />
<br />
The voice sounded like her own, but she recognized the phrases immediately.  It was Mary Lou!<br />
<br />
&quot;Noo!  Stop! &quot; she tried to scream, but all that came out was a loud bellow. She began to buck more wildly, but Mary Lou refused to let go.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry , sister, &quot; she said, as she fought to stay on Evelyn&#39;s back.  &quot;But this is my chance for freedom. You&#39;ll soon learn that it&#39;s survival of the fittest in my world.  In order to survive, you have to do whatever it takes, use any adaptation to your advantage, and always look out for yourself. And I am a survivor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn was enraged now, practically wild, and bucked Mary Lou off her back with a ferocious roar.  She sent Mary Lou flying through the air, and into a wall with a hard thud.  Suddenly the door opened, and Adam ran into the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;Jesus Christ, Evelyn, &quot; he said.  &quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot;<br />
<br />
Evelyn turned to look at Adam, and tried to respond, but all that came out was a loud bellow.  She started to move towards him, to try and explain to him somehow what was going on.  He backed away, quickly grabbing a large tranquilizer gun off the shelf, and fired a dart into her abdomen.  She continued to advance, trying desperately to reach him, hoping against hope that he might recognize some part of her.  Adam quickly reloaded the gun, and fired again.  Evelyn slowly drifted off to sleep, and dreamed of a happier time - a picnic at the lake with Adam.</p>
