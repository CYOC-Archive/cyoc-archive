<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Armor clattered noisily as three armed soldiers charged up the stairs. <br />
They were all clad in identical uniforms consisting of heavy iron gauntlets, boots, and helmets with green tabards emblazoned with a fierce lion’s head covering their breastplates. <br />
<br />
The man leading the charge had a golden sash to denote his elevated rank and status. The soldiers slammed through the doorway at the top of the stairs and spilled out onto the rooftop of the sprawling manse. On the far end of the roof stood a lithe figure clad in dark red tunic and brown leather tights and a burgundy traveling cloak slung over his shoulders. He slowly turned to greet his pursuers. A smug smile was easily visible on his lips.<br />
<br />
“Good of you to join me, Captain.” The young man laughed. “I was beginning to get worried I would have to leave without anyone to witness my daring escape.” He continued with a feigned pout. <br />
<br />
“Claves! You’ve got nowhere to run!” The captain shouted back.<br />
“Nowhere to run? Now where have I heard that before?” The shady figure mused sarcastically. “Oh! I know. That’s the exact same thing you said last time I gave you the slip.” <br />
<br />
“Fan out! Try and cover his exits!” The captain commanded his two soldiers and then turned his attention back to Claves. “Where can you go from here? It’s one hundred feet down on all sides.” He sneered at the overly smug thief. <br />
<br />
Claves let out a whistle as he pretended to be impressed. “One hundred feet? I would hate to fall from here alright.” He mused in his casual melodic voice. “Do you think I could just jump down and skip the whole painful landing part?” He asked with a grin.<br />
<br />
“What are you planning?” The captain asked apprehensively. <br />
<br />
“It’s so much more fun if you try to guess first.” Claves responded, his smug grin never once leaving his lips. <br />
“My guess is you’re going to jail.” The captain shot back as he gave the order for his men to engage. <br />
<br />
“No, sorry, that is incorrect.” Claves replied casually as he took a step back and plummeted off the side of the building into the darkness below. The two officers looked over the ledge, but they could see no sign of the elusive thief.<br />
<br />
“Shit…” growled the captain. “Spread out. He couldn’t have gotten far!”<br />
<br />
Claves waited for the sounds of the soldier’s heavy iron footfalls to fade away before he pulled himself back up onto the roof. “Oh, baby. You are so talented.” He praised himself as he dusted off his shirt. “And they are so dumb.”<br />
<br />
Claves knew his pursuers would be scouring the grounds below, and so he took his time silently lobbing his grappling hook to the top of the neighboring guard tower and rappelling his way up. Thanks to his little stunt, the captain’s office was completely unguarded… as were the keys to every room in the house.  Claves smiled broadly as he used the captain’s own key to unlock the desk drawer and pull out the single ornate key that was stored therein. <br />
<br />
Several hours later, the guards had given up their search. It fell on the captain to once again deliver the bad news. He slowly approached the heavy set old man who was seated at a large ornate desk which was covered in stacks of paper. <br />
<br />
The captain bowed his head and delivered his report. “Lord Doyle… I regret to inform you that we have been robbed… again.” <br />
<br />
The baron seemed surprisingly nonplussed at the news of the break in. “Did he take anything of value?” He asked lazily.<br />
<br />
“Just the scepter, sir. It seems he knew what he was after.” The captain remarked sullenly.<br />
<br />
“Well of course he did.” The baron relied with a chuckle. “I put him up to it.”<br />
<br />
“Sir?” The captain replied in astonishment. <br />
<br />
The baron grinned knowlingly as he explained. “I commissioned him to steal the scepter for me. I used a fake name, of course, but he probably saw through it instantly.” <br />
<br />
“So it was a trap?” The captain asked. The baron nodded in reply. “If he knew it was a trap, why did he do it? Surely he knows that you wouldn’t make good on your offer to pay for whatever he stole.” <br />
<br />
“He did it out of pride. Simple as that.” Doyle responded with a bored tone in his voice. <br />
<br />
“If you intended for him to steal it, why didn’t you let us in on it?” The captain continued to question.<br />
<br />
“Authenticity.” The lord replied flippantly, but then a dark grin spread across his face. “I didn’t want him to leave out of boredom. Not before he took the bait anyway.”  <br />
<br />
Tell me men, what this thief’s more powerful asset?<br />
<br />
“Stealth.”  They all answered in unison.<br />
<br />
“Let’s just say twinkish rogue won’t be able to be so stealthy for much longer.”<br />
<br />
—<br />
High above the city, Claves was hopping from rooftop to rooftop with the greatest of ease. He had always felt at home on the rooftops of the busy city. It was the only place that he felt truly free. The buildings were all packed so closely together that he got to feel a little claustrophobic when down on the streets. He skidded to a halt on one of the higher rooftops and took a seat on the ledge. This was his favorite spot to sit and think. He could see the entire city spread out beneath him. The lights spread out for miles making the ground below look much like the heavens above. <br />
<br />
“Now what’s so special about this stick that the baron would try and trick me into stealing it from him?” Claves asked out loud as he reached into his satchel and pulled forth the golden rod. <br />
<br />
The scepter was pretty standard as far as over priced gem sticks go. It was just a solid gold handle with emeralds and blue diamonds encrusted on the top. It seemed harmless enough. He flipped it over a few times as he inspected every inch of it. Nothing looked out of the ordinary. <br />
<br />
He cautiously sniffed it in an effort to detect any toxins that may have been used on the surface; he knew the local lord well enough to know that the trap wouldn’t be lethal in nature, but it never hurts to check.<br />
<br />
Seeing no discernible danger in the scepter, Claves took off his gloves and ran his fingers over his prize. The craftsmanship was remarkable. He couldn’t find any blemishes or scuffs on the surface. This stick would fetch him a fair price if he ever decided to sell it. Part of him was keen on keeping it displayed above his bed at all times as a sort of trophy. <br />
<br />
He slid the scepter back into his satchel, but no sooner had he let go of the rod than he started feeling a strange sensation in his pants. It felt really good, as if he was in the throes of powerful arousal, although the rest of his body felt aroused as well. His dick didn’t even feel hard at all, but it was straining against the fabric of his pants. Claves watched the expanding bulge with bemused fascination. This definitely seemed like the baron’s style of trickery. He slowly got to his feet, aware of the weight of his steadily expanding endowment. It was so cramped in his pants that it was actually starting to hurt, but he knew that wouldn’t last long; the stitches in his crotch were already popping. It wasn’t long before the fabric gave out completely and his now massively enhanced member spilled out.<br />
<br />
The head of his soft cock now rested just above his knees and had considerable girth.  His balls were now larger as well to match his endowment.</p>
