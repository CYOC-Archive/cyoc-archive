<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">We arrived at the pool and went into the changing rooms. I was glad that I wouldn't have to worry about any bulges showing through my swimsuit. I would be able to change here and not have women stare at me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I won't put it on!&quot; Harrietta said. We had been fighting her for the last five minutes. First she wanted to go into the men's changing room. When we finally got her into the women's changing room she refused to take off her clothes and put on her swimsuit.<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to wear it if you want to go swimming&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a girl's swimsuit&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes it is and you are a girl&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No I'm not&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
I smiled and said &quot;You know you just used a double negative. What you just said is that you are a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not a girl!&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm tired of this&quot; I said. &quot;Harrietta, you are wearing your swimsuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrietta's clothes changed. Her skirt disappeared. Her shirt and panties fused together, her shirt changing from a tee shirt to the top half of a one piece swimsuit, and they changed color to a blue Hawaiian print. Her swimsuit that she didn't put on changed to the clothes she had worn. It changed color, the bottom becoming pink and the top yellow. The top part changed into a tee shirt while the top<br />
and bottom separated to form a shirt and panties. The skirt that she was wearing reappeared with her shirt and panties.<br />
<br />
Before Harrietta could do anything Sam had scooped up her clothes and put them in the locker she was using.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's not fair!&quot; Harrietta complained.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop complaining&quot; Sam said. &quot;Unless you want her to do something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not going to win am I?&quot; Harrietta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fine then&quot; Harrietta said. &quot;I'll wear this. This doesn't mean that I like it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course not&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
I had finished changing by this time and so had Laura. She was being good for me now. I hoped that she would grow up different this time. Maybe I should erase her memories of her life as Larry. If I did that though this wouldn't be a punishment.<br />
<br />
&quot;Allison&quot; Laura said interrupting my thoughts. &quot;I've been thinking. Maybe it would be best if you erased mine and Harrietta's memories of our previous life.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; Harrietta said. &quot;I want to be me still!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know about that&quot; I said. &quot;I was just thinking about it. If I did that then the transformation wouldn't be a punishment and that's what I intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was just a suggestion&quot; Laura said. &quot;Could you take me to the carnival tonight?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll see&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see if that fortune teller is there still&quot; Laura said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You had seen a fortune teller at the carnival?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Both me and Harrietta did&quot; Laura said. &quot;It was the night before we kidnapped you and Sam.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did the fortune teller tell you?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;She said that we would meet a couple of people walking alone&quot; Laura said. &quot;She also said that we wouldn't be ugly anymore and that we'd be able to get dates.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So that's why you kidnapped us&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;No&quot; Harrietta said. &quot;We had met a couple of people earlier and thought they were the ones that the fortune teller was referring to. We kidnapped you because we found out that you had dicks. Originally we were just going to rape you like we did with other girls.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I already figured that you two were responsible for those rapes&quot; I said. When I had turned them into little girls the news stories of the rapes never appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me but it sounds like you're accusing these two little girls of raping someone&quot; a woman said. She had heard at least part of our conversation. &quot;Are you doing anything naughty with them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They've been inserting their fingers and dicks into our pussies&quot; Harrietta said in a rush.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then I'm afraid that I'll have to arrest you&quot; the woman said as she pulled out a couple of zip strips that the police are using now. &quot;Now we can do this the easy way or I can call for back-up. Which would you prefer?&quot;<br />
<br />
We couldn't be arrested so I had to think fast. The woman was obviously here to go swimming. Could I alter reality to make it so the woman had been here swimming already and didn't hear us talking? I was about to find out as I said &quot;Ma'am, you have been here for awhile swimming. You did not hear us talking as you were not in here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the woman disappeared. I was pretty sure that she was outside swimming.<br />
<br />
&quot;That wasn't very nice&quot; Sam said with a hard edge to her voice as she turned to Harrietta. I knew that tone of voice. Sam was pissed and I wasn't too happy either.<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you going to do about it?&quot; Harrietta asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you really want to know?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah... no&quot; Harrietta said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then you better behave&quot; I said. &quot;If you pull a stunt like that again you will be sorry. Do I make myself clear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harrietta swallowed hard and simply said &quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good&quot; I said. &quot;Now let's go get in the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
Outside we saw that Rayna and Bandor were laying quite far from the pool. I knew that they wanted to go swimming so why weren't they swimming? I decided to ask them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey&quot; I said. &quot;How come you two aren't swimming?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The chlorine and chemicals bother us&quot; Rayna said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well we'll just have to fix that&quot; I said. &quot;This pool uses advanced filters to keep the water clear, bacteria and algae free, and ph balanced without chlorine or other chemicals.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks Allison&quot; Rayna said. &quot;We really want to swim.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; I said. As I looked around I could see so many people that I could potentially change. A smile crossed my face. This could be a fun day.<br />
<br />
We were swimming for a few minutes when we heard a kid arguing with his mother.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to swim some more&quot; the boy whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't Michael&quot; his mom said. &quot;We have to go to the hospital for your treatment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why do I need the treatments anyway?&quot; Michael asked. &quot;They hurt.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you don't you won't develop as you should&quot; his mom said. &quot;If only you were born a girl. You wouldn't need these treatments then.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam looked at me and smiled. I smiled back at her. &quot;Should I let them keep their memories?&quot; I asked her.<br />
<br />
&quot;You can always erase their memories if they're too freaked out&quot; Sam said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're right&quot; I said. &quot;Michael and his family retain their memories when reality shifts and they also receive new memories to fit the new reality. Michael is a girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
We watched as Michael changed. He didn't change much. The only thing that we could she was his hair get longer and his face and body take on a girlish form. His swim trunks changed to the bottom half of a girls bikini and the top appeared around his chest covering his nipples.<br />
<br />
Michael was now a girl and her mom looked like she was about to scream. She didn't though. Instead she took a deep breath and looked at her daughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened Mom!?!&quot; Michael asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know&quot; her mom said. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it's strange&quot; Michael said. &quot;It feels weird wearing a bikini but I have memories of wearing one before.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have new memories too&quot; her mom said. &quot;At least you don't have to get those treatments.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I hated them&quot; Michael said.<br />
<br />
I was getting curious as to what Michael's new name was. We hadn't heard it yet.<br />
<br />
Michael's mom looked around confused and asked &quot;Why isn't anyone coming over here? Surely people saw your transformation.&quot;<br />
<br />
I decided to tell Michael and her mom what happened. I got out of the pool, went up to them, and said &quot;I can explain what happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You saw Michelle's transformation?&quot; her mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm the one who caused it&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did you do that?&quot; Michelle's mom asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever I say is the truth&quot; I said. &quot;If what I say isn't true then reality alters to make it true.&quot; I didn't tell them about the ring. I didn't want too many people knowing about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well thank you for changing her&quot; Michelle's mom said. &quot;By the way, my name is Alice Fisher.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome Mrs. Fisher&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's just miss&quot; Miss Fisher said. &quot;I'm not married. Michelle's father was killed in a jewelry store robbery a couple weeks after I found out I was pregnant. He was buying an engagement and wedding ring. He lived long enough to tell me that he was planning on asking me to marry him that night.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am so sorry&quot; I said. &quot;If you want I can make it so that the robbery never took place.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leave the dead be&quot; Miss Fisher said. &quot;I have accepted his death.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok then&quot; I said. &quot;I'll respect your wishes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you&quot; Miss Fisher said. &quot;Now what is your name?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I should have told you before&quot; I said. &quot;It's Allison Douglas.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nice to meet you Allison&quot; Miss Fisher said.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was nice to meet you too&quot; I said. &quot;And you as well Michelle.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks&quot; Michelle said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome&quot; I said.<br />
<br />
I went back to Sam and continued swimming.</p>
