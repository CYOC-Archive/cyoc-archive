<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Benny woke up from the weirdest dreams. They were less dreams and more a replay of some of his favorite memories. Him and Grant sneaking out of the house at night to meet up with friends and see a movie. His first crush, and his first break up. His first time being with someone, and his last. That should have left him hard as a rock but there was still the disturbing absence of his old friend between his legs. Tad still lived in town, maybe he should see if they could hook back up, even for a night. He sniffed and caught a somewhat familiar scent in the room. Opening his eyes he rolled his head towards the young man sitting in the chair by his bed. A punkish looking hyena, staring at him with his arms over his chest looking pensive.<br />
<br />
A few years younger, a few less piercings. &quot;Max?&quot; The name was thick in Benny&#39;s mouth and he looked around for some water.<br />
<br />
At his name, Max broke into a grin. &quot;So you do remember me?&quot; He seemed to guess what Benny was looking for and poured from a pitcher of ice water on the bed stand, handing it over.<br />
<br />
Benny propped himself up before taking a sip of the water, letting it dampen his mouth before speaking. &quot;&#39;Course I do, I helped take care of your fuzzy butt when you were a kid, even if you have been avoiding me ever since you got into town.&quot; The memories came up unbidden. A snot-nosed little hyena that thought he was the shit. The afterschool program Benny worked at during his las few years back home, where the kid hung out after school. It was kind of like having the little brother he never did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your fault for becoming a cop, chief. I got a reputation to maintain.&quot; Max ran a hand over the top of his spiked orange headfur, grinning.<br />
<br />
Benny laughed. &quot;Except rumor has it your boyfriend can be stiffer than the sheriff.&quot; Mention of that zebra made Max&#39;s grin go from cocky to fond. He just shrugged, not really having a retort for that. &quot;So, all I had to do to get you to come see me was end up in the hospital, noted.&quot;<br />
<br />
Max winced. &quot;Oo.. low blow, man. Yeah, sorry I haven&#39;t been around. It was kind of shitty, but you know. I might be able to risk the blow to my cred and grab dinner sometime. Introduce you to Stripes as long as you don&#39;t try to recruit him. But, uh, how you been holding up? Life good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Other than the last couple days? Yeah.&quot; Benny nodded.  Something about that seemed to mollify Max and he nodded in turn.<br />
<br />
&quot;I gotta get my ass back to class. I&#39;ll give you a call, still have your number, I think. If not, get a warrant, raid the dorm for &#39;nip, I&#39;d love to see the look on one freshman&#39;s face. Just warn me so I can get pics.&quot; Max stared for the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maxie.&quot; Benny&#39;s call stopped him in the doorway. He didn&#39;t know where the question was coming from, just that he had to ask it. &quot;Are you happy?&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a slight sound of metal clinking as Max&#39;s ears twitched at the question. Then in the most serious tone he had ever heard from the hyena, he said, &quot;More than I ever was before.&quot;<br />
<br />
Benny felt something unknot in his chest at that. He couldn&#39;t say why, but it felt like letting go of a ball of anxiety deep down inside he didn&#39;t even know he was carrying.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Grant stood outside of the hospital room, chewing on one of his finger claws. Was that a new him bad habit, and old him bad habit, or both? He knew he did it here, but he couldn&#39;t recall otherwise. His hands had changed shortly after breakfast, the remaining human traits he had could all be easily hidden with clothing. Looking in the mirror had been.. surreal. <br />
<br />
How did you even talk with a younger brother you didn&#39;t have two days ago? Normally that&#39;d be a baby, but a full grown bull bigger than you.<br />
<br />
Their first talk had been easy, Benny was out of it, and Grant just said what felt right. Hopefully that would work again. The door opened and that punkish looking hyena stepped out, looking happy. Maybe not happy, serene. Grant moved to go in the room but felt a hand on his upper arm stopping him.<br />
<br />
He turned to look into the suddenly very serious face of a hyena. They were comical looking smiling, but serious, you suddenly remembered those jaws were for crushing bones, not giggling. &quot;Janey may not have been the best sister, but she tried.&quot; The hyena began softly, then nodded to the hospital room. &quot;Who&#39;s that to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My little brother.&quot; Grant said honestly. &quot;The best person I&#39;ve ever known.&quot; And he knew he meant it. Benny was a sweetheart that put everyone before himself. Stable, calm, sure. &quot;I&#39;d do anything for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Remember you said that.&quot; The hyena said, then grinned and let go, heading off towards where Oakton stood.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
Benny hugged Grant as tight as he could. It had been a while since he had seen his brother in person and was conscious enough to enjoy the experience. He&#39;d never admit it to the hare, but despite the fact he had been the bigger of the two of them since he was fourteen, Grant always made him feel protected.  He always seemed so confident and sure of himself, so seeing him worried was all sorts of wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s got you in a twist?&quot; Benny had asked, but Grant simply put him off with a shake of the head. That had stung a little, he couldn&#39;t recall anything Grant had ever kept from him. He was the one that got the call or text when Grant figured out his marriage was ending. Or when he had a bad day at work, or really any problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just the future.&quot; Was all Grant said, all it seemed he could say. Maybe he didn&#39;t know himself. But something had his brother in a funk, and he was doubting himself.  Benny wagered it had something to do with that kangaroo, Tanner. He had only come up briefly, but the way Grant lit up talking about him. He was smitten. Probably felt guilty about meeting someone new so soon after his divorce. It would be nice if he fell for that &#39;roo, though. He&#39;d love having his brother move to town and be close by again.<br />
<br />
Now, how to make sure this stuck.</p>
