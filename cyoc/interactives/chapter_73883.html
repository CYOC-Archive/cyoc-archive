<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">I was not expecting anybody, so the knocking at my door startled me for a moment.  I approached my door slowly <br />
and called out, &quot;Who is it?&quot;<br />
<br />
A soft, familiar voice replied, &quot;Joe, it's me.  Can I please come in?&quot;<br />
<br />
I instantly recognized the voice as that of my neighbor Rachel.  Rachel was in her mid-20's, a few years <br />
younger than me.  She worked in modeling, but for some reason hadn't found a lot of success.  I couldn't <br />
understand why as she was one of the most attractive women I'd ever known.  She had long, jet black hair, a <br />
perfect hourglass figure, and ample breasts that were natural and not overly large.  She was also a very kind <br />
person who always had a smile on her face and was very outgoing.<br />
<br />
I sensed something wrong as I opened the door.  Rachel stood in the doorway and appeared to be shaking <br />
slightly.  Her head tilted to the floor and her hair covered her eyes.  I could see that she sported a large <br />
frown, but the rest of her face was obscured.  She clutched a purse and a few loose pieces of clothing.  Taken <br />
aback, I quickly answered, &quot;Yea, come on in,&quot; and opened the door wide enough for her to enter.<br />
<br />
She slowly entered my apartment.  Her feet barely lifted from the floor.  She dropped her things on the small <br />
coffee table that stood in between my couch and my TV, then sat down on the couch.  I turned off the TV and <br />
sat on the opposite end of the couch.  I could still not see her face as she kept her head down.  &quot;Can I get <br />
you something?&quot; I asked.  She did not respond in any way.  After a minute of quiet I decided I had to know the <br />
problem.  &quot;Rachel, what's wrong?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Finally she looked at me.  The sight was truly shocking.  Her right eye was black and blue.  She had a large <br />
bruise on her left cheek.  She rolled up both her sleeves to reveal more bruises and marks on her wrists and <br />
arms.  A tear rolled down her bruised cheek.  &quot;This,&quot; she said.  &quot;All of this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who--&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Adam,&quot; she answered before I could complete my question.  Adam was her boyfriend and supposed agent.  I had <br />
met Adam a few times.  While he had never been overtly hostile, he struck me as someone who was all talk.  He <br />
bragged how he had connections and could make Rachel a star, but considering her somewhat stagnant career, he <br />
couldn't have been doing anything to help.  &quot;I finally got the nerve to tell him I'd had enough of him and <br />
that it was over.  He just...flipped out.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my god,&quot; I said.  &quot;When?  Where?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A few hours ago in my apartment,&quot; she answered.  &quot;I don't think you were home.  Someone heard it, because the <br />
police showed up and arrested him.  They took me to the hospital, had me fill out these forms, treated me.  <br />
They told me it was best to stay somewhere else.  I'm sorry, Joe, but I couldn't think of anywhere else.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, that's OK,&quot; I said.  &quot;You know me, happy to help.&quot;  I tried to sound encouraging, but probably came off <br />
sounding like a fool.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm worried he might come here,&quot; she said.  &quot;He could make bail and if he comes back to my apartment, he <br />
might think I'm here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did you fill out a restraining order or anything?&quot; I asked.  She nodded.  &quot;Fine, if I hear him I'll call the <br />
police.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you can't stay here and guard me,&quot; she said.  &quot;You have to live your life and go to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
I glanced at the ring.  &quot;I might be able to work something out,&quot; I said.  I was unsure if I should tell her <br />
about the ring.  &quot;Just don't worry about it, you've been through too much.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you sure you don't need anything?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
She gingerly wiped her face so as though not to aggravate her bruises.  &quot;I could use a shower,&quot; she replied.  <br />
&quot;Try to wash away this feeling.  If that's OK.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course it is,&quot; I said.  &quot;Let me just go get some towels for you, I'll be right back.&quot;  I got off the couch <br />
and headed to the bathroom.  As I walked away from her I made what could only be called a face of worry.  My <br />
bathroom wasn't in the greatest condition.  I walked into it and turned on the light.  The sink and mirror <br />
above the sink were a little dirty, as was the floor and the shower itself.  Not a way to make a good <br />
impression, I thought.  I rubbed my hands on my head.  In doing so I felt the ring.  I suddenly had a good <br />
idea.  I wished for the bathroom to be in great condition, sparkling clean and completely in order.  In <br />
another flash my bathroom was in perfect condition.  Everything did indeed sparkle with cleanliness.  <br />
<br />
Satisfied that the ring did indeed work for &quot;small things,&quot; I gathered a few clean towels and returned to the <br />
living room.  Rachel waited patiently on the couch.  &quot;Here's some towels,&quot; I said.  &quot;Do you have everything <br />
else you need?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said.  &quot;I got them from my place before I came here.&quot;  She slowly lifted herself from the couch and <br />
retrieved the necessary items from her purse.  I walked her to the bathroom and handed her the towels.  She <br />
managed a small smile and said, &quot;Thanks, Joe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Take as much time as you need,&quot; I said.  She closed the door and I returned to the living room.  I sat on the <br />
couch and pondered what to do next.</p>
