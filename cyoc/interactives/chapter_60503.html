<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hunter had always been pretty good at, well, everything. There were kids that were better than him at some subjects, but each of them had <br />
something they were terrible at. No matter what lesson it was, Hunter had always taken to it like a fish takes to water. And even though <br />
everyone remarked on how ridiculous it was, he didn't think it was all that bizarre. Just one of those things.<br />
<br />
They also pointed out how easily he stayed in shape. He would point out he went swimming three times a week. They would compare him to <br />
his fellow swim team members. It was true, he was easily the most defined out of all of them. Just one of those things.<br />
<br />
If any bad word could be said against Hunter, it was that he was quiet. Ignoring the fact he often sneaked up on people without meaning to, he <br />
was a man of few words and spent a lot of time with his own thoughts. He had close friends but hadn't really opened up to any of them.<br />
<br />
He knew he was adopted. Considering his mother was black, his father was asian and he was distinctly caucasian american looking, there had <br />
been no need for a conversation about it. His home life suited him very much, even if his energetic younger brother Benjamin drove him up the <br />
wall sometimes. Still, he had to wonder where he'd got his genes from.<br />
<br />
Ethan was still on his mind when he got home. His father was still at work, as usual, and his mother had taken his brother to judo. He wished at <br />
least somebody was home. Not that he wanted to discuss his problem -he'd never tell a soul-, but he'd have liked something to occupy his <br />
mind.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, he found a distraction on the doorstep in the form a parcel. It was addressed to him. Odd, as he hadn't ordered anything.<br />
It was the size and shape of a computer. The address had been typed onto a label and there were no stamps, suggesting somebody had just <br />
left it there. There were no features that could trace it back to its origin. Hunter decided not to let that bother him.<br />
<br />
He took it up to his room, set it on his bed and unwrapped it. It contained a large, metal briefcase. The sort that people in movies kept large <br />
amounts of money in. He clicked open the latches and lifted the lid.<br />
<br />
Inside was what appeared to be some sort of chemistry set. Set into foam in the base was a spring-loaded syringe and a device that looked like <br />
a miniaturized coffee maker. The rest of the space was taken up by row upon row of tiny, liquid-filled vials. They were organised into groups of <br />
three, each set labelled with its own unique code of letters and numbers. Without knowing the codes, there was no way of telling what was <br />
inside. Nestled on top was a folded leaf of paper. Typed on the front was Hunter's full name.<br />
<br />
Hunter unfurled the paper and discovered a series of diagrams indicating how to use the equipment. It showed how to load a vial into the <br />
syringe and depicted a featureless figure injecting himself in the arm. Beneath that was diagram of the other machine, which showed nothing <br />
more than where to put in the various ingredients, whatever they were.<br />
<br />
Clearly, this was some sort of portable drug farm and Hunter was instantly wary of being near it. It was incredibly sinister that a stranger had <br />
anonymously sent this to him and hadn't enclosed any information other than how to use it. The only reason Hunter could think of why anyone <br />
would ask him to inject an unknown substance into his body without telling him why was to take advantage of him. Perhaps to sedate him so <br />
they could rob him or perhaps just as a sick joke.<br />
<br />
But that made little sense. If somebody wanted to do that, there were far easier and more reliable ways. And why send him a whole briefcase of <br />
the stuff? There was enough substance in there for Hunter to keep using for weeks. Whoever had sent this not only expected him to use it, but <br />
to keep using it. Possibly he was trying to get Hunter hooked on something, but what was the point if he hadn't been paid?<br />
<br />
It was with great reluctance that Hunter decided that the only way to find out anything was to do as the instructions showed and wait for what <br />
happened. And so, feeling very smart and very stupid at the same time, Hunter picked up the syringe, selected a random vial, followed the <br />
instructions and fired it into his arm.</p>
