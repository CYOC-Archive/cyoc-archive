<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Paul shook off the deep sleep slowly- he was having a great dream about hooking fish out of a roaring river with his claws and then ripping the salmon apart with his fangs and savouring the cold, fresh, tasty meat as it slipped down his gullet and into his big belly; however he increasingly felt the pressure to urinate…. His dream bear self simply ignored it but his physical body’s needs finally pushed into his sleeping mind and Paul became awake. He lay there blinking trying to understand where he was.<br />
<br />
This was not the hotel room he’d booked on this island- his was plain white walls with ‘standard hotel features’; this room he was in was magnificent- all old oak panels, heavy drapes, and thick tapestries on the walls. A movement next to him shook him further awake- there was a man in the bed with him! Paul suddenly became aware of everything around him, all his senses kicking in at once, if not more so than he ever remembered before. He could hear the contented sleeping sounds the man was making, feel the soft breeze from an open window somewhere on his skin, he could smell the sea air. He was also very, very aware of the arm across his chest- it was enormous and covered in thick, thick hair the hand at the end could easily engulf his head! <br />
<br />
Paul reached out an arm to move the stranger’s limb when he became aware of the chest the arm was on- with a start Paul realised that it was his. Each pec was pumped up huge, each the size of his old chest. He couldn’t even see his nipples for all the mass and the deep thick black hair that covered him. He raised his arm and realised it was close to the size of the strangers. He flexed the bicep and his eyes popped at the seer size and mass of the muscle. He could win Mr. Olympia with these arms! Paul pushed himself up against the richly gilded headboard, the strangers arm sliding down onto his belly. Somehow he was disappointed he had a gut rather than rippling abs- but that was a solid gut and not some sloppy beer belly, and Paul realised that it felt perfect for his now enormous body. <br />
<br />
Lifting the sheet covering him Paul could only gape at the thickness of his legs and the size of his hairy feet. He was nude and in bed with another man but somehow it didn’t bother him as it should. He reached down a massive arm and grabbed the package he couldn’t see over his belly. As he suspected he was huge, his shaft must have been as large as his old erections where and it was soft. He let go as he felt it twitch- sure he was horny but he wanted the loo before he wanted a jerk off. Paul held the sheet up and took a good look at his sleeping partner. The stranger was lying on his back and Paul could see he was older and more hairy than him, the thick fur on him showing sliver and grey amongst the brown and black. The man’s body was taller and bigger than his too, the arms, chest, belly, and legs all swelled with mass and strength; his package promised massive loads of man juice. Paul realised he was drooling and sucked up the dangling spit. He shook his shaggy head, what was it that got him so hot for this man? He couldn’t explain it, up to now he’d never even looked at another man this way. Paul slipped himself out of bed and walked into the on-suite bathroom, amazed at the strength he felt in his body- he so wanted to run or wrestle or to screw something. He was so tall, so strong, and so hairy. Carefully and quietly he opened the door and was impressed that he could get his massive shoulders through the doorway without turning. <br />
<br />
After reliving himself Paul decided to take a quick shower. He went to shut the door and took another long look at the titan in the massive bed, he had rolled over and Paul could see the thick jawed, bearded very square face clearly. The face was marred slightly by a thick ridge above the deep set eyes, but the full thick beard and mass of long hair distracted Paul completely. He felt a shiver run through him and his cock began to twitch and rise. Running one of his massive paws over his balls sent the hair tingling and Paul quickly withdrew into the bathroom to relive the pressures he felt building in his groin under the shower. <br />
<br />
Feeling considerably better, Paul exited the shower to find the stranger sitting up in the bed, he was reading some papers but dropped the lot as Paul came into the room wearing only a towel. <br />
“Well you came out well” the stranger rumbled, his voice deep, rich and with a tone of authority.<br />
“What happened to me?” Paul said his own voice deep and rumbling. <br />
“The Island happened to you” The man said scratching at his chest. <br />
“Huh?” Paul said tiling his head. The massive man grinned at him showing off quite sharp canines. Paul couldn’t help but lick his lips (and discover his own teeth where quite large and sharp too) at the sight. <br />
“This Island is magical. It moves around the world of its own accord, it own mind. It changes a good number into animals, others into its servants, and some it lets go; you where to be a new Grizzly for the enclosure.”<br />
“What happened then?” Paul asked, terror creeping into his voice.<br />
“I did. I saw you had more potential working for me so I gave you the Baerenschnapps- it stopped you turning fully into a Bear” his grin got wider “well the animal kind anyway!” he chuckled. <br />
“But, but don’t I get a choice in this?” <br />
“No cub, you didn’t. Feel lucky you where grabbed by me, that your change was painless, that you still have your mind, and that you where picked to be a Bear and not one of the many donkeys we have all over the damm place.” There was a definite growl in the man’s voice and Paul took a step back. Suddenly he remembered the odd looking donkey he’d kicked on the way of the ferry.<br />
“But what happens to the people. Don’t families come looking for them and stuff” he felt very scared now.<br />
“Families do come looking but they usually receive letters saying their loved one has got a job here and most let it go at that. The most tenacious families often end up joining their loved one in whichever animal pen they ended up in.” he sighed “it’s the way the Island is. They ways it’s always been” he closed his eyes and rubbed his hair hand across them “all across the years” he whispered. <br />
“But why didn’t the barman stop me!” Paul cried suddenly.<br />
“Because he can’t cub, the men and women who work on this island are bound to certain behaviours. Most are people who have been spared by the Island from becoming animals but that risk is always there so they serve drinks, strip, wash the walls and whatever else is needed out of fear of the Islands power. Trust me there are worse fates than ending up a mindless animal.” <br />
“But why can’t they leave?”<br />
“No one leaves Pleasure Island unless the Island wants you too” <br />
“Oh.” Paul shook his shaggy head “this is all soo fucked up” he rumbled. “Why did you pick me?” he asked the stranger<br />
“How old are you cub?” <br />
“Me? I was 18 two days ago, this was a trip to celebrate!” Paul threw himself down in a nearby chair not noticing the heavy oak carving or the softness of the seat. <br />
“That was partly it- you have a good long life ahead of you yet, plus your change showed me that you would make a very strong man, a good addition to my workforce, and plus……”his voice dropped a little into huskier tones “I was lonely”<br />
“Lonely!” Paul exclaimed.<br />
“Yes lonely” the stranger said more edge and authority creeping into his voice “how old do you think I am?” <br />
“I dunno. 40-something?” Paul guessed. <br />
“Wrong. I am as old as this Island. I was here when the Gods first cast it adrift. I was here when Circe was in charge. I am over two thousand years old cub.” the man threw himself out of bed and walked over to where Paul was sitting, with each step he seemed to grow in size and magnificence, dominating the room with his seer presence and manliness. Paul looked up at him and found himself growing very hard and very horny. <br />
“I am in charge of security on this Island. I help keep the Islands wilder changes in check. Me and my workforce keep the visitors and ‘staff’ in line. We look after the changed, and yet in all that time and with all those people you are the first Bear transformation I got to watch, the first I had a chance to intervene in, the first chance I had of having a Bear partner.” He cupped Paul’s chin “now do you understand why you?”<br />
<br />
Paul could do nothing but star into the black eyes of the giant holding him. The towel was parted and pre-cum flowed down his shaft and onto his balls and legs. He could not move, could not breathe, he could only stare into those eyes. All his doubts about the stranger’s story vanished; all the years, all the people, places, and changes where reflected in those deep bottomless eyes.<br />
“I love you” Paul finally whispered. The older man leaned back and roared with laughter. He grabbed Paul and hauled him to his feet. <br />
“And I you!” he rumbled and then kissed him deeply, their hands flying all over their bodies, the passion and heat rising. Paul pushed himself away from his soul mate and asked<br />
“What now?” in a deep, husky voice that sent a shiver down the older mans body, he smiled and growled back <br />
“Well I guess we… “</p>
