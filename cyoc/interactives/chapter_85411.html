<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jeff has to squint his eyes as the world becomes brighter and brighter, until the very walls seem to be incandescent. His vision begins to swim and it takes him a moment to realize it&#39;s actually the world itself that seems to be shifting and undulating. He raises a hand to shield his eyes from the light, only to have them shoot open once he catches sight of it.<br />
<br />
The light burned his eyes but Jeff is focused solely on his hand, it&#39;s a womans hand, that was obvious enough, but what was more was that is was paler than anything he&#39;d ever seen. The kind of white that only comes right out of a paint tube. And incredibly smooth, like silk. Jeff looked at his other hand, equally as dainty and equally as white. He clasped his changing hands, lacing his delicate fingers together, running them over his palms and around his dainty wrists. His fingernails were gone, so were his fingerprints. Even his knuckles had smoothed over.<br />
<br />
Jeff felt a strange tightness in his smaller wrists and watched, mouth drooping open, as they seemed to swell, white and rounded, almost like bracelets. They seemed to mark the line where the radical tonal shift ended and as he traced the spot where the white growths met peachy skin he gasped and splayed his hands out in front of his face.<br />
<br />
Gloves.<br />
<br />
He was wearing gloves. Cartoon gloves.<br />
<br />
He could feel his heart hammering inside his chest. He turned his hands over, scarcely able to believe what was happening. His delicate hands were so perfectly white and smooth that he could scarcely tell which side he was looking at, front or back, but for the position of his thumbs. It was in all this turning that he lost two fingers.<br />
<br />
Jeff stopped, looking down at his hands. Now boasting only three fingers and a thumb each. He wiggled them, clenched them. They didn&#39;t feel any different.<br />
<br />
Distracted by his changing hands, he hardly had the time to notice his arms slimming, getting thinner and thinner, loosing all definition and colour, until the only way to tell his perfectly white arms from his perfectly white gloves were the puffy cuffs on his slim wrists. <br />
<br />
Jeff shivered and held himself, running his hands over his delicate arms, not noticing he could still somehow feel through the gloves, but only how amazingly smooth and supple his new skin felt. Again he thought strangely of paint: rubbing his arms felt exactly like dipping them into a bucket of paint.<br />
&quot;Not that crazy,&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;Paint. They used to use ink or paint for cartoons, back when they used animation cells.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m turning into a cartoon.&quot; He whispered, and felt his heart skip a beat.<br />
<br />
As if his changes were waiting for him to come to that exact realization they seemed to speed up! That bizarre sensation like being dipped in paint swept up his arms and over his shoulders and down his body. He felt his shoulders slip inwards, becoming incredibly narrow while his whole body seemed to slim and shrink. He could feel his butt moving against the chair as his whole body lost height and mass to match his arms. All the while he was running his gloved hands over himself, feeling his human skin smooth over into gloriously smooth white. <br />
<br />
His waist gave in, he could feel his skin becoming taut under his hungry fingers , becoming narrower and narrower far past the point where any human woman could survive. Then his hips started to splay outwards, it felt like he had a load of balloons in his pelvis that were slowly inflating, pushing his hips out further and further outwards and making his ass swell into the seat of his chair. It was only as his thighs began to fill out and press into his throbbing erection that he realized how horny he had gotten.<br />
<br />
Jeffs lifted his legs and wriggled out of his jeans and underwear, he glanced down his taut belly at his still very human penis, sandwiched between the featureless blank canvas of his supple thighs. With a trembling hand he reached down and wrapped delicate fingers around his length, gasping at the touch. His toon fingers were slightly cool to the touch, but they warmed almost instantly, and they were so impossibly smooth. He began to pump his small hand up and down his shaft, propping his feet up on the computer desk so he could watch the changes progress.<br />
<br />
The colourlessness had already reached all the way to the tips of his toes, and as he watched they seemed to clump together like wet paint. Oozing and running into each other as his feet began to swell, and swell and swell and swell. He pumped his cock faster and faster as he watched his feet swell into what looked like big, floppy white socks at the ends of his long, shapely legs. It was only when he was able to wiggle his three pudgy toes that he realized what was happening. They were rabbits feet.<br />
<br />
The realization only made him stroke himself faster.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned, a moan that, halfway through, jumped up in pitch like it had been fired out of a cannon. The sound that escaped his lips at the tail-end of that moan was something halfway between a flute and what happens when you rub two balloons together.<br />
<br />
Jeff clapped a hand over his mouth as he heard what came out of it, and could feel his lips swelling into his palm. He removed his hands and for a moment could actually see his bulbous lips before his vision was blocked by his nose as it bulged forwards into a petite muzzle. He let out a squeak and touched the new addition gingerly, feeling the gentle swell of his altered bridge, his smooth upper lip and his grossly inflated lower lip. his cheeks puffed out, ruffling slightly in the semblance of fur. He ran his hand through it, finding it as smooth and supple as the rest of his skin.<br />
<br />
Jeff moaned again, his squeaky falsetto this time interrupted by his two front teeth bulging out of his mouth and drooping into a rather exaggerated overbite. He gasped, the rhythm of his hand moving over his cock twitching. &quot;Oh gosh&quot; he breaths as he runs a hand through the velvet-soft fur of his cheek, then up through his hair as it starts to clump together into one moulded piece of brilliant yellow, defying gravity and arcing saucily over one eye.<br />
Jeff groaned and screwed his eyes shut as a massive pressure built in his head, it feels tighter and tighter to the point where, his own maleness forgotten, he has to bring both hands up to his temples in some attempt to relieve his discomfort.<br />
<br />
Finally, with a loud, comical &quot;POP&quot; two buoyant yellow pigtails burst from the sides of his head, accented by two brand new floppy bunny ears. Jeff gasps, feeling the new weight pulling at him, running a hand over the soft creases of his new ears, feeling the throb of his erection once again calling to be dealt with.<br />
<br />
In fact, his arousal seems to be building, billowing out of control like a fire, consuming his body from the tips of his toes to the points of his ears. He plunges a hand downwards, grabbing his cock and pumping it, never before has he wanted to cum so badly. All at once a powerful pulse seems to go through Jeff, a wave of pleasure so intense that he arches his back, feeling a weight shift on his chest.<br />
<br />
Shocked, he pulls his shirt up and lets out a small &quot;squeak&quot; of arousal at his two, pretty pink swollen nipples. With a shaking hand he moves to touch one when he&#39;s hit with another powerful burst of pleasure! Again he arches his back and this time he can see his chest balloon outwards into sizeable breasts. He moans and immediately latches onto one of his swollen nipples, crying out with the electric wave that crashes into him as he does so. He starts to tug at his teat in time with his hand jerking at his cock, another burst of tow-curling pleasure and another explosive growth-spurt. Now his breasts are easily more than a handful each, another and they&#39;re the size of basketballs.<br />
<br />
Jeff moans in wanton pleasure as he gropes his swelling tits, all the while, with each burst of pleasure his cock has become smaller and smaller, the skin between his swollen hips getting loose and puffy. Finally with a cry that would put any glassware shop out of business, Jeff slips her fingers into the sopping wet folds of her vagina and cums.</p>
