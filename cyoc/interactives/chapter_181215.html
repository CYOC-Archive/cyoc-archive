<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Room inspection sucked.<br />
<br />
Everyone hated you for doing it but the school required you to perform it. That was the situation Conner found himself in. Why had he applied for the position of floor manager? All it did was steal every other Saturday from him and force him to resolve spats and search for contraband. Everyone had something to hide in their rooms and they all believed he’d actually be a tattletale. He just wanted a break from it, that was all. For once he wanted an afternoon with a book that wasn’t interrupted by neighbour disputes and nonsense. He’d probably have a girlfriend by now if all the girls on his floor didn’t already hate him.<br />
<br />
He was almost done though, and then he could go back to stressing over exams, only one room left, and of course it was occupied by four girls. Time to be gored at for daring to approach their bras or whatever. He knocked and the door was swung open by what’s her face. She’d been in his math class but hadn’t shown up for a few Days, and she was wearing a really weird outfit to boot.<br />
<br />
“Um... I’m here for an inspection,” Conner explained while rubbing his Sandy blonde hair.<br />
<br />
“Perfect timing for tea,” the girl grinned before grabbing him and pulling him into the room.<br />
<br />
It was clean, that was for sure, but somehow a massive amount of space filled in the spot their tiny dorms went. There was a stairwell, a glass door leading to a greenhouse full of bizarre plants, a fire burning in a hearth, a wall separating an immense dining room from the kitchen, and a long hallway that the girl steered him down that ended in a delicate twin set of stairs that led up to a double door carved with trees.<br />
<br />
Inside was a set of chambers. A massive bathhouse with a pool of clear water pouring out of stone fountains into a basin about the size of a hot tub, an immense stairwell leading up to a giant bedroom with a tall roof and wide walls like it was the peak of a tower, and the room they were standing in which was lined with bookshelves, painting stands, and a table where the most beautiful girl in the entire world sat.<br />
<br />
Her hair was woven moonlight, freckles crossed her face in a beautiful and youthful glow, and when she smiled his dick stood at attention prepared to do anything she said.<br />
<br />
“Uh-buh,” he mumbled out while the maidservant sat him down across from her.<br />
<br />
“Ah, Sir Conner, how nice to see you again. I think you’ll find Frankie keeps our space rather up to snuff.<br />
<br />
“Buh-Buh,” was all he could muster while staring into her eyes.<br />
<br />
“Tell me, how have you been lately?” That angel asked and suddenly he had to answer her. That maidservant put a cup before him and poured in some tea that smelled just heavenly. She mixed in a couple drops of cream and some sugar before backing away and standing off to the side.<br />
<br />
He suddenly couldn’t stop himself and revealed just how stressful classes had been, how he was lonely, and that all he wanted to do was relax a little. After spewing out so much information his throat was dry so he reached for that cup of tea and took a quick sip.<br />
<br />
It was good, a full and sweet flavour with a little kick of bitterness. As he swallowed that first sip he brushed his suddenly longer hair from his eyes and continued.<br />
<br />
“I just want a girlfriend, you know? Someone to return to after a long day and just be with,” he sighed before taking another sip. This time his hair fell down to his back and began to weave itself into a gorgeous braid of Sandy blonde hair, taking on a new texture and shine that was so ladylike and fine.<br />
<br />
“I find a little confidence helps,” Janette replied with a smile. “It wasn’t long ago that I was simply off to the side pining after Mason?”<br />
<br />
“You?” Conner asked in shock. How could a goddess like Janette be nervous? She took another swig of her tea and with each blink of her eyes they shifted to a more dazzling brown colour, her eyebrows thinning and mascara clinging to her lengthening eyelashes.<br />
<br />
“Oh yes, you should chat with Donna, maybe she has a potion that can help you,” Janette suggested with her dazzling smile making Conner blush and sip more tea. When the cup left her lips they’d plumped out a little, losing blemishes and gaining colour. Her jaw shrank to match leaving her entire face womanly.<br />
<br />
“Father is always on my back about getting a girl,” Conner admitted with a sigh. “Him and my mother want grandkids. I feel like I’ve let them down.”<br />
<br />
He glumly sucked back another bit of tea, as it rushed down his throat his Adam’s apple shrunk and his neck slimmed down. When he cleared his throat his voice was dainty and Feminine.<br />
<br />
“Are your parents that desperate for heirs?” He asked.<br />
<br />
“Oh no, father was fifty three when I was born,” Janette explained while Conner swirled his tea with a spoon, his shoulders slinking inwards with the motion and his arms and hands getting smaller, daintier, and more ladylike. Fingernails became well kept and polished, colouring themselves a beautiful grey colour.<br />
<br />
“Hmmm...” Conner trailed while looking down at his appearance reflected in the light brown liquid. Her nose shrank as she stared.<br />
<br />
“Don’t believe the rumours about fertility,” Janette explained with a raised finger. “I know they say we should have children before we turn thirty but many women start their families in their thirties, even pst forty. We’re barely past twenty, we shouldn’t be worried about such nonsense.”<br />
<br />
Conner took a long swig of his tea and sighed. With the inhale his chest pulled in but with the exhale it bloomed into a gorgeous pair of breasts that shrank a little each time he inhaled and grew when he exhaled. Slowly they pressed outwards, stretching his shirt and making it lift upwards exposing his naval to the air. His gut pulled in and his waist moved inwards until he had a gorgeous hourglass figure.<br />
<br />
“But all my suitors are so empty,” Conner explained as his body hair retracted all over his body. He downed what was left of that tea and Frankie was upon him in seconds, pouring another glass and mixing it to perfection. “Why can’t father understand that I want to find my own man? I don’t want his preapproved men. I want someone with more dreams and goals than just marrying rich and enjoying that wealth. That’s why I went to school here. I want to be more than a pretty face.”<br />
<br />
As he spoke his legs slimmed down with his hips hurting outwards sexily and his thighs expanding with them, leaving a noticeable gap between his legs.<br />
<br />
“Have you spotted anyone yet?” Janette asked and Conner blushed, though it was more from his penis and testicles being sucked backwards into his body, his nether regions opening up with beautiful muscular folds ready to receive a penis. She dreamt of that moment, wanting to lose her virginity like so many around her. But she needed to find the right man first otherwise her father would force her hand to some dashing yet boring lordling.<br />
<br />
“There’s a man named Hector in my spells class,” Connie sighed dreamily as runes began to appear on her fingernails. As she thought of the handsome Latino man her clothes shifted, sizing to fit her and becoming a sweeping grey dress with one shoulder open and the other long. Magic runes tattooed down her open arm and up to her shoulder and she felt a powerful flow through her body. “Daddy wouldn’t approve though, I’m only here because I have magical potential, if I didn’t I’d be back home being courted. Once I graduate he’ll expect me back doing exactly what he wants.”<br />
<br />
“Go for Hector,” Janette suggested with a warm smile. “If your father has an issue with it I’ll just bless the relationship. If he dares defy his Princess he’ll be ousted as a lord and you’ll take his place. Then you can court whomever you want.”<br />
<br />
“You mean it?” Connie asked with a gasp and a giggle. “And what if Hector doesn’t work out.”<br />
<br />
“The world’s changing, your dad needs to get with the program, we’re not property anymore,” Janette replied with a dismissive wave of her hand. “Now, tell me about those roommates of yours.”<br />
<br />
“Oh my god, how did I wind up with three guys. They’re all in love with me and I know they slip into my room to steal my bras...” Connie explained with an exasperated sigh.</p>
