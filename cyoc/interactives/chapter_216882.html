<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Mike headed back to his dorm room expecting to see Jack there. He was a bit happy that his roommate wasn&#39;t. Even though it&#39;d been several hours since he&#39;d seen Jack, Mike was still stewing a bit over the comment that Jack said to him. He&#39;d always been a bit conscious of his weight, but hearing it directly from his friend meant so much more. <br />
<br />
He tossed his backpack on his bed and then went into the bathroom. However, a bright reddish orange color caught his eye. &quot;What the heck?&quot; he reached in and touched it. The moment his skin came into contact with the egg, his body stopped listening to him. His shorts dropped around his ankles and before he knew it the egg was pressing up against his backside. He wanted to scream or at least shot but his hand just kept pushing the object inside him.<br />
<br />
Even worse, he liked it. Feeling the oblong shape open him up as more of it pushed inside made his body writhe in pleasure. His XXL body twisted and turned as more and more of the object went inside. Mike winced and whined a little bit. The small amount of pain from an entrance never used before undercut the unbelievable amount of pleasure he was getting out of the experience. <br />
<br />
&quot;Holy shit...&quot; Mike muttered as he finally regained control over his body. &quot;What was that?&quot; Tingles continued to radiate off his skin. Thousands of little pin pricks were happening all as once. He looked down to see orange hair starting to sprout out of his skin. But around his hands it was a dark muddy brown. &quot;So weird...&quot; he giggled stupidly as he looked up to see the hair on his head was changing to the same burning orange color that was running up and down his arms.<br />
<br />
However, as he stood up he couldn&#39;t help but notice just how large his shirt looked on his body. Even though it had always been fairly small and wrapped tightly around his shoulders, arms and torso, he couldn&#39;t help but notice just how big it was on him. He lifted it up to see his large rotund belly shrinking right before his eyes. Then there was that same brown and orange fur that coated his arms and legs also filled out his tummy.<br />
<br />
Mike&#39;s hands pressed against the shrinking fatty belly and shook it. It didn&#39;t wobble nearly as much as it had. A giddy smile filled his face as he stumbled back into the dorm. &quot;So weird...&quot; Mike muttered as he plopped down onto the bed. His thoughts were fazing in and out as stared at his ceiling. One of his hands ran through the hair on his belly while the other played with his cock.<br />
<br />
&quot;Small...&quot; another giggle escaped Mike as he played with his average sized cock. In his touch the rod started to shrink ever so slightly. Though, that&#39;s not what he meant. He just kept thinking about how he wanted to be small. Smaller than even Jack. His hand moved faster up and down his shaft. Each thought of being smaller met with another shot of joy through his system. His body reacted on the thoughts. Slowly every part of him started compacting. Just a tiny bit. He&#39;d lost a couple of inches in his height dropping him just under 6&#39;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God yes!&quot; Mike cried out in the empty room as his back arched. His cock unloaded onto his orange furred belly. &quot;So good. So small...&quot; he continued to twist and turn in his bed as his thoughts continued thinking about being small.<br />
<br />
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br />
&quot;Woah...&quot; Jack wobbled as he felt a strange sensation overcome him. <br />
<br />
Steven was quick to reach down and hold him upright. He felt it as well. A smirk filled his face as his muscles throbbed. Each one was growing another couple of percent bigger. It would be unnoticeable to most, but all that mattered was that he could feel it. He could feel the strength building up inside his body and he wanted to let it all out. Right now he couldn&#39;t do that.<br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Steven asked, feigning his ignorance.<br />
<br />
Jack leaned into the strong jock&#39;s embrace. &quot;I don&#39;t know... I feel funny...&quot; he muttered. With each step, Jack staggered just a little bit more. Part of it was the airy feeling in his head. The other part was that his shoes were several sizes too small for him now. He scratched at his chest as thick brindle fur started to fill in where none had been.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let&#39;s get you back to my dorm and then we can talk about it more. Alright?&quot; Steven said.</p>
