<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">She phoned up jennifer, she expected she would probably just hang up but she actually answered, What is it you freak ? im in the middle of practice! she sounded pretty angry by the interuption but Kylie, still thinking out her new name spoke back in a soft, calm tone, Hello Jennifer, Jennifer didn say anything back for a few seconds, Who is this ? Kylie, formerly kyle, you know me, jennifer almost dropped the phone, she was barely able to talk, i mean she knew what she said but she never thought it would actually work, this is just....she had no words.<br />
Jennifer ? Are you there ? Y-yeah...i was just like...it worked ?! her voiced went back to normal, seems like it kylie said with a cheery voice, i know you and the girls are having your training session but i would love to talk to you, you owe me this dont you think ? jennifer stammered i...i like...i guess this is not joke right ? i promise if you are messing with me im going to make your life hell! i&#39;m not joking jennifer, met me in the locker in 10 minutes okay ? kylie hung up and walked outside, her dress gently swayed in the simple breeze and smiled, her hair waving side to side as she walked to the school area, several people stared at her on her way over but she just simply kept on walking, perfecting walking on high heels even before she had put them, she felt amazing and finally reached the school, she walked inside and headed over to the ladies locker room, it was nothing special, just lockers and showers really, but she seemed to remember being her before strangely enough, she sat down on the bench and looked around the room, the lockers looked all in order, some were a bit damaged but they looked decent, the shower area was decently large, it had about 8 shower heads mounted to the wall, she got up and touched the damaged locker as it started to crank and seemingly fixing itself, kylie smiled and sat back down as the handlebars on the door flew open and an angry looking jennifer stormed in wearing her cheer-uniform and a ponytail as soon as she saw the woman sitting on the bench her expression changed, she almost backed out of the room but felt compelled to stay, Kylie stod up as the door locked behind jessica as she quickly turned around and tried to leave. <br />
I wont harm you jennifer, relax kylie said in her calm voice, jennifer still looking at the door slowly turned around to look at kylie, she was still wearing the bright white dress which stod out quite a bit jennifer looked at kylie and kylie looked back at jennifer<br />
she opened her mouth, Kyl-..before she could continue her words shifted she looked at her, D-Diana ? Kylie smiled, Diana it is then jennifer. Jennifer looked confused but just nodded slowly, so...you wanted to talk ? oh, right, i wanted you to see the results of your actions, this permanent and the curse is broken thanks to you jennifer.<br />
Jennifer shrugged, you just came here to say that ? Diana shook her head, i wanted to talk to you jennifer, so please sit down okay ? jennifer reluctantly sat down on the bench as it started to bend and wave so it it got some back support and turned more comfortably to sit on. holy Sh-....! what happened ? calm down jennifer, just sit back down okay ? <br />
Jennifer pouted and sat back down on the bench and crossed her legs, so...the...it worked ? youre really kyle ? Diana nods slowly, i was kyle but not anymore, thanks to you jennifer im now a Goddess and all that implies..i am not quite sure what my role is yet but i am hoping i will find out soon.<br />
jennifer nods slowly, so...jennifer looks over at Diana, i like the dress.... Diana giggles to herself, thank you, i was looking in my mothers wardrobe for some clothes that could fit but found nothing so this dress just sorta appeared around me. Jennifer looks at her, your mothers wardrobe ? oh my god, that is stupid, Diana shrugs i change then, she gets up from the bench and closes her eyes as the dress splits in the middle, the skirt slowly moves up her legs and stops right around her ankles, it goes from white to black pencil skirt and her shirt turns into a white blouse.<br />
Jennifer gets up from the bench again and just gasps, you did that ? like changed clothes just like that ? is that like some kinda magic powers you got or something ? Diana nods slowly, you did say a goddess so i guess the powers of the curse was absorbed into me so i know magic and such i guess, im not quite sure.<br />
Jennifer looks at her, you owe, like you owe me alot! this is all thanks to me! Diana looks up at her, you turned me into this to spite me, not my fault i quite like being a woman so far, Ugh, stop saying that, thats so weird! you&#39;re like...This super nerdy ugly guy not this....Jennifer sighs and looks over at Diana, can we talk someplace else ? this locker is really not getting me, Okay, where then ? Jennifer shrugs, my home ? my mom is working super late so im home alone for a time, Diana nods, want to say that to your friends then ? naw...i just tell them i got sick or something...<br />
<br />
They both head home to jennifer&#39;s house, her house is more of a mansion really, it looks like its been recently painted since there are a few spots that look unpainted, the house itself is white, 3 floors, a huge swimming pool and other necesities, they head to the garden and sit down next to the pool. <br />
Your house is beautiful Jennifer, Jennifer nods slowly, i guess it is...an akward silence hangs in the air as they both just sorta look at each other, okay! this is freaking me out, you look like my mom, i cant do this!<br />
Diana sighs, i could change my apperance maybe ? jennifer shrugs, fine, just look more normal, Diana closes her eyes and the white smoke envelops her whole body, once it disapates she looks like she is around 20 years old, her hair is long and black, her cup size has grown to a D, she is wearing a open leather jacket with a black top under it and a pair of jeans, Better ? Jennifer looks over and sighs, thats so unfair! but fine, look, you owe me Diana, its all thanks to me youre like that now, its toally unfair.<br />
<br />
I am sorry if you feel that way jennifer but i dont really owe you anything, if anything, this was you reedeming yourself for treating me that bad for years, jennifer says nothing and throws a small stone in the pool, Diana gets up and turns back to her normal self again, her long blonde hair waving in the wind, are you jealous ? she looks up at her, who wouldnt be!? look at you, youre like...perfect now! you look better than most models and youre just perfect and and and! jennifer starts sobbing as diana walks over and hugs her, a warm feeling of comfort envelops jennifer and she hugs her back, jennifer calms down and smiles.<br />
<br />
A couple of hours pass and Jennifer and Diana spends the time togheter talking about school, jennifers personal life and such, Diana cant really say much about herself but jennifer gets the feeling what she says is genuine.<br />
<br />
Hey Diana ? why dont you join our cheer squad ? im sure the girls would love you and you&#39;re a girl now, Im not sure, i dont know anything about cheering....its easy, i&#39;ll teach you the basics okay ? I&#39;ll think about it okay ? jennifer smiles, do you need to go home ? Diana nods, its late, see you then jennifer hugs her as diana walks out from the house and starts heading back home</p>
