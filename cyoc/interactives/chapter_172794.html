<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One moment, Riley was window shopping, wondering if she&#39;d look good in a light pink sundress.  The moment, the pretty blonde realized she had suddenly grown taller, and she could hear gasps of shock and surprise.  Looking down, she saw her legs had been replaced by a slender pair of animal legs- looking to her right, she saw a long body extending out from behind her.<br />
<br />
Filled with shame at suddenly becoming a freak, she dashed away, her fallen skirt, panties, and sandals forgotten.  She had to get away, find a place where no one would look at her!<br />
<br />
There were tears in her eyes when a tall young woman threw her arms around the girl&#39;s tiny waist, pleading with her to calm down.  The woman was a security guard (and Riley was struck not only by her athletic beauty, but the honesty and innocence she saw in her green eyes).  Riley had long felt attraction to both girls and boys alike, but she&#39;d never given much thought, or acted on her feelings towards the other members of her sex.  <br />
<br />
As the woman led her to an EMT, Riley felt sad when the guard returned to her job, trying to get the chaos in the shopping center under control  Impulsively, she bounded up to the guard and kissed her on the cheek, her pink lipstick leaving a mark on the surprised young woman&#39;s face.<br />
<br />
Since then, Riley had learned she had been affected by Sudden Transformation Syndrome, or STS.  Several others had been affected as well at about the same time, for reasons unknown.  From the waist down, she had become a young doe.  It...wasn&#39;t the worst thing that could happen, though she lamented her lost humanity.  Even though her status was protected by the 28th and 29th Amendments, she knew that she would suffer from discrimination for the rest of her life.<br />
<br />
She cried a bit, feeling sorry for herself, when her father arrived.  Theo Colt was a wealthy lawyer, and he carefully schooled his reaction to his daughter&#39;s upper torso mounted atop the body of a deer.  She needed his love and acceptance now, and anything that looked like rejection (or worse, revulsion) would be horribly damaging to his daughter.  Ever since his wife had died, Riley had become the center of his world- he&#39;d rather slit his own throat than hurt her.<br />
<br />
After having her checked out by a specialist, he brought the girl home.  She would need extensive therapy, and he decided to take some time off of work- as a senior partner of a law firm, they could do without him for a little while, at least.<br />
<br />
Riley couldn&#39;t bear to go back to school- the fifteen year-old was filled with dread when she thought about the stares of her fellow students.  A pretty and bright girl, she was actually well liked, but that was when she was human.  What would even her closest friends say now?<br />
<br />
As much as she wanted to mope, however, her new body was full of energy, and she found herself bounding about her back yard.  The nimbleness and agility she now possessed thrilled her, and it made her feel better about her situation.  Still, she thought about that security guard.<br />
<br />
The kiss had been brief, but she found herself wishing she&#39;d done more.  She tried to push those thoughts from her mind- she didn&#39;t really know the woman, even if she&#39;d seemed kind.  But the fact that she&#39;d been kind, been supportive, and had looked at her with acceptance- how many people like her could there be in this cruel world?<br />
<br />
How many people could look at her and see not a mutant, but someone who needed help...and love?  She sighed.  She found herself doing that a lot.  It wouldn&#39;t do to have a crush on anyone right now.  Romance was impossible- to love her, would be something like bestiality, at least in her mind.<br />
<br />
She begged her father to put in a good word for the guard though.  If not for her intervention, Riley didn&#39;t know what she would have done in her panicked state.  Maybe the woman would get a raise or something- she hoped her Dad would give her some kind of reward, but Riley wasn&#39;t going to press the issue.<br />
<br />
She was going to get money from the government, maybe she could do it herself one day.<br />
<br />
It was a week later, and Riley still hadn&#39;t left her property.  She was outside in the early morning, getting some exercise in, wearing her favorite wool sweater, when a strange woman simply appeared in front of her.  The woman ..no, girl...was only a bit older than Riley, but she was tall, and was absolutely gorgeous, with a beautiful mane of long, chestnut hair.  Her height and figure reminded Riley of her savior, Cole, but she had wider hips and a larger bust.<br />
<br />
The woman waved.  &quot;I wish you&#39;d listen to what I have to say.&quot;<br />
<br />
Despite the doe&#39;s instincts she&#39;d inherited urging her to flee, she remained calm.  The woman explained her name was Teri, and she&#39;d been the one to change Riley, thanks to a magic ring.  She regretted her impulsive action, and begged for forgiveness.  &quot;I can fix this, I swear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley considered that.  She should be angry, but she was actually intrigued.  &quot;I&#39;m still afraid of how people will see me, but honestly, I like my new body.  But who could love me like this?  I&#39;m an animal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You are not, Riley.  And I can help with that.&quot;  With that, she changed before Riley&#39;s astonished eyes, into a majestic centaur filly.  &quot;If you want, I can give you the ability to change back to human whenever you want.  And...maybe something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Riley had noticed that Teri had a modified pair of panties around her front- the blending of girl and horse didn&#39;t actually begin until below the hips, and Teri explained she still had a human vagina...and another one on her equine half.<br />
<br />
Riley couldn&#39;t help but giggle naughtily at the idea of having not one, but two pussies, and she agreed to Teri&#39;s solution.  Daddy&#39;s eyes bugged out when he got home to find his daughter was once again entirely human.  She explained she had discovered she could change back (not entirely a lie) which satisfied him, even though his litigator&#39;s instincts were telling him there was more to this than she was telling.<br />
<br />
Of course, she needed to wear custom tailored underwear in order to be able to shift between forms without incident, and she took to wearing a frilly, skirt-like garment around her waist.  To her surprise, when she returned to school, everyone was very friendly and supportive, and she became more popular than ever.<br />
<br />
She also was happy to find herself attracting the attention of boys and girls alike.  In short, life was good.<br />
<br />
Then...</p>
