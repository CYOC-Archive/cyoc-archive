<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Waiting for Officer Barnes to recover from being shot was a very patient affair. It appeared that he was making good progress in recovery, but everything that we had been told indicated that he would need a month, at least, to let his insides heal and to rebuild his strength in his abdomen. So far, it had only been a few weeks since he was released from the hospital in Kalispell.<br />
<br />
&quot;You sure you won't get in trouble visiting me while you're on duty?&quot; Officer Barnes asked as his brother Joey lead me into his room.<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes was already regaining some strength and wasn't seeming to have any trouble with his chest being uncomfortable anymore. I guessed that was from the surgical scars on his chest and abdomen healing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Things have been fairly quiet since Beauregard's been put away,&quot; I told him, &quot;so long as I don't stay too long and nothing comes up, we should be fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Officer Barnes slowly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how are things going?&quot; I asked, &quot;You okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I'm doing alright,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;the therapist has done a great job of massaging the scar... I doubt you'll be able to feel it once I'm good to go.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Therapist?&quot; I wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's either a physical therapist or occupational therapist, I can never remember which specific title they use,&quot; Officer Barnes managed a shrug, &quot;but the job he has is to help me recover.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's a he?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't laugh,&quot; Officer Barnes answered.<br />
<br />
I raised up my paws in a sort calming type motion.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm not,&quot; I told him, &quot;Honest. How's the strengthening coming along?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly good,&quot; Officer Barnes answered, &quot;they don't expect me to be ready to go back to work for a couple of weeks yet, but they think I'm making good progress. I don't need the pulley quite as much any more... though I'm still a little shaky when it comes to sitting up... but I'm making good progress.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good to hear,&quot; I answered, &quot;everyone at the station will be glad to hear that.&quot;<br />
<br />
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
After my visit with Officer Barnes, I returned to my patrol. Things had remained rather quiet so far, and I hadn't been called to any sort of scene. As I was nearing the end of the patrol and was preparing to return to the station, the walkie-talkie came to life.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Wayne, are you receiving me, over?&quot; came the dispatch officer's voice over the walkie-talkie's frequency.<br />
<br />
&quot;Load and clear,&quot; I answered as I pulled out the device, &quot;What's up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Chief wants to know what your status is,&quot; the dispatch officer replied, &quot;how are things going?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I've had no trouble,&quot; I answered, &quot;I'm pretty close to finishing up this patrol and heading back. Is something up?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think so,&quot; the dispatch officer replied, &quot;although it would be advisable that you return as soon as you can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Roger,&quot; I nodded and set the walkie talkie back in by front pocket.<br />
<br />
I then made my way straight back to the station. I had a strange mix of curiosity and fear as I made my way in, as the talk with the dispatch officer seemed to indicate that I was wanted back at the station. This could either mean I was in trouble, or something else had come up, and there was some &quot;special&quot; assignment for me. The desk officer looked up from the main desk as I came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Officer Howard is in his office,&quot; the desk officer told me, &quot;he's expecting you.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and continued on my way.<br />
<br />
&quot;You wished to see me, sir?&quot; I asked when I made to Officer Howard's office.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; Officer Howard looked up from one of his files, &quot;come in, Officer Wayne.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and entered, quietly shutting the door behind me.<br />
<br />
&quot;I got a bit of a special request for you this morning,&quot; Officer Howard said with half a chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;For me, sir?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Officer Howard nodded, &quot;as I'm sure you remember, Beauregard's property, animals, and buildings were all taken over by the state of Montana and the city of Columbia Falls as part of his sentence, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it turns out the state auctioneer was out there yesterday and looked everything over,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;he says the auction is doable... but because of the SIZE of the property, he's a little concerned on various safety issues related to the auction. So, he's asked for your presence at the auction... to make sure things stay stable and orderly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He wants me to maintain order at an auction?&quot; I asked.<br />
<br />
Officer Howard nodded, &quot;normally it isn't necessary, as the auctioneer has a controlled set up already, and will only need to call us if something gets out of hand... or as was the case with the Smiths, the property isn't too big and the auctioneer can control it like a normal auction... but Beauregard's property is different. It's bigger and the auctioneer actually expects a fairly big crowd. So they're asking for you to provide them with some security.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; I answered, &quot;when do they plan to do this?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In about a week from today,&quot; Officer Howard answered, &quot;the auctioneer wants to be able to advertise the auction before they actually go through with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be ready, then, sir,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
It was a relatively quiet evening when I returned to Bandhavgarh Cabin. Molly was already home and was actually starting dinner when I came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that you, George?&quot; she called from the kitchen as I shut the door.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, it's me,&quot; I answered, &quot;how are you? Did you have a good day?&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly then appeared in the doorway between the dinning room and the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;My day was about the same as always,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;used as a jungle gym and hugged several times over... perfect future motherhood training for we we... you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
I slowly approached her and nuzzled her muzzle with my own, &quot;for when we can start our family... I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How did your day go?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly quiet,&quot; I told her, &quot;nothing much is going on.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Any more former R.A.M. members approach you with odd questions?&quot; Molly half teased, reminding me of my meeting with Madeline Hershey a few days before.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, none of that,&quot; I answered, &quot;the only &quot;thing&quot; that has come up is that they want me to provide some extra security for the auction of Beauregard's property and things... that which can't be given to family members and personal friends, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me get out of my uniform and into something more comfortable and I'll help you with dinner,&quot; I volunteered.<br />
<br />
&quot;You could strip and go naked,&quot; Molly smirked, &quot;I wouldn't mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
I shook my head as the tone of Molly's voice indicated she was joking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, YOU wouldn't,&quot; I shook my head, making her giggle.<br />
<br />
I then calmly made my way upstairs to get changed. Once I made it there though, the phone rang and I was distracted for a little bit by the phone call. But, it turned out to be a pleasant distraction, as the caller was none other then my dad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, dad, how's it going?&quot; I spoke after he spoke his greeting.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty well, son,&quot; Jacob Wayne answered on the other line, &quot;we finally got the reports on Beauregard's trial here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think a lot of that made national news because of its clash of &quot;animal-people versus humanity&quot; imagery,&quot; I told him.<br />
<br />
&quot;True, but I've been busy here and your mother has been busy with her work and her social get togethers,&quot; Jacob Wayne replied, &quot;I only just got the report as part of the government's final report on gang's deal to cooperate.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded, though I doubted my father could see that, &quot;I'm sure. What was the deal they worked out anyway?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They ended up settling on a ten year sentence in a maximum security prison for each officer killed during the attack, for a total of forty years,&quot; Jacob Wayne responded, &quot;which brought it down from the potential life sentence the judges wanted to give them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure, but it seemed to me that those three really didn't want to do what they did,&quot; I told him, &quot;they only did it because Beauregard offered to pay them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can guess that's why they cooperated,&quot; Jacob Wayne replied, &quot;I still can't believe that man would do all that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some people are just nuts,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; my father chuckled back, &quot;anyway, I'm calling to tell you that you did well, son. I don't think I've ever known any rookie officer that has gone through as much as you in such a short amount of time.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess being turned into an animal does that,&quot; I replied calmly.<br />
<br />
His laugh was a little more uneasy. Like he didn't know if he would insult Molly and I by laughing. It didn't bother me, so I let it go.<br />
<br />
&quot;All the same, you did well,&quot; Jacob Wayne answered, &quot;you've done well, and congratulations on a job well done.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; I responded.<br />
<br />
&quot;And George?&quot; my father then asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No matter what that freak show did to you and Molly, you will always be your mother's and my son and we will live you and Molly as loving parents for the rest of our lives,&quot; Jacob Wayne spoke and I could almost &quot;feel&quot; him smiling at me, &quot;you've both done well together...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks, dad,&quot; I replied softly with slight smile.</p>
