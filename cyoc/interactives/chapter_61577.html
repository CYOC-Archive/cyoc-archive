<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Without an ounce of fat on his body he no longer had any sort of buoyancy to keep him afloat. His muscles, as <br />
big as they were couldn't keep his body moving enough to swim.<br />
<br />
He looked at himself in the mirror. I'm a freak. Marco said to himself.<br />
<br />
Marco hadn't seen the rather rotund man come up behind him when he slipped his arms around Marco's waist and <br />
said this is a good body for competition body building. Marco turned so quickly that the man behind him almost <br />
fell over when Marco's rock hard abs hit the jelly filled belly of the man behind him.<br />
<br />
Who the hell are you.<br />
<br />
I use to have a body like yours. I worked out every day and was one of the best body builders ever. I could <br />
help you get into body building. The man said knowing he had other plans.<br />
<br />
I just want to be a swimmer. I can't swim with this body.<br />
<br />
You can earn a great living and possibly even be in the Olympics with that body. That got Marco to thinking. <br />
The Olympics? He never even thought about doing that in swimming.<br />
<br />
I got to go. Marco said putting on some very tight sweat pants from his coach's office. Damn he was a skinny <br />
thing Marco said trying to pull the pants up.<br />
<br />
Here just think about it the man said to Marco, slipping him a business card with his name and a phone number <br />
on it. It said Anthony Baird.<br />
<br />
I don't need this I don't want to be a body builder.<br />
<br />
Just think about it.<br />
<br />
Marco left and stuck the card in the waist band of his sweats. When he got home he found that he needed a full <br />
new wardrobe and all that fit him were 6xl shirts. It wasn't what he needed around the waist but his shoulders <br />
wouldn't fit anything else. And his pants were just those colorful sweats that body builders wore. Marco would <br />
cry himself to sleep every night as he got more and more use to his new body.<br />
<br />
It took almost 6 months before he started to get use to his body and when he happened upon the card again it <br />
took him another couple months before he would call that man.<br />
<br />
Looking just as good there Anthony said. Looks like you have been working out even more. Although he hadn't <br />
had a muscle spurt like he had in the pool he was bigger which was surprising to him since he hadn't worked <br />
out a bit in the last 6 months.<br />
<br />
Well first off we need to get some stats on you.<br />
<br />
Height: 6' even<br />
Weight: 380 pounds<br />
Shoulders: 80&quot;<br />
Biceps: 32&quot;<br />
Waist: 30&quot;<br />
Thighs: 32&quot;<br />
<br />
He took out the calipers and couldn't get a reading on body fat.<br />
<br />
Ok there is one more thing that we need to do to be sure on the body fat. We put you in a tub of water you <br />
have to go fully under water and we will get the reading.<br />
<br />
Marco got naked and then climbed into the tub and sat there waiting for Anthony to tell him to go under.<br />
<br />
Anthony sat at a chair looking into a screen. Ok When I tell you to go, slip under the water and exhale all <br />
your air. This will give us the best reading.<br />
<br />
As he prepared the computer he said ok one, two, three go.<br />
<br />
Marco slipped under the water and exhaled. When he felt a jolt of electricity go through his body his head <br />
became groggy.<br />
<br />
Wake up boy he heard someone telling him. As Marco opened his eyes he looked at the person telling him to wake <br />
up. It was him. Marco was looking into the face he had grown to know the last six months.<br />
<br />
What the hell did you do?<br />
<br />
Look boy you wouldn't ever be able to get proper use out of this body of yours and I know how to use it.<br />
<br />
That was when Marco realized that if Anthony had his body Marco must have Anthony's body. He looked down at <br />
himself noticing the large mound sitting between his legs. I'm huge.<br />
<br />
Yea and the life I've lived you aren't going to be able to change that body. So enjoy.<br />
<br />
Marco's mind snapped. Anthony sold Marco to a Mexican brothel that specialized in chubby American men being <br />
used by men of the world. Marco would start into his rant about having his body switched but everyone just <br />
thought there was something wrong with him. The brothel kept him fat. More cushion for the pushin because the <br />
clientel liked their boys big. And he got use to being used.<br />
<br />
As for Anthony he made quite a name for himself in the body building industry. Ty had seen him several times, <br />
not knowing that someone had switched bodies with his creation.</p>
