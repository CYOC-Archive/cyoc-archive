<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You lean forward, looking down at her bawling little head, and say...<br />
<br />
~You are one-hundred-percent, absolutely content with being incontinent. You are not in any way bothered by wearing and using diapers, by never using a toilet again, and by being changed by other people including me~<br />
<br />
About 20 seconds elapses for Madison to realize that she no longer cares, and for her bawling to reseed back into sniffing.<br />
&quot;I mean... I guess it&#39;s *sniff* okay...&quot; She bites her lip, looking at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mhm?&quot; You smile cockily, putting a hand on her head. &quot;That&#39;s because I just mind-controlled you to not feel bad about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh...&quot; She looks down. &quot;...you&#39;re weird and dumb, and gross.&quot; She mumbles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Right!&quot; You pat her thigh. &quot;Let&#39;s get your diaper changed.&quot; You stand up and take her hand.<br />
<br />
You guide her to the clear space of her carpet and lay her on her back. The mess descends from higher up the bottom to further down into her diaper, causing her to wince a little bit as these are new sensations she hasn&#39;t felt since she was two, but ultimately not perturbed by it on account of the mental override you inflicted upon her.<br />
<br />
In the bathroom, you select a collection of the softest rags on her shelf, and soak them in warm water. You grab the bathroom trash can, and take all of these supplies back to Madison, where you kneel down at her feet. You put your hands against her lower-inner-thighs, and push outward to spread her legs.<br />
You press the four fingers of your right hand against the front of her diaper, to allocate the pressure in such a way that you can more effectively remove the tapes. You put the index finger and thumb of your left hand around the bottom-left (<i>your</i> left, not Madison&#39;s) tape of Madison&#39;s diaper, and pull backwards in order to remove it. A quick, sharp rip noise is made. Your hand moves a few inches up the diaper in order to do the same with the other tape. This causes the left-side elastic band of the diaper to descend to the floor. One could now see Madison&#39;s exposed thigh with nothing covering it.<br />
<br />
You deftly switched the operations of your hands. Now your <i>left</i> was pressed against the front of her diaper, and your <i>right</i> pinched the right-sided tapes and removed them. Holding the diaper down was especially important this time; if you had tugged at the right-sided tapes while the left-sided tapes were undone, the entire front of diaper would have been tugged along with the tapes. Holding the diaper&#39;s front down ensured a quick, efficient removal of all four tapes.<br />
With both sides of Madison&#39;s thighs visible, and the diaper coming loose as it no longer had the tapes holding it together, tiny glimpses of the mess were becoming noticeable.<br />
<br />
As your hand moves toward the topmost area of the diaper, Madison finds herself unable to look away from what you&#39;re doing. Despite having already become okay with this operation, it is still something that is very new to her. Or rather, every time it had happened before, she can&#39;t remember.<br />
Madison winces a bit from the cold air as you grab the top of the diaper and unfold it. This exposes the contents of Madison&#39;s diaper; most notably the business that she had done in it about ten minutes ago. The mess has been squished around a bit from all the desperate body movements when she had been crying, and from standing up, walking and laying down in order to assume the position she&#39;s currently in. Comparatively speaking, however, this mess was not a very big deal. It is surely unimpressive to the soilings that Madison is going to make for herself in the future.<br />
That said, you aren&#39;t using a changing pad. Any mistakes made would be costly. So you diligently grab the biggest rag from the stack, stretch it out against the five digits of your left hand, and plop it down right over the center of Madison&#39;s diaper area.<br />
<br />
You arch your index finger, middle finger and thumb together, creating a clasp, which you press into Madison&#39;s anatomy which scoops up a huge percentage of her product. You fold the rag over and repeat the process. You don&#39;t feel like taking the risk of doing it a third time, so you then throw the rag into the trash and grab another.<br />
The bulk of the mess now removed, this second rag is dedicated to the more general task of obtaining various mid-size clumps. It&#39;s not as big or thick of a rag, so it has to be retired as soon as this job is complete. In total; it tackled the area above and to the sides of Madison&#39;s privates, and around the curves of her legs and visible area of her buttocks.<br />
You take a third rag, this one to be applied to Madison&#39;s most intimate body part. You employ a technique of the fingers to thoroughly wipe this area, the description of which will be omitted from this writing.<br />
<br />
You take hold of the fourth rag, and Madison is made to lift her body up a few inches so that you can wipe all around the other assorted corners of her body which may have been affected. The wiping completed, you place a fresh, clean diaper underneath the dirty one; pull the dirty one away; ball it up and throw it into the trash. Now what you need to do is position Madison up with the new diaper.<br />
Her right buttock is a bit too low relative to the diaper, so you give the right side of the diaper a tug.<br />
The diaper isn&#39;t aligned straight relative to her body, so you put your hands against her inner-thighs again, to orient her until it&#39;s just right.<br />
<br />
You grab the topmost hem of the diaper, pull on it firmly and fold it down over Madison&#39;s body. The girl who had just a moment ago been completely exposed--to the effect that anyone who stepped into the room could immediately see her effectively naked if it weren&#39;t for her shirt--was now given back the lion&#39;s share of her dignity in the form of the front-padding area of a diaper. The sides of her legs were still plainly visible to anyone willing to look,  but this was a significant improvement over mere seconds ago, when her genitals were on display.<br />
You then perform the inverse operation to Madison&#39;s new diaper as you had done to her old; pressing your hand down in the middle to hold it in place while you reached over, stretched out and carefully place the tapes. Once all four tapings were completed, Madison was officially wearing a disposable, store-bought, plain-white youth diaper.<br />
<br />
In regards to Madison&#39;s personal dignity, the application of the diaper&#39;s tapes have covered up more of her body. If one were to see her wearing this diaper, they wouldn&#39;t be able to see any more than they could if she were wearing high-cut panties. Significantly less, in fact. One addition advantage to a diaper is that it masks the shape of the anatomy underneath it. If someone were to see Madison wearing panties, they would be able to discern roughly what she would look like if she were completely naked, because the underwear would be snugly wrapping around her skin. With a diaper, however, one would have a hard time even discerning Madison&#39;s gender, if they were not able to see her face or hair.<br />
<br />
Madison rises to her feet and takes a breath. She is now wearing her second diaper. The feeling of just standing up, with her legs spaced slight apart, is so different to how she is accustomed. Now there is a subtle weight around her bottom. It&#39;s very warm. It makes her feel a little boxed in. When she walks, the crinkly plastic of the diaper gently chafes her inner thighs; the movements of her body causes shifts in the diaper that rub faintly against her privates. All of this is something that she would have to take a long time to get used to, if it weren&#39;t for her mental override making it already happen.<br />
<br />
The fact alone that she is wearing a diaper carries with it a set of implications; built into the wearing of this garment are an assumption of things that will eventually happen. At some point, Madison&#39;s bladder will relax itself against her will, causing a deposit of urine to travel through her urethra and out of her opening, all without her knowledge or consent. The same will also at some point happen with her bowels. The absorbent polymers piled together in Madison&#39;s diaper have an inevitable future; one in which Madison uncontrollably relieves herself and soaks them up. The air-tight elastics in her diaper--especially in the back--have a similar future, in which Madison will most likely evacuate a piece of her bodily waste, which the bands and elastics of the diaper will attempt to contain.<br />
<br />
Various individuals are also wearing the exact same brand and size of diaper that Madison is wearing right now. Some children, around Madison&#39;s age are wearing this diaper because they have a neurological disease that made them unable to control their bladder or bowels, or some other disease that stunts the development of certain things upon which toileting depends. Some children around Madison&#39;s age are wearing this diaper because they wet the bed, and too heavily for pull-ups. Some around Madison&#39;s age are wearing this diaper because they were in an accident that damaged their nerves, or made them unable to make it to the toilet. Some are wearing this diaper because they are on lengthy, time-sensitive road-trips. Some are wearing this diaper because they are being disciplined by their parents for immature behavior. And likely, some children around Madison&#39;s age are wearing this kind of diaper completely willingly, because they simply enjoy the wearing of diapers that fit them.<br />
<br />
Whatever multitude of reasons people around the world may have for wearing this diaper, it is probably safe to assume that Madison is the <i>only</i> child wearing it as a result of mind-control powered by a magical sapphire. For even if other magical vessels of mind-control exist out there, it is likely that none of their owners are drawn to the idea of making young girls wear diapers, except for you.</p>
