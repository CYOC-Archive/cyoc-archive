<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walking nonchalantly down a small street in a rather nice neighborhood, Zarr Gar'Kahn looked from house to house, searching for a <br />
suitable trio to participate in his game. He sensed nothing. Still, he searched, passerby paying him little mind, despite his demonic <br />
appearance. Of course, it being October, most people were preparing for Halloween, so it wasn't really out of the ordinary to see the <br />
occasional enthusiast decked out in his overly intricate costume ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Gar'Kahn was just about to give up his search in this particular area, that is, until he came across a home, not quite as nice as the rest. <br />
The yard was overgrown with weeds and the house itself was in a state of slight disarray. It was quite a contrast when compared to it's <br />
surroundings. Nonetheless, he could feel something inside. A mortal with a strong transformation fetish dwelled within. He could sense <br />
something else inside: two more mortals, with not quite as strong a signal, but a deeply rooted, however unexplored desire for <br />
transformation. All three were good friends and roommates, quite tenacious when it came to competition.<br />
<br />
'Perfect' Gar'Kahn said to himself. He surmised that these three would be more than suitable candidates for his entertainment.<br />
<br />
John and Jeffrey Kurtith were brothers, each constantly at each others throat with back-and-forth banter, constantly trying to outdo one <br />
another, and enjoying it all the while. Their somewhat shy friend and roommate, Brendon, however much he enjoyed occasionally <br />
joining the others in their zealous endeavors, generally preferred keeping to himself. He was rather enthusiastic about the idea of <br />
transformations, and, being an artist, spent much of his time drawing detailed, and in most cases, erotic images of people being <br />
transformed into various objects and animals. Neither of these three could possibly know what was about to come knocking on their <br />
door.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, a loud rapping could be heard upon the front door, and Jeffrey went to answer it. To say the least, he was quite surprised <br />
at what he saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, there!&quot; Gar'Kahn announced cheerfully. &quot;My name is Zarr Gar'Kahn, and I was once know throughout the world as the terrifying <br />
master of transformation!&quot;<br />
<br />
Simply assuming this was merely a prank by some idiot in a costume, Jeff replied &quot;Sure you are, but I'm afraid we're not interested in <br />
whatever you're. . . Selling.&quot; He tried to slam the door, but Gar'Kahn held it open<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm afraid you don't understand,&quot; Gar'Kahn said hastily. &quot;I've come to offer you boys the chance to wield powers you could only dream <br />
of. . . At no monetary cost to any of you.&quot;<br />
<br />
By this time, Gar'Kahn's entrance had caught the attention on John and Brendon as well. &quot;What the he'll are you talking about?&quot; Jeff <br />
said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What if I told you,&quot; Gar'Kahn continued, &quot;that I could bestow upon each of you the ability to transform each other into whatever you <br />
want, for sport? It's a little game I created.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good for you!&quot; Jeff retorted, laughing, &quot;But you're insane! Now get out of here. We aren't interested in whatever crazy game you think <br />
you've invented, you freak!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How about a demonstration?&quot; Gar'Kahn said, his voice becoming more menacing. He pointed his finger at Jeff, who barely had time to <br />
utter a confused &quot;What?&quot; Before shrinking rapidly, disappearing into his clothes, which fluttered gently to the ground.<br />
<br />
The room was deathly silent as Gar'Kahn stepped through the door, silently closing it behind him. He knelt down and began to sift <br />
though the pile of clothes that lay on the floor where Jeff had just been standing, muttering to himself &quot;Now where did that boy go? After <br />
a few moments of searching, apparently unable to find what he was looking for, Gar'Kahn picked up one of Jeff's shoes. He looked <br />
inside, and declared, &quot;Ah! There you are!&quot; The shoe was overturned, and out fell a plain brass ring, which rolled a few inches across the <br />
tile before falling over, laying motionless on the floor before the demon, who squatted, gazing down at the ring, tail flicking behind him, <br />
a cruel grin spreading his face, revealing his sharp, blackened teeth. Gingerly, he lifted the ring from the floor, and stood up, slipping it <br />
onto his right ring finger. Extending his arm in front of him, he admired the band, smiling wickedly. &quot;Beautiful!&quot; he whispered. &quot;I've still <br />
got it!&quot;<br />
<br />
Absolutely flabbergasted, John and Brendon just stood there, looking on, unable to comprehend what just happened. Finally, John <br />
mustered enough of his senses to speak. &quot;What. . . Did you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Really!&quot; said Gar'Kahn. &quot;Were you not watching? Your loud-mouthed friend has disrespected me. I offer him power and he chooses to <br />
insult me and cast me out. I don't have the time for such insolence, so I simply made him into something a bit more useful. He's much <br />
quieter now, too. Wouldn't you say?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's my brother!&quot; John said, distraught. &quot;How could you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WAS your brother, foolish mortal,&quot; the demon said sharply. &quot;Now he is nothing more than a piece of jewelry. Do not concern yourselves <br />
with him any longer, for now he belongs to me!  Now, are you two going to accept my offer and play my game, or shall I depart and find <br />
someone else more willing to cooperate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We will take no part in your sick games, you monster!&quot; John seethed.<br />
<br />
Gar'Kahn frowned. &quot;Very well. I shall take my leave. But not before I deal punishment for YOUR insolence as well.&quot; He looked from John <br />
to Brendon, and back to John. He couldn't help but admire the feeling he sensed from Brendon. He was obviously aroused by this whole <br />
situation, but he hadn't even spoken up this whole time. Perhaps he simply need a bit more of a push. . .<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; said Gar'Kahn. &quot;I've decided what I shall do with you, John!&quot;<br />
<br />
John tensed up. How did this beast know his name? But he didn't have much time to think about it. One flick of the demon's finger later, <br />
both he and Brendon were fully naked, their clothes having completely disappeared. Another flick later and Brendon found his genitals <br />
shrinking. Within the second, they were gone! His crotch was completely bare. The demon snapped his fingers, and John, unable to <br />
control himself, bent over, pressing his ass against Brendon's bare crotch. There was a flash of light, and John shrank, fusing to <br />
Brendon. In mere seconds, the fully grown John had become an eight inch shaft jutting straight out from Brendon's crotch, in full <br />
erection. His arms and legs had fused and moved to his base where they were now reformed into a pair of testicles hanging between <br />
Brendon's legs. At the tip of his shaft, where John's face had once been, was only a small vertical slit.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your friend now has a new purpose.&quot; Gar'Kahn said, chuckling. &quot;I daresay he'll bring you more pleasure now than he ever did before.&quot; <br />
He laughed, and turned to leave.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait!&quot; Brendon yelled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Be advised, mortal,&quot; Gar'Kahn warned, &quot;to anger me now would be most unwise. You would share a fate similar to your friends'.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, it's not that.&quot; Brendon said. &quot;I just wanted to ask, if I agreed that the three of us would participate in your game, is there any <br />
chance they can be changed back? My friends, I mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. . .&quot; the demon paused. &quot;I would consider it. Nonetheless I seem to have finally caught your interest. . . I guess so. Yes, if you <br />
agree to participate, I will let your friends go. What say you?&quot;<br />
<br />
Brendon thought for a moment. It was now or never. . .</p>
