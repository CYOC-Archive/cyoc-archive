<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Hey, I want a piece of this action!&quot; came a yell from the rear of the auditorium.<br />
<br />
Madame' looked up and out over the crowd as all on stage also peered past the footlites. A thin and tall coarse looking old man walked quickly dowing the isle toward the stage.<br />
<br />
Clomping up the steps to the stage it was easy to see his age. At last on stage, he stopped and took a long breathe. Then walking closer to both the Shire and Quarter horse Stephen he began to also look them over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I do agree these are both very fair specimens of horse flesh. However both are showing normal weakness signs of not or never being worked. At best these young horses are looking sound but remain unproven!&quot; told the old man.<br />
<br />
Madame looked both surprised and pieved! The young buyer group of students began to scatter and headed down off the stage. Soon only the old man stood looking to Madame and her nephew Stephen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mamme' it would seem your aution has been cut somewhat short! I however will offer a price none could have matched. Say these be specimens of true humans made by your powers into horses could remain for some time enchanter? If this may remain and they thus remain as they are there, then there is worth in their purchase. I offer then $10,000. each!&quot; specified the old man as he reached inside his suit coat jacket.<br />
<br />
Madame's eyes squinted with absolute joy at both price and the withdrawing of the old man's wallet. Shire and Quarter horse offered a soft and muffled nickkering sound as if aproving the sale to the man rather than ending up a beasts own by who knows!<br />
<br />
The money changed hands and the two horses were lead off stage. The old man remained standing nearby as Madame gave him a questioning stare.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there something else we need to converse about?&quot; asked Madame wishing to go on with her show.<br />
<br />
Clearing his throat with several rough hacks the man said, &quot;Just those younsters that wanted to bid on their friend, I'd like them to step up here again!&quot;<br />
<br />
Madame smiled and reaching her hands out past the footlites she cast a spell. Suddenly several young people stood up and began in single file walk out of the seating row and down to the stage steps. Groaning and muttering to themselves they were spellbound to obey.<br />
<br />
The group clomped up the steps to the wide wooden stage. Standing like kingpins from the tallest to the shortest they stood shaking in their shoes.<br />
<br />
&quot;You youths have arrived as per your request!&quot; remarked Madame as she too wondered what the man had up his sleve.<br />
<br />
The old man walked along in front of each as they stood spellbound on stage. A snearing look at each told which were brave and who was the coward. Turning on his heal he walked again down the line tapping on the shoulders of four younsters. &quot;These four are what we need to consider first!&quot; said the old man with a gaze to Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Consider what?&quot; asked Madame acting almost as nervous as those victims standing on stage.<br />
<br />
&quot;That young man Stephen wanted at first to help the Shire be to his fullest potential, yet you made him into a Western Quater horse. The shire would over time toughen into the true form of one fine draft animal, given the enchantment doesn't wear off too soon! Now these four stand here as new examples of young minds willing and longing to experiance life! I will pay well to give them an education in life worthy to their desires, if your please will agree?&quot; asked the old man.<br />
<br />
Madame still baffled looked to her nephew and then with a knod of her head agreed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
Again he walked looking over each youngster and tapping two on the shoulder asked them to take two steps forward. Then he looked to Madame, &quot;These two are boldest of the four and should remain as their born gender. Stallions both they should be like fine Percherons. These two while bold seem to be somewhat more modest and they in their turn should be Percherons too but as mares. All dappled gray over their broad backs and white from there down. All on firm conformation in stance while remaining of total human recall. I should pay also $10,000. for each if this can be done?&quot; said the man.<br />
<br />
Madame spun into a whirl as the powers she commanded spun their deeds about the young persons picked out by the old man. Clothes flew as they were ripped from the bodies that wore them. A haze of dust and smoke from Hell circled the four.<br />
<br />
The crowd hushed as screams of fear and no doubt some pain came from those four brave youngsters. In the whirling winds all watched a human faces elongated, ears sprouted, neck strained out longer. Screams of utter fear as their spines grew both larger and longer. Arms and then legs stretched out, then pointed down to become legs togather. The dust soon calmed as from the blurred cloud stepped out first two massive dappled gray and white stallions. <br />
<br />
The entire crowd moaned with wierd delights. Stallions now in form and manners stood snorting and huffing great draughts of air. Each knowing the wild and bestial feeling both sprouted massive erctions.<br />
<br />
Then stepped forward one mare born a girl and one mare born a boy. One looked at the other and seemed to take note of the other's mass and form.<br />
<br />
&quot;EXCELLENT!&quot; yelled the old man. &quot;Now may I inquire the length to which these will remain spellbound?&quot; asked the old man.<br />
<br />
Madame smiled, &quot;Those who are stallions will remain as stallions till their big cocks have entered not less than one thousand vagina's. The ones who are mares will remain as they are till having dropped five foals. So here they are and the price of $40,000. please!&quot; said Madame'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes but first these last five here need to experiance life as well! I have at my Manor five children we adopted. They being very young need mounts equal to their size. These five showed an attitude of one like a skiddish pony might have, thus they keeping their born genders and human memoies should become Welsh ponies together. Yet for them I'd ask that their spellbinding be for only six years! At least by then my children will be of such growth that ponies will no longer be correct and they can move up to an animal more the needed size. It should be then that their spell break and announce their return to human form, agreed?&quot; asked the old man with a smirk.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd agree but at what price do you offer for this my special service?&quot; asked Madame. <br />
<br />
&quot;Do them first and let me look at their conformations!&quot; demanded the man.<br />
<br />
Squeals of fright and moans of strange pain made the sound as winds did whirl again and dust flew about. Madame stepped closer to the old man and whispered in his ear. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why these and why ponies?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
A smile, then he said, &quot;They all were bold enough to save their friend but had no experiance in such matters. You though would have doomed them to some useless life as simple beasts! I have a greater view of life and wish for them to learn and thus appreciate what they had as teenagers. I expect when they return in some years from now to human form they will desire to accomplish far more than they would without this experiance, wouldn't you agree?&quot; asked the man.<br />
<br />
The winds calmed and dust settled once again as five sound and hardy Welsh ponies stood oggling the others. One black, one dun, one white, two brown, they snuffled as each mind accepted their new body and life.<br />
<br />
&quot;$2,000. each and I'll return eith their foals or the price whichever you would prefer?&quot; offered the old man.<br />
<br />
As all this bargining and spell bindine was occuring the crowd began to file out of the auditorium. Soon Madame noticed the empty seats and gave a scowled to the old man.<br />
<br />
&quot;Keep my stock till a truck arives for their transfer to the Hillside Manor Farm. I shall see to it that these shall learn their manners at my Manor, and in the manner of true horseflesh!&quot; Laughed the old man and with him Madame as Percherons, Shire, Quarter horse and five Welsh poies whinned their fates.</p>
