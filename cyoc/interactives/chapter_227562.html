<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Walters and his team found Jane unconscious. her lime green fingers ended in points now and the blue fur was extremely fluffy on her forearm. her other arm seemed to be slowly changing as well. &quot;attention command we have an unconscious female who is in an early stage of change. alert the medical team,&quot; After that Walters ordered his men to move her. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
  <br />
Marcus approached the doctor. &quot;it&#39;s true she hasn&#39;t finished her change&quot; he said. he had flown for the last hour to get here. &quot;yes we were quite lucky. it seemed her adrenaline decreased when she fainted. no injuries reported.&quot; they approached the room. Marcus noted it was an old medical facility like the others.  <br />
<br />
Team Zodiac didn&#39;t want to risk people&#39;s lives in case of fire. entering the room they saw Jane. her forearms and hand had increased in size. at the biceps it transitioned to more of a blue-gray color. &quot;we&#39;ve kept her sedated and notified her next of kin. for now, we will monitor her changes until they finish&quot; the woman said.  <br />
<br />
several machines were nearby taking in her readings. not to mention several scientists and doctors in the room. &quot;and how long until the changes finish?&quot; Marcus asked as he saw Jane&#39;s biceps grow. &quot;given how this has happened in the last 2 hours I&#39;d give it a few days until the changes finish.&quot; the doctor said. &quot;well hopefully this lady will give us an answer on why this happened or at least how it&#39;s happening. the blue-grey fur now covered the bicep. it was shorter than that on the forearm. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jane looked around at her surroundings. She was naked on a beach somewhere. behind her was the ocean.  there was also a lifeguard house a white plastic chair and a silver umbrella. the clouds were perpetually moving in odd shapes. What Jane was most curious about was the fact that there was nothing in front of her except sand.  <br />
<br />
She had tried to walk forward but found herself always in the same place. she could explore what was behind her until she got waist-deep in the ocean then the same thing would happen. &quot;where am I&quot; she spoke but her mouth didn&#39;t open. it was more like an echo in this place. suddenly she heard a male voice.  <br />
<br />
&quot;you are in your mind&quot; Looking down into the waves she saw a furry dragon anthro staring back at her instead of her reflection. She moved her hand only to notice her arm was identical to the dragons. she also noticed how it was mimicking her movements. &quot;who are you?&quot; she asked. again neither mouth moved. &quot;I am your birthright. if you want to know how I came to be... well even I don&#39;t know. what I do know is that you have been given a gift&quot; he then rose from the water.  <br />
<br />
he was still translucent. &quot;what do you mean birthright?&quot; Jane asked as they headed back to shore. &quot;something has changed. those born in the year of the dragon have changed. The same has happened to you&quot; They approached the lifeguard house and he turned around.  <br />
<br />
&quot;my form will be yours. I&#39;m sorry but I can not change it&quot; he said. jane suddenly felt her shoulders change. the fur became more grey there and a little fluffier. She could feel her shoulder width expand.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t there any way to undo this?&quot; she asked as the fur began to cover her upper back. her underarms gaining large tufts of blue fur. more blue fur now covered her front in a jagged v shape that stretched halfway down her stomach. &quot;I&#39;m sorry but no. at least not for now.  <br />
<br />
the humans outside are monitoring your changes so maybe they will have a solution,&quot; he said. a large tuft of blue fur grew between her breasts as they shrank into meaty pecs. from there the two just sat down. well, Jane sat on the chair and the dragon sat in thin air copying her. they then began talking. he explained that while the changes were happening fast in reality they were happening slowly. jane could feel her body changing.  <br />
<br />
a 6-pack now completed her v-shape torso as her pubic hair changed. her brown bush turned blue and became fluffy. &quot;hey I thought dragons had scales not fur?&quot; she said as she felt her spine elongate. &quot;it&#39;s a roulette for everyone&quot; was the only answer she got. her blue-grey tail transitioned to blue a third of the way down as it reached the ground.  <br />
<br />
it then continued to grow as the final third transitioned to lime green. suddenly she noticed the dragon had an erection. &quot;um, are you excited for something or...&quot; Suddenly she felt aroused. the fastest part of the transformation hit. her clothes grew rapidly as it became her cock. he could feel every vein throb as it grew to a massive 3 feet.  <br />
<br />
jane grabbed his cock with both hands as his vagina inverted. blue fur covered his sack as his new basketball-sized testicles dropped expanding his sack down to his knees.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;okay for future... *cough* events like these hazmat suits will be needed,&quot; the doctor said. Marcus heard the screams and ran into the room. he soon found himself almost slipping on a slime of some kind. looking forward he saw several doctors and scientists heading towards the decontamination showers. a softening cock slowly went down dripping with cum.  <br />
<br />
&quot;What happened?&quot; Marcus said as he stepped around the puddle. &quot;well um... the genitals mutated at an accelerated pace greater than the rest of her.&quot; the doctor then went to a decontamination shower herself. Marcus looked at the 24-year-old in front of him. The young woman before was by no means weak but now she was built.  <br />
<br />
she or rather he was muscular now. his cock and balls had shrunk to a third of their erect size. &quot;*huff* well if this is the worst you&#39;ve got then I hope we can get your best,&quot; he said to the sleeping now man.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, that was amazing&quot; Jane smiled. he then noticed the dragon was missing now. his pelvis now shifted to a male position. &quot;where&#39;d you go&quot; he asked to the open air. blue gray fur covered the pelvis. &quot;you have accepted the gift. your mental state has changed. I am you now&quot; he found himself hearing the voice in his mind. it was the last he ever heard of it. suddenly she moaned loudly but not from pleasure.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Doctor!&quot; Marcus yelled. the doctor ran to Jane who was beginning to moan in pain. she and several others began moving Jane to her side. two bulges were seen on the man&#39;s back. &quot;looks like he&#39;s one with wings&quot; the doctor said. turning to Marcus she explained. &quot;we did a similar thing when Jane here grew his tail&quot;. raising an eyebrow she explained further. &quot;after the genitals are changed Jane will be called him until he tells us otherwise&quot;.  <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
jane felt his wings grow. the pain was gone in an instant. looking in the ocean he saw they resembled bat wings. the digits were dark gray. the outside membrane was blue-gray. the lower inner membrane was lime green which transitioned to blue. he smiled as he flapped his wings. he grinned as he tried to fly. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Burne welcome,&quot; Marcus said. he shook the hands of the two. &quot;you said something happened to my daughter.&quot; Mrs. Burne said.  &quot;yeah nothing bad but you need to see,&quot; he told the two as they approached the door. &quot;sir why aren&#39;t you telling us what happened to our daughter? I know she has this year of the dragon syndrome or whatever it is&quot; Mr. Burne said. Marcus stopped the two before a set of doors.  <br />
<br />
&quot;well, a... change has occurred Mr. Burne. we thought you needed to see it as soon as possible&quot; Marcus said before opening the door. jane was lying on her side and was covered on her torso. even with the covers, his parents could tell something was off. &quot;we covered it as soon as we were able to get all the details&quot; Marcus motioned for the doctors to remove the blanket. both parents were shocked when they saw a bulge on their former daughter&#39;s crotch.  <br />
<br />
while soft it was still an impossible foot long and two softball-sized testicles which were clearly outlined in a purple speedo. &quot;your son went under a sudden gender change yesterday.&quot; Marcus told them, however, they were clearly in shock. looking at Jane he noticed the fur had spread down her thighs. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
jane couldn&#39;t believe the rush. even though he knew it was a dream he still loved flying. flapping his wings he touched down on the beach. he soon noticed the umbrella had gotten shorter. no, he had grown taller.  <br />
<br />
his thighs had lengthened after the blue-gray fur covered them. &quot;wonder if any ladies will like my new body&quot; Jane said. his eyes widened as he realized his sexual preference had changed. of course, technically this meant he was still straight. once the fur covered his knees it transitioned to a dark gray color as it covered his calves.  <br />
<br />
like his arms, his calves became extremely fluffy. he could feel his feet shift on the sand. he felt his ankles raise as his toes went from five to three. they became pointed like his hands as they turned dark grey. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;so these samples will help,&quot; Mr. Burne said. the doctor collected the DNA samples from the two. &quot;hopefully so, we have been taking DNA samples constantly since Jane was first brought here. however, we don&#39;t have any DNA before his change&quot; Marcus said. Mrs. Burne looked worried still as she spoke.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Will my Jane be able to change back? she had a life before this. my daughter has a life!&quot; she began to break down into tears. &quot;Mrs. Burne I&#39;m sorry. right now it is unclear. your child&#39;s case is a first for us. we will try everything but...&quot; Marcus hesitated before continuing. &quot;we have yet to find what caused this.  <br />
<br />
Hopefully with your help will find an answer and/or cure. However for now you need to be there for Jane&quot; &quot; A knock was heard on the door. Marcus got up and approached it. they were in one of the rooms. Jane&#39;s parents couldn&#39;t bear to leave her until she woke up. &quot;yes?&quot; Marcus said as he opened the door. &quot;sir, Jane&#39;s neck has altered. he is in the final stages&quot; the doctor said. nodding Marcus approached the two.  <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
&quot;When you said you were my power I didn&#39;t expect the voice to,&quot; Jane said. he rubbed his throat feeling the bump on it. the blue from his chest had spread up his neck. he now had a handsome voice. it was the kind a lady could listen to all day.   <br />
<br />
While he felt it the blue fur covered his jaw. his long hair suddenly shrank into a short messy style. he felt it and liked how it didn&#39;t go past his neck now. the front half was lime green while the back half was blue. two blue horns grew from his skull as his ears moved to the top of his head. the inner ear gained fluffy blue fur while the outside gained a blue-grey color.  <br />
<br />
this quickly spread over the remaining skin as his muzzle began to push outwards. he could feel his nose as it sunk into his muzzle leaving only his nostrils. a dip on his upper muzzle covered his original canines as the rest became fangs. he licked his lips with his longer tongue. suddenly he gripped his head. new information hit him.   <br />
<br />
he could feel his fire gland inside him now. he could feel how strong he was now and how durable. &quot;well, goodbye Jane, and hello Jake&quot; he said. suddenly the beach faded away. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Jake opened his eyes to see 4 faces. two he recognized as his parents. the other two he had no idea. One was a woman in doctor attire and the other looked like a military man. &quot;Jane you with us?&quot; the doctor asked. he could smell a faint smell on her. one that smelled like him.  <br />
<br />
&quot;yeah doc I feel great,&quot; he said. the four around him were a little shocked. just from him saying that they felt like he was trustworthy. &quot;well I&#39;m Marcus head of Team Zodiac. we specialize in helping people like you.&quot; Marcus explained as Jake got up. he suddenly noticed how far away the man was from his head.  <br />
<br />
he knew his father was 6 feet so he had to be at least 8 feet tall. &quot;zodiac? Isn&#39;t that the Chinese calendar thing?&quot; Jake asked. &quot;there&#39;s a bit more to it than that Jane. we were formed in the wake of people changing into dragons. the only link is those born in the year of the dragon.&quot; Marcus then explained further. &quot;....basically we would like to run some tests then you are free to go&quot;.    <br />
<br />
nodding Jake stretched every muscle causing any female in the room (except his mother) to stare in admiration. &quot;sure dude. Sounds good to me&quot; Jake then nervously scratched his head. &quot;there is just one thing. I&#39;m going by Jake now&quot; he was nervous because his parents were here. looking at them showed different expressions. his dad was just relieved he was okay.  <br />
<br />
his mother on the other hand was upset. &quot;that is understandable. We have yet to encounter a dragon who hasn&#39;t had some mental change. We will just need to know how extreme&quot; Marcus said. the doctor then spoke. &quot;um... wow... sorry about this. I think something is different about you&quot; Marcus could see she was flustered.  <br />
<br />
it was weird because she had done the other dragons from Draco Point. &quot;yes... doctor focus we need to do those tests before we can release him&quot; Marcus said. the doctor nodded but Jake could smell she was aroused. &#39;must be my animal magnetism&#39; he thought as he was led to his tests.</p>
