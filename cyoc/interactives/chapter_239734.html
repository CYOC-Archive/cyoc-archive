<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Buster Trader Chapter 5: Becoming A Bully Is Totally Awesome<br />
<br />
Alex was now the Big Man on Campus. His name was no longer Lex, he&#39;d noticed. Lex had faded into nothing. He no longer felt like Lex had ever existed. All his memories began to fill his head. Memories of a happy childhood. Memories of Parker being born and being the best older brother to him he could be. Memories of always being a golden child. Everyone treated him nice his entire life because of his looks. He coasted through school. He was loved and popular. <br />
<br />
He walked through the hallway like he was an absolute KING. He swaggered everywhere. He noticed even his walk and the way he carried his body had changed. Likewise, the former bully who beat his ass was now about 5 feet tall and shrank from everyone. It made Alex angry just to look at the little bitch that Colt had become. Kelly. KELLY. What a queermo name, he thought to himself. Fags were so disgusting! He frowned. Where had that thought come from?? Fuck that fairy little bitch. <br />
<br />
His muscles bulged as he showed off the goods. He was living large and in charge! All the girls threw him glances. He was taking Bree and Leah to the dance but he had completely forgotten about Vanessa. She was his main girlfriend but there were SO many girls out there! Luckily, Vanessa didn&#39;t go to his school. God, he was so horny. He needed a good fuck. He was 16 going on 30, Alex realized. Fucking ay, I got the body of a man and the needs of a man. I gotta get that hot ass pussy before I can do any of this fucking algebra shit. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, his algebra teacher was being very nice to him. Was she flirting with him? Well, why wouldn&#39;t she? She was still pretty hot. She had a nice ass. What was she, 33? Yeah, she was still bangable. <br />
<br />
Class after class, his female teachers talked to him with...deference. Sweetness. They craved him. They were so glad to get eye candy like him coming in every day. His flawless smile. His charm and assuredness. He cracked jokes in class and everyone laughed, including his teachers. Everyone eating out of the palm of his hand. <br />
<br />
&quot;HEY LOSER!&quot; someone shouted in the hallway. Alex nearly jumped out of his skin before realizing no one was talking to him. &quot;WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME, LOSER?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I...I wasn&#39;t looking at you!&quot; the pathetic greasy looking, long haired, glasses wearing emo wimp whined. Man, did I sound like that in the old life? No wonder I got beat up! Colt as Kelly was cowering before one of his jock buds. <br />
<br />
&quot;What seems to be the problem here?&quot; Alex asked, stepping in. <br />
<br />
&quot;This fucking FAGGOT was looking at me. Let&#39;s teach him a lesson, Alex!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I think we can form an arrangement. Kelly, why don&#39;t you apologize to Kurt here for leering at him with your fag eyes.&quot; He couldn&#39;t believe the things that were coming out of his mouth! He was getting hard! &quot;There&#39;s a fag tax, Kelly. Five bucks right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What are you talking about? There&#39;s no such thing as a fag tax! I&#39;m totally gonna tell on you guys.&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex mocked him harshly by rephrasing his sentence and then slammed Kelly against a locker. He grabbed the small fry with one hand and held him up by his shirt. &quot;FIVE BUCKS. Or ELSE. LOSER.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I...I don&#39;t have any money. My family is poor. Let me go, you fucking dumb asshole!&quot; <br />
<br />
Alex&#39;s eyes narrowed. How DARE he! How DARE he call me names! Doesn&#39;t this fucking NERD know who I fucking AM?? I&#39;m the fucking KING of this school! <br />
<br />
&quot;Poor white trash, huh? Kurt, do you know what we do with poor white trash?&quot; He doled the words out slowly, with a sadistic smile. <br />
<br />
People laughed in the corridors as he grabbed the nerd under his arms and paraded him through the court. Taking him behind one of the buildings emptying out for lunch, he and Kurt marched up to a garbage bin. <br />
<br />
&quot;No, no please! Don&#39;t throw me in there!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t throw me in there!&quot; the jocks mimicked, in mocking voices, and laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alright! Time to take out the trash!&quot; Alex announced. Kelly squirmed as he told Kurt to take the boys legs. He took Kelly&#39;s arms. &quot;On the count of three! Ooooone!&quot; He swung Kelly. <br />
<br />
&quot;No please! Put me down! Please, Alex! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Twwwwwwwwwwo!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;No no no! I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry for anything I said!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;ThreeEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot; The jocks threw Alex up into the air. For a brief second he felt the freedom of flight and then...THUD!<br />
<br />
&quot;Ow! OOOW! There wasn&#39;t even any trash in here! Hey! Someone help! I&#39;m really hurt!&quot; <br />
<br />
Kurt was nervous that they actually hurt the little shitstain but Alex just wiped his hands. <br />
<br />
At lunch, he recounted his adventures to a group of people who hung on his every word. <br />
<br />
&quot;And so then after he mouthed off to me, I took his camera and just fucking broke it. He told me to pay for a new one and I told him to cram it up his ass! What was he gonna do? I was ten times bigger than he was. Hahahaahahahahahahaha!&quot; Alex realized he had plenty of stories about abusing and beating up nerds for all his new friends to enjoy. Soon there was an &quot;Ahem&quot; behind him. Two teachers were standing ominously over him and told him to follow him to the principal&#39;s office. <br />
<br />
When he got there, Kelly was crying like a little bitch. At first, Alex denied he&#39;d ever tossed the little nerd and said he must be making things up again. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have a confession already from Kurt. We know you did this, Alex. And it&#39;s serious.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh come on. He can walk it off. He&#39;s just faking,&quot; Alex blew the whole thing off. His voice was so perfect, he thought to himself. <br />
<br />
&quot;We have several complaints from students who SAW YOU marching Kelly against his will all the way across school grounds before you assaulted him. The school nurse has said he has several broken bones in his hands. and his legs are busted up pretty badly, too. We&#39;re going to escort him to the hospital and we&#39;ve called the police. You&#39;re going to be arrested.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Kelly simpered in the corner. <br />
<br />
&quot;ARRESTED! You can&#39;t arrest me! Do you KNOW who I AM? My family OWNS this town! I&#39;ll have your fucking job!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sick of this. Kelly, come on. The ambulance is here.&quot; <br />
<br />
The ambulance people helped Kelly onto a bed and wheeled him away. The principal shut the door firmly and locked it so that Alex couldn&#39;t leave. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, Buster Trader was sitting at the desk, a cigarette dangling from his lips. <br />
<br />
&quot;Tough deal, kiddo. Didn&#39;t take you long to make a real mess of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You! You&#39;re the one who gave me the advice to bully the little fag!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; Buster said defensively. He looked like a hunk straight out of the 1940s with his fedora, five o&#39;clock shadow and trench coat.  He lit up his cigarette and exhaled smoke casually. &quot;You accepted the deal. In your old life, your positions were reversed. You just went ahead and made a mess of things day one! So was it everything you hoped it would be?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t KNOW the garbage bin was empty!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk tsk tsk. Impulsivity is a big problem when you&#39;re a bully. You gotta learn to bully your victims with a little more finesse, pal.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The cops are coming to arrest me! Do something!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm. Let&#39;s see. I made you straight and I made little Colty...Kelly...whatever. I made him into a 98 pound weakling, so...let&#39;s even it out a little. In the next iteration, I&#39;m gonna move you to the 1980s. It will be easier for you to get away with being an asshole jock. We&#39;ll have the same students and principal. But...&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;But what? Make it quick, the cops are coming, dude!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re gonna have to find a new bullied kid somewhere in the next iteration to change. As a candidate for moving on up in the world. Not Kelly, though. Nah, we&#39;re not done with him. You&#39;re gonna have to go more slowly with him, pal. Bullying is kind of an art form. It&#39;s about mental torture as well as physical. You know what I&#39;m sayin&#39;?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;So...find a bullied kid who we can jockify.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Bingo. He&#39;ll go from dud to stud, just like you. He&#39;ll have to fit certain criteria, of course. Poor family. Background being abused. Out of shape and unpopular. Maybe some mental problems. Then I&#39;ll give him the old zapparoni. Oh and one more thing...I want you smoking these from now on.&quot; He threw Alex a pack of Lucky Strikes. Alex caught them. He had great hand eye coordination, though. <br />
 <br />
&quot;I HATE cigarettes, though!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Too bad. I hear they&#39;re great currency where you&#39;re going though. Maybe you can use those.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine! I&#39;ll take up your filthy habit.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Light one up for me right now. I want to see how obedient you can be...for the sake of our friendship.&quot; <br />
<br />
He tossed a lighter to the new jock, who giving Buster the stink eye, fished one out of the packet and lit it begrudgingly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Suck it in all the way, bub.&quot; <br />
<br />
He had never smoked before. The smoke entered his lungs and made him dizzy. After a few minutes, he had almost finished smoking his first cigarette when the cops arrived. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, the door opened. <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you OUT OF YOUR MIND??&quot; His principal was apoplectic. &quot;You&#39;re actually SMOKING in MY OFFICE?!&quot; He put the cigarette back in his mouth and puffed on it as he was led out. <br />
<br />
The cops put handcuffs on Alex and humiliated, the giant jock was escorted to a police car. He stubbed out the cigarette in the parking lot. He rolled his eyes as they took him to the station. The cigarette had actually felt...good. Amazing, even. He didn&#39;t think smoking would feel quite this good but it really did! <br />
<br />
As soon as they locked him in his cell, he laid down on the bare metal bed and shut his eyes. <br />
<br />
When he opened them again, he was back home in his new room in his father&#39;s new mansion. All the posters in his room were...old. The car posters, the models...everything was...<br />
<br />
He noticed the TV in his room. He was one of the only kids he knew that had his very own TV set! He turned it on. The news was talking about President Reagan&#39;s newest summit meeting. It was 1983, he realized. <br />
<br />
In addition, he was totally blond now. Not just blond, disgustingly good looking, better looking than any jock had a right to be and with a perfect wave to his hair that would make any Hollywood actor jealous. <br />
<br />
He went to his closet and it was filled with new clothes. Lots of bright colors and patterns that no one in the 2000s would be caught dead wearing. He chose a stylish black leather jacket, sunglasses and torn jeans. Alex meandered into the kitchen where his mother Gillian (he was still getting used to the idea of Gillian being his mother or even having a mother at all) was playing Duran Duran on the radio. Her hair was now done up in an enormous perm. She was wearing giant diamond shaped glass earrings and her outfit was bright pink and blue and covered with pastel triangles and squares. Parker, his new brother who he&#39;d taken from Colt&#39;s old life, was eating his sugary cereal and happily reading the newspaper funny section. <br />
<br />
&quot;Garfield is really funny this morning!&quot; he told Alex. &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; completed its lyrics before the radio announcer started talking about Bananarama. <br />
<br />
&quot;I bet. Let me guess. He&#39;s not exercising again. Not like me.&quot; He slipped out of his leather jacket. &quot;Look at this bicep, huh?&quot; He flexed for his brother and laughed. &quot;Garfield doesn&#39;t have that!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;I have breakfast for my growing boy!&quot; Gillian produced sausage and eggs for Alex, who wolfed his breakfast down as his father came in to gruffly remind Alex that he would be accompanying his father to work this weekend, so he could meet the CEOs he would be working with after college. Alex&#39;s head swam. He was surrounded by opulence and wealth in the decade most known for opulence and wealth. He couldn&#39;t wait to get to school! He actually looked forward to all the socializing he could do! <br />
<br />
He kissed his mother on the cheek and shook his father&#39;s hand. His father was carrying himself with distinguished grace as he picked up his cell phone case. His cellular phone was about the size of a cantaloupe, Alex realized with a shock. But a rich executive like his father could afford it. After all, he was important enough so that he needed to be able to take calls from the governor&#39;s office while he was driving. <br />
<br />
He drove his brother to school and realized how there were hardly any fatsos anymore. Almost no one was fat and almost all the girls were wearing perms when he got to his high school. He parked his prized Jaguar and sauntered to class, on top of the world. He high fived several guys that greeted him, and he knew that he was always the life of the party. There were SO many parties to go to now! He thought about covid and his old life and how he&#39;d never been to even one single party. Now? Now he was in Party Central! <br />
<br />
The trend continued from Life 2. All his teachers were quite taken with him. All his classmates were enamored with him, and everything was hunky dory. <br />
<br />
Walking to 4th period, he noticed several of his fellow jocks holding little Kelly upside down by his legs. Kelly was kicking and screaming for dear life while other students impassively walked by. <br />
<br />
&quot;Help me! Help me!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Are you the dude from The Fly? Hey guys, put the little Poindexter down. Hey, Poindexter!&quot; He put Kelly on his little feet. He no longer had long greasy hair. Now he had short greasy hair and bigger glasses. <br />
<br />
&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t call me that,&quot; Kelly bemoaned. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, you need a big strong guy to look out for you, Poindexter! Come here, let me help you out some more!&quot; He picked the little wimp up and slung him over his enormous shoulders. His friends laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Come on, put me down, Alex! This is embarrassing!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;More embarrassing than letting some jocks hold you up by your legs upside down?&quot; Alex smirked and sauntered into his classroom. &quot;Gotta delivery here, Mr. Adams!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Put him down, Alex! He could hit his head on something and then we&#39;d have a lawsuit.&quot; Mr. Adams went back to reading his Stephen King novel. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, Mr. A. Sometimes I dunno my own strength!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you picking on that little nerd?&quot; one of the girls asked. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, see I was saving him. I&#39;m like a knight in shining armor over here! Tell him, nerd!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s true. He was saving me from some jocks holding me upside down by my legs. Thanks, Alex,&quot; Kelly said glumly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, no problem, pal! What are friends for?&quot; He bent down and whispered in his ear. &quot;You little faggot cocksucker.&quot; He ruffled the much smaller boy&#39;s hair and smiled broadly as he saw one of his jock friends. They talked in the back until Mr. A started class. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Henderson?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, Mr. A?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Why don&#39;t you have your book?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh uh...my dog ate it.&quot; <br />
<br />
The class laughed. Even Mr. Adams laughed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Your dog must have a stomach like a woodchipper with all the books it eats. Find someone to share a book with you. I want you to partner up for this exercise.&quot; <br />
<br />
So of course, he chose his little nerd friend. <br />
<br />
&quot;What&#39;s up, faggot?&quot; he asked in a low voice, ducking down as he sat opposite from Kelly. <br />
<br />
&quot;I feel like I&#39;m in purgatory!&quot; Kelly whispered. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nah. It&#39;s more like my own personal heaven. And you get to be here to wish me well. Okay, so I took things a little far last time. But now we&#39;re even. Honest engines.&quot; Kelly smiled. &quot;So uh...how many dicks HAVE you sucked this week? I hope you don&#39;t get AIDS.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;You don&#39;t get AIDS that way!&quot; Kelly seethed. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you talking about AIDS?&quot; Alex answered, acting innocently and spreading his big arms in a confused gesture. <br />
<br />
&quot;Alex, get back to the assignment!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, Mr. A!&quot; He turned back to his nerd victim. &quot;Just go along with it, okay? I really like this decade and I want to stay here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I don&#39;t!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t care. Now you play your cards right and I won&#39;t throw you into another garbage bin. Deal, nerd?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Fine,&quot; Kelly said glumly. He was now a gay nerd during the 80s at the outset of the AIDS crisis. Great. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, what are we doing anyway? I wasn&#39;t listening.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;re supposed to come up with technological innovations that could have made a difference to ancient Rome if they had used the materials they had.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;VCRs? They could have had ancient pornos! That would have been great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Only they didn&#39;t have plastic,&quot; Kelly laughed at his tormentor&#39;s stupidity. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Mr. A? What about VCRs?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Henderson!&quot; Mr. A replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, seriously, they could have made uh.. Cleopatra Does Cairo or somethin&#39;, huh? Or uh...Biggus Dickus the Gladiator. You&#39;d watch that one, huh Kelly?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Shut up, Henderson! Maybe you&#39;re the one who&#39;s obsessed big dicks,&quot; Kelly replied before realizing his mistake. The entire class went &quot;Oooooooooh.&quot; &quot;Uh oh.&quot; Kelly gulped. &quot;I&#39;m...sorry. S...sir. Please don&#39;t throw me in the garbage again.&quot; He was pathetic, and Alex grinned over the power he had over this little nerd now. Alex deathglared him. Time to teach him a lesson in who was still in charge around here! He thought a lot more in terms of being in charge since he became this blond bully jock. It was so important! Everyone had to look up and respect him! <br />
<br />
At lunch, Alex decided to harass the little nerd and rub reality in his face. Bree and Leah walked on either side of him, both of them wearing crazy 80s outfits with ruffles, shoulder pads and bright colors, both now with perms. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, Poindexter! Why don&#39;t you have a girlfriend yet, freak show?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, leave the little fag alone,&quot; Bree said. &quot;He obviously isn&#39;t going to get a girlfriend.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, even if he wanted one he couldn&#39;t get one,&quot; Alex said, in a mockingly sad tone. &quot;I mean...look at that pasty skin and that ugly hair and those big nerd glasses and that weak chin. Oh, and those spindly arms!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you, very funny, haha,&quot; Kelly answered, sipping his Pepsi emblazoned with Michael Jackson&#39;s image. <br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you sitting alone, nerd? Is it because...awww...you don&#39;t have any friends. That&#39;s so sad. I mean, I&#39;d invite you to sit with us but there are so many boobs over at my table and I know you don&#39;t like boobs.&quot; <br />
<br />
Kelly burned with rage while the girls laughed and Alex walked them to their table where he regaled everyone with heroic tales of derring-do from his last exciting weekend journey. He took trips often and went to lots of parties. All his teachers were giving him straight A&#39;s and he barely covered the material. His father kept a retinue of tutors if he needed to call them. And some of them were college girls with great tits and hair, he thought. <br />
<br />
He talked to his various jock friends about pranks they could pull on Kelly. In one class, they had brought dog doo in a newspaper and smeared it all over the nerd&#39;s seat and he sat right in it! Everyone laughed. The teacher was mad and she chewed them out that the janitor would have to clean it and it made her classroom smell. She didn&#39;t seem to be too mad about the glasses wearing faggot who had dog shit on his ass now. Kelly was utterly humiliated. All the students said they didn&#39;t see who did it. Alex and his friends smiled innocently in the back row and pretended to be poring over their books studiously. <br />
<br />
They got away with everything. They walked by him and ran into him. They knocked books out of his hand. They chased him after school was over throughout the school and laughed. There were four of them and he was like a scared little bunny rabbit. <br />
<br />
Alex had never felt so alive! It was primal. It was such a rush! The little nerd was so tiny now! Haha! They finally caught him and he screamed as they all laughed and pushed him in the janitor&#39;s closet and walked away, whistling innocently. Kelly cried to himself in a corner. He was getting claustrophobic. Those stupid big jocks! He remembered another life where he was the one bullying smaller boys and he hated this new reality! It wasn&#39;t fair! They were all so good looking and huge!  <br />
<br />
After school, Alex had football practice. He was big and strong now and he was a fucking BEAST. It got his blood flowing. He had never appreciated football before but it was incredibly complex. And he was so GOOD at it! He couldn&#39;t believe it. He was gonna show EVERYONE what a fucking MAN he was at the next game! <br />
<br />
In the locker room, he knew other guys tried not to check out his big swinging club of a nine inch dick. He had nothing to be ashamed of now, he thought as he soaped up. Other men could only dream of being him...and he was only 16 years old! <br />
<br />
He lit up a cigarette. God, there was nothing like a celebratory cigarette after a good practice or a workout. His body was pulsing with energy and sexual buildup. He needed a good hole to fuck! He drove home and went to his room immediately where he started stroking his big fat cock and images of the new Kelly came into his mind. Burying his dick right in that little nerd&#39;s hole! God that would be so fucking HOT! I&#39;m SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HIM!! <br />
<br />
He slipped in a VCR tape of Sylvester Stallone&#39;s &quot;Rocky III&quot; and put it on mute. <br />
<br />
Soon, he was climaxing to thoughts of hot men with huge muscles pummeling each other. Oh, God, he had a fetish for fighting now! It was just so FUCKING HOT! Wrestling on a mat or beating up a guy and then...the thought of fucking him right afterwards!!! He jettisoned cum like a Super Soaker Blast. It flew across the room and hit the wall. He turned and compulsively looked at the TV and cum blasted the screen. He couldn&#39;t help it. His own muscles were so BIG now! He was a fucking STUD! He had SO MUCH POWER OVER SMALLER MEN!!! <br />
<br />
He came twice more, also picturing a powerfuck or two with Bree and Leah and Vanessa all servicing him at once. And Kelly could be there as his servant, serving them all wearing a little waiter&#39;s uniform. Hey, that might not be a bad idea! <br />
<br />
He had so many plans for this decade already...</p>
