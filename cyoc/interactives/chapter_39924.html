<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The theatre appears to be the cause of not only turning you into a girl but also starting to turn you into a donkey! There's only one logical course of action in your mind, run!<br />
<br />
You leap out of your seat and run toward the exit. The weight on your chest is annoying. Having to hold up jeans that used to fit feels worse. As soon as you get into the hallway, you feel as though something is pulling at the base of your spine.<br />
<br />
Other former boys run out into the hallway. One that's wearing nothing but a tee shirt runs into you, causing you to let go of your pants just before you both fall to the ground.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get out of my way,&quot; the former boy cries. &quot;Oh God, I don't wana be a girl! Why are they doing this to me?&quot;<br />
<br />
You look at him as you feel something swishing between your legs.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, you have a tail,&quot; the former boy says.<br />
<br />
You look between your legs and indeed, you see a tail that you can feel touching the ground. You gasp as a bray echoes from the theatre.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get off of me,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
The other former boy sits up and then cringes before grabbing her ears. You can only watch as her ears stretch and grow grey fur until they're donkey ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, no!&quot; she cries.<br />
<br />
She stands as tears stream down her face.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want to be a girl or a donkey,&quot; she cries.<br />
<br />
You managed to stand and finally kick off your pants rather then deal with trying to hold them up.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't either but unless we get out of here, that's exactly what we're going...&quot;<br />
<br />
You watch in horror as a panicked donkey wearing the remains of a red shirt crashes through the doors all while braying constantly. It nearly knocks you over. She stops the donkey and looks into its eyes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn it Drake, you nearly knocked me over. Come on man, you're still in there right?&quot; she asks.<br />
<br />
The donkey nods but then brays before it runs down the hallway in a panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Screw this! I don't wana end up that way,&quot; the former boy says. <br />
<br />
She pushes past you and runs down the hallway. You turn and watch her go only to see a brown furred tail emerge from under her shirt. She appears to trip but when you run over to her to see if she's all right, you see that her feet seem almost deformed. In reality, her toes are turning into hooves and her feet are changing into a digitigrade stance.<br />
<br />
She rolls onto her back and can only watch as all but her middle fingers starts shrinking.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please no, don't let this happen to me,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know how to stop it,&quot; you cry.<br />
<br />
&quot;Them if I'm going to...&quot;<br />
<br />
Several brays escape her lips and she cringes. She manages several deep breaths before she tries speaking again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, take my clothes off and touch me,&quot; she says.<br />
<br />
&quot;But why?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let me feel the touch of a human being before all I have is a horny ja...&quot;<br />
<br />
She brays several more times. Her hands and feet are hooves. You obey her request and get her shirt off. She closes her eyes as you massage what is still soft skin on her belly and then move to her breasts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, don't stop,&quot; she says. &quot;I can't hold out for long. It's hard to concentrate. Please, make my last moments of humanity pleasurable.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's an odd request but in a sense, it's her dying request.<br />
<br />
You massage her belly and then her breasts even as her body shudders and she can't help but bray. Then her skin begins to toughen as fur sprouts all over her. She convulses as her hips and shoulders rearrange and her body expands fast enough to throw you back. She brays uncontrollably and manages to roll around and stand up on shaky legs.<br />
<br />
Knowing you can't be far behind makes you feel sick.<br />
<br />
You stand up to run but something grabs your shirt. Turning, you see the now former boy turned donkey holding your shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay, I get it, you don't want me to leave you behind,&quot; you say. &quot;Fine, fine, let's get out of here.&quot;<br />
<br />
You both leave the theatre building. Outside you see a scene of chaos. A half changed boy lies in the street as two other boys back away from him before running away. You run over to him. He's wearing nothing but shorts, his chest is covered in grey fur, his feet, legs and hips are honey hind quarters and fur is creeping up his neck.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please help me,&quot; he cries. &quot;This can't be happening, it's impossible!&quot;<br />
<br />
Your donkey friend brays.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, it's -- my hands, please no!&quot;<br />
<br />
He seems to be in pain. You watch as he holds his left arm in front of his face. His left hand changees before his horrified eyes into a black hoof.<br />
<br />
The boy cries out. &quot;No, please, I want my hands back. Oh God, what's happening to my dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see his manhood. You've never been interested in boys before but now, a part of you wants to resume changing along with him so you can experience having him inside you. You shake your head in an attempt to rid yourself of those thoughts.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know it's shaking and stuff,&quot; you say. <br />
<br />
You can only watch and cringe as his manhood quakes before it expands from a normal looking human one into a shape and size that seems fitting to the animal he's becoming. He gasps and shudders before grabbing your shirt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, I never touched a girl before,&quot; he says. &quot;Let me touch you before I'm done for.&quot;<br />
<br />
You see the pleading in his eyes and don't have the heart to tell him the truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;All right,&quot; you say. &quot;You can touch me.&quot;<br />
<br />
You remove your shirt and close your eyes. His right hand is warm as it touches your breasts. You know that this could be the last time he'll ever touch a female (natural born or otherwise) and could even be the last time he'll be himself.<br />
<br />
Then his touch becomes colder.<br />
<br />
You open your eyes to a black hoof where his right fingers used to be. His face is also lengthening.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God, no! Please no! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to -- run before I can't control -- save yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
You stand as his pleas become brays; your companion brays, you feel your tail swishing back and forth, your ears start burning. It's starting to happen to you. The boy's body is filling out and even as his eyes darken, he turns a longer head toward you and speaks what could be the last words he'll ever speak and in what may be his final moments as the person he had grown into.<br />
<br />
&quot;Conrad Stevens -- tell family I'm sorry -- can't think straight anymore I...&quot;<br />
<br />
He closes his eyes and his body convulses before he stands and resumes braying. From his expression and even the way he moves, you can't help but wonder if there is any humanity left in him. Even if it is, the donkey instincts and urges are taking a hold on him like an iron fist.<br />
<br />
You back off and look at you're companion who is walking closer to the now male donkey.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, resist it, don't act like a donkey,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
Your companion unfortunately seems as lost to instinct as the now donkey jack. A feeling of nausea grips your stomach when you see her point her rump at him in a display of submission. That's your signal to run. Even as you run, now naked across the warm pavement, your ears are growing longer and your tail is going nuts.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stay human, stay human,&quot; you chant.<br />
<br />
Your only hope to escape such a fate seems to be to escape the island. You run through the streets past boys that haven't begun changing yet. Their cheers only raise your fears. Even if you escape, you're still a girl! You shake your head to force worry over that out. It's something you'll deal with later.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, a bray distracts you and you run right into a boy who's also naked and also has a tail and donkey ears. You land right on top of him. He's filthy, sweaty and has a look on concern on his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Geeze,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh crap,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you naked?&quot; you ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are *you* naked?&quot; he asks.<br />
<br />
&quot;This guy was changing and I wanted to let him touch me so his last moments of humanity were pleasant,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
He shrugs his shoulders. &quot;I just felt like being naked.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'd better get out of here before it's too late for us too,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
He nods and you climb off of him but can't help look him up and down. You feel yourself getting damp at the idea of staying there with him and trying out this new body of yours. He's getting hard as he looks you over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe we'd better get out of here before we lose control,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;We already have ears and tails,&quot; he says. &quot;We're basically screwed. Maybe we should enjoy our last moments of humanity before it's too late?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, you can't bear to tell him the truth. You think of what you'd want the naked girl before you to do if you were in his position.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tell you what, I'll give you this,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
You reach forward and stroke his manhood. You're angry that if you're stuck like this that you'll need to ask permission and seek out a male to have access to a male body from now on. On the other hand, you can see a naked woman any time you want. <br />
<br />
He gasps and closes his eyes. You're not sure what's worse, that you, someone that was male an hour ago is touching another man or that you seem attracted to him and the act is almost fun. You try to rationalize that the body is just a shell and you're just making another person happy; that person having a male body shouldn't change that. But, you can't help but wonder if such an act makes you either an official female now or that this has changed your orientation.<br />
<br />
As you massage the guy, your curiosity gets the better of you and you start fingering yourself. You're lost enough in the moment that you get more turned on when his manhood getting longer and thicker.<br />
<br />
A bray from some poor soul facing the last moments of their humanity breaks you from the trance.<br />
<br />
You look at the guy's manhood and gasp and let go of it in shock when you see that it's become twice as long and thick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't stop,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;But your thing, it's changing! This is making it change! We have to stop,&quot; you cry.<br />
<br />
He opens his eyes and looks at his package.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, man don't stop,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you nuts? Touching it is going to change you,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Just a tiny bit more,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
He reaches for his member and strokes it, sighing in pleasure. It grows with each stroke. Unfortunately, you also see grey fur starting to sprout on his chest. You have no choice but to grab his hands.<br />
<br />
&quot;Look at what that's doing to you!&quot; you say. &quot;Do you want to be a donkey?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I -- but it feels so nice,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's what they want us to do,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
He looks at his manhood and then at you.<br />
<br />
&quot;But don't you want to see how it feels? I mean with a guy with such a big...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, I don't, at least not right now,&quot; you say. &quot;now come on, let's get out of here before it's too late.&quot;<br />
<br />
You grab his hand and you both start running. Sounds of braying and yelling echo through the streets. It seems to be a race against time but you manage to get to the shore.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have to swim for it,&quot; you say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you nuts? We'll never make it,&quot; he says.<br />
<br />
&quot;What would you prefer, that we stay here and become donkeys?&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks back to the island, at his manhood, then at you before looking out at the sea before giving his answer.</p>
