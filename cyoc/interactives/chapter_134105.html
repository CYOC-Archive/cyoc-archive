<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Guiding the dying car into the old service station, both Margaret and Corey were relieved at their good fortune. The young gay surfer hopped out of the car as soon as it stopped, looking for an attendant. The middle aged lesbian stayed inside, again checking the tracking app.<br />
<br />
Unseen by both of them, a black luxury town car bearing Texas vanity plates that said &#39;Gospel&#39; pulled into the station behind them...<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
Inside, Corey found the attendant and explained the situation. As they spoke, the surfer couldn&#39;t help but admire how the other man filled out his oil-stained jumpsuit, as it reminded him a little of Nick wearing his wetsuit. But that pleasant memory and the moment of arousal sealed the gay man&#39;s fate as the curse began to work its power on him.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, Corey began to feel an ache in all of his body. Staggering away from the attendant, he leaned against a row of shelves as he felt his muscles beginning to swell. His lean physique gained in the pounding surf gradually gave way to the mass of a regular gym goer. This was emphasized by the chiseling of a six-pack across his abdomen, which was followed by his pectorals surging outward to pull his t-shirt tight.<br />
<br />
And speaking of his clothes, his feet now burst through his well worn sneakers with a sudden growth spurt. But soon, the ripped material was darkening and gaining a sheen in the process. In the blink of an eye, his size 12&#39;s were encased in a pair of brown leather cowboy boots, polished to a mirror shine. The darkness  leaped from the crevices of the leather onto his socks, and shifted them from white cotton to black silk. <br />
<br />
As the socks rose up, the board shorts Corey was wearing started to descend in a swirl of threads. Some of its pockets sealed up while others shifted to new locations. Pretty soon, the light color had given way to tan, as crisp creases snapped into place down the legs of the new trousers. A black leather belt slithered around his waist and connected with a large buckle plate that had a stylised &#39;G&#39; on it. His once thin wallet, now in his right front pocket, grew wider and thicker as various credit cards and wad of bills filled its black leather interior.<br />
<br />
At this moment, Corey had to clutch his head with his growing hands, struggling against a new persona starting to form in his mind. Images of a life of wealth and luxury washed over him. Its aggressively hetero nature seemed disgusted by his homosexuality, which scared the gay surfer who opened his eyes in shock.  His gaze briefly lit upon a rack of girly mags that stood nearby, and this new self seized the moment to assert itself. His still semi-erect dick started to rise up to full mass in response to the images of the scantily clad women on the covers, growing into a cock made for pounding pussy.<br />
<br />
Amid this struggle, Corey&#39;s t-shirt had been pulled super tigh, but now it started to gain more layers. One of them became a crisply-pressed white dress shirt with a wide and very starched collar. Another became a clean wife-beater that tucked itself into the loose boxers his too tight briefs had become. Finally, the last layer extended outward to become a deep tan blazer that matched his trousers. It was tailored to fit his new muscular body. A black bolero tie slid into place around his thick neck and pulled upwards.<br />
<br />
An increasingly weakening Corey was confused by the hetero feelings that seemed to be growing stronger and stronger by the moment. He needed to get out of here, and get back to the car before it was too late. However, the straight persona that was developing kept him glued in one spot, as it waited for the final piece to unlock its true identity to arrive. Just then the bell above the door rang and in strode a man he suddenly recognized. It was Nick! But he looked way older than Corey remembered, but a part of him knew that this man was his missing lover. However, the curse was about to twist their relationship into a form more compatible with their new sexualities.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s my boy...mah boy...mah brother Nicholas!&quot;<br />
<br />
  Now the final physical changes began to affect his head. Corey&#39;s blonde hair grew darker, shifting to black as unseen hands slicked it back with hair gel. His chin widened while a perfect grin of white split his lips. His blue eyes were swallowed up in brown as the remaining traces of his gayness were drowned in a morass of hyper-masculinity and arrogance that called itself Cornelius Gospel.<br />
<br />
Now walking over to greet his brother, a few final details of his life popped into place. This gas station was owned by him, being one of many in Gospel Gas chain that now dotted the southwest. He&#39;d come here as part of one of his famous inspection tours, and was pleasantly surprised to see his older sibling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nicholas,  what are ya&#39;ll doin&#39; out here?&quot;?<br />
<br />
&quot;Vacation wit&#39; mah wife and son, brother. And you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Y&#39;know I like to check up on my franchises.&quot;<br />
<br />
The siblings shared a laugh, memories of other trips they&#39;d shared wrote themselves into place, strengthening their family bond.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did y&#39;all bring yer lovely wife?&quot;<br />
<br />
The question triggered the slow curl of a golden band around Cornelius&#39; ring finger. He was proud of her, a symbol of his status as a real man. <br />
<br />
&quot;She&#39;s waitin&#39; in the car...&quot;<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Outside, the logo of the station was replaced by a giant golden G, as other signage appeared declaring it to be Gospel Gas. There was also a shift in the overall apperance of the place as it grew cleaner and well maintained. There was also the rack of free bibles that rose up next to pumps, courtesy of the Reverend Hawthorne and Nicholas. Cornelius may not be as religious as his brother, but he did appreciate the man&#39;s ideas on the proper relationship between man and woman.<br />
<br />
=====<br />
<br />
Back inside the car,  Margaret was surprised when the tracking app indicated that Karen&#39;s phone was less than 10 meters away. She looked around for a sign of her wayward lover. But she only saw one woman getting out of a car behind her.<br />
<br />
She watched the other woman pick up one of the bibles that had fallen off its shelf, getting a good look at her ample ass as she bent over. She felt a flush of attraction, but that moment soon passed as the &#39;were-breeder&#39; curse began her transformation.<br />
<br />
Maragret had been dressed in a loose fitting brown sweater and well-worn jeans, which now began to reshape themselves into attire more suited to who their wearer was becoming. The legs of the jeans fused together, and the combined tube began to flare out into a full length skirt, the material thinning in process as the blue gave way to a light green. The thick wool of the sweater was also losing thickness and its original color, as it tightened up into a green silk blouse. A stiff collar rose up and unfolded around her thinning neck, as buttons popped into existence down the front of it. The comfortable flats she&#39;d been wearing shifted from black to forest green into leather, as thick heels began to push outwards.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, her body had begun its shift towards its new state as the straight trophy wife of Cornelius Gospel. Her modest bust swelled up almost two cup sizes, and ripped through her old bra. But soon enough, the remnants twisted themselves into a sturdy replacement. In response to the different life her new self lived, her hips widened with a loud crack, even as her flat rear began to swell with fat and muscle. It became the idealized image of a heart-shaped ass.  Her stomach was tightening up as years of careful care and exercise made themselves apparent. Smooth silken stockings now rolled up her legs, which lengthened and toned in response. A sudden adjustment to her spine was accompanied by a series of pops and cracks as her height increased a few inches , even as the small of her back curved inward to emphasize her perfect ass.<br />
<br />
Margaret might&#39;ve reacted to the changes she&#39;d been undergoing, but she was too didtracted by the mental assault on her lesbian identity from the new persona coming into being. She could feel her attraction to women being drained and replaced by a lust for  men. She didn&#39;t understand why this was happening, and tried to focus on Karen. But her romantic feelings on that front were also changing, becoming far more familial.<br />
<br />
<br />
Margaret could only grip the steering wheel as her hands became more delicate with longer nails and red polish. Her dark brown hair that had been pulled into a loose ponytail sudden burst into  a gilden blonde mess that  hung down past her shoulders. It didn&#39;t remain free long, as unseen hands shaped the mass into a sophisticated bouffant. Her face was suddenly flush as she felt the touch of makeup on it. The foundation seemed to smooth out her skin, as the blush raised her cheekbones and left her with dimples. Her thinnish lips plumped up as crimson spread across them, with her lashes curling outward above brown eyes turned blue. A perfect smile of gleaming white came to her mouth while a gold band curled into place around her left ring finger,<br />
<br />
Margaret stumbled out of the car up, trying to reconcile her clashing memories. She wasn&#39;t married...or was she? A fleeting memory of being in bed with Karen came to her, but the growing straight persona resisted such thoughts. A woman of class and taste wouldn&#39;t stoop to such behavior, not while she had a man to satisfy her feminine needs. She moved towards the other woman, who  had turned towards her. <br />
<br />
The flash of recognition on her face worried the fading Margaret, who somehow realized she&#39;d found her lost lover. But that came too late for her fleeting lesbianism to reassert itself,  as it was crushed under a tide of hyper-heteroness and polite memories of her sister-in-law Corrine Gospel.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why hello there, Greta. So lovely to see y&#39;all here today...&quot;<br />
<br />
The mention of her name helped further cement the persona of Greta Gospel, the sexy and sophisticated wife of Cornelius. In reflection of this, bits of jewelry popped in place, like earrings, necklaces and bracelets. The purse she&#39;d left in the car swelled larger, filling up with make-up and other bits she need. Her phone twisted itself into a high-end model, as it connected to various social media accounts as well as gained a long list of contacts among the wealthy and the famous.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it is wonderful to see you, Corrine darling~.&quot;<br />
<br />
The two ladies exchanged social plesantries as the car Corey and Margaret had driven here was crunching and bending itself into the luxury SUV that Cornelius and Greta had bought just for this inspection trip.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon, their husbands emerged from the service station, and they all started planning for a dinner that evening to catch up some more. Nicholas mentioned that there was supposed to be a fine diner that specialized in home cooking between here and the next town.<br />
<br />
====<br />
<br />
And with that, the reunion of the separated lovers had caused the Gospel family to grow larger by two with an a sizable increase in its influence with the addition of Gospel Gas to the family holdings.</p>
