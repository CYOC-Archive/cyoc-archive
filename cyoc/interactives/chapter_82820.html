<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Naomi walked to the nearest poster. &quot;Well, on the bright side...&quot; she said, pulling the poster down from the wall, and gleefully tearing it in half. <br />
&quot;What better way to celebrate your upgrade could I ask for?&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Harry was still fuming over all this &quot;Lone Wolf&quot; nonsense as he waited for the management to send down their liaison. Most of the park's staff <br />
had abandoned humanity shortly after the first wave of departures had tested the waters, but every time they sent someone down to speak with <br />
the huskies, it was always a human. He couldn't entirely fault them for relying on a little subconscious canine loyalty when Naomi was running <br />
the show, hers being a rather... forceful personality as it were. Now that he was the one attending these meetings though, the premise <br />
bothered him a fair bit. As the door across from him opened, he was also briefly shocked at just how strange they looked. Bald all over, like <br />
some horrible skin disease had made all their hair fall out.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's this about granting 'VIP' status to to a bunch of rowdy punks? You realize we were already short staffed before Naomi left. The last <br />
thing we need is some sort of boneheaded 'special exemption' policy getting introduced the same day you flood the park with a bunch of self-<br />
entitled jackasses.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact that we are understaffed,&quot; said the human, with a look that stole enough of the fire from Harry's indignation for him to take a seat, &quot;is <br />
the reason we are being so accommodating to this group.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So what? You figure they're going to be self-policing? Because I have news for you...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. I figure the donation they made to the company will keep this park fully funded for quite some time. This place runs up quite a few <br />
expenses you realize. Apart from paying the staff, maintaining the grounds, and keeping the guests well-fed, there's a host of other concerns. <br />
Developing new species templates, working out all the little problems they introduce. Training the medical staff to deal with all the subtle <br />
variations and potential drug interactions. There's a whole team of lawyers on the payroll now, just to ensure basic rights for those who leave <br />
the park in their new forms, not to mention all the lobbyists needed to keep the government from shutting the whole place down. This is still <br />
very much a growing company, and we can't afford to pass on this kind of generous offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry sighed. Root of all evil indeed. &quot;OK... and just what sort of 'special treatment' are they asking for in return? Bringing beer kegs and hot <br />
wings out into the forest for them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, nothing that would damage the park's aesthetics. Apparently, they plan to hold some sort of formalized tournament, with 'official <br />
recognition of the titles prizes and punishments' for those involved, or some such nonsense. It's all about some sort of fraternity or country <br />
club or some such. Just inform your subordinates they're not to interfere with whatever silly little hazing rituals they have unless there's some <br />
form of life-threatening injury, make sure a medical team is on standby when they hold their little 'tournament,' and afterwards we are to <br />
'respect the new chain of command' they set up for themselves. Past that, just try and show a little more lenience with any minor infractions. <br />
From the sound of it, they're planning to make this a yearly tradition, and we could all benefit from that sort of dependable revenue.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a huge mistake. It may be before your time, but the last time something like this went on, someone was nearly killed, and we do not <br />
have the staffing to manage this sort of thing on top of regular patrols. I don't know if you heard, but-&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Again.&quot; The forceful tone snapped Harry to attention. &quot;Hiring additional security staff is the top priority for allocating these new funds. <br />
Openings have already been posted, and with any luck you'll be seeing a sizable batch of new trainees by the end of the week. Now unless <br />
there were any further concerns, I suggest you pass this information along to the others, get some sleep, and do your best to make sure our <br />
latest guests have an enjoyable stay.&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry had quite a number of 'further concerns' in mind, but new better to voice them when clearly the matter was not up for debate. Instead, he <br />
simply said &quot;I may know a person or two who would be willing to come back on board.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
Terry was having a great deal of difficulty ignoring the nearby sounds of pleasure. Why had her ears chosen now of all times to provide a <br />
properly heightened state of awareness? Fighting down the urges they were inspiring was proving a little tricky as well. Even as she stammered <br />
out, &quot;I'd never- I mean, I'm already with someone, so I wouldn't...&quot; she felt a rising urge to just leap into Tim's arms right this minute, tackle <br />
him to the ground and- She shook the image from her head as best she could, trying to focus on something else. Katerina had just said <br />
nobody ever chose to stay as a rabbit, hadn't she? Maybe she did have this place all wrong. Maybe it really was just the people with some weird <br />
repressed desires who decided to stay this way. All the foreign urges were definitely there but...<br />
<br />
Continuing down the tunnel, she caught a quick glimpse of a pair of lovers who had apparently been too caught in the moment to make it all <br />
the way around the corner and out of sight, interrupting her train of thought until they were out of sight.<br />
<br />
She'd definitely gathered from those at the support group that sexual preference changed with one's sex, so if she was irresistibly attracted to <br />
the men around here, that was just affirming her normal attraction to women, right? So by extension if she was really worried about people <br />
doubting her masculinity when she went back to normal... and hadn't she and Wendy joked once about cheating? Terry would be fine if she <br />
brought home another girl, and Wendy wouldn't object to catching Terry with a guy... especially one built like Tim, with that chest, and those <br />
arms...<br />
<br />
&quot;We all do a bit of staring when we first arrive, but the novelty wears off soon enough. Anyway, as you can see, you can get a bit of privacy in <br />
these side rooms, but most of the colony spends their nights in the main den. You'll find as a rabbit you sleep easier with company. It's <br />
understandable if you'd prefer not to on your first night, so just grab any unoccupied niche you see, but once being cold and lonely outweighs <br />
that shyness, just pile on in with everyone else... we try to keep a supply of berries to one side of the den as well... from the look of things you <br />
really should take advantage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Terry nodded absently, too distracted by her concerns and rationalizations to fully pay attention. &quot;I think I'll do that. The private room, I mean. <br />
It's... been a long day.&quot; Presumably, that couple up the tunnel wasn't a couple on the outside. They were just helpless against these feelings, <br />
and giving into instinct. Just like when she'd been chased before. She was feeling a lot more calm now though than she had been yesterday, so <br />
clearly that sort of instinct was just a passing thing...<br />
<br />
&quot;Good night then,&quot; said Katerina, giving her an affectionate hug as was apparently rabbit custom. &quot;Good night,&quot; offered Tim, also with a hug... <br />
which still felt as good as the earlier one. Terry certainly had more willpower than the couple up the tunnel. This sort of extreme pressure <br />
scenario was basically her job, and she had a distinct advantage from her differing motives. They really wanted to be rabbits, and she'd taken <br />
this form specifically because she knew she'd never be comfortable like this. So obviously if they had the resolve to leave, there was no way <br />
Terry would have a problem returning to normal, even if she tackled this whole rabbit thing with that much enthusiasm. Speaking of tackling, <br />
she suddenly realized she was still embracing Tim.<br />
<br />
Not wanting to embarrass herself again, she pulled away nice and slow, letting her arms follow his as she backed away. Clearly, she'd come <br />
through all this OK. She'd just hang out in this little cave with a bunch of friendly hippie types for two months, taking it easy. She let go of <br />
Tim's fingertips, noting she'd accidentally tugged him forward a bit as she'd been backing towards the niche. She continued to look up at him <br />
as she sat down, lowering her gaze when she realized she hadn't broken eye contact, only to find herself at eye level with an impressive <br />
reminder that everyone here was constantly naked. Strange really that she'd divorced herself from the nudity concept before and was suddenly <br />
aware of it again.<br />
<br />
Tim laid down next to her, smiling and rubbing a hand down the back of her neck to her shoulder. There was something to be said for quelling <br />
curiosity wasn't there? See an ad for a TV show and you find yourself wondering if it's any good for a month, but usually if you just sit down <br />
and watch an episode you see you aren't missing anything and never think about it again...<br />
<br />
++++++++++<br />
<br />
As James was escorted towards the exit of the park, he was still reeling from the shock of how that second husky had attacked him. How dare <br />
he! Obviously, he'd never have bit down, that would have had the whole park shut down overnight but... to take advantage of his instincts like <br />
that! Treating him like some animal! How dare anyone do that to him!<br />
<br />
Still failing to appreciate the poetic justice, James sat down at his computer the instant he was home. There was no way that paper he'd been <br />
forced to sign would hold up in court, and the Park's website likely had a staff section where he could find the name of whoever was heading <br />
up the security team. He was going to regret...<br />
<br />
James stared at the screen, chuckling to himself. Banned from attending the park as a guest, was it? This would be a fun little loophole... and <br />
he would not mind a change in career at all. It would be the perfect thing really. He'd get to stay as long as he liked, run down people who <br />
actually deserved it. Maybe even get to rough them up a bit! He'd need to apply under a fake name obviously, change his appearance a bit, but <br />
he could manage. Might be harder once inside, he'd probably look similar enough as a husky as he looked to a wolf, but there had been an <br />
option or two to make some significant changes. He'd definitely go unrecognized if he slipped in as a woman, but that would be taking things a <br />
bit far. Still, it'd definitely be a way under the radar. Establish himself, earn everyone's trust. Once they got to know the real him, he could <br />
switch back. They'd realize they had him all wrong by then, especially if he wasn't holding any grudges.<br />
<br />
Immediately, he started looking into how he could fool them long enough to get back in.</p>
