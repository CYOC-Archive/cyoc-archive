<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Bill sat there grinning when Drake got to the counter and explained his predicament. He explained about the lost bag and how it had some of his and a friends stuff in it. It was the same old lie, but with a twist. Bill gave Drake a funny look and then called Janice over to take over. Grinning, Bill dragged a confused Drake into the office.<br />
<br />
Inside the office, Bill told Drake to have a seat. A click from behind told him that the door had been locked. Going behind the desk, Bill sat in the chair and looked at Drake.<br />
<br />
Taking a deep breath he asked, &quot;Is it really Dru or are you Drake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken aback, but trying not to show any sign of recognition Drake replied, &quot;Drake is my friend and I don't really see how you could confuse me with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't toy with me,&quot; Bill snarled. &quot;The Djinn told me everything. So, you really want the lamp back, fine. But I think you might find that transforming yourself back will be a little hard. Call it a catch, if you will.&quot;<br />
<br />
A sense of dread flooded drake and he looked at Bill, suddenly uncomfortable.<br />
<br />
Seeing the look on the beautiful woman's face, Bill continued. &quot;You can have the lamp back. I don't really need it. That is, providing that you give me something in return. Oh, by the way. Have you been not feeling yourself lately, Drake?&quot;<br />
<br />
Drake could only stare in horror as the scene unfolded itself. Whispering, Drake asked, &quot;What do you want and what do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing, Bill stood up and moved around too front of the desk. Smiling, he sat on the corner and with a odd look on his face said, &quot;The lamp and your bag are in the safe. You may have them back as soon as you do one thing for me. I want you to give me the best pleasing a woman can give a man.&quot;<br />
<br />
Looking horrified at how the situation was turning out, Drake could only look at Bill and ask, &quot;What do you mean.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bill could see that this weirdo knew exactly what he wanted and grinning like a shark said, &quot;I want the best blow-job in the world. If you please me right, I'll think about giving you what you want. If you fail to comply, well I just turn you over to the cops.&quot;<br />
<br />
Freaked out, Drake tried to find a way out of this situation and was just about to try screaming when Bill, with a glint in his eye, said, &quot;I would not suggest you try screaming. This office is sound proof and you certainly don't want to feel my wrath. Now you will comply or you'll be talking to the police. I can report you as a run-away you know? Don't forget, I've had the lamp all night.&quot;<br />
<br />
Tears started to run down Drakes face as he saw no way out of the situation. Wondering what Bill had done, if anything, Drake slid out of the chair. Down on his knees, he watched as Bill undid his fly and presented Drake with his seven inch member, which was slowly getting harder.<br />
<br />
Swallowing, Drake opened his mouth and put the erect member in his mouth and trying to make it look right, began to slowly suck on Bill's penis.<br />
<br />
Bill was enjoying this and as Drake slowly sucked him off, he reached down and began to fondle Drake's breast. Feeling the nipple grow hard, he moaned in pleasure and just as he was about to blow his load, he pulled his penis from Drake's mouth. Forcing the woman to a standing position, he quickly reached down and ripped Drake's panties off. Forcing the woman to lay down on the desk, Bill thrust his penis into Drake's vagina and blew his load.<br />
<br />
Laughing, Bill pulled is penis out and told the woman that Drake had become to get off his desk and sit down. Seeing her comply, he walked to the safe and opened it. Withdrawing the duffel bag, he tossed it to Drake, who was now hugging himself and shivering.<br />
<br />
Saying, &quot;You might want to clean yourself up,&quot; Bill walked across the room and just as he was about to undo the lock he turned around.<br />
<br />
Looking at Drake Bill said, &quot;Oh yeah. The Djinn also told me about how if the next person makes a wish, the previous wish performed is now permanent. Well, I guess you'd like to know my wish. Seeing as how you turned your body into a woman, I did you a favour and turned your mind as well. Isn't the female biology wonderful? Well, enjoy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Laughing Bill undid the lock and exited. Shivering still, Drake stood and lurched across the office. <br />
<br />
Clicking the lock into place, Drake realized with horror that he'd been raped and that he was now stuck as a female. Sitting down, Drake decided to continue to refer himself as Dru for the time being and opened the bag.<br />
<br />
Inside Dru found the lamp and the clothes she had wished for the other day. Rubbing the lamp, the smoke appeared followed by the Djinn. Just as he was about to begin his whole spiel, Dru held up her hand and said in a hoarse whisper, &quot;I wish that I could go back. Go back to a simple time before all this had happened.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hoping that this would erase the past day, she closed her eyes and silently rocked back and forth as the magic bathed over her.<br />
<br />
But something felt wrong and opening her eyes, she watched as the office get bigger. She felt the dress and bra become bigger and sense of vertigo washed over her. Feeling sick, she clenched her eyes shut and tried keep from throwing up.<br />
<br />
A strange sensation washed over her body as her breast shrank back into her body. Her hips, waist, butt and pelvis shrank down and after a while she opened her eyes. Looking down, Dru suddenly realized that she had been taken back, just not in the way she'd thought.<br />
<br />
She was now seven years old and sitting in a bra and grown woman's dress. Gasping, she realized that the lamp was missing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is it because I've accidentally regressed myself back to the age of seven that the lamp isn't her?&quot; Dru thought. &quot;Do I have to grow up all over again just find the lamp?&quot;<br />
<br />
Having no answer, Dru grabbed the green duffel bag and decided to try to find Janice for help.</p>
