<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&#9642;Week 5: Tuesday<br />
<br />
Today I woke up long enough to take a good shower before classes, I first used a new shampoo that I bought. This is recommended to wash my tail. After the shower I got dressed and realized that, even just a little, my clothes were tighter, I solved the problem by wearing a baggy outfit, but my robbery underneath had no way and bothered me all day.<br />
<br />
I believe this is because I started to grow. I had already considered this possibility, because I am becoming a big horse.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 5: Friday<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t grow older during the week, but my feet started to bother me. They are not hurting, nor are they having trouble walking, but their nails have begun to darken. I will ask the doctor what is going on in the next periodic exam.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 6: Wednesday<br />
<br />
Today was my limit. I probably grew older and none of my panties fit anymore. My fur had already spread enough to cover my butt and genitals, so I settled on abandoning my clothes to my lower body. No more wearing panties, pants or skirts.<br />
<br />
I mentioned to the doctor the other day about forgetting to get dressed before leaving a few times and he said my mind was already merging with the animal&#39;s, and that clothes were becoming unnecessary for me. <br />
<br />
The doctor also confirmed at the last appointment that the darkening toenails indicated that my feet had begun to change, and that it would probably take two months to completely turn into hooves.<br />
<br />
&#9642; Week 7: Monday<br />
<br />
My toes began to shrink, and I also began to have difficulty getting my feet completely on the floor. I had heard that people had a few more issues during the transformation, I will have to relearn how to walk as my feet change.<br />
<br />
Later that day, Mr Roberts called me. He handed me the card of a support group for people in the process of transformation, telling me to look for them if I had problems.<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 7: Friday<br />
<br />
Yesterday there was a storm, and a lightning bolt fried the school&#39;s power box, so there was no class today. <br />
<br />
In the afternoon I was sitting in the living room brushing my tail, which had reached a foot long, when the bell rang. It was Chris and Lara. They were great friends, I knew I didn&#39;t need help groups with these girls helping me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good afternoon girls, Come in, I wasn&#39;t doing anything important at all.&quot; I said<br />
<br />
&quot;We have some news to give you.&quot; I told Lara as they reached the living room. Then they both took an envelope from their bag. I immediately recognized that envelope was from the same lab in which I did my tests.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are also affected by the animalizing virus. Just like you we are changing too.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really? And you already know what you are going to be?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;I will be a cow.&quot; said Lara, then she lifted her shirt and showed me some pink spots on a slightly swollen area. &quot;As you can see, my udders have already started to form.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you Chris, do you already know what you will be?&quot; I asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry, I still don&#39;t know that I&#39;m going to be.&quot; Chris said. so she woke up and started telling what happened. &quot;I went to the doctor after I realized that I had started to lose sensitivity in my vagina while masturbating, I was no longer able to feel pleasure. I also started to wonder why my period didn&#39;t come anymore. But I only looked for Doctor when I realized that my vagina was getting tighter. The exams showed that the transformation began with the Gender Change. So I just know that any animal I become, I will be a male.&quot;<br />
<br />
&#9642;Week 8: Friday<br />
<br />
Me, Chris and Lara went to get a medical exam together today. But Chris was the most anxious, since it would be the day she would find out what animal she was turning into.<br />
<br />
The doctor asked us to be naked for our exams. For me this was no problem for me, as I no longer wore anything but a shirt, but Chris and Lara were still a little embarrassed about it.<br />
<br />
He examined Lara first. But the only differences with the day she told me she was becoming a cow were that it was easier to see her udders, and a little tip over her ass that made it clear that her tail was starting to form.<br />
<br />
Then he went to Chris. This was the first time I could see any sign of change on her. She already had a small tail, just a little bigger than Lara&#39;s, but her vagina had already closed, leaving only a smooth skin where her ballsack is going to form, and her clitoris had become a small penis. The doctor stimulated her a little to make her have an erection, and I could see that her hard cock was only 3 inches. Her penis, though small, looked perfectly human.<br />
<br />
&quot;Her penis may have taken a human form, but this is normal for those who undergo gender change at the beginning of the transformation.&quot; The doctor said, realizing our doubt. &quot;But it will change as your panther transformation continues.&quot; he concluded<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean I&#39;m going to be a panther?&quot; Chris asked and the doctor confirmed it.<br />
<br />
I was the last one to be examined. My tail was even bigger, now one and a half feet long. I was also having trouble standing due to changes in the joints of my feet, problem for which the doctor told me to wear shoes specially developed for those who were going through this kind of change. Just the last marked change that I couldn&#39;t believe as I hadn&#39;t noticed before, but I was much taller. I used to be 5 feet and 2 inches tall, but now I&#39;m 6 feet tall.<br />
<br />
After the exam Doctor recommended that we next seek a help group for people who had the virus. But we declined saying we didn&#39;t need emotional support, we already had everything we needed were dissatisfied with that. And he added by saying that this group was not just for the emotional, but to help the changing people deal with the new situations they should after transforming.<br />
<br />
Then we decided to follow the suggestion and looked for the help group. We will really need to miss a lot of things.</p>
