<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Jacob couldn’t believe it. In an instant he had gone from only child to a brother of four. Who were his brothers? Where had they come from? Did this mean he had different parents now? <br />
<br />
There were just too many questions floating in Jacob’s brain. He needed answers and a lot of them.<br />
<br />
“Would you answer my questions!?” Jacob bellowed.<br />
<br />
“W-what questions?” Aiden timidly asked, taking a few steps away to draw back from the canine.<br />
<br />
Jacob smiled. It felt good to see the pompous cat in a submissive state again. In fact, the pleasure was starting to make him hard.<br />
<br />
Jacob shook his head and tried to regain his composure. Once more, his new body and identity was taking hold of him. And he couldn’t let them. There had to be a way to inhibit these feelings, but how?<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry. I feel a bit disorientated from the fall and would really appreciate you answering some questions I have,” Jacob said in a polite and respectful manner.<br />
<br />
Aiden’s eyes bugged out as Jacob’s formal demeanor increased his feelings of uneasiness. The snow leopard increased his distancing steps until his back hit the opposing wall.<br />
<br />
“Aiden, I’m sorry about earlier, but I could really use your help… please?” Jacob pleaded, clasping his hands together and giving Aiden puppy-dog eyes as he begged.<br />
<br />
“Not saying that I don’t want to, but why are you acting so…” Aiden stopped and rolled his eyes side to side as he contemplated what he wanted to say. “Unusual?”<br />
<br />
“I have a slight headache and feel disorientated from the fall, that’s all,” Jacob lied.<br />
<br />
In actuality, Jacob had come to a realization. His new persona was dominant and quick-tempered. Therefore, acting submissive and passive—the complete opposite of how he’s supposed to be—should keep him from becoming too lost in his new identity. Or so he hoped.<br />
<br />
“Well… are your questions similar to the one you just asked me? I mean, you should obviously know that stuff, so I don’t know why’re you’re asking me in the first place.” Now Aiden was viewing him with suspicion.<br />
<br />
Shit! Jacob held himself back from frowning. From an outside perspective it did make sense to be bewildered at someone for asking another person personal questions about themselves that they would clearly know the answers to. And his new behavior wasn’t helping, only making Aiden more wary. Jacob couldn’t afford to lose his source of information this quickly. He needed to find a way to trick the feline into answering his questions without coming off too suspicious.<br />
<br />
“Listen up. For every question you answer, I’ll let you touch me anywhere on my body,” Jacob said while gesturing to his body by flicking his right hand down his torso.<br />
<br />
Aiden’s eyebrows rose and his jaw dropped. He looked utterly flabbergasted, as if he couldn’t believe what he had just heard.<br />
<br />
“So, do we have a deal?” Jacob asked before giving the snow leopard a suggestive wink.<br />
<br />
Aiden’s pupils dilated and his tail began to flail around, intrigue written all over his open-mouthed face. <br />
<br />
Jacob grinned. Controlling perverts was a breeze. And it seemed that Jacob had made the right assumption in believing Aiden was one, because that had been WAY too easy. So easy, in fact, that he had to restrain himself from laughing. A quick look at Aiden told Jacob he no longer had to worry; the feline’s suspicious doubts had been replaced by salacious desires.<br />
<br />
“Let me repeat myself. Do we have a deal?” Jacob asked. Aiden nodded and ran over to Jacob, his hands outstretched to grope him, but Jacob placed a hand out to hold the horny cat back by his forehead. “Not so fast. Answers first.”<br />
<br />
“So, what do you want to know?”Aiden said as he backed up, a tent beginning to form in his jeans.<br />
<br />
“Let’s start with my brothers. Who are they?”<br />
<br />
“Jadon’s your older brother. Jarod, Jaxon, and Jasper are your younger brothers,” the snow leopard rapidly stated before placing his paws on Jacob’s pectorals. Aiden gave the firm slabs of muscle a squeeze, earning a deep moan from Jacob.<br />
<br />
“Hey! That counts as two!” Jacob glared at Aiden with an annoyed look, but his cock told a different story—slightly twitching and starting to leak pre in his sweatpants.<br />
<br />
“Sure, whatever,” Aiden said as he kept his hands—and eyes—on Jacob’s firm pecs, completely mesmerized by their sturdiness.<br />
<br />
“I assume that Silvermoon Gym is my family’s business. Am I correct?”<br />
<br />
Aiden nodded. “Yeah, your parents opened the gym a couple decades ago. Jadon’s the manager there and you and your brothers all work there full-time. Except for Jasper, he only works there part-time.”<br />
<br />
So his parents opened and owned a gym in the city. Did the past change to accommodate for his new identity? And did doing that somehow give him four brothers? At the moment, Jacob could only theorize that it was true.<br />
<br />
But if this had happened to him… wasn’t it possible for it to happen to other people too!? Instantly, Jacob began to imagine new people popping into existing because of the furry phenomenon. No way! That would be utter chaos. Maybe it only happened to him because he was the only one aware of reality changing. Kinda like how his body and identity were altered more in exchange for him retaining his memories. That sounded more plausible… and much less concerning.<br />
<br />
Aiden started to move his hands downward, toward Jacob’s cobblestone abs, causing Jacob to emit a small growl. “Hey! I said that each pec counted as one question. So don’t move those hands unless you want to lose one,” Jacob threatened while flashing his teeth.<br />
<br />
Aiden was unfazed by what he said, keeping his hands in place as he desperately sought to move them further below. Jacob, on the other hand, felt somewhat disappointed. Just like before, his new personality had come out naturally, making him menacing without intending to be. Luckily, Aiden was too distracted to be actually terrified, but it still bothered Jacob. He needed to do a better job at controlling himself.<br />
<br />
“You called me Sir Wolfe earlier. Why?”<br />
<br />
“That’s just the nickname you go by in the gym. At least for the people you privately train, like me.” Aiden instantly moved his hands the minute he finished answering, rubbing his fingers over Jacob’s abs and feeling the rigidness of his abdominal muscles.<br />
<br />
By now, Jacob’s boxers had become wet with his pre-cum and he didn’t know why. Well, deep down he did, but he didn’t want to admit it. As a previously straight guy, admitting to being turned on by another male sounded blasphemous. In fact, he had only agreed to letting Aiden grope him because he thought it would have no effect on him—considering he still remembered being straight and having no past romantic experiences with guys. Yet, it clearly was. <br />
<br />
Having his new and impressive muscles worshipped made him feel good, reminding Jacob on how powerful he was. And allowing a smaller guy to do it made it feel even better, as if he was demonstrating to the weaker male what a true alpha physique looked like.<br />
<br />
Jacob squeezed his eyes shut and opened them again as he tried to regain his focus. He had to ask more questions, not get lost in the new and pleasurable sensations of what he was doing at the moment. Jacob gulped and trepidatiously asked, “Am I single or am I currently seeing someone?”<br />
<br />
This was a question that Jacob had struggled to ask, but it would be best to just rip the bandaid right off and confirm if he was still dating Heather. After all, with reality changing so easily, it was possible for his girlfriend of the past five years to no longer be dating him. Jacob was unsure if he could accept a new reality where he and Heather were no longer in a relationship, but he had to find out the truth first if he was going to make an effort to do so.<br />
<br />
“You’re dating a girl named Heather. I know the two of you live in the same apartment, but besides that, I don’t know anything else about her.”<br />
<br />
Immediate relief washed over Jacob as he learned that he was still in a committed relationship with his girlfriend. This was amazing! Jacob smiled as he felt himself overwhelmed with happiness, leaving him in a state of euphoria. He felt so content he could leap up for joy. Not even Aiden groping his ass could distract him from how good he felt.<br />
<br />
Speaking of feeling good, Aiden also looked to be in a good mood as he fondled Jacob’s backside, squeezing his plump and robust cheeks in his hands. Aiden purred as he did so, the big cat relishing something he had never been allowed to do before.<br />
<br />
Uncertain if it was an effect from his cheerful demeanor or, worse, because he sorta liked it, Jacob’s pleasure skyrocketed. Similarly, his dick did the same thing, his member becoming fully erect and forming a large tent in his sweatpants. This grabbed the feline’s attention immediately as he looked up to make eye contact with Jacob, giving him the same look his cat would give him when wanting more food—he wanted Jacob to ask him another question and fast!<br />
<br />
Jacob didn’t know what he wanted to ask next, some of his biggest questions out of the way, but the look Aiden was giving him was downright adorable. Not to mention, the snow leopard was pretty cute too.<br />
<br />
And… hot.<br />
<br />
Jacob lowered his head, bringing it closer to Aiden’s, before the two interlocked in a passionate kiss, the cat’s sandpapery tongue and Jacob’s massive one meeting in their mouths. It was a rough and deep kiss, Jacob using his hands to grasp the sides of Aiden’s head as they jointly moaned from their intimate exchange. In spite of it only being a kiss, it felt just as good as sex, Jacob’s tail wagging madly while Aiden purred loudly.<br />
<br />
The two continued to kiss as Jacob tried to decide on what to do next.</p>
