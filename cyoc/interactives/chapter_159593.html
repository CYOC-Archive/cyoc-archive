<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Alec decided - he could not wait till the day was done to get this taken care of. He needed to get new clothes, stat. So once he was free from the current class, he simply headed out from it and off the school grounds via the street nearby. He didn&#39;t usually like cutting school like this, but he was direly uncomfortable, and if anything came of it, he was sure his parents would just smooth things over. He bit his lip and looked down at himself. He was unquestionably buffer than usual, and despite the fact he should be worried, he was distinctly pleased by this. Always wanted a bit more muscle...<br />
<br />
Though there was the obvious side effect of making his clothes not quite fit him any more. And they just didn&#39;t feel right on him besides. He ran a hand through his hair and tried to straighten it when he felt some of the kinks and light curls in his hair. Weird. He walked, occasionally trying to adjust his pants, even while his tank top seemed to conceal absolutely nothing, even as far as letting his abs slightly show through it.<br />
<br />
Alec found himself flexing again in front of a store window as he passed by it on his way to the local clothes stores in the market place. He didn&#39;t care for how deep and incredibly bronzed he looked, not really, but he guessed that was an in look now among celebs and people in tune with that. The others at school would give him shit for being so tanned up, but it wasn&#39;t such a bad look. After all, what mattered was his parents&#39; money and the fact that in his mind, he was still obviously white.<br />
<br />
With that bit of self convincing done, Alec kept going, walking with a decided swagger in his step. Some people he knew around the area didn&#39;t seem to recognize him at first, which he thought was kinda funny. He guessed that putting on this much muscle would have that kind of an effect. Alec even found himself wondering if his girlfriend would still be able to take him quite as well as usual.<br />
<br />
And that got him plumping up a bit in his pants. Alec for a moment tried to calm down, thinking unsexy thoughts, but then he decided, screw it, he was a big, buff guy. He didn&#39;t have anything to be shy about. He was not some awkward little shit trying not to stand out. He&#39;d flaunt it while it was up. And so Alec kept on moving, grinning in a rather cheeky way as he caught some female onlookers and even some dudes checking out the goods while it was hard.<br />
<br />
Usually Alec would have some harsh words for the guys he caught doing that shit, but today? Today he felt somewhat better about it. Let em. It&#39;s not like they were gonna be doing anything with him. If the gay guys wanna be checking him out, that just said he was so sexy, everybody wanted him. <br />
<br />
What Alec did not see was the fact that as he walked from store front to store front, his muscles if anything toned up even further, his shoulders etching themselves into a new relief like wide boulders on his body. A physique minded addition to his form. His biceps and triceps further sized up, and his forearms gained new meaty strength to keep up. His pecs pushed out more as he passed a food market, his eyes going to the various items on display. He needed some lunch after he was done getting his clothes.<br />
<br />
His back widened as he stretched it a bit to try to deal with how tight his shirt felt, and he groaned when he heard his back tear a small area in his shirt. Dammit, that was one of his bigger shirts too...<br />
<br />
His abs etched themselves tighter, stronger, and pushed out slightly. He was whether he liked it or not progressing from simply a wrestler to a physique minded specimen. His legs so as to keep up widened and broadened, calves developing a diamond like appearance, quads bulking up and pressing against his pants, the thighs likewise, leaving little room in there.<br />
<br />
Alec grumbled as he stopped, &quot;Really gonna need some Extra Large clothes...hot damn, I think I look pretty big...&quot; <br />
<br />
Before long, Alec was standing in the local market square and at the place where most of the clothes shops were set up. Quite a number of choices here. He crossed his arms, and then started to head to his usual place for getting new clothes. But in the midst of his walk, he found himself looking over at a place just opposite the usual place. A nice little trendy clothes store called Kings Apparel which seemed popular with African Americans. Alec usually would&#39;ve had a rude remark, but today he was knee deep in contemplation.<br />
<br />
He looked at the usual place.<br />
<br />
He looked at Kings Apparel.<br />
<br />
For some reason he felt there was a decision to be made here. He could stay with what he preferred, or he could go ahead and go outside his comfort zone a little. Wear some of the clothes in there, just to see what it was like. After all, he told himself, some of the clothes in there seemed made for big guys...</p>
