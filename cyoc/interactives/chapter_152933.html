<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hugo thought about the letter and realized their demands were absurd. If humans started dicking each other, how could Hugo control whether anyone knew the risk or not. Hugo wasn&#39;t god. He only had advanced technology. Sure Donshel could send out subliminal messages but even he couldn&#39;t guarantee that the whole world would know the risk.<br />
<br />
Similarly, Hugo had no way to guarantee that all parties would have consent and Hugo had no way to control the way in which humans exploited each other. Hugo did wish that there was a way to make sure all humans knew the risk and respected consent but then again, these were humans, lower life forms. They proved that by how easily they could be manipulated into being dicks and how quickly they accepted it as permanent. Humans were too primitive to understand concepts like consent or respect. So Hugo decided to ask for a dicking app that could be given away for free. The app would come with timers so that guys would think that they were dicking themselves temporarily but Hugo knew that the more they dicked themselves, the more they would want to dick themselves and want to set the timer for longer and longer periods of time until they all dick themselves permanently.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Zhawn was an Azam that had visited Earth decades ago in order to conduct experiments but Zhawn enjoyed the fact that he was so much bigger and more muscled than any Earth human. Zhawn abandoned his experiments and assumed a human identity permanently so he could compete as a professional body builder. Zhawn always won because his homan musculature was that much bigger naturally than any human. But even though Zhawn cut ties with his homeworld, Zhawn kept his ship and equipment hidden away so that Zhawn could monitor what homeworld was up to. When Zhawn intercepted a message to Hogo, Zhawn became concerned.<br />
<br />
If Hogo successfully dicked the entire population of Earth, how could Zhawn continue to win body building championships?<br />
<br />
Zhawn was pretty good at using computers himself. He wasn&#39;t the most brilliant hackers but than neither was Hogo. Zhawn hacked into Hogo&#39;s computer to get a list of all the dicked humans so far. He also gathered further information to determine who was happy about being dicked and who was not. Zhawn didn&#39;t care about humans anymore than Hogo did. If they wanted to be dicked, let them be dicked. Zhawn had even bought a dicked human of his own, an anonymous dick with no voice or other devices. The only thing Zhawn cared about was preventing all humans from being dicked. So he needed to find some that were not happy about being dicked so he could prove to homeworld that Hogo wasn&#39;t as successful as Hogo claimed to be.<br />
<br />
Zhawn was disappointed that there were gaps of missing information in what he got from Hogo. For example, there was one dick nicknamed whiskey dick that didn&#39;t even have a name. However, Zhawn didn&#39;t dare hack further for fear of getting noticed by Hogo. He had a good enough list with the names of Bryan, Brock, Dave, Jayden, William, Troy, Adam, Matthew, Isaac, Lucas, and Ryder.<br />
<br />
Zhawn&#39;s searching also found the names of people who hadn&#39;t been dicked but were not happy about the situation. Logan wanted his human boyfriend back. Elliot and a few other humans had friends who mysteriously disappeared around the same time as Hogo&#39;s experiments. Zhawn didn&#39;t know of these missing people had been dicked or not but the probability was good that at least a few of these missing individuals had gotten dicked.<br />
<br />
One thing that neither Zhawn nor Hogo knew was that there were a few errors in the data they had. Hogo&#39;s computer told Hogo that Ryder and Lucas were happy to be dicks even though they weren&#39;t but Zhawn&#39;s computer told Zhawn that Dave, Troy and Isaac were not happy to be dicks even though they were. Hogo had only meant for those that were happy to be dicks to become permanent but made Ryder and Lucas permanent by mistake. Zhawn meant to rescue only dicks that were not happy to be dicks but he set out to rescue Dave, Troy and Isaac by mistake.<br />
<br />
Zhawn had a list of people and dicks to find but did not know where they were. The first ones he found were Ethan, Bryan and Brock. Ethan was in the habit of wearing his brother most of the time. Since Ethan and Bryan were twins, no one noticed any difference because Bryan looked exactly like Ethan&#39;s old cock. Bryan had settled into his role as his brother&#39;s cock. He wasn&#39;t happy about it but he had gotten used to it and became quiet, so quiet that Ethan would have forgotten that his cock wasn&#39;t his cock but Brock kept reminding him. Brock still wanted his before and after photo.<br />
<br />
Ethan told his cock, &quot;We have to give Brock his photo to get him to shut up.&quot;<br />
<br />
So Ethan and Brock agreed to help Zhawn.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Hogo should have remembered that brainwashing isn&#39;t permanent. In the back of Dave&#39;s mind, the truth lurked, gnawing at him. He still believed that he and Jayden had agreed to be dicked together but he was haunted by the thought, &quot;What if Jayden is right? What if I did agree to be dicked if he lost?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jayden had been sold to a stranger. Dave had no idea where Jayden was. The stranger who owned Jayden than sold Jayden to a giant body builder who won every body building competition. Jayden overheard a lot of interesting conversations but no one could hear him talk about how unfair all this was.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Troy was having fun but his true desire was to pull pranks on others, to see others get dicked. His time with Noah was fun but not as much fun as he wanted.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Isaac was sold to a sex shop but the shop wasn&#39;t going to sell Isaac. The sex shop used Isaac to demonstrate sex toys and Isaac tried to convince customers to get themselves dicked. There was a bin in the sex shop that they wanted to fill with dicked people to sell.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Ryder wasn&#39;t sure who he was anymore. He had the memories of being Kai&#39;s cock. He had memories of fun times and quiet times in Kai&#39;s pants. He felt really close to Kai like he was a part of Kai&#39;s life. The problem was, he also had a life time of memories of being in Roman&#39;s pants and feeling like he was part of Roman&#39;s life. He also had this with Austin, Dakota, Dallas, Elam and the entire wrestling team. The only member of the wrestling team Ryder didn&#39;t feel like he was a part of, he wasn&#39;t a part of Ryder&#39;s life. He didn&#39;t have memories of fun times with Ryder or quiet times with Ryder. Ryder felt a distance between himself and Ryder.<br />
<br />
Every night, the team would get together and pass Ryder around. It was only supposed to be for one night but Ryder was now the team dick. He loved being so close to all his teammates. He&#39;d happily be their dicks again and again but there was someone missing. No matter how much Ryder loved being close to his teammates, he just couldn&#39;t feel complete until he got close to that missing teammate too. He couldn&#39;t feel complete until he got a chance to be Ryder&#39;s cock.</p>
