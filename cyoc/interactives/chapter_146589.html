<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Returning to the group, Kellie was trying to not stare too much at the changed Claudia. She was very different from the girl she knew before. Tall, muscular, busty, which was a good combination for Kellie&#39;s tastes. Though her becoming a red anthro tiger was rather surprising. And that extra equipment between her legs was...kinda alarming. Kellie was a proud lesbian, but even she blushed if she looked at Claudia&#39;s new sheath. The only part of Claudia that looked the same was her blonde hair and eyes. She also looked much more confident than the withdrawn Claudia that Kellie had first met in this timeline.<br />
<br />
Circe cleared her throat and said, &quot;Let us return to the matter of business at hand: my ambassador. Vixi can be brought back to life, but that will take time. And time is something we may not have to spare with the kitsune looking to avenge Yomi and Lilith getting ready to declare war on us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But isn&#39;t Lilith your ally?&quot; asked Kellie, &quot;Sure you can work out some sort of agreement with her?&quot;<br />
<br />
Baba Yaga chuckled and said, &quot;<i>Rebenka</i>, compromise is not in Lilith&#39;s nature. You know how she became what she is. She will not settle for equality. Inevitably, she will seek to dominate or destroy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And you were helping her make the dark side stronger,&quot; said Kellie accusingly.<br />
<br />
&quot;We were helping to restore the balance between dark and light,&quot; said Circe, &quot;And that&#39;s not the only sides that need balancing. There&#39;s the matter of order and chaos and some of us swing too wildly towards chaos.&quot; She gave an accusing look at Baba Yaga who just gave her a cheeky smile. &quot;Lilith isn&#39;t just the queen of darkness, she is entropy incarnate. She has always set herself against order, for light or darkness. So believe me, Lilith won&#39;t want to compromise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok, enough with the alignment talk,&quot; said Mika, &quot;What about your ambassador? I need to know who I&#39;m helping. If Vixi can&#39;t do it, you must have some other fox who can.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;True, some of my children have chosen to become foxes,&quot; said Circe, &quot;Though I haven&#39;t known them personally enough to know which one has the best diplomatic skills or capability to learn Japanese culture quickly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika sighed with frustration. &quot;And there&#39;s a chance I might forget to tell them something important. If only I could go to those peace talks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Circe stroke her chin thoughtfully, &quot;Hmm... actually, that is not a bad idea. Yes, cut out the middleman.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; asked Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;My dear, I could just make you my ambassador,&quot; said Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Me?!&quot; yelped Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? You already know your own people&#39;s customs and you have a diplomat&#39;s nature. All the remains is a fox&#39;s form that the kitsune will accept,&quot; said Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, I&#39;m not sure I want to be a fox,&quot; said Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Claudia, sounding a little hurt.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, what would my family think?&quot; asked Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your family, and the rest of the world, won&#39;t see a difference,&quot; said Circe, &quot;Except your sister, of course. Though she might choose to change herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; snapped Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;Relax, she&#39;ll only change if it&#39;s her own choice,&quot; said Circe, &quot;I&#39;m not twisting arms or brainwashing. Everyone who becomes one of my children does it by their own choice.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, there are still consequences,&quot; said Mika, &quot;Like how you&#39;ll own my soul.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not taking it once you&#39;ve changed, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking,&quot; said Circe, &quot;Your soul would only go to me if you die. I could bring you back to life, like Vixi, but that may take time. And if you&#39;re ready to leave the mortal world, I could arrange for you to go to the Elysian Fields. Though I&#39;ll have to talk to Hades about that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hades?&quot; asked Kellie with worry.<br />
<br />
&quot;He&#39;s actually a lot sweeter than modern culture depicts him to be,&quot; said Circe, &quot;Not much fun at the beach though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d want to pledge my eternal soul to you,&quot; said Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m not asking for it,&quot; said Circe, &quot;I just need you to be my ambassador until the kitsune problem is settled. Then you can be human again if you want. I only get your soul if you&#39;re one of my children when you die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There has to be more strings attached,&quot; muttered Mika.<br />
<br />
Claudia put a hand on Mika&#39;s shoulder and said, &quot;Mika, just give it a try.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika looked up at her changed girlfriend. This tigress form was a little overwhelming, but Mika still loved Claudia. Mika gave a sigh and said, &quot;Ok, I&#39;ll try it for a little while. But if I don&#39;t like it, I&#39;m changing back.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair enough,&quot; said Circe as light appeared in her hand, &quot;Imagine the vixen body that you want to have and keep it in your mind&#39;s eye.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mika closed her eyes and focused her imagination. &quot;Ok, I&#39;ve got it,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
With that, Circe gestured and the light flew from her hand to beam into Mika. Mika&#39;s clothes dissolved as fur started growing across her body. Though instead of red fur, her fur was jade green. Her feet became digigrated paws as a bushy fox tail grew out. Her hands gained claws and claws as her ears moved to the top of her head and changed shape. Her face grew out into a fox&#39;s muzzle, her teeth becoming sharper. Her body was also growing taller as her figure grew curvier. She didn&#39;t become as tall and muscular as Claudia, but her breasts, hips, and ass were easily the same size as the tiger&#39;s.<br />
<br />
When the transformation ended, Circe said, &quot;Well, quite a stunning vixen, if I say so myself.&quot; She conjured a mirror in front of Mika to look in.<br />
<br />
Mika looked in the mirror and did agree that the green fox was pretty sexy. But her attention quickly became locked on one thing. &quot;What is that?&quot; she asked, blushing through her fur. For between her legs was a rather obvious sheath.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I did tell you to picture the fox body you wanted,&quot; said Circe.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean for this,&quot; snapped Mika, &quot;It just...popped in there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, it may have been a subconscious desire,&quot; said Circe, &quot;A lot of people are surprised by what their subconscious wants.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But I can&#39;t talk to the kistune like this,&quot; said Mika.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re forgetting, they&#39;re Japanese. They&#39;ve seen things far stranger than hermaphrodite foxes. I doubt they&#39;ll care much if you&#39;re both male and female. If anything, they may be impressed,&quot; said Baba Yaga.<br />
<br />
Mika opened her muzzle to snap at Baba Yaga before pausing. There were far stranger yokai than kitsune. And she was quite aware of the perverse things that Japanese people have come up with. In fact, her brother has a hidden collection of hentai manga that Mika had looked. Some of that stuff can be pretty steamy and bizarre.<br />
<br />
Claudia hugged Mika from behind and said, &quot;I think you look amazing.&quot; Claudia was still taller than Mika, but not by as much now. Mika found herself enjoying being hugged. She could smell Claudia&#39;s arousal though thankfully their new equipment were still hidden.<br />
<br />
Claudia turned to Circe and said, &quot;Ok, I see your point. But I&#39;m not meeting with kitsune in the buff. I&#39;ll need to be fully dressed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy enough,&quot; said Circe, &quot;Now how about you two go get used to your new bodies?&quot; Claudia and Mika nodded before walking out of the room.<br />
<br />
Kellie rubbed her forehead and said, &quot;This is gonna be a migraine to tell Dad.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You need to relax more,&quot; said Baba Yaga, &quot;Too much stress will turn your hair grey early. Particularly if you&#39;re a sorceress.&quot;<br />
<br />
Kellie gave a long sigh and said, &quot;I just hope the others aren&#39;t doing anything stupid.&quot;</p>
