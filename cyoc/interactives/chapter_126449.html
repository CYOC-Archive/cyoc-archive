<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now Webber had been a hog farmer for decades so when he had the option to take this little piggy for free he jumped at it.<br />
<br />
But that initial desire for free pork soon faded.<br />
<br />
James was still human in his head but no one was able to hear him so he walked around his pen and ate what he had to to survive but he didn&#39;t fatten up.<br />
<br />
And that wasn&#39;t making Webber happy. He needed a big fat pig to make into sausages.<br />
<br />
Now having been a hog man all his life Webber knew some ways of getting the little porker to pile on the weight.<br />
<br />
The first was to put James in a smaller pen. <br />
<br />
He also had some drugs that he added to the slop that would increase the pigs appetite. <br />
<br />
And there were a few techniques to force feed the hog.<br />
<br />
And soon James was on the road to putting on tons of weight. <br />
<br />
He had easily doubled his weight from the end of the season and was heading for another double.<br />
<br />
James heard about the size he expected James to be before he ground him up into sausages and that seemed like it would have to be such a long way away but at the pace he was growing it seemed like it would be just a few more months.<br />
<br />
Thanksgiving came and went.<br />
<br />
Then Christmas was over.<br />
<br />
James sat in his little pen watching the fireworks go off in the distance wondering how much longer he had to live before he was sausages.<br />
<br />
And in the morning Webber came out to slop the hogs and to his amazement there in Jame&#39;s pen was the biggest fattest naked man he had ever seen laying on his side snoring like a train.<br />
<br />
Webber smacked him with a stick and started shouting at him. What the hell did you and your college friends do with my pig.<br />
<br />
Rubbing the sleep out of his eyes James looked up at Webber, a sight he had grown all too familiar with and said what?<br />
<br />
It was words James was speaking words again.<br />
<br />
At midnight the enchantment had ended at the end of the year. But all that fattening had taken it&#39;s toll on James&#39; body. He was huge. <br />
<br />
But he wasn&#39;t immobile even though he was over 1,000 pounds. It seems as though some of the muscle from the hog had transferred to him and he was able to lift himself up, as hard as that was. He stood up for the first time in months. His belly hung down and hid his penis in a load of fat pad. He had no neck. It wasn&#39;t even possible for him to have double chins. He had wrap around man boobs and looked like he had boobs at his back. His ass had grown massively.<br />
<br />
Where the hell are your clothes? Webber asked.<br />
<br />
I ... I don&#39;t know. <br />
<br />
James was truly stunned at his change.<br />
<br />
What did they do change you for my pig? I want that pig back you tell your friends I want him back.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t know what you are talking about James said.<br />
<br />
You mean they dropped you off here wasted?<br />
<br />
James didn&#39;t know what to say but shrugged and said that must have been what happened. He knew what had happened but how could he have explained that to this man.<br />
<br />
Here. Webber took James up to his house and wrapped him in a bed sheet since it was the only thing he had that would have fit James.<br />
<br />
I am going to call the cops. <br />
<br />
NO James protested.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t want anyone to see me like this.<br />
<br />
Webber thought it was because he was naked but James really mean that because he was so fat.<br />
<br />
Could I borrow a few bucks I will call a cab to take me home. <br />
<br />
Webber felt sorry for the boy and gave him a couple hundred dollars and told him to get an outfit.<br />
<br />
But I want that pig back if you find your friends tell them I want him back.<br />
<br />
James headed back to town but he couldn&#39;t go back home. He found a guy that liked fat men and was amazed at the size he was and still mobile. <br />
<br />
James had tried to lose the weight but the drugs and the feedings had trained him well to eat and he couldn&#39;t loose the weight. <br />
<br />
He never did find a pig for Webber but he found he enjoyed being a big fat hog of a man.</p>
