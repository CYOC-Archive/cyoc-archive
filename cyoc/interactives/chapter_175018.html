<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">His old friend, now identical twin brother, embraced him in a bear hug, and Mark was at a loss for words. Ever since he could remember, being a twin was a deep rooted desire. And since Aidan seemed more than willing to comply with that wish, he was struck dumb. He opened his mouth to speak but no words came out. Instead, he wrapped his arms tightly around new brother. <br />
<br />
Aidan was curious about having a twin himself, even if they only were alike in appearance. He was more than wiling to adopt Mark&#39;s looks and strength. Though, the sudden brotherly affection he was showing was only a half-truth. As his new twin was standing directly by his laptop, Aidan&#39;s now longer arm was just in reach of the keypad. As not wanting to draw Mark&#39;s attention, he cautiously moved the cursor to the text &#39;Mark Rules&#39; and deleted it. He then guided the cursor to the Save icon.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aidan, you don&#39;t know how happy this makes me. I&#39;ve always wanted a twin... a brother.&quot; Mark smiled. &quot;Now we really will be the best of friends. I wants us to be the closest twins ever, completely inseparable. We&#39;ll do everything together and nothing will ever come between us!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course dude!&quot; Aidan said as he selected save. A moment later, his profile updated with the &quot;Mark Rules!&quot; texted being erased, but that was not the only thing updated. <br />

<br />
&quot;Why are we sharing a profile!&quot; Aiden said as he pushed himself away from his best friend. He was attempting to get a better look and used too much force. Mark stumbled, and he felt himself being pulled along. Two steps away from the laptop, he managed to regain his balance. He noticed, to his horror, why he was also pulled off balance. Mark&#39;s left arm was wrist-deep in his shoulder. There was no blood or any wound. It was like his friend&#39;s arm was a part of his shoulder, and if he was not imagining it, his friend&#39;s arm seemed to be sinking deeper. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell happened to my arm!&quot; Mark screamed.<br />
<br />
Aidan noticed that his right arm seemed to have punctured a whole in his friend&#39;s shirt and meshed with his back. &quot;Oh shit! We&#39;re being merged together!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;What? Why the hell...&quot; Mark&#39;s sentence trailed off as he and Aidan shared a glance in horror, unsure of why this was happening. <br />
<br />
&quot;The computer... I have to type something!&quot; Aidan tried to walk towards the laptop, but he was stopped short as his right leg did not comply. Looking back, he saw that it had been joined to Mark&#39;s left, and it seemed to be shrinking. &quot;Come on!&quot; he pleaded with his friend, and they took a step towards the computer before their joint middle leg was no longer able to support them. They stumbled and crashed onto their backs which seemed to be quickly receding into one. He stared at his friend&#39;s equally frightened eyes. He wondered in horror, &#39;...Is this it? Are we going to disappear into one person.&#39;<br />
<br />
The process seemed to slow however. And to both of their relief, their heads remained apart; however, that seemed to be nearly the only thing unaffected. &quot;What happened to us?&quot; Mark spoke from beside him, seemingly in awe. <br />
<br />
Aidan felt an unfamiliar pressure along the center of his chest, as if something was trying to pull his upper torso. He pushed his left elbow into the carpet and tried his best to follow the movement. He watched Mark rise at the same time as him, and slowly, what was his and Mark&#39;s shared torso lifted off of the ground. Aidan stared at the one body lying on the ground before them. The one body which both of their heads were now joined to. Around them were the remains of the pair of jeans and shirt Mark was previously wearing. <br />
<br />
Aidan continued to stare in shocked silence. He had never glimpsed his friend&#39;s naked body before. Even while his original body was made identical in appearance, he did not have a good opportunity to explore it as he had more pressing concerns, like removing the statement that controlled him. Now, he was sharing his friend&#39;s body. <br />
<br />
&quot;How did this happen?&quot; His friend asked, seemingly rhetorically. <br />
<br />
Aidan&#39;s inquisitive mind had already been puzzling over the how and why questions, and he grumbled in response. &quot;It was the running of your mouth that did this!&quot; He raised his left hand to point an accusing finger, but as he was helping to balance their upright torso, they fell back onto the carpet. &quot;You wanted us to be &#39;completely inseparable&#39;... to do &#39;everything together&#39;. Well... I think you got what you wanted.&quot; <br />
<br />
Aidan felt the heat coming from Mark&#39;s checks as they flushed with embarrassment. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it literally.&quot; He stared up at the ceiling, seeming to avoid Aidan&#39;s eyes. After a few moment, a determination appeared. &quot;I want us to be completely separate twins in two bodies.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately, that won&#39;t work now. I kind of erased that command from my profile while you weren&#39;t looking.&quot; Aidan replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you do that?&quot; Mark glared at him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not!&quot; Aidan yelled back. &quot;You were abusing me!&quot; His friend seemed to be prepping for a comeback, but he clearly had nothing left to argue as Aidan had been right in his assessment. &quot;Putting that aside for now, we just have to get back to the laptop so we can undo this.&quot;</p>
