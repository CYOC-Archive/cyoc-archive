<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The quiet sound of shuffling around the room caused a very cranky Will to stir slowly to consciousness. His eyes peering open slowly, gazing around the room for the source of the noise. Finally he eased himself up, his head was pounding from how much he had to drink last night. Finding the source of the noise, he saw Marianne, their maid, with his changes happening he'd given all the help time off. The sudden realization sent a chill through him, he gasped in shock. He would die if the maid saw him in such a state, he froze hoping she would just go away.<br />
 <br />
The older woman turned, hearing the girlish gasp, a warm smile crossed her face. 'My she is a beautiful young thing, I didn't know Mr. Bower had cousins, they never visited that's for certain. Probably just came for money, but she looks pretty harmless to me.' Marianne thought to herself. &quot;Hello, Miss Vikki, I am Marianne Howzer, the maid of the house. You may call on me for most anything. Miss Megan informed me that herself and Mr. Bower left for their vacation quickly and had yourself and your brother Brian jetted here to watch the house. (Author's note, I messed up on the last chapter and had them referring to each other as cousins instead of brother and sister, sorry.) I was called back to help you with whatever you need, I leave at four, but can stay longer if needed.&quot;<br />
 <br />
A sigh escaped Will's lips, at least Megan had thought ahead about that part. But it mortified him that his own maid of five years didn't recognize him as the man he was in the least. &quot;Oh, thanks...it's uh.. nice to meet you. Could you get me some asprin, my head is killing me.&quot; His voice was no longer his, it was much softer and feminine now, definitely that of a young girl. The maid smiled at him and with a nod, exited the room. Once more sighing, Will pushed himself up to his knees, he looked down at himself. &quot;Oh come on, this is ridiculous, I shouldn't have to dress like a girl in my own house.&quot; He was wearing a pink nightie with bows and lace straps that showed off his soft arms, it dropped to his thighs. He was going to have to put his foot down about this clothing situation, he didn't want to be a chick.<br />
 <br />
Will continued his inspection, his feet seemed much tinier now and his legs seemed softer. He slowly got to his feet, taking it one step at a time because of the hangover. He worked his way to the large mirror, he shook his head this time. His Addams apple was completely gone, his face was almost unrecognizable, then again maybe he saw more of him than there was. His nose had turned up slightly and his lips were more pouty. Even his eyelashes and eyebrows had changed, thinning and growing in the feminine way. His hair was longer now, down to his shoulders and it had a slight natural curl to it. <br />
 <br />
The flowy garment hid his more flared hips, but did nothing to hide his increased bust. They'd filled out a very decent amount compared to the day before, they had to be a 32 B at this point, which now seemed a very dramatic increase to Will. He jumped as Marianne walked around the corner, covering his mouth in a way he realized was very girlish quickly put his hand to his side, as the older woman smiled with a slight chuckle, handing him the asprin and the glass of water. &quot;My you're a skidish little thing. Anyway, Miss Megan has told me that, not to be rude, you need help in the feminine department, so today you'll be on you're own, but tomorrow I'm to help you with dressing and grooming to make you a proper lady. Those are Miss Megan's wishes.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will was more concerned of how his new look was going to turn some heads at the office, than that of the old lady. He had nothing to do after today anyway, he wouldn't be able to pull off going in there, even trying on this day was quite risky. &quot;Thank you, Ms. Howzer, I'm going to get ready for work now, I look forward to seeing what you can do tomorrow.&quot; He lied, but he knew how Marianne would react if he said no, she'd insist it was her employer's wishes and do it anyway. She nodded. &quot;Your brother Brian brought your dry cleaning in, he said you would need it for work, I put it in the closet. Since I'll likely be gone by the time you're home, I'll see you in the morning.&quot; She gave Will a quick hug, almost mother-daughter in a way, it sent an odd chill down his spine.<br />
 <br />
Watching the attractive older woman leave, closing the door as she did. Will sighed in relief. &quot;That's going to be hell, I gotta get Megan to call it off...how did she do it in the first place...&quot; He shrugged, going for the closet, he grabbed the plastic wrapped clothing, holding it over his strap covered shoulder. Moving to the dresser next, he opened it up to find a pair of pink lace boyshorts. &quot;What is her obsession with pink for Pete's sake.&quot; There was absolutely nothing else in the drawer, he checked the others, again nothing.&quot; Sighing, he snatched the panties and headed to the bathroom. &quot;When will this nightmare be over with?&quot; <br />
 <br />
Megan was downstairs in the computer room. &quot;Alright, a one day pass for Will, everyone will think the way he looks is just fine not noticing any changes as strange. He'll follow my every word. But just today.&quot; She typed in her commands and pressed enter. In part it was because she had fun last night and he'd been through a lot, but mostly because it was his last day and the changes were undeniable at this point and it was all part of the bigger plan. A small part of her wanted to just tell Will and stop all this, she would debate it for a while.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Leaving the door open, Will put his clothes hanging on the towel rack, he quickly disrobed, throwing the nightie to the floor. In the mirror, his beautiful new body could be seen, but he didn't want to even glance. He wanted his manly body back. Stepping over to the shower, he turned it on, leaning against the cool granite as he waited for it to warm up. Slowly stepping in, he closed the glass door, which he'd always liked until this point, he felt exposed. Adjusting the shower head, Will now had to stretch to reach it, for the first time getting a clear picture of how much he'd now shrunk. Regardless the hot water felt great on his skin and he could almost relax, thoughts of the night before however flooded his mind. Thoughts of what he did and whom with, he shook his head, he couldn't fathom the idea that he actually did something with another guy and enjoyed it. &quot;Guess it's all part of this bodies package. He was kind of attractive.&quot; He said to himself admittedly.<br />
 <br />
As Will washed his body with the soapy water, he could see and feel more of his changes, his hips were rounder, his belly was now firm and flat. His body now had a more hourglass shape, his hands washed over his now softer, plump butt. &quot;I guess just one more day and I'll fill out completely.&quot; He thought and hoped at the same time, he didn't want to have a huge rack or anything like that. Though the weight on his chest suggested he already had the makings of decent breasts. He could tell his nipples were a little bigger and a shade darker than the night before. &quot;If it were on someone else, I could enjoy them.&quot; He touched them, noting a bit more of a sensitivity from them.<br />
 <br />
Having little choice, he didn't want to go into work with cigarette and beer smell stuck in his hair. Will decided to wash his now longer hair, knowing how long Megan's hair takes to dry made him skeptical of even trying, but again, little choice. As the shampoo rinsed out of his hair he put the conditioner on, before turning of the shower he felt his legs, they were still completely smooth and felt soft to the touch. He opened the glass door, grabbing his towel, he patted himself dry, his body was still so alien to him, he did it with care. Wrapping the towel around his waist, walking over to the mirror, he chuckled a little, seeing his breasts sway freely was actually entertaining to him. &quot;Forgot to cover up everything. But I gotta say, more woman should try this look.&quot; He giggled girlishly.<br />
 <br />
Shrugging off the towel completely, Will plugged in Megan's hair dryer and sighed. &quot;Alright, I've seen her do it a thousand times, it can't be all that hard.&quot; He turned it on full blast and began working his way through the wet hair with the brush and his hands, following the ways he'd seen Megan do it. He'd always found it very attractive that she did it in the nude as well, maybe it was just easier. After about five minutes, he was bending over to get the back of his head, he saw a flash briefly, he continued, thinking it was his imagination. Another flash, then another from the other side. He stood up, his mouth wide open.<br />
 <br />
A towering man stood behind Will, taking her picture with Megan's digital camera. Megan smirked, snapping another couple pictures of her surprised boy(now girl)friend. &quot;Wow, you're looking better every day, 'sis'.&quot; She slowly crept to the still half wet haired naked girl. &quot;Sorry about that whole thing, I think it would just seem weird that a couple would show up to watch the house and having Marianne keep 'tabs' on us will work out nicely. One more day of work that's all you can risk. I'll help you with you're hair when you're dressed.&quot; Megan leaned over and kissed Will passionately, pulling his new body closer to her's, she groped his feminine ass as his breasts poked into her firm chest. Will now had to be on his tip toes to kiss Megan properly.<br />
 <br />
As Megan pulled away, Will was still on his tip toes, she quickly snapped a picture as she backed up. Will slumped to his feet as she walked out. &quot;Damn it...&quot; How could he lose so much control, he was actually enjoying not being in control now. He huffed, turning the blow dryer back on and continuing. It took him a total of fifteen minutes to finally dry the hair. He turned off the hair dryer and immediately Megan entered. &quot;Just a minute, I want to get my underwear on first.&quot; Will grabbed the pink boyshorts, slipping them past his dainty feet, pulling them up his legs, the garment layed so ominously flat against his crotch nestling around and between his butt cheeks. He studied himself briefly in the mirror, they looked great with his legs.<br />
 <br />
Next, Megan grabbed some medical tape from the medicine cabinet. &quot;We'll have to tie those puppies down today. As great as they look, everyone will notice.&quot; That was of course not true, but she still wanted him to go through the paces. She started to wrap the tape around his substantial breasts.&quot; This'll probably get tighter later, you'll have to redo it. It'll take about five minutes to redress, so make sure you wait until you need to or someone might notice.&quot; She said in a deep voice as she breathed warmly into Will's ear, kissing his neck. Will pivoted on his leg inwardly, feeling a tingle of excitement.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Simply nodding, Will felt excitement as Megan kissed his neck, she slowly wrapped his breasts. Megan smirked. &quot;We can do more of that later, don't want Marianne to get wind of who we really are. Just remember to call me before you leave work, I might want you to do something for me on the way back here.&quot; Will just nodded as she finished up, his breast were compressed, if they kept growing like they had before, he'd be changing it by noon at best. Megan helped Will get dressed next, it was a black and white pin stripe suit, it fit nicely on Will's new body. Pulling the pants up his legs, he felt the light fabric against his legs. He was about to protest that it rode higher in the crotch and would definitely be noticed as girls clothes. &quot;Hush now.&quot; <br />
 <br />
Next she pulled on his blouse which looked manly enough, it was white, button down, but it was his size so it was pretty tiny, it pinched in at the waist giving it a feminine curve. &quot;These are all very manly to you, aren't they.&quot; Will nodded at her question/statement. She smiled, pulling the jacket over his small arms and over his shoulders, buttoning the front button. Again it was very feminine attire but to Will it looked like a very nice business suit. &quot;What do you think? Is it better than what I've been making you wear?&quot; Asking with a wry grin on her face.<br />
 <br />
Posing in the mirror a bit, Will smiled for once. &quot;Yeah, finally something that fits and isn't super girlish. I feel like James Bond!&quot; He smiled back at her through the mirror. Megan thought to herself. 'Maybe more like a Bond girl, but it works.' &quot;Okay, you know how to walk in these.&quot; She said helping Will step into his 4&quot; heel with a 1&quot; platform, they were open toed and showed off his still pink painted toes, which he hadn't noticed his fingers were still painted the same color. Strapping his ankles into his heels, she stood up next to a slightly taller Will. &quot;See this will make your height situation less noticeable.&quot; Helping Will with applying small amounts of make up and lip gloss, she next finished with the hair, leaving it down, it was long and perfectly blonde. &quot;Wait until Marianne makes you do this yourself, she'll have you behaving like a girl in no time.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Will knew that for some reason he didn't look proper but each time he thought about it Megan's voice distracted him. &quot;Okay, well I'm already late for work, I've got to run. I'll give you a call later.&quot; Will kissed Megan on the lips quickly and walked off, the clicking of his new heels, could be heard through the hallway. He got to his car placing his bag and briefcase in the car as he entered. Even with the heels he had to move the seat up so he could drive. &quot;Man that's so annoying, why can't she put the seat back where it was.&quot; He huffed, closing the door and speeding off to work.<br />
 <br />
Pulling up to his parking spot, Will took a few deep breaths and mentally readied himself for the day ahead. He opened the car door and swung his legs out, grabbing his things as he slowly clicked his way to the entrance, not even aware of it. Brushing his hair behind his ear as he walked, Will entered the building, his face awash with anxiety. &quot;I hope this suit does the trick.&quot; He walked by a few people, nodding, they nodded back naturally. A sigh of relief escaped Will's delicate lips, the heels made his hips sway as he walked. 'It's working, thank god Megan didn't give me any girly clothes to wear today.'<br />
 <br />
Walking toward his office, Will was greeted by his secretary Melinda, she smiled. &quot;Hello Mr. Bower, you're running a little behind. Did you need me to reschedule any meetings for you? Nice suit, it looks great on you.&quot; She said with a smirk.<br />
 <br />
&quot;No, I think I can manage. Thanks my...girlfriend...bought it for me.&quot; Will stated, feeling a little weird that Megan was no longer that, but a handsome man. &quot;Take a memo please; I'll be going on a leave of absence from work for an unknown amount of time. In which time Jacob Selnir will be in charge of all projects effective at the close of today's business.&quot; Will nodded as Melinda finished typing. &quot;Send it out immediately.&quot; Melinda nodded sending the document to everyone in the office.<br />
 <br />
At around 11 AM, Will sat in his office, going over notes for his meeting with the swim wear company his office was hired to help promote and advertise. He had to do this right or there wouldn't be a second chance. Jacob knocked on Will's door, walking in almost immediately. &quot;Sue quit this morning, said she was having a baby, wanted to focus on her family. So the new boss will be needing a new secretary, don't ya think?&quot; He said with a laugh, taking a seat across from his friend.<br />
 <br />
Chuckling, Will just shook his head. &quot;That's you always thinking about your secretary before your work. You can have Melinda till I get ba..&quot; Jacob cut him off. &quot;Ah, Melinda works just as hard as you, I think she should get time off with pay for what she does for you.&quot; Will smirked, shaking his head. &quot;Right, fine. Go ahead, you're in charge now anyway.&quot; They laughed. &quot;So I see you're taking my advice about getting away. You and Megan going to rekindle some of that old passion, huh? Who's going to watch the old Mansion...cuz I could definitely have some fun there.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Staring for a brief moment, Will couldn't find the words to say. &quot;Uh, right, we're going to the Bahamas, all those beaches..haha, you know how good Megan looks in a swim suit.&quot; He thought again for a moment before speaking. &quot;My cousins Brian and Vikki Chandler will be watching the place while we're gone. But you know you're always welcome to stop by.&quot; He shut up quickly, suddenly thinking that was a bad idea. Jacob thought for a moment. &quot;Didn't know you had cousins, but I guess I never asked. Sounds good though man, I probably will.&quot; He stood, shaking Will's hand, it seemed so small compared to Jacob's, and even as he stood, the heels left him short of Jacob by quite a bit. &quot;The meetings in twenty minutes, I'll see ya there man.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Watching his friend exit, Will thought of how short and tiny he'd become. Shaking his head, he grabbed his things and continued his work until he needed to leave for the board room. As he walked, he noticed the feeling of his breasts straining the medical wrap was starting to cause him quite a bit of pain, he was able to ignore it till that point. &quot;Damn, I don't have time to change it, I'll just have to stick it out.&quot; He said entering the room, it was still empty, he quickly set his things down. If he worked quickly he could readjust the wrap in time. He undid his jacket and shirt, quickly unraveling the wrap, the pain slowly diminished as it came completely off, his breasts swaying freely. They looked slightly bigger, maybe a 36 B-cup now. <br />
 <br />
Will gently rubbed his tender breast, he heard voices and quickly dumped the wrap into the garbage, buttoning his shirt as several men entered. His face was flushed as he finished buttoning his shirt, completely forgetting his jacket. His unrestrained breasts filled out his dress shirt, causing his nipples stiffen and rub against the rougher fabric, a slight tingle spread through Will. He greeted everyone and began to talk as the meeting began, standing, the jiggling of his breasts distracted him, but he continued. &quot;I see that with our help, in six months you can gain higher revenue on your product, after all, you want to sell to a more mainstream clients. We have a model lined up for the gig to be the star of our promotions. She's gorgeous, and will sell more swimsuits than you can imagine.&quot; He stated that for a fact, the girl was phenomenal looking. A stray thought of himself and if guys thought of him like that because of his new gender.<br />
 <br />
He went onto speak more of what the promotions would entail and the basics of what he intended to accomplish by advertising for them. All the while not realizing that his dark nipples were visible through the fabric.  &quot;Give me a month and we can get everything set up.&quot; The man smiled and nodded. &quot;Alright Mr. Bower, you have our business, but I need shooting to begin by the end of the week, I will give you whatever means you need. Do we have a deal.&quot; Will thought it over briefly, looking to Jacob, seeing as he'd be the one in the hot seat soon. Jacob smiled and nodded confidently, Will could only smile, looking over to his newest client. &quot;We're in business, Mr. Milovich.&quot; He stood, shaking Milovich's hand as well as his partners, everyone clapped. <br />
 <br />
Everyone chatted for a bit, talking about the presentation and what was expected. Will felt semiconscious that his breasts were swaying unrestrained under his shirt as he talked and laughed. He felt like all the guys were staring at them, he crossed his arms over his chest, unknowingly causing him to press his breasts together. His shirt was unbuttoned from earlier, just enough to show off his unhindered cleavage to everyone. As he laughed, he felt his breasts jiggle under his arms, a sudden realization hitting him, he looked down seeing the mounds of soft flesh trapped by only the fabric of his shirt. Quickly placing his arms to his side. &quot;Uh, excuse me gentlemen, I have some things I must attend to.&quot; He said, blushing furiously, they didn't seem to notice anything however. <br />
 <br />
Grabbing his jacket and briefcase, Will walked out of the board room and back toward his office. He threw everything onto his couch, sighing as he was finally done with this stupid project. He took a seat behind his desk finishing up what he thought needed to be done before leaving. A few hours past, in between he'd been able to go check for the wrap in the boardroom but the garbage had been changed already. The suit to him and everyone else in the office was sufficient in discussing his ample breasts, he thought.<br />
<br />
Will had gone about his day like it were normal for the first time in a week. Chatting with his co-workers and having a blast, he knew he looked very much like a girl but no one seemed to care, not even himself. He was complimented more times than not on his clothing and shoes, even his hair. &quot;Those shoes look great on you, you look cute in pink.&quot; Said an office girl. Will simply smiled and thanked her for the complement, it didn't bother him as much as it should have. He felt a little pride in his appearance.<br />
<br />
A sigh of relief came over him when the time reached five o'clock, he was relieved. Saying his goodbye's to everyone, it seemed like he gave a few dozen hugs. He chuckled. &quot;Well, thanks everyone, have a great weekend, I'll try and get back as soon as I can.&quot; They all wished him well as he walked out the door, he knew that his business would be well, but he wondered if he'd ever be able to return as himself ever again. As he walked out to his car he decided to....</p>
