<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The announcement that city elections had assured that the department would ultimately get the funds to pay for a permanent DARE officer was a good announcement for Officer Barnes and I, and I carried that announcement with me on my way home. As Officer Barnes and I left Officer Howard's office, we had some sense of relief at that. We would have to stay with the DARE program until the replacement DARE officer arrived, but the fact that a permanent DARE officer would be hired was a relief to us. Officer Barnes had made it clear that he preferred patrol work to being a &quot;desk jockey&quot; and the replacement DARE officer would allow Officer Barnes and I to return to our &quot;normal&quot; assignments.<br />
<br />
And as we made our way out, we found exactly what Officer Jenkins had been startled when we went into Officer Howard's office by what Megan had been coloring. Officer Barnes with his day off was doing his part in their relationship, which meant looking after Megan. So when when he had got the call from Officer Howard, he brought Megan with him, probably to give her grandmother some time to relax. It was a good &quot;father&quot; sort of moment, even if Officer Barnes wasn't Megan's biological father. And he had left her for a moment with Officer Jenkins while we had received the latest update on what had gone on in relation to the elections.<br />
<br />
And as we came out, we found what had gotten Officer Jenkins to make her earlier surprised gasp. Megan colored a crude picture of a tiger across one of the sheets on which the police reports were supposed to be written. It wasn't all that realistic as there was no white in the image, but I supposed that from a parental standpoint, they couldn't do all that much about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what raised all the commotion out here?&quot; Officer Barnes inquired as we returned to where Officer Jenkins was, with Megan still in her lap.<br />
<br />
&quot;I colored a picture,&quot; Megan held up page she had colored.<br />
<br />
&quot;There was a bit of confusion over what copy paper was,&quot; Officer Jenkins sighed and gave a slight chuckle.<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;and you drew a zoo tiger over the police reports...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not a zoo tiger,&quot; Megan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then who is it?&quot; I gave a question.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's the Tiger-Lady, see she's standing up...&quot; Megan pointed the details of her picture, &quot;I was gonna put you and me in too but Mommy said I couldn't color on that paper.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd think that one sheet is beyond saving,&quot; Officer Barnes commented, &quot;Not to bad for artwork, eh?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm wondering why she has Molly naked,&quot; I commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's for a party,&quot; Megan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;A party?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A fur party,&quot; Megan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;People aren't allowed to go anywhere naked, dear,&quot; Officer Jenkins told her, &quot;no matter how much their fur covers them up.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd just leave it as a zoo tiger,&quot; I told her and rubbed her head playfully, &quot;mundane animals don't have to wear cloths.&quot;<br />
<br />
Megan looked at the picture again and sighed, &quot;Okay... but don't you want a picture of us all together?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you can get a sheet of copy paper to draw it on, Molly and I wouldn't mind the gift,&quot; I told her, as our fridge and things had countless drawings of tigers or anthropomorphic tigers drawn by the kids that wanted to give the &quot;Tiger-Lady&quot; a gift, &quot;just make sure everyone is appropriately attired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Megan answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the meantime, though,&quot; Officer Barnes cut in, &quot;Megan we need to get going. Your mom still has work to do, and you need to keep me in shape.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay!&quot; Megan hopped down, turned and nuzzled Officer Jenkins again before moving to take Officer Barnes' hand. <br />
<br />
The two then made their way out, letting me only chuckle. It presented a wonderful family image, and made me pray that Molly and I would be able to have such a family of our own. That the Animatrix Serum hadn't done anything truly wacky.<br />
<br />
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
<br />
Molly had returned to the cabin by the time I made it back to the cabin. She had put the food purchases away and was watching TV as I came in.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, how did your meeting go?&quot; Molly asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pretty good,&quot; I managed to shrug, &quot;the city council approved Officer Howard's budget for hiring a permanent DARE and dispatch officer and submitted it to the budget to Helena.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Did Officer Howard get any answer from them?&quot; Molly wondered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not directly, but he feels confident he'll get the money to hire them,&quot; I managed, &quot;though it could take some time. If it's done quickly, Officer Barnes and I could be back permanently on patrol duty by January... if not... if not, we'd be looking at finishing out this year with the DARE program.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Not that that's a bad thing,&quot; Molly reminded me, &quot;You're not chasing a bunch of guys with some sort of agenda and a gun in the DARE program.&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded. That was a perk of the DARE program, even if I would have preferred directly working to keep the streets clean.<br />
<br />
&quot;I never said it was bad,&quot; I told Molly as I sat down next to her.<br />
<br />
She nodded and we settled into watching a little television. We watched quietly before something we were watching reminded me of Megan's artwork, and the feelings it placed in the back of my mind. And with that reminder, I told Molly about it.<br />
<br />
&quot;She wanted it to be me?&quot; Molly asked after I'd finished.<br />
<br />
I nodded.<br />
<br />
&quot;But she had me naked?&quot; Molly continued.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't fully know why she had that idea,&quot; I told her, &quot;and while part of me would like to be there to see Officer Jenkins and Officer Barnes... I did urge her to have the drawing be of a zoo tiger rather then you, me, or her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly slowly nodded, &quot;What do you think they'll say to her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; I shrugged, &quot;though it made for an interesting moment... and rather cute, in an odd way.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly nodded, &quot;cute... and we both want something like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A family of our own,&quot; I nodded, &quot;yeah...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So, what should we do?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;Doc Stimson might have the knowledge of our hormones and stuff... the doctors might have the right tests... Leon would have the right scientific knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
I sighed looked up toward the television. It was still on, but for the moment, I wasn't really watching what was on. I had been thinking about all that, and I didn't have a full answer that. After a moment I sighed and decided to take the quickest course of action.<br />
<br />
&quot;It'd probably best to call Leon,&quot; I sighed after a moment, &quot;He knows more about what the Animatrix Serum does then anyone... and besides, we haven't heard anything from him since he married Jacki.&quot;<br />
<br />
Molly slowly nodded and turned off the television.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then let's go call him,&quot; Molly said, &quot;find out if there is some legitimate fear or whether or not we've been worrying over nothing...&quot;<br />
<br />
I nodded and got up. Molly went along with me, and we went upstairs. Once in our room, we approached the the desk and &quot;office area&quot; that we had set up up there. Once there, I picked up the phone and began to dial a number. Figuring that they wouldn't have Leon at work on a Saturday, I called the home number that Molly and I had. It was Jacki who answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Washburn residence, Jacki speaking,&quot; came Jacki's voice on the other end of the line.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello, Jacki,&quot; I spoke into the phone, while holding it so that it was between Molly and I. That way both of us could hear. &quot;This is George and Molly calling. Is Leon home?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Leon left for work over an hour ago, George,&quot; Jacki answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;On a Saturday?&quot; I asked, the fact that Jacki was at home was not registering with me.<br />
<br />
&quot;One could ask the same of you, George, unless they don't have you on duty on weekends,&quot; Jacki retorted.<br />
<br />
&quot;They have me doing DARE work at the moment,&quot; I told her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun with the kids,&quot; Jacki advised, before giving a short pause, &quot;anyway, Leon had work today. You two can probably catch him there. Do you need the number?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we have Leon's work number,&quot; Molly spoke, &quot;sorry to trouble you at home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's alright,&quot; Jacki answered, &quot;How are things with you two? They good?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah we're good,&quot; I told her, &quot;we just have a few questions for Leon.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then,&quot; Jacki answered, &quot;I won't hold you up.&quot;<br />
<br />
And with that, she hung up. Giving a shrug to Molly, I hung up and dialed again, this time dialing the number that would get through to Leon's lab. The phone rang twice before Leon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello?&quot; came Leon's voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Leon!&quot; Molly spoke first, &quot;this is Molly and George. We have a question for you, do you have a moment?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;At the moment, yes, what do you need?&quot; Leon asked back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well... you know that Molly and I want a family of our own, right?&quot; I asked into the phone.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, you've both mentioned that,&quot; Leon replied gave a short paused and then asked, &quot;Is Molly pregnant?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, that's sorta what our question relates to,&quot; I answered, &quot;and this may be over nothing... but we were wondering if there were any sort of complications that Animatrix Serum might have had... you know if all the assorted hormones and such couldn't take the strain of transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're asking of the serum made you sterile?&quot; Leon asked. I could swear I heard him laugh in the background.<br />
<br />
&quot;We've managed to overcome the major difficulties that have been in the way of having a family,&quot; I answered, &quot;You know... R.A.M. and that lot, settling in, etcetera etcetera...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And once we got to the point where we've gotten to the point where we'll be ready that fear just sorta came up,&quot; Molly continued, &quot;Like we've come so far only to find out that it was never possible to begin with...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're worrying over nothing,&quot; Leon answered, &quot;the Animatrix Serum may not do what I had originally intended it to do, but its consequences are not that dramatic. Believe me, I did the tests on myself when I was still Leona. And it will work well with both strains. You two are both fully capable of conceiving and raising a litter of tiger cubs in Montana, you both only have the Animal strain. The gender strain also works perfectly. A man could become a woman, get pregnant, and nine months later give birth. Or a woman could become a man and father his own kids. The Animatrix Serum changes how your reproductive systems work... it does not affect whether or not they work. Trust me, Jacki and I know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Jacki knows?&quot; Molly asked, &quot;you've taught her some of your science stuff?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the basics, but that's mostly conversational type stuff,&quot; Leon answered, &quot;Jacki knows from experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Experience?&quot; I asked, and then something dawned on me, &quot;she's not...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She is presently five months along with triplets, about the average size for a Lion,&quot; Leon answered.<br />
<br />
&quot;But you both had said you were too old to have kids,&quot; Molly spoke.<br />
<br />
&quot;I had thought so too,&quot; Leon answered, &quot;but Jacki went into heat... and I... well let's just say that Jacki smelled very good for about a week and we mad A LOT of noise.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure,&quot; was all I could manage.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it'll be fine,&quot; Leon said with a sigh, &quot;I hadn't planned on being a father... but that plan's as good as dead, as Jacki has three cubs in her that are mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And so you'll have your own little pride,&quot; Molly commented.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Leon's voice responded, &quot;so don't the two of you worry about whether or not you can have kids. You can, Jacki and I have more the proved that... and I don't she's the only Animal-Person that is either pregnant or will be pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; Molly gave a sigh, &quot;thank you... oh, and congratulations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're welcome,&quot; Leon answered, &quot;If you want, I can send you some photographs, Molly... let you know what you'll be in for. Don't worry, they're all tasteful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, we can't wait,&quot; Molly answered, &quot;thank you again.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No problem.&quot;</p>
