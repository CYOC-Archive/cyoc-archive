<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;How far along I am?&quot; you asked to Head-Sister Julie,  and glanced down at the large breasts on your chest and the long scaled tail beneath you, &quot;I&#39;d think it&#39;s rather obvious that right now I&#39;m a siren...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Your physical transformation is complete, that is always quick,&quot; Head-Sister Julie answered, &quot;but the mental adaptation for a human male to changing gender and becoming siren is usually longer and the full development of siren magic can be even longer than that... In fact it&#39;s usually a full four days before a transformed human is actively producing siren magic at the same level as a normal siren...&quot;<br />
<br />
You wondered if this was related to what you had talked with Sally and the other Council Members at the Council Meeting. Your mind was not only adapting to your physical form being female and a mermaid besides, but it was also becoming a female mind... a siren&#39;s mind. You&#39;d noticed some of it, wanting to be Elizabeth&#39;s friend and quite willingly accepting her friendship, even though you knew that before you learned that your wife was a siren as well, that she would kill you if you didn&#39;t transform her. In many ways it was as if you were accepting being female and even wanting to stay a siren. At first it was begrudging and only because you didn&#39;t want to die. Soon it was accepting Elizabeth as a sister tinged with the optimism that you&#39;d be human again eventually. By the morning, you were quite willing to feed three men to your pregnant wife with your only &quot;objection&quot; being wanting to make sure you didn&#39;t feed your friends to your wife. Later you were even willing to help Elizabeth feed before the three of you swam to the council meeting. <br />
<br />
Even with the agreement to consider Elizabeth a &quot;sister,&quot; you still had only just met her. Most people wouldn&#39;t normally consider doing things like that for those they just met. As you thought on that, you began to realize just how much your mind had really changed. At first, the only reason you were willing to be a mermaid was to avoid being killed, but now, if Selene wanted you to be siren with her, you privately realized that you wouldn&#39;t mind remaining a siren. The only thing you knew that seemed to ease the male part of your mind that was still there was that Selene wanted you to be Michael again as well. And a part of your mind, at that knowledge, promised to do anything to make Selene happy, even if it meant being male again.<br />
<br />
Head-Sister Julie, meanwhile, continued her explanation, &quot;and at present... I can sense a lot of siren magic being generated by you... a lot more than should be expected from a siren who&#39;s only been a siren for around twenty four hours.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Could that be the result of what that other Head Sister did to transform him?&quot; Jake asked from where he floated in the pool, with Emily now helping to keep his head above the surface of the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;It could be,&quot; Sally spoke for her mother, &quot;but the method Head Sister Florencia used is so odd that we really don&#39;t know... the method she used could result in the greater generation of siren magic or accelerated the time it takes for the mental adaption to occur and for Michelle to begin producing siren magic... or it could be residue left over from Michelle&#39;s transformation...&quot;<br />
<br />
Sally then paused to look over to her mother, who had come into the pool while you were explaining to Emily and Jake, and the gathered sirens and Sally&#39;s father how you were transformed.<br />
<br />
&quot;And there could be other factors that could potentially accelerate the process as well,&quot; Head Sister Julie spoke, &quot;and Michelle... Michael... you&#39;re producing a lot more siren magic than you should be at this time... a lot more...&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a bit of a gulp, &quot;Well... I think I am adapting to it... mentally, I mean...&quot; you said slowly.<br />
<br />
&quot;How do you feel about Elizabeth?&quot; Head Sister Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I love her like I would love a sister, but that&#39;d be something I do even if I were male... to protect her... be her friend... to support her... that sort of thing,&quot; you answered nervously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Human males can,&quot; Julie replied, &quot;but there are limits to what they would do... suppose she was incapacitated and couldn&#39;t move her legs or her tail, depending on where she is... and she needed to feed... the siren way. What would you do?&quot;<br />
<br />
You glanced over to Elizabeth and the image of her in pain or unable to move made your eyes tear up a little and you then gulped, &quot;I&#39;d do what I&#39;d need to keep her alive and try to heal her... even... even if it means bringing her men to feed on... I...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Michelle, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Elizabeth said to you and Selene clutched you tightly, as if to reassure you.<br />
<br />
&quot;And how do you personally feel about men?&quot; Julie asked, &quot;sexually, I mean... please be honest...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I love Selene,&quot; you answered, &quot;I want to be a man again... I don&#39;t want to think about that right now.&quot;<br />
<br />
You could feel some depression creep into Selene&#39;s attitude, and you knew that by your answers, you were rapidly on your way to the completion of the mental and &quot;magical&quot; parts of your transformation. You answers were confirming to your wife that mentally you&#39;d practically be no different than she was.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand that&#39;s what you want... to make your wife and Head Sister happy,&quot; Julie told you, &quot;but what do you want...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I&#39;m not opposed to it... it&#39;s odd and I&#39;d prefer to be with Selene... but if I had to feed and had no other option... I wouldn&#39;t be that opposed to it,&quot; you said weakly.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, you&#39;d accept having sex with a man if you had to,&quot; Julie summarized, &quot;though you&#39;d prefer to remain with your wife...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; you almost whimpered. You could now feel that depression seeping into Elizabeth now as Selene and you both began to feel the recognition at how much you&#39;ve changed. &quot;This won&#39;t affect my ability to be Michael again?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If your changing feelings and the rapidly development of your siren magic is only a result of what Head Sister Florencia did to transform you, it should have no problem,&quot; Julie answered, and came closer to both you and Selene. The other Head Sister and gynecologist placed one hand on your shoulder and then another hand on your stomach, &quot;but there could be other reasons...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your eyes widened and you thrashed your tail to slide backward in the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! I can&#39;t be pregnant!&quot; you practically screeched.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s very possible, Michelle,&quot; Julie said firmly, &quot;I can feel the siren magic coming off you at a rate far greater than a freshly transformed should be giving off... and you are rapidly adapting to the fact that you at present ARE a siren... and physically you are fully formed siren with all the biological equipment to become pregnant. Now... when a woman becomes a siren, their ovulation cycle remains the same as when they were human. But you were a man... and since you&#39;ve never had anything like it before... it will be hard to predict when you will ovulate. Some transformed men ovulate  almost immediately after becoming female and some don&#39;t ovulate until almost a month later. It depends on the individual... and to me... the signs point that you could be pregnant... and the pregnancy is why your siren magic and your acceptance of what you&#39;ve become is so rapid....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mom...&quot; Sally said slowly, &quot;the method Head Sister Florencia used is unorthodox and is intended for the new siren to begin producing siren magic.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That could be, but unless Michelle, here, or Elizabeth know the exact wording of the spell or were attuned to how much magic Michelle was producing before she fed for the first time, you can not be one hundred percent sure,&quot; Julie countered, &quot;and in my experience... sirens producing this much siren magic are pregnant. Head Sister Florencia could have done it, but as you say the method is unorthodox... which could mean almost anything... there are too many variables in this, and I&#39;d like to narrow things down as much as we can.&quot;<br />
<br />
You whimpered as you listened to this.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to me Michael again,&quot; you said weakly, and began to cry.<br />
<br />
Julie paused her argument with her daughter to turn back to you. She looked at you calmly and with a great deal of understanding in her eyes. Sally looked like she didn&#39;t fully agree with her mother&#39;s diagnosis, but wasn&#39;t saying anything more at the moment. Julie came slowly forward and took your hands in her own.<br />
<br />
&quot;And if the spell can be reversed that shouldn&#39;t be a problem,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;but you will have to wait nine months to give birth... and at the moment, I don&#39;t know for sure. Pregnancy could explain it... but there could be other explanations... I&#39;d like to run a few tests on your blood to make sure.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My blood?&quot; you asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sirens and human females produce the exact same hormone when pregnant,&quot; Julie answered, &quot;and as I said, it results in a spike in their levels of siren magic. It&#39;s how I knew your wife was a fellow siren when she came in for her first appointment. I would have mentioned it directly to her then... but you were commonly with her, and figured revealing our kind&#39;s existence was best left to Selene, not me... the major difference between sirens and human women is that a siren will begun producing that hormone quicker than a human woman would and will produce much more. Enough that a pregnant siren could trigger the sensors after a matter of hours, which is why I want to run the test. That will allow Sally and the Council to get a clearer picture as to why you are producing so much siren magic... are you pregnant... or a result of the spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
You gave a sigh and brought your hands up to your stomach. You shook a little.<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay,&quot; you said weakly. &quot;Do you have a towel so I can dry off first?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Julie replied, &quot;Frank and I keep more than enough towels down here.&quot;</p>
