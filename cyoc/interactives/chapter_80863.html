<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Matt scrolled through, astounded by how detailed the program was. The guy he thought was his childhood friend <br />
turned out to actually be a kid who had used it to become a teenager. Not only that, but had made it so <br />
everyone was aging 5 years every day. Thinking about it, Matt didn't want to wait that long to be older, <br />
especially now he had something that could make him any age he wanted. He had often dreamed of this exact <br />
situation and knew exactly what to do now. He pulled up the age option on his profile, and made an extreme <br />
change to his age that most people would never consider doing and hit enter, hoping it really worked.<br />
<br />
&quot;So what did you go for then?&quot; Jay questioned.<br />
<br />
&quot;I changed my age. Your 5 years a day thing is too slow for me. I want to be older now. Much older.&quot; Matt <br />
replied, smirking at himself. Jay was about to ask just how old he chose when the changes started.<br />
<br />
Matt felt itchy all over. He took off his shirt to see hair growing over his torso, starting in the centre of <br />
his chest and quickly flourishing outwards, giving him a satisfying coating. He brought a hand up to feel the <br />
new body hair. Another hand went to his face as he felt the scruff on his face had thickened considerably, <br />
lengthening into what felt like an impressive beard for a man his age. Or at least he guessed for whatever age <br />
he currently was. He had to find a mirror. The bathroom was just around the corner from Simon's room. He ran <br />
in and saw a hirsute man of about 25 years old standing in his place. He had hair all over, comparable to his <br />
friend's grandfather whom he'd admired for a while now. He had packed on some muscle under the mat of hair <br />
covering his body but Matt knew that wouldn't last long. Jay tried to follow Matt into the room, but Matt <br />
closed the door in his face and locked it. He didn't want his friend seeing him just yet.<br />
<br />
Now he was alone, he pulled off his pants and grabbed his large cock with one of his meaty hands, ready to <br />
wank. He'd fantasized about this happening to him many a countless night, but he didn't expect his fantasy to <br />
actually become true. He looked like he'd entered his thirties now, gray hairs popping up at random throughout <br />
his facial hair. The hair on his head was starting to recede now, slowly retreating back towards the bald spot <br />
that was appearing. He rubbed his cock furiously, knowing it could be his last erection he might ever get. The <br />
muscular physique he had in his twenties was already diminishing. His abs had disappeared behind a layer of <br />
fat, his stomach bulging slightly. He put a hand to his head, feeling the hair underneath disappear, leaving <br />
behind bare skin. Within a few minutes, he'd gone from a full head of hair to being completely bald, a thin <br />
horseshoe shaped layer of greying hair left around his head. Teeth showed through his facial hair as he smiled <br />
to himself. It was really happening!<br />
<br />
Matt guessed that he was entering his forties now, his beard now a grayish hue as more and more hairs lost <br />
their youthful colour. The gray was spreading, appearing throughout his chest and stomach hair. Lines were <br />
etching their way across his once youthful face, crows feet and laughter lines deepening in his looser skin. <br />
His belly had grown considerably larger, now bulging outwards and hanging down, his arm slapping against the <br />
side of it as he continued masturbating. He could feel his cock starting to get softer in his hand, but he <br />
just managed to ejaculate an abnormal amount of cum over the sink and mirror before erectile dysfunction <br />
kicked in, and his cock sunk back down, disappearing under the bulk of his belly.<br />
<br />
Matt grabbed some toilet paper and wiped off the mirror, gleefully thinking how he might never experience an <br />
ejaculation again. The man in the mirror was in his fifties now, his beard was completely grey, with the rest <br />
of his body hair soon to follow suit. His once toned pecs had diminished drastically, now shapeless blobs <br />
drooping down onto his large belly, the nipples pointing towards the ground. His stomach was even larger, <br />
protruding further outwards and blocking the view of his cock, now half its original size and no longer useful <br />
for sexual activity. His eyesight started to get blurry, signalling the need for a good pair of glasses. <br />
Squinting, he couldn't tell how much longer he had to go. He was starting to get vague aches and pains around <br />
his body, his hands succumbing to joint pain from arthritis. His arms were starting to wrinkle as his skin was <br />
becoming looser. His face wasn't fairing much better as the skin sagged down by gravity, his multiple chins <br />
hidden by his white beard, deeper wrinkles dug into his forehead and around the eyes, liver spots blemishing <br />
his smooth scalp.<br />
<br />
A sudden jerk within Matt signalled the end of the changes. A pair of big glasses appeared on his face, making <br />
it easier for him to see the new 70 year old body he had. Fat, hairy, wrinkled. He revelled in his lost youth <br />
and new-found maturity. He would of been aroused if his cock still worked. He ran his tongue around his mouth <br />
feeling nothing but gum, before spotting a pair of false teeth by the sink. He stuffed them in his mouth. The <br />
pants he pulled off earlier had changed in size to fit his new body, a pair of suspenders attached to them. He <br />
struggled to reach down to pick them up, grunting loudly from back pain. With a bit of trouble, he finally <br />
managed to get them on. He looked around for a shirt, but remembered that he left it in Jay's dad's room. He <br />
looked back at himself in the mirror, still not believing he made himself over 50 years older. He rubbed his <br />
face, feeling more like a rubber mask than the smooth skin he was used to, but pulling on his saggy skin <br />
brought more pain, proving it was real. He lifted up his huge belly that drooped several inches over his pants <br />
to see if he'd done them up right, before dropping it down again, enjoying the feeling of it jiggling about. <br />
Then Matt grabbed his chest in pain and realised he should probably check the Chronivac to see what medical <br />
problems his new aging body had. Walking over to the door, another sharp pain ran up his leg, and he briefly <br />
wondered if there was a cane somewhere nearby.<br />
<br />
Jay had been waiting a while for his friend to leave the bathroom, wondering what was taking him so long. <br />
Checking the Chronivac only showed the changes were still in progress and wouldn't tell him what they were. <br />
Finally, he heard the bathroom door unlock and open. He looked out of the bedroom door to see what his friend <br />
looked like, expecting a man his father's age given the way he spoke. But words couldn't describe his reaction <br />
to seeing a man older than his grandfather come out. His weathered face crinkled in pain whenever he stepped <br />
with his left leg, slowly making his way to the bedroom. He was obese with sagging man-tits and a huge belly <br />
covered with white hair that matched the thick white beard he had, inversely matching the lack of hair atop <br />
his head. If he weren't topless, Jay noticed an oversized shirt where Matt had dropped it, he could of bared <br />
resemblance to Santa. The old man just barely made it through the doorway before he collapsed onto the bed, <br />
his breathing sharp and ragged. Jay was the first to speak. &quot;Holy. Shit. What the fuck did you do to <br />
yourself?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Watch your language. I made myself older. I told you that when I started&quot; Matt said, his voice gruff and <br />
rattled from age.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, but when you said older, I thought you meant like my dad's age. Not my granddad's age!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I'm even older than your granddad, son. I made myself 70 years old, soon to be 75 by tomorrow if you keep <br />
your aging contraption working&quot;. He coughed loudly, sputtering saliva everywhere, then added with a grin &quot;if I <br />
live that long anyway&quot;. <br />
<br />
Jay was horrified. His friend had aged himself to the brink of death, and didn't seem phased about dying at <br />
all! &quot;Why did you make yourself so old? We need to fix this right now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Matt reached a wrinkled hand out to his friend to stop him, his arthritis causing him to wince. &quot;No, I wanted <br />
this. As weird as it sounds, it's always been a fantasy of mine to rapidly age into an old man and that <br />
machine did it for me. Although I should probably check it to see what medical conditions I now have. I want <br />
to keep the ol' ticker going for as long as I can.&quot; He had another coughing fit, his chest aching from the <br />
strain. <br />
<br />
Jay complied with his ancient friend's wishes, finding a list of his health under his profile. It didn't look <br />
good to him at all and despite being able to do seemingly everything, the Chronivac wasn't able to cure what <br />
Matt had. He side-eyed the old man, who was now coughing into a handkerchief slightly stained with specks of <br />
blood. If he didn't turn off the temporal increase, Matt would be dead by the end of the day. Of course, he <br />
could always turn Matt back to his original age. He didn't want to attend his best friend's funeral any time <br />
soon.</p>
