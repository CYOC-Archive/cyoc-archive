<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Now that she had some time, Autonoe tried to contact her mom through the crystal. It was pretty simple to do, and soon enough she could hear her mother moving around her workshop. Not quite sure if it would work, Autonoe tried to think her words.<br />
&quot;Hey mom, can you hear me?&quot;<br />
<br />
She could hear the sounds of her mother setting things down and shoving a bunch of things out of her way before finally her mother answered. &quot;Yes sweetie, is everything alright, how is your sister? Are either of you hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No, we are fine, so please calm down. I just had to ask you something.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fawn let out a sigh of relief. &quot;Sweetie, you know this is primarily meant for emergencies right? Well, at least you both are fine. And since were both here now, you may as well ask away.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m sorry for the trouble, it was an order from Felka&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Say no more, you did a good job following your master then. She will take the responsibility for this. Now then, back to your question.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Right. Felka wants me to ask you to install the rest of my feminine body parts, with proper feeling capabilities included.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit. I knew I forgot something. I&#39;m so sorry sweetie. Yes, I will definitely finish your body once you return. I can&#39;t believe I forgot them. I have them right here as well too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, you have them already made?&quot; Asked Autonoe, surprised that it wasn&#39;t necessary to make them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course I do. Did you know that your body was originally a sex doll? My ex-husband&#39;s to be exact, that bastard. Can you believe that just because I got pregnant with Felka, he felt it was good to go and buy himself a sexdoll on THAT SAME DAY! Needless to say, before he even got to take it out of the box, I stole it from him and left his sorry ass. Oh, and your pussy module is still a virgin too, so no worries in that reguard. Oh, hey can you guys go to the town for me? I really need some more mana crystals, the purple kind. Felka will know what I am talking about. And just slaughter some things on your way if you need cash. Sell it through the guild though. Oh, and never go near the noble house, nor get involved any more than entering the main gate with the guards. Remember I am an infamous witch and all. Not that I have done anything too serious, well recently. But me and the nobility don&#39;t exactly get along after the whole sexdoll thing. But the guild should still love me, since I bribe them too by delivering mass quantities of rare or difficult to collect items. Anyways, I need to go and I have been rambling on and on and on so... Bye, love you sweetie, tell your sister for me too, and that she is in trouble when she gets home for using the emergency crystal&quot;. Autonoe felt the crystals disconnect, and needed a long minute to process everything that was just said. Felka fell down right next to her, nearly able to fly, but mostly gliding was all she could manage to consistently do.  Landing was a sifferent thing though.<br />
<br />
&quot;What did she say?&quot; Felka asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That your in trouble, she loves you, and to go buy purple mana crystals from the town&#39;s guild.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Ffffuck. I hate buying the crystals. Too many questions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She also said she has the parts and will add them when we return.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh? Thats great!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... I guess so. Anyways, how is flying going? Get the hang of it yet&quot; Autonoe asked, changing the subject.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good, I can almost do it, I think.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If that is the case, why not practice while we make our way to the town? But you will need to lead the way since I do not know the area.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure, but I am kinda hungry, can we eat something too?&quot; Asked Felka.<br />
<br />
&quot;Here, take your pick&quot; Autonoe said, gesturing to the pile of corpses nearby. Felka was repulsed by the thought, but her body betrayed her as her mouth began to water. Why didn&#39;t she remember to take food with them? Was she really going to have to eat something feom that pile? Autonoe went over and pulled off the leg of a cow-like monster and handed it to Felka, who nearly dropped it out of disgust, but her body refused to part with it, and so she reluctantly took a bite. And then another, and another. She was nearly brought to twars at how good it tasted. It wasn&#39;t even cooked, and yet she&#39;s never had a better tasting meal. If only the smell reflected the taste. <br />
<br />
Autonoe torched the pile of corpses before they left, reducing it to ash, while keeping all of the sellable materials that Felka had pointed out. Apparently one of the many crystals inside of Autonoe&#39;s body had a storage function, since she could put the items into an isolated space it had shown in her display. It was a pretty useful tool that everyone should own. Apparently though, it was rather rare as Felka looked at her in astonishment. &quot;So that is where mom put the missing crystal from one of the rings her ex-husband, my dad, had given her.&quot;<br />
<br />
Autonoe was curious about who this mysterious ex-husband was. &quot;Felka, do you know who is your dad?&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Yep. Accodring to mom. Quote, That bastard is the current noble whose family is overseeing this territory. He is a shameless prick, who is completely full of hinself, end quote. I&#39;ve seen him once before, and I can confirm that what she said is 100% accurate. All he does is mess around, and leaves the territory to his subordinates to manage for him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So you are technically nobility?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We both are. Your body was once about to be his sex doll, remember haha. Seriously, he was pissed when mom stole you. Rumor was that this is was what really ended their marriage. That he cared  more about his expensive toy than his own wife. However, because of his rather unusual hands off approach to running the territory for a noble, the economy is doing very well since trade isn&#39;t based upon the personal relations of the noble. Because of this, no one would really interfere with him, in fear of either him starting to run the territory or handing his title off to another noble.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That seems complicated.&quot; Autonoe was not an expert in terms of politics, so she just figured that it wasn&#39;t importaint and moved the subject again. &quot;What are purple crystals used for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honestly, they are a simply a masturbation aid. Mom goes through them quite frequently, so she established a reoccurring trade deal with a merchant in the guild hall.&quot; Felka really disliked doing this pick-up because she always ended up getting misunderstood. Even though she used them sparingly too. &quot;Anyways, we got about half a days trip still, and we need to likely collect a few more rare items to sell, so keep an eye out, and lets avoide any unnecessary interactions with anyone else ok.&quot;</p>
