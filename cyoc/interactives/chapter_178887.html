<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As Jim felt himself inflate like a balloon he held the mouth of the balloon and remained bloated till he released the balloon.<br />
<br />
Then just like the balloon he went back to his normal size.<br />
<br />
This could be fun he thought to himself. As he played with the balloon over and over again some times quite large and sometimes just the body of a bear.<br />
<br />
But his exploits did not go unnoticed.<br />
<br />
As the days wore on his friend Bobby saw the differences in his friend and realized how they happened. But Bobby had been put down most of his childhood by Jim because he wasn&#39;t as good as him. There were so many times Bobby went home crying from the taunts he received at the hands of Jim but this was an opportunity he finally had to get a little revenge. Or it wasn&#39;t a little.<br />
<br />
It took Bobby some time to find where Jim hid the balloon and that was the night he got Bobby drunk and took him back to Jim&#39;s house. As he got Jim up to his room and got him undressed and in bed he tied him to the bed and waited for the hangover to wear off and Jim to awaken.<br />
<br />
There once Jim was up he tried to move but was unable to do so. But he saw Bobby there sitting within sight and even with his blurry vision he noticed that Bobby had in his hand the balloon he had been playing with.<br />
<br />
This sobered him up instantly.<br />
<br />
So you are away Bobby said.<br />
<br />
What are you doing? Jim asked not trying to tip his hand that he saw the balloon in Bobby&#39;s hand.<br />
<br />
Oh nothing. Just thought we would have a bit of fun.<br />
<br />
Let me up then.<br />
<br />
Not just yet. We have a bit of fun to attend to.<br />
<br />
That was when like a magician Bobby produced a table. On it he produced what looked like a funnel. And next to it he placed a large pitcher of a clear liquid.<br />
<br />
And now for the main event. That was when Bobby held up the balloon and said look what I found.<br />
<br />
What... what is that?<br />
<br />
You know. I have watched you play with it for some time.<br />
<br />
Really? It is just a balloon.<br />
<br />
Not just a balloon it is a very special balloon. What happens to it happens to you. So if I blow this up like this. Bobby took a deep breath and Jim inflated. Then you become quite round. And if I let it go then you go back to normal. In an out Bobby puffed Jim bigger and smaller.<br />
<br />
Stop.<br />
<br />
Oh I will I have had just about enough of this fun. But lets move on. Have you ever thought what might happen if you put a liquid in it?<br />
<br />
No. Why?<br />
<br />
Well I f I puff into it you get bigger but you don&#39;t feel heavy. But it is my belief that if I put some liquid in you will feel that weight.<br />
<br />
This intrigued and horrified Jim. He had never tried that before.<br />
<br />
Well here we have a pitcher and a funnel. Bobby fit the balloon to the funnel and held it up. Now lets see what a little feels like. Bobby sprinkled a little something into the water and it turned a bright red. So we can see what we are doing. Bobby said.<br />
<br />
He poured a few cups into the balloon and greatly magnified Jim&#39;s belly bloated out. Bobby came over and jiggled Jim&#39;s belly. Feels full to me. How does it feel to you.<br />
<br />
Jim could feel the weight. It feels ok.<br />
<br />
Just ok? Hum maybe a bit more. Bobby poured with more gusto half of the pitcher in. Jim could no longer see over his belly. Well now you look like a regular tub of lard. By my estimation you must be around 350 pounds.<br />
<br />
350? That was huge Jim thought.<br />
<br />
How a bit more?<br />
<br />
Jim shook his head no but Bobby wasn&#39;t having any of it. He dumped the rest of the pitcher in and Bobby heard the bed creak. Wow that&#39;s what an 800 plus man looks like.<br />
<br />
800? Oh got let it out. I am huge.<br />
<br />
Oh we are going to enjoy this.<br />
<br />
As the time wore on Jim thought he felt warm. Was the weight making it hard for him to regulate his body temperature?<br />
<br />
But then Bobby began to manipulate the balloon poking up some man boobs on it. Filling out the legs and arms. Giving it double chins and a couple of nice orbs for a booty. It looked rather sexy Jim thought but he wasn&#39;t going to tell Bobby that.<br />
<br />
Let me go back to normal he almost screamed at him as the beads of sweat dripped down his forhead.<br />
<br />
Oh I don&#39;t think so.<br />
<br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
This little liquid that I put in the balloon isn&#39;t water. It is an interesting polymer that when it cures will become quite solid. And your body will hold the bloated form that the balloon has become. I will let you up then.<br />
<br />
No please stop before it solidifies fully.<br />
<br />
Well even if I did let some out it is too late. over 60% has solidified already. You would be 60% of this size anyway but I want a big whale of a man to play with.<br />
<br />
But I am not gay? Well if you didn&#39;t notice I pushed your penis way into the folds. You couldn&#39;t satisfy a woman anyway so might as well enjoy a good gay man. And hell you will enjoy being a fetish to these chasers, encouragers, etc.<br />
<br />
Please let some out. Well ok. Bobby said and as he went to the balloon he pulled the table over so that Jim could see as he poured more of the polymer in. I am guessing this will make you a ton. And Bobby tied off the top of the balloon as a little screech escaped Jim&#39;s mouth.</p>
