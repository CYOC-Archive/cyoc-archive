<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">As you had, you were pretty sure at least, checked out everything that wasn&#39;t literally on fire or would involve crawling through twisty little tunnels you probably could handle as a snake but couldn&#39;t very well see any space gangsters manage, and you&#39;d just gotten a new... &quot;upgrade&quot; for your suit here, and whoever installed all these vending machines usually had some sort of practical intention, you just dove on out of that wreck of a ship straight into the ocean.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, you had gills now, and didn&#39;t have to worry about breathing underwater, which was an interesting novelty... but also if you hadn&#39;t plugged all this crap into your suit in the first place it would still be a big airtight metal thing with its own oxygen supply, so it was kind of a lateral move at best.<br />
<br />
Also it didn&#39;t really occur to you when you first thought this plan up, but oceans have this tendency to be very large. Also very dark... and pretty cold. The whole fish girl thing did help with that last bit to some degree, but naturally the pervy space birds who designed this kept you feeling just cold enough underwater for your nipples to be rock hard the whole time you were down there. Which was, again, quite a long time. If you didn&#39;t keep seeing the occasional heavy security door you needed to fire boob missiles at to get past, you&#39;d have given up on all of this as a complete waste of time, but in practice it was... still quite a lot of wasted time before finding a way to actually advance your mission.<br />
<br />
Working your way through a particularly dark and confusing undersea cave, you were attacked by a rather alarmingly huge eel. Or maybe it was a sea snake? You supposed technically it wasn&#39;t either one because this was an alien planet after all and had its own evolutionary history and taxonomic categories some nerd would probably have a great time pinning down. For that matter, for all you knew, this thing was brought here by the space gangsters to act as some sort of guarddog. Or, guardfish. Guardwhatever. There was an outside chance it even WAS a space gangster, but you felt pretty confident you could rule that out since it wasn&#39;t wearing a pinstripe suit or smoking a cigar. Which, sure, would be tricky to manage underwater, but the tunnels it kept darting in and out of didn&#39;t seem to connect to any sort of break room or speakeasy. You checked after spending a frankly absurd amount of time shooting it in the face before it stopped moving.<br />
<br />
Past that was... a lot more swimming around, mostly. It would have been pretty boring if not for all the gropey tentacle things. Best as you were able to tell, the gangsters were trying to clone the thing you were here to find or something, but hadn&#39;t done it right. These looked pretty similar, and as soon as they saw you they all came swimming up to wrap their tentacles around you, but they weren&#39;t going full on sex monster and shoving them down your throat wriggling under the few areas your suit still covered, and you certainly didn&#39;t feel like a sex-crazed hyper-fertile bimbo after you finished prying them all off and continuing along your way. Well... OK you sort of did, but that was just because your pervy super suit here turned you into a stacked near-naked space babe and you had to feel yourself up or lay eggs to get the full potency out of your arsenal. Nothing these things could take credit for.<br />
<br />
Eventually you reached a particularly well-secured doorway, bashed your way through to the other side, and found yourself face to face with one of the most notorious space gangsters of all time. Dre Gonzales. You were pretty surprised, as you&#39;d never heard of him and O&#39;Connel running in the same crew before, and also because you knew from his file this creep was all slithery tentacles from the waist down, but you didn&#39;t know he was actually aquatic. That didn&#39;t always follow after all. Aliens had weird tentacles for all sorts of reasons. It also never occurred to you before that his whole head was so damn phallic looking. Also the tentacles, but that much you knew going in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, as tended to be the way you handled these things, you proceeded to start switching forms around and fire everything you had at this creep. Missiles, fireballs, charged up shots from your regular gun... but he was a real tough piece of work and half of this stuff didn&#39;t seem to work too well underwater in the first place, and before you knew it, he was right on top of you.<br />
<br />
This of course was where this particular mission reached a real new low for you. Unlike the annoying little things you had to deal with on the swim over, Gonzales DID know what to do with those tentacles and the sort of body you had now. They were pulling your skimpy little suit aside, wriggling up your butt, right up your pussy, down your cleavage where if he&#39;d been inclined he could have maybe started yanking modules out to get the upper hand. He didn&#39;t shove one in your mouth though. No, instead he just pulled you right up eye to bloodshot bulging eye and stuck his tongue down your throat. Oddly enough, that gave you an idea. You switched over to frog head, and shot your own tongue right back into his mouth. All the way down. If he was going to penetrate you this inappropriately, turnabout was only fair.<br />
<br />
The sensation of your tongue lashing all the way down to his stomach was shocking enough for him to completely let go of you and shove you away in shock. Not wasting any time, you grabbed one of his tentacles, wrapped it around his neck, and choked him out with it. Then of course you shot him more than enough times to make extra sure that there was absolutely no way he&#39;d share the details of such a humiliating encounter with anyone, adjusted your suit, and started looting the place. Another high level security keycard, a whole case of missiles, and another vending machine was stashed away in the corner. Hopefully this would give you what you needed to finish clearing this place out.</p>
