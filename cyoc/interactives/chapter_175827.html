<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Michael was pretty much the exact opposite of a manly man. He was only 5’3” and 97 pounds he was hairless, well groomed, and quite effeminate. Michael had just graduated from high school and was on his way to college.<br />
<br />
One day while he was eating breakfast with his father, his father suddenly said. “If you want me pay for your student loans, I need you to finally start acting like the son I expected you to be.” Hurt, Michael responded “And what do you mean by that?” “You’ll see.” Said his father.<br />
<br />
Suddenly there was a knock on the door and Michael’s father opened it, saying “Are you here to pick up Michael? Okay, well he’s right inside.” Then, a very large man walked right up behind Michael and injected him with something, causing him to pass out.<br />
<br />
He woke up on a bus full of other worried-looking young men. Nobody was saying anything until the bus stopped, then the driver announced “Alright men! Get off now! And strip!” “You want us to strip? Why?” Said one of the men. “What about my cellphone?” Said another. “Men have nothing to be ashamed of! Be proud of your bodies and show them off to the world! As for your cellphones, what do you need them for!? Men should t have to pick up the phone for anybody!” The bus driver yelled, although it seemed like that was just his normal way of speaking. “Where are we even going?” Said one of the passengers. “To Man Camp! Your fathers have expressed their dissatisfaction in you manliness! They’ve sent you here to correct that!” The bus driver said as the door opened into the camp. The camp looked normal except there was a fence preventing the campers from leaving.<br />
<br />
The men, including Michael were all very hesitant but as they started getting of the bus, there were several other men about the same size as the bus driver. Their intimidating faces made Michael and the others begin to strip, Michael and most of the other men were embarrassed so they covered up the junk. “Listen men, I get it! This all very new! But look, all of us are just embracing our nature as men!” As the driver said that, he began undressing except he left his tie on. Michael finally got the chance to really pay attention to the driver, and realized just how manly he was. He was giant, at least 8’ tall, he was also very hairy and had a giant, erect dick. It was at least 2 feet hard, and was constantly leaking pre for some reason.<br />
<br />
The driver continued speaking, “My name is Al! I will be your head instructor here! You all will be staying here for the next month! You will be staying learning about what it truly means to be a man! Now uncover your cocks! Be proud of what they resemble! Your manhood!” His words got some of the campers to stop covering their dicks, including Michael. Michael kept himself hairless and was packing a good 5”. Al then turned his attention towards Michael “That’s what I like to see!” Allen walked up to Michael the tip of Al’s dick was rubbing against Michael’s chest, but it seemed like Al didn’t even notice. “Do you see this everyone!?” Al pointed to Michael’s dick “What’s your name!?” “...it’s Mich-“ “Alright, Mike! Why do you shave!?” “I just like keeping things smooth...” “Why!? You’re a man, aren’t you!? Be proud of your pubes! Everyone! I want you to know that there are no razors here! Why shave!? Why spend the effort!? Men shouldn’t have to groom themselves! That’s what bitches do! Be proud of your hair! Be proud!” Al then walked away from Mike, leaving a bit of pre on his chest. Mike felt really grossed out. <br />
<br />
Al guided the campers to a large cabin, full of comfy beds. “This is where you will be sleeping!” “All in the same room?” Said a camper “Where are the bathrooms?” Said another. “Yes all in the same room! Men have nothing to hide! Even when they need release they can do it in-front of others! As for bathrooms, like I said men have nothing to hide! That includes your excretions! Piss and shit freely! Wherever and whenever!” Mike was shocked to hear this, he actually really needed to go but he was to shy to ask. “Alright campers! I’ll leave you head to get acquainted with each other! Sorry that you haven’t gotten to eat yet but there’ll be plenty tomorrow! I know you men are hungry!” Mike was indeed hungry, all he had eaten was some cereal before he got abducted. Al then closed the cabin door and left the room.<br />
<br />
The naked men that were going to be sleeping there quickly began gossiping. Al could hear them, as he was still near the door, then quickly realized he had forgot something. Al then ran to get something, came back, and slammed the door back open. “Sorry men! I forgot to distribute something! Here!” Al brought a cart full of magazines in and resumed talking “I know what men are most! Horny! When I heard you all worrying I realized I didn’t want you getting too pent up! Here!” Mike and the others gathered around the car, there were various porno mags which all featured either women or twinks. “Hope that’ll be enough to satisfy you all! Well goodnight!” Al then left for real this time. Mike and the others still continued gossiping, but a couple of the men actually began thoroughly reading through the magazines, one of them actually began beating his meat. Mike was shocked at how quickly they adjusted, but realized things could be much worse. Mike also realized he hadn’t brought any toiletries with him, no toothpaste, no moisturizer, no skincare, not even deodorant. Mike then tried to fall asleep he hid himself under the covers to try and drown out the sounds of a double of men fapping. Eventually he slept.</p>
