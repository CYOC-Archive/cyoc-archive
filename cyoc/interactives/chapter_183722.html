<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Overtime the Wilsons’ apartment was starting to look quite different. Used clothes were scattered on the corridor floor. The doors to almost every room were propped open. Stacks of plates were piled high in the kitchen sink, almost toppling onto the fridge, which was always open. The summer heat had made the apartment unbearably hot. Whilst they were still following the Government guidelines by keeping their windows and curtains shut, the urge to open one and feel that cool breeze was tantalising.<br />
<br />
Harry lay uncomfortable on his bed, the sweltering air of his boiler-room-bedroom assaulting him. The large fan just next to his head was only making it worse. He wiped his wet forehead, turning on his phone and swiping to check on Zach. He hadn’t received a message in weeks. It wasn’t like Zach to ignore him. Sighing, he quickly leapt from the bed and walked out of his room, sighing with relief to be out of there.<br />
<br />
He noticed the door to Matthew’s room was open, and could hear the sound of low grunts mixed with high-tempo music. He peeked his head into the doorway and was surprised by what he saw. <br />
<br />
Matthew and Martin were working out together. To combat the heat, Matthew wore nothing but a tight pair of boxers, his pecs and chiseled abs on full display. He seemed to enjoy being naked, as every few seconds he was checking himself out in the reflection of the TV, glancing at his impressive package. He short himself a confidant smile as he lifted two dumbbells from the floor. He stood beside Martin, who was brenchpressing barbells made from a broom handle and large milkjugs filled with water. The step-father opted for a more traditional vest-and-shorts workout style, even if he was starting to outgrow them. Harry tried to avert his gaze from the man’s notable bulge. <br />
<br />
He had never expected his stepdad to start working out. He had heard Martin mentioning it a few days ago. He looked so different too. Gone was that portly figure, and round belly. It looked like the fat had just melted away in a matter of days. Martin actually looked rather buff. His arms were certainly the main attraction. They were huge, and flexed as he lifted the weights. The hair on his forearms was glistening with sweat. Harry could no longer tell if the musk he was smelling was Matthew’s or Martin’s, but he could smell it throughout the apartment.<br />
<br />
“Hey guys.”<br />
<br />
Upon hearing Harry’s voice, Martin sat up and greeted the boy with a warm smile, the makeshift barbell still in his large hands.<br />
<br />
Similar to the rest of his body, the man’s face had changed pretty dramatically, albeit gradually. It looked sharper, and more masculine, with a thin layer of stubble tickling his jaw.He shook his head, and the now full head of thick hair flew past his eyes. His state was warm, and almost hypnotising. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would’ve thought Martin was in his mid thirties! Matthew nodded at his brother, wiping the sweat off his chest with a damp towel.<br />
<br />
“Mornin’. What’s up?”<br />
“Do you guys need the bathroom? I’m gonna have a cold shower.”<br />
“Na I’m all good.”<br />
“Coolio and Matt, for God’s sake, please put some clothes on.”<br />
“Someone’s jealous.”<br />
<br />
Matt joked as he cockily flexed his arms at his brother, who rolled his eyes. Martin let out a chuckle. Harry still couldn’t get used to the man’s voice, which he swear wasn’t as deep as it was a few weeks ago. Shrugging it off, he briskly walked to the bathroom, locking it behind him.<br />
<br />
Even though the heat was no better there as it was in his room, Harry knew he could at least cool off. He scowled at the empty towel rack, and reluctantly opened the laundry basket. A potent smell wafted from it. An intense aroma of musk and something else. It was half-full of used, partially wet towels. He reached in and grabbed one.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, he shot his hand away. He felt something wet on the towel. Something sticky. He looked at his hand to see the white liquid stick his fingers together. That was when it clicked.<br />
<br />
“Gross!”<br />
<br />
Harry said aloud as he began to move his hand into the sink to wash it off. However, before he could turn the tap on, he felt his fingers grow warmer and warmer, vibrating slightly, as if something was delicately shaking them.  He noticed the cum on his hand squirm a tiny bit, before gradually being absorbed into his skin. Harry watched with wide eyes as it gently disappeared into his hand, before quickly running cold water on it. He scrubbed his fingers vigorously for just under a minute. He could feel his heart beating furiously as the thought of touching either his brother’s or his father’s loads refused to leave his mind. He looked back at the towel and saw the massive patch of someone’s seed cling to it. He had never seen such a huge load before. Whoever did it was certainly pent up. He took his hand out of the water. The vibrating feeling had stopped, and he took a few deep breaths in. After a few minutes of calming down, he carefully pushed the towel back into the laundry basket. <br />
<br />
“We have got to clean this place up.”<br />
<br />
He thought as the sounds of the men grunting in the other room continued. He gave up on finding a clean towel, and began to get ready for his shower.</p>
