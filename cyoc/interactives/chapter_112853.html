<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Chad grabbed the jockstrap box and stared at it.  It was a Duke, except the word duke was crossed out and CHAD was written on it.  He opened the box.  It was empty. He swallowed hard.  His skin was a pale beige and getting lighter. His mouth tasted like cotton.  He looked at the box size XL.  He swallowed hard. Only one person that he knew wore an extra large Duke jockstrap.  Everyone else wore Bike Brand.  He felt so weak.<br />
<br />
Coach Sinclair and Spencer entered the field house and started to walk toward trembling naked Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Spence, looks like you did it.  I knew sooner of later, Chad would bed Karen, so now I won&#39;t have to worry about that happening,&quot; Coach Sinclair said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Nope, definitely not going to be sticking his dick anywhere ever again,&quot; snickered Spencer. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, and don&#39;t worry, you just passed your Phys Ed for the rest of the year, with straight A&#39;s,&quot; Coach added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whew! Now I&#39;m a cinch to be valedictorian,&quot; Spencer added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Say, what did you do for Coach Abernathy to pass last year?&quot; Coach Sinclair said turning to face Spencer, as Chad dropped to his knees.<br />
<br />
Chad stared at his shrinking penis.  His cock and balls reshaped and fused into a white tag that said &quot;MADE IN THE USA&quot;.  Chad looked up in horror.  He was only vaguely aware of Spencer&#39;s reply.<br />
<br />
&quot;No! Puh-lease, dun do dith!&quot; gasped Chad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not doing anything now, just letting the nanobots run their course, when they&#39;re done the die and you&#39;re left as Coach Sinclair&#39;s new conscious, living jockstrap. Too bad, he&#39;s a widower. Guess, you&#39;ll be loads of fun for him to jack off into, now, Chad!&quot; said Spencer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, don&#39;t get the boy&#39;s hopes up too much,&quot; Coach Sinclair said, &quot;I&#39;ve got a friend in the next county who takes care of that.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, Chad, guess you may starve,&quot; laughed Spencer.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know, Chad, you were the best jock I&#39;ve ever had in any of my classes, so it&#39;s fitting that you spend the rest of your life as my best jock ever,&quot; Coach Sinclair said with a laugh.<br />
<br />
Chad was now staring up at the two giants looming over him.   Coach Sinclair reached down and picked up Chad who was now a flimsy cotton jockstrap.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Mind if I try him on here?&quot;  the big middle aged man asked, as he pulled off his nylon shorts.  He had gone commando in anticipation of putting Chad on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um-,&quot; gasped Spencer staring at the coach&#39;s naked cock.  It was as big as Chad&#39;s had been, &quot;No, go right ahead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, wait,&quot; the coach said stepping out of Chad&#39;s waistband. &quot;I forgot to remove the tag.&quot;<br />
<br />
Silently, Chad screamed as the coach ripped the &quot;MADE IN THE USA&quot; tag off the spot where the leg straps joined the pouch.  He tossed the discarded tag in the air, and let it waft down to the ground.<br />
<br />
Chad was in shock from the pain of being castrated, and still feeling the air around his flattened manhood as it drifted to ground.  He barely noticed that Coach Sinclair had both feet inside the leg straps and was pulling Chad up to his new home.  Chad screamed, silently.  Coach snapped him into place around his waist.  Chad gagged as cock and balls bigger than his own filled his being.  His arms and legs ached as they stretched around the coach&#39;s girth.  <br />
<br />
Silently, Spencer stooped and picked up the torn tag and shoved it into his pocket.<br />
<br />
The coach patted his swelling bulge, and said, &quot;Perfect fit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What did you expect?&quot; said Spencer insulted that anything he made wouldn&#39;t be perfect.<br />
<br />
The coach laughed and tousled his hair.  He pulled up his shorts, and invited Spencer to dinner at his house.<br />
<br />
He left.  Chad had expected the coach to talk to him or something, but as far as the coach was concerned Chad was just a jockstrap.  You don&#39;t talk to jockstraps.  Chad was worn while the coach traipsed around the school until about 6 PM.  Then coach went home.<br />
<br />
He arrived at the same time as Spencer.  Karen had dinner waiting on the table.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, this is the boy you said would be joining us for dinner?&quot; Karen asked, &quot;I thought you said it would be Chad.&quot;<br />
<br />
Spencer giggled.  Coach Sinclair replied, &quot;No, I never said it was Chad.  In fact, Spencer here is bound to be our next Valedictorian. Now don&#39;t be rude, ask our guest what he wants to drink, Karen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck, thought Chad, Spencer gets a date with Karen too.  Well, he&#39;s not man enough to bed her. Then he remembered he wasn&#39;t anymore either.  Chad could hear everything from his home around the coach&#39;s manhood.  At first the smell had bothered him, but after an hour or so, he barely noticed the manly musky sour smell.  <br />
<br />
It turned out Karen had prepared Chad&#39;s favorite foods for dinner, and while he could smell them, he wasn&#39;t going to be able to eat any of it.  Damn, it sucked to be a jockstrap.<br />
<br />
Spencer was too nerdy, and awkward.  Karen was clearly put off by him, even when he gushed over her pumpkin pie.  Chad remembered, Spencer had whined at camp when they had roasted pumpkin seeds because eating pumpkin always made him sick.<br />
<br />
&quot;Would you like another slice of pumpkin pie?&quot; Karen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no, I don&#39;t think I could eat another bite,&quot; Spencer said.<br />
<br />
Coach said, &quot;Go ahead.  Karen get him another slice, we gotta put some meat on this scrawny boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Chad was sadistically happy that Spencer would have indigestion tonight.  He didn&#39;t want to think what awaited him tonight.   But of course he did.  In a hamper?  Washed in the sink and hanging to dry in the shower?  Coach wearing him to bed? Yikes!</p>
