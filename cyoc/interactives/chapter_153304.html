<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After what feels like hours in dream land, I could feel someone nudging me awake. I open my eyes to see a giant boss, and what seems to be a spilled bucket behind him.<br />
<br />
“Wha-What did you do?” I got up, just to realize how small I was.<br />
<br />
“Ok, hear me out!”<br />
<br />
“Hear you out? I trusted you to not make me too young. And what did you do? You used the whole dang thing!” I stopped talking and quickly realized something else was wrong.<br />
<br />
“Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!”<br />
<br />
“What’s wrong now?”<br />
<br />
“Fudge! Shoot! Butt! Dumb butt!”<br />
<br />
“Are you ok?”<br />
<br />
“No I am not ok!” At that moment, I realized my body was unable to swear. There was possibly no logic behind this, so why do I have to use these words?<br />
<br />
“Look, it’s been a long day. Let’s just take you to the entrance, and we will choose the shortest time pill for your sake.”<br />
<br />
“How is that going to fudging help?”<br />
<br />
“You know what, your right! Maybe we shouldn’t give you a pill, and have you age normally again! Now who would like to be potty trained by their boss?” I knew he was kinda being sarcastic, and that he just wanted me to realize his suggestions are best. But I can’t really listen to him when I’ve lost the trust in him.<br />
<br />
Before I could say anything, my boss opened the door to the sauna and called the assistant from earlier. I grabbed my towel and covered myself up and best as I could as she was coming.<br />
<br />
“Yes sir? How may I help?”<br />
<br />
“My friend here needs some kind of ‘special underwear’ before he has an accident on the floor. Could you bring one for him please?”<br />
<br />
“I can’t really guess his size just from looks. May I take him to figure it out while you continue with your spa day?”<br />
<br />
“Oh, this was our final one for the day. We can go ahead and pick out clothes for him and I.”<br />
<br />
“Alright then, follow me.”<br />
<br />
My boss puts on his towel, but I didn’t bother waiting on him. It wasn’t long for him to catch up though. After walking for about 5 minutes, she opened a door with a sign that says males on it.<br />
<br />
Inside there was many clothes for children, but very few for adults. <br />
<br />
“Sir, would you like to use your old clothes?”<br />
<br />
“Yes please, none of these clothes would fit me, and if they did I’d get a few stares for being an adult in children’s clothing”<br />
<br />
The woman giggled at his small joke “Which locker was it?”<br />
<br />
“Mine was 42. This little guy here had 53.”<br />
<br />
She nodded her head and left the room. “Alright bud, lets get you diapered up!” My boss went ahead and started searching for the diapers, which wasn’t long due to a few boxes on the side labeled ‘Diapers’ and ‘Training Pants’.<br />
<br />
“When you were this young? Do you remember being potty trained?” My boss asked as he searched the boxes.<br />
<br />
“Why would I know that? And even if I did, do you think I’d choose diapers of all things?”<br />
<br />
“Well now, maybe we should even have you have a choice in things anymore?”<br />
<br />
“That isn’t even unfair! You could have chosen a normal spa treatment, but you didn’t. I had to become a thumb sucking toddler!”<br />
<br />
“So no cartoon diapers?” <br />
<br />
I walked over and smacked the diapers out of his hand. He looked at the diapers at the floor, then at me. “Now why did you do that bud?”<br />
<br />
“Stop calling me bud!”<br />
<br />
The woman had just returned with both my boss’s and my clothes. She had folded up mine, but left my boss’s still in the way he stuffed it in the locker.<br />
<br />
“Is someone being cranky?” The woman had asked me. <br />
<br />
“Can you both stop treating me like a baby?” <br />
<br />
The woman walked over to my boss and helped him out. She randomly grabbed a diaper and then went to me. “Could you lay down for me please?”<br />
<br />
“I would rather die than wear that!”<br />
<br />
She looked at my boss, who then looked at her, and the both nodded. She got on her knees and started opening the diaper, while my boss walked over to me and grabbed both my hands and my legs and laid me down. With my legs held up, and my arms pinned down, it was hard to escape what they were doing. <br />
<br />
The woman took off my towel, and slipped the diaper under me, and then folded it onto my crotch. “It’ll be tight, but it would fit. Let me see if we have something better for you.”<br />
<br />
She took the diaper off me, but my boss didn’t let go. It didn’t take her long thought, because I felt another diaper slide underneath me again. She did the process all over again, but this time the diaper fit perfectly. She taped it up and patted my bottom. <br />
<br />
“Don’t let go just yet sir!” She told my boss as she walked over to a box and grabbed some kind of gloves. Just from my view, they looked like boxing gloves, but smaller. She got them on my hands, and used the velcro on them to shut them tight. “Ok sir, you can let go of him now!”<br />
<br />
My boss let go of me, but I didn’t even bother to move at all. I looked at my hands, and tried to move them. It was practically impossible to grab something, let alone tear something off my body.<br />
<br />
“That’s for naughty children who like to take their diapers off. Until we get clothes on you, those stay on.”<br />
<br />
The two of them looked through the array of children’s clothing and stopped when they found something for me. When they were finished, they gave me some clothes to try on. There was a shirt that had a cartoon T-Rex, another with some sport balls and the words ‘Daddy’s Boy’ written on it. Then there were a few pair of pants and shorts, followed by a blue stripped onesie and some overalls. I tried them all on, and they fit ok on me. The only difficult part was my diapered region being so tight with the clothes on. <br />
<br />
“Ok now, choose something to wear, and we will offer you what ever else is needed.”<br />
<br />
Before I could choose at all, my boss grabbed the onesie and overalls and handed them to me. “Go ahead buddy, get that diapered bum covered up!”<br />
<br />
I was going to object, but he started to force me to try the clothes on. I stopped him, only so that he wasn’t so rough with the onesie.<br />
<br />
With some clothes on me, the woman gave my boss what looked like a diaper bag that seemed full, while she gave me some flip-flops. My boss put my old clothes into the bag and picked me up to carry me out. <br />
<br />
At the front desk, there seemed to be a small group of people there, possibly leaving. One person in that group started cooing at me, as if she was trying to get my attention. I paid no attention, and she left with her group.<br />
<br />
“Goodbye you two, please come again!” The receptionist said.<br />
<br />
“I’m sorry ma’am, but we took the regression plan, and this little guy is cranky about being diapered again,” he said while motioning at me, “So if you don’t mind, can we have the medicine needed for him to go back to normal ASAP.”<br />
<br />
“Why certainly sir, but we will need you to fill out these forms!” She handed two piles of paper to us with a smile on her face.<br />
<br />
He grabbed the papers and a pen, and went to a nearby seat to fill out his papers. I looked at them, trying to read what it said. Only problem with that is that I couldn’t read at all. Each letter I saw seemed like gibberish to me.<br />
<br />
“Ok bud, can you fill out your papers?” He handed me the second pile and the pen, expecting me to start.<br />
<br />
“I can’t read” I whisper to him.<br />
<br />
“It’s ok, I’ll just ask you questions and fill out the stuff I know. The first question is ‘Have you ever regressed before?’ and I have a feeling I know what the answer is.”<br />
<br />
“Obviously it’s a no!”<br />
<br />
“Ok then, ‘Have you chosen a caregiver if you’ve regressed past the age of 11? List out the names of said caregiver below!’ would you like me to write my name?”<br />
<br />
“Well I don’t want anyone in my family to see me like this!”<br />
<br />
“Alright, I think this is the final question, ‘How long do you intend to stay your temporary age?’ You said a day right?”<br />
<br />
“Yes a day! I don’t want to spend long in this body!”<br />
<br />
He wrote down some number and continued filling it out. By the time he was done, he gave the papers to the receptionist. She read it out, and reached below.<br />
<br />
“Now these pills are special. All you need to do is swallow them, and wait for the magic to happen. What ever day you choose is the day the regression will slowly change back. If you have chosen a day, you have exactly 24 hours from now to make sure you’re not in public. If you accidentally chew the pill, the effects would be halved, and you won’t return to your full age. Got it?” <br />
<br />
Both my boss and I nodded and took the pill. She gave us cups of water to help the pill go down. I take the pill and put it in my mouth.</p>
