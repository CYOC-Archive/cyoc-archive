<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Hugo thought, &quot;That&#39;s what I get for using an Earth computer.&quot; Hugo chose to use an Earth computer to blend in but he had linked it to his homan computer back on the ship which cleverly manipulated George&#39;s hacking. Hugo thought, &quot;I could just change this hacker into a cock but let&#39;s see if I can use him instead.&quot; So Hugo told his computer back on the ship to research the hacker. The computer supplied everything it could find on the hacker.<br />
<br />
As Hugo read his computer output, he thought, &quot;So the hacker&#39;s name is George and he has a veiny cock.&quot; Even Hugo was surprised that his computer figured out that personal bit of information. Then again, his computer back on the ship was powerful enough to tap into every computer on Earth, even computers that weren&#39;t connected to the internet. There really wasn&#39;t any information that Hugo&#39;s computer couldn&#39;t find.<br />
<br />
It would be a while before George would show up so Hugo instructed his computer to make preparations. Meanwhile, Hugo looked over his journal to see how his dicks were progressing.<br />
<br />
#0 Steve<br />
#1 Danny<br />
#4 Dave<br />
#5 Troy<br />
#7 Perry<br />
#9 William<br />
#10 Jacob<br />
#10.5 Bryan<br />
#13 Brock<br />
<br />
Those are the only ones he numbered so far. He numbered Brock 13 because Brock seemed to be the unluckiest one. Besides losing and becoming a cock himself Brock&#39;s biggest complaint was that he hadn&#39;t gotten the before and after comparison he wanted. He kept begging Hugo to restore Bryan long enough to get a picture of his genitals attached to his body and then a picture of Bryan as just his genitals. He also complained the loudest about Jacob and Bryan&#39;s submissiveness to Jacob. &quot;Bryan should be covered in my cum.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan did complain but his protests were weak. This is an example of one conversation Hugo had with Bryan.<br />
<br />
Bryan: Please stop jerking Jacob off on me.<br />
<br />
Hugo: Why? Is it hurting you?<br />
<br />
Bryan: No, it&#39;s just . . . well . . .<br />
<br />
Hugo: Well what?<br />
<br />
Bryan: It&#39;s wrong.<br />
<br />
Hugo: Why is it wrong?<br />
<br />
Bryan: The Bible . . .<br />
<br />
Hugo: But you don&#39;t believe the Bible.<br />
<br />
Bryan: It&#39;s still wrong.<br />
<br />
Hugo: Why? You are a cock. You have orgasms because of Jacob. You enjoy it so what&#39;s wrong with it?<br />
<br />
Bryan stammered, &quot;Well I&#39;m a cock but . . . I&#39;m not a cock . . . uh . . . You turned me into a cock . . . &quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo said, &quot;You lost the bet. Brock still wants a before and after photo.&quot;<br />
<br />
Bryan stammered, &quot;Yea but I don&#39;t want any photos of me . . . &quot; And while Bryan tried to explain why he didn&#39;t want photos, the thought of Brock having photos of him as just a cock caused Bryan to erect. Bryan continued to complain until Bryan had an orgasm and covered himself in his own cum.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
Hugo&#39;s computer let Hugo know that George had arrived. Hugo used an invisibility device to make George think Hugo wasn&#39;t around. George snuck in but Hugo had set it up to allow George to think he was sneaking in undetected.<br />
<br />
While George was looking around, Hugo snuck up behind him and put an implant under George&#39;s skin. Then Hugo told his computer to activate Program George. George didn&#39;t notice a thing.<br />
<br />
Hugo went outside, removed the invisibility device and pretended like he just got home. Hugo pulled out a gun and shouted, &quot;Hey, who are you? How&#39;d you get into my house?&quot;<br />
<br />
George was scared. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just wanted Danny so bad. I wasn&#39;t going to take anything except Danny. Please let me go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo said, &quot;So you know I can turn men into dicks. You should also know that I can do so from a distance. I got a scan of you already, George, so any time I want, I can dick you even if you&#39;re miles away.&quot;<br />
<br />
George got on his knees and begged, &quot;Please don&#39;t dick me. I don&#39;t want to be a dick.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo said, &quot;Are you so sure about that? I&#39;ll make this a test. You may take Danny with you. He needs to attend his classes anyway. You can take him to his classes and take care of him. I will be monitoring you though so you better behave yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny protested, &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to turn me human again?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo said, &quot;Eventually, what&#39;s the rush. You&#39;re going to be able to continue your school work so why not stay a cock?&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny asked, &quot;How am I supposed to take the test when I have no hands?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hugo said, &quot;I&#39;ll give George some devices that can be your hands or do other things you need. Now George, Danny here is going to be completely dependent on you. You can turn his voice off so he can&#39;t speak and it will be up to you to set him in the other devices that he can use. If you don&#39;t help him, he will be just a helpless cock like any other. Make sure he continues his school work or you&#39;ll join him in my collection.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny tried to protest further but George accidentally muted him before gathering up Danny and the devices Hugo gave him and running out the door.<br />
<br />
*****<br />
<br />
That evening, George took Danny to join the rest of their study group: Jayden, Kyle, Reuben and Jack. Danny was so embarrassed to be sitting in the middle of the table in the library. Being a college library, it was okay to have things out that would be taboo in other libraries. They frowned on the students themselves getting naked but they made an exception for Danny. After all, there was an anatomical prop with male genitals just a few tables away. Everyone already knew the kinds of things they might see in the library and only those mature enough to handle it walked around where Danny was out.<br />
<br />
Jack commented, &quot;Danny looks so cute all shy like that.&quot;<br />
<br />
Danny looked pretty much like a brown fuzzy bean bag because with his cock so shriveled up to a nub, he was pretty much just his big balls. Danny was definitely more of a grower than he was a shower. Danny could still see but not very well because his &quot;head&quot; was nestled deep in his own flesh. The writing device set up for him was controlled by his thoughts so he was able to write whatever he needed to write but it would have still been easier if he could have stuck his head out to see what he was writing. He even tried to think of some sexual fantasies to arouse himself but then the thoughts of school work shriveled him back up again.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Reuben was having trouble concentrating as the thought of getting himself dicked was turning him on. This was part of what Hugo was hoping for. Maybe George carrying Danny around might convince others to join Hugo&#39;s collection. Another thing that Hugo hoped is that after a few days of Danny visiting his friends as a cock and being handled, he&#39;d get used to being a cock and stop asking to be returned to normal.</p>
