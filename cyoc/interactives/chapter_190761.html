<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Looking around for some cover, Li saw the perfect thing to cover her scent so she could keep going around the mall, a small perfume shop located in an outside strip between a candy shop and a mattress shop. Even better, it seemed like they were slower than usual as not even the two employees working the counter are doing anything. Li walked in and stood as wide as possible, filling the entire store with her scent and getting their attention.<br />
“Ma’am, can we help you with something?” the female one asked.<br />
“Hi, I need something that is strong enough to hide my scent. Hopefully something that can be applied pretty generously without being overbearing.”<br />
The two of them looked at each other confused, but then they got a whiff of the hyena anthro in front of them and nearly fainted. The male one gagged and sputtered while the female held her nose and tried talking to her.<br />
“My apologies, but I don’t think anything we have here will solve your problem. Can I suggest a bath bomb store with specialty soap products?”<br />
Li took offense to that, surprised that they had low-key told her perfume or cologne couldn’t break apart her musk. She had half a mind to complain, but then she remembered the challenge. They seemed like the perfect people to change. Grabbing the doors, she closed them tight, and set the shutters so they looked closed.<br />
“Hey, what do you think your-”<br />
Not even letting him finish his sentence, she turned a dial on her watch and set all the products in the display and on the shelves to explode, whether they had accelerants in them or not. The store was covered in a nauseating mix of fruity, masculine, musky flavors from the cologne bottles, making everyone evacuate through the back door. The two sales clerks stumbled out of the door in a hacking fit and failed to notice the hyena anthro preparing to tie them up. With a simple trip wire, Li had the two of them incapacitated, only able to inch around as their arms and legs were bound.<br />
“What do you think you’re doing you crazy bitch!? You can’t hold us hostage, it’s against the law!” the male one said with a hoarse tone due to the coughing and hacking. Li couldn’t help but put on an evil smile on front of them, she knew just how she was gonna change these two.<br />
<br />
“I’ve seen terrible work ethic before, but you two don’t even understand the basics of customer service. I’ve had a word with your boss and the two of you were about to be let go.” She watched them panic, neither one of them even tried to call her bluff. “However, I told them if I can reform you into better workers by the time they get here next week, they might consider keeping you around, maybe even raising your pay.” She watched them glow up, unaware of exactly what she was gonna do to them. She almost felt bad at how desperate they were to keep this job. Almost. Sitting them up on their knees, she turned them to face each other with just enough space for her to fit her body between them. Once they were in place, she stripped down into just a sweat-soaked bra, equally sweaty and stained panties, and sweaty socks that housed her equally sweaty paws. All the clothing somehow muted her musk, but with all that extra layering off, her body radiated an almost visible cloud of it. Li cradled the two heads between her armpits, telling them, “Your training begins now.”<br />
<br />
The two took deep whiffs of Li’s musky and furry armpits, not noticing their noses change with each sniff, the female employee taking a black nose while the male employee had a pink nose. White and pink fur took over his face while white and green fur overtook hers. They took longer and deeper sniffs as their ears moved up on their skulls, changing into skunk ears. They developed matching hairstyles with matching hair colors as they took in Li’s scent. Just as their heads had finished changing, Li pushed them from her body, giggling at their hypnotized state. “Now, what do you think about my armpits?” They stutters to get the words out, but the male one spoke up first. “Delicious, it’s perfect.” The female one added, “We should bottle that and sell it.” They looked at each other in agreement. She had successfully turned their minds and was getting a good start on their body. She stood up and turned her ass towards the male, putting her erect pseudo penis towards the female. “Next, my delicates. You will comment on and clean them.” Li then used her hands to spread her cheeks for the male to stick his newly-formed skunk muzzle in, leaving the female to suck her pseudo penis. She had to bite her lip to keep herself from orgasming all over the poor girl due to the amount of pleasure she was receiving. Li couldn’t contain herself, she clenched hard on the male’s face, covering him in ass sweat while she held the female’s head in place pouring her feminine juices down her throat. As the female swallowed her juices, the fur from her face spread down her neck and onto her chest. It settled in her stomach and ignited the rest of her changes, with her feet changing to paws, the fur covering her entire body, and a skunk tail forming all at once. While the female transformed, Li shoved her cock into the male’s ass and poured her girl cum into it, letting her musky fluids fill his body. Once she was good and drained, she sat down and watched the two skunks finish their transformations. The female had turned into a green and white skunk with average C cup breasts and a moderate sized ass, but a bit of a pouch for a belly, distinguishing her from the other skunk that became her twin. The male, while not having breasts, had a pretty large ass, longer hair, thick thighs, and no noticeable fat anywhere. He seemed more feminine than her, but they began to move in sync, think similar thoughts, and even dress similarly. Their clothing even changed to aprons with their names on it, the female twin calling herself Poppy and the male twin calling himself Prince. Li was just about finished with them when she rose her paws off the ground and left them in the air for the twins. “Sniff, clean, and remember who you are.” The twins obeyed as they cleaned her paws. Poppy worked her tongue around each toe, getting in between them and sucking in the beans, while Prince lathered her entire paw with his saliva first and sucked it off to clean it. Throughout the cleaning, the twins noticed Li’s musk dying down, but a new flavor filled their noses. They had developed their own skunk musk thanks to Li’s training. Now all they had to do was make sure that anyone that came in left feeling and smelling good. They remembered who they were, they were perfume skunks. Their job was to get humans used to their own smell and turning them into creatures through sex. They were commissioned by an outside contact and were helped by Li, a rich hyena anthro that had the black market under her musky foot paw. They wanted to be rivals, but they knew they could never be on her level, so they opted to be best friends w/ benefits instead.<br />
<br />
“Whew, that was one hell of a session Li.” Poppy said, stretching and flexing her tail. “Thanks for the heads up about our boss coming.”<br />
“Yeah no kidding, how can we make it up to you for saving our asses.” Prince questioned, cleaning the cum from his ass.<br />
Li thought about it and gave them a pretty good idea…</p>
