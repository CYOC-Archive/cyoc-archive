<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">One of Kyrena&#39;s men walked up and whispered something to her. Despite being a few feet away from him, she heard it perfectly; one of the advantages to having elfish ears.<br />
<br />
&quot;Princess, it seems my men have a request.&quot;<br />
<br />
Arianna looked up, still with a look of defiance on her face. But Kyrena had trapped enough aristocrats to know that it was nothing but a facade. In reality, she was terrified of what would happen next.<br />
<br />
&quot;My boys are starving for company, and since they don&#39;t have enough coin to go down to the tavern, they think you&#39;ll do just fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
Behind Arianna, small bottles were passed out to a select few, who drank them down quickly while the princess was distracted.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wha-what? I&#39;m not some common whore! Put your filthy hands on me, and my father will have them chopped off!!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you should be concerned about, Princess. Strip her!!&quot;<br />
<br />
A horde of men swept forward, tearing her clothes off and rubbing against her with their sweaty, leather-clad bodies. Arianna lay there completely naked, her hair freed from its braids into a tangled mess. Kyrena walked up and gave her a look-over.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not bad. Skinny, but you&#39;ve got some meat on your bones. And you certainly smell better than the local girls. Have at her, lads.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, she walked away. Arianna tried to speak up, but a ring of men formed around her. They then stepped back to allow the chosen few to enter. All of them were also naked, and ranged in body shape from well-toned to verging on obese. It was a disgusting sight.<br />
<br />
Suddenly, her arms were grabbed, and two men forced her to put her hands on their cocks, which quickly became erect. A third walked up, and forced his entire length in her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Forgive me, Your Highness, but your mouth is so warm.&quot; He spoke in a half-mocking tone that his friends soon emulated. &quot;Forgive us, Your Highness, forgive us!!!&quot; Then they laughed.<br />
<br />
Thoughts raced through Arianna&#39;s head. She wanted to yell. She wanted to take the big long thing in her mouth and bite it off like a freshly-cooked boar sausage. That would teach him, yes it would. She started moving the tip of her tongue up and down on his tip, and did the same with her hands. The men started to groan and whimper at their feelings of pleasure. They were letting their guard down.<br />
<br />
The more Arianna worked them, the more powerful she felt. Seconds before, these vicious animals were ready to tear her apart, but now they were slaves to their libidos. And if she played her cards rights, she might be able to bend them to her will.<br />
<br />
As she continued to suck, the cock in her mouth started to bulge. Arianna felt the pressure build up as the man reached climax, shooting his sperm and filling her cheeks. She had expected it to taste foul, but this tasted...rather delicious. She found herself swallowing it without hesitation. At the same time, the other two blew their loads, covering her breasts and throat with cum.<br />
<br />
Spitting out the dick, Arianna took stock of what was happening. She licked her lips and cleaned them of leftover sperm. Then, in full view of the men, she ran her finger across her nipple, gathered a line of cum, and slid that finger in her mouth. She slowly withdrew it, making sure to look as sensual as possible. <br />
<br />
Seeing the third man trying to back away, she grabbed his cock. &quot;You dare walk away from your princess before she&#39;s finished with you? Give me your seed. I want every drop!&quot;<br />
<br />
The man made no effort to move, so she slammed his still-erect dick back inside and blew him until he came again. And again. And again, until he begged her to let him go, he had nothing left to give.<br />
<br />
&quot;Out of my sight then!&quot; The commanding shriek in her voice was enough for most of the men to slink away. They had expected her to be scared, to fear them, but this was different. <br />
<br />
Arianna noticed, because she stood up and shouted at the others. &quot;Anyone else man enough to sleep with royalty? Get naked now!! As your future queen, I command you to cover me with your seed!!&quot;<br />
<br />
In the distance, Kyrena watched with undisguised glee. Next to her, Old Roger smirked. &quot;I must admit, I didn&#39;t think this would work.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Come now, old man, when have your potions ever failed me? Now the men have a whore they can play with whenever they want, and I have a companion. She&#39;ll grow into her own, and then we can add her to our merry band. How long will the effects take to kick in?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Depends. But in a few weeks, she&#39;ll be much bustier, taller, and probably have tanner skin and curlier hair. The exact specifications you gave me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And the king won&#39;t recognize her?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No. Our plan for His Majesty is just beginning.&quot;</p>
