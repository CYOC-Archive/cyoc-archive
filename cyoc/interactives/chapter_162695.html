<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Elleena giggles as she dragged Jamal to the dinner table, but their happiness were cut short. Waiting for them was their grumpy mother, about to finish her meal. She seems to be upset, and Jamal knew why. The two sat down as the awkward feeling over the table envelops them.<br />
<br />
&quot;What were you doing up in your room!?&quot; Jamal&#39;s mom, raised her eyebrow as she directed her question to him. &quot;Are you deaf, Jamal? We knocked on your door more than a few times, you didn’t hear atleast one!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal avoided his mom&#39;s death glare&#39;s. even though his in high school, he still couldn&#39;t stand against her mom, not even reason with her. He knows that any attempt he made will be shot down  immediately by her sermon. She wouldn&#39;t be called a tiger mom for no reason. <br />
Elleena felt bitter hearing her &#39;mom&#39; talking Jamal down. Even though she would always do it to poke fun out of him at times like this. after becoming Elleena, she felt chills just thinking of how delighted she was as Deena making Jamal feel horrible. Atleast this time, she wants to atone for Deena&#39;s actions.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no mom! Jamal was just taking nap!&quot; Elleena smiled. winking at Jamal telling him that she&#39;s on his side. &quot;He couldn&#39;t hear us knocking , mom. He was wearing headphones when he was taking a nap!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so!?&quot; their mom raised her elbows on the table, crossing her hands as she sends chills down Jamal&#39;s spine. &quot;Make sure that this won&#39;t happen again, young man! or I&#39;ll throw that computer down the garbage bin!&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal&#39;s heart just skipped a beat hearing that. Good thing he was able to come out of that with just a simple warning.&quot;Y-yes, Ma&#39;am!&quot; breathing with relief, he wanted to know why Elleena helped him out. but now&#39;s not the time for that.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now eat! The soups&#39; getting cold now.&quot; his mom continued eating as the two started to eat. Although technically, this was Elleena&#39;s second serving.<br />
<br />
Jamal took a bowl and immediately gulped down a serving of soup. common for a growing teenager, but compared to him. Elleena was eating twice as more than Jamal was eating. Elleena herself didn&#39;t notice that she was eating lightning fast. <br />
<br />
&quot;Slow down sweetie, no ones taking soup away from you!&quot; her mom spoke as she looked at her daughter looking like a squirrel, cheeks full of nuts. &quot;there&#39;s more in the kitchen if your that hungry.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal paused as he glanced at the squirrel girl across the table. looking like a toddler eating for the first time, Elleena was a mess, some of the soup were dripping down from her mouth to her chest. <br />
<br />
his mom stood and wiped off Elleena&#39;s mouth. Jamal once again sees another act of favoritism between him and his sister. Deena was always being babied like this for her to end up a spoiled brat, but Jamal wondered how would Elleena react to this. More importantly how did she fit 2/3  of the soup in the serving bowl!<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop it mom!! that&#39;s embarrassing&quot; Elleena blushed red as she held off her mother&#39;s attempt on wiping her mouth, taking the tissue off her mother&#39;s hands and wiped herself off.<br />
<br />
Her mom looked disappointed for a moment as she sat back on her seat. She wanted to pamper her sweet little girl even though, she was already in college. &#39;being a mother doesn&#39;t stop when her children go to high school&#39;, or in this case &#39;college&#39; as she would say, although she&#39;s favouring one of her children over the other.<br />
<br />
Jamal reached for another serving of soup when his mom popped another question. &quot;So how was school!? Did you get higher scores on your quizzes today!?&quot;<br />
<br />
Jamal smiled as he announced his accomplishment. &quot;It was great, I got B on all subjects, but English with B+!&quot; Jamal was proud of what he had achieved. Spending all his time studying finally paid off. for him that always get Ds most of the time, it was a huge step up!<br />
His mom let out a smirk. &quot;Only B+!? Jamal your in high school.&quot; pausing for a moment as she swallowed the food in her mouth. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be getting As or A+s by now!?&quot; she continued. <br />
<br />
&quot;Look at your sister now. She got a scholarship for her college because she worked harder, than you do. Please Jamal grow up and put more effort in your studies!&quot; his mom showed a face of concern, but all that Jamal could see was her cold eyes looking down on him.<br />
Elleena quickly followed it up.&quot;C&#39;mon mom. Atleast praise him for once!&quot; she was able take her attention away from Jamal. &quot;I think Jam did a great job today. It&#39;s not like he ever got an F in his class, right!?&quot;<br />
<br />
their mom fell quite for a moment as she sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. she ate one last bite before she stood and placed the left overs on the kitchen counter. &quot;Elleena, Jamal both of you take a shower after you finish eating your meal!&quot; she declared, as she drank water in the kitchen. &quot;you two both smell like sweat, but before that Jamal wash the dishes for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;but-&quot; Jamal tried to react, but her mother immediately made a follow up. &quot;No buts!! Just do as I say, understand!!?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; Jamal meekly answered as his mother went off to the living room, layed on the couch and turned the TV on. once again Jamal had another treatment of favouritism against him.</p>
