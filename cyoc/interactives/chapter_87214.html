<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Aidan bit his lip.  He was into all kinds of things, sure, but one thing that always got him going was a solid weight gain fantasy.  He&#39;d read all kinds of fiction.  Accidental gains.  Intentional.  Guys made to grow against their wills.  Small gains, big gains... enormous gains.  Each of them still managed to do it for him.  So that seemed like a good place to start.  Aidan Sterns would be a fat guy.<br />
<br />
He scrolled through, finding the right options, hovering over the weight options.  A check box.  Weight to gain. Fat. Muscle. Both.  Both had a set of percentage boxes...  that might be interesting later, but for now he didn&#39;t want any extra muscle.  He wanted pure flab.  He checked the box for fat and then scrolled down to a box asking what he&#39;d like his new weight to be.  Big.  That&#39;s what he wanted.  A kind of big that might cause people to double take when they passed him by.  He was getting harder just thinking of it.  His fingers hit the keys.  350.  He backspaced. 400.  Backspaced.  It wasn&#39;t permanent...  he could be bigger, at least for tonight.  With a wry smile he typed in 500.  Stared at it... then backspaced once more, changing the number to 501.  He wasn&#39;t sure why.  But that extra final pound made him think of himself becoming so much bigger, as if 500 was thin in comparison. <br />
<br />
When he clicked off the box, a warning popped up.  &quot;Attention:  You have opted to add a large quantity of non-muscle weight.  We suggest new users increase their fitness level when trying a change like this for the first time.  Would you like Chronivac to automatically adjust your fitness level?&quot;  He stared at it a moment.  His wry smile opening into a full on grin.  No, he didn&#39;t want that.  He wanted to feel like a fat guy.  He clicked no and saw a slider allowing him to choose between below average fitness, average, and above average.  He slid it down from average to moderately below and scanned for more options.  He once again clicked permanent until changed, others should be unaware, but he should be fully aware... and a new option.  &quot;Change wardrobe to match&quot;  Apparently it could make his clothing bigger too... but for now, he clicked no.<br />
<br />
It was ready.  He could barely contain his giddiness as his finger clicked begin.  There was a brief 3 second countdown as if it were taking a photo, where the word &quot;processing&quot; flashed on screen... and then it started.  Aidan&#39;s body started to puff.  It was a strange sensation. A tingling across his fairly athletic frame as bit by bit, new fat cells popped into existence beneath his skin.  Quickly he switched on his webcam and recorded, watching himself on screen as his clothing started to tighten.  He laughed out loud as his stomach started to push out from underneath the hem of his shirt and his chest swelled out into two handfuls of man boob.  The weight started to speed up.  He felt like he could hear his body groaning and stretching.  He studied his face on screen as it rounded out bigger and bigger.  His jeans started to cut into his waist, but he had to leave it alone.  Part of the fun.  He grunted and winced as the denim got tighter and tighter.  The seat starting to rip first.. but the tearing came from in front too.  The loop of his jeans suddenly giving way.  His belly seeming to sag a bit heavier and lower without his waistband supporting it.  Every inch of fabric was hugging a curve on his body.<br />
<br />
Already on screen he&#39;d gone from fit, to chubby, to undoubtedly fat now, and it wasn&#39;t stopping yet.  He could see the number for his real weight ticking up on the chronivac screen. 377.  &quot;God that&#39;s...  oh man...&quot; he muttered to himself, hand gripping his softening belly as the clothing he wore continued to shred.  A long tearing sound started beneath his armpits as the fabric of his shirt was pulled apart at the sides.  He twisted in his seat, arms up to see it happen, seeing rolls pinching on his side, and a growing sweep of fat of his swelling chest curving under his arm.  He noticed he jiggled when he moved.  His cock throbbed at the thought.  He couldn&#39;t bear to wait it out more.  He tugged at his shirt and helped it along the way, ripping it apart and tossing it aside, seeing the soft, pale curves of his now obese frame on screen.  He got to his feet, quaking slightly as he started to struggle out of his jeans, getting a bit warm and sweaty in the effort.  Kicking them down over his fatter calves and away from the computer.  His boxer briefs already opened on the sides, the waistband stretched to capacity, elastic starting to pang and snap. 479.. 480...481...  With a loud snap the underwear broke open, snapping him under his gut and making him flinch. &quot;OUCH!&quot;  He rubbed his soft overhang, seeing the red mark on screen as he pulled the cloth away and tossed it in the wastebin.<br />
<br />
The chronivac buzzed, letting him know it&#39;d had finished. 501 pounds was on screen.  With nervous laughter, Aidan grasped and prodded and explored his fat body.  He leaned over the computer, letting himself get a view of his now massive man tits as they hung in front of him, and stopped the recording on his computer.  Pulling the video back to the start, he was surprised to see the same fat body from start to finish, never thinner than it was now, mimicing every move he&#39;d made.  Even the computer wasn&#39;t aware he&#39;d never been fat...  weird.  He was hard as a rock, but to his amusement, it was harder to tell.  The fat on his groin had swollen up around his shaft and made it look a good 4 inches or more shorter.  Kind of a thrilling thought, actually...<br />
<br />
His mobile buzzed on his table.  His chubby hand picking it up, seeing a text from Geoff.  &quot;hittin the pub in 10 min. come with&quot;.  Aidan bit his lip again.  He could get the real fat guy experience and go out like this.  No one could tell he was hard anyway... so he texted back a &quot;sure&quot; and went back to the chronivac, telling it to change his wardrobe after all.  Waddling to his room, he grabbed his favorite shirt, now tent like in proportions, and struggled into it.  He grabbed his keys and lumbered down the stairs.  Jiggling and shaking.  Stairs creaking loudly below him, and belly escaping his shirt as it hiked up with every sway and shake.  His chubby hand swinging open the door onto the street, just as Geoff rounded a corner and waved to him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hungry big guy?  Let&#39;s go grab a bite while we&#39;re at it.&quot;  He said as he passed right by.  Aidan struggled to keep up, feeling warm, sweaty, and a little out of breath.  He huffed and puffed, and Geoff slowed down to make it a bit easier on him, wordlessly, like this was just something he did every day.</p>
