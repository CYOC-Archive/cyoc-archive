<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Ian strutted around the school halls.  In the guise of his former self, he reflected on all he had <br />
accomplished in such short time, all the improvements he had made.  Slowly but surely the school was being <br />
cleansed.  He had fixed that audacious faggot and stopped him from turning the school by encouraging his <br />
wicked ways.  He had repaired the relationship between son and parents, stopping him from spitting in the face <br />
of his true heritage and destiny.  Unwittingly he had even stopped the scourge who was pushing drugs on the <br />
students and trying to drag everyone into the pit of his addiction.  Yes, under Ian’s watchful eye and <br />
wrathful hand the school had been healed.  His mind was a judge he couldn’t shut off though.  Everyone around <br />
him was somehow at fault.  He saw lustful eyes and hungry mouths, every student was a sin and the rage and <br />
hatred plagued him constantly.  He wished he could change them all.  But he needed a drummer.  His phone <br />
vibrated, it was Conner.<br />
<br />
“Meet us in the music room, we’ve found the perfect drummer.”  Ian allowed himself a brief grin, finally <br />
everything was going to be complete.  Still seething disgust and contempt for those around him he strode to <br />
the music room.  Inside he found everyone from Understanding the Infinite gathered around, patiently waiting <br />
for him but Ian didn’t see the drummer.  They were all looking at him strangely too.  Ian tapped his foot <br />
impatiently.<br />
<br />
“So, where’s the new drummer guys?”  The band members exchanged glances before Conner spoke up.  In the short <br />
time since he had been inducted he had taken the unofficial role of band leader and spokesman.  Common for <br />
vocalist but Ian was surprised at how quickly and how well Conner had come into the role.  <br />
<br />
“He’s not here, we were just going to go get him but we needed you.”  Ian shrugged and gestured for them to <br />
lead the way.  They left the music room and as they were walking through the halls Ian absent mindedly <br />
scratched his face.  This body usually never needed to shave, unlike his ‘true’ form but had to happen <br />
eventually he guessed as he felt a few hairs poking out making him look like an awkward teenager.  As they <br />
went through the halls they passed some kids listening to metal.  Satan’s music of course.  Ian was about to <br />
shout at them but restrained himself, he just didn’t feel up to it right now.  He merely shrugged and flashed <br />
the kids a peace sign as he walked by.  He didn’t notice his hand was a bit smaller, his fingers short and <br />
stubby.  A shadow was also growing up his arm, a very noticeable golden brown tan adorned the tips of his <br />
fingers and began spreading across his hand, slowly engulfing his arm and causing it to swell.  His bis and <br />
tris packed on a ton of muscle, giving him a big arm, bigger than his shirt could hold even though it was <br />
baggy.  He pulled the sleeve up to let his arm breathe without even really paying attention.<br />
<br />
“So how far is this dude, I mean sinner” Ian said, correcting himself.  His voice sounded a little higher, and <br />
had a calmer tone than usual.  Lately his voice had been fiery and he almost always sounded angry but now his <br />
pitch was almost musical and slow like a gentle wave.  <br />
<br />
“Nah, he’s not that bad really, he jus has a little ways to go.  And we’re getting closer.”  Ian nodded, his <br />
longish hair moved a little more than it usually did as if caught in an invisible wind.  It didn’t seem as <br />
well cared for as it did this morning, it was thicker and unruly, a mess of dark blond that was ever so slowly <br />
inching down.  Some parts even seemed lighter, like he had just gotten highlights.  Ian’s mind was elsewhere, <br />
dwelling on the evils in the school.  Even with all he accomplished he still thought of all those left to <br />
judge.  Conner walked beside him, also seemingly lost in thought.  Ian wondered if he had gotten taller.  <br />
Conner was always a short guy, but now he didn’t seem too much shorter than Ian himself.  They were close to <br />
the same height even maybe an inch or two difference.  “So Ian I’m going to start working on the lyrics <br />
tonight, any suggestions?”  Ian tilted his head back, pushing the light blond bangs out of his eyes.  It was <br />
important to engrave a message, a lot of bands were about that brimstone style but how else do you reach <br />
people?<br />
<br />
“Well dude, that’s a tough one… but you know its like all about the love, gotta show them love, let them feel <br />
it” Ian said casually, a little shocked at his own words.  That wasn’t what he meant to say, he even swore <br />
there was a bit of a cali accent tinting his words but tried to shake it off.<br />
<br />
“I agree man, thanks.  Love and kindness are definitely what’s most important, people need to be shown that.”  <br />
Ian just nodded, a little unsure of what was going on.  He hoped they found this guy soon, this walk was <br />
taking a bit out of him.  It felt like shoes were too big or something, he had to struggle to avoid walking <br />
right out of them.  They were getting close to the pool though, Ian guessed that’s where they were headed.  He <br />
spotted a few shaggy haired surfer looking guys walking past them.  Normally he disliked them, especially <br />
their whole culture.  They were undisciplined, care free, loose.  The exact opposite of what Ian tried to be.  <br />
But as they walked past him he smiled and flashed them a hang ten with his other hand, not noticing it now <br />
sported the same stubby fingers his other hand did.  It too was small and very tan.  The surfers returned the <br />
sign and went on their way.  Ian adjusted his other sleeve as his right arm swelled to be as big as his left, <br />
two broad, golden brown and smooth pythons. Chyea he thought, I look pretty good.  Ian wasn’t too big on <br />
appearances but he enjoyed the way he looked, he tried to look welcoming and friendly because like that was <br />
just the kind of dude he was.  Made him look more approachable so he could share the love with other people.  <br />
He pulled at his shirt a little, wishing he could take it off, it was getting a little too tight.  <br />
<br />
“So dudes, we close?”  Ian asked with a very distinct SoCal accent now gracing his words.  Even his posture <br />
looked different, more humble and calm.  <br />
<br />
“Yup, he’s very close now” Conner responded happily.  They opened the doors and headed to the pool.  Ian <br />
blinked in the sunlight, his eyes becoming a beautiful, deep sea blue as he did.  His hair was now a mess of <br />
shaggy platinum blond locks falling past his shoulders.  “Hey Ian, its almost time, you should go change” <br />
Conner said.  Ian wasn’t sure what he meant by that but he nodded and went to the locker room.  Somehow he was <br />
guided to a locker which he knew to be his.  He pulled off his clothes, feeling relief as his broad, smooth <br />
and tan chest was revealed and allowed to breath.  His pecs were almost brown, large and firm.  A nice size <br />
for his age of… weird, he couldn’t remember his own age.  Oh well it would come back to him.  Ian wasn’t what <br />
you would call smart.  He wasn’t dumb he just didn’t know anything he really didn’t need to know and focused <br />
his brains on important stuff.  He stripped off the rest of his clothes and pulled out some from his locker.  <br />
He started with the white board shorts, etched with calming teal patterns made to look like waves.  As they <br />
went over his legs he lost a little more height, ending up five and a half feet tall.  Not that he minded, <br />
that was how god had made him.  His legs were just as tan and smooth as the rest of him, scarcely a hair <br />
remained on his body except some peach fuzz on his face and a little under his arms.  He slid on the two small <br />
flip flops on his feet.  They were small like the rest of him with stubby toes like his fingers but they got <br />
him through the water fast enough anyway.  Man he loved the water, when he wasn’t with his bros at the church <br />
he was always surfing or swimming or something.  He slid on the tight white compression shirt over his pecs, a <br />
blue symbol marking him as a life guard for the school.  He remembered being officially declared one at just <br />
15.  One of the best moments in his life, for sure.  The whistle and shades went on as his face regressed to <br />
that of a 16 year olds.  He had a round, cute face similar to Conner’s but much more tan, almost never seen <br />
without his favorite shades.  His pearl white teeth always on display as he sat in his chair, smiling, <br />
watching everyone have fun.  Shoot he thought, I need to be out there!  Ian hurried out, saying hi as everyone <br />
greeted him, he loved everyone and pretty much everyone loved him too.  He waved to Conner and the others as <br />
they came over, making sure he’d be at band practice after school.  Their band was set to have their first <br />
performance this weekend, he was so stoked.  Everything had finally come together and after a long upward hill <br />
battle the band was complete and ready to rock the world. <br />
<br />
The End.</p>
