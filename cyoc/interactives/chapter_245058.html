<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>This chapter most likely takes place further back than the present, possibly as far back as a month.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">While Muxing has become far less rigid than she was when she first converted, there were a few things she was unbending to. One thing she didn&#39;t want was for her honeymoon to be a public spectacle. She had not yet retired from the Five Elements formally, her apprentice still needing more time. And even if she had officially stepped down, she was still more than enough of a celebrity for people to want to take pictures of her and hound her for autographs. As such, she would prefer her honeymoon to be someplace quiet and remote, preferably with a deep forest or jungle. She had originally thought of Vilcabamba, but her new partners were more hesitant to go all the way to South America. Not just because of the various perils of the Amazon rainforest, but international tensions have been a bit strained. Yes, she and Li-Wei were Chinese and Fang was Tibetan, but some people may see them as American-influenced.<br />
<br />
Muxing was less willing to go to Ao Guang Island. In her opinion, that island was becoming more of a tourist trap. She&#39;d rather much spend her honeymoon someplace far quieter. However, they were able to reach a compromise. While they could have stayed in the penthouse suite of the Dragon King Palace, they chose to make their main abode in the inn within the Silent Grove. Muxing couldn&#39;t argue that the place was perfectly tranquil and offered true privacy. And if the stillness became too stifling, they had the option of leaving the grove to enjoy the rest of the island. Though Muxing had reasons for wanting uninterrupted privacy.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Since Muxing had began developing deeper feelings for Li-Wei, she has had fantasies regarding the two-headed, four-armed viper. Muxing hadn&#39;t really indulged in these fantasies as more than passing fancies. But eventually, she came to admit that she really was falling in love with Li-Wei. Or at least, she was falling in love with Li. The left-side head was the one who fully returned Muxing&#39;s affections. While Wei didn&#39;t dislike Muxing, he also felt that he and his brother should be considered more than just a package deal. Still, both of them were more than willing to play out Muxing&#39;s fantasies now.<br />
<br />
Muxing had little breath for more than moaning when she wasn&#39;t kissing Li. And Li was only not kissing her when he was sucking on her right tit. Her left tit had Wei&#39;s complete attention. The brothers&#39; four hands were also busy fondling and massaging all over Muxing from her shoulders to her hips. And their own hips were in constant motion as their dicks were keeping up a steady rhythm inside of her. When Muxing has originally been rescued from that sex cult, she didn&#39;t think she&#39;d ever welcome a penis inside of her. Now she had two hemipenises in her and she was loving every moment. Her tail wrapped around Li-Wei&#39;s urging to plunge deeper. Their joined body had practically double of everything, giving Muxing twice the pleasure she would have otherwise felt. Almost too soon, she could feel her core tightening. She squeezed Li-Wei, letting them know she was ready. He soon responded with a deep blast of snake seed into her waiting womb.<br />
<br />
Muxing sighed with bliss. This was hardly the first mating session she had with Li-Wei. Since the delay of their wedding, they have been feeling the urge to mate more often. Which was no surprise as breeding season was beginning with the Chinese tree viper. For all she knew, Muxing was already pregnant. It was harder to tell as the Chinese tree viper gave birth to live offspring instead of laying eggs. Even so, she was wanted to continue until she was absolutely sure. &quot;So, ready for another round?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not just yet,&quot; said Wei, &quot;We do want to leave some sperm for Fang.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, of course,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to deny hir a chance at motherhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Also, about that,&quot; said Li, &quot;We&#39;ve been talking about this and we think it&#39;s only fair that shi also has a chance at fatherhood.&quot;<br />
<br />
Muxing blinked in surprise. &quot;Are you saying you&#39;re fine with your wives cheating on you with each other?&quot; she asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Technically speaking, I&#39;m cheating on her every time I fully indulge you,&quot; said Wei.<br />
<br />
&quot;And the same with us,&quot; said Li, &quot;So you&#39;d be carrying Wei&#39;s eggs as much as Fang would be carrying my eggs. So as far as we&#39;re concerned, you two should be able to have your own fun.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It sounds like you&#39;re fine with being cuckolded,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound very normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We have two heads and four arms. Fang has both functional male and female reproductive organs. Oh, and in case you haven&#39;t noticed, we&#39;re giant talking snakes,&quot; said Wei in a tone dripping with sarcasm, &quot;Does any of that seem &#39;normal&#39; to you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Point well made,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t want to appear unfaithful.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Normality isn&#39;t necessarily the same thing as stability,&quot; said Li, &quot;I think we should just embrace what brings us closer together instead of trying to find divisions.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Wise words to live by,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;And not just applicable to our...unique relationship.&quot;<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
During the last few months, Muxing had plenty of time to get to know Fang better. A more cynical side of her had suspected that Fang was mainly using Wei&#39;s wanting his own mate to get closer to her. Fang had admitted shi was bisexual even before hir conversion. But Muxing came to see that Fang&#39;s affections towards Wei were true. Though that didn&#39;t stop Fang from being flirty with the mate of her mate&#39;s brother. And Muxing had been willing to indulge out of curiosity, though she didn&#39;t think their relationship could get closer than that.<br />
<br />
But then the twins gave their mates explicit permission to mate with each other. Unofficially, Muxing was just as much Fang&#39;s wife as she was Li-Wei&#39;s. She wasn&#39;t sure if that could be backed up in legal matters, but the three(four) of them weren&#39;t going to court over it. Well, vipers aren&#39;t really monogamous animals, so their instincts weren&#39;t really pushing against them. So Muxing didn&#39;t put up more of a protest other than to make sure Fang was agreeing to it.<br />
<br />
Fang not only agreed with it, but shi wanted to breed in a different area. The Secret Grotto was Ao Guang&#39;s equivalent of Lover&#39;s Lagoon on Mieni Atoll. It was not any easy place to get to without a boat, not unless you were an aquatic Animalian or a flying one. The two of them would have the absolutely privacy they desired to do whatever they want. Per Fang&#39;s request, they both wore bikinis that would be easy to take off.<br />
<br />
Muxing would have to admit that Fang was better at foreplay than Li-Wei. Being an uplifted animal, the twins initially had no greater concept of sex other than depositing their sperm into a recipient female. Fang had years to fantasize what shi&#39;d say to hir lover in the thralls of sex and can easily adjust those words to reflect hir new state of being.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, nothing from the tree, bush, or vine could taste sweeter than you,&quot; moaned Fang as shi thrust into Muxing, &quot;You truly are living nectar.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Laying it...a bit thick...aren&#39;t you?&quot; asked Muxing between gasps of pleasure.<br />
<br />
&quot;Haven&#39;t had...much opportunity...to say it out loud...&quot; grunted Fang.<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose...not...&quot; said Muxing, hugging Fang closer so their breasts were squeezed between them. Out of curiosity, she put her lips to one of Fang&#39;s nipples. A little sucking soon got milk flowing. It was a little more watery than Muxing expected, but then snakes weren&#39;t supposed to produce milk at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yeah...&quot; moaned Fang, &quot;You&#39;re bringing me...to the edge...&quot; Hir thrusting became more frantic and Muxing answered back as much as she could. Soon, they hit the breaking point and Fang&#39;s seed was shot in deep into Muxing.<br />
<br />
Muxing sighed and said, &quot;Between you and Li-Wei, I don&#39;t think I have to worry about getting pregnant.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, you won&#39;t,&quot; said Fang in a seductive tone, &quot;We&#39;re going to keep going until you&#39;re carrying both their eggs and mine.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will we know the difference?&quot; asked Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;We&#39;ll know any herm you give birth to will be mine,&quot; said Fang, &quot;It makes me wish you guys were all herms too.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Tempting, but I think not,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;Besides, we don&#39;t want to have too many hatchlings at once. Look what happened with the Anaconda family.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I&#39;d say we&#39;re different, but we also don&#39;t lay eggs,&quot; said Fang.<br />
<br />
&quot;Still, I think the four of us are just fine as we are,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;There may be more of us eventually, but I don&#39;t think we need to change ourselves more.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re here to take care of my male needs,&quot; said Fang, &quot;Wei is...a bit less willing to indulge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I suppose I couldn&#39;t blame him,&quot; said Muxing, &quot;The Animalian virus can&#39;t turn straight people (or animals) bi. Just don&#39;t try to push him into doing anything uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;And I&#39;m glad you like girls enough to be open with me,&quot; said Fang, idly stroking her cocks which were getting hard again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you still have some sperm to spend?&quot; asked Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Enough to be wasted,&quot; said Fang.<br />
<br />
Muxing sighed and said, &quot;Well, we can&#39;t let that happen. Though I think Li would be disappointed it none of my children has his DNA.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The only way he&#39;d know is if all of them are herms,&quot; said Fang, &quot;But if you have a two-headed or four-armed kid, you&#39;ll know who the father is.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While your hatchlings could have all or none,&quot; said Muxing.<br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s the gamble you make with genetics,&quot; said Fang.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
Honeymoons typically only last a week, but the tree vipers sorta milked it for as long as they could. At least everyone could understand why they wanted to prolong this and they have the money to keep staying in the Silent Grove inn. The only problem would be if someone else wanted to stay there.<br />
<br />
So the newlyweds were still there by the time the IAC started and that gave them reason enough to leave the Grove to watch the events. Eventually, people started noticing that Muxing and Fang&#39;s bellies were starting to swell. And seeing how Muxing&#39;s belly was bigger and faster, it was clear she was carrying more hatchlings. Now the only concern was if they had a home big enough to house them all.</p>
