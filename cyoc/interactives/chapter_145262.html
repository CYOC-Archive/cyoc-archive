<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Morning came fairly early, not so much with the sense of daylight coming in, as the cabin they were borrowing being closer to the surrounding woods had a fair amount of cover that block out a lot of light trying to come in, but the sound of a heavy knock on the cabin&#39;s front door. Moe heard it as he rolled over and noticed that it was fairly early in the morning, based on the clock.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is it?&quot; Nichole spoke, stirring awake as Moe moved and soon heard the knocking on the door as well. It was faint and she could barely hear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone&#39;s at the door,&quot; Moe answered as he stood up and made his way toward one of the windows to try and get a look down toward the driveway and the front door.<br />
<br />
The window on the north side of the room did give them some view of at least the driveway in front of the cabin. Daniel had assured him that thee would be little to no chance of the Gambonis finding them, but he approached the window with some caution. The Gambonis had tracked them before, even after police departments and even Federal agents had promised them protection. He trusted Daniel as a friend, and he and Officer Tara Strange were right that the cabin was remote enough that one would have to know about it to easily find it, but it didn&#39;t hurt to be careful. Moe approached the window and carefully pulled back on the curtains before looking down and out, where he found that he could see Officer Strange pacing between the front door and her vehicle. With that, Moe turned to Nichole.<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s Officer Strange... probably just a check in before she goes on shift,&quot; Moe said to his wife, &quot;which means that like Daniel... her shift starts early.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nichole sighed and nodded and joined her husband in getting up. If Officer Strange was checking on them, the visit was official and would be safe, which would mean that they would need to answer the door. It didn&#39;t take much to put on some clothes, mostly as when they&#39;d packed they hadn&#39;t packed anything fancy. She soon followed Moe downstairs and to the door and opened it as Tara began returning to the door to the cabin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, sleep well?&quot; Tara asked as she approached.<br />
<br />
&quot;Reasonably well... given all the activity,&quot; Nichole commented.<br />
<br />
Tara nodded, &quot;Yeah... that is something that does hover around Moon Lake, though those of us who are &quot;Moon Lake normals&quot; are fairly used to it. And for the most part... it&#39;s generally husbands and wives... or same sex couples being intimate with each other. Nothing that gets too far from what normal married couples would get into...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Most married couples don&#39;t turn into animals at will,&quot; Moe pointed out.<br />
<br />
&quot;True,&quot; Tara chuckled, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t mean Moon Lake&#39;s weres don&#39;t love each other. I trust that might have been the only disturbance?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Moe answered, &quot;that appeared to be the &quot;worst&quot; of it, which did let us sleep.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good,&quot; Tara nodded, &quot;hopefully the sting operation will go today... If it does, you&#39;ll be the first to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Nichole answered, &quot;we&#39;ll try to reimburse you for anything eaten...&quot;<br />
<br />
Tara only raised her arms and waved them downward, as if to calm them, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. This issue is a tense one. We&#39;re just doing what we can to keep you safe. Once the Gambonis are taken care of, then we&#39;ll worry about some of these issues... Anyway... I need to be on my way.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that, Tara turned gave a wave and returned to her car. That let Moe and Nichole shut the door and then turn to head back in and prepare for breakfast, since they were already up. They had the intent of being quiet, as the sunlight was only starting to peak over the trees and they&#39;d heard no sign of Karen when they left the bedroom they&#39;d had to sleep in. In this, they assumed that Karen was still asleep. However as they crossed the living room to head towards the kitchen, they were proved wrong by Karen coming downstairs as well. She rubbed her eyes and was a bit sleepy, though Moe and Nichole could only guess that was due to some of the outside noises that went on during the night. They didn&#39;t know on some of Karen&#39;s extra curricular activities that had gone on in the night.<br />
<br />
&quot;Morning, dear,&quot; Nichole said softly, watching Karen yawn, &quot;sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly,&quot; Karen answered, &quot;though... I heard you guys talking about something.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That was just Officer Strange checking in on her way to work,&quot; Moe answered as they made their way into the kitchen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sorry if we woke you,&quot; Nichole added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Did they catch Marcus, yet?&quot; Karen asked, hoping that her parents wouldn&#39;t get into any real detail on her night. Karen really didn&#39;t want to let it out that she&#39;d been paying a bit more direct attention to what was going on outside and had wandered out onto the back porch of the cabin. She didn&#39;t want to explain her actions, for while Oliver didn&#39;t seem to be too bad, the instructions that the Charlestons had been given wouldn&#39;t necessarily allow for going outside. Not to mention that her parents wouldn&#39;t likely approve of the specific things that she&#39;d done or allowed.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Moe answered, &quot;mostly just a check in on how the night went. How did it go for you? Did you sleep well?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fairly well... though I had a lot on my mind... Marcus and all that,&quot; Karen spoke, giving her worries about the threat the Gambonis posed being the reason for any difficulty she might have had. &quot;You?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I slept well too,&quot; Nichole commented while Moe went about getting things set up to brew some coffee. Her mind still wrestled with some of the other odd things that surrounded Moon Lake and all that went in it. She knew that Moe had had some of the same worries and thoughts. Both of them were a bit embarrassed by how at times both of them seemed more like there might be the encouragement for her and Moe to join were society, which Nichole still felt resistant to. She could learn to accept and get used to Daniel and Fran becoming weres, and if Karen was willing to educate herself on what she&#39;d be getting into, she might accept Karen becoming a were if she really wanted to. But that didn&#39;t mean Nichole wanted to be a were herself, but yet there were at times the strange pull that related to Moon Lake. It was almost otherworldly.<br />
<br />
If Karen caught on to that, she said nothing about and simply gave a small smile and answered, &quot;well... that&#39;s good.&quot;</p>
