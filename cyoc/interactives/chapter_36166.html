<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Remus and Julie ran through the woods until they were sure that they had lost their pursuit.  It had been difficult in the beginning as they had been overflown by witches and wizards on their brooms but once they had entered into the woods they had been able to turn the tables quite quickly.  They had killed three before the fliers retreated.  They had then jumped from tree branch to tree branch for a few miles before returning back to the ground.  Remus grabbed Julie by the shoulder and said, &quot;It's best if we turn back to our human forms.  It'll make us harder to track and once we reach the rebel camp, we'll be less likely to turn heads.  I can't promise you anything but please don't hurt anyone.  They're like family to me and I've trusted them with my life.  I don't want this act to be a betrayal.&quot;  Julie nodded and her extra arms and breasts pulled back into her torso and her skin changed back to its normal hue.  Her top changed into a crimson shirt that was buttoned up to her bosom.  Her skirt became a flowing black dress that touched the ground.  Remus fur began falling out at a fast rate and his muzzle pulled in.  His shirt was ruined but his pants were still in good condition.  They didn't have to walk far until Julie looked up in the trees and saw figures hiding up in the branches.  Remus saw her looking and said, &quot;Everyone of them has their wand pointed on us and is ready to do something if we act the wrong way.&quot;  Julie nodded and shrugged before saying in an unconcerned tone, &quot;That's a bad strategy, if there was anyone else following us than they'll know where the scouts are and be able to catch them unawares.&quot;  Remus shrugged, there were flaws an any plan.  Now that he had decided to join this new Dark Lord, it wouldn't be his concern for long.<br />
<br />
They entered into the rebel camp and it was in a well shaded glen, protected from any fliers by the tree cover and a burrow had been formed in a nearby hillock.  Julie would describe the camp as being very withdrawn and suspicious.  Julie saw children were being hidden in some tents that were along the pathway.  It was a large camp and probably held over a hundred people by the size of it.  Once they reached the entrance to the burrow they stood in front of the Burrow by a brazier waiting.  Julie wondered how long she would have to wait, thinking it only fair that she give the rebel leader as much time as she had given the King and Queen.  Her thoughts stilled though as a figure in black robes emerged, accompanied by three others.  The leader pulled back the hood of his robe to reveal a strong face with unruly black hair and gold wire glasses which kept his green eyes from being overwhelming.  He held out his hand to Julie and she shook it firmly.  Remus was ramrod straight as he announced, &quot;Harry Gaunt, leader of the Death Eaters and bearer of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's spirit, may I present Julie, Emissary of the Dark Lord Kenan, Demon of the Third Circle, and assassin of Queen Umbridge.&quot;  The look of casual interest changed to surprise in a flash as each realized who and what they were dealing with.  Julie looked to the side and was amazed to see a banner flying a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth.  Julie looked at Harry and knew that if there had been a lightning shaped scar on his forehead then she would have no doubt.  He matched every description she had ever read on him and unconsciously whispered, &quot;Harry Potter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Harry's surprise had changed into suspicion, &quot;Where did you hear that name?  I haven't used that alias since my time at Hogwarts.&quot;  Julie knew she had overstepped but she decided to be honest, &quot;I've read some things about you, Mr. Gaunt.  It was obviously inaccurate and I would be interested in learning more about you but I must deliver a message first.  My master, the Dark Lord Kenan, seeks to conquer this world and tap its powerful magics.  He realizes the difficulty of the task and he has no real interest of ruling after he accomplishes his goal.  To that he will leave to those people that join his cause.  I promise you that his powers are great and your enemies will fall to him.  Queen Delores is dead by my own hands for failure to surrender.&quot; This caused everyone to stiffen and put their hands to their hips but Julie went on, &quot;I have made a promise to Sir Remus that I will not punish this camp if they don't join but Kenan will not abide a dangerous group like this one to exist outside his domain.  The terms are this, Join now and rule this kingdom later or refuse this offer and be ruled, tortured, enslaved, and killed.  Do you accept the terms?&quot;  Julie kept her voice level and continued to stare Harry in the eyes.  Harry didn't flinch and pondered the proposal carefully.  <br />
<br />
Finally he came to a decision, &quot;When I was a child I was raised by one of the most powerful wizards of this age.  He came when I was but a babe suckling my mother's tit and killed my birth father and mother.  He would have struck me down as well but in me he saw my potential and in a moment of weakness, granted mercy by allowed me a portion of his soul and naming me the heir to his power.  As I grew he taught me the ways of the world and the ways of power.  I grew strong on those teachings and then I was sent on my disciple test to kill the headmaster of Hogwarts.  While there I learned that my father was confused and his teachings conflicted.  I met adult pure bloods who barely had enough power to lift a feather and mud blood children who could slay trolls.  My eyes were opened and I knew that only the strong deserve to rule, whoever they may be, and the weak must bow down and accept their fate or prove their strength that they may be acknowledged.  With this doctrine, I showed the weakness of my father and slayed him for his weakness.  One day, the weakness in my doctrine may come to light and I will welcome the day when it comes.  For our faith will only be made the stronger as that which is weak is destroyed until we achieve perfection and death no longer separates us.  Julie, I will not bow to your master unless he can show himself worthy of my servitude.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie was impressed by Harry's words and realized that most of her questions had been answered.  Voldemort had raised Harry, but the boy had turned on his master and killed him, for all Julie knew he had probably killed Dumbledore as well.  Dangerous but Julie was willing to play along.  &quot;Name your challenge and I'll prove my strength to you.&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;Excellent, we shall have a duel and the winner shall claim leadership of the Death Eaters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie nodded, &quot;And the terms for winning?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple, until the other surrenders or is dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Agreed.&quot;  As the word left her mouth, Julie watched as Harry whipped his wand out and bellowed, &quot;ADAVARA KADAVARA&quot;  Julie screamed as a green light washed over her and her lungs collapsed cutting her scream short, her heart stopped, and blood vessels in her brain.  Julie toppled to the ground and Harry kicked some dirt at the body.  &quot;A proper burial for a weakling.&quot;  Harry was about to turn away when a gasp came from Julie and she propped herself up as a thin stream of blood trickled from her nose.  &quot;I see the gloves are off,  well I won't fool around with you.&quot; Harry was taken aback by the impossibility of someone surviving the death curse.  The smell of sulfur became thick in the air as Julie's flesh turned to black iron until she looked like some kind of golem.  Her hair fell out and her face smoothed out until it was a blank sphere.  Silver spikes began to grow all over her body and face.<br />
<br />
Harry started to back away before firing another curse off but the magic bounced off the demon's skin and Julie walked to him matter of factly before grabbing him by the shoulder, spikes puncturing him and drawing blood.  Harry tried to resist but Julie's strength was inhuman and she placed her other hand on Harry's back.  Harry quaked in fear, for the first time forced to realize his own mortality and he tried to look into Julie's eyes and beg for mercy but spikes had grown where her eyes should have been.  Harry knew that if this demon tightened her grip and pulled him into a hug, that he would be dead in a matter of moments.  &quot;I yield, the Death Eaters are yours to command.  Lead us so that we will be strong and death itself will be unable to defeat us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie released her hold on Harry the spikes receded as her flesh turned from black iron to demoness red.  Her wings sprouted from her back and her hair grew down to her back.  &quot;You will serve the Dark Lord Kenan and you will be his officers and advisers.  You will help me acquire the Cloak of Invisibility and the Shade Stone or the Hollows, as Queen Umbridge called them before I sent her to Hell.  Heal Harry as well, he will play a critical part in my future plans.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie watched in interest as the subdued camp exploded into action.  The three hooded figures that had followed Harry out of the Burrow knelt next to Harry and began tending to his wounds, waving their wands over his pale body.  When they had finished they prostrated themselves before her.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;  Julie asked and as they removed their hoods Julie thought she already knew.  Before any of them could speak she pointed to each in turn.  &quot;You are Ron Weasley, Hermoine Granger, and Ginny Weasley.&quot;  Hermoine nodded,&quot;Yes Lady Julie, we used to go by those names but now I am Hermoine Weasley, Ron's wife, and that is Ginny Gaunt.&quot;  The red headed witch was crying but she was trying hard to contain her tears.  &quot;I am indebted to you, my lady, for not punishing my husband for his weakness, and relieving my children of their father.  I will do anything you ask in thanks for this gift.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie placed her hand lifted up the witch's face up to look into her face.  After reading about Ginny and Harry's romance, Julie had always wondered what the girl looked like.  What Julie saw was lovely and Julie was struck by Ginny's beauty and Julie slid her hand down Ginny's robe.  Ginny's eyes widened with shock and Ron looked like he was about to protest before Hermoine forced his head back down to the ground.  &quot;I may ask for a lot, are you still willing?&quot;  Ginny began to feel a warmth flowing into her body from Julie's hand and she felt herself responding to the contact.  Her face flushed and then she opened her robes and showed off her bare breasts.  &quot;I would give my whole soul for Harry's life, if that is what you ask for.&quot;  Julie pulled Ginny's robes shut and said,&quot;I will not ask for your whole soul, you can keep on loving Harry, but I will definitely take a part of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hermoine got Julie's attention and said,&quot;We already have the Hollows you seek and will give them to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Julie was glad to hear that and then turned back to the camp.  &quot;Tomorrow, we shall go march on the capital.  I will alert Kenan of my success and he will send his army to join us.  Soon, this land shall be under our control and the foundation of a great empire will have been laid.&quot;  Julie looked over at Remus, bent to one knee with his son and a small woman with bubblegum pink hair.  Julie knew that she could make good use of Nymphadora Tonks and her shapeshifting.<br />
<br />
Julie smiled, her mind racing at the possibilities at what she could accomplish with this army.  If she played her cards right, she just might be able to break free of Kenan's hold on her.  What she would do after that, not even she was sure of.</p>
