<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Drake remembered he had a boat trip with his friends at morning. He thought that was an excellent opportunity to play with his new device and experiment on his friends. So, he prepared his stuff for the trip while he kept enjoying his improved physique.<br />
<br />
The next day, Drake and his friends were arriving to their meeting point bringing every kind of stuff to get a memorable experience; fishing rods, bathing suits, food and, obviously, a lot of beers. All of them seemed very excited until their last friend arrived.<br />
<br />
When Ethan arrived, he had a big cooler full of beers, sea food and stuff. That was ok to everyone, but what they didn&#39;t like is that holding Ethan&#39;s right arm was a boy, probably 6 or 7 years old, shyly looking at the big boys that were staring at him.<br />
<br />
Ethan introduced the kid as his nephew Harry, and  he explained that he had forgotten he had promised his older sister to take care of him in that day. He tried to find a babysitter but he couldn&#39;t in the short time he had. Drake and the others just sighed and accepted it.<br />
<br />
Their boat trip started and everyone started to drink and talk to each other, however each time they look around they noticed the shy little boy in the corner and their mood went down. It&#39;s like they were containing themselves to act like decent people and not like they really wanted.<br />
<br />
Drake noticed it and realized that he needed to do something about it. He had the palm-piolet in his bag and he only needed a moment to take it and make his magic. When he heard that the boy was looking for the bathroom, he knew that was his opportunity.<br />
<br />
Ethan told his nephew that the boat was quite small and it didn&#39;t have a bathroom, if he was going to pee he could do it on the sea. Harry had already watched some of his uncle&#39;s friends doing that but he didn&#39;t feel too comfortable to do the same.<br />
<br />
While Ethan and Harry were talking, Drake approached them and offered to help Harry in order that no one will see him peeing on the sea. Ethan thanked his friend and went back to his spot in the boat. When Drake was alone with Harry, he told the kid he would stay behind him as a wall, so nobody will see him.<br />
<br />
Harry reluctantly agreed while he unzipped his jeans. Drake was wondering why this kid came with jeans to a boat trip when he could be wearing swimming trunks or something like that. While he has thinking about and hearing the boys pissing from behind him, he took the palm-piolet and started typing.<br />
<br />
Harry began to feel dizzy and it wasn’t because of the boat. His stomach felt super weird and his body was starting to heat up really quick. He wanted to hold his stomach but he was still pissing, so he just fell to his knees. Ethan and his friend immediately noticed it the boy&#39;s piss was moving through their feet.<br />
<br />
Harry&#39;s temperature was super high. He didn’t know what was happening but his clothes began to feel really tight. &quot;Dude! What&#39;s happening to the kid?! He’s getting bigger!&quot; One of Drake&#39;s friend shouted. Harry could feel his body pushing against the fabric of his clothing, slowly hearing it tear and rip as his body began to swell all over.<br />
<br />
Harry felt as his arms began to get really big with muscle. This caused his sleeves to completely shred off his body, next he could feel his back starting to widen. &quot;Ugh! please somebody…help.&quot; Harry said as the pain started to kick in. His shirt was holding on by only some threads but this wouldn’t last long as the rest of his torso began to develop.<br />
<br />
His chest popped out ripping the front of his shirt open followed by a nice set of abs forming. &quot;Drake, what the hell is happening to my nephew?!&quot; Ethan shouted while he watched the broad back and shoulders that Harry had now. Everyone was in awe as they looked upon what was happening to Ethan&#39;s nephew.<br />
<br />
Drake was speechless and just stood there watching with a little smile on his face at the growing boy. Harry could feel the heat starting to move down his body and into his legs and feet. His pants began to feel really really tight as his legs started to stretch and gain more muscle. His feet tripled in size as they suddenly grew to a whopping and very manly size 15.<br />
<br />
The heat was so strong and Harry knew it wasn’t stopping anytime soon. He could feel his pants starting to rip as his hips widened followed by his butt getting larger. Harry knew his pants weren’t lasting much longer as he heard loud rips and tears beginning to happen. He didn’t want to see what was going on back there.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! I can’t watch this anymore, we should go back and call for help!&quot; Ethan shouted while he stared in awe some hairs growing on Harry&#39;s bubble butt. Everyone else were still in shock as they continued to watch this supposed 7 years old kid growing uncontrollably.<br />
<br />
Harry started to feel heat in his face. &quot;Aahh! Wha-What’s happening to me?!&quot; Harry said in his now low manly voice that now matched with Ethan&#39;s and his friends&#39;. Harry quickly cupped his exposed balls and dick trying to contain them as a strong vibration began to form around them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oooooh! My pee-pee hurts! Somebody help!!&quot; Harry pleaded as he could feel his balls expanding in size and dick enlarging rapidly in his hand. A lot of hair suddenly bursted out of his crotch while his dick was getting hard and his balls were thickening and hanging low and hairy now. Everyone can see his new set dangling from behind.<br />
<br />
Harry was practically naked now. The only thing on him was a tight piece of fabric leftover from his jeans that could and would burst at any moment. Harry then passed out from exhaustion on fell in the boat giving a perfect to everyone, including his uncle Ethan to watch his newly grown body.<br />
<br />
Once a small and lively 7 year old Harry was now laid a hirsute, large, bulging and muscular man around the same age of the rest of the guys on that boat. If they hadn&#39;t seen him growing up, they could easily mistake him as one of the other guys in their campus, maybe one of the jocks that plays football or wrestling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drake…what just happened man?!&quot; Ethan asked without taking his eyes from Harry&#39;s throbbing veiny cock. Drake stood there in surprise but still but managed to respond, &quot;I don&#39;t know man! The kid was just pissing on the sea when he started to grow!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Dude! What&#39;s that thing I&#39;m your hands?!&quot; One of their friends asked when he noticed the palm-piolet. &quot;Is that thing related to what happened to Ethan&#39;s nephew?!&quot; Everyone else, including Ethan started to question Drake a lot, and he felt obligated to tell them the truth or at least part of it.<br />
<br />
&quot;He wanted to be one of us! So, I thought I’d give him a little bit of help!&quot; Drake answered. &quot;How did you even make that happen?!&quot; Ethan yelled while Drake tried to explain how the palm-piolet works. At first, they were skeptical but when Drake used the device once again to turn the piece of fabric on Harry into a tight black speedo they were finally convinced.<br />
<br />
&quot;Damn man! What am I supposed to tell my sister now?! This dude is even bigger than me!!&quot; Ethan shouted. &quot;Have you seen the size of his feet? I felt intimidated by my own nephew!&quot; Drake almost bursts in laughs before he replied.<br />
<br />
&quot;Calm down, man. I can turn him back to normal in any moment with this thing. I only plan to keep him like that for the rest of our road. That&#39;s all.&quot; He was proudly showing his palm-piolet when a sudden shake made him lose balance and his magic device fell on the water.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh shit!!&quot; Drake shouted while he desperately tried to recover his palm-piolet but he only watch it sinking. On the other hand, Ethan was noticing that his nephew was already waking up and he would want to hear an explanation of what happened to him.</p>
