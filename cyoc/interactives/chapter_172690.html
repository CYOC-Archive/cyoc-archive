<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>this is a lengthy one, but hopefully my collab partner will know where to take it next :)</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After collecting Jeff&#39;s clothes, the two of them began to thread their way out of the pool-enclosed area, and through the yard, Jeff following Brianna toward the house. There was only a moment of pause as his mom caught sight of them, in the middle of conversation with the parents of one of Tim&#39;s friends. She shot him a stern look, but it eased when she saw the way he and Brianna were swaddled in towels. Particularly the way Jeff was wrapped up -- she was assuming his modesty was due to wearing a thong bikini alone, even if the real reason was that said bikini had created a wardrobe malfunction due to his mutant genitals. Jeff was fine with this false impression, and clearly she thought her son had kept his word. However, not wanting to risk her wrath again, he called across to her as they went by, to tell her that he was going inside to hang out with Brianna.<br />
<br />
That was enough, and she nodded primly before turning back to the other guests.<br />
<br />
Brianna let them inside and indicated for him to follow upstairs. The Fergusons had a nice house, and the second story was just as spacious as the first, with all the bedrooms upstairs -- Brianna&#39;s, her parent&#39;s, and her brother&#39;s -- as well as a guest room, and two bathrooms, one each for the adults and kids. She directed him into the one she shared with Tim, while she went into her bedroom to get dressed, flashing him a brief smile before she closed the door.<br />
<br />
Alone again, Jeff unwrapped himself, and then carefully began extracting the bikini bottom from where it was wedged, which felt like it was practically inside him. Behind, it slid out from his butt, and in front, down his left thigh, the troublesome material dragging lightly along the side of the breast, which wobbled briefly as if it was mocking him, the scraping of the swimsuit over sensitive skin making him grunt in discomfort.<br />
<br />
Frowning, he placed the bikini bottom on the side of the bathroom counter next to the matching top, and as he did so, Jeff caught sight of his naked body in the bathroom mirror.<br />
<br />
Above average height, halfway athletic build with some good definition in the arms and legs and chest, a pleasant but not uber memorable face, medium length light-brown wavy hair -- Jeff had always been content with his looks. He wasn&#39;t a supermodel, not having the personality or vanity to want to stand out that way, but he was happy with who he was.<br />
<br />
Now, in the middle of it all, at the junction of his -- due to the transformation -- smooth hairless abdomen and crotch, was that bubble of soft flesh, the little pink nub sitting at the centre like a cherry on top of the misfortune that seemed like it was trying to destroy his life.<br />
<br />
Frustrated at source of all his recent hassles, Jeff glared at the reflection of the feminine mass, and reached for his towel, quickly wiping the remainder of the dampness off his torso and legs. Then, the pants, his instinctual pissed-off reaction being to get clothes on and put the infernal thing out of his sight. Immediately though, he remembered something he had forgotten about since he had left the pool shed.<br />
<br />
The bra-cup.<br />
<br />
Making it upstairs with the towel had been one thing, as the wound-up cloth had made the difficulty of moving with the crotch-breast a little less bothersome, but normal clothes? The bra had been uncomfortable, but it had held the breast in place and given it a smaller profile, even if just by a little. Jeff pulled the sweatpants up, grimacing as he noted the more expansive bulge that &#39;freeballing&#39; created. He could still hide it if he were very careful, but the breast was definitely going to jostle around more from movement, and walking would appear strange. Pulling on his upper layers, Jeff sighed to himself, resigned to the fact that he would have to play it very clever. He wasn&#39;t going to screw anything with Brianna up! She&#39;d invited him in this far, he just had to play it cool, and maybe in a day or two once he was back to normal?<br />
<br />
He could get through this.<br />
<br />
Self-confidence bolstered, Jeff left the bathroom, holding the towel in front of his body to minimise the chance of detection. Brianna&#39;s door was open, and when he poked his head inside, she was finishing setting up cushions and blankets on her double bed, just opposite a big-screen TV. Bouncing across, she ushered him in and shut the door, giving a perky grin.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh, these are y-yours.&quot; Jeff handed her both parts of the bikini, and the weight of the tiny strips of material leaving his hand felt like her removing the troubles he&#39;d been through whilst wearing it.<br />
<br />
&quot;You weren&#39;t tempted to keep it as a souvenir?&quot; She winked dramatically, giggling, and he instantly flushed red, which only made her giggle more. &quot;I&#39;m joking! You&#39;re really easy to tease, you know that? You wouldn&#39;t do that though, you&#39;re a nice guy, not a creep. Here, let me take that and chuck it in the hamper while you get comfy.&quot; Before he could protest, she took the towel off him. That was his cue to start moving, hoping to get past her before she could notice the unnatural bobbing movement of his crotch. For a moment, he thought Brianna might have glimpsed something as she dodged by on her way out into the hall, her eyes seeming to flick over him once in passing, but he put it out of mind as he finished his short dash to the sanctuary of blankets and pillows. The crotch-breast was slapping back and forth inside his pants with wild abandon, and though it stopped short of really hurting, it was still mildly painful, and he bit his lip while he parked himself in place, letting out a stressed breath as the agitated mammary calmed, and the discomfort faded.<br />
<br />
A minute later, Brianna was back, two sodas in hand. Flicking off the light, with the curtains drawn in the late afternoon, the room was semi-dark. She was across next to him before he knew it, offering one of the cans, and then snuggling into the blankets beside him. They were close enough that their shoulders were just touching.<br />
<br />
&quot;You said you hadn&#39;t seen the last Marvel movie, so I figured you wouldn&#39;t mind. It&#39;s really good, and an hour or two of kickass has gotta beat a yard full of Tim&#39;s bratty friends, am I right?&quot; She nudged him and her tone shifted to more serious. &quot;Feeling better? You seemed kind of unhappy down there. I know we don&#39;t know each other super well, but I wanted to kill the tension. You looked like you needed a friend.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, you did. I do feel better.&quot; Jeff&#39;s worries had melted away for maybe the first time since he&#39;d come to the Ferguson&#39;s, and it was all thanks to Brianna. She shot him a smile, which he returned, and his heart fluttered. For now, Jeff felt like he could forget about his predicament and enjoy himself. He wasn&#39;t in any real danger of being found out, and he was getting some alone time with his crush, who was an amazing host. Maybe this party would turn out okay after all?<br />
<br />
&quot;Good.&quot; She pointed the remote at the DVD player, and hit play, the menu vanishing from the screen as the movie started, and then she cracked her soda. Jeff did the same, confident his empty bladder could safely handle a single can. With that, they got cozy, and began to watch.<br />
<br />
The time flew by. Brianna was right about the choice of viewing -- the action, special effects, witty one-liners, clashing super heroes -- it was entertaining in all the ways Jeff had anticipated from a Marvel film. Though, as they got nearer the end, into the last few minutes of the movie, he began to find it harder to concentrate, and the cause was a light prickling in his bottom half.<br />
<br />
At first it was just a little irritation, barely enough to notice. Then the feeling grew as the minutes passed, stronger and stronger, until it reached a steady hot buzz around his groin. Itching! The one place he had avoided rubbing dry with the towel was his crotch -- for very obvious reasons -- and Jeff was realising that the chlorinated water had now fully dried on and was irritating him down there. Biting his tongue, he suppressed the urge to squirm in his seat and simply stick his hand down his pants and scratch all around it. He had to just ride this out! He had endured worse at this party, this was nothing! This was fine, he could-<br />
<br />
Actually, no, he couldn&#39;t.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the transformation, his nether regions were very sensitive, and even a simple itch was like the delicate skin being on fire.<br />
<br />
It might not have been actually intensifying, but to Jeff it felt like he was about to combust, and he couldn&#39;t bear it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Um, Brianna?&quot; He half-whispered, and faked scratching around his wrists a little. &quot;Do you have anything? I think the pool water is making me itch.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;In the bathroom, above the sink.&quot; She whispered back. &quot;There&#39;s some aloe.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks.&quot; Lurching to his feet, Jeff shambled off the bed in an uneven jog to the door, a little hunched over and thankful of the room&#39;s dim interior. Ignoring the stinging discomfort of the body part that was bouncing recklessly around his pants, Jeff exited her room and stumbled into the bathroom, closing and locking the door. With frantic haste, he spied the bottle of lotion, pulled down his pants, squirted a good dash onto his hand and wiped it all over his groin, from one thigh, around the breast, to the other.<br />
<br />
The harshened drying skin cooled instantly, and Jeff smeared it all over, making sure to cover every part that needed it. The aloe was a balm for his tortured underparts, bringing the added realisation that he was maybe more susceptible to skin irritation than he had been with male genitals. Absently, he considered if he still had them right now -- if he was a real &#39;boy&#39; with real &#39;boy parts&#39; -- whether his interactions with Brianna would have gotten him this close to her? Would she still have treated him the same, and shown the same kindness that made her such an awesome person?<br />
<br />
Brianna ...<br />
<br />
His mind dwelled on her as he rubbed the last of the cream into the squishy flesh, hardly paying attention to his ministrations. Thinking how much he wanted to kiss her, his hands encircled as much of the breast as he could and slowly squeezed, drawing upward, the still-slick surface sliding under his palms in a way that caused him to shiver. He wondered if she would taste like the fizzy cola they&#39;d been drinking. Reaching the tip, his fingers converged on the nipple and he gently tweaked it, the action sending a pinch of electric pleasure inside him, through between his hips.<br />
<br />
Like a burst of warmth, a glow of sensuality spread through the crotch-breast, the nipple hardening slightly. A tremour followed, and Jeff could feel the fresh milk building inside, brought on by his arousal. Blinking, he was broken out of his stupor as the base widened visibly -- just a little, but he definitely saw it. The teat pushed out more too, the mass expanding behind it, and he felt it grow a little heavier in his hand.<br />
<br />
Oh no! No, this couldn&#39;t be happening! He had done this almost on autopilot, without thinking! Jeff hurriedly took his hands off it, but he couldn&#39;t stop staring at the breast between his legs, a little fatter and rounder than it had been moments before. He had never wanted to touch it more badly than he did right then. His desire to milk himself was at an all-time high.<br />
<br />
If Jeff still had a penis, it would have been tented out in an impressive erection.<br />
<br />
This situation was dangerous! Jeff needed to escape, and as much as he liked being around Brianna, his attraction to her was causing him big problems. Maybe it would lead him into a dilemma he couldn&#39;t escape from and would definitely regret?</p>
