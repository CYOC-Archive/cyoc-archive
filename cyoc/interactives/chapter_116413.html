<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">&quot;Oh transformation sounds fun for me, so naturally I&#39;d like to change the live of others to our benefit.&quot; You said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can see how one like yourself can have fun with such magic. I will grant you this ability now, and you will get to know your limits quickly. You will need to seek out different runes too so I&#39;ll give you a few locations and you will go there to learn about the rune that lies there.&quot; Nitrosinous said<br />
<br />
&quot;Ooo that sounds nice, and something tells me that I can turn the world into something that we can both find great. Also what exactly can I do to others? I know what transformation is, but is there anything that I can do aspect wise that can be critically life changing to humans?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I&#39;ve seen so much in my day, you can change the species of any being, and alter them physically however you wish including gender, body modification, pregnancy is a big one, age, and alter your own body for a period of time, so feel free to be creative.&quot; Nitrosinous said<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh I have quite a few ideas in mind, so when do I get the powers?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, impatient now are we? Very well, please, do tell me about your creations.&quot; Nitrosinous said and you saw his hand glow with a red mist, and soon after your right hand did the same and you felt surges of power and knowledge over transformation magic fill your body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh wow, that&#39;s so much I have even more ideas now. I&#39;ll be sure to put my new abilities to good use, and have some mischievous fun in the meantime. Thank you Lord Nitrosinous, is there anything else that I should know?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Not for the moment, you can contact me at any body of liquid, just call to me, and be sure to inform me of progress. Farewell Drahafra, and journy north towards a town called Clawfold.&quot; Nitrosinous said<br />
<br />
&quot;Clawfold huh, okay then, Farewell to you to my lord.&quot; You said bowing your head and taking a knee.<br />
<br />
Nitrosinous disappeared from the pond and you stood up and stretched feeling like you were free even though you weren&#39;t technically. You didn&#39;t care much about your dignity at this point, besides you were covered in scales so you could say that you weren&#39;t exactly nude. You then realized that you didn&#39;t know which way north was, but on the bright side you could always ask around, and if you couldn&#39;t ask a human, you could always turn them demon.<br />
<br />
You then saw moss growing on a tree and remembered where moss would grow and began heading north. Along the way you found a path that seemed to be going in the direction that you needed to go so you followed it, and eventually you came across a knight. The knight stared at you, and you realized that walking down a dirt path in the middle of the day as a busty, naked dragoness wasn&#39;t the best idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey whatever you are, stop!&quot; The knight yelled<br />
<br />
You stopped and thought,&quot;Great, here comes my first potential victim.&quot; You turned around and crossed your arms over your breasts, and responded,&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; The knight walked up to you and looked at your naked body shocked. &quot;What are you?&quot; The knight asked and you thought that you should just be honest and transform him if he attacks you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?,&quot; you said shrugging, and revealing your breasts,&quot;I&#39;m a demon, or demoness it depends on who&#39;s asking, my name is Drahafra. Now I already know what you are, so who are you?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Harold, you do realize that you are basically setting yourself up for death by exposing yourself right?&quot; The knight, Harold asked<br />
<br />
&quot;By traveling along a public path, or just in general? Because technically I have scales and trying to wear clothes is just horid with my wings and my tail.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Just...why are you traveling like you are in general? I thought you demon types traveled by shadow.&quot; Harold asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...because I can really. I mean I have ways to protect myself, and on top of that traveling by shadow or whatever you call that isn&#39;t my thing. And uh between you and me, I haven&#39;t exactly been a demon for even a few days.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait what how?&quot; Harold asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well...I can&#39;t really tell you, but I can show you if you want. It&#39;s kind of a selective process, and honestly I won&#39;t do it unless you are sure you want for me to.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Okay then, show me.&quot; Harold said<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you really sure about this, it&#39;s kind of life changing.&quot; You said, and Harold nodded<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright then, just remember you wanted this.&quot; You said firing a red ball of light from your hand and into Harold. Harold then fell backwards, and his armor disintegrating from the blast, and making you wonder if Lord Nitrosinous mixed up transformation with destruction. You then retracted those thoughts as Harold&#39;s body began being covered in black fur. You smiled as this was the transformation that you wanted, and decided to take things a step further. You waved your hand, and Harold slowly grew 4 rows of breasts down the front of his body giving him 8 total.<br />
<br />
You didn&#39;t pay much attention to the rest of Harold&#39;s transformation, and just closed your eyes and hummed. You opened your eyes and you saw that Harold had become exactly what you wanted, and he, or now she was a female hell hound who was kind of sexy for a man. Harold&#39;s breasts ranged in size as they went down her body with her biggest breasts being D cups, and her smallest were BB cups. Seeing your breasts compared to Harolds you saw that yours were still superior in size, but not by too much so you figured your breasts were DD cups.<br />
<br />
Harold was shocked as she looked at her new body tail, and saw her new paw-hands. Harold especially took swift attention to her breasts, and vagina feeling both at the same time moaning softly. &quot;Having fun there new blood?&quot; You asked smiling <br />
<br />
Harold stopped and blushed, and looked at you and growled in a feminine voice,&quot;Y..you!&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, don&#39;t blame me you were the one who wanted me to show you how I became a demon, and now you are one too. Besides you turned out great, and you look nice in my opinion, well thanks to me. Besides you can help me out with changing this world.&quot; You said smiling <br />
<br />
&quot;Change the world how? Or what&#39;s more important CHANGE ME BACK!!&quot; Harold growled<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh um, I can&#39;t it&#39;s permanent unless you can get someone more powerful than me, and although I don&#39;t know much from what I do know is that the only being more powerful than me right now is Lord Nitrosinous. So basically you&#39;re my servant, or companion, and the reason I say servant is because I outrank you in Hell.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait, Nitrosinous, Lord Nitrosinous?! You work for him? He&#39;s literally the worst one of them all! Do you know what he even wants to do?&quot; Harold asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, he wants to conquer and extend his reign to the overworld, and it is my, or I guess our duty to do that.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;We!? Why me?&quot; Harold asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Because you are my servant, and just think for a minute. We are demons, and you said it yourself that I am asking for death if I&#39;m just traveling like I would normally, so why not change the world into one where we can?&quot; You said <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s what Hell is for!&quot; Harold growled<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, but if we demons do as much as set foot in the overworld we are targeted for death, by humanity. In addition to that some humans go to Hell and come back as demons, not that I died or anything. You see my point though right, and you don&#39;t have much of a choice either way.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
&quot;I see your point...I guess. But what do I do about all of this?&quot; Harold asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I have names for you, and thanks to Lord Nitrosinous himself, I have knowledge over transformation and basic demon knowledge. I know, I&#39;ll call you Jasako, sounds nice right?&quot; You said smiling <br />
<br />
&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant we...I&#39;m naked and you&#39;re naked and...&quot; Harold, now Jasako said<br />
<br />
&quot;Look honey dignity for demons is nonexistent the only time I think I would wear clothes is when pretending to be a human, dignity is nothing but a restraint for us. But don&#39;t worry you&#39;ll adjust, I&#39;m honestly still adjusting. The part about me being new wasn&#39;t a lie, and I actually was being completely honest with you. Hell, maybe I can get you promoted if you prove your worth, and we need to stick together anyways.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
Jasako paused and said,&quot;Fine I won&#39;t do anything that involves senseless violence though.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Well that&#39;s not much of a choice in most cases, but in ours I can say you won&#39;t need to kill unless you have to. C&#39;mon you are actually the first demon I know who has a personality besides I guess our Lord Nitrosinous, but I wouldn&#39;t want to try to get too casual with him because he kind of gave me a tiny fraction of his power, and because of that outclassing him is kind of impossible for me in that aspect. Also considering a small fraction of his power made me ascendant then his power outclasses every demon in Hell. Also according to Lord Nitrosinous I&#39;m the second strongest demon next to him, but don&#39;t let that get you worked up.&quot; You said putting your arm on Jasako&#39;s shoulder.<br />
<br />
&quot;We can relate, and don&#39;t worry about me getting mad. As long as it&#39;s just us then no worries, and as long as I put in a good word for you then you will have minimal probability of being abused by demons with more dominant features.&quot; You said<br />
 <br />
&quot;Look let&#39;s just get out of sight before we get ourselves killed, or before I get killed. I guess you don&#39;t have much to worry about, so I guess that it really is my fault.&quot; Jasako said<br />
<br />
&quot;Well it&#39;s for the best, because some humans may not be transformed into demons, and be enslaved. Lord Nitrosinous&#39;s orders not mine, now c&#39;mon I&#39;ll explain more on the way, and do you know of any like ponds, or lakes or some body of water around here?&quot; You asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s one back the way I came, why?&quot; Jasako asked<br />
<br />
&quot;Because I was told to check in with Lord Nitrosinous every now and then, and I want to inform him about you just so he can know wether you are good or not.&quot; You said<br />
<br />
Jasako gulped, and whined like a dog, and you sighed and said,&quot;You realized that if anyone will punish you than it&#39;s going to be me, or at least until our task is done and over with. I may ask for directions too, and often so there&#39;s that.&quot;</p>
