<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Dustin struggled all she could to resist the memory alterations. But it was hard, very hard. She was quickly losing herself. Until suddenly, her mom stopped all together and backed away quickly, a slight bit of panic appearing in her eyes.<br />
<br />
Jor&#333;gumo had only rewritten about half of Dustin&#39;s memories, and unfortunately, a lot of them were inconsistent. She had successfully made herself into Dustin&#39;s mom in Dustin&#39;s eyes, and had changed Dustin&#39;s memory about his gender and name. Now Dustin believes she has always been a female named Nora. Yet she remembers growing up as a human male durring her childhood. She &quot;knows&quot; that she hatched from an egg as an Arachne though. <br />
<br />
This is now just one of the multiple conflicting memories. Like how she remembers having a human mother, yet she can&#39;t stop recognizing Jor&#333;gumo as her mother. Even her name seems off, but hasn&#39;t she always been named Nora? <br />
<br />
While &quot;Nora&quot; was dealing with her conflicting memories, Jor&#333;gumo was calming down her sisters, who had stepped in to stop her just now. She admittedly had gone a bit too far for a punishment, as neither of her sisters had forcably started altering their respective victim&#39;s memories. Mainly because it negates the entire concept of this being a punishment if she just were to adopt her victim as a daughter and change all of their memories to match that narrative. <br />
<br />
Now, both Sutane and Yuki-Onna have slightly curved their victim&#39;s mind towards their new forms slightly, but nowhere even close enough to overwrite their entire concept of themselves. They just did enough to let them understand their new forms better, and how to live with their new abilities and to have a natural respect for their &quot;new mother&quot;. They specifically made themselves their &quot;new mother&quot;, similar to if they had adopted their victim. Not overwritten their victim&#39;s memories to make themselves their victim&#39;s actual mother.<br />
<br />
And as for their abilities, Sutane of course had to make sure her adopted child knew how to use fire so that she didn&#39;t mistakenly burn everything around her. Same for Yuki-Onna&#39;s adopted daughter and using the naturally generated cold around her to accidentally freeze things to death that she didn&#39;t wish to. And neither of them were sadists like Jor&#333;gumo either.<br />
<br />
Sutane&#39;s punishment actually had somewhat backfired and now she was kind of a doting mother towards her adoptive daughter after accidentally making her too unreasonably cute for herself to handle. Her new Kitsune adoptive daughter, while annoyed at her for doing this to him, also was starting to kind of enjoy his new self after Sutane began doting on him. <br />
<br />
Yuki-Onna was pretty emotionless as always, but wasn&#39;t cruel just for the sake of being cruel towards her victim. She had kept herself &quot;professional&quot; and did everything quick and painlessly. That being said, now that she had someone who could be with her for an extended period of time, had made her extremely happy internally, even if she rarely showed any sign of it externally. And her adoptive daughter, while reluctant at first to do anything, quickly took an interest in his new cold powers and began asking her tons of questions and also was the one who asked her for help before she even could offer it herself.<br />
<br />
So when they felt their sister using an extreme amount of power, they investigated and saw her rewriting her disfigured victim&#39;s core memories. They immediately stopped her with hostile threats as they had heard all of the screaming, but now were able to see exactly why there was so much screaming, and felt that she was already going way too far. There was even a huge pool of blood beneath Jor&#333;gumo&#39;s victim&#39;s body and her victim was coated in it too. So they intervened.<br />
<br />
What was done was done though, and it would be difficult to undo all of the memory rewrites, especially the core ones about things like her name and such. Those would be nearly if not outright impossible to correct now. And after a discussion, the three of them concluded that it would be best to at least smooth out the flow of Nora&#39;s memories with new transitioning memories; where she, for a time, was forced to live as a human male,  with a human life, but is now back to her real self and real mother. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but now Nora would at least not go completely insane. They 3 sister also agreed to raise Nora together just incase, as she is still somewhat unstable.</p>
