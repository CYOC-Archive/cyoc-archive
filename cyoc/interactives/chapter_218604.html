<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Doug watched in astonishment as Ryan confidently stripped off his shirt and shorts, revealing a sculpted, muscular physique that seemed to defy gravity. He couldn&#39;t help but feel a tinge of envy and admiration at Ryan&#39;s fitness.<br />
<br />
Unfazed by Doug&#39;s gaze, Ryan picked up the Sesame Street-patterned underwear with a mischievous grin. He walked behind the chair and slipped them on, the colorful characters contrasting with his chiseled frame in an oddly amusing way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doug, are you getting this on camera?&quot; Ryan called out, clearly enjoying the absurdity of the situation. &quot;This is pure gold! People won&#39;t believe it when I show them this video!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug, still taken aback by Ryan&#39;s transformation and his own mixed emotions, fumbled for his phone and began recording. &quot;Ryan, I don&#39;t think this is a good idea. We don&#39;t know what could happen. This ring and the underwear might be more than just a joke.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan laughed heartily, flexing his bulging biceps and toned abs for the camera. &quot;Come on, Doug, loosen up! It&#39;s all just a bit of fun. Besides, even if these were magical, do you really think I&#39;d pass up the opportunity to show off like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
As Doug continued to record, capturing Ryan&#39;s playful antics, an unexpected tingling sensation coursed through Ryan&#39;s body. He froze mid-flex, his face turning from amusement to confusion.<br />
<br />
&quot;Doug, do you feel that?&quot; Ryan asked, his voice filled with a mix of surprise and uncertainty.<br />
<br />
Doug stopped recording and took a step closer, concern etched on his face. &quot;What&#39;s happening, Ryan? Are you okay?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s muscles seemed to ripple, a faint glow emanating from beneath the Sesame Street-patterned underwear. He reached down to touch the ring on his finger, and as his hand made contact, a surge of energy shot through his entire body. The tingling sensation intensified, causing Ryan to wince in discomfort.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know, Doug,&quot; Ryan stammered, his voice strained. &quot;Something&#39;s definitely happening. I can feel it, but I don&#39;t know what.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the tingling sensation intensified, Ryan&#39;s body began its extraordinary journey through time. The first changes were subtle but noticeable. Ryan&#39;s athletic build became even more pronounced as he raced back into his twenties. The once well-defined muscles remained, but they became more youthful, exuding a vibrant energy.<br />
<br />
Ryan couldn&#39;t help but revel in his newfound youthfulness. With a cocky grin, he flexed his biceps, still bulging and defined despite the transformation. &quot;Looks like I&#39;m back in my prime, Doug! Check out these guns!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug&#39;s astonishment grew as he observed the changes unfolding before him. &quot;Ryan, this is incredible, but be careful. We don&#39;t know how far this transformation will go.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan scoffed, dismissing Doug&#39;s concerns. &quot;Relax, Doug. I&#39;ve got this under control. Just watch how amazing this transformation is going to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
But as Ryan continued to regress in age, the transformation took an unexpected turn. His teenage years beckoned, and his physique adjusted accordingly. He flexed with a newfound sense of cockiness, displaying his toned abs, chiseled pecs, and sculpted shoulders. Each movement seemed effortless, radiating an aura of youthful vigor.<br />
<br />
However, the descent into boyhood brought about a drastic shift. Ryan&#39;s muscles began to shrink, slowly losing their definition. His once prominent abs flattened, and his biceps and pecs diminished, leaving behind a more slender frame. The contours of his face softened, and his jawline curved, while stubble and chest hair faded away.<br />
<br />
Wide-eyed, Ryan stared at his transforming body in disbelief. &quot;Doug, what&#39;s happening to me? This wasn&#39;t how it was supposed to be!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug approached Ryan cautiously, his voice filled with concern. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Ryan. It seems like the ring&#39;s power is taking you further than anyone could have anticipated.&quot;<br />
<br />
As the transformation reached its conclusion, Ryan stood before Doug as a child, completely devoid of the muscles that had once defined him. He was no longer towering over Doug in height, and his deep voice had been replaced by a more youthful tone.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s voice quivered as he spoke, a mix of confusion and vulnerability evident. &quot;Doug, what have I become? This... this wasn&#39;t what I expected at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug&#39;s gaze softened, his heart filled with empathy for his friend. &quot;I&#39;m not sure, Ryan, but we&#39;ll figure this out together. We&#39;ll find a way to reverse the transformation and get you back to normal.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s eyes filled with despair as he gazed upon his transformed body, grappling with the reality of his diminished stature. &quot;Doug, I... I can&#39;t believe what&#39;s happened. My muscles, my strength... it&#39;s all gone.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s eyes welled up with tears as he stared at his diminished form. His once powerful muscles were now replaced by a small, childlike frame. The reality of his transformation began to sink in, and frustration mingled with sadness. &quot;Doug, why aren&#39;t you helping me? This is all your fault!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug&#39;s heart sank at Ryan&#39;s accusation. He had never intended for this outcome, and now his friend was spiraling into anger and despair. &quot;Ryan, I didn&#39;t know this would happen. I thought it was all a joke. We&#39;ll find a way to fix this, I promise.&quot;<br />
<br />
But as Ryan&#39;s resentment grew, Doug&#39;s curiosity surged once again. The desire to uncover the true potential of the ring and regain control of the situation compelled him to take a drastic step. He removed his suit, revealing a more aged physique beneath, and donned the classic pair of briefs from the box.<br />
<br />
With a mix of hope and trepidation, Doug yearned to reclaim some of his youth but wanted to remain older than Ryan, avoiding the extreme regression that his friend had experienced. As he waited for the transformation to begin, uncertainty gnawed at his core.<br />
<br />
Ryan, still filled with anger and confusion, turned his attention to Doug&#39;s actions. &quot;What are you doing, Doug? You think putting on those underwear will fix everything? It&#39;s too late for that!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ignoring Ryan&#39;s outburst, Doug focused on the potential of the ring, willing it to grant him a transformation that would strike a balance between youth and experience. Slowly, he felt a tingling sensation permeate his body as the journey back in time commenced.<br />
<br />
His flabby frame regained its strength, bulging with the muscles of a junior bodybuilder. His arms swelled with power, his pecs became massive, his abs ripped and defined. Toned calves, broad shoulders, and thick thighs completed the picture of a supremely fit physique. Wrinkles vanished as his hair darkened, and a youthful glow radiated from his rejuvenated skin.<br />
<br />
Doug flexed his newfound muscles, a confident grin spreading across his face. &quot;Looks like I&#39;m finally the bigger and stronger one, Ryan. The tables have turned.&quot; With a display of strength, he effortlessly hoisted Ryan up with one arm, a sign of his renewed power.<br />
<br />
Ryan&#39;s eyes widened, a mix of awe and frustration flickering within them. &quot;Doug... how did you...? This isn&#39;t fair!&quot;<br />
<br />
Doug&#39;s voice carried a note of triumph as he replied, &quot;Life isn&#39;t always fair, Ryan.</p>
