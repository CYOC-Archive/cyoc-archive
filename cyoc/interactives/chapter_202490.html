<div id="author-note"><b>Author note:</b><br/>While there&#39;s no violence -- there is some blood and injury in this chapter.</div><p id="chapter-text" class="serif">You pause in the labyrinth, inhaling deeply. You can smell all the mingled scents of the men who have gone before you -- the reek of fear, the hint of desire. At least some of them were turned on by your creation, you think with a smirk. Or maybe they <i>want</i> to be caught. You swish your tail eagerly.<br />
<br />
At the moment the scents are too confused to follow individually, so you just pick a path at random. The labyrinth is built of cold grey stone with no visible crack or seam, implying dwarven work. Illumination is provided by glowing crystals; they are set too far apart to be quite comfortable for humans, but you can see quite clearly in pitch black, so it doesn&#39;t bother you.<br />
<br />
In addition to scent, your demonic senses can feel the life-force of those around you, the emotions pulsing in their heart. Lust and fear, agreeing with your vulpine nose. Truly you are a wondrous beast, and you again think of your Master, your pussy clenching as you imagine how much you want to thank him for making you.<br />
<br />
But first things first. The humans&#39; trails have been splitting up, and you&#39;re pretty sure you&#39;re on the track of a single man now. And pretty close, too.<br />
<br />
Your foxy ears prick forward, catching the sound of sobbing. &quot;Hmmm...&quot; <i>That&#39;s not good.</i><br />
<br />
You glide forward, your wings half-folded, your magic keeping you suspended in the air. Turning a corner, you see your prey. It&#39;s a young man -- younger than you were, probably just come of age. He is sitting beneath one of the crystals, its pallid light making him look a sickly grey. His legs are drawn up, arms wrapped around him, head buried in his knees as he trembles.<br />
<br />
&quot;Aw...&quot; <i>Poor guy.</i> Strange sympathy stirs in you, as if you&#39;d been in a similar situation. Maybe you were? You can&#39;t remember what you were before Master made you into a succuvixen. Maybe in another life you were a weak human too.<br />
<br />
Regardless, you land, fold your wings, and walk towards him. This isn&#39;t the hunt you imagined -- you had pictured running the men down, ripping out their humanity in passionate sex. But... no. You can&#39;t approach this sobbing wretch like that. It wouldn&#39;t be right. You feel... motherly? You want to help him, to soothe away his pain and fear -- and you know the perfect way to do so.<br />
<br />
The clicking of your claws on the stone catches his attention, and he looks up. His eyes widen and you sense his heart speed up.<br />
<br />
&quot;No!&quot; He scoots back against the wall. &quot;Don&#39;t -- don&#39;t hurt me! Please!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, no,&quot; you assure him, your voice gentle. &quot;I&#39;m not here to hurt you. Don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; Your nose picks up a coppery smell. Blood? &quot;Are you injured, human?&quot;<br />
<br />
He watches you, not responding. Despite his fear, you see his eyes drift to your swaying tits. You smile, and put your hands on them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Beautiful, aren&#39;t they? Don&#39;t blush -- I don&#39;t mind you looking at them.&quot; You slide your hands beneath them, lifting them, then letting fall and jiggle. &quot;Would you like to touch them?&quot;<br />
<br />
He shakes his head, but keeps his eyes fixed on them. Now you are close enough to see past his drawn-up legs. There&#39;s a blood-stained bandage on his lower left abdomen. Your expression reverts to one of concern.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no, you <i>are</i> hurt! I&#39;m sorry...&quot; He finally looks back into your eyes. Can he tell that you&#39;re sincere? &quot;I know I may look a bit scary, but I promise. I just want to help you. Will you let me see?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I guess...?&quot; He starts to relax, then shakes his head. &quot;No, wait, that voice said you were going to turn me into a monster too! I --&quot; He tries to get to his feet, but winces and clutches his side, sliding back to the ground. Your frown deepens as the tang of fresh blood reaches you.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that now. Your wound has reopened. You have to let me help you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Help... me...?&quot; He looks up at you, pain-misted eyes following you as you sit beside him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes... dearheart...&quot; The word comes to you from an unremembered past; a term of affection appropriate for the tenderness you feel for this wounded young man. You wrap an arm around his shoulders, lifting him away from the wall, and closer to you, then you put your wing around him as well, cradling him in your scent. Comforting, arousing, fogging his mind. &quot;I&#39;m going to make you better.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But... you&#39;re a demon...&quot; He looks at your wing, then at your horns. Your glowing eyes. He stops there, enthralled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhh. Don&#39;t think about that. I&#39;m not going to hurt you. Come here.&quot; You carefully shift him to lay down across your lap, your eyes on his, your hand lightly stroking across his taut skin, feeling him slip under your spell. You take his right hand, and bring it up to your right breast, encouraging him to stroke it. &quot;Doesn&#39;t that feel nice?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes...&quot; he admits, blushing. You see his cock twitch. <i>Good.</i> No need to expend your venom -- you do have a limited supply, especially since you&#39;re not a full succubus. Cradling him with your right arm, you lift him up, so that his lips are in reach of your nipple. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Ah... what are you... doing...&quot; You suppress a moan as you feel his breath cool against your tit. He&#39;s struggling, but feebly, his eyes now fixating again on the perfect, round red globe now so close to his face.<br />
<br />
&quot;Drink,&quot; you say, soft but firm. &quot;My milk will heal you.&quot; You shift his other hand from his bandage to help him steady your heavy breast, and begin applying pressure to the wound yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh! But...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;<i>Drink.</i>&quot; You press his head to your tit, and feel his lips obediently part and begin taking in your milk. You moan in unison, the pleasure of the suckling radiating into you, the tainted fluid spreading your corruption into him. &quot;Feel the pain go... feel only pleasure instead...&quot;<br />
<br />
He relaxes, your words and your milk flowing into him. A lavender tint overtakes his stomach. You feel the bandages loosen as his waist narrows, and you pull them away. As you knew it would, the wound has closed, the transformation healing him. The angry red gash begins to disappear, erased by the creeping advance of delicate, pale purple, and you run your hands over the smoothing skin, flaking off the dried blood.<br />
<br />
&quot;What happened to you, dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ambushed... by orcs...&quot; he murmurs, pulling off your nipple to answer, licking a dribble of milk from his fuller lips. He blinks several times, his eyes turning a vibrant purple. &quot;Working on dad&#39;s farm.&quot;<br />
<br />
You nod. Faintly you can remember working in fields too, mowing hay, following a plow. &quot;That&#39;s awful.&quot; You press him back to your nipple, and he resumes suckling. &quot;But you&#39;re safe now. Soon everything will be better...&quot;<br />
<br />
You feel his belly becoming flat, while his hip swells out nicely into your caressing hand. Stroking in to his groin, you feel his coarse pubic hair retracting before you slip your hand down to cradle his balls. He groans and squirms a bit, making you gasp softly as his sucks hard on your nipple. You bend down to kiss him, your fingers going back up his side. The redness has completely vanished beneath the beautiful lavender.<br />
<br />
&quot;You&#39;re going to be such a good girl,&quot; you whisper as you pull away. His ear twitches slightly as a tuft of dark purple fur grows out of it. The lavender spreads across his face, softening it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm?&quot;<br />
<br />
To distract him, you fondle his balls again. <I>Mmm, so nice and full.</i> Yes, it&#39;s time for you to feed and consummate the boy&#39;s corruption into another sex pet. You run the merest tip of your claw over his cock, helping it stiffen up.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh...&quot; He pulls away, shuddering in pleasure. &quot;Stop... You&#39;re much... much nicer than I eh-ah!-expected, but...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But doesn&#39;t it feel good?&quot; You run a hand up his now tight belly and squeeze one of his fattening nipples, then stroke back down to his crotch.<br />
<br />
&quot;...Yes...&quot; His eyes fall. Then he sighs onto your nipple, making it throb with desire.  &quot;But... I don&#39;t even know your name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarlet Night,&quot; you reply. To set him at ease you ask, &quot;And yours, dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ronnie... I-I mean, Ron!&quot;<br />
<br />
You laugh and pat his hair. &quot;I think &#39;Ronnie&#39; is a cute name.&quot; <I>Though Master will probably think of an even cuter one for you.</i> &quot;But I will call you Ron if you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah... Ronnie is a little boy&#39;s name...&quot;<br />
<br />
You squeeze his balls. &quot;And you are certainly not a little boy.&quot;<br />
<br />
He looks away again, purple blush coming into his cheeks. &quot;Well... You know, S-Scarlet... I&#39;ve never been with a woman before...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh?&quot; You giggle a bit. Strangely, you don&#39;t think you&#39;ve ever been with a man. But you know instinctively what to do. &quot;Well, let me be your first.&quot; You give his cock a little squeeze, and are rewarded by feeling it jump in your hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! ...All right...&quot;<br />
<br />
You lay him down on the floor, and move to straddle him. His torso is now entirely lavender, and his boyish chest has lost its dusting of hair in favour of two small, but growing, breasts. His arms have slimmed down, the hair on the forearms thickening into a royal purple pelt. He lifts them, weakly clutching at your hips, and you felt his sharpening nails dimple your red flesh.<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh?&quot; He lifts his head, trying to look at himself. &quot;Is something...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Shhhh...&quot; You bend down while reaching between your legs. &quot;Calm your fears...&quot; Your lips meet his, and again he relaxes, letting your tongue touch his, letting you feel his fangs coming in. You line him up, and slide down, your vagina squeezing over him as you take him in, until your lips press into his now hairless groin. You hear him moan; hear pain mix into the pleasure before he breaks the kiss.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mmm my... my eyes...&quot;<br />
<br />
You nimbly catch his hands as he tries to reach up and rub at his eyes, which now have black sclera and slit pupils. &quot;They&#39;re fine, dearheart.&quot; You put his hands on your breasts, then wipe away a tear from his face with your finger. &quot;Dry your tears. Forget your pain. Lose it... in the pleasure...&quot;<br />
<br />
You lift yourself, savouring the feel of his cock reluctantly slip from your sucking tunnel, almost popping free before you lower yourself back down, feeling the thick, hot length press into you. Inch by delicious inch.<br />
<br />
Soon it will be gone, making room for your Master&#39;s cock to fuck you both.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yesss... lose yourself in me...&quot;<br />
<br />
You go slow for a few minutes, but you are very hungry, and soon work up to a faster rhythm. As your juices leak down over him, he changes further, taking on a distinctly girly appearance. Two little horns, purplish-black, emerge from his hairline; his messy black hair grows out into shining lilac locks. But his eyes are locked on yours, the fear from earlier replaced by a sort of mesmerised wonder, his velvety furred and padded hands methodically kneading your boobs, squirting out the occasional spurt of milk, that sinks into his own chest, each little dose adding fullness to his breasts.<br />
<br />
Then you feel it. His balls draw up, his cock expands. &quot;Yes, dear! Give into it! Cum for me!&quot;<br />
<br />
His voice breaks as he cries in release, the hot seed shooting up into you, filling your hungry womb. With it comes his masculinity, your succubus nature taking it in and converting it to more power. Your own orgasm comes, driving your inner muscles to milk him harder, drawing it all into you -- every drop of cum, of maleness, of humanity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah -- ah -- uh -- whaaa --&quot; A hint of panic comes back into his eyes as his balls pass back up into his body. You feel him tense, back arching against the floor as his cock shrinks out of your cunt, sealing her fate.<br />
<br />
You lay over her again, nipple to nipple, clit to clit, and wrap your arms around her. &quot;Just let go, Ronnie,&quot; you whisper. &quot;Embrace the heat.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hea-heat...&quot; You can feel it burning through her, searing away the last traces of her humanity. Her eyes glaze. &quot;So ho- haaaaaahhh...!&quot;<br />
<br />
Holding her to you, you push off the floor to levitate. As the tension releases, you muffle her scream of ecstasy with another kiss. Her wings and tail burst from her back; dark purple membranes stretched between lavender fingers, and fluffy royal purple tipped with lilac. Her feet finish shifting into paws, the royal purple fur booting her to her knees.<br />
<br />
Her bust rapidly expands to match yours as they squish together; her hips, ass and thighs likewise finish their growth into smooth, curvy expanses of irresistible, flawless flesh. She throws herself into the kiss, still screaming and moaning as her first female orgasm sweeps through her; legs and arms, wings and tail all wrapping around you.<br />
<br />
Panting she finally pulls away. &quot;What... what was that? What... did you...?&quot; She looks down, sees her own mountainous boobs pressing against yours. &quot;Oh no! You...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I made you better.&quot; You stroke a hand through her hair. &quot;Now you&#39;re a strong, sexy beast demon like me. Isn&#39;t that better than a scared, hurt little human?&quot; You grind against her to emphasise your point.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... maybe...&quot;<br />
<br />
You give her a quick kiss. &quot;You&#39;ll love it, I promise. And just wait until you see Master. His cock is so thick; so tasty.&quot;<br />
<br />
Her eyes widen in shock, but she licks her lips. &quot;T-tasty...? A-a cock?&quot; You feel the heat in her increase. &quot;B-but...&quot; She seems to notice your collar for the first time. &quot;A master...? B-but I wanted to... to go home...!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This <i>is</i> your home now, dearheart. And who knows? Maybe Master will let you go back, and turn your family into hot demon bitches for him as well. Wouldn&#39;t you like that?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I... I...&quot; She sighs, overwhelmed. Slumping against you in midair. &quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
You float back down, and set her against the wall where you first found her. You give her one last kiss, and stand back up. &quot;Rest well, little Ronnie. I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
However, you notice her start to fade. Soon she&#39;s gone, and you assume Master has taken her to her new quarters. That&#39;s good; you would rather keep the hunt all to yourself.<br />
<br />
You stretch, chuckling. The hunt! This first encounter didn&#39;t go anything like how you&#39;d expected it too, but... you enjoyed it, nonetheless. It felt good to help that poor boy become the beautiful bitch Master wanted him to be. First one down.<br />
<br />
Still... you kind of hope your next quarry will be a bit more exciting. You levitate back into the hunt, bending forward eagerly as you glide down the halls.</p>
