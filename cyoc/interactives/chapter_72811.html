<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Shawn Mayer was walking with his girlfriend Melissa when the laughter from the tent caught their attention.<br />
<br />
&quot;It must be an awesome show, let's go.&quot; said Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's probably in the middle of the show, I don't want to pay for half-show.&quot; protested the muscular jock.<br />
<br />
&quot;But it says entrance free. Half show or not, it's free.&quot; said Melissa almost dragging the hunk of her <br />
reluctant boyfriend.<br />
<br />
They entered just late enough to miss the Old Man taking the former law student away, and only saw Madame <br />
Illusia on stage as the crowd finally started to calm down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Were they laughing of the old lady?&quot; wondered the cute Melissa.<br />
<br />
&quot;I have seen this act before, the old crone comedian, the whole is based on how old and ugly she is, heh, this <br />
might be funny after all.&quot; said the smug teen.<br />
<br />
Of course, the new audience wasn't lost on Madame who said. &quot;It appears we have another item for today's <br />
auction, SHAWN MAYER come to stage.&quot; commanded while pointing at the couple.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shawn, you sly, you wanted to give me a surprise. You stage the whole thing?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What, no, I don't know...&quot; just then he realized that despite negating the whole thing he was walking toward <br />
the stage. &quot;What's happening?!&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally walking on stage Madame began questioning him. &quot;Shawn, state who you are, how old you are, and who is <br />
the adorable creature who walked in with you.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shawn wanted to get off, but instead he felt compelled to answer. &quot;I'm Shawn Mayer, quarterback and captain of <br />
the local school team, I'm seventeen years old, and she is my girlfriend, Melissa.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes you are Shawn, you also feel like you are a gift from the heavens to the world to everyone around you, <br />
don't you. No wonder, in these days letting a kid have all that praise just because of how well one can throw <br />
a football is scandalous, it doesn't help the fact that your parents are loaded does it. Well Mr. Mayer, if <br />
you really feel like a gift to the world, offer yourself to the world. Your every possession is going to be <br />
auctioned now!&quot; declared Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;What the fuck is this old bitch talking about?!&quot; yelled in anger the jock, of course everything she said was <br />
truth.<br />
<br />
&quot;Such a temper, let's see where to begin?&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;I offer $5 for that sport jacket, is suddenly chilly here.&quot; said a man near the front row.<br />
<br />
&quot;$5?! It cost me like $90, and is not for sale!&quot; yelled the jock back.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everything is on sale, go on give your jacket to the young man.&quot; said Madame, and Shawn feel forced to <br />
discard his precious jacket in favor of the man who bought it.<br />
<br />
However, upon handing his jacket the man added. &quot;You know what, I want those bitchin shoes too, and the socks, <br />
you are going to ruin them on this floor without shoes anyway, I'll throw another five.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SOLD!&quot; declared Madame, Shawn hadn't time to protest even. He just took his shoes and socks off, and handed <br />
them over, when he did he saw Melissa, looking dumbfounded of his behaviour and saw a man approach her and <br />
speak with her, before returning to the stage barefoot, the dirt floor soiling his feet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what shall this young man sell?&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;T-shirt and Jeans for 10 bucks!&quot; yelled a familiar voice, and indeed it was Melissa holding a ten happily on <br />
hand.<br />
<br />
Shawn didn't need to be compelled, he ran of his own accord to meet his girlfriend. &quot;Melissa, what are you <br />
doing?!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't have to hide it. Stephen here explained me you organized this for charity, you are so sweet. <br />
Stripping for charity.&quot; she handed over the ten as Shawn was compelled to strip down to his boxers in front of <br />
the whole crowd, revealing his well toned six pack, hairy chest and impeccable tanned skin. He returned to the <br />
center in just his skivvies hoping that now that he was just in that they left him off.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure Shawn here is hoping that we are done, but far from it. This buff young man has a lot to offer to, <br />
unlike our previous item, he is not that smart or determinated to begin with but he still has a lot to offer.<br />
<br />
A young kinda nerdy guy held his hand up. &quot;Yes young man?&quot; asked Madame. &quot;Madame, if it's possible I'll offer <br />
$50 for his testosterone and flawless dermis, please.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? How's he even?&quot; thought Shawn before Madame declared it sold. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sold. His Manliness and Skin to this Shawn began to feel tingly all over, he saw the hair of his chest and <br />
arms became lighter, until it disappeared, next his overall tan began to fade and become uneven, till he was <br />
sporting a t-shirt worth of pale skin, he fell his face, felling a few pimples on his otherwise flawless face, <br />
and the freckles that appeared, but he couldn't feel those of course. In lieu of the most drastic effects he <br />
didn't notice that his muscles lost some definition, he was over fit still. On the other hand the nerdy teen <br />
who bought his manliness and skin, stood, unbuttoning his shirt letting his new crop of chest hair breathe for <br />
the first time, no trace of his pale complexion. The boy turned from merely nice to good looking in no time.<br />
<br />
By now Melissa saw that something was definitely off, about this show, and Shawn saw her realization. &quot;Baby, <br />
quickly I have a couple hundred in my wallet, buy me back, PLEASE!&quot; pleaded Shawn, understanding the situation <br />
Melissa began to peruse his clothes in search for the wallet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, the girlfriend...&quot; said Madame. &quot;What a cute girl, I believe you can do better, in fact I know you can, <br />
but you are so attach to him, so who's going to buy his relationship with her?&quot; said Madame.<br />
<br />
&quot;What?!&quot; yelled the couple in protest, but the offers began to arise. Enough to stun Melissa into stopping <br />
looking for the money. Until...<br />
<br />
&quot;$500, and a promise that I'll be the most considerate and loving boyfriend you ever had.&quot; said the young man <br />
who bought Shawn's manliness.<br />
<br />
&quot;Sold!&quot; said Madame, suddenly something changed in Melissa just as she retrieved the wallet, she walked toward <br />
the man. &quot;Hi honey, do you like what I bought for you?&quot; said she as she kissed the young man.<br />
<br />
Shawn's eyes filled with tears, she was his only hope. He was so immerse that didn't see the man walking into <br />
the stage and handing a five to pantsed the former jock and buy his boxers off. The tent exploded in an uproar <br />
of laughter as it came to view that inside the boxers a baby dick was hiding. &quot;What? what happened to my 6 <br />
incher?&quot; and then he remember who had stole it, and who would probably would use it to bang his girlfriend <br />
from then on.<br />
<br />
He tried to cover, but Madame said. &quot;Don't cover, you are just like a child, no need for modesty, not for that <br />
tiny thing.&quot; the crowd just erupted in an encore of laughter. Retrieving some composure, the man who had <br />
bought Timothy intelligence for his son said: &quot;The young boy there, is so small he doesn't deserve those well <br />
tone muscles, I want to buy them for my son too.&quot; Shawn deflated turning into a scrawny mock of what he used <br />
to be.<br />
<br />
&quot;He is still crying&quot; yelled someone from the crowd.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not so big man anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No he doesn't deserve to be a man.&quot; yelled a trio of young teenagers. &quot;If he wants to be a child let it, we <br />
each want to buy three of his years, we are going to go partying tonight!&quot;<br />
<br />
Shawn felt his tears flow more freely and everything around him grow bigger, but really he was the one growing <br />
smaller, the pimples fade away, but now his whole body matched his dick. Now he was angered and confused, and <br />
began bawling like the eight year old he was.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now what to do with him?&quot; asked Madame, but a large woman from the multitude spoke up. &quot;If it's the same to <br />
you I'll want to buy the boy to be my son, I'll even buy off two more of his years. So social service gives me <br />
a check for my &quot;new&quot; son.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;SOLD!&quot; declared Madame, as Shawn Mayer, grew littler ever till he was a five year old. The large woman came <br />
and grab the naked child taking him away. &quot;I hope your new brothers aren't to hard on you, but who am I <br />
kidding? A scrawny kid like you will be bullied by them.&quot; said the woman, his new mother as he took him away <br />
from his life. He had a girlfriend, awesome parents and a pending football scholarship. Now he will be lucky <br />
if social services caught up with his situation before long.</p>
