<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Most 14 year old teenage boys would be outside enjoying the beach or swimming at the pool during the summer, but being a late bloomer, having the voice of a 10 year old boy, little to no development caused by puberty, and enjoying math and physics, you find yourself content at the optional summer school program.  Mrs. Wright, and others at the school think you are the next genius of your times, but haven't told you. Mrs. Wright had just asked you (William), about the theory of Quantum Physics and  if time travel could be obtained, or aging manipulated through the use of harnessing this power.<br />
You hear a loud humming and then a person in a black latex body suit wearing a black gas mask enters the room.<br />
&quot;Don't move you two!&quot;, said the kid,&quot; you two are going to wake up sorry.&quot;<br />
The kid pointed a strange device at you and Mrs. Wright then clicked a few buttons. You suddenly feel weak and paralyzed. Some strange beam has you and Mrs. Wright stunned. The kid's voice sounds familiar, but in the current panicked state you can't seem to remember who it is. To William's horror, he pulls out a second ray gun that is attached to his backpack via a large hose. He proceeds to flip a switch, pulls the trigger and causes an extremely bright purple beam to pull from Mrs. Wright and collect into the backpack. The beam only last for a few moments as Mrs. Wright shrieks in pain, shooting out the beam from her eyeballs, nostrils, and mouth. She seems to look visibly older, collapses and dies.<br />
 William does everything he can do to get away, but is still paralyzed by the first beam.<br />
&quot;You don't know who I really am, but lets just say that Mrs. Wright was getting too close to discovering my theories on Aging and Quantum Physics. You see, if one can generate an energy strong enough to harness time, they can theoretically time travel, or in my case, live forever. Unfortunately, the only way to harness this energy is to steal it from other living people, and when you get to a certain age, the process has a side effect of overloading their organs and boom, they die. I've been bouncing from school to school all over the world for the past 125 years, in order to find &quot;subjects&quot; that will keep me at my youthful age. Without a treatment every 6 months, I'll begin to age rapidly and will most likely die.&quot;, says the mysterious masked boy.<br />
The masked boy takes off his mask and shows himself to William.  William is stunned, its the new kid named Roy that transfered to his school 3 weeks ago. He quickly became best friends with William when he needed tutoring and came to Williams math tutoring in the library. William had few friends and didn't mind it one bit, although now he realized that he was trying to isolate and use his body as some freakish energy source.<br />
&quot;So you are killing people in order to stay alive and only became my friend con me out of my energy?&quot;, said William. <br />
Roy grins sinisterly as he said, &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot;, and you should know it well. But don't worry William, I am going to give you what you've most wanted for the past few years. You see, I've watched in wonder and glee as you've complained about your youth, the one thing  you can only get once and passes too quickly. You've worried about how slow your body has developed and have wished that you could be older and no longer a boy, but a man. Today I'm going to grant you that wish, and because I'm your best friend, I'm going to allow you to see it for yourself. And don't worry about dieing, fortunately for you, your body is young enough to withstand this process.<br />
Roy goes over to William and strips him of all of his clothes. leaving William humiliated because he can't do anything to stop Roy from violating his rights.<br />
<br />
Roy proceeds to charge up his backpack ray beam by flicking the switch on the side of it. As Roy pulls the trigger, William can see the same bright purple beam being sucked out of his body. <br />
The feeling is a cozy warm feeling that instantly calms William. He instantly forgets about the implication of whats happening, and is content just to be there and see the pretty purple beam. Quickly strange things start to happen to William. He is quickly aging by the days every second and starts to notice differences in his body. He notices that his balls finally drop and the extra mass located on his penis. The pubic area finally begins to grow erratic stubbly black hairs, as well as his arm pits. Roy turns up the power and causes Willaim to age 1 week every second now. William notices that his body is growing, as he is now 16 years old. His face is starting to have signs of a beard, and his jaw line is much more pronounced. He says Wow, and realizes his voice has finally dropped and is much more masculine. 5 more minutes pass and William is now just over 21 years old. His dreams have finally come true, his body has developed lean muscle mass, he has hair in all the right places, and has a respectable size penis at over 6 inches long. He marvels at his body and how tone and strong it is.<br />
William pleads for Roy to stop, but Roy ignores his pleads and continues with the beam.<br />
Ten more minutes pass, and William starts to notice new changes in his body. His hairline has begun to shrink back, and while he is still incredibly intelligent, he seems a tad duller than he was when he was 20. His sexual desire, while still raging, isn't as strong as it had been when he was 16 years old. <br />
William pleads again, saying, &quot;I'll do anything, please stop this process. I've said I wanted to be older , but I meant I wanted puberty to hurry up because all the other guys had already begun to develop and I hadn't even begun. I don't want to lose my youth.&quot;<br />
Unfortunately, Roy snickers while stating, &quot;Sometimes it sucks when you get what you wish for, and the process cannot be stopped once it has begun or it ruins all the life energy that has been harvested.&quot;<br />
Ten more minutes pass, and now William is over the hill at age 40. He notices that his hair line has begun to recede, but now much further back. Many of his hairs on his body have begun to loose their original black color and have begun to turn gray, giving him a salt and pepper look. Some frown lines  have begun to form on the forehead, and small crows feet wrinkles under the eyes. His nose has widened and ears slightly enlarged from when he was 20 years old. He starts to notice some of his lean muscle tissue being replaced with softer fat tissue.  <br />
The clock continues to tick, and another ten minutes pass. William is now over 50 years old. Major changes have begun to take place, inside and outside his body.  More than 50 percent of his body hair is now gray, and his hair line has receded all the way back to the base of his head and slightly above the ears. The wrinkles in the face have accelerated because there his body is creating collagen and his body is burning the extra fat stores in his face, making his eye's appear to sink in.  William is fascinated to see his body is growing hair in more places, albeit gray hairs, such as longer nose, eyebrow, and ear hairs.  Seeing his pubic area causes him to become aroused, but he can no longer obtain a strong erection.  <br />
While William continues to complain, 20 more minutes pass by.  Now he is over the age of 70 and is a fully developed Elderly Man. He is now fully grey (white) haired, and about 3 inches shorter. William has lost more than 1/4 of the muscle mass since he was 20, and it has been replaced by either fat or other tissue, causing him to lose weight. His energy levels are very low,and while he is angry, he is considering taking a nap instead of arguing. His face has completely aged, with the accompanying wrinkles, age spots, and other symptoms of being 70+.  <br />
The machine comes to a stop, as it only requires 60 years of life energy to fully charge the device. Roy, fiddling with the device to ensure it received a full charge, says &quot;Roy., I told you that today you would have all your wishes come true.. too bad it all happened in a matter of minutes instead of years! You now have a low, manly voice, hair all over your body (at least in most places except the top of your head). You've developed a set, and even have a nice Gray mane around it.  Don't feel too bad about being a 70 year old virgin with equipment that doesn't work so well anymore, Viagra can fix that and Medicare even covers it!  You'll be happy to know that your 60 years of life will sustain me at my current age for another 180 days.<br />
William, being naked, old, and in shock, passes out while Roy leaves a sarcastic Thank You Card behind. While Roy is pulling the pen out of his pocket, his flash drive falls out that has the schematic to make another life harnessing ray gun.</p>
