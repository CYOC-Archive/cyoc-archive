<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">James had been in the house for barely thirty seconds before hearing his son calling for him to come upstairs. The patriarch of the house let out a bit of a sigh, he hadn’t even been able to take off his shoes yet and Jeff was demanding his presence over something. He noticed that his son had started to get a bit needy recently, but couldn’t the boy come downstairs to show him whatever this was. After all, he had youth on his side and didn’t just finish up an eight hour day at the office. However begrudgingly, James kicked off his shoes and began his walk up the stairs to his son’s room. Soon after the first step, a chill shook him to his core. He brushed it off as a weird chill, but was struck by how violent the shakes he’d given were. Still, he made his way up the stairs, but a strange feeling began to root itself in his mind.<br />
<br />
About mid way up the staircase, his socks started to feel tight around his feet. Uncomfortable, at first, and then they started to just feel wrong somehow. “I should take these off,” he thought to himself, as his big toe moved down along the side of his foot under the fabric. “I need to take these off,” he thought as he bent over to pull one off right there on the stairs, not even grabbing the railing, showcasing a surprising and rapidly improving balance. He removed one sock, and as he switched feet to stand on his pants and underwear fell off of his rapidly shrinking hips around his ankles. Strangely, the underwear seemed to split in two on the way down his legs, leaving a band of fabric around each ankle.<br />
<br />
The changing primate dimly looked down at his legs, and watched as they became thinner, but wound with sinewy muscle. He was transfixed by the rapidly growing hair, becoming a dark brown pelt across his legs and crawling up his body. He briefly considered his nudity on the stairs, but couldn’t bring himself to care. The brief change in focus caused his simplifying mind to short circuit, leaving him slack jawed and drooling, half naked and dimwitted. He stood dazed, barely able to acknowledge the various changes happening to his body. His jaw pushed out from his face, and his ears grew larger and stuck out from his head more. His nose shrank, being absorbed into his projecting maw leaving just wide nostrils. His brow jutted forward, and his eyes shrunk, becoming beady. His legs shortened, shrinking his whole body from his original 6’2” down to a little under 5’ if standing straight up, but his spine hunched a bit by his shoulders, making him look even shorter.  His chest lost a good amount of width, as his arms grew tight muscle that was thinner around his shoulders, but lengthened until they almost touched the ground. Hair continued to cover his back and neck and arms and crotch, and his spine grew out into a prehensile tail about as long as half his old height. He felt like his body was filling with energy, as if he was getting younger and more virile.  His cock slightly lengthened to about 7”, his package inflated to the size of a pair of tennis balls and were about as hairy. His asshole grew wider, becoming always hungry and ready for something to plow it. His ass cheeks grew, becoming a true hairy, fuzzy bubble butt. Each change simultaneously confusing the poor simpleton and feeling completely natural, as the “rightness” of his new form solidified itself in his mind.<br />
<br />
Most of his clothing began to change too. His undershirt and light blue dress shirt turned into a beautiful white waistcoat with a perfectly white dress shirt tailored perfectly to his new lanky form, with wide cuffs at his wrists. At the same time, the fabric around his ankles changed into a matching pair of ankle cuffs. The plain gray suit jacket turned into a stunningly perfect black suit jacket, with coat tails that split just above his tail and exposed ass crack, and ending just above his knees. Excess fabric wrapped around his long fingered and dexterous hands, forming immaculate white gloves, and his neck tie reshaped into a white bow tie. He would have looked quite dapper, if he wasn’t now a half-naked, hunched over and drooling monkey boy. <br />
<br />
Suddenly, a feeling shot through him, and he refocused on how constricted his feet were in their increasingly befuddling prisons. He shook himself into a new awareness, and went back to work on his getting his foot freed. He tried to pull the second sock by the tip and immediately started having trouble, having already forgotten in his confusion how he had gotten the first sock off. He stood on the stair, hopping in place on one leg with his constrained foot practically in his face. He was constantly stepping on his pants, and eventually kicked them down the stairs, hooting in frustration. He stretched and pulled on the sock, ooking and whining, making little progress until his shifting and changing foot became more dexterous and hand-like, and started pushing the sock off of itself from the inside. <br />
<br />
As he pulled off the the offending prison, he took a close look at his changed feet. Flexible and hand-like, they struck him as completely beautiful, and yet absolutely normal. He brought them close to his face, inhaling their scent deeply. He ooked in pleasure, as the slight smell and sweat of them already rendered him overwhelmingly horny. His flexible body performing marvelously, he moved his foot to his lips and started licking at the toes, as his cock grew hard and started dribbling precum. Suddenly, a jolt struck through him. He needed to do something. Moving with a now unusual intelligence, he gathered the two socks, put one inside the other, and stuck them over his cock. It was very important that he keep things clean.<br />
<br />
After that brief bit of focused movement, he went back to work on his foot, lick and sucking at his toes, working his tongue to get as much as possible on it. With his free hand, he grabbed at his sock covered dick and started stroking, feeling the outside sock moving more than the inside one, feeling his cock stiffen to full hardness and growing hornier by the second. His tail swung around as he worked his foot and his meat, and a slight brush with his hands sent shivers down the poor monkey mid masturbation. His tail was almost as sensitive as his cock, and he unconsciously moved it right next to his sock covered merrymaker, grabbing both with the same hand, stroking furiously. He felt the inner sock become tighter around his cock and balls, making his erection feel even better and better.<br />
<br />
The next few minutes were a mess of action. Humping and licking and thrusting and sucking and hooting and stroking and ooking and bucking and hollering, louder and harder and deeper and he needed something in his ass, but he had no free hands because he needed to keep sucking and humping and fucking. Soon, it was his tail to the rescue, as it freed itself from his vice grip and worked its way under his ass, inserting itself into his own slutty, hungry hole. Feeling his sensitive tail surrounded by his anal walls drove him to even more furious motions as he fucked himself silly on the stairs, ooking and ahhing all the while. But once that tail snaked its way to his prostate, he had an epiphany. This is what he was meant to be: a stupid, dirty, depraved slut. He needed to be used and abused. Needed to fuck and be fucked and be a dumb fucking slut, only good for being fucked and licking and sucking and being such a dumb fucking monkey slut boy. He bucked his hips, trying to get more of his tail in his ass. He sucked and huffed on his feet, alternating them so that he always had a grip on the stairs. He pumped his cock with an inhuman fervor, thrusting harder and wilder. His mind exploded, and so did his cock, expelling the only remaining humanity in him into a dirty sock, leaving only a dumb monkey boy in the afterglow.<br />
<br />
He laid there for a bit, before a thought rushed through his head. He needed to clean. Still panting with exhaustion, he carefully pulled the outer sock off his dick, he found it filled with the result of his jerk off session, and saw what had become of the inner sock. He was now wearing a white fabric cock and ball ring, and saw that the white fabric also completely covered the shaft of his dick. He contemplated the sight, focusing on it as a realization came to him. It was… part of his uniform? The work struck him as odd, until it didn’t. Why of course it was part of the uniform! It looked quite stunning and Master has excellent taste. As his mind was refilled with information, some of it old but a lot of it new, he found himself smiling about his Master’s excellent taste. But soon a smell struck him as he realized what he was holding in his paw, and ooked in dismay. <br />
<br />
My goodness, what have I done? Butch was distraught, did he really just have another one of his episodes? He felt saddened when he realized what he had done. It had been entire days since he last lost control of himself and to do it on the middle of the staircase was just completely embarrassing and shameful for him. He dreamed of having complete control over his impulses someday so that he could best perform his duties without anything interrupting his wonderful service to Master… Master, who? He thought for a moment scratching his head.<br />
<br />
Why, Master Jeffery of course! Butch the monkey butler nodded his head in solemn reverence to the amazing, wonderful, extraordinary Master Jeffery. He… Vaguely recalled being Jeff’s father, but that seemed so insignificant compared to the wondrous glory and honor of being Master Jeffery’s monkey butler! He might have had a different name once, but he didn’t know it and didn’t care, because Master Jeffery picked his current name making it much better than whatever stupid name he had before. In return for such a proud distinction, Butch dedicated his life to serving Master Jeffery’s every whim and need. Cooking, Cleaning, doing his homework for him, driving him places and much more, each an honor and privilege to serve and obey his Master’s wishes.<br />
<br />
It was then that he realized why he was on the stairs, Master Jeffery had called for him, and now he had wasted so much time. Butch is coming, Master Jeffery! “Ook Ooh ooh ook!” He climbed up the stairs on all fours, before remembering his training and standing straight up, which Butch had to admit could be challenging for him, but Master Jeffery knew best, and so he got on his hind legs, keeping he back straight and posture ridged, and finished walking up the stairway. He dropped his shameful mess in the hamper in the bathroom next to Master Jeffery’s room, and knocked on the door ready and eager to serve.</p>
