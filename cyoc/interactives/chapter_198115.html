<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">After a while of futilely trying to shout words you cannot into the silent and uncaring soft breeze, you begin to quiet down. <br />
<br />
Now that you are left to your own devices, you slowly look back across your new left flank. It was strange, almost surreal, to see an ordinary-looking donkey body back there, with a sense of &quot;feeling&quot; emanating from it&#39;s shape. You can&#39;t believe that&#39;s now you! That you&#39;re now stuck with with this body! You also see the shadow of two tall ears sticking up off your head projected onto the ground from the bright glare of the sun. <br />
<br />
You see your tail whip from behind for the first time as you take in your new situation. A tail! A donkey&#39;s tail that no doubt crowns a large furry black hole! You now actually feel it moving around back there, moving in agitation! <br />
<br />
&quot;I have a tail...&quot; You almost cry with the feeling of your downgrade. But it sparks your horniness even further. You feel your new animalistic maleness extend itself in fine fashion beneath your belly. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hee hhaawww,&quot; you bray momentarily. You bend your long neck down between your front legs as much as possible. Your eyes are greeted with an unsightly foreign one-eyed monster of a black donkey-shaped cock head! You also get quite a whiff of a strong bitter-sweet barnyard animal smell through your enlarged nostrils. <br />
<br />
Shaking your head momentarily and closing your large dark eyes with your new heavy lids, you begin to collect your thoughts....<br />
<br />
&quot;Ok,&quot; you think. &quot;I guess I&#39;m now a donkey.... Now what? What is it that donkey&#39;s do...? Nevermind. I need to put those socks back on. But....how...?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;First thing&#39;s first,&quot; you continue to think to yourself. Even bray a little bit as you to to actually talk to yourself. &quot;I have to get those socks back...&quot;<br />
<br />
While you were pondering your situation, the shape and limitations of your new body hadn&#39;t quite sunk in yet. You still instinctually think you&#39;re human with human abilities. Which is entirely understandable. After all, you&#39;ve been a human your entire life, and only have been a donkey for an hour or so. You still think it should just be a simple matter of sneaking back into the stables, finding the socks, and putting them on. But your new donkey body and it&#39;s donkey instincts have different ideas. <br />
<br />
You open your big equine eyes back up and take a step towards the gate. You hear that terrifying crackling noise and freeze in mid-stride. Your hide and fur standing on end again, with a queezy feeling like vertigo deep into the pit of your stomach that oddly emanates to all four of your shoe-clad hooves. Again, you feel that same exact nervousness you feel when it comes to heights; a deep-seated phobia. Only you are terrified of the electrified fence. Your human brain doesn&#39;t understand why. It&#39;s just a fence that sends a small jolt of electricity. Surely a 500 pound animal like yourself with a tough hide shouldn&#39;t be too bothered by it. However, Jeb the real donkey is a skittish prey animal. It seems you have inherited not only his bodily shape and functions, but his fears and instincts as well.<br />
<br />
Speaking of instincts, you feel your belly rumble. A fart escapes your black hole as a pile of donkey manure rolls out. You&#39;re shitting out whatever Jeb had eaten at the time he last wore the shoes you stepped on! You feel your belly rumble again in hunger. <br />
<br />
You have a strong desire to start eating the lawn. You resist the temptation for a bit, while you take stock of yourself some more and continue to think. But your belly continues to rumble, and you can&#39;t seem to think so well with this desire to eat the sweet-smelling grass beneath your four hooves. <br />
<br />
&quot;What the hell? What could one bite hurt?&quot; <br />
<br />
You make the attempt to use a hand to pick some grass. But you forgot that you now possess donkey hooves! The inconvenience of having completely hardened immobile blocks on the ends of legs hit home for the first time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Uh. Oh...&quot; You think. <br />
<br />
You attempt to open and spread your fingers, but there are no digits at the ends of any of your four legs to obey the commands of your human mind. You have no way to grip, carry, or manipulate anything! Other than your mouth, of course. <br />
<br />
You stand there pawing at the ground, but it&#39;s useless. You have no hands. No fingers.  Not even toes.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&#39;ll just have to get help and tell someone what happened....<br />
<br />
&quot;Heee hhaawww!&quot; You bray, forgetting once again, that you can&#39;t even talk either!<br />
<br />
It begins to sink in. You begin to realize; this is now probably your life! You have no way to get to those socks. And even if you did, you couldn&#39;t ever put them on. Hell, you wouldn&#39;t even be able to take off these donkey/horseshoes now nailed to the bottoms of your hooves! You also have no way to effectively communicate with another human being!<br />
<br />
Your &quot;hands&quot; begin to feel &quot;cramped.&quot; You bray again in frustration over the loss of your precious human hands. The bray blocking your words from escaping your lips!<br />
<br />
You attempt to practice to prove the point;<br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhaawww hhheee hhaawww hhheee hhaawww!&quot; Not a single word is heard! The thoughts are there between your tall broad gray furry ears. But the sound that comes to them are not words! <br />
<br />
You stop and try to calm yourself down from the rising panic.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, shit! I always wanted to a donkey, but never really understood what it would mean to actually be one....&quot;<br />
<br />
It was more of a transformation that you wanted to experience. But unfortunately, you were robbed even of that. <br />
<br />
You think, &quot;it isn&#39;t fair, that I didn&#39;t at least get to feel my body parts changing. I was just standing there as a human one moment, and all the sudden in the very next, I was on all fours, in full donkey display...&quot;<br />
<br />
Your new reality of being trapped as such an obnoxious creature as a male jackass makes you horny. Your big black monster of a penis beginning to beg for attention. You attempt to ignore it, like you&#39;ve been doing in ignoring your hunger. But it continues to grow.<br />
<br />
Without much thought, you attempt to reach with a hand to grip it, but immediately put your leg back down with a soft but heavy *thud*. The cramped feeling of your &quot;hands&quot; somehow gets tighter in your mind. You can&#39;t even jerk yourself off! Which means....<br />
<br />
Oh....gawd....no.... <br />
<br />
You catch a certain smell on the breeze.... A female.... Your nose being larger, enables you to pick up scents a lot stronger. You are breathing through what are essentially Jeb&#39;s nostrils. To your human mind, this is beyond disgusting. It&#39;s sickening. You want to gag, but to your Jeb the donkey&#39;s body, it must mate...<br />
<br />
You find yourself making your way across the field for the first time. Like a magnet, you find the first receptive female donkey. She stinks! Your body seems to have taken over, as you begin sniffing at her cunt. To your human mind, it is overbearing and horrific. But to your body, it&#39;s very familiar. Jeb has mated with this particular female several times in the past. Even sired two valves from her. You feel the pulsating heat coming from Jeb&#39;s tool beneath your belly and between your legs. You know what&#39;s going to happen now. Resistance is futile, as you are now just along for the ride that the male jackass body that you&#39;ve become is driven by strong sexual instincts. <br />
<br />
Little do you know, Jeb&#39;s hormonal chemicals have been seeping into your human brain. Changing it. Altering it. Somewhat simplifying it. Breaking down your human resistance at following your bodily instincts and needs. Which includes altering the language center of your brain so you can instinctually pick up the simplistic animalistic bodily communications coming from others of your new species. <br />
<br />
You find yourself mounting this female, which has purposely swung it&#39;s tail out of the way so you can find her big wet folds with your big black penis. Finding your mark, you beging humping into her, closing your eyes and braying for dear life in unison with her. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh God. It&#39;s happening! It&#39;s happening!&quot; You think. *SQUIRT!* Two squirts. Three. Four! It&#39;s almost a neverending torrent as you both release at the same time. Through it all, you feel and imagine your entire human self in your head. <br />
<br />
Post-climax, you open your eyes and dismount. You find yourself falling forward, but thankfully catch yourself with your hands..... Then immediately realize you don&#39;t HAVE hands! You&#39;re still a fucking donkey! <br />
<br />
&quot;Heeee hhaawww hhee hhaawww hhheee hhaawww!&quot; You end up braying some more in consternation. Your penis still dribbling and coming down from it&#39;s post-climax high. Then it perks up again, and you feel a torrent of warm, almost hot liquid streaming out of it. The smell! Acrid urine mixed with equine jizz.... It splashes around your front hooves. Your former hands. Some of it wetting down your white belly fur a little bit. <br />
<br />
Your hunger gets more intense. You continue to resist eating like an animal. The least amount of dignity you could have, is to at least not eat like a grazing herd animal. But you find your resistance all but depleted as your head lowers towards the earth, right where you just made out with another donkey, and right where you and her both piss....<br />
<br />
Your sexual relations released a torrent of Jeb&#39;s natural hormones into your brain. You now don&#39;t even have control over where you bite the grass to chew. Jeb wouldn&#39;t mind eating mouthfuls of grass that was just wet down by sexual juices and piss. <br />
<br />
Jeb&#39;s big wet slimy warm tongue. You can taste and feel everything it can taste and feel. Your human mind is screaming with disgust, as your body calmly and deliberately acts like the dirty lowly farm that it is. You try to look yourself back over again, still trying to wrap your head around your body. But by now, you seem to have lost all control to it&#39;s needs. You are now officially grazing as a four-legged beast, and nothing you can do about it.</p>
