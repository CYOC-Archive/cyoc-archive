<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">(AN: It took me seven hours to write and post this chapter the first time. In that time someone had written the previous chapter. Since this chapter works just as well after it I decided to move it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Where am I?&quot; Trevor asked looking around. The last he remembered was laying in Cassii's arms. Now he was in a room and he could hear kittens in another room. One of the female kittens yelled, &quot;CATS RULES AND DOGS DROOL.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT,&quot; Cassii shouted back.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked over to another room and he saw six kittens race across the entrance followed by six glass wolves. His heart stopped and he was just about to go help the kittens when Queen said, &quot;You can't do anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Queen?&quot; Trevor asked turning around to see the tabby who had died for him.<br />
<br />
&quot;In the flesh so to speak,&quot; Queen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How?&quot; Trevor asked. &quot;You're dead and I can't die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're very close to death,&quot; Queen said. &quot;That's how come you can see me. Those kittens are our kittens.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But that can't be,&quot; Trevor said crying. &quot;You died saving me and you died for nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't die for nothing,&quot; Queen said. &quot;My death made you realize something about yourself.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's that?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You already know what,&quot; Queen said. &quot;You tell me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I realized that I was wallowing in self pity which is what the curse wants,&quot; Trevor said. &quot;I was miserable not being able to make any human friends. If I did I couldn't speak English around them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Anything else?&quot; Queen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I realized that I love you Queen,&quot; Trevor said breaking down and crying again.<br />
<br />
&quot;And I love you Trevor,&quot; Queen said. &quot;I realized that when you were in trouble. It was like being reborn. No longer did I look at you like another tom. I looked at you as a life-time mate. A mate that would watch over our kittens until we died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Unfortunately that can't happen now,&quot; Trevor said sighing.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know what you're seeing in the other room?&quot; Queen asked.<br />
<br />
Trevor looked up and saw the kittens run past again. As the six glass wolf pups came pass the doorway six lion cubs pounced on them. They went down in a fit of giggles and Trevor heard Alice say, &quot;Good pounce.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mary said giggling. &quot;Do you surrender?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Never,&quot; Cassii said flipping one of the cubs off her. &quot;You can't do anything to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh really,&quot; the cub that had pounced on Cassii said. She pounced again but Cassii sidestepped and started tickling the cub.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's enough children,&quot; Trevor heard Martha say as she came into sight. A lion that looked like Martha was with her.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's time for the ceremony,&quot; the cub's nanny said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So you cubs need to clean up,&quot; Trevor heard himself say. The only thing was he didn't say anything. Then he saw himself come into view sitting on top of Mr. P.<br />
<br />
The Trevor on Mr. P slipped a bit and Mr. P said, &quot;Careful Trevor. We don't want you hurting yourself unnecessarily. You're still healing from the ill fated attempt to kidnap you and Madam Serenity.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are your pups at?&quot; Trevor on Mr. P asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're around here somewhere,&quot; Mr. P said. &quot;They're probably with their mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then they're probably with Queen learning cat lore,&quot; Trevor on Mr. P said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is this?&quot; Trevor asked. &quot;It looks like the pack and pride are friendly.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;They are,&quot; Queen said. &quot;At least in this version of the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This version?&quot; Trevor said. &quot;This can't be the future though. You died.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;There is a way for me to come back,&quot; Queen said. &quot;I can't tell you what that way is but with this version Cassii figures it out shortly.<br />
<br />
&quot;What's the ceremony?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;They're welcoming someone into the pack or pride,&quot; Queen said. &quot;Whoever it is made the choice to join of their own free will.&quot;<br />
<br />
Trevor sighed as the group moved off. After a moment he said, &quot;At least they're adding people who are willing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That is a good thing,&quot; Queen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;How did they become friends?&quot; Trevor asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can't tell you that,&quot; Queen said nuzzling Trevor. &quot;I won't remember much of this when I come back to you. So I'm going to say this right now. I'm proud of you Trevor. You are what cats should be. Now I need to go and you need to awaken. Please don't hurt yourself as they need you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do they need me?&quot; Trevor asked as everything began to fade.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... love... you...&quot; Queen said her voice fading.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
While Trevor was meeting with Queen and seeing a possible future Mary and her parents came out after discussing adding the police to the pride. Those that were going to become lions before still wanted to. They even volunteered to be lions permanently. Mary looked at Trevor and said, &quot;Oh no Trevor!&quot; She rushed over and not seeing him breath she asked in a quiet voice, &quot;When did he die?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He's not dead even though he looks like it,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;He can't die for another seventeen years.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Mary asked looking stunned.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's part of his transform,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;I never realized just what the transform's wording meant until Cassii told me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So he'll be alright?&quot; Mary asked hope in her voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;He'll be in a lot of pain but he'll be alright,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Then I should take him home,&quot; Madam Serenity said. &quot;Let him wake up in a place other than a police station.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll drive you home Madam Serenity,&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I thank you,&quot; Madam Serenity said with a bow then took Trevor from Cassii.<br />
<br />
As soon as Trevor was out of Cassii's arms the blood stains on her dress disappeared. Looking at it Cassii said, &quot;I guess stains count as damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looks like it,&quot; Madam Serenity said.<br />
<br />
Mary had an idea and asked, &quot;Daddy, Mommy, could I go swimming? I want Cassii to come with.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Brian said slowly. &quot;We'll be adding to the pride here shortly. And you two will be alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Perhaps Abby and Samantha would like to go swimming too,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they wouldn't be swimming as such being glass in this world,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well they could at least talk with us,&quot; Mary said. &quot;And I'd like Ulysses to come too. I want to talk to him.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want that dirty dog with you,&quot; Brian said his voice carrying his anger clearly.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know Mr. Hardy, I'm a dirty dog too,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;You don't look like it right now,&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That's because I can choose my form,&quot; Cassii said smiling. &quot;Right now I choose to be human. Mary, I know Ulysses wants to talk to you too. Mr. Hardy, we have a pool and I'm sure Daddy won't mind Mary coming over.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Absolutely not,&quot; Brian stated firmly. &quot;I won't have Mary with all those dogs.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then a public pool,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;We can take care of ourselves. Abby and Samantha are indestructible and they love Mary. They'd help to keep her safe. With Ulysses with us there won't be many people that would do anything to us. And if we couldn't handle it we can always escape into the mirror world where they won't be able to follow us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian sighed. He wanted Mary to be happy. She gave up being human again for them just as they had become lions for her. He didn't like the idea of her being with any of the wolves but he trusted Cassii. He sighed again and said, &quot;I'll say yes provisionally. The only ones that I want to be with you are Cassii, Ulysses, Abby, and Samantha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll be there too,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Brian said. &quot;Cassii, I'm going to trust you with the safety of my daughter. I want you to promise me that she won't be going to your house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She wouldn't be in danger there but I understand your concern,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;I promise none of us will take her to the manor.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alright,&quot; Brian said. &quot;Meet us at our house in ten minutes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy won't like that,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;We'll meet you at the pool. We can come out of your car's mirror.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We'll be waiting for you there then,&quot; Brian said.<br />
<br />
Cassii curtsied and shifted into her glass wolf form. She jumped through a window and walked out of sight.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Jensen was deep in thought. He had sent Abby, Samantha, and Ulysses to join the other pups. Ulysses was to inform one of the other wolves that he would be staying with the pups and that two more beds were needed in there. He was also to tell Martha and Mr. P that he would be in there and help to watch the younger pups. Kaylee had come in to check on him a few minutes ago. Now she asked, &quot;What's wrong dear?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where should I start?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;First about Marcine and Jack. I'm thinking that it may be kinder to leave their minds like they are. The second is the grotesques. I want to keep them as security though I don't think many of them will want to continue once their minds are free. Then there's the statues. I don't know if Candii's idea will work with them. Then there's the shadows. I don't think there's anything we can do to return them to the way they were. Now that Cassii has joined us Alice may want to bring two more in to regain a sort of balance with the glass pups. I'm also worried about the fact that those in the pack may not age. And finally I'm worried about the pride and me dying.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I see,&quot; Kaylee said. &quot;I don't know how we'll get through all this but I believe we will as a pack. Everyone has decided to stay even though many of them are upset about being transformed against their will.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm sure we will,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I wish I could shake this feeling that I'm going to die. The feeling has been growing stronger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can tell you what that is,&quot; Kaylee said. &quot;You're just being a responsible parent and pack leader. You've taken steps to make sure the pack will still function in the event that you do die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I guess you're right,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I'm going to give Alice permission to bring two more glass pups into the pack. I have an idea of who she can ask.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was then that Cassii came in and asked, &quot;Daddy, can Abby, Samantha, Ulysses, Cindii, and me go swimming with Mary at the public pool?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'd prefer if you brought Mary here to go swimming,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Mr. Hardy is understandable hesitant to allow Mary to come here,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;And before you ask we'll be meeting them at the pool.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are the Hardys going to be there too?&quot; Jensen asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think they have something to do while we're swimming,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well if Ulysses is with you I'll say you can,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;However if for some reason you're in danger I want all of you to come back here. That includes Mary. We can protect her better here for the moment until the pride gets large enough. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Daddy,&quot; Cassii said. She wouldn't mention the part about bringing Mary here if there should be trouble. Mr. Hardy would cancel the swimming if he knew that.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to see Alice so could you send her here before you go?&quot; Jensen asked. &quot;I also want to see Isabella.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Daddy,&quot; Cassii said then skipped out of the room.<br />
<br />
&quot;You're going to let Alice bring two more in aren't you?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am,&quot; Jensen said smiling. &quot;There'll be six glass pups and six flesh and blood pups. It balances out don't you think?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course,&quot; Kaylee said smiling.<br />
<br />
A few moments later Isabelle and Alice came in Isabelle asking, &quot;You wanted to see us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I did,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Alice, I know you want to bring two more glass wolf pups into the pack. You have my permission to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have someone in mind Father?&quot; Alice asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I do,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Isabelle, what was that boy's name that wanted to become on of us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;William Moore,&quot; Isabelle said.<br />
<br />
Jensen closed his eyes and then opened them again saying, &quot;He's at 2012 Sycamore. Go to him. Remember to tell him exactly what he's going to be should he accept.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course Father,&quot; Alice said and curtsied. She then walked into the mirror in the den.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Across town Mrs. Moore was doing the laundry while Billy was watching some TV. She came through and smiled at him. She was a little worried about him sine she heard that he wanted to be a werewolf. The wolf he had talked to was nice but she still had a heart attack when she had rubbed his head. He hadn't stopped talking about it since. She wished her husband was still alive. He was better at dealing with this type of stuff. Sighing she turned her head and saw a wolf girl in the mirror. She screamed and dropped the basket with the clean laundry in it.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am sorry for startling you,&quot; Alice apologized.<br />
<br />
&quot;Who... who are you?&quot; Mrs. Moore got out.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am Alice,&quot; Alice said. &quot;You must be William Moore and his mother.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;He prefers to be called Billy but yes,&quot; Mrs. Moore said. &quot;Why are you here and how are you in my mirror?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pleased to meet you,&quot; Alice said curtsying. &quot;I have the ability to travel through mirrors.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool,&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why are you here?&quot; Mrs. Moore repeated.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am here because William has expressed a desire to be a wolf,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes I do,&quot; Billy said jumping up and down clapping. &quot;Can you make me one?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can though I have to tell what you will be before I can,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;And what's that?&quot; Mrs. Moore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;If I make you a wolf you will be like me,&quot; Alice said. &quot;You will be a little girl wolf pup. In the outside world you will be a solid piece of glass. In that form you will not have any physical needs. You will be able to travel through mirrors like I am able to. In the mirror world you will be flesh and blood and when you show up in a mirror you will appear like a ghost. You will be able to bring others into the mirror world and if they are not part of the pack or loyal to the pack they will become glass wolf girls. In the outside world you will be indestructible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What's inde... inde?&quot; Billy started to ask.<br />
<br />
&quot;She means you can't be hurt,&quot; Mrs. Moore said smiling. Looking at Alice she said, &quot;Well Alice that sounds like a nice bargain. There has to be some sort of catch though.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am not aware of one,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you happy being a glass wolf girl?&quot; Mrs. Moore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;That I am,&quot; Alice said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I want to be like Alice Mommy,&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Is this offer only for my son?&quot; Mrs. Moore asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;It can be for you if you wish,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well there's not much for us here,&quot; Mrs. Moore said. &quot;My parents disowned me when I had Billy so I don't talk to them anymore and I don't enjoy my job. Give me a few minutes to quit my job and call the school to tell them Billy will no longer be attending.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will wait,&quot; Alice said.<br />
<br />
As his mom went to make the calls Billy asked, &quot;So you don't have to bite us?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It does not work that way,&quot; Alice said smiling. &quot;I am sure you will enjoy being a glass wolf girl.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I will,&quot; Billy said getting excited. &quot;I want to become one now.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I said I would wait for your mother William,&quot; Alice said. &quot;How old are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm five and a half,&quot; Billy said proudly.<br />
<br />
Alice nodded. He's a half year older than her sister/cousins. She had to wonder if his mother would be the same age when she comes in. Eventually she came back in and said, &quot;Well I guess we're ready. What will we do with our stuff though?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it will be sold and some of it will be kept,&quot; Alice said. &quot;The clothes will be sold since we have no need for them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But you're wearing a dress right now,&quot; Mrs. Moore said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That is only when I am in the mirror world as it will be with you,&quot; Alice said. &quot;If you are ready take hold of my paws,&quot; she said as she reached out of the mirror.<br />
<br />
Mrs. Moore looked at the glass paws and said, &quot;You weren't kidding.&quot; She saw that Billy had grabbed one paw. Sighing she said, &quot;I guess I won't be Billy's mom after this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You will be his sister/cousin as he will be your sister/cousin,&quot; Alice said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well Billy you'll need a new name for when you're a girl,&quot; Mrs. Moore said. &quot;As the last act as your mother I'll give you the name Billie. That's spelled B-I-L-L-I-E. Spelled that way it's a girl's name and you won't be confused as much. Now since I won't be your mother anymore you will need to call me Susie. Can you do that Billie?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I can Mommy,&quot; Billy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't call me Mommy anymore,&quot; Susie said. &quot;As soon as we go through the mirror we will be different. You will need to call me by my name since I will be your sister. Now what is my name.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Mommy,&quot; Billy said. After a look from Susie he said, &quot;Um Susie.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;That's better,&quot; Susie said. &quot;Now we can go through.&quot; She took Alice's other paw smiling. She was going to be a little girl again. She won't have the worries adults have. This was going very nice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Welcome to the family,&quot; Alice said as she started to pull them in. As before there was a pop and Alice tumbled back. This time though she knew what was going to happen and a second later two girl wolves fell on tp of her. Once they got up she saw that they were wearing similar dresses. They were white and the bottom puffed out with lace on the hem and sleeves. Billie's had light pink patterns on her dress while Susie had light yellow. They both had dirty blond fur. Alice took their paws and said, &quot;Now to go home. Just three steps and we are there.&quot;<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Outside of Glendale in an underground complex a group was gathered. They called themselves Curse Hunters and they removed those transformed from Glendale. They kept them in special holding cells seeing them as a danger. Most of those gathered were young adults. Up front there was a man in his fifties who looked over the rest. He cleared his throat and the buzz in the room died down. &quot;You all know why you're here,&quot; he began. &quot;The curse in Glendale is spreading once again. It's your mission as it was mine to capture the threats and bring them here. The earplugs you'll be wearing will filter out the phrase &quot;Transform or Dare?&quot;. Make no mistake though that you will likely run into threats that can physically harm you. So be careful and don't try taking big groups on your own. Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How will we know if someone has been cursed Mr. Moore?&quot; a man known as Rogers asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;You'll be given glasses that will allow you to see a black energy around the threats,&quot; Mr. Moore said. &quot;Of course there's some that you won't need the glasses for. With those cases if it doesn't look like a normal human, animal, or object then it's a threat. Now if there are no more questions,&quot; he paused looking at Rogers with a hard stare. 'This was covered in his training,' he thought. 'He better not put the operation in danger.' Seeing that no one had any questions he said, &quot;Gear up and neutralize the threats.&quot;<br />
<br />
They filed into another room where they received their earplugs, glasses, and guns. These would shoot balls that would put anything to sleep. If they failed for some reason they had grenades that did the same thing but were more powerful. Soon about seven black vans were driving to Glendale.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Cassii and the others emerged from the side mirror on the Hardy's car. Brian, Felicity, and Mary got out and Brian said, &quot;We'll be back in three hours. Cassii, Ulysses. If anything happens to my daughter I'll hold you two responsible and make sure you pay.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Daddy nothing's going to happen to me,&quot; Mary whined.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's my job to worry about you,&quot; Brian said ruffling Mary's fur.<br />
<br />
&quot;As well you should as a father,&quot; Cassii said with all seriousness. &quot;If you didn't you wouldn't be worthy of being an omega let alone an alpha.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm still going to kill those foster parents you had Cassii,&quot; Brian said anger in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let the police handle that,&quot; Cassii said her voice carrying a tone that said she didn't want anyone going to jail for murder. In a lighter tone she said, &quot;We'll see you in three hours then.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Have fun,&quot; Brian and Felicity said giving Mary a hug. They then got in their car and drove off.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well lets go in,&quot; Cassii suggested. &quot;I want to wear my new swimsuit.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You've had that for three months,&quot; Cindii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;But this is the first time I'll be able to wear it,&quot; Cassii said shifting to her human form. &quot;That makes it new.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't argue with that,&quot; Cindii conceded.<br />
<br />
They went into the changing rooms after paying the admission fee. Unbeknown to them though a couple of people in a black van had seen them. They missed Brian and Felicity but did see the kids. They even saw Cassii shift. Rogers looked at his partner and said, &quot;Well our first tag Manson.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll have four tags to your one,&quot; Manson said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only because there's more girls in that group,&quot; Rogers said. &quot;We need to go in and get them.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Lets go then,&quot; Manson said getting out.<br />
<br />
In the changing room Cassii took off her dress, bra, panties, and locket putting them in one of the lockers. &quot;Why aren't you in wolf form?&quot; Abby asked as Cassii pulled her bikini bottom on.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because glass sinks and I want to actually swim,&quot; Cassii said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So we can't swim?&quot; Abby asked looking down.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well you can get in the water,&quot; Cassii said pulling her bikini top on. &quot;It's just that you'll be on the bottom of the pool. But look at it this way. You'll be able to stay underwater for as long as you want where the others won't be able to. You could tickle some feet.&quot; She winked at them as she said the last.<br />
<br />
&quot;Like your's,&quot; Samantha said then giggled which set them all off giggling.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately their giggling was interrupted as a green ball hit Mary and she fell down unconscious. Abby, Samantha, and Cassii barely had time to wonder what happened before they too were hit and fell unconscious. Cindii looked at the woman who had come in and asked, &quot;What did you do to them?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Same thing I'm going to do to you,&quot; Manson said and fired again.<br />
<br />
Cindii tumbled off the bench before the ball could hit her. Unfortunately porcelain and concrete don't mix well. By the time she had reformed Manson was standing over her and fired again hitting her target this time.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Three hours later at the manor Jenson was getting worried. It was getting close to meal time and Cassii, Cindii, Abby, Samantha, and Ulysses weren't back yet. He could see how the others may not notice that it's getting close to dinner but Ulysses should be feeling hungry. He was roused from his musings by the buzzer from the front gate. That was shortly followed by Brian shouting, &quot;GIVE US OUR DAUGHTER BACK JENSEN. IF YOU DON'T WE'LL COME IN AND TAKE HER BACK.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What shall we do?&quot; Pearl asked hugging her son to her.<br />
<br />
&quot;Let them in,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Something is obviously wrong. I just hope they'll listen to reason.&quot;<br />
<br />
A couple minutes later Brian and Felicity came through the front doors. They would have broken them down if they weren't already open. As soon as Brian saw Jensen he asked, &quot;WHERE IS SHE?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;She isn't here,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
&quot;YOU LIE,&quot; Felicity said obviously upset.<br />
<br />
&quot;I wish I was,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
Brian grabbed Jensen and lifted him up saying in a low threatening voice, &quot;I want my daughter back.&quot;<br />
<br />
Everyone was about to jump on Brian and Felicity when Jensen said, &quot;No one touch them. Am I clear?&quot;<br />
<br />
The pack backed up a bit and a voice said, &quot;As you wish master.&quot;<br />
<br />
Felicity looked behind them and said, &quot;It's one of the stone gargoyles we saw.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen looked at Brian and said, &quot;No one will touch them no matter what. If they kill me you are to leave them alone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But my love...&quot; Kaylee started to protest.<br />
<br />
&quot;I said you will leave them alone,&quot; Jensen said with a note of finality in his voice. &quot;Now Mr. Hardy kill me if you wish but I ask that you listen first.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is my daughter?&quot; Brian said the threat clear in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;She's not here but I can find her,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Just give me a moment.&quot; With that he closed his eyes. After a few moments his calm face took on a stormy countenance. As the moments passed it became darker and darker. Finally he opened his eyes and said, &quot;I can't find any of them.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a collective gasp from the pack since they knew Jensen's ability to find anyone. For him not to find who he was looking for was a first. &quot;How can you not find them?&quot; Darla, Fran, and Julie asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Jensen admitted sadly. &quot;Go ahead and kill me Mr. Hardy. I've not only failed my pack but I've also failed your daughter.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why would you say you failed her?&quot; Brian asked. &quot;She isn't your responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When she's with any of my pack I extend my responsibility to her,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I had told Cassii that if the ran into any trouble that they were to come back here and bring Mary with them since we could protect her better than you could at present.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You told her to bring my daughter here?&quot; Brian asked a dangerous tone in his voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Only if there was trouble,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Now it looks like there was trouble and they couldn't get to a reflective surface.&quot;<br />
<br />
Brian looked into Jensen's eyes and didn't see the smug look he expected. Instead he saw the worry of a father who didn't know where his children were and the anger toward whoever dared harm them. He put Jensen down and said, &quot;I'm not going to kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Felicity asked very surprised. &quot;This is a dirty dog that deserves to die.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Maybe but he doesn't have Mary,&quot; Brian said in a calm tone. &quot;I think we'll need him to find her. The pack and pride will have to work together to find them.&quot; He took a breath and asked, &quot;I assume you've been able to find people before so why can't you now? Could it be that they're... dead?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; Jensen said firmly. &quot;Abby, Samantha, Cassii, and Cindii can't be killed. I can only guess that I have a limited range that I can find people in. They must be outside that range.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How do we find them then?&quot; Brian asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;We use our noses,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;Darla, Fran. We'll need your police experience for this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;May I suggest you get Madam Serenity to help you,&quot; Julie said.<br />
<br />
&quot;That would be a good idea,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;We'll go get Madam Serenity then go to the pool. We should be able to pick up their trail there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Honey,&quot; Brian said. &quot;Until we know what happened I want you and the rest of the pride here.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You mean stay with a bunch of dirty dogs,&quot; Felicity said disgusted.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want whatever happened to the kids to happen to you and the rest of the pride,&quot; Brian said holding Felicity's shoulders. &quot;I hate to admit it but they have a better defended house than we do.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alice, Billie, Susie,&quot; Jensen said. &quot;I want you to take Mrs. Hardy and gather the rest of their pride. The less time they spend on the street the better. Bring their families too as they could also be in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you know where Madam Serenity is?&quot; Brian asked. &quot;We offered to take her home but I don't think she had us drop her off at the right place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Jensen closed his eyes again and when he opened them he was smiling. &quot;What a shrewed woman,&quot; he said. &quot;I wouldn't have thought to look for her there.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Where is she?&quot; Kaylee asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your old house my love,&quot; Jensen said.<br />
<br />
++++++<br />
<br />
Several hours later Cassii and the others were waking up. The first thing they noticed was that each of them were in what looked to be some sort of cell. &quot;Good morning,&quot; a voice said. &quot;I'm Mr. Moore and I'm sure you have questions. You're in what we call the curse cells. You're here because you're threats.&quot;<br />
<br />
Cassii saw Mr. Moore walking in a hall between the cells. &quot;Why are we threats?&quot; she asked. &quot;We haven't done anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You're a threat because you exist,&quot; Mr. Moore said. &quot;Since the curse began we have captured your kind when the curse had started running wild. Each time we run it to ground but it always comes back. Now you'll notice that there's two doors to your cells. They may look like glass but they're as hard as diamond. The walls are thick adamantium. The doors and walls are vibrating to stop you if any of you can walk through solid objects. In case you do happen to break one of the doors there are guards walking around and they'll trigger the release of lethal gas into your cells. You don't need to breathe this gas in for it to kill you just simple contact is enough. Now you'll notice that you have a toilet and sink in your cells. There are a few things in the pipes which prevent escape through them. If you try you'll die. You'll also notice that you're alone in your cells except for you two.&quot; He stooped in front of Cassii and Cindii's cell and said, &quot;Since our agents saw you holding onto the doll I figured I could risk putting both of you in one cell. You'll be let out for showers under guard of course and they're authorized to use lethal force if need be. Your meals will be placed between the doors and only one will be open at a time. Any questions?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have one for you Mr. Moore,&quot; Cassii said. &quot;Transform or dare?&quot; While she may need to ask Cindii's permission to use the turn she gave her she didn't need it to for her second turn and this came under her daddy's exception on using the curse.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll choose dare,&quot; Mr. Moore said smiling.<br />
<br />
&quot;I dare you to let all of us out and neither you nor anyone else involved with this operation will bother us ever again,&quot; Cassii said smiling herself. She had been hoping he was stupid enough to pick dare.<br />
<br />
He lifted his hand up and looked scared as he moved to one side. As he was he said, &quot;I... can't... stop... myself. You... can't... make me... do this.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Well I did,&quot; Cassii said having a hard time containing her laughter.<br />
<br />
&quot;I... can't... do... this,&quot; Mr. Moore said. He then put his hand down and said, &quot;And I won't. The question has no power here outside of Glendale. You just wasted your turn little girl. Now I have a few things to do. Your lunch will be here soon. Have a nice day.&quot; He left laughing.<br />
<br />
'Laugh all you want,' Cassii thought. 'We'll see who has the last laugh when we escape.' She knew her daddy would be find them as would Mr. Hardy. You don't kidnap the children of a pack or pride and expect to live. Looking at the door which seemed to be the whole wall she noticed that it was reflective. However with the lights the reflective quality was too poor to use. She would have to wait and see if that would change. It made sense that they would lower the lights at night and then they could escape.</p>
