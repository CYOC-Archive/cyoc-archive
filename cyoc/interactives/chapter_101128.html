<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">The witch smiled, as she entered the tent and approached the large boar-woman.  Christina was laying on her throne, greedily devouring some food as usual.<br />
<br />
&quot;So, witch, have you come to fulfill your end of the bargain?&quot; asked Christina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, &quot; said the witch, barely able to contain her laughter. &quot;This is just what you need.&quot;<br />
<br />
She held out a large goblet, filled with a green thick liquid.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are my warriors?&quot; asked Christina.<br />
<br />
The witch shrugged.  &quot;The woods are a dangerous place, and I have many enemies.&quot;<br />
<br />
In truth, it was the witch herself that had dispatched them.  Christina may have been too powerful for her transformation magic, but her pig-men were no challenge for her.  She did not need any witnesses to the creation of her potion, regardless of how stupid they were.  And it had made her search for ingredients much easier.<br />
<br />
Christina eyed her skeptically.  &quot;And this will really work?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh yes, &quot; said the witch. &quot;It should produce the desired result.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina signaled one of her guards, and he took the goblet from the witch.  He began to drink it, and the witch paled.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your highness!  You must drink the entire potion for it to be effective.  If you share it, it will not be potent enough to have any effect, &quot; said the witch quickly.<br />
<br />
Christina grunted, and the soldier lowered the goblet from his lips with clear disappointment.  But Christina grunted again, deeper and more threatening, and the guard quickly brought the goblet to Christina.  The witch winced as small drops of the potion sloshed out of the goblet as he walked.<br />
<br />
Christina grabbed the goblet from his hands.  In her large hooves it looked like a child&#39;s toy.  She eyed the witch with suspicion.<br />
<br />
&quot;You know if this is poison, my guards will kill you.  You may have enough power to stop a few of them, but even your magic is no match for an army, &quot; said Christina.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, your highness.  I would not dare try to harm the Queen.  Now, drink, &quot; said the witch eagerly, as she motioned for Christina to lift the cup to her lips.<br />
<br />
Christina was still suspicious, but what could she lose.  She was already a monster with unending hunger.  What could be worse?  And if the witch betrayed her, she meant to follow through on her threat.  She had already ordered her village to kill the witch if she attempted to harm her.<br />
<br />
Christina gulped down the liquid.  It smelled awful, and had a greasy, slimy texture.  But she had eaten worse, and it had not yet bothered her.  She swallowed the entire contents of the goblet quickly and with little difficulty. She threw the goblet down in triumph.<br />
<br />
She felt a warmth in her stomach.  The warmth slowly spread through her abdomen.  It settled on her uterus.  She felt her young kicking wildly.  Then, the warmth intensified into a burning sensation.  The kicking stopped, and she felt satisfied.  But soon she felt hungry again.  <br />
<br />
She was about to angrily rebuke the witch for her failure, when she heard a squealing at one of her teats.  She looked down and saw the piglet feeding there withdraw from her, squealing in pain.  A thick green mucus trailed from his snout to her teat.  The piglet squealed, shaking its head to try to rid its self of the gelatinous liquid.  Christina could see that the piglet&#39;s snout looked different, smaller and misshapen, almost as if it was melting.  Strangely, she did not feel disgusted, but rather felt good, almost like the feeling of euphoria she got when she ate.<br />
<br />
&quot;Witch! &quot; said Christina angrily.  &quot;Your potion - it&#39;s not working.   It&#39;s not doing what it&#39;s supposed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, it&#39;s working all right.  It is doing exactly what it&#39;s supposed to do.  Exactly what I intended it to do, &quot; said the witch with a smile.<br />
<br />
The piglets face was suddenly pulled towards Christina&#39;s body rapidly by the string of mucus.  Its face was pressed tightly into her body.  She could feel it struggling against her skin.  She watched as its face seemed to melt into her body, being absorbed into her massive gut.  The skin around its face now had a sickly green color, similar to the liquid in the goblet.  Christina knew she should be concerned, but the process did not hurt. In fact, the more contact the piglet made with her body, the better she felt. It was almost orgasmic.  She moaned slightly in pleasure<br />
<br />
&quot;What.... what have you done to me?&quot; asked Christina, in a breathy husky voice.<br />
<br />
&quot;Exactly what I said. I have given you what you deserve, &quot; said the witch.<br />
<br />
The witch began to back towards the exit.  The guards seemed unsure what to do.  The Queen seemed to be enjoying herself, but the struggles of the young piglet was clearly upsetting them.  One of the female pig-people tried to pull the small piglet away, but it only seemed to push the piglet further into her body.  Soon, the pig-woman&#39;s hands were deeply embedded into Christina&#39;s body.<br />
<br />
&quot;Stop  .... stop it, &quot; moaned Christina in a husky voice.  The feelings of pleasure increased, and she could barely control herself.  She felt full of energy.  It was liked the high after a large meal.  Her abdomen began to swell, pressing against the trapped pig-woman.  She turned her head and struggled. Green tendrils erupted from Christina&#39;s belly and wrapped around the pig-woman, and pulled her closely to Christina&#39;s body.  Christina moaned, as the woman was dissolved into her body.<br />
<br />
The pig guards now rushed forward, angry at their Queen.  It looked like she had betrayed them, in the name of power.  They tried to pierce her body with their spears, but the weapons slid into her soft body like knives into gelatin.  Tendrils of green slime snaked down the shafts of their weapons, and pulled them up onto her soft chest.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Stop, stop, &quot; she moaned.  &quot;You are just making it worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
The soldiers were pressed tightly against her chest, and were slowly absorbed into her body.  Her body responded to the food by growing slightly larger.  As her body grew her features became softer, and less defined.  It looked like she was slowly melting.  Her entire body began to take on a green sheen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Please, make it stop, &quot; said Christina.  She felt very good, but she knew that this was wrong.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am afraid I cannot.  The process is irreversible.  Soon, you will complete your transformation into a slime monster. And then the only thing that will be able to stop you is fire, &quot; said the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why? &quot; said Christina softly.  Her face was now a sloppy mess.  She still had a mouth and eyes, but they looked like holes in a pile of pudding.  It was difficult to form words.<br />
<br />
&quot;Because, my dear pet, you forced my hand.  I will not be made a slave by anyone, especially not a filthy pig.  Transforming you into a slime was relatively easy, with the right ingredients.  And it will solve both of my problems at once.  It will get rid of you, and you will consume your little army, &quot; said the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;No, &quot; said Christina softly. &quot;They will kill you.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think so.  I think they will have their hands full dealing with you, &quot; said the witch.<br />
<br />
&quot;No .... wouldn&#39;t .... harm  .... them,&quot; Christina struggled to say.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh my poor pet.  You must not know much about slime creatures.  I don&#39;t think you will have much of a choice, &quot; said the witch.  She pointed to the ground, and Christina saw that the grass below her was slowly being dissolved into her gelatinous body.  Suddenly, tendrils of green mucus shot out onto the pile of food, and began to rapidly absorb the material into her body.  As the material slowly dissolved, her body began to swell larger.<br />
<br />
&quot;No ... stop &quot; , said Christina, as she struggled to pull the tendrils back into her body.  But they seemed to ignore her and continue to feed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tsk, tsk, &quot; said the witch sadly.  &quot;You really do not know much about slime.  Your previous hunger is nothing compared that of a slime.  Every part of your body is devoted entirely to feeding, and getting more food.  It is an uncontrollable desire.  You will not be able to stop yourself.  The minor actions of your body are beyond your control, just as a human cannot control the digestion of food in their stomach.  Every part of your body is now dedicated to obtaining and digesting food, and no amount of willpower can stop it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christina&#39;s body now began to spread out as it grew, extending under the tent to the grass outside.  She continued to grow, as the newly trapped organic material was rapidly absorbed.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, I guess it is time for me to take my leave.  But don&#39;t worry.  I will be back to end your misery with a nice fire spell.  After you have finished digesting your tribe, of course,&quot; said the witch, as she disappeared out of the tent.<br />
<br />
Christina fell forward, and rolled out of her tent.  She could not see the witch, but her village saw the massive beast that erupted from the tent of their Queen.  She could hear angry shouts, and a small army rapidly appeared before her.<br />
<br />
She tried to warn them to back off, but her voice came out as a series of gurgles.  Tendrils of green slime shot out, and dragged the pig-people into her body.  She could feel them struggling as they were dissolved. Her mass increased exponentially, and she felt the familiar euphoria of a satisfied meal.  But it was short lived, as her hunger resumed.  Her body moved again, almost on its own accord, as it rolled towards more pig-people fleeing from her village.</p>
