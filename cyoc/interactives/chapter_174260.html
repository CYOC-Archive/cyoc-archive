<p id="chapter-text" class="serif">Before they could do anything they heard someone entering the bathroom. Amber pulled Isis into a stall and whispered to her &quot;Please be quiet now, we cannot be found.&quot;<br />
<br />
Isis obeyed Amber and the two were quiet waiting for whoever came in to give up and leave.<br />
<br />
Amber took a little peek and saw that it was a female security guard who was looking for them wielding her gun.<br />
<br />
The female security guard did not give up and in a moment she arrived at the stall where Amber and Isis were hiding and found them. The Egyptian girl jumped on the guard, who was taken by surprise and had no time to react, letting her weapon fall and then being immobilized, but Isis was squeezing her neck tightly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Isis, stop it. You will kill her.&quot; Amber said<br />
<br />
&quot;It is exactly what I intend to do, so we will be free.&quot; Isis said<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot kill her, it will only make things worse for us.&quot; Amber said<br />
<br />
That said, Isis obeyed and gave up killing the guard, taking her hands off her neck but covering her mouth so she couldn&#39;t scream. Then, finding nothing to tie her, Amber wrapped her long cock around the guard to hold her arms.<br />
<br />
&quot;We have already captured her god Thoth. I just don&#39;t understand why you have mercy on her.&quot; Isis said<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what it was like in your day, but nowadays we don&#39;t just kill others. And &#8203;&#8203;stop calling me Thoth, my name is Amber and I am no god.&quot; she said<br />
<br />
&quot;How not? Look what you did to me just by writing on your clay tablet.&quot; Isis said<br />
<br />
&quot;It&#39;s not a clay tablet and I didn&#39;t use my powers, but a tool that I don&#39;t know exactly how it works, I just know it works. See, you slept for 5000 years, things have changed a lot in this time. Not only has the culture changed since that time but you are also far from your homeland, this is not Egypt.&quot; Amber said<br />
<br />
&quot;But...&quot; Isis tried to argue but Amber interrupted her by saying &quot;I admit the culture shock is great and the app I used uses the words like that god with what you mistook me for. If you find it better you can think as if your god Thoth is lending his power to me through this app.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It means that you are channeling the power of the god Thoth into your tablet just as our priests did.&quot; Isis said and Amber thought it best that she thought that way.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that we have resolved this mess we have to decide what to do with the guard here, we cannot take it with us.&quot; Amber said<br />
<br />
&quot;You already tied her up, now we just have to go out and leave her here.&quot; Isis said<br />
<br />
&quot;It won&#39;t work, you didn&#39;t see that she is being immobilized by my dick.&quot; Amber said<br />
<br />
&quot;Now that you mentioned that I realized it was a part of your body, I had thought it was a rope.&quot; Isis said and after thinking a little commented &quot;Perhaps it would be easier if you use Thoth&#39;s power again.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amber understood that Isis was referring to the app, so she took out her cell phone and searched for custody sentences, but none that gave her a good idea until she showed up &quot;Kate is tired of waiting to be released.&quot; Despite the situation they were in, she exchanged &#39;released&#39; for &#39;fucked&#39; and when looking back at Kate, saw her running her hand through her slender pussy as she could through her pants.<br />
<br />
&quot;I think we can let her go now, she will no longer be a danger to us and maybe she will give us a good time.&quot; Amber said and released Kate from her dick. Isis obeyed her and removed her hand from her mouth.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you intend to do, but I&#39;m not going to let you get away with it.&quot; Kate said<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not? I just want to give you what you want.&quot; Amber said showing the hard tip of her cock.<br />
<br />
Kate wanted to react, but she didn&#39;t know why but she wanted that super long cock so badly. The temptation was so much that she couldn&#39;t resist, she took off all her clothes and got on all fours on the floor saying &quot;Okay I admit, I really want you to fuck me. Do your best and depending on your performance I can help you escape later.&quot; <br />
<br />
Amber did not hesitate and put the tip of her cock against Kate&#39;s pussy, pushing all she could inside. At this time she remembered that despite everything she had already done with her dick it was the first time she had penetrated a pussy.<br />
<br />
Picking up her cell phone again and selecting herself, receiving the sentence &quot;Amber is loving feeling her cock inside Kate.&quot; She ended up having an idea and changed &#39;inside&#39; for &#39;through&#39; Immediately she felt the resistance that prevented her dick from going deeper disappearing. She then pushed her dick until it went all the way inside Kate and out of her mouth. Isis then took the tip of Amber&#39;s dick and pulled until the entire dick had already passed through the guard&#39;s pussy.<br />
<br />
At this time they were surprised when another guard entered the bathroom and caught them. Amber immediately took out her cell phone and selected the new guard. &quot;&quot;Priscila was concerned that Kate didn&#39;t give any news after going to check the bathroom and went to check what had happened to her.&quot; it was the sentence that appeared. The sentence was informative but did not provide a solution, so she asked for another, receiving &quot;Priscila wants to save Kate.&quot; With this sentence it was easy, she just changed &#39;save&#39; for &#39;join&#39;.<br />
<br />
When Amber clicked Enter, Priscila immediately undressed, stole the cock that Isis was holding and put it in her mouth. She continued pushing the cock down her throat until it went all the way inside her and out her ass.<br />
<br />
Isis didn&#39;t like to be left out, so she forced Priscila to stand on all fours, kneeled behind her, took the hard end of Amber&#39;s dick out of her ass and stuck it in her pussy. Soon she started to thrust behind Priscila as if she was fucking her and was fucked by Amber.<br />
<br />
Priscila and Kate looked at each other, smiling as they could with the part of the stick that connected their mouths, loving the situation.<br />
<br />
They enjoyed the moment until Amber came. She felt Kate and Priscila come also when the cum passed on the part of the cock inside them, but just before leaving the tip, Isis had her orgasm.<br />
<br />
Isis&#39; first orgasm in 5000 years was much more intense than any of them expected, so much so that Amber ended up enjoying a second time at the time that the first fucking orgasm was coming out of the tip of her cock inside the Egyptian girl.</p>
